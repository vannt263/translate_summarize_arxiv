    "many of the physical properties of graphene are captured by a one - band tight - binding electronic hamiltonian with uniform , real - valued , and nearest - neighbor hopping amplitude whereby : ( i ) electron - electron interactions are ignored ; ( ii ) spin - orbit interactions are ignored ; ( iii ) the electronic band structure is replaced by two conical dispersions centered about two non - equivalent points , the dirac points , in the first brillouin zone ; and ( iv ) the coupling to electro - magnetic external fields is governed by the minimal substitution . for instance , graphene displays an integer quantum hall effect ( iqhe ) as a function of the applied bias voltage ,  @xcite and it shows an universal optical conductivity .",
    "@xcite both these properties can be understood within the non - interacting electron picture .    although most experiments observe the massless dirac spectrum assumed in ( iii ) ,",
    "electronic instabilities in the form of single - particle spectral gaps ( mass gaps in short ) can be triggered by external perturbations such as some commensurate substrates ,  @xcite or large enough magnetic fields that can change the balance between the kinetic and the potential energy .",
    "@xcite in this paper we study a number of issues pertaining to dirac fermions in two - dimensions when a mass gap is opened in the fermionic spectrum by different non - vanishing order parameters . in particular , we shall study in great detail the simpler case when there is no superconducting instabilities and spin - rotation invariance is maintained , in which case there are only 4 possible masses .",
    "we derive in this simpler case the effective action when the massive fermions are integrated out , and read from this action the fractional statistics of topological defects in the mass order parameters .",
    "we also present a complete classification of all possible masses ( 36 in total ) in the general case where any spin , valley , and superconducting instabilities are permitted .    in the simpler spinless problem ( or , more realistically , the problem when spin - rotation invariance is never broken ) ,",
    "the 4 different masses that can be added to the two - dimensional dirac equation representing graphene are the following .",
    "one perturbation is a staggered chemical potential , taking values @xmath0 and @xmath1 in the two sublattices of the honeycomb lattice of graphene say .",
    "it opens a gap @xmath2 at the two dirac points .",
    "@xcite a second mass gap @xmath3 arises by adding directed next - nearest - neighbor hopping amplitudes in the presence of fluxes , but such that no net magnetic flux threads a hexagonal wigner - seitz unit cell of graphene say .",
    "this perturbation breaks time - reversal symmetry ( trs ) .",
    "@xcite finally , a real - valued modulation of the nearest - neighbor hopping amplitude with a wave vector connecting the two dirac points ( i.e. , a kekul dimerization pattern for graphene ) also opens a gap @xmath4 .",
    "@xcite this real - valued modulation of the nearest - neighbor hoppings is parametrized by the complex order parameter @xmath5 whose phase controls the angles of the dimerization pattern .",
    "this mass corresponds to two real masses @xmath6 and @xmath7 , bringing the total number of real - valued masses that conserve the electron number and spin - rotation symmetry ( srs ) to four .    if the order parameters @xmath8 , @xmath9 , and @xmath10 are not uniform , but vary in space and contain topological textures , then midgap states in the massive dirac spectrum can appear .",

    "the fractional charge bound to the vortices vanishes .",
    "@xcite    just like the charge , the statistical phase @xmath21 acquired upon the exchange of two vortices depends on whether the vortex in the phase of @xmath10 is screened or not by the axial gauge flux . in this paper",
    ", we derive the statistical angle from the effective action obtained upon integrating out the massive fermions .",
    "( we thereby resolve conflicting claims about @xmath21 in the literature .",

    "a remarkable complementarity has emerged .",
    "defects carry either a fractional charge @xmath16 but no fractional statistical phase when the breaking of trs is not too strong ( @xmath24 ) , or no fractional charge but a fractional statistics @xmath25 when the breaking of trs is dominant ( @xmath20 ) .",
    "when unit vortices in the order parameter @xmath10 are not accompanied by an axial gauge flux , they are logarithmically confined .",
    "@xcite although their statistics is not well - defined dynamically , it is nevertheless possible to create them and exchange them by external means .",
    "if so , both their charges and statistics acquire a dependence on all masses @xmath9 , @xmath8 , and @xmath10 , that we compute analytically and test numerically here in this paper .",
    "we then go beyond the simpler spinless case with only 4 masses , and we classify all 36 masses in the general case where any spin , valley , and superconducting instabilities are allowed .",
    "these 36 order parameters break up into 56 possible quintuplets of masses that add in quadrature ( to a value @xmath26 ) , and thus do not compete with one another .",
    "the haldane mass , the generalization of the @xmath9 mass above , competes with all the other 35 masses , and thus one has generically a quantum phase transition when @xmath19 . we argue that these 5-tuplets provide a rich playground for landau - forbidden continuous phase transitions .",
    "we discuss in the paper how any u(1 ) order parameter in a 5-tuplet can be assigned a conserved charge and supports topological defects in the form of vortices .",
    "a pair of u(1 ) order parameters in a 5-tuplet is said to be dual if the vortices of one order parameter binds the charge of the other order parameter and vice versa .",
    "a continuous phase transition can then connect directly the two dual u(1 ) ordered phases through a confining - deconfining transition of their vortices .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "we define the relevant continuum dirac hamiltonian and review its symmetries for the simpler problem with only 4 masses , that encodes the competition between a charge - density , a bond - density , and an integer - quantum - hall instability at the dirac ( charge neutral ) point of any graphene - like two - dimensional electronic system in sec .

    "we shall say that such a mass matrix is associated to a valence - bond solid ( vbs ) order parameter in analogy to the terminology used for quantum dimer models .",
    "a vbs order picks up a microscopic orientation that translates into a complex - valued order parameter in the continuum limit .",
    "hence , we shall distinguish between the real ( revbs ) and imaginary ( imvbs ) parts of the vbs .",

    "any mass matrix that does not satisfy the sls  ( [ eq : def sls ] ) corresponds to a microscopic order parameter for which the fermion bilinear has the two lattice fermions sitting on the same sublattice .",
