    "-1 cm    three decades after its surprising discovery in the kaon system@xcite , cp violation has remained mysterious .",
    "a desire for deeper insight into its origin is the driving force behind many ongoing experiments and even the construction of new machines such as the two b factories . while a profound understanding may yet be lacking , several mechanisms",
    "have been suggested to explain observed cp violation ( i.e. , @xmath7 ) within a gauge field theory .",
    "kobayashi and maskawa(km)@xcite proposed a third generation of fermions , so that cp violation would arise from the mixing of the three quark generations and is manifested by a single phase in the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) quark mixing matrix .",
    "since then , many other mechanisms have been put forth , including new gauge interactions@xcite , neutral higgs exchange@xcite , supersymmetric partners@xcite , and charged higgs exchange@xcite . however , the km model has the distinguishing feature that its mechanism is of milliweak strength , though its phenomenology is manifestly superweak@xcite , consistent with current cp related data . such intricate character has also been the driving force behind the desire to find non - superweak cp violation in the @xmath8 systems .    the leading model for the charged higgs mechanism of cp violation has long been the weinberg three - doublet model of cp violation@xcite , which became even more intriguing after branco@xcite proposed a version in which cp violation is softly or spontaneously broken .",
    "this scheme naturally avoids tree - level flavor changing neutral currents . without hard cp violation",
    "the ckm matrix is purely real ( the km mechanism is inoperative ) ; cp violation in the kaon system instead results from charged higgs exchange .",
    "many weaknesses of the weinberg - branco model , however , have since been identified . sanda and",
    "deshpande pointed out@xcite that short distance contributions to @xmath0 , if dominant , would lead to a larger @xmath1 than experimentally allowed , although it was subsequently demonstrated that long distance contributions to @xmath0 could be large enough to avoid this difficulty@xcite .",
    "more recently , however , it has become clear that this model has other problems . a charged higgs light enough to account for the observed @xmath0",
    "has already been excluded by the lep experiments@xcite . the large neutron electric dipole moment@xcite ( edm ) and substantial rate for @xmath9@xcite predicted",
    "are also contradicted by data , leading several authors@xcite to rule out this model .    as an illustrative model for charged higgs cp violation",
    ", the weinberg - branco model also has the shortcoming that its neutral higgs sector naturally also contains cp violation , which is usually ignored in the literature to simplify analysis and highlight the charged higgs mechanism .",
    "however , for flavor conserving cp odd observables ( e.g. , the neutron edm ) , the neutral higgs contribution generically can be competitive with that from charged higgs exchange .    in this letter",
    "we propose an alternative model that may serve as a generic example in which the charged higgs mechanism of cp violation naturally dominates completely over other mechanisms .",
    "cp is broken softly or spontaneously so that the km mechanism is inoperative .",
    "tree - level flavor changing neutral currents are automatically absent , and the neutral higgs sector is cp conserving at tree level . as in the km model , the quark and electron edms are severely suppressed .",
    "the electron edm vanishes at the two - loop level , while the first non - zero contribution to the quark edms is at two loops .",
    "in contrast to the weinberg - branco model , our model easily satisfies other experimental cp violation constraints as well as the rate for @xmath10 .",
    "finally , the parameter @xmath11 vanishes at tree - level , since we disallow hard cp breaking ; we shall see that radiative corrections are mild and consistent with the limit on a non - zero @xmath11 .    for most of this letter",
    ", we shall assume that cp is broken softly .",
    "one can also modify our model to break cp spontaneously by introducing at least one additional cp odd scalar boson , as discussed toward the end of this work , with the bulk of the phenomenology unchanged .",
    "cm    the weinberg - branco model augments the standard model ( sm ) with additional higgs @xmath12 doublets , which are responsible for kaon system cp violation ; in this model , then , since the charged higgs sector must break cp , so also must the neutral higgs sector .",
    "to mandate charged higgs exchange as the dominant cp violation mechanism we instead introduce only additional @xmath12 singlets of quarks and scalars to the theory .",
    "the simplest model for our purposes requires two additional charged higgs singlets , @xmath13 and a vectorial pair of heavy quark fields , @xmath14 , of electromagnetic charge @xmath15 .",
    "this vector quark charge assignment avoids fractionally charged hadrons .",
    "relevant new terms in the lagrangian are : @xmath16 - ( m^2)_{\\alpha\\beta } { h_\\alpha}^{\\dag } h_\\beta    - \\kappa_{\\alpha\\beta }          ( \\phi^{\\dag } \\phi-|\\langle\\phi\\rangle|^2 ) \\,h_\\alpha^{\\dag }                         h_\\beta   \\;\\;\\label{eq : lagrangian}\\ ] ] where @xmath17 is the standard model higgs doublet , and @xmath18 is summed over the down quark flavors ( @xmath19 ) .",
    "the vector quark has purely vectorial coupling to the photon and @xmath20 boson , with respective charges @xmath21 , while the charged higgs couples with charges @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "the neutral higgs sector is identical to that in the standard model , with neither flavor changing couplings nor cp violation .",
    "the matrices @xmath24 and @xmath25 are hermitian . except for the discussion at the end",
    ", we assume that cp is broken softly in this lagrangian , implying a special basis where all the yukawa ( @xmath26 ) and the sm couplings are real .",
    "we also require ( see below ) that dim-3 couplings , namely @xmath27 , are also real .",
    "this leaves , as in the km model , only a single cp violating parameter : im@xmath28 .",
    "we can diagonalize @xmath29 by a unitary matrix @xmath30 which in general is complex : @xmath31 , with @xmath32 the mass eigenstates .",
    "the quark - higgs interaction in the mass eigenstate basis is @xmath33 with @xmath34 .",
    "the cp - violating transit propagators@xcite can be expressed as @xmath35 with @xmath36 @xmath37 the mass of the lighter ( heavier ) charged higgs , cp violation explicitly vanishes if @xmath38 . in the limit that @xmath39 , these expressions reduce to @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the momentum flowing in the propagator",
    ". the rephasing - invariant measures of cp violation are then @xmath42 with @xmath43 , and @xmath44 . for flavor",
    "changing processes , @xmath45 plays the main role , with @xmath46 its counterpart in flavor conserving processes .    before continuing ,",
    "we comment on the strong cp - violation parameter @xmath47 . with cp symmetry",
    "imposed only on the hard ( dim-4 ) terms , the @xmath47 parameter is naively zero at tree level , but @xmath27 may still be complex . if so , alignment of the qcd vacuum with this complex quark mass will generate a non - zero tree level @xmath47 . to avoid this contribution ,",
    "we simply impose cp symmetry on both dim-4 and dim-3 terms .",
    "@xmath27 will then be real in the same basis that the tree - level @xmath47 vanishes@xcite . a similar scheme can also be arranged if cp is broken spontaneously ( see below ) . the first non - zero contribution to @xmath47 ( occuring at two loops )",
    "will be discussed later .",
    "with cp conservation modulo soft - breaking enforced , the ckm matrix is real at tree level . leading cp violating phenomena",
    "should be due solely to the cp - violating phase in the charged higgs sector .",
    "making the usual `` @xmath48 dominance '' assumption , the cp violation parameter @xmath0 is approximately @xmath49 we shall postpone discussion of @xmath50 , but will see later that in our model , as in the km model , the second term is negligible .",
    "experimentally , @xmath51 . the @xmath52 part of the effective hamiltonian to one - loop ( i.e. , box diagrams ) can be written as : @xmath53 the @xmath54-boson diagrams yield a purely real wilson coefficient @xmath55 ; cp violation in kaon matrix elements is due solely to the operator @xmath56 rather than @xmath57 , in contrast to the km model .",
    "the complex coefficient @xmath58 is generated by the charged higgs through a box diagram with vertices given by eq.([eq : qqh ] ) . at the scale @xmath59",
    ", we have @xmath60 with @xmath61 , @xmath62 , and @xmath63 .",
    "clearly , @xmath64 is real when @xmath65 as it should be . for illustration",
    ", we shall take @xmath39 and @xmath66 , in which case the first term is negligible and @xmath67 .",
    "following ref.@xcite for the renormalization group evolution and numerical evaluation of hadronic matrix elements to leading order , we obtain @xmath68}^{6/27 } { \\left [ \\frac{\\alpha_s(m_b)}{\\alpha_s(m_c ) } \\right]}^{6/25 } { \\left [ \\frac{\\alpha_s(m_t)}{\\alpha_s(m_b ) } \\right]}^{6/23 } { \\left [ \\frac{\\alpha_s(m_q)}{\\alpha_s(m_t ) } \\right]}^{6/21 } c^r_{\\delta s=2}(m_q ) \\nonumber \\\\ & \\approx & 0.59 \\,\\alpha_s^{-2/9}(\\mu )   \\,c^r_{\\delta s=2}(m_q ) \\ .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we will assume that the @xmath54-boson contributions dominate the real part of all relevant matrix elements ; analysis of @xmath69 below shows this to be consistent .",
    "we will thus take , _",
    "e.g_. , @xmath70 from experiment , and have no need of the explicit value of @xmath54-boson contributions to , e.g. , @xmath71 .",
    "let @xmath72 be the contribution of @xmath56 to the mass matrix . from the input parameters @xmath73",
    "and the relation @xmath74 @xmath75 follows the numerical prediction @xmath76 .",
    "demanding that the imaginary part of @xmath72 gives enough contribution to @xmath0 and the corresponding real part gives just a fraction @xmath77 of the mass difference @xmath78 ( _ i.e. _ @xmath79 ) , we obtain constraints on the wilson coefficients : @xmath80 and @xmath81 . again , with @xmath82 , we then find @xmath83 where @xmath84 .",
    "the reasonable constraint @xmath85 can be easily satisfied .",
    "the parameter @xmath89 describes direct cp violation in the kaon system .",
    "it is given in terms of the @xmath90 decay amplitudes @xmath91 , where the subscript indicates the isospin of the outgoing state . with @xmath92 , @xmath93 , @xmath94 , and @xmath95 , @xmath96",
    "the dominant contributions should be the gluon and electroweak penguins mediated by @xmath97 and @xmath98 . in contrast to the km model , the vector coupling of the vector quark means that the @xmath20 boson penguin will be suppressed by @xmath99 due to vector current conservation .",
    "the gluon penguin contributes only to @xmath50 , but the isospin - breaking electromagnetic penguin ( emp ) gives rise to both @xmath50 and @xmath100 .",
    "due to its suppression by @xmath101 , the latter affects @xmath89 solely through its contribution to @xmath102 . including the effects of evolution from the vector quark mass down to the charm mass scale",
    ", we estimate the emp contribution to be @xmath103 .",
    "there is an additional contribution to @xmath102 from @xmath104 isospin - breaking , with @xmath105 .",
    "we shall ignore the electromagnetic penguin contribution here ( inclusion of the electromagnetic penguin will be studied elsewhere@xcite ) , and set @xmath106 to simply the analysis .",
    "the inclusion of @xmath107 will not change our conclusion qualitatively .",
    "the gluon penguin diagram , which involves the virtual vector quark @xmath98 and the charge higgs boson , produces an effective hamiltonian at the electroweak scale : @xmath108 @xmath109 @xmath110 written in terms of the operators in ref.@xcite ( but of flipped chirality ) , @xmath111 with @xmath112 , @xmath113 , @xmath114 and @xmath115 , where we have adopted the common notation @xmath116 .",
    "again , for simplicity , we study the scenario that @xmath39 and @xmath117 gev .",
    "numerically , @xmath118 the wilson coefficients are then run from @xmath27 down to the charm mass scale via the leading logarithm renormalization group equations@xcite , so that @xmath119 , where @xmath120 .",
    "we note that the two other wilson coefficients , @xmath121 , are not generated in the evolution .",
    "terms contributing to cp violation , and thus @xmath122 , in @xmath50 are @xmath123 . using the expressions for the matrix elements @xmath124 found in ref.@xcite at the scale @xmath125",
    ", we obtain @xmath126 @xmath127 for the weak couplings considered here , @xmath128 is approximated quite well by the experimental value @xmath129 , @xmath130 , so that @xmath131 the second equality is derived from constraints in eq.([eq : dmineq ] ) . for @xmath132 and @xmath133 , @xmath134 , which is somewhat smaller than , but certainly consistent with , the results of the fnal - e731 measurement of @xmath135@xcite , but further from agreement with the cern - na31 result of @xmath136@xcite .",
    "if we relax the constraint on the contribution to @xmath78 to allow @xmath137 ( reflecting the uncertainty due to the large long - distance contributions ) , then @xmath69 rises to @xmath138 .",
    "if the omitted electromagnetic penguin contribution @xmath139 turns out to be negative and important , it could increase the predicted value of @xmath122 by perhaps as much as a factor of two , still well below the experimental limit .",
    "another ( much weaker ) constraint to be considered is that from the @xmath140 mass splitting@xcite .",
    "proceeding in close analogy to the calculation of the contribution to @xmath78 , we obtain : @xmath141 where again @xmath39 , @xmath142 gev , with the renormalization group scaling factor @xmath143 evaluated as for @xmath78 , and @xmath144 , @xmath145 mev , @xmath146 gev .",
    "given the experimental value @xmath147 gev , we have @xmath148 even taking @xmath149 , the fractional contribution is only about @xmath150 .",
    "_ @xmath151 _ : because the operator due to charged higgs diagrams has helicity opposite to that generated in the standard model contribution , the two do not interfere at amplitude level . taking @xmath152 gev : @xmath153 furthermore",
    ", the relevant parameter @xmath154 is not subject to constraints from @xmath0 or @xmath89 .",
    "if it is of the same size as @xmath155 , the deviation from the sm would be negligible .",
    "_ strong cp and @xmath47 _ : there are no tree level complex quark masses in our model , and @xmath47 is only induced starting at the two - loop level , via generation of complex down - flavor quark masses . a typical diagram is shown in fig .  1",
    "; in contrast to @xmath0 and @xmath122 , this effect does not require more than one flavor of down - quark .",
    "roughly , @xmath156 . the present constraint , @xmath157 ,",
    "can easily be accommodated , assuming a moderately small @xmath25 .    _ neutron electric dipole moment _ : there is no one - loop diagram to produce the electric dipole moment ( edm ) of the light quarks , so our model is very weakly constrained by neutron edm limits .",
    "a down - flavor quark edm , however , is generated at the two - loop level , in parallel with the generation of complex down quark masses discussed above . a typical contribution is given by fig .",
    "1 , except with an external photon is attached to internal charged lines .",
    "an estimate of the two loop contribution is consistent with the current experimental bound .",
    "_ electron electric dipole moment _ : unlike the down - flavor quarks , the electron couples only very indirectly with the cp violating sector .",
    "the electron edm vanishes at the two loop level .",
    "we expect the three - loop level contribution to be insignificantly small .",
    "_ decay of new particles _ : in this model , @xmath158 and @xmath98 can be assigned a new conserved quantum number which guarantees a lightest exotic particle , either @xmath159 or @xmath98 .",
    "a stable charged higgs would lead to events with possibly large missing transverse energy , while a stable vector quark might be detected through formation of its bound states@xcite .",
    "alternatively , one can ignore this quantum number , so that an additional interaction , @xmath160 , should be present , which can lead to @xmath161 ( on - shell or off - shell ) decays into @xmath162 . even in this case ,",
    "lepton number is still conserved , just as in the standard model , since the vector quark and charged higgs will naturally carry the lepton number ( @xmath163 . another way for @xmath97 to decay is to introduce a second higgs doublet and let @xmath97 couple to two different higgs doublets . in that case",
    "@xmath97 can decay into a neutral higgs , plus a charged higgs which in turn decays into ordinary quarks and leptons .",
    "we shall comment on the corresponding model in which cp is broken spontaneously .",
    "this can be implemented by adding a cp - odd scalar , @xmath164 , which develops a non - zero vacuum expectation value ( vev ) and breaks cp . however , this scalar will in general couple to @xmath165 and give rise a complex tree level vector quark mass and , therefore , a tree level @xmath47 . to avoid this , one can add another cp - even scalar singlet , @xmath166 , and impose discrete symmetries which change the signs of either or both @xmath164 and @xmath166 and nothing else . as a result ,",
    "a term such as @xmath167 is forbidden and the only additional term relevant for cp violation is @xmath168 $ ] .",
    "this extra term will give rise to complex @xmath28 after both @xmath166 and @xmath164 develop vevs and break cp .",
    "note that before breaking cp spontaneously , there are two possible definitions of cp symmetry , depending on which of @xmath166 and @xmath164 are defined to be cp odd ; this is why both must develop develop vevs in order to break cp .",
    "the extra neutral higgs will of course mix with the sm higgs , but since @xmath164 does not couple to fermions directly , it will have scalar - pseudoscalar coupling to fermions only at the loop level . as a result",
    ", its contribution to any cp violating phenomenology will be small .",
    "we have proposed a model whose cp violation is solely mediated by charged higgs bosons .",
    "the model is surprisingly similar to the km model in the sense that the cp - breaking mechanism is seemingly milliweak , while its phenomenology ( as studied here ) is quite superweak - like .",
    "the phenomenological distinction between the two will likely be made clear in experiments planned for the b factory ; although our model predicts a real ckm matrix , with corresponding collapse of the unitarity km triangle , new cp violating contributions will be contained in all the b decay processes designed to measure this triangle .",
