    "a spin glass ( sg ) phenomenon has been attracting great interests for thirty years both theoretically and experimentally @xcite .",
    "it is also one of the toughest subject in a field of the computational physics .",
    "though many theoretical investigations have been done , it is still an unsettled issue whether or not a simple random bond model explains the sg phase transition .",
    "spins of many sg materials are well - approximated by the heisenberg spins .",
    "however , numerical studies have suggested that there is no finite - temperature sg transition in the heisenberg model @xcite .",
    "this is quite different from the ising sg case : many numerical investigations @xcite consistently explain corresponding experimental results @xcite .",
    "kawamura @xcite proposed the chirality mechanism in order to settle the discrepancy in the heisenberg spin glass .",
    "the chiral - glass transition occurs without the spin - glass order .",
    "a small but finite random anisotropy in the real materials mixes the chirality and the spin .",
    "this effect induces the observed sg transition .",
    "the scenario sounds nice .",
    "however , matsubara @xcite recently recalculated the domain - wall excess energy and the spin - glass susceptibility and suggested that the finite sg transition occurs .",
    "the methods are quite similar to the previous ones @xcite .",
    "the final conclusion drastically changes by a subtle difference in the analyses of the obtained data .",
    "computer simulations on sg models suffer from serious slow dynamics .",
    "the system sizes treated up to now are accordingly limited to very small ones , e.g. , mostly a linear size @xmath2 or less in three dimensions .",
    "the contradiction of the numerical results mentioned above possibly originates in the smallness of the system .",
    "this is a limit of the conventional equilibrium simulational study .",
    "one realizes the equilibrium state in finite size systems .",
    "then , the thermodynamic properties are obtained by the finite - size scaling analysis .",
    "we take an opposite approach to the thermodynamic limit and reexamine the sg transition .",
    "first , we take the infinite size limit by dealing with a very large system within a finite time range before the finite - size effect appears .",
    "then , the finite - time scaling analysis is performed to obtain the thermodynamic properties .",
    "this method is known as the nonequilibrium relaxation ( ner ) method @xcite . in our previous paper",
    "@xcite it is clarified that the sg transition occurs at the same finite temperature as the chiral - glass transition occurs .",
    "of course , the chirality freezes if the spin freezes .",
    "the estimated critical exponent @xmath3 is consistent with the corresponding experimental result @xcite .",
    "the chirality mechanism is not necessary . in this article",
    "we expand the same analysis to the ising sg model and the xy sg model in three dimensions .",
    "it is found that the ising , the xy , and the heisenberg models undergo finite - temperature sg transitions with the weak universality .",
    "the model we work with is the nearest - neighbor @xmath0 random bond model . for each random bond configuration",
    "we prepare eight real replicas with different paramagnetic spin configurations and with different random number sequences .",
    "spins are updated by the single - spin - flip algorithm .",
    "we calculate at each time step @xmath4 the spin - glass susceptibility @xmath5 through overlaps @xmath6 between two replicas ( @xmath7 and @xmath8 ) out of eight : @xmath9_\\mathrm{conf } = n \\left [ \\frac{2}{m(m-1)}\\sum_{\\alpha > \\beta}^{m}\\sum_{\\mu,\\nu } ^{x , y , z } ( q^{\\alpha\\beta}_{\\mu,\\nu})^2 \\right   ] _ \\mathrm{conf } % \\end   { equation}\\ ] ] indices @xmath10 and @xmath11 denote three components of spin degrees of freedom .",
    "the thermal average is replaced by the summation over the real replicas , whose number is denoted by @xmath12 .",
    "it determines the statistics of the thermal average .",
    "thus , a relaxation function @xmath13 for one bond configuration is obtained .",
    "a configurational average is taken over @xmath13 with different random bond configurations , different initial paramagnetic states , and different random number sequences .",
    "the spin - glass susceptibility is expected to diverge at the transition temperature ( @xmath14 ) as @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the dynamic exponent .",
    "we obtain @xmath14 , @xmath3 , and @xmath17 by the finite - time scaling analysis .",
    "the ner of the binder parameter @xmath18 is also calculated .",
    "since the quantity is related to the fourth - order cumulant , quite a lot of samples are necessary to obtain meaningful data .",
    "numbers of the bond configurations to obtain the results in this article is summarized in table [ tab : samplist ] .",
    "the binder parameter is expected to behave at @xmath14 as @xmath19 , by which @xmath16 is independently obtained .",
    "then , @xmath11 is estimated from a value of @xmath17 obtained by the scaling .",
    "the ner of the spin - glass susceptibility was originally applied to the ising sg model by huse @xcite and that of the binder parameter was applied by blundell et al .",
    "numerical results suggesting the weak universality is shown in fig . [ fig : weakuniv ] . the ner data of the spin - glass susceptibility exhibit an algebraic divergence with the exponent @xmath20 .",
    "the ner function of the ising model and that of the heisenberg model are not distinguishable .",
    "that of the xy model differs by a factor three .",
    "an amplitude of the @xmath5 is dependent on the model .",
    "if we take into account a correction - to - scaling term with its exponent @xmath21 @xcite , the relaxation functions fit to the expression @xmath22 $ ] from the first step . a deviation of the xy data from the diverging line after @xmath23 is possibly due to the finite - size effect .",
    "the ner of the binder parameter shows an algebraic divergence with @xmath24 for both models .",
    "therefore , we obtain @xmath1 which is common to the ising and the heisenberg model . this suggests the weak universality .     at @xmath14 .",
    "data of the xy model are multiplied by three .",
    "the temperatures are @xmath25 for the ising model , @xmath26 for the xy model , and @xmath27 for the heisenberg model .",
