    "the observed neutrino masses can be naturally accounted for by adding to the standard model lagrangian three heavy singlets , usually identified with the right - handed neutrinos .",
    "this framework is denoted as the type i see - saw mechanism , or simply the see - saw mechanism @xcite .",
    "furthermore , this framework can also accommodate , although not explain , the large atmospheric and solar mixing angles , as well as the small 13 element in the leptonic mixing matrix .",
    "although the see - saw mechanism describes qualitatively well the observations , it lacks predictive power .",
    "the reason is that the leptonic lagrangian is defined at high energies by 21 parameters , whereas experimentally we can only measure at most 12 parameters .",
    "the 9 remaining parameters are lost in the decoupling process and can be arbitrarily chosen , without leaving any other trace at low energies .    in the supersymmetric version of the see - saw mechanism",
    "the neutrino yukawa coupling affects the renormalization group evolution of the slepton parameters above the decoupling scale @xcite , and thus leave an imprint that could be disentangled using low energy experiments ( after making some assumptions on the structure of the slepton parameters at the cut - off scale ) .",
    "for instance , phenomena such as rare decays @xcite electric dipole moments @xcite , or mass splittings among the different generations of charged sleptons or sneutrinos @xcite provide additional information about the see - saw parameters .",
    "this information is encoded in a @xmath0 hermitian matrix , @xmath1 , that depends on nine parameters ( six moduli and three phases ) .",
    "it can be shown that these nine parameters are precisely the complementary information needed to reconstruct the high energy lagrangian @xcite .",
    "the positive consequence of this observation is that the see - saw mechanism can be parametrized just in terms of low energy observables ; the negative consequence is that for any set of low energy lepton and slepton parameters , there is a high energy theory with three right - handed neutrinos that can accommodate it , and in consequence , the see - saw model can not be disproved .    in this parametrization ,",
    "the correspondence between high energy and low energy parameters is one to one .",
    "therefore , any additional hypothesis on the high - energy see - saw parameters would lead to predictions on the low energy parameters .",
    "some well motivated assumptions have been proposed in the literature , such as texture zeros , symmetric matrices or the two right - handed neutrino model , and their consequences studied in a number of papers . in this work",
    "we will concentrate on the latter possibility @xcite .",
    "the motivation is the following .",
    "leaving aside the lsnd anomaly , experiments have measured two mass splittings , indicating that at least two new scales have to be introduced .",
    "the two new scales could correspond to the masses of two right handed neutrinos , being the third one not necessary to reproduce the oscillation experiments .",
    "therefore , a model with just two right handed neutrinos could explain all the observations , but it depends on less parameters .",
    "the two right - handed neutrino model has some interesting features .",
    "namely , the two right - handed neutrino model predicts a hierarchical spectrum for the light neutrinos , being the lightest strictly massless .",
    "furthermore , since there are only two non - vanishing masses , there is only one majorana phase , corresponding to the phase difference between these two eigenvalues .",
    "analogously to the model with three right - handed neutrinos , there are three mixing angles and one dirac phase .",
    "since the number of parameters involved is smaller , we expect predictions not only for the neutrino mass matrix , but also for the low - energy slepton mass matrix ( under some assumptions about the structure of this matrix at high energy ) , as well as a simpler reconstruction procedure of the high energy parameters . in section 2",
    "we will show that in the two right - handed neutrino model some relations arise among different elements in the slepton mass matrix .",
    "we will also present a possible parametrization of this model just in terms of low energy observables . in section 3",
    "we will discuss the prospects to determine experimentally these parameters , and accordingly the feasibility of the reconstruction of the high - energy parameters . in section 4 we will propose an exact reconstruction procedure , and illustrate it for a particular possibility of the low energy parameters . in section 5 we will analyze different limits of the three right handed neutrino model that can be well described in practice by a two right - handed neutrino model , and where the reconstruction procedure proposed in this paper applies .",
    "finally , in section 6 we will present our conclusions .",
    "we will also present an appendix with a more elaborated reconstruction procedure .",
    "in the appropriate basis , the two right - handed neutrino ( 2rhn ) model is defined at high energies by a @xmath2 yukawa matrix and two right - handed neutrino masses , @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "this amounts to eight moduli and three phases . on the other hand , at low energies",
    "the neutrino mass matrix is defined by five moduli ( two masses and three mixing angles ) plus two phases ( the dirac phase and the majorana phase ) .",
    "therefore , the number of unknown parameters is reduced to three moduli and one phase .    using the parametrization presented in @xcite",
    ", the neutrino yukawa coupling can be expressed as : _",
    "= d_r d_u^/h_u^0 , [ yukawa ] where @xmath5 is the diagonal matrix of the square roots of the right - handed masses , @xmath6 is the diagonal matrix of the squared roots of the physical masses of the light neutrinos , @xmath7 is the vacuum expectation value of the neutral component of the up - type higgs doublet , @xmath8 is the leptonic mixing matrix @xcite , and @xmath9 is a @xmath2 complex matrix , which parametrizes the information that is lost in the decoupling of the right - handed neutrinos .",
    "it is possible to prove that @xmath9 has the following structure @xcite r= , [ r2x3 ] where @xmath10 is a complex parameter and @xmath11 is a parameter that accounts for a discrete indeterminacy in the yukawa coupling .",
    "notice that we have included all the low energy phases in the definition of the matrix @xmath8 , _ i.e. _ we have written the leptonic mixing matrix in the form @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the majorana phase and @xmath14 has the form of the ckm matrix : v= , [ vdef ] so that the neutrino mass matrix is @xmath15 .",
    "it is straightforward to check that eq.([yukawa ] ) indeed satisfies @xmath16 .",
    "the yukawa coupling affects the renormalization group equation of the slepton parameters through the combination @xmath1 , that depends in general on six moduli and three phases .",
    "since the yukawa coupling depends in the 2rhn model on only three unknown moduli and one phase , so does @xmath17 , and consequently it is possible to obtain predictions on the moduli of three @xmath17-matrix elements and the phases of two @xmath17-matrix elements .",
    "namely , from eq.([yukawa ] ) one obtains that : u^ p u = u^ * y*^_*y * _ u = d",
    "_ r^ d_*m _ * r d _ /h^0 ^ 2 . [ mastereq ]",
    "since @xmath18 , it follows that @xmath19 , for @xmath20 , leading to three relations among the elements in @xmath17 .",
    "for instance , one could derive the diagonal elements in @xmath17 in terms of the off - diagonal elements : p_11&=&- , + p_22&=&- , + p_33&=&- .",
    "[ diagonal ] the observation of these correlations would be non - trivial tests of the 2rhn model .",
    "the relations for the phases arise from the hermicity of @xmath17 , since the diagonal elements in @xmath17 have to be real . taking as the independent phase the argument of @xmath21",
    ", one can derive from eq.([diagonal ] ) the arguments of the remaining elements : e^iargp_13&= & , + e^iargp_23&= & , [ phases ] where the @xmath22 sign has to be chosen so that the eigenvalues of @xmath17 are positive .",
    "it is important to remark that the hermicity of @xmath17 is not guaranteed for any value of @xmath21 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 ; only some particular ranges for the parameters are allowed , corresponding to the values for which the arguments of the square roots in eq.([phases ] ) are positive .",
    "we conclude then that the @xmath17-matrix parameters @xmath21 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 can be regarded as independent and can be used as an alternative parametrization of the 2rhn model . together with the five moduli and the two phases of the neutrino mass matrix , sum up to the eight moduli and the three phases necessary to reconstruct the high - energy lagrangian of the 2rhn model .",
    "an interesting feature of the 2rhn model is that it could be feasible to reconstruct the neutrino mass matrix .",
    "this model predicts that one of the neutrino masses vanishes , and in consequence the spectrum is necessarily hierarchical . in this scenario ,",
    "the masses would have been already determined by present oscillation experiments : @xmath25 and @xmath26 , where @xmath27ev and @xmath28ev are the @xmath29 ranges for the solar and atmospheric mass splittings obtained from the combined analysis of global data @xcite . in the next few years , the measurements of the mass splittings are expected to improve . to be specific , the error in the measurement of the atmospheric mass splitting , @xmath30 ,",
    "is expected to be reduced by experiments using the cern to gran sasso neutrino beam ( icarus @xcite and opera @xcite ) , minos @xcite , no@xmath31a @xcite and particularly t2k @xcite , that will probably reduce the present error by one order of magnitude . there are also proposals to reduce the error in the measurement of the solar mass splitting , @xmath32 .",
    "namely , if the superk detector was loaded with gadolinium , it would be possible to reduce the error by a factor of six @xcite .    concerning the mixing angles , two of them",
    "have been determined to a good accuracy by present experiments : @xmath33 and @xmath34 at the @xmath29 level @xcite .",
    "the t2k experiment will probably reduce the error in @xmath35 by a factor of two .",
    "on the other hand , the error in @xmath36 will not be substantially reduced in the near future , although an experiment similar to kamland but with a baseline slightly shorter , @xmath37 km , could reduce the error by a factor of four @xcite .",
    "the angle @xmath38 has not been detected yet but the global analysis sets the upper bound @xmath39 , also at @xmath29 @xcite .",
    "ongoing experiments such as minos , icarus or opera could improve the present limit by a factor of two , while future experiments as d - chooz @xcite by a factor of four , and t2k or no@xmath31a by a factor of ten .",
    "if @xmath38 is large , the combined analysis of the experiments could provide some information about the dirac phase @xmath40 .",
    "however , the detailed analysis of cp violation in the neutrino sector will require superbeams .",
    "for instance , improving the proton intensity at jhf to 4mw and using the proposed hyper - kamiokande detector , it could be possible to reach a sensitivity below @xmath41 for @xmath42 and around @xmath43 for @xmath40 @xcite .",
    "thus we find that there are good prospects to determine the masses , mixing angles and @xmath40 to the percent level in the next 10 - 20 years @xcite .",
    "however , the measurement of the majorana phase is still very challenging .",
    "although it could in principle be measured in experiments of neutrinoless double beta decay , the sensitivity of the projected experiments is still far from observing this process in the case of a hierarchical spectrum of neutrinos @xcite .",
    "concerning the matrix @xmath17 , there are also very good prospects to determine the relevant parameters : @xmath21 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 . with experiments of rare decays",
    ", it would be possible to determine the moduli of the off - diagonal elements of @xmath17 .",
    "the present bounds on the rates for these decays are @xmath44 @xcite , @xmath45 @xcite ( belle ) or @xmath46 @xcite ( babar ) , and @xmath47 @xcite , that translate into @xmath48 , @xmath49 and @xmath50 , for @xmath51 and typical slepton masses of @xmath52gev @xcite .    in the next few years , the sensitivity of the experiments to these processes",
    "is also expected to improve .",
    "the meg experiment expects to reach a sensitivity of @xmath53 @xcite , that would translate into @xmath54 .",
    "although presently the most stringent constraints on @xmath55 arise from the process @xmath56 , this role could be played in the future by experiments on the coherent conversion of muons into electrons in nuclei .",
    "conversion , the conversion rate is approximately three orders of magnitude smaller than the branching ratio for @xmath57 . ] the current experimental bounds are @xmath58 @xcite and @xmath59 @xcite , and are expected to be improved by the prism / prime experiment , aiming to a sensitivity of @xmath60 @xcite , or the cern neutrino factory , aiming to @xmath61 @xcite .    on the other hand , b - factories are also @xmath62-factories , and constitute splendid opportunities to search for rare @xmath62 decays .",
    "future super b - factories could produce of the order of @xmath63 @xmath62 pairs at a luminosity of 10 @xmath64 , allowing to probe branching ratios for the rare @xmath62 decays down to the level of @xmath65 @xcite .",
    "the only phase that appears in @xmath17 could be determined from measurements of the electric dipole moment of the electron , whose present bound is @xmath66 @xcite . in order to disentangle the contribution from the neutrino yukawa couplings it would be necessary to determine the phases in the neutralino or the chargino sector from other experiments , most probably the lhc or the ilc .",
    "the prospects to improve the sensitivity of the experiments to detect electron dipole moments are also very encouraging . by using the metastable @xmath67 $ ] state of pbo",
    "it could be possible to improve the sensitivity of the experiments to @xmath68 @xcite , or even to @xmath69 in a few years @xcite . in the longer term",
    ", it could be possible to improve the sensitivity to @xmath70 using solid state techniques @xcite .",
    "incidentally , it has been argued that the effect of the phases in the neutrino yukawa coupling would not be observed in the electron dipole moment before this sensitivity is reached @xcite .    in summary , the prospects to detect or further constrain the low - energy parameters of the 2rhn model are very encouraging , and accordingly the prospects to reconstruct the high energy theory from experiments .",
    "it is remarkable that most of the problems encountered when determining the low energy parameters of the 3rhn model disappear in the 2rhn model .",
    "namely , in the 3rhn model there are two majorana phases , and despite one combination of them could be measured in experiments of neutrinoless double beta decay , there is no proposed experimental set - up to measure the second combination .",
    "furthermore , in the matrix @xmath17 there are more independent parameters in the 3rhn model than in the 2rhn model , and the prospects to measure them are not so encouraging . in particular , the diagonal elements in @xmath17 would be quite hard to measure , although it could be possible to measure the largest mass difference among the sleptons or the sneutrinos in colliders @xcite . on the other hand , the measurement of the smallest mass difference seems to be far out of the reach of the proposed future experiments .",
    "concerning the electric dipole moments , there are some prospects to improve the present bound on the muon electric dipole moment , @xmath71 @xcite , to @xmath72 using the muon ring at bnl @xcite or even to @xmath73 at the neutrino factory @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the present bounds on the @xmath62 electric dipole moment are very loose , @xmath74 @xcite , and there are no prospects to improve them substantially in the near future .",
    "it was pointed out in @xcite that the phase of @xmath10 is the only phase that plays a role in the mechanism of leptogenesis @xcite .",
    "therefore , the see - saw mechanism could be parametrized in terms of the leptogenesis phase instead of the phase that induces electric dipole moments .",
    "nevertheless , the leptogenesis mechanism depends on assumptions that are harder to test than the assumptions needed to disentangle the phase in @xmath17 from electric dipole moments , and thus this possibility does not seem to be very practical . in any case , we find very remarkable the close relation between electric dipole moments and leptogenesis in the 2rhn model .",
    "in section 2 we have discussed that the complete lagrangian can be written in terms of the five moduli and two phases of the neutrino mass matrix , and the three independent moduli and two phases of the matrix @xmath17 , that is involved in the radiative corrections of the slepton parameters . in this section",
    "we will derive _ exact _",
    "formulas for the high energy parameters in terms of these low energy parameters @xcite    to this end , we will use the parametrization of the yukawa couplings in eq.([yukawa ] ) , so that all our ignorance of the high energy theory is encoded in the right - handed neutrino masses , @xmath3 and @xmath4 , and the complex parameter in the matrix @xmath9 , @xmath10 .",
    "let us define the hermitian matrix @xmath75 , that depends _ exclusively _ on parameters that in principle could be measured in low energy experiments .",
    "the first row and column    vanish and yield the relations among the @xmath17-matrix elements already presented in eq.([diagonal ] ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the remaining elements @xmath76 , @xmath77 , @xmath78 , can be written in terms of the high - energy parameters @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath10 .",
    "therefore , one can invert the equations to derive exact expressions for the high - energy parameters in terms of the low energy parameters in @xmath79 .",
    "these expressions are : m_1&=&h_u^0 ^2 , + m_2&=&h_u^0 ^2 , + 2z&= & ( -+ ) . [ reconstruction ] to complete the reconstruction procedure , the yukawa coupling would be derived from these parameters using eq.([yukawa ] ) and where the discrete parameter @xmath80 in eq.([r2x3 ] ) is determined by : = ( m_1 z z^*-m_2 z z^ * ) .    in the case",
    "that all the parameters are real , the expressions greatly simplify : m_1&=&h_u^0 ^2 , + m_2&=&h_u^0 ^2 , + 2z&=&(- ) .",
    "[ reconstruction - real ]    we would like to illustrate now the reconstruction procedure for an interesting possibility for the matrix @xmath17 . in the previous section we argued that among all the elements in @xmath17 , the ones with better prospects to be constrained or measured were the off - diagonal ones .",
    "therefore , it will prove convenient from the phenomenological point of view to use @xmath21 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 , together with the neutrino mass matrix , to parametrize the 2rhn model .",
    "furthermore , the stringent constraints on the process @xmath81 suggests us to take the limit @xmath82 is stronger than the bounds on @xmath83 is that presently the muon sources are more intense than the tau sources .",
    "other possibilities are a priori equally plausible from the phenomenological point of view , despite there is a theoretical prejudice in favor of @xmath84 this limit yields a very constrained structure for the @xmath17-matrix , p , [ p - interesting ] that in turn would imply predictions for the mass splittings among the sleptons in terms of the branching ratios for the processes @xmath85 and @xmath86 .",
    "note also that the phases in the matrix @xmath17 are fixed in terms of the phases in the leptonic mixing matrix .",
    "namely , to make the diagonal elements of the matrix @xmath17 real , as required by hermicity , one has to require p_13 & & arg u_11 -arg u_31 + , + argp_23 & & arg u_21 -arg u_31 + . [ arguments - interesting ] we have also resolved the @xmath22 ambiguity in the expressions for the arguments of @xmath87 and @xmath88 in eq.([phases ] ) by applying the sylvester criterion , in order to yield positive eigenvalues in @xmath17 .",
    "note that the majorana phase , @xmath89 , will not appear in these expressions , and the only phase that will appear is the dirac phase , suppressed by the small value of @xmath38 . to be precise ,",
    "if we substitute @xmath90 , @xmath91 and we take into account that @xmath38 is small , we obtain p_13&&-|p_13|(1 + i  _ 13 ) , + p_23&&|p_23|(1 + 2i  _ 13 ) .",
    "therefore , in the limit where @xmath92 , all the elements in @xmath17 are expected to be real to a good approximation , and accordingly the contribution to the electric dipole moments from the slepton parameters is expected to be very small .",
    "note also that requiring positive eigenvalues for @xmath17 requires that @xmath87 is negative and @xmath88 positive .",
    "the high - energy parameters can be easily reconstructed from the general formulas in eq.([reconstruction ] ) , where the relevant elements in the matrix @xmath79 read : q_22 & & |p_13| + |p_23| , + q_33 & & |p_13| + |p_23| , + q_23 & & -|p_13| -|p_23| .    to show the analytical results , we will limit ourselves to the case where @xmath90 , @xmath91 , and @xmath93 , as suggested by data .",
    "depending on the values of the remaining non - vanishing parameters , we can distinguish two limits : @xmath94 and @xmath95 .",

    "therefore , when @xmath38 is large , it seems unavoidable the precise measurement of @xmath38 , @xmath40 and @xmath89 to determine @xmath98 and to reconstruct the yukawa coupling .",
    "although the 2rhn model can explain all the neutrino experiments , the 3rhn model is without any doubt much more appealing from the theoretical point of view . nevertheless ,",
    "there are some situations where the 3rhn model can be well approximated by a 2rhn model , both from the point of view of neutrino masses , as from the point of view of radiative corrections , parametrized by the matrix @xmath17 . in these situations ,",
    "the procedure presented in this paper to reconstruct the high - energy parameters would apply .",
    "let us discuss first the case of the neutrino mass matrix , that in the basis where the right - handed neutrino mass matrix is diagonal reads : @xmath120 where @xmath121 .",
    "two right - handed neutrinos dominate the see - saw when & & ,   or + & & ,   or + & & ,   for  all  i , j=1,2,3 . the most interesting cases are the first and the third .",
    "the first one corresponds to the case in which the yukawa couplings for the first generation of right handed neutrinos are tiny , @xmath122 , for @xmath20 .",
    "if this is the case , the radiative corrections are also dominated by the same two right - handed neutrinos , the two heaviest ones .",
    "therefore , in this case the 3rhn model can be well approximated by a 2rhn model , both from the point of view of neutrino masses as of radiative corrections .",
    "since the two relevant right - handed neutrinos are the two heaviest ones , the corresponding yukawa couplings could be large , and the radiative corrections could be sizable .",
    "the third case corresponds to the situation where the mass of the heaviest right - handed neutrino is much larger than the mass of the other two , @xmath123 @xcite .",
    "however , in general the heaviest right - handed neutrino will produce sizable contributions to the radiative corrections .",
    "if this is the case , the 3rhn model could be reduced to a 2rhn model only from the point of view of neutrino masses , but not from the point of view of the radiative corrections . nevertheless , there are some circumstances in which the heaviest right - handed neutrino indeed does not contribute to the radiative corrections and does not leave any imprint in @xmath17 , so that this matrix is only determined by the yukawa couplings of the two lightest generations of right - handed neutrinos . if this occurs , the 3rhn model would also be well approximated by a 2rhn model from the point of view of the radiative corrections .",
    "this situation arises for example when the mass of the heaviest right - handed neutrino is very close to the planck mass , although this possibility seems a bit contrived .",
    "a more plausible situation arises in models with gauge mediated supersymmetry breaking @xcite .",
    "so far , we have implicitly assumed that the boundary conditions for the soft breaking terms are set at the planck scale .",
    "however , if the mass of the messenger particles involved in the supersymmetry breaking mechanism is smaller than @xmath124 but larger than @xmath4 , then the heaviest right - handed neutrino would decouple at an energy larger than the energy at which supersymmetry breaking is communicated to the observable sector .",
    "consequently , it would not participate in the radiative corrections of the parameters of the lagrangian .",
    "if this is the case , only the two lightest right - handed neutrinos would contribute to the radiative corrections and to the neutrino mass generation , and therefore the 3rhn model could be well approximated by a 2rhn model .",
    "the experimental signature of this scenario would be a light gravitino , although probably not ultra - light , since the mass of the messenger has to be larger than the mass of the next - to - lightest right - handed neutrino , that is expected to be rather large .",
    "the gravitino mass in these scenarios can be estimated as @xcite @xmath125 where we have assumed vanishing cosmological constant and @xmath126gev is the reduced planck mass . in this formula , @xmath127 measures supersymmetry breaking in the messenger sector , @xmath128 is the mass of the messenger particles and @xmath129 is the typical soft mass scale ( recall that in gauge mediated supersymmetry breaking scenarios gaugino masses are generated at one loop and scalar masses at two loops ) .",
    "if only the heaviest right - handed neutrino decouples from the radiative corrections , it has to happen that @xmath130 .",
    "so , if the gravitino mass is measured , a lower bound on @xmath124 would follow : m_3 m_p . alternatively ,",
    "if @xmath4 can be reconstructed from low energy data , a lower bound on the gravitino mass would follow .",
    "note that the precise determination of @xmath4 requires the knowledge of the cut - off scale , that is not known a priori .",
    "however one could compute @xmath4 assuming that the cut - off is set at the planck scale instead of the actual messenger scale .",
    "then , the value obtained for @xmath4 would be smaller ( see the appendix for details ) and therefore the bound on the gravitino mass obtained in this way would hold , although it would be more conservative than the actual bound .    besides , when supersymmetry breaking is mediated to the observable sector through gauge interactions by particles with a mass smaller than the planck mass , the soft terms are almost proportional to the identity at the cut - off scale .",
    "thus , any flavour changing effect or mass splitting between sleptons or sneutrinos observed at low energies would be entirely due to radiative corrections . on the other hand , cp violating effects could originate in other sectors , such as the neutralino or the chargino sector , although there could be a contribution from @xmath17 that might be disentangled .",
    "finally , if in addition the gravitino is the lightest supersymmetric particle , some interesting cosmological consequences would follow .",
    "for instance , the strong bounds on the reheating temperature , @xmath131gev for @xmath132 @xcite , would be relaxed so that it could be as large as @xmath133gev @xcite .",
    "this has crucial consequences for the leptogenesis mechanism , since the mass of the lightest right - handed could be compatible with the constraints on the reheating temperature from preventing gravitino overproduction @xcite .",
    "the two right - handed neutrino model can explain all the neutrino oscillation experiments , but depends on less parameters than the conventional three right - handed neutrino model .",
    "therefore , the serious problem of the lack of predictivity of the conventional see - saw model is softened . in this paper",
    "we have exploited this observation to argue that the high - energy parameters of the two right - handed neutrino model could be reconstructed using just low energy experiments , provided supersymmetry is discovered and some hypotheses are made about the structure of the soft terms at the cut - off scale .    to this end , we have proposed an alternative parametrization of the two right - handed neutrino model just in terms of low energy observables , namely the neutrino mass matrix and the off - diagonal elements of the matrix @xmath134 , that is responsible for the radiative corrections of the slepton parameters , and that in particular induces rare leptonic decays .",
    "we have discussed the present information available on these parameters and the prospects to improve our knowledge of them in the next few years . except for the case of the majorana phase , we find the prospects very encouraging .    we have presented an exact procedure that allows to reconstruct the high - energy superpotential of the two right - handed neutrino model in terms of the low energy parameters .",
    "we have applied this procedure to a particular scenario with @xmath135 , and we have found that in the case where all the parameters are real and @xmath38 is small , the detection of the rare decays @xmath85 and @xmath86 would be a very important step towards reconstructing the high - energy parameters .",
    "we have also analyzed the impact of the phases in the leptonic mixing matrix on this conclusion , since they could be the worst determined among all the low energy parameters .",
    "we have found that when the angle @xmath38 is large and the phases in the leptonic mixing matrix do not vanish , the connection is more diffuse , although it could still be possible to determine the right - handed masses up to a factor of three .",
    "the reconstruction of the neutrino yukawa coupling is more complicated , since in general would require the measurement of @xmath38 , @xmath40 and @xmath89 .",
    "finally , we have argued that this procedure does not apply only to the strict two right - handed neutrino model .",
    "there are limits of the three right - handed neutrino model that resemble a two right - handed neutrino model to a good approximation , both from the point of view of neutrino masses , as from the point of view of radiative corrections . in these limits ,",
    "the procedure proposed in this paper applies .",
    "i would like to thank alberto casas , and especially sacha davidson for very interesting discussions .",
    "i would also like to thank the cern theory division for hospitality during the last stages of this work .    throughout the paper we have used as parameters to reconstruct the high - energy theory @xmath1 and @xmath16 .",
    "however , to disentangle @xmath17 it is necessary to know not only the cut - off scale but also the decoupling scales , that are not known a priori .",
    "nevertheless , the procedure can be applied recursively in order to reconstruct the high - energy parameters .    in this appendix",
    "it will be shown that this recursive procedure could be avoided using as low energy parameters of the 2rhn model & = & * y*^t_diag(m^-1_1,m^-1_2 ) * y * _",
    "^2 , + p&=&*y*^_diag ( , ) * y * _ , [ appendix1 ] where the second parameter is the combination that appears in the leading - log approximation to the solution of the renormalization group equations , and @xmath136 is the cut - off scale .    defining the new parameters _ & = & diag ( , ) * y * _ , + m_1 & = & m_1 , + m_2 & = & m_2 [ appendix2 ] and substituting in eq.([appendix1 ] ) , one finds that & = & ^t _ diag(m^-1_1,m^-1_2 ) _ h^0_u ^2 , + p&=&^__. therefore , we can apply the general formulas eq.([reconstruction ] ) to solve for the parameters @xmath137 , @xmath138 and @xmath139 . finally , inverting eq.([appendix2 ] )",
    "we can reconstruct the actual high - energy parameters @xmath140 , @xmath141 and @xmath142 . note that there are always two solutions for @xmath3 and @xmath4 , one larger than @xmath143 and the other smaller .    from eq.([appendix2 ] ) it is possible to estimate the impact of our ignorance of the cut - off scale on the reconstructed values of the right - handed masses . from the reconstruction procedure it is always possible to compute @xmath138 and @xmath139 , and from eq.([appendix2 ] ) , the actual masses @xmath3 and @xmath4 , that would depend on the cut - off scale .",
    "if we set the cut - off scale at the planck mass , we would obtain @xmath144 and @xmath145 .",
    "however , it could happen that the actual cut - off scale is smaller than the planck mass , for instance in models with gauge mediated supersymmetry breaking ; in that case we would obtain @xmath146 and @xmath147 . in fig.[fig - appendix ] we compare the values of the masses computed assuming that the cut - off is set at the planck mass or at a different cut - off , for fixed @xmath138 or @xmath139 .",
    "we find that taking as the cut - off the planck mass instead of an intermediate scale underestimates the value of the reconstructed right - handed masses .",
    "nevertheless , the error made is usually smaller than one order of magnitude .",
