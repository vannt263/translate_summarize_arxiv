    "we obtained specimens of spangolite originating from three different locations from two mineral suppliers : blanchard mine , socorro , colorado ( dakota matrix minerals ) , yerrington mine , nevada and fontana rossa , corsica ( both from excaliber mineral corporation ) .",
    "spangolite is described as forming thin plates and has a turqouise colour .",
    "the specimens generally carry more than one copper mineral and the material is often very fine grained . after examining and measuring the susceptibility of various samples we found it best to confine our attention to the blanchard mine specimen which has distinguishable crystallites conforming to the description .",
    "we extracted 19 mg from this specimen and examined every piece ( of which there were about twenty ) to verify that they all had the form and color described above .",
    "the measured susceptibility was consistent with a single phase and a small part of this material was used to confirm the structure by single crystal x - ray diffraction .",
    "the x - ray diffraction measurements were made using a bruker - nonius fr591 rotating anode diffractometer operating with mo k@xmath22 radiation ( @xmath23  ) and equipped with a bruker - nonius roper ccd camera and @xmath24-goniostat driven by collect  @xcite .",
    "the sample was cooled to 120 k using a cryostream ( oxford cryosystems cobra ) .",
    "26343 reflections were measured and combined to give 1308 independent reflections .",
    "the data was processed using the denzo  @xcite software and corrected for absorption using sadabs  @xcite , the @xmath25 factor for combination of reflections was @xmath26% .",
    "the crystal structure was determined using shelxs-97 and refined using shelxl-97",
    "non - hydrogen atoms were refined anisotropically and hydrogen atom positions and thermal parameters were fixed at idealized values riding on those of a parent atom .",
    "a good fit was obtained with final values of @xmath27% and @xmath28% .",
    "susceptibility measurements were made using a quantum design mpms squid magnetometer between 1.8 and 300 k in a field of 1000 g. we measured the low temperature part of the susceptibility at temperatures between 0.05 and 3 k using an ac susceptometer ( from cambridge magnetic refrigeration ) and a dilution refrigerator ( oxford instruments kelvinox 25 ) .",
    "the applied ac field had a frequency of 990 hz and amplitude of 42 mg .",
    "a constant background was subtracted from the data and the resulting inverse susceptibility scaled and offset to overlap with the high temperature data between 2 and 3 k.",

    "spangolite crystallizes in the trigonal space group @xmath31 .",
    "the structure consists of cu@xmath0al(so@xmath1)cl(oh)@xmath2 layers , well separated parallel to the @xmath32-axis by water molecules ( layers occur at @xmath33 with @xmath34  , so are separated by 7.15  ) .",
    "each layer contains a slightly distorted , @xmath35 depleted triangular lattice of metal sites occupied by cu@xmath5 ions , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ spanglatt]a .",
    "the depletion is due to the presence of the al@xmath36 ions , which form a triangular superlattice with a cell @xmath37 bigger than that of the underlying triangular lattice .",
    "we have used single crystal x - ray diffraction to confirm that our material does have this structure .",
    "full details of the unit cell and coordinates are given in the appendix in a form suitable for comparison with those found by hawthorne _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite . in general",
    "our coordinates agree closely ( @xmath38 ) for the copper , sulphur , aluminum and oxygen atoms .",
    "the main differences between the two structures are somewhat shorter lattice parameters in our case , and in the description of the interlayer water and hydrogen atom positions .",
    "previously a split site was found for the oxygen atom of the interlayer water molecules ( o7a and o7b in their work ) , whereas we have a single site approximately at the average of these two positions ( o7 ) .",
    "we have located three of the four hydrogen atoms making up the hydroxide ligands , and two for the interlayer water molecule , whereas ref .",
    "@xcite has four complete hydroxide groups but no hydrogen atoms located on the interlayer water molecules .",
    "our hydrogen atom positions were fixed using a riding model , in which the hydrogen atoms are maintained at idealized positions relative to a parent anion .",
    "similarly , in ref .",
    "@xcite , the hydrogen atoms had to be fixed in chemically reasonable positions to satisfy hydrogen bonding requirements . also in ref .",
    "@xcite evidence of positional disordering of the interlayer water and sulphate groups is discussed , which further increased the problem of hydrogen atom location by x - ray diffraction .",
    "this level of disorder is much reduced in our study . in this context",
    "it is important to note that the original structure determination was performed using data collected at room temperature  @xcite , whereas our data were obtained at 120 k. the consequent reduction in thermal disorder is thought to explain why a split site is not required to describe the position of the oxygen atom ( although the thermal parameter remains larger than those of the other atoms ) and why hydrogen atoms could be located on the interlayer water molecules .",
    "even with this advantage , the position of the final hydrogen atom could not be stabilized in the refinement . despite this",
    ", our final @xmath25 factor is very reasonable ( 4.45 % ) and there can be no doubt that the metal atom positions in our sample are as reported for spangolite .",
    "the slight distortion of the triangular lattice means that the cu@xmath5 ions occupy two sites ( both are @xmath39 sites , which we label cui and cuii ) , forming two sets of pure trimers .",
    "in addition there are two other types of trimer formed by the linking of the pure trimers .",
    "the connectivity of the copper atoms is shown in fig .",
    "[ spanglatt ] , where it can be seen that there are four types of copper trimer in total , with three , two , one or zero cui ( or cuii ) members . at the centre of both the cui and cuii trimers there is a trigonal axis , which ensures that the pure trimers are perfectly equilateral .",
    "as shown in table  [ table1 ] , they have closely similar cu - cu distances . the slight distortion of the layer means that the two families of trimers are displaced vertically with respect to each other by 0.175  .",
    "consequently the linking trimers are not ideal and each contains three distinct types of cu - cu edge .",
    "[ spanglatt ] shows that with uniform antiferromagnetic exchange interactions , the system must be highly frustrated , and it would be a realization of the maple leaf lattice discussed in ref .",
    "however , the above description of the lattice implies that there will be several exchange constants .",
    "the goodenough - kanamori rules  @xcite provide a framework for estimating signs and relative magnitudes of exchange constants .",
    "superexchange interactions between cations , mediated by an anion , will be antiferromagnetic if the subtended angle is 180@xmath40 and ferromagnetic if it is 90@xmath40 .",
    "generally the antiferromagnetic exchange will be stronger , but decreases to zero and becomes ferromagnetic at some critical angle @xmath41 .",
    "we now point out the salient features of the near neighbour exchange paths .",
    "to apply the goodenough - kanamori rule to spangolite , we first need to estimate the crossover angle @xmath41 .",
    "this depends on the coordination of the anions .",
    "the crystallographic structure of part of a cu@xmath0al(so@xmath1)cl(oh)@xmath2 layer is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ spanglatt]b .",
    "it can be seen that both copper and aluminum atoms lie at the center of a distorted octahedron of anions and that these octahedra share edges .",
    "this means that each cu - cu pair has two bridging anions which may be oh@xmath29 , o(so@xmath9)@xmath30 or cl@xmath29 , as tabulated in table  [ table1 ] .",
    "the hydroxide anions bridge two copper atoms and an aluminum atom , with the hydrogen projecting out of the plane of the layer .",
    "the o(so@xmath9)@xmath30 or cl@xmath29 lie on the trigonal axes and bridge three copper atoms in the pure trimers , cui in the case of chloride and cuii in the case of the sulphate group .",
    "the geometry of the bridging atoms is known as @xmath42 and they can be regarded as @xmath43 hybridized  @xcite .",
    "however , the angles around the oxygen atoms indicate that they are quite strongly distorted from the ideal tetrahedral angles of @xmath43 hybridization .",
    "studies of cubanes containing [ cu@xmath1(@xmath44oh)@xmath1 ] involving structure - property correlation and dft calculation have found @xmath41 to be in the range 101 - 105@xmath40  @xcite .",
    "there are five possible exchange interactions which we name @xmath46 ( @xmath47 ) .",
    "the bridging groups or superexchange paths are tabulated in table  [ table1 ] and the corresponding interactions shown in fig .",
    "[ spanglatt ] .",
    "comparison of the bond angles shown in table  [ table1 ] with this value suggests that most cu - cu pairs will have both an antiferromagnetic and a ferromagnetic bridge and that consequently the overall exchange will be weakly antiferromagnetic .",
    "we take the sulphate and chloride ligands to have a similar angular dependence , and in any case both these bridges have angles well below any quoted @xmath41 for superexchange interactions .",
    "just one cu - cu interaction appears likely to be purely ferromagnetic .      in fig .",
    "[ squid]a we show the general features of the magnetic susceptibility .",
    "it is dominated by a broad maximum above a rising component at lower temperature , typical of a spin - dimer system with a curie tail .",
    "the low temperature data have been scaled to overlap with this tail in the 2 - 3 k range by subtracting a constant background , multiplying by a scaling factor and offsetting .",
    "no satisfactory overlap is obtained if the offset is zero ( i.e. the tail can not be treated with a pure curie law ) .",
    "instead , we used the curie - weiss law @xmath48 to fit the inverse susceptibility of the tail to the lowest temperatures measured ( 0.1 k ) .",
    "we extracted the curie - weiss temperature @xmath49 k and curie constant @xmath50 erg g@xmath51 mole@xmath52 k. we obtained the effective magnetic moment from the curie constant as @xmath53 which can be compared with a value for the spin - only magnetic moment of @xmath54 ( since the magnetic moment is obtained from the molar susceptibility of spangolite it is in units of @xmath55 per formula unit ) .",
    "the moment associated with this tail is @xmath56 f.u.@xmath52 implying a population of defective spins of @xmath57 ( assuming they have @xmath6 and @xmath58 ) .",
    "the extrapolated contribution from the tail can be subtracted from the susceptibility to give the intrinsic susceptibility of spangolite .",
    "the result is shown in fig .",
    "[ squid]c , clearly exhibiting a non - magnetic ( i.e. singlet ) state at @xmath59 k. at high temperature the susceptibility follows the curie - weiss law with @xmath60 k and @xmath61 erg g@xmath51 mole@xmath52 k. the moment extracted from the curie constant is @xmath62 f.u.@xmath52 .",
    "this is significantly reduced from the expected value for the spangolite formula unit , which has six @xmath6 and anticipated @xmath63 f.u.@xmath52 .",
    "if the low temperature tail is not subtracted , a slightly larger moment of @xmath64 @xmath65 f.u.@xmath52 can be obtained from the curie constant . in fig .",
    "[ mueff ] we show the effective moment obtained from the susceptibility using the expression @xmath66 .",
    "the moment does not saturate within the temperature range of our experiment but tends to a value of 4.55 @xmath65 f.u.@xmath52 .",
    "a slightly larger value of 4.6 @xmath65 f.u.@xmath52 is obtained if the tail is not subtracted .",
    "k above a minimum at @xmath59 k , below this is an upturn attributed to a curie tail .",
    "b : the inverse susceptibility at low temperature scaled and offset to overlap with the curie tail visible in the raw data . the line is a curie - weiss law which has been fitted to both data sets across the overlapping region ( @xmath49 k and @xmath50 erg g@xmath51 mole@xmath52 k ) .",
    "c : the susceptibility with the extrapolated curie - weiss contribution from the tail subtracted . the line is a curie - weiss law fitted to the data above 100 k ( @xmath60 k and @xmath61 erg g@xmath51 mole@xmath52 k ) . ]",
    "@xmath65 f.u.@xmath52 and the corrected value is 4.55 @xmath65 f.u.@xmath52 . ]",
    "the form of the susceptibility is typical of a system with a singlet groundstate . in view of this",
    ", the most basic hypothesis of the low temperature magnetic behaviour in spangolite would be the formation of non - interacting dimers . in this case",
    ", the high temperature moment would correspond to six @xmath6 .",
    "because of the reduction in moment , the susceptibility is not reproduced by models of one or more non - interacting dimer species ( i.e. the bleaney - bowers equation ) , or derivative models where the dimers interact with a mean field  @xcite . the observed and expected moments ( even including the contribution from the tail ) could imply that approximately half of the copper atoms had been replaced by diamagnetic substituents .",
    "if the moment reduction is due to such a drastic level of random dilution it would seem to make the observation of such a clear transition into a singlet state unlikely .",
    "the dilution would have to be random to preserve the crystal symmetry and so although many singlet pairs might still be formed , a much greater proportion of defective spins and consequent stronger tail would be expected .",
    "the percolation threshold of the maple leaf lattice is 0.579498(3 )  @xcite suggesting that the large scale formation of a single ground state would be disrupted by such strong dilution .",
    "furthermore , it should be visible in the crystal structure determination as a large thermal parameter associated with disorder on the copper sites , but this is not observed .",
    "assuming therefore that the moment reduction is an intrinsic effect , simple explanations could involve the formation of strongly bound clusters .",
    "for example , if the intra - trimer interactions are strong at the temperatures studied , one would observe two effective @xmath6 , with developing interactions between trimers being responsible for the reduction in susceptibility at lower temperature .",
    "higher temperature measurements would then reveal a crossover to another curie - weiss law characteristic of the six @xmath6 of the formula unit .",
    "we have not been able to verify the second part of this situation as the temperature range available to us is limited .",
    "however , the moment we observe is , in fact , too large to agree with the first part ( for two effective @xmath7 per formula unit , we expect @xmath67 but observe @xmath68 ) .    because the susceptibility falls to zero below a broad maximum",
    ", we conclude that the groundstate of spangolite is a type of singlet state .",
    "it is not described by simple models of spin dimers because the high temperature moment is strongly reduced .",
    "this moment reduction does not appear to be due to diamagnetic dilution as the level of dilution required would be expected to produce a much larger population of defective spins and greater level of disorder in the crystal structure than is observed . while the sample is small and of natural origin , every effort has been made to control the quality of the material used and this strong moment reduction therefore appears to be an intrinsic effect , perhaps due to the formation of strongly bound trimers with an additional orbital moment .",
    "we note that spangolite approximates to the @xmath6 model on the maple leaf lattice , a system with no other experimental realization , but that six - sublattice order is currently predicted for such a material .",
    "larger samples of high purity are a prerequisite before further conclusions can be drawn . finally , during the preparation of this manuscript we also became aware of sabelliite , ideally ( cu , zn)@xmath4zn[(as , sb)o@xmath1](oh)@xmath9 , which in principle would offer a single sublattice realization of the maple leaf lattice  @xcite .    tf thanks andrew wills ( ucl ) for discussion , we acknowledge the epsrc , uk for funding of work done in london ( epsrc grant ep / c534654 ) and southampton ( epsrc uk national crystallography service ) , and snf for work done in lausanne .",
