    "one of the most exciting surprises in modern cosmology is the evidence of an acceleration in the cosmic expansion from type ia supernovae @xcite . to explain this result , about @xmath2 of the present cosmological energy density",
    "should be some sort of vacuum energy having a negative equation of state , like a cosmological constant , already considered by a. einstein .",
    "however , the theoretical difficulties due to the too low value of the vacuum energy today with respect to the early universe allow , if not require , the introduction of a more general concept which is now widely known as  dark energy \" .",
    "the first proposal in this sense was made well before the evidence of cosmic acceleration , already in 1988 , by c. wetterich , p. ratra and p.j.e .",
    "peebles @xcite , replacing a cosmological constant into the einstein equations with a dynamical scalar field @xmath3 , also known as  quintessence \" .",
    "even if the system gets obviously more complicated , for general forms of the potential @xmath4 there exist attractor trajectories for the evolution of the background expectation value of @xmath3 .",
    "these trajectories have been proposed to alleviate , at least classically , the fine - tuning required in the early universe , when the typical energy scales were presumably planckian , @xmath5 gev@xmath6 , to generate a vanishing relic vacuum energy as it is observed today , at the level of @xmath7 gev@xmath6 @xcite .",
    "however , these scenarios do not solve the coincidence problem , merely why we are living in the epoch in which dark energy and matter have roughly the same energy density .",
    "even if some attempts to address this issue exist in scalar field dark energy scenarios @xcite , it remains largely a mystery .",
    "+ quintessence models in scalar tensor cosmologies are widely known as  extended quintessence \" scenarios @xcite , where the idea is to connect dark energy to gravity through a non - minimal coupling with the ricci scalar in the fundamental lagrangian",
    ".     corresponds to a cosmological constant ; projection and isw effects are evident for @xmath8 . ]",
    "these models have been explored under different perspectives in literature @xcite , including recent important consequences on the structure formation process @xcite .",
    "possible couplings with the matter sector of the lagrangian have been also studied @xcite .",
    "in addition , intriguing models of dark energy , not based on scalar fields , have been proposed @xcite . + the evidence in favour of dark energy comes , in addition to type ia supernovae , from cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) and large scale structure ( lss ) @xcite .",
    "recently several authors tried to constrain the dark energy equation of state @xmath9 @xcite . even if interesting results can be obtained assuming reasonable values of some parameters @xcite , a true measure of the dark energy equation of state requires the precision of planned experiments like snap @xcite and snfactory @xcite together with observations of lss @xcite and of the cmb with map @xcite and planck @xcite .",
    "+ in section 2 we focus on the role of fluctuations in scalar field dark energy , pointing out that even in the case of a constant background expectation value for the scalar field @xmath3 , fluctuations can still be present and are ultimately the signature of a dynamical component instead of a pure cosmological constant . in section 3 we show interesting results obtained by comparing cmb spectra predicted in tracking minimally coupled quintessence scenarios with available data @xcite .",
    "scalar field dynamics is driven by the klein gordon equation .",
    "it is possible to define a gauge invariant form for the fluctuations in the expectation value of @xmath3 @xcite , which we define as @xmath10 ; the form of the klein gordon equation for this quantities , in fourier space at wavenumber @xmath11 is @xmath12 @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the cosmic scale factor , @xmath15 is the hubble parameter , @xmath16 , @xmath17 are the gauge invariant expressions for the scalar metric fluctuations , @xmath18 and @xmath19 mean derivatives with respect to @xmath3 and conformal time respectively .",
    "the background reduces to a cosmological constant equivalent case when @xmath20 : in this case @xmath21 is a solution of the unperturbed klein gordon equation , reducing eq.([kg ] ) to @xmath22 therefore , even in conditions in which the background expectation value is frozen providing @xmath23 like a cosmological constant , some mechanism in the early universe @xcite and/or some coupling with other fields entering in @xmath24 @xcite could excite fluctuations , providing an unique signature on the nature of dark energy .",
    "+ in addition , it should be noted that if the equation of state is near but different from -1 , as one has if @xmath3 rolls in an almost flat potential , quintessence fluctuations are dragged to be non - zero by fluctuations in the gravitational potential itself , as the following simple argument shows . in absence of anisotropic stress ,",
    "the relation @xmath25 holds , and it is possible to show that in a matter or radiation dominate regimes @xmath16 remain approximately constant @xcite . neglecting the term involving @xmath26 and in the limit of slow expansion the right hand side of eq . ( [ kg ] ) gets constant and the simple solution is @xmath27 which means that metric fluctuations drag the corresponding ones in the scalar field .",
    "the behavior ( [ dragging ] ) has been found rather independent on the details of initial conditions @xcite .",
    "+ the simple arguments exposed in this section clarly show as the investigation of the nature of dark energy can not be reduced to the measure of its equation of state , but deserves a deep understanding of all the possible physical degrees of freedom associated to this component .     and @xmath1 contours in the @xmath28 plane .",
    "cosmological constant is recovered at 2@xmath29.,width=240,height=240 ]",
    "according to the arguments exposed above , even in the case in which observations indicate @xmath23 , this would not be a conclusive evidence in favour of a cosmological constant .",
    "however , the quest for @xmath9 is a well posed problem , with solid theoretical motivations , already addressed by several authors @xcite . due to the large number of cosmological parameters ,",
    "a conclusive statement is likely to be given by the planned and future experiments like snap , snfactory , map , planck , together with the data from redshift surveys . at the present ,",
    "the only possible strategy is to fix some of the cosmological parameters at reasonable values . in @xcite",
    "we assumed flat cosmologies with a fixed hubble constant within the allowed range by the hubble space telescope @xcite .",
    "we allowed variations of baryon abundance , spectral index of scalar fluctuations , cosmological gravitational waves with spectral index and amplitude related by single field inflationary consistency relations ; relaxing this hypotesis in particular can largely affect the results @xcite .",
    "+ we compared the predicted cmb spectra in tracking scalar field cosmologies with the available data ; the effects on the cmb in these scenarios are well known and have high amplitude , resulting mainly in a shift of the acoustic peaks toward small multipoles , as well as an increased integrated sachs wolfe ( isw ) effect on low multipoles as @xmath9 increases from -1 toward larger values , as it is clear from figure [ f1 ] .",
    "+ we found dark energy as the dominant cosmological component @xmath30 , with equation of state @xmath31 ( @xmath32 c.l . ) ; the confidence region is shown in figure [ f2 ] , which also shows how ordinary cosmological constant is recovered at 2@xmath29 .",
    "we argued that this intriguing result is due to a mild evidence of a projection effect in the available cmb data @xcite .",
    "the best fit value of the physical baryon density is in good agreement with the primordial nucleosynthesis bound . also , we find no significant evidence for deviations from scale - invariance , although a scalar spectral index slightly smaller than unity is marginally preferred . finally , we find that the contribution of cosmological gravitational waves is negligible within our hypothesis .",
    "+ in conclusion , within our assumptions we found a mild evidence in favour of a dark energy equation of state larger than -1 .",
    "incoming data and cross - correlation with other unbiased observations can help to further check this intriguing result .",
