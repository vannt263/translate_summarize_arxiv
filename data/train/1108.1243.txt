    "recently , there has been an increasing interest in the casimir effect from both the theoretical and the experimental sides @xcite . before the turn of this century",
    ", the theoretical studies on the exact casimir effect were mostly restricted to simple geometries such as parallel plates , spherical shells and cylindrical shells .",
    "however , these geometric configurations pose a certain degree of difficulty for the experimental verification of the casimir effect , such as the difficulty in achieving parallelism . as a result ,",
    "experimentalists favor other configurations , especially the sphere - plane configuration .",
    "however , in the last century , one has to rely on the proximity force approximation to estimate the casimir force between such configurations , which hampers the determination of the experimental accuracies . to circumvent the problem ,",
    "intensive activities have been carried out to research for theoretical methods to determine the casimir interactions between two or several objects beyond the accuracies afforded by the proximity force approximations . in the last decade , a number of methods have been developed , which include the semi - classical approximation @xcite , the optical path method @xcite , the worldline approach @xcite , the functional determinant or the multiple scattering method @xcite , and the exact mode summation method @xcite . using the multiple scattering method , one can in principle write down a functional for the casimir interaction energy between two or several objects .",
    "nevertheless , it should be mentioned that the mode summation approach can also lead to the same result , although this latter method has only been applied to the configuration of two eccentric cylinders .    in principle , using the various methods mentioned above , one can compute the magnitude of the casimir force numerically .",
    "however , the accuracy is always subjected to the computing capacity of the computer , especially when the separation between the objects is small , which is of more interest for comparison to experiments . on the other hand , to determine the dependence of the casimir force on various parameters of a configuration , one usually has to assume a priori the form of the dependence on the parameters and determine the coefficients that fit best for that particular form .",
    "these coefficients are subjected to numerical errors and it is not easy to justify the accuracy of the results .",
    "therefore there is a call for analytically computing the asymptotic expansion of the casimir force when the separation between the objects is small . for the cylinder - plate and the sphere - plate configurations , the first corrections to the proximity force approximations",
    "have been computed analytically in @xcite .",
    "although the configurations of two cylinders and two spheres are among the popular ones whose exact casimir interaction energies have been derived using the multiple scattering approach or the mode summation method @xcite , analytical studies on the corrections to the proximity force approximations for these configurations are still lacking .",
    "the purpose of this article is to address this problem for the configuration of two cylinders .",
    "the results would be compared to the results for the cylinder - plate configuration which is a special case where the radius of one of the cylinders approaches infinity .    in @xcite ,",
    "some experimental setups have been proposed to measure the casimir interaction force between two eccentric cylinders .",
    "it was argued that the cylindrical configuration has some of the experimental advantages of both the the parallel planes and the sphere - plane configurations .",
    "it can lead to favorable conditions to search for extra - gravitational forces in the micrometer range and for the observation of finite - temperature corrections .",
    "these latter subjects have been explored for the cylinder - plane configuration in @xcite . in view of this",
    ", the cylindrical configuration is becoming increasingly important in the study of the casimir effect .",
    "it is timely to do an analytical study on the strength of the casimir force when the separation between the cylinders is small .    in this article",
    ", we consider the case where one cylinder is inside another , and the case where two cylinders are outside each other .",
    "the functional determinant representations of the exact casimir interaction energies have been derived in several places , such as @xcite for the case of one cylinder inside another , and @xcite for the case of two cylinders exterior to each other . using this formulas",
    ", we compute analytically the first correction to the proximity force approximations . in the case of one cylinder inside another ,",
    "the roles of the two cylinders are not symmetrical .",
    "we explain the computations in detail for this case .",
    "the computations for the case of two cylinders outside each other can be done in the same way and we only present the results .",

    "notice that the radii @xmath4 and @xmath5 are fixed parameters , whereas the distance between the cylinders @xmath0 is a variable .",
    "first , recall that the casimir interaction force per unit area on two parallel plates separated by a distance @xmath12 is given by @xmath13 if the two plates are both imposed with dirichlet boundary conditions or neumann boundary conditions .",
    "if one plate is imposed with dirichlet boundary condition and one plate is imposed with neumann boundary condition , the casimir interaction force density is @xmath14 times of , i.e. , @xmath15 using pfa , we have to integrate the casimir energy density @xmath16 over the area of one of the cylinders , with @xmath12 being the distance from a point of the integrated cylinder to the other cylinder . here",

    "one just has to multiply by @xmath14 which gives @xmath25",
    "the exact casimir interaction energy between two eccentric cylinders has been derived in @xcite using mode summation approach and in @xcite using scattering or functional determinant method .",

    "some numerical results have been discussed in @xcite for the special cases of quasiconcentric cylinders ( where @xmath43 ) , concentric cylinders ( where @xmath44 ) and the limiting case of a cylinder in front of a plane ( where @xmath45 ) . in the following , we will use analytical approach to compute the leading order term and the first order correction term of the casimir interaction energy and the casimir interaction force when @xmath42 .",
