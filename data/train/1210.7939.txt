    "the @xmath5 -meson rare decays and oscillations are known to be a unique source of indirect information about physics at scales of several hundreds gev . in the standard model",
    "all these processes proceed through loop diagrams and thus are relatively suppressed . in the extensions of the standard model the contributions stemming from the diagrams with `` new '' particles in the loops can be comparable or even larger than the contribution from the sm . thus getting experimental information about rare",
    "decays puts strong constraints on the extensions of the sm or , if we are lucky , can lead to a strong disagreement with the sm predictions providing an evidence of some `` new physics '' . to make a rigorous comparison between experiment and theory",
    ", one has to get refined theoretical predictions for the rare decay at hand .",
    "in particular , perturbative qcd corrections through next - to - next - to leading order ( nnlo ) in @xmath6 are needed .",
    "when calculating higher order qcd corrections , along with the calculation of virtual corrections , it is necessary to take into account real emission of gluons and quark - antiquark pairs .",
    "then the phase space integrals contain infrared and collinear singularities , which can be regularized using dimensional regularization scheme .    sometimes however it is more convenient to introduce a small mass as an infrared regulator which can regularize both the soft and collinear divergences .",
    "this can be for instance massive s quark for @xmath7 @xcite and @xmath8 @xcite or massive light quarks for @xmath9 @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "another example is the calculation of cp - asymmetry and width difference-@xmath11 in @xmath12 mixing at nlo and nnlo in @xmath13 , when the calculation gets simplified by the usage of a small gluon mass as an infrared regulator .    in this article",
    "we derive formulae for the @xmath0 @xcite and @xmath1 phase spaces , where the final state particles are massive . following the approach of @xcite for the @xmath0 process",
    "we derive formulae for the phase space in the rest frame of two particles in the final state and obtain a factorized parameterization of the phase - space for the case when all three particles in final state are massive . in case of @xmath1 process we consider similar method , deriving the phase space formula in the rest frame of three particles in the final state . here",
    "we come to the factorized parameterization of phase - space when only one particle in the final state is massive .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we discuss three - particle phase space .",
    "section iii is devoted to the investigation of four - particle phase space . in section",
    "iv we apply our technique to the calculation of master integral connected with the @xmath14 mixing at @xmath4 .",
    "the appendix contains formulae of @xmath0 and @xmath1 integrated phase spaces for some particular cases .",
    "here we consider the three particle decay , when particle with momentum @xmath15 decays into three particles with momenta @xmath16 and masses @xmath17 , @xmath18 ; @xmath19 .",
    "we start from the well - known expression for the differential decay width : @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the squared matrix element , summed and averaged over spins and colors of the particles in the final and initial states respectively and @xmath22 is the mass of decaying particle .    the phase space formula in the rest frame of particles 1 and 3 with momenta @xmath23 and @xmath24 was derived in @xcite : @xmath25 where @xmath26 and `` dimensionless '' momenta @xmath27 , @xmath28 , i=1,2,3 are introduced . in ( [ phasefactorsleptrest ] ) we introduced an additional integration over @xmath29 , @xmath30 ( in the considered frame @xmath31 ) .",
    "now we can integrate over @xmath32 components of @xmath33 and @xmath34 using the spatial parts of two @xmath35-dimensional @xmath36 functions . to carry out the remaining integrations we choose the coordinate axes in a way that particle momenta have the following components : @xmath37 where the dots correspond to the components of extra space dimensions , which are all zero .",
    "making use of the remaining two one - dimensional @xmath36-functions we express @xmath38 and @xmath39 in the following way : @xmath40 where @xmath41 , @xmath18 are dimensionless variables .",
    "after integration over those angles on which @xmath21 does not depend , we obtain a factorized formula for the three massive particles phase space ( unlike @xcite , where the corresponding formula is not factorized ) :    @xmath42    where @xmath43 is the solid angle in @xmath35 dimensions ,    @xmath44    and @xmath45 are 3-momenta expressed by @xmath46 functions .    for the integration limits we have @xmath47    we represent all scalar products via variables @xmath48 and @xmath49 : @xmath50 @xmath51 where @xmath52 and @xmath53 and @xmath54 are defined in ( 2.6 ) .",
    "from the formula ( [ ps3 ] ) for the three - particle phase space one can get a simpler formula assuming that the masses of two particles in the final state are equal to zero : @xmath55 .",
    "in that case we make the replacements : @xmath56 and @xmath57 , where @xmath58 .",

    "a we study the final state mass effects in some interesting phenomenological cases , providing fully integrated analytic formulae for the @xmath0 processes .",
    "now we proceed to the case of four particle decay . for this case one can derive the expression for the phase space in the similar way as in @xcite .",
    "the only difference is that instead of two particle s rest frame introduced in @xcite here the rest frame of three particles is used ( see @xcite ) .",
    "we consider a particle with momentum @xmath15 , which decays into four particles with momenta @xmath62 and masses @xmath17 , @xmath63 and @xmath64 . here",
    "also we introduce `` dimensionless '' momenta @xmath27 , @xmath28 , i=1, ... ,4 . in the rest frame of particles 2 , 3 and 4 with momenta @xmath65 , @xmath24 , @xmath66 ( where @xmath67 ) four - particle phase space can be written in the following way @xmath68 where @xmath69=@xmath70 and @xmath71 is a d - dimensional vector with components @xmath72 in the rest frame of particles 2 , 3 and 4 .",
    "we choose the coordinate axes in such a way , that the particle momenta have the following components : @xmath73 where the dots , as before , correspond to the components of extra space dimensions , which are all zero .",
    "we can immediately integrate over those angles on which none of the scalar products depends and obtain @xmath74 @xmath75 and @xmath76 can be integrated out immediately using the spatial parts of the @xmath36 functions in ( 3.1 ) .",

    "in this section we illustrate how one can use formulae derived in previous sections for calculation of the absorptive part of a @xmath14 mixing at @xmath104 , which contributes to the width differences @xmath105 and the cp - asymmetry .",
    "an example of a diagram that contributes to the @xmath14 mixing at @xmath4 is shown in fig .  1 .",
    "this diagram contains both 3-particle and 4-particle cuts .",
    "the light quark masses we put equal to zero .",
    "we introduce a small mass @xmath106 for a gluon as an infrared regulator . in this way , in the matching one does nt need @xmath107 and @xmath108 parts of nlo and lo wilson coefficients correspondingly .",
    "moreover , in the effective theory side the renormalization is much easier , because the @xmath109 terms appear only as uv singularities and so their cancelation can be tracked easier .",
    "further in order to eliminate ir finite terms coming from the interference of ir @xmath110 with uv structures of @xmath111 a special class of operators @xmath112 has to be introduced in case of dimensional regularization . whereas with introduction of a gluon mass those terms vanish automatically",
