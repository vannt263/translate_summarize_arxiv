    "reaction  diffusion systems ( rds ) have been extensively used in the study of self - organization phenomena in physics , biology , chemistry , ecology etc .",
    "( see , for example @xcite ) .",
    "the main result obtained from these systems is that nonlinear phenomena include diversity of stationary and spatio - temporary dissipative patterns , oscillations , different types of waves , excitability , bistability etc .",
    "the mechanism of the formation of such type of nonlinear phenomena and the conditions of their emergence have been extensively studied during the last couple decades .    in the recent years , there has been a great deal of interest in fractional reaction - diffusion ( frd ) systems @xcite which from one side exhibit self - organization phenomena and from the other side introduce a new parameter to these systems , which is a fractional derivative index , and it gives a great degree of freedom for diversity of self - organization phenomena .    at the same time , analyzing structures in frd systems evolves , both from the point of view of the qualitative analysis and from the computer simulation .",
    "namely these two problems are the goals of our investigation here .",
    "our particular interest is the analysis of the specific non - linear system of frd equations .",
    "we consider a very well - known example of the rds with cubical nonlinearity @xcite which probably is the simplest one used in rd systems modeling @xmath0@xmath1subject to    \\(i ) neumann : @xmath2or    \\(ii ) periodic : @xmath3boundary conditions and with the certain initial condition @xmath4 . here",

[ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     it is easy to see that if the value of @xmath36 , in certain cases , is smaller than @xmath37 , the instability conditions ( @xmath38 )  lead to hopf bifurcation for regular system ( @xmath15 ) @xcite . in this case",

    "formally , at @xmath42 , the instability region in @xmath43  coincides with the interval ( @xmath44 ) where the null isocline @xmath45  has its increasing part .",
    "these results are very widely known in the theory of nonlinear dynamical systems @xcite .    in the fodes the conditions of the instability change ( [ 100 ] ) , and we have to analyze the real and the imaginary part of the existing complex eigenvalues , especially the equation : @xmath46 in fact , with the complex eigenvalues , it is possible to find out the corresponding value of @xmath47 where the condition ( [ 100 ] ) is true .",
    "we will show that this interval is not correlated with the increasing part of the null isocline of the system .",
    "indeed , omitting simple calculation , we can write an equation for marginal values of @xmath43 @xmath48and solution of this quadratic equation gives the domain where the oscillatory instability arises : @xmath49this expression estimates the maximum and minimum values of @xmath50 where the system can be unstable at certain value of @xmath51 as a function of @xmath36 . on the fig .",

    "of course , at @xmath61 the interval in @xmath62 where the instability arises increases but the domain decreases and gets the form of a narrow concave stripe following parabola  @xmath63  for @xmath64    finally , we can conclude that for @xmath65 in contrast to the regular system with integer index @xmath47fractional differential equations can be both stable and unstable .",

    "it is a statement , that fodes are at least as stable as their integer order counterparts @xcite .",
    "it is obvious that this statement is true for @xmath66 only .",

    "they are very sensitive and require small steps of integration , and they often do not allow to find numerical results .",
