    "an important class of quantum heisenberg antiferromagnets consists of the so - called two - dimensional dimerized quantum antiferromagnets .",
    "they can be obtained by placing strongly antiferromagnetically interacting pairs of spins 1/2 ( dimers ) on a regular two - dimensional lattice and assuming weak antiferromagnetic interactions between dimers . among such models",
    "one may mention the @xmath0 model with the staggered arrangement of the strong @xmath1 bonds ( defining dimers and favoring singlet formation on dimers ) on a square lattice@xcite ( see also ref .   for related dimerized square - lattice models ) .",
    "other examples are the bilayer models : they consist of two antiferromagnets in each layer with a dominant nearest - neighbor interlayer coupling which defines dimers.@xcite by considering additional frustrating interlayer couplings the bilayer model can be pushed in the parameter space to a point which admits a rather comprehensive analysis of the energy spectrum.@xcite for this special set of coupling parameters , the frustrated bilayer is a system with local conservation laws ( the square of the total spin of each dimer is a good quantum number ) that explains why it is much easier to examine this specific case . on the other hand",
    ", the frustrated bilayer belongs to the class of so - called localized - magnon spin systems,@xcite which exhibit some prominent features around the saturation field , such as a ground - state magnetization jump at the saturation field , a finite residual entropy at the saturation field , and an unconventional low - temperature thermodynamics , for a review see refs .  .",
    "the singlet state of the dimer is the localized - magnon state which belongs to a completely dispersionless ( flat ) one - magnon band . over the last decade",
    "a large variety of flat - band systems with unconventional physical properties was found , see refs .   and references therein .",
    "for the flat - band systems at hand , the local nature of the one - magnon states allows to construct also localized many - magnon states and to calculate their degeneracy by mapping the problem onto a classical hard - core - object lattice gas ; the case of the frustrated bilayer was discussed in refs .  .",
    "in the strong - field low - temperature regime the independent localized - magnon states are the lowest - energy ones and therefore they dominate the thermodynamics .",
    "the thermodynamic properties in this regime can be efficiently calculated using classical monte carlo simulations for a lattice - gas problem . even in case of small deviations from the ideal flat - band geometry a description which is based on the strong - coupling approach@xcite",
    "can be elaborated.@xcite again the effective theory is much simpler than that for the initial problem .    from the theoretical side ,",
    "frustrated bilayer systems have been studied by several authors .",
    "thus , the frustrated square - lattice bilayer quantum heisenberg antiferromagnet was studied in refs .  , whereas the honeycomb - lattice bilayer with frustration was studied in refs .",
    "( intralayer frustration ) and refs .",
    "( interlayer frustration ) . for the system to be examined in our paper , i.e. , the spin-1/2 antiferromagnetic heisenberg model on a bilayer honeycomb lattice",
    "including interlayer frustration , h.  zhang et al.@xcite have determined the quantum phase diagram at zero magnetic field for a rather general case of an arbitrary relation between the nearest - neighbor intralayer coupling and the frustrating interlayer coupling .",
    "another recent study reported in ref .",
    "concerns the antiferromagnetic classical heisenberg model on a bilayer honeycomb lattice in a highly frustrated regime in the presence of a magnetic field .",
    "its main result is the phase diagram of the model in the plane `` magnetic field ",
    "temperature '' .",
    "however , this analysis can not contain any hallmarks caused by the localized magnons , since localized - magnon features represent a pure quantum effect which disappears in the classical limit .    from the experimental side , one may mention several layered materials , which can be viewed as frustrated bilayer quantum heisenberg antiferromagnets .",
    "thus , the compound ba@xmath2cosi@xmath2o@xmath3cl@xmath2 could be described as a two - dimensionally antiferromagnetically coupled spin-1/2 @xmath4-like spin dimer system in which co@xmath5 sites form the frustrated square - lattice bilayer.@xcite the interest in the frustrated honeycomb - lattice bilayers stems from experiments on bi@xmath6mn@xmath7o@xmath8(no@xmath6).@xcite in this compound , the ions mn@xmath9 form a frustrated spin-@xmath10 bilayer honeycomb lattice.@xcite finally , let us mention that a bilayer honeycomb lattice can be realized using ultracold atoms.@xcite    the present study has several goals .",
    "motivated by the recent paper of h.  zhang et al.,@xcite we wish to extend it to the case of nonzero magnetic field .",
    "on the other hand , with our study we complement the analysis of the classical case@xcite to the pure quantum case of @xmath11 .",
    "finally , the present study can be viewed as an extension of our previous calculations@xcite to the honeycomb - lattice geometry . although we do not intend to provide a theoretical description of bi@xmath6mn@xmath7o@xmath8(no@xmath6 ) , our results may be relevant for the discussion of the localized - magnon effects in this and in similar materials .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows .",
    "section  [ sec2 ] contains the spectroscopic study of the frustrated honeycomb - lattice bilayer spin-1/2 heisenberg antiferromagnet : by exact diagonalization for finite quantum systems and direct calculations for finite hard - core lattice - gas systems we show the correspondence between the ground states in the large-@xmath12 subspaces and the spatial configurations of hard hexagons on an auxiliary honeycomb lattice .",
    "based on the established correspondence , in section  [ sec3 ] we report results of classical monte carlo simulations for hard hexagons on the honeycomb lattice and use them to predict the properties of the frustrated honeycomb - lattice bilayer spin-1/2 heisenberg antiferromagnet in the strong - field low - temperature regime . the most intriguing outcome is an order - disorder phase transition which is expected at low temperatures just below the saturation field .",
    "this transition is related to the ordering of the localized magnons on the two - sublattice honeycomb lattice as the density of the localized magnons increases .",
    "section  [ sec4 ] deals with some generalization of the independent localized - magnon picture : we show how to take into account the contribution of a low - lying set of other localized states as well as discuss the effect of deviations from the ideal frustration case .",

    "[ f08 ] , the magnetization jumps survive even for moderate deviations from the ideal frustration case .",

    "( [ 405 ] ) the effective easy - axis @xmath169 model becomes isotropic for @xmath197 , i.e. , the spin - flop transition disappears as increasing the deviation from the ideal frustration case @xmath198 . although , we are not aware of previous studies of the spin - flop transition for the honeycomb - lattice spin-1/2 @xmath169 model ( and such a study is beyond the scope of the present paper ) , we may mention here that the square - lattice case was examined in ref .  .",
    "in particular , one may find there the dependences of the height of the magnetization jump and of the transition field on the anisotropy .",
    "furthermore , for temperature effects , see ref .  .",
    "supposing , that for the honeycomb - lattice case the same scenario as for the square - lattice case is valid , we may expect that the spin - flop like transition in our model only disappears at the isotropic point @xmath197 .",
    "our quantum monte carlo data shown in the inset of fig .  [ f08 ] support this conclusion .",
    "let us complete this section with a general remark on effective models around the ideal flat - band geometry ( the ideal frustration case ) .",
    "recalling the findings of ref .  , where several localized - magnon systems including the square - kagome model were examined , we conclude that the effective model around the ideal flat - band geometry essentially depends on the universality class of the localized - magnon system .",
    "( for a comprehensive discussion of the various universality classes of localized - magnon systems , see ref .  .",
    ") while for the square - kagome model falling into the monomer universality class we obtained the ( pseudo)spin-1/2 @xmath169 models with easy - plane anisotropy,@xcite for the considered frustrated honeycomb - lattice bilayer model , which belongs to a hard - hexagon universality class , we get the ( pseudo)spin-1/2 @xmath169 models with easy - axis anisotropy .",
    "clearly , the magnitude of the ising terms in the effective hamiltonian are related to the specific hard - core rules .",
    "in this paper we examine the low - temperature properties of the frustrated honeycomb - lattice bilayer spin-1/2 heisenberg antiferromagnet in a magnetic field . for the considered model , when the system has local conservation laws , it is possible to construct a subset of @xmath155 eigenstates ( @xmath199 ) of the hamiltonian and to calculate their contribution to thermodynamics . for sufficiently strong interlayer coupling , these states are low - energy ones for strong and intermediate fields and therefore they dominate the thermodynamic properties .",
    "the most interesting features of the studied frustrated quantum spin model are : the magnetization jumps as well as wide plateaus , the residual ground - state entropy , the extra low - temperature peak in the temperature dependence of the specific heat around the saturation , and the finite - temperature order - disorder phase transition of the two - dimensional ising - model universality class .",
    "the phase transition occurs just below the saturation field @xmath200 .",
    "however , for large enough @xmath52 , there is a line of phase transitions which occur below @xmath141\\approx 0.380 $ ] for @xmath76 in the region between @xmath69 and @xmath47",
    ". finally , for deviations from the ideal frustration case we observe for the isotropic heisenberg model at hand magnetization jumps which can be understood as spin - flop like transitions",
    ".    there might be some relevance of our study for the magnetic compound bi@xmath6mn@xmath7o@xmath8(no@xmath6 ) .",
    "the most intriguing question is : can the phase diagram from fig .",
    "[ f07 ] be observed experimentally ?",
    "first , the exchange couplings for bi@xmath6mn@xmath7o@xmath8(no@xmath6 ) are still under debate@xcite but the relation @xmath201 looks plausible . in this case",
    "the flat band is not the lowest - energy one , see eq .",
    "( [ 202 ] ) .",
    "second , the spin value is @xmath202 for this compound ( each mn@xmath9 ion carries a spin @xmath202 ) and the localized - magnon effects are less pronounced in comparison with the @xmath11 case .",
    "for example , the magnitude ground - state magnetization jump at the saturation is still @xmath40 , but this magnitude is only 1/6 of the saturation value ( in contrast to 1/2 of the saturation value for the @xmath11 case ) .",
    "thus , further studies on this compound are needed to clarify the relation to the localized - magnon scenario presented in our paper .",
