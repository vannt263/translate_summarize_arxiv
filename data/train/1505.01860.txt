    "measuring the proton - air inelastic cross section @xmath0 from cosmic rays at ultra high energies allows us to achieve knowledge of a fundamental particle property that we are unable to attain with measurements at current accelerators . at the time of writing of this paper",
    "the highest proton - proton center of mass energy that could be attained by the modern accelerators is @xmath5  tev by the large hadron collider ( lhc ) .",
    "however , ultra high energy cosmic ray ( uhecr ) experiments have been reporting on the proton - air inelastic cross section starting with the fly s eye in 1984 at @xmath6  tev  @xcite and ending with the most recent result of the auger experiment at @xmath7  tev in 2012  @xcite .",
    "the current high energy models agree in their predictions of rising proton - air cross section with energy .",
    "the high energy models are in reasonable agreement at lower energies , below @xmath8 ev , where they are tuned to measurements of multi - particle production provided by particle accelerators .",
    "however the high energy models diverge in describing fundamental parameters such as hadronic cross sections , elasticity , and secondary particle multiplicity above 1  pev where the models rely solely on theoretical expectations  @xcite . studying the energy dependence of the proton - air cross section is important in constraining the extrapolation of the hadronic models to high energy .",
    "detecting uhecr showers provides the opportunity to study fundamental particle properties .",
    "optimally , to measure the @xmath0 directly , we observe the first point of the proton - air interaction slant depth @xmath9 and fit the distribution of @xmath9 to recover the interaction length @xmath10 .",
    "however , since the observation of the first point of interaction to obtain the nucleon - air cross section is not feasible , the inelastic proton - air cross section is calculated using the distribution of the observed shower maximum @xmath11 .",
    "@xmath10 and consequently @xmath0 , are derived from the @xmath11 distribution s exponential tail .    in this work",
    ", we report on the measurement of the proton - air inelastic cross section @xmath0 using the telescope array s middle drum detector together with the surface array detector ( md - sd ) in hybrid mode data  @xcite .",
    "the method used in this calculation is `` the @xmath12-factor method '' , were the underlying assumption is a proportionality between the tail of the @xmath11 distribution and @xmath9 .",
    "details of the method , the result , and the systematics of the measurement are presented in this work .",
    "in addition , the telescope array proton - air inelastic cross section is compared to previous results .",
    "furthermore , the proton - proton cross section @xmath1 is calculated using glauber theory together with the block , halzen , and stanev ( bhs ) qcd - inspired fit (  @xcite ,  @xcite ,  @xcite ,  @xcite ) .",
    "the proton - proton cross section is also compared to previous @xmath13 experimental results .",
    "finally , we discuss the summary and the outlook .",
    "the data used in this analysis is collected by the telescope array ( ta ) detector located in the southwestern desert of the state of utah .",
    "ta is an uhecr detector composed of three fluorescence detector ( fd ) sites and the surface detector array ( sd )  @xcite as shown in figure  [ fig : scheme ] .",
    "the sd array occupying @xmath14 and is bounded by the fds .",
    "the northernmost fluorescence detector is referred to as middle drum ( md ) , while the other two southern fds are named black rock mesa ( brm ) and long ridge ( lr )  @xcite . moreover , a central laser facility ( clf ) to monitor the atmosphere and calibrate the detector is deployed in the middle of the detector and is located equidistant from the three fds .",
    "the two southernmost detectors , lr and brm , consist of 12 telescopes each , while the md detector separated from the northern edge of the sd by 10  km consists of 14 telescopes each of which uses a 5.1  m@xmath15 spherical mirror .",
    "the fluorescence light from each mirror is collected to a camera containing 256 photo multiplier tubes ( pmts ) tightly spaced .",
    "seven of the 14 mirrors view 3@xmath16- 17@xmath16 in elevation while the rest view 17@xmath16- 31@xmath16 , with a total azimuth of 112@xmath16 between southwest and southeast . on the other hand ,",
    "the sd is composed of 507 scintillation counters each 3  m@xmath15 in area .",
    "the sd scintillation counters are spaced on a 1.2  km grid .",
    "the data used in this analysis consists of md - sd hybrid events .",
    "the md and sd trigger independently .",
    "offline , a hybrid data set is formed by time - matching the events from the two detectors . in the monocular mode ,",
    "an event trigger is recorded by the sd when three adjacent sds observe a signal greater than 3 minimum ionizing particles ( mips ) within @xmath17s . when a trigger occurs the signals from all the sds within @xmath18s with amplitude greater than 0.3 mip",
    "are also recorded . moreover ,",
    "a telescope event trigger for the md is recorded when two subclusters of the 256 pmt cluster triggered within @xmath19s . here a subcluster is defined as a ( @xmath20 ) 16 pmts within the 256 pmt cluster .",
    "each subcluster reports a trigger when three tubes in that subcluster trigger within @xmath19s , two of which are adjacent .",
    "finally , multiple telescope event triggers within @xmath21s would be combined into a single md event .",
    "events detected by both detectors ( md and sd ) within @xmath22s are combined into one hybrid event .",
    "the combined data set with md and sd time matched events are then reprocessed using information from both detectors .",
    "the fd overlooking the sky above the sd array provides the longitudinal profile of the shower .",
    "meanwhile , the sd provides the event shower core , particle density , and hence improves the geometrical reconstruction significantly .",
    "reference  @xcite describes the detector monocular and hybrid reconstructions of the triggered events in more detail .    to achieve the best @xmath11 resolution , a pattern recognition technique was applied which selected events with a well - defined peak in the fluorescence light profile",
    "this technique is described more completely in reference  @xcite .",
    "briefly , each shower profile s shape was approximated by a set of right triangles , and a set of cuts on the properties of these triangles was used to reject @xmath11 events with a `` flat '' profile or an indistinct peak .",
    "as shown in reference  @xcite , data to monte carlo comparison studies showed good agreement in basic air shower distributions such as zenith angle , azimuthal angle , and impact parameter after these pattern recognition cuts were applied .",
    "the data used in this analysis is the md - sd hybrid events collected between may-2008 and may-2013 . after applying the pattern recognition cuts to the data we are left with 439 events .",
    "the energy range for this data set is between @xmath23 and @xmath24 ev . with an average energy of @xmath25 ev ,",
    "this is equivalent to a center of mass energy of @xmath26  tev .",
    "finally , the @xmath11 resolution of this data set achieved after applying the pattern recognition cuts is @xmath27  g / cm@xmath15  @xcite .",
    "in this paper we determine the value of @xmath0 using the @xmath12-factor method .",
    "this method infers the attenuation length and hence the cross section value from the exponential tail of the @xmath11 distribution .",
    "this is assuming that the tail of the @xmath11 distribution is comprised of the most penetrating / lighter particles ( protons ) .",
    "the tail of the @xmath11 distribution is fit to the exponential @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the attenuation length .",
    "@xmath30 is proportional to the interaction length @xmath10 : @xmath31 where @xmath12 is dependent on the shower evolution model .",
    "the departure of @xmath12 from unity depends on the pion inelastic cross section and on the inclusive proton and pion cross sections with the light nuclear atmospheric target  @xcite .    in order to determine @xmath12 to derive the interaction length @xmath10 from the slope of @xmath11 distribution @xmath30",
    ", we carried out simulation studies using the one - dimensional air shower monte carlo program conex4.37 (  @xcite ,  @xcite ,  @xcite ) .",
    "the conex program uses a hybrid air shower calculation for the high energy part of the shower , and a numerical solution of the cascade equations for the low energy part of the shower .",
    "this hybrid approach of simulating the cosmic ray showers enables conex to be very efficient .",
    "using conex allows us to simulate large number of showers in a very reasonable time scale .",
    "it is worth noting that the shower parameters obtained with conex are consistent with that obtained with coriska  @xcite .    using conex the value of @xmath12",
    "is determined by simulating 10,000 events for each of several energy bins for data between @xmath23 and @xmath24 ev .",
    "the value of @xmath12 is calculated for each high energy model for each energy bin by obtaining the values of @xmath32 and @xmath10 for that model .",
    "the value of @xmath32 and therefore @xmath12 for each of the data sets is impacted by the choice of the lower edge of the fit range @xmath33 .",
    "this dependence is shown in figure  [ fig : kvalfp ] .",
    "it is essential that a consistent procedure be used to determine the @xmath33 and consequently the value of @xmath12 for the shower simulations and the observed data .",
    "we find from the data that @xmath34  g / cm@xmath15 is the minimum stable value of @xmath33 , maximizing the number of events in the tail of the distribution and consequently the statistical power of the measurement .",
    "the same relative shift distribution is later used in the simulations .",
    "it is also important to note that in addition to conex we have also used corsika  @xcite .",
    "corsika is used here to simulate three - dimensional cosmic ray showers . in the simulation process",
    "these showers are thinned in order to reduce the cpu time , and then dethinned in an attempt to restore lost information  @xcite .",
    "these showers are then propagated through the fd and the sd part of the ta detector .",
    "the showers that successfully pass the trigger of the detector are then reconstructed , after which the pattern recognition event selection are applied .",
    "the value of @xmath30 is then determined and , as shown in figure  [ fig : concor ] , is found to be consistent with that obtained with conex ( shower simulation not propagated through the detector ) particularly around the selected choice of @xmath34  g / cm@xmath15 .",
    "this effect will also be discussed in section  [ sec : sys ] .",
    "the value of @xmath12 is calculated for each simulated data set between the energies of @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "figure  [ fig : kvallge ] shows @xmath12 vs. log@xmath35(e(ev ) ) .",
    "note that we have chosen to display qgsjetii.4 as an example .",
    "the value of @xmath12 is then established by fitting the points from figure  [ fig : kvallge ] to a constant .",
    "table  [ tab : kval ] summarizes the high energy models used , the value of @xmath12 obtained for these models .",
    "it is also worth mentioning that the k value was also calculated with qgsjetii.3 and was obtained from this model to be consistent with that determined from qgsjetii.4 within the statistical fluctuations .",
    "note that the stability of @xmath12 around the average shown in figure  [ fig : kvallge ] shows that @xmath12 is independent of energy and justifies the use of a single average value over the range of interest .    to confirm that the value of @xmath12 obtained is valid to reproduce the interaction length of the model , a plot of @xmath10 vs. log@xmath35(e(ev ) ) is shown in figure  [ fig : lamlge ] .",
    "each point here represents 10,000 simulated data sets at that energy .",
    "the circle markers are the @xmath10 obtained from the @xmath9 distributions from the model , while the triangle markers are the @xmath10 obtained from reconstruction using the @xmath12-factor method .",
    "figure  [ fig : lamlge ] shows that using the @xmath12-factor method does indeed reconstruct the expected values of the @xmath36 for these simulations .",
    "this ensures that the value of @xmath12 obtained in this study describe the value of @xmath12 of the high energy models correctly .",
    "the @xmath12-factor determined in the procedure described above is dependent on the hadronic interaction model used in the air shower monte carlo simulation .",
