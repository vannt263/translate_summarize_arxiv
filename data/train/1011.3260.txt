    "interstellar water is of continuing interest because of the role water plays in the oxygen chemistry within dense molecular clouds as well as the efforts to trace its abundance and distribution in all phases of cloud evolution through to planet formation .",
    "thanks to a number of space - based observatories operated during the past 15 years , good progress has been made detecting and mapping the distribution of water toward molecular clouds .",
    "the highest water abundances , and the strongest water emission , are observed toward warm ( i.e. , @xmath8300  k ) gas regions , most frequently associated with shock - heated gas generated by high - velocity outflows from young stellar objects and supernovae remnants .",
    "this finding is in agreement both with predictions that neutral - neutral reactions ( i.e. , h@xmath0 + o @xmath9 oh + h and h@xmath0 + oh @xmath9 h@xmath0o + h ) dominate at these temperatures and are relatively efficient at producing water ( cf .",

    "vapor plus ice  lies within the cooler ( @xmath1440  k ) and more massive quiescent gas component .",
    "knowledge of the depth - dependent abundance of water vapor and water ice in molecular clouds is important for at least two reasons .",
    "first , the depth - dependent abundance of water vapor and water ice reflects a competition among a number of important processes , such as photodissociation , photodesorption , gas - phase reactions , gas - grain reactions , and grain - surface reactions , most of which depend upon the gas density and far - ultraviolet flux ( fuv ; 6 ev@xmath1513.6 ev ) . a better understanding of these processes and their relative importance thus reduces the uncertainty in virtually all models of the chemical composition of molecular clouds . second , because oxygen is the most abundant element after hydrogen and helium , the processes that control the amount of oxygen locked in water vapor and , in particular , water ice determine the amount of residual oxygen free to react with other species . in this way , the predicted abundance of a host of species that depend on the gas - phase oxygen - to - carbon or oxygen - to - nitrogen ratio , for example , hinges on knowledge of the main reservoirs of oxygen , such as gas - phase water and water - ice .",

    "can be approached in two ways .",
    "first , by assuming the c@xmath7o  emission is optically thin and the background radiation terms can be ignored , it is possible to derive a simple analytical relation between the column density in the upper @xmath801 state of the transition and the integrated intensity of the line ( in k km s@xmath43 ) , corrected by main - beam efficiency ( @xmath280.5 for fcrao at the c@xmath7oline frequency ) :    @xmath81    where @xmath82 is the radiation temperature ( @xmath83main - beam efficiency ) .    using a standard partition function , this gives the following expression for the total c@xmath7o  column density :      where @xmath65 is the gas temperature .",
    "second , using the lvg approximation , assuming an h@xmath0  density of 10@xmath85  @xmath13 , and including all of the background radiation terms , we compute the c@xmath7o   integrated intensity for a range of column densities and temperatures . fitting these data ,",
    "we obtain the relation :    @xmath86    this expression is accurate for temperatures between 15 and 100  k and column densities where the emission is optically thin . as shown in fig .",
    "9 , the two expressions are in good agreement , particularly over the range of temperatures most applicable to the orion ridge  i.e. , 20@xmath3@xmath340  k ( cf .  ungerechts  et@xmath3al .",

    "pca s goal is to find , among linear combinations of the data variables , a sequence of orthogonal , or completely uncorrelated , factors that most efficiently explain the differences in the data .",
    "details of this method are provided elsewhere ( cf .",

    "the components themselves are merely weighted linear combinations of the original variables such that pc@xmath351 accounts for the maximum variance in the data of any possible linear combination , pc@xmath352 accounts for the maximum amount of variance not explained by pc@xmath351 and that it is orthogonal to pc@xmath351 , and so on . even though use of all @xmath116 pc s permits the full reconstruction of the original data , in many cases the first few pc s are sufficient to capture most of the variance in the data .",
    "thus , we can express each observed map ( to within the noise ) as a different linear combination of just two or three maps ( i.e. two or three principal components ) .    to ensure that the analysis gives equal weighting to each line  versus allowing the brightest lines to dominate the analysis ",
    "the integrated intensities for each spectral line have been mean subtracted and divided by the standard deviation .",
    "in addition , to reduce the variance due to excitation and varying line emissivity , only those transitions with a critical density greater than 10@xmath117  @xmath13  ( see table  1 ) are included in the pca .",
    "the results are shown in fig .  13 .",
    "the interpretation of these results is straightforward .",
    "the top panel in fig .",
    "13 plots the fraction of the total variance in the data captured by each principal component . for the data considered here ,",
    "90% of the total variance between species is accounted for with principal components one and two , and 96% of the total variance is accounted for with the addition of principal component three .",
    "the lower two panels in fig .",
    "13 plot the coefficients for the first and second , and second and third , principal components , respectively .",
    "because almost all of the variation in the data is in principal components one and two , the bottom left panel is most relevant .",
    "there are two key elements in the plot to note : ( 1 ) the degree to which each vector approaches the unit circle ; and , ( 2 ) the clustering of vectors . because the principal components are normalized such that the quadrature sum of the coefficients for each species is unity , the proximity of the points to the circle of unit radius is a measure of the degree to which any two principal components account for the total variance in this sample .",
    "consequently , the closeness of all the points to the unit circle in the lower left panel is a reflection of the fact that these two principal components contain almost all of the variance in the data , as noted above .",
    "the degree of clustering of the vectors is a measure of their correlation .",
    "as noted by neufeld  et@xmath3al .",
    "( 2007 ) , in the limit where two points actually lie on the unit circle , the cosine of the angle between these points is their linear correlation .",
    "thus , points that coincide on the unit circle ( i.e. , @xmath1180@xmath119 ) would indicate perfectly correlated data , whereas points on opposite sides of the circle ( i.e. , @xmath118180@xmath119 ) would indicate perfectly anticorrelated data .",
    "thus , the plot of pc1 versus pc2 quantifies what appears evident in figs .",
    "11 and 12 , namely that the ground - state ortho - h@xmath0o  emission is well correlated with the cn , hcn , and c@xmath0h emission .",
    "the h@xmath0o  emission is also well correlated with the @xmath1co  @xmath3954 emission .",
    "since the upper level of this @xmath1co  transition is 79@xmath35k above the ground state , it too is expected to trace the warmer surface layers of the ridge .",
    "the vectors representing h@xmath0oand n@xmath0h@xmath4 in this plot show the greatest separation , suggesting no particular correlation exists between the lines of sight where the h@xmath0o  and n@xmath0h@xmath4 integrated intensities are strong .",
    "the bottom right panel in fig .  13 , i.e. , pc2 versus pc3 , shows the distribution of residual variance between the species .",
    "the short vectors ( from the 0,0 point ) illustrate quantitatively the relative unimportance of additional sources of variance between species beyond those captured in the first two principal components .",
    "the distribution of water vapor within a molecular cloud depends upon both the gas - phase chemistry that forms h@xmath0o  and a number of important micro - physics processes .",
    "these processes include the rate at which oxygen atoms strike dust grains and combine with hydrogen on their surfaces to form oh and h@xmath0o , the rate at which such h@xmath0o   is removed from grain surfaces by incident uv photons ( i.e. , photodesorption ) and cosmic rays , and the rate at which gas - phase h@xmath0o  is destroyed by uv photons ( i.e. , photodissociation ) . because these processes are operative in all quiescent molecular clouds to varying degrees , testing models that incorporate the necessary",

    "consequently , in the optically thin limit , the integrated intensity increases linearly with increasing h@xmath0  column and volume densities , even if the line center optical depth is large .",

    "regrettably , this is impossible with the face - on appearance of the orion ridge and attempts to do so indirectly  for example , by modeling the emission from each of the 77 lines of sight considered here  are complicated by often unknown variations in the physical conditions along the ridge , including the varying incident fuv flux . instead , we seek to extract the desired information from the ensemble of data , such as whether the water - vapor emission correlates better with surface tracers ( i.e. , species whose depth of peak abundance is relatively small and located near the cloud surface ) , or volume tracers ( i.e. , species whose abundance increases and attains a near - constant maximum with depth into the cloud ) .",

    "the temperature and chemical structure of a cloud are determined not only by the gas - phase chemistry , but also by the freezing of species onto grains , simple grain surface chemistry , and desorption ( including fuv photodesorption ) of ices .",
    "the resulting gas - phase h@xmath0o  abundance is found to peak in a region between the cloud surface , where h@xmath0o  is photo - destroyed by fuv photons , and the deeper interior , where the fuv field is highly attenuated and gas - phase h@xmath0o  depletes rapidly onto grains as frozen water - ice ( see fig .",
    "18 ) . because the sublimation temperature of water - ice is high ( i.e. , @xmath15190@xmath35k )",
    ", it remains on the grains until sputtered off by the passage of a nondissociative shock , heated by an embedded source , photodesorbed by fuv radiation , or removed by cosmic rays .",
    "specifically , this model predicts that the gas - phase h@xmath0o  and o@xmath0   lies predominantly between an _",
    "a_@xmath5  of approximately 3 and 8 for @xmath128@xmath1521@xmath3@xmath310@xmath12 , with the peak abundance occurring at a depth proportional to ln@xmath3(@xmath153 ) , where @xmath154 is the gas - phase hydrogen nucleus number density . as shown in the right panel of fig .",

    "finally , we note that the observed c@xmath0h and n@xmath0h@xmath4 transitions have similar excitation energies and critical densities ( see table  1 ) , yet show strikingly different depth profiles ( e.g. , figs .  11 and 12 ) .",
    "thus , the variations in their depth - dependent integrated intensity profiles are not the result of excitation conditions",
    ".    limits to the assumption of a simple homogeneous slab geometry , illuminated from one side , are also seen in the data .",
    "specifically the intensity ratios for species such as ci , cn , hcn , and c@xmath0h exhibit values at high _",

    "this is most likely the result of the orion ridge being somewhat clumpy ( cf .",
    "stacey  et@xmath3al .",
    "1993 , and references therein ) , permitting partial penetration of fuv photons deep into the cloud interior .",
    "in addition , b stars embedded within the molecular cloud may provide additional fuv flux .",
    "thus , emission characteristic of predominately surface tracers can still be generated , albeit at a lower intensity , well within the cloud interior .",
    "in addition , if the effects of h@xmath0o  freeze - out are added to the models shown in figs .  15 and 16 , the deep - cloud abundance of ci , cn , hcn , and c@xmath0h may be altered .",
    "this effect notwithstanding , the derived emission profiles for these species follow the trends predicted from pdr models , at least up to the depth where h@xmath0o  freezes out .",
    "the conclusion that ground - state water - vapor emission is observed to arise primarily near molecular cloud surfaces is in accord with models , like hollenbach  et@xmath3al .",
    "( 2009 ) , in which the gas - phase water abundance peaks where rates of photodestruction , photodesorption , and freeze - out balance . in this model ,",
    "the distance from the cloud surface to the peak water - vapor abundance scales as ln@xmath3(@xmath153 ) and the range of depths over which the water vapor is relatively abundant is self regulating and remains approximately constant .",
    "consequently , the water - vapor column density remains approximately constant over a broad range of fuv fluxes and densities , thus explaining the relatively narrow distribution of observed h@xmath0o  1@xmath551@xmath50 peak antenna temperatures .",
    "this picture is also consistent with the low observed upper limits to the o@xmath0abundance ( goldsmith  et@xmath3al .",
    "since the ion - neutral reactions leading to the formation of o@xmath0  depend upon the abundance of gas - phase o ( via the reaction o @xmath138 oh @xmath9 o@xmath0@xmath138 h ) , reducing the atomic oxygen abundance by locking it in water ice suppresses o@xmath0  production where water ice becomes abundant ",
    "i.e. , beyond an _ a_@xmath5  of @xmath282 to 10 .",
    "thus , like water vapor , gas - phase o@xmath0   is restricted to a relatively narrow zone between where it s photodestroyed near the cloud surface and where its formation is suppressed by a diminishing supply of atomic oxygen .",
    "detailed calculations ( e.g. , hollenbach  et@xmath3al .  2009 ) indicate that the resulting o@xmath0  column densities are typically between 10@xmath93 and 10@xmath156@xmath91 , consistent with current observed limits .",
    "finally , evidence supporting an increasing column density of water - ice with depth is provided by observations of the water - ice band at 3@xmath127 m  toward taurus ( whittet  et@xmath3al .",
    "2001 ) and rho ophiuchus ( tanaka  et@xmath3al .",
    "1990 ) , and the water - ice band at 6@xmath127 m  toward cepheus a east ( sonnentrucker  et@xmath3al .",
    "the onset for water - ice formation toward taurus , rho ophiuchus , and cepheus a east is determined to occur at _",
    "a_@xmath5 s of 3.2 , @xmath2810 , and 2.3 visual magnitudes , respectively , with the variation due primarily to the different fuv radiation environments for each cloud .",
    "these observations also confirm the presence of significant amounts of water - ice ( _ x_(h@xmath0o  ice)@xmath1575@xmath3010@xmath141 ) in the deep interior of dense clouds ( e.g. , nummelin  et@xmath3al .",

    "2008 ) further attests to the importance of ices as a repository of oxygen that would otherwise be available to form gas - phase h@xmath0o  and o@xmath0 .    in summary ,",
    "the results of the observational study presented here show that most of the water vapor detected toward the orion molecular cloud ridge originates near the cloud surface , between an _",
    "a_@xmath5  of about 2 and 10 .",
    "this finding is in general agreement with pdr models that consider the effects of photodissociation , grain - surface chemistry , photodesorption , and freeze - out in addition to gas - phase chemistry .",

    "second , access to additional ortho- and para - h@xmath0o  transitions will enable a more direct determination of the physical conditions in the water - vapor emitting region .",
