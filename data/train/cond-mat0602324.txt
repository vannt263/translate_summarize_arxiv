    "time - dependent density - functional theory ( tddft ) has gained considerable popularity as a practical approach to the dynamics of many - electron systems.@xcite the essential idea of tddft is to describe @xmath3 interacting electrons moving in an external potential @xmath4 in terms of an auxiliary non - interacting system governed by the time - dependent kohn - sham ( tdks ) equation , @xmath5\\varphi_\\alpha({{\\bf r},t})=0\\ ] ] ( we use atomic units @xmath6 throughout ) . here and in the following , we consider systems whose ground state and dynamical response are everywhere nonmagnetic , and we may therefore ignore the spin degree of freedom .",

    "( [ tdks ] ) , @xmath9 is the time - dependent hartree potential , and @xmath0 is the exchange - correlation ( xc ) potential . in practice ,",
    "suitable approximations for @xmath10 are required .",
    "we assume in the following that the system evolves from its ground state at @xmath11 , although this assumption is not strictly necessary .",
    "the exact @xmath12({\\bf r},t)$ ] has a functional dependence on @xmath13 that is nonlocal in space and time , i.e. , contains information about the previous history of the system , including its initial state .",
    "@xcite however , almost all present applications of tddft employ the adiabatic approximation , ignoring all functional dependence of @xmath14 on prior time - dependent densities @xmath1 , @xmath15 .",
    "the simplest example is the adiabatic local - density approximation ( alda ) : @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the xc energy density of a homogeneous electron gas of density @xmath18 .",
    "the neglect of retardation in alda implies frequency - independent and real xc kernels in linear response .",
    "@xcite this approach has been widely used for calculating molecular excitation energies .",
    "@xcite    one can make the general statement that the adiabatic approximation works well for excitations of the many - body system that have a direct counterpart in the kohn - sham system , such as atomic and molecular single - particle excitations.@xcite on the other hand , for more complicated processes such as double or charge - transfer excitations the alda often fails dramatically .",
    "@xcite    several attempts to go beyond the alda can be found in the literature .",
    "@xcite vignale and kohn @xcite showed that a non - adiabatic _ local _ approximation for exchange and correlation requires the time - dependent _ current _ @xmath19 as basic variable , rather than the density @xmath20 ( c - tddft ) .",
    "this formalism was later cast in a physically more transparent form using the language of hydrodynamics , @xcite where non - adiabatic xc effects appear as viscoelastic stresses in the electron liquid .    to date",
    ", c - tddft has been applied mainly in frequency - dependent linear response .",
    "the first application was to calculate linewidths of intersubband plasmons in semiconductor quantum wells .",

    "c - tddft includes damping due to electronic many - body effects , in good agreement with experimental linewidths .",
    "@xcite van faassen _",
    "@xcite calculated static axial polarizabilities in molecular chains , which are greatly overestimated with alda , and achieved an excellent agreement with ab initio quantum chemical results .",
    "other recent studies used c - tddft to calculate atomic and molecular excitation energies .",
    "@xcite    beyond linear response , a wealth of interesting electron dynamics can be explored using tdks theory.@xcite the c - tddft formalism has recently been applied to describe linear and nonlinear charge - density oscillations in quantum wells in the time domain.@xcite it was shown that the retardation caused by the memory dependence of the xc potential has the striking consequence of introducing decoherence and energy relaxation .",
    "@xcite    an alternative non - adiabatic theory has recently been developed by one of the authors .",
    "@xcite the idea is to relate the local stress in the electron liquid , and thus the xc potential , to the dynamics of deformations of fluid elements in the quantum many - body system .",
    "this leads to a formally exact reformulation of tddft from the point of view of an observer in a co - moving lagrangian reference frame ( l - tddft ) .",
    "casting the theory in terms of lagrangian coordinates allows one to get around the well - known problem of `` ultranonlocality '' in tddft , and to derive , in a rigorous fashion , an exact time - dependent , non - adiabatic extension of the ground - state lda .    in the l - tddft formalism",
    "the xc potential appears as a local functional of the dynamic deformation tensor . at present ,",
    "two limiting forms of this local functional are available . a high - frequency",
    ", `` elastic '' form of the non - adiabatic xc potential was derived in ref .  .",
    "the elastic approximation correctly accounts for all complicated nonlinear deformation effects , but completely neglects possible xc contributions to dissipation .",
    "the second available limiting form of the non - adiabatic xc potential corresponds to the regime of small deformations .",
    "as we will show , in the limit of small deformations l - tddft formally reduces to c - tddft . in this limit",
    "the xc stress ( and thus the xc potential ) is proportional to the linearized strain tensor which can be considered as a local linear functional of the current .",
    "in fact , c - tddft of ref .   can be viewed as a viscoelastic linear hooke s law in the nonlinear quantum continuum mechanics defined by the general formulation of l - tddft .",
    "in contrast to the purely elastic approximation constructed in ref .  , c - tddft contains all dissipation effects , but is formally restricted to infinitesimally small deformations .",
    "of course , the formal asymptotic criteria and the practical regimes of applicability of any approximation can be quite different .",
    "therefore a more detailed analysis based on explicit numerical examples is required to assess the validity of the two currently available non - adiabatic xc functionals , and to analyze their relation to alda .",
    "thus , the purpose of this paper is to illustrate , compare , and analyze c - tddft and the elastic approximation to l - tddft for simple , quasi - one - dimensional model systems , in order to show the differences and common grounds of both approaches .",
    "we explore the performance of the two xc potentials for two kinds of analytically given time - dependent model densities , representing charge - density oscillations in the form of collective sloshing and breathing modes of varying amplitudes and frequencies",
    ". this will allow us to simulate electron dynamics over a wide range of time and frequency scales , from the linear to the nonlinear regime . in our analysis",
    ", we will focus on a detailed comparison of the time - dependent xc potentials , as well as on the instantaneous and time - averaged power absorption associated with the charge - density oscillations .",
    "this will give us insight into the inner workings of c- and l - tddft in different dynamical regimes , and their relation to the alda .",
    "in particular , we will discuss and clarify the meaning of `` non - adiabatic '' , the cross - over from the linear to the nonlinear domain , and the competition and coexistence of elastic and dissipative xc effects .",
    "it turns out that , for small - amplitude deformations , c- and l - tddft agree in the limit of short time scales or , equivalently , in the high - frequency regime . in general , the two theories show some differences in their treatment of elastic and dissipative effects in the inhomogeneous electron liquid . however , the size of these differences strongly depends on the type of collective mode , and the associated charge - density deformations .",
    "if the deformations are large and occur on short time ( high frequency ) scales , both non - adiabatic theories give a clear indication of a failure of the alda .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : theory ] we summarize the essential formal framework of c- and l - tddft .",
    "section [ sec : const ] shows how to construct simple analytic model densities in the lagrangian and associated laboratory reference frame .",
    "section [ sec : results ] presents detailed numerical results and discussion , with a separate treatment of the linear and nonlinear regime .",

    "in the following , we use the einstein convention for the summation over repeated indices .",

    "in contrast with the xc scalar potential , the xc vector potential admits a frequency - dependent local approximation .",
    "the resulting expression can be written as follows:@xcite @xmath31 here , @xmath32 denotes the speed of light , and @xmath33 is the xc viscoelastic stress tensor : @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the velocity field associated with the current response , and @xmath36 and @xmath37 are complex viscosity coefficients defined as @xmath38 @xmath39 @xmath40 and @xmath41 are frequency - dependent xc kernels for the homogeneous electron gas , which can be found in various parametrizations in the literature .",
    "@xcite in eq .",

    ", the form of the nonlinear xc vector potential is dictated by a number of general requirements , such as newton s third law ( xc force density follows from a symmetric stress tensor ) , and the proper limit in the linear regime , which was discussed in the subsection above .",
    "a formally exact , general expression for @xmath43 resulting from these requirements will be presented within the lagrangian framework in section [ ltddft ] . however , a straightforward expression for a nonlinear , nonadiabatic xc vector potential , valid up to second order in the spatial derivatives , follows almost immediately : @xmath44 where the viscoelastic stress tensor @xmath45 now contains the time - dependent velocity field @xmath46 : @xmath47 + \\zeta({\\bf r},t , t ' ) \\nabla \\cdot { \\bf v}({\\bf r},t ' ) \\delta_{ij } \\bigg\\}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the viscosity coefficients in eq .",
    "( [ sigmaxc ] ) are the fourier transforms of ( [ 2.a.11 ] ) and ( [ 2.a.12 ] ) : @xmath48 and similar for @xmath49 .",
    "the apparent ambiguity in eq . ( [ visct ] ) whether the density should be evaluated at @xmath50 or @xmath51 is resolved by noting that the difference involves higher gradient corrections .",
    "we emphasize again that the simple form of eq . ( [ axc ] ) is justified by the basic assumption that the gradients of the density and velocity are small ; the velocity itself , on the other hand , need not be small .",
    "these points will be elaborated in more detail in section [ ltddft ] , where we will explain how the approximate expression ( [ axc ] ) is obtained from the lagrangian framework in the appropriate limit .    in the following , we consider model systems where all spatial dependence is along the @xmath52 direction only .",
    "one can then transform the xc vector potential , eq .",
    "( [ axc ] ) , into a scalar one : @xmath53 ( alda+m ) , with the memory part given by @xmath54 assuming that the system has been in the ground state ( with zero velocity field ) for @xmath55 , the @xmath56 component of the xc stress tensor becomes @xmath57 where the memory kernel @xmath58 is given by @xmath59 with the help of the kramers - kronig relations for @xmath60 we can express the memory kernel as follows : @xmath61 with the xc shear modulus of the electron liquid , @xcite @xmath62 the short - time behavior of @xmath63 is of particular interest , since it governs the high - frequency dynamics .",
    "the limit @xmath64 can be expressed analytically using the kramers - kronig relation @xmath65 where the high - frequency limit @xmath66 is known via the third - moment sum rules .",
    "@xcite the result is @xmath67 it is also straightforward to see that @xmath68 , i.e. , the memory kernel starts with zero slope .",

    "here , @xmath70 is the characteristic time scale associated with the plasma frequency @xmath71 . as noted earlier , @xcite @xmath72 and @xmath73 are identical at @xmath74 and have a similar short - time behavior .",

    "@xcite it is interesting to notice that both qv and gk memory kernels reach their long - time asymptotic limits very rapidly , within about half a plasma cycle @xmath80 .",
    "the main problem in constructing nonadiabatic approximations for xc potentials is an inherent nonlocality of the time - dependent theory .",
    "physically , this nonlocality is related to the convective motion of the electron fluid ( the particles at a given point of space retain the memory of their previous positions).@xcite the key idea of l - tddft is to eliminate the above source of nonlocality by reformulating the theory in the lagrangian frame , i.e. , in a local reference frame moving with the fluid . since the convective motion in the lagrangian frame is absent , a spatially local description of xc effects becomes possible .",
    "this possibility represents the most important outcome of l - tddft : it allows one to derive an exact nonadiabatic extension of lda into the dynamic regime .",
    "the general formulation of l - tddft starts with the exact relation of the xc force to the xc stress tensor @xmath81 .",
    "@xcite by definition the xc potential @xmath43 ensures that the physical density and current are reproduced by an auxiliary system of noninteracting ks particles .",
    "this means that @xmath43 should produce an effective xc lorentz force that exactly compensates for a difference of local stress forces in the real interacting system and in the noninteracting ks system .",
    "accordingly , the xc vector potential should satisfy the following equation : @xmath82 where @xmath83 is the difference of the full stress tensor for the interacting system , @xmath84 , and the kinetic stress tensor for ks system , @xmath85 . equation ( [ l1 ] ) serves as a basic definition of @xmath43 , which automatically accounts for the zero force and zero torque conditions.@xcite    we note that the xc stress tensor @xmath81 is to be distinguished from the earlier introduced xc stress tensor @xmath86 .",
    "the connection between the two will be explained in detail in subsection [ ltddftsmall ] .",
    "the main difference lies in the fact that @xmath81 , formally exactly and to all orders in the inhomogeneity , accounts for _ all _ dynamical xc effects , whereas the alda has been separated out in the definition of @xmath86 .",
    "furthermore , @xmath87 is valid only for small deformations of the electron liquid ( in a sense to be defined below ) .",
    "all the rest of l - tddft can be viewed as a calculation of the dynamic xc stress tensor @xmath81 , which enters the definition of @xmath88 , eq .",
    "( [ l1 ] ) , by reformulating the problem in the co - moving lagrangian frame .",
    "the transformation to the lagrangian frame corresponds to a nonlinear transformation of coordinates , @xmath89 , where @xmath90 is the trajectory of an infinitesimal fluid element that evolves from the point @xmath91 .",
    "formally the function @xmath90 is defined by the following initial value problem : @xmath92 the initial positions , @xmath91 , of the fluid elements play the role of spatial coordinates in the co - moving frame .",
    "the above transformation from the old coordinates @xmath93 to the new coordinates @xmath91 induces a change of metric .",
    "the metric tensor in the lagrangian @xmath91-space coincides with the green s deformation tensor , @xmath94 which is a common characteristic of deformations in the lagrangian formulation of continuum mechanics . a complete reformulation of tddft in the co - moving frame shows that a local description of xc effects is possible if one uses @xmath95 as a basic variable : the stress tensor in the lagrangian frame can be consistently considered as a spatially local functional of the green s deformation tensor .",
    "for most practical applications we need the xc potential in the laboratory frame , eq .",
    "( [ l1 ] ) . transforming the stress tensor functional from the co - moving to the laboratory frame , we find the required tensor @xmath81 entering eq .",
    "( [ l1 ] ) .",
    "the locality in the lagrangian frame translates to a local dependence of @xmath81 on the cauchy s deformation tensor , @xmath96 where the function @xmath97 is obtained by inverting the trajectory equation , @xmath98 .",
    "the cauchy s tensor @xmath99 is commonly used to describe deformations in the eulerian formulation of continuum mechanics . from a physical point of view , the functional dependence of the stress tensor on @xmath100 thus emerges quite naturally .",

    "( [ l2 ] ) and ( [ l4 ] ) , show that in general the deformation tensor is a strongly nonlocal ( both in space and in time ) functional of the velocity .",
    "therefore , in spite of the fact that the xc stress tensor and consequently the xc vector potential are local functionals of @xmath100 , they are nonlocal in terms of velocity or any other variable .",

    "a solution of a homogeneous time - dependent many - body problem in the lagrangian frame is required ( see sec .",

    "non - adiabaticity manifests itself through elastic and dissipative components of the electron dynamics , which can be distinguished by their characteristic phase lag with respect to the alda .",
    "both elastic and dissipative effects enter the theory via the dependence of xc potential on the deformation tensor .",
    "since the deformation is defined relative to the initial state , this dependence reflects how much of its history the system carries in its memory .",
    "a local - in - time dependence on the deformation , which occurs in the high - frequency regime , corresponds to an extremely pronounced memory and a purely elastic xc potential .",
    "the dissipative contribution formally appears in the form of a time - nonlocality in the dependence of xc potential on deformations of the electron fluid . in general this",
    "time - nonlocality tends to shorten the characteristic memory time , and , as a result , it somewhat diminishes the elastic contribution .",
    "in addition it brings about fundamentally new effects , such as relaxation and the corresponding power absorption . which of the the two contributions ( elastic or dissipative ) is dominant , or whether both play an equally important role , depends on the dynamical regime in which the system under study is evolving . the results from our simple model system",
    "lead us to the following conclusions :    _ linear regime .",
    "_ for small - amplitude oscillations , dissipation is the most important and dramatic consequence of non - adiabaticity , which leads to qualitative corrections to the adiabatic dynamics .",
    "there is a dynamical range which we call `` crossover '' regime in which the power absorption due to xc retardation effects is maximal .",
    "this crossover regime occurs for frequencies that are comparable to an average plasmon frequency for the system . on the other hand , for very low or for very high frequencies",
    ", dissipation vanishes .",
    "elastic effects in the linear regime appear to be less important , in a sense that they do not qualitatively change an overall behavior of the xc potential .",
    "however , the quantitative effect of elastic corrections to the linearized alda can be significant , especially in the high - frequency regime .",
    "in particular , for our breathing mode the post - alda non - adiabatic corrections are in general of the same order of magnitude as the dynamic part of the alda potential itself",
    ".    _ nonlinear regime . _ here , elastic effects become more important , especially at high frequencies , which can lead to substantial , and in certain regimes absolutely dominant contributions to the time - dependent xc potential . as we discussed for the sloshing and breathing modes ,",
    "the elasticity of the electron liquid tends to oppose attempts to subject the electron system to strong and rapid deformations .",
    "this general tendency also naturally explains why c - tddft has been successful for molecular polarizabilities , which are greatly overestimated in alda .",
    "@xcite dynamic polarization of the system corresponds to a redistribution of the charge density , i.  e. , to the deformation of an electron subsystem , which causes a counteracting xc force .",
    "this force is an intrinsically non - adiabatic effect that is completely missing in alda .",
    "our results once again illustrate the special role of kohn s mode in tddft .",
    "if the electron dynamics sufficiently resembles kohn s mode , as is the case for the sloshing mode considered here , non - adiabatic effects are generally small . on the other hand , for electron dynamics involving high degrees of compression , such as our breathing mode , the non -",
    "adiabatic `` corrections '' can become several times larger than the alda potential itself , so that the alda completely breaks down , leading to a qualitatively wrong behavior .",
    "a striking illustration of such a situation was shown in fig .",
    "[ figure15 ] .    finally , most of the discussions in this paper , especially those related to dissipative effects , are relevant only for non - adiabaticity in extended systems , where purely electronic dissipation has a well - defined meaning .",
    "@xcite the situation is less clear when one attempts to describe non - adiabatic effects in finite systems such as atoms and molecules .",
    "@xcite here , the elasticity of the electron liquid leads to small shifts of excitation energies , but one also obtains finite linewidths due to dissipation , which is clearly an unwanted effect .",
    "the question how non - adiabatic xc potentials for small systems should be constructed thus remains an open issue .",
    "the sign difference reflects an ambiguity in the definition of the stress tensor in the continuum mechanics literature . the standard formulation of c - tddft @xcite follows the sign convention used in the classical elasticity theory , where the divergence of the stress tensor @xmath252 defines a force exerted on a small volume element by surroundings parts of the body . in contrast",

    "the sign of the stress tensor @xmath84 coincides with the sign of momentum flow tensor . with this definition",
