    "the physics of quantum critical point ( qcp ) @xcite is now a subject of growing interest .",
    "there is a solid experimental evidence of relevance of the qcp and related phenomena for ferroelectrics @xcite , high - temperature superconductors @xcite , bose - einstein condensed atoms in traps @xcite , itinerant electron magnets @xcite , heavy fermion compounds @xcite and many other systems . similar to classical critical points or second - order phase transitions , a scaling concept is of crucial importance near the qcp and universal critical exponents can be introduced , which determine all anomalous properties of the systems near qcp @xcite .",
    "the universality means that the basic physics depends not on the details of a microscopic hamiltonian but rather on space dimensionality , dispersion law of low - frequency and long - wavelength fluctuations of an order parameter and symmetry properties of their effective action .",
    "in contrast with classical phase transitions at finite temperatures thermodynamics of the qcp is essentially dependent on the _ dynamical _ critical exponents @xcite .",
    "there is an interesting issue how these critical fluctuations can effect on the state of an excess charge carrier which appears as a result of doping , injection , photoexcitation , etc .",
    "one can consider for example the electron motion in a crystal near the ferroelectric quantum phase transition in virtual ferroelectrics such as srtio@xmath0 or ktao@xmath0 under doping or pressure @xcite , or near quantum magnetic phase transition due to competing exchange interactions @xcite . to our knowledge",
    "this problem has not been considered yet .",
    "one may speculate that a specific nature of the order parameter is not very essential for this problem ; due to softness and long - range character of the critical fluctuations the effects of their interaction with the conduction electrons may be very strong . in particular , we will see that a self - trapping ( autolocalization ) of the carrier proves possible , similar to a polaron formation in ionic crystals @xcite or spin polarons ( `` ferrons '' ) in magnetic semiconductors @xcite .",
    "a general concept of the self - trapped electronic state due to interaction with order parameter fluctuations ( `` fluctuon '' ) has been proposed many years ago by krivoglaz @xcite .",
    "it appeared , however , that his phenomenological approach is not applicable near the critical point where the fluctuon radius is smaller than the correlation length @xcite .",
    "we have considered this case @xcite using feynman path integral variational approach developed him for the polaron problem @xcite . here",
    "we apply similar technique to consider the quantum case .",
    "it will be shown that the classical and quantum fluctuons are drastically different : if the latter can be considered as a specific quasiparticle the former one represents some quasilocalized state in the density of states tail . apart from possible applications to condensed matter physics the problem under consideration",
    "gives a nontrivial example of the interaction of a fermion with a bosonic quantum field with anomalous scaling properties .",
    "whereas only the case of dispersionless einstein phonon has been considered originally by feynman , later this method has been used also to describe the interaction of electron with acoustic phonons @xcite .",
    "we consider here a general case of fluctuations with arbitrary dynamics which can be , in particular , of dissipative type .",
    "the answers will be written in terms of some frequency momenta of the fluctuations .",
    "one can assume that the type of the fluctuation dynamics , being relevant , e.g. , for transport phenomena is not essential for static characteristics such as autolocalization radius and energy ; anyway , the method used by us gives a rigorous upper limit for the ground - state energy .",
    "another difference ( which is more important ) is that the phonon field is gaussian whereas the gaussian approximation for the fluctuations which we will use can be justified only for not too large coupling constants .",
    "it leads to some restrictions which will be derived separately for all cases under consideration .",
    "the interaction of electrons with quantum critical fluctuations are intensively studied , especially in connection with high - temperature superconductivity and heavy - fermion systems ( for review , see refs . @xcite and @xcite , respectively ) .",
    "usually it is assumed that the coupling constant is small in comparison with the fermi energy .",
    "here we consider the case of _ single _ carrier where the character of electron states is essentially different ; one can say that this difference is similar to the difference between localized and extended states for the disordered systems . as a next step , it would be interesting to consider degenerate gas of fluctuons where the fermi energy is finite but small in comparison with the autolocalization energy which might be a subject of future investigations .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we overview general formalism for solving the problem posed . in the present paper",
    "we consider the case of not too large coupling constant , where the problem can be considered in gaussian approximation for the interaction with the fluctuations ; explicit criteria are presented below .",
    "the quantum case ( zero temperature ) is considered in section 3 . using the scaling properties of the fluctuation spectral density ( subsection 3.1 ) we construct regular perturbative expansion of the energy in the coupling constant ( weak - coupling regime , subsection 3.2 ) as well as singular perturbative expansion in strong coupling regime ( subsection 3.3 ) .",
    "the very existence of the regular perturbative regime depends crucially on the value of dynamical critical exponent @xmath1 and anomalous dimension @xmath2 .",
    "the problem of fluctuon at classical critical point ( finite temperature ) is treated in section 4 .",
    "we solve the problem by both feynman variational method ( subsection 4.1 ) and using green function technique with vertex corrections via ward identity ( subsection 4.2 ) .",
    "the similarity of the results as regards dependencies of the density of states on the energy and coupling constant justifies the variational approach .",
    "for simplicity , we will consider the case of a scalar order - parameter acting only on the orbital motion of the electron and not on its spin ( for example it may be the qcp in ferroelectrics ) .",
    "then , in continuum approximation , the hamiltonian of the system consisting of the electron and the order - parameter field can be written in a simple form    @xmath3    where we have chosen the units @xmath4 , @xmath5 is the electron effective mass , @xmath6 is the electron coordinate , @xmath7 is the quantum order - parameter field with its own hamiltonian @xmath8 and @xmath9 is the coupling constant .",

    "further we will consider only the cases where @xmath20 .    to estimate @xmath21 and electron energy @xmath22 we use the same trial action as was proposed by feynman for the polaron problem @xcite @xmath23 where @xmath24 ^{2}e^{-w\\left| \\tau -\\sigma \\right| } d\\tau d\\sigma , \\label{tract}\\ ] ] @xmath25 and @xmath26 being trial parameters .",

    "explicit criterion for applicability of the gaussian approximation depends crucially on the critical exponents and space dimensionality , see section 3 .",

    "so we obtain the variational upper - bound estimation @xmath57 , where @xmath58 and @xmath59 .",
    "note that for even - frequency spectrum fluctuations ( in particular static ones ) @xmath60 , so the interaction term in eq.([fin-1 ] ) vanishes .      until now the statistical properties of the field @xmath61 have not been specified .",

    "the electron is weakly `` fluctuation - dressed '' .",
    "using assumed smallness of @xmath76 we can expand the right - hand side of eq.([fin-2 ] ) in the taylor series with respect to @xmath76 .",

    "the eq.([fin-3 ] ) is to be minimized with respect to @xmath76 and @xmath74 .",
    "let the optimum values of the variational parameters be @xmath82 and @xmath83 . within the small @xmath76 regime , the correction @xmath84 to the bare kinetic energy that describes the fluctuation - driven renormalization of the electron effective mass , results in a contribution @xmath85 to the optimal bound @xmath86 .",
    "this contribution is negligible when expanding @xmath86 up to terms @xmath87 inclusive .",
    "the condition that allows to neglect the above renormalization reads @xmath88 which is , in general , consistent with eq.([w - bcond ] ) . assuming the condition of eq.([cond1 ] ) to hold , we minimize eq.([fin-3 ] ) first in @xmath76 and next in @xmath74 .",
    "this gives the following expression for @xmath89 and @xmath86 @xmath90 and @xmath91 respectively , where the positive number @xmath92 is the maximum of the function @xmath93 viz .",
    "@xmath94 and @xmath83 is the point where this maximum is attained .",
    "note that @xmath95 due to eqs.([fun - a_1 ] ) , ( [ fun - g ] ) , so for existence of the above maximum it would be sufficient that @xmath96 . as deduced from the very structure of @xmath97 ( eq.([fin-3 ] ) ) , the parameter @xmath98 ^{-\\frac{1}{2}}k_{\\max } ^{-1 } \\label{fluct - size1}\\ ] ] is a measure of the fluctuon potential - well size , which should be much larger than the lattice constant , i.e. satisfy @xmath99 .    by the virtue of eq.([fun - a_2 ] ) @xmath100 .",
    "therefore , once eq.([cond1 ] ) is checked to hold , it automatically results in @xmath101 , due to eq.([mu_0 ] ) .",
    "on the other hand , inability to satisfy eq.([cond1 ] ) would mean inapplicability of the perturbational regime . after this general analysis ,",
    "let us consider different cases regarding the critical exponent @xmath1 .",
    "in this case we always have @xmath103 , due to smallness of non - adiabaticity parameter @xmath104 , so eqs.([const - a_0 ] ) - ( [ fun - a_2 ] ) reduce to the functions of the combined index @xmath105 @xmath106 @xmath107 where @xmath108 and @xmath109 the necessary condition for the finiteness of the above integrals is @xmath110 .",

    ", this means that at least one maximum point @xmath124 does exist at @xmath125 .",
    "one the other hand , the equation @xmath126 for determining @xmath83 is rigorously transformed to the following one : @xmath127 which obviously has no solution if @xmath128 .",
    "thus for @xmath128 , the weak coupling regime never applies .",
    "this exponents range will be revisited in section 3.2 .    for @xmath129 , the assumption of small @xmath83 would allow one , by the virture of eq.([lim - phi ] ) , to solve approximately eq.([q_0-equat ] ) in a closed form .",
    "however , compared with numerics for specific @xmath114 , this approximation seems to be too inaccurate .",
    "an approximate equation , which results from inclusion of the next - to - leading terms of that asymptotic , can not be solved analytically anymore .",

    "the average green function of the electron describing by the hamiltonian ( [ ham ] ) with the gaussian random static field @xmath478 is written in a closed form @xmath479 where @xmath480 and @xmath307 are the self - energy and three - leg vertex , correspondingly , @xmath481 are , as before , @xmath44-dimensional wave vectors , and static correlation function is given by the expression ( [ statcorr ] ) . to find asymptotic of dos for large enough negative energies one can use a method proposed first by keldysh for doped semiconductors @xcite ( the same trick was used also for magnetic semiconductors near @xmath482 @xcite and for electron topological transitions @xcite ) . for large enough @xmath483",
    "one can neglect momentum dependence of both @xmath480 and @xmath307 since only the momentum transfer @xmath484 is relevant for @xmath485 .",
    "also , we can express @xmath307 in terms of @xmath480 via the ward identity @xcite @xmath486 then , taking into account eq.([statcorr ] ) , we obtain a closed differential equation for the self - energy of the form @xmath487    consider now the density of states ( dos ) @xmath488 it is clear that at @xmath489 @xmath490 at least for @xmath491 the main contribution to @xmath492 comes from small @xmath459 ( @xmath493 ) region .",
    "let us solve now the equation ( [ difeq ] ) .",
    "integrating over @xmath459 one derives @xmath494 \\left [ \\sigma\\left ( e\\right ) -e\\right ] ^{\\frac{d}{2}-1 } \\label{difeq1}\\ ] ]    denoting @xmath495 ^{\\frac{2}{d } }   \\label{e0sigma}\\ ] ] with @xmath496 given by eq.([e00 ] ) we obtain a non - linear first - order ordinary differential equation @xmath497 for @xmath205 this is riccatti equation , which was solved in a similar context earlier @xcite .",
    "we consider here only the asymptotic behavior of the solution at @xmath498 and @xmath499 directly from the initial equation ( [ difeq ] ) .",
    "for these @xmath470 @xmath500 and we linearize this equation with respect to the imaginary part of the self - energy to obtain @xmath501 thus , we have @xmath502 , \\;\\left| e\\right| \\gg e_{0 } \\label{sig115}\\ ] ] where @xmath25 is an undetermined integration constant . at these energies ,",

    "this may be considered as a justification of our treatment basing on the feynman variational approach .",
    "the physical meaning of the self - trapping energy for quantum and classical fluctuons are essentially different . for the fluctuon near qcp , as well as for the feynman polaron , we calculate approximately the ground state electron energy , or the edge of the spectrum . if we will calculate next - order corrections to the electron free energy in @xmath504 we will find just a temperature shift of this energy rather than any exponential tail of dos .",
    "the energy of the classical fluctuon is just a position of the chemical potential at small enough electron concentration @xmath505 . for @xmath506 which is a capacity of the tail , the chemical potential level is `` pinned '' to the fluctuon energy and almost independent on @xmath505 due to exponential dependence of the dos ( [ density ] ) on @xmath470 .",
    "let us resume on the main results obtained . due to complexity of the problem of the electron states near quantum critical point ( qcp )",
    "it is hardly believable that this problem can be treated rigorously . to obtain first insight into this we used variational approach within feynman path integral formalism .",
    "originally , this approach was developed in the connection with polaron in ionic crystals and proved to give excellent results @xcite .",
    "for the case of classical critical point ( ccp ) we have checked the reliability of this approach by fairly independent green function method .",
    "the results on the electron ground state at qcp turn out to be crucially dependent on the anomalous space dimensionality @xmath507 and dynamical critical exponent @xmath1 .",
    "the most interesting result is nonexistence of regular perturbation theory for the ground state energy for arbitrary small coupling constant @xmath9 . in such cases",
    "singular perturbation theory emerges with the expansion in non - integer powers of @xmath9 . for @xmath508 ,",
    "those cases fall into range @xmath509 .",
    "for @xmath164 it occurs at @xmath510 which is consistent if @xmath198 .    in the above mentioned singular perturbation - theory cases , as well as in general situation at large enough @xmath9 ( strong coupling regime ) the leading term in the ground state energy",
    "is independent of @xmath1 and is given by eq.([q_0 , e_0sc ] ) .",
    "this result is valid for @xmath511 ( @xmath41 is the electron bandwidth and @xmath454 is a typical fluctuation energy ) which in fact is a criterion of consistence of continuum approximation .",
    "physically this means that the size of self - trapped state ( fluctuon ) is much larger than interatomic distance .",
    "otherwise a small - radius fluctuon likely forms , which should be considered by different methods .",
    "in contrast with the quantum case , at ccp the fluctuon states form a continuum in the dos tail . in this case the variational fluctuon s free energy by feynman method simply gives a position of the electron chemical potential in the tail counted from the bare band edge .",
    "the tail capacity proves @xmath512 times a numerical constant ; if the electron concentration is much larger than this estimate the fluctuons can scarcely contribute to the electron properties of material near ccp ."
