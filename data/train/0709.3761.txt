    "star formation in the early universe likely started in gas - rich protogalactic fragments , which may have been the birth place of globular clusters ( kravtsov & gnedin 2005 ) .",
    "these fragments subsequently merged to form progressively larger systems .",
    "the incidence of merger activity peaked in the distant past , and simulations predict that the assembly of the galaxy was largely complete at least 9 gyr ago ( e.g. bullock & johnston 2005 ) .",
    "the original companions of the galaxy are thought to have been completely assimilated , although fossil remnants may survive to the present day in the solar neighborhood ( e.g. helmi et al .",
    "the present - day galactic satellites were likely accreted only during the past few gyr ( bullock & johnston 2005 ) , and have probably not yet contributed to the galactic stellar content ( abadi , navarro , & steinmetz 2006 ) .    although the epoch of large - scale galaxy assembly occured far in the past , nearby dwarf galaxies with elevated star formation rates ( sfrs ) may provide glimpses of conditions in the earliest systems , as well as insight into the timescale of satellite accretion in the local universe . while having a total mass that is similar to the local group ( karachentsev et al .",
    "2002 ) , the centaurus group contains galaxies that have no obvious local group counterpart ( e.g. ngc 5128 ; m83 ) , making centaurus an interesting target for studies of galaxy evolution .",
    "ngc 5253 and eso269-g058 are dwarf galaxies in the centaurus group that are presently undergoing episodes of intense star formation , and in the current study the old and intermediate age stellar contents of these systems are investigated , with the goal of understanding their past evolution and placing them in context with other dwarf galaxies .",
    "evidence for on - going star formation in ngc 5253 can be traced out to @xmath7 parsecs from the galaxy center ( calzetti et al .",
    "still , the star - forming activity is highly concentrated in the central regions , and the density of ionizing photons suggests that there are 1200 o7 stars in the central pc , and 7000 o stars in the inner 20 pc ( turner & beck 2004 ) . nevertheless , while the level of star - forming activity in ngc 5253 is impressive by galactic standards , with the possible exception of the nucleus of ngc 5253 , there are areas in other galaxies that harbour more intense regions of star formation ( alonso - herrero et al .",

    ", the smaller clusters may not be long - lived , and tremonti et al .",
    "( 2001 ) estimate that they are disrupted on time scales of a few tens of myr .",
    "the bulk of long wavelength emission in ngc 5253 is from free - free processes ( turner , ho , & beck 1998 ) , and the absence of synchrotron emission ostensibly suggests that star formation has only recently been initiated .",
    "however , this is almost certainly not the case .",
    "the clusters in the central regions of ngc 5253 have ages @xmath13 myr ( tremonti et al .",
    "2001 ; harris et al . 2004 ; cresci , vanzi , & sauvage 2005 ) , and only @xmath14 of the lower mass clusters have ages @xmath15 myr ( alonso - herrero et al .",
    "the oldest star clusters have a cumulative mass that is @xmath16 greater than that of the younger clusters , and cresci et al .",
    "( 2005 ) argue that the sfr was much higher in the not too distant past . the presence of cepheids in ngc 5253 ( saha et al",
    ". 1995 ) is evidence of star formation a few tens of myr in the past , while the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of the intracluster regions within 8 arcsec of the nucleus is indicative of a luminosity - weighted age 100  500 myr ( calzetti et al . 1997 ) .",
    "finally , ngc 5253 has hosted two type i sne in the past @xmath17 years , which yields a sne rate that is more than an order of magnitude higher than expected ( van den bergh 1980 ) .",
    "such a high type i sne rate suggests that ngc 5253 vigorously formed stars during intermediate epochs .",
    "in contrast to ngc 5253 , the young stellar content of eso269g058 has not been the subject of detailed study .",
    "there is a prominent dust lane that slices through the center of the galaxy ( sersic 1974 ; hawarden et al .",
    "1981 ) , and complicates efforts to study the nuclear regions where young stars might be expected .",
    "still , eso269g058 was detected by iras at 25 , 60 , and @xmath18 m ( knapp et al . 1989 ) , and these data indicate that there is an elevated sfr in eso269g058 , although not at the level that is seen in ngc 5253 . indeed , the total flux from eso260g058 in the 12 ",

    "the stellar contents of ngc 5253 and eso269g058 outside of their central regions provide clues into the early evolution of these galaxies , and their relationship to other dwarf galaxies .",

    "they detected stars with magnitudes consistent with red giants , although a more detailed analysis was not possible since these stars are at the faint limit of their data .",
    "still , based on the integrated colors of the extranuclear region , caldwell & phillips suggest that the outer regions of ngc 5253 may contain an intermediate age component , and that ngc 5253 will evolve into a nucleated de galaxy .",

    "comparisons are made with model luminosity function ( lfs ) to estimate the masses of intermediate age components .",
    "the centaurus group is viewed at low galactic latitudes , and so there is significant foreground extinction . throughout this paper",
    "it is assumed that the foreground extinction towards ngc 5253 is a@xmath21 while for eso269g058 the assumed extinction is a@xmath22 ; both values are from the schlegel , finkbeiner , & davis ( 1998 ) maps . as for internal reddening",
    ", the balmer decrement of the integrated light near the center of ngc 5253 suggests that the field population is not heavily reddened ; rather , it is only the young star clusters that are heavily obscured ( calzetti et al . 1997 ) , and so the internal extinction is assumed to be negligible .",
    "a similar assumption is made for the main body of eso269g058 , which lies outside of the central dust lane .",

    "a 5 point dither pattern , which was defined to allow the gaps between the ccds in the detector mosaic to be filled during processing , was employed .",

    "the locations of the target fields , which were positioned to sample the minor axis of each galaxy , are indicated in figure 1 .",
    "the data were reduced using standard procedures for ccd imaging .",
    "the basic steps in the reduction process were ( 1 ) the removal of ccd - to - ccd gain variations , ( 2 ) bias subtraction , ( 3 ) the division by flat - field frames , which were obtained by observing the twilight sky , and ( 4 ) the removal of interference fringes from the @xmath1 observations .",
    "the calibration frame used in the last step was constructed by median - combining @xmath1 observations of various fields , so that stars and galaxies were suppressed while retaining interference fringes .",
    "the images thus processed were spatially aligned and then median - combined .",
    "the final images for photometric analysis were obtained by trimming the stacked images to the area common to all exposures in the dither pattern .",
    "the photometric measurements were made with the point spread function ( psf ) fitting routine allstar ( stetson & harris 1988 ) , using psfs and target lists that were obtained from tasks in the daophot ( stetson 1987 ) package .",

    "one goal of this study is to investigate the intrinsic dispersion in the rgb sequences of ngc 5253 and eso269g058 , and this requires that the broadening due to random photometric errors be known .",
    "this information was obtained by running artificial star experiments .",
    "the artificial stars , which were assigned brightnesses and colors appropriate for stars on the upper rgb in each galaxy , were placed throughout the images so that the impact of changing stellar density with distance from the center of each galaxy could be assessed .",

    "isochrones with z = 0.0001 , 0.001 , and 0.004 are shown ; the solid lines show evolution on the first ascent giant branch , while the dashed lines shows the portion of the agb where stellar luminosities exceed that at the rgb - tip .",

    "stars belonging to ngc 5253 , is also shown to allow contamination from foreground stars and background galaxies to be assessed .",
    "the locus of rgb stars in the 3  5 kpc interval is reasonably well matched by the z = 0.001 ( [ fe / h ] @xmath37 ) isochrone , whereas the blue edge of the rgb roughly follows the z = 0.0001 ( [ fe / h ] @xmath38 ) sequence .",
    "the uncertainties in the photometric measurements predicted from the artificial star experiments are also shown in figure 3 , and it is evident that much of the rgb width is due to random uncertainties in the photometry .",
    "the @xmath39 distributions of stars with @xmath40 ( i.e. the upper 0.4 magnitude of the rgb ) in three radial intervals are compared in figure 4 .",
    "to account statistically for sources that do not belong to ngc 5253 , the color distribution of objects in the @xmath41 kpc intervals were scaled to the area sampled in each radial interval , and then subtracted from the observed distributions .",
    "the dotted lines are gaussians that show the distribution expected for an idealized simple stellar system ( i.e. a system where the rgb has no intrinsic color dispersion ) that is broadened by photometric errors .",
    "the standard deviations of the gaussians were computed from the differences between the known and measured brightnesses of artificial stars .    at @xmath42 background galaxies",
    "are the dominant source of contamination in the vicinity of ngc 5253 .",

    "( 1995 ) suggest that there should be 30  40 galaxies in this brightness range .",
    "the dashed lines in figure 4 show the @xmath39 distribution of objects in the 8  10 kpc interval , which was used to monitor contamination from foreground stars and background galaxies ; these relations have been scaled to show the fractional contribution that objects in the 8  10 kpc interval make to the total number of sources detected in each distance interval .",
    "it is evident from figure 4 that objects not belonging to ngc 5253 constitute only a modest fraction of the sources detected out to 8 kpc .",
    "the mean @xmath39 color in the outer regions of ngc 5253 does not change markedly with radius , with @xmath43 .",
    "the predicted colors of 10 gyr isochrones with z = 0.0001 and 0.001 are indicated in figure 4 , and the peak of the color distribution is consistent with a metallicity that is slightly higher than z = 0.001 . to compute a mean metallicity , a photometric metallicity was determined for each star with @xmath40 in the @xmath44 kpc interval by interpolating between the 10 gyr girardi et al .",

    "the error is the @xmath46 random uncertainty computed from bootstrap re - sampling , in which samples of 500 stars were drawn at random from the stellar catalogue over the course of 1000 realizations .",
    "it is also worth noting that the excellent agreement between the observed color distributions and the dotted lines in figure 4 indicates that the intrinsic dispersion in the rgb of ngc 5253 is modest , amounting to only a few hundredths of a magnitude in @xmath39 .",
    "this implies that if there are rgb stars with [ fe / h ] that differ by more than a few tenths of a dex from the mean then they have a space density that is substantially lower than that of the dominant component .",
    "a population of agb stars is seen above the rgb - tip in the cmds of the 3  4 and 4  5 kpc intervals .",
    "the majority of these stars fall below the locus of agb - tip values for a 10 gyr population , indicating that they belong to an old population .",
    "still , a scattering of stars is seen above the locus of 10 gyr agb - tip values in the 3  4 and 4  5 kpc intervals .",
    "these stars occur in numbers that exceed what is seen in the 9  10 kpc field at comparable brightnesses , suggesting that a population of stars with an age @xmath47 gyr is present at intermediate distances from the center of ngc 5253 .",
    "the @xmath1 brightness of the agb - tip in these intervals is consistent with an age of a few hundred myr (  3.2.2 ) .",
    "the agb stars in the 3  4 and 4  5 kpc intervals span a wide range of @xmath39 colors , and the isochrones suggest that these stars have a larger range of metallicities than predicted from the rgb .",
    "this being said , caution should be excercised when interpreting the colors of upper agb stars , as many are photometric variables , and their colors will change as they cycle through their light curves .",
    "hence , they are not ideal tracers of metallicity .",
    "the metallicity computed from the color distributions in figure 4 assumes that the rgb is made up of stars that have an old age , whereas the presence of bright agb stars indicates that an intermediate age component is present .",
    "if the intermediate age component is sufficiently large then it will skew the metallicity estimate .",
    "the impact of adopting a markedly lower age for the main body of rgb stars is demonstrated in figure 4 , where the dashed arrow indicates the color expected for a z=0.001 rgb with an age of 2 gyr .",
    "if the mean age of ngc 5253 is as low as this  which would make ngc 5253 a truely remarkable galaxy  then the metallicity computed by assuming an old age will be underestimated by @xmath48 dex .",
    "the metallicity inferred for the rgb of ngc 5253 is likely not greatly skewed by the presence of intermediate age stars , as these objects constitute only a minor portion of the stellar mass in ngc 5253 .",
    "this claim is substantiated in  3.2.2 , where the size of the intermediate age component is estimated from comparisons with model lfs .",
    "hints that the intermediate age population does not dominate the stellar content can also be obtained from the cmds .",
    "rejkuba et al .",
    "( 2006 ) used the ratio of bright agb stars to stars on the upper rgb , which they refer to as p@xmath49 , to gauge the contribution that intermediate age stars make to two centaurus group des .",

    "therefore , the intermediate age component in the outer regions of ngc 5253 is likely smaller than in the rejkuba et al .",

    "the @xmath1 lfs of objects in ngc 5253 that have @xmath39 between -0.2 and 1.2 are shown in figure 5 ; the lfs of the 0  1 and 1  2 kpc intervals are not considered , as crowding hinders the ability to sample rgb stars in these regions .",
    "background and foreground objects have been removed in a statistical fashion by scaling the lf of the 8 - 10 kpc interval to match the area sampled in each annulus and then subtracting the results from the observed lfs .",
    "the dashed lines show a power - law that was fit to the number counts of the mean lf of objects with r@xmath35 between 4 and 8 kpc in the @xmath1 = 24.5 , 25.0 , and 25.5 bins .",
    "the y - intercept was then shifted to match the number counts in the @xmath1 = 24.5 , 25.0 , and 25.5 bins in each r@xmath35 interval .",
    "the drop in stellar density associated with the rgb discontinuity is clearly seen in figure 5 , where the lfs fall below the dashed lines when @xmath53 .",
    "the magnitude intervals above the rgb - tip are populated by agb stars ( figure 3 ) , which evolve at a faster pace than first ascent giants , and so have a lower space density .",
    "the dotted line shows the power - law computed from the rgb lf , but with the y - intercept shifted to account for a population of objects with a space density that is one fifth that of rgb stars in each distance interval ; such a difference in space density more - or - less matches agb number counts in old systems , and is roughly consistent with stellar evolution models ( e.g. davidge et al .",
    "2004 ; davidge 2006 ) .",
    "it should be emphasized that the dotted line is shown simply as a point of reference , and that the ratio of agb to rgb stars will depend on the star - forming history of a system .",
    "indeed , if an intermediate age population is present that accounts for more than a few percent of the total galaxy mass then the observed lf will likely fall above the dotted line ( see appendix ) .",
    "preliminary ages can be deduced from the brightness of the agb - tip , and predicted agb - tip brightnesses from the girardi et al .",
    "( 2004 ) isochrones for various values of log(t@xmath54 ) are indicated at the top of figure 5 .",

    "these ages are likely lower limits ( see below ) .",
    "there is no statistically robust evidence for an intermediate age population at larger distances , so that if an intermediate age population is present in the 6  8 kpc interval then it must have a space density such that the brightest agb stars do not stand out statistically against foreground and background objects .",
    "a caveat when considering ages estimated from the agb - tip brightness is that many of the most evolved agb stars are photometric variables",
    ". this variability biases age estimates to younger values , as variables near the peak of their light curves will have brightnesses that are comparable to those of younger , non - variable objects .",
    "in addition to variability driven by ionization effects , agb stars also show photometric variations due to thermal pulses .",
    "however , the photometric signatures of these events are very short - lived , affecting the luminosity only during @xmath58 of the time between pulses ( e.g. boothroyd & sackmann 1988 ) .",
    "hence , thermal pulses likely do not significantly bias agb - tip brightness measurements in external galaxies .",
    "the impact of variability on ages measured from the brightness of the agb - tip can be estimated from photometric observations of lpvs .",
    "reid , hughes , & glass ( 1995 ) summarize photometry of lpvs in the northern regions of the lmc , and the entries in their table 1 indicate that these stars have typical rms dispersions of @xmath59 magnitudes about their mean @xmath60 magnitudes .",
    "given that @xmath61 , then a comparison with the age scale at the top of figure 5 indicates that photometric variability may skew age estimates made from the agb - tip to younger values by a few tenths of a dex .",
    "the stars with @xmath62 and r@xmath35 between 3 and 6 kpc have number densities that place them 0.5  1.0 dex below the dotted line in figure 5 .",
    "moreover , when r@xmath63 kpc the agb component does not follow a single power - law ; rather , at the bright end the lf is more - or - less flat , but then steepens in the 1 magnitude interval above the rgb - tip , where the lfs intercept the dashed line .",
    "this change in the lf of agb stars suggests that there are _ at least _ two agb components with very different ages in ngc 5253 .",
    "based on the models described in the appendix , the majority of agb stars in the one magnitude interval immediately above the rgb - tip likely belong to the dominant old component , while those with @xmath62 originate from a younger population ( or younger populations ) .",
    "the fraction of the total mass in any radial interval that belongs to the intermediate age stars can be estimated by comparing the observed lfs with models . in the appendix ,",
    "model lfs are constructed by combining the lf of an intermediate age population that has an age @xmath64 gyr with the lf of an old population , and the results are shown in figure a1 .",
    "comparisons with figure a1 indicate that the number density of bright agb stars in ngc 5253 results from an intermediate age component that contributes only a few percent of the total stellar mass in the @xmath65 kpc interval . that the fractional contribution from intermediate age stars is small",
    "also indicates that the metallicity derived from the color of the rgb in  3.2.1 is likely not skewed by the age - metallicity degeneracy for rgb colors .    based on integrated colors obtained from aperture photometry ,",
    "caldwell & phillips ( 1989 ) argue that an intermediate age population is present in the outer regions of ngc 5253 .",
    "while studies of resolved stars provide the means of testing this hypothesis , the use of relatively rare agb stars as probes of stellar content in the present study limit the ability to draw firm conclusions about the spatial distribution of an intermediate age population to that portion of ngc 5253 with r@xmath66 kpc . at larger r@xmath35",
    "the use of agb stars as probes of stellar content becomes problematic .",

    "it can be seen from figure a1 that an intermediate age population that accounts for only 1% of the total stellar mass can produce a bright agb sequence that falls @xmath4 dex below the dotted lines in figures 5 and 9 .",
    "thus , the intermediate age populations in ngc 5253 and eso269g058 account for only a few percent of the total stellar mass",
    ". moreover , intermediate age populations need not be the dominant component in a stellar system in order to have a significant impact on the lf at intermediate brightnesses .",
    "if an intermediate age population accounts for only 10% of the stellar mass then the model lf becomes very smooth ; the discontinuity due to the rgb - tip largely disappears and the lf falls well above the dotted line in the brightness interval immediately above the rgb - tip .",
    "the presence of a prominent rgb - tip is thus also an indicator that stars with ages @xmath124 gyr make only a modest contribution to the total system mass ."
