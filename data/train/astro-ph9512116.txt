    "the hydrodynamics of gas photoionized by a central star has been widely studied @xcite .",
    "the gas is almost completely ionized close to the central source .",
    "the incident radiation field decreases with radius as a result of geometrical divergence and because atomic recombination always results in a small population of neutral atoms , which have finite opacity to the ionizing radiation . at some radius",
    "the gas becomes optically thick to the ionizing radiation , and beyond this radius it is predominantly neutral .",
    "the transition between ionized and neutral gas can be treated as a quasi - steady , plane - parallel front when it takes place over a small distance , compared with the radius of the region , and can be included in models of the global flow as a discontinuity @xcite .",
    "this is , in general , the appropriate case for ionization fronts ( if ) , since the opacity of the gas to ionizing radiation increases rapidly as a function of decreasing ionization . in this paper",
    ", we will distinguish recombination fronts ( rf ) from if as the case when the net flow of gas is from high ionization towards low ionization .",
    "rf can be broadened significantly by the advection of ionized gas , whereas if are generally only as thick as the ( small ) photon mean free path in neutral gas .",
    "newman  & axford  ( 1968  henceforth na ) studied the possible rf transitions in the context of stellar winds .",
    "they found that thin fronts were unlikely to occur in the winds of solar - type stars but might be important in the ejecta of planetary nebulae . in recent studies of ultracompact  regions",
    "@xcite , we have discussed the likely importance of ( thin ) rf in the flow structures . in particular , the likely coincidence of rf and sonic transitions raised some questions with regard to the work of na , which we address in this paper .",
    "the significance of the small class of steady solutions which pass through sonic transitions at the rf is perhaps not immediately apparent when only conditions close to the front are considered .",
    "however , such solutions become important when the front is included in the global solution of an initially subsonic divergent flow . here , the ballistic character of the supersonic solutions allows such ` winds ' to satisfy a wide range of external pressure boundary conditions , by the inclusion of a shock at some radius , for external pressures far lower than required if the solutions are subsonic at all radii @xcite .    as part of this study , we also address the apparent paradox that for conditions arbitrarily close to isothermal , the flow equations are singular at the _ adiabatic _ sound speed , whereas in the isothermal limit they are singular at the _ isothermal _ sound speed .    in the following sections , we give simple model equations for steady ionized gas flow , and derive a second order system which describes the structure of plane if and rf .",
    "a reorganisation of these equations suggests that for a narrow range of flow speeds in the region where the flow is nearly isothermal , a formal instability will prevent direct integration of the mach number equation in the downstream direction ; this is illustrated by a yet simpler model system . with this in mind",
    ", we return to rf , and find a range of transonic solutions which were inadvertently missed by na . in conclusion , we briefly discuss the relevance of these results to models of ultra compact  regions , and note possible implications of our study for the details of the evolution of conventional if in  regions at the time of shock generation .",
    "differential equations for the structure of ionization and recombination fronts are given by na ( * ? ? ?",
    "terms which account for photoionization and recombination , the radiative transfer of ionizing radiation and the heating and cooling of the gas are added to the basic equations of hydrodynamics .",
    "the processes included are ionization of atomic hydrogen , proton and electron recombination in the on - the - spot approximation , and an approximation to forbidden line cooling ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "mason   gives far more detailed models of the internal structure of several types of if , showing , for example , the ionization structure of o , n and ne . for the present paper ,",

    "the final term in equation   is a fit to forbidden line cooling @xcite , where @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "this fit is poor for gas temperatures above @xmath24 , but since temperatures as high as this are not found in the fronts that we are studying , and since we wish to compare our results to those of na , we defer a more accurate treatment of forbidden line cooling to the future .",
    "boundary conditions ( at small @xmath25 ) are of high ionization ( @xmath26 ) , high ionizing flux ( @xmath27 ) , equilibrium temperature ( @xmath28 ) and an arbitrary initial velocity ( @xmath29 ) .",

    ", we use this freedom to find an important class of rf overlooked by na  transonic fronts . in what follows ,",
    "we return to the full model equations  ( [ es : thinfront]a - c ) for the structure of rf .    in looking for transonic solutions , where @xmath44 and @xmath45 at @xmath46 ( so the flow can pass smoothly through the adiabatic sound speed ) , we have formulated a two - point boundary problem ( with conditions applied both far upstream in the  flow and at the sonic point ) .",
    "we have indicated that for initial conditions @xmath47 , the mach equation is unstable when integrated downstream .",
    "however , the ionization equation is highly unstable when integrated in the opposite , upstream direction .",
    "the vigorousness of these instabilities precludes the use of shooting methods .",
    "we therefore employed an iterative procedure to find the flow solution between @xmath48 and the adiabatic sonic point ( outside this region , downstream integration proceeds smoothly ) .",
    "an approximation to the ionization structure was determined by downstream integration . using this approximation to the ionization structure , the equation for",
    "the mach number was integrated upstream .",
    "this gave an updated model for the velocity and sound speed distributions , which were then used to derive an updated ionization structure : this procedure was iterated to convergence .",
    "the integrations were performed with a stiff ode integration package @xcite , using cubic spline interpolation of the results .",
    "the singular equations for @xmath39 and @xmath40 were split into non - singular equations in a dummy independent variable @xmath49 (  for @xmath50 , @xmath51 and @xmath52 ) .    in figure",

    "[ f : paths ] , we show the various classes of solution perturbed from the transonic case . the three curves on the plots show the adiabatic mach number , @xmath33 , sound speed , @xmath31 , and enthalpy @xmath57 as a function of flow velocity , @xmath55 . in figure",
    "[ f : paths]a , a solution with a weak isothermal shock is shown . from the initial point",
    "a , the flow cools and accelerates .",
    "however , an isothermal shock is triggered at point b , and the flow then heats again and slows .",
    "as the shock is resolved , the solution remains on the integral curves at all times  the part of the curve between points b and b@xmath58 might , however , be considered to represent the isothermal shock . beyond the shock , in the region @xmath59 ,",
    "the flow decelerates and cools further as the gas recombines .",
    "figure  [ f : paths]b illustrates a transonic solution , @xmath60 . here",
    ", the flow has been chosen to accelerate smoothly through sonic point s , at the maximum of the enthalpy @xmath57 . beyond the sonic point",
    ", the flow accelerates , cools and recombines to reach point c when it has become fully neutral .",
    "also illustrated is the solution which results when an adiabatic shock occurs at point b , taking the flow discontinuously to d. beyond d , the flow behaves in a similar fashion to that illustrated for the isothermal shock case in figure  [ f : paths]a , except that it does not reach quite such a low temperature as it approaches infinity .    in figure",
    "[ f : onetr ] we plot the flow mach number , @xmath33 , for a wide range of these solutions against the dimensionless ionizing flux , @xmath54 .",
    "upstream of the sonic point , both the physical solution ( which continues subsonically to @xmath61 ) and the unphysical solution ( which tends to @xmath46 with infinite gradient ) are shown . at large @xmath54",
    ", these solutions diverge very sharply , underlining the difficulty in finding transonic solutions by shooting methods . beyond the sonic point ,",
    "solutions are shown for initial conditions found downstream of steady adiabatic shocks ( shown dashed ) which are now allowed .",
    "these shocked solutions form a one - parameter family in combination with the physical solutions which diverge from the transonic solution upstream of the sonic point : as the stepping - off point of these solutions moves progressively downstream , the maximum in mach number of the divergent solutions becomes a cusp at the sonic point , and then a discontinuity (  shock ) .",
    "a range of final mach numbers results from this range of solutions .    in figure",
    "[ f : transitions ] we show the transition diagram from mach number @xmath62 in the  flow ( at the equilibrium temperature ) far upstream to mach number @xmath63 in the downstream  flow . in this diagram , we plot both the results we obtained following newman & axford , and the extra solutions found in this work .",
    "the short segment of the upper right hand branch of solutions shown bold , between dotted horizontal lines at the isothermal and adiabatic sound speeds , give the transonic solutions .",
    "additional regions of subsonic solutions to the top left result both from shocks downstream of the sonic point in transonic solutions , and from the use of isothermal , rather than adiabatic , shock relations for shocks forming in the  region .    to interpret this diagram , it is useful to remember that because the upstream flow is assumed to be at the fixed equilibrium temperature , the curves plotted are for a _ family _ of odes , parameterised by @xmath64 .",
    "isothermal shock conditions @xmath65 relate the values of @xmath62 where the odes are identical .",
    "the sudden appearance of extra solutions with @xmath66 at @xmath67 is allowed because this is the singular value where @xmath64 is a minimum .",
    "in this paper , we have completed the solution space found by newman & axford   for recombination front flows .",
    "careful treatment of the numerical integration for flow speeds between the isothermal and adiabatic sound speeds reveals an extra class of transonic solutions overlooked by these authors .",
    "close to the sonic point , the form of these solutions is similar to those found for any steady transonic flow , for instance a parker   wind . the steady , transonic solution can in general be found by integrating away from the sonic point .",
    "however , inclusion of ionization equilibrium means that we must treat a two - point boundary value problem .",
    "the strength of the instability discussed above adds significantly to the usual difficulties integrating the mach number equation towards a nodal solution , rendering shooting methods impractical and allowing transonic solutions to be easily overlooked .",
    "we overcome this difficulty with an iterative scheme , integrating separate equations in the upstream and downstream directions .",
    "the instability in downstream integration adds a free parameter to the solution , resolving the conceptual difficulty of how , as the initial mach number of our solution increases through isothermal mach 1 , the flow solution changes from an initial - value to a two - point boundary problem .",
    "moreover , these solutions give some insight into the apparent paradox that , for finite cooling , the singularity in steady flow equations is at the adiabatic sound speed , whereas in a strictly isothermal flow it is at the isothermal sound speed .",
    "we find that , where thermal timescales are short in an accelerating flow , a ` wide ' range of solutions near the adiabatic sound speed derive from a ` few ' at the isothermal sound speed : it is apparent that in the limit , these ` few ' solutions can become the singular isothermal transonic solution .    in the theory of multifluid mhd shocks , smooth",
    "transonic solutions are also found for strong cooling @xcite . in these shocks , the solution adapts to pass through a downstream ( saddle type ) sonic point using the freedom of manoeuvre allowed by an upstream viscous subshock ( j - type ) or nodal sonic point ( c@xmath68-type ) , rather than as discussed here .",
    "there has been little discussion of rf since the work of na , since in the winds of main sequence stars they will occur , if at all , at large radii , and thus at densities and temperatures so low that they will be broadened beyond recognition by advection .",
    "the interstellar medium in the vicinity of strongly ionizing stars does not generally reach an equilibrium state in the stellar lifetime ",
    "an if is still being driven out into the surrounding medium when the star dies . however , in recent work we have discussed how a near - equilibrium state may found in the youngest of these stars , observed as ultra compact regions @xcite .",
    "mass loading in the near vicinity of the young stars traps the if at a scale of @xmath69 , turning it into a rf through which gas passes at high density . in some objects ,",
    "the mass - loaded stellar wind may remain supersonic at all radii  however , if the mass loading is strong enough the flow will shock .",
    "detailed hydrodynamical simulations ( williams , redman & dyson , in preparation ) confirm that transonic rf are frequently a component of the equilibrium flow .",
    "such regions may be a significant source for partially ionized gas in the interstellar medium .",
    "we note briefly that the discussion here also applies to the structure of  region if as they undergo the transition from r - type to d - type @xcite .",
    "a shock first forms , as a ( quasi- ) steady part of the if structure , at the minimum of the adiabatic mach number in the r - type front when this reaches unity ; initially , the post - shock flow is in the unstable range . in this region , however , the heating and cooling in the transonic flow are rather weak . more significantly , as the resultant strong d - type front weakens , the velocity relative to the front downstream in the  region will eventually reach the unstable range . in this case",
    ", there is a significant chance that solutions will be missed in steady - state integrations .",
    "we thank robert cannon , sam falle , franz kahn and matt redman for helpful discussions .",
