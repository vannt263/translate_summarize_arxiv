    "the first important remark is that the free energy critical exponent ( call it @xmath136 , so that @xmath137 , cf . )",
    "is different both from the critical exponent of the homogeneous model : @xmath138 ( cf .",
    "proposition [ homo1 ] ) and from that of the disordered model with i.i.d .  disorder . in the latter the critical exponent equals @xmath139 if @xmath140 and @xmath141 small ( regime of irrelevant disorder @xcite ) and in all cases ( every @xmath142 ) one observes a disorder induced _ smoothing _ of the free - energy curve near the critical point that implies @xmath143 when it exists @xcite ( in contrast , remark that the critical exponent in can be smaller than @xmath144 for our correlated model ) . always concerning the critical exponent , let us also add that up to now precise asymptotics of the free - energy ( close to the critical point ) for pinning models had been proved only for the case of homogeneous ( or weakly inhomogeneous , i.e.  periodic ) environment ( proposition [ homo1 ] ) , and for the mentioned case of i.i.d .  environment , @xmath140 and @xmath141 small @xcite ( we let aside @xcite where it is proved that first order transition occurs for a very special model ) .    a second important observation concerns the value of the critical point . in our model , it equals zero for the homogeneous model ( and therefore for the annealed one ) but also for the quenched model ( for every @xmath145 ) .",
    "this is in contrast with what happens for i.i.d .",
    "random environment : in that case , the critical point of the annealed model equals @xmath146 $ ] .",
    "also , for i.i.d .  environment it is a crucial issue to know whether the critical point @xmath147 of the quenched model coincides or not with @xmath148 : one has @xmath149 if @xmath150 , @xmath141 small @xcite and @xmath151 if @xmath152 ( every @xmath153 , with sharp bounds on their difference in the limit of @xmath141 small @xcite ) ; another situation where @xmath151 is @xmath150 , @xmath141 large @xcite .    finally , we make some observations concerning the behavior of the trajectories at the critical point given by theorem [ ncontacts ] .",

    "note that up to now , for i.i.d .",
    "disordered pinning models , the best general bound one has for the number of contact points in the delocalized phase is @xmath155 ( * ? ? ?",

    "finite - range _ disorder correlations is studied .",
    "let us also mention that the authors of @xcite consider a random walk that is pinned on a second ( quenched ) random walk : this can also be seen as an example of a pinning model in a correlated environment . in both of this cases , however , the results one finds are similar to the ones of the i.i.d . environment case .",
    "we have chosen to constrain ourselves only to a very particular setup for the sake on simplicity , however our results should hold with much greater generality for correlated environment @xmath156 .",
    "we give in this section an idea on the strategy the polymer adopts under the measure @xmath19 , this undersanding clarifying the schemes of the proofs of theorems [ freee ] and [ ncontacts ] .",
    "the proof of theorem [ freee ] gives the right bounds on the free energy , but also a heuristic understanding of the typical behavior of the trajectories under the measure @xmath157 .",
    "the idea is that the polymer tends to pin on the regions where @xmath158 , but only those of length larger than @xmath159 , whereas they are repelled from the interface by any other region .",
    "thus the idea to prove theorem [ freee ] is to estimate the contribution of all these different kinds of regions to the partition function . for the lower bound the strategy of targeting only regions of length larger than @xmath160",
    "already gives the right result . to get the upper bound",
    ", one has to control the contribution of all the possible trajectories .",
    "roughly , the argument is that one uses a coarse - graining argument to cut the system into blocks of finite size , and sees that if one block does not contain a region of length larger than @xmath160 it does not contribute to the partition function .",
    "a consequence of this observation is that the behavior of the free - energy near the critical point depends on the frequency of occurrence of regions of length @xmath161 where @xmath162 .",
    "when @xmath163 is close to one , these regions occur relatively frequently , and for this reason the critical exponent for the free - energy in our model is close to the one of the homogeneous model .",
    "the two exponents get more and more different when @xmath163 grows and this type of regions becomes more rare .",
    "now , let us explain how we intend to prove theorem [ ncontacts ] and proposition  [ prop : tail ] .",
    "we bound from above the probability of having exactly @xmath164 contacts before @xmath34 under the measure @xmath165 by considering the contribution of the different strategies for the polymer trajectory . for a trajectory @xmath5 , let @xmath166 be the number of @xmath108-renewal stretches ( we call @xmath108-stretch a segment of the type @xmath167 $ ] ) visited by @xmath5 : @xmath168 , j\\in({\\widehat}\\tau_{i } , { \\widehat}\\tau_{i+1}]\\}|.\\ ] ] we split the set of trajectories such that @xmath169|=a\\}$ ] into two cases    *",

    "however , one has to be careful in the way of using borel - cantelli lemma .    for the second type of trajectories , on the other hand",
    ", we observe that in order not to visit many @xmath108-stretches , one has to put a lot of contacts in very few @xmath108-stretches , and this strategy has a large entropic cost ( which is a priori not that easy to control ) . the most convenient way of doing this is to target sufficiently large stretches and put the contacts there . the key idea to estimate this is to realize that in order to visit the long stretches without having too many contacts before , @xmath5 has to grow much faster that it would typically do , in the sense that @xmath176 has to be larger than @xmath177 ( cf .",
    "lemmas [ pasmieu ] and [ pasmieu2 ] ) , which is much larger than what it would typically be , that is , @xmath178 .",
    "we get this thanks to lemma [ lem : boundmax ] which says that the first @xmath108-stretch of size @xmath179 occurs at distance approximately @xmath180 from the origin .",
