    "ngc 5897 ( c1514 - 208 ) is a moderately metal poor globular cluster with [ fe / h ] = @xmath3 ( harris 1996 ) .",
    "color - magnitude diagrams for ngc 5897 have been published by sandage & katem ( 1968 , hereafter sk ) , ferraro et al .",
    "( 1992 ) , sarajedini ( 1992 ) and testa et al .",
    "( 2001 ) and all of them show that the horizontal branch is predominantly blue .",
    "the cluster has nine known variable stars : seven rr lyrae ( wehlau 1990 , hereafter w90 ) , one red variable ( eggen 1972 ) and one sx phe ( wehlau et al . 1996 ) .",
    "w90 has shown that the rr lyrae variables have a very unusual period distribution ; three have periods between 0797 and 0856 , two at 0420 and 0454 and two more at 0342 and 0349 . as a result ,",
    "the mean period of the three rrab variables is 0828 .",
    "the fact that the periods of the rrab variables in ngc 5897 are longer than 060 is not unusual because clement et al .",
    "( 2001 ) have shown that for all clusters more metal poor than @xmath4 , the mean period of the rrab stars is greater than 060 .",
    "what is unusual , however , is that @xmath5 is greater than 080 ; the next longest @xmath5 for a metal poor cluster is 0708 for ngc 4833 which has [ fe / h]@xmath6 of 071 and 076 , respectively , for their rr lyrae variables .",
    "the variables in these two clusters seem to be brighter than solar neighbourhood field rr lyrae stars of comparable [ fe / h ] , but the reason for this is not yet fully understood . ]",
    "another curious feature of ngc 5897 is the fact that there appear to be nonvariable horizontal branch stars located in its rr lyrae gap . both sk and",
    "w90 have shown that the stars sk 116 and sk 174 have colors and magnitudes comparable to the rrc stars and that sk 120 lies in the instability strip well to the red of the rrc stars and to the blue of the rrab stars .",
    "smith ( 1985 ) made a spectroscopic study of sk 120 and concluded that the star is probably a cluster member .",
    "we therefore decided it would be worthwhile to observe ngc 5897 with a ccd detector .",
    "it may turn out that some of these ` apparent ' nonvariable stars are in fact varying , but with an amplitude lower than can be readily detected in photographic studies .",
    "all of the published photometric studies of the rr lyrae variables in ngc 5897 , with the exception of a set of ccd observations of v2 by wehlau et al .",
    "( 1996 ) , are based on photographic data .",
    "our investigation is based on 526 ccd frames obtained with the university of toronto s 61 cm ( @xmath7 ) helen sawyer hogg ( hsh ) telescope at the las campanas observatory of the carnegie institution of washington .",
    "the observations were made on six consecutive nights ( may 1 to 6 , 1997 ) with the kodak kaf-4200 ccd system that horch _ et al .",
    "( 1997 ) and slawson _ et al .",
    "( 1999 ) used with the same telescope in february 1997 .",
    "the chip has 9 @xmath8 m square pixels arranged in a 2033@xmath92048 format , but before readout , the data were binned @xmath10 so that the effective pixel size for our data was 18 @xmath8 m square .",
    "the field of view ( shown in figure 1 ) is approximately @xmath11 arcminutes and includes all of the rr lyrae variables studied by w90 .",
    "the frames were obtained through a v filter and all of the exposure times were 2 minutes .",
    "these short exposures were necessary because of severe tracking problems with the telescope . _ _    the frames were cleaned using iraf .",
    "then , for the photometric reductions , we combined the frames in groups of three , so that we could obtain photometry with a precision of @xmath12 mag ( or better ) at v@xmath13 , the level of the horizontal branch . in table 1 , we list a sample of the data obtained on the night of may 1 to illustrate how the frames were combined .",
    "the photometric reductions were carried out using the iraf versions of daophot - ii and allstar - ii and the stand - alone version of stetson s ( 1987 , 1993 , 1994 ) allframe code .",
    "approximately 1000 stars were identified on each frame .    in order to convert our instrumental magnitudes to standard v magnitudes",
    ", we used the photometry of sk . since none of their photoelectric standards were in the field shown in figure 1 , we obtained 7 frames on the night of may 4 with the telescope offset to a position @xmath14 arcminutes further north . with this offset",
    ", we were able to include the sk photoelectric standard stars a , c , e , k , m , n , o and p in the field of view .",
    "we determined the instrumental magnitudes for the stars that were in the area overlapping the two fields on the same magnitude scale as the ` offset ' frames and then calculated magnitudes on the same scale for all of the program stars .",
    "finally , the transformation from instrumental to standard v magnitudes was derived for sk s photoelectic standards and then applied to all of the other stars .",
    "the known rr lyrae variables were identified and found to have a mean @xmath1 magnitude of @xmath15 . to search for additional rr lyrae variables",
    ", we examined the observations for all of the stars with mean @xmath1 magnitude between @xmath16 and @xmath17 ( approximately 150 stars ) .",
    "we plotted light curves to check for periodic variations . as a result",
    ", four new rr lyrae variables were identified .",
    "we have numbered them v10 to v13 and they are labelled in figure 1 .",
    "this increases the total number of known rr lyrae variables in ngc 5897 from seven to eleven . in order to determine the periods for the new variables , we used stellingwerf s ( 1978 ) phase dispersion minimization technique to estimate an approximate value and then made small adjustments so that the observations for the different nights would be well aligned .",
    "our adopted periods are listed in table 2 .",
    "for the known variables , we adopted the periods listed by w90 .",
    "also included in the table are the sk number , the x , y position on the frame in pixels , the x , y position relative to the cluster center in arcseconds on the system of sawyer hogg ( 1973 ) , the mean @xmath1 magnitude , the @xmath1 amplitude along with the standard deviation of the fit to equation ( 1 ) and the fourier phase differences @xmath18 , @xmath19 along with their standard errors .",
    "the mean magnitudes and amplitudes were derived from a fit to a fourier series of the form : @xmath20 where @xmath0 is ( @xmath21/period ) .",
    "the fourier phase differences ( @xmath22 ) are ( @xmath23 ) from equation ( 1 ) . for each star",
    ", the epoch was taken as hjd @xmath24 so that @xmath25 in the equation refers to ( hjd@xmath26 ) and hjd represents the mean heliocentric julian date of the observation ( in this case , the combination of three frames ) .",
    "light curves , arranged in order of increasing period , are shown in figure 2 .",
    "a sample of the observations for v1 is shown in table 3 .",
    "all of the observations for v1 - 3 , v6 - 8 and v10 - 13 are presented in the electronic version of the table .",
    "v4 was not included in our study because its image was blended with that of another star and as a result we were unable to obtain photometry with the desired precision .",
    "in fact , many of the frames could not be used to study the other variables either , because of the tracking problems .",
    "it turns out that two of the new variables , v11 and v13 are sk 120 and sk 116 respectively , apparent nonvariable stars that lie in or near the rr lyrae gap according to sk and w90 .",
    "since the @xmath1 amplitudes for these two stars are less than @xmath27 mag , they were not detected in photographic studies of the cluster .",
    "we also examined the magnitudes for sk 174 , a star that w90 found to be near the blue edge of the instability strip , but no systematic variation was detected .",
    "its mean @xmath1 magnitude is @xmath28 with a standard deviation of @xmath29 . in comparison , the standard deviation of the previously known variables ranged from @xmath30 for v8 to @xmath31 for v1 .",
    "the other two new variables , v10 and v12 , have larger amplitudes , but their periods are close to simple fractions of a day .",
    "this probably accounts for the fact that they were not discovered previously .",
    "in fact , even in the present study , the phase coverage for v10 ( p@xmath3205 ) is incomplete .",
    "we considered the possibility that v10 has a period twice as long , but concluded this to be unlikely .",
    "the shape of its light curve is similar to that of three @xmath0 centauri variables with similar periods , v47 , v68 and v123 ( ogle i d 185 , 73 and 169 ) , observed by kaluzny et al .",
    "( 1997 , hereafter k97 ) .",
    "all of these stars have an inflection on the rising branch of their light curves , just before maximum light .",
    "furthermore , the @xmath0 cen stars for which k97 found periods of about 1 day are all more than @xmath33 mag brighter than the rr lyrae variables .",
    "since v10 is only @xmath2 magnitudes brighter than the mean @xmath34 for the other variables , we assume that our adopted period is the correct one .",
    "the period - luminosity and period - amplitude relations are plotted in figure 3 . in the upper panel of the diagram",
    ", the stars separate into three separate regions which we interprete to be due to different modes of pulsation : fundamental , first and second - overtone .",
    "w90 has already noted that the variables with periods @xmath32034 may be pulsating in the second - overtone mode",
    ". another interesting feature of figure 3 is its similarity to the p - l and p - a plots that clement & rowe ( 2000 , hereafter cr ) made for the @xmath0 centauri variables observed by k97 . to illustrate this , we plot in figure 4 the fourier phase differences @xmath18",
    ", @xmath19 and the @xmath1 amplitude against @xmath35 for the ngc 5897 variables and include the @xmath0 cen variables that cr considered to belong to the oosterhoff ( 1939 , 1944 ) type ii class ( i.e. @xmath36 for the fundamental mode and @xmath37 for the overtone modes ) . also included is star 96 ( @xmath38 , @xmath39 ) of k97 which was not included in cr s study .    in figure 4 , it can be readily seen that the rrab stars v1 and v6 have periods , fourier phase differences and amplitudes comparable to some of the @xmath0 cen oosterhoff type ii fundamental mode pulsators .",
    "what is striking though is that v1 and v6 have longer periods and hence lower amplitudes than most of the @xmath0 cen stars .",
    "a similar trend can be seen among the first - overtone variables .",
    "both v2 and v11 , with periods @xmath32046 ( @xmath40 ) , have much lower amplitudes than most of the @xmath0 cen first - overtone pulsators .",
    "the case of v2 is particularly interesting because w90 found an increase in period and a decrease in amplitude for this star between the 1950s and the 1980s .",
    "the @xmath1 amplitude we have derived for v2 ( @xmath41 mag ) is comparable to her lower , more recent value ( @xmath42 mag ) , but the @xmath1 amplitude that she derived for the 1956 - 1966 observations was @xmath43 mag , similar to the amplitudes of the @xmath0 cen first - overtone variables .",
    "v2 seems to have changed significantly during the last 50 years .",
    "we analysed our observations to search for evidence that v2 is in the process of mode switching . to do this",
    ", we measured the residuals to the light curve and searched for periods in the range between 025 and 065 .",
    "no oscillations with an amplitude greater than @xmath44 mag were detected for any period in the interval .",
    "if the star were in the process of changing from first - overtone to fundamental mode pulsation , we would have expected to detect oscillations with a period @xmath32060 .",
    "we therefore conclude that if v2 is in the process of switching modes , the fundamental mode oscillations are still very weak .    the four stars with p@xmath32034 ( v7 , v8 , v12 and v13 ) have periods and amplitudes comparable to some of the @xmath0 cen second - overtone variables , but , like the rrab stars , they seem to congregate at the long period end of the sequence in the p - a plot . cr found that several of the second - overtone variables in @xmath0 cen exhibited non - radial pulsations .",
    "we performed a period search on the residuals to the light curves of the above - mentioned four stars in an attempt to search for non - radial pulsations .",
    "no oscillations with amplitudes greater than @xmath44 mag were detected in any of them .",
    "however , the amplitude of the non - radial pulsation detected by cr for star 186 in @xmath0 cen was @xmath45 mag , much higher than this .",
    "as noted previously , the light curve for v10 has a structure similar to the light curves of v47 , v68 and v123 in @xmath0 cen and we suggest that it might be an anomalous cepheid .",
    "the properties of anomalous cepheids ( acs ) have been discussed by nemec et al .",
    "( 1994 , hereafter n94 ) .",
    "they are located in the cepheid instability strip and are more luminous than horizontal branch stars , but they tend to have shorter periods than globular cluster cepheids because they are more massive .",
    "they are probably coalesced binary stars and may be related to blue stragglers .",
    "most of the known acs occur in nearby dwarf galaxies , but n94 pointed out that v68 in @xmath0 cen might be an ac pulsating in the fundamental mode .",
    "cen might be an ac candidate , but in the meantime , van leeuwen et al .",
    "( 2000 ) have shown that v84 is not a member of @xmath0 cen .",
    "] we assume that if v68 is an ac , then v47 and v123 in @xmath0 cen should also be classified as acs and if clusters with blue stragglers are more likely to contain acs , then it is plausible that there are acs in ngc 5897 as well .",
    "testa et al .",
    "( 2001 ) pointed out that the cluster has a sparse , but clearly visible population of blue stragglers .",
    "if v10 is an ac , then v3 could be one as well .",
    "n94 derived a slope for the period luminosity relation for ac variables : @xmath46 and if both v3 and v10 are acs , v3 should be @xmath47 mag fainter than v10 .",
    "the actual difference is @xmath48 mag , in reasonable agreement with the prediction of n94 .",
    "another possibility raised by n94 is that stars like this might be first - overtone population ii cepheids .",
    "thus , there is still some doubt about the true nature of v3 and v10 .",
    "our study reinforces the conclusion that the period distribution of the rr lyrae variables in ngc 5897 is unusual .",
    "w90 plotted a period - frequency distribution that demonstrated that the cluster has no variables with periods between 045 and 075 where the majority of rrab variables are found in other clusters .",
    "although we have discovered four new variables in this investigation , and two of them have periods between 045 and 050 , neither is an rrab star .",
    "furthermore , there are still no known variables with periods between 050 and 075 and most cluster rrab stars have periods in this range .",
