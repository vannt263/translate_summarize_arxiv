    "the computational algorithm powered by quantum mechanics , on the one hand , has posed a serious threat to the classical cryptosystem@xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "quantum cryptography allows for secure sharing of private keys .",
    "ever since the pioneering works by bennet , brassard , and ekert@xcite , a great number of new quantum key distribution ( qkd ) protocols have been proposed to enhance the security and efficiency under non - idealistic situations and to incorporate new ideas@xcite . in particular , bostrm and felbinger@xcite",
    "recently proposed the so - called _ ping - pong protocol_. the protocol is interesting in that it enables direct communication deterministically and without classical communications ( except for checking eavesdropping ) .",
    "although the original protocol turned out to be insecure in the case of lossy channels@xcite and against blind attacks without eavesdropping@xcite , the idea still survives in a recent modified version@xcite .    in the ping - pong protocol@xcite , bob sends a qubit to alice , alice performs a unitary operation on it with a random probability @xmath0 and send it back to bob , and finally bob make a measurement on it . the unitary operation by alice ( if ever performed ) transforms the initial state of the qubit to a state orthogonal to the initial state",
    "this enables bob to read alice s massage directly .",
    "putting another way , the unitary operation is performed conditioned on the _ classical _ information ( @xmath1 or @xmath2 ) that alice wants to send to bob",
    ". a conceptually interesting question would be , `` what if we perform the unitary operation conditioned on the _ quantum state _ of another qubit ? '' in this work , we propose a new qkd protocol implementing this idea and address the security issues of it .",
    "the protocol is explained in section  [ sec : protocol ] .",
    "we will show in sections  [ sec : securityproof ] and [ sec : impersonation ] that the protocol is secure against eavesdropping for ideal single - photon source and robust against impersonation attacks .",
    "the protocol turns out to be insecure when the photon source produces more than two photons ; this will be analyzed in section  [ sec : pns ] .",

    "( 1 ) to start the @xmath18th iteration of the protocol , alice and bob first prepare their home qubits @xmath4 and @xmath19 , respectively , in the state @xmath20@xcite .

    "it follows from the ghz - like structure of the states in eqs .",
    "( [ paper::eq:4 ] ) and ( [ paper::eq:6 ] ) .",
    "step 9 is not essential .",
    "it can be removed with a minor change in step 10 .    before analyzing the security of the protocol",
    ", we point out a few interesting features of the protocol .",
    "first , the travel qubit is always in a maximally entangled states with the home qubit(s ) whenever exposed to eavesdropping .",
    "this is the essential feature of the protocol that provides the protocol with the security .",
    "second , at the key sharing stage no classical communication is necessary .",
    "the key is shared only through the quantum channel@xcite .",
    "this is also closely related to the security of the protocol .",
    "third , two bits are generated out of one iteration and they have the common security fate . if the first bit has been tampered by eavesdropping or noise in the channel , the security of the second bit is not guaranteed either .",
    "let us analyze general attacks from a third party in case the photon source generates single photon .",
    "we closely follow the lines in ref.@xcite . as usual , eve is assumed to be an almighty eavesdropper limited only by the law of physics .",
    "the most general ( assuming that eve does not know alice s choice of basis ) operation @xmath49 eve can do on the travel qubit @xmath3 can be written as @xmath50 and @xmath51 where the states @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 , and @xmath55 of the ancilla @xmath56 are normalized , but not orthogonal to each other . without loss of generality , we can set @xmath57 , from the unitarity of @xmath58@xcite .",
    "the basis @xmath59 for @xmath3 is an arbitrary choice made by eve .",
    "recall that the angle @xmath22 has been chosen randomly for each travel qubit @xmath3 and is never announced to the public ; this is one of the biggest differences of our protocol both from the bb84-type and ping - pong - type protocols .",
    "when @xmath60 , eve can not distinguish between @xmath61 and @xmath62 by any measurement on her ancillae . in this case , eve can acquire no more information than no attack is performed .",
    "therefore , a minimal requirement for eve s strategy is that such an operation as gives no information at all to her should not be detected by the legitimate partners ( alice and bob ) .",
    "this can be achieved if eve does not disturb travel qubits .",
    "it gives the condition , @xmath63 and @xmath64 . in passing ,",
    "we note that @xmath65 corresponds to an intercept - and - resend attack .",
    "having this ( @xmath63 and @xmath64 ) in mind , we rewrite the attack operation on the travel qubit as @xmath66 and @xmath67 where @xmath68 .    on @xmath3 s way from bob back to alice",
    ", eve can perform another similar attack @xmath69 with a new ancilla @xmath70 . with the same requirement as in @xmath49 , the attack operation @xmath69 takes the simple form @xmath71 and @xmath72",
    "since our protocol is symmetric between alice and bob , eve s attack operations @xmath73 and @xmath74 on bob s travel qubit @xmath29 can be written , analogously to @xmath49 and @xmath69 , with respect to new ancillae @xmath75 and @xmath76",
    ". the optimal eve s attack will be the symmetric one such that @xmath77 and @xmath78 .",
    "the angle @xmath79 relates bob s choice @xmath80 and eve s choice @xmath59 for the basis for @xmath29 .",
    "after all the procedures by alice and bob , eve performs a collective measurement on her ancillae @xmath56 , @xmath70 , @xmath75 , and @xmath76 . from the measurement result",
    ", she extracts the information about the state of alice s home qubit @xmath4 and bob s @xmath19 ; namely , the information about the results of the qfr on the travel qubits @xmath3 and @xmath29 .",
    "the information is eventually the information about the key values shared by alice and bob .",
    "the operations @xmath49 , @xmath69 , @xmath73 , and @xmath74 by eve inevitably disturb the quantum state of the travel qubit @xmath3 and @xmath29 . simply comparing the test key bits ( step 12 of the protocol ) ,",
    "alice and bob may detect the attack .",
    "the detection probability @xmath81 depends on the angle differences @xmath82 and @xmath83 .",
    "since the angles @xmath82 and @xmath83 are randomly distributed , the detection probability is given by @xmath84 where @xmath85 and @xmath86 .",
    "the maximum value of @xmath81 is 3/8 corresponding to the intercept - and - resend attack(@xmath87 ) .",
    "let us suppose that the initial state prepared by alice and bob is given by @xmath88 after all attacks the final state is given by    @xmath89    with @xmath90 @xmath91 @xmath92 @xmath93 @xmath94 and @xmath95 the states @xmath96 , @xmath97 , @xmath98 , @xmath99 , @xmath100 , and @xmath101 are defined analogously ( with @xmath102 replaced by @xmath103 ) .",
    "equation  ( [ eq : attackfinal ] ) clearly reveals how eve can extract the information about the quantum state of the alice s and bob s home qubits @xmath4 and @xmath19 , respectively .",
    "for example , eve can infer the state @xmath104 on bob s home qubit @xmath19 if she finds her ancilla qubits @xmath56 and @xmath70 in the collective state @xmath105 , @xmath106 , or @xmath107 .",
    "likewise , eve infers the state @xmath108 if she finds @xmath56 and @xmath70 in the state @xmath109 , @xmath110 , or @xmath111 .",
    "the state of alice s home qubit @xmath4 can be inferred analogously from the ancillae @xmath75 and @xmath76 .",
    "the remaining question for eve would be , for example , how to distinguish the states @xmath105 , @xmath106 , and @xmath107 from @xmath109 , @xmath110 , and @xmath111 .",
    "to this end , we first note that @xmath112 and that @xmath113 therefore , eve s best policy will be first to exploit the orthogonal subspaces containing @xmath105 and @xmath109 , respectively , and then to distinguish the non - orthogonal states , namely @xmath106 and @xmath107 from @xmath110 and @xmath111 , within these subspaces .",
    "further , defining the normalized overlap @xmath114 ( @xmath115 ) , we have the inequalities @xmath116 and @xmath117 namely , the states @xmath106 and @xmath107 can be distinguished worse from @xmath110 and @xmath111 than any two states with the mutual overlap of @xmath118 can be distinguished from each other .",
    "based on this observation , we analyze the worst case , where @xmath119 further , it is clear that the optimal attack for eve is the balanced one @xcite , for which @xmath120 , and hereafter we focus on the balanced case .",
    "putting all the above observations together and with lengthy algebra , one can calculate the mutual information @xmath121 between alice and bob and @xmath122 [ or @xmath123 between alice ( or bob ) and eve ; note that because of the symmetry in our protocol , @xmath124 .",
    "they are given by @xmath125 and @xmath126 respectively .",
    "@xmath81 in eq .",
    "( [ qkd::eq:2 ] ) is the detection probability [ see eq .",

    "the mutual information @xmath121 and @xmath122 are plotted as functions of the detection probability @xmath81 in fig .",
    "[ fig:4 ] .",
    "the maximum information between alice and eve occurs at @xmath130 , which is less than the maximum detection probability ( @xmath131 ) corresponding to the intercept - and - resend attack .",
    "this means that the intercept - and - resend attack is not an optimal attack for eve . @xmath121 and",
    "@xmath122 becomes equal for the detection probability @xmath132 .",
    "this detection probability is greater than @xmath133 for the ping - pong protocol @xcite and @xmath134 for bb84 protocol .    , for general incoherent attacks against our protocol .",
    "the solid ( dashed ) line represents the mutual information @xmath121 [ @xmath122 ] between alice and bob ( alice and eve ) .",
    "( b ) @xmath136 as a function of @xmath81 for our protocol ( solid line ) and for the bb84 protocol ( dashed line ) . for our protocol",

    "@xcite to prove the security of our protocol against collective attacks@xcite .",
    "an argument for the security against the most general coherent attacks@xcite is given below .",
    "after alice and bob repeats the protocol @xmath18 times to share a key of length of @xmath137 bits , the sum of the mutual information @xmath121 and @xmath122 should be less than @xmath137 , i.e. , @xmath138 equivalently speaking , @xmath139 per single qubit .",
    "this is because eve and bob can not acquire more information than is sent out mutually by alice and bob whatever measurement is performed by eve .",
    "therefore , in order that @xmath140 ( theorem 1 in ref .",
    "@xcite ) , it suffices to have @xmath141 . since @xmath142,$ ] @xmath81 is required to be less than 0.110028 , approximately 11 % , which is the upper bound for the bb84 protocol@xcite .",
    "this proves that our protocol is _ at least _ as secure as the bb84 protocol against collective attacks .",
    "the above lines of proof applies only for collective attacks .",
    "however , it has been argued that the collective attack may be the optimal one of the most general coherent attacks@xcite .",
    "it is also interesting to note that for incoherent attacks , @xmath122 in eq .",
    "( [ qkd::eq:3 ] ) is significantly restricted and hence the sum @xmath136 per single qubit is far less than 1 ; cf .",
    "( [ qkd::eq:4 ] ) .",
    "this is demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ fig:4 ] ( b ) comparing the sum for the bb84 protocol and for ours .",
    "it suggest that the upper bound @xmath143 % may be reduced further with proper analysis of the restriction on the possible measurements by eve .",
    "more detailed analysis of the security of our protocol against the coherent attacks should therefore be an interesting topic for further studies in the future .",
    "in our protocol , alice sends a qubit to bob and gets it back .",
    "so does bob with another travel qubit .",
    "it is possible for eve to intercept the channel and pretend to be her / his legitimate partner to each .",
    "one can think of two different ways of impersonation attack . in the first method",
    "[ see fig .",
    "[ fig:5](a ) ] , eve uses two home qubits of her own .",
    "eve can use one of the two to share a perfect key with alice following the procedures of the protocol in section  [ sec : protocol ] , and the other to share another key with bob .",
    "however , the keys so generated to alice and bob are independent and have no correlation .",
    "therefore , by bit verification procedure , this attack can be detected with probability @xmath144 .    in the second method",
    "[ see fig .",
    "[ fig:5](b ) ] , eve uses only one home qubit @xmath56 of her own , which is used for the interaction with both alice and bob . in this case , the total wave function of the whole qubits is given by @xmath145 ( not normalized ) , where the product states are arranged such as @xmath146 ( @xmath75 is the travel qubit of eve s ) .",
    "it then follows immediately that the detection probability of this attack is still @xmath144 .",
    "finally , we investigate the security of the protocol against the photon number splitting attack ( pns ) .",
    "( we note that the security analysis in the case of lossy channel is essentially the same as that against the pns attack . )",
    "let us suppose that the photon source generate three photons ( the discussion can be trivially generalized to the case of more photons ; see below ) .",
    "eve takes one photon ( say @xmath147 ) on the quantum channel from alice to bob and another ( @xmath148 ) on the channel back to alice from bob ; see fig .",
    "[ fig:6 ] .",
    "only photon @xmath3 finally arrives at alice s hand .",
    "similarly , eve takes photons @xmath149 and @xmath150 out of the photons from bob .",
    "bob receives back only @xmath29 .",
    "the final state of the whole photons and home qubits are given by @xmath151 where the product states have been denoted according to the arrangement of the qubits such as @xmath152 .",
    "eve waits until alice and bob performs projective measurement on their travel qubits @xmath3 and @xmath29 .",
    "then the wave function in eq .",
    "( [ pns::eq:1 ] ) collapses into either @xmath153 or @xmath154 therefore , eve can know the key without being detected simply by checking whether @xmath155 ( alice and bob share the key @xmath1 ) @xmath156 ( alice and bob share the key @xmath2 ) , where @xmath157 and @xmath158 .",
    "this test can be easily done , for example , using an interferometer .",
    "the discuss is trivially generalized to the case of even more photons .",
    "it is enough for eve to steal two photons from alice and another two from bob .",
    "one may be tempted to overcome this problem using four home qubits ( two for alice and two for bob ) as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig:7 ] .",
    "this scheme `` hides '' by means of entanglement the output state of @xmath3 and @xmath29 even after alice and bob performs projective measurements on @xmath3 and @xmath29 .",
    "however , following the similar lines as above , the total wave function of the whole qubits is given by    @xmath159    arranging the product states such as @xmath160 therefore , in order to know the key , all eve has to do is to distinguish the bell state @xmath161 from @xmath162 , which is as easy as the test for the two - home - qubit scheme analyzed above .",
    "the parametric faraday rotation of photon polarization by atomic spins have been widely used in quantum optics and atomic physics .",
    "for example , it has been used for quantum non - demolition measurement of the atomic spin@xcite . however , because of the weak atom - photon interaction , the faraday rotation angle is usually quite small ( several degrees ) . to enhance the atom - photon interaction to achieve the rotation angle of @xmath13",
    ", one has to put an atom to a cavity .",
    "however , trapping a single atom in a cavity is still technologically challenging .",
    "another candidate for a conditional faraday rotation of photon polarization is the quantum dot in a micro - cavity , which has already been demonstrated experimentally@xcite . here",
    "the photon interacts with the electron spin in the semiconductor quantum dot .",
    "the transmission distance is limited mainly by the coherence time of the electron spin in the quantum dot . the maximum transmission distance ( given by the speed of light ) would be  10 m and @xmath163 m for coherence times of 100 ns @xcite and for 10 ms @xcite in one - way transmission .",
