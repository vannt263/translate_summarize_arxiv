    "in the last few decades , many papers have been devoted to the measurement of the luminosity function ( lf ) of galaxies , of their distribution of central surface brightnesses and , to a lesser extent , of their distribution of scalesizes .",
    "the observational determinations of these three types of distribution can not in practice be separated , because of the limitations of the surveys on which the investigations are based .",
    "any galaxy lf is only valid to the surface brightness limit of the survey from which it is derived , while any distribution of surface brightnesses is valid only over some range in luminosity or scalesize , depending on the survey limits in apparent magnitude and/or angular size . in this paper",
    "we address this problem directly , by investigating the bivariate distribution functions of spiral galaxies in combinations of luminosity , surface brightness and scale size .",
    "knowledge of any two of these quantities then suffices to determine the third .",
    "bivariate distribution functions have two important applications .",
    "first of all , bivariate distribution functions are the only proper way to compare samples with different selection criteria , especially when comparing samples at different redshifts . for instance , comparing lfs determined from samples with similar magnitude limits but different lower surface brightness limits will result in discrepancies in the magnitude range where the contribution from low surface brightness galaxies is significant .",
    "secondly , bivariate distribution functions provide excellent tests for galaxy formation and evolution theories .",
    "any complete galaxy formation theory should be able to explain the distribution functions of galaxy structural parameters . obviously , the 2-dimensional ( 2d ) distribution functions provide more constraints on formation theories than the separate 1d distributions of surface brightness , scalesize and luminosity obtained by integrating over the other quantity in the bivariate distribution",
    ".    as already mentioned , every optically - selected galaxy sample always has limits in surface brightness in addition to its limits in apparent luminosity and/or angular diameter .",
    "the detection volume ( or visibility ) for a particular type of galaxy in a such a survey is then at least a two - parameter function , e.g.  of luminosity and scalesize , and depends strongly on these parameters , resulting in strong biases against low surface brightness ( lsb ) and small scalesize galaxies ( disney & phillipps  @xcite ; allen & shu @xcite ; mcgaugh , bothun & schombert  @xcite ) . since the determination of the space density of galaxies from a survey depends on knowing the detection volumes , the only complete description of the galaxy space density which can be obtained observationally is a bivariate distribution function which includes two of the three parameters of surface brightness , scalesize and luminosity . to study the bivariate distribution of field spiral galaxies",
    ", it is straightforward to show that one has to obtain surface photometry _ and _ distances of at least 500 - 1000 galaxies , in order to avoid problems with small number statistics near the selection boundaries ( de jong & lacey @xcite ) .    because of the large number of galaxies needed with both redshifts and good surface photometry , determinations of bivariate distribution functions of spiral galaxies as functions of structural parameters have been relatively rare .",
    "some notable exceptions are phillipps & disney ( @xcite ) , who presented a ( magnitude , surface brightness)-distribution of virgo spiral galaxies using rc2 data , van der kruit ( @xcite ) , who used a diameter - limited sample of 51 galaxies to construct a crude ( surface brightness , scale length)-distribution , and sodr & lahav ( @xcite ) who created a ( magnitude , diameter)-diagram from the eso - lv catalog .",
    "more recently lilly et al .",
    "( @xcite ) used the cfrs redshift survey to derive the bivariate function in the ( magnitude , scalesize)-plane , and made a first attempt at studying its redshift evolution .",
    "finally , driver ( @xcite ) used a volume - limited selection of galaxies in the hubble deep field ( williams et al .",
    "@xcite ) to probe the really low surface brightness regime of the bivariate distribution function .",
    "the results of nearly all of these studies suffered from small number statistics , and very few firm physical conclusions could be drawn .",
    "theoretical predictions for the sizes of galaxy disks in the hierarchical clustering picture of galaxy formation began with the classic paper by fall & efstathiou ( @xcite ) .",
    "they considered the formation of a disk by the collapse of gas within a gravitationally dominant dark matter ( dm ) halo .",
    "they showed how the radius of the disk is related to that of the halo , on the assumption that the gas starts off with the same specific angular momentum as the dark matter , and conserves its angular momentum during the collapse .",
    "thus in this picture , the disk radius depends on the amount of angular momentum which the halo acquires prior to collapse through the action of tidal torques from neighboring objects .",
    "this model naturally leads to typical disk sizes similar to those observed for bright spiral galaxies .",
    "many authors have subsequently made calculations of disk sizes within the same basic framework ( see e.g.  van der kruit @xcite ; mo et al .",
    "@xcite ; van den bosch @xcite ) , and dalcanton et al .",
    "@xcite combined this model with a schechter luminosity function for galaxies to predict the bivariate distribution of surface brightness and scale length for disks .",
    "we will parameterize our observed bivariate distribution function for disks in a way that is motivated by this same simple model .",
    "more recently , predictions for galaxy properties in hierarchical clustering models have been developed much further using the technique of semi - analytic modeling ( cole et al .",
    "@xcite , @xcite ; kauffmann , white & guiderdoni  @xcite , somerville & primack  @xcite ) .",
    "the semi - analytic models include much more of the physics of galaxy formation , including the merging histories of dm halos , gas cooling and collapse within halos , star formation from cold gas , feedback from supernovae , and the luminosity evolution of stellar populations . in this paper",
    "we will compare the observed bivariate distribution function with the most recent semi - analytic model predictions from cole et al .",
    "( @xcite ) .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in  [ viscor ]",
    "we describe how one can correct a sample of objects for distance dependent selection effects . in  [ sample ]",
    "we describe the sample we have used for this investigation and how we determine physical quantities from the observations . in  [ bivar ] we determine the bivariate distributions of space density and luminosity density for the local universe .",
    "we propose a model for the bivariate distribution functions based on the hierarchical galaxy formation scenario and fit this model to the data in  [ func ] .",
    "finally , we discuss the results in  [ discuss ] and summarize our conclusions in  [ concl ] .",
    "the use of selection criteria to define a sample of objects often introduces selection biases , even in so called `` complete samples '' , i.e.  samples that are complete according to their selection criteria .",
    "malmquist ( @xcite ) was one of the first to quantify the bias in the determination of the average _ absolute _ magnitude of a stellar sample due to the real spread in luminosity combined with the distance - dependent selection limit that results from applying a cut - off in _ apparent _ magnitude .",
    "the uncertainty in the measurement of the selection magnitude introduces another bias near the selection limit , which can be described in the same way as malmquist s original bias if the uncertainties have a gaussian error distribution .",
    "both of these effects ( which are mathematically similar in case of gaussian luminosity and error distributions , but have completely different origins ) have been called malmquist bias by different authors . to make matters even more confusing ,",
    "the biases in distance measurements resulting from the use of samples suffering from these effects have also been called malmquist bias .    in this section",
    "we describe how to correct a sample for distance - dependent biases and for biases resulting from uncertainties in the selection parameters .",
    "we pay particular attention to the case where the sample has been selected on angular diameters .",
    "our aim is to determine the average space density of galaxies with certain properties in the local universe .",
    "most field galaxy samples are not based on distance- or volume - limited surveys , but are limited by some quantity more readily available observationally , like apparent magnitude or angular diameter .",
    "not all galaxies have the same luminosity or physical diameter , and therefore they can be seen to different distances before dropping out due to the selection limits .",
    "the volume within which a galaxy can be seen and will be included in the sample ( v_max@xmath1 ) goes as the distance limit cubed , which results in galaxy samples being dominated by intrinsically bright and/or large galaxies , because these have the largest visibility volume ( disney & phillipps @xcite ; mcgaugh et al .",
    "@xcite ) .    in this paper",
    "we use one of the simplest methods available for correcting for selection effects , the v_max@xmath1  correction method ( schmidt @xcite ) . each galaxy",
    "is given a weight equal to the inverse of its maximum visibility volume set by the selection limits ( a formal derivation can be found in felten ( @xcite ) ) .",
    "for a low redshift sample with upper ( @xmath2 ) and lower ( @xmath3 ) limits on the major axis angular diameter , this leads to @xmath4 \\label{vmax}\\ ] ] with @xmath5 the fraction of the sky used to select the galaxies , @xmath6 the distance to the galaxy , and @xmath7 the major axis angular diameter of the galaxy .",
    "other limits , like redshift or magnitude limits , that would limit v_max@xmath1  can trivially be taken into account as well . for higher redshift samples we have to take cosmological corrections into account .",
    "we define the bivariate density distribution @xmath8 in parameters @xmath9 and @xmath10 such that @xmath11 is the number density of galaxies in the interval @xmath12 . for a sample of @xmath13 galaxies which is complete to within the selection limits",
    ", we can now define an estimator of this quantity as follows : @xmath14 where @xmath15 is summed over all galaxies , and @xmath16 if the ( @xmath17,@xmath18 ) parameters of galaxy @xmath15 are in the bin range ( @xmath19 ) , and 0 otherwise .",
    "the v_max@xmath1  correction method assumes a uniform distribution of galaxies in space , and is not unbiased against density fluctuations . to give unbiased results , objects with the smallest v_max@xmath1  in the sample",
    "should be visible on scales larger than the largest scale structure .",
    "currently , such samples do not exist .",
    "other methods exist that take density fluctuations into account ( for reviews see e.g.efstathiou et al .",
    "@xcite ; willmer @xcite ) .",
    "these methods assume a direct relation between the distribution parameter and the selection parameter .",
    "this is not the case in the current investigation ( selection on @xmath20-band diameters versus distributions of @xmath21-band magnitudes , surface brightnesses and scalesizes ) .",
    "the v_max@xmath1  corrections of equations ( [ vmax ] ) and ( [ bivarest ] ) are valid only if similar galaxies have their angular diameters measured at the same physical diameter , independent of distance ( see the discussion in de jong @xcite ) .",
    "it is _ not _ important if a particular class of galaxies has their diameters measured at an intrinsically larger physical diameter compared to other classes ( for instance , at a lower surface brightness )",
    ". this class of galaxies will be over - represented in the sample , but on average will have a larger distance , so that the effects exactly cancel out in the estimator  ( [ bivarest ] ) , as they are designed to do . in a similar fashion to de jong & van der kruit ( @xcite ) , we determined that the ratio of eye - estimated to isophotal diameters was independent of diameter , and we therefore conclude that most likely the diameters of all similar galaxies were measured at the same physical ( linear ) diameter .    the uncertainty in the @xmath8 estimator of equation([bivarest ] ) is in general dominated by poisson statistics : what is the uncertainty on the mean number of galaxies in a bin , if @xmath13 are detected ?",
    "it is easy to show that at least 500 galaxies with accurate photometry and distances are needed to determine a bivariate distribution function of structural parameters ( de jong & lacey @xcite ) .",
    "only if we have many galaxies in a bin is the error in @xmath8 no longer dominated by poisson statistics , but becomes dominated by the uncertainty in v_max@xmath1 .",
    "the uncertainty in v_max@xmath1  in equation([vmax ] ) arises from galaxy distance uncertainties and diameter uncertainties .",
    "the distance uncertainty of each galaxy ( @xmath22 ) contributes a component @xmath23 to the variance in the determination of @xmath8 .",
    "the diameter uncertainties ( @xmath24 ) add a @xmath25 to the variance , but are on top of that directly related to the selection of the sample , and are further discussed in the next section .",
    "the parameters used to select the galaxy sample can only be determined with finite accuracy .",
    "the selection parameters have to be distance dependent for v_max@xmath1  corrections to be used , leading to what often is called the malmquist edge bias .",
    "assuming a symmetric error distribution on the selection parameters ( e.g.  diameter or magnitude ) , objects at the selection limit have an equal probability of being scattered into the sample as being scattered out of the sample .",
    "because there are more small and faint than large and bright objects on the sky ( due to the effect described in the previous paragraph ) , on average more objects are scattered into the sample than than out of the sample , and we will overestimate the number of objects in our search volume .    once we have determined the probability distribution of the error in the selection parameters ( @xmath26 ) , we can correct the v_max@xmath1  method for this edge bias .",
    "we might try to correct for the bias by taking the average 1/v_max@xmath1  weighted with the error distribution of the selection parameters within the selection limits .",
    "unfortunately , this procedure would result in an overcorrection .",
    "an object at the selection limit would count for only half ( with the other half being outside the selection limits assuming a symmetrical error distribution ) , but an object just outside the selection limit with a large fraction of its probability function within the limits would not be included at all . to remedy this effect ,",
    "we take a virtual selection limit @xmath27 away from the original selection limit and now include the objects between the virtual and original selection limits with appropriate ( low ) weight .",
    "we demonstrate this for the case of diameter selection with the use of fig.[malmquist ] , where we plot three galaxies of different observed diameters @xmath7 .",
    "galaxy a has an observed diameter just below the selection limit @xmath3 ( indicated by the vertical dashed line ) , galaxy b is at the selection limit and galaxy c has an observed diameter slightly larger than the selection limit .",
    "each galaxy has an associated probability distribution of true diameter @xmath28 , indicated by the gaussian distributions .",
    "we can calculate a corrected 1/v_max@xmath1  for each galaxy using equation([vmax ] ) , averaged over the range of true diameters for each galaxy , weighted appropriately for the true diameter probability .",
    "if we take the true diameter cut - off the same as the observed diameter cut - off ( indicated by the horizontal dashed line ) , than galaxy b is only counted for half a galaxy , galaxy c is counted almost completely , and galaxy a is counted for a small but significant fraction ( dark and light shaded regions ) .",
    "we now have the situation where galaxy a should have been included , because a significant part of its true diameter distribution is larger than the true diameter selection limit , but the galaxy is in fact not included in the sample at all because its observed diameter is below the selection limit .",
    "this attempt to correct for the edge bias is therefore wrong , as we are not counting galaxies that should have been included .",
    "but by shifting the virtual true diameter selection limit upwards ( indicated by the dotted line ) and calculating the v_max@xmath1  values from equation([vmax ] ) with this shifted diameter limit , we only have to weight the galaxies for the dark shaded regions .",
    "galaxy a has now a negligible fraction of true diameters above the true diameter selection limit , which is good because it was not in the sample to begin with .",
    "other galaxies just above the selection limit get little weight , but have the appropriate corrected 1/v_max@xmath1  values .    in our example of a complete sample selected with upper and lower angular diameter cut - offs @xmath29 and @xmath3",
    ", we get for the corrected 1/v_max@xmath1to use in equation([bivarest ] ) @xmath30 where @xmath31 denotes the probability of the true angular diameter of a galaxy being @xmath32 at a given observed angular diameter @xmath33 , and v_max@xmath1(d ) is to be evaluated using equation([vmax ] ) with @xmath3 replaced by @xmath34 and @xmath2 replaced by @xmath35 .",
    "we should try to make @xmath27 as large as possible , so that @xmath36 is small , and the probability of a galaxy apparently being outside the selection limits but in reality belonging inside is small .",
    "unfortunately , we can not make @xmath27 too large , as then very few galaxies will remain with significant weights .",
    "we have used the galaxy sample described by matthewson , ford and buchhorn ( @xcite ) and matthewson & ford ( @xcite , mfb sample hereafter ) as the starting point for our sample selection .",
    "the mfb data were obtained mainly to study peculiar motions using the tully - fisher ( @xcite ) relation .",
    "the mfb sample is nearly ideal for the kind of study we want to perform . with more than a thousand field galaxies",
    "it is large enough not to run immediately into small number statistics near the low surface brightness and/or small scalesize selection borders .",
    "matthewson et al .  collected for most objects the ccd surface photometry and redshifts required for our statistical study .",
    "the main drawback of the sample is its selection , as the sample was defined as a subsample of the eso - uppsala catalog of galaxies ( lauberts @xcite ) , which is a catalog selected by eye from photographic plates .",
    "unfortunately , nothing better exists at the moment , and it remains to be seen whether automated surveys like sloan , denis and 2mass will go deep enough to detect lsb galaxies .",
    "these surveys should however discover and quantify the number of galaxies with small scalesizes .",
    "the mfb sample is not entirely complete , as some selected galaxies had to be excluded due to too bright foreground stars , too disturbed morphologies to obtain reliable surface brightness profiles or inability to obtain redshifts .",
    "as incompleteness is an issue in our analysis , we went back to eso - uppsala catalog and reselected galaxies using selection criteria close to the mfb sample criteria .",
    "our criteria are : eso - uppsala diameter @xmath37@xmath38@xmath39@xmath38@xmath40 , galactic latitude @xmath41 , morphological type @xmath42@xmath38t@xmath38@xmath43 and minor - over - major axis ratio @xmath44 @xmath45@xmath46@xmath45@xmath47 .",
    "this last criterion is different from mfb , excluding the edge - on galaxies for which extinction corrections are large and uncertain .",
    "these selection criteria resulted in a sample of 1007 galaxies , with a subsample of 818 galaxies ( 81.2% ) for which we have both mfb surface photometry and redshifts ( some redshifts were obtained from the ned and leda databases ) .",
    "a @xmath48-test ( schmidt @xcite ; see also de jong @xcite ) corrected for malmquist edge bias showed that the sample has an average @xmath48 of 0.507@xmath490.010 and is therefore statistically complete .",
    "a slight incompleteness for high surface brightness galaxies ( @xmath50 for galaxies with ) was detected .",
    "this means we have either too many high surface brightness galaxies nearby or too few at large distance .",
    "we could find no obvious reason why this might be the case .",
    "for the lower surface brightness bins the @xmath48 indicated statistical completeness .",
    "accurate distances are essential to calculate the v_max@xmath1  corrections .",
    "applying blind hubble flow distances would introduce large errors for many of the smallest , nearby galaxies .",
    "luckily , because the mfb sample data were obtained to measure peculiar motions , many of our galaxies have tully - fisher distances ( tully & fisher  @xcite ) .",
    "for the 706 galaxies in our sample also included in the mark iii catalog ( willick et al .",
    "@xcite ) we used group velocities for groups with recession velocities larger than 2000km / s , otherwise the mark iii malmquist bias corrected velocities . for galaxies",
    "not included in the mark iii catalog , we used their heliocentric velocity corrected to the local group velocity according to the precepts of karachentsev & makarov ( @xcite ) .",
    "all these velocities were converted to distances using a hubble constant of 65 kms@xmath51 mpc@xmath51 . when calculating the v_max@xmath1  corrections , we assume a 15% distance error for the galaxies with mark iii velocities and a 250 km / s peculiar velocity uncertainty for the remaining galaxies ( 1 sigma uncertainties ) .",
    "twenty percent of the galaxies have velocities of less than 2000km / s and about another 20% have velocities exceeding 5000km / s . for the brightest galaxies we therefore sample large enough scales not to be influenced by large scale density fluctuations , but for smaller galaxies this may not be the case .",
    "however , because @xmath48-tests indicated completeness and homogeneity of the sample independent of surface brightness and scalesize , we are not overly concerned by this .",
    "we calculated the characteristic global structural parameters of the galaxies from the radial @xmath21-band luminosity profiles .",
    "mfb calculated luminosity profiles by determining the average surface brightness on elliptical annuli , which had been fitted to the galaxy isophotes .",
    "the total luminosity ( m_i@xmath52 ) of the galaxies was calculated by extrapolating the last few measured points of the profiles to infinity with an exponential luminosity profile .",
    "this luminosity was used to calculate the effective ( half total enclosed light ) radius ( r_e@xmath53 ) .",
    "the average surface brightness within the effective radius which we will call effective surface brightness ( _ e@xmath54 ) hereafter was calculated using @xmath55 .",
    "in addition to the structural parameters for the galaxy as a whole , we also use in this paper the structural parameters for the disk alone .",
    "we decomposed the 1d luminosity profiles into bulge and disk contributions , using exponential light profiles for both disk and bulge ( see de jong @xcite ) .",
    "this yielded the structural parameters disk magnitude ( m_i , d@xmath56 ) , disk central surface brightness ( _ 0@xmath57 ) and disk effective radius ( r_e , d@xmath58 ) , which equals 1.679 times the disk e - folding scale length . in agreement with de jong ( @xcite ) , the 1d disk parameters showed good agreement with the disk parameters determined by byun ( @xcite ) , who used a 2d fitting method and an @xmath59  instead of exponential profile for the bulge .",
    "the galactic foreground extinction corrections were calculated according to the precepts of schlegel , finkbeiner & davis  ( @xcite ) .",
    "the proper internal extinction correction for disk galaxies is still heavily in debate .",
    "many different corrections have been proposed , resulting from a large variety of methods and galaxy samples . here",
    "we use the method of byun ( @xcite ) , also described in detail by giovanelli et al .",
    "( @xcite ) , to correct quantities to face - on values .",
    "using this method , the parameter for which the extinction correction has to be determined is first fitted against the inclination corrected maximum rotation velocity of the disk ( @xmath60 ) .",
    "the residuals on this fit are next fitted against @xmath61 ) to empirically determine the effect of extinction as a function of inclination relative to face - on .",
    "the extra step of fitting to the residuals of the @xmath60 relation reduces the distance dependent selection effects as function of inclination .",
    "in contrast to giovanelli et al .",
    "( @xcite ) and tully et al .",
    "( @xcite ) , we divide the extinction measurements into several surface brightness bins instead of absolute magnitude bins , as we expect the amount of extinction to be more related to surface brightness than luminosity .",
    "if the amount of dust at a given radius in the galaxy is in some way proportional to the amount of stars at that radius ( i.e.  local surface brightness ) , then for a disk - like configuration the relative extinction as function of inclination will be determined by surface brightness , independent of scalesize and hence magnitude .",
    "even so , because the magnitudes and surface brightnesses of galaxies are to some extend correlated , one will also see a trend between magnitude and extinction .",
    "the equations used for the extinction corrections are listed in table  [ exttab ] .",
    "we find that the low surface brightness galaxies in our sample behave as nearly transparent disks , while high surface brightness disks behave as having optical depth larger than one near the center .",

    "the dotted lines illustrate the selection biases for this sample",
    ". the sample should be complete to the indicated distances , for galaxies above and to the right of the lines , if we assume purely face - on exponential disks .",
    "the lines were calculated assuming the average surface brightness at @xmath7 is 24.83 @xmath21-mag arcsec@xmath75 , as determined from the data .",
    "this diagram shows clearly the selection biases against low surface brightness and small scalesize galaxies . only the highest surface brightness",
    ", largest scalesize galaxies can be seen out to 100mpc .",
    "the galaxies near the 100mpc line have a 125 times larger visibility volume than the galaxies near the 20mpc line , which makes visibility corrections essential to calculate real space density distributions from the apparent distribution in the figure .",
    "before we can calculate the true space density of galaxies using the equations derived in  [ viscor ] , we have to determine the uncertainty in the diameter selection parameter . to this end",
    ", we obtained 250 @xmath20-band images of galaxies in the eso - lv catalog ( lauberts & valentijn  @xcite ) , scanned from the same photographic plates that were used to define the eso - uppsala catalog from which our sample was selected .",
    "one of us ( rsdj ) went three times through the images , measuring the diameters with a cursor on a computer screen .",
    "these three sets of diameters were compared to the eso - uppsala diameters and compared to each other .",
    "it was found that the uncertainty in the diameters was more constant in the absolute than the relative sense in the range of diameters where we can be reasonably sure that we are complete ( 2.2@xmath38@xmath39@xmath384.2 ) .",
    "the rms error between our measurements was 0.21 , while the rms error between our diameter measurements and the eso - uppsala diameters was 0.31 .",
    "this difference results from the difference in measurement technique ( with eye , magnifying glass and ruler versus computer screen and cursor ) .",
    "the eso - uppsala diameters were quantified to the nearest 0.1 minute of arc , while the human brain has a preference for ` nice ' numbers .",
    "the diameter distribution of the eso - uppsala catalog shows distinct peaks at 2 , 2.2 , 3 , 3.5 , 4  and 5 .",
    "if we had re - measured the eso - uppsala diameters in exactly the same way as was done originally , we expect that the rms difference between our own and the eso - uppsala measurements would have been lower than determined now , and we therefore adopt an uncertainty in the eso - uppsala diameters of 0.25  to be used in equation([unccor ] ) .    to calculate the true space density of galaxies in the ( _ e@xmath54 , r_e@xmath53)-plane , we have to weight each of the galaxies in fig.[uncordis_re_muave ] using the visibility correction equations given in  [ viscor ] . in fig.[disre_muave ] we show the space density of sb - sdm galaxies in number per mpc@xmath76 .",
    "the 20mpc visibility limit of face - on galaxies with exponential disks is indicated by the solid line . to the left of this line",
    "we are limited by small number statistics and local density fluctuations , but to the right we should have a reasonably fair sampling of the local universe .",
    "the limits on the distribution at the high surface brightness and large scalesize ends are therefore real .",
    "note for instance that this distribution strongly suggests that a galaxy like malin  i ( bothun et al .",
    "@xcite ) with @xmath77@xmath21-mag arcsec@xmath75  and @xmath78kpc must be extremely rare .",
    "perhaps even more important than the space density of galaxies is their luminosity density , which is presumably indicative of the stellar ( and baryonic ) mass density .",
    "weighting each galaxy in fig.[disre_muave ] with its luminosity results in fig.[disre_muave_magwei ] , where we have used @xmath79@xmath21-mag to convert the @xmath21-band magnitudes to luminosities in solar units ( cox @xcite , transfering from johnson to kron - cousins @xmath21-band using bessell @xcite ) .",
    "spiral galaxies with effective radii of order 6kpc and @xmath80@xmath21-mag arcsec@xmath75provide most of the spiral galaxy luminosity in the local universe .",
    "it should come as no surprise that we live in a galaxy with these qualifications .",
    "the contribution of lsb spiral galaxies to the total luminosity density of the universe apears to be small .",
    "we will discuss this issue in more detail in  [ discuss ] .",
    "in this section we will derive a functional form to describe the bivariate distributions calculated in the previous section .",
    "the parametrization of the bivariate distributions will be useful to compare distributions derived from differently selected samples and to study redshift evolution .",
    "the parametrization can also be used in modeling where both galaxy luminosity and size are required ( e.g.modeling the cross - sections of galaxies for producing quasar absorption lines ) .    in the previous sections we used the distributions in the ( _ e@xmath54,r_e@xmath53)-plane ,",
    "as these parameters are the most naturally connected to the diameter selection limits . in this section we will instead use the distribution in the ( m_i@xmath52,r_e@xmath53)-plane ( fig.[bivar_magtot_re ] ) , as these quantities are the more natural ones in the galaxy formation model we will to use to find a suitable functional form for the bivariate distribution .",
    "the two descriptions are fully equivalent ( except for some binning differences ) through the equation @xmath81 .",

    "a more detailed model may be necessary .",
    "some hint of this can already be seen in figs.[bivar_magtot_re ] & [ moddis ] , where the scalesizes of the galaxies in the brightest magnitude bin seem to be larger than modeled by the function .      given our 2d parameterization , we will now investigate some 1d projections of this parameterization , and determine how these 1d projections depend on limits placed on one of the other parameters .",
    "unfortunately , we can not use the real data to make these projections .",
    "due to selections limits , there are regions in the 2d plane where we have no data , only upper limits .",
    "a 1d integration would mainly look like a meaningless upper and lower limits plot . by using the 2d parameterization",
    ", we assume that the same function that fits in the observed region also describes galaxies in the regions where we have no data . in this section",
    "we use the disks only parameterization of  [ func ] .    in fig.[lfdis_cslim ]",
    "we show how limits on the surface brightness in a sample can influence the determination of the lf .",
    "we integrate the bivariate distribution function down to the central surface brightness limits indicated in fig.[lfdis_cslim ] , thus calculating the lf for all galaxies with central surface brightness brighter than the indicated limits .    for local samples selected from photographic plates",
    ", the number of low surface brightness sb - sdm galaxies missing is expected to be quite small .",
    "for instance , the eso - uppsala catalog of galaxies ( lauberts @xcite ) has a typical surface brightness at the selection diameter of about 24.8 @xmath21-mag arcsec@xmath75  as determined from this sample , while the uppsala galaxy catalog ( ugc ; nilson @xcite ) has a selection surface brightness of about 26@xmath20-mag arcsec@xmath75  ( de jong & van der kruit @xcite ) , which corresponds to about 24.3 @xmath21-mag arcsec@xmath75  with @xmath20@xmath1521.7 ( de jong @xcite ) .",
    "so requiring that the _ central _ surface brightness of the galaxies are at least 1 mag brighter than the selection surface brightness in order to be selected ( very generous considering that bulges make detection even easier ) , the eso - uppsala catalog is expected to be reasonably complete down to a central surface brightness of _ 0@xmath57@xmath15323.8 @xmath21-mag arcsec@xmath75 , the ugc down to _",

    "the situation regarding the surface brightness bias for galaxy samples of types later than sdm is less clear .",
    "it is well established that the latest type ( i.e.  irregular and dwarf ) galaxies have a much steeper faint end slope of the lf than the spiral galaxies studied here ( marzke et al .",
    "@xcite ; lin et al .",
    "our schechter lf slope agrees well with slopes of other pure spiral galaxy samples . for galaxy samples of later types",
    "the slope is much steeper , and as surface brightness and luminosity are correlated in our parametrization , the number of missing lsb galaxies will increase when one considers late types .",
    "we can get some feeling for how many galaxies of types later than sdm we are missing by comparing the number of galaxies of types 78 in the eso - uppsala catalog to the number of type 910 galaxies . for the diameter and inclination selection criteria we applied to define our sample we have about twice as many @xmath155 galaxies as @xmath156 galaxies .",
    "when we use the full eso - uppsala catalog , the numbers are about equal .",
    "this suggests that type 910 galaxies are typically smaller and of lower surface brightness than the type 78 galaxies , which are already the smallest type of galaxies included in our sample ( see fig.[uncordis_re_muave ] ) . we do not have the photometry to make the full bivariate correction , but for the galaxies with redhsifts",
    ", we can make a v_max@xmath1  comparison to estimate relative number densities .",
    "using ned we obtained redshifts for 90% of the @xmath155 and 80% of the @xmath156 galaxies with @xmath157 ( 63% and 44% respectively for the full sample ) .",
    "for the sample with a @xmath157 cut - off , we then find that the v_max@xmath1-corrected number density of @xmath158 galaxies is about 17 times as high as that of the @xmath155 galaxies in our sample .",
    "for the full eso - uppsala catalog , the volume density of type 910 galaxies is about 25 times that of the type 78 galaxies .",
    "these relative space densities are rather uncertain due to redshift incompleteness and due to the generally low redshifts of these galaxies , making hubble flow distances rather uncertain .",
    "it does however show that a considerable number of disk galaxies are not covered by this study , in particular at the faint end of the lf .",
    "it is not inconceivable that this effect will raise the slope of the faint end of the combined lf of types 38 and 910 galaxies by a few tenths . in the remainder of this section",
    "we investigate the effect of including type 910 galaxies by also showing 1d projections with faint end slopes with @xmath159 , leaving all other parameters in the bivariate function the same .",
    "the @xmath159 parameterization is rather ad hoc and is only intended to give an indication of what including dwarf galaxies might do to the 1d projections .",
    "we have no way of knowing whether these late - type galaxies follow the same distribution of scalesize with luminosity as earlier - type spiral galaxies do , nor about the exact value for the faint end slope of the lf .",
    "the @xmath159 value for the faint end slope is inspired by some recent determinations of the lf where late - type galaxies have explicitly been included ( e.g.  marzke et al .",
    "@xcite , zucca et al .",
    "@xcite , folkes et al .",
    "the @xmath159 parameterization is almost certainly too simple according to these studies , as the very late type galaxies have an lf with a very steep faint end slope , but also only become significant in number density at very faint luminosities .",
    "therefore in reality the lf may steepen at very low luminosities , rather than being described by a single schechter function , but it is beyond the scope of this paper to investigate the effects of this .",
    "the `` dwarf corrected ''",
    "@xmath159 lf is shown as a dotted line in fig.[lfdis_cslim ] .",
    "for bivariate distributions with steeper faint end slopes the incompleteness due to surface brightness limits quickly becomes more severe .",
    "for example , for a bivariate distribution function with @xmath159 we start to underestimate the lf by a factor of 2 at m_i@xmath52@xmath160mag if our surface brightness cut - off is at 22@xmath21-mag arcsec@xmath75 .",
    "the selection against lsb galaxies can quickly become significant at high redshifts due to the ( 1+z)@xmath0  redshift dimming . not using a full bivariate distribution description in the comparison with local samples can give the false impression of evolution in the structural parameters of galaxies .",
    "surveys for high redshift galaxies will normally have much lower surface brightness selection limits , but even for the hubble deep fields ( hdfs ) , with their very low surface brightness limits of 29@xmath21-mag arcsec@xmath75 , the effects of surface brightness thresholds are predicted to be significant at high redshifts , _ if the galaxy population does not evolve_. consider , for example , galaxies detected as @xmath161-band dropouts at a redshift of about 3 .",
    "these galaxies suffer 6 magnitudes of surface brightness dimming and about 2 magnitudes of dimming due to the k - correction for an ( unevolving ) sb galaxy .",
    "if we require that the central surface brightness of the galaxy has to be 1 magnitude above the sky to enable detection , the @xmath162=3 galaxy has to have a rest - frame disk central surface brightness of about 19@xmath21-mag arcsec@xmath75  to be detected in the hdfs .",
    "such a surface brightness cut - off would start to severely affect our determination of the lf , even at @xmath117 , as can be seen in fig.[lfdis_cslim ] .",
    "luckily , this approach is probably overly pessimistic , as central bulges may raise the central surface brightness to help detection , and galaxy evolution will make the galaxies bluer at high redshift and hence reduce the k - correction . in addition , hierarchical galaxy formation models predict that the galaxies existing at high redshift should typically have smaller radii than present - day galaxies , which will also tend to increase their surface brightnesses .",
    "still , comparisons of structural parameters at different redshifts will require determinations of bivariate distribution functions to take into account varying selection functions .    in fig.[mudis_maglim",
    "] we show the distribution of central surface brightnesses integrated down to the indicated limiting absolute magnitudes .",
    "the slope at the faint end of the distribution is determined by the faint end slope @xmath120 of the schechter lf and the rate of change of median central surface brightness as function of luminosity as parametrized by @xmath123 .",
    "the slope in magnitudes becomes @xmath163 , which is about @xmath164 .",
    "late - type galaxies are expected to have a steeper faint end slope of their surface brightness distribution , because they have a steeper lf .",
    "we show an estimate of the possible size of this effect by the dotted line in fig.[mudis_maglim ] , which shows the same bivariate function as before , except that @xmath120 has been changed from -0.90 to -1.25 , i.e.  assuming that the late - type dwarfs missing from our observed sample follow the same distribution of radius or surface brightness as a function of luminosity as the spiral galaxies for which we have measured the bivariate distribution function .",

    "their surface brightness distribution cuts off at the bright end more steeply and at a fainter magnitude than ours , which could be partly due to the different correction for selection effects or to the use of @xmath20-band photometry uncorrected for dust extinction . also oneil and bothun ( @xcite )",

    "these discrepancies of a factor 4 - 6 in number density seem rather large , but if we were to use a bivariate function with @xmath159 to correct for the missing dwarf and irregular galaxies then our bivariate function would be fully consistent with these lsb surveys .",
    "tully & verheijen ( @xcite ) have argued that the central surface brightness distribution of spiral galaxies is bimodal , in particular when using @xmath170-band data .",
    "we do not see such bimodality , independent of whether we use their proposed bimodal dust extinction correction , whether we use only the 200 most face - on galaxies with the smallest extinction corrections , or whether we use bulge / disk decomposed parameters or effective total galaxy parameters . in the many ways in which we have looked at the mfb data set , where we have tried to minimize the effects of extinction and hence the difference between @xmath21 and @xmath170-band",
    ", we have never seen any bimodality in the surface brightness distributions . whether the bimodal effect is the result of the special ursa major cluster environment that was studied by tully & verheijen ( even though a fair fraction of the mfb galaxies must lie in the outer parts of clusters ) or an unlucky case of small number statistics ( bell & de blok @xcite ) remains to be seen .",
    "the final 1d projection we are interested in is the luminosity density of the local universe as a function of disk central surface brightness as shown in fig.[phifuncmumwei ] .",
    "the thick solid line indicates the luminosity density for our disk bivariate distribution function , assuming the faint end of the lf continues for ever with the same slope .",
    "most of the luminosity density of sb - sdm galaxies is provided by galaxies of @xmath171@xmath21-mag arcsec@xmath75 .",
    "changing @xmath120 from -0.90 to -1.25 to incorporate the effect of dwarfs and irregulars changes that to slightly fainter surface brightnesses ( thick short dashed line ) .",
    "looking at the cumulative distribution for sb - sdm galaxies ( thin dotted line ) , we see that 90% of the spiral galaxy luminosity in the local universe is provided by galaxies with",
    "_ 0@xmath57@xmath172-mag arcsec@xmath75 .",
    "the 90% level changes to _ 0@xmath57@xmath173-mag arcsec@xmath75  when we use the @xmath159 parametrization .",
    "this corresponds roughly to 22.2 and 22.9@xmath20-mag arcsec@xmath75  respectively , using @xmath20@xmath1741.7mag for late type galaxies ( de jong @xcite ) .",
    "the faint end slope of the combined spiral and dwarf / irregular lf would need to be significantly steeper than -1.25 for lsb galaxies to become significant contributors to the luminosity density of the local universe .",
    "an earlier determination of the contribution of lsb galaxies to the luminosity density of the local universe was presented by by mcgaugh  ( @xcite ) .",
    "he estimated that 10 - 30% of the local luminosity density came from galaxies with central surface brightnesses fainter than 22.75@xmath20-mag arcsec@xmath75  ( i.e.  @xmath175-mag arcsec@xmath75 ) .",
    "we find for the same cut - off about 4% ( about 12% if @xmath159 ) , significantly lower than mcgaugh .",
    "this difference must be mainly due to the higher surface brightness cut - off we find in our surface brightness distribution compared to mcgaugh , because the slopes at the faint end of the distributions are similar .",
    "we will now compare our observed bivariate distribution with theoretical predictions from the semi - analytic galaxy formation models of cole et al .",
    "( @xcite ) .",
    "these models are based on the same general scheme of galactic disk formation as was described in  [ funcdev ] , but include much more physics in modeling the evolution of both the dark matter and baryons , and relax some of the simplifying assumptions made there , such as isothermal halos and constant ratio of disk to halo mass .",
    "here we simply summarize the main ingredients of the models , and refer the reader to cole et al .",
    "( @xcite ) for a full description .",
    "the starting point in the models is the initial spectrum of density fluctuations .",
    "the mass function of dm halos at any redshift is calculated from this using the press - schechter  ( @xcite ) model .",
    "the formation of each halo through merging of smaller halos is described by a merger tree .",
    "merger trees are generated using a monte carlo method also based on the press - schechter model .",
    "the process of galaxy formation is followed through each halo merger tree .",
    "gas falling into halos is assumed to be shock - heated , and then to cool out to the radius where the local radiative cooling time equals the halo lifetime .",
    "the gas which cools collapses to form a rotationally supported disk .",
    "stars form from gas in the disk , on a timescale related to the disk dynamical time .",
    "supernovae are assumed to reheat some of the gas and blow it out of the galaxy , with an efficiency which is larger in small galaxies .",
    "galaxies can merge , on a timescale controlled by dynamical friction within halos , producing spheroidal galaxies from disks .",
    "the chemical enrichment history of each galaxy is calculated , and this is combined with the star formation history to calculate the luminosity and colors of each galaxy using a stellar population synthesis model .",
    "finally , the effects of extinction by dust are included .",
    "thus , in these models , the total baryonic mass of a galaxy is determined by the combined effects of gas cooling from the halo , gas ejection by supernova feedback , and mergers with other galaxies .",
    "the result is a galaxy luminosity ( and mass ) function that has a significantly different shape from the press - schechter mass function of halos , and is close to the observed galaxy luminosity function .",
    "the calculation of disk sizes proceeds along similar lines to those in  [ funcdev ] .",
    "each dm halo is assigned a total spin parameter randomly drawn from the distribution ( [ spineq ] ) .",
    "the specific angular momentum of the gas which cools is assumed to equal that of the dark matter within the cooling radius , and gas is assumed to conserve its angular momentum during the collapse down to a centrifugally supported disk . as already discussed in  [ funcdev ] ,",
    "this assumption of angular momentum conservation is valid in cdm - like cosmologies only if feedback effects are strong enough to prevent most of the gas condensing into dense lumps early on .",
    "this is what is assumed in the semi - analytic models , but most n - body / gasdynamics simulations find that the cooling gas loses substantial angular momentum , through forming dense lumps which then lose orbital angular momentum to the dm halo by dynamical friction before merging together to form galaxies .",
    "the resulting disks in these simulations are too small compared to observed galaxies , and this currently constitutes one of the most fundamental problems for galaxy formation models in cdm - like cosmologies ( e.g.  navarro & steinmetz @xcite ) .",
    "nonetheless , the semi - analytic models improve over the treatment in  [ funcdev ] by having a physical calculation of the galaxy mass and luminosity , by using navarro , frenk & white ( @xcite ) density profiles for the dm halos ( which according to n - body simulations is more appropriate in cdm - like universes than isothermal spheres ) and by including the self - gravity of the galaxy and the contraction of the halo in response to the gravitational pull of the galaxy .",
    "thus , the disk radius is found by solving for the self - consistent dynamical equilibrium of the disk , spheroid and dm halo .    in fig.[moddis",
    "] we compare our bivariate luminosity - scalesize distribution with the `` reference model '' of cole et al .",
    "( @xcite ) , which is based on a cdm cosmology with @xmath176 and @xmath177 .",
    "the model assumed @xmath178 , based on n - body simulations .",
    "for the model we only plot galaxies with bulge - to - total - light - ratio @xmath179 , equivalent to hubble types later than sab .",
    "this includes hubble types later than sd , which are not present in our observed sample .",
    "the model therefore over - predicts the number of galaxies , especially at faint luminosities , as late - type galaxies have a steeper faint end of the lf as detailed in  [ 1dproj ] .",
    "the models do not provide any detailed morphological information , only bulge - to - disk ratios , so we have no means to remove the very late - type galaxy contribution from the models .    at a given luminosity , the model predicts a scalesize distribution that is somewhat broader than observed , especially at lower luminosities .",
    "this is the same discrepancy as we found in ",
    "[ func ] , where the scalesize distribution for disks in the simple - minded parameterization corresponded to @xmath180 .",
    "in fact , if the value of @xmath90 used in the semi - analytic model is reduced from 0.53 to 0.35 , it also gives a scalesize distribution with a very similar width to the observed one .",
    "however , a value of @xmath90 this low does not seem compatible with the results of n - body simulations of cdm - like universes .",
    "we have seen that both the simple disk formation model described in  [ funcdev ] and the more sophisticated semi - analytic models described above result in a similar discrepancy with observations : the width of the disk scalesize distribution at a fixed luminosity , @xmath181 , is predicted to be about 1.5 times larger than is observed , if we use the value of @xmath90 from n - body simulations , or , equivalently , that we need to assume a value of @xmath90 about 0.7 times smaller than that measured in the simulations in order to fit the observed scalesize distribution .",
    "how might we explain the narrowness of the scalesize distribution within the picture of hierarchical galaxy formation in a cdm - like universe ?",
    "the possibility that the true dispersion in halo spin parameters is smaller than the value @xmath182 that we have assumed seems quite unlikely in a standard cdm - like universe . in n - body simulations , the distribution of halo spin parameters is found to be remarkably similar in different cosmologies , in different density environments and for a large range of halo masses ( e.g.  cole & lacey @xcite , lemson & kauffmann @xcite ) . even for self - interacting cdm ( spergel & steinhardt @xcite ) , this result would probably not change much , as a halo acquires most of its angular momentum around turnaround , when there is no significant difference in the behavior of collisional and collisionless dm .",
    "the specific angular momentum of the baryons that cool and collapse to form the disk may be different from that of the dark halo as a whole , but as long as the ratio of these two does not depend on the halo spin parameter , the _ fractional _ width of the size distribution is unaffected .",
    "for instance , in the semi - analytic models of cole et al .",
    "( @xcite ) , the specific angular momentum of the gas which cools is equal to that of the dm within the gas cooling radius , and so is less than that of the halo as a whole , but scales with it , since the cooling radius does not depend on the halo angular momentum . even in a more complex model for the cooling of halo gas , which relaxes the assumptions of a smooth spherical gas distribution",
    ", there is no obvious reason why the relative width of the distribution of angular momentum of the gas that cools should be any different from that of the halos , since the rotation within the halo is dynamically unimportant and should not affect which gas cools and collapses . as already mentioned in  [ sams ] , n - body",
    "/ gas - dynamics simulations typically find that the gas loses angular momentum during merging and collapse .",
    "this creates a difference between the disk and halo angular momentum , but they are still correlated , albeit with substantial scatter ( navarro & steinmetz @xcite ) .",
    "this scatter will broaden the predicted scalesize distribution , making the problem even worse .",
    "therefore , to reduce the width of the scalesize distribution , it seems necessary to consider processes operating within galaxy disks after they form .",
    "what is needed are processes which remove galaxy disks from either the low or high angular momentum tails of the distribution .",
    "one such process for removing low angular momentum disks was already proposed by several authors ( de jong  @xcite ; dalcanton et al .",
    "@xcite ; mo , mao & white @xcite ; mcgaugh & de blok @xcite ) .",
    "they noted that for a given disk mass , the low angular momentum disks will be more strongly self - gravitating , and so more likely to undergo bar instabilities , and suggested that disks undergoing such instabilities would turn into spheroids , thus removing disks of small sizes from the distribution .",
    "this would result in a substantial population of spheroidal systems at all masses that were not created by merging .",
    "an interesting test of this idea is whether it predicts the correct luminosity and angular momentum distributions for spheroids .",
    "low luminosity elliptical galaxies are observed to have significant rotation velocities , perhaps to the extent that they can not be explained by formation in major mergers ( e.g.  rix , carollo & freeman @xcite ) .",
    "it is possible that the effects of star formation and/or feedback from supernovae may suppress the number of large scalesize disks at a given luminosity .",
    "there is observational evidence that the timescale for star formation is shorter where the surface density of gas and stars is larger ( e.g.  schmidt @xcite ; kennicutt @xcite ; dopita & ryder @xcite ) .",
    "this naturally gives rise to inside - out disk formation , as observations suggest for most disk galaxies ( bell & de jong @xcite ) .",
    "in addition , it may be easier for supernova feedback to eject gas from the disk where the surface density is lower , or from larger disk radii where the escape velocity is lower .",
    "both of these processes , star formation and feedback , could therefore have the effect of reducing the total luminosity of larger scalesize disks , for a given initial disk mass , which might make the size distribution narrower at a given luminosity .",
    "these processes could also result in disks where the scale size of the stars is less than that of the gas which originally fell in .",
    "if this effect is stronger in the larger scalesize , lower surface density disks , this would also narrow the size distribution .",
    "the semi - analytic models that we considered do not calculate the radial dependence of star formation within a disk , but simply assume that the scalesize of the stars and the gas are the same .",
    "the models also do not include any explicit dependence of star formation or feedback on surface density .",
    "one final solution might be that the observational sample is biased and that we suffer from morphological selection effects in our comparison with the models .",
    "it could be that the largest and/or smallest scalesize galaxies at each luminosity have preferentially been classified as type later than sdm .",
    "however , it is rather hard to conceive how this could happen , as in many studies it has been found that morphological type mainly correlates with luminosity and surface brightness but is rather independent of scalesize ( e.g.  de jong @xcite ) . the real test of this possibility awaits the proper determination of the bivariate distribution of these very late type galaxies .    in conclusion",
    ", we see that allowance for disk instabilities converting disks into spheroids , more detailed physical calculations of star formation and feedback in disks and/or morphological selection effects , may well be able to explain the observed width of the disk size distribution within the standard framework of hierarchical galaxy formation .",
    "we have derived the bivariate space density distributions of sb - sdm galaxies in luminosity , scalesize and surface brightness from observational data by using a v_max@xmath1  technique to correct for selection biases . a bivariate function described by equation([bivareq ] )",
    "was fitted to the observed distribution using a maximum likelihood technique , and was found to fit the data well .",
    "the main conclusions of this paper are as follows :  the bivariate space density distribution of spiral galaxies in the ( m_i@xmath52,r_e@xmath53)-plane is well described by a schechter function in the luminosity dimension and a log - normal scalesize distribution at a given luminosity .",
    "the median disk size scales with luminosity as @xmath183  @xmath184 .",
    " this parameterization of the bivariate distribution was motivated by a simple model for galaxy formation through hierarchical clustering , where galaxies form in dm halos , which acquire their angular momenta from tidal torques .",
    "the galaxy luminosity distribution is related to the distribution of halo masses , while the disk scalesize distribution is related to the distribution of halo angular momenta . however , although this model predicts the correct _ shape _ for the disk size distribution , the _ fractional width _ of this distribution is smaller than expected .",
    "the detailed semi - analytic galaxy formation models of cole et al .",
    "( @xcite ) show a similar shortcoming . to make these models consistent with the observations",
    "would require that either the intrinsic angular momentum distribution of halos is narrower than measured from n - body simulations , or additional physics not included in the semi - analytic models is needed to describe the formation of disks in dm halos .",
    " the determination of the local lf of spiral galaxies is not strongly effected by the bias against low surface brightness ( lsb ) galaxies , even when selecting galaxies from photographic plates .",
    "this may not be true for the deepest high redshift observations available at the moment ( the hubble deep fields ) , where ( 1+z)@xmath0  surface brightness dimming does cause a significant selection bias against lsb galaxies at high redshifts .",
    " the distribution of central surface brightnesses of spiral galaxy disks integrated over all luminosities has a faint end slope similar to the faint end slope of the lf .",
    "this means that the number of spiral galaxies per mag arcsec@xmath75  in a volume stays nearly constant when going to fainter surface brightnesses , to the limit where we have been able to detect galaxies ( about 4 magnitudes below the canonical freeman ( @xcite ) value of 21.65 @xmath20-mag arcsec@xmath75 ) .",
    " the luminosity density of disk galaxies in the local universe is dominated by fairly high surface brightness galaxies .",
    "the contribution of lsb galaxies to the local luminosity density is small , unless the galaxy lf turns up dramatically at the faint end due to dwarf and irregular galaxies .",
