    "giant molecular clouds ( gmcs ; @xmath4 ) in the galaxy are highly inhomogeneous : they are often filamentary in appearance , consisting of discrete clumps , or cores ( @xmath5 ) , which contain most of the mass of a cloud ( including any young stars ) and are surrounded by a more diffuse component of predominantly atomic gas ( e.g. , williams , blitz , & stark 1995 )",
    ". indeed , gmcs are clumpy on all scales observed , and are possibly even fractal in nature ( falgarone , phillips , & walker 1991 ) .",
    "remarkably enough , however , the gross properties of cloud complexes are rather simply interrelated .",
    "total masses , mean densities , and average velocity dispersions vary with sizes ( effective radii ) roughly as @xmath6 , @xmath7 , and @xmath8 ( larson 1981 ; sanders , scoville , & solomon 1985 ; solomon et al .",
    "1987 ) , with uncertainties in the exponents typically of order @xmath90.1 .",
    "the seeming universality of these results demands a physical explanation .",
    "the relationship between size and linewidth ( which term we use interchangeably with velocity dispersion ) is further interesting because @xmath10 is observed to decrease towards smaller radii _ inside _ gmcs , and within individual dense cores ( larson 1981 ; miesch & bally 1994 ; fuller & myers 1992 ; caselli & myers 1995 ) .",
    "since the total linewidths of gmcs are mostly nonthermal ( the clouds are stable against gravitational collapse on the largest scales , but have masses several orders of magnitude above the thermal jeans value , so that their support must come largely from nonmagnetic or , very likely , mhd turbulence ) , this decrease reflects a move towards domination by thermal motions on the smallest scales .",
    "we should therefore expect the linewidths of low - mass cores to have a smaller turbulent component than those of high - mass cores .",
    "this is indeed the case ; in fact , the velocities nearest the centers of small cores are almost ( to within a few percent ) wholly thermal .",
    "however , it also happens ( caselli & myers 1995 ) that the nonthermal velocity dispersion shows _ a stronger dependence on radius in low - mass cores _",
    "( where @xmath11 ) than in massive ones ( @xmath12 ) . because star formation is localized in the cores of gmcs , their overall structure",
    " and this aspect specifically  bears strongly on our understanding of this most fundamental process .",
    "the goal of this paper is to find a model for the internal structure of molecular cores ( low- and high - mass both ) which quantitatively matches their observed , internal velocity - dispersion profiles , and is also consistent with global properties ( such as the observed mass - radius - linewidth relations ) of large , self - gravitating clumps and even whole gmcs .",
    "our approach is to reduce this problem to the specification of a ( total ) pressure - density relation  an equation of state  that , when used to solve the equation of hydrostatic equilibrium , results in a gas cloud with the required features .",
    "it is significant that the linewidth profiles of cores are insensitive to the presence or absence of young stars , and thus may be viewed as one of the prerequisites for star formation ( fuller & myers 1992 ; caselli & myers 1995 ) .",
    "this justifies our focus on the structure of purely gaseous clouds .",
    "to proceed , we shall resort to a virial - theorem treatment of molecular clouds which idealizes them as spheres of gas in hydrostatic equilibrium and satisfying poisson s equation . this is appropriate enough for dense cores , which in many cases are roughly spheroidal ( probably prolate : myers et al .",
    "1991 ) , or even near spherical ( e.g. , williams et al .",
    "1995 ) , overall .",
    "( although their internal density distributions may not be especially smooth on very small scales , we concern ourselves here with a description of their _ bulk _ structure . ) in addition , observations of very massive cores imply that they are self - gravitating and in approximate `` gravitational virial equilibrium , ''",
    "this is not the case for low - mass cores , but these still appear to satisfy the full virial theorem if surface - pressure terms are included ( bertoldi & mckee 1992 ) . finally , even the total masses , radii , and linewidths of entire gmc complexes are generally consistent with virial - equilibrium models of spheres ( e.g. , solomon et al .  1987 ; elmegreen 1989 )",
    "and it has been repeatedly confirmed that whole clouds tend to comply with @xmath14 ( larson 1981 ; solomon et al .",
    "1987 ; myers & goodman 1988b ) .    it should be noted that the correct , average mass - radius and size - linewidth relations can be recovered in a purely scale - free description of gmcs ( e.g. , henriksen 1991 ) .",
    "but the distinctly different scalings of velocity dispersion with radius inside low- and high - mass clumps is one indication that molecular clouds are in fact not entirely featureless .",
    "other current models for these objects ( such as isothermal spheres or negative - index polytropes ) face similar difficulties in accounting simultaneously for their global properties and their internal structures .",
    "magnetic fields are an important presence in regions of star formation ( e.g. , heiles et al .",
    "1993 ) , so we begin in  2 by writing down the virial - theorem ( or bonnor - ebert ) relations between the masses and total linewidths  including turbulent velocities  of magnetized spheres , truncated at radii such that the internal pressure just balances that of a diffuse surrounding medium .",
    "we then develop a stability criterion for such clouds which depends only on the assumption that their thermal linewidths ( i.e. , kinetic temperatures ) are invariant .",
    "when combined with the circumstantial evidence for equipartition between the kinetic and mean - field magnetic energies in gmcs and massive cores ( myers & goodman 1988a , b ; bertoldi & mckee 1992 ) , this stability criterion leads to mass - radius - linewidth relations between critical - mass objects that agree with the observed scalings ( both the exponents and the coefficients ) among gmcs .",
    "our analysis is therefore similar to those of , e.g. , chize ( 1987 ) , fleck ( 1988 ) , and especially elmegreen ( 1989 ) , but ours holds for clouds with an _ arbitrary _ equation of state .",
    "in addition , we find that critically stable clouds in magnetic equipartition should all satisfy @xmath15 .",
    "we therefore conclude that gmcs and massive cores are approximately at their critical masses and magnetically supercritical , with @xmath16 ( see also mckee 1989 ; bertoldi & mckee 1992 ) .",
    "the generality of these results allows for the investigation of essentially any pressure - density relation as a potential description of the interiors of molecular cores , just so long as critically stable configurations are at all possible .    in  3",
    ", we discuss polytropic equations of state : @xmath17 , with @xmath18 any positive number . clearly , if @xmath19 , then the total velocity dispersion ( @xmath20 ) stays constant or decreases with decreasing density ( increasing radius ) inside a cloud .",
    "if instead @xmath18 is allowed to be less than 1 ( e.g. , maloney 1988 ) , then @xmath21 increases with radius , as required . however , in our analysis , any such `` negative - index '' polytrope would be unconditionally stable against gravitational collapse ; or equivalently ( but independently of any stability criterion ) , it could not self - consistently satisfy the relation @xmath22 .",
    "while this is not a problem for low - mass cores , it is inconsistent with what we know of very large clumps , and gmcs overall .",
    "thus , we argue that polytropic pressure - density relations give an incomplete picture of interstellar clouds .",
    "a corollary to this is that weakly damped alfvn waves , for which @xmath23 ( mckee & zweibel 1995 ) , can not be invoked as the _ sole _ explanation of nonthermal linewidths in gmcs .",
    "section 4 describes what is , in our view , a more suitable alternative .",
    "there we consider the possibility that pressure varies only logarithmically with density : @xmath24 .",
    "we refer to the resulting gas cloud as a `` pure '' logotrope .",
    "this term was introduced by lizano & shu ( 1989 ; see also mckee 1989 ) , who actually added a logarithmic term to an otherwise isothermal equation of state in an attempt to account for turbulent linewidths .",
    "such models have also been studied in detail by gehman et al .",
    "( 1996 ) . here",
    ", however , we dispense with the explicitly isothermal component , for two reasons : ( 1 ) assuming @xmath25 , with @xmath26 the thermal velocity dispersion and @xmath27 some reference density ( lizano & shu 1989 ) , the observational inference that linewidths should be essentially purely thermal at the centers of cores requires that @xmath28 .",
    "but then the internal @xmath20 _ decreases _ with increasing radius .",
    "( 2 ) if now @xmath29 , then for large values of @xmath30 such as those suggested by gehman et al .",
    "( 1996 ) , @xmath31 vanishes for @xmath32 rather near unity .",
    "thus , real clouds would have to be almost uniform - density , which again is not observed .",
    "these difficulties do not extend to the specific equation of state which we examine .",
    "instead , an outwards - increasing velocity - dispersion profile obtains for an equilibrium pure logotrope .",
    "such a model can moreover account for the observed mass - radius and size - linewidth relations between gmcs .",
    "we also demonstrate that the linewidth measurements in both low- and high - mass cores , from a variety of molecular clouds , are quantitatively reproduced if @xmath3 .",
    "the argument makes explicit use of the fact that small cores are _ not _ at their critical masses ( while large ones generally are ) , but that they are still in approximate virial equilibrium when the effects of surface pressures are considered .",
    "although the logarithmic @xmath33 relation we advocate is phenomenological , its overall viability , along with the failings of other models , ultimately makes for a useful description of molecular clouds and their cores .",
    "interstellar clouds can be viewed as essentially `` pressure - truncated '' bodies of gas .",
    "( this term is meant to imply the existence , not of some radius where a gas cloud suddenly ends , but of one where it `` blends in '' with an ambient medium . )",
    "thus , the boundary of a gmc is set by pressure balance with the surrounding , hot ism .",
    "note that even if there is no such balance initially , it will eventually obtain after an overall expansion or contraction of the cloud complex . the extent of a core within a gmc is similarly limited by the pressure of a tenuous interclump medium , as has been argued by bertoldi & mckee ( 1992 )",
    ". the equilibrium structure of pressure - truncated isothermal spheres was first described by ebert ( 1955 ) and bonnor ( 1956 ) ( see also mccrea 1957 ) .",
    "their expressions connecting the masses , radii , and linewidths of the spheres follow from the assumption of hydrostatic equilibrium and poisson s equation , and therefore are written in terms of an internal pressure profile and gravitational potential . in appendix",
    "a , we re - derive these bonnor - ebert relations , but for clouds satisfying an arbitrary gas equation of state ( eqs .",
    "[ [ eq:4a]][[eq:4d ] ] ) .",
    "we also provide a connection ( eqs .",
    "[ [ eq:13a]][[eq:13 ] ] ) with the more transparent and observationally convenient virial - theorem formulation given by equations ( [ eq:12 ] ) below .",
    "as various authors have noted ( chize 1987 ; fleck 1988 ; maloney 1988 ; elmegreen 1989 ) , these relations in either guise provide a framework for an understanding of the standard `` larson s laws '' for gmcs ( @xmath6 and @xmath34 ; larson 1981 ) .",
    "the development of appendix a refers specifically to `` nonmagnetic '' clouds , meaning only that no _ ordered _ ( mean ) magnetic field is considered to be present .",
    "we work on the assumption that the effects of disordered fields ( mhd turbulence ) can be separately dealt with , in an equivalent hydrostatic problem that makes use of an effective equation of state to describe _ all _ of the contributions to gas pressure as a function of density .",
    "still , the effects of mean fields must also be considered in any applications to real interstellar clouds .      in the absence of any analytic models for magnetohydrostatic clouds ,",
    "we proceed by assuming spherical symmetry and turning to the scalar virial theorem : @xmath35 here the mass - averaged , total one - dimensional velocity dispersion of a cloud with radius @xmath36 is related to its mean pressure and density by @xmath37 so that the kinetic ( or internal ) , mean - field magnetic , and gravitational energies are given by the usual @xmath38 @xmath39 and @xmath40 the parameter @xmath41 is essentially a measure of the non - uniformity of a gas sphere , and as such depends on the equation of state and the truncation radius ( in terms of a fixed scale @xmath42 ; eq .  [ [ eq:13a ] ] ) . however , it is generally of order unity : for a power - law density profile @xmath43 , equation ( [ eq:9 ] ) gives @xmath44 .",
    "we expect @xmath45 in a realistic gmc or core , and thus @xmath46 .",
    "it is often more useful to work in terms of the virial parameter of bertoldi & mckee ( 1992 ) : @xmath47 this _ observable _ quantity can also be written ( cf .",
    "mckee & zweibel 1992 ) as @xmath48 although this form of the virial theorem is appropriate for clouds of any shape , the corrective factors for spheroidal clouds are rather near unity ( bertoldi & mckee 1992 ) , and we still allow only for spherical symmetry here .",
    "it is further convenient to distinguish between the virial parameters which would obtain for a cloud with and without a mean magnetic field ; these are related by @xmath49 again , @xmath50 refers specifically to the combination ( [ eq:10 ] ) of observables . on the other hand",
    ", @xmath51 applies to the @xmath52 ( no mean field ) counterpart of a given cloud ; it is directly observable only in this special case ( since then @xmath53 ) , but may always be calculated for a given gas equation of state , as outlined in appendix a. once this is known , @xmath50 follows with the specification of a mean - field configuration ( see  2.3 ) .",
    "the connection ( [ eq:11 ] ) between @xmath50 and @xmath51 is valid insofar as the ratio @xmath54 does not change drastically upon the `` addition '' of a mean magnetic field to a cloud which is already in hydrostatic equilibrium .",
    "this must hold along field lines anyway ( force balance is required in that direction ) , and thus everywhere on the surface of a roughly spherical cloud . defining @xmath55",
    ", such reasoning implies that @xmath56 , so manipulation of the virial theorem gives the following : @xmath57 @xmath58 @xmath59 and @xmath60 these relations , of which only two are independent ( they are contained , for example , in eqs .",
    "[ 9 ] and [ 10 ] of elmegreen 1989 ) , are also given by harris & pudritz ( 1994 ) for the specific case of critically stable isothermal spheres ( as defined in  2.2 ; @xmath61 and @xmath62 at a cloud radius @xmath63 ) .",
    "as written here , they apply to any generic gas cloud , stable or unstable , isothermal or not .",
    "any cloud in hydrostatic equilibrium and satisfying poisson s equation has a central region where the potential , density , and velocity dispersion are very nearly constant with radius .",
    "equations ( [ eq:13a ] ) and ( [ eq:13b ] ) show that spheres truncated in or just outside this central region ( i.e. , at radii small enough that @xmath64 ) have @xmath65 , and thus @xmath66 by equations ( [ eq:12]a , b ) .",
    "roughly this scaling has been observed for the virial parameters of low - mass , high-@xmath67 cores in several gmcs , leading bertoldi & mckee ( 1992 ) to argue that such clumps can be viewed as truncated spheroids which are essentially in pressure equilibrium with an intracloud medium .      given equations ( [ eq:12 ] ) for the equilibrium structure of pressure - truncated gas spheres , we are in a position to question their stability : under what conditions will they be able to withstand the combined effects of self - gravity and surface pressure , and when will they be unstable to wholesale gravitational collapse ?",
    "the answer to this depends , of course , on any boundary conditions attached to a perturbation of the cloud . obviously , the total mass should be unchanged by a contraction or expansion of the entire structure .",
    "in addition , following maloney ( 1988 ) , we suppose that the central velocity dispersion remains constant as the cloud radius , or the surface pressure , is varied .",
    "this stipulation is meant to reflect the fact that the turbulent linewidth decreases steadily towards smaller scales in cores and in entire gmcs .",
    "we therefore identify the central velocity dispersion with the thermal part of the total linewidth : @xmath68 . insisting that this be invariant amounts to recognizing the rough uniformity of kinetic temperatures @xmath69 ( which to first order can be understood as a consequence of the competition between cosmic - ray heating and co cooling ) over a large range of scales in interstellar clouds .",
    "the stability criterion that follows ultimately leads to a set of results which self - consistently explain some important observational features of gmcs and massive cores .",
    "a gas cloud will be stable against radial perturbations if the derivative @xmath70 ( taken with @xmath71 and @xmath72 held fixed ) is @xmath73 : a slight decrease in the cloud radius then leads to an increase in the pressure just inside its boundary , which in turn leads to reexpansion .",
    "appendix b shows that , for any equation of state , this condition is just @xmath74\\leq0\\ , \\label{eq:14}\\ ] ] where @xmath75 is the internal density at the edge of the cloud .",
    "although this stability criterion has been derived without explicitly considering the effects of mean magnetic fields , we expect that it should not be greatly altered by their inclusion .",
    "( this is again implied by our assumption of approximate spherical symmetry , since eq .",
    "[ [ eq:14 ] ] must at least be satisfied along field lines at the boundary of a magnetized cloud . )    depending on the equation of state , there may exist a radius for which a pressure - truncated cloud is marginally stable ( the expression [ [ eq:14 ] ] is just 0 ) , and beyond which it is unstable . it is these critical equilibria , which must have @xmath76 that are of particular interest here . once @xmath51 and @xmath41 are known as functions of radius ( as in appendix a ) , the satisfaction , if possible , of equation ( [ eq:15 ] ) sets the boundary @xmath77 of the cloud .",
    "this in turn allows for evaluation of the coefficients in equations ( [ eq:12 ] ) . quite generally , @xmath78",
    "@xmath79 @xmath80 and @xmath81 equation ( [ eq:16]c ) shows that a nonmagnetic cloud ( @xmath53 ) on the verge of gravitational collapse has a mean column density which is fixed by the pressure of the surrounding medium , independently of any gas equation of state .    in general ,",
    "the virial parameter of a given cloud is sensitive to its internal structure ( through the equation of state ) and its total radius .",
    "however , for a _ critically stable _ cloud we always have @xmath82 . since @xmath41 is typically of order ( but slightly greater than ) unity , this implies @xmath83 and @xmath84 . the virial theorem ( [ eq:5 ] )",
    "then becomes @xmath85 if there is equipartition @xmath86 between the magnetic and kinematic energies in such a cloud , then @xmath13 as well ; thus , @xmath87 , and the critical @xmath50 is expected to be of order unity ( cf .",
    "eq .  [ [ eq:11 ] ] ; see also elmegreen 1989 and mckee & zweibel 1992 ) .    observations of molecular clouds show that @xmath13 ( or equivalently , @xmath88 ) , and are _ consistent _ with @xmath86 ( myers & goodman 1988a , b ) , although actual magnetic - field measurements are few and uncertain .",
    "the most massive cores in gmcs similarly tend to show @xmath22 and @xmath50 near 1 ( this is not the case for low - mass cores , however : e.g. , williams , de geus , & blitz 1994 ; williams et al .  1995 ; see also  4.1 below ) .",
    "observations of them are also indicative of magnetic equipartition ( bertoldi & mckee 1992 ) , though again the evidence is rather indirect , and not necessarily conclusive .",
    "having said this , it does seem that gmcs and massive cores both satisfy equation ( [ eq:17a ] ) , which would imply that they are at or near their critical masses",
    ".    thus arrived at , this conclusion depends on the criterion one adopts for cloud stability , i.e. , it follows from the assumption that the thermal linewidth @xmath71 is held fixed during any radial perturbation ( and from the additional proviso that @xmath86 ) .",
    "nevertheless , our analysis  which specifies no equation of state  provides a natural explanation for the fact that so many gmcs and large cores appear to be in simple `` gravitational virial equilibrium '' ( i.e. , @xmath89 ) , even though they are threaded by appreciably strong mean magnetic fields .",
    "there is also separate evidence for the criticality of massive molecular cores .",
    "for instance , bertoldi & mckee ( 1992 ) , in their study of the cores in four gmcs , argue that the most massive are at least magnetically supercritical , a necessary condition for gravitational instability .",
    "more fundamentally , star - forming regions clearly must be susceptible to gravitational collapse ; but in the rosette gmc at least , those cores which are most obviously associated with iras sources are also among the heaviest ( williams et al .",
    "as mentioned above , the largest cores in several gmcs also have the smallest virial parameters ( as low as 1 ) , so that this would seem to be a feature of clouds which are close to instability .",
    "the observation of a mean @xmath90 for gmcs then implies that they , too , are near some critical mass , and certainly in excess of the nonmagnetic jeans or bonnor - ebert value ( for which @xmath52 implies @xmath91 and @xmath92 ) .",
    "mckee ( 1989 ) has further argued that gmcs on the whole are magnetically supercritical , and of course they must be strongly self - gravitating in order to be molecular at all ( e.g. , elmegreen 1985 ) .    on a related note , mckee ( 1989 ) points out that gmcs must generally be near criticality because they show a @xmath93 which is typically an order of magnitude larger than the total ( thermal plus turbulent ) pressure in the hot ism .",
    "given our stability criterion , equation ( [ eq:16]d ) shows that self - gravity can supply a maximal pressure enhancement @xmath94 of a spherical cloud over its surrounding medium , and this only for a critical - mass body .",
    "even putting the nonsphericity of gmcs aside , however , it is important to note that the analysis here speaks only to the molecular , self - gravitating parts of gmcs , and not to their diffuse , low-@xmath95 components .",
    "elmegreen ( 1989 ) has shown that the weight of these atomic `` envelopes '' can easily increase the pressure at the boundaries of the molecular parts of a cloud complex by a factor of 5 or more above the value in the ism at large ; overall , then , @xmath96 .",
    "if gmcs and their most massive cores are indeed critical - mass objects , then they must all have the same dimensionless radii ( although the physical scale @xmath42 will generally vary ) , and the same virial parameters .",
    "aside from possible variations in @xmath97 , which are discussed in detail by elmegreen ( 1989 ) , this causes the coefficients in equations ( [ eq:16 ] ) or ( [ eq:12 ] ) to be roughly constant , and allows for well defined mass - radius - linewidth relations between clouds .",
    "moreover , we have argued that @xmath98 and , in the event of magnetic equipartition , @xmath99 for critical clouds , regardless of the underlying equation of state .",
    "the coefficients in the @xmath100 scalings are then independent of this detail , and the average properties of gmcs can shed no light on their internal structure .",
    "this both explains why critical , magnetized isothermal - sphere models are successful in quantitatively accounting for the observed scalings ( with @xmath101 and @xmath99 : elmegreen 1989 ; harris & pudritz 1994 ) , and implies that the same agreement with the data comes with _ any _ model which provides for the existence of a critical mass ( see eqs .",
    "[ [ eq:411 ] ] below ) .",
    "finally , equations ( [ eq:16 ] ) as written would suggest that all gmcs must be under similar surface pressures @xmath97 if , for example , @xmath102 is to be roughly the same among them .",
    "other authors ( e.g. , mckee 1989 ; mouschovias 1987 ; myers & goodman 1988b ) have argued instead that either @xmath102 itself ( and hence @xmath93 ) , or the mean field strength @xmath103 , is the more fundamentally invariant attribute of gmcs .",
    "if so , then @xmath97 could be eliminated from the critical bonnor - ebert relations in favor of any of these quantities , and our approach does not preclude the others .      consider a cloud of radius @xmath36 , threaded by a mean magnetic field approximated as uniform and of magnitude @xmath103 . outside the cloud , let @xmath104 fall off as @xmath105 to a radius @xmath106 , where it matches onto an ambient , uniform field of strength @xmath107 ( nakano 1984 ) .",
    "conservation of flux ( or continuity of the normal component of * b * across the boundary of the cloud ) demands @xmath108 , and evaluating equation ( [ eq:8 ] ) at the surface @xmath109 gives @xmath110 defining @xmath111 and @xmath112 , we have @xmath113 so that equation ( [ eq:11 ] ) gives @xmath114 with @xmath115 g and @xmath116 g for gmcs ( myers & goodman 1988b ) , flux conservation gives @xmath117 ; and @xmath118 implies @xmath119 .",
    "thus , @xmath88 when @xmath83 , as expected .    some indication of the reliability of equations ( [ eq:16 ] ) and ( [ eq:17 ] ) , and of the approximations leading to them , can be had by comparing the critical masses they predict for magnetized , isothermal spheres ( @xmath62 ) with those obtained from self - consistent , axisymmetric numerical calculations . in particular , the mass @xmath120 which separates magnetically sub- and supercritical clouds , and for which @xmath121 , is given by equation ( [ eq:17 ] ) as @xmath122 , only a 50% overestimate of the exact result @xmath123 ( mouschovias & spitzer 1976 ; tomisaka , ikeuchi , & nakamura 1988 ) .",
    "further , for @xmath124 , the critical masses we obtain by using equation ( [ eq:11 ] ) in ( [ eq:16]a ) lie within a factor 2 of those found by tomisaka et al .",
    "( 1988 ; see their eq .  [ 4.7 ] ) .",
    "( in fact , our formula is more accurate in the weak - field limit because it approaches the correct @xmath125 for the nonmagnetic , @xmath126 isothermal sphere . ) and for the equipartition @xmath127 seen in gmcs , setting @xmath90 in equation ( [ eq:17 ] ) implies @xmath128 .",
    "this is roughly 1.6 times our ( approximate ) @xmath120 , and 2.4 times the exact value , which level of agreement is quite acceptable . in any case , we are led to expect that critical - mass gmcs and cores are strongly magnetically supercritical , with @xmath129  a result which has also been argued by mckee ( 1989 ) and bertoldi & mckee ( 1992 ) .",
    "the outwards increase of linewidth both within giant molecular clouds as a whole ( larson 1981 ; miesch & bally 1994 ) and within individual dense cores ( fuller & myers 1992 ; caselli & myers 1995 ) , immediately suggests the class of negative - index polytropes as possible models for these structures .",
    "that is , if @xmath130 , then for a polytropic index @xmath131 we have @xmath132 increasing for decreasing @xmath133 , as required .",
    "such models have been studied by , e.g. , viala & horedt ( 1974 ) and maloney ( 1988 ) , and we derive the generalized bonnor - ebert relations for them in appendix c. although there are various physical arguments to support their use ( e.g. , shu et al .",
    "1972 ; de jong , dalgarno , & boland 1980 ; mckee & zweibel 1995 ) , these polytropes turn out to be unlikely descriptions of real gmcs ( and of course , a positive polytropic index is undesirable because it is inconsistent with a velocity dispersion that increases with radius ) .    here",
    "we define @xmath134 , so that @xmath135 and @xmath136 for @xmath131 . from appendix c , a nonmagnetic , negative - index polytrope which is truncated anywhere outside of its constant - density central region ( inside which , @xmath137 and @xmath51 increases without bound towards @xmath138 )",
    "will then satisfy @xmath139 thus , an @xmath136 polytrope has @xmath140 ; and since its density profile is @xmath141 , with @xmath142 everywhere for any @xmath143 ( appendix c ) , we also find @xmath144 . according to equation ( [ eq:14 ] ) , then ,",
    "_ a truncated , negative - index polytrope will always be stable , and never critically so _",
    "( as was also noted by maloney 1988 ) . ultimately , the same steady increase of linewidth with radius which would recommend the polytropic equation of state in the first place also proves to be its undoing : the internal pressure gradient which results is so shallow as to stabilize a cloud under any external pressure .",
    "the concept of a critical mass is then irrelevant for these models , which casts doubt on their utility in describing real gmcs or high - mass cores .",
    "any additional support from a mean magnetic field in the cloud obviously serves only to exacerbate this problem .",
    "again , this result follows to some extent from the constraint that the thermal linewidth @xmath71 be fixed during a perturbation of the cloud .",
    "by contrast , both viala & horedt ( 1974 ) and chize ( 1987 ) consider the possibility that the constant of proportionality in the relation @xmath135 is invariant , and find that polytropes can become unstable for certain truncation radii .",
    "still , our approach is closely related to a point which is _ independent of any rule for cloud stability _ :",
    "the minimum value of the nonmagnetic virial parameter for a truncated polytrope is ( eq .  [ [ eq : b7 ] ] ) @xmath145 as usual , this is a lower limit because @xmath51 can be very large indeed if the polytrope is truncated at a very small radius . in the event of equipartition @xmath146 between kinematic and magnetic energies , equation ( [ eq:11 ] ) and the identity @xmath147 lead to @xmath148 in which case equation ( [ eq : b11 ] ) and @xmath136 finally imply that @xmath149 thus , regardless of whether there exist any unstable modes for truncated polytropes , the virial parameters of such clouds are significantly larger than the @xmath99 ( @xmath13 ) seen in gmcs ( myers & goodman 1988b ) and in the most massive molecular cores ( bertoldi & mckee 1992 ; williams et al .  1994 , 1995 ) , even if dynamically significant mean magnetic fields are allowed to be present .",
    "it is a property of our specific stability criterion that this fact implies the absence of critically stable equilibria .",
    "the virial parameters of magnetized polytropes could be reduced to @xmath99 , for any @xmath143 , if the mean field were such that @xmath150 . in this case , however , using equation ( [ eq : b11 ] ) for @xmath54 in the virial theorem ( [ eq:5 ] ) leads to @xmath151 for @xmath152 , which is difficult to reconcile with the rather higher degree of magnetic supercriticality that is observationally inferred for gmcs and massive cores ( @xmath153 , and @xmath154 ; see   2.2 , 2.3 ) .",
    "one consequence of all of this is that the nonthermal linewidths in gmcs , @xmath155 , can not be attributed entirely to the pressure of weakly damped alfvn waves , for which @xmath156 ( @xmath157 , or @xmath158 ; mckee & zweibel 1995 ) , and thus @xmath159 under magnetic equipartition .",
    "it seems almost certain that alfvn waves do play a significant role in the support of gmcs and cores ( e.g. , arons & max 1975 ; pudritz 1990 ) ; but , as mckee & zweibel ( 1995 ) also note , they can not be uniquely responsible for their large - scale stability . in this context",
    ", we note that the size - linewidth relation between clouds can be expressed in terms of a mean magnetic field strength , as in , e.g. , myers & goodman ( 1988a ) .",
    "specifically , equation ( [ eq:16]d ) can be used to write ( [ eq:16]b ) in terms of @xmath93 rather than @xmath97 , and the definition of @xmath160 (  2.3 ) relates @xmath93 to @xmath103 . then , with a mean mass per particle @xmath161 and a kinetic temperature @xmath162 k , we have @xmath163 the equality is not quite exact here , because the scalings with @xmath103 and @xmath36 strictly apply to the total @xmath164 .",
    "still , this relation is accurate in the typical case , @xmath165 ; and for @xmath166 , it is consistent with available data ( see myers & goodman 1988a ) .",
    "thus , although mouschovias & psaltis ( 1995 ) argue for an interpretation of this result in terms of alfvn waves , we see here that it is independent of _ any _ assumptions on the physical origin of the nonthermal motions in gmcs ( in principle , they need not even derive from magnetic fields ) .    finally , it is clear that any simple `` mixing '' of two polytropes with different indices will still preclude the existence of a critical ( or low-@xmath50 ) cloud ; even the superposition of an isothermal part , i.e. , @xmath167 , only admits one if it is essentially isothermal anyway ( @xmath168 ) .",
    "thus , we now turn to a different equation of state , in which the gas pressure varies only logarithmically with density .",
    "many theoretical models of star - forming clouds employ the singular isothermal sphere , in which @xmath169 . however , there is some evidence that regions are concentrated towards the co centroids of their parent gmcs such that their three - dimensional number density is most consistent with an @xmath170 fall - off ( waller et al .",
    "1987 ; scoville et al .",
    "this suggests the possibility that , in a heavily smoothed , average sense , the internal density structure of molecular clouds is essentially @xmath171 ( see also solomon et al .",
    "further , extinction measurements indicate @xmath171 or so in the outer parts of cores as well ( cernicharo , bachiller , & duvert 1985 ; stwe 1990 ) .",
    "lizano & shu ( 1989 ; see also gehman et al .",
    "1996 ) introduced the so - called logotropic equation of state for gmcs , @xmath172 , with @xmath173 and @xmath174 .",
    "if the central linewidth of a cloud is to be entirely thermal in origin , the reference density in @xmath175 must be @xmath28 .",
    "however , @xmath132 then _ decreases _ with radius , which is incompatible with the observations .",
    "we suggest that a more complete description of gmcs and cores is given instead by a `` pure '' logotrope : @xmath176\\ , \\label{eq:41}\\ ] ] with @xmath177 a parameter to be adjusted .",
    "the assumption here is that any nonthermal motions , which presumably arise from mhd turbulence , add to the thermal pressure such that both are fully accounted for by the equation of state ( [ eq:41 ] ) . this relation is shown schematically in fig .",
    "[ fig0 ] , along with an isothermal - sphere combination and the polytropic @xmath23 for alfvn waves . in the rest of our discussion ,",
    "equation ( [ eq:41 ] ) is referred to simply as a logotrope , with the understanding that no further consideration is given to any mixed - isothermal version .    given equation ( [ eq:41 ] ) , the equation of hydrostatic equilibrium ( [ eq:1 ] ) integrates to @xmath178 where @xmath179 is a dimensionless gravitational potential .",
    "substitution of this expression into poisson s equation ( [ eq:2 ] ) shows the existence of a singular solution , @xmath180 which describes the density profile of the bounded ( finite @xmath181 ) solution at large radii .",

    "a logotrope truncated by the pressure @xmath97 of an external medium has precisely one critical mode for any given value of @xmath2 .",
    "as discussed in appendix b , if a cloud is truncated at a very small radius @xmath187 , it will always be stable .",
    "but in the power - law part of the logotrope , equations ( [ eq:42 ] ) and ( [ eq:43 ] ) show that @xmath188 , so once @xmath187 is so large that @xmath189 , the cloud is unstable ( cf .",

    "it is found that @xmath11 within gmcs ( e.g. , myers & goodman 1988b ) , and low - mass molecular cores show the same general trend ; high - mass cores are more suggestive of @xmath204 ( fuller & myers 1992 ; caselli & myers 1995 ) .",
    "a logotropic equation of state both for individual cores and for entire cloud complexes is consistent with these observations , provided that low - mass cores can be viewed as spheres which are pressure - truncated at radii @xmath205 .",

    "as always , though , no matter how @xmath10 varies with @xmath206 internally , the _ average _ relation @xmath207 still holds for critical - mass clouds , i.e. , for gmcs .    a handle on an appropriate value of the parameter @xmath2 for gmcs as a whole , can be gotten by reinventing them as smoothed - out spheres with a number of distinct overdense regions ( the cores ) sprinkled throughout . the observed contrasts in mean density and velocity dispersion between gmcs and cores",

    "then the pressure @xmath97 at the surface of a core is comparable to the gmc s @xmath220 , and similarly for the density and velocity dispersion .",
    "these assumptions , together with the relation @xmath221 ( eq .  [ [ eq:16]c ] ) , result in @xmath222 comparison of equations ( [ eq:46 ] ) and ( [ eq:47 ] ) then shows that the observed @xmath213 , @xmath223 , and @xmath224 ( only two of which are actually independent ) are realized in a logotropic gmc with @xmath225    although this procedure is highly idealized , it is perhaps telling that an @xmath2 exists at all which gives at once the correct @xmath226 and @xmath214 .",
    "the logotrope appears to be the simplest barotropic equation of state which can account for these ratios _ and _ the small virial parameters ( or the critical equilibrium ) of gmcs and massive cores .",
    "for example , if gmcs and large cores were both @xmath157 polytropes truncated at @xmath227 , then equation ( [ eq:46 ] ) could be roughly satisfied , but they would also have a large @xmath228 , and hence @xmath229 for magnetic equipartition ( again , @xmath150 is required to reduce @xmath50 to unity for a negative - index polytrope , but this is not wholly satisfactory for other reasons ; see  3 ) . alternatively , adding an explicit @xmath230 term to equation ( [ eq:41 ] ) destroys the _ simultaneous _ correspondence between @xmath213 and @xmath223 for critical clouds .    to this point , we have not accounted for any mean magnetic fields in gmcs and cores .",
    "however , these should have no effect on our estimate of @xmath231 insofar as very massive clumps have the same @xmath88 as their parent clouds .",
    "more important is the assumption that the cores here lie at the rare , highest - pressure peaks of cloud complexes ; if instead they are found in less extreme regions , then equation ( [ eq:410 ] ) is an upper limit to @xmath231 .",

    "as alluded to earlier (  2.2 ) , the mass - radius and size - linewidth relations among real gmcs can therefore be understood in terms of this model : equations ( [ eq:16]b , c ) become @xmath236 and @xmath237 which agree well with observations ( cf .",

    "the ratio of these two is typically around @xmath239 , due to the weight placed on a gmc by its uv - shielding atomic layer ( elmegreen 1989 ; also  2.2 above ) .      as a class ,",
    "dense molecular cores seem somewhat more heterogeneous than their parent gmcs .",
    "first , many studies ( carr 1987 ; loren 1989 ; stutzki & gsten 1990 ; lada , bally , & stark 1991 ) show that the size - linewidth relation between cores can be significantly weaker than the virial , @xmath8 scaling among gmcs , and in some cases is difficult to discern at all .",
    "second , in the l1630 gmc at least , the size - linewidth relation is considerably better defined for clumps which stand out more strongly against the interclump medium ( see the comparison in fig .",
    "13 of lada et al .  between their `` 5@xmath10 '' and `` 3@xmath10 '' cores ) . and third",
    ", the virial parameters @xmath50 of gmc cores are not restricted to values near 1 , but rather can range as high as @xmath240100 ( bertoldi & mckee 1992 ; williams et al .",
    "1994 , 1995 ) .",
    "this last point is particularly significant because the virial parameters of cores in a number of different clouds are seen to correlate with their size : low mass goes along with rather large @xmath50 , and high mass with more moderate @xmath88 .",
    "thus , as bertoldi & mckee ( 1992 ) argue , the smallest clumps in gmcs are far removed from gravitational instability ( surface pressure is more important than self - gravity in their confinement ) , while the largest are actually near criticality ( strongly self - gravitating ; see also  2.2 above ) .",
    "equivalently , a range in the masses of cores can be viewed , at least roughly , as a range in the dimensionless radii @xmath187  small for low mass , and near @xmath191 for high mass  at which they are truncated by the ambient pressure in a gmc ( virial parameters generally decrease with @xmath187 for any equation of state ; appendix a ) .",
    "this notion could account for the rather confused size - linewidth relation _ between _ cores ( if @xmath187 does not have a fixed value , then neither do @xmath51 and @xmath50 in eq .",
    "[ [ eq:12]b ] ) , and ultimately must also have consequences for the interpretation of data on the radial variation of velocity dispersion _ inside _ cores .    if indeed very low - mass cores differ from very high - mass ones mainly in being truncated at @xmath241 , then the former must be less centrally condensed , have ratios @xmath242 nearer unity , and be generally less distinguishable from the intercore ( gmc ) gas than the latter .",
    "this results in the scale radius @xmath243 being _ larger _ for less massive clumps . to see this ,",
    "compare the @xmath42 of a low - mass core , truncated at @xmath187 small enough that @xmath64 , with the @xmath42 of a near - critical , high - mass core . on average",
    ", any two cores should be under similar surface pressures @xmath97 ( this essentially being set by the internal @xmath93 of a parent gmc ) , so that @xmath244\\   \\simeq\\ \\sqrt{{a\\over{4}}}\\   \\left[{{\\sigma_c^2{\\rm{(high)}}}\\over{\\sigma_c^2{\\rm{(low)}}}}\\right]\\ , \\label{eq:412}\\ ] ] where the second step follows from equation ( [ eq:47 ] ) if a logotropic equation of state applies .",
    "thus , for @xmath71 not too widely different between the two cores , and for @xmath2 small enough , the ratio ( [ eq:412 ] ) will be @xmath245 .",
    "the same _ physical _ radius @xmath206 in high- and low - mass cores then corresponds to respectively larger and smaller @xmath246 .",
    "this result , which just reflects the fact that more strongly self - gravitating structures are more centrally concentrated , must be considered when attempting to match any model to any observations .",
    "returning now to the issue of internal velocity - dispersion profiles , fuller & myers ( 1992 ; hereafter fm ) and caselli & myers ( 1995 ; hereafter cm ) have compiled linewidth measurements in at least three different molecular lines for each of 14 low - mass and 24 massive cores .",
    "the resulting @xmath10 vs.  @xmath206 profiles indicate that , over similar ranges @xmath247 pc in all the clumps , and independently of whether or not stars are present within them , the velocity dispersion rises more steeply with radius in low - mass cores than in high - mass ones .",
    "in particular , nonthermal linewidths in the former are consistent with @xmath248 ; in the latter , @xmath249 ( cm ) . in our view , this situation is a direct result of the effect summarized by equation ( [ eq:412 ] ) .",

    ") however , some of the scatter is surely due to the fact that the cores in this sample do not reside in a single gmc , but come from diverse environments .",
    "( for instance , the low - mass cores here tend to be found in dark clouds of mass @xmath267 , and the high - mass ones in somehat larger gmcs . )",
    "thus , there is no guarantee that every low - mass core observes @xmath64 , or that every high - mass core is at its critical mass .",

    "the approach we have taken self - consistently allows for purely thermal motions to dominate on the smallest scales in cores ( and in gmcs ) ; for an internal density structure ( @xmath171 in the outer parts of cores , and much shallower near their centers ) which is consistent with at least some observations ( cernicharo et al .",
    "1985 ; stwe 1990 ; andr , ward - thompson , & barsony 1993 ) ; and for a unified treatment of low- and high - mass cores .",
    "this is in contrast to the models of fm and cm ( also myers & fuller 1992 ) , which assume two distinct components of isothermal and nonthermal gas in cores and predict a @xmath169 singularity at their centers .",
    "it should also be noted that the assumption @xmath64 in low - mass cores still allows for these noncritical clumps to show a fair degree of central concentration .",
    "for example , an @xmath258 logotrope which is truncated at @xmath268 has @xmath269 , but @xmath270 ; thanks to the relatively weak dependence of @xmath31 on @xmath133 , we do not require , nor even expect , that all low - mass cores be uniform - density spheres .",

    "we have generalized the classic bonnor - ebert relations for isothermal spheres , to give expressions for the masses , radii , and total velocity dispersions of magnetized , pressure - truncated gas clouds with any internal pressure - density relation .",
    "the analysis combines an exact approach , based on solving the equation of hydrostatic equilibrium , with a virial - theorem treatment to incorporate mean magnetic fields into the clouds .",
    "a stability criterion has been developed that relies only on the assumption of an invariant central velocity dispersion @xmath71 , and is independent of the gas equation of state .",
    "clouds which are just _ critically _ stable under this condition have mass - radius and size - linewidth relations which are effectively oblivious to their internal structure , i.e. , to their equation of state .    these results have been applied to molecular cloud complexes and dense cores , leading to three main conclusions :    \\(1 ) in spite of their nonspherical geometry , the gross features of gmcs are consistent with those of critical - mass clouds in our analysis .",

    ". these are observed features of real gmcs and their most massive cores .",
    "in addition , any of our critical - mass spheres obey the same mass - radius and size - linewidth relations which hold among real gmcs .",

    "alternatively , a negative index ( i.e. , @xmath17 with @xmath273 ) gives a linewidth which increases with radius , as required .",
    "however , such clouds do not show virial parameters near unity unless their mean fields are so strong that their magnetic and gravitational energies are comparable in magnitude , and this is again in conflict with observations of gmcs and large cores .",
    "given our stability criterion , an equivalent statement is that pressure - truncated polytropes are unconditionally stable against gravitational collapse .",
    "since weakly damped alfvn waves satisfy @xmath23 ( mckee & zweibel 1995 ) , this shows explicitly that they can not fully explain the observed nonthermal support in molecular clouds .",

    "the characteristic scale of a cloud is set by @xmath42 ; the factor of 9 in its definition identifies it with the projected half - power radius of an isothermal sphere ( e.g. , binney & tremaine 1987 ) .",
    "the equation of hydrostatic equilibrium then reads @xmath278 and poisson s equation becomes @xmath279 ( note that @xmath280 at @xmath281 , and @xmath282 for @xmath283 . ) the mass enclosed within radius @xmath187 is given by @xmath284 so that , with the help of equation ( [ eq:2 ] ) , @xmath285    following ebert ( 1955 ) and bonnor ( 1956 ) , the surface of the cloud is defined by that radius @xmath187 at which the internal pressure @xmath286 just equals a confining pressure @xmath97 due to a surrounding medium of negligible gravity .",
    "equation ( [ eq:3 ] ) , the definition of @xmath42 , and the identity @xmath287 then yield , for any equation of state relating @xmath31 and @xmath133 , @xmath288 the physical radius of the cloud is @xmath289 : @xmath290 these relations combine to give @xmath291 and @xmath292 given an equation of state , the integration of equations ( [ eq:1 ] ) and ( [ eq:2 ] ) determines @xmath293 and @xmath242 at any truncation radius @xmath187 .",
    "this fixes the coefficients in equations ( [ eq:4a])([eq:4d ] ) and affords mass - radius and size - linewidth relations for pressure - truncated clouds .",
    "( note that the scalings in these relations  @xmath294 , @xmath295 , etc .",
    " are _ global _ ones , and do not necessarily reflect the radial dependence of any quantity _ inside _ a cloud . )",
    "the definition of the non - uniformity parameter @xmath41 ( eq .  [ [ eq:9 ] ] ) allows it to be found as a function of radius : @xmath296 and equation ( [ eq:3 ] ) implies that the virial parameter @xmath297 for nonmagnetic clouds ( i.e. , @xmath53 ) is just @xmath298 which tends to be a nonincreasing function of @xmath187 .",
    "alternatively , equations ( [ eq:4d ] ) and ( [ eq:12]d ) give @xmath299 these results can be used to rewrite equations ( [ eq:4a])([eq:4d ] ) in terms of @xmath51 , @xmath41 , and @xmath164 ; equations ( [ eq:12 ] ) ( with @xmath300 ) are then obtained .",
    "also , once @xmath51 is known as a function of radius in any cloud , the observable @xmath50 for a given magnetic field configuration may be calculated ( e.g. ,  2.3 ) .",
    "we begin by recalling the definition of the scale radius @xmath42 from equation ( [ eq:3 ] ) : @xmath301 and rearranging equation ( [ eq:4a ] ) : @xmath302 the stability of a cloud truncated at radius @xmath36 by the external pressure @xmath97 is determined by the sign of the derivative @xmath303 : this is negative for a stable equilibrium , 0 for the `` critical '' cloud , and positive for instability .",
    "we now apply a perturbation @xmath304 , while keeping the mass @xmath72 and central ( i.e. , thermal ) velocity dispersion @xmath71 of the cloud fixed , so that @xmath305 then @xmath289 and equation ( [ eq : a1 ] ) give us @xmath306^{-1 } \\nonumber \\\\   & = & { 1\\over{r_0}}\\left[1-\\xi\\left(\\xi^2\\dpsi\\right)^{-1 } { d\\over{d\\xi}}\\left(\\xi^2\\dpsi\\right)\\right]^{-1 } \\nonumber \\\\   & = & { 1\\over{r_0}}\\left[1 - 9\\xi\\left(\\dpsi\\right)^{-1}{{\\rho_s}\\over{\\rho_c } } \\right]^{-1 } , \\label{eq : a4}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath75 is the density just inside the cloud edge and we have used poisson s equation ( [ eq:2 ] ) .",
    "we also have , from equation ( [ eq : a2 ] ) , @xmath307 \\nonumber \\\\   & = & p_s\\left(\\dpsi\\right)^{-1}\\left({{\\rho_s}\\over{\\rho_c}}\\right)\\left [ 18-\\left(\\dpsi\\right)^2\\left({{p_s}\\over{p_c}}\\right)^{-1}\\right ] , \\label{eq : a5}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where both equations ( [ eq:1 ] ) and ( [ eq:2 ] ) have been used .",
    "thus , equations ( [ eq : a3 ] ) , ( [ eq : a4 ] ) , and ( [ eq : a5 ] ) show that @xmath308 .",
    "\\label{eq : a5a}\\ ] ] now , from equations ( [ eq:13 ] ) and ( [ eq:4d ] ) , we have @xmath309 so that finally , @xmath310 .",
    "\\label{eq : a7}\\ ] ] alternatively , for a _ nonmagnetic _",
    "cloud , we can make use of equation ( [ eq:12]c ) , with @xmath300 , to write @xmath311 .",
    "\\label{eq : a6}\\ ] ] this treatment is valid for _ any _ gas equation of state , so long as the cloud radius is perturbed in such a way that @xmath72 and @xmath71 are unaffected .",
    "the result ( [ eq : a6 ] ) was also obtained by ebert ( 1955 ) and bonnor ( 1956 ) , who specifically considered the stability of truncated isothermal spheres , and by maloney ( 1988 ) in his study of negative - index polytropes .    any virialized cloud truncated at small @xmath187 ( i.e. , where @xmath133 and @xmath21 are approximately constant ) will be stable .",
    "this is because , regardless of the equation of state , the potential @xmath312 at small radii can always be expanded in a power series of the form : @xmath313 ( see appendix c for an example ) .",
    "thus , referring to equation ( [ eq : a5a ] ) with @xmath314 , we have @xmath315 .",
    "depending on the equation of state , there may or may not be a truncation at larger @xmath187 which results in @xmath316 and an unstable equilibrium .",
    "consider the ( nonmagnetic ) equation of state @xmath317 where the polytropic index @xmath131 .",
    "then we define @xmath134 and write @xmath318 with @xmath319 corresponding to isothermality . in order to evaluate the coefficients in equations ( [ eq:4a])([eq:4d ] ) ( or [ [ eq:12 ] ] , with @xmath300 )",
    ", we first use the relation ( [ eq : b1 ] ) to integrate the equation of hydrostatic equilibrium ( [ eq:1 ] ) and find @xmath320^{n/(1-n ) } , \\label{eq : b2}\\ ] ] so that poisson s equation ( [ eq:2 ] ) becomes @xmath321^{n/(1-n)}. \\label{eq : b3}\\ ] ] ( note that in the limit @xmath322 , the right - hand side of eq .  [ [ eq : b3 ] ] becomes @xmath323 , just what is required for the isothermal sphere . ) at the cloud center , @xmath280 , so for small @xmath187 the potential @xmath312 can be expanded in a power series , @xmath324 allowing for an integration of equation ( [ eq : b3 ] ) .",
    "the result of this is a core - halo structure to the cloud : at very small radii , the solution is indistinguishable from that for an isothermal sphere , and the density and velocity dispersion are essentially constant with @xmath187 , independently of @xmath143 .",
    "once @xmath325 a few , however , a power - law density profile obtains ; for each @xmath143 , there exists a singular solution to which the equilibrium cloud tends at large radii .",
    "these singular solutions are readily found by substituting the prescription @xmath326 into equation ( [ eq : b2 ] ) and solving ( [ eq : b3 ] ) for @xmath327 and @xmath328 .",
    "this gives @xmath329^{p/2 } , \\label{eq : b5}\\ ] ] so that with @xmath330 we have @xmath331 , and these clouds are diffuse enough that they have no `` natural '' edge .",
    "that is , the density never vanishes , and any boundary to the cloud must be defined by the point at which the internal pressure matches that of an external medium .",
    "( it is again worth noting the exact correspondence to the singular isothermal sphere when @xmath319 in eq .",
    "[ [ eq : b5 ] ] ; cf .",
    "chandrasekhar 1967 . )",
    "consider now a polytrope of negative index , which is truncated at radius @xmath187 large enough that the structure of the cloud is given by the singular solution .",
    "then @xmath293 and @xmath242 can be calculated analytically , and equation ( [ eq:13 ] ) yields @xmath332 we also know that @xmath44 , so @xmath333 and we have the following : @xmath334 @xmath335 @xmath336 and @xmath337 thus , regardless of where they are truncated by the surface pressure @xmath97 , these model clouds can only ever represent modest enhancements over the intercloud medium . in particular , @xmath338 has a maximum of 3 ( for isothermality , @xmath319 ) , but even for @xmath157 ( which gives the @xmath133 dependence of alfvn wave pressure ; mckee & zweibel 1995 ) is reduced to just 9/7 .",
    "as discussed in  3 , any truncation of a negative - index polytrope results in a stable cloud .",
    "this is because , with @xmath141 , we have that @xmath339 , and the stability criterion ( [ eq : a7 ] ) becomes ( with the help of [ [ eq : b6 ] ] ) @xmath340 . in particular , this holds in the limit @xmath322 , when the numerator and denominator of ( [ eq : a7 ] ) both vanish .",
    "what allows for the existence of critical and unstable equilibria for the bounded isothermal sphere , then , is the fact that its density profile actually oscillates about the singular solution @xmath169 at large radii ( chandrasekhar 1967 ) .",
    "this does _ not _ occur for those polytropes with @xmath136 ; instead , the bounded spheres follow the singular solutions exactly at large @xmath187 .    finally , it is worth noting that these results do not contradict the well known instability ( e.g. , shu 1977 ) of truly singular spheres , for which @xmath141 all the way to the center and @xmath341 . in such cases , perturbation of the truncated cloud radius",
    "is performed with @xmath72 , @xmath71 , _ and _",
    "@xmath181 all held fixed .",
    "stability then depends only on the sign of @xmath342 ( eq .",
    "[ [ eq : a5 ] ] ) , which is always positive for these polytropes .",
