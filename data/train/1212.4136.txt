    "under the assumption of homogeneity and isotropy of the universe at large scales , and that general relativity is the correct theory of gravity , the accelerated expansion @xcite is due to an exotic component , with negative pressure , called dark energy ( de ) .",
    "moreover , structures such as galaxies and clusters of galaxies seem to require the existence of another exotic component , dubbed dark matter ( dm ) @xcite , in order to form .",
    "de and dm constitute the so - called dark sector of the universe , accounting for about @xmath7 of the total cosmic energy budget .",
    "their nature is still a mystery , but they clearly do not fit in the standard model of elementary particles @xcite .",
    "one important proposal describing the dark sector of the universe is the unification scenario , where dm and de are considered different manifestations of a unique component .",
    "the paradigm of such idea is the chaplygin gas ( gc ) model @xcite , where an equation of state inspired by string theory @xcite allows to obtain a dynamic behaviour mimicking dm in the past and de in current time , as structure formation and the accelerated expansion require .",
    "later , the cg has been phenomenologically generalized , leading to the so - called generalized chaplygin gas ( gcg ) @xcite .",
    "though the idea is very appealing , the gcg faces crucial drawbacks when the model undergoes observational tests .",
    "this has been first indicated in reference @xcite , concerning the behaviour of small perturbations and structure formation , and pointed out again in @xcite .",
    "one important aspect is that the so - called kinematic tests ( those based on the background expansion and the calculation of distances ) seem to favour values for the gcg equation of state parameters that imply negative square speed of sound @xcite ( though they do not exclude positive values ) .",
    "if this is really the case , up to our knowledge in the literature there are only two ways out : @xmath8 to introduce _ ad hoc _ entropic perturbations @xcite which nullify ( or make positive ) the effective speed of sound or @xmath9 to modify the gravity theory , by supposing e.g. a non - conservative theory of gravity @xcite .",
    "our goal in this work is to understand to which extent the results of @xcite are really robust from the point of view of the kinematic tests .",
    "this question has already been addressed in @xcite , using the differential age of the universe ( i.e. the @xmath10 test ) and type ia supernova ( snia ) .",
    "we extend that analysis by enlarging the number of observational data for the @xmath10 test and by including the position of the first acoustic peak of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) spectrum and the baryonic acoustic oscillation ( bao ) tests .",
    "we revisit the constraints placed by these datasets , but we do not touch delicate issues such as the calibration problem of the snia data @xcite .",
    "our results seem to reveal the robustness of the kinematic tests for the gcg model : we find @xmath11 ( at the 2@xmath3 level ) .",
    "therefore , we not only confirm the previous results , but stress that negative values of @xmath1 seem to be favoured over the positive ones ( for comparison , see table  1 of @xcite ) .",
    "note that we can not report a real  tension `` between background tests and the ones involving perturbations , since at 2@xmath3 we find that positive values of @xmath1 are still allowed ( @xmath12 , whereas in @xcite the authors find @xmath13 , for perturbations ) , but we can speculate how the chaplygin gas could be ' ' saved  if such tension would appear in the future , given the fact that many experiments are ongoing and others forthcoming ( such as euclid ) , thus the precision on the observational data is increasing day after day .    within the  tension ",
    "scenario , if the gcg is indeed the matter component behind the dark sector , it must get its origin from a different theory of gravity rather than gr .",
    "for example , non - standard theories of gravity such as rastall s @xcite , @xmath14 @xcite or horava - lifshitz @xcite could possibly improve the status of the gcg .",
    "our discussion in sec .",
    "v is devoted to open a new window for gcg based cosmological models where standard gr is replaced by rastall s theory .",
    "we also stress that , in general , the accepted idea is that the gcg ( based on gr theory ) works only if its parameter space is reduced to the @xmath6cdm one , in particular if @xmath5 , see eq .",
    "( [ pressure ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ hchap ] ) @xcite .",
    "we discuss this issue in sec .",
    "we point out that the reduction @xmath5 implies that the gcg does not behave as a pressureless fluid at high redshifts , but as a fluid with a small negative constant pressure .",
    "hence the analysis of the growth of sub - horizon gcg dark matter halos during the matter dominated epoch and the `` mszros effect '' could be different from the standard @xmath6cdm picture , possibly leading to a different non - linear clustering pattern at small scales and to a modification of the transfer function .",
    "this argument agrees with the conclusions of @xcite . for a opposite point of view , i.e. that the perturbations in the gcg with @xmath5 are the same ( at all perturbative orders ) as in the @xmath6cdm , see @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : succandprob ] , we review briefly the possible tensions within gcg model tests . in sec .  [",
    "sec : bgtests ] we describe the observational tests we perform , while in sec .",
    "[ sec : anandres ] we carry out the statistical analysis based on such tests . in sec .",
    "[ sec : healing ] we investigate a rastall s theory approach which could possibly save the gcg . in sec .",
    "[ sec : meszeq ] we discuss the general relativistic limit @xmath15 of the gcg and solve its mszros equation . in sec .",
    "[ sec : conc ] we present our conclusions .",
    "the gcg model is characterized by the equation of state @xcite @xmath16 where @xmath17 and @xmath1 are free parameters .",
    "the original chaplygin gas model , which is somehow connected with the nambu - goto action of string theory , implies @xmath18 @xcite , the case @xmath19 being a phenomenological generalization . integrating the conservation equation for the fluid , @xmath20 leads to the following expression for the gcg density as function of the scale factor : @xmath21^\\frac{1}{1 + \\alpha}\\;,\\ ] ] where we have defined the new parameter @xmath22 and present - time quantities are indicated by the subscript @xmath23 . from eq .",
    "( [ rhoc ] ) one can see that the original motivation behind the gcg , i.e. a fluid that evolves from the matter behaviour at early times to a constant density at late times , occurs only if @xmath24 .",
    "when one consider a model where the energy content is given by radiation and baryons , besides the chaplygin gas , friedmann s equation becomes @xmath25^\\frac{1}{1 + \\alpha}\\;,\\\\ \\omega_{c0 } & = & 1 - \\omega_{b0 } - \\omega_{r0}\\;,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath26 is the hubble constant and @xmath27 is the redshift , which is related to the scale factor by @xmath28 .",
    "we have also assumed a spatially flat background , according to the recent results of wmap7 @xcite .",
    "the hubble parameter today can be expressed as @xmath29 km s@xmath30 mpc@xmath30 , where @xmath31 ( we will adopt the range @xmath32 as a prior for our bayesian analysis ) .",
    "we also introduce @xmath33 , for future convenience .",
    "the idea of dm - de unification into a single fluid in expression ( [ hchap ] ) , faces difficulties from different points of view . from the theoretical side ,",
    "if vacuum energy is not responsible for de , it should be explained how it contributes to gravity and therefore how it enters eq .  .",
    "from the observational point of view , introducing from eq .",
    "( [ pressure ] ) the gcg speed of sound @xmath34 one can see that if background tests favour negative values of the parameter @xmath1 , then @xmath35 is negative .",
    "this is not only an undesirable feature of the model , but depending on how much it is negative a `` tension '' between background and perturbative tests may arise .",
    "these problems can be alleviated if , for example , positive entropic perturbations @xmath36 are introduced such that the effective speed of sound becomes a positive quantity .",
    "however , the introduction of entropic perturbations implies new free parameters : there are some degrees of arbitrariness , and in some cases , such as those of reference @xcite , it is possible only a slight extension to negative @xmath1 .",
    "another possibility of achieving negative values of @xmath1 is to implement a scalar version of the gcg model using a non - conservative theory of gravity , like rastall s theory .",
    "this has been done in reference @xcite , and in fact negative values of @xmath1 seem still to be favoured at the level of perturbations .",
    "this problem concerns not only the confrontation with the power spectrum data , but also the analysis of the anisotropy of the cosmic microwave background radiation ( cmb ) . in references",
    "@xcite , the confrontation of the gcg model with the cmb spectrum has been performed , indicating that the most favoured scenario implies @xmath15 , that is , the gcg model reduces to the @xmath6cdm model .",
    "this result is one of the reasons for speculating that the gcg model should be be ruled out .",
    "there are four main background tests for a cosmological model :    1 .   the differential age of old galaxies , given by @xmath10 .",
    "the sn ia data .",
    "3 .   the position of the first cmb acoustic peak .",
    "4 .   the peak position of the baryonic acoustic oscillations ( bao ) .    for the differential age data , connected with the evaluation of the age of old galaxies that have evolved passively , leading to values of @xmath10 for specific redshifts , there are 13 observational data @xcite .",
    "recently , a compilation of 21 data points has been considered @xcite .",
    "the fundamental relation is @xmath37 the value of the hubble parameter today obtained by the hst ( @xmath38 km s@xmath30 mpc@xmath30 ) could also be added to this sample , but this would imply a prior on the final parameter estimation and , therefore , will not be included here .",
    "the analysis with the sample of 13 data points for the chaplygin gas model has been made in reference @xcite , leading to the conclusion that slightly negative values for @xmath1 are favoured . in our analysis below we use the set of 21 data points compiled in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the sn ia test is based on the luminosity distance , given by @xmath39 for the sn ia data , we have two main problems .",
    "the first one concerns the choice of the sample .",
    "there are many different sn ia data set , obtained with different techniques . in some cases",
    ", these different samples may give very different results .",
    "the second point is the existence of two different calibration methods : one using cosmology and which takes into account sn with high @xmath27 ( salt2 ) ; the other using astrophysics methods , valid for small @xmath27 ( mlcs2k2 ) @xcite . in some case",
    ", the employment of different calibrations can lead to different results also .",
    "all this , make the sn ia analysis very delicate . here ,",
    "however , we use the union sample @xcite , calibrated by the salt2 method . this choice is motivated by looking for a contact with previous results in the literature , including those of reference @xcite .",
    "the position of the first peak of the cmb spectrum is a more complex test .",
    "it is linked to oscillations of the baryon - photon plasma at the recombination period and is given by @xmath40 a detailed numerical analysis leading to the following fitting formula for parameters of this fundamental quantity @xcite : @xmath41 we will use the following values for the different density parameter : @xmath42 from observation : @xmath43 .",
    "the baryonic acoustic oscillations are due to the effect of oscillations in the photon - baryon plasma at the moment of the decoupling , at about @xmath44 ( it is of course the same physics which produces the acoustic peaks structure in the cmb , but now this effect is observed in the baryonic distribution ) .",
    "this effect is quantified by the following expression @xcite : @xmath45 in this work we use data from the wigglez dark energy survey @xcite .",
    "the gcg behaves as dust in the past .",
    "hence , we should identify an effective dm component in the gcg in order to use the above formulas for the analysis .",
    "there are different prescriptions in this sense in the literature .",
    "we will adopt the decomposition proposed in @xcite , where the effective dm component is given by , @xmath46",
    "we perform a bayesian statistic analysis in comparing the theoretical predictions with the observational data . first ,",
    "for each dataset , we compute @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the theoretical prediction for the quantity @xmath49 , whereas @xmath50 is the corresponding observational datum , with an error estimation @xmath51 . from",
    "the chi - squared , we build the probability distribution function ( pdf ) , as follows : @xmath52 where we assumed the data to be independent and normally distributed ; @xmath53 is a normalization constant . as indicated , the pdf depends on three free parameters : @xmath54 , @xmath1 and @xmath55 , characterizing a three dimensional function .",
    "two and one dimensional pdf can be computed integrating ( marginalizing ) on the remaining parameters .",
    "as already said , we will compute the @xmath56 separately for each dataset .",
    "the total @xmath56 , for the set of the four observational tests , shall be the sum of the separated @xmath56 . accordingly to the exponential form of the pdf , in eq .",
    ", the total pdf shall be the product of the single ones .",
    "the intervals considered for each of the free parameters are crucial for the final estimations . for @xmath55 ,",
    "all values @xmath57 are considered . for @xmath54",
    "we consider both delta and constant priors i.e. , for the former prior we fix values for @xmath54 while for the latter we integrate in the interval @xmath58 . for @xmath1 ,",
    "the situation is more complex , since we can consider two possibilities : @xmath59 , in order to assure a transition from dust in the past to a cosmological constant in the future , or @xmath60 , in order to assure a positive square speed of sound .",
    "our goal here is to show that negative values for @xmath1 are preferred .",
    "therefore , we focus our analysis on the prior @xmath61 .",
    "however , for the sake of completeness , we also carry out a statistical analysis leaving @xmath1 free to vary to arbitrarily negative and positive values .",

    "this imply that the evolution of @xmath143 is also the same and therefore , if the components conserve independently , the evolution of the density contrasts of baryons and radiation are also respectively identical in the two models . since the latter two are the only observable components , one may conclude that the @xmath6cdm model and the @xmath5 gcg are indistinguishable , from gravity only .",

    "the uncertainty is still too large for us to claim that a `` tension '' with perturbative tests ( which constrain @xmath171 at 2@xmath3 ) does exist , but we speculate on the consequences of this occurrence , which is not far from being settled , given the ongoing and forthcoming observational programs which collect more precise data day after day .",

    "it is indistinguishable from the @xmath6cdm model at the linear perturbative regime , but we show that the small negative pressure of the gcg affects the evolution of the gcg density contrast during the matter dominated phase , where it is expected to behave as cdm and provides a different evolution for the sub - horizon matter perturbations .",
    "this analysis shows that sub - horizon structures ( e.g. dark halos ) may not form as in the standard @xmath6cdm case .",
