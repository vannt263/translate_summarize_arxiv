    "the prior probability of the codes , consisting of @xmath0 binary bits ( @xmath1 ) , is defined as @xmath2 where @xmath3 denotes the parity index and @xmath4 denotes the set of node indices involved in the @xmath5-th parity .",

    "the error floor appeared in the area where @xmath78 was greater than about @xmath85 db .",
    "this error floor probably occurred due to the short loop of the parity check matrix .",
    "figure [ fig : outerloop ] shows the time ( outer - loop step ) evolution of the rate for both the not - correctly - decoded and wrongly - decoded cases . in the early outer - loop steps , bp tended to reach the correct codeword first , and then cccp and bl followed . in the later steps",

    "these results suggest that the bl algorithm will outperform bp and cccp if we can afford a high calculation cost  for example , @xmath87 outer - loop steps .",
    "the calculation cost is roughly proportional to the number of inner loops ( we regard that of bp to be @xmath12 ) .",

    "if we consider the average number of outer loops , the difference could become larger ( e.g. , @xmath89 ) , but this depends on the upper limit on the number of outer loops .",
    "parallelization is also an important factor regarding calculation cost .",
    "briefly , parallelization of the bp loop is possible .",
    "it is also possible for the outer loops of cccp and bl , but not for the inner loop of cccp . on the other hand , it is indispensable for the inner loop of bl to achieve fast convergence .",
    "parameter optimization of the three algorithms is a real problem . in the case of bp",
    ", we have to determine only the upper limit of the outer loops . for cccp , we also have to determine the number of inner loops . for bl , in addition to the cccp parameters , we have to determine the step width of the natural gradient descent . empirically , the configuration of the step width appears rather robust since the simulated bl performance generally exceeded that of the other algorithms ( fig .",
    "[ fig : errorrates ] ) even though they shared a common step width configuration ( i.e. , @xmath77 ) .",
    "the optimization of the parity check matrix is also a problem , especially for short - length ldpcc .",
    "we will further investigate the dependence of these algorithms on the matrix in our future work .",
    "the method we have proposed minimizes the bethe free energy based on the bowman - levin ( bl ) approximation .",

    "simulation showed that the bl algorithm outperformed the bp and cccp algorithms , although the bl calculation cost was greater .",
