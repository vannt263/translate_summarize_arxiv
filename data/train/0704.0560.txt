    "quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) was the first quantum field theory to be formulated and has successfully passed every experimental test at low and intermediate fields .",
    "a well - known example of qed effects at low fields ( @xmath0 v / cm ) is the lamb shift in hydrogen @xcite . at low fields , the qed effects ( self - energy and vacuum polarisation )",
    "can still be treated as a perturbation , only taking into account lower order terms @xcite . however , up to now qed calculations have never been tested at high fields ( @xmath1 v / cm ) because such fields can not be produced in a laboratory , nor by the strongest lasers available . at high fields , perturbative qed is no longer",
    "valid and higher order terms become important as well @xcite .",
    "experiments carried out at high fields therefore test different aspects of qed calculations and are complementary to high - precision tests of the lower order terms .",
    "heavy atoms that have been stripped of almost all their electrons , the so - called highly - charged ions ( hci ) , are ideal ` laboratories ' for tests of qed at high fields .",
    "these ions have , for example , electric field strengths of the order of @xmath2 v / cm close to the nucleus @xcite and can be produced at high velocities at the gesellschaft fr schwerionenforschung ( gsi ) in darmstadt , germany .    at the hitrap facility , which is currently being built at gsi",
    ", ions coming from the experimental storage ring ( esr ) with mev energies will be slowed down by linear and radiofrequency stages to kev kinetic energies , trapped and cooled down to sub - ev energies , and finally made available for experiments . within the hitrap project",
    ", instrumentation is being developed for high - precision measurements of atomic and nuclear properties , mass and g - factor measurements and ion - atom and ion - surface interaction studies @xcite .",
    "hydrogen- and lithium - like ions are the best candidates for our studies , since they have @xmath3-electrons which are very close to the nucleus .",
    "the ( higher order ) qed effects are most pronounced at the high fields close to the nucleus , therefore the best measurable quantity is the ground state hyperfine splitting ( hfs ) . due to the simple electronic structure of h- and li - like species , accurate ( higher order )",
    "calculations of ground state hfs can be done , which will then be compared with accurate experimental results .    as a first approximation , good within about 4% ,",
    "the energy of the @xmath4s@xmath5 ground state hfs of hydrogen - like ions is given by @xcite : @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the fine structure constant , @xmath8 is the nuclear @xmath9-factor ( with @xmath10 the nuclear magnetic moment and @xmath11 the nuclear magneton ) , @xmath12 the nuclear spin , @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the electron and proton mass , respectively , and @xmath15 is the speed of light .",
    "equation ( [ eq1 ] ) represents the normal ground state hfs multiplied by a correction @xmath16 for the relativistic energy of the @xmath3-electron , and by a factor @xmath17 , which takes the ` breit - schawlow ' ( bs ) effect into account .",
    "the bs effect is due to the spatial distribution of the nuclear charge .",
    "it corrects for the fact that we can not assume a homogeneous charge distribution over a spherical nucleus .",
    "the values for @xmath18 were taken from @xcite , those for @xmath19 and @xmath12 from @xcite . in principle",
    "eq.([eq1 ] ) should also contain a correction for the finite nuclear mass , but since this correction is very small it can be neglected @xcite .",
    "the energy of the @xmath20s@xmath5 ground state hfs of lithium - like ions only differs from eq.([eq1 ] ) by a factor @xmath21 and by the @xmath16-value @xcite .",
    "however , eq.([eq1 ] ) requires two further important corrections , the one of most interest to us being that which corrects for the qed effects .",
    "the other correction takes the ` bohr - weisskopf ' ( bw ) effect into account @xcite .",
    "the bw effect is due to the spatial distribution of the nuclear magnetisation and is only known with an accuracy of 20 - 30 % , which is mainly due to the single - particle model used for its calculation @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , the qed effects are of the same order of magnitude as the uncertainty in the bw effect @xcite .",
    "thus , from a hfs measurement of a single species ( _ i.e. _ h- or li - like ) the qed effects can not be determined accurately .    equation ( [ eq1 ] ) can also be written as @xmath22 , where the constant @xmath23 includes everything except the qed effects . since the equations for the @xmath24 and @xmath25 states are so similar , it is possible to write the difference between the two hfs as @xmath26 @xcite .",
    "the factor @xmath27 only contains non - qed terms and can be calculated to a high precision @xcite . from the difference between the hfs measurements of h- and li - like ions of the same isotope , the qed effects can thus be determined within a few percent .",
    "however , this requires measurements of transition wavelengths with an experimental resolution of the order of @xmath28 .",
    "the transition lifetime @xmath29 is defined as @xmath30 ( see _ e.g. _ @xcite ) .",
    "the transition probability @xmath31 , for an @xmath32 transition from the excited to the lower hyperfine state , is given by @xcite @xmath33 where @xmath34 is planck s constant divided by @xmath35 and @xmath36 is related to the electron s angular momentum @xcite . from eq.([eq2 ] ) it can be seen that @xmath31 scales with the transition frequency as @xmath37 , whereas @xmath38 is proportional to @xmath39 , see eq.([eq1 ] ) .",
    "therefore , the transition lifetime scales with @xmath40 as @xmath41 and is roughly of the order of milliseconds for @xmath42 .",
    ".calculated hfs transition wavelengths ( @xmath43 ) and lifetimes ( @xmath29 ) of the most interesting ion species for systematic studies .",
    "also shown are the nuclear spin ( @xmath12 ) and magnetic moment ( @xmath10 ) , taken from @xcite .",
    "the half - lives of these species are longer than 10 minutes .",
    "( the values listed are truncated and the qed and bw effects are not included . ) [ cols=\"<,<,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tab1 ]    in table [ tab1 ] the calculated transition wavelengths ( @xmath43 ) and lifetimes ( @xmath29 ) , together with their corresponding @xmath12 and @xmath10 values , of the most interesting species for our laser spectroscopy studies are listed .",
    "( the qed and bw effects are not taken into account . )",
    "the half - lives of these species exceed 10 minutes , which corresponds to the minimum time required for a measurement .",
    "although the wavelengths span a broad range , roughly from 200 to 1600 nm , these transitions are still accessible with standard laser systems .",
    "the three species ( pb @xcite , cl @xcite and ar @xcite ) at the bottom of the table are considered as candidates for pilot experiments .",
    "they are singly charged ions , which are easily produced , have @xmath32 transitions at convenient wavelengths , and can be used to test the laser spectroscopy part of the experiment .",
    "a measurement of the hfs in @xmath44pb@xmath45 is of special interest , because it will be possible to extract the value of @xmath10 .",
    "currently two different values exist , which unfortunately leads to a 2% difference in the hfs calculations @xcite .    in principle ,",
    "similar experiments could be carried out with metastable hafnium ( @xmath46hf , level energy 1141 kev , half - life 5.5 h @xcite ) . for h - like hafnium ,",
    "the transition values are @xmath47 nm and @xmath48 ms . for the li - like ion , @xmath49 nm and @xmath50",
    "ms are obtained .",
    "the difficulty with this isotope is that its nucleus is in an excited state , which is difficult to produce .",
    "figure [ fig1 ] shows the calculated transition wavelengths of all h - like lead , and all h- and li - like bismuth isotopes with half - lives exceeding 10 minutes .",
    "( the qed and bw effects are not included . ) the isotopes are labelled by their corresponding atomic mass units ( in @xmath51 ) and the stable isotopes ( @xmath44pb and @xmath52bi ) are indicated by the small arrows . for pb ,",
    "only the h - like isotopes are accessible with standard lasers , because the transition wavelengths of li - like isotopes are much longer than 1600 nm . for bi , many isotopes of both ion species are accessible , although their transition wavelengths differ considerably .    from fig.[fig1",
    "] it is clear that both elements offer many candidates for laser spectroscopy measurements of ground state hfs and that bismuth , in particular , allows for a systematic study of the ( higher order ) qed effects at high fields .",
    "furthermore , a systematic study of different isotopes of the same species , for example a study of the h - like pb isotopes , will make it possible to study trends in nuclear properties across a range of isotopes .    .",
    "( the qed and bw effects are not included.),width=283 ]    there already exist two previous measurements of the @xmath53 ground state hfs in @xmath52bi .",
    "a direct measurement @xcite was carried out using the esr at gsi ( darmstadt ) , but unfortunately no resonance was found at the predicted value of @xmath54 nm @xcite . an indirect measurement @xcite was performed in an electron beam ion trap ( ebit ) and yielded a value of @xmath55 nm , but the error in the measurement was rather large ( @xmath56 nm ) . in the esr",
    "the ions have relativistic velocities ( @xmath57 mev / u ) , which are used to shift the transition wavelength to a lower value ( @xmath58 nm ) , and the transitions are doppler - broadened ( @xmath59 ghz ) . in the ebit",
    "the ions have temperatures of several hundreds of ev ( @xmath60 k ) , which lead to considerable doppler broadening ( @xmath61 ghz ) .",
    "the resolution obtained in previous measurements at the esr is of the order of @xmath62 , whereas that of the ebit measurement is of the order of @xmath63 .",
    "a detailed description of the proposed experiments , as well as a treatment of the techniques used , can be found elsewhere @xcite .",
    "briefly , an externally produced bunch of roughly @xmath64 hci at an energy of a few kev is loaded into a cylindrical open - endcap penning trap @xcite on axis , _ i.e. _ along the magnetic field lines .",
    "electron capture ( neutralisation ) by collisions is strongly reduced by operating the trap at cryogenic temperatures under uhv conditions .",
    "the hci are captured in flight , confined , cooled by ` resistive cooling ' @xcite and radially compressed by a ` rotating wall ' @xcite technique . after these steps a cold and dense ion cloud is obtained .",
    "the spectroscopy laser enters the trap axially through an open - endcap and will fully irradiate the ion cloud .",
    "the fluorescence from the excited hci is detected perpendicular to the cooled axial motion ( trap axis ) through segmented ring electrodes , which are covered by a highly - transparent copper mesh .",
    "( the ring is segmented for the rotating wall technique . )",
    "the above mentioned transition lifetimes imply that , for a detection efficiency of @xmath65 , acceptable fluorescence rates , up to a few thousand counts per second , from @xmath32 transitions can be expected from a ( @xmath66 mm diameter ) cloud of @xmath64 ions @xcite .",
    "confining the hci in a trap , and cooling and compressing the cloud , will thus enable fluorescence detection and ensure long interrogation times by the laser .",
    "however , due to the high density of hci in the cloud , space charge effects will play a role and will lead to shifts of the motional frequencies of the trapped ions .",
    "we have studied this effect in detail and understand the corresponding frequency shifts well @xcite .",
    "since these shifts are fairly small , the ( frequency dependent ) cooling and compression techniques can still be applied .",
    "the hci also need to be strongly cooled to reduce doppler broadening of the transitions .",
    "this will be achieved by resistive cooling of the ( axial ) ion motion in the trap .",
    "for example , for the @xmath67 transition in @xmath44pb@xmath68 at @xmath69 hz , the doppler broadened linewidth at a temperature of 4 k is @xmath70 hz . the anticipated resolution is therefore of the order of @xmath71 .",
    "this is three orders of magnitude better than any previous measurement , see _",
    "@xcite , and good enough to measure the qed effects within a few percent .",
