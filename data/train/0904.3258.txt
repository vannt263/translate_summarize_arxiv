    "quantum measurement is a subject of importance both as a central part of quantum theory @xcite and for its relevance to quantum information theory @xcite . at the most basic level ,",
    "the measurement is commonly thought of as a sudden projective operation that leaves the measured system in an eigenstate of the probed operator .",
    "it should be kept in mind , however , that the measurement process is a physical process that follows from a physical interaction between the measured system and the measuring device . as a result ,",
    "any realistic measurement is carried out over a finite duration .",
    "one can therefore have the situation where the measurement process occurs concurrently with other physical processes .",
    "this is the situation that we consider in this paper .",
    "although the analysis and results of this paper should be valid for a variety of different physical settings , we find it useful to formulate the analysis in terms of a specific setup . in this paper , we use the example of a double - quantum - dot charge qubit that is probed by a quantum point contact ( qpc ) @xcite .",
    "the principle of the measurement is the fact that the current in the qpc is sensitive to the charge state of the qubit . by measuring the current passing through the qpc",
    ", one can infer the state of the qubit .",
    "one limitation that arises in practical situations is that , in order to minimize the effects of the detector on the qubit at times when no measurement is performed ( e.g.  during the implementation of quantum gates ) , the qubit - detector coupling is set to a value that is small compared to the qubit s energy scale . as a result",
    "one must deal with some form of weak - measurement regime .",
    "this type of weak , charge - sensitive readout works well when the qubit is biased such that the charge states are eigenstates of the hamiltonian and therefore do not mix during the measurement . in this case",
    "one can allow the detector to probe the qubit for as long as is needed to obtain a high signal - to - noise ratio , without having to worry about any intrinsic qubit dynamics .",
    "in contrast to the simple situation described above , when the detector weakly probes the charge state of the qubit while the hamiltonian induces mixing dynamics between charge states , it becomes unclear how to interpret a given measurement signal .",
    "given the fact that the signal typically contains a large amount of detector - related noise and the measurement causes unavoidable relaxation in the qubit , it might seem that this type of measurement can not be used to determine the initial state of the qubit , i.e.  at the time that the experimenter decides to perform the measurement . indeed , there have been a number of studies analyzing the measurement - induced decoherence and the evolution of the qubit s state in this situation @xcite , but not the question of how to take the measurement data and extract from it information about the initial state of the qubit .",
    "this question is a key issue for qubit - state readout and is the main subject of this paper .",
    "we shall show below that high - fidelity measurement information can be extracted from the measurement data , provided that additional decoherence mechanisms are weak and the readout signal can be monitored at a sufficiently short timescale .",
    "it turns out that not only the measurement result , but also the measurement basis , is determined stochastically in this case . in spite of the uncontrollability of the measurement basis , the measurement results contain meaningful information about the initial state of the qubit . in order to demonstrate this statement",
    ", we show how these results can be used to perform quantum state tomography on the qubit .",
    "these results show that under suitable conditions and by proper analysis of the measurement data useful information about the state of the qubit can be extracted from this data .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "ii we introduce the theoretical model for describing a charge qubit probed by a qpc . in sec .",
    "iii we formulate the theoretical framework for the qubit evolution conditioned on the qpc s output signal and how measurement information can be extracted from this signal .",
    "we also introduce an equation that supplements the stochastic master equation for purposes of interpreting the measured qpc signal . in sec .",
    "iv we present results of numerical calculations that display a number of interesting results in this system , most importantly the stochastic nature of the measurement basis and the near - independence of the measurement fidelity from the relation between the charge basis and energy eigenbasis . in sec .",
    "v we discuss how decoherence can be introduced to the problem and how one should interpret the measurement data in the presence of decoherence .",
    "we analyze one simple example that shows how the measurement data recorded at later times is less ` valuable ' than that recorded at earlier times .",
    "concluding remarks are given in sec .",
    "some details of the calculations are given in the appendices .",
    "and @xmath0 measured by a quantum point contact ( qpc ) , ( b ) the probability distributions of the possible qpc current values for the two charge states of the qubit , ( c ) the filled energy levels of the qpc s electrodes and the energy barriers for tunneling between the electrodes for the two charge states of the qubit and ( d ) a typical qpc current signal .",
    "the finite widths of the probability distributions in ( b ) are a result of the finite measurement time .",
    "when the distance between the two center points , @xmath1 , is much smaller than the widths of the distributions , the qpc performs a weak measurement on the qubit in the short interval under consideration ( i.e. , the time interval for which these probability distributions are relevant ) . the fast fluctuations in (",
    "d ) convey the assumption that these fluctuations have a much shorter timescale than the qubit s precession period . in plotting ( b - d )",
    "we have assumed that @xmath2 , which would be the case if the qubit is defined by an extra positive charge ( e.g.  a hole ) tunneling between the two wells .",
    "taking the opposite case , i.e.  @xmath3 , would only result in a few sign changes in the analysis below .",
    "the main results are not affected by this choice.,width=302 ]    we consider a system composed of a charge qubit capacitively coupled to a qpc , as illustrated in fig .  1 .",
    "the qubit can be viewed as a system where a charged particle is trapped in a double - well potential and can occupy , and tunnel between , the localized ground states of the two wells .",
    "we shall denote these states by @xmath4 and @xmath0 .    during the measurement",
    "a voltage is applied to the qpc , and a current flows through it .",
    "except for the discussion given in sec .",
    "v , we shall assume that the qpc does not induce any qubit decoherence except that associated with the measurement - induced projection . before analyzing the general case , we first consider the case where the qubit hamiltonian is diagonal in the charge basis . in this case",
    ", there is no mechanism by which the states @xmath4 and @xmath0 mix during the system dynamics . as a result ,",
    "if the qubit is initially in the state @xmath4 , the long - time - averaged qpc current will be given by @xmath5 , and the qubit will remain in the state @xmath4 .",
    "a similar statement applies to the state @xmath0 of the qubit , with corresponding qpc current @xmath6 .",
    "the qpc current therefore serves as an indicator of the qubit s state in the charge basis @xmath7 , as long as the qubit hamiltonian does not mix the states of this basis .    on any finite timescale",
    ", there will be fluctuations in the qpc current , and the observed value might deviate from @xmath5 or @xmath6 .",
    "the longer the period over which the averaging is made , the smaller the fluctuations .",
    "one can therefore define a measurement timescale that determines how long one needs to wait in order to distinguish between the states @xmath4 and @xmath0 .",
    "the relation between this timescale and the qubit s hamiltonian - induced precession period separates two measurement regimes : strong and weak qubit - detector coupling . as mentioned above , this separation is irrelevant when the qubit hamiltonian is diagonal in the charge basis .    for the remainder of this paper , we analyze the general case where the qubit hamiltonian is not necessarily diagonal in the charge basis .",
    "the hamiltonian of the combined qubit+qpc system can be expressed as @xmath8 in describing the qubit , we shall use the eigenbasis of the qubit hamiltonian @xmath9 .",
    "thus @xmath9 can be expressed as @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the energy splitting between the qubit s two energy levels , and @xmath12 is the @xmath13-axis pauli matrix .",
    "we shall express the ground and excited states of the hamiltonian as @xmath14 and @xmath15 , respectively .",
    "the electric dipole moment operator @xmath16 can be expressed as @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is a vector that represents the direction of the charge basis relative to the energy eigenbasis : @xmath19 where @xmath20 represents the angle between the charge basis and the energy eigenbasis .",
    "the states of the charge basis ( i.e. , the eigenstates of @xmath17 ) can be expressed as @xmath21 the qpc hamiltonian @xmath22 can be expressed as @xmath23 where the operators @xmath24 and @xmath25 , respectively , annihilate electrons in the source and drain electrodes of the qpc , @xmath26 and @xmath27 are their hermitian conjugates , @xmath28 and @xmath29 are the energies of single - particle quantum states in the source and drain electrodes , and @xmath30 represents tunneling matrix elements between the two electrodes .",
    "we take the qubit - qpc interaction hamiltonian to be of the form @xcite @xmath31 such that the tunneling matrix elements ( and therefore the qpc current ) depend on the state of the qubit in the charge basis .",
    "the qpc and its operation are illustrated in figs .",
    "1(b - d ) .",
    "when @xmath32 and @xmath33 are independent of @xmath34 and @xmath35 , the microscopic degrees of freedom of the qpc are not affected by , and therefore do not carry any information about , the state of the qubit .",
    "this information is carried only by the total number of electrons that have tunneled through the qpc . in the remainder of this paper",
    ", we shall assume that this is the case .",
    "we close this section by mentioning that the above description of the microscopic structure of the qpc is not needed for the analysis below , provided one accepts the description of the qpc operation explained in sec .",
    "iii as a phenomenological model of the detector .",
    "indeed , the analysis below is not restricted to the case of a charge qubit probed by a qpc .",
    "in this section we introduce the theoretical framework for analyzing the qubit state evolution and interpreting the observed measurement data .",
    "we start our analysis by considering a short time interval between times @xmath36 and @xmath37 . for definiteness",
    ", we assume that during this time interval a large number of electrons tunnel through the qpc , such that it is natural to define a qpc current @xmath38 during this short interval ( the current would be defined as the amount of charge that has passed through the qpc divided by @xmath39 ; the small - current case will be discussed in sec .",
    "we also assume that a weak - coupling regime exists for a properly chosen value of @xmath39 , which means that the qpc - current probability distributions ( for the states @xmath4 and @xmath0 ) are broad and almost completely overlap , as shown in fig .",
    "the coherence time of the qpc and the time resolution of the qpc s output signal are both assumed to be much shorter than the precession period of the qubit . as a result , for a properly chosen value of @xmath39 one can treat the different time intervals as independent measurement processes , with each measurement being made in the charge basis .    as explained in appendix",
    "a , the qpc - current probability distribution for the qubit state @xmath4 can be expressed as @xmath40 = \\sqrt{\\frac{2\\delta t \\left ( \\delta \\ !",
    "i \\right)^2}{\\pi \\tau_m \\left ( \\delta \\overline{i } \\right)^2 } } \\exp \\left\\ { - \\frac{2\\delta t \\left ( i-\\overline{i}_l\\right)^2}{\\tau_m \\left(\\delta\\overline{i}\\right)^2 } \\right\\},\\ ] ] and a similar expression can be derived for the qubit state @xmath0 . here",
    "we have defined a number of useful quantities : @xmath41 is the size of a finite interval of qpc currents that we identify with a single value .",
    "one could say that with this definition we are turning the probability distributions in fig .",
    "1(b ) into histograms with discrete possible values for the current @xmath42 .",
    "this definition will be useful for both the analytic and numerical calculations below .",
    "the characteristic measurement time @xmath43 defines the timescale needed for the qpc output to distinguish between the states @xmath4 and @xmath0 , and @xmath44 , where for definiteness we take @xmath2 .",
    "we can now construct matrices that describe the qubit - state evolution depending on the observed qpc current @xmath38 .",
    "when a given value of @xmath38 is observed in the qpc , the density matrix @xmath45 describing the quantum state of the qubit is projected ( possibly partially ) according to the observed value .",
    "this projection of the qubit s state is described by a @xmath46 matrix ( or propagator ) that we shall call @xmath47 $ ] :    @xmath48\\hat{u}_m[i(t),\\delta \\ !",

    "the qubit therefore starts in the maximally mixed state @xmath74 after a measurement that produces the outcome corresponding to the matrix @xmath68 $ ] ( and ignoring the presence of the rotation matrix @xmath75 $ ] for purposes of this argument ) , the qubit ends up in a state described by the density matrix @xmath76 this density matrix describes a statistical mixture of the states @xmath71 and @xmath72 , with a higher probability for the former ( except for the rare cases where @xmath77 ) .",
    "one can therefore say that , as a result of the measurement , one now knows that the qubit is more likely to be in the state @xmath71 than in the state @xmath72 , in contrast to the complete lack of information at the initial time .",
    "the states @xmath71 and @xmath72 therefore represent the measurement basis that corresponds to the output signal @xmath38 .",
    "the measurement fidelity is calculated as follows @xcite : let us assume that one is given a qubit that is in an unknown state , either @xmath71 or @xmath72 .",
    "the parameters @xmath78 are the probabilities that the outcome defined by @xmath38 , @xmath41 and @xmath39 is obtained given that the qubit was initially in the state @xmath79 . upon observing this outcome ,",
    "if one wants to make a guess about the state of the qubit , one would maximize the probability of making a correct guess by choosing the state @xmath71 .",
    "the difference between the probability of actually finding the state @xmath71 and that of finding the orthogonal state @xmath72 is given by @xmath80 this expression can therefore naturally be interpreted as the measurement fidelity .",
    "it is worth pausing here to comment on the issue of the independence of the measurement basis from the measurement outcome .",
    "one typically thinks of the measurement basis as being determined by the experimenter when designing the experimental setup and the measurement result ( i.e. , @xmath81 or @xmath82 along the measurement axis ) being determined stochastically according to the rules of quantum mechanics based on the measurement basis used in the experiment .",
    "the situation considered in this paper , however , can not be described using this simple picture .",
    "here we have a two - state quantum system and a measurement device that produces one of many possible outcomes , not necessarily all providing information in the same basis . in this case , the picture of the measurement basis being independent of the outcome is not valid in general .",
    "for example , it is possible in a general setting for a certain state @xmath83 to be a possible result of the data analysis presented above , but not the state orthogonal to it .",
    "such a situation arises in the problem analyzed in ref .",
    "@xcite , and it complicates the interpretation of the measurement data . fortunately , because in this paper we are dealing with two symmetric probability distributions [ see fig .  1(b ) ] , we find that for every possible qpc signal there is an ` opposite ' or ` flipped ' signal , which can be obtained by taking the mirror image about the central line in fig .",
    "1(d ) [ this central line is defined by @xmath52 ] .",
    "it is not difficult to verify that if a given signal corresponds to a certain measured state @xmath83 , the ` opposite ' signal will correspond to the orthogonal state with the same values of @xmath85 and @xmath86 ( see appendix b for the full derivation ) .",
    "an important consequence of the above statement is that the total probability of finding one of two opposite signals is independent of the initial state of the qubit .",
    "hence , the probability of obtaining a certain measurement basis is independent of the initial state of the qubit",
    ". this fact leads naturally to the conceptual interpretation that the measurement basis is determined according to some stochastic process , and the measurement result along that basis is made after the basis has been determined .    to summarize , the qpc s output signal can be used to derive the matrix @xmath87 $ ] .",
    "this matrix can then be used to determine the measurement basis , the measurement result ( i.e. , @xmath88 along the measurement axis ) , the fidelity ( or in other words , the degree of certainty about the obtained measurement result ) and the post - measurement rotation . note that all the analysis above is performed independently of the initial state of the qubit .",
    "if one knows the initial state , one can use the evolution matrices in order to determine the probabilities of different outcomes , as well as the final state of the qubit after the measurement .",
    "as we shall show below , when the measurement fidelity approaches one , the final state can be determined even without any knowledge about the initial state .",
    "it is worth mentioning here that the analysis presented above can be applied not only to qubits , but also to systems with higher - dimensional hilbert spaces .",
    "the main complication in the case of higher dimensions is that the description of the results becomes more intricate and less transparent . in this context",
    "one can contrast the simple visualization of any qubit density matrix as a point in the so - called bloch sphere , whereas there is no visually simple parametrization for a general density matrix of a three - state system .",

    "we have thus established the relation between the matrices @xmath311 $ ] and @xmath312 $ ] .      in this appendix",
    ", we show that the measurement fidelity for two misaligned weak measurements can be higher than that obtained when the measurement axes of the two measurements are aligned with each other @xcite .    with no loss of generality , we take the measurement axis of the first measurement to be the @xmath13 axis ( i.e. , the basis @xmath313 ) .",
    "we assume that the measurement produces one of two possible outcomes .",
    "the measurement matrices can therefore be expressed as @xmath314 where we have neglected any coherent component in the measurement matrix , as explained in the main text .",
    "the above matrices satisfy the basic requirement that @xmath315 .",
    "the second measurement is performed in the basis @xmath316 .",
    "the corresponding measurement matrices are given by      the combined measurement has four possible measurement matrices , each one corresponding to one of the four possible outcomes .",
    "for example , for the outcome identified with the index 1 in both measurements , the measurement matrix is given by @xmath318 . in order to obtain the measurement fidelity for this outcome",
    ", we need to consider the matrix @xmath319    if we denote the eigenvalues of this matrix by @xmath85 and @xmath86 ( with @xmath320 ) , the measurement fidelity for this outcome is given by @xmath321 . for purposes of calculating the overall fidelity of the measurement sequence , we take the maximally mixed state , @xmath322 as the initial state . with this initial state ,",
    "the probability that the above outcome is obtained in a given experimental run is given by @xmath323 .",
    "thus , the overall fidelity ( taking into account all four possible outcomes ) will be given by the sum of four terms , each of which is given by @xmath324 for one of the possible outcomes .",
    "( [ eq : u1u2u2u1 ] ) straightforward algebra gives the result that @xmath325 similar expressions can be obtained for the three other possible outcomes , resulting in the overall fidelity @xmath326 where @xmath327 and @xmath328 .",
    "the measurement fidelity can have its maximum at any point between zero and @xmath329 ( with the proper choice of the parameters @xmath330 and @xmath331 ; we have verified this statement numerically ) .",
    "for the special case @xmath332 and @xmath333 , the overall measurement fidelity is given by @xmath334 differentiating this expression twice shows that it has a maximum at @xmath335 .",
    "in fact , in the limit of weak measurement , i.e.  @xmath336 , one can see easily that the above expression can be approximated by @xmath337 which has minima at @xmath338 and @xmath339 ( @xmath340 ) and a maximum at @xmath341 ( @xmath342 ) .",
    "the relative difference between the minimum and maximum fidelities is approximately 30% .",
    "the result that the fidelity of two weak measurement can be enhanced when they are not aligned with one another offers some explanation for the result of sec .",
    "iv that the fidelity increases more rapidly when the qubit hamiltonian and the probed operator do not commute .",
    "the qubit hamiltonian causes a rotation in the qubit s state while the state is being measured along a fixed axis .",
    "this situation is , in some sense , equivalent to one where a number of different qubit operators are sequentially probed .",
    "a final comment that is worth making here regards the possible bases of the combined measurement .",
    "as can be seen from the analysis of this appendix , when the two performed measurements correspond to directions in the @xmath137-@xmath13 plane , all the resulting matrices will be real . as a result",
    ", all the possible effective measurements will be in the @xmath137-@xmath13 plane as well ( note that a projector along the @xmath138 axis would be complex ) .",
    "in other words , when successive measurements are made in one plane , they can only result in effective measurements made in the same plane .",
    "this result explains why in the special case @xmath136 all the possible measurement bases lay in the @xmath137-@xmath138 plane ; successive measurements along the @xmath137 axis separated by state precession about the @xmath13 axis are equivalent to a sequence of measurements that are all performed in the @xmath137-@xmath138 plane .",
    "we start with the objective of performing quantum state tomography using the available measurement data , which we assume has been obtained using a ( generally weakly coupled ) qpc as explained in the main text .",
    "we note that since the measurements in the different experimental runs are generally performed in different bases , we look for a procedure that treats all the measurements on equal footing and does not have a preferred measurement basis , or set of bases .",
    "one obvious approach to follow is to construct a function that assigns a penalty for any deviation by the ` guess ' density matrix @xmath343 from a given experimental result ( which takes the form of a measured , pure state ) .",
    "the guess density matrix is characterized by the spherical coordinates @xmath344 , @xmath345 and @xmath346 , whereas the measured state is characterized by only the angles in spherical coordinates",
    "@xmath347 and @xmath348 ( the index @xmath168 denotes the different experimental runs ) . the function to be minimized for purposes of state tomography will therefore have the form @xmath349    in order to proceed further , we now consider what is done in the standard version of state tomography where the average values @xmath350 , @xmath351 and @xmath352 are measured and the density matrix @xmath353 is inferred from the measurement data . if we take the measurement data for @xmath12 , we know that we want the tomography procedure to produce the result @xmath354 , where @xmath355 and @xmath356 are the numbers of times that the measurement results @xmath81 and @xmath82 were obtained , respectively .",
    "we can therefore see that the function @xmath357 will only be a function of @xmath358 ( or , in other words , the projection of the vector representing the guess density matrix along the measurement axis ) . taking this measurement data , we find that the function @xmath359 has the form : @xmath360 in order to minimize the function @xmath359 , we take its derivative with respect to @xmath361 : @xmath362        where @xmath365 . in order to ensure that the function @xmath359 has a minimum at @xmath366",
    ", we must choose @xmath367 for every even number @xmath35 .",
    "the simplest choice is @xmath368 and @xmath369 .",
    "this choice gives the function @xmath370 ^ 2,\\ ] ] which , when generalized to the case where the measurement axis is not necessarily the @xmath13 axis , gives eq .",
