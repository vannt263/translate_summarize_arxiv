    "the single species reaction - diffusion systems @xmath2 ( coalescence ) and @xmath3 ( annihilation ) have been studied extensively in recent times @xcite .",
    "a common interest in these papers is the departure from mean field behaviour and the computation of exact long - term asymptotics for the particle density .",
    "recently , it was predicted in @xcite that the large time asymptotics for the probability @xmath4 of finding @xmath5 particles in a fixed volume @xmath6 : @xmath7 note that the predictions for @xmath8 agree with mean field behaviour .",
    "the second part of the exponent in @xmath9 reflects multi - scaling , or deviation from linear scaling . in @xmath10",
    "the multi - scaling is manifested in the second logarithmic term .",
    "this type of scaling is indicative of particles being _ anti - correlated _",
    "these predictions were obtained by use of the dynamical perturbative renormalization group methods in a field theoretic setting @xcite .",
    "the setting here is for finite rate reactions , leading to annihilations of randomly walking particles on a fixed lattice .",
    "after renormalization the large time limit rate tends to an instantaneous reaction @xcite .",
    "moreover the predictions carry over to the coalescing case , since they have the same effective field theory @xcite .",
    "the aim of this paper is to verify the conjectures of @xcite in dimension @xmath11 , where detailed probabilistic tools are available .",
    "we consider a system of coalescing brownian particles on the real line .",
    "each particle evolves independently until it collides with another particle , at which time the two colliding particles instantaneously coalesce into one .",

    "the existence of such a density is dicussed in the appendix .",
    "our main result can be stated precisely as the following asymptotic : @xmath15where @xmath16 .",
    "this asymptotic has the meaning that the left hand side is bounded above and below by constant multiples @xmath17 of the right hand side .",
    "the upper bound is not actually an asymptotic , in that it holds simultaneously for all initial conditions , for all @xmath18 and for all @xmath19 , with a constant @xmath20 depending only on @xmath0 and @xmath21 .",

    "the key tool is the karlin - mcgregor formula for the non - coincidence probabilities for brownian motions .",
    "useful upper and lower bounds on this transition density , which already display the key anomalous scaling term @xmath29 , are developed in section [ s3 ] , by exploiting a representation known as the harish - chandra - itzykson - zuber formula ( developed for random matrix problems ) .",

    "it was shown in this special case that the @xmath0-point density correlation function for the two systems are the same apart from the amplitude .",
    "this set of exact results was used to test the predictions ( [ eq : mainpaper1 ] ) in @xcite .",
    "the large time scaling of the formulae for the @xmath0-point density functions given in @xcite are not obvious as they involve a large combinatorial sum of terms with alternating signs .",
    "the problem of deriving rigourously the logarithmic corrections ( [ eq : mainpaper1 ] ) to the mean field answers in dimension @xmath10 remains open .",
    "it would also be interesting to find out if there is a natural multi - fractal interpretation of the multi - scaling .",
    "another simple system for which rg calculations predict multi - scaling in the stationary state is the system of aggregating massive point clusters with stationary source of light particles .",
