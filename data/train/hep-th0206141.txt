    "in a context of string theory , we have realized a correspondence between gravity and gauge theory .",
    "we usually consider gauge theories which live on branes .",
    "then , strong coupling dynamics of gauge theories could be analyzed by classical supergravity solutions for brane configurations .",
    "one important research direction is to give such examples and check a correspondence with less amount of supersymmetry than original ads / cft correspondence @xcite .",
    "one of practical problems to overcome here is to construct explicit supergravity solutions for brane configurations with various background fluxes which realize given gauge theories .",
    "there are several approaches to provide such supergravity solutions based on ads / cft correspondence .",
    "for example , see @xcite and so on .    in this article , we consider wrapped branes introduced by maldacena and nunez @xcite .",
    "wrapped branes are objects which wrap around supersymmetric cycles inside non - compact special holonomy manifolds .",
    "wrapped branes have been identified with supersymmetric magnetically charged solutions in various gauged supergravities .",
    "solutions in gauged supergravities give near horizon geometries of various branes .",
    "they also have information on isometries of compactified spheres via gauge fields and scalar fields in their field contents . wrapped branes correspond to solutions with asymptotic ads space - time at boundary ( uv ) region .",
    "they usually have singularities at interior ( ir ) region . in some cases ,",
    "we encounter supersymmetric ads solutions at ir region . here",
    ", we have solutions interpolating two ads space - times with different dimensions .",
    "when we construct solutions for wrapped branes , we need to identify spin connections of metric on wrapped cycles with particular gauge fields in gauged supergravities in order to ensure supersymmetry for wrapped brane solutions .",
    "then , worldvolume theories on wrapped branes are twisted supersymmetric theories @xcite .",
    "it follows that supergravity solutions serve as dual gravity systems to low energy dynamics of worldvolume theories on wrapped branes .",
    "they give examples for less supersymmetric ads / cft correspondence .",
    "this construction in @xcite has been extended in various ways @xcite .    in early literatures , wrapped brane solutions have been constructed from various truncated gauged supergravities in each dimension . as for wrapped m5 branes @xcite ,",
    "it is systematic to handle possible wrapped branes at once within maximally supersymmetric gauged supergravity . here , we consider wrapped d3 branes .",
    "several wrapped d3 branes have been discussed in @xcite by using truncated five - dimensional gauged supergravities .",
    "we wish to derive possible wrapped d3 branes in a uniform manner .",
    "we write down the solutions by using maximally supersymmetric @xmath0 @xmath1 @xmath2 gauged supergravity .",
    "our present treatment includes wrapped d3 branes around special lagrangian three cycles inside calabi - yau threefolds , and holomorphic two cycles inside calabi - yau fourfolds .",
    "we find that the former has no ads solution at ir region , and the latter has ads solution when two cycles have negative curvature .",
    "then , we analyze their behaviors numerically with naive interpretations on dual worldvolume theories .",
    "we will also embed wrapped m2 branes @xcite into maximally supersymmetric @xmath3 @xmath1 @xmath4 gauged supergravity .",
    "these prescriptions should also give a starting point to discuss possible resolutions of ir singularities for wrapped branes .",
    "as a side remark , we will observe a universal form of bps equations for wrapped d3 , m2 and m5 branes .",
    "another wrapped branes arise from ns5 branes which give dilatonic backgrounds with less supersymmetry .",
    "several supergravity solutions have been constructed in @xcite .",

    "we will write down bps equations for all possible wrapped ns5 branes via @xmath5 @xmath6 @xmath7 gauged supergravity .",
    "we find that it is useful to derive these bps equations by reducing bps equations for wrapped m5 branes obtained from @xmath5 @xmath6 @xmath8 gauged supergravity .",
    "we pursue this procedure by borrowing a domain wall like reduction @xcite .",
    "this method is equivalent to a direct derivation from the @xmath7 supergravity .",
    "then , we concentrate on supersymmetric type iib ns5 branes wrapped around holomorphic @xmath9 inside calabi - yau threefold .",
    "we give their ten - dimensional solution which has a curvature singularity at ir region .",
    "the solution is related to a string world - sheet description of wrapped ns5 branes introduced by hori and kapustin @xcite .",
    "present derivation gives an explicit check of @xmath15 preserved supersymmetry of the wrapped ns5 brane solution .",
    "we also notice that the supergravity solution has a similar structure with that of ns5 branes wrapped around holomorphic @xmath10 inside @xmath11 surface .",
    "it is natural to study behaviors of wrapped branes without supersymmetry . here , we wish to consider non - supersymmetric solutions with ansatz which is the same as supersymmetric configurations .",
    "we start with second - order differential equations of motion obtained from lagrangian in gauged supergravities .",
    "we have no technology to find exact solutions for these differential equations . nevertheless , we are able to make an exact statement on solutions if we assume that solutions include ads space - times .",
    "we find such non - supersymmetric solutions for wrapped d4-d8 systems in massive iia supergravity by generalizing supersymmetric results @xcite .",
    "an interest on these solutions lies on a possible role as dual configurations for non - supersymmetric cfts realized on wrapped d4 branes .",
    "similar results have been obtained for wrapped m5 branes in @xcite .",
    "we have checked that similar solutions do not exist for wrapped d3 and m2 branes .",
    "there are a lot of directions to study further by using present wrapped brane solutions .",
    "an obvious direction is to consider penrose limit of supergravity solutions for various wrapped branes along recent discussions @xcite .",
    "a main interest here will be to understand a detailed structure on preserved supersymmetry found in various simple examples .",
    "we will return to address this analysis elsewhere .",
