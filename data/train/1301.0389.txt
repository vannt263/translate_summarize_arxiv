    "in addition to this adiabatic spin torque @xcite , a nonadiabatic spin torque plays a prominent role @xcite : this so - called `` @xmath0-term '' is due to spin relaxation , which causes the itinerant spin polarization to `` lag '' behind the local magnetization .",

    "the observed dw velocities of up to @xmath4 m / s ( and other interesting features , e.g. , dw motion against the current direction ) were attributed @xcite to a conspiracy of the @xmath0-term and a field - like adiabatic rashba spin torque @xcite , denoted @xmath5 below .",
    "while @xmath5 does not involve spin transfer and can be traced back to the electronic bandstructure , it depends on the current and can switch the magnetization .",
