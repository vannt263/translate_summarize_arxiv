    "clusters are a distinct state of matter which exhibit different structural ordering relative to bulk materials  @xcite .",
    "of particular relevance to , for example , many biological systems such as viruses , is their tendency to exhibit five - fold symmetry such as icosahedra and decahedra  @xcite .",
    "recently there has been a surge of interest in clusters formed in colloidal systems  @xcite , which is expected to lead to the development of ` colloidal molecules ' @xcite",
    ". these may in turn provide novel functionalised materials @xcite .",
    "part of the attraction of studying colloidal dispersions is that , although in principle they are rather complex multicomponent systems , the spatial and dynamic asymmetry between the colloidal particles ( 10 nm-1 @xmath7 m ) and smaller molecular and ionic species has led to schemes where the smaller components are formally integrated out @xcite .",
    "this leads to a one - component picture , where only the _ effective _ colloid - colloid interactions need be considered .",
    "this is usually a good approximation , however , there are a few exceptions . to describe the effective interactions between charged colloidal particles , the screening of the counter - ions is treated on a linear response level resulting in the well - known screened coulomb pair potential proposed by derjaguin , landau , verwey and overbeek ( dlvo ) . in general , however , due to non - linear counter - ion screening , the effective interactions involve many - body contributions @xcite , which violates the additivity of the potential .",
    "furthermore , in strongly driven systems hydrodynamic interactions ( velocity fields ) modify the electrostatic interaction significantly @xcite . here",
    "we assume the one - component description .",
    "the colloid behaviour in the original complex system may then be faithfully reproduced by appealing to liquid state theory  @xcite and computer simulation @xcite .",
    "since the shape of the particles is typically spherical , and the effective colloid - colloid interactions may be tuned , it is often possible to use models of simple liquids to accurately describe colloidal dispersions .",
    "for example this approach has made it possible to reproduce bernal spirals seen experimentally  @xcite in a system with competing short - ranged attractions and long - ranged repulsions , leading to the idea that colloidal gels can be stablised by repulsive interactions  @xcite .",
    "in addition to their own fascinating behaviour such as novel diffusion  @xcite colloidal clusters are also predicted from theory and simulation to exhibit hierarchical ordering such as lamellae @xcite , cluster crystals  @xcite and may also undergo dynamical arrest to form cluster glasses  @xcite .",
    "since colloids may be directly imaged at the single - particle level , one may consider local intra - cluster structure , along with cluster - cluster correlations , a level of detail seldom accessible to atomic and molecular systems , except in the low - temperature regime @xcite .",
    "meanwhile , the behaviour of colloidal clusters , for example the global energy minimum structure , should exhibit similarities to that of clusters of noble gas atoms as both colloids and noble gases can be well described by spherically symmetric attractive interactions  @xcite .",
    "some of us recently compared direct imaging of colloidal clusters with expectations from theory  @xcite . in the experiments ,",
    "a significant deviation from expectations was found , in particular a maximum yield of only around 10% in structures expected to minimise the potential energy for small @xmath8 clusters .",
    "this is surprising , as at these small sizes , there is little geometrical frustration that might inhibit access to the ground state , as would occur for larger clusters .",
    "it is the purpose of this work to establish those cluster structures we expect in the case of model colloidal systems by applying tried and tested model interactions",
    ". we shall consider weak electrostatic repulsions and a short - ranged attraction for similar parameters to the experimental system .",
    "typically , the former stems from electrostatic charge , the latter from the addition of non - adsorbing polymer or van der waals attractions , and drives clustering . rather than seeking minimum energy states  @xcite ,",
    "instead we shall try to mimic experimental approaches , as a way to predict what sort of yields of desired clusters we find as a function of interaction strength .",
    "experiments on colloidal systems typically start from a randomised initial state .",
    "unlike molecular systems , the effective temperature is typically constant : temperature itself is not usually varied and the effective colloid - colloid interactions in a given sample are taken to be fixed , as they depend upon sample composition . in other words the system undergoes an ` instantaneous quench ' from an initial , randomised state .",
    "we follow this protocol , although we note recent theoretical and simulation work highlighting the role of microscopic reversibility in optimising yields in self - assembling systems  @xcite which is beginning to be exploited in nanoscience @xcite . for the larger cluster sizes considered",
    ", we also investigate the role of electrostatic repulsions in cluster elongation , as suggested theoretically @xcite and noted experimentally @xcite .",
    "our approach is as follows .",
    "we shall consider clusters of @xmath9 particles and study the structures formed , with particular reference to the minimum energy states  @xcite , as a function of the attractive interaction strength ( which mimics the addition of polymer in experimental systems ) .",
    "various strengths of the repulsive interaction ( which models the electrostatic charge in experimental systems ) are also considered . for high strengths of the attractive interaction ( low effective temperature ) ,",
    "one expects the majority of clusters to reside in their minimum energy state .",
    "however , average bond lifetimes can exceed the simulation run time ( which is comparable to experimental timescales ) for sufficiently strong interactions .",
    "the system is thus nonergodic on these timescales , and kinetic trapping may become important . for larger clusters",
    ", long - ranged repulsions may lead to elongation @xcite .",
    "we investigate this effect for @xmath10 .",
    "our main result is that for small clusters ( @xmath3 ) the lack of geometric frustration enables the minimum energy state to be accessed , while for larger clusters kinetic trapping is important .",
    "this paper is organised as follows : section [ section : model ] introduces the model interactions , our simulation methodology is presented in section [ section : simulation ] , followed by results ( section [ section : results ] ) and a discussion in section [ section : discussion ] in which we place our findings in the context of recent work .",
    "we conclude our findings in section [ section : conclusions ] .",
    "the seminal theory of colloid - polymer mixtures is that of asakura and oosawa  @xcite .",
    "this ao model ascribes an effective pair interaction between two colloidal hard spheres in a solution of ideal polymers which is plotted in figure [ fig : u ] and reads ,    @xmath11    where @xmath12 , @xmath13 is the centre to centre separation of the two colloids and the polymer fugacity @xmath14 is equal to the number density @xmath15 of ideal polymers in a reservoir at the same chemical potential as the colloid - polymer mixture .",
    "thus within the ao model the effective temperature is inversely proportional to the polymer reservoir concentration .",

    "the ao model has been found to give good agreement with direct experimental measurement  @xcite .",
    "the discontinuous nature of the ao interaction at contact complicates its use in brownian dynamics simulations .",
    "we therefore use the continuous morse potential , which , for short interaction ranges , is very similar to the asakura - oosawa potential ( figure [ fig : u ] )  @xcite .",
    "the morse potential reads    @xmath19    where @xmath20 is a range parameter and @xmath21 is the potential well depth .",
    "the global energy minimum structures for clusters interacting via the morse interaction are known  @xcite , and for small clusters @xmath22 , the structure of the global energy minimum is not sensitive to the range of the interaction . with the exception of @xmath5 ( see below ) , small ground state clusters should be the same for an ao colloid - polymer system as those tabulated for the morse interaction .",
    "the experimental system  @xcite used a polymer - colloid size ratio of @xmath23 which maps to a morse range parameter @xmath24 for a well depth @xmath25 according to the extended law of corresponding states  @xcite .",
    "repulsions in colloidal systems typically stem from the electrostatic charge on the colloidal particles . under many conditions , where the charging is quite weak ,",
    "as is the case here , this leads to a screened coulomb , or yukawa form with a hard core that accounts for the physical size of the colloidal particles :    @xmath26    where @xmath27 is the inverse debye screening length .",
    "the contact potential is given by    @xmath28    where @xmath29 is the colloid charge and @xmath30 is the bjerrum length . to model the experimental system",
    ", we therefore fix the debye length to an experimentally relevant value @xmath31 , and consider different values of the contact potential @xmath32 . in the experimental system we seek to model , van der waals attractions are largely absent , due to solvent - colloid refractive index matching , the attractions are driven by the addition of non - absorbing polymer .",

    "is that increasing the attractive interaction strength @xmath35 leads to a higher population in the minimum energy ground state , here the ` 3a ' triangle with @xmath70 point group symmetry and three bonds .",

    "the average bond lifetime approaches , and then exceeds the simulation run time , so the system is unable to equilibrate , on the simulation ( and experimental @xcite ) timescale .",

    "why should this dzugutov cluster be more popular than 6a octahedra ? both clusters have 12 bonds ( near - neighours ) , and for a morse potential with a relatively short range as we use here , the energy contribution from second - nearest neighbours is a factor of @xmath86 of the total energy for the 6a ( it is essentially zero for the 6z ) .",

    "the contribution due to translation will be the same for both clusters , so need not be considered .",

    "in computing the entropy we must count each permutation of indistinguishable particles only once .",
    "for this reason , in computing the entropy , we are able to rotate the 6z cluster through a greater portion of the available phase space .",
    "this results in an increase in the 6z cluster s population relative to the 6a cluster s by a factor of @xmath88 .",

    "upon rotating the 6z cluster its particles traverse a greater portion of the available phase space than is the case for the 6a cluster .",
    "this increases the entropy of the 6z cluster , relative to that of the 6a , further favouring it .",
    "it seems plausible that this could account for the relative differences in the populations , i.e. , that the 6z is thermodynamically favoured over the 6a by a factor of 30 as shown in figure [ fig : m6](a ) .    as @xmath93 becomes very large",

    "the behaviour of the 7a system in the nonergodic regime highlights the sampling limitations of our simulation approach . to map this regime more accurately ,",
    "many more simulations are desirable than the @xmath101 runs per state point we have been able to perform .    at weaker interaction strengths , like the smaller clusters , a variety of structures become popular , based on a diminishing number of bonds .",
    "of these , sp5b+1 , a defective pentagonal bipyramid with 11 - 13 bonds shows a rather slow rate of decay upon increasing @xmath35 . at the weakest interaction strength , @xmath102 , the yield of 3@xmath955a exceeds that of 7a .",

    "the @xmath104 system ( figure [ fig : m10 - 13 ] ) features a clear maximum yield of 10b at @xmath105 , however the yield is only around 14% .",
    "the rise in the yield of 10b as a function of @xmath35 up to the ergodic - nonergodic crossover suggests that this rise in average bond lifetime is the primary mechanism by which a further rise in the 10b yield is suppressed . in other words ,",
    "kinetic trapping prevents access to 10b at higher strengths of the attractive interaction .    for @xmath51 , in addition to 13b",
    ", we also find crystal fragments .",
    "the maximum yield of 13b is around 10% . for @xmath106 ,",
    "hcp crystal fragments are in fact more popular than the 13b ground state .",
    "we find no icosahedra , these are the global energy minimum for longer ranged morse interactions ( @xmath107 ) @xcite than we use here , although for moderate values of @xmath35 it is not unreasonable to expect icosahedra .",
    "we expect that a similar kinetic argument to that suggested above for @xmath104 concerning the low yield of 10b holds for @xmath51 as well .",
    "for @xmath104 and @xmath51 we can not exclude the possibility that other global minima exist .",
    "doye _ et . al . _",
    "@xcite calculated global minima for @xmath108 .",
    "the smaller global energy minima for @xmath109 exhibit no strain for short - ranged morse interactions , and only a limited amount of strain in the case of 7a , these structures are therefore also expected to be minima for @xmath24 as used here .",
    "this not necessarily the case for @xmath104 and @xmath51 .",
    "we are however unaware of any more appropriate structures than those listed in @xcite .",
    "a question arises in comparing figure [ fig : m10 - 13 ] with results for smaller clusters , such as the case of @xmath68 ( figure [ fig : m3 ] ) . in general",
    "one expects that larger clusters should be able to form at higher temperatures ( weaker interaction strengths ) @xcite , ( although for small lennard - jones clusters , the melting line is in fact non - monotonic as a function of @xmath44 @xcite ) . here , we are interested in whether all @xmath44 particles in the simulation box aggregate to form a cluster .",
    "this is less likely for larger @xmath44 , so our statistics suffer for lower values of @xmath35 relative to the smaller clusters considered .",
    "it is nevertheless very clear that the yield of the assumed global minimum clusters is markedly reduced in the case of @xmath104 and @xmath51 relative to smaller clusters .",
    "we now proceed to consider elongation .       for the @xmath104 ( a ) and @xmath51 ( b ) system as a function of the well depth of the attractive interaction @xmath35 with @xmath61 .",
    "the dashed orange line denotes the elongation in the case of the minimum energy ground state .,width=529 ]    the ground states of larger clusters have been found to be strongly affected by the strength of a yukawa repulsion , with stronger repulsions leading to more elongated structures @xcite .",
    "this effective long - ranged repulsion was indeed predicted to have a profound effect upon both the shape and the size of clusters of charged colloids by groenewold and kegel @xcite , and experiments have found evidence for elongated clusters @xcite and bernal spirals @xcite .",
    "we therefore investigate the degree of elongation of the larger clusters considered here .",
    "we consider the largest separation of two coordinates within a cluster , @xmath110 , and divide this by the radius of gyration @xmath17 of the same coordinate set .",
    "thus , larger @xmath111 corresponds to more elongated clusters , and for a large spherical cluster with @xmath112 , @xmath113 . for highly symmetric clusters such as icosahedra , @xmath114 .",
    "figure [ fig : m10 - 13-elongation ] shows the elongation @xmath111 as a function of @xmath35 .",
    "the elongation for @xmath104 and @xmath51 appears to be dominated by failure to access the ground state ; nonergodic systems are more elongated . the data for @xmath115 are included in figure [ fig : m10 - 13-elongation ] , while for @xmath116 , few clusters formed at all , and none in the ergodic regime . from the discussion above",
    ", one might expect the @xmath117 data to show a higher degree of elongation due to the yukawa repulsion , however figure [ fig : m10 - 13-elongation](a ) indicates that this is not the case for @xmath104 and @xmath51 , except for a slight hint at the lower values of @xmath35 .",
    "we might expect that elongation induced by long - ranged repulsions is promoted by increasing @xmath44 , or @xmath32 or perhaps by a longer - ranged attraction that might suppress the transition to non - ergodicity , due to a less complex potential energy surface ( see section [ section : discussion ] ) @xcite .",
    "however in this system we see little evidence for elongation .",
    "the behaviour of the systems considered here can readily be decomposed into systems where frustration is not relevant , @xmath3 where a well - defined structure is favoured , and those where frustration leads to a non - trivial potential energy landscape and limited access to the ground state @xmath118 . in the case of @xmath5 two structures with the same number of bonds , 6a octahedra and 6z @xmath70 compete .",
    "of particular relevance here is the short range of the attractive interactions .",
    "it has been noted previously that these tend to promote a complex energy landscape , for example @xmath51 morse clusters with @xmath119 have some @xmath120 local energy minima , compared to just @xmath121 for the longer - ranged case of @xmath122  @xcite .",
    "the morse potential with @xmath119 is an approximation to @xmath123 , clusters of which are known to exhibit kinetic trapping @xcite , although in that case , icosahedral clusters were favoured . with @xmath24 , stronger",
    "trapping is likely .",
    "what is clear , therefore , is that these systems can , only in the simplest cases ( @xmath124 ) , form high yields of clusters in the minimum energy ground state , although @xmath4 does have a window in @xmath35 where the yield of 7a is rather substantial .",
    "this work has been largely motivated by experimental studies of clustering in colloidal dispersions . in those systems ,",
    "prized for their tunable interactions , the attractions , either asakura - oosawa , or van der waals are typically rather short ranged , and thus likely to exhibit kinetic trapping similar to the systems studied here .",
    "we therefore argue that for substantial yields of more complex ` colloidal molecules ' , it is appropriate to seek more sophisticated means than the spherically symmetric spheres we have considered here , such as patchy particles @xcite and janus particles @xcite , or to design routes of preparation @xcite . however , even ` purpose - designed ' patchy particles can have only a rather limited window where the yield of ground state structures is substantial  @xcite .",
    "we now compare our results to those found in an experimental system in which the interactions are , to a first approximation , identical  @xcite .",
    "each of the simulations was conducted with a fixed number of of particles corresponding to the cluster size investigated . by contrast , most experiments are carried out with a bulk colloidal suspension , in which clusters of different size form .",
    "the experimental data report the relative abundance of cluster types for a fixed number of particles per cluster , @xmath44 , and each cluster is assumed to interact only weakly with other clusters . in the experimental system , @xmath68 formed a majority of clusters in the 3a triangle which maximises the number of bonds .",
    "this occurred at interaction strengths comparable to those found in the simulations reported here . in the experiments @xmath75 and @xmath125 formed only around 10% of 4a tetrahedra and 5a triangular bipyramids respectively , in sharp contrast to the simulation results , where the yield was essentially 100% . in the case of @xmath5 , both in experiment and simulation , 6z @xmath6 dominated the 6a octahedron .",
    "however , in the simulation , in the ergodic regime , the population difference was around a factor of 30 , while in the experiment the difference was at least an order of magnitude larger .",
    "furthermore , the maximum yield of 6z @xmath6 was an order of magnitude lower in the experiment than the simulation , where it was around 100% . for @xmath4",
    "both experiment and simulation show signs of geometric frustration , with the yield of 7a being reduced in the nonergodic regime of strong interaction strength .",
    "however , while the peak yield of 7a approached 100% in the simulation , the experiments were limited to a few percent of 7a .",
    "we consider possible origins for this discrepancy in the following section .      before concluding , it is worth considering these results in the light of some other recent experimental studies .",
    "@xcite report clusters in a system in which they measured the colloid charge in a dilute suspension to be @xmath126 @xmath127 per 1.5 @xmath7 m diameter colloid , where @xmath127 is the elementary charge . according to eq .",
    "( [ eq : yuk ] ) , this maps to a yukawa contact potential @xmath128 , their quoted value for the debye length is comparable to ours .",
    "we have observed only very limited clustering at @xmath71 , corresponding to a charge of @xmath129 @xmath127 and expect none at higher yukawa contact potentials .",
    "dibble _ et .",
    "@xcite quote a similar value of @xmath130 @xmath127 per 2 @xmath7 m colloid .",
    "moreover sedgwick _ et .",
    "@xcite report @xmath131 @xmath127 in their study of clustering .",
    "although not strictly inconsistent , this seems rather higher than the values we predict from eq .",
    "( [ eq : yuk ] ) .    in their simulation study of gelation in colloidal systems with competing interactions , sciortino _ et .",
    "@xcite used a comparable contact potential for the yukawa repulsion @xmath32 to that used in the simulations here .",
    "in other words , a much weaker yukawa repulsion than that expected from the colloid charge quoted by campbell _ et .",
    "interestingly , sciortino _ et .",
    "_ @xcite found that similar bernal spiral structures were formed in their simulations to those observed experimentally @xcite . from the arguments presented above",
    ", it might be supposed that the bernal spiral can form without significant geometric frustration .",
    "an important question remains in the role of colloid concentration .",
    "we have considered a rather low volume fraction @xmath45 , as we are interested in isolated clusters .",
    "whether the details of our results apply at finite concentration where clusters interact with one another remains to be seen , but many colloid volume fractions quoted in the literature are @xmath132 . in this regime",
    "we expect the discussion above regarding clustering in the presence of electrostatic repulsions to be reasonable .    given the success of linear poisson - boltzmann theory in describing electrostatic interactions in these systems in the absence of polymer - induced attractions  @xcite , one is tempted to enquire as to the origin of the discrepancy between the findings of this paper and the experimental literature  @xcite . as far as we know , in only one case has quantitative agreement been found between experiment and simulation of competing interactions using conventional models of electrostatic repulsion and polymer - induced attraction  @xcite , and there the electrostatic repulsions were screened by salt . combined with the discrepancies presented here and those in the experimental system  @xcite to which we have tuned the interactions , we believe that there is more than meets the eye to these colloidal model systems with competing interactions .",
    "we see little reason to suppose that the polymer - induced attractions deviate substantially from theory @xcite , therefore we speculate that the electrostatic repulsions in the clusters may deviate from those deduced by electrophoretic mobility measurements in dilute suspensions @xcite .",
    "we have studied isolated colloidal clusters using brownian dynamics simulations .",
    "our system is tuned to match experimental work in colloidal systems with polymer - induced depletion attractions . for sufficient strengths of the attractive interaction , the average bond lifetime exceeds the simulation runtime , and the system as nonergodic on this timescale ; this conclusion also applies to some experimental systems .",
    "however , for small clusters @xmath3 this ergodicity breaking does not prevent the system reaching the minimum energy ground state structure , as no bonds need be broken . thus for these small clusters , we can direct the system in a controlled way towards a prescribed ground state .",
    "for @xmath5 we find a structure which appears to minimise the free energy with @xmath6 symmetry , rather than the octahedron that forms the minimum energy ground state  @xcite .",
    "the energy difference between these structures is negligible , and for moderate interaction strengths ( the ergodic regime ) the @xmath6 structure is favoured for entropic reasons , while in the nonergodic regime , it is kinetically favoured as it is the product of an aggregation sequence that does not involve bond breakage . at larger cluster sizes ,",
    "the system is kinetically frustrated from reaching the ground state in all but a limited window .",
    "moreover , recent experimental results in a similar system show much lower yields of clusters in the ground state than we find here @xcite .",
    "the origin of the discrepancy is likely related to a difference in the effective interaction potentials between experiment and simulation .",
    "it is perhaps surprising that such small systems exhibit this degree of kinetic trapping ; only those sizes for which there is no geometric frustration ( @xmath124 ) reach the minimum energy ground state .",
    "these results suggest that high yields of complex microstructures of colloidal clusters and molecules may benefit from reversible quenching  @xcite , rather than the fixed interactions of many colloidal systems , which lead to ` instantaneous quenching ' .",
    "some pointers for further work are considered .",
    "we have employed a simple approach in our simulations , as we are motivated to reproduce the recent experimental system .",
    "one approach to investigate larger clusters could be to run a simulation of a much larger number of particles , and to consider each cluster as a separate system . in this way",
    ", larger clusters could be accessed than was the case here .",
    "although this could in principle resolve some discrepancies between the results presented here and those reported for the experimental system , we believe this is a most unlikely scenario . other possibilities might be to implement the methods found in the ( atomic ) cluster literature @xcite to comprehensively determine the structure of larger clusters .",
    "another possibility would be to determine the phase diagram for the system considered here , using normal mode analysis to provide a theoretical prediction of the population levels for the various structures considered .    to provide further support to experimentalists in the quest to control the structure of colloidal clusters it might be helpful to move beyond the one - component description employed here .",
    "given that the charging number quoted in some experimental work is so small ( @xmath133 @xmath127)@xcite , it might be possible to determine structures of colloidal clusters by for example developing the primitive model of electrolyte systems to colloidal systems with many ionisable sites on each particle @xcite .",
