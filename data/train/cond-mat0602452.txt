    "in high - temperature cuprate superconductors ( hts ) the hole - doping concentration is the single most important physical parameter that dictates the cuprate physics .",
    "it has been a subject of extensive studies since the beginning of the hts era until today .",
    "it is also evident from the existence of the robust generic electronic properties @xmath9 hole - doping concentration phase diagram @xcite . in spite of its fundamental important role in studying hts , there is no consistent and simple method to determine hole - doping concentration for all hts .",
    "hts consist of one , two and more conductive @xmath10 @xmath11  layers sandwiched between blocks of insulating @xmath12",
    "@xmath13  layers generally referred as single- , double- and multi - layer hts , respectively .",
    "cation - doping and/or oxygen - doping within the charge reservoir introduce holes into the cuo@xmath0 plane . in general , the doped - holes are expressed as the _ hole content per cuo_@xmath0 _ plane _ ( @xmath1 ) .",
    "note that @xmath1 so defined is intrinsically a two - dimensional ( 2d ) quantity . in the cation",
    "doped hts , the @xmath1 can be directly determined from the doped cation content , such as @xmath1 = @xmath14 in the sr - doped la@xmath15sr@xmath16cuo@xmath17 ( srd - la214 ) . however , in the oxygen - doped ( od- ) or cation / oxygen co - doped ( cd- ) hts , it is highly non - trivial to determine @xmath1 . because , for la@xmath15sr@xmath16cuo@xmath18 , @xmath1 depends on the excess oxygen content ( @xmath19 ) , but the doping efficiency of oxygen atoms depends on the type of charge reservoir and/or @xmath1 @xcite .    superconducting transition temperature ( @xmath3 ) @xmath9 @xmath1 for the srd - la214 shows a dome - shaped curve with a maximum @xmath3 ( @xmath20 ) of @xmath21 37 k at @xmath1 @xmath21 0.16 .",
    "many other hts also exhibited the similar dome - shaped curve , although the @xmath20 depends on the hts materials .",
    "it was then conjectured that all hts follow a universal dome - shaped curve with @xmath20 at @xmath1 = 0.16 @xcite .",
    "subsequently , the hole concentration ( @xmath22 ) , considered to be identical to @xmath1 , was conveniently estimated by @xmath3(@xmath22)-scale using eq .",
    "( [ e.1 ] ) .",
    "@xmath23    most recently , based on the thermoelectric power at room temperature ( @xmath24 ) , a universal @xmath24(@xmath1)-scale ( hereafter @xmath1-scale ) is constructed as new scale that is different from the @xmath3(@xmath22)-scale ( hereafter @xmath22-scale ) @xcite .",
    "the distinct features of @xmath1-scale are : ( a. ) pseudogap temperatures become universal to all hts and depend only on @xmath1 , and ( b. ) @xmath20 is no longer universally pinned at @xmath1 = 0.16 , it depends on the specific material system of hts @xcite . therefore @xmath1 can be regarded as a carrier scale dictated by the pseudogap energy scale .",
    "in contrast the @xmath22-scale is based on the energy scale of @xmath20 .",
    "since pseudogap phase is the precursor of high-@xmath3 superconductivity , it seems to be plausible that @xmath1 is the proper carrier scale for both normal and superconducting properties of layered cuprates .",
    "if so , then we expect the @xmath1-scale should recover the experimentally observed dome - shaped @xmath3(@xmath22 ) curve . in this letter , we show that @xmath1 , with a straight forward extension of @xmath1 to an effective three - dimensional ( 3d ) hole concentration , can indeed describe the universal dome - shaped @xmath3(@xmath22 ) curve .",
    "we define a 3d hole concentration ( @xmath2 ) in terms of @xmath1 in eq .",
    "( [ e.2 ] ) .",
    "@xmath25    here , @xmath26 and @xmath27 are the unit cell volume and the number of cuo@xmath0 plane per unit cell , respectively .",
    "since @xmath2 is defined on the universal 2d @xmath1-scale , this definition has qualitatively taken into account the charge de - confinement effect of the holes in cuprates .",
    "therefore @xmath2 can be viewed as the @xmath28  3d hole - doping concentration even when holes are completely confined in @xmath10 @xmath29 .",
    "in this letter we make a clear distinction between @xmath1 , hole content per cuo@xmath0 plane , and the corresponding effective 3d hole - doping concentration ( @xmath2 ) defined in eq .",
    "( [ e.2 ] ) .",
    "we show that it is important to use the physically relevant hole - doping concentration in order to visualize the intrinsic and systematic doping behaviors of any physical property of hts .",
    "furthermore , we show that the @xmath30 @xmath9 @xmath2 exhibits a universal dome - shaped curve with the universal optimal hole - doping concentration @xmath5 = 1.6 @xmath6 10@xmath7 @xmath8 for single - layer hts .",
    "we find that the @xmath22-scale is identical to the @xmath2-scale and should be understood in the context of a normalized effective 3d carrier concentration . in this report",
