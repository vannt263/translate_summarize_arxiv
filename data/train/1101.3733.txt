    "thurston s geometrization conjecture for @xmath0-manifolds states that every closed orientable @xmath0-manifold has a canonical decomposition into geometric pieces . in the early 1980",
    "s thurston announced a proof of the conjecture for haken manifolds @xcite , with written proofs appearing much later @xcite .",
    "the conjecture was settled completely a few years ago by perelman in his spectacular work using hamilton s ricci flow @xcite .",
    "thurston also formulated a geometrization conjecture for orbifolds .",
    "we recall that orbifolds are similar to manifolds , except that they are locally modelled on quotients of the form @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is a finite subgroup of the orthogonal group .",
    "although the terminology is relatively recent , orbifolds have a long history in mathematics , going back to the classification of crystallographic groups and fuchsian groups . in this paper , using ricci flow , we will give a new proof of the geometrization conjecture for orbifolds :    [ theorem1.1 ] let @xmath3 be a closed connected orientable three - dimensional orbifold which does not contain any bad embedded @xmath4-dimensional suborbifolds .",
    "then @xmath3 has a geometric decomposition .",
    "the existing proof of theorem [ theorem1.1 ] is based on a canonical splitting of @xmath3 along spherical and euclidean @xmath4-dimensional suborbifolds , which is analogous to the prime and jsj decomposition of @xmath0-manifolds",
    ". this splitting reduces theorem [ theorem1.1 ] to two separate cases  when @xmath3 is a manifold , and when @xmath3 has a nonempty singular locus and satisfies an irreducibility condition .",
    "the first case is perelman s theorem for manifolds .",
    "thurston announced a proof of the latter case in @xcite and gave an outline .",
    "the first complete proofs of theorem [ theorem1.1 ] are due to boileau - leeb - porti @xcite and cooper - hodgson - kerckhoff @xcite .",
    "the monographs @xcite give excellent expositions of @xmath0-orbifolds and their geometrization .",
    "the main purpose of this paper is to provide a new proof of theorem [ theorem1.1 ] .",
    "our proof is an extension of perelman s proof of geometrization for @xmath0-manifolds to orbifolds , bypassing @xcite .",
    "the motivation for this alternate approach is twofold .",
    "first , anyone interested in the geometrization of general orbifolds as in theorem [ theorem1.1 ] will necessarily have to go through perelman s ricci flow proof in the manifold case , and also absorb foundational results about orbifolds .",
    "at that point , the additional effort required to deal with general orbifolds is relatively minor in comparison with the original proofs in @xcite .",
    "these latter proofs involve a number of ingredients , including thurston s geometrization of haken manifolds , the deformation and collapsing theory of hyperbolic cone manifolds , and some alexandrov space theory .",
    "also , in contrast to the existing proof of theorem [ theorem1.1 ] , the ricci flow argument gives a unified approach to geometrization for both manifolds and orbifolds .",
    "many of the steps in perelman s proof have evident orbifold generalizations , whereas some do not .",
    "it would be unwieldy to rewrite all the details of perelman s proof , on the level of @xcite , while making notational changes from manifolds to orbifolds .",
    "consequently , we focus on the steps in perelman s proof where an orbifold extension is not immediate . for a step where the orbifold extension is routine , we make the precise orbifold statement and indicate where the analogous manifold proof occurs in @xcite .",
    "in the course of proving theorem [ theorem1.1 ] , we needed to develop a number of foundational results about the geometry of orbifolds .",
    "some of these may be of independent interest , or of use for subsequent work in this area , such as the compactness theorem for riemannian orbifolds , critical point theory , and the soul theorem .",
    "let us mention one of the steps where the orbifold extension could _ a priori _ be an issue .",
    "this is where one characterizes the topology of the thin part of the large - time orbifold . to do this ,",
    "one first needs a sufficiently flexible proof in the manifold case .",
    "we provided such a proof in @xcite .",
    "the proof in @xcite uses some basic techniques from alexandrov geometry , combined with smoothness results in appropriate places .",
    "it provides a decomposition of the thin part into various pieces which together give an explicit realization of the thin part as a graph manifold . when combined with preliminary results that are proved in this paper",
    ", we can extend the techniques of @xcite to orbifolds .",
    "we get a decomposition of the thin part of the large - time orbifold into various pieces , similar to those in @xcite .",
    "we show that these pieces give an explicit realization of each component of the thin part as either a graph orbifold or one of a few exceptional cases .",
    "this is more involved to prove in the orbifold case than in the manifold case but the basic strategy is the same .",
    "the structure of this paper is as follows .",
    "one of our tasks is to provide a framework for the topology and riemannian geometry of orbifolds , so that results about ricci flow on manifolds extend as easily as possible to orbifolds . in section [ sect2 ]",
    "we recall the relevant notions that we need from orbifold topology .",
    "we then introduce riemannian orbifolds and prove the orbifold versions of some basic results from riemannian geometry , such as the de rham decomposition and critical point theory .",
    "section [ sect3 ] is concerned with noncompact nonnegatively curved orbifolds .",
    "we prove the orbifold version of the cheeger - gromoll soul theorem .",
    "we list the diffeomorphism types of noncompact nonnegatively curved orbifolds with dimension at most three .    in section [ sect4 ]",
    "we prove a compactness theorem for riemannian orbifolds .",
    "section [ sect5 ] contains some preliminary information about ricci flow on orbifolds , along with the classification of the diffeomorphism types of compact nonnegatively curved three - dimensional orbifolds .",
    "we also show how to extend perelman s no local collapsing theorem to orbifolds .",
    "section [ sect6 ] is devoted to @xmath5-solutions .",
    "starting in section [ sect7 ] , we specialize to three - dimensional orientable orbifolds with no bad @xmath4-dimensional suborbifolds .",
    "we show how to extend perelman s results in order to construct a ricci flow with surgery .    in section [ sect8 ]",
    "we show that the thick part of the large - time geometry approaches a finite - volume orbifold of constant negative curvature .",
    "section [ sect9 ] contains the topological characterization of the thin part of the large - time geometry .",
    "section [ sect10 ] concerns the incompressibility of hyperbolic cross - sections . rather than using minimal disk techniques",
    "as initiated by hamilton @xcite , we follow an approach introduced by perelman ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 8) that uses a monotonic quantity , as modified in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 93.4 ) .",
    "the appendix contains topological facts about graph orbifolds .",
    "we show that a `` weak '' graph orbifold has a connected sum decomposition in terms of `` strong '' graph orbifolds .",
    "this material is probably known to some experts but we were unable to find references in the literature , so we include complete proofs .    after writing this paper we learned that daniel faessler independently proved proposition 9.7 , which is the orbifold version of the collapsing theorem @xcite .",
