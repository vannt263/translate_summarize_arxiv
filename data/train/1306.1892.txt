    "the coefficient @xmath18 gives dispersion relation of a phonon .",

    "adds a term @xmath21 that is of higher order in fields which leads to spontaneous symmetry breaking @xcite .",

    "the total hamiltonian @xmath27 is invariant under the following transformations @xmath28 for any @xmath29 .    the configurations @xmath30 and @xmath31 that minimise energy of the system , break the @xmath0 symmetry to @xmath1 for a certain range of frequency @xmath32 .",

    "we choose only non - negative roots @xmath38 the factor @xmath6 was omitted here since it takes value 1 for non - trivial cases ( see next section ) .",
    "the solution behave quite differently when @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "namely , for the frequencies @xmath39 all three roots coincide and the potential has only one minimum @xmath41 that is invariant under the @xmath0 transformations .",
    "however , for @xmath40 the global minimum of the potential is provided by the family of solutions @xmath42 that is not invariant under @xmath0 and spontaneously breaks the symmetry to @xmath1 .    when @xmath43 the solution @xmath44 represents the local metastable minimum .",
    "indeed , two roots @xmath45 correspond to two extrema of the potential , one of which ( with the minus sign ) is a local maximum ( see fig.1 ) .",
    "this means that the pseudo - vacuum state @xmath46 is stable on the classical level , but becomes metastable if quantum effects are taken into account .",
    "this leads to quantum tunneling of the state @xmath47 to the true vacuum state given by @xmath48 and symmetry breaking .",
    "according to the goldstone theorem this leads to two massless modes @xmath49 , which we call transverse modes , one for each broken symmetry generator , and one massive mode @xmath50 , which we call longitudinal mode @xcite .",
    "hence , the longitudinal mode is the one that corresponds to the unbroken symmetry generator .",
    "excitations of the phonon field around the ground state @xmath51 can be written as @xmath52 for a particularly chosen vacuum @xmath53 we obtain the following hamiltonian : @xmath54 & = \\fr{1}{2}\\sum_{\\w_k<\\omega_{\\rm d}}\\p_k^\\alpha\\p_{-k}^\\alpha+\\sum_{\\w_k<\\omega_{\\rm d}}\\left[\\fr{\\w_k^2}{2}\\f^1_k\\f^1_{-k}\\right]+\\\\ & + \\sum_{\\omega_{\\rm f}<\\w_k<\\omega_{\\rm d}}\\left[\\fr{\\m\\w_k^2}{2}(\\f^2_k\\f^2_{-k}+\\f^3_k\\f^3_{-k})\\right]+\\\\ & + v_{int}[\\f^\\alpha_k]+v_0 . \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath55 are small excitations around the vacuum state and @xmath56 are corresponding canonical momenta .",
    "the term @xmath57 denotes all higher order interactions and includes all three modes @xmath55 while the last term is an irrelevant shift of the total energy of the system @xmath58 here the cutoff @xmath43 reflects the fact that for @xmath59 we have @xmath60 and the corresponding potential becomes zero .",
    "one should note that the frequency @xmath61 of the longitudinal mode @xmath62 defined as @xmath63 is non - continuous at the point @xmath64 and @xmath6 is again set to 1 .",
    "since the symmetry is broken and the system is in the true ground state @xmath65 the plus sign in should be chosen .    at the same time",
    ", the goldstone theorem asserts that the transverse modes @xmath66 and @xmath67 do not contribute to the energy of the system at the quadratic level for @xmath68 .",
    "the term @xmath57 that encodes interactions between all three modes involves all frequencies @xmath69 .",
    "the detailed analysis of the physical consequences of these facts is given in the next section .",
    "finally , it is worth mentioning that the direction of @xmath70 is chosen spontaneously and the form of the resulting hamiltonian does not depend on this choice .    identifying the field @xmath50 with longitudinal normal mode and the fields @xmath71 with transverse shear modes one can write energy of the theory defined by the hamiltonian as @xmath72 where @xmath73 is the total kinetic energy and @xmath74 and @xmath75 are the potential energies of longitudinal and shear modes , respectively , and @xmath76 corresponds to higher - order terms such as an anharmonicity .",
    "( [ frenk ] ) implies that contributions of transverse modes with frequencies @xmath77 to linearised energy vanish .",
    "this means , that we do not have free propagating transverse modes with such frequencies .    according to eq .",
    "( [ frenk ] ) , the system supports one longitudinal mode and two shear modes with frequency larger than @xmath78 .",
    "our theory therefore predicts a non - trivial and a non - anticipated effect of the frequency cutoff of shear modes .",
    "remarkably , such a cutoff was earlier discussed on purely dynamic grounds , a point to which we return below . here",
    ", we note that our symmetry breaking approach essentially captures the earlier dynamic idea @xcite .",
    "the most intriguing feature of the proposed formalism is albeit the energy can be interpreted as the energy of a liquid , in fact it describes all three phases of matter depending on the parameters @xmath79 and @xmath6 .",

    "_ the quartic coupling @xmath85 and the sextic coupling @xmath86 are set to be zero as well as the parameter @xmath6 .",

    "both longitudinal and transverse modes are non - interacting and massless which corresponds to the ideal gas .",
    "_ interacting gas_. the frenkel frequency @xmath87 becomes equal to the debye frequency @xmath5 which eliminates all transverse shear modes .",
    "however , in contrast to the case of the ideal gas the longitudinal mode @xmath50 is massive and has non - zero couplings .    _",
    "liquid_. transverse shear modes @xmath71 with frequencies",
    "@xmath43 do not contribute to the hamiltonian at the quadratic level while the longitudinal mode @xmath50 does not feel the bound @xmath64 since its couplings are continuous .",
    "notably , our eq .",
    "( [ frenk ] ) essentially captures the earlier idea of j. frenkel that as far as propagating modes are concerned , the only difference between a solid and a liquid is that the liquid does not support shear waves at all frequencies as the solid does , but only those with frequency @xmath88 @xcite . here , @xmath89 is liquid relaxation time , the average time between two consecutive atomic jumps in one point in space . with a remarkable physical insight , the argument about the liquid vibrational states",
    "was developed as follows . at times shorter than @xmath89 ,",
    "a liquid is a solid , and therefore supports one longitudinal mode and two transverse modes , whereas at times longer than @xmath89 , liquid flows and loses its ability to support shear stress , and therefore supports the longitudinal mode only as any elastic medium ( in a dense liquid , the wavelength of this mode extends to the shortest wavelength comparable to interatomic separations ) .",
    "derived on purely theoretical grounds , this idea was later experimentally confirmed , although with a significant time lag ( for review , see , e.g. ref .",
    "this implies that importantly , a liquid supports propagating shear modes with frequency @xmath90 .",
    "we therefore find that the ability of liquids to support high - frequency shear modes with @xmath87 as a lower frequency cutoff originates in our general approach based on symmetry breaking . this is an unexpected and a highly non - trivial result . for viscous liquids such as b@xmath91o@xmath92 ,",
    "the experimental evidence was available some time ago @xcite . for low - viscous liquids such as na and ga ,",
    "the experimental evidence came about fairly recently when powerful synchrotron radiation sources started to be deployed that mapped dispersion curves in these systems @xcite .",
    "it is reassuring and gratifying that our proposed general approach captures the experimental findings @xcite .    taking the inverse fourier transform of both sides of ( [ vacuum ] )",
    ", we find @xmath93 if we associate @xmath94 with oscillations around equilibrium positions and @xmath95 with translations , the symmetry breaking @xmath96 acquires a microscopic meaning in real space .",
    "namely , no symmetry breaking takes place in solids where atoms do not jump , giving @xmath97 . in liquids and gases , on the other hand , symmetry breaking is due to particle jumps , i.e. spontaneous translations with amplitudes @xmath95 .",
    "glass has been widely viewed as not a separate state of matter but as a slowly flowing liquid , with relaxation time @xmath89 exceeding observation time .",
    "when @xmath89 exceeds experimental time scale , the liquid forms glass @xcite .",
    "therefore , the glass state in our classification scheme originates when @xmath89 reaches a certain large value .    _",
    "solid_. all normal modes are supported and @xmath87 is equal to zero , reflecting the fact that solids are not able to flow .",
    "there is no described symmetry breaking in phonon interactions @xcite .",
    "the hamiltonian describes solid , liquid and gas states depending on the choice of coupling constants @xmath85 and @xmath86 , that in general may depend on wavenumber @xmath3 .",
    "the transverse shear modes @xmath71 for @xmath43 do not contribute to the hamiltonian on the quadratic level in the liquid regime .",
    "in the coordinate space it may correspond to atomic jumps with characteristic time @xmath98 .",
    "we now discuss two interesting directions for future work .",
    "identification of the physical meaning of the couplings @xmath85 and @xmath86 from the experiment is an important task .",
    "in general these constants may depend on the wavenumber @xmath3 and have to predict known experimental observables such as , for example , melting and boiling temperature .",
    "the form of the potential in particular can be justified by the following observation .",
    "the potential on figure 2.a in general describes continuous phase transitions .",
    "in contrast , the potential on figure 2.b @xcite , that was used in the suggested formalism , can be associated with discontinuous phase transitions such as melting ( or freezing ) .",
    "hence , an intriguing question is a dynamic description of the switch from the liquid to the solid phase regime by investigating the rg flow of the couplings @xmath85 and @xmath86 @xcite . the description of phase transitions ( solid / liquid , liquid / gas and solid / gas ) are another remaining challenging tasks .",
    "these ideas need more rigorous explanation and connection to the experiment .",
    "the proposed hamiltonian enables us to describe and predict energy spectra corresponding to other states of matter . to address this challenge one can operate in terms of couplings ( see table i ) .",
    "for instance , from the point of view of energy spectra , plasma does not support transverse modes in the sense of solid state , and therefore falls into the `` interacting gas '' state in our classification scheme .",
    "in summery , we have proposed a general form of phonon hamiltonian with non - trivial minima of potential energy that lead to symmetry breaking .",
