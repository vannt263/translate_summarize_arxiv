    "xte  j1550@xmath1564 is a transient galactic black hole . at the time of writing ,",
    "four outbursts  each separated by clear quiescent periods  have been observed from this source .",
    "radio observations during its 19981999 outburst revealed optically thick emission , with apparent superluminal motion ( v@xmath6 ) ( hannikainen et al .",
    "2000 ) . as a result ,",
    "was further classified as a `` microquasar . '' recently , orosz et al .",
    "( 2002 ) have constrained the mass of the black hole primary in this system through optical observations of the source in quiescence ( @xmath7 ) .    the accretion flow geometry of galactic black holes in outburst may change considerably with the mass accretion rate ( @xmath8 ) , which is often assumed to be traced directly by the soft x - ray luminosity ( see , however , homan et al .",
    ". in transient outbursts , the soft x - ray luminosity may suddenly rise , and decay over a period ranging between days and months ; from quiescence to the outburst peak , the luminosity may increase by a factor of @xmath9 or more . in all such systems ,",
    "periods of characteristic x - ray timing and spectral behaviors and correlated multi - wavelength properties are observed which are known as `` states '' ( for reviews , see tanaka & lewin 1995 , belloni 2001 , done 2002 ; for a critical discussion see homan et al .",
    "the existence of states likely indicates that only certain accretion modes and geometries are allowed in galactic black hole systems .    at luminosities below @xmath10 ,",
    "the geometry is particularly uncertain ; the accretion disk may be recessed to @xmath11 ( see , e.g. , esin , mcclintock , & narayan 1997 ; for a competing description see ross , fabian , & young 1999 ) .",
    "in contrast , near peak outburst luminosity  @xmath12  there is general agreement that the accretion disk may extend to the marginally stable circular orbit . in such cases ,",
    "the disk may serve as a probe of the general relativistic regime around the black hole .",
    "this regime can be explored through continuum spectroscopy ( e.g. , through the multi - colour disk blackbody model , mitsuda et al .",
    "1984 ) , studies of high frequency quasi - periodic oscillations ( qpos ) in the x - ray lightcurve ( possibly associated with the keplerian frequency at the marginally stable circular orbit ) , and through studies of fe  k@xmath4 line profiles and x - ray reflection spectra ( fabian et al .",

    "was quickly identified . the ensuing outburst lasted until june 1999 , and displayed some of the most remarkable behavior yet seen in an x - ray nova , e.g.  an initial flare which reached a flux level equivalent to 6.8  crab ( 1.512  kev , _",
    "rxte_/asm ) , very rapid state transitions , and strong ( 7% rms ) qpos at frequencies as high as 285  hz ( sobczak et al . 2000 , homan et al .",

    ", new source activity was noticed by the _ rxte _",
    "asm ( smith et al . 2000 ) .  was active in x - rays for nearly 70 days thereafter , and reached a peak flux of @xmath171 crab ( asm , 1.5 - 12  kev ) ; it was also seen out to 300  kev with batse aboard _ cgro _ , and simultaneously in optical bands ( masetti & soria 2000 , jain & bailyn 2000 ) .",
    "spectrally - inverted radio emission , likely from a compact jet , is detected in the low / hard state , as well as a possible discrete ejection event at the low / hard  intermediate state transition ( corbel et al .",

    "the lightcurve of the first outburst of  departed radically from a typical profile ( homan et al .",

    "( 2001a ) report simultaneous high - frequency qpos at 188  hz and 276  hz . these qpos appear in an approximate 2:3 ratio like the 300  hz and 450  hz qpos found in observations of gro  j1655@xmath140 ( strohmayer et al . 2001 ) . if these qpos are tied to the keplerian frequency at the marginally stable circular orbit , they provide evidence for black hole spin .",
    "tomsick et al . ( 2001a ) and kalemci et al . ( 2001 ) discuss the spectral and timing properties , respectively , of the declining phase of this outburst .",
    "on 28 january , 2001 , _ rxte _ found  to be in the low / hard state , with timing noise of 40% rms and a spectrum well - described by a power - law with @xmath18 ( tomsick et al .",

    "in all , we made seven observations of  with _ chandra _ ( 18 observations with _",
    "rxte _ ) . of these",
    ", here we report on the first two observations only ( see table 1 ) , when the source was brightest . of the remaining _ chandra _ observations , in two cases the hetgs failed to insert , and in two other cases the source intensity was too faint for our graded ,",
    "continuous - clocking observational mode to yield good spectra , but the source was clearly detected ( for a good discussion of continuous clocking mode , see marshall et al .",
    "imaging data from a final observation will be presented in separate work .",
    "the _ rxte _ data we report here were obtained through pointed observations of the proportional counter array ( pca ) , which consists of five individual proportional counter units ( pcus ) . due to",
    "gain uncertainties in pcu-0 following the loss of its propane layer , we exclude data from this detector . with this exception ,",
    "we include data from all layers of all active detectors ( see table 1 ; for observation r1 this includes pcus 2 , 3 , and 4 ; for observation r2 this includes pcus 1 , 2 , 3 , and 4 ) .",
    "the data was reduced using the lheasoft suite ( version 5.1 ) .",
    "we apply the standard `` goodtime '' and detector `` deadtime '' corrections .",
    "the background was calculated using the `` bright source '' model within lheasoft .",
    "response matrices were made using the tool `` pcarsp . ''    at the resolution of the pca , the spectrum of the crab nebula is known to be a simple power - law .",
    "we fit a spectrum from the crab obtained on 14 may 2000 ( as close to our observations as possible ) , with a power - law index for the pulsar component of 1.8 ( knight , 1982 ) and a column density of @xmath19 ( massaro et al , 2000 ) . below 3  kev ,",
    "residuals are very large , and so we fix 3  kev as our lower fitting bound .",
    "similarly , above 25  kev , residuals in fits to the crab are large , and our data from xte  j1550@xmath1564 becomes dominated by the background flux , so we adopt this energy as an upper fitting bound . as we wish to address the iron line region in xte  j1550@xmath1564 , we consider residuals as a function of energy in power - law fits to this crab observation .",
    "we find that with the addition of 0.4% systematic errors in the 38  kev band , and 0.8% systematic errors in the 825  kev band , the reduced @xmath20 fitting statistic drops to 1.0 ( similar results were obtained by tomsick et al .",
    "therefore , we add this energy - dependent systematic error to our pca data from xte  j1550@xmath1564 .      was observed with the _ chandra _ hetgs using the acis - s ccd array operating in continuous clocking ( cc ) mode . because  had flared to 6.8  crab ( 1.512  kev ) during its 1998 outburst , avoiding damage to the acis array was a paramount concern . to this end , we employed a large dither ( 20  amplitude ) to spread the most intense parts of the zeroth order over many pixels .",
    "furthermore , the zeroth order aim point was shifted toward the top of the chip via a sim - z translation of @xmath2110.0 mm from the nominal s3 aim point .",
    "a @xmath211.33 y - offset was used to place the iron k@xmath22 region of the heg  @xmath11 order on acis - s3 .",
    "finally , we blocked - out rows 367467 , eliminating any read - out of zeroth - order photons .",
    "this blocking acted to limit any telemetry saturation that would result from the zeroth - order counts .",
    "the cc mode was employed to limit pile - up of the dispersed spectrum and to achieve 3  msec time resolution .    as our observing mode is non - standard ,",
    "the data is not well - suited to reduction via the tools available in the ciao suite .",
    "we have managed to build robust , custom software to reduce and analyse our data .",
    "we first correct for bad aspect times ( e.g.  slewing , see table 1 ) .",
    "the events are then examined in projected chip - x space to correct for `` hot '' pixels which report erroneously large event numbers ( a list of bad pixels is available through ciao ) .",
    "acis - s4 sometimes produces `` streaks '' which appear in the acis chip image ( see http://asc.harvard.edu ) ; the events were removed using a 50 column median filter , rejecting deviations greater than 3@xmath23 .",
    "the spacecraft dither pattern is removed by calculating the mean chip - x position as a function of time , which is a sine wave .",
    "we are able to interpolate the dither - corrected chip x position of each event by removing this sine wave .",
    "with the dither removed , it is possible to calculate the wavelength corresponding to each chip - x value via the grating equation .",
    "a linear gain correction is performed on each of the four independent read - out and amplifier nodes on each acis - s chip .",
    "finally , we extract first - order meg and heg events and background regions , and apply the appropriate response matrices .    indeed , although we have blocked - out the zeroth - order photons , we are able to accurately locate the position of the zeroth - order , and therefore are able to convert accurately from chip x space to wavelength or energy space via the grating equation . to do this",
    ", we make use of the fact that the acis chips are silicon - based , and that silicon has an absorption edge at 1.8395  kev . for an assumed zeroth - order position ,",
    "then , we can examine the location of this edge in the heg @xmath211 and heg @xmath11 spectra ( which are on opposite sides of the zeroth - order position ) and iterate the assumed zeroth - order position until the edge is seen at the same energy in both ( see figure 2 ) .",
    "as per marshall et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , we perform an effective area correction , and add 5% systematic errors to the dispersed spectra . due to the fact that our _ chandra _ observations were offset towards the top of the acis - s array , less of the heg",
    "@xmath24 and meg  @xmath211 orders were read - out in comparison to the heg  @xmath25 and meg  @xmath11 orders . moreover , with the spacecraft dither , the portions of the heg  @xmath24 and meg  @xmath211 spectra dispersed far from the zeroth order were moved onto and off of the acis - s array .",
    "this is reflected in the spectra we obtained from the truncated orders , which show significant deviations from the shape expected based on the spectra obtained with _",
    "rxte_. therefore , we only consider the heg  @xmath211 and meg  @xmath11 spectra from our _ chandra _ observations .",
    "even after rebinning by a factor of 10 , flux bins below 0.65  kev in the meg  @xmath11 spectrum are consistent with zero .",
    "the heg  @xmath211 spectrum suffers from low effective area below 1.0  kev , displaying a flux trend inconsistent with the meg  @xmath11 spectrum .",
    "these energies serve as lower fitting bounds .",
    "we exclude data from regions near gaps in the acis - s ccd array . in the meg  @xmath11 spectrum",
    "we exclude the 0.74 - 0.80  kev band .",
    "there is another gap between 2.23.0  kev in this grating order , and at higher energies the effective area of the heg is higher .",
    "we therefore adopt 2  kev as an upper fitting bound for the meg  @xmath24 order .",
    "we exclude the 1.31.4  kev and 3.24.2  kev bands in the heg  @xmath211 spectrum , and set 10.0  kev as an upper fitting bound ( this is the effective upper energy limit of the heg ) .",
    "the reduced spectra were analyzed using xspec version 11.1.0 ( arnaud et al .",
    "all errors quoted in this paper reflect the difference between the best - fit value , and the value of the parameter at its 90% confidence limits .",
    "we fit the spectra from the _ chandra_/hetgs and the _ rxte_/pca spectra simultaneously ; spectra r1 and c1 are nearly simultaneous , and spectra r2 and c2 are simultaneous ( see table 1 ) .",
    "joint fits are desirable to characterize the continuum emission , as the range of the _ chandra_/hetgs is well - suited to measuring the soft spectral component expected from an accretion disk , and the _ rxte_/pca range is well - suited to contraining the hard power - law spectral component",
    ".    fits with a model consisting of interstellar absorption ( `` phabs '' in xspec ) , a multi - colour disk ( mcd ) blackbody component ( mitsuda et al.1984 ) , and a power - law component did not yield acceptable fits ( @xmath26 ) . fits with comptonization models such as `` comptt '' ( titarchuk 1994 ) and the `` bulk motion comptonization '' model ( shrader & titarchuk 1999 ) gave slightly worse fits .",
    "this is principally due to strong residuals in the fe  k@xmath22 region .",
    "we therefore add a broad gaussian line and smeared edge ( `` smedge '' within xspec ; ebisawa et al .",
    "this is the same model used by sobczak et al .",
    "( 2000 ) in fits to the 19981999 outburst of , and to be consistent with this prior work we fix the width of the edge to 7.0  kev , and the width ( fwhm ) of the line to 1.2  kev .",
    "the widths are poorly constrained when allowed to vary ( th 90% confidence error limits are approximately 50% of the assumed values ) .",
    "the addition of line plus edge combination consistent with neutral iron ( e@xmath27  kev , e@xmath28  kev ) does improve the fit considerably ( @xmath29 ) , but this is not an acceptable fit .",
    "when the gaussian and smeared edge energies are allowed to float , values consistent with helium - like fe  xxv ( e@xmath30  kev , e@xmath31  kev ) are preferred statistically .",
    "we fix these values in our final model , and acceptable fits are achieved : @xmath320.996 ( r1@xmath21c1 ) , @xmath321.017 ( r2@xmath21c2 ) . as a first test of",
    "whether or not the line is intrinsically narrow , we also made fits with a gaussian of zero width .",
    "the fit obtained is not statistically acceptable ( @xmath33 ) , suggesting that the observed line is not merely instrumentally broadened .",
    "we report the best - fit model parameters in table 2 ; the data and the best - fit model are shown in figure 3 .",
    "we measure an equivalent neutral hydrogen column density of n@xmath34 .",
    "relatively high inner disk colour temperatures are found with the mcd model ( kt@xmath35  kev and kt@xmath36  kev , respectively ) .",
    "we measure power - law indices of @xmath37 and @xmath38 , respectively .",
    "the unabsorbed fluxes measured via our model are listed in table 3 ; in the energy range we consider the disk flux is approximately 60% of the total .",
    "these spectral results are consistent with the  being in the intermediate state at the time of our observations ( this is confirmed by x - ray timing results , see miller et al .",
    "the broad fe  k@xmath4 emission line is relatively strong and highly significant ; we measure equivalent widths of @xmath39  ev and @xmath40  ev , respectively .",
    "we measure the optical depth of the smeared edge to be @xmath41 and @xmath42 , respectively .    for a known source distance and inclination",
    ", the mcd model gives a measure of the inner disk radius via the model normalization .",
    "assuming the mean values for the black hole mass ( @xmath43 ) , system inclination ( @xmath44 ) , and distance ( @xmath45  kpc ) reported by orosz et al .",
    "( 2002 ) , we measure inner disk radii of @xmath46  km and @xmath47  km ( corresponding to @xmath48 and @xmath49 , respectively ) . as these values are within the marginally stable circular orbit ( @xmath50 ) for a non - spinning ( schwarzschild ) black hole , they may imply a black hole with significant angular momentum in xte  j1550@xmath1564 .      to further examine whether or not a single emission line might merely be smeared by the pca response to produce the broad fe  k@xmath4 line required in joint fits , we calculated the 95% confidence upper - limits on the strength of single - bin emission lines in the _ chandra_/hetgs spectra ( see figure 4 ) . due to auger destruction ,",
    "intermediate fe ion species are not likely to be observed ; relatively few narrow fe  k@xmath4 lines ( e.g. , fe  i , xxv , xxvi at 6.40 , 6.68 , and 6.97  kev , respectively ) are expected .",
    "it is clear that the upper - limits on line features at these energies are a fraction of the @xmath51  ev equivalent width of the broad lines required in joint fits .",
    "the spectra we obtained are of too coarse a sensitivity to detect narrow emission or absorption features like those found in the high / soft state of xte  j1650@xmath1500 ( miller et al . 2002b ) .",
    "we have analyzed spectra from two nearly - simultaneous _ chandra_/hetgs and _ rxte _ observations of the galactic microquasar xte  j1550@xmath1564 .",
    "we jointly fit the 0.6525.0  kev spectra with a continuum model consisting of two components : a multi - colour disk blackbody ( likely from an accretion disk ) and a power - law ( likely from a corona ) .",
    "this simple model described the data better than comptonization models .",
    "the data strongly require the addition of a broad gaussian emission line and smeared edge features consistent with fe  xxv ( see section 3 and table 2 ) .",
    "this model may be regarded as an approximation to a full reflection model in the 0.6525.0  kev band .",
    "the multi - colour disk blackbody model yields a measure of the inner accretion disk edge .",
    "our fits give inner disk radii of @xmath52 and @xmath53 , which suggests that xte  j1550@xmath1564 may harbor a spinning black hole .",
    "if the shimura & takahara ( 1995 ) colour correction is applied ( @xmath54 , @xmath55 for stellar - mass black holes ) black hole spin is not required .",
    "however , this correction may be overly simplifed .",
    "merloni , fabian , & ross ( 2000 ) have detailed more systematic difficulties with the inner disk estimates of this model , but suggest that the mcd model may give acceptable inner disk measures at high @xmath8 .",
    "the 284  hz qpo found in the 19981999 outburst of this source ( homan et al . 1999 , 2001 ) and the 276  hz qpo found in this outburst ( miller et al .",
    "2001a ) also suggest a spinning black hole .",
    "broad fe  k@xmath4 emission line studies may provide another means of diagnosing the accretion flow geometry and black hole spin , as these lines are plausibly produced by irradiation of the inner disk ( fabian et al .",
    "we find that lines with widths of 1.2  kev ( fwhm ) adequately describe our data .",
    "intrinsically narrow lines ( with widths fixed at zero , as per a line with a fwhm less than the _ rxte_/pca resolution ) give significantly worse fit results .",
    "moreover , the _ chandra_/hetgs spectra confirm that the line is not likely due to an intrinsically narrow line which is smeared by the resolution of the _ rxte_/pca ( see section 3 and figure 4 ) .",
    "the sensitivity achieved with our _ chandra_/hetgs snapshot observations is not sufficient to constrain the parameters of more sophisticated line models which can estimate the inner disk extent more directly ( and thereby black hole spin , e.g. miller et al .",
    "the 1.2  kev ( fwhm ) width we adopt in fits with a gaussian model is not broad enough to require black hole spin , but it does suggest significant doppler shifting .",
    "compton broadening may also contribute to the observed line width .",
    "our best - fit spectral model is the same as that adopted by sobczak et al .",
    "( 2000 ) in fits to _ rxte _ spectra from the 19981999 outburst .",
    "the parameters we measure are broadly consistent with those reported previously when xte  j1550@xmath1564 was found to be in the very high or intermediate states .",
    "the properties of these states are quite similar , and they are only distinguished by relative luminosity ( if multiple such states are observed , the most luminous may be called the `` very high '' state , and the others `` intermediate '' states ) . the fe  k@xmath4 emisson line",
    "equivalent widths we measure ( @xmath56  ev ) are consistent with the strongest lines reported by sobczak et al .",
    "we speculate that the sensitivity and energy range of the _ chandra_/hetgs spectra have allowed for a better characterization of the continuum spectrum , and therefore a better characterization of the line parameters as well .    at present , few very high and intermediate states have been observed relative to the more common high / soft and low / hard states .",
    "the spectra we have observed are similar to other very high and/or intermediate states observed in the _ rxte _ and _ bepposax _ era , including : xte  j1650@xmath1500 , gro  j1655@xmath140 , grs  1739@xmath1278 , xte  j1748@xmath1288 , and xte  j2012@xmath21381 ( miller et al .",
