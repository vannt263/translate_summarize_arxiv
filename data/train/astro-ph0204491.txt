    "pre - main sequence stars of intermediate mass ( @xmath4 ) which show emission lines in their spectra are called herbig ae / be ( haebe ) stars .",
    "they were first discussed as a group by herbig ( 1960 ) .",
    "he identified 26 stars which are of spectral type a or b , located in obscured starforming regions and illuminating a bright nebulosity in its immediate vicinity . additions to the original list were made by finkenzeller & mundt ( 1984 ) and herbig & bell ( 1988 ) .",
    "recently , a more extended catalogue of haebe stars and related objects was published by th et al .",
    "( 1994 ) . in this catalogue",
    "287 haebe stars and related objects are listed in five tables , which include stars with later spectral type ( g0 or earlier ) and those found relatively isolated from star forming clouds . out of this",
    ", only 109 stars which are listed in table 1 of the catalogue , are recognized as either haebe stars or potential candidate members .",
    "other stars listed in the catalogue are either of very uncertain or unknown spectral type or have not been identified to belong to any specific group .    the following set of properties are often taken as a working definition of haebe stars ( waters & waelkens 1998 ) .",
    "_ ( a ) spectral type b or a with emission lines .",
    "( b ) infrared excess due to hot or cool circumstellar dust or both .",
    "( c ) luminosity class iii to v_. the emission lines are believed to be formed in a stellar wind originating from a hot and extended chromosphere around the star ( bouret & catala 1998 ) , and is closely connected with the accretion related disc activity . the near and far infrared excesses which characterize the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of these stars is attributed to the presence of significant amounts of circumstellar dust around them with a wide range in temperature ( e.g. hillenbrand et al .",
    "submillimeter and millimeter observations have clearly established the existence of dust .",
    "dust masses estimated from these studies range from @xmath5 to @xmath6 ( waters & waelkens 1998 and references therein ) .",
    "scattering of central star light by the circumstellar dust manifests in large values of intrinsic polarization measured for haebe stars ( e.g. grinin 1994 ) .",
    "however , the geometry of the circumstellar environment of haebe stars is still a matter of debate .",
    "evidence for the presence of discs as well as envelopes has been found .",
    "recently natta et al .",
    "( 2001 ) have argued that irradiated discs with a puffed - up inner wall of optically thick dust provide a good fit to the observations over the entire range of wavelengths .",
    "though the pre - main sequence ( pms ) nature of the haebe stars is now well established , several questions concerning their pms evolution remain to be answered .",
    "do all pms stars of intermediate mass go through the herbig ae / be phase ? what happens to the attendant circumstellar material around a haebe star by the time it evolves into a main sequence star ?",
    "there have been suggestions in literature that haebe stars evolve into vega - like stars ( eg .",
    "malfait et al .",
    "1998 , waters & waelkens 1998 ) .",
    "vega - like stars are characterized by substantial far infrared excess due to cool dust , relatively low near infrared excess , low polarization and lack of emission lines in their spectra .",
    "the dust masses found around them are a few orders of magnitudes lower than that of haebes . also , vega - like discs in general are gas depleted ( lagrange et al .",
    "do all haebe stars pass through a vega - like phase with gas depleted discs ?",
    "these questions are critical to our understanding of the nature of the pre - main sequence evolution of intermediate mass stars .    a study of non - emission line young stellar candidate objects listed in table 5 of the catalogue by th et al .",
    "( 1994 ) may shed some light on the issues raised above .",
    "there are fourteen stars listed in this table .",
    "typical pms properties are less clearly seen in these stars .",
    "one of them , @xmath7 pic , is a bonafide vega - like star .",
    "the evolutionary status of other stars is not very clear .",
    "they are believed to be , as the authors suggest , transition objects between pms and ms phase .    in this paper",
    "we present the results of a study of four non - emission line stars listed in the afore - mentioned catalogue .",
    "spectroscopic and polarimetric observations of these stars were carried out . in section 2 of this paper",
    "we present our observations . together with the information available from literature in different wavelength ranges , we discuss the structure of circumstellar environment and the evolutionary status of these stars in section 3 .",
    "summary of our study is presented in section 4 .",
    ".log of spectroscopic observations [ cols=\"<,<,^ \" , ]     in any case these stars fit well with the definition of vega - like stars though the far infrared excesses , fractional infrared luminosities @xmath1 , and the dust masses computed for hd 36982 and hd 36917 are much higher than that for the prototype vega - like stars and for `` old pms '' ( opms ) and `` young main sequence '' ( yms ) systems discussed recently by lagrange et al .",
    "their circumstellar dust may not be the debris product but rather what is left over from their pms phase .",
    "these stars , then , are the youngest vega - like stars hitherto known",
    ".    unlike the stars which are members of the orion nebula cluster , hd 58647 may not be a young star .",
    "this object is about 30 degree away from the orion complex and is not associated with any star forming cloud . though it shows an excess at the near infrared wavelengths , it s far infrared excess is small .",
    "@xmath8 indicates the scarcity of dust present around the star .",
    "low polarization observed reinforces this fact .",
    "colour temperature derived from the iras fluxes is very high and is much larger than the dust sublimation temperature .",
    "the dust mass estimated formally from iras fluxes is negligibly low and is unphysical as the colour temperature does not represent the dust temperature .",
    "clearly , the excess shown by the star in the iras wavelengths can not be attributed to circumstellar dust .",
    "the infrared excess , both near and far , most likely is due to free - free emission from an ionized region around the star .",
    "we suggest that hd 58647 is a classical be star .",
    "the relatively large value of @xmath9 @xmath10 supports this claim .",
    "the presence of @xmath11 line in emission observed in the spectra is consistent with the star being a classical be .",
    "moreover , its iras flux density distribution varies nearly as @xmath12 @xmath13 @xmath14 which is very similar to that for classical be stars ( taylor 1990 ) .",
    "a colour - absolute magnitude diagram constructed for all the four programme stars is shown in figure 5 .",
    "the zero - age main sequence data is taken from schmidt - kaler ( 1965 ) .",
    "for the onc member stars a distance of @xmath15 @xmath16 is assumed and a _ hipparcos _ distance of @xmath17 @xmath16 is used for hd 58647 in computing the absolute magnitude .",
    "major contribution to the error bars shown in the figure results from uncertainities in distance .",
    "further , the average interstellar value of 3.1 is used for the ratio @xmath18 .",
    "significance of their position in the colour - magnitude diagram ( cmd ) is discussed below .",
    "hd 36917 which is a spectroscopic binary ( b9.5 + a0.5 ) ( lavato & abt 1976 ) is found to be way above the main sequence in the colour - magnitude diagram .",
    "increase in the brightness caused by binarity would only account for @xmath19 .",
    "thus it s location in the colour - magnitude diagram is consistent with the star being a pre - main sequence and the age indicated by its kinematic association with the onc .",
    "the other two stars which are members of the onc , _ viz_. , hd 36982 and hd 37062 fall below the zero - age main sequence ( in particular hd 36982 ) in the cmd .",
    "a possible explanation for their anomalous position is that they have an anomalous circumstellar extinction component .",
    "if they have already reached the zero age main sequence then the extinction towards hd 36982 and hd 37062 , implied by their location in the cmd and computed from the observed and absolute v magnitudes for a distance of @xmath15 @xmath16 are @xmath20 @xmath21 and @xmath22 @xmath21 respectively .",
    "such large extinction and a rather low @xmath23 can not be produced by interstellar grains of submicron size .",
    "this would imply the presence of large grains around these stars .",
    "the neutral extinction produced by these grains can be even larger than that estimated assuming the stars to be zero age main sequence stars , without causing any change in the colour excess .",
    "the possiblity of these stars being intrinsically brighter than a zams star of similar spectral type can not be ruled out .",
    "they could be pre - main sequence stars with very high extinction .",
    "we have obtained optical spectra of four non - emission line stars listed in the catalogue by th et al .",
    "emission lines which characterize the typical haebe spectrum are not seen in any of the stars .",
    "also , their near infrared properties are very unlike haebe stars .",
    "the amount of circumstellar dust present is also systematically lower than that found around haebe stars .",
    "we argue that these stars can not be unambigu    ously classified as haebe stars .",
    "nevertheless , three of the stars which are kinematic members of orion nebula cluster are very young .",
    "this association constrains their ages to be less than a few @xmath24 .",
    "absence of emission lines , low near infrared excesses and presence of far infrared excesses in these objects make them somewhat similar to vega - like stars though the dust masses estimated for them are much higher than that of prototype vega - like stars . these stars",
    "may then represent the youngest examples of vega phenomenon and may well be the intermediate mass counter parts of weak line t tauri stars .",
    "the observed reddening and estimated extinction for these stars indicate presence of larger than submicron sized dust grains around these stars .",
    "one of the stars in our sample , hd 58647 , is more likely to be a classical be star as evident from the low @xmath8 , scarcity of circumstellar dust , low polarization , presence of @xmath11 emission and appreciable near infrared excess and far ir spectral energy distribution consistent with free - free emission similar to other well known classical be stars .",
