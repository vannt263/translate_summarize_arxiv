    "many exciting developments of entanglement sources are involved in atomic systems such as entanglement via atom - cavity coupling @xcite , atom - atom entanglement via cavity @xcite , entanglement in trapped ions / atoms @xcite , atomic entanglement in an optical lattice by controlled collision @xcite and also atomic entanglement via external fields @xcite .",

    "effect of such vacuum induced coherence ( vic ) on the collective resonance fluorescence is discussed in @xcite .",
    "sge is particularly interesting from the application point of view because : practical quantum devices are _ often unavoidably coupled _ to the environmental bath and hence sge can occur naturally .    .",

    "study of multilevel systems are important because in certain situations , participation of additional internal atomic levels in the process of generating entanglement or causing disentanglement is unavoidable .",
    "for example , when two atoms , having a triplet @xmath0-state as their excited anil or ground @xcite state , are placed in close proximity , i.e. , the interatomic distance is less than the wavelength of the atomic transitions involved , @xmath1 , even the dipoles involving the orthogonal @xmath2 transitions can radiatively couple to generate additional coherences .",
    "recently , keitel and coworkers @xcite have explicitly shown that the two - level approximation fails in such a situation .",
    "furthermore , multilevel systems can open up new channels in bath assisted sge in a vary natural way and even can give more control parameters @xcite . to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "only a few studies addresses entanglement in three - level atoms interacting with a continuum via the radiative coupling @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we investigate the steady state sge between two _ radiatively coupled and incoherently pumped atoms _ having their energy levels in a v configuration with non - degenerate excited states ; see fig .",

    "it is shown that at @xmath127 , there is no entanglement because initially the atomic system is in the state @xmath52 .",
    "for @xmath128 the entanglement evolves to reach its maximum value , and then undergoes a process of disentanglement . finally , steady state of negativity becomes identically zero .",
    "but the relaxation time becomes longer when the atoms are nearer ( seen solid line in fig .",

    "4 ) . from the solution eq.(11 ) , we know that relaxation time of re ( @xmath129 is determined by @xmath130 which means larger the value of @xmath131 , longer the relaxation time for disentanglement .",
    "this is the competition between _ dd _ coupling and the all - direction spontaneous emission .",
    "the evolution of sge presented here can be understood as due to the following multiple radiative exchange processes : spontaneous emission of atom a via @xmath132 ( atom b via @xmath133 ) transition is followed by an absorption of the spontaneously emitted radiation by atom b via @xmath134 ( atom a via @xmath135 ) , as it is expressed by @xmath136 ( @xmath137 ) causing the two - atom entanglement .",
    "from the previous section , we have seen that the disadvantage of sge is the temporal evolution and the quickly diminishing of sge due to the decays in the system .",
    "however , for any useful application , for example , to use the two - atom system as a coupled qubit , sustaining the generated sge is essential . in order to achieve a steady state entanglement",
    ", we introduce an incoherent pump to continually repump population to the excited states .",
    "steady state entanglement using a classical coherent pumping is discussed in @xcite where the coherent pumping with single frequency drive the atoms .",
    "coherent field assisted entanglement is rather intutive . on the contrary , the usual notion associated with an incoherent pumping with a decoherence process and hence a source of disentanglement .",

    "hence we have a total of 13 non - vanishing density matrix elements in presence of @xmath149 .",

    "we have scaled the incoherent pumping rate @xmath149 with the spontaneous decay rate @xmath103 and also for simplicity we have assumed @xmath158 .",
    "clearly , a non - zero steady state entanglement is obtained by incoherently repumping the excited state .",
    "smaller the interatomic distance , larger is the steady state entanglement .",
    "further , as the incoherent pumping rate is increased , the sge increases but after reaching a certain optimal value at around @xmath159 , the atomic entanglement starts to reduce . for smaller the interatomic distances ,",
    "even stronger incoherent pumping can be used to get entangled atoms . without any incoherent pumping the steady state sge",
    "is identically zero .",
    "physically , the increase in entanglement with the incoherent pumping can be understood as follows : the spontaneous emission in either of the two atoms followed by exchange of photon between them generates sge .",
    "but that does not survive longer because the spontaneously emitted photon can escape in any arbitrary direction .",
    "once both atoms loose their excitation , sge vanishes .",
    "an incoherent pump assists the atoms to bring back to the desirable excitation so that more spontaneous emissions and hence photon exchanges can take place between the two atoms .",
    "thus , increasing the repumping via incoherent pumping helps increasing the sge .",
    "however , incoherent repumping also competes with the photon exchange process to re - excite the atoms . while an excitation due to the photon - exchange process enhances the entanglement ,",
    "an excitation by incoherent process has no direct contribution to the entanglement .",

    "we have shown that both the magnitude of entanglement and the survival period of sge are enhanced by reducing the interatomic distance . from our analytical calculations ,",
    "we have shown the strong dependence of the sge on the radiative coupling parameters .",
    "we have explicitly demonstrated that the multilevel atoms are preferable compared to their two - level counterparts for sge , because each channel adds to enhance the magnitude of the entanglement . in the long time limit , however , sge vanishes .",
    "further , to reinforce the above short term evolution of sge in the radiatively - coupled two - atom system , we have proposed to use an incoherent pump that assists in repumping the deexcited atoms and sustain the sge .",
    "we have demonstrated that for a certain range of incoherent pumping , the steady state value of sge increases as it prevents atoms from loosing their excited state population .",
    "however , since incoherent pumping competes with the two - atom photon exchange process to reexcite the atoms , a stronger incoherent pumping is shown to be undesirable .",
    "we have shown that an appropriate rate of incoherent pump can help producing optimal sge .    the above entanglement can further increase ( not discussed here ) if one considers atoms having degenerate or near degenerate excited states in their excited state that has additional coherences @xcite , which will be discussed elsewhere .",

    "<S> we study spontaneously generated entanglement ( sge ) between two identical multilevel atoms in free space via vacuum - induced radiative coupling . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the sge in two - atom systems may initially increase with time but eventually vanishes in the time scale determined by the excited state lifetime and radiative coupling strength between the two atoms . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate that a steady - state sge can be established by incoherently pumping the excited states of the two - atom system . </S>",
    "<S> we have shown that an appropriate rate of incoherent pump can help producing optimal sge . </S>",
    "<S> the multilevel systems offer us more chanel to establish entanglement . </S>",
    "<S> the system under consideration could be realized in a tight trap or atoms / ions doped in a solid substrate . </S>"
