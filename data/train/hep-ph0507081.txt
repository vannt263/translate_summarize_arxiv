    "a motivation for physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) in the electroweak ( ew ) sector lies in the vast difference between the planck ( or unification ) and the ew scale ( hierarchy problem ) , that requires some stabilization of light scalar masses ( fine tuning problem ) .",
    "in contrast to the supersymmetric solution to that problem where the quadratic sensitivity of the scalar masses to the cut - off is cancelled above the susy breaking scale between partners of opposite statistics , models have been constructed that contain a spontaneously broken global symmetry with the higgs being light because it is one of the goldstone bosons appearing in this breaking . in the simplest variant",
    "this construction fails because the scale for new strong interactions is too close to the electroweak scale , leaving traces in the low - energy effective action which would have shown up at lep and tevatron .",
    "there are two ways to evade these complications , either to use non - simple global groups ( deconstruction models ) or to entangle the global with the local symmetry breaking to forbid one - loop contributions to the higgs mass parameters @xcite .",
    "this shifts the scale where new strong dynamics naturally appears by one order of magnitude upwards .",
    "if the higgs is among the goldstone bosons of a broken global symmetry group , one always has a reduction of the rank of the global group .",
    "the higgs thereby corresponds to a broken non - diagonal generator like the kaon in chiral symmetry breaking .",
    "in most little higgs models there is a diagonal generator in the global symmetry breaking which corresponds to an ( anomalous ) unbroken global @xmath0 subgroup .",
    "the boson that parameterizes this subgroup is analogous to the @xmath1 in chiral symmetry breaking , i.e. it couples like a pseudoscalar to fermions .",
    "hence , its properties resemble those of an axion - like particle , so we call it the _ pseudo - axion _ of little higgs models @xcite . in order to lift the bounds ( mainly from astrophysics ) on axions , we have to assume that the @xmath0 symmetry is explicitly broken and the relation between the mass of the axion and its ( loop - induced ) coupling to photons is shifted .",
    "this is plausible , since the yukawa interactions of the non - linear extended higgs - axion multiplet representation break the anomalous @xmath0 anyway .    in some cases",
    ", these additional ( pseudo-)scalar degrees of freedom have been absorbed as longitudinal modes of heavy neutral vector bosons ( @xmath2 ) , which are quite easy to detect either at lhc or at ilc .",
    "we consider the case where the additional group remains ungauged ( and can therefore be anomalous ) , so that the pseudoscalar is part of the physical spectrum .    particles analogous to the little higgs pseudo - axion exist in other models of ewsb like technicolor , topcolor and the nmssm ( for an overview and a list of references , cf .",
    "we focus on the influence of this particle on the ew observables and on the phenomenology of the heavy quark states present in little higgs models .",
    "generically , the @xmath3 is an ew singlet which parameterizes the anomalous @xmath0 subgroup as @xmath4 $ ] , where @xmath5 is the vacuum expectation value of the global symmetry breaking , assumed to be of the order of @xmath6 tev .",
    "if it were an exact goldstone boson , there would be no potential for the @xmath3 , so it would be exactly massless .",
    "this is ruled out by the non - existence of long - range forces .",
    "as already mentioned the fermion couplings ( yukawa interactions ) break the global symmetry explicitly , generating a potential and a mass for the @xmath3 , so that the astrophysical axion bounds are evaded . in order not to reintroduce a hierarchy problem",
    ", power - counting demands a mass @xmath7 .",
    "all couplings of the @xmath3 to sm particles appear only via ewsb and mixing effects and are therefore @xmath8 suppressed .",
    "the dominant decays of the @xmath3 are to the heaviest sm fermions ( tops , bottoms , and taus ) , as well as to gluons and photons via the triangle anomaly . in a model with a heavy @xmath9 singlet @xmath10 quark ,",
    "the chiral structure of the @xmath3 couplings is @xcite ,    cc    @xmath11 & @xmath12    where @xmath13 are the left-(right-)handed projectors , respectively .",
    "in @xcite , we investigate several different realizations of the little higgs mechanism : the littlest higgs , the simple - group model and the @xmath14 model @xcite . in all of these models",
    "the @xmath3 particle has the gross properties mentioned above .",
    "let us concentrate here on the @xmath14 model , where the embedding of the @xmath0 and the quantum numbers of the particles are manifest , and the predictability is much better than in the other models .",
    "the model is a `` moose''-like model , where a @xmath14 term like in the mssm breaks the global symmetry explicitly and triggers ewsb .",
    "the ew gauge group is enlarged to @xmath15 while the global symmetry breaking is @xmath16 .",
    "there are two non - linear sigma model fields , @xmath17 ( 0,0,f_1)$ ] and @xmath18 ( 0,0,f_2)$ ] , with @xmath19 being the matrix @xmath20 introducing the parameter @xmath21 the scalar potential can be written as @xmath22 where @xmath23 and @xmath24 are the one - loop contributions from the coleman - weinberg potential . the mass of the pseudo - axion is then given by @xmath25 , while the @xmath3 and the higgs masses are connected by the relation @xmath26 . from this",
    "one can read off that @xmath27 in order to avoid fine - tuning .",
    "but @xmath14 anyhow is restricted to lie within several gev and nearly 400 gev , where the upper bound comes from the ewsb constraint , the lower bound is due to the lep higgs exclusion limit . the higgs mass varies between 140 and 800 gev , depending on the ratio of the two vevs , @xmath28 .",
    "this ratio plays a role similar to @xmath29 in the mssm .",
    "@xmath30 varies between several gev and roughly 400 gev , rising linearly with @xmath14 .    to simplify phenomenology",
    ", we assume that there is no mixing between the sm and heavy fermions for the first two generations , and that the heavy top mass takes its minimal value .",
    "then the only free parameters are @xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath14 with the following bounds : @xmath33 tev from ew precision observables and bounds on contact interactions , @xmath34 , @xmath35 from fermion mixing and the universality of fermion couplings . in ref .",
    "@xcite , a so called `` golden point '' is defined for which all constraints are fulfilled : @xmath36 tev , @xmath37 tev , @xmath38 tev , @xmath39 tev , @xmath40 tev , @xmath41 tev . @xmath42 and @xmath43 are the other heavy quarks ( for more details see @xcite ) , and @xmath44 are the additional heavy vector bosons .",
    "the pseudo - axion @xmath3 resembles the pseudoscalar @xmath45 in a two - higgs doublet model ( 2hdm ) for small     in the @xmath14 model .",
    "[ fig : branch ] ]    @xmath46 .",
    "the branching ratios of the @xmath3 for the golden point are given in fig .",
    "[ fig : branch ] .",
    "concerning the higgs phenomenology , there are new decays @xmath47 , which can amount to @xmath48 br for a light @xmath3 , while @xmath49 is negligible , but can reach @xmath50 in the extended simple group model .",
    "here we discuss the capability of the ilc and the photon collider to detect such a pseudoscalar particle . since the largest coupling to sm     at the ilc .",
    "[ fig : ilc],title=\"fig : \" ]   at the ilc .",
    "[ fig : ilc],title=\"fig : \" ]    particles is the @xmath51 coupling , the most promising channel is associated production with a @xmath52 pair and the subsequent decay of the pseudo - axion into a @xmath53 pair .",
    "[ fig : ilc ] ( left ) shows the cross section for the associated production depending on the coupling ratio @xmath54 and the mass of the @xmath3 .",
    "the right plot shows the @xmath53 invariant mass spectrum at an @xmath55 gev ilc with high luminosity ; the light area is the qcd background , while the dark area is the ew background , the @xmath56 and a 115 gev higgs , respectively .",
    "the sharp spikes at @xmath57 , @xmath58 and @xmath59 gev are possible signals from the @xmath3 resonance .",
    "so , except for the case that the @xmath3 lies too close to the @xmath56 or higgs resonance , it is clearly visible at the ilc .",
    "while for higher @xmath3 masses the cross section goes down , also the background fades away so that for higher masses the signal - to - background ratio should be even better .    in the @xmath14 model  in contrast to the littlest higgs model  there is a coupling @xmath60 , which is @xmath8 suppressed , but enhanced by a @xmath29 effect .",
    "therefore it is possible to study the process @xmath61 in analogy to @xmath45 production in the 2hdm @xcite .    at a photon collider which is a precision machine dedicated to higgs",
    "cross sections .",
    "[ fig : gge ] ]    physics , scalar and pseudoscalar particles can be studied as @xmath62 channel resonances coupled to two photons by their anomaly couplings .",
    "the signal / background ratio is similar to the linear collider , with the signal cross section going down with increasing pseudoscalar mass , while the background also vanishes for higher energies .",
    "[ fig : gge ] shows the effective production cross section for the pseudo - axion in little higgs models in comparison to the sm higgs production cross section . for higher masses ( over 300 gev ) , the cross sections for",
    "the pseudoscalar reach the same order of magnitude as for the sm higgs , and can be even larger since for the @xmath3 there is no destructive interference with gauge boson loops .",
    "the cross section depends crucially on the number of particles running in the loop . from bottom to top , the curves correspond to one heavy top quark ( as in the littlest higgs ) , one complete heavy generation , three generations of heavy quarks , and three complete heavy generations ( as in the simple - group model ) , respectively .",
    "the spike in the cross section comes from the interference of the heavy particle loops with the top loop which is important since the @xmath3 couples     signal at the 200 and 500 gev photon collider .",
    "[ fig : ggcoll],title=\"fig : \" ]   signal at the 200 and 500 gev photon collider .",
    "[ fig : ggcoll],title=\"fig : \" ]    with order one to the sm top .",
    "the collider phenomenology of the @xmath3 at the golden point ( @xmath63 gev ) is almost identical to the mssm pseudoscalar higgs @xmath45 , as investigated in @xcite . for the coupling of the @xmath3 to @xmath53 we took @xmath64 . the partial width @xmath65 rises with increasing @xmath30 from @xmath66 kev for @xmath67 gev to @xmath68 kev for @xmath69 gev , where the last value has been chosen to be just below the threshold for @xmath70 decay , and to stay in the area of a dominant @xmath53 final state .",
    "[ fig : ggcoll ] shows the @xmath53 invariant mass spectra for a photon collider running at 200 and 500 gev , respectively .",
    "the plots have been made using the programs in @xcite .",
    "standard cuts have been applied , and a @xmath71 tagging efficiency of @xmath72 has been taken into account . the signal of a @xmath73 gev sm higgs has been shown for comparison .",
    "one can see that over a wide range of @xmath3 masses a discovery at the photon collider is possible . to optimize the search ,",
    "the energy of the linear collider can be tuned once a significant deviation from the sm spectrum has been seen @xcite ; for conservative reasons , this was not done here . for more details , see @xcite .",
    "little higgs models are an elegant alternative to supersymmetry to solve ( part of ) the hierarchy problem and provide a consistent framework for ewsb .",
    "if there are ( approximate ) @xmath74 symmetries in the model , this gives rise to new ew singlet pseudoscalars , called pseudo - axions of little higgs models . in some models ,",
    "these particles are absorbed as longitudinal modes of heavy @xmath2 states , which would generally be easy to detect at future colliders .",
    "if these particles are in the physical spectrum , they would be difficult to detect , but alter the phenomenology of the higgs and the new heavy quark states present in this class of models .",
    "an explicit breaking of the @xmath0 symmetry by yukawa and gauge interactions circumvents the axion limits from astrophysics . at the lhc",
    "the pseudoscalar could be detected in gluon fusion as a signal in the diphoton spectrum , if it is heavy enough . for smaller @xmath3 masses",
    "the linear and photon colliders would be well - suited to detect such a state , where the linear collider could specially cover the low @xmath3 mass range , and would give a spectacular opportunity ( in some of the models ) via the @xmath61 process .",
    "the photon collider could search for the pseudo - axion over a wide range of masses , enabling a measurement complementary to the linear collider and also to possibly give access to branching ratios of the @xmath3 .",
