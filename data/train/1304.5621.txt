    "string theory is expected to be the fundamental theory which unifies elementary particle physics and quantum gravity .",
    "its compactification provides four - dimensional string theories and their low energy effective theories , in which required properties such as gravity and gauge interactions , as well as chiral matter can be realized . however , further properties of these effective theories depend on the geometry of the internal extra dimensions",
    ".    one of the promising compactification methods is the orbifold construction @xcite of hetetoric string theory @xcite . in this framework , we quantize closed strings on a six - dimensional toroidal orbifold in the internal dimensions .",
    "model building towards supersymmetric standard models and some gut - like extended models are vastly investigated in @xmath7 and @xmath8 orbifold compactification @xcite ( for a review @xcite ) . since heterotic string theory has a microscopic description by a lagrangian , it is possible to investigate phenomenological properties of the four - dimensional effective theory , such as the yukawa couplings and higher order couplings , by considering selection rules of string interactions and explicitly computing string amplitudes @xcite .",
    "we can consider an extension of the orbifolding procedure without losing string consistency : in the asymmetric orbifold construction @xcite , orbifold actions for the left and right - movers on the string world - sheet are generalized to be independent .",
    "the generalization will expand the scope of realistic model building in heterotic string vacua . in the literature",
    "@xcite , @xmath0 asymmetric orbifold models with one wilson line were studied .",
    "in addition , gut models with higher kac - moody levels were constructed @xcite . however , systematic searches for realistic models , e.g. supersymmetric standard models , have not been done for asymmetric orbifold vacua .",
    "such systematic studies are quite important in @xmath0 asymmetric orbifold model building as well as for e.g. @xmath9 or @xmath10 orbifolds .    in this paper",
    ", we study the @xmath0 asymmetric orbifold compactification systematically . a starting point for model building",
    "is a narain compacification , i.e. a lorentzian even self - dual lattice , with ( 22,6 ) dimensions @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , there are infinitely many possible narain lattices .",
    "but if one restricts to a certain class of @xmath0 actions , the number of lattices compatible with the action is finite .",
    "yet , it is difficult to cover all possibilities by a blind search .",
    "however , all euclidean even self - dual lattices in 8 , 16 and 24 dimensions are classified . from these one",
    "can construct lorentzian even self - dual lattices by using the lattice engineering technique @xcite .",
    "for example in @xcite , the lattice engineering technique is applied in a gut model construction . in the right - mover part of the narain lattice",
    "we require either the @xmath11 or the @xmath12 lattice in order to realize the @xmath0 automorphism @xcite .",
    "the @xmath13 lattice can also realize the @xmath0 twist by using the outer automorphism of @xmath14 .",
    "thus , we classify the ( 22,6)-dimensional lorentzian even self - dual lattices with an @xmath11 or @xmath12 right - mover lattice , which can be constructed using the 8 , 16 and 24 dimensional euclidean lattices through the lattice engineering technique .",
    "we also give a comment on ( 22,6)-dimensional lorentzian even self - dual lattices containing a @xmath14 right - mover lattice .",
    "this allows us to fix possible narain lattices including gauge symmetries .",
    "then , we can break gauge symmetries by embedding the @xmath0 orbifold twist into the gauge space . in symmetric orbifold models , gauge symmetries after such breaking are classified by studying all breaking patterns of the @xmath15 root lattice through @xmath7 shifts @xcite . in our case ,",
    "the narain lattices used as starting point include root lattices of several simple lie groups possibly shifted by fundamental weights .",
    "thus , the analysis of breaking patterns becomes more involved , but we can classify all possible gauge groups after such @xmath0 shift breaking . our procedure for classification and model building can be extended to other @xmath7 and @xmath8 asymmetric orbifold models .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section 2 ,",
    "we construct ( 22,6)-dimensional narain lattices which include an @xmath11 or @xmath12 right - moving lattice from 24-dimensional euclidean lattices through the lattice engineering technique .",
    "these can be used for the @xmath0 asymmetric orbifold construction . in section 3 ,",
    "we consider gauge symmetry breaking patterns caused by orbifold actions .",
    "we also show the construction of a ( 22,6)-dimensional narain lattice in a more detailed manner in section 4 , together with a simple @xmath0 asymmetric orbifold model . in section 5",
    "we present ( 22,6)-dimensional narain lattices that have a right - moving @xmath13 group factor and comment on their gauge breaking patterns .",
    "section 6 is devoted to conclusions and discussion .",
    "in this work we consider the heterotic string in its bosonic construction @xcite compactified to four dimensions on an asymmetric toroidal orbifold . in the light - cone formalism",
    ", the original world - sheet cft contains 24 bosonic left - movers @xmath16 , eight bosonic right - movers @xmath17 and eight right - moving fermions @xmath18 . the asymmetric orbifolding procedure @xcite consists of the following steps :    toroidal compactification . : :    the most general toroidal compactification is obtained by specifying    periodic boundary conditions for @xmath16 and    @xmath17 , except for the extended dimensions we keep .",
    "these boundary conditions are encoded in a    @xmath19-dimensional lorentzian lattice    @xmath20 which represents the quantized momenta    @xmath21 . in this context",
    "@xmath20 is called a narain lattice @xcite and modular    invariance requires it to be even and self - dual .",
    "this toroidal theory    possesses @xmath22 susy in four dimensions and has    a gauge symmetry @xmath23 of rank @xmath24    which is determined by the left - mover part of the narain lattice .",
    "henceforth , @xmath16 , @xmath17 and    @xmath18 shall denote only the compactified    directions .",
    "asymmetric twisting / shifting .",
    ": :    next , a twist @xmath25    in combination with a shift @xmath26    is applied to the toroidally compactified directions , acting as    follows : @xmath27    the shift vector @xmath28 is only defined modulo a lattice    vector . here ,",
    "@xmath29 and @xmath18    are twisted in the same manner in order to retain world - sheet    supersymmetry .",
    "furthermore , ( @xmath30,@xmath28 ) is    chosen such that the above action generates the cyclic group    @xmath31 .",
    "for consistency , @xmath30 must    be a lattice automorphism , i.e. it has to conserve the scalar product    defined on @xmath20 . the orbifold action given by eqn .",
    "is    called symmetric if @xmath32 can be written as    @xmath33 for some twist    @xmath34 . in our case",
    "we explicitly consider twists    which are asymmetric , i.e. do not obey this requirement .      1 .   in order to obtain phenomenologically viable models we only consider twists which retain @xmath35 space - time susy .",
    "this is achieved when all eigenvalues @xmath36 of @xmath37 fulfill @xmath38 @xcite . also , as an implication @xmath39 can be set zero .",
    "the left - movers are not twisted but only shifted , i.e. @xmath40 .",
    "this shifting breaks the gauge group @xmath23 of the toroidal theory to a subgroup @xmath41 of the same rank .",
    "3 .   for simplicity , we restrict to @xmath42 asymmetric orbifolds .      1",
    ".   a suitable ( 22,6)-dimensional narain lattice @xmath20 .",
    "an automorphism @xmath30 of @xmath20 of order 3 that acts as the identity on the 22-dimensional left - mover part , i.e. only twists the right - movers . 3 .   a shift vector @xmath28 that is zero in the right - mover direction and fulfills @xmath43 .",
    "in the following , a narain lattice @xmath20 is described by left - right combined momenta @xmath44 with the lorentzian metric , namely , @xmath45 .",
    "modular invariance of the closed string theory restricts the momentum lattice to be even and self - dual . if we denote the narain lattice as @xmath46 by using a basis @xmath47 and integers @xmath48 , the even and self - dual conditions are given by @xmath49 for all @xmath48 and @xmath50 with @xmath51 . here",
    "@xmath52 satisfies @xmath53 and the @xmath54 are integers .",
    "also , @xmath20 can be described by a suitable combination of root lattices and their fundamental weights , the conjugacy classes . for a simple example",
    ", the @xmath15 even self - dual lattice which has only left - moving degrees of freedom is described by the momenta @xmath55 with simple roots @xmath56 and integers @xmath48 . in terms of conjugacy classes , @xmath57 is written as @xmath58 .",
    "also , the @xmath59 lattice is given by the 16-dimensional momenta @xmath60 , where @xmath61 with simple roots @xmath62 , and with the fifteenth fundamental weight @xmath63 which corresponds to the spin representation ( see figure [ fig : dynkin ] for the definition of the dynkin diagram ) . in terms of conjugacy classes , @xmath64 is written as @xmath65 .",
    "as seen in the previous subsection , the starting point for an asymmetric orbifold construction is a @xmath19-dimensional narain lattice @xmath20 possessing a suitable discrete symmetry @xmath30 . for the purpose of classifying such lattices , the lattice engineering technique @xcite is useful . by this method",
    "we can construct new lattices from known ones .",
    "the lattice engineering procedure allows us to replace one of the left - moving group factors in the narain lattice , say @xmath66 , by some dual group factor @xmath67 in the right - movers , and vice versa . here",
    ", we denote a right - moving factor by using the bar sign . the dual group factor",

    "for example , the 8-dimensional even self - dual lattice @xmath57 has @xmath72 .",
    "the lattice @xmath71 is described by conjugacy classes of @xmath70 , and , by a suitable decomposition , also in terms of conjugacy classes of @xmath73 .",
    "the left - right replacement gives rise to a new lattice with different dimensions .",
    "if we start from a modular invariant lattice , the resulting lattice is also modular invariant since the two group factors @xmath66 and @xmath67 have the same modular transformation properties due to their conjugacy classes .",
    "we show a simple example of the lattice engineering technique .",
    "let us denote the @xmath15 even self - dual lattice in terms of @xmath74 .",
    "this leads to the decomposition @xmath75 where @xmath76 and @xmath77 denote the conjugacy classes corresponding to the fundamental and the anti - fundamental weights of @xmath11 and @xmath78 , respectively . from this , we find that @xmath11 and @xmath78 are dual to each other . here , let us consider the lattice engineering @xmath79 . we replace each conjugacy class of @xmath78 as @xmath80 , @xmath81 and @xmath82 .",
    "the resulting lattice is a narain lattice in ( 6,6 ) dimensions that we call @xmath83 .",
    "it contains the conjugacy classes @xmath84 these conjugacy classes are generated by @xmath85 .",
    "this lattice gives rise to an @xmath11 gauge symmetry from the left - moving @xmath11 root lattice . in this way",
    "@xmath86-dimensional @xmath87 lattices with @xmath88 can be constructed .",
    "we will use this technique iteratively to construct ( 22,6)-dimensional lattices .",

    "the conjugacy classes for the left - movers and the right - movers are denoted as @xmath89 and @xmath90 .",
    "we also list normalizations for @xmath91s .",
