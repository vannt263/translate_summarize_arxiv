    "entity information network model having been proposed , it is widely used in social network analyzing@xcite , image association and other fields @xcite . depending on the diversity of the relationships and entities , entity information network model can be divided into two categories : based on simple structure and based on complex one .    generally , only one kind of entity relationship is contained in simple structure based model , such as item - to - item , object - to - item or object - to - object relationships .",
    "in recent years , many modeling methods on item - to - item information network are proposed . in refs @xcite ,",
    "the similarity between media sources is evaluated by mapping different types of medium s features to a common space based on media contextual clues .",
    "zhu et al .",
    "@xcite proposed an information network model to correlate tweets , emotion features and users based on emotion analysis .",
    "matrix transformation , matrix decomposition and random walk methods are used to construct object - to - item information network @xcite . and some researches focus on the status of users in the resource , such as influence , importance and opinion leaders , by constructing the authoritative network based on specific topics @xcite .",
    "some modeling methods are also widely concentrated on object - to - object relationships such as user - to - user . based on direct and indirect users relationships ,",
    "the similarity between users can be measured by the comments on social media resource and those on user reviews @xcite . besides , matrix decomposition can also be used to evaluate the similarity between users in social media combining with lda @xcite .",

    "in which , there are multi - class of relationships between entities .",
    "in addition , the entities are also multi - dimension and multi - scale .",
    "thus , they are generally called heterogeneous information network models @xcite .    although heterogeneous information network models are widely studied in complex systems , such as academic resource search @xcite , citations recommendation @xcite , user based personalized service @xcite , traveling plan search and recommendation @xcite , and makeup recommendation @xcite . there are seldom researches about equipment - standard system .    as we know",
    ", equipment - standard system is a multi - layer , multi - dimension and multi - scale complex system . for this reason",
    ", we present a heterogeneous information network model for equipment - standard system ( hinm - ess ) in this paper .",
    "hinm - ess contains three types of nodes that present different granularity of entities in equipment - standard system and six types of entity relationships .",
    "a complete hinm - ess can provide strong support for equipment - standard system , such as resource searching , production designing , standard revising and controlling .",
    "two real data sets are used in experiments to verify the validity of hinm - ess .",
    "the one is a real equipment - standard system data set that contains 2600 standard documents and 24 elements .",
    "the other is a mixed test data set that contains different size of data from multiple fields .",
    "the experiments show that our methods in modeling process are efficient and accurate .",
    "comparing with word mover s distance ( wmd ) @xcite , the relational modeling between documents using our method can save 50% time and the performance of precision reduces about 20% .",
    "that is , we can establish hinm - ess efficiently , and reflect relationship between entities in equipment - standard system accurately .",
    "the formal expression of hinm - ess is described as hinm - ess=@xmath0 .",
    "in which , @xmath1 is the network node set with three different granularity of entities , i.e. , @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "@xmath2 represents the standard document ; @xmath3 represents the clause in standard document ; @xmath4 represents the unit such as equipment , module or element .",
    "@xmath5 is the network edge set with six different kinds of relationships between entities , where @xmath6 represents the @xmath7 relationships , @xmath8 represents the @xmath9 relationships , @xmath10 represents the @xmath11 relationships , @xmath12 represents the @xmath13 relationships , @xmath14 represents the @xmath15 relationships , and @xmath16 represents the @xmath17 relationships .",
    "each edge has its weight to measure the degree of correlation or the similarity between entities .    as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , to construct the hinm - ess , six kinds of entity relationships are confirmed in turn by evaluating the similarities or correlations between entities .",
    "first of all , weights of @xmath6 are evaluated to confirm the @xmath7 relationships , as shown in fig . [ fig1](a ) .",
    "secondly , a @xmath2 is divided into several items to confirm @xmath9 relationships @xmath8 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1](b ) . and then @xmath13 relationships @xmath12 and @xmath17 relationships @xmath16 are confirmed by the same strategy used in the first step , as shown in fig . [ fig1](c ) .",
    "thirdly , the @xmath15 relationships @xmath14 can be confirmed since @xmath13 and @xmath17 relationships have been confirmed , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1](d ) , and @xmath11 relationships @xmath10 can be confirmed in virtue of @xmath6 and @xmath16 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1](e ) .",
    "finally , hinm - ess can be obtained , as shown in fig . [ fig1](f ) . because these six relationships involve different entities , the method to measure the weights of edges are very different .",
    "the details will be described in following subsections .",
    "+      the @xmath7 relational modeling is the first and the most important step to establish the hinm - ess .",
    "as the contents of @xmath18 are text , the correlation between @xmath18 can be confirmed via text similarity so as to establish the connection between two @xmath2 nodes in hinm - ess .",
    "since the contents of @xmath19 and @xmath20 are text as well , only @xmath7 relational modeling is described in details , the @xmath13 and @xmath17 relational modeling is similar with @xmath7 .",
    "text analyzing is one of the most popular research topics .",
    "there are many researches focus on measuring text similarity , such as lda @xcite and word2vec @xcite .",
    "these models translate text contents to different abstract features to improve the measuring performance . in this paper",
    ", we choose word mover s distance ( wmd ) @xcite method to measure the similarity between @xmath18 .",
    "wmd provides accurate similarity measurement by combining the word embedding with the earth mover s distance ( emd ) . in wmd ,",
    "word2vec provides embedding matrix @xmath21 for a finite size vocabulary of @xmath22 words .",
    "the @xmath23 column , @xmath24 , represents the embedding of the @xmath23 word in @xmath25 dimensional space .",
    "therefore , semantic similarity between two words @xmath26 and @xmath27 , that is refer to as the cost associated with ` traveling ' from one word to another , is measured by their euclidean distance in the word2vec embedding space , that is , @xmath28    text documents are represented as normalized bag - of - words ( nbow ) vectors , @xmath29 , if word @xmath26 appears @xmath30 times in the document , the @xmath23 element @xmath31 in @xmath32 is defined as , @xmath33    let @xmath32 and @xmath34 be the nbow representation of two text documents , @xmath35 be a flow matrix denotes ` how much ' of word @xmath26 in @xmath32 travels to word @xmath27 in @xmath34 , the similarity evaluation problem can be defined as the minimum cumulative cost required to move all words from @xmath32 to @xmath34 , and the constraints are provided by the solution to the following linear program , @xmath36    after the similarities between @xmath18 being calculated by wmd , we regard these similarity values as the weights of @xmath6 .",
    "although wmd leads to low error rates , the time complexity is as high as @xmath37 . in order to improve the time consumption while maintaining the accuracy ,",
    "we modify wmd by introducing simhash @xcite strategy .",
    "in which , top@xmath38 potentially similar @xmath18 are screened via simhash to reduce the complexity significantly .",
    "the main idea of simhash strategy is to reduce the dimension . as a local sensitive hash method , simhash maps the high - dimensional eigenvectors to a signature value containing @xmath39 bits named @xmath40bit fingerprint . by comparing the hamming distance between @xmath40bit fingerprints",
    ", we can estimate whether the @xmath18 are similar or not .",
    "therefore , an efficient potentially similar @xmath18 screening strategy based on simhash is presented in this paper .    in top@xmath38 potentially similar @xmath18 screening process , simhash is used to map @xmath40bit fingerprints for each @xmath2 . the @xmath23 @xmath2 @xmath41 in dataset",
    "is mapped to @xmath40bit fingerprints with number 0 or 1 , for instance , @xmath42 .",
    "based on the fingerprints , the hamming distance is chosen to estimate the similarity between @xmath18 and generate a list of top@xmath38 potentially similar @xmath18 efficiently . as shown in eq .",
    "[ eq4 ] , hamming distance is the number of ` 1 ' in xor between documents @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "@xmath45    for instance , the hamming distance between 110 and 011 equals 2 since @xmath46 .    after estimating the similarity between @xmath18 by hamming distance",
    ", we can obtain the top@xmath38 potentially similar documents list by directly using sorting algorithms .",
    "but this simple strategy is very time - consuming . even for the best sorting algorithm , its time complexity reaches @xmath47 . aiming at the top@xmath38 @xmath18",
    ", there is no need to sort all hamming distances .",
    "therefore , we propose two strategies to improve the efficiency of potentially similar document lists generating process .    *",
    "( 1 ) the lowliest replace elimination based strategy . *    in this strategy , top@xmath38 potentially similar documents are stored in a finite set of @xmath48 elements , which is defined as @xmath49 .",
    "the update strategy of @xmath50 is    @xmath51    where @xmath52 represents the node which is the farthest from the target node on hamming distance in @xmath50 ; @xmath53 represents a new node which is under judgment to be the potentially similar @xmath18 ; @xmath54 represents the hamming distance between this node and target node .    * ( 2 ) ordered window filling based strategy .",
    "*    the lowliest replace elimination based strategy needs to repeatedly update the maximum value in the finite set .",
    "it takes too much time to traverse the whole set .",
    "therefore , we propose another strategy based on ordered window filling to reduce traversal time further . in this strategy ,",
    "top@xmath38 potentially similar documents are stored in an ordered window of @xmath48 elements , which is defined as @xmath55 .",
    "so , the elements @xmath41 in @xmath56 can be updated via eq .",
    "[ eq6 ] under the condition of @xmath57 , @xmath58 in which , @xmath53 represent a new node which is under judgment to be the potentially similar @xmath18 ; @xmath48 is the size of @xmath56 .    via the screen strategies above",
    ", we obtain the top@xmath38 potentially similar @xmath18 by removing weightless edges from original @xmath7 relational graph .",
    "this process is illustrated by the simple example in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] .",
    "relational modeling processes.,title=\"fig:\",width=529 ] +    firstly , we have a lot of edges in the original @xmath7 relational graph that is a complete graph , as shown in fig . [ fig2](a ) . by screening the top-3 potentially similar @xmath18",
    ", we remove the weightless edges in fig .",
    "[ fig2](a ) , and then obtain the @xmath7 relational graph , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2](b ) .",
    "the edges are directed since two @xmath18 may not be the top@xmath38 similar for each other at the same time .",
    "as there are only a small number of edges which link the potentially similar documents left , the time consumption of the similarity evaluation process with wmd method is reduced sharply .",
    "then @xmath7 relational graph can be completed efficiently via two stages , i.e. , top@xmath38 potentially similar @xmath2 screening and docs similarity evaluation via wmd method .",
    "each @xmath2 contains different numbers of @xmath19 .",
    "therefore , the @xmath9 relational modeling can be considered as a decomposition process .",
    "the core issue of the @xmath9 relational modeling process is to extract items from standard documents accurately .",
    "since @xmath18 in equipment - standard system have typical hierarchical structure , the section numbers in section headers are always composed of integers and symbolic points , ` 2.2 ' for instance .",
    "furthermore , the section number will be followed by the section title directly .",
    "therefore , all the possible section numbers and titles can be extracted via regular expressions to construct a triplet sequence @xmath59 .",
    "in which , @xmath60 is the chapter number that is the first integer of section number ( for example , ` 2 ' is the chapter number when the section number is ` 2.2 ' ) ; @xmath61 is the whole section number ; @xmath62 is the line number of title in the document .",
    "for instance , a possible triplet may like this : ( 5 , 5.2.1 , 456 ) .",
    "the results obtained via regular expressions still contain some noises that meet the definition of the section title but not the real one , such as data in the table or in the text of the reference data .",
    "for this reason , we design following noise - filtering rule to remove those illogical triplets ,    @xmath63    in which , section number must conform the typesetting format of sections ( when @xmath64 , the logical value of @xmath65 can only be 2.2.1 or 2.3 or 3 ) ; the chapter number @xmath66 must be no less than all the chapter numbers in the previous triplets . @xmath67 in the triplet sequence must be sorted .    according to the noise - filtering rule ,",
    "most of noises are erased . as a result",
    ", we can use the line number in triplets to decompose the @xmath18 and to extract out the @xmath19 accurately . at the same time",
    ", the @xmath9 relational network is constructed .",
    "79 standard documents have been used to test the @xmath3 extracting process .",
    "there are 77 documents extracted correct completely .",
    "the other two documents have only 1 incorrect item respectively .",
    "the accuracy of the @xmath19 extracting process is 97.5% .      in hinm - ess ,",
    "two relationships , @xmath11 and @xmath15 , are widely used in equipment - standard system application .",

    "generally , there are part of @xmath19 have been assigned @xmath4 labels , that is , there are some known @xmath15 relationships in equipment - standard system . hence , these relationships can be used to measure the correlation between @xmath19 and @xmath20 indirectly , and then complete the @xmath15 relational model .    for a new @xmath3 @xmath68 that is waiting for assigning @xmath4 label ,",

    "<S> entity information network is used to describe structural relationships between entities . taking advantage of its extension and heterogeneity , </S>",
    "<S> entity information network is more and more widely applied to relationship modeling . </S>",
    "<S> recent years , lots of researches about entity information network modeling have been proposed , while seldom of them concentrate on equipment - standard system with properties of multi - layer , multi - dimension and multi - scale . in order to efficiently deal with some complex issues in equipment - standard system such as standard revising , standard controlling , and production designing , a heterogeneous information network model for equipment - standard system </S>",
    "<S> is proposed in this paper . </S>",
    "<S> three types of entities and six types of relationships are considered in the proposed model . </S>",
    "<S> correspondingly , several different similarity - measuring methods are used in the modeling process . </S>",
    "<S> the experiments show that the heterogeneous information network model established in this paper can reflect relationships between entities accurately . </S>",
    "<S> meanwhile , the modeling process has a good performance on time consumption .    complex system , heterogeneous information network , equipment - standard system , entity relationships model </S>"
