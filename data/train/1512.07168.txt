    "understanding phase transitions and broken symmetries in frustrated many - body quantum systems remains one of the major challenges of modern physics .",
    "frustration in magnetic systems occurs by competing exchange interactions and leads frequently to disordered spin liquids @xcite .",
    "however , this does not happen in two - dimensional ( 2d ) classical systems where ordered states with broken @xmath7 symmetry occur at finite temperature , as in the exactly solvable ising models with fully frustrated lattice , or with frustration distributed periodically along columns @xcite .",
    "in contrast , quantum spins interacting by su(2 ) symmetric interactions order only at zero temperature in the 2d heisenberg model . whether or not 2d quantum spin models with interactions of lower symmetry",
    "do order at finite temperature is a challenging problem in the theory .",
    "unfortunately , quantum spin systems interacting on a square lattice are not exactly solvable as entanglement plays an important role @xcite , and advanced methods which deal with entangled degrees of freedom have to be applied .",
    "perhaps the simplest example of frustrated quantum exchange interactions is found in the 2d compass model @xcite , where two different spin components interact along horizontal or vertical bonds of the square lattice .",
    "recent interest in the compass models is motivated by spin - orbital physics in transition metal oxides with active orbital degrees of freedom @xcite .",
    "this field is very challenging due to the interplay and entanglement of spins and orbitals which leads to remarkable consequences in real materials @xcite .",
    "however , when spin order is ferromagnetic or when spin and orbitals couple strongly by spin - orbit interaction @xcite , the exchange interactions simplify and concern only orbitals or pseudopins . a generic model which stands for all these situations",
    "is the 2d compass model .",
    "it represents directional orbital interactions between @xmath8 or @xmath9 orbitals on the bonds in a 2d square or three - dimensional ( 3d ) cubic lattice @xcite .",
    "its better understanding is crucial not only for spin - orbital systems but also for its realizations in optical lattices @xcite . unlike the spins interacting by heisenberg su(2 )",
    "symmetric exchange , the 2d compass model for orbitals breaks the symmetry at finite temperature in form of nematic order @xcite .",
    "it is remarkable that in nanoscopic systems this order survives perturbing heisenberg interactions in the lowest energy excited states , providing a perspective for its applications in quantum computing @xcite .",
    "a better understanding of the signatures of this phase transition provides a theoretical challenge .    to address these questions we develop below tensor network renormalization at finite temperature , following the pioneering work by two of us @xcite .",
    "the quantum tensor networks proved to be a competitive tool to study strongly correlated quantum systems @xcite .",
    "their advent was a discovery of the density matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) @xcite that was later shown to optimize the matrix product state ( mps ) variational _ ansatz _ @xcite .",
    "over the last decade , mps was generalized to a 2d projected entangled pair state ( peps ) @xcite and supplemented with the multiscale entanglement renormalization _ ansatz _ ( mera ) @xcite . as variational methods these networks do not suffer from the fermionic sign problem @xcite and fermionic peps provided the most accurate results for the @xmath10 @xcite and hubbard @xcite models employed to study the high-@xmath11 superconductivity .",
    "the networks  both mps @xcite and peps @xcite  made also some major breakthroughs in the search for topological order .",
    "this is where geometric frustration often prohibits the traditional quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) .",
    "thermal states of quantum hamiltonians were explored much less than their ground states . in one - dimensional ( 1d ) models they can be represented by mps _ ansatz _ prepared by accurate imaginary time evolution @xcite .",
    "a similar approach can be applied in 2d case @xcite  the peps manifold is a compact representation for gibbs states @xcite  but the accurate evolution proved to be more challenging there .",
    "alternative direct contractions of the 3d partition function were proposed @xcite but , due to local tensor update , they are expected to converge more slowly with increasing refinement parameter .",
    "even a small improvement towards the full update can accelerate the convergence significantly @xcite .",
    "this research parallels similar progress in finite temperature variational monte carlo , see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite .    in order to overcome these problems ,",
    "two of us introduced a variational algorithm to optimize a finite temperature projected entangled - pair operator ( pepo ) @xcite .",
    "the 3d network @xmath0 is coarse - grained along the imaginary time @xmath2 ( inverse temperature ) to obtain the pepo _ ansatz _ for @xmath0 .",
    "the coarse - graining is optimized variationally  employing full / nonlocal tensor environments  in order to maximize the accuracy of the coarse - grained pepo . a benchmark application to the 2d quantum ising model in transverse field was presented in ref . @xcite .",
    "in this paper we move near the edge of geometric frustration and apply the same algorithm to the 2d isotropic quantum compass model @xcite .",
