    "the formation and evolution of massive galaxies is one of the most studied and debated topics in extragalactic astronomy today . in the local universe the most massive galaxies primarily populate a well defined relation in the color - magnitude space known as the `` red - sequence '' ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "we simultaneously make use of the broad band fluxes and near - ir spectra .",
    "thus , special attention should be placed to make sure that the aperture used for the extraction of the spectra and the aperture used to compute the broad band fluxes are the same .",
    "in order not to introduce artificial correlations among adjacent pixels we worked on images with the original pixel scales . as a consequence , typical softwares used to compute object fluxes in matched apertures in different images could not be used .    in order to create the multi - band catalog of aperture - matched fluxes we proceeded as follow .",
    "we first used the sextractor software @xcite to detect objects in the deepest @xmath42-band images and to compute the parameters of the kron elliptical apertures ( semi - axes and position angle ) .",
    "the kron apertures , as computed by sextractor , are intended to give the most precise estimate of total magnitudes for galaxies .",
    "details about the routine can be found in the sextractor manual .",
    "for each galaxy , we then computed the total flux in all bands , using the @xmath42-band - defined aperture and a custom idl code .",
    "the elliptical apertures were then appropriately scaled to account for different pixel scales between the uvis and ir detectors .",
    "the local background for each elliptical aperture was calculated within a square annulus , using the same prescription as in sextractor . within each annulus ,",
    "the background per pixel was computed as a 3-@xmath43 clipped mean .",
    "then , the total background - subtracted flux was computed within the aperture by adding all the aperture pixels .",
    "flux uncertainties were computed using monte carlo simulations .",
    "we created 1,000 images for each galaxy , by randomizing the flux in each pixel of the elliptical aperture according to a normal distribution with a width provided by the @xmath44 error map .",
    "we measure the total elliptical flux as explained above on each of the simulated images .",
    "we then computed the @xmath44 errors by fitting a gaussian to the distribution of the 1,000 measured fluxes .",

    "for undetected sources in the other bands , we show the @xmath45 flux limit in the figures .    because of the significantly lower spatial resolution of the _ spitzer _ images , irac 3.6@xmath37",
    "m  fluxes were computed independently from the hst fluxes , using the `` spitzer enhanced imaging products '' pipeline , with some modifications ( details in capak et al .",
    ", in prep . ) .",
    "briefly , the pipeline utilizes the spitzer mopex software package to create a mosaic for each irac image , before identifying and extracting sources using sextractor .",
    "fixed aperture fluxes were computed for each object , using an aperture of 28 diameter .",
    "this is a smaller aperture compered to the typical 38 and 58 diameter apertures used in the `` spitzer enhanced imaging products '' catalog .",
    "however , our exposures are significantly deeper than the standard images analyzed with the pipeline , so a smaller aperture is more appropriate to reduce contamination from nearby neighbors .",
    "the aperture fluxes were corrected to total fluxes assuming the objects are point sources .",
    "this is a fair assumption as the fwhm of the _ spitzer _ point - spread function ( psf from now on ) of 15 is larger than the fwhm in near - ir of the largest resolved sources used in this paper ( 143 ) .",
    "the _ spitzer _ and wfc3 catalogs were cross - matched using target coordinates , by searching within a radius of 15 .",
    "we flagged all sources for which multiple objects fell within the psf of the irac data .",

    "if not properly removed , the flux contribution from nearby sources may substantially change the total flux and shape of the extracted spectra , preventing an accurate fit of the spectral energy distribution ( sed ; e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "we do not remove these galaxies from the sample of quenched objects for the following reasons : first , if star - formation is at the origin of the detected emission lines , the line fluxes implies sfrs of about 0.4@xmath118 ( using a kennicutt 1998 conversion ) , which , given the masses of these objects , would still make them quenched according to our ssfr definition .",

    "only one upper - limit among 26 data points is consistent with this blue sed model .",
    "in addition , we also considered only those models with old ( @xmath150 ) primary stellar component .",
    "the resulting best - fit model is shown in green in figure  [ fig : coadsb ] . similarly to the previous library , also this best - fit model over - predicts the flux at these blue wavelengths , and it is consistent with only four out of 26 observed uvis data points .",
    "finally , we overplot in red the best fit model found for galaxies _ on _ the red - sequence , with the proper minimization - scaling factor to fit the _ off _ red - sequence data .",
    "this model is reasonably compatible with the individual - galaxy uvis data ( as before , not included in fit ) , but it clearly over - predicts the flux in the red extreme of the coadded spectrum .    in summary , after testing a library of models that include a secondary sb , we have found that they can not reproduce the `` rejuvenation '' scenario for most of our _ off _ red - sequence galaxies . the better fits are produced with overall young stellar populations ( for both , main component and sb ) , resembling a single - young stellar component .",
    "the use of @xmath149 main stellar components systematically over / under predict the data flux at different wavelengths .",
    "we remind the reader , however , we have not consider extinction in the model library used in this section . as we have seen before , extinction is a poorly constraint parameter that also introduces strong degeneracies with other spps .",
    "therefore , the results shown in this section must be taken with caution , and restricted to the model library we use here .",
    "we also investigate the fraction of quenched galaxies which have already settled on the red - sequence ( @xmath151 ) and those which have not , at the average redshift of our sample ( @xmath152 ) . using the red - sequence computed above",
    ", we found that 28/41 galaxies fall within 2@xmath43 of the red - sequence .",
    "these galaxies comprise 68% of our whole sample .",
    "since all blue sf galaxies are excluded from our selection , we infer that less than @xmath153 of all galaxies at @xmath108 with @xmath115 fall on the red - sequence .",
    "we stress that this is an upper limit .",
    "while our @xmath42@xmath39@xmath46  color pre - selection allows us to select all of the red galaxies at @xmath154 , it systematically excludes blue galaxies at the same redshifts .",
    "we can improve the upper limit on @xmath151 by including emission - line - selected sources in the same apparent magnitude , redshift and mass ranges of our sample .",
    "for this , we use the @xcite sample of emission - line galaxies from 17 wisp fields ( all fields in common with our sample ) .",
    "these galaxies are selected only by the presence of the h@xmath9  emission line .",
    "dominguez et al .",
    "limit their search to @xmath155 , thus probing a smaller volume compared to our study . as a result",
    "the value of @xmath151 provided below has still to be considered as an upper limit .",
    "we applied the same @xmath46-band magnitude , mass and redshift selection criteria used in our sample galaxies , to identify sources within our parameter ranges .",
    "this selection results in 15 galaxies which are not in common with our galaxy sample .",
    "stellar masses from dominguez et al .  were scaled by a factor of 1.7 to account for the different imfs used ( chabrier in their case , salpeter in ours ) . by scaling the number of emission - line sources to our number of fields ,",
    "we derive an expected number of 24 blue massive emission - line galaxies .",
    "this implies that , at @xmath152 , @xmath156 .",
    "recently , @xcite predicted the evolution of the red fraction as a function of galaxy mass and redshift , based uniquely on empirically - motivated relations .",
    "peng et al .",
    "predict that at @xmath108 , at the median mass of our galaxy sample , between 70 to 90% of the galaxies should have colors consistent with being on the red - sequence .",
    "these fractions were derived from their predictions for galaxies in low - density environments .",
    "we also note that , even though the typical mass of our sample is well within what peng et al .",
    "identify as the `` mass quenching '' regime , ( i.e. , quenching depends only on intrinsic properties of the galaxy and _ not _ by the local environment it inhabits ) our color - mass relation in figure[fig : umr_mass ] does not show such a mass dependency . in our data ,",
    "whether a quenched galaxy resides on or off the red - sequence appears to be independent of the galaxy s mass . on the contrary",
    ", a mass - dependent quenching mechanism would demand a rising left - to - right gradient in the color - mass diagram , such as the most massive galaxies mostly populate the red - sequence while less massive systems should be bluer .",
    "this is not observed in our galaxy sample , despite covering one order of magnitude in mass .",
    "therefore , it seems reasonable to conclude that both internal ( e.g. , mass quenching ) and external ( e.g. , environment ) mechanisms are at play in quenching the star formation in some of these massive galaxies .",
    "we speculate that the young massive galaxies with no on - going star formation observed at @xmath108 may be in transition between a phase of vigorous star - formation at @xmath157 and the @xmath152 red - sequence .",
    "the large masses and short sf - timescales that characterize these galaxies imply very high past sfrs ( of the order of @xmath158m@xmath107 yr@xmath159 ) .",
    "the survey volume covered in the @xmath160 redshift range is a few @xmath161mpc@xmath162 , implying a volume density for our quenched galaxies of @xmath163mpc@xmath164 . even considering that we had to remove from our sample about half of the galaxies because of spectral contamination",
    ", this volume density is still comfortably below the observed space densities of some of the likely progenitors of these sources , i.e. , ultra luminous ir galaxies at @xmath165 ( 6@xmath166mpc@xmath164 * ? ? ?",
    "+   + finally , we would like to highlight the results presented in this paper do not change strongly because of a misclassification of emission - line galaxies as `` quenched '' . if we remove the 4 quenched galaxies with emission from the sample we find the following results .",
    "first , for quenched galaxies on and off the red - sequence the median ages ( @xmath167 and @xmath168 ) and single - component ages from coadded spectra ( @xmath169 and @xmath168 ) are virtually unchanged with respect to our complete sample estimations .",
    "second , we find that 72% ( 68% previously ) of the sample galaxies are on the red - sequence . also the @xmath156 does not change with respect the upper limit found previously . in consequence",
    ", we can be confident that neither the results not the global picture presented in this work are affected by sf galaxies misclassified as quenched systems .",
    "we have used the wisp survey to identify a sample of massive ( @xmath115 ) galaxies at redshift @xmath170 .",
    "the sample was selected to have @xmath42@xmath39@xmath46@xmath65 and @xmath46@xmath171 , in 27 independent fields , overcoming the effect of cosmic variance , which typically plagues massive galaxy samples at these redshifts .",
    "our color selection implies that the final sample is biased against star - forming galaxies .",
    "we derived stellar population parameters by fitting stellar population models to the combined broad band photometry ( hst / wfc3-uvis , hst / wfc3-ir , _",
    "spitzer_/irac ) and ir spectra ( @xmath172m@xmath173 m ) .",
    "we have shown that the availability of rest - frame optical spectra covering the 4000  /balmer breaks dramatically improves the reliability and accuracy of the derived stellar population parameters .",
    "our results are based on a color- _ and _ mass - selected sample 41 quenched galaxies . in agreement with other studies , we find that , at @xmath174 , the mass range above @xmath126 is populated by galaxies with a wide range of stellar population properties .",
    "we find that quenched galaxies are well fitted with exponentially decreasing sfhs , and short star - formation timescales ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "they also show a wide distribution in stellar ages , between 1 - 4 gyr .",
    "we find that quenched galaxies are far from being an homogeneous population . in the @xmath4-versus - mass space ,",
    "quenched galaxies have a large spread in rest - frame color at a given mass .",
    "most quenched galaxies populate the @xmath175 `` red - sequence '' , although 32% of them have substantially bluer colors .",
    "we find that quenched galaxies _ on _ the red - sequence have older median ages ( 3.1gyr ) than the quenched galaxies _ off _ the red - sequence ( 1.5gyr ) .",
    "the average ages of the two subsamples ( on and off the red - sequence ) are confirmed by the analysis of their stacked spectra .",
    "furthermore , we also demonstrated that a `` rejuvenated '' sed can not reproduce the observed stacked spectra .",
    "we derive the upper limit on the fraction of galaxies on the red - sequence at @xmath152 to be @xmath156 , in disagreement with empirical model predictions from peng et al .",
    "( 2010 , @xmath17670 - 90% ) .",
    "this mismatch can partially be due to the peng et al. assumption of an instantaneous quenching mechanism .",
    "however , the homogeneous spread in mass of our quenched galaxies on and off the red - sequence suggests that more than one mechanism is responsible of the quenching at these stellar masses ( i.e. , internal , galaxy - mass dependant vs.  external , environmental triggers ) .",
    "we speculate that the young massive galaxies with no on - going star formation are in a transition phase between vigorous star formation at @xmath6 and the @xmath2 red - sequence . according to their estimated ages , the time required for quenched galaxies _ off _ the red - sequence to join their counterparts _ on _ the @xmath152 red - sequence is of the order of @xmath7 .",
    "the open question remains concerning what",

    "second , short sfhs ( @xmath89myr ) are recovered independently of the data set used to derive redshifts and spps . for more extended sfhs ( @xmath244 ) , however , we found that we are able to recover similarly extended sfhs only for data sets with 2 uvis detections independently of the redshift .",
    "overall , these simulations imply we were able to broadly discriminate between @xmath245 above and below @xmath246 .    in panel ( e ) of figure[fig :",
    "inout_all ] we present the difference between output and input sfrs versus @xmath233 . over the entire redshift range we can successfully recover @xmath247 with uncertainties @xmath248 . for @xmath249 , however , the uncertainties in the systematics increase steadily reaching @xmath250 at @xmath251 .",
    "the different retrieved redshifts make no much of a difference on this trend , but only increase the scatter on the median systematic errors at high @xmath217 .",
    "for this reason , in table  [ tab : systerr ] we present the systematics in sfr independently of redshift .",
    "the strong systematic over - prediction of the sfr for @xmath251 , however , does not have a significant impact in our paper .",
    "first , we base the science on a quenched galaxy sample which always has the low - sfrs we can successfully retrieve .",
    "second , we do not make claims based on the precise values of the sfrs .",
    "we only use it through the _ specific _ sfr to identify quenched galaxies ( @xmath252 ) . as no further claims",
    "are made based on ssfrs , the relevant test is to determine if an intrinsically quenched / sf galaxy can be recovered as such with our procedure , independently of the exact value of their ssfr .",
    "stellar population properties like ssfr and sfh are closely linked .",
    "for example , at the time of observation a galaxy with an extended sfh is more likely to show a higher ssfr than a short - burst galaxy .",
    "also , our ability to constraint these properties is tightly related to the constraints we can provide with the data . of particular importance is the number of uvis detections available to constraint these spps .",
    "detections in the rest - frame uv are more likely to occur in sf galaxies . for these reasons we decided to explore the success in recovering ssfrs and sfhs for different uvis data sets in our entire redshift range . in this exercise",
    "we did not explore individual values of ssfr and sfh but _ ranges _ within which these parameters are reliable .",
    "for the ssfr two regimes were defined as above / below @xmath253 ( our quenched / sf selection criterion ) . as",
    "already mentioned in previous paragraphs , sfhs are defined as short - sfhs if @xmath254 , and extended if @xmath244 .",
    "our results show that the reliability of the recovered sfhs and ssfrs depends on the constraints from the uvis data .",
    "at all redshifts we reliably recovered the quenched and short - sfh models ( the relevant sources for this paper ) .",
    "this was independent on the level of constraint from uvis data ( two upper limits , one and two detections ) . on the contrary , and",
    "just to give the complete picture to the reader , sf and extended - sfh models were harder to constraint . only those models with 2 uvis detections provided reliably recovered sfhs and ssfrs .",
    "+ in figure  [ fig : inout_all_noirac ] we present the systematic uncertainties of all our spps and redshifts for sed fits on which no irac  @xmath97 data was used ( referred as no - irac from now on ) .",
    "a summary of the systematic errors for no - irac models is shown in the right column of table[tab : systerr ] .",
    "we observe that @xmath255 of the model seds experience convergence issues during the @xmath72-minimization .",
    "this percentage is fairly constant for our entire range of @xmath215 models . in a closer analysis of these cases we found that models with @xmath256 are frequent among the nonconverging cases , particularly at @xmath257",
    "this does not imply , however , that a majority of high-@xmath258 models do not converge . during the selection of our galaxy sample ,",
    "the cases of nonconvergence for no - irac galaxies were very few . in any case ,",
    "given the number of no - irac galaxies in our final sample , a @xmath259 of failed convergence would imply that at the most we are loosing 1 galaxy for this reason .",
    "overall , we conclude from this analysis that the irac  @xmath97 data makes it eaier to constraint sources with high extinction .    as a test , to avoid misinterpreting the slightly smaller number statistics of no - irac simulations with respect the irac counterpart , we remove from the later the non - convergent models of the former .",
    "we found that the systematic errors and dispersions of the simulations with irac barely change after removing those models .",
    "therefore we can confidently interpret differences among irac / no - irac models as the consequence of lacking the @xmath97 data .",
    "for all the spps no major changes were observed in the median systematic errors by using or not irac data . for @xmath217 no changes in the systematics",
    "was observed with respect the simulations with irac .",
    "the systematics in stellar ages remain fairly stable , with a 10% increment in the systematic uncertainties for @xmath260 .",
    "only a reduction from 75 to 65% appears for the younger ages at @xmath261 .",
    "however , as the uncertainties for that age regime are very large , we decided to keep 75% of error in the systematics for the no - irac models for those age and redshift ranges .",
    "the sfhs are still well recovered within the broad categories defined above ( exponentially declined with @xmath262 and @xmath263 ) .",
    "the no - irac model runs only suggest a larger fraction of misidentified @xmath264 as @xmath265 .",
    "also , without irac , less models are misclassified as exponentially - increasing sfhs .",
    "the lack of irac data has limited effect on the median systematics of stellar mass .",
    "it mostly widens the distributions shown on panel d of figure  [ fig : inout_all_noirac ] were the stronger effects are observed at high-@xmath215 .",
    "this implies that the stellar mass of a galaxy is probably better constraint by using irac , particularly at high retrieved redshift .",
    "however , this does not translate into a larger _ average _ offset in the systematics on no - irac models : only at @xmath266 a mild increment of 5% in the systematic error is measured .",
    "the @xmath267 suffer from minor variations in the uncertainty on the systematics for no - irac models .",
    "as it might be expected at this point , the lack of irac data does not prevent us to constraint the ssfr as we did for the models with irac photometry .",
    "+     but for sed fits without irac  @xmath268 data .",
    "analogously to figure  [ fig : z_out ] ( right panel ) , in panel f we show the weighted mean systematic uncertainties in @xmath217 for sed fits without irac data .",
    "the @xmath215-color code is the same as in figures  [ fig : z_out ] and [ fig : inout_all].,width=680 ]    in summary , our study of the systematic uncertainties in the sed fitting procedure allowed us to identify those specific data sets ( combinations of photometry and spectroscopy ) which did not provide enough constraint to reliably recover certain spps .",
    "apart of a@xmath224 and ages from sources at @xmath26<1.3 , quenched - galaxy spps are fairly well constrained independently of the data set used . concerning the actual systematic uncertainties we retrieved , there is no significant bias in the derived stellar masses , ( s)sfr , sfh and ages ( the later at @xmath26>1.3 ) for galaxies with and without irac photometry .",
    "our ability to constraint spps with our current data set is in part constrained by our uncertainty in redshift determination , for which the 4000 - break is the key ingredient .",
    "a summary of the systematic errors for each discussed spp is presented in table[tab : systerr ] .",
    "+   + some final remarks : we should mention that systematic uncertainties would increase / decrease in case of an imf variation within our galaxy sample .",
    "the variation in the imf is a very debated topic where most of the recent developments are restricted to local galaxy data .",
    "a recent paper of @xcite on local early - type galaxies suggests the existence of a range of imfs from heavier - salpeter to chabrier cases . in this work , however , and for the specific mass - range of our galaxy sample ( assuming @xmath115 galaxies have velocity dispersions @xmath269 ) , there is no correlation between imf and stellar mass .",
    "galaxies in this mass - range spread from heavier - salpeter to chabrier like imfs ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite present a theoretical study on the systematic effects of sed fitting in stellar mass estimations . for different stellar - population - synthesis models ( a bruzual & charlot version and maraston et al.2005 ) and imfs ( * ? ?",
    "* and a non - universal imf ) these authors find no imf - dependency on mass estimations in our mass - range . for high masses the scatter in the systematics is large independently of model / imf used with dispersions ranging from 20 - 300% the value of the original input mass .",
    "all these results may imply that imf variations are a galaxy - to - galaxy phenomenon , information we certainly lack .",
    "therefore we chose to use a unique salpeter imf for our calculations as it seems to be representative of the galaxy population we are studying .",
    "it also allowed us to directly compare our results with similar stellar population studies in literature .",

    "<S> we combine hst g102 & g141 nir grism spectroscopy with hst / wfc3-uvis , hst / wfc3-ir and _ spitzer_/irac[@xmath0 photometry to assemble a sample of massive ( @xmath1 ) and quenched galaxies at @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> our sample of 41 galaxies is the largest with g102+g141 nir spectroscopy for quenched sources at these redshifts . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast to the local universe , @xmath2 quenched galaxies in the high - mass range have a wide range of stellar population properties . </S>",
    "<S> we find their seds are well fitted with exponentially decreasing sfhs , and short star - formation time - scales ( @xmath3 ) . quenched </S>",
    "<S> galaxies also show a wide distribution in ages , between 1 - 4gyr . in the @xmath4-versus - mass space </S>",
    "<S> quenched galaxies have a large spread in rest - frame color at a given mass . </S>",
    "<S> most quenched galaxies populate the @xmath2 red - sequence ( rs ) , but an important fraction of them ( 32% ) have substantially bluer colors . </S>",
    "<S> although with a large spread , we find that the quenched galaxies _ on _ the rs have older median ages ( 3.1gyr ) than the quenched galaxies _ off _ the rs ( 1.5gyr ) . we also show that a rejuvenated sed can not reproduce the observed stacked spectra of ( the bluer ) quenched galaxies _ off _ the rs . </S>",
    "<S> we derive the upper limit on the fraction of massive galaxies _ on _ the rs at @xmath2 to be @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> we speculate that the young quenched galaxies _ off _ the rs are in a transition phase between vigorous star formation at @xmath6 and the @xmath2 rs . according to their estimated ages , the time required for quenched galaxies _ off _ the rs to join their counterparts _ on _ the @xmath2 rs is of the order of @xmath7 . </S>"
