    "the discovery of charged higgs bosons @xcite will provide a concrete evidence of the multi - doublet structure of the higgs sector .",
    "recent efforts have focused on their relevance to supersymmetry ( susy ) , in particular in the mssm , which incorporates exactly two higgs doublets , yielding  after spontaneous ew symmetry breaking  five physical higgs states : the neutral pseudoscalar ( @xmath11 ) , the lightest ( @xmath4 ) and heaviest ( @xmath12 ) neutral scalars and two charged ones ( @xmath13 ) .    in much of the parameter space preferred by susy , namely @xmath14 and @xmath15 @xcite , the lhc will provide the greatest opportunity for the discovery of @xmath13 particles .",
    "in fact , over the above @xmath6 region , the tevatron ( run 2 ) discovery potential is limited to charged higgs masses smaller than @xmath16 @xcite .",
    "however , at the lhc , whereas the detection of light charged higgs bosons ( with @xmath17 ) is rather straightforward in the decay channel @xmath18 for most @xmath6 values , thanks to the huge top - antitop production rate , the search is notoriously difficult for heavy masses ( when @xmath19 ) , because of the large reducible and irreducible backgrounds associated with the main decay mode @xmath20 , following the dominant production channel @xmath21 @xcite .",
    "( notice that the rate of the latter exceeds by far other possible production modes @xcite@xcite , this rendering it the only viable channel at the cern machine in the heavy mass region . )    the analysis of the @xmath20 signature has been the subject of many debates @xcite@xcite , whose conclusion is that the lhc discovery potential is satisfactory , but only provided that @xmath6 is small ( @xmath22 ) or large ( @xmath23 ) enough and the charged higgs boson mass is below 600 gev or so .",
    "a recent analysis @xcite has shown that the @xmath24 decay mode , indeed dominant for light charged higgs states and exploitable below the top threshold for any accessible @xmath6 @xcite , can be used at the lhc even in the large @xmath25 case , in order to discover @xmath13 scalars in the parameter range @xmath26 and 200 gev @xmath27 tev .",
    "besides , if the distinctive @xmath28 polarisation @xcite is used in this channel , the latter can provide at least as good a heavy @xmath13 signature as the @xmath20 decay mode ( for the large @xmath6 regime @xcite ) .    at present",
    "then , it is the @xmath29 region of the mssm which ought to be explored through other decay modes , especially those where direct mass reconstruction is possible .",
    "the most obvious of these is the @xmath30 channel @xcite ( see also @xcite ) , proceeding via the production of a charged gauge boson and the lightest higgs scalar of the mssm , with the former on- or off - shell depending on the relative values of @xmath25 and @xmath31 .",
    "in fact , its branching ratio ( br ) can be rather large , competing with the bottom - top decay mode and overwhelming the tau - neutrino one for @xmath32 at low @xmath6 : see figs .",
    "[ fig : brs][fig : brh ] . besides",
    ", under the assumption that the @xmath4 scalar has previously been discovered ( which we embrace here ) , its kinematics is rather constrained , around two resonant decay modes , @xmath33 2 jets ( or lepton - neutrino ) and @xmath1 , an aspect which allows for a significant reduction of the qcd background . as demonstrated in ref .",
    "@xcite , signals of charged higgs bosons in the @xmath34 range can be seen in this channel , provided that 200 gev @xmath35 gev ( see also @xcite for an experimental simulation ) .",
    "the above lower limit on @xmath6 corresponds to the border of the exclusion region drawn from lep2 direct searches for the mssm @xmath4 scalar , whose mass bound is now set at @xmath36 gev or so @xcite .",
    "it is the purpose of this letter that of resuming the studies of ref .",
    "@xcite , by analysing the contribution to the background due to several irreducible processes , not considered there , whose presence could spoil the feasibility of charged higgs searches in the @xmath37 mode of the mssm .",
    "the plan of this paper is as follows . in the next section",
    "we discuss possible signals and backgrounds , their implementation and list the values adopted for the various parameters needed for their computation .",
    "section 3 is devoted to the presentation and discussion of the results .",
    "conclusions are in section 4 .",
    "we generate the signal cross sections by using the formulae of ref .",
    "that is , we implement the @xmath38 matrix element ( me ) for the process @xmath39 this nicely embeds both the @xmath40 subprocess of top - antitop production and decay , which is dominant for @xmath41 , as well as the @xmath42 + c.c .",
    "one of @xmath43-fusion and @xmath13-bremsstrahlung , which is responsible for charged higgs production in the case @xmath44 @xcite . the me of process ( [ signalme ] ) has been computed by means of the spinor techniques of refs .",
    "@xcite@xcite .    in the @xmath45 channel , assuming high efficiency and purity in selecting / rejecting @xmath46-/non-@xmath46-jets , possible irreducible background processes are the following ( we consider only the @xmath47-initiated channels ) :    1 .",
    "the @xmath48 continuum ; 2 .   @xmath49 production , especially when @xmath50 ; 3 .   the qcd induced case @xmath51 ; 4 .   and , finally , @xmath52 and @xmath53 intermediate states ;    in which @xmath54 , plus their c.c . channels .",
    "once the top quark appearing in the above reactions decays , two @xmath3 bosons are present in each event",
    ". we will eventually assume the @xmath55 pair to decay semi - leptonically to light - quark jets , electrons / muons and corresponding neutrinos .",
    "furthermore , we will require to tag exactly three @xmath46-jets in the final state ( e.g. , by using @xmath56-vertex or high @xmath57 lepton techniques ) .",
    "the same ` signature ' was considered in ref .",
    "@xcite , where only the ` intrinsic ' @xmath58 background and the qcd noise due to ` @xmath59 + jet ' events were studied ( with jet signifying here either a @xmath46- , light - quark or gluon jet , the latter two mistagged for the former ) .    both signal and background mes have been integrated numerically by means of vegas @xcite and , for test purposes , of rambo @xcite and metropolis @xcite as well .",
    "while proceeding to the phase space integration , one also has to fold in the @xmath60-dependent parton distribution functions ( pdfs ) for the two incoming gluons .",
    "these have been evaluated at leading - order , by means of the package mrs - lo(05a ) @xcite .",
    "the numerical values of the sm parameters are ( @xmath61 ) : @xmath62 @xmath63 @xmath64 @xmath65 as for the top width @xmath66 , we have used the lo value calculated within the mssm ( i.e. , @xmath67 gev if @xmath68 ) .    concerning the mssm parameters , we proceed as follows .",
    "for a start , we assume that the mass of the lightest neutral higgs particle ( but not @xmath6 ) is already known , thanks to its discovery at either lep2 , tevatron ( run 2 ) or from early analyses at the lhc itself . thus , for us , @xmath69 is a fixed parameter , assuming for reference the following discrete values : e.g. , 90 , 100 , 110 , 120 and 130 gev .",
    "then we express all other higgs masses as a function of @xmath25 and @xmath6 . for the pseudoscalar higgs boson mass ,",
    "the tree - level relation @xmath70 is assumed .",
    "radiative corrections then , of arbitrary perturbative order , are in practice embedded in the @xmath12 mass and the mixing angle @xmath71 . in general , notice that , at the ` renormalisation group improved ' one - loop level @xcite , it is only for very large values of the lightest stop mass and of the squark mixing parameters that @xmath2 can escape the lep2 bound in the low @xmath6 region , on which we will focus most of our attention .",
    "finally , notice that we develop our discussion at the parton level , without considering fragmentation and hadronisation effects .",
    "thus , jets are identified with the partons from which they originate and all cuts are applied directly to the latter .",
    "in particular , when selecting @xmath46-jets , a vertex tagging is implied , with a finite efficiency , @xmath72 , per each tag . moreover , we assume no correlations among multiple tags , nor do we include misidentification of light - quark ( including @xmath73-quark-)jets produced in @xmath3 decays as @xmath46-jets .",
    "as a preliminary exercise , we study the total production and decay cross sections before any cuts , as all our reactions are finite over their entire phase spaces ( recall that @xmath74 ) .",
    "this is done in figs .",
    "[ fig : cross90][fig : cross100 ] for the signal and the five background processes discussed in the previous section , for five values of @xmath6 , over the range 140 gev @xmath75 500 gev , for @xmath76 and 100 gev , in the channel @xmath77 , where @xmath78 or @xmath11 .",
    "( of course , the @xmath79 and @xmath80 backgrounds have no dependence on any of the three parameters above[fig : cross100 ] account for the c.c .",
    "production modes as well . ] . ) as for the decay rates of the top ( anti)quark and the @xmath3 boson , for sake of simplicity , we take them equal to @xmath81 for the time being .",
    "the signal is always dominated by the qcd background and  at large @xmath6  also by the ew ones . notice the local maxima of the signal rates at @xmath82 , as induced by the opening of the @xmath83 decay ( compare to figs .",
    "[ fig : brs][fig : brh ] ) , and the minima as well , due to the onset of the @xmath20 channel instead .    in the reminder of our analysis , we assume semi - leptonic decays of @xmath55 pairs , as in ref .",
    "@xcite : i.e. , @xmath84 ( hereafter , jet refers to a non-@xmath46-jet and @xmath61 ) .",
    "however , as compared to that analysis , we make one simplification .",
    "namely , we assume that _ one _ top ( anti)quark and the @xmath3 boson generated in its decay have already been reconstructed , e.g. , by using the mass selection procedure advocated in ref .",
    "@xcite , either leptonically or hadronically .",
    "this allows us to greatly reduce the complexity of our numerical calculation while  we believe  substantially un - affecting the relative rates of signal and backgrounds ( in fact , all processes described produce the same final state and all involve at least one top quark ) .",
    "then we apply the following cuts on the remaining particles ( here , the label @xmath85 refers to the decay products of the second @xmath3 boson present in the event , which can be either light - quarks or leptons ) : @xmath86 on the transverse momentum ( including the missing one ) , @xmath87 on the pseudorapidity , and @xmath88 on the relative separation of @xmath46- and light - quark jets / leptons j , where @xmath89 is defined in terms of relative differences in pseudorapidity @xmath90 and azimuth @xmath91 , with @xmath92 , j@xmath93 .",
    "furthermore , we impose ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite ) latexmath:[\\[\\label{mhcut }    @xmath46-jets , @xmath95 on the light - jet ( or lepton - neutrino ) pair ( recall that the @xmath3 can be off - shell ) , and , finally , @xmath96 around the top mass if three @xmath46 s are present in the event ( in addition to the one already used to reconstruct the top ( anti)quark ) . in such a case , one may assume that the charged higgs boson has predominantly been produced in the decay of a top ( anti)quark ( when @xmath97 ) .",
    "if instead only two appear , then one should conclude that the higgs has mainly been generated in a bremsstrahlung / fusion process ( because @xmath32 ) with a @xmath46-(anti)quark lost along the beam pipe .",
    "our @xmath38 production mechanism naturally allows one to emulate both dynamics in a gauge invariant fashion , including all interference effects . as already mentioned , however",
    ", we will assume a triple @xmath46-tagging , this implying an overall efficiency factor of @xmath98 multiplying our signal and background rates .",
    "( thus , the third @xmath46-jet in eq .",
    "( [ mtcut ] ) is actually non-@xmath46-tagged : it can be interpreted as the jet system satisfying neither eq .  ( [ mhcut ] ) nor eq.([mwcut ] ) . )",
    "we take @xmath99 , like in @xcite ( and assume 100% lepton identification efficiency ) .",
    "given the signal production rates before acceptance and selection cuts , it is clear that  for such an @xmath72  even at high collider luminosity ( i.e. , @xmath100 fb@xmath101 per annum ) , hopes of disentangling the charged higgs boson of the mssm in the @xmath37 decay channel are only confined to the very low @xmath6 region .",
    "we will thus restrict ourselves to study in the reminder of the paper @xmath6 values which are , e.g. , below seven .",
    "the total signal rates after the cuts ( [ pt])([mtcut ] ) have been applied can be found in fig .",
    "[ fig : final ] , for the choices @xmath102 and @xmath103 , as a function of @xmath25 . for reference",
    ", we illustrate the ` borderline ' case @xmath104 gev .",
    "( indeed , a lower @xmath2 value at @xmath105 is in contradiction with lep2 data , whereas higher masses induce a far too large suppression on br(@xmath106 ) : see fig .",
    "[ fig : brh ] . )",
    "the trends in the figure are the consequence of two effects . on the one hand , the production cross section of @xmath107 + c.c .",
    "is roughly proportional to @xmath108 , so that its maxima occur at very low or very high @xmath6 . on the other hand ,",
    "we have seen how the largest @xmath109 decay fraction is attained for @xmath110 . in the end ,",
    "the largest values for @xmath111 + c.c . are obtained for @xmath112 : see fig .",
    "[ fig : final ] .",
    "unfortunately , such a @xmath6 value is already excluded in the mssm from lep2 data @xcite .",
    "for the optimal remaining choice , i.e. , @xmath105 , the annual rate never exceeds 140 events ( before any @xmath46-tagging efficiency but after acceptance and selection cuts ) .",
    "the maximum occurs at @xmath10 gev , significantly above the real threshold at @xmath113 gev .",
    "we now compare such a signal with the irreducible backgrounds 1.4 .",
    ", for the same choice of @xmath6 and @xmath2 ( where relevant ) .",
    "this is done in the upper half of fig .",
    "[ fig : last ] , at the level of total production rates . after the cuts ( [ pt])([mtcut ] ) are enforced ,",
    "all background components in 2.4 . are overwhelmed by the signal in the vicinity of @xmath114 gev , whereas the @xmath0 continuum production is always larger than the @xmath5 resonant channel .",
    "thus , it is relevant to compare the last two processes in the ` reconstructed ' invariant mass @xmath115 , i.e. , that obtained from pairing the two @xmath46-jets fulfilling condition ( [ mhcut ] ) and the two light - quark jets ( or , alternatively , the lepton - neutrino pair ) satisfying eq .",
    "( [ mwcut ] ) and not already reconstructing @xmath116 on their own and @xmath16 in association with any of the @xmath46 s ( see ref .",
    "the spectrum in this variable is presented in the lower half of fig .",
    "[ fig : last ] , for our ideal case @xmath114 gev ( and , again , @xmath105 and @xmath104 gev ) . for such mssm parameter combination ,",
    "the charged higgs signal is well above the continuum for values of @xmath115 which are @xmath117 gev from @xmath25 .",
    "( to vary @xmath25 and/or @xmath6 basically corresponds to rescale the solid line in the last plot by a constant factor , according to the rates in fig .",

    "although very small , a @xmath121 signal is generally observable above the @xmath122 continuum for @xmath25 around @xmath123 gev .",
    "our numbers are roughly consistent with those in ref .",
    "@xcite , if one considers that we neglect the finite efficiency of reconstructing one @xmath3 boson and the associated top ( anti)quark and since we have chosen somewhat different cuts .",
    "therefore , in the end , the dominant backgrounds remain ( in the @xmath7-tagged channel ) the @xmath124 + c.c .",
    "decay and the qcd noise involving misidentified gluons , i.e. , those already identified in ref .  @xcite .",
    "in summary , in this paper , we have complemented a previous analysis @xcite of the production and decay of charged higgs bosons of the mssm at the lhc , in the channels @xmath107 and @xmath109 ( and charged conjugated modes ) , respectively , by considering several irreducible backgrounds in the @xmath7-tagged channel , i.e. , @xmath125 + c.c .",
    "@xmath126 + ` missing energy ' ( where the initial @xmath46-(anti)quark is usually lost along the beam pipe ) , which had not yet been considered .",
    "we have found that , after standard acceptance cuts and a kinematic selection along the lines of the one outlined in ref .",
    "@xcite , the dominant background among those considered here is the continuum production @xmath127 + c.c .",
    "however , the latter has been found to lie significantly below the signal in the only region where this is detectable : when @xmath128 and @xmath129 gev ( with @xmath2 around 100 gev , close to the latest lep2 constraints )",
    ". thus , the chances of detecting the @xmath130 decay in such a ( narrow ) region of the mssm parameter space depend mainly on the interplay between this mode , the competing one @xmath131 and the qcd background with mistagged gluons , as are the latter two that clearly overwhelm the former ( recall the last figure in @xcite ) .",
    "we have carried out our analysis at parton level , without showering and hadronisation effects but emulating typical detector smearing .",
    "we are confident that its salient features should survive a more sophisticated simulation , such as the one presented in ref .",
    "besides , our results concerning the backgrounds can be transposed to the case of non - minimal susy models ( where the @xmath13 discovery potential can extend to a much larger portion of parameter space ) , such as those considered in ref .",
