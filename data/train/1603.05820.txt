    "for example , the system with @xmath0 symmetric periodic structures can act as unidirectional invisible media@xcite , edge states having complex eigenenergy emerge@xcite , bloch oscillations with unique features occur@xcite , and others@xcite .",

    "it has been also demonstrated that coupled microcavity resonators realize @xmath0 symmetric systems@xcite .",
    "recently , the mode - selective lasing by utilizing @xmath0 symmetry has been realized based on microring resonators@xcite . however , due to difficulty to handle gain and loss effects , the experimental systems are limited to a small number of elements .",
    "in contrast , there is a unique way to experimentally perform large scale @xmath0 symmetric systems with high tunability , that is , the discrete - time quantum walk@xcite . the discrete - time quantum walk ( quantum walk , in short )",
    "is the model recently attracting attention as versatile platforms for quantum computations and quantum simulators .",
    "the quantum walk describes quantum dynamics of particles by a time - evolution operator , instead of a hamiltonian .",
