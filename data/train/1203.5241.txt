    "dirac tachyons with nonlinear self - interaction were also considered @xcite . however",
    "a system of many interacting tachyons has not been discussed yet .    in the present paper",
    "we consider the tachyonic lagrangian @xmath17 that includes interaction with scalar field @xmath18 , pseudoscalar field @xmath19 , massive vector field @xmath20 ( relevant maxwell tensor is @xmath21 ) and massive electromagnetic field @xmath14",

    "each interaction vertex in ( [ la ] ) is taken in the form of yukawa minimal coupling while the coupling constants are included in the fields for simplicity .",
    "our interest concerns the single - particle energy spectrum and a the thermodynamical functions of many tachyon system in the frames of the mean - field approach .",
    "the interaction may result in a field condensate with non - zero vacuum expectation value responsible for qualitatively new properties in contrast to a free tachyon fermi gas .",
    "starting with the lagrangian ( [ la ] ) , we write the equation of motion for the dirac tachyon @xmath23 and klein - gordon equations @xmath24",

    "switching off all interactions , we obtain from ( [ ea ] ) the energy spectrum of a free tachyon ( [ tah ] ) .    taking into account the properties of the dirac matrices @xmath31 and operator @xmath32",
    ", we find that the energy spectrum ( [ ea ] ) at @xmath33 is reduced to @xmath34 ^2-m_{*}^2}-ea_0=\\sqrt{\\left ( \\vec p - e\\vec a\\right ) ^2-e\\vec \\sigma \\cdot \\mathrm{rot}\\vec a - m_{*}^2}-ea_0   \\label{el}\\ ] ] where the coupling constant @xmath35 is written explicitly so that expression ( [ el ] ) is looking like well known energy spectrum in electrodynamics and nuclear physics @xcite where potential @xmath14  is acting as an ordinary electromagnetic or vector - meson filed , while the scalar field @xmath18 and pseudoscalar field @xmath19 are responsible for the effective mass [ em ] .",
    "when the vector field @xmath36 is switched on , an absolutely different tachyonic energy spectrum is obtained : @xmath37 here we omit for simplicity all other fields ( @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath14 ) and write the coupling constant @xmath38 explicitly .",
    "there is not only dependence on the spin ( note that @xmath39 is acting as a regular magnetic field applied to an ordinary non - tachyon particle ) there is also explicit dependence on the helicty of the particle .    for uniform electro - static potential @xmath40 ( and @xmath41 ) formula ( [ ew ] )",

    "the tachyonic equation of motion ( [ dir ] ) results in the continuity equation @xmath55 for the axial current @xmath56 that corresponds to the conserved axial charge @xmath57 , while the vector current @xmath58 is not conserved because @xcite @xmath59 .",
    "hence , the axial charge is incorporated in the partition function ( [ z ] ) rather than the number of particles ( which is not conserved ) .",
    "thus , the tachyonic pressure @xmath60 the energy density @xmath61 and the entropy density @xmath62 include the axial charge density @xmath63 rather than ordinary particle number density .",
    "let us apply the mean field approximation @xcite , neglecting quantum field fluctuations .",
    "the tachyons are taken to move independently in the presence of constant mean fields @xmath64 , @xmath65 , @xmath66 and @xmath67 which themselves are generated self - consistently according to equations ( [ ss])-([aa ] ) , namely : @xmath68",

    "let us consider tachyons with pure vector and pseudovector interaction @xmath0 and @xmath87 .",
    "for a rotational symmetric uniform matter we take @xmath88 , @xmath89 and @xmath90 so that equations ( [ aa1 ] ) and ( [ oo1 ] ) yield @xmath91 @xmath92 where , again , the coupling constants @xmath38 and @xmath35 are written explicitely , and @xmath93 is the axial charge density , while @xmath94 is the particle number density ( and the coupling constants @xmath38 and @xmath35 are written explicitly ) .    thus , the vector and pseudovector fields acquires finite condensed values @xmath95 and @xmath96 which depends on @xmath97 .",
    "substituting @xmath98 ( [ o1 ] ) in ( [ ew ] ) we find the mean - field energy spectrum of tachyons @xmath99 defining effective single - particle energy @xmath100 together with effective chemical potential @xmath101 and taking into account that the distribution function ( [ f ] ) can be presented in the form @xmath102 + 1 }   \\label{ffff}\\ ] ] we calculate the pressure ( [ pp ] ) and energy density ( [ ee ] ) so    @xmath103    @xmath104 -\\frac 12\\frac{g^2n^2}{m^2}% + \\frac 12\\frac{e^2n_5 ^ 2}{m_a^2 }   \\label{ee9}\\ ] ]    where @xmath105 is the energy density of free particles with energy spectrum @xmath106 ( [ o33a ] ) and chemical potential ( [ o33b ] ) .",
    "the single - particle energy ( [ o33a ] ) is given in fig.[fv1 ] for right - handed and left - handed tachyons .",
    "the single - particle energy ( [ o33a ] ) of right - handed tachyons ( @xmath43 ) is always real at any @xmath45 when @xmath107 while the single - particle energy of left - handed tachyons ( @xmath44 ) is always real at any @xmath45 when @xmath108 thus , the pressure ( [ pp ] ) , ( [ pp9 ] ) and energy density ( [ ee ] ) , ( [ ee9 ] ) acquire no imaginary content if the particle number density exceeds critical threshold @xmath109 ( [ o4 ] ) or @xmath110 ( [ o5 ] ) .",
    "the group velocity @xmath111 associated with energy - spectrum ( [ o33a ] ) , is subluminal for both right - handed and left - handed tachyons when inequality ( [ o5 ] ) is satisfied .",
    "this group velocity is plotted in fig.[fv2 ] .",
    "the limit @xmath112 the energy spectrum ( ) is @xmath113 and the group velocity ( ) is helicity dependendt @xmath114 and it is given in fig .",
    "3 and fig .",
    "4 . results in the mass generation .",
    "the energy dispersion relation ( [ ea ] ) of a tachyon coupled to the scalar , pseudoscalar , vector and pseudovector ( electromagnetic ) fields reveal the nature of interaction .",
    "the scalar and pseudoscalar potentials field contribute to the only effective mass ( [ em ] ) .",
    "the potential is acting as a regular electromagnetic field on the ordinary dirac particle .",
    "the most interesting behavior belongs to the vector field , whose sole action results in very peculiar energy spectrum ( [ ew ] ) including dependence not only on the spin but also on the helicity of the tachyon .",
    "working in the frames of mean - field approximation , we find that the single - particle energy ( [ o33 ] ) , ( fig .  [ fv1 ] ) is real under conditions ( [ o4])-([o5 ] ) that imply that the pressure ( [ pp9 ] ) and energy density ( [ ee9 ] ) are also real like that of an ordinary fermi gas .",
    "this means that interaction results in stabilization of the tachyon matter , and weak coupling ( @xmath115 ) can provide stability to the dense matter , while strong coupling ( @xmath116 ) is enough for stabilization of rarefied matter .",
    "it should be also noted that the group velocity ( [ o6 ] ) becomes subluminal in dense tachyon fermi gas , see fig.[fv2 ] , although right - handed and left - handed tachyons reveal very different behavior : for example , left handed tachyons may have negative group velocity like the optical tachyons in nonlinear medium @xcite , and subluminal right - handed tachyons are faster than left - handed tachyons at the same momentum .",
    "the present analysis may give further ideas for solving applied problems .",
    "for example , we have all necessary theoretical background ( [ bi])-([ea ] ) , ( [ z ] ) to consider superconductivity of interacting tachyon fermi system and find the relevant excitation spectrum .",
    "it should be emphasized that conditions ( [ o4])-([o5 ] ) do not warrant automatically the causality condition @xcite , which may impose further requirements to the particle number density . according to ( [ ee9 ] ) the vector and pseudovector ( electromagnetic ) interaction",
    "bring different repulsive - attractive effects to the many - particle system , and formulas ( [ pp])-([f ] ) , ( [ o33])-([e9 ] ) are can be applied to calculation of the binding energy of tachyon matter and finding the point of gas - liquid phase transition .",
    "solving such problems , one should be careful with expression of the fermi momentum , bearing in mind the important fact that formulas ( [ o33])-([o6 ] ) are written with the particle number density @xmath117 , while the partition function of a free tachyon fermi gas must include the axial charge density @xmath118 .",
