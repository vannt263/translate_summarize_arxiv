    "a strong , coherent coupling between a superconducting qubit and an electrical resonator was first realized experimentally by wallraff _",
    "et al . _ and chiorescu _ et al .",
    "their work stimulated substantial theoretical @xcite and experimental activities @xcite devoted to the study of further quantum electrodynamic effects in electric circuits . in these `` circuit qed '' setups a superconducting qubit plays the role of an artificial atom , while the radiation field is replaced by the modes of an electric resonator .",
    "in some of these experiments a strong enhancement of the resonator field and lasing were observed @xcite .    in contrast to conventional lasers where",
    "many atoms are coupled weakly to the light field in an optical interferometer , in the single - qubit laser a single superconducting qubit is coupled strongly to the microwave field of the resonator circuit . furthermore , typical circuit qed setups operate at low temperatures , where thermal noise is weak and quantum fluctuations , arising from the qubit - resonator coupling , become dominant @xcite .    in this work",
    "we study the lasing transition and the spectral properties of single - qubit lasers focusing on the regime of strong qubit - resonator coupling at low temperatures . in this regime",
    "we find qualitatively new behavior of the laser linewidth . in earlier work",
    "@xcite we observed that the linewidth depends in a non - monotonous way on the coupling strength : approaching the lasing transition from weak coupling one observes the well - known linewidth narrowing .",
    "however , for stronger coupling the linewidth of the single - qubit laser increases again , and the lasing state deteriorates , a behavior not observed in conventional lasers .",
    "if the qubit and the laser are detuned from resonance we find an even more surprising behavior : the linewidth , which generally increases with detuning , is strongly enhanced near the lasing transition , and for strong coupling or low damping rate of the resonator shows a local maximum as a function of detuning .",
    "in this regime , the correlation functions of the resonator decay non - exponentially in time .",
    "as we demonstrate below , this behavior is due to the coupling between phase and amplitude fluctuations , which are neglected in the commonly used phase diffusion model @xcite .    in order to cover a wide range of parameters",
    "we analyze the properties of the laser using two approaches .",
    "one is based on a numerical analysis of the liouville equation in a basis of fock states .",
    "it allows for arbitrarily strong coupling but is limited by the size of the basis which we can handle .",
    "this puts constraints on the thermal photon number and the quality factor of the resonator .",
    "the other is based on the coherent - state representation .",
    "it covers large photon numbers ( and thus low damping rate of the resonator ) but fails in the strong coupling regime .",
