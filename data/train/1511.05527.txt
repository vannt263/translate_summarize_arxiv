    "time domain astronomy is widely held as one of the promising growth areas of astrophysics for the next decade . over the last decade , a number of time - domain , wide - area sky surveys with modern digital detectors have been implemented , such as the palomar transient factory survey ( ptf , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , lincoln near - earth asteroid research ( linear , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the catalina surveys @xcite , and kepler . in this context , the pan - starrs1 survey ( ps1 ) 3@xmath0 @xcite offers a unique combination of area , time sampling and depth .",
    "ps1 data have been extensively used to find and study transient sources , such as supernovae @xcite or episodic black hole accretion @xcite , focusing mostly on the many - epoch coverage in the medium - deep fields .",
    "it lends itself also to finding and characterizing sources of less ephemeral variability , and can do so across most of the sky .",
    "such sources of interest are , for example , qsos and variable stars , such as rr lyrae .",
    "ps1 is a multi - epoch survey that covered three quarters of the sky at typically 35 epochs between 2010 and the beginning of 2014 . yet , in any one of its five bands ( @xmath8 ) , it is only a few - epoch survey , and the observations in different bands are not taken simultaneously .",
    "though there are approaches for finding rr lyrae in ps1 based on their variability properties ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , there are no readily available approaches to exploit the full information content of the data , e.g. to find , identify , and characterize variable sources generically",
    ".    in this paper , we lay out , develop , test , and apply an approach to characterize variable sources in a survey such as ps1 .",
    "the basic approach should also be very relevant to the large synoptic survey telescope ( lsst ) , which will also collect non - simultaneous multi - band time - domain data .",
    "our methodology encompasses three basic steps : first , identifying sources that clearly vary ; second , characterizing their lightcurves with a multi - band structure function ; finally , using the identification of variable sources to train an automatic classifier .",
    "the last step is carried out using a random forest classifier that takes the classification available for the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) stripe 82 ( s82 ) @xcite to classify variable sources within ps1 3@xmath0 . throughout this analysis ,",
    "stripe 82 , which was fully observed by the ps1 survey , serves as a testbed for many aspects of the analysis .    in the classification analysis , we focus on two classes of astrophysical objects : qsos and rr lyrae .",
    "these objects have numerous applications .",
    "for example , the rr lyrae can act as tracers of the milky way s stellar outskirts @xcite with high distance precision .",
    "variability of qsos is astrophysically interesting for a variety of reasons @xcite , but qso candidates may also serve as reference sources for calibrating the astrometry of sources near the galactic plane .",
    "there are many other classes of variables ( e.g. cepheids and other pulsating variables ) for which ps1 forms an attractive data base ; but we do not attempt an exhaustive variable classification in this paper .    this paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : data ] , we provide a brief description of the ps1 survey , and the time - sampling of its 3@xmath0 sub - survey .",
    "we also describe complementary wise data that prove important for qso / rr lyrae discrimination , as well as the existing qso and rr lyrae classification in sdss s82 , which is central for training a random forest classifier . in section [ sec",
    ": methodology ] , we describe the methodology that takes us from ps1 lightcurves to qso and rr lyrae candidates .",
    "we lay out the usage of statistical variability measures , describe the approach of structure functions and state how the classification available for sdss stripe 82 helps us in classifying variable objects in ps1 3@xmath0 . in section [ sec : results ] we demonstrate , relying on stripe 82 data as ground truth , how well the identification and classification of variables with ps1 data works .",
    "in particular , we quantify the purity and completeness of various qso and rr lyrae samples , as well as discuss results in areas other than stripe 82 , e.g. the galactic anticenter .",
    "finally , we provide and describe a catalog of qso and rr lyrae candidates across three quarters of the sky .",
    "we discuss our results and present conclusions in section [ sec : discussionandconclusion ] .",
    "our approach for calculating variability measures and using them to detect and classify variable sources is based on ps1 3@xmath0 data , supported by time - averaged photometry from the wide - field infrared survey explorer ( wise ) survey , and sources from sdss s82 as ground truth . in this section ,",
    "we describe the pertinent properties of these surveys . from ps1 3@xmath0 ,",
    "we use the derived variability measures as well as mean magnitudes and colors for classification .",
    "pan - starrs is a wide - field optical / near - ir survey telescope system located at haleakala observatory on the island of maui in hawaii .",
    "the ps1 survey @xcite is collecting multi - epoch , multi - color observations undertaking a number of surveys , among which the ps1 3@xmath0 survey @xcite is the largest .",
    "it has observed the entire sky north of declination @xmath9 in five filter bands ( @xmath8 ) with average wavelengths of 481 , 617 , 752 , 866 , and 962 nm , respectively @xcite with a 5@xmath10 single epoch depth of about 22.0 , 22.0 , 21.9 , 21.0 and 19.8 magnitudes in @xmath11 , respectively .",
    "in contrast to the sdss filters , the @xmath12 filter extends 20 nm redwards of @xmath13 , and the @xmath14 filter reaches only to 920 nm .",
    "ps1 has no @xmath15 band . in the near - ir",
    ", @xmath16 covers the region from 920 nm to 1030 nm .",
    "more detailed descriptions of these filters and their calibration can be found in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "roughly 56% of the ps1 telescope observing time was dedicated to the ps1 3@xmath0 survey , with an observing cadence optimized for the detection of near - earth asteroids and slow - moving solar system bodies .",
    "the ps1 3@xmath0 survey plan is to observe each position 4 times per filter per year , where the epochs are typically split into two pairs of exposures per year per band ( transit - time - interval ( tti ) pairs ) taken @xmath1725 minutes apart in the same band .",
    "this allows for the discovery of moving or variable sources .",
    "the sky north of declination @xmath9 was planned to be observed 4 times in each band pass per year @xcite . through periods of bad weather and telescope downtime in practice ,",
    "fewer epochs were observed .",
    "images are automatically processed using the survey pipeline @xcite , performing bias subtraction , flat fielding , astrometry , photometry , as well as image stacking and differencing .",
    "the photometric calibration of the survey is better than one hundredth of a magnitude @xcite .",
    "all data processing shown here is carried out under ps1 catalog processing version pv2 , where the average number of total detections per source is 55 over 3.7 years , including some data taken in non - photometric conditions .",
    "we perform a number of cuts on the ps1 data to remove outliers and unreliable data .",
    "these cuts fall into two categories : _ detection _ cuts that remove individual detections , and _ object _ cuts that remove all detections of a source from the analysis .",
    "the most important detection cut we apply is to remove data taken in non - photometric conditions , according to @xcite , and data from any orthogonal transfer array ( ota ) where the detections of bright stars on that chip are on average over 0.02 mag too faint .",
    "these cuts remove about 30% of detections .",
    "the second most important detection cut we apply is to remove observations which land on bad parts of the detector , as indicated by having ` psf_qf_perfect ` @xmath18 0.95 .",
    "this removes about 10% of detections .",
    "similarly importantly , we exclude any observation where the psf magnitude is inconsistent with the aperture magnitude by more than 0.1 mag or four times the estimated uncertainties , removing 10% of detections .",
    "we remove any detections with problematic conditions noted by the ps1 pipeline , according to the detections flags . for the cleaning flags used , see table [ tab : cleaningflags ] and",
    "also @xcite .",
    "this eliminates only about 2% of detections .",
    "finally , we apply an outlier cleaning based on the @xmath19-score of the individual measurements @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is a given magnitude measurement , @xmath22 is its uncertainty , and @xmath23 is the error - weighted mean magnitude of all measurements of that source in its band @xmath24 .",
    "this eliminates 2% of detections , and we limit it to eliminate at most 10% of the detections of any individual source .    fig .",
    "[ fig : ps1dataproperties ] gives the number of epochs , as well as their cadence , in each band after all of these cuts have been applied .",
    "the average number of surviving epochs per source is 35 rather than the total 55 observations .",
    "the detection cuts we make are summarized in table  [ tab : obsoutliercleaning ] .",
    "we note that if a detection has one problematic condition , it is more likely than otherwise to also be affected by other problematic conditions .",
    "we also exclude all detections of some objects from consideration . to ensure that we consider only objects with enough epochs and high enough signal to noise to be appropriate for variability studies , we select only objects having    @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the error - weighted mean magnitude after applying detection cuts    at least 10 epochs remaining after after applying detection cuts    we have imposed two additional criteria to remove extended objects , as well as objects thought to have problematic ps1 detections :    fewer than 25% of epochs eliminated by ` psf_qf_perfect`@xmath270.95    fewer than 25% of epochs eliminated by @xmath28`ap_mag ` - ` psf_inst_mag`@xmath29 max(@xmath30 , 0.1 ) .    among sources within a magnitude range of 15 to 21.5 , these two criteria each remove about @xmath31 of objects .",
    "this was significantly more than expected .",
    "however , visual inspection of a selection of affected sources indicates that these cuts were unnecessarily restrictive .",
    "these sources could have in fact been included in the analysis without difficulty , but for now we accept the loss .",
    "we term this loss a `` selection loss '' , and note that it means that our catalogs ( qsos , rr lyrae , and variable objects in general ) will be missing 10% of all objects .",
    "more than @xmath32 objects across three quarters of the sky survive these cuts , and we analyze the variability of all of them .",

    "[ fig : flowchart ] illustrates the logical flow of the methodology that is detailed in the following subsections .",
    "we start by laying out a very generic and non - parameteric measure for variability , simply to characterize the significance of variability by a scalar quantity .",
    "specifically , we define @xmath51 with @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the total number of photometric points for one object across all @xmath54 bands , the sum over @xmath55 is over the ps1 bands @xmath56,@xmath57,@xmath58,@xmath59,@xmath60 , and @xmath61 is the number of degrees of freedom.assuming that most of the sources are not variable , we expect the distribution of @xmath62 to be a unit gaussian distribution .",
    "in contrast , varying sources should form a `` tail '' of higher @xmath62 .",
    "figure [ fig : chihatdistribution ] shows the normalized distribution of @xmath62 , derived from the ps1 photometry of all selected objects in s82 , with known qsos ( blue ) and known rr lyrae ( red ) shown in separate ( normalized ) distributions .",
    "the `` other '' objects have a @xmath62-distribution close to that expected for non - varying sources ( dashed line ) , confirming that most sources in the sky are non - varying ( within a level of less than a few percent ) and that the ps1 photometry is reliable .",
    "the qsos and rr lyrae appear well separated in the _ normalized _ distibutions .",
    "however , there are only 415 rr lyrae and 7630 qso , compared to @xmath63 `` other '' objects in sdss s82 cross - matched to ps1 and surviving the cuts of sec .",
    "[ sec : objectselectionandoutliercleaning ] .",
    "[ fig : chihatdistribution ] ( b ) shows how the distribution of  other \" sources superimposes the distribution of qsos and rr lyrae due to the high number of  other \" sources .",
    "therefore , a simple criterion such as @xmath62 is insufficient to identify qsos or rr lyrae . in the subsequent analysis ,",
    "all objects are used , though for rr lyrae only , one could in principle restrict oneself to objects with @xmath64 without losing completeness .      beyond simply establishing variability ,",
    "variable sources can and should be characterized by the amplitude of their variability and the timescales over which they vary .",
    "a useful and well - established tool for this is the structure function @xcite : it gives the mean squared magnitude difference ( in a given band ) between pairs of observations of some object s brightness ( @xmath65 ) as a function of the time lag between the observations ( @xmath66 ) .",
    "there are various ways to parameterize such a structure function , and the damped random walk ( drw ) is a useful function family . for a drw ,",
    "the structure function is specified by two parameters , @xmath67 and @xmath68 , and is given by    @xmath69    in this notation @xmath70 reflects the expectation value for the squared magnitude difference , @xmath71 , among measurements separated in time by @xmath66 ; @xmath70 is simply @xmath72 times the expected magnitude variance during @xmath66 .",
    "@xmath68 is conventionally denoted as @xmath73 , and @xmath67 is called the decorrelation time of the drw . the source variability",
    "is then characterized by two structure function parameters , @xmath74 and @xmath67 .",
    "objects of different classes typically occupy different regions in structure function parameter space .",
    "as we show below , the likelihood @xmath75 can be used to select remarkably pure and complete samples of qsos as well as rr lyrae , which makes selection by structure function parameters an efficient approach for both selecting stochastically varying and periodic variable objects @xcite .",
    "the cadence of surveys like the sdss provides data that allows application of the usual single - band formulation of structure functions .",
    "however , the cadence of ps1 3@xmath0 data , which observes in different bands at different epochs ( see sec .",
    "[ sec : data ] ) , makes it necessary to extend this approach for multi - band fitting .",
    "we need a practical approach to turn the @xmath76 epoch ps1 light curves in each band into a @xmath77 epoch overall light curve .",
    "if objects were to vary the same way in all observed bands , implementing such an approach would simply amount to determining the ( time - averaged ) mean color of the object and shifting the light curves in the different bands to a common magnitude .",
    "however , in practice , most astrophysical objects vary more at shorter wavelengths . to account for this , the multi - band model we present here has , beyond @xmath74 and @xmath67 , a set of temporal mean magnitude parameters in each ps1 band , @xmath78 , and it links the variability _ amplitudes _ @xmath79 in different bands @xmath80 by a power law with exponent @xmath81 . specifically , @xmath82 where @xmath83 is the effective wavelength of the band @xmath80 .    to assign a likelihood to an object s photometry , given a structure function model , we make use of a gaussian process formulation for stochastic source variability .",
    "in contrast to single - band structure function models ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the gaussian process is not applied to any particular band but instead to an arbitrarily constructed fiducial band which can be scaled and shifted onto the particular bands .",
    "this permits simultaneous treatment of multiple bands , even when the bands are not observed simultaneously at the same epochs .",
    "it is key in this context to realize that the fiducial band is a latent variable ",
    "it is never directly observed ; only the scaled and shifted versions are observed , where substantial measurement noise is present .",
    "the fiducial light curve can be described with a zero - mean and unit characteristic variance gaussian process .",
    "that is , the prior probability distribution function ( pdf ) for a set of @xmath53 fiducial `` magnitudes '' @xmath84 that are instantiated at observed times @xmath85 is a multivariate normal distribution : @xmath86 where @xmath87 is a @xmath88 symmetric positive definite covariance matrix . in the case of a drw model , @xmath87",

    "this factor reappears in our multi - band structure function through the scale factors that link the fiducial band to observed bands .",
    "we consider now a given source for which we have @xmath53 observations across @xmath92 different bands .",
    "the data consist of the magnitude and uncertainty vectors @xmath93 and @xmath94 , the times of observation @xmath85 , and the corresponding bands @xmath95 .",

    "our method of automatic source classification is subject to several limitations .",
    "the most important of these are :    mismatch between our ground - truth training set and other regions of sky ,    incompleteness of the training set , and    the inhomogeneity of the available data over the sky .",
    "we address these limitations in the following subsection .",
    "we train our classifier using data on sdss s82 , where existing large catalogs of rr lyrae and qsos provide an almost complete sample of objects in the region .",
    "we wish to train the classifier on this region , but apply it to other regions , where no similar classifications already exist . in general , however , the application of the classifier to regions other than s82 is only justified when the region has distributions of rr lyrae , qsos , and potential contaminants similar to that in s82 . over most of the high latitude sky , this is the case , and we can apply our technique without difficulty .",
    "however , at low latitudes the number of contaminants is relatively much larger than the number of rr lyrae and qsos in s82 , since in these regions the data include very large numbers of metal rich disk stars .",
    "additionally , the data is itself qualitatively different : the presence of reddening changes the colors of sources , and variation in reddening as a function of distance means that even with a perfect 2d reddening map , dereddened colors may no longer match the true colors of objects .",
    "accordingly , at low latitudes we do not expect our classifier to perform with the same purity and completeness as at high latitudes , and our s82-based estimates of purity and completeness will no longer apply .",
    "the second problem with our technique is that even in high latitude regions , our adopted training set is imperfect .",
    "this is especially the case for our adopted qso training set .",
    "we use spectroscopically selected qsos from @xcite , which are complete only down to roughly an @xmath188-band magnitude limit of 21.25 .",
    "therefore , in our training set , fainter objects are marked as non - qsos , and our classifier learns to discard these objects  even when they are , in fact , qsos , as indicated by their wise @xmath152 color and variability .",
    "this results in a quasar sample from our technique whose purity and completeness is really only relative to s82 spectroscopic quasars , rather than the underlying population of qsos falling in our magnitude range .",
    "we expect that our training set is more complete for rr lyrae , though the very small number of distant rr lyrae ( figure [ fig : rrlyrae_completeness_purity_rbandmag ] ) means that we would run the risk there of discarding all distant objects as well , were it not for the fact that we do not include the @xmath189-band magnitude as a parameter when classifying rr lyrae ( table [ tab : rfcparameters ] ) .",
    "a final concern with our technique is that our ability to determine if an object is in fact a qso or rr lyrae depends on what information is available for it .",
    "the purities and completenesses we compute are properties of the entire sample of selected objects .",
    "the assignment to classes of individual objects within that sample may be relatively uncertain , if , for instance , those objects lack specific ps1 colors or detections in wise .",
    "figure [ fig : spread_puritycompleteness ] serves to show what may happen to the purity and completeness of subsamples of objects , for which only limited information is available .",
    "we then applied this variability characterization and subsequent random forest classification to all sources in ps1 3@xmath0 , with the selection criteria discussed in section [ sec : objectselectionandoutliercleaning ] , resulting in a total of more than @xmath32 classified sources .",
    "[ fig : healpix_map ] shows the all - sky projection of source density within the cuts from sec .",

    "as we consider qsos , but also rr lyrae , at low galactic latitudes , a number of effects in the candidate selection are likely to become important : first dust extinction at low latitudes will push faint sources below the detection limit ; imperfect dereddening may lead to differing de - reddened colors ; and the training set , s82 , is mostly at high galactic latitudes with low dust , leaving the classifier imperfectly prepared for very high level of galactic disk star contaminants .",

    "for both qsos and rr lyrae stars these samples of candidates constitute by far the largest sets of high - quality candidates , both in terms of imaging depth , sky area and consequently sample size , e.g. compared to @xcite , who found a qso purity of 48% and completeness of 67% for ps1-sdss data .",

    "until dust extinction and disk star contamination become severe , we may still get an approximately uniform density of objects with high @xmath155 .",

    "we have not only carried out classification with the full available parameter set using variability parameters and colors from ps1 together with wise colors , but also with more restricted pieces of information , using only color - related and only variability - related parameters .",
    "for rr lyrae , the variability information is absolutely indispensible to define a sample with an interesting combination of purity and completeness .    for qsos , ( time - averaged )",
    "ps1 color together with wise already do a good job in selecting qsos , so ps1 variability provides a significant , but not decisive improvement of purity and completeness . on the other hand , this means , that the variability information together with optical color can help for qso identification when no other information is available .",
    "as the treatment of reddening is limited right now , care must be taken applying any values of purity and completeness to regions of high reddenings .",
    "one important limitation of our classification is that it relies on sdss stripe 82 ; while this area covers a wide range in galactic latitude , @xmath256 , we have no training in the galactic plane . while the number of very likely candidates , @xmath257 drops near the galactic plane , the number of plausible candidates @xmath258 does not .",

    "based on the training in s82 , we expect a purity ( based on s82 ) of 71% , and completeness of 98% among cross - matched sources ; 10% of the sources will be missing because of the selection loss ( see sec . [",

    "the s82 training would make us believe that this should boost the purity to 75% with only a slightly lower completeness of 92% .",
    "the fact that nearly 100,000 candidates fall out of the sample between the two cuts of ( @xmath209 and @xmath185 ) shows that the purity in the @xmath209 sample must be overestimated .",
    "this is most likely because there is not only dust , but also higher , and unmodelled , contamination in the galactic plane .    with this caveat on the low - latitude sample purity ,",
    "the spatial distribution of rr lyrae candidates is as follows : within @xmath263 , i.e. near the disk , we find 187,393 possible rr lyrae candidates with @xmath209 and 110,477 rr lyrae candidates with @xmath185 . of them ,",

    "<S> in area and depth , the pan - starrs1 ( ps1 ) 3@xmath0 survey is unique among many - epoch , multi - band surveys and has enormous potential for all - sky identification of variable sources . </S>",
    "<S> ps1 has observed the sky typically seven times in each of its five bands ( @xmath1 ) over 3.5 years , but unlike sdss not simultaneously across the bands . </S>",
    "<S> here we develop a new approach for quantifying statistical properties of non - simultaneous , sparse , multi - color lightcurves through light - curve structure functions , effectively turning ps1 into a @xmath2-epoch survey . </S>",
    "<S> we use this approach to estimate variability amplitudes and timescales @xmath3 for all point - sources brighter than @xmath4 mag in the survey . with ps1 data on sdss stripe 82 as  ground truth \" , we use a random forest classifier to identify qsos and rr lyrae based on their variability and their mean ps1 and wise colors . </S>",
    "<S> we find that , aside from the galactic plane , qso and rr lyrae samples of purity @xmath575% and completeness @xmath592% can be selected . on this basis </S>",
    "<S> we have identified a sample of @xmath6 qso candidates , as well as an unprecedentedly large and deep sample of @xmath5150,000 rr lyrae candidates with distances from @xmath510 kpc to @xmath5120 kpc . within the draco dwarf spheroidal , we demonstrate a distance precision of 6% for rr lyrae candidates . </S>",
    "<S> we provide a catalog of all likely variable point sources and likely qsos in ps1 , a total of @xmath7 sources . </S>"
