    "light quarks in ads / cft can be modeled by strings with one endpoint ending on a d7-brane in the bulk of @xmath1 .",
    "a possible way to model a light quark - anti quark pair that has undergone a hard scattering is by considering an initially pointlike open string created close to the boundary with endpoints that are free to fly apart and fall towards the black hole , the so - called `` falling '' strings @xcite .",
    "it was found @xcite that the maximum distance such an energetic quark can travel for a fixed energy @xmath2 in a thermal @xmath3 sym plasma at a temperature @xmath4 scales as @xmath5 , where the constant of proportionality is important for phenomenological applications as it determines the overall strength of jet quenching .    in order to use this model and compute the observables such as the nuclear modification factor @xmath0",
    ", one needs to know the details of how these light quarks lose energy .",
    "the application of a general formula for energy loss in non - stationary string configurations @xcite to the case of fallings strings has shown a seemingly linear path dependence in the phenomenologically relevant range .",
    "simple constructions of @xmath0 @xcite resulted in a serious under - prediction of the lhc pion suppression data ( although it had the right qualitative structure ) , even with the inclusion of the higher derivative corrections to the @xmath1 , indicating that the predicted jet quenching was too strong .",
    "a possible resolution of this problem was recently offered by considering strings that have finite momentum at their endpoints @xcite , as the stopping distance of light quarks dual to these strings is greater than in the previous treatments of the falling strings , and hence may offer a better match with the experimental data .",
    "furthermore , these strings provide a more natural holographic dual of dressed energetic quarks , as one can think of the finite momentum endpoints representing quarks themselves and the string between them the color field they generate . in this way",
    ", one also obtains a clear distinction between the energy in the hard probe and energy contained in the color fields surrounding it , thus offering a precise definition of the instantaneous jet energy loss that was missing in earlier accounts .",
    "endpoints with finite momenta move along null geodesics in @xmath1-schwarzschild and the evolution of their momenta is governed by equations that do not depend on the bulk shape of the string , only on the radial position of the endpoint @xcite : @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the t hooft coupling , @xmath8 ( the boundary is at @xmath9 ) , @xmath10 and @xmath11 is the minimal ( inverse ) radial coordinate the geodesic reaches and which hence completely determines the motion of the endpoint . as mentioned before , the finite endpoint momentum provides a very natural definition of the quark energy loss as precisely the rate ( [ eloss1 ] ) at which the energy gets drained from the endpoint .    for phenomenological purposes ,",
    "we need to express ( [ eloss1 ] ) as a function of @xmath12 , which means that we need to solve the null geodesic equation .",
    "if , initially , at @xmath13 , the endpoint is located at @xmath14 and is going towards the boundary , the solution to the geodesic equation has a strongly convergent expansion for small @xmath11 : @xmath15 \\,.}\\ ] ] this expansion is interesting for phenomenological reasons : we see that for small @xmath16 the energy loss ( [ eloss1 ] ) is large and therefore quarks dual to endpoints that move close to the boundary will be quenched quickly and wo nt be observable .",
    "this leads us to consider endpoints that start close to the horizon ( the `` shooting string '' limit ) , and the strong convergence of ( [ eloss3 ] ) for @xmath17 leads us to consider the simplest case of keeping only the first , @xmath11-independent term in the expansion .",
    "this yields a particularly interesting form of energy loss @xcite : @xmath18 where @xmath19 $ ] .",
    "various limits of this energy loss have interesting physical interpretations : at small @xmath12 , the energy loss looks like a pure @xmath20 energy loss , similar to the pqcd elastic energy loss ( with a running coupling ) ; for intermediate @xmath12 , it looks like @xmath21 with a path dependence similar to the pqcd radiative energy loss ; and , finally , for large @xmath12 , it has a novel @xmath22 behavior",
    ". this is an interesting ( and a very specific ) generalization of the simpler `` abc '' models of energy loss @xcite , where @xmath23 .",
    "a possible way to make our setup more realistic is to add higher derivative @xmath24-corrections to the gravity sector of @xmath1 , which are the leading @xmath25 corrections in the presence of a d7-brane .",
    "it has been shown @xcite that these types of corrections can affect the energy loss significantly and it will be important to explore their effect in the context of finite endpoint momentum strings .",
    "we will model the @xmath24-corrections by adding a gauss - bonnet term @xmath26 to the five - dimensional action . here",
    "@xmath27 is a dimensionless parameter , constrained by causality @xcite and positive - definiteness of the boundary energy density @xcite to be @xmath28 .",
    "a black hole solution in this case is known analytically @xcite and hence , using the same procedure as before , we can easily find the energy loss from the finite endpoint momentum in this geometry , solve for the null geodesics and obtain a formula similar to ( [ eloss4 ] ) @xcite : @xmath29 here we have employed a perturbative expansion in @xmath27 : functions @xmath30 and @xmath31 are functions of @xmath27 only and do not have a particularly illuminating explicit form , even for small @xmath32 . for @xmath27 as large as @xmath33 , by comparing to the all - order numerical result , it was found that it is enough to go to @xmath34 order in expansion .",
    "before using our proposed energy loss formulas ( [ eloss4 ] ) and ( [ gb10 ] ) to compute @xmath0 for pions at rhic and lhc , we will take several steps in order to phenomenologically imitate some of the features of qcd and hence allow for a more realistic computation .",
    "first , we will account for roughly three times more degrees of freedom in @xmath3 sym than in qcd by relating the temperatures via @xcite @xmath35 and promote a constant @xmath36 to a glauber - like @xmath37 . to model the transverse expansion of the medium we will use a simple blast wave dilation factor @xcite @xmath38 , where @xmath39 is",
    "the mean nuclear radius and @xmath40 is the transverse velocity , and replace @xmath41 in the glauber model .",
    "finally , we use the fragmentation functions @xcite to obtain the pionic @xmath0 from the partonic one ( neglecting the gluon contribution ) .",
    "we use the standard optical glauber model to compute the participant and binary collisions densities , include the effects of longitudinal expansion and model the spacetime evolution of the temperature .",
    "the details of the @xmath0 calculation are given in @xcite and consist of finding the initial energy of a jet @xmath42 using the energy loss formulas ( [ eloss4 ] ) and ( [ gb10 ] ) , given its final energy @xmath43 , production point @xmath44 in the transverse plane and the angle @xmath45 in which it is moving . the nuclear modification factor is then given by a weighted transverse plane average of the ratio of the initial production spectra @xmath46 ( obtained from the lo pqcd cteq5 code @xcite ) at final and initial energies .",
    "our main results are shown in fig .",
    "[ mainfig ] , while the other results can be found in @xcite .",
    "qualitatively , our @xmath0 calculations match the data quite well and a good quantitative fit at rhic , with a reasonable choice of parameters and using ( [ eloss4 ] ) ( i.e. with no higher derivative corrections ) , is obtained by choosing @xmath47 ( blue curve ) . in the lhc case ,",
    "using the same parameters results in a curve ( also blue ) that is noticeably below the data ; this effect is often called the `` surprising transparency '' of the lhc @xcite , where the effects of temperature increase from rhic to lhc affect the @xmath0 much more than the competing increase of the production spectra .    0.3 in     a possible way to obtain a more satisfying fit",
    "to lhc is to include the higher derivative corrections via ( [ gb10 ] ) .",
    "a more phenomenological reason to use these corrections is that they offer a theoretically well defined way to change the shear viscosity , as , in the presence of the gauss - bonnet term , @xmath48 @xcite .",
    "choosing a maximally negative @xmath49 increases the viscosity to @xmath50 , which is , together with our value of the formation time @xmath51 fm / c , in the ballpark of the parameters used in some of the most recent hydrodynamic simulations for the lhc @xcite necessary to describe the elliptic flow data of light hadrons .",
    "this effect puts our curve for @xmath52 on top of the lhc data ( green curve ) , while , as expected , the rhic data is then over - predicted ( also green ) .",
    "however , in @xcite the initial time @xmath51 fm / c used at the lhc was bigger than at rhic where @xmath53 fm / c @xcite , based on the requirements of the hydrodynamic simulations to fit the low @xmath54 elliptic flow data . using such @xmath55 at rhic puts us on top of the data for @xmath56 ( dashed black curve ) , while the lhc curve ( red ) is still somewhat below the data .",
    "the reason why lowering the initial time @xmath55 had such a noticeable effect on @xmath0 was because our energy loss formulas ( [ eloss4 ] ) and ( [ gb10 ] ) have a strong sensitivity to the temperature and in the glauber model @xmath57 .",
    "more generally , this strong sensitivity means that a small change in the temperature , @xmath58 , has the same effect as a large change in the coupling , @xmath59 or @xmath60 .",
    "hence if there are any phenomenological uncertainties in the effective temperature , such that would allow the lhc temperature to be 10% lower ( @xmath61 ) than given by the simple ratio of the multiplicities , then we can fit the lhc data as well ( black dashed curve ) .",
    "the framework of finite endpoint momentum strings @xcite allows for a clear definition of the instantaneous energy loss of light quarks in a strongly coupled sym plasma , which is identified with the energy flux from the endpoint to the bulk of the string . using this definition in the case of endpoints that start close to the horizon ( `` shooting '' strings ) leads to a concise and phenomenologically interesting formula ( [ eloss4 ] ) @xcite .",
    "application of this formula , including the higher derivative @xmath24-corrections ( via ( [ gb10 ] ) ) , showed a good independent match with the rhic and lhc central @xmath0 data for light hadrons .",
    "while it is challenging to simultaneously fit both lhc and rhic data , the choice of @xmath62 and @xmath63 puts our predictions in the ballpark of data _ provided _ we include a @xmath64 reduction of temperature at the lhc relative to straightforward expectations based on multiplicities .",
    "further inclusion of fluctuations and non - conformal effects may provide a simultaneous fit with an even smaller temperature reduction .",
