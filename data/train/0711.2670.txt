    "short range antiferromagnetic correlations and anomalous slow dynamics have been observed at temperatures below 4k in znmgho , and below 5.8 k in znmgtb @xcite .",
    "these experiments raise the question of what types of magnetic ordering can exist in systems with quasiperiodic structural order .",
    "several theoretical studies of both classical @xcite and quantum @xcite models of interacting local moments in two dimensional quasiperiodic geometries have been carried out .",
    "these calculations show ground states characterized by a complex inhomogeneous magnetic order .",

    "we consider spins located on vertices of the penrose tiling , which was introduced @xcite as an example of a determistic nonperiodic structure and later found to be relevant for quasicrystals @xcite .",
    "the penrose tiling is the planar version of the three dimensional icosahedral tiling used in the description of a large number of quasicrystalline alloys . at t=0 , since there is no frustration in the model , one expects a nel ordered ground state , with equal and oppositely directed sublattice magnetizations .",
    "we will consider the case of @xmath0 , the case of greatest theoretical interest , as quantum effects are expected to be strongest .",
    "an interesting related problem concerns the entanglement properties of spins in such hierarchical environments , a question that is currently receiving attention in view of the applications to quantum computing .",
    "this paper follows an earlier brief report @xcite , where some early results were presented . in this paper",
    "we describe the method used in some detail , and we present a more complete description of the ground state properties , spin wave spectrum , magnon velocity , and eigenmodes .",
    "the numerical calculations are done within the linearized spin wave ( lsw ) approximation , using periodic approximants of the penrose tiling .",
    "we show as well that the magnetization results can be qualitatively explained in terms of a simple analytic model of tree clusters .",

    "a finite patch of the perfect penrose tiling.,width=302 ]      we consider the nearest - neighbor antiferromagnetic spin-@xmath1 heisenberg model , @xmath2 where @xmath3 are pairs of linked vertices of the penrose tiling .",
    "the antiferromagnetic coupling @xmath4 is taken to be the same for all bonds .",
    "the tiling is bipartite , in that sites belong to one of two sublattices a and b , and the @xmath4-terms couple a spin on sublattice a to spins lying on sublattice b and vice - versa .",
    "this property ensures that there is no frustration , i.e. , if one considers classical spin variables , the ground state is one for which all bonds are  satisfied \"  with all the a - sublattice spins pointing in one direction and b - sublattice spins pointing in the opposite direction .",
    "this is our reference state with long range staggered magnetic order for our calculations at @xmath5 using the spin wave approximation . at finite temperature",
    ", the long range order will be destroyed due to the mermin - wagner - hohenberg theorem @xcite , although short range correlations will persist .",
    "we now recall some properties of the ground state of some unfrustrated heisenberg antiferromagnets , shown in earlier studies .      when the spins are quantum variables , the energy of the ground state is lower than the classical value , due to quantum fluctuations or  spin waves \" in the case of periodic structures .",
    "as studies using a variety of analytical and numerical methods have shown ( see review @xcite ) , the effects of quantum fluctuations vary depending on the dimension , on the spin quantum number @xmath6 , and the type of structure .",
    "quantum fluctuations are expected to become smaller as @xmath6 increases , and as the dimension increases .",
    "it can be shown that , for hypercubic lattices , the spin wave expansion in fact is an expansion in @xmath7 , where @xmath8 .",
    "for @xmath9 and @xmath0 , as in the square lattice or the honeycomb lattice , it was an open question for some time whether quantum fluctuations would be strong enough to destroy long range order , until enough evidence @xcite was presented in favor of long range order .      in a given dimension , and for simple lattices , one can ask what the local quantum fluctuations are when the coordination number is changed . in two dimensions ,",
    "two examples of unfrustrated systems are the square lattice with @xmath10 and the honeycomb lattice with @xmath11 ( see the review in @xcite ) .",
    "spin wave calculations , as well as quantum monte carlo calculations @xcite have shown that the order parameter is smaller in the @xmath11 case .",
    "the values of the staggered magnetization , defined by the value of @xmath12 as obtained by qmc calculations are @xmath13 and @xmath14 ( with @xmath15 and @xmath16 standing for square lattice and honeycomb lattice respectively ) .",
    "this is in accord with the already remarked tendency towards a less classical behavior for systems of lower dimension , hence fewer nearest neighbors .",
    "in contrast , as pointed out in @xcite , when the coordination number is not constant , the local magnetization tends to be in fact larger when @xmath17 is smaller . in the dice lattice , where sites can have @xmath11 and @xmath18 , spin wave theory and qmc calculations have shown that it is the small @xmath17 sites that have the larger value of the local staggered magnetization , with @xmath19 while @xmath20 .",
    "this result shows the  counter - intuitive \" trend towards a @xmath21 classical behavior for sites of bigger @xmath17 in structures having a distribution of @xmath17 values .",
    "other systems showing this tendency include the quasiperiodic octagonal tiling and , as shown in @xcite , the penrose tiling .",
    "we now describe the penrose tiling , along with some of its properties . as shown in fig.[fig : tiling ] , which shows a finite portion of a perfect tiling , the tiles of this structure are a pair of rhombuses of angles @xmath22 ( thin rhombus ) and @xmath23 ( thick rhombus ) . the edge length will be taken to be @xmath24 .",
    "one remarkable feature is that despite the absence of perfect translational invariance , patterns of arbitrarily large size in different regions of the tiling can be made to overlap (  local isomorphism \" ) .",
    "the mean repetition distance of a pattern of linear size r is proportional to r , a property that replaces the strict translational invariance of crystalline structures .",
    "rotational invariance holds in the same  weak \" sense  for any given pattern , its equivalent under rotation by a multiple of @xmath25 can be found elsewhere on the tiling .",
    "the penrose tiling possesses a hierarchical symmetry , being invariant under so - called inflation and deflation transformations .",
    "inflation is a reversible operation which can be thought of as a set of decimations of vertices of the tiling , followed by a re - connection of the new vertices .",
    "the new tiling is defined on a length scale that is bigger by the factor @xmath26 ( the golden mean ) .",
    "the equivalence of the old and new tilings means here that no environments are created or destroyed in the process of inflation or deflation , and that one can find an exact match between any arbitrary ( finite ) regions of the two tilings .",
    "a rhombus - based structure such as the one shown in fig.[fig : tiling ] is a two - sublattice system . on the infinite tiling ,",
    "the two sublattices are equivalent , as regards the frequencies of the different vertices ( see subsection below ) .      as fig.[fig :",
    "starshapes ] shows , many kinds of vertices are present in the tiling . in this paper , we have chosen to classify properties of vertices according to their coordination number @xmath17 .",
    "these site coordination numbers range from 3 to 7 in the penrose tiling , with the average value @xmath27 being exactly 4 .",
    "the figure shows the seven local environments possible for coordination numbers @xmath28 and 3 .",
    "the first figure shows a five - fold symmetric site , which in fact comes in two varieties , the f ( for football cluster ) and the s ( for star cluster ) .",
    "the properties of these sites under decimation are different .",
    "more will be said on these sites when we discuss the results for the ground state staggered magnetization distribution .",
    "we note that in the infinite tiling , each of the sublattices a and b have the same distribution of vertices of each type .     local environments in the penrose tiling.,width=226 ]      one standard method @xcite to obtain the penrose tiling is by projecting a subset of vertices of a five dimensional cubic lattice onto a plane of a certain irrational orientation that is determined by the requirement of five - fold symmetry .",
    "as described in the appendix , vertices are projected only if they lie within a five - dimensional cylinder that runs parallel to the  physical \" @xmath29 plane .",
    "this approach to generating the quasiperiodic tiling allows one an alternative visualization of the penrose tiling in  perpendicular space \" - i.e. the vertices are projected onto the orthogonal three dimensional subspace .",
    "when the penrose tiling is thus mapped into perpendicular space , one sees ( as illustrated in the appendix in fig.[fig : realspace ] ) , that the vertices now lie within four flat pentagon - shaped regions.each family of sites of fig.[fig : starshapes ] projects into a @xmath30 domain  in other words , the perpendicular space representation allows us to separate sites according to their coordination number .",
    "we will use this useful property of the penrose tiling in order to represent the complex antiferromagnetic ground state in a simpler way in sec.v .",
    "this unfrustrated heisenberg antiferromagnet is expected to have long range order at zero temperature , as remarked earlier . in the ground state ,",
    "spins acquire a non - zero magnetization along the z - direction , with the total staggered magnetization of @xmath31 where @xmath32 depends on whether the site is on the a or b sublattice .    assuming that quantum fluctuations are small",
    ", one can expand around the classical antiferromagnetic ground state in which @xmath33 for all sites .",
    "we introduce , according to standard definitions ( see for example @xcite ) , holstein - primakoff boson operators for the sites on the two sublattices : @xmath34 for sites on the a sublattice , @xmath35 for sites on the b sublattice .",
    "the boson operators account for deviations from the classical configuration , with the spin deviation operator on a - sublattice sites given by @xmath36 and on b sublattice sites @xmath37 .",
    "after linearization , the hamiltonian is @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the number of bonds , @xmath40 is the number of sites .",
    "this quadratic hamiltonian can be diagonalized by a generalized bogoliubov transformation , as shown by white , sparks and ortenburger @xcite .",
    "note that the diagonalization can be carried out in the real space basis , and that there is no need to introduce collective operators as in periodic systems .",
    "in the expressions that follow , we number the sites such that the sites on sublattice a come first ( @xmath41 ) , followed by the sites on sublattice b ( @xmath42 . the quadratic term in @xmath43 can then be written in compact form in terms of the vector @xmath44 as @xmath45 where @xmath46 is a real symmetric matrix of four @xmath47 blocks : @xmath48 @xmath49 and @xmath50 are diagonal matrices , with @xmath51 , the coordination numbers on sublattice a , with a similar definition on sublattice b. the connectivites of the sites are given in the off - diagonal blocks , c : @xmath52 if @xmath53 and @xmath54 are nearest neighbors and @xmath55 otherwise .",
    "details of the numerical diagonalization using this real space basis are described in @xcite , where the lsw solution for the ground state of the octagonal tiling was obtained .",
    "the main steps of the calculation will be outlined here for completeness .",

    "these should be excluded from the diagonalization procedure , which transforms the remaining ( n-2 ) operators .",

    "the rectangular t - matrix has the following structure : @xmath67 the transpose of the row vectors of this matrix , denoted by @xmath68 and @xmath69 , correspond to solutions of the eigenvalue equation @xmath70 where the first equation holds for matrix elements of the rows in the upper half of @xmath71 ( the  positive subspace \" ) , and the second for the rows in the lower half of @xmath71 ( the  negative subspace \" ) .",

    "we have mentioned in the previous section that quasiperiodic tilings can be considered as projections of a simpler higher dimensional periodic systems . for our calculations ,",
    "we have considered two types of samples .",
    "the first type are finite samples obtained by projection from 5d , for which we assumed open boundary condition .",
    "such samples have the usual problem of spurious boundary modes .",
    "when considering averages over the entire spectrum , however , as one does in the computation of the order parameter , we found good agreement between these finite samples , and periodic approximants described below .",
    "more precisely , spins deep in the interior of these samples behave in the same way as the spins in the boundary - free periodic approximants , described next .    in order to apply periodic boundary conditions ,",
    "we have considered the so - called taylor approximants of the penrose tiling @xcite .",
    "these rectangular samples are obtained by slightly tilting the projection ( or applying a  shear \" ) , so that the resulting projection has a finite periodic length in the x- and y - directions , as shown in fig.[fig : taylor3 ] .",
    "these approximants clearly break the hierarchical and five - fold rotational symmetry of the penrose tiling at length scales comparable to the repetition length .",
    "however , one can generate taylor approximants of bigger and bigger size , and thus approach the infinite penrose tiling .",
