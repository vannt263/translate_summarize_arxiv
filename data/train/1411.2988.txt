    "the discovery of a higgs boson by the atlas  @xcite and cms collaborations  @xcite in 2012  @xcite was a major success . since then many analyses tried to reveal its properties and to answer the question , whether it is in fact the higgs boson predicted by the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "however , more precise measurements are needed to rule out theories that forecast a differing appearance of the higgs boson .    of particular interest",
    "is the coupling @xmath4 of the higgs boson to the heaviest fermion , the top quark , since it gives insights into understanding the electroweak symmetry breaking .",
    "deviations to this coupling @xmath5 are predicted by theoretical modifications beyond the sm , so it is important to determine @xmath6 as accurate as possible .",
    "earlier this year , the atlas and cms collaborations updated the constraints on @xmath6 using all available higgs boson analyses  @xcite . while both experiments favor the sm scenario with @xmath7 , the anomalous case of a flipped sign @xmath8 is still tolerated when contributions beyond the sm are allowed  @xcite .",
    "the reason for that is the sign - insensitive dependence of the dominant higgs boson production modes .",
    "also the production of a higgs boson in association with a top quark pair is only sensitive to the square of @xmath6 .",
    "the only sign - sensitive constraints come from the search for @xmath3 decays .",
    "the branching ratio br(@xmath3 ) is affected by the interference of contributions from top quark and w bosons in the decay loop , so @xmath6 can be directly probed .",
    "for example a 2.4 times enhanced branching ratio compared to the sm is expected for the anomalous scenario @xmath8 .",
    "an even more sensitive channel is constituted by the @xmath9-channel single top quark production in association with a higgs boson ( hereafter @xmath1 ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : feynman ] shows the two dominant feynman diagrams which interfere with each other destructively in the sm .",
    "this leads to a small cross section of 18.3fb at a center - of - mass energy of 8tev  @xcite .",
    "yet an enhanced cross section for @xmath1 production is predicted by any variation of @xmath6 , for example expected from cp violation  @xcite . the direct search for @xmath1 production assuming an anomalous of coupling @xmath8",
    ", that leads to a 14 times enhanced cross section , represents a nice backdoor to make the most of the data recorded so far at the lhc .    in the following sections first the two available direct searches for @xmath1 production with @xmath3 and @xmath10 decays assuming an anomalous coupling from the cms collaboration are presented .",
    "both analyses use the full 8 tev dataset recorded by the cms detector corresponding to an integrated luminosity of @xmath11 .",
    "additionally shown is the analysis from the atlas collaboration setting constraints on @xmath6 via the search for @xmath12 production with @xmath3 .",
    "the whole dataset recorded with the atlas experiment corresponding to an integrated luminosity of @xmath13 ( 7 tev ) and @xmath14 ( 8 tev ) is used .",
    "the analysis described in  @xcite sets upper limits for anomalous @xmath1 production with @xmath3 decays . as explained above , for the used case @xmath8 both enhancements , in the @xmath1 cross section and the branching ratio br ( ) ,",
    "are expected .",
    "like in most diphoton analyses , a resonance is searched for in the diphoton mass @xmath15 distribution and the signal region is defined as @xmath16 3 gev window around the nominal higgs boson mass . in the analysis ,",
    "diphoton events are selected , where the leading photon satisfies @xmath17 and the subleading photon @xmath18  gev .",
    "further , an event is asked to possess exactly one lepton ( electron  ( e ) or muon  ( @xmath19 ) ) with @xmath20  gev and a distance @xmath21 with respect to the photons .",
    "at least one b - tagged jet with @xmath22  gev is required and the hardest additional jet must satisfy @xmath22  gev and @xmath23 .",
    "the reconstruction of the event is straight forward : the higgs boson candidate is built up from the two photons ; the lepton and the b - tagged jet , together with the missing transverse energy are assigned to the top quark candidate and as the light jet candidate the hardest additional jet in the event is taken . in order to suppress the @xmath12 background a five - variable likelihood discriminant  ( ld ) is introduced .",
    "the used variables for the discriminant are jet multiplicity , transverse mass of the top quark candidate , pseudorapidity of the light jet candidate , rapidity gap between lepton and light jet and the charge of the lepton candidate .",
    "figure  [ fig : cmsgg_ld ] shows the performance of the ld and the separation between the @xmath1 signal and the @xmath12 background is clearly visible .",
    "an additional event requirement of ld  @xmath24  0.25 ensures a @xmath12 contamination below 10% . to estimate the signal processes as well as the resonant background events , particularly from vh and @xmath12 production , monte carlo ( mc )",
    "simulations are used .",
    "other resonant higgs boson production modes are found to be negligible .",
    "the non - resonant backgrounds are estimated via an exponential fit on data in @xmath15 sideband regions with loosened criteria .",
    "since there are no events in data passing the nominal event selection , the b - tag requirement is slackened or the identification requirement for the photons is inverted . from these values the expected non - resonant background yields in the signal region are extrapolated . no events in data are selected in either the signal or the sideband regions as displayed in figure  [ fig : cmsgg_mass ] . the observed upper limit coincides with the expected limit of 2.30pb , i.e. 4.1 times the predicted cross section in the @xmath25 case .",
    "a new analysis optimized for @xmath25 from the cms collaboration documented in  @xcite searches also for anomalous @xmath1 production , but with @xmath10 decays in the final state .",
    "this challenging multijet signature containing 3 b quarks needs a lot of effort to be sensitive to the signal at all , starting by defining a signal enhanced phase space .",
    "the presence of an additional b quark stemming from initial gluon splitting ( qg @xmath26b ) is considered by defining two signal regions asking for either three b - tagged jets ( 3 t region ) or for four b - tagged jets ( 4 t region ) .",
    "additionally at least one untagged jet with @xmath22  gev is required for every event to account for the forward light jet .",
    "further , the events are asked to have exactly one isolated charged lepton ( e or @xmath19 ) . in the electron channel @xmath27",
    "gev and in the muon channel @xmath28  gev is required to suppress qcd background .",
    "this signal enhanced phase space still expects a poor signal over background ratio , i.e. @xmath29 in the 3 t and @xmath30 in the 4 t region . for the latter region",
    "only 70 events in data are expected in total making its sensitivity suffer from low statistics .",
    "the jet assignment to quarks of multijet final states is a combinatorial issue . in @xmath1 mc simulation for each event",
    "a _ correct _ interpretation is defined as the one with the smallest sum of @xmath31 between associated jets and quarks . a multivariate analysis ( mva ) using the kinematic information as well as the angular correlations of the event",
    "is trained to separate these _ correct _ interpretations from all other possible _ wrong _ combinations . when applying the reconstruction to data events all possible combinations",
    "are reconstructed and the one with the highest mva response is chosen . to provide more observables adding sensitivity to the search a similar reconstruction",
    "is applied under the assumption it was a @xmath32 event . in this way also a handle how background - like the event is can be extracted .",
    "again , characteristic kinematic information and angular correlations are used as inputs for the mva and from all possible combinations the one with the highest mva output is taken .",
    "an optimized set out of the observables from both reconstructions together with the lepton charge is chosen as input for the final classification .",
    "for this , a third mva is trained to discriminate @xmath1 signal events from the background processes @xmath32 and @xmath12 .",
    "how well the classification mva performs is shown in figure  [ fig:3t_mu ] exemplarily for the 3 t muon channel .",
    "the simulated signal process in red is clearly separated from the background events , that are dominated by @xmath32 production divided into different flavor contents . since no significant excess between data and simulation",
    "is found , upper limits for anomalous @xmath1 production are set using a fully frequentist methodology .",
    "the observed upper 95% confidence level limit is 1.77pb , i.e. 7.57 times the cross section predicted in the @xmath25 case with @xmath33 expected . given the large uncertainties , the observed limit agrees well with the background - only hypothesis . for a better visualization of these results",
    "all events from all channels are sorted by their expected signal over background ratio as shown in figure  [ fig : sb_comb ] and the good agreement between data and background is visible .",
    "plot containing all events from all signal regions sorted by their expected signal over background ratio . a good agreement between data and background - only expectation is found . ]",

    "the atlas collaboration investigates the coupling @xmath6 in a different approach documented in  @xcite .",
    "based on the search for @xmath12 production with @xmath3 decays , optimized for the sm case , upper limits get calculated for different @xmath6 values .",
    "the used events are categorized into two classes , by either requiring zero leptons in the event ( hadronic channel ) or at least one lepton ( leptonic channel ) . with additional requirements on the number of b - tagged and untagged jets",
    "the hadronic channel is optimized for a high purity of @xmath12 with respect to other higgs boson production modes , whereas a high @xmath12 signal efficiency is tried to be achieved in the leptonic channel . in both channels",
    "the @xmath1 production is a non - negligible background .",
    "moreover , the tw - channel associated production of single top quark and higgs boson ( twh ) is considered as well . in the signal region in 8 tev data  5% of all higgs bosons are expected to stem from @xmath1 and  2.4% from twh processes , while the dominant fraction comes from @xmath12 production .",
    "the fit to extract the limits is performed in the invariant mass distribution of the diphoton system @xmath15 .",
    "combining all channels and both 7 tev and 8 tev datasets , the observed upper limit on @xmath34 is found to be 6.7 , with an expected limit of 6.2 when injecting the sm signal as background . with these results at hand ,",
    "the dependencies on @xmath6 in a range between -3 and + 10 are studied in detail for the affected @xmath12 and @xmath1 production cross sections as well as the branching ration br(@xmath3 ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : atlas_xsec ] shows the functions with respect to the sm expectations .",
    "the branching ratio br(@xmath3 ) has , due to accidental cancellation of the contributions of top quarks and w bosons to the @xmath3 decay , a minimum at + 4.7 , while the cross section @xmath35 is turned off at @xmath36 .",
    "the results , roughly a reversed reflection of the @xmath6 dependencies , are shown in figure  [ fig : atlas_res ] . an upper limit for @xmath6 at 95% cl of + 8.0 and a lower limit of @xmath37 are observed .    ) with respect to the sm expectation for different @xmath6 values . ]    ) with respect to the sm expectation for different @xmath6 values . ]",
    "the three presented searches show already with the so far available data impressive results .",
    "not only they show a good agreement with the sm , but also make first statements on the thq production . the cms collaboration plans to combine all available direct thq searches , while the atlas collaboration wants to add the shown constraints in @xcite .    with the benefit of a higher energy and eventually larger integrated luminosity , the data - taking period starting in 2015 will increase the sensitivity , so at some point a definitive answer on anomalous couplings @xmath6 can be given ."
