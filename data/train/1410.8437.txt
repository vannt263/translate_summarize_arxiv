    "neutrino oscillation experiments @xcite in the last few years have given substantial amount of evidence in favor of non - zero neutrino mass and mixing .",
    "more recently , neutrino oscillation experiments t2k @xcite , double chooz @xcite , daya - bay @xcite and reno @xcite have not only made the earlier predictions for neutrino parameters more precise , but also predicted non - zero value of the reactor mixing angle @xmath1 .",
    "the latest global fit value for @xmath2 range of neutrino oscillation parameters @xcite are as follows : @xmath3 @xmath4 @xmath5 @xmath6 @xmath7 @xmath8 another global fit study @xcite reports the 3@xmath9 values as @xmath10 @xmath11 @xmath12 @xmath13 @xmath14 @xmath15 where nh and ih refers to normal and inverted hierarchies respectively .",
    "although the @xmath2 range for the dirac cp phase is @xmath16 , there are two possible best fit values of it found in the literature : @xmath17 @xcite and @xmath18 @xcite .    before the discovery of non - zero @xmath1 ,",
    "the neutrino oscillation data were consistent with the so called tbm form of the neutrino mixing matrix which predicts the mixing angles as @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "such a mixing pattern studied extensively in the literature @xcite however , needs to be corrected in order to accommodate non - zero @xmath1 discovered recently .",
    "several interesting proposals @xcite have already been put forward which include different corrections to tbm mixing in order to generate non - zero @xmath1 . in the present work , we attempt to find a mechanism which can not only generate non - zero @xmath1 but can also shed some light on those parameters of the neutrino sector which are not yet accurately measured namely , the lightest neutrino mass and the leptonic dirac cp phase . apart from incorporating the constraints from neutrino oscillation experiments",
    ", we also take the constraints from cosmology into account .",
    "cosmology can constrain the the sum of absolute neutrino masses as @xmath21 ev @xcite .",
    "we can further constrain the neutrino parameters from cosmology if we assume leptonic sector origin of matter antimatter asymmetry of the universe . the matter antimatter asymmetry or the baryon asymmetry of the universe",
    "is measured in terms of baryon to photon ratio which according to the latest data available from planck mission @xcite is given as @xmath22 this baryon asymmetry can be naturally generated through the well known mechanism of leptogenesis . according to this mechanism ,",
    "the observed baryon asymmetry of the universe is generated by generating an asymmetry in the leptonic sector first and later converting it into baryon asymmetry through electroweak sphaleron transitions @xcite .",
    "as pointed out first by fukugita and yanagida @xcite , the out of equilibrium cp violating decay of heavy majorana neutrinos provides a natural way to create the required lepton asymmetry .",
    "a very good review of this mechanism can be found in @xcite .    in some of our recent works",
    "@xcite , we carried out an exercise of generating non - zero @xmath1 by considering a model where both type i @xcite and type ii @xcite seesaw are present .",
    "the type i seesaw was assumed to give tbm type neutrino mixing whereas type ii seesaw acts as a perturbation in order to generate non - zero value of reactor mixing angle .",
    "similar attempts to study the deviations from tbm mixing by using the interplay of two different seesaw mechanisms were also done in @xcite . in our earlier works",
    ", we considered type i seesaw mass matrix as tbm type and assumed a minimal structure of the type ii seesaw mass matrix required to break the @xmath23 symmetry associated with the tbm mixing .",
    "we also assumed the type i seesaw mass matrix to be of leading order by fitting it with the best fit values of neutrino mass squared differences and tbm mixing angles .",
    "one difficulty that we face within such framework is to control or restrict the form and strength of type ii seesaw mass matrix in such a way that while generating the correct value of @xmath1 , the mass squared differences as well as other mixing angles remain within the allowed range .",
    "here we generalize our earlier works by dropping these two assumptions : the minimal @xmath23 symmetry breaking form of the type ii seesaw mass matrix and sub - leading approximation for the type ii seesaw term .",
    "we rather derive the most general type ii seesaw mass matrix which can give rise to the correct value of non - zero @xmath1 and could also contain the leptonic dirac cp phase .",
    "we also consider three different scenarios where type i seesaw contribution to neutrino mass can be @xmath24 or @xmath25 which includes the case where type i and type ii seesaw are equally contributing to the neutrino mass .",
    "we constrain the type ii seesaw mass matrix from the requirement of generating successful neutrino oscillation data and also study the correlation among leptonic dirac cp phase , lightest neutrino mass and type ii seesaw strength .",
    "we further constrain the leptonic dirac cp phase contained in the type ii seesaw mass matrix from the requirement of producing the observed baryon asymmetry through leptogenesis .",
    "it should be noted that throughout our study , we have not included majorana neutrino phases in our calculations and hence the conclusions we arrive at in this work are valid only when the majorana phases take extremal values @xmath26 or @xmath27 .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec :",
    "seesaw ] , we briefly discuss type ii seesaw . in section [ sec : devtbm ] , we discuss the deviations from tbm mixing using type ii seesaw . in section [ sec : numeric ] we describe the numerical analysis adopted here and finally conclude in section [ sec : conclude ] .",
    "type ii seesaw mechanism is the extension of the standard model with a scalar field @xmath28 which transforms like a triplet under @xmath29 and has @xmath30 charge twice that of lepton doublets .",
    "such a choice of gauge structure allows an additional yukawa term in the lagrangian given by @xmath31 .",
    "the triplet can be represented as @xmath32 the scalar lagrangian of the standard model also gets modified after the inclusion of this triplet .",
    "apart from the bilinear and quartic coupling terms of the triplet , there is one trilinear term as well involving the triplet and the standard model higgs doublet . from the minimization of the scalar potential , the neutral component of the triplet",
    "is found to acquire a vacuum expectation value ( vev ) given by @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the neutral component of the electroweak higgs doublet with vev approximately @xmath35 gev .",
    "the trilinear coupling term @xmath36 and the mass term of the triplet @xmath37 can be taken to be of same order .",
    "thus , @xmath37 has to be as high as @xmath38 gev to give rise to tiny neutrino masses without any fine - tuning of the dimensionless couplings @xmath39 .     with type ii seesaw for @xmath40 contribution of type i seesaw to neutrino mass , scaledwidth=100.0% ]     with type ii seesaw for @xmath41 contribution of type i seesaw to neutrino mass , scaledwidth=100.0% ]     with type ii seesaw for @xmath25 contribution of type i seesaw to neutrino mass , scaledwidth=100.0% ]    @xmath42{50ih } & \\includegraphics[width=0.5\\textwidth]{50nh } \\end{array } $ ]    @xmath42{70ih } & \\includegraphics[width=0.5\\textwidth]{70nh } \\end{array } $ ]    @xmath42{90ih } & \\includegraphics[width=0.5\\textwidth]{90nh } \\end{array } $ ]     contribution of type i seesaw to neutrino mass , scaledwidth=85.0% ]     contribution of type i seesaw to neutrino mass , scaledwidth=85.0% ]     contribution of type i seesaw to neutrino mass , scaledwidth=85.0% ]     contribution of type i seesaw to neutrino mass , scaledwidth=85.0% ]     contribution of type i seesaw to neutrino mass , scaledwidth=85.0% ]     contribution of type i seesaw to neutrino mass , scaledwidth=85.0% ]     contribution of type i seesaw to neutrino mass , scaledwidth=85.0% ]     contribution of type i seesaw to neutrino mass , scaledwidth=85.0% ]     contribution of type i seesaw to neutrino mass , scaledwidth=85.0% ]",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , here we consider the type i seesaw to give rise to tbm type neutrino mixing whereas the type ii seesaw term acts like a deviation from tbm mixing in order to generate non - zero @xmath1 .",
    "the tbm type neutrino mass matrix can be parametrized as @xmath43 which is clearly @xmath23 symmetric with eigenvalues @xmath44 .",
    "it predicts the mixing angles as @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "this corresponding mixing matrix can be written as @xmath45 the pontecorvo - maki - nakagawa - sakata ( pmns ) leptonic mixing matrix is related to the diagonalizing matrices of neutrino and charged lepton mass matrices @xmath46 respectively , as @xmath47 the pmns mixing matrix can be parametrized as @xmath48 where @xmath49 and @xmath0 is the dirac cp phase .",
    "if @xmath50 from type i seesaw , then for diagonal charged lepton mass matrix both the reactor mixing angle @xmath1 and the leptonic dirac cp phase @xmath0 vanish in the neutrino sector .",
    "since vanishing reactor mixing angle has been ruled out by experiments , the tbm type neutrino mixing has to be corrected . in our present work ,",
    "we are interested in exploring the possibility of generating this correction for non - zero @xmath1 and predicting leptonic cp phase at the same time . considering the type ii seesaw term as the necessary correction to tbm mixing",
    ", we write the neutrino mass matrix as @xmath51 where @xmath52 are dirac the right handed neutrino mass matrices respectively . since the diagonalizing matrix of @xmath53 is @xmath54 and that of type i mass matrix @xmath55 is @xmath56 , the above equation can be written as @xmath57 for normal hierarchy , the diagonal mass matrix of the light neutrinos can be written as @xmath58 whereas for inverted hierarchy it can be written as @xmath59 . to vary the relative strength of type i and type ii seesaw terms , we parametrize the diagonal type i mass matrix as @xmath60 , where @xmath61 is a parameter between 0 and 1 . denoting the symmetric type ii seesaw mass matrix as @xmath62 and using equation ( [ nu12 ] ) , the type ii seesaw mass matrix elements can be derived as    @xmath63 @xmath64    @xmath65    @xmath66    @xmath67    @xmath68    it should be noted that in the general pmns mixing matrix , there are two majorana phases as well originating in the right handed neutrino sector .",
    "we have omitted these two phases in equation , assuming them to take trivial values @xmath69 .",
    "these majorana phases can significantly affect the baryon asymmetry as discussed recently within the context of type i and type ii seesaw models in @xcite .",
    "the charged lepton flavor violation within such frameworks have been discussed recently in @xcite whereas the consequences in neutrinoless double beta decay have been explored in details in @xcite .",
    "we leave a more detailed study of these scenarios including the effects of non - trivial majorana phases to future investigations .",
    "using the expressions for type ii seesaw mass matrix elements in terms of neutrino parameters , we first try to see the dependence of leptonic dirac cp phase @xmath70 on type ii seesaw strength . for that",
    ", we use the best fit values of the neutrino parameters given in @xcite .",
    "since neutrino oscillation data give only two mass squared differences and three mixing angles , we still have the lightest neutrino mass as the free parameter .",
    "thus , the dependence of @xmath71 on type ii seesaw is subject to the choice of two free parameters : the lightest neutrino mass and the relative strength of type i - ii seesaw terms @xmath61 .",
    "we choose two different values of lightest neutrino mass which give rise to quasi - degenerate and hierarchical type neutrino mass patterns respectively .",
    "we also choose three different values of @xmath61 to study different relative contribution of type i and type ii seesaw terms .",
    "the variation of @xmath72 on type ii seesaw is shown in figure [ fig1 ] , [ fig2 ] , [ fig3 ] for different choices of lightest neutrino mass and @xmath61 . for normal hierarchy ,",
    "the choices for lightest neutrino mass are @xmath73 ev whereas for inverted hierarchy they are taken as @xmath74 ev .",
    "the specific choice of @xmath75 ev corresponds to a large hierarchy in the neutrino mass spectrum and @xmath76 ev correspond to a neutrino mass spectrum where all the three masses are of same order .",
    "the values @xmath77 ev are chosen in such a way that the sum of absolute neutrino masses lies below the cosmological upper bound .",
    "we choose three different values of @xmath61 namely , @xmath78 which correspond to @xmath79 contribution of type i seesaw to neutrino mass respectively .",
    "we also show the parameter space in the type ii seesaw term versus lightest neutrino mass plane which can give rise to the correct neutrino oscillation data within our framework .",
    "the corresponding plots for all the relative strengths of type i and type ii seesaw terms are shown in figure [ fig4 ] , [ fig5 ] and [ fig6 ] .",
    "we also derive the type ii seesaw mass matrices for all the choices of lightest neutrino mass and @xmath61 .",
    "they are shown in table [ table1 ] , [ table2 ] , [ table3 ] and [ table4 ] .",
    "[ table1 ]    [ table2 ]    [ table3 ]    [ table4 ]    after deriving the type ii seesaw mass matrix , we then proceed to calculate the amount of baryon asymmetry that can be produced through the mechanism of leptogenesis in our model . since type i seesaw term gives rise to a real tbm type neutrino mass matrix , it is natural to assume real values of dirac yukawa couplings in the terms @xmath80 .",
    "this makes the process of right handed heavy neutrino decay into a light neutrino and higgs @xmath81 cp preserving ruling out the possibility of leptogenesis .",
    "however , the type ii seesaw mass matrix , being the common origin of non - zero @xmath1 and leptonic dirac cp phase , is of complex type and hence could be a source of lepton asymmetry .",
    "type ii seesaw or the presence of higgs triplet can contribute to lepton asymmetry in two different ways : cp violating decay of triplet higgs into standard model particles or the right handed neutrino decay into standard model particles through virtual higgs triplet .",
    "we adopt the latter possibility where cp violating decay of the lightest right handed neutrino through a virtual higgs triplet is responsible for creating the lepton asymmetry . to calculate the baryon asymmetry",
    ", we follow the procedure adopted in our earlier works @xcite .",
    "while calculating the lepton asymmetry , the lepton flavor effects @xcite can play a crucial role if the lightest right handed neutrino mass @xmath82 is below @xmath83 gev . for @xmath84",
    "gev , all lepton flavors are out of equilibrium giving rise to one flavor leptogenesis .",
    "if @xmath85 , then only electron and muon flavors are out of equilibrium giving rise to two flavor leptogenesis .",
    "three flavor leptogenesis arises when @xmath86 gev where only electron flavor is out of equilibrium . to keep the lightest right handed neutrino mass in different flavor regime",
    ", one needs to choose the dirac neutrino mass matrix appropriately . after fitting the type i seesaw mass matrix as @xmath87 where @xmath88 we can find the right handed neutrino mass matrix as @xmath89 we consider a diagonal type dirac neutrino mass matrix which can be parametrized as @xmath90 where @xmath91 is the standard wolfenstein parameter and @xmath92 are positive integers . we fix @xmath93 gev and change the integers @xmath92 in order to keep the lightest right handed neutrino mass @xmath82 in the appropriate flavor regime .",
    "we find that @xmath94 correspond to one , two and three flavor regimes of leptogenesis respectively .",
    "after fixing @xmath95 the only free parameter in the neutrino sector within our framework is the leptonic cp phase @xmath0 .",
    "we vary the cp phase and compute the predictions for baryon asymmetry in one , two and three flavor regimes for all the choices of @xmath96 .",
    "the variations of baryon asymmetry with leptonic cp phase @xmath0 are shown in figure [ fig7 ] , [ fig8 ] , [ fig9 ] , [ fig10 ] , [ fig11 ] , [ fig12 ] , [ fig13 ] , [ fig14 ] and [ fig15 ] .",
    ".values of @xmath0 giving correct baryon asymmetry [ cols=\"<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ table5 ]",
    "in this work , we have generalized our earlier studies on the common origin of non - zero reactor mixing angle , leptonic cp phase and leptogenesis from type ii seesaw .",
    "type i seesaw is assumed to give a tbm type neutrino mixing whereas type ii seesaw gives the necessary corrections to generate non - zero @xmath1 as well as leptonic cp phase @xmath0 . without assuming any specific form of the type ii seesaw mass matrix , here we derive the most general form of type ii seesaw mass matrix that can generate non - zero values of @xmath97 . unlike previous studies",
    ", here we do not assume the type i seesaw as the leading contributor to neutrino mass .",
    "we consider three different scenarios where type i seesaw contributions to neutrino mass are @xmath24 and @xmath25 respectively .",
    "we also consider both inverted and normal hierarchical neutrino mass spectrum as well as two different types of lightest neutrino mass in order to show the effect of hierarchy .",
    "we first see the dependence of leptonic cp phase on type ii seesaw mass term . from the figures [ fig1 ] , [ fig2 ] , [ fig3 ] we see that @xmath98 varies between 0 and 1 depending on the strength of the type ii seesaw term . the variation is found to be very sharp in case of inverted hierarchy with @xmath99 ev whereas in other cases it varies moderately .",
    "we also plot the allowed values of type ii seesaw term consistent with neutrino oscillation data as a function of lightest neutrino mass .",
    "they are shown in figures [ fig4 ] , [ fig5 ] and [ fig6 ] .",
    "we show the variation of baryon asymmetry with leptonic cp phase in figures [ fig7 ] , [ fig8 ] , [ fig9 ] , [ fig10 ] , [ fig11 ] , [ fig12 ] , [ fig13 ] , [ fig14 ] and [ fig15 ] and summarize them in the table [ table5 ] .",
    "it can be seen from these figures that we do not get the correct baryon asymmetry in the three flavor regime for all choices of parameters . in the one flavor regime ,",
    "only normal hierarchical neutrino mass with all masses of same order gives the correct baryon asymmetry .",
    "in the two flavor regime although normal hierarchy gives correct baryon asymmetry only when all the neutrino masses are of same order , inverted hierarchy can give rise to correct baryon asymmetry even if the lightest neutrino mass is as low as @xmath100 ev .",
    "precise determination of leptonic cp violation in future experiments should be able to rule out some of the scenarios we have discussed in this work .",
    "if we go by the best fit values of @xmath0 presently available in the literature : @xmath17 @xcite and @xmath18 @xcite , we see from table [ table5 ] that only normal hierarchy with @xmath101 ev prefers the value of @xmath0 to be close to @xmath18 in order to produce the correct baryon asymmetry .",
    "on the other hand , none of the scenarios we discuss here favor the value of @xmath0 to be @xmath17 .",
    "apart from neutrino experiments , the present and future cosmology experiments should also be able to rule out some more regions of the parameter space we have studied in this work . as stressed earlier ,",
    "our main conclusions in this work are valid only when the majorana neutrino phases take only extremal values like @xmath26 or @xmath27 .",
    "we leave a more complete study of these scenarios including the majorana phases to future works .",

    "<S> we study the possibility of connecting leptonic dirac cp phase @xmath0 , lightest neutrino mass and baryon asymmetry of the universe within the framework of a model where both type i and type ii seesaw mechanisms contribute to neutrino mass . </S>",
    "<S> type i seesaw gives rise to tri - bimaximal ( tbm ) type neutrino mixing whereas type ii seesaw acts as a correction in order to generate non - zero @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> we derive the most general form of type ii seesaw mass matrix which can not only give rise to correct neutrino mixing angles but also can generate non - trivial value of @xmath0 . considering both the cases where type ii seesaw is sub - leading and is equally dominant compared to type i seesaw , we correlate the type ii seesaw term with @xmath0 and lightest neutrino mass . </S>",
    "<S> we further constrain the dirac cp phase @xmath0 and hence the type ii seesaw mass matrix from the requirement of producing the observed baryon asymmetry through the mechanism of leptogenesis . </S>"
