    "strongly interacting localized electrons have been attracting renewed interest . a key feature characterizing the new development is the coupling of spin and orbital degrees of freedom .",
    "for example , ce@xmath2la@xmath3b@xmath4 @xcite has both magnetic and electric quadrupole orders , and the phase diagram exhibits intriguing systematics as @xmath5 varies .",
    "the specific heat above the quadrupolar ordering temperature shows a large contribution of fluctuation , which is suppressed by applied magnetic field .",
    "@xcite similar but non - identical behavior has been found in tmte.@xcite we note that ce@xmath2la@xmath3b@xmath4 shows the kondo effect in the resistivity , while tmte is insulating . in 3d systems ,",
    "the orbital degrees of freedom appears as the static and dynamic jahn - teller effects .",
    "@xcite an exemplary system is la@xmath2sr@xmath3mno@xmath6 , which shows the drastic change of magnetic anisotropy @xcite with increasing @xmath5 .",
    "the transport property is characterized by the colossal magneto - resistance . @xcite",
    "all these phenomena require simultaneous account of orbital and spin degrees of freedom .",
    "these developments motivate construction of a new quantum theory which can deal with fluctuation effects of not only spin but higher - order multipoles .",
    "concerning previous efforts toward the dynamical theory , we refer to the work of hubbard@xcite which addresses the high - temperature limit of the heisenberg model in high dimensions . for the low - dimensional heisenberg model ,",
    "highly sophisticated theories are available with account of quantum fluctuations.@xcite however , these theories are not suitable to three - dimensional systems with a different character of fluctuations .    in the case of strongly correlated itinerant electrons , microscopic theories have been developed with account of both the kondo effect and the intersite correlation for the anderson lattice , @xcite and for the hubbard model .",
    "@xcite these theories use the idea of dynamical effective medium which is justified in the limit of large spatial dimensions .",
    "although the approach is highly successful in deriving the density of states of electrons with nontrivial structure around the fermi level , the magnetic property is treated rather crudely . to clarify the need of improvement ,",
    "let us take an example of the half - filled hubbard model . with large coulomb repulsion",
    "the single - particle spectrum has an energy gap . as a result",
    "the spectrum of the effective medium to determine the green function also has a gap . under this condition",
    "the infinite - dimensional theory predicts a gapful spectrum also for spin excitations . in reality , however , the spin excitation is gapless in many cases even though the single - particle spectrum has a gap .",
    "furthermore in the insulating paramagnetic phase the entropy derived by the theory does not vanish at zero temperature . with a magnetic ordering ,",
    "the entropy can vanish by the same mechanism as the band antiferromagnetism .",
    "however , in the limit of vanishing charge fluctuation , one has complete spin polarization in the ground state .",
    "this last feature of the theory is not satisfying since quantum spin fluctuations should reduce more or less the magnitude of ordered moments . in order to remedy the situation one has to go beyond the lowest - order self - consistent theory",
    ". then there appears a difficulty of analyticity in the hubbard model and other fermion models . @xcite",
    "the purpose of this paper is to present a next - leading order self - consistent theory which is free from the above deficiency .",
    "the formulation has so far been attained only for systems with localized electrons such as quantum spins .",
    "the present theory can deal with a possible paramagnetic ground state without residual entropy , provided that the spin excitation has a gapless spectrum .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in the next section we take the ising model as the simplest system to apply the formalism .",
    "we exploit the variational character of the thermodynamic potential in deriving the magnetization and the susceptibility .",
    "the same variational property is also used to compute the entropy and specific heat within the same scheme .",
    "section 3 describes the extension of the formalism to quantum models .",
    "we take the heisenberg model with arbitrary exchange interactions as a representative quantum model .",
    "the static approximation is introduced which is much simpler to treat than the fully dynamical counterpart .",
    "the approximation is justified in the high temperature limit and makes a correspondence to the classical theory . in ",
    "4 we discuss a way to solve the problem by mapping to the spin - boson system where an impurity spin interacts with bosonic environment .",
    "the latter represents the dynamical medium provided by surrounding spins . by this mapping ,",
    "numerical methods such as the monte carlo technique , numerical renormalization group , or the self - consistent perturbation theory become applicable to solve the impurity problem .",
    "section 5 applies the theory to more general systems with quadrupole moments or with crystalline - electric - field effects . in the final section",
    "we discuss the results , in particular a possibility of a kondo - type effect in spin systems without conduction electrons .",
    "although our principal interest is in quantum models , we first take the ising model to present the new formalism in the simplest , and hence the most transparent manner .",
    "the spherical model approximation ( sma ) goes one step beyond the mean - field theory for the ising model , and has been discussed for many years .",
    "@xcite we rederive the sma in a variational formalism , which makes clear the structure as well as limitation of the approximation . as a byproduct , we derive a formula to express the specific heat in terms of the susceptibility .",
    "the hamiltonian of the ising model is given by @xmath7 where each @xmath8 takes @xmath9 and @xmath10 denotes a magnetic field at site @xmath11 .",
    "for clarity we assume that the interactions @xmath12 are all positive , and the inverse of the matrix @xmath13 exists .",
    "the self - consistency equations , however , are valid for more general interactions .",
    "we introduce auxiliary fields which obey the gaussian distribution , and which couple with @xmath8 locally .",
    "the basic identity is written as @xmath14 , \\label{eq : gaussian}\\ ] ] where the the integration path @xmath15 runs from @xmath16 to @xmath17 with @xmath18 going to infinity .",
    "this choice of a path makes it possible to obtain the convergent integral after the change of integration variables .",
    "namely we distort the path either along the whole real axis or the imaginary axis depending on the sign of the eigenvalue of the matrix @xmath19 .",
    "the partition function is written as @xmath20 where @xmath21 thus we see that the gaussian identity casts the original two - body interaction into the sum of local coupling terms .    in order to perform perturbation theory we first set the energy scale to @xmath22 which corresponds to the ferromagnetic transition temperature in the mean - field approximation ( mfa ) .",
    "thus each @xmath12 is of order @xmath23 where @xmath1 is the number of equivalent neighbors . to organize the perturbation series concisely , it is convenient to use the fermion representation for ising spins .",
    "namely we introduce spinless fermions by @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the annihilation operator of a fermion at site @xmath11 .",
    "then each term of the perturbation expansion can be expressed in terms of feynman diagrams .",
    "the intersite contribution involves the bare cumulant @xmath26 .",
    "we remark that the same diagrams appear when we use the fermion representation from the outset without introducing the @xmath27 field .",
    "however for quantum models the @xmath27 field makes the theory much more concise .",
    "figure 1(a ) shows the zero - th order contribution to the polarization function which corresponds to the self - energy of the renormalized exchange interaction .",
    "the small parameter @xmath23 is offset by the site summation in these diagrams which are called tadpoles .",
    "the tadpoles lead to shift of the effective fermion level , and represent as such the molecular field .",
    "= 15 cm = 15 cm = 5 cm    the set of zero - th order diagrams make a tree - like structure composed of tadpoles . in the leading order",
    "there are no loops composed of interaction lines .",
    "summation of all the tree diagrams is equivalent to the saddle point approximation of eq.([eq : phi - term ] ) .",
    "namely after taking the trace over @xmath8 in eq.([eq : phi - term ] ) , we find that the saddle point @xmath28 of the field @xmath29 satisfies the condition @xmath30 it is seen that @xmath28 gives the molecular field at site @xmath11 , and the magnetization @xmath31 is given by @xmath32 .",
    "namely we get @xmath33    correction to the saddle point approximation is higher order in the small parameter @xmath23 . examples of diagrams of @xmath0 is shown in fig.1(b ) .",
    "in addition to the self - energy correction to the fermion level , vertex correction appears which contributes to the local field beyond the mfa . note that to this order the polarization function is diagonal in site indices . only from the order of @xmath34 ,",
    "there emerge off - diagonal contributions .",
    "an example is shown in fig.1(c ) .",
    "thus we see that in the limit of large dimensions the mfa becomes exact , and that the polarization function @xmath35 is diagonal in site indices to the next leading order .",
    "the renormalized exchange interaction @xmath36 is given by @xmath37 once the renormalized exchange is determined , the ( differential ) magnetic susceptibility is derived as the two - particle green function of the fictitious fermions .",
    "namely the ( renormalized ) cumulant average is related to the susceptibility as @xmath38 where @xmath39 means the cumulant average , and @xmath40 in terms of the polarization function the susceptibility satisfies the dyson - type equation : @xmath41 this equation is also written in the matrix form as @xmath42 in the next subsection we derive the susceptibility explicitly .      in a theory",
    "accurate only up to @xmath0 , there is some ambiguity how to include higher - order terms .",
    "we respect the self - consistency or , equivalently , the variational property of the theory in choosing higher - order terms .",
    "@xcite let us consider the perturbation expansion of the thermodynamic potential @xmath43 .",
    "in order to make a renormalized expansion , we introduce a fictitious field @xmath44 which shifts @xmath45 to @xmath46 in @xmath47 . with infinitesimal change of @xmath44 ,",
    "the corresponding change of @xmath48 occurs as @xmath49 here we consider the case where @xmath50 couples on the average with only the connected part of @xmath51 , _",
    "i.e. _ the cumulant average : @xmath52 an example of external fields without coupling to the disconnected part @xmath53 is the case where @xmath50 has a modulation corresponding to a finite momentum with @xmath10 constant .",
    "the dyson equation gives the relationship between @xmath36 and the bare exchange as @xmath54 in the matrix notation . by using @xmath55",
    ", we can eliminate the fictitious field .",
    "then we get @xmath56 where tr is the trace over the site index and the functional @xmath57 is introduced so as to give @xmath58 .",
    "equivalently , @xmath59 is written symbolically as @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the polarization function made up of all @xmath62-th order skeleton diagrams with respect to @xmath63 . upon variation of @xmath63 in an @xmath62-th order skeleton",
    ", we have @xmath62 ways of choosing @xmath63 .",
    "hence the denominator is cancelled in the final result , and @xmath64 in eq.([eq : skeleton ] ) indeed gives @xmath65 .",
    "now we integrate eq.([eq : delta omega ] ) with respect to the exchange interaction ranging from @xmath66 to @xmath63 .",
    "the result is given by @xmath67    -\\phi \\{\\bar{j}\\ } , \\label{eq : omega}\\ ] ] where @xmath68,\\ ] ] comes from the lower limit of integration and corresponds to the mfa .",
    "we interpret eq.([eq : omega ] ) as giving a variational form which is minimized by the optimum @xmath63 .",
    "since @xmath65 is diagonal in site indices , only the diagonal part of @xmath36 enters the expansion eq.([eq : skeleton ] ) . furthermore with the optimum choice @xmath69",
    ", we have @xmath70 where @xmath71 is the diagonal part of the matrix @xmath63 .",
    "thus except for the term @xmath72 , only the diagonal part @xmath71 of @xmath63 is relevant to @xmath73 .",
    "the foregoing rearrangement guides us how to select terms of higher order for self - consistency of the theory . for explicit calculation of @xmath48",
    "we decompose @xmath47 as @xmath74 where @xmath75 here @xmath76 is the deviation from the average value @xmath28 , @xmath77 and @xmath78 .",
    "the quantities @xmath36 and @xmath28 are to be determined variationally .",
    "we regard @xmath79 as the unperturbed hamiltonian . namely we have @xmath80\\rangle _ g , \\label{eq : z product}\\ ] ] where @xmath81 and the average is taken with respect to the distribution @xmath82 .",
    "the unperturbed thermodynamic potential @xmath83 is given by @xmath84 where @xmath85 enters via the normalization given by eq.([eq : gaussian ] ) . by comparing eqs.([eq : omega ] ) , ( [ eq : z product ] ) and ( [ eq : omega_g ] ) , we see that the average in eq.([eq : z product ] ) should rather be taken with use of @xmath86 in order to achieve self - consistency up to @xmath0 .",
    "thus we obtain the partition function as @xmath87 here @xmath88 is the product of local contributions given by @xmath89 \\equiv \\prod_i z_i , \\ ] ] and @xmath90 comes from @xmath91 .",
    "the self - consistent renormalization up to @xmath0 is carried out by requiring that the thermodynamic potential @xmath48 of the system be stationary against independent variations of @xmath35 and @xmath28 . in accordance with the partition function",
    "we decompose @xmath48 as @xmath92 where each suffix corresponds to that of the partition function .",
    "we write @xmath93 with @xmath94 the simplicity of the ising model allows us to obtain @xmath95 analytically .",
    "namely we first perform the @xmath27 integration and then sum over @xmath96 .",

    "note that @xmath99 represents the reaction field @xcite which is absent in the effective field of the mfa .",
    "by variation with respect to @xmath100 we obtain @xmath101[m_i-\\tanh ( \\beta\\bar{h}_i ) ] = 0 , \\label{eq : stationary_a}\\ ] ] or equivalently @xmath102 we emphasize that the reaction field enters automatically in our theory as a consequence of the variational principle .",
    "on the other hand variation of @xmath35 gives @xmath103 [ t\\bar{j}_{ii}-\\langle \\delta\\phi_i^2\\rangle ] = 0 .",

    "we now derive the susceptibility by using the formula : @xmath109 in taking the derivative of @xmath48 we care only the explicit dependence of @xmath12 because of the stationary property represented by eqs.([eq : stationary_a ] ) and ( [ eq : stationary_p ] ) .",
    "then the contribution comes only from @xmath110 giving @xmath111_{ij } , \\label{eq : chifluc}\\ ] ] where the matrix notations are used .",
    "this result is consistent with the perturbation formula given by eq.([eq : dyson ] ) .",
    "we quote another relation which is obtained by partial integration of the quantity : @xmath112 namely we obtain @xmath113 this formula gives the rigorous relationship between the susceptibility and @xmath114 . substituting @xmath115 and @xmath116",

    "one can also write the same relationship as @xmath128    now we mention a drawback of the sma that the ward - takahashi identity ( wti ) is violated .",
    "@xcite in order to see a consequence of the violation we derive the susceptibility @xmath129 by direct differentiation .",

    "hence we recover eq.([eq : chifluc ] ) only if we can neglect @xmath132 .",
    "fortunately this is indeed justified in the zero - field limit since the time reversal invariance requires @xmath123 to be an even function of magnetic field . at finite field",
    ", however , the susceptibility depends on whether one derives it from fluctuation formula or from the thermodynamic derivative .",
    "this drawback of the theory should be kept in mind if one discuss the property in finite magnetic fields .",
    "@xcite    the violation of the wti originates from the site - diagonal property of the polarization function , and is very hard to remedy completely .",
    "the wti requires consistency between quantities with different orders of magnitude in @xmath23 . for example",
    ", all the site - diagonal self - energy diagrams in the fermion representation are included in the sma since they are of @xmath133 and @xmath0 .",
    "however , the wti requires inclusion of polarization diagrams of @xmath134 as well .",
    "an example is the one shown in fig.1(c ) which is generated from an @xmath0 part of the self - energy . in the absence of magnetization , this diagram and related ones vanish by the particle - hole symmetry .",

    "we derive the specific heat explicitly in the case without magnetic field .",
    "we set @xmath146 assuming the paramagnetic phase and remove the site indices of all local quantities . at high temperatures , it is easy to derive the leading term as @xmath147 then the entropy and specific heat is given by @xmath148 on the other hand , for general temperature it is convenient to represent @xmath149 in terms of susceptibilities .",
    "the temperature dependence of @xmath123 is derived by the use of the self - consistency relation eq.([eq : av=1 ] ) . after some algebra we obtain a compact formula : @xmath150 which is assured to be positive by the inequality @xmath151 .",
    "it is evident from above that the specific heat and the susceptibility shows the anomaly at the same temperature , and that @xmath15 in the paramagnetic phase becomes larger as intersite correlation develops .",
    "this is in sharp contrast to the mfa where @xmath152 for @xmath153 .",
    "however , the critical property of the present theory is the same as the mfa .",
    "in this section we extend the formalism developed in  2 to quantum models . as a representative of quantum models we consider the generalized heisenberg model given by @xmath154 for clarity we assume in this section that the magnetic field is homogeneous .",

    "if the entropy given by eq.([eq : q - entropy ] ) does not tend to vanish as @xmath137 goes to zero , the paramagnetic state becomes unstable against a magnetic order .",
    "this is always the case for classical spins .",
    "the possibility to have the paramagnetic ground state in the extreme quantum case is discussed in more detail later .      instead of performing the linked - cluster expansion as described above , it is also possible to integrate away the @xmath27 fields in eq.([eq : lag1 ] ) .",
    "the resultant lagrangian @xmath237 is given by ( apart from the berry phase term ) @xmath238 where the matrix @xmath239 denotes the static component of @xmath195 .",

    "the static approximation in the present theory still keeps the non - commuting character of quantum spins . in this respect",
    "it is different from our previous theory , @xcite which replaced the spin vector composed of the pauli matrices by a classical vector .    in the static approximation",
    ", the quantum spin sees a static external field which has the gaussian distribution specified by @xmath123 .",
    "the path integral over @xmath242 can be replaced by the trace of the density operator with the quantization axis taken in the direction of @xmath243 with @xmath244 .",
    "we then have @xmath245 in contrast to the case of the ising model , integration over @xmath246 does not lead to concise expression .",
    "however , the result simplifies in some limiting cases .",
    "first , by replacing the vector quantities by corresponding scalars , eq.([eq : z_static ] ) is reduced to @xmath247 2\\cosh [ \\beta\\bar{h}],\\ ] ] where @xmath248 is the effective field with account of the reaction field .",
    "thus the result for the ising model is reproduced .    on the other hand ,",
    "if one neglects @xmath249 in the berry phase term , the non - commuting nature of spin operators is lost .",
    "then we are left with spins behaving as classical vectors .",
    "this approximation is justified in the limit of large spin @xmath250 .",

    "@xcite the same structure of perturbation diagrams is obtained whichever the boson field or the @xmath27 field is used .",
    "let the partition function of the impurity plus bosons be given by @xmath256 .",
    "then the partition function @xmath189 of the effective impurity is given by @xmath257 where @xmath258 is the partition function of bosons without the impurity .    in order to characterize the boson system leading to the equivalent partition function we replace @xmath259 by boson operators as @xmath260,\\ ] ] where @xmath261 is the annihilation operator of a boson with polarization @xmath262 , and @xmath263 is the coupling constant .",
    "the role of @xmath263 is only to adjust the dimension , and hence can be taken unity in practical calculation . without loss of generality",

    "for example , if the boson has a spectrum @xmath275 for small @xmath270 , we obtain @xmath276 for small @xmath277 .",
    "the ground state of the impurity without magnetic field becomes either doublet or singlet depending on the details of @xmath278 . in the former case",
    ", the self - consistent solution actually drives the ground state to magnetic ordering . on the contrary , if the effective impurity has the singlet ground state , the system as a whole also has the singlet ground state .",
    "this singlet state is reminiscent of the rvb picture . @xcite",
    "technically eq.([eq : spin - boson ] ) is not exactly the same as the standard spin - boson model which is anisotropic in the spin space . in the bosonization approach to the kondo problem ,",
    "@xcite one ends up with an equivalent classical two - component gas in one dimension with the interaction decaying as inverse square of the distance . in our case ,",
    "the long - time behavior is given by @xmath279 if @xmath280 for small frequencies .",
    "however , the resultant model is not an ising model as seen from eq.([eq : lag_s ] ) .",

    "@xcite then @xmath282 plays the role of instantons .",
    "it remains to see how the self - consistency condition determines the actual shape of @xmath278 .    among appropriate methods to solve the effective impurity problem , we mention numerical methods such as the numerical renormalization group,@xcite the quantum monte carlo @xcite , or the resolvent method@xcite all of which respect the strong on - site correlation .",
    "it seems that the most convenient way to obtain the self - consistent solution is to use the numerical iteration .",

    "write them as @xmath292 where @xmath293 represents either @xmath294 or @xmath295 $ ]",
    ". then we consider the hamiltonian given by @xmath296 where the second term represents energy levels with possible splittings caused by magnetic field and/or by crystalline electric field ( cef ) .",
    "the exchange interaction has a symmetry much lower than the point - group symmetry at each site .",
    "thus it has many nonzero elements with off - diagonal indices in general .    for the partition function we use the path integral over @xmath297 which can again be performed with use of fictitious fermion or boson operators .",
    "as in the spin case we impose the constraints that the sum of the projection operators be unity at each site . the fluctuating field @xmath298 has the same set of indices as the @xmath290-operators .",

    "we define the green function of the fluctuating field by @xmath303 where the average is to be taken over the distribution specified self - consistently . to derive this",
    "we introduce the polarization matrix @xmath173 by @xmath304 where all quantities are matrices . the important point to note",
    "is that @xmath305 is diagonal both in site and @xmath293 .",

    "the renormalization is carried out by requiring that matrix of the renormalized single - site propagator in @xmath189 be equal to @xmath71 .",

    "the matrix @xmath127 is composed of the fourier transform of @xmath307 , and @xmath194 is the local dynamical susceptibility matrix .",
    "the effective interaction matrix @xmath195 satisfies the relation @xmath308 the full dynamical susceptibility matrix @xmath309 is given by @xmath310^{-1}.\\ ] ] these relations are just generalization of those derived in previous sections .    the matrix equation is greatly simplified if one uses the basis set of irreducible representations .",
    "we sketch the procedure assuming the spherical symmetry around the effective impurity .",
    "this is merely to make notations familiar , and can be straightforwardly generalized to the point - group symmetry .",
    "@xcite the irreducible tensor operators @xmath311 are given by @xmath312 where @xmath313 is the clebsch - gordan coefficient .",
    "then the local susceptibility matrix in this basis set has only diagonal elements as given by @xmath314 since @xmath315 runs from 0 to @xmath316 , we have @xmath317 independent components for @xmath318 .",
    "the same number of components are present also for @xmath319 and @xmath195 .",
    "thus eq.([eq : sc_cef ] ) is reduced to @xmath317 scalar equations .",
    "it is convenient to introduce the hamiltonian of an impurity coupled with fictitious bosons as in the case of the heisenberg model .",
    "the hamiltonian without symmetry breaking fields is given by @xmath320,\\ ] ] where the mode @xmath206 represents the set @xmath321 of the irreducible tensor .",
    "we note that the phase transition to the ordered phase is signaled by @xmath322 = 0 , \\label{eq : det}\\ ] ] which reduces to the mfa if one uses the zero - th order result for the polarization function .",
    "namely all the fluctuation effect is encoded in @xmath323 in the present theory . as temperature decreases ,",
    "the determinant becomes zero first for the most favorable order .",
    "if @xmath127 can be regarded as a scalar , there is no coupling among different irreducible representations .",
    "the opposite extreme case is that @xmath202 is situated at a low symmetry point of the brillouin zone .",
    "then many components of @xmath323 couple in eq.([eq : det ] ) .",
    "we compare the present theory with previous effective medium theories for fermions .",
    "both theories have similar sets of self - consistent equations .",
    "similarity to the fermion theory is seen by the correspondence @xmath324 and @xmath325 where @xmath326 is the single - particle green function and @xmath327 the self - energy of fermions .",
    "the intersite exchange interaction in fermion models is generated by virtual particle - hole pair excitations .",
    "hence a loop of exchange interactions , which is taken into account here in deriving the polarization function , is equivalent to a loop of particle - hole bubbles in the fermionic theory .",
    "however , the intersite processes so far included in the fermionic theory just corresponds to tree diagrams of particle - hole bubbles .",
    "thus for magnetic properties the fermionic theory is still in the mean - field level . in order to study the itinerant magnetism beyond the mean - field theory",
    ", it seems more convenient to use the _ t - j _ model instead of the hubbard model .",
    "then the single - site optimization of not only the polarization function but the fermion self - energy is accomplished by the use of grassmann auxiliary fields in addition to the @xmath27 fields .",
    "this subject will be treated in a separate paper .",
    "concerning the possible kondo - type effect , the heisenberg model with only the nearest - neighbor interaction @xmath66 in the unfrustrated lattice is not a good candidate .",
    "as compared to the characteristic scale @xmath328 for the neel state , the singlet can not take advantage of many neighbors and the characteristic energy is @xmath66 .",
    "hence the ground state of the nearest - neighbor model becomes the neel state in high dimensions . on the contrary , if there is substantial frustration in the longer - ranged exchange interaction , the critical temperature for the magnetic ordering may be suppressed severely",
    ". the kondo temperature is determined by the easiness to form singlet pairs between many neighbors .",
    "hence presence of the frustration should work differently .",
    "as the simplest example leading to the singlet ground state we consider the case where @xmath12 is a negative constant @xmath329 independent of the distance . then the heisenberg model can be solved exactly since the energy is given by @xmath330 where @xmath331 is the total spin of the system and @xmath332 .",
    "thus any singlet state gives @xmath333 as the ground state energy .",
    "slight modification of the range of exchange interaction lifts the degeneracy among various singlets .",
    "it appears possible that certain modification keeps one of the singlet states as the ground state .",
    "another important parameter to control the competition between different ground states is the number of components .",
    "this number @xmath62 increases from 1 for the ising model to 3 for the heisenberg model . the number 3",
    "is interpreted as @xmath334 where 2 is the spin degeneracy and @xmath335 is to remove the identity operator . in the case of four - fold degenerate cef states as in ceb@xmath4 , we have @xmath336 .",
    "@xcite in the case of tmte , on the other hand , the cef splitting seems to be very small as judged from the observed curie constant@xcite which is very close to that of tm@xmath337 , and the low - energy features observed in the inelastic neutron scattering .",
    "@xcite if we assume the degeneracy of the hund - rule ground state with @xmath338 , the number of components is as large as @xmath339 .",
    "although the susceptibility matrix breaks up into its irreducible components , the overall number of components is still a crucial parameter because of the constraint @xmath340 . in a forthcoming paper",
    "we shall report on numerical results of the static approximation for the quadrupole order .",
    "@xcite it is found there that the transition temperature to the quadrupole order is more strongly reduced from the mfa value as the number of components increases .    in summary , we have presented a self - consistent dynamical theory for quantum spins and multipoles .",
    "the theory is a natural generalization of the spherical model approximation for classical models .",
    "detailed dynamical results obtained by numerial calculation will be presented in future papers .",
