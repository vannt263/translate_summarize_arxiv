    "for a long time , the coherent control of quantum systems has been an important issue . for instance , nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) is a widely used technique for the analysis of chemical compounds and for imaging techniques .",
    "another broad field of application is the coherent control of the state of quantum dots , both in the charge and in the spin degrees of freedom . in recent years , however , coherent control has gained an even more vivid interest because it is the indispensable prerequisite in quantum information processing .    in its most basic form ,",
    "the quantum state of a single quantum bit ( qubit ) is to be changed in a given way .",
    "this is called a single qubit gate .",
    "a qubit is a two - level system which can be conveniently seen as @xmath2 system .",
    "so we use this spin language to describe the qubit gates .",
    "the two most common gates are the @xmath0 pulse , which flips the spin from up to down and vice - versa , and the @xmath3 pulse or hadamard gate , which rotates the spin by @xmath4 away from the @xmath5 direction .",
    "the @xmath0 pulse is particularly interesting for dynamic decoupling @xcite . in a nutshell",
    ", this technique aims at decoupling the single qubit from its environment as well as possible by switching the qubit state by single qubit gates .",
    "mostly , the @xmath0 pulse is considered .",
    "the idea comes from the spin - echo technique in nmr where a @xmath0 pulse is used to refocus the precessing magnetization . in nmr",
    ", the use of sophisticated protocols of @xmath0 and @xmath3 pulses is common to suppress unwanted couplings between nuclear spins @xcite .",
    "experiments using @xmath0 pulses have obtained many encouraging results in prolonging the coherence time of a qubit @xcite .",
    "more complex pulse sequences based on @xmath3 pulses have also proved useful by deminishing the rate of decoherence in quantum registers considerably @xcite .    in the theoretical treatments",
    "the generic ingredient to dynamic decoupling is an idealized pulse , mostly a @xmath0 pulse , which is considered to be instantaneous .",
    "this means that its amplitude is infinite in the sense of a @xmath6-function .",
    "this assumption is convenient because the hamiltonian @xmath7 of the pulse and the hamiltonian @xmath8 of the system at rest do not commute in general .",
    "the hamiltonian @xmath8 comprises the hamiltonian of the qubit itself , the hamiltonian of the environment ( henceforth called `` bath '' ) and the coupling between the qubit and the bath which is responsible for its decoherence . but during the pulse @xmath7 dominates and @xmath8 is negligible and for the rest of the time only @xmath8 is present .",
    "hence it is relatively straightforward to deal with the time evolution .    experimentally , however , this idealized situation is not realistic .",
    "the real pulses are always of finite amplitude and of finite length .",
    "so the question has to be addressed which effect a finite pulse duration @xmath9 has .",
    "we want to elucidate this issue in the present work theoretically in a fully quantum mechanical framework .",
    "the issue of pulses of finite duration and finite amplitude has been considered in other papers .",
    "viola and knill generalized their previous approach of averaging over a symmetry group @xcite by instantaneous changes of the effective hamiltonian to continuous changes requiring only finite , bounded control amplitudes @xcite .",
    "but the presence of the coupling to the bath _ during _ the pulses has not been considered .",
    "khodjasteh and lidar considered the effect of finite pulse duration in a comprehensive comparison of various schemes for @xmath0 pulse sequences @xcite .",
    "they did not consider to make the detrimental effects of the finite pulse duration vanish on the level of the individual pulse , but they discussed possible cancellations on the higher hierarchical level of the pulse sequence . in the present work , we will choose another route and aim at reducing the decoherence due to finite pulse duration already on the level of the single pulse .",
    "as a side remark , we note that the statement in ref .   on optimized pulse sequences @xcite that they hold only for bosonic bath operators",
    "is very likely not to be correct .",
    "it has been conjectured very recently by lee et al .",
    "@xcite that the optimized sequences apply to the most general phase decoherence model .",
    "very recently , the effect of _ classical _ random telegraph noise during pulses of finite length has been discussed numerically @xcite .",
    "it was shown that shaping the pulse amplitude in a particular way can be used to improve its performance .",
    "this means that one can optimize the pulse such that its effect is closer to the desired one , e.g.  a @xmath0 pulse .",
    "tuning pulses by shaping them is a possibility of optimization which has been discussed intensively in the vast literature on nmr .",
    "but the objectives were mostly different from the consideration of the effects of a bath .",
    "for instance , geen and freeman aimed at frequency selectivity @xcite , i.e.  the pulse should act only on spins on or close to resonance , but leave others unchanged .",
    "closest to our scope are the investigations by tycko @xcite , cummins et al .",
    "@xcite , and brown et al .",
    "@xcite where composite pulses are optimized to be robust against off - resonance effects and pulse length inaccuracies .",
    "again , no dynamic but only static effects are considered .",
    "interestingly , we will see that some of the pulse shapes fulfilling the conditions in first order derived here for fully dynamical baths coincide with pulse shapes previously derived to compensate static effects .    in this work ,",
    "we present a systematic expansion in the pulse duration @xmath9 considering a qubit coupled to a fully quantum mechanical and dynamical bath .",
    "this means that the related energy scale @xmath10 ( @xmath11 is set to unity for simplicity ) is considered to be very large so that all other energy scales , namely the coupling @xmath12 between qubit and bath and the internal energy scale of the bath @xmath13 , are small relative to @xmath14 .",
    "we expand in @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "the zeroth order is the instantaneous pulse .",
    "we compute the first and the second order and discuss the conditions for which they vanish .",
    "these conditions allow us to predict pulse shapes which approximate instantaneous pulses in spite of their finite pulse duration .    we emphasize that it is not our primary aim to eliminate the coupling between qubit and bath . on the contrary",
    ", it turns out that the expansion around the instantaneous pulse keeps this coupling .",
    "but the coupling to the bath is disentangled from the actual pulse .",
    "they are expressed by separate , subsequent time evolution operators . given the thus optimized pulse shapes ,",
    "the coupling to the bath can be compensated on the higher hierarchical level of an appropriate pulse _ sequence _ ,",
    "i.e. , by dynamic decoupling @xcite",
    ".    the paper is organized as follows . after introducing the model ( sect .",
    "ii ) , we start describing the method we used to derive our general equations for the first and second order ( sect .",

    ", we define also @xmath40 .",
    "the aim is to replace the real pulse given by @xmath21 by an approximately equivalent instantaneous pulse acting at the instant @xmath24 , see fig .",
    "the equivalence shall hold up to linear order or quadratic order in @xmath9 .",
    "we highlight that the time evolution before and after the equivalent instantaneous pulse shall be governed by @xmath8 , i.e. , including the decohering interaction between qubit and bath . this shall be accounted for on the higher hierarchical level of appropriate pulse sequences .",

    "[ fig - cont - symm ] the above statement is illustrated that the composite pulses require only smaller amplitudes .",
    "but the continuous pulses in fig .",
    "[ fig - cont - symm ] are much smoother and , hence , do not spread so much in frequency space .",
    "it depends on the actual constraints in experiment which kind of pulse is the most advantageous .",
    "[ [ asymmetric - pulses-1 ] ] asymmetric pulses + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    for completeness , we also consider an ansatz allowing for asymmetric continuous pulses @xmath183 the resulting solutions of the conditions ( [ linorder ] ) are plotted in fig .",

    "the values of the parameters are given in the caption .",
    "naturally , the instant of the equivalent instantaneous pulse is no longer in the middle of the pulse @xmath184 .     and @xmath3 pulses in the asymmetric case .",
    "for the @xmath0 pulse , the parameter @xmath169 as defined in the ansatz ( [ ansatz - cont - asym ] ) takes the value @xmath185 and the position @xmath24 of the equivalent ideal pulse takes the value @xmath186 . for the @xmath3 pulse ,",
    "the parameter @xmath169 is @xmath187 and the position @xmath24 of the equivalent ideal pulse is @xmath188 .",
    "the horizontal lines indicate the amplitude for a totally constant , uncorrected @xmath0 pulse ( solid line ) and @xmath3 pulse ( dashed - dotted line ) , respectively . ]",
    "in this paper , we have investigated under which conditions it is possible to shape the pulses implementing single qubit gates such that they correspond to ideal , instantaneous pulses ( cf .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) . to this end , we computed the corrections in powers of @xmath8 , the hamiltonian containing the coupling to the bath and the dynamics of the bath , to the equivalence @xmath189 the expansion in powers of @xmath8 is an expansion in the shortness of the total pulse .",
    "no assumption about the nature of the bath is made so that our results are very generally applicable .",
    "we have derived the explicit expression for the corrections in linear order in @xmath8 as well as those quadratic in @xmath8 . in the evaluation of the expressions found we focussed on the @xmath0 pulse and the @xmath3 pulse .",
    "they are by far the most important ones for all kinds of applications .",
    "the @xmath0 pulse is used to flip spins or qubits . an important application are spin echo experiments and , more generally , dynamic decoupling of two - level systems from their environment @xcite .",
    "the @xmath3 pulse generates in nmr experiments the precessing magnetic field and is used in many intricate pulse sequences to suppress the effect of unwanted interactions @xcite . in the context of quantum information , the @xmath3 pulse realizes the important hadamard gate .",
    "we found and showed a multitude of pulse shapes which are correct in linear order , i.e.@xmath190 the pulses can be chosen piecewise constant which requires the lowest amplitudes .",
    "they imply , however , jumps which deteriorate the frequency selectivity @xcite .",
    "continuous and continuously differentiable pulses can also be realized and they have a much better frequency selectivity .",
    "their drawback is that the maximum amplitude required is larger than for the piecewise constant pulses .",
    "we noted that our objective ( [ goal ] ) happens to coincide with the one of earlier work @xcite for a @xmath0 pulse with @xmath191 applied to a completely static bath , i.e. , a bath without internal dynamics .",
    "one reason for this coincidence is that in leading order the internal bath dynamics does not play a role .",
    "the commutators between different bath operators occur only in second order .",
    "hence the corresponding corpse and scorpse pulse fulfill also the conditions derived in the present paper . in general , however , the coincidence does not hold , i.e.  if @xmath192 or if the bath is not static in the above sense or if pulses with angles @xmath166 different from @xmath0 are considered .",
    "moreover , we emphasize that for dynamic baths without static components , i.e. , baths with internal dynamics , the aim to make the coupling between qubit and bath vanish altogether , i.e.   @xmath193 , can not be fulfilled for general angle @xmath194 .",
    "investigating the quadratic order , we could prove that @xmath0 pulses can not be corrected in this order .",
    "for @xmath3 pulses we have not found any solution in spite of intensive search .",
    "hence we are led to conjecture that no such solution exists .",
    "it would be interesting to find a mathematical foundation for this conjecture . even in linear order ,",
    "it is not possible to shape the pulse in such a way that it corresponds to an ideal , instantaneous pulse at the very end of the real pulse .",
    "this would have been a nice property for nmr measurements since it would have permitted to measure directly after a given pulse without further delay .",
    "one may , however , use asymmetric pulses which correspond to ideal pulses at about 77% of the total pulse length .",
    "the message from our findings is that pulses can be shaped such that they approximate ideal , instantaneous pulses .",
    "the required pulse shapes have to fulfill rather simple analytic integrals so that everyone can fine - tune his pulse shape easily himself .",
    "the optimized @xmath0 pulses are an excellent starting point for optimized dynamic decoupling schemes @xcite .",
    "mttnen et al .",
    "@xcite have posed themselves a similar question for @xmath0 pulses as we have done .",
    "the main differences are that they investigated classical noise numerically while we tackled a fully quantum mechanical model by analytical means .",
    "another difference is that they aimed at @xmath195 whereas our goal was _ not _ to make the bath vanish , but to disentangle it from the actual pulse , i.e. , the coupling between qubit and bath is still present before and after the idealized pulse . of course",
    ", in a model of classical noise there are no bath operators which do not commute so the mere disentanglement is trivially given in the model studied by mttnen et al .. we found that @xmath195 and @xmath196 coincide for baths without internal dynamics .",
    "for these special cases , our pulse shapes agree with those previously found @xcite .",
    "for instance , the scorpse pulse appears to be a very good choice .",
    "further work should simulate the proposed pulse shapes in specific models in order to understand better how important the neglected corrections in second order really are .",
    "it is to be expected that for small values of @xmath12 ( generic coupling to the bath ) and @xmath13 ( generic frequency of the bath ) the corrected pulses are superior to the simple , uncorrected ones .",
    "but if the characteristic times of the bath are too short , presumably the simple pulses will be better ."
