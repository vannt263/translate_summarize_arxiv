    "for a long time , the vertically thickened inner regions of disc galaxies have been referred to as `` bulges '' , for straightforward descriptive reasons . for almost as long , these have been understood to be spheroidal , kinematically hot structures , akin to elliptical galaxies .",
    "however , peculiar exceptions have also been known for some time  in particular , cases where bulges seen in edge - on galaxies have a distinctly `` boxy '' or even `` peanut - shaped '' morphology .",
    "a series of imaging studies @xcite gradually demonstrated that such structures are actually quite common ; ltticke et al .  found that @xmath12% of edge - on bulges in s0sd galaxies are boxy or peanut - shaped .",
    "even the galaxy s own bulge has turned out to be boxy ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the peculiarity is not just morphological : several early stellar - kinematic studies noted that strongly boxy or peanut - shaped bulges exhibited _ cylindrical _ stellar rotation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , something not at all characteristic of elliptical galaxies .",
    "although several models have been proposed for boxy or peanut - shaped bulges , such as their being the results of minor mergers ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the most successful explanation has come from investigations of bar formation and evolution .",
    "a pioneering 3d @xmath4-body study by @xcite noted that the bars which formed in their simulation showed `` a peanut - shape morphology '' when the model was viewed edge - on with the bar perpendicular to the line of sight , an appearance similar to classic peanut - shaped bulges in systems such as ngc  128 . in the early 1990s ,",
    "simulations of galaxy discs clearly showed that a vertically unstable `` buckling '' phase often followed the formation of a bar ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; the morphology and cylindrical kinematics of the resulting structure matched observations of boxy and peanut - shaped bulges ( see @xcite and @xcite for reviews ) .",
    "this rapid , asymmetric buckling phase is usually assumed to be driven by a global bending instability ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "however , alternate formation mechanisms which involve the resonant heating or trapping of stellar orbits have been suggested @xcite    other theoretical studies have investigated the underlying orbital structure which may support this morphology ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , explored conditions under which it may be promoted or suppressed ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and even suggested that multiple phases of buckling and vertical growth can take place @xcite .",
    "evidence confirming the association of bars with boxy / peanut - shaped ( b / p ) bulges in real galaxies has come primarily from spectroscopy of edge - on galaxies .",
    "the major - axis kinematics of ionized gas @xcite and stars @xcite in edge - on galaxies with boxy or peanut - shaped bulges displays the characteristic imprint of bars , as predicted by orbital analyses and simulations , both pure @xmath4-body @xcite and hydrodynamical ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "( note , however , that the appearance of this feature in gas kinematics requires that the so - called @xmath13 orbit family be present , which requires that the bar have an inner lindblad resonance , something not all bars necessarily have . ) in addition , near - ir imaging of edge - on systems indicates that b / p bulges are accompanied by larger - scale extensions in the disc of the galaxy , suggestive of the vertically thin outer zones of bars @xcite .",
    "the frequency of boxy and peanut - shaped bulges is consistent with most barred galaxies having vertically thickened inner regions @xcite .",
    "finding b / p bulges is relatively easy in edge - on galaxies  provided the features are strong and not overwhelmed by a large classical bulge , _ and _ that the bar is favorably aligned : i.e. , close to perpendicular to the line of sight .",
    "( as the bar orientation shifts closer to end - on , the projection of the b / p bulge becomes rounder and thus harder to distinguish from a classical bulge .",
    ") however , measuring the characteristics of the rest of the bar  its length , orientation , strength , shape , etc .",
    " is much more difficult , both due to dust extinction and to the superposition of stellar light from various regions of the disc along the line of sight .",
    "this same difficulty in identifying and measuring the `` flat '' , planar parts of bars also makes it difficult to find examples of galaxies with bars which have _ not _ buckled .",
    "it would clearly be useful if there were a way to identify the b / p structure in face - on bars , or even in bars of moderately inclined galaxies , where the in - plane structure of the bar and disc is still discernable .",
    "one promising approach is the direct detection of stellar - kinematical features associated with b / p bulges in less inclined galaxies , as proposed by @xcite .",
    "@xcite demonstrated that this is possible by detecting the kinematic signature of a b / p structure in the low - inclination ( @xmath14 ) barred galaxy ngc  98 .",
    "however , this method is most useful when the galaxy has a very low inclination ( @xmath15 ) , and it requires high - s / n spectroscopy and expensive allocations of telescope time ( e.g. , @xmath16h on 810m - class telescopes ) .",
    "the standard approach for identifying b / p structures from imagery has been to look at very highly inclined or edge - on galaxies ; minimum inclinations of @xmath17 or 80 have been suggested ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . there",
    "_ have _ been isolated reports of b / p structures in images of galaxies which are highly inclined but not actually edge - on ( i.e. , inclinations @xmath1885 ) .",
    "@xcite noted the peculiar `` inner hexagonal zone '' of ngc  7020 ( @xmath19 ) , even going so far as to suggest a possible connection with box / peanut - shaped structures from the simulations of @xcite .",
    "a few years later , @xcite pointed out the case of ngc  4442 ( @xmath20 ) , which they explicitly identified as hosting a thickened bar with projected isophotes similar to those of the b / p structure in the @xmath4-body simulations of @xcite ; they also found evidence for cylindrical rotation in the stellar kinematics , similar to that seen in the simulations .",
    "likewise , @xcite identified the bar of ngc  7582 ( @xmath21 ) as hosting a peanut - shaped bulge .",
    "more recently , @xcite used a relatively deep 2mass image of m31 ( @xmath22 ) to show that it , too , has a boxy bulge embedded within a longer bar ( see also * ? ? ? * ) . by comparing isophotes and surface - brightness profiles from cuts parallel to the major axis of the galaxy with isodensity contours and parallel cuts from a selection of @xmath4-body simulations",
    ", they demonstrated that the morphology of m31 immediately outside its classical bulge was consistent with that of a bar having both a b / p structure and an outer , flatter region seen at high inclination and a slight offset with respect to the galaxy s major axis .",
    "( they also found similarities between m31 s gas kinematics and predictions from gas flow in barred - galaxy simulations . )    in this paper , we demonstrate that there is a consistent set of isophotal features which makes identification of b / p bulges in images of _ moderately _ inclined ( @xmath23 ) galaxies quite possible , and that numerous examples of galaxies with these features exist .",
    "we find that b / p structures can be identified in images even when the inclination is as low as @xmath24 .    throughout this paper ,",
    "we assume a hubble constant of @xmath25 km s@xmath26 mpc@xmath26 .",
    "in the course of this study , we use the words `` box '' and `` boxy '' rather often , in reference to several related phenomena . for clarity",
    ", we will use the terms * boxy / peanut - shaped bulge * and * b / p structure * to refer to a specific 3d stellar structure : the vertically thickened inner part of a bar , as discussed above .",
    "we will also use the terms * boxy bar * and * box+spurs * : these refer to a _ 2d _ morphological feature seen in the isophotes of moderately inclined galaxies .",
    "much of this paper is devoted to demonstrating that the existence of the former ( 3d ) structure explains the presence of the latter ( 2d ) phenomenon in real galaxies .",
    "-band isophotes from @xcite ; * bottom panel : * close - up of the bar , showing isophotes from an archival _ spitzer _ irac1 ( 3.6@xmath27 m ) image .",
    "the broad , nearly rectangular region in the inner part of the bar is the `` box '' , labelled in red ; the narrow `` spurs '' projecting outside make up the outer part of the bar and are labelled in blue . in both panels",
    "n is up and e is to the left .",
    "[ fig : box+spurs ] ]",
    "we begin by discussing a peculiar morphology seen in some moderately inclined galaxies .",
    "figure  [ fig : box+spurs ] shows a characteristic example : the sba galaxy ngc  5377 , which has a strong bar with a radial size of @xmath28 and a position angle on the sky of 45 .",
    "the inner part of the bar ( @xmath29 ) has isophotes which are rather broad and distinctly `` boxy '' in shape  in this particular case , almost rectangular . at larger radii",
    ", the isophotes of the bar appear as narrower projections outside the boxy zone ; we term these projections `` * * spurs * * '' . as we will discuss below",
    ", these narrower projections are almost always slightly offset from the major axis of the inner isophotes .",
    "we call this composite phenomenon the `` * * box+spurs * * '' or `` * * boxy - bar * * '' morphology ; three more examples can be seen in figure  [ fig : offset - spurs ] .",
    "@xcite recently noted the presence of bars with `` boxy / peanut / x - shaped structures ( b@xmath30 ) '' in a handful of moderately inclined galaxies , including ngc  5377 ; this is undoubtedly the same thing .    a list of nearby galaxies showing this morphology is given in table  [ tab : galaxies ] .",
    "this list  which is not meant to be comprehensive or complete  is based on inspection of a variety of data sources , including the sloan digital sky survey ( data release 7 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , as well as images available via ned , including those from @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "we also identified some candidates by examining published isophotal maps , including those of @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "three galaxies not already in our list were added from the set of non - edge - on galaxies with `` b@xmath30 '' classifications in @xcite .    [ cols= \" < , < , < , < , < , > , < ,",
    "< , < \" , ]      we analysed the best available images for all galaxies in the sample to determine if they showed evidence for the boxy - bar morphology ; we counted both the strong examples discussed in section  [ sec : boxy - bars ] and weaker examples suggested by some of the @xmath4-body projections ( e.g. , cases where the spurs are short and/or project from corners of the boxy zone ) .",
    "our primary method of analysis was visual inspection of the images , and of isophote contour plots derived from the images .",

    "after _ this analysis , using galaxies identified visually , including those found in this sample . )    for dust - free s0 galaxies , we generally used red ( @xmath31 , @xmath32 , or @xmath33 ) optical images from the sdss ( dr7 ) or from other sources discussed in @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite . for galaxies with dust obscuration in the bar region  including almost all of the spiral galaxies ",
    "we used near - ir imaging from a variety of sources , the most common being _ spitzer _ irac1 ( @xmath34 m ) images from ned or from the _ spitzer _ archive .",
    "most of the _ spitzer _ images are part of the _ spitzer _ survey of stellar structure in galaxies ( * ? ? ?",
    "* s@xmath35 g ; ) ; other sources included sings @xcite , and the _ spitzer _ local volume legacy @xcite .",
    "we also used @xmath36 and @xmath37 images available from ned ( mostly higher in resolution or s / n than irac1 images ) , including those from @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite , and a set of @xmath38 and @xmath36 images taken with the ingrid imager on the william herschel telescope ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . finally , for some galaxies with particularly small bars ( e.g. , ngc 4102 ) we used archival _",
    "hst _ nicmos2 and nicmos3 images , mostly obtained with the f160w filter .",
    "the median resolution of the images we used was fwhm @xmath39 , with a range of 0.52.0 ( excluding the five galaxies for which we used _",
    "hst _ nicmos2 or nicmos3 images ) .",
    "the primary results of our analysis are coded in table  [ tab : wiyn ] , where we indicate whether or not the bar of each galaxy has a boxy interior , and if so , whether it has spurs and whether the spurs are offset relative to the boxy zone .",
    "less certain classifications are indicated by question marks .",
    "the offset of the spurs is defined as leading or trailing based on the sense of spiral arm rotation ; this is not possible for some galaxies , such as s0 galaxies where the absence of dust lanes and spiral arms prevents us from determining a sense of rotation for the galaxy .",
    "the left panel of figure  [ fig : wiyn - inc - deltapa ] shows how the fraction of galaxies with boxy - bar morphology depends on galaxy inclination .",
    "as we would expect , the fraction rises as we go to higher inclinations ; for @xmath40 , roughly half of the bars have boxy interiors .",
    "what is perhaps unexpected is how _ low _ in inclination one can go and still detect boxy interiors : there are two galaxies with inclinations @xmath41 where we find evidence for the boxy - bar structure : ngc  1022 ( @xmath42 ) and ngc  7743 ( @xmath43 ) .    the right panel of the same figure shows the fraction of galaxies which have boxy - bar morphologies as a function of @xmath44 , using the deprojected position angles .",
    "the boxy - bar morphology is clearly most common when the relative position angle is between 10 and 40 , and is rare for @xmath45 .",
    "if we divide the sample into galaxies with @xmath46 ( 35 total ) and galaxies with @xmath47 ( 43 total ) , the boxy - bar fractions are @xmath48% and @xmath49% , respectively , though the statistical significance of this difference is marginal ( fisher exact test @xmath50 ) .",
    "our analysis of the @xmath4-body simulations suggests that detection of the b / p structure is maximized both when the inclination is high and when the bar is closer to the major axis than to the minor axis .",
    "so if we are interested in finding out how common b / p structures are in our local sample , it makes sense to restrict ourselves to a subset of galaxies with reasonably high inclinations and low values of @xmath44 .    for galaxies with @xmath51 and @xmath46",
    ", we find that @xmath52% show at least a boxy interior ; @xmath53% of the subsample show both a boxy interior and distinct spurs .",
    "( if we increase the inclination limit to 50 , the frequencies become @xmath54% and @xmath55% , respectively . )",
    "this suggests that , roughly speaking , at least two - thirds of s0sb bars have buckled or otherwise thickened and produced b / p structures",
    ". the fraction may well be higher if some of the bars have relatively weak b / p structures , which do not produce a strong projected signature when the inclination is lower ; significant bulges or central discs can potentially also weaken the apparent signature .",
    "we consider the possibility of identifying individual galaxies which might lack b / p structures altogether in section  [ sec : not - buckled ] .",
    "for the 24 galaxies in our local sample where we found boxy - bar signatures , we measured the size of the boxy region @xmath56 , as described in section  [ sec:3d ] . in absolute terms ,",
    "@xmath56 ranges from 0.37 to 3.79 kpc , with a mean of @xmath57 kpc ; these sizes are deprojected using the ellipse - fit position angle corresponding to the boxy region .    however , what is probably more interesting is the question of how much of any given bar is vertically thickened . to investigate this , we calculated the size of the boxy region relative to the length of the bar .",
    "all the local - sample galaxies have bar measurements in @xcite or @xcite : @xmath58 and @xmath59 ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for definitions and comparisons with @xmath4-body measurements ) .",
    "of the two bar - length measurements , @xmath59 is probably more relevant , since it attempts to measure the full length of the bar ; @xmath58 ( the semi - major axis of maximum ellipticity ) is a lower limit which in most cases underestimates the true bar length . to compare @xmath56 with @xmath59 , we deprojected both measurements ; the deprojection of @xmath56 was as described in the previous paragraph , while the deprojection of @xmath59 used the bar position angle from @xcite or @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig : relative - sizes - hist ] shows the distribution of @xmath60 for our local sample . for the complete sample , we find a mean size of @xmath61 ( median = 0.37 ) ; for the restricted subset of 15 galaxies with @xmath46 , @xmath62 ( median = 0.43 ) .",
    "thus , it appears that on average box / peanut structures extend to slightly less than half the bar length .",
    "values of @xmath60 range from a low of 0.26 ( 0.29 for the @xmath46 subset ) to a maximum of 0.58 . given the relatively narrow distribution in figure  [ fig : relative - sizes - hist ] ,",
    "it is not surprising that @xmath56 and @xmath59 are strongly correlated ( spearman @xmath63 , @xmath64 for the complete local sample = probability of an @xmath32 value this high or higher under the null hypothesis of no true correlation . ] ) .",
    "if we include an additional twelve galaxies not in our sample where we have measured both @xmath56 and @xmath59 , the statistics do not change significantly : @xmath65 ( median = 0.38 ) .",
    "if , instead , we use @xmath58 for the bar size , the mean values are @xmath66 for the local sample with @xmath46 and @xmath67 for all values of @xmath44 .    the only previous attempt to compare b / p sizes to bar sizes for a sample of galaxies",
    "is that of @xcite , who measured various structures in near - ir images of edge - on galaxies . for six galaxies where there was a clear peanut - shaped bulge and a shelf in the mid - plane surface - brightness profile ( suggesting a bar )",
    ", they measured both `` bpl '' ( the box / peanut length ) and `` bal '' ( the bar length ) . since the latter was measured at the point where the bar excess appeared to merge with the outer exponential disc , it probably corresponds ( approximately ) to our @xmath68 .",
    "inverting their bal / bpl measurements to get an equivalent to @xmath60 yields a median value of 0.38 and a mean of @xmath69 .",
    "this is essentially identical to our findings when we use @xmath59 to define the bar size , and is a nice confirmation of the idea that our measurement of @xmath56 in moderately inclined galaxies does indeed map to measurements of the off - plane structures of edge - on galaxies .",
    "the mean value and range of relative b / p sizes in our sample is also in very good agreement with the predictions from simulations .",
    "for the three simulations we present in this paper , we find ( using the same measurement techniques ) @xmath70 for runs a and b and 0.29 for run c. similarly , @xcite reported a relative size of 0.40 from their edge - on analysis of an @xmath4-body simulation originally produced by @xcite . and @xcite reported relative b / p sizes ( their @xmath71 ) of 0.30.6 for a set of three @xmath4-body simulations , sampled at two different times each .",
    "we can also use the observational results as tests for future theoretical studies : simulations which produce relative b / p sizes @xmath72 will probably not be good matches to the majority of barred galaxies , though we can not rule them out as possible extreme cases .",
    "finally , the fact that b / p bulges typically span less than half the length of the bar helps answer objections which have sometimes been raised to the idea that b / p bulges in edge - on galaxies are due to bars .",
    "for example , @xcite argued that evidence for flat ( outer ) bars in a few edge - on galaxies such as ngc  4762 , and the fact that boxy bulges have smaller sizes than bars , presented `` a serious collision between simulations and observations . '' but in reality there is no such collision : both theory and observations agree that only the inner parts of bars become vertically thickened .",

    "as we have seen , the higher the inclination , the easier it is to detect the projected signature of a b / p structure  if the bar s orientation is not too far away from the major axis of the galaxy ( e.g. , figure  [ fig : n - body - grid ] ) .",
    "once the inclination becomes too high ( say , @xmath80 ) , however , it becomes increasingly hard to directly detect the presence of a bar in the galaxy disc plane .",
    "this is why it is difficult to clearly identify cases in _ edge - on _ discs where a bar has formed but has _ not _ buckled or otherwise thickened to form a b / p structure .    the best places to look , then , would be barred galaxies with moderately high inclinations ",
    "e.g. , @xmath8170  where the bar s ( deprojected ) position angle is within @xmath82 of the major axis .",
    "if such galaxies do _ not _ show indications of the boxy - bar morphology , then they are good candidates for systems with completely flat bars .    in section  [ sec : fraction ] , we used a slightly more generous limit of @xmath83 and @xmath84 when attempting to determine the frequency of the boxy - bar morphology . of the 22 galaxies in our local sample meeting those criteria , we found 14 with at least a boxy interior ( and 13 with clear spurs in addition ) , which leaves eight galaxies which might lack a b / p structure .",
    "if we increase the inclination limit to 45 , then there are six out of 16 galaxies which do not have good evidence for a projected b / p structure .",
    "most of these are galaxies with very weak , oval bars and/or evidence for rather luminous bulges , so that it is more difficult to discern clear morphological features belonging to just the bars . however , there are two systems with very strong , narrow bars and no evidence for large bulges which are our best candidates for barred galaxies without b / p structures .",
    "figure  [ fig : n3049+ic676 ] shows these two galaxies : ngc  3049 and ic  676 .",
    "they have inclinations of @xmath85 and 47 , respectively , and bars offset from the disc major axis with ( deprojected ) angles of @xmath86 and 41 , respectively . given these orientations and the strength of the bars , we should be able to see the box+spurs pattern quite clearly .",
    "but as the figure shows , there is no indication of this : the bars appear to be uniformly narrow .",
    "( a possible hint of narrow , offset spurs is visible in ngc  3049 at a radius of @xmath87 ; however , the apparent offset is in the _ wrong _ direction : towards the line of nodes rather than away from it . ) since there is no evidence for significant bulges in these galaxies  indeed , they seem to have little or no bulge at all  we can rule out the possibility of a boxy zone being lost within the isophotes of an elliptical bulge .        for comparison , figure  [ fig : n3049-sim - comparison ] shows two stages from the one of our @xmath4-body simulations : before the bar has buckled ( top panels ) , and after ( bottom panels ) . when the simulated galaxy is projected with approximately the same orientations as ngc  3049 and ic  676 ( middle and right - hand panels ) , the top panels  showing the simulation _ before _",
    "bar - buckling  are clearly better matches to the galaxies in question .",
    "this agreement suggests that the bars in ngc  3049 and ic  676 have _ not _ vertically buckled .",
    "the extremely narrow bars , along with the absence of any sizeable bulge in these galaxies , are also reminiscent of the nearly face - on ( @xmath88 ) sbd galaxy ngc  600 , where @xcite failed to find any kinematic signature of a b / p structure .",
    "very roughly speaking , then , we can put a lower limit on the frequency of vertically thin bars at @xmath89% .",
    "if we include all of the uncertain cases  galaxies with weak , oval bars or large bulges  then the upper limit would be @xmath90% . in any case",
    ", the existence of thin bars can be used to help constrain models of b / p structure formation .",
    "the resonance trapping model of @xcite , which implies that _ all _ bars should have b / p structures , evidently can not be a very common mechanism .",
    "the ability to identify both buckled and non - buckled bars in larger samples , combined with comparisons of galaxy properties between buckled and non - buckled bars , will help determine whether buckling is actually suppressed on long timescales ( e.g. , when significant amounts of gas are present , or when discs are vertically hot ) , or whether galaxies like ngc  3049 and ic  676 have simply formed their bars recently enough that buckling has not yet taken place .          although the matching of projected bar structure between @xmath4-body simulations and actual galaxies with similar orientations can be quite good ,",
    "there is a feature of the projected simulations which is rarely seen in real galaxies with moderate inclinations .",
    "specifically , the isophotes of the boxy zone often show `` pinching '' in the simulations viewed at moderate inclinations ( e.g. , the @xmath91 and 30 views at @xmath92 in figure  [ fig : n - body - grid ] ) .",
    "the cause of the pinched isophotes in the simulations is not hard to divine : it is the signature of a strong peanut structure , something which manifests more clearly as an `` x '' shape when the simulation is seen edge - on",
    ".    why do real galaxies not show such strong pinching when viewed at moderate inclinations ?",
    "the most obvious cause is probably the presence of extra stellar structure in the inner regions of these galaxies .",
    "a compact bulge  or even a compact nuclear or inner disc ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* )  will contribute rounder isophotes in the central few hundred parsecs , and the resulting summed isophotes will tend to smooth out the pinching . since our @xmath4-body simulations were prepared using pure discs ( no pre - existing bulges ) and do not include any gas or star formation , this lack of extra , rounder components in the central regions is not surprising .",
    "nonetheless , we can identify _ some _ real galaxies where boxy zone shows pinching .",
    "figure  [ fig : pinched ] shows two such galaxies with @xmath23 .",
    "a very slight hint of pinching can also ( perhaps ) be seen in the boxy zone of ic  5240 s bar ( bottom right panel of figure  [ fig : offset - spurs ] ) .",
    "-band isophotes for ngc  4293 ( top ) and ngc  7582 ( bottom ) , showing evidence for `` pinched '' isophotes in the box region ( blue arrows ; the isophotes showing this are outlined with thicker blue lines ) .",
    "both images are from @xcite ; n is up and e is to the left .",
    "[ fig : pinched ] ]      as we pointed out in section  [ sec : n - body - box - spurs ] , the offset spurs in the box+spurs morphology are due to misalignment between the bar position angle and the galaxy line of nodes .",
    "( if the spurs are symmetric , it means the bar and the line of nodes have the same position angle . )",
    "the projection effects which produce this also ensure that the visual misalignment between the inner boxy zone and the spurs is such that the spurs are always offset _",
    "away from _ the line of nodes .",
    "this means that it is possible to use the observed boxy - bar morphology to help distinguish , in a qualitative sense , between possible values of the galaxy major axis in cases where the latter is uncertain ",
    "e.g. , because the galaxy is warped , interacting , or otherwise strongly asymmetric in its outer regions .",
    "ngc  2712 is a galaxy in our local sample for which hi mapping by @xcite suggests a kinematic major - axis position angle of @xmath93 , similar to that of the ( bar - dominated ) inner disc .",
    "krumm & shane noted that `` beyond about 1 , however , the optical major axis twists to a position angle @xmath94  this change of position angle is not clearly reflected in the velocity field , but our poor spatial resolution could hide such an effect . ''",
    "the inner kinematic position angle could be affected by the bar ; on the other hand , the outer optical position angle might be the result of warping or other asymmetry in the disc .",
    "so which position angle better describes the galaxy orientation ?",
    "@xmath38-band isophotes for ngc  2712 can be seen in the upper - right panel of figure  [ fig : wiyn - galaxies ] .",
    "the spurs are strongly displaced in a counter - clockwise direction from the major axis of the boxy region ( pa @xmath95 , marked by red arrows ) .",
    "if the true line of nodes is at 10 , then this morphology is difficult to explain : the spurs should be offset only slightly , and in the clockwise direction .",
    "but if the line of nodes is instead 178 ( dashed grey line ) , then the morphology makes sense : the boxy region is slightly tilted counter - clockwise with respect to the line of nodes , while the spurs are further offset in the same direction .",
    "we have presented evidence for a common pattern in moderately inclined barred galaxies , which we term the `` boxy - bar '' or `` box+spurs '' morphology . in this morphology ,",
    "the bar is made of two regions : the interior is broad and slightly boxy in shape , while the outer part of the bar forms narrower `` spurs '' ; these spurs are almost always offset or even rotated with respect to the major axis of the inner , boxy region .    by comparison with @xmath4-body simulations",
    ", we demonstrate that this morphology results from the simultaneous projection of the vertically thickened ( `` buckled '' ) inner part of a bar  the box / peanut ( b / p ) structure  and the vertically thin outer part of the bar . while such structures are often seen in edge - on galaxies as boxy or peanut - shaped bulges ( if the bar is favorably aligned ) , we find that they can also be detected for inclinations down to @xmath96  and , in exceptional cases , as low as @xmath9730 .",
    "examination of ellipse fits to galaxies ( real and simulated ) with boxy - bar morphologies shows that a general set of criteria using @xmath98 and @xmath77 ( the @xmath99 and @xmath100 deviations from pure ellipticity ) exist for identifying most  but not all  cases .",
    "however , we argue that ellipse fits do not provide a consistent and reliable means of measuring the _ size _ of the boxy zone , and recommend direct meaasurements on images instead .    for the latter purpose , we define a visual size measurement for the boxy zone : @xmath56 .",
    "comparison of different projections of @xmath4-body simulations shows that @xmath56 does an excellent job of describing the radial extent of the b / p structure as seen in edge - on views ; consequently , we are confident that measurements of @xmath56 in real ( moderately inclined ) galaxies provides a good estimate of the extent of b / p structures .    starting with a local sample of 78 bright s0sb barred galaxies with inclinations @xmath101 , we find 24 galaxies showing some form of the box+spurs morphology .",
    "if we restrict ourselves to the subset of inclinations and relative position angles ( between bar and disc major axis ) which maximizes detection of this morphology , we estimate that at least 2/3 of s0sb bars are vertically thickened in their interiors .    using the @xmath56 measurement , we find that the b / p structure in our local galaxy sample spans a range of 0.260.58 of the full bar length , with a mean of @xmath102 ; the latter is in excellent agreement with measurements from a set of six _ edge - on _ galaxies by @xcite .",
    "this is clear evidence that when bars thicken vertically , it is only the inner one- to two - thirds ( typically just under half ) of the bar which does so .",
    "we note that the combination of being able to easily identify bars when galaxies are not highly inclined ( e.g. , @xmath103 ) and the clear features of projected b / p structures when the galaxy has an inclination @xmath104 creates a `` sweet spot '' for finding bars which do _ not _ have a b / p structure : galaxy inclination between @xmath82 and 70 and bar orientation @xmath105 away from the galaxy line of nodes . from our local sample ,",
    "we identify ngc  3049 and ic  676 as plausible candidates for galaxies with non - buckled ( uniformly thin ) bars .",
    "this implies a lower limit of @xmath106% on the fraction of bars which have not buckled .",
