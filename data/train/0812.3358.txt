    "the flux was estimated to be @xmath9 ( 90 % confidence level ) around the inferior conjunction ( infc ) of the compact object , and a flux upper limit of @xmath10 ( 90 % confidence level ) was derived at the superior conjunction of the compact object ( supc ) .    ls  5039 has also been detected in very - high - energy ( vhe : @xmath11  tev ) gamma - rays @xcite , exhibiting a periodic signal modulated with the orbital period @xcite .",
    "there are two other binary systems with robust detections in the vhe range : psr  b1259@xmath1263 @xcite and ls  i  @xmath1361@xmath14303 @xcite .",
    "evidence for tev emission has been found also in cygnus  x-1 @xcite .",
    "psr  b1259@xmath1263 is a clear case of a high - mass binary system containing a non - accreting pulsar @xcite , whereas cygnus x-1 is a well known accreting black hole system @xcite .",
    "the nature of the compact object in ls  5039 is not yet established , and the origin of the vhe emitting electrons is unclear .",
    "they may be related to a pulsar wind or to a black hole with a ( sub)relativistic jet . in the standard pulsar - wind scenario ,",
    "the severe photon - photon absorption makes the explanation of the detection of the vhe radiation problematic , at least at the position corresponding to the orbital phase @xmath15 ( see figs .",

    "however , particles may be accelerated in a relativistic outflow formed at the interaction of the pulsar and the stellar winds @xcite and radiate far from the compact object , making the pulsar wind scenario a viable option . in the microquasar scenario ,",
    "the lack of accretion features in the x - ray spectrum may be a problem unless the bulk of the accretion power is released in the form of kinetic energy of the outflow , rather than thermal emission during accretion , as in the case of ss  433 ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "at this stage , we can not give a preference to any of these scenarios , but new data , in particular those obtained with the _ suzaku _ satellite , allow us to make an important step towards the understanding of the nature of the non - thermal processes of acceleration and radiation in this mysterious object .",
    "the temporal and spectral characteristics of the x - ray emission from ls  5039 along the orbit should provide important clues for understanding the acceleration / radiation processes in this source .",
    "the fact that all previous x - ray observations of this object have incomplete coverage of the orbital period , or suffered from background contamination , is therefore rather unsatisfactory .",
    "this motivated our long , @xmath16  ks observation with the _ suzaku _ x - ray observatory @xcite , which gives us unprecedented coverage of more than one orbital period , continuously from 2007 september 9 to 15 ( see table [ tab : ls5039_obs ] ) .",

    "althought earlier observations by _ rxte _ suggested the presence of an iron emission line at 6.7 kev ( ribo et al .",
    "1999 ) , later observations by _ chandra _ and _ xmm _ could not find evidence of it ( e.g. @xcite ) . a careful study of new and longer _ rxte _ observations , using slew data to account for background emission , revealed that the earlierly reported 6.7 kev emission line is likely a background feature @xcite .",

    "the power - law continuum model parameters are fixed with the best fit values and a gaussian component is added to the power - law function .",

    "line widths are changed from 0.01  kev to 0.09  kev in steps of 0.01  kev , together with lines with larger widths of 0.15 and 0.20  kev .",
    "an equivalent width is determined at each grid point .",
    "the resulting upper - limit on the equivalent width is 40  ev with 90% confidence level .",
    "the x - ray emission observed with _",
    "suzaku _ is characterized by ( 1 ) a hard power law with @xmath17 extending from soft x - rays to @xmath18 kev , ( 2 ) clear orbital modulation in flux and photon index , ( 3 ) a moderate x - ray luminosity of @xmath19 , ( 4 ) a small and constant absorbing column density , and ( 5 ) a lack of detectable emission lines .",
    "although variable x - ray emission has been found from more than two hundred galactic binary systems , the _ suzaku _ data hardly can be explained within the `` standard accretion '' scenario where x - rays are produced by a hot thermal ( comptonized ) accretion plasma around the compact object .",
    "the lack of x - ray emission lines ( at the level of sensitivity of _ suzaku _ ) as well as the hard @xmath20 type energy spectrum of the x - ray continuum , extending from soft x - rays up to 70  kev , favors a non - thermal origin of the x - rays .",
    "this conclusion is supported by the general similarities between the properties of the observed x - rays and tev gamma - rays .",
    "namely , both radiation components require a rather hard energy distribution of parent electrons with a power - law index of @xmath21 .",
    "this directly follows from the photon index of the synchrotron radiation @xmath22 , and agrees quite well with the currently most favored interpretation of the tev gamma - rays , in which they would be produced by ic scattering off the anisotropic photon field of the massive companion star .    assuming that the tev gamma - ray production region is located at a distance from the companion star of @xmath23  cm ( i.e. the binary system size ) , and taking into account that gamma - rays are produced in the deep klein - nishina ( kn ) regime with significantly suppressed cross - section , for the well known luminosity of the optical star @xmath24",
    ", one can estimate quite robustly the strength of the magnetic field in the emission region .",
    "the numerical calculations show that the field should be around a few gauss ( see e.g. fig .",
    "5 ) . for such a magnetic field strength , the energy intervals of electrons responsible for the two emission components overlap substantially , as shown in figure  [ fig : diagram ]",
    "therefore , we are most likely dealing with the same population of parent electrons , which should be located at large distances from the compact object , in the system periphery , to prevent the severe absorption of the tev radiation and the subsequent intense emission from the pair - created secondaries @xcite .",
    "it should be noted that the observed x - ray emission is very difficult to explain as synchrotron emission produced by secondary ( pair - produced ) electron and positrons .",
    "since the pair production cross - section has strong energy dependence with a distinct maximum , for the target photons of typical energy of @xmath7  ev , the major fraction of the absorbed energy will be released in the form of @xmath25  gev electrons .",
    "thus secondary pair synchrotron emission must show a spectral break in the _ suzaku _ energy band unless one assumes unreasonably high magnetic fields , @xmath26  kg , in the surroundings of the gamma - ray emission region @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig : diagram ] shows the synchrotron and ic cooling times of electrons , as a function of electron energy , calculated for the stellar photon density at @xmath27 and for a magnetic field @xmath28  g. it can be seen that synchrotron losses dominate over ic losses at @xmath29  tev .",
    "note that the tev gamma - ray production takes place in the deep kn regime .",
    "this implies that the cooling time , @xmath30 , of electrons generating gev gamma - rays via ic scattering ( thomson regime ) is shorter than the cooling time of tev electrons responsible for producing very high - energy gamma - rays ( kn ) .",
    "the same applies for synchrotron cooling time of multi - tev electrons that produce low - energy ( mev ) gamma - rays by synchrotron radiation .",
    "one should therefore expect significantly higher mev ( synchrotron ) and gev ( ic ) fluxes than at kev and tev energies , provided that the acceleration spectrum of electrons extends from low energies to very high energies .",
    "however , in the case of existence of low - energy and very - high - energy cutoffs in the acceleration spectrum , the gamma - ray fluxes @xmath31  mev and at gev energies would be significantly suppressed .    to better understand the energy ranges of the electrons responsible for x - ray and gamma - ray production , we show in figure  [ fig : diagram ] the energy zones of electrons relevant to the _ suzaku _ , _ fermi _ , and hess radiation domains .",
    "note that the reconstruction of the average energy of electrons responsible for the ic gamma - rays depends only on the well known temperature of the companion star @xmath32",
    "k. the light green zone in figure  [ fig : diagram ] marked as `` _ suzaku _ synchrotron '' , corresponds to electrons responsible for the synchrotron photons produced in the energy interval @xmath33 . for a reasonable range of magnetic field values , the energy interval of electrons relevant for _ suzaku",
    "_ data overlap on one hand with the hess energy interval , and can overlap with the _ fermi _ one .",
    "this should allow us , in the case of detection of mev / gev gamma - rays by _ fermi _ , to considerably reduce the parameter space , in particular , to better localize the x- and gamma - ray production regions from electromagnetic cascade constraints , and derive the broadband energy spectrum of electrons and the strength of the magnetic field , both as a function of the orbital phase .",
    "formally , when x - rays and tev gamma - rays are produced by the same population of very - high - energy electrons , one should expect a general correlation between the light curves obtained by _",
    "suzaku _ and hess . in this regard ,",
    "the similarity between the _ suzaku _ and hess light curves seems to be natural .",
    "however , such an interpretation is not straightforward in the sense that two major mechanisms that might cause modulation of the tev gamma - ray signal are related to interactions of electrons and gamma - rays with the photons of the companion star , i.e. anisotropic ic scattering and photon - photon pair production @xcite , and thus can not contribute to the x - ray modulation .",
    "the x - ray modulation requires periodic changes of the strength of the ambient magnetic field or the number of relativistic electrons .",
    "note , however , that the change of magnetic field would not have a strong impact as long as the radiation proceeds in the saturation regime and synchrotron losses dominate in the relevant energy interval .",
    "one would also expect modulation of the synchrotron x - ray flux if the energy losses of electrons are dominated by ic scattering , although in such a case we should observe significantly lower x - ray fluxes .    a more natural reason for the modulation of the synchrotron fluxes would come from dominantly adiabatic losses .",
    "the adiabatic cooling of electrons in binary systems can be realized through complex ( magneto)hydrodynamical processes , e.g. due to interactions between a black hole jet or a pulsar wind with the dense stellar wind of a massive companion star ( see e.g. @xcite , @xcite ) . the orbital motion could naturally produce the modulation of adiabatic cooling of electrons around the orbit ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "note that because of the relatively small variation of the x - ray flux over the orbit , a factor of only two , the requirements for this scenario are quite modest .",
    "we note that dominant adiabatic losses have been invoked by @xcite to explain the variations of the x - ray and tev gamma - ray fluxes from the binary pulsar psr  b1259@xmath1263 .",
    "the detected power - law spectrum of x - rays with photon index around @xmath34 implies that the established energy spectrum of electrons is also a power - law with index @xmath35 .",
    "this agrees well with the hypothesis of dominance of adiabatic losses , because the adiabatic losses do not change the initial spectrum of electrons .",
    "thus the required power - law index @xmath35 implies a reasonable acceleration spectrum @xmath36 .",
    "otherwise , in an environment dominated by synchrotron losses , the acceleration spectrum should be very hard , with a power - law index @xmath37 , or should have an unreasonably large low - energy cutoff at @xmath38  tev to explain the observed x - ray spectra .",
    "obviously , adiabatic losses modulate the ic gamma - ray flux in a similar manner .",
    "however , unlike x - rays , the tev gamma - rays suffer significant distortion due to photon - photon absorption ( see e.g. @xcite ) and anisotropic ic scattering with its strong hardening of the gamma - ray spectrum @xcite .",
    "all this leads to additional orbital modulation of the gamma - ray signal , and it is likely that these two additional processes are responsible for the strong change of gamma - ray flux , much more pronounced than that seen in x - rays ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : light - curve ] ) .",
    "the _ suzaku _",
    "data presented in this paper implies a key additional assumption , namely that the accelerated electrons must loose their energy adiabatically before they cool radiatively .    in order to demonstrate that the suggested scenario can satisfactorily explain the combined _ suzaku _ x - ray and hess gamma - ray data , we performed calculations of the broad - band spectral energy distributions ( seds ) of the synchrotron and ic emission , assuming a simple model in which the same population of electrons is responsible for both x - rays and tev gamma - rays .",
    "we also assumed that the emission region has homogeneous physical conditions .",
    "this is a reasonable assumption given that we deal with very short cooling timescales ( @xmath39  s ) , thus electrons can not travel significant distances while emitting .    in the regime dominated by adiabatic energy losses ,",
    "the synchrotron x - ray flux is proportional to @xmath40 .",
    "the x - ray modulation seen by _ suzaku _ is then described by the modulation of the adiabatic loss rate . in fig .",
    "[ fig : phase ] , we show @xmath41 that is inferred from the x - ray data .",
    "the required adiabatic cooling timescales are @xmath42  s. any consistent calculation of the adiabatic cooling requires the solution of the corresponding hydrodynamical problem , and one needs to know in detail the nature of the source . at the present stage , we consider the simple example of adiabatic cooling in a relativistically expanding source . in such a case ,",
    "the adiabatic loss rate can be written as : @xmath43 with @xmath44  sec , where @xmath45 is the characteristic size of the source .",
    "the required variation of the adiabatic cooling is thus reduced to the modulation of the size of the radiation region ( @xmath46 ) .",
    "the size in turn depends on the external pressure exerted by , e.g. , the stellar wind from the massive star .",
    "the expected weaker external pressure around apastron implicitly assumed in our model would be broadly consistent with the radial dependence of the wind pressure .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : sed ] we show the seds averaged over the infc ( @xmath47@xmath48 ) and supc ( @xmath49 , @xmath50 ) phase intervals .",
    "the corresponding gamma - ray data have been previously reported by hess @xcite .",
    "since both the absolute flux and the energy spectrum of tev gamma - rays vary rapidly with phase , in order to compare the theoretical predictions with observations , we should use smaller phase bins , ideally speaking with the time intervals @xmath51  s corresponding to the characteristic cooling timescales of electrons .",
    "because of the lack of the relevant gamma - ray data available to us , we here use the x - ray and gamma - ray data integrated over @xmath52 .",
    "while this compromise does not allow us to perform quantitative studies , it can be used to make a qualitative comparison of the model calculations with observational data .",
    "the theoretical calculations of the seds are in a reasonable agreement with the observed spectra , though they do not perfectly match the gamma - ray fluxes .",
    "one can improve the fits by introducing slight phase - dependent changes in the spectra of accelerated electrons , but it is beyond the scope of this paper given the caveat mentioned above .",
    "we should also note that the calculations of low energy gamma - rays ( in the _ fermi _ domain ) are performed assuming that the injection spectrum of electrons continues down to @xmath53  gev . if this is not the case , the gamma - ray fluxes in the _ fermi _ energy domain may be significantly suppressed . on the other hand , the detection of gamma - rays by _ fermi",
    "_ would allow us to recover the spectrum of electrons in a very broad energy interval , and thus distinguish between different acceleration models .",
    "another important feature in this scenario is that a hard synchrotron spectrum extending up to a few mev , is required by the robust detection of @xmath54  tev gamma - rays from the system .",
    "a future detection of the emission at mev energies may bring important information on the presence of highest energy particles in the system .",
    "the reproduction , at least qualitatively , of the observed spectral and temporal features of the nonthermal radiation with the simple toy model supports the production of x - ray and tev gamma - rays by the same population of parent particles and allows us to derive several principal conclusions .",
    "the electron energy distribution should be a power - law with an almost constant index of @xmath55 to explain the x - ray spectra .",
    "note that in an _ isotropic _ photon gas when the compton scattering takes place in the deep kn regime such an electron distribution results in a quite steep tev spectrum with photon index @xmath56 .",
    "this does not agree with hess observations .",
    "however , the anisotropic ic provides a remarkable hardening of the gamma - ray spectrum @xcite , in particular , @xmath57 would be expected for the infc , and it has indeed been observed using hess @xcite .",
    "we also note that , to explain the vhe spectrum at supc , we have to assume that the emission region is located at a distance @xmath58  cm from the compact object , in the direction perpendicular to the orbital plane . in the standard pulsar scenario",
    ", the production region can not be located far away from the compact object , and even invoking electromagnetic cascading ( see e.g. fig . 16 in @xcite ) , one can not reproduce the reported fluxes around orbital phase 0.0 @xcite .",
    "we have found that the magnetic field strength can not deviate much from a few g. we can also derive a constraint on the size of the emission region , imposing a maximum expansion speed of @xmath3@xmath59 ( the speed of light ) , and the hillas criterion @xcite , in which the minimum size of a source capable of accelerating particles to a given energy @xmath60 is @xmath61 ( where @xmath62  cm ) , the larmor radius .",
    "this estimate yields a size of @xmath63@xmath64  cm , which agrees quite well with the estimate based on the required timescale of adiabatic cooling .",
    "note that the requirement of fast adiabatic losses imposes a strong constraint on the acceleration rate of electrons .",
    "indeed , the acceleration timescale can be expressed as : @xmath65 , where @xmath66 parametrizes the acceleration efficiency . in extreme accelerators with the maximum possible rate allowed by classical electrodynamics @xmath67 .",
    "the hess spectrum provides evidence of electron acceleration well above 10  tev .",
    "therefore , @xmath68  s is required at @xmath69  tev , which translates into @xmath70 for @xmath71  g. thus we arrive at the conclusion that an extremely efficient acceleration with @xmath72 should operate in a compact region of @xmath73 .",
    "finally , we would like to emphasize that in the scenario described here different radiation energy intervals are characterized by fundamentally different light curves .",
    "while the synchrotron x - ray modulation is caused by adiabatic losses , the light curve in gamma - rays depends critically , in addition , on effects related to interactions with the optical photons of the companion star .",
    "two of these effects , photon - photon pair production and anisotropic compton scattering are equally important for the formation of the light curve of tev gamma - rays . on the other hand , only the effect of anisotropic compton scattering has an impact on the formation of the light curve of gev gamma - rays .",
    "the difference of light curves in the x - ray and gev and tev gamma - ray intervals in this scenario is shown in figure [ fig : phase ] .",
    "the _ suzaku _ x - ray satellite has observed ls  5039 for the first time with imaging capabilities over one and a half orbits .",
    "the _ suzaku _",
    "data show strong modulation of the x - ray emission at the orbital period of the system and the x - ray spectral data are described by a hard power - law up to 70 kev .",
    "we found the close correlation of the x - ray and tev gamma - ray light curves , which can be interpreted as evidence of production of these two radiation components by the same electron population via synchrotron radiation and ic scattering , respectively .",
    "whereas there are at least two reasons for the formation of a periodic tev gamma - ray light curve , both related to the interaction with photons from the companion star ( photon - photon absorption of vhe gamma - rays and ic scattering in an anisotropic photon field ) , the modulated x - ray signal requires an additional effect .",
    "a simple and natural reason for the modulation in x - rays seems to be adiabatic losses which should dominate over the radiative ( synchrotron and ic ) losses of electrons .",
    "we demonstrate that this assumption allows us to explain , at least qualitatively , the spectral and temporal characteristics of the combined _ suzaku _ and hess data . in particular , the introduction of adiabatic losses not only provides a natural explanation for the rather stable photon index of the x - ray spectrum @xmath74 , but also allows one to approximately reproduce the tev gamma - ray spectra .",
    "the gamma - ray data require a location of the production region at the periphery of the binary system at @xmath75  cm .",
    "this constraint allows a quite robust estimate of the magnetic field of a few gauss to be derived directly from the x / tev flux ratio , and an adiabatic loss time of a few seconds to provide the dominance of adiabatic losses . in the case of a relativistically expanding source",
    ", the size of the production region should not exceed @xmath64  cm .",
    "the adiabatic cooling can not be shorter than several seconds , and correspondingly , the size of the production region can not be much smaller than @xmath64  cm , since otherwise the electrons could not be accelerated up to energies beyond 10  tev , even assuming an extreme acceleration rate close to the fundamental limit determined by quantum electrodynamics .",
    "there is little doubt that future simultaneous observations of ls  5039 with the _ suzaku _ , _ fermi _ , and hess telescopes will provide key information for understanding the nature of this mysterious non - thermal source .",
