    "the recent progresses in neutrino experiments has led us to convince the existence of neutrino masses and flavor mixing . @xcite . in this regard , of primary interest are to look for new physics candidates which are inherited not only with a natural mechanism to generate the observed neutrino mass matrix and but also with some other predictions that can be tested in the near future .",
    "one of the best - motivated models endowing such a property would be the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) with lepton number violation via r - parity breaking terms @xcite@xcite@xcite , as such models may produce lepton flavour violating signals predicted by the observed neutrino mixing and thus can be tested in future collider experiments @xcite@xcite .",
    "the particle spectrum in mssm depends on the supersymmetry breaking mechanism .",
    "one of the most popular scenarios for supersymmetry breaking is the minimal supergravity scenario ( msugra ) @xcite , which assumes a universal gaugino mass @xmath1 , a universal scalar mass @xmath2 , a universal trilinear coupling @xmath3 and @xmath4 at @xmath5 scale .",
    "this framework can successfully evade the appearance of dangerous flavor changing neutral current(fcnc ) and is highly predictive because there exist only 5 independent parameters in the model . in this work",
    ", we do complete phenomenological analysis on the masses and mixing of neutrinos and lepton number violating signature of lsp decays in the context of msugra with trilinear r - parity violation .",
    "the neutrino mass matrix is calculated up to the one - loop order , and it is studied how the predictions concerned with neutrino parameters in msugra can be probed from the collider signals . in almost all parameter space of msugra , the lsp is predicted to be a neutralino or a stau . in both cases ,",
    "we calculate the production cross section , decay rate , and branching ratios of the lsp to investigate the correlations between neutrino oscillation parameters and collider signatures from the various channels of lsp decay .",
    "let us begin by writing the superpotential in the basis where the bilinear term @xmath6 is rotated away :    @xmath7    @xmath8    where @xmath9 is r - parity conserving part , whereas @xmath10 is r - parity violating part , and we assume the dominance of @xmath11 and @xmath12 ( @xmath13 ) over the other trilinear couplings of lower generations and the universality at the gut scale is imposed . in this framework , there are 10 free parameters of the model , i.e. five conventional ones plus five r - parity violating ones ; @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the ratio of two higgs vevs .",
    "as is well known , non - universality is developed at the weak scale via rge evolution .",
    "the rge in this basis can be found in ref .",
    "non - vanishing soft terms are given by @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the dimension - two soft parameter .",
    "we note that non - trivial vevs for sneutrinos can be generated in this case . including 1-loop contributions @xmath18",
    ", we obtain the following relation which comes from the minimization condition for the scalar potential , @xmath19 where @xmath20 , and @xmath21 are 1-loop contributions generated from @xmath18 .",
    "the explicit forms of @xmath21 are presented in ref .",
    "@xcite,@xcite . introducing another variables ,",
    "@xmath22 we can obtain the relation , @xmath23 whose non - zero values are due to the neutral scalar loops .",
    "then , the tree - level mass is presented in terms of @xmath24 ; @xmath25 where @xmath26 .",
    "including 1-loop corrections , the neutrino mass matrix is written as [ neutrinoloop ] m^_ij=- _",
    "i_j ^2- ( _ i _ j + _ i _ j ) + _ ij , where @xmath27 denotes the 1-loop contribution of the neutrino self energy , and [ comentary ] _ i & = & _ _ i ^0 ( ) + _ _ i _ 3 ( )",
    "+ & & + _ _ i _ 1 ^ 0 ( ) + _ _ i _ 2 ^ 0 ( ) ,    m _",
    "= c_w^2 m_1 + s_w^2 m_2 .",
    "exact expressions of the 1-loop contributions @xmath28 are presented in ref .",
    "we note that the conventional tau - stau , bottom - sbottom loops and neutral scalar ( sneutrino / neutral higgs boson ) loops are essential to achieve a realistic neutrino mass matrix for @xmath29 , and they are given by @xmath30 it is found that the charged scalar ( slepton / charged higgs boson ) loops are important only for @xmath31 as observed in ref .",
    "@xcite , whereas the neutral scalar loops are important for all @xmath0 in our case .",
    "we have observed that the tree level masses are much larger than the 1-loop contributions in msugra , which makes it difficult to accommodate the solar and atmospheric neutrino oscillations .",
    "thus , we need some cancellation in @xmath24 so that the tree mass becomes comparable to the 1-loop contributions .",
    "then , we can obtain a desirable neutrino mass matrix the by combining the tree and 1-loop masses appropriately , but it is possible in some fine - tuned parameter space , as will be shown later . in this case , however , we lose nice predictability of atmospheric and solar neutrino mixing angles measurable in colliders .",
    "[ ratio ]    first of all , we obtain the parameter sets consistent with the solar and atmospheric neutrino data by scanning the input parameters within the ranges , 100 gev & m_0 & 1000 gev , + 100 gev & m_1/2 & 1000 gev , + 0 gev & a_0 & 700 gev , + 2 & & 43 .",
    "the ranges for @xmath32parity violating parameters we scan are given 4 10 ^ -6 & | _ 1 | & 6 10 ^ -4 , + 4 10 ^ -6 & | _ 2 |&6 10 ^ -4 , + 3 10 ^ -9 & | _",
    "1^ | & 10 ^ -4 , + 4 10 ^ -6 & | _",
    "2^ | & 10 ^ -3 , + 4 10 ^ -6 & | _ 3^ | & 10 ^ -3 .",
    "we set the signs of @xmath33 and @xmath3 arbitrary , but find that most of the allowed parameter space corresponds to the case that both signs are positive .",
    "we also find that there are strong correlations between atmospheric neutrino mixing angle and @xmath34 s . in order to account for the large atmospheric angle and small chooz angle",
    ", we should take @xmath35 .",
    "we have confirmed this by numerical calculations . in msugra scenario ,",
    "the tree level value of neutrino mass is much larger the 1-loop contributions in general , whereas the allowed parameter sets from the neutrino data are not tree - dominant at all .",
    "so we should make the tree mass terms comparable to the 1-loop contributions , and it can be possible in the case that some cancellation in @xmath36 occurs in doing so , however , we lose beautiful predictability of atmospheric and solar neutrino mixing angles measurable in colliders .",
    "fig.1 shows scattered plot of the ratio @xmath37 vs. @xmath38 in the randomly generated parameter space .",
    "the points in the region between the two dotted lines give the right value of the mass square ratio .",
    "only small set of scattered points lie in that region .",
    "we find that only small number of points among them are consistent with bi - large mixing .",
    "we note that the relative sizes of r - parity violating parameters are correlated with neutrino mixing pattern .",
    "but due to the cancellation in @xmath36 , it turns out that such a correlation is rather weak . in fig .",
    "2 , we see some correlations between the atmospheric neutrino mixing angle and @xmath39 , @xmath40 for general parameter sets although they are not very strong because many data points do not lead to tree - dominant neutrino masses . even though the correlations look so weak , we can obtain some constraints on @xmath41 from the neutrino data @xmath42 for small @xmath0 and @xmath43 for large @xmath0 in fig .",
    "3 , we plot the solar mixing angle _ vs. _ @xmath44 ratios for small @xmath0 and large @xmath0 cases , respectively .",
    "we see that there are strong correlations between the solar mixing angle and @xmath44 ratios .",
    "similar to the above case , we can get some constraints @xmath45 for small @xmath0 and @xmath46 for large @xmath0 .",
    "collecting these constraints , the solutions are found for the ranges of _ 1,2 , _2,3 & = & ( 0.1 - 2)10 ^ -4 , + _1 & < & 2.510 ^ -5 .",
    "let s summarize the results of this section .",
    "in general , in large portion of parameter space , the tree level contribution is much larger than those from 1-loop , so it is hard to get the right mass square ratio which is about @xmath47 .",
    "the solutions are possible by suppressing the tree level contributions , which arises through the cancellation in @xmath24 . in this case",
    ", the correlations between @xmath24 and mixing angles become worse .",
    "in addition to the important 1 loop correction by stau and sbottom , the neutral scalar loop can give the important contribution to the neutrino masses , through the deviation of @xmath48 from the direction of @xmath24 , which determine the tree level neutrino mass matrix .",
    "instead of those , there are stronger correlations between the atmospheric mixing angle and @xmath49 , the solar mixing angle and @xmath44 . for small @xmath50 , it is possible to probe these in collider signal .",
    "it will be shown in the next section .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     @xmath51",
    "it is expected that the luminosity of the next linear collider can reach the @xmath52 , and the center of mass energy over @xmath53@xcite@xcite .",
    "with such a capacity of the linear collider , it could be possible to prove the supersymmetric particles pair produced@xcite as well as the decay of lsp inside the detector@xcite .",
    "we present here the total cross section and decay rate for various parameter sets , and discuss the possibility to probe the structure of r - parity violating parameters constrained by neutrio data . in the previous sections we got the parameter sets which are consistent with the known neutrino data .",
    "those results suffice to determine which is the lsp , neutralino or light stau . in table",
    "i - iii , we present the results of decay rate and branching ratios .",
    "the table i shows the results for the stau lsp case with small @xmath54 .",
    "table ii and iii correspond to the neutralino lsp cases for small @xmath55 .",
    "the former is the case that only 3-body decay is permitted , whereas the latter is the case that both 2-body and 3-body decays are permitted . since the decay lengths are smaller than a few @xmath56 for all cases , it is possible to detect their decay modes in the next linear collider .",
    "firs of all , let s discuss the stau lsp cases . for small @xmath55 , @xmath57 due to the small off - diagonal part .",
    "then the light stau almost decays into leptons via @xmath58 terms in the superpotential . in this case",
    ", the following relation holds , br(e ) : br ( ) : br ( ) & & + & & |_1 |^2 : |_2 |^2 : |_1 |^2 + |_2 |^2 . thus , by observing the lepton branching ratios , one can measure the ratio of @xmath59 and @xmath60 .",
    "if this value is out of the range constrained by neutrino data , given in the last section , we can exclude this model .",
    "if @xmath61 become larger , the above relation does not hold any more because the yukawa coupling plays an important role in this case .",
    "in other words , @xmath62 can not be considered as almost @xmath63 , but should be the combination of @xmath64 and @xmath63 and then the couplings are given by the mixture of @xmath65 and @xmath66 .",
    "next , let s consider the neutralino lsp cases .",
    "the 2-body decay rates are proportional to @xmath67 , & & ( _ i z )    & & ( l_i w ) |_i|^2 . for 3-body decay modes , the lepton - quark - qurak branching ratios are proportional to @xmath67 since @xmath10 boson exchange diagrams are dominant .",
    "so we can have the following relation , br(ejj ) : br(jj ) : br ( jj ) = |_1|^2 : |_2|^2 : |_3|^2 .",
    "thus , we can obtain the information of @xmath24 ratio by measuring the branching ratios , but it is difficult to test msugra scenario for massive neutrinos via collider signals because the correlation between @xmath24 s and neutrino oscillation parameters is diminished as pointed out in the last section .",
    "similar to the stau lsp case , for small @xmath55 , @xmath68 branching ratios provide @xmath69 information on them ; & & br(e^ ^ ) : br ( ^ ^ ) : br(^ ^ ) + & & |_1 |^2 : |_2 |^2 : |_1 |^2 + |_2 |^2 [ ccc ] likewise , if we measure the above branching ratios , the models can be tested by comparing them with the range allowed by neutrino data , but since , for large @xmath55 , the terms generated from @xmath70  in the superpotential become large , and thus the above relation ( [ ccc ] ) breaks , it is impossible to test this scenario .",
    "the examples are presented in the table ii and iii .",
    "in addition , we note that @xmath48 s are rather big in all cases , which implies that some cancellations in @xmath24 s occur , as expected before .",
    "based on the recent precise experimental results for neutrino oscillations , we have studied the minimal supergravity model with the lepton number violation via r - parity violating terms @xcite .",
    "since it is impossible to account for large mixing angle solution of solar neutrino problem in msugra with only bilinear r - parity violations , we should include the general trilinear r - parity violations .",
    "so there are additional 5 parameters @xmath69 and @xmath71 besides the 5 parameters which are from the ordinary minimal supergravity model . in future collider which can reach its cm energy over 1 tev and luminosity up to 1000 @xmath72 in a year@xcite@xcite",
    ", we expect that it is possible to probe msugra without r - parity via the lsp decay .",
    "we have presented how neutrino mass matrix from msugra with r - parity violation can be constructed at the 1-loop level . from our analysis , we found that most parameter space which is consistent with neutrino data leads to 1-loop contributions as large as comparable with tree level masses .",
    "we have found the strong correlation between solar neutrino mixing angle and @xmath73 , and also between atmospheric neutrino mixing angle and @xmath74 . for searching",
    "the lsp decays , we have considered two cases in msugra , neutralino lsp and scalar tau lsp , and searched each parameter space regions by varying @xmath2 and @xmath1 . for our purpose , we have calculated the production cross section for each cases . for stau lsp case , 2-body decay modes are dominant .",
    "since stau lsp is almost @xmath63 for most parameter space , its branching ratios of the decay into top and bottom quark is negligibly small . since stau lsp decay into @xmath75 takes place via @xmath69 couplings , it is possible to obtain the information on @xmath65 s from branching fractions .",
    "we found that @xmath76 for not too large @xmath55 .",
    "for neutralino lsp cases , similar analysis has been done . unlike the stau lsp cases",
    ", neutralino lsp can decay into 3-body final states as well as 2-body decay .",
    "> from the branching fractions @xmath77 for various decay channels of neutralino lsp , we have determined the ratios of @xmath24 s , which in turn give the desirable tree level neutrino mass matrix .",
    "but , due to rather large loop contributions to neutrino masses the predictability for neutrino parameters is diminished . for small @xmath78 , we have obtained the @xmath69 s information which are strongly correlated with solar neutrino mixing angle from the branching fractions @xmath79 . but",
    "unluckily , since yukawa couplings become larger for large @xmath0 , it is impossible to get information on @xmath80 s .",
    "consequently , for both stau lsp and neutralino lsp , it is possible to probe the relations between neutrino oscillation and r - parity violating couplings from the branching fractions .",
    "but it becomes hard for large @xmath55 .",
    "thus , any observation of the sever deviation from these branching fractions in the future collider may exclude scenarios for neutrino masses in the framework of msugra with appropriate r - parity violation .",
