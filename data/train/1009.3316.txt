    "it is well known that non - radial gravity modes ( g - modes ) are responsible for the luminosity variations observed in some isolated white dwarfs ( called zz ceti stars ) in the instability strip .",
    "these g - modes are thought to be excited by a convective driving mechanism operating in the shallow surface convection zone of the star ( see brickhill 1983 ; goldreich & wu 1999 ; wu & goldreich 1999 ) .    in this paper",
    "we study the tidal excitation of g - modes in compact binary systems containing a white dwarf ( wd ) and another compact object ( white dwarf , neutron star or black hole ) .",
    "the galaxy is populated with @xmath2 wd - wd binaries and several @xmath3 of double wd - ns binaries [ nelemans et al .",
    "( 2001 ) ; see also nelemans ( 2009 ) and references therein ] .",
    "a sizeable fraction of these binaries are compact enough so that the binary orbit will decay within a hubble time to initiate mass transfer or a binary merger .",
    "depending on the details of the mass transfer process ( including the response of the wd to mass transfer ) , these ultra - compact binaries ( with orbital period less than an hour ) may survive mass transfer for a long time or merge shortly after mass transfer begins .",
    "a number of ultra - compact interacting wd - wd binary systems have already been observed [ including rx j0806.3 + 1527 ( period 5.4 min ) and v407 vul ( period 9.5 min ) ; see strohmayer 2005 and ramsay et al .",
    "recent surveys ( e.g. , sdss ) have also begun to uncover non - interacting compact wd binaries ( e.g. , badenes et al .",
    "2009 ; mullally et al .  2009",
    "; kilic et al .  2009 ; marsh et al .",
    "2010 ; kulkarni & van kerkwijk 2010 ; steinfadt et al .",
    "depending on the total mass , the systems may evolve into type ia supernovae ( for high mass ) , or become am cvn binaries or r crb stars ( for low mass ) .",
    "many of these wd binaries are detectable in gravitational waves by the _ laser interferometer space antenna ( lisa ) _ ( nelemans 2009 ) .    in this paper",
    "we consider resonant tidal interaction in wd binaries that are not undergoing mass transfer .",
    "this means that the binary separation @xmath4 is greater than @xmath5 , the orbital radius at which dynamical merger or mass transfer occurs , i.e. , [ tidallimit ] dd_2.5 ^ 1/3r , where @xmath6 is the wd mass , @xmath7 is the total mass and @xmath8 is the wd radius .",
    "this corresponds to orbital periods of pp_= 68.4  ( ) ^3/2 ( ) ^-1/2 .",
    "since wd g - mode periods are of order one minute or longer , they can be excited by the binary companion prior to mass transfer . in particular , as the binary orbit decays due to gravitational radiation , the orbital frequency sweeps through a series of g - mode frequencies , transferring orbital energy to the modes .",
    "although the overlap integral of the g - mode eigenfunctions with the tidal potential is generally quite small , a binary system that spends a long time at resonance can still excite g - modes to large amplitudes .",
    "previous studies of tidal interaction in wd binaries have focused on quasi - static tides ( e.g. iben , tutukov & fedorova 1998 ; willems , deloye & kalogera 2009 ) , which essentially correpond to non - resonant f - modes of the star . such static tides become important only as the binary approaches the tidal limit [ equation ( [ tidallimit ] ) ] .",
    "racine , phinney & arras ( 2007 ) recently studied non - dissipative tidal synchronization due to rossby waves in accreting ultra - compact wd binaries .",
    "rathore , blandford & broderick ( 2005 ) studied resonant mode excitations of wd modes in eccentric binaries .",
    "they focused on f - modes , for which the resonance occurs when harmonics of the orbital frequency matches the mode frequency . as mentioned above , for circular orbits , such resonance with the f - mode does not occur prior to mass transfer or tidal disruption .",
    "their published analysis also did not include back reaction of the excited mode on the binary orbit .",
    "the problem of resonant mode excitations in compact binaries has been studied before in the context of coalescing neutron star binaries : reisenegger & goldreich ( 1994 ) , lai ( 1994 ) and shibata ( 1994 ) focused on the excitations of g - modes of non - rotating neutron stars ; ho & lai ( 1999 ) and lai & wu ( 2006 ) studied the effects of ns rotation  including r - modes and other inertial modes ; flanagan & racine ( 2006 ) examined gravitomagnetic excitation of r - modes . in the case of neutron star binaries , the orbital decay rate ( for orbital frequencies larger than 5 hz )",
    "is large and the mode amplitude is rather small , so the back reaction of the excited mode on the orbit can be safely neglected ( see section 5 of the present paper ) . by contrast , in the case of wd binaries , the orbital decay is much slower and the excited mode can reach a much larger amplitude . it thus becomes essential to take the back reaction into account .    in this paper , we consider wd binaries in circular orbits , consistent with the observed population of compact wd binaries ( e.g. kulkarni & van kerkwijk 2010 ) . such circular orbits are a direct consequence of the circularization by gravitational radiation and/or the common envelope phase leading to their formation .",
    "a key assumption of this paper is that we assume the wd is not synchronized with the binary orbit .",
    "while it is true that the tidal circularization time scale is much longer than the synchronization time , the observed circular orbit of the wd binaries does not imply synchronization . while there have been numerous studies of tidal dissipation in normal stars and giant planets ( e.g. , zahn 1970,1989 ; goldreich & nicholson 1977 ; goodman & oh 1997 ; goodman & dickson 1998 ; ogilvie & lin 2004,2007 ; wu 2005 ; goodman & lackner 2009 ) , there has been no satisfactory study on tidal dissipation in wds . even for normal stars , the problem is not solved ( especially for solar - type stars ; see goodman & dickson 1999 ; see zahn 2008 for review ) .",
    "in fact it is likely that the excitations of g - modes and other low - frequency modes play a role in the synchronization process .",
    "the orbital decay time scale near g - mode resonances is relatively short ( of order @xmath9 years for orbital periods of interest , i.e. , minutes ) , so it is not clear that tidal synchronization can compete with the orbital decay rate . given this uncertainty , we will consider non - rotating wds ( or slowly - rotating wds , so that the g - mode properties are not significantly modified by rotation ) as a first step , and leaving the study of the rotational effects to a future paper .",

    "we present the equations governing the evolution of the orbit and the g - modes .",
    "section 3 examines the properties of wd g - modes and their coupling with the tidal gravitational field of the companion . in section 4",

    "prior to the resonance , as the orbital radius @xmath4 decreases , the mode amplitude grows gradually according to equation ( [ b0 ] ) . at the same time",

    "so , as the orbital frequency continues to increase after the resonance , the amplitude of the fluctuations becomes smaller while the frequency of the amplitude oscillations becomes higher .",
    "the results in the previous two sections neglect mode energy damping in the wd .",
    "since the duration of the resonance is much longer than the mode period [ see equation ( [ tres ] ) ] , internal mode damping could affect the energy transfer during resonance if the damping rate is sufficiently large . to address this issue",
    ", we incorporate a phenomenological damping rate @xmath142 to the mode equation ( [ eq : addot ] ) to study how mode damping affects energy transfer during a resonance .",
    "figure [ dampamp ] shows the excitation of a mode through resonance for different values of @xmath143 .",
    "we see that , as expected , when the internal damping time is larger than the resonance duration ( equation [ tres ] ) , the maximum mode energy achieved in a resonance is unaffected .     the amplitude of a mode as a function of time near its resonance for different values of the damping coefficient @xmath143 .",
    "the curves have @xmath144 ( black ) , @xmath145 ( dark blue ) , @xmath146 ( yellow - green ) , @xmath147 ( light blue ) , @xmath148 ( red ) , @xmath149 ( green ) , and @xmath150 ( purple ) . for this mode ,",
    "we have set @xmath151s@xmath152 and @xmath153 so that @xmath154s .",
    "note that the damping term does not greatly affect the maximum mode amplitude except when @xmath155 , or when @xmath156 .",
    "also note that modes with larger values of @xmath143 evolve on a much shorter time scale because their orbits decay quickly due to the conversion of orbital energy into heat via mode damping . ]",
    "g - modes in white dwarfs are damped primarily by radiative diffusion .",
    "for sufficiently large mode amplitudes , non - linear damping is also important ( e.g. , kumar & goodman 1996 ; see section [ discussion ] for more discussion on this issue ) .",
    "wu ( 1998 ) presents estimates for the non - adiabatic radiative damping rates of wd g - modes in terms of @xmath157 .",
    "extrapolating wu s values to @xmath19 modes for a white dwarf of temperature @xmath158  k , we find @xmath159 for modes near @xmath85 and @xmath160 for high - order modes with @xmath161 .",
    "so , while the maximum amplitude of low - order modes is completely unaffected by non - adiabatic effects , high - order modes will damp on time scales similar to the excitation time scale . therefore these high - order modes will attain amplitudes somewhat smaller than estimated in the previous section . this continual process of high - order mode damping",
    "may extract energy out of the orbit more efficiently than discrete resonance events , causing a steady decay of the binary s orbit .",
    "we have shown that during the orbital decay of compact white dwarf binaries ( wd / wd , wd / ns or wd / bh ) , a series of g - modes can be tidally excited to large amplitudes ( up to @xmath162 in dimensionless units ) as the orbital frequency sweeps through the resonant mode frequencies .",
    "such mode excitations can significantly affect the orbital decay rate near resonance . indeed , to properly calculate the resonant mode amplitude ,",
    "it is necessary to take into account of the back - reaction of the excited modes on the orbit .",
    "one consequence of the resonant mode excitations is that the low - frequency ( @xmath1  hz ) gravitational waveforms emitted by the binary , detectable by lisa , will deviate significantly from the point - mass binary prediction .",
    "this is in contrast to the case of neutron star binaries ( ns / ns or ns / bh ) studied previously ( reisenegger & goldreich 1994 ; lai 1994 ; shibata 1994 ; ho & lai 1999 ; lai & wu 2006 ; flanagan & racine 2006 ) , where the resonant mode amplitude is normally too small to affect the binary orbital decay rate and the gravitational waveforms to be detected by ground - based gravitational wave detectors such as ligo and virgo .    in the case of wd binaries studied in this paper , the number of of orbits skipped as a result of a resonant mode excitation is [ norbit ] n _ = , where @xmath106 is the gravitational wave decay time scale given in equation ( [ td ] ) ,",
    "@xmath163 is the orbital period , and @xmath164 is the orbital energy at resonance . using equation ( [ eq : emax ] ) for @xmath165 , we find @xmath166 the number of skipped orbital cycles should be compared to the number of orbits in a decay time , expressed by @xmath167 the huge number of skipped orbital cycles implies that such a resonant interaction would be important , but because the number of skipped orbital cycles is much smaller than the number of orbital cycles in a decay time , resonances will not dominate the decay process .",
    "a second possible consequence of resonant mode excitations is that the large mode energy may lead to significant heating of the white dwarf prior to the binary merger . indeed , equation ( [ eq : emax ] ) shows that for typical binary parameters , the mode energy can be a significant fraction ( @xmath168@xmath0 ) of the gravitational binding energy of the star , and comparable to the thermal energy .",
    "indeed , the thermal energy of the wd is of order @xmath169 , where @xmath170 is the core temperature of the wd and @xmath171 is the mean atomic weight .",
    "the ratio of post - resonance mode energy to thermal energy is then @xmath172 this implies that the white dwarf may become bright thousands of years before binary merger .    a third consequence that may result from a resonance is significant spin - up of the wd .",
    "if we assume that all the angular momentum transferred to the wd during a resonance eventually manifests as rigid body rotation of the wd , the change in spin frequency of the wd is [ omegas ] _",
    "s = , where @xmath173 is the spin frequency of the wd and @xmath174 is its moment of inertia . plugging in our expression for @xmath165",
    ", we find @xmath175 where @xmath176 .",
    "we can thus see that a given resonance may deposit enough angular momentum to completely spin up the wd ( or significantly alter its spin ) by the time the mode damps out .",
    "this implies that mode resonances are potentially very important in the spin synchronization process .",
    "however , before these implications can be taken seriously , one should be aware of the limitations of the present study .",
    "one issue is the assumption that the white dwarf is non - rotating ( and not synchronized ) , already commented on in section 1 .",
    "more importantly , we have assumed that the white dwarf oscillations can be calculated in the linear regime .",
    "while the mass - averaged dimensionless amplitude @xmath177 of the excited g - mode is less than @xmath162 [ see fig .",
    "5 and eq .",
    "( [ eq : bmax ] ) ] , the physical fluid displacement in the stellar envelope is much larger since g - modes of white dwarfs are mainly concentrated in the outer , non - degenerate layers .",
    "figure [ xi ] gives some examples : it shows the horizontal and radial displacements of three modes at their post - resonance amplitudes .",
    "these are obtained from @xmath178 , with @xmath80 the normalized eigenfunction ( see section [ modes ] ) and @xmath179 computed from equation ( [ eq : bmax ] ) with @xmath180 . in general , the linear approximation is valid only if @xmath181 , where @xmath182 is the wkb wave number , given by [ kr ] k_r^2 . clearly , the three modes depicted in fig .  8 strongly violate the linear approximation beyond the radius @xmath183 , near the jump in @xmath51 associated with the carbon - helium boundary .     the horizontal ( solid line ) and radial ( dashed line ) displacements of the @xmath85 ( top panel ) and @xmath87 ( bottom panel ) modes as a function of radius .",
    "the physical displacements are calculated using the analytical estimates for the post - resonance amplitudes given in equation [ eq : bmax ] using @xmath184 , giving @xmath185 and @xmath186 .",
    "also shown is inverse of the wkb wave number @xmath187 ( dotted line ) . ]    therefore , the results presented in this paper should be treated with caution as nonlinear effects will likely limit mode growth . rather than increasing to the large displacements shown in figure [ xi ] , the white dwarf oscillations will undergo non - linear processes such as mode coupling that will transfer energy to high - order modes .",
    "these high - order modes have much shorter wavelengths and thus damp on very short time scales . as nonlinearity is most important in the outer layers of the white dwarf , we expect that the excited oscillation will dissipate its energy preferentially in this outer layer and will not reflect back into the stellar interior .",
    "we plan to address these issues in our next paper ( fuller & lai 2010 , in preparation ) .",
