    "there has been great recent interest in low - mass dark matter ( @xmath1 ) as a possible explanation for the event rates observed at the dama  @xcite , cogent  @xcite and cresst  @xcite experiments",
    ". however , negative results from xenon10/100  @xcite and cdms  @xcite have created some tension with these positive signals .",
    "there has been much discussion in the literature regarding experimental issues with all of this data , but the explanation is far from clear  @xcite .",
    "it is important to find new tests of this data , particularly tests that do not suffer from the same difficulties as direct detection experiments at low recoil energy .",
    "collider , gamma - ray , and anti - proton flux search strategies have been employed for this purpose  @xcite .    a promising avenue for cross - checking the low - mass direct detection data is with neutrino detectors  @xcite , which search for the flux of neutrinos arising from dark matter annihilation in the core of the sun .",
    "dark matter is captured by the sun via scattering off solar nuclei . if the sun is in equilibrium , then the dark matter capture rate determines the dark matter annihilation rate .",
    "the neutrino flux thus constrains the dark matter - nucleus scattering cross - section , and allows neutrino detectors to cross - check direct detection experiments without some of the particle physics and astrophysics uncertainties that plague other types of indirect detection searches .",
    "moreover , the @xmath2 neutrinos produced from the annihilation of low - mass dark matter are easily distinguishable at water cherenkov , liquid argon or liquid scintillator - based neutrino detectors .    in order to determine the event rate expected at a neutrino detector",
    ", one must calculate the rate at which dark matter is captured by the sun due to scattering and the neutrino spectrum arising from the decay of the dark matter annihilation products .",
    "numerical packages such as darksusy  @xcite are commonly used for obtaining these rates , which are determined from numerical simulations .",
    "however , the required simulations have not been run for masses less than 10 gev .",
    "moreover , the capture rate has only been calculated assuming that dark matter scatters elastically via a contact interaction .",
    "recent models for reconciling the low - mass direct detection data have included the possibility of dark matter scattering via long - range forces  @xcite , inelastic scattering  @xcite , and dark matter interactions which are isospin - violating  @xcite . to determine the sensitivity of neutrino detectors to these models , new capture rate calculations must be performed .    in this work , we calculate the required neutrino spectra and capture rates for low - mass dark matter in the sun .",
    "we not only consider the capture rate for elastic contact scattering , but also for inelastic dark matter and for models in which the dark matter - nucleon interaction is mediated by a low - mass particle .",
    "we also determine the regions of parameter - space of these models for which dark matter in the sun is in equilibrium .    as an application of these techniques",
    ", we consider the sensitivity of a 1 kt liquid scintillation detector with 2135 live days of data ( roughly the same exposure as kamland ) to dark matter with long - range interactions .",
    "we find that the sensitivity of neutrino detectors to dark matter with long - range interactions is enhanced , because typical scatters off low - mass targets ( such as the hydrogen and helium in the sun ) involve small momentum transfers , yielding enhanced scattering cross - sections in models where the mediating particles are light .",
    "this implies the existence of an entire class of dark matter models for which current neutrino experiments can provide the leading sensitivity .    in section",
    "ii , we review the general formalism for dark matter searches using neutrino detectors . in section iii , we describe the details of the computation of the neutrino spectrum arising from the annihilation of low - mass dark matter . in section iv , we describe the calculation of the dark matter capture rate in the sun , assuming dark matter with either elastic contact interactions , elastic long - range interactions , or inelastic contact interactions . in section v , we describe the range of circumstances under which low - mass dark matter is in equilibrium in the sun . in section vi , as an example , we apply these techniques to determine the sensitivity of a 1 kt ls neutrino detector to low - mass dark matter with long - range interactions . we conclude in section vii .",
    "the rate of charged lepton events at a neutrino detector can be written as r = _ a 4d^2 _ 0 ^ 1 dz _",
    "b_f dn_f,_i dz dv _ _",
    "i -n(z ) ( r ) ( r , z ) , where @xmath3 is the earth - sun distance , @xmath4 , @xmath5 is the nucleon number density of the detector ( including the earth around the detector , in the case of a search for throughgoing muons ) , and @xmath6 is the efficiency for a neutrino charged - current interaction to produce a charged lepton which will pass the detector analysis cuts .",
    "@xmath7 is the branching fraction to each dark matter annihilation product @xmath8 , and @xmath9 is the differential neutrino spectrum per annihilation to each final state , for each ( anti-)neutrino flavor .",
    "@xmath10 is the total dark matter annihilation rate , and @xmath11 is the ( anti-)neutrino - nucleon scattering cross - section . for dark matter in the @xmath0 range , most of the charged leptons produced in a reasonably - sized detector will be fully - contained , with the vertex where the lepton is produced and the end of the track both within the fiducial volume of the detector . as a result",
    ", we will focus on fully - contained lepton events .",
    "the quantities @xmath5 and @xmath6 are specific to the geometry and construction of the detector . for @xmath12 ,",
    "the @xmath11 can be approximated as  @xcite _ -p & & 4.51 10 ^ -3z ( m_x /  gev )  pb , + _ -n & & 8.81 10 ^ -3z ( m_x /  gev )  pb , + _ |-p & & 3.99 10 ^ -3z ( m_x /  gev )  pb , + _ |-n & & 2.50 10 ^ -3z ( m_x /  gev )  pb .",
    "the two remaining quantities we will need to compute are @xmath10 and @xmath13 .    for a search for fully - contained charged leptons , we can then write r = _ a 4d^2 _ 0 ^ 1 dz _ f,_i b_f dn_f,_i dz z a_eff.(z ) , where a_eff .",
    "( z ) & = & _ _ i -n(e_= m_x ) dv ( r ) ( r , z ) . all detector - specific information is encoded in the effective area , @xmath14 .",
    "if @xmath15 , the effect of dark matter evaporation can be important  @xcite . in that case ,",
    "dark matter in the sun s core is significantly depleted by evaporation , and the total annihilation rate is relatively small , implying that constraints on dark matter from the neutrino flux will be weak .",
    "we focus on the regime @xmath16 , for which dark matter in the sun can only be depleted through annihilation .",
    "if the sun is in equilibrium , we then find that @xmath10 is related to the dark matter capture rate , @xmath17 , by the relation @xmath18 .",
    "since @xmath17 is determined by the dark matter - nucleus scattering cross - section , the above relation allows one to translate neutrino flux bounds into bounds on the dark matter - nucleon scattering cross - section .",
    "for low - mass dark matter ( @xmath19 ) , the only dark matter annihilation products relevant for neutrino searches are heavy quarks ( @xmath20 , @xmath21 ) , @xmath22 , @xmath23 and the gluon ( @xmath24 ) .",
    "muons and light quarks ( @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 ) will tend to stop within the sun before they decay  @xcite .",
    "the resulting neutrinos are thus very soft ( though they also can potentially be used for for dark matter searches  @xcite ) .",
    "we have calculated the differential neutrino spectrum per annihilation for the relevant channels using the darksusy / wimpsim / nusigma / pythia  @xcite package .",
    "numerical simulations were run on the hawaii open supercomputing center ( hosc ) computing cluster .",
    "@xmath28 annihilations were simulated for each annihilation channel and dark matter mass in the range @xmath0 ( in increments of 2 gev ) .",
    "representative spectra are plotted in appendix a , and all of the original data files are available at http://www.phys.hawaii.edu/~superk/post/spectrum .",
    "we present the neutrino spectrum at a distance 1 au from the sun , including the effects of hadronization and decay of the annihilation products at injection , matter effects as the neutrinos propagate through the sun ( including tau - regeneration ) and vacuum oscillations .",
    "the neutrino oscillation parameters were chosen to be _ 12 & = & 33.2^ , + _ 23 & = & 45^ , + m_21 ^ 2 & = & 8.1 10 ^ -5  ev^2 , + m_32 ^ 2 & = & 2.2 10 ^ -3  ev^2 , + _ 13 & = & 10^ , assuming a normal hierarchy .",
    "this choice is consistent with recent exciting data from the daya bay experiment  @xcite indicating @xmath29 .",
    "data files for the choice @xmath30 are also available online . for this choice",
    ", the change in the neutrino spectrum is relatively small unless dark matter annihilates directly to neutrinos in a flavor - dependent way .    in the case",
    "where dark matter annihilates to @xmath20-quarks , annihilation can only proceed if the dark matter mass is larger than the mass of the @xmath20-hadron which is produced .",
    "moreover , a @xmath20-quark will lose @xmath31 of its energy during hadronization  @xcite .",
    "thus , the neutrino spectrum arising from annihilation to @xmath20-quarks is simulated only for @xmath32 . in the case where dark matter annihilates to @xmath33 , the neutrino spectrum has been computed by averaging over helicities .",
    "some dark matter candidates will preferentially decay to certain helicities , which can have a significant effect on the injected neutrino spectrum  @xcite .    the neutrino spectrum at 1 au is equivalent to the spectrum of downward - going neutrinos at the detector , averaged over the year .",
    "this spectrum determines the rate of downward going fully - contained charged leptons . in the case where the charged lepton is upward going through the earth , one should also include oscillation and matter effects as the neutrinos pass through the earth .",
    "these effects depend on the location of the detector and can be determined by inputting the neutrino spectrum at 1 au into the  wimpevent \" program , with the location of the detector specified .      in this appendix , we plot the neutrino and anti - neutrino spectra at a distance 1 au from the sun , assuming dark matter annihilation exclusively to either the @xmath164 or @xmath33 channels .",
    "each spectrum was generated by simulating @xmath28 annihilations using the method described in the text .",
    "here , @xmath183 , and neutrino oscillations are generated assuming @xmath178 .",

    "it is easiest to consider this process in the center - of - mass frame .",
    "we then find @xmath94 , where @xmath95 is the reduced mass , and @xmath96 and @xmath97 are the spatial momenta of the incoming @xmath98 and outgoing @xmath99 , respectively , in the center - of - mass frame .",
    "the phase space factor of the differential scattering cross - section is directly proportional to the outgoing momenta .",
    "again , it is not appropriate to express the dark matter - nucleus inelastic scattering cross - section in terms of the dark matter - proton scattering cross - section , since there exist kinematic regions where dark matter - proton inelastic scattering is impossible , though dark matter can scatter off other nuclei .",
    "using the fact that the recoil energy can be written as @xmath100 , we can write & = & m_a i32w^2 ^2 |f_a ( e_r)|^2 , where @xmath101 ^ 2 |f_a ( e_r)|^2 \\times i$ ] is the squared dark matter - nucleus matrix element ( summed over final spins and averaged over initial spins ) .",
    "@xmath102 is roughly constant for different elements ( up to @xmath103 corrections ) , so it makes sense to present bounds on inelastic dark matter in terms of this quantity .",
    "we also find e_max & = & m_r^2 w^2m_a ( 1 - m_x m_r w^2 + ) .",
    "similarly , we find e_min & = & where the first term is the minimum recoil energy kinematically possible in two - body inelastic scattering , and the second term is the minimum recoil energy in a process where the outgoing dark matter particle is slower than @xmath104 , the velocity to escape to radius @xmath42 .",
    "@xmath105 is determined by the constraint @xmath106 , yielding u_max^2 & = & 12 v^2 _ -^2 . finally ,",
    "we have u_min^2 = , because inelastic scattering is only kinematically possible for @xmath107 .",
    "this implies that , for @xmath108 one need only consider models with @xmath109 .",
    "it is interesting to note that , as @xmath113 increases , the rate of capture arising from scattering off light elements vanishes .",
    "this is because @xmath114 is smallest for light elements , implying that they have the smallest maximum value of @xmath113 such that inelastic scattering is kinematically allowed .",
    "it is also worth noting that inelastic scattering for low - mass dark matter is kinematically allowed in the sun for larger @xmath113 than in the earth , because dark matter within the sun has gained kinetic energy from gravitational infall . as a result ,",
    "even low - mass inelastic dark matter with @xmath115 can be potentially probed by neutrino detectors .",
    "if the effects of wimp evaporation are negligible , the equilibration time @xmath116 for dark matter in the sun can be written as  @xcite & = & 1.9 10 ^ -11 ( _ c^^-1 ) ^12 ( v pb ) ^12 ( m_x 10  gev)^34 , where @xmath117 is the age of the solar system .",
    "for the case of elastic contact interactions ( assumed to be isospin - invariant , and either spin - independent or spin - dependent ) , we plot in the top panel of fig .",
    "[ equilibrium ] the minimum @xmath60 required for the sun to currently be in equilibrium , assuming that the total dark matter annihilation cross - section is given by @xmath118 .",
    "note that , for the case of ivdm with spin - independent interactions , the @xmath60 required for the sun to be in equilibrium would lie between that required for spin - dependent scattering and that required for isospin - invariant spin - independent scattering .",
    "( top panel ) or @xmath83 ( bottom panel ) required for dark matter to be in equilibrium in the sun , assuming either elastic contact ( spin - dependent or spin - independent ) or long - range interactions , respectively .",
    "we assume that the dark matter annihilation cross - section is given by @xmath118 . ]",
    "note that the equilibration time scales as @xmath119 .",
    "ivdm with spin - independent interactions and @xmath120 could be consistent with the data of dama , cogent and xenon10/100 if @xmath121  @xcite",
    ". such dark matter can be in equilibrium in the sun even if @xmath122 .",
    "this implies that , if the ivdm candidate is a thermal relic , then it can currently be in equilibrium in the sun even if almost all of the annihilation cross - section at freeze - out was due to @xmath123-wave interactions ( suppressed at current times ) , with only a negligible amount due to @xmath27-wave interactions .",
    "we now consider an application of these tools to a specific detector .",
    "we will focus on the case of long - range interactions , because neutrino detectors are expected to have a major advantage over direct detection experiments in this instance . for both direct detection experiments and neutrino searches",
    ", the measured event rate will be proportional to the dark matter - nucleus scattering cross - section .",
    "for the case of long - range interactions , the integrated dark matter - nucleus scattering cross - section is roughly proportional to @xmath124 , where @xmath125 is the mass of the nucleus and @xmath51 is the minimum nuclear recoil energy which one can measure . for a direct detection experiment , @xmath51 is the recoil energy threshold of the experiment , and is typically of order @xmath126 . for germanium - based experiments ( such as cdms and cogent ) , @xmath127 , while for xenon - based experiments @xmath128 . for neutrino searches , @xmath51 is the minimum recoil energy such that dark matter is captured and can annihilate in the core of the sun .",
    "we thus find @xmath129 , for dark matter in the mass range considered here .",
    "however , @xmath125 is the mass of the target nucleus in the sun and is very small for some elements that contribute significantly to capture in the sun .",
    "for example , hydrogen contributes @xmath130 of the dark matter capture rate for low - mass dark matter , and @xmath131 .",
    "so one can expect the sensitivity of a neutrino search for low - mass dark matter with long range interactions to be significantly enhanced ( @xmath132 ) compared to direct detection experiments .",
    "we compare the sensitivity of liquid scintillation ( ls ) neutrino detectors to that of cdms .",
    "it was shown in  @xcite that liquid scintillation neutrino - detectors can determine the flavor and direction of leptons produced by a charged - current interaction using the timing of the first photons which reach the photomultiplier tubes .",
    "we will focus on a search for electron neutrinos producing fully - contained electron / positron events .",
    "an advantage of this strategy is that the atmospheric electron neutrino background is significantly smaller than that of mu neutrinos .",
    "it was estimated that liquid scintillation neutrino detectors can provide almost absolute lepton flavor discrimination , and electrons of the energy range we consider can be measured with an angular resolution @xmath133 .",
    "it was also estimated that the neutrino energy could be determined ( from the energy and direction of the produced charged lepton , as well as total energy deposition ) with a resolution @xmath134 .",
    "we will consider the sensitivity of a ls neutrino detector with a spherical fiducial volume @xmath135 and 2135 live - days of data ( these are roughly the specifications of kamland ) .",
    "we estimate the neutrino detector s sensitivity utilizing the procedure outlined in section ii .",
    "the density of the liquid scintillator is taken to be @xmath136 that of water . following  @xcite",
    ", we define as  fully - contained \" an electron / positron event starting within the detector with at least 10 radiation lengths ( @xmath137 ) contained within the detector .",
    "furthermore , the lepton event must point back to the sun within a half - angle @xmath138 , and the energy of the neutrino must be obey @xmath139 .",
    "we then find  @xcite dv ( r ) ( r , z ) & ~ & v_0 , where the factor @xmath140 is the fraction of lepton events which will be within @xmath141 , and the factor @xmath142 is the fraction of the fiducial volume which will yield fully - contained events .",
    "it was shown in  @xcite that , using the background estimate of  @xcite , one would expect less than 5 electron / positron events satisfying these cuts arising from atmospheric neutrinos during the specified runtime . we will thus consider a model which would produce 10 signal events arising from dark matter annihilating in the sun as being excludable .    to determine the electron ( anti-)neutrino flux at kamioka , we have used the wimpevent routine , run on the hawaii open supercomputing center cluster . of the @xmath28 dark matter annihilations",
    "which were simulated ( as described in section iii ) for each annihilation channel and value of @xmath143 , @xmath144 were used to compute the neutrino spectra at the detector .",

    "the maximum recoil energy which can be transferred to a germanium nucleus is @xmath155 .",
    "we assume a threshold energy @xmath156  @xcite .",
    "@xmath157 is the minimum dark matter velocity ( far from the sun ) such that scattering with @xmath158 is kinematically possible , and is given by the expression @xmath159 $ ] .",
    "we again assume a gaussian form factor @xmath160 ; for the recoil energy range of interest , the gaussian form factor for germanium differs from the helm form factor  @xcite by at most @xmath161 .",
    "we will assume a maxwell - boltzmann velocity distribution with @xmath162 , and that the galactic escape velocity is @xmath163 .",
    "we will also assume a constant efficiency for events with recoil energy greater than the threshold energy to appear in the cdms low - energy analysis band .",
    "due to this assumption , the result shown here should be regarded as only an estimate of the sensitivity cdms could obtain with present data to dark matter models with long - range interactions .",
    "the estimated sensitivity of cdms and a 1 kt liquid scintillation neutrino detector are plotted in figure  [ sensitivity ] . for the ls neutrino detector ,",
    "we assume 2135 live - days of data , and assume that dark matter annihilates exclusively to either @xmath33 , @xmath164 , @xmath165 , @xmath166 or @xmath167 ( with equal coupling to all three neutrino flavors ) . in  @xcite , it was shown that the sensitivity of cdms to @xmath168 dark matter with isospin - invariant elastic contact interactions is roughly an order of magnitude greater than that of a 1 kt ls detector .",
    "our calculation of the relative sensitivities of cdms and a 1 kt ls detector to dark matter with long - range interactions bears out our original estimate of a roughly @xmath169 relative enhancement in sensitivity for the ls detector .",
    "note that , for the models to which kamland would be sensitive , the sun would be in equilibrium ( see figure  [ equilibrium ] ) even if the annihilation cross - section were significantly smaller than @xmath170 ( assuming standard astrophysical assumptions ) .",
    "if the sun is not in equilibrium as a result of deviations from these assumptions , then the constraints which would be possible from neutrino detectors would be significantly suppressed .     of cdms and a 1 kt ls detector ( 2135 live days of data ) for low - mass dark matter with isospin - invariant elastic long - range interactions .",
    "ls detector sensitivity is shown assuming annihilation to either the @xmath22 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath24 and @xmath171 ( flavor - independent ) channels . ]",
    "we will not attempt a quantitative estimate of the sensitivity of xenon100 to dark matter with long - range interactions .",
    "xenon100 s recoil energy threshold is defined in terms of scintillation photoelectrons ; the detector s scintillation response to recoil energy ( @xmath172 ) is not measured for low recoil energies .",
    "moreover , bounds from xenon100 are generated assuming that the number of photoelectrons is determined by a poisson distribution .",
    "even some low energy recoils can thus produce enough scintillation photoelectrons to exceed the threshold . as",
    "a result of the uncertainties in the detector response at low recoil , an attempt to estimate the event rate expected at xenon100 for dark matter with long - range interactions is beyond the scope of this work .",
    "we will simply note that the recoil energy range for which xenon100 is sensitive is at best comparable to that of cdms , while a xenon nucleus is roughly twice as heavy as that of germanium .",
    "this implies that the sensitivity of xenon100 relative to cdms will be suppressed by roughly a factor of 4 for the case of long - range interactions .",
    "recent hints of low - mass dark matter have potentially been seen by the dama  @xcite , cogent  @xcite and cresst  @xcite experiments .",
    "dark matter models with long - range interactions have been discussed as a possible way of reconciling the data from these experiments with the constraints from other direct detection experiments  @xcite .",
    "long - range interactions can affect not only the magnitude of the overall excesses seen by cogent and cresst , but can also affect the modulation seen by dama and cogent .",
    "although models with long - range interactions can provide a better fit to the overall excesses , they sometimes provide a worse fit to the modulation signals .",
    "we will not attempt to define a region of parameter - space for dark matter with long - range interactions which could match the dama , cogent or cresst data .",
    "this would require a detailed matching of the expected event spectrum with that observed by the experiments , which is beyond the scope of this work ( and perhaps premature , given the issues raised in  @xcite ) .",
    "however , since cogent also uses germanium as the target material , one would expect a 1 kt ls detector to be easily sensitive to dark matter models with long - range interactions which could potentially explain the data of cogent .",
    "moreover , one should note that the low - mass cresst region is consistent with scattering from both oxygen and calcium .",
    "given the difference in mass , one would expect long - range interactions with calcium to be suppressed by roughly a factor 4 relative to oxygen , as compared to the case of contact interactions .",
    "finally , we can consider the sensitivity of lbne ( long - baseline neutrino experiment ) .",
    "we will assume the detector target material is liquid argon ( configuration 2 )  @xcite , with a total fiducial volume of roughly 51 kt .",
    "liquid argon - based neutrino detectors are expected to have very good event reconstruction ; we will assume that liquid argon detectors permit a reconstruction of charged lepton flavor , energy and direction with at least the same resolution as liquid scintillation detectors .",
    "we then find dv ( r ) ( r , z ) & ~ & 23 ( 3.1 10 ^ 34 ) where the factor @xmath140 again arises from the fraction of charged lepton events which would point back to the sun within angle @xmath141 .",
    "for a detector as large as lbne , almost the entire fiducial volume can produce fully - contained events .",
    "we then see that the sensitivity which kamland could obtain with its 2135 day data set could be obtained by lbne with only @xmath173 days of data .",
    "note that the possibility of dominant annihilation to leptonic channels is not inconsistent with dark matter - nucleus scattering which is large enough to be probed by neutrino detectors .",
    "for example , it could be that dark matter - quark scattering is mediated by an effective operator which permits velocity - independent , spin - independent scattering , but does not permit @xmath174wave annihilation ( an example of such an operator is @xmath175 ) . in this case",
    ", the dark matter - nucleus scattering cross - section could be reasonably large , while the the cross - section for dark matter to annihilate to quarks would be @xmath176-suppressed .",
    "if dark matter coupled to leptons through an operator which permitted @xmath174wave annihilation ( an example of such an operator would be @xmath177 , if the dark matter were a dirac fermion ) , then the dark matter would mostly annihilate to leptons .",
    "we have computed the capture rates and neutrino spectra which are relevant for neutrino - based searches for low - mass dark matter in the sun .",
    "the neutrino spectra are presented at a distance of 1 au from the sun , accounting for matter effects in the sun , and vacuum oscillations ( assuming a normal hierarchy and @xmath178 ) .",
    "the capture rates have been found assuming either elastic contact , elastic long - range , or inelastic contact interactions .",
    "these are the tools required for a neutrino detector to search for dark matter annihilating in the sun .    as an application of these tools",
    ", we plot the sensitivity of a 1 kt ls detector , with 2135 days of data , to low - mass dark matter with isospin - invariant elastic long - range interactions with standard model nucleons .",
    "we have found that neutrino detectors have a greatly enhanced sensitivity to dark matter with long - range interactions , relative to leading direct detection experiments such as cdms .",
    "this enhancement is readily understood ; in the case of long - range interactions , the scattering matrix element is inversely proportional to @xmath179 . scattering rates in detectors with heavy targets , such as germanium and xenon ,",
    "are heavily suppressed .",
    "dark matter capture in the sun involves scattering from low - mass targets such as hydrogen and helium , implying that these scattering rates will see a relative enhancement .",
    "a ls neutrino detector with the exposure already available to kamland could have a sensitivity up to 2 orders of magnitude greater than that of cdms .",
    "lbne ( with a 51 kt liquid argon target ) could achieve similar sensitivity with roughly 17 days of data .",
    "we have also found that low - mass dark matter with inelastic contact interactions can be probed by neutrino detectors even for @xmath115 .",
    "this implies that neutrino detectors can be sensitive to inelastic dark matter models which are more difficult to probe on earth , because gravitational infall allows inelastic scattering in the sun for models where inelastic scattering would not be kinematically possible on earth .",
    "the choice @xmath180 is consistent with recent data from the daya bay experiment  @xcite .",
    "the neutrino spectrum is slightly different from the @xmath181 case , with the difference most noticeable in the case of annihilation entirely to neutrinos . for searches involving upward - going leptons",
    ", there will also be a modification to the neutrino spectrum due to passage through the earth .",
    "this effect will depend on the location of the detector ; for any particular detector , one can obtain the appropriate neutrino spectra by running the wimpevent program , inputting the data files for the neutrino spectrum at 1 au found at http://www.phys.hawaii.edu/~superk/post/spectrum .    it is worth noting that a direct detection experiment with a target molecule containing hydrogen would also be expected to have enhanced sensitivity to dark matter with long - range interactions .",
    "gaseous time projection chambers ( such as drift  @xcite , dmtpc  @xcite , @xmath182  @xcite , mimac  @xcite and newage  @xcite ) using hydrocarbon targets may be well - suited for this type of search .",
    "specific dark matter models with long - range interactions may have solar capture rates that are enhanced by collective effects , such as multiple scattering .",
    "neutrino searches thus have enhanced sensitivity to such models , and current data may already provide tight constraints .",
    "it would be interesting to consider such models in more detail .",
