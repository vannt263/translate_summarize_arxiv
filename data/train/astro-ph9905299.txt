    "many galaxies contain active galactic nuclei ( agn ) , thought to be powered by accretion onto super - massive ( @xmath0 ) black holes .",
    "the most powerful agn are the quasi - stellar objects ( qsos ) , with luminosities in the range @xmath1 erg / s .",
    "they out - shine their host galaxies by factors of up to @xmath2 .",
    "these extremely luminous objects provide laboratories to study high - energy physics and also may play a crucial role in the formation and evolution of galaxies .",
    "about 10% ( @xcite ) of all qsos have broad absorption lines ( bals ) in their spectra indicating a fast ( up to 0.1  c or greater ) outflow .",
    "these are the broad absorption line quasi - stellar objects ( bal qsos ) .",
    "@xcite list 304 qsos ( plus 133 candidates ) with associated absorption lines or bals .",
    "the bal phenomenon appears primarily in high - luminosity radio - quiet objects .",
    "bal do not appear in seyfert galaxies and have only recently been discovered in a few radio - loud qsos ( @xcite ) .",
    "however , low - velocity intrinsic absorption systems are seen in all subtypes of broad - line agn , indicating that outflows are a common phenomenon .",
    "a survey of 142 bright qsos ( @xcite ) shows that the great majority ( 99% ) have low polarization ( lpq , @xmath3 ) .",
    "bal qsos make up a large fraction of the radio - quiet highly polarized qsos ( hpq , @xmath4 ) .",
    "there is a strong selection bias against reddened and obscured qsos in optical surveys .",
    "some infrared - selected agn have been discovered which would be classified as qsos if seen from a dust - free direction ( e.g. ,  @xcite ;  @xcite ; and  @xcite ) .",
    "these objects are very highly polarized ( up to 30% ) because the unpolarized direct emission is more highly attenuated than the polarized scattered emission .",
    "the scattering region is located further away from the nucleus than the broad line region , as indicated by polarized broad emission lines .",
    "the radio - loud hpqs are mostly blazars , which emit optical synchrotron light boosted by relativistic motion in a jet pointed close to the line of sight .",
    "another class of highly polarized agn consists of reddened quasars ( e.g. ,  @xcite ;  @xcite ;  @xcite ;  @xcite ) and radio galaxies with hidden quasar nuclei ( e.g. ,  @xcite ;  @xcite ;  @xcite ;  @xcite ) .",
    "the question of whether bal qsos can be unified with other types of qsos has important implications for the structure and physics of agn outflows .",
    "it has been suggested that bal qsos are viewed from an equatorial direction , while non - bal qsos are viewed from a more polar aspect ( @xcite ) . in this picture , the bal clouds may be ablated from an accretion disk .",
    "an equatorial aspect is consistent with the higher mean polarization of bal qsos than non - bal qsos ( e.g. ,  @xcite ) .",
    "our survey of bal qsos improves the accuracy and statistics of the bal qso polarization distribution .",
    "ogle ( 1999b , hereafter paper ii ) tests the hypothesis that high polarization is due to viewing angle by comparing the polarization distributions of bal qsos and non - bal qsos against a simple unification model .",
    "the source of polarized light in low - polarization qsos is a subject of debate ( e.g. ,  @xcite ) .",
    "uv - optical emission from qsos ( the big blue bump ) is commonly thought to be dominated by thermal emission from an accretion disk ( e.g. ,  @xcite ) . it was originally predicted that such emission should be highly polarized ( up to 12% ) due to scattering ( @xcite ;  @xcite ) .",
    "the polarization should also be perpendicular to the disk axis for an optically thick disk .",
    "the observations , however , show that the polarizations of qsos are low and sometimes parallel to the radio axis , weighing heavily against the standard accretion disk model ( e.g. ,  @xcite ) . in paper ii , we consider scattering in the broad emission line region as a possible source of polarization .",
    "the uv spectral components of qsos include the blue featureless continuum ( fc ) , broad emission lines ( bels ) , broad absorption lines ( bals ) , and sometimes narrow absorption lines ( nals ) .",
    "most of the variance among qso spectra can be associated with these components ( @xcite ) .",
    "identifying and measuring individual lines and defining a continuum level can be difficult because of blending , especially of fe ii emission ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) .",
    "spectropolarimetry provides a way of disentangling distinctly polarized spectral components .",
    "spectropolarimetry has been published for a small number of bal qsos ( e.g. ,  @xcite ;  @xcite ;  @xcite ;  @xcite ;  @xcite ;  @xcite ;  @xcite ) .",
    "in general , these studies reveal that the broad emission lines have lower polarization than the continuum and that the continuum polarization rises to the blue .",
    "our survey extends these results to a much larger sample of objects .",
    "in addition , the large apertures of the keck telescopes allow us to study the emission and absorption line polarization of distant qsos with unprecedented detail .",
    "this is particularly difficult in the deep bal troughs , where the equivalent apparent magnitude is typically 20 , and we are trying to measure the polarization to an accuracy of 1% . as a byproduct , we have taken some of the highest s / n spectra of bal qso to date .",

    "the wmf sample was derived from the lbqs and a number of other surveys .",
    "this sample is useful because it contains most of the well - studied bright bal qsos accessible from northern latitudes .",
    "however , due to haphazard selection and serendipitous discovery of most bal qsos , the sample should not be considered uniform or complete .",
    "in addition , we observed 21 bal qsos with the w. m. keck 10 m telescopes .",
    "the keck survey provided the high signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) necessary to study bal and bel polarization .",
    "a total of 9 bal qsos from the palomar survey were re - observed at keck .",
    "the remaining 12 bal qsos were selected to be bright or have high polarization . in cases of overlap between the two surveys ,",
    "we present the superior keck data .",
    "the combined data set consists of keck spectropolarimetry of 21 bal qsos and palomar spectropolarimetry of 15 bal qsos .",
    "we give a summary of the observations in tables 1 and 2 , including iau and alternate designations , redshift , apparent visual magnitude , ut date , exposure time , and spectrograph slit position angle .",
    "total exposure times range from 0.5 to 6.7 hrs , for an average of 2.2 hrs per object .",

    "spectropolarimetry was taken with the low resolution imaging spectrograph ( lris ,  @xcite ) and polarimeter combination .",
    "a 300 groove / mm grating with a dispersion of 2.49/pixel gave a resolution of 10 .",
    "this translates into a velocity resolution of 600 km / s in the c iv @xmath81549 bal for a qso at redshift @xmath9 .",
    "the c iv doublet separation of 500 km / s is unresolved in our spectra .",
    "this resolution is sufficient for studying the polarization of the broad emission and broad absorption lines .",
    "the spectra cover the observed wavelength range of 3800 - 8900 .",
    "this corresponds to the rest wavelength range between ly@xmath10 @xmath81216 and mg ii @xmath82798 for a @xmath9 qso .",
    "the c iv @xmath11 line is the most useful for our study because this bal is typically deep enough to show a large polarization signature and it is well isolated from other emission and absorption lines , including intervening ly@xmath10 absorption systems .",
    "there are mg ii and fe ii metal lines from intervening systems in the spectra of at least ten objects ; but their equivalent widths are much smaller than the bal equivalent widths .",
    "the c iv bal is not visible in the two objects with redshifts @xmath12 .",
    "the detector is a 2048@xmath132048 pixel charge coupled device ( ccd ) manufactured by tektronix .",
    "it has an inverse gain of 2 electrons per data number and a read - out noise of roughly 6 electrons .",
    "the maximum efficiency of the spectrograph plus ccd combination is approximately 40% at the blaze wavelength of the grating .",
    "slit widths of @xmath14 and @xmath15 were used to match the atmospheric seeing , and the pixel scale was @xmath16/pixel .",
    "the useful slit length is only @xmath17 in lris polarimetry mode because of vignetting by the beam - splitter .",
    "we assume that the extended emission from the narrow line region and starlight from the host galaxy within the slit aperture are negligible .",
    "there are a few cases where foreground galaxies fell in the slit , but they were never close enough to the bal qso to contaminate its spectrum ( except for the undetected galaxy which lenses 1413 + 1143 ) . indeed , there is no evidence for narrow emission lines or stellar photospheric absorption lines in any of our spectra .",
    "the relatively narrow slit widths along with variable weather and seeing conditions yield large uncertainties in the absolute photometry , however we are only interested in relative fluxes",
    ". the slit orientation on the sky was held constant during each set of observations to avoid mixing the stokes parameters . when observations from different nights were taken with different slit pa , the stokes parameters were averaged after calibration to the sky",
    "coordinate system .",
    "the spectrograph slit was set at the mean parallactic angle for most observations .",
    "this resulted in a minimum loss of light from differential atmospheric refraction , but there was still up to 20% differential loss between the blue and red ends of the spectra .",
    "this is seen in the ratio of spectra taken at different epochs .",
    "it is important to consider this distortion when analyzing the color of the flux spectra , but it does not affect the polarization .",
    "keck bal qso observations were taken without an order - blocking filter to obtain a wide wavelength coverage , and may be contaminated by second - order blue light redward of 7000 .",
    "the magnitude of this effect ( @xcite ) is less than 1.8% of the flux at the blue end of the spectrum ( 3500 - 4500 ) .",
    "contamination due to second order light is minimal , since the bal qso continua rise less than a factor of 3 over the observed wavelength range .",
    "this translates to an error of 5% in flux at the red end of the spectrum of the bluest object .",
    "since the polarization in bal qsos rises to the blue , this could lead to a polarization error of @xmath18 in an object polarized at @xmath19 .",
    "there is a potentially larger effect from the ly@xmath10 emission line showing up in second order at 2432 , but we have not identified any instance of this in our spectra .",
    "the performance of the lris polarimeter and the robustness of the reduction techniques are discussed by cohen et al .",
    "the dual - beam polarimeter separates and simultaneously measures two orthogonal polarization senses using a calcite beam splitter .",
    "this nearly eliminates the effects of atmospheric transparency and seeing variations on the calculated stokes parameters . rotating a half - wave plate @xmath20 swaps the ordinary and extraordinary beams , allowing a correction for the gain difference along the two optical paths .",
    "a full set of observations is taken at four wave plate settings ( 0@xmath21 , 45@xmath21 , 225 , 675 ) , yielding eight spectra used to compute the stokes parameters ( @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 ) .",
    "the circular polarization is negligible for qsos .",
    "the palomar observations are summarized in table 2 .",
    "spectropolarimetry was taken with the double spectrograph ( @xcite ) on the 5-m hale telescope .",
    "bal qsos were observed for 60 - 90 minutes , depending on their magnitudes and polarizations .",
    "polarization spectra are measured with an accuracy of 0.1 - 0.6% in 50(rest ) bins .",
    "the methodology of observations is largely the same for the palomar and keck samples .",
    "here we concentrate on issues peculiar to the palomar data .",
    "we used a d55 dichroic filter , splitting the spectrum at 5500 .",
    "separate gratings were used to disperse the spectra in the blue and red arms of the spectrograph .",
    "the transmittance of the dichroic is better than 90% redward of 5500 , so only a small fraction of the photons is lost .",
    "the dichroic filter has the additional advantage of blocking out second - order blue light .",
    "the polarimeter is above the dichroic in the optical path , so it serves both the blue and red arms of the spectrograph .",
    "some spurious polarization effects are introduced near the wavelength of the dichroic split and do not calibrate out .",
    "we set the gratings on the blue and red sides to exclude this region , so there is typically a 200gap in our spectra . for most objects",
    ", this gap falls in between the c iv and c iii ] bels .",
    "however , the gap falls in the c iv bal region for three objects ( 0903 + 1734 , 1235 + 1453 , and 1243 + 0121 ) , and on the c iii ] emission line for two objects ( 0932 + 5006 , and 2201@xmath61834 ) .    a 300 line / mm grating blazed for maximum efficiency at 3990gives a dispersion of 2.17per pixel at the focus of the blue camera .",
    "a 316 line / mm grating blazed at 7500 gives a dispersion of 2.46per pixel in the red spectra .",
    "the wavelength coverage is typically 3600 - 5400 in the blue and 5600 - 8100 in the red .",
    "the low efficiency of the double spectrograph at wavelengths less than 3600is not adequate for polarimetric observations of faint qsos .",
    "the spectrograph slit had a @xmath25 aperture and a useful ( un - vignetted ) length of @xmath26 in polarimetry mode .",
    "we used a wider slit at palomar than at keck because of the worse seeing .",
    "the spectral resolution was 6 in the red and 8 in the blue , slightly better than in the keck observations .",
    "the detectors in the blue and red cameras were both 800@xmath13800 pixel ccds .",
    "the blue detector suffered from dead columns and transient gain variations near the blue end of the spectrum .",
    "we used chip regions with the best cosmetic quality , but the flux spectra may still be afflicted by nonlinearities at a level of 5% in localized wavelength regions .",
    "in fact , the flux standards of oke ( 1990 ) were taken with the double spectrograph and suffer from some of the same defects .",
    "these glitches in the system efficiency were at a low enough level to cause negligible damage to the polarization spectra .",
    "the polarimeter in the double spectrograph does not have focus compensation between the ordinary and extraordinary beams , so the camera foci were set at the best compromise positions .",
    "the red camera ccd chip suffered from a warped surface , causing focus variations along the spectra .",
    "we set the telescope focus to provide the sharpest image along the largest possible wavelength range .",
    "these focusing difficulties should not affect the polarimetry ( except for lowering the s / n ) since focusing and seeing variations are mitigated by the dual - beam polarimetry method . during the last year of our observing program ( 1995 - 1996 )",
    ", the red camera was upgraded to a 1024@xmath131024 pixel ccd and other changes were made to its optics , removing the problems of multiple detector flaws and some of the focusing difficulties .",
    "data reduction was accomplished with vista image processing software , using procedures described by miller , robinson , & goodrich ( 1988 ) and cohen et al .",
    "cosmic ray events were eliminated interactively from the ccd frames using a @xmath27 , @xmath28 pixel median filter .",
    "it was sometimes impossible to remove cosmic ray tracks falling on the object spectra , and these are flagged in the spectra as hits. to help identify and mitigate contamination from cosmic rays , the observations were typically split into two sets .",
    "the ccd frames were de - biased using an average from the over - scan region .",
    "no corrections were made for the negligible dark current .",
    "all object frames were divided by an internal halogen flat field to remove small spatial variations in the ccd response .",
    "note that in the case of low sky background , the flat field cancels out of the equations for the stokes parameters .",
    "hence the polarization is quite insensitive to flat - fielding .",
    "the object spectra were extracted using 3-@xmath29 wide windows centered along a spline fit to their centroids on the ccd chip .",
    "night sky spectra were extracted from windows on both sides of the object , averaged , scaled , and subtracted from the object spectra .",
    "spectra were wavelength calibrated using ne , ar , and hg+kr internal lamps , and re - binned to a linear scale .",
    "night sky spectra were used to correct for wavelength zero - point offsets due to spectrograph flexure .",
    "spectra were de - redshifted using literature redshift values given in tables 1 & 2 and binned by 5(rest ) . the photon counts and statistics from the object and sky spectra",
    "were then used to compute the stokes parameters ( @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 ) and their uncertainties .",
    "binning reduces the biases that can be introduced by noisy data and enhances the signal - to - noise ratio s / n of the stokes parameters .",
    "the total flux spectra ( figs . 3 - 5 ) are presented un - binned to show maximum spectral resolution .",
    "measurements of ( @xmath23 , @xmath24 ) and the derived fractional polarization and position angle ( @xmath30 , pa ) are subject to a number of biases when the number of photons is small ( @xcite ;  @xcite ) .",
    "@xmath30 is a positive definite quantity , and therefore does not obey gaussian statistics .",
    "it is therefore preferable to rotate ( @xmath23 , @xmath24 ) by a fit to the continuum pa curve instead of calculating a de - biased @xmath30 ( @xcite ) .",
    "this is only possible when the pa is a slowly varying function of wavelength .",
    "where there are pa rotations across the emission and absorption lines , the polarization will be underestimated by this method ; then it is necessary to inspect both @xmath23 and @xmath24 to determine the line polarization .",

    "it is possible that cleaning and subsequent realignment of the telescope secondary mirror is to blame for the large increase in instrumental polarization between 10/94 and 11/95 .",
    "if the secondary mirror is not aligned perfectly normal to the primary mirror , then the projection of the secondary will be slightly elliptical and induce a net polarization .",

    "the wavelength dependence could come from tarnished spots which selectively absorb blue light .",
    "in fact , re - aluminization of the 200 inch primary at palomar is a very tricky business , and sometimes gives less than uniform coverage .",
    "there are similar difficulties with instrumental polarization in lick observatory spectropolarimetry ( @xcite ) , which is also due to irregular aluminization of the telescope mirrors .",

    ". then it would be possible to make a more reliable correction for the interstellar polarization ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) . the number of observations required for this would be prohibitively large and impractical for the current study .",
