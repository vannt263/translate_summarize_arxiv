    "the gravity  gauge theory duality @xcite has attracted a lot of attention in the past years .",
    "the most famous example is the ads / cft correspondence @xcite which states that a gravity theory in a @xmath0-dimensional anti - de sitter ( ads ) space  time is equivalent to a conformal field theory ( cft ) on the @xmath1-dimensional boundary of ads .",
    "recently , this theory has been used to describe so - called holographic superconductors with the help of black holes in higher dimensional space ",
    "time @xcite and many aspects have been discussed such as holographic superconductors in horava - lifshitz gravity @xcite and in born - infeld electrodynamics @xcite , fermions @xcite , the behaviour of holographic superconductors in external magnetic fields @xcite and at zero temperature @xcite , hydrodynamical aspects of holographic superconductors @xcite as well as rotating superconductors @xcite .",
    "holographic superconductors in extended models that allow for a first order phase transition @xcite as well as holographic superconductors in m - theory @xcite have also been studied .",
    "non - abelian ( or p - wave ) holographic superconductors have been studied in @xcite . in @xcite",
    "a string theory realization of p - wave holographic superconductors in the probe limit has been discussed and the meissner effect has been studied in detail @xcite .",
    "( for a related analytical study see @xcite . ) sound modes for p - wave superconductors have been considered in @xcite , while fermions in these superconductors have been discussed in @xcite .",
    "various other aspects have also been studied @xcite .",
    "the general idea behind holographic superconductors comes from the observation that below a critical temperature electrically charged black holes become unstable to form scalar hair , i.e. they possess non  vanishing scalar fields on the horizon @xcite .",
    "the reason for this is that close to the horizon of the black hole the effective mass of the scalar field can become negative with masses below the breitenlohner ",
    "freedman bound @xcite such that the scalar field becomes unstable and possesses a non  vanishing value on and close to the horizon of the black hole .",
    "the value of the scalar field on the ads boundary is then associated with the corresponding condensate in the dual theory .    in most cases ,",
    "holographic superconductors have been studied in the `` probe limit '' neglecting back  reaction of the space  time .",
    "this limit corresponds to letting the electric charge @xmath2 tend to infinity or equivalently newton s constant @xmath3 tend to zero .",
    "backreaction of the space ",
    "time was considered in @xcite for ( 2 + 1)dimensional holographic superconductor .",
    "it was found that the qualitative results are similar for small charges , but that suprisingly the scalar field can even form a condensate when being uncharged .    in @xcite (",
    "3 + 1)dimensional superconductors were studied by investigating scalar hair formation on black holes in gauss  bonnet gravity .",
    "this has been extended to higher dimensions in @xcite .",
    "the motivation for this is the apparent contradiction between the mermin ",
    "wagner theorem that forbids spontaneous symmetry breaking in 2 + 1 dimensions at finite temperatures and the fact that ( 2 + 1)dimensional holographic superconductors do exist .",
    "consequently , it has been suggested that higher curvature corrections should suppress condensation , where higher curvature corretions can of course only been studied for ( 3 + 1)dimensional superconductors ( or higher dimensional ones ) .",
    "@xcite were concerned with the `` probe limit '' and it was found that condensation can not be suppressed in gauss  bonnet gravity .    in this paper , we are interested in the model studied in @xcite but away from the probe limit , i.e. taking back  reaction of the space ",
    "time into account .",
    "we study ( 3 + 1)-dimensional superconductors in pure einstein and gauss  bonnet gravity , respectively . while for large temperatures , i.e. when the scalar field vanishes identically analytic solutions to the equations of motion are known , this is different for a black hole with scalar hair that forms below the condensation temperature .",
    "these solutions have to be constructed numerically .    in section 2 , we present the model , the equations of motion and the boundary conditions . in section 3 ,",
    "we discuss our numerical results , while section 4 contains our conclusions .",
    "in this paper , we are studying the formation of scalar hair on an electrically charged black hole in @xmath4 dimensional anti  de sitter space  time .",
    "the action reads  : @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the cosmological constant and @xmath7 the gauss  bonnet coupling .",

    "@xmath2 and @xmath12 denote the electric charge and mass of the scalar field @xmath13 , respectively .",
    "the ansatz for the metric reads  : @xmath14 where @xmath15 and @xmath16 are functions of @xmath17 only .",
    "the @xmath18-dimensional metric is @xmath19 where @xmath20 denotes the curvature of the 3-dimensional space .",
    "we are only interested in plane - symmetric black holes in this paper , so we will set @xmath21 .",
    "however , we will keep the @xmath20 in the equations for completeness .    for the electromagnetic field and the scalar field",
    "we choose @xcite  : @xmath22 such that the black hole possesses only electric charge .",
    "the coupled einstein and euler  lagrange equations are obtained from the variation of the action with respect to the matter and metric fields , respectively .",

    "we take back  reactions of the space ",
    "time into account .",
    "note that this limit is equivalent to letting @xmath28 since we can preform the rescalings @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 . hence without loosing generality we can set @xmath32 .    in order to find an explicit solution of the equations of motion",
    ", we have to fix appropriate boundary conditions . in the following , we are interested in the formation of scalar hair on electrically charged black holes with horizon at @xmath33 such that @xmath34 with @xmath35 finite . in order for the matter fields to be regular at the horizon we need to impose : @xmath36 asymptotically , we want the space  time to be that of a reissner - nordstrm  anti de sitter black hole , i.e. we can choose @xmath37 .",
    "other choices of the asymptotic value of @xmath38 would simply correspond to a rescaling of the time coordinate .",
    "the matter fields on the other hand obey @xcite  : @xmath39 with @xmath40 note that the value of the gauss  bonnet coupling @xmath7 is bounded from above  : @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the chern - simons limit . for larger values of @xmath7 the solution would possess a naked singularity .",
    "the parameters @xmath43 , @xmath44 are the chemical potential and density of electric charge , respectively . along with @xcite",
    "we choose @xmath45 .",
    "@xmath46 will correspond to the expectation value @xmath47 of the operator @xmath48 which in the context of the gauge theory ",
    "gravity duality is dual to the scalar field and as such represents the value of the condensate .",

    "these solutions are electrically charged black holes which are the only solutions for temperatures larger than the critical temperature @xmath55 . for",
    "@xmath56 these solutions will be unstable to form scalar hair , i.e. develop a non - vanishing value of @xmath13 on the horizon .",
    "the aim of this paper is to study the formation of scalar hair black holes in dependence on @xmath7 and @xmath57 .",
    "the temperature mentioned here corresponds to the hawking temperature of the black hole and reads @xmath58 in the gauge theory ",
    "gravity duality @xmath55 is the temperature below which superconductivity appears .",
    "in the following we are only interested in the plane  symmetric black holes with @xmath21 .",
    "the equations of motion ( [ eq1])-([eq4 ] ) depend in principle on a number of constants but due to the scale invariances noted in @xcite two of them can be scaled out and hence be fixed to particular values without loosing generality . in the following we fix @xmath59 and @xmath60 . along with @xcite we set @xmath61 which guarantees the stability of @xmath62 since @xmath63 with @xmath64 the breitenlohner ",
    "freedam mass @xcite .    to find a unique solution to the equations of motions we fix the boundary conditions ( [ bc1 ] ) , ( [ bc2 ] ) at the horizon , and choose @xmath65 , @xmath45 .",
    "in addition we fix @xmath46 to a particular value . in this way we are able to construct branches of solutions labelled by the parameter @xmath46 .",
    "note that @xmath43 and @xmath44 are uniquely fixed by the choice of @xmath46 and are not free parameters .",
    "however , in the literature on holographic superconductors , the solutions are typically presented for fixed electric charge density @xmath44 , while the horizon value @xmath66 is treated as a free parameter .",
    "these two approaches are connected to each other .",
    "indeed , it is easy to convert a branch of solutions with fixed @xmath66 and varying @xmath46  where @xmath67  into a branch of solutions with constant charge density . in the following",
    "we denote quantities corresponding to a fixed charge density by a hat . setting @xmath68 , the relevant",
    "hawking temperature @xmath69 and condensate @xmath70 are respectively given by @xmath71 where @xmath72 is defined in ( [ lambda ] ) .",
    "this corresponds to the case @xmath27 and @xmath73 .",
    "we solved the equations for several values of @xmath57 and @xmath46 and find that solutions exist for generic values of these parameters .",
    "when studying solutions for @xmath57 fixed and varying @xmath46 we find that in the limit @xmath74 the solutions tend to ( [ rn ] ) for very specific values of @xmath43 and @xmath44 which depend on the choice of @xmath57 and can only be determined numerically . correspondingly , the critical temperature @xmath75 at which @xmath76 can also only be determined numerically .",
    "we find the values given in the table below  :    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     for large @xmath57 the construction of the solutions becomes increasingly difficult . in principle",
    "we would want to know what happens for very large @xmath57 . in order to understand this , we fitted the numerical data and found that @xmath77 fits the data for @xmath78 very well .",
    "this on the other hand means that no matter how large we choose @xmath57 , we will always have @xmath79 .",
    "this has already been observed for superconductors in @xmath80 dimensions @xcite , where it was shown that @xmath79 in the limit @xmath81 which corresponds to @xmath82 here .",
    "apparently , this phenomenon persists for @xmath25-dimensional superconductors .",
    "fixing @xmath57 and increasing the value of the condensate @xmath46 we find that the values @xmath35 and @xmath83 slowly approach zero . at the same time",
    ", the function @xmath53 develops a local maximum and a local minimum at values @xmath84 , @xmath85 such that @xmath86 .",
    "this is illustrated for the metric functions @xmath53 and @xmath38 in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ( left ) for @xmath87 and three different values of @xmath46 .",
    "to    to    to    to    to    this would suggest that for sufficiently large @xmath46 the function @xmath53 develops a double zero at @xmath88 which would correspond to the formation of an extremal black hole with vanishing hawking temperature .",
    "a detailed analysis however shows that the value @xmath89 remains strictly positive , while the value of @xmath35 decreases with @xmath46 increasing according to an exponential behaviour @xmath90 with @xmath91 some constant .",
    "this result suggests that the black hole solutions are not limited by a maximal value of the condensate @xmath46 and that the temperature stays positive for all values of @xmath92 .    in fig.[fig4 ]",
    "( right ) we show the matter field functions @xmath93 , @xmath94 and @xmath95 .",
    "we observe that for fixed @xmath57 and increasing @xmath46 the maximum of @xmath95 is pushed further away from the horizon of the black hole . indeed , for small values of @xmath57 and @xmath46 ,",
    "the maximum of @xmath95 is on the horizon of the black hole .",
    "note that when fixing @xmath46 and increasing @xmath57 we observe a similar phenomenon .    to understand how the scalar field @xmath13 becomes unstable close to the horizon , we plot the effective mass @xmath96 in fig.[fignew ] for @xmath60 . indeed , the effective mass drops below the breitenlohner - freedman bound of @xmath97 close to the horizon .",
    "for fixed @xmath92 and increasing @xmath57 the quantity @xmath98 becomes more narrow and smaller in absolute value . for",
    "fixed @xmath57 and increasing @xmath92 it becomes broader and larger in absolute value .    to understand this in more detail note that close to the horizon the functions can be expanded as follows  : @xmath99 moreover note that there are the following relations between the values of the functions at @xmath33 : @xmath100 @xmath101 @xmath102    @xmath103    several quantities characterizing the solutions are given in fig.[fig3 ] for @xmath57 varying and @xmath104 fixed ( left ) and for @xmath92 varying and @xmath87 fixed ( right ) , respectively .",
    "first note that @xmath105 increases with @xmath57 and @xmath92 , respectively . that @xmath105 is an increasing function of the condensate @xmath92",
    "was already noticed in @xcite for the probe limit . here , we find in addition that the stronger the back  reaction the higher the value @xmath105 for a given condensate @xmath92 . since we would like @xmath13 to have its maximal positive value on the horizon we have @xmath106 , @xmath107 and then from ( [ psirh ] ) obviously @xmath108 . for @xmath26 ,",
    "the value of @xmath109 which for @xmath59 and @xmath60 is just @xmath110 . for increasing @xmath57",
    "the value @xmath111 is first decreasing due to the decrease of the electric field @xmath112 on the horizon ( the negative term in ( [ frh ] ) ) and then for sufficiently strong back ",
    "reaction @xmath105 becomes larger and larger such that @xmath111 starts increasing again .",
    "this is similar for @xmath57 fixed and varying @xmath92 . for @xmath113 ,",
    "the solution is given by ( [ rn ] ) .",
    "for @xmath114 but small the electric field on the horizon @xmath112 decreases and leads to a slight decrease in @xmath111 . for increasing @xmath92",
    "the value @xmath105 becomes larger and @xmath111 increases . for both @xmath57 and @xmath92 increasing , respectively ,",
    "the value of @xmath35 decreases from @xmath115 .",
    "finally , the charge density @xmath44 decreases for small @xmath92 and increases for larger @xmath92 when @xmath57 is fixed . for fixed @xmath92 and varying @xmath57",
    "the behaviour is qualitatively similar .",
    "when studying the dependence of the condensate @xmath92 on the temperature @xmath116 one can take two different viewpoints .",
    "first we consider the system for fixed horizon ( @xmath117 here ) .",
    "the dependence of @xmath118 as a function of the temperature @xmath116 is given in fig .",
    "[ fig_tc_rh_05 ] ( left ) for several values of @xmath57 .",
    "the solid line represents the condensate @xmath92 and the dashed line represents the charge density @xmath44 , respectively . for completeness",
    "we give the corresponding lines for @xmath26 ( dashed line ) , where the bullet indicates the minimal value of @xmath44 .",
    "apparently , the behaviour is quite different when comparing large and small @xmath57 . for small @xmath57",
    "the temperature of the condensate is larger than the temperature of the critical limit , for large @xmath57 it is vice versa .",
    "following the literature , we also present our results for fixed charge density @xmath119 . the dimensionless quantity @xmath120 ( with @xmath121 in the limit @xmath73 ) as a function of the rescaled temperature @xmath122 is given in fig .",
    "[ fig_tc_rh_05 ] ( right ) .",
    "qualitatively , the behaviour for large @xmath57 is similar to that for small @xmath57 .",
    "however , the condensate can become quite large when increasing @xmath57 .",
    "moreover , the critical temperature @xmath75 at which @xmath123 decreases with increasing @xmath57 .    note that we are in fact plotting @xmath124 but that @xmath2 does nt appear here due to our choice @xmath32 .",
    "moreover , comparing our results to the ( 2 + 1)-dimensional case @xcite our choices of @xmath125 , @xmath126 , @xmath127 , @xmath128 and @xmath129 , respectively would correspond to @xmath130 , @xmath131 , @xmath132 , @xmath133 and @xmath134 when setting @xmath135 instead of @xmath136 .",
    "this corresponds to the case @xmath27 and @xmath137 .",
    "the @xmath26 limit was studied in @xcite .",
    "our numerical results indicate that also for @xmath27 the presence of the gauss  bonnet term leads to a decrease in the critical temperature .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "[ critical ] where we give the dependence of @xmath75 on @xmath7 for different values of @xmath57 . apparently also back ",
    "reaction on the space  time can not suppress condensation , i.e. the critical temperature stays positive for all values of @xmath57 and @xmath7 that we have studied in this paper .",
    "we find e.g. for @xmath138 that @xmath139 for @xmath26 ( in agreement with @xcite ) , @xmath140 for @xmath141 and @xmath142 for @xmath87 .",
    "for @xmath143 we find @xmath144 for @xmath26 ( again in agreement with @xcite ) , @xmath145 for @xmath141 and @xmath146 for @xmath87 .",
    "hence , the critical temperature can become arbitrarily close to zero for @xmath7 and @xmath57 large enough , however within our numerical accuracy , we never find @xmath147 for finite values of @xmath57 and @xmath148 .",
    "in this paper , we have studied holographic superconductors in 3 + 1 dimensions away from the probe limit .",
    "we considered the case of pure einstein and gauss  bonnet gravity , respectively and have constructed numerically electrically charged black holes that carry scalar hair .",
    "for pure einstein gravity we find that in agreement with the results for holographic superconductors in 2 + 1 dimensions @xcite the critical temperature at which condensation sets in is strictly positive for all values of the gravitational coupling .",
    "considering gauss  bonnet corrections further decreases the critical temperature , but all our numerical results indicate that it stays positive when taking back  reaction into account .",
    "hence , even when taking the gravitational coupling to infinity  which corresponds to letting the electric charge @xmath2 of the condensate tend to zero  there would still be condensation .",
    "similar to 2 + 1 dimensions this signals the existence of an additional instability of the scalar field .",
    "the explanation is similar to that in 2 + 1 dimensions @xcite : since the scalar field is uncharged the instability can not be caused by the spontaneous symmetry breaking .",
    "rather it is caused by the fact that for large @xmath57 the black hole is close to the extremal limit in which its horizon geometry would correspond to @xmath149 . in @xmath150",
    "the breitenlohner - freedman bound @xcite is @xmath151 .",
    "hence a scalar field with mass @xmath152 that is stable in @xmath62 is certainly unstable in @xmath150 .    when considering non ",
    "abelian holographic superconductors it has been observed that the phase transition that leads to the formation of vector hair becomes first order if the gravitational coupling is large enough @xcite .",
    "it would be interesting to see how the gauss  bonnet term influences this result .",
