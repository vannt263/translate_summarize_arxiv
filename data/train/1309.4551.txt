    "inflation @xcite is becoming a standard model for the very early universe . however , there is still no consensus about questions like : what is the inflaton field ?",
    "how do we connect inflation to particle physics ?",
    "how does reheating connect to standard model ?",
    "there are lots of inflation models and many of them simply can not address on these questions . among the inflation models , _",
    "hybrid inflation _ is a promising one in order to connect inflationary cosmology to particle physics . in the framework of susy , there are @xmath2- and @xmath3-term hybrid inflation models .",
    "however in those models the inflaton is usually assumed to be some unknown gauge singlet and it is not clear how does inflaton decay and reheat the universe to result in a thermal bath of standard model particles in order to have successful big bang nucleosynthesis .",
    "furthermore , these models may suffer severely from thermal @xcite and non - thermal gravitino problem @xcite . on the other hand , there is still another interesting susy hybrid inflation model which is called _ supernatural inflation _",
    "however , the original form of this model predicts a blue spectrum , namely the spectral index @xmath4 .",
    "current observation from planck satellite @xcite gives @xmath5 which excludes @xmath6 at over @xmath7 .",
    "planck also reports smaller tensor to scalar ratio @xmath8 and no non - gaussianity is observed .",
    "this implies single - field slow - roll inflation is still a very good model as long as the spectrum is red . if we further restrict ourselves to small field inflation with inflaton field value smaller than planck scale , it is almost inevitable to consider hilltop inflation @xcite where the potential is convex ( corresponding to tachyonic fluctuation modes ) , namely the slow - roll parameter @xmath9 at horizon exit . in @xcite ,",
    "techniques of type - iii hilltop inflation developed in @xcite is applied to supernatural inflation and obtain the spectral index @xmath1 with natural scales coming from susy breaking .",
    "it was later shown in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) that this _ hilltop supernatural inflation _ can evade both thermal and non - thermal gravitino problems . in this paper , we materialize this model in some solid susy gut models including flipped - su(5 ) and pati - salam model - term hybrid inflation ( with modification ) . on the other hand , we consider ( hilltop ) supernatural inflation in this paper . ] .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section [ sec1 ] , we briefly review the model of hilltop supernatural inflation . in section [ section3 ] , we present the potential . in section [ section4 ] , flipped su(5 ) model is considered . in section [ section5 ] , pati - salam model is considered . in section [ section6 ]",

    "the effective mass of the waterfall field ( at @xmath13 ) is @xmath14 during inflation , the field value of @xmath11 gives a large positive mass to @xmath12 therefore it is trapped to @xmath13 and the potential during inflation is of the form @xmath15 where @xmath16 .",
    "the end of inflation is determined by @xmath17 when the waterfall field starts to become tachyonic which implies @xmath18    for original supernatural inflation , because the potential in eq .",

    "we can get a red spectral index if we extend the model into a hilltop supernatural inflation by considering @xmath19 where @xmath20 and @xmath21 is the reduced planck mass . given the potential , we can solve for the spectrum , spectral index , and the field value .",
    "we put the detailed calculation in the appendix [ a ] .",
    "the potential becomes concave downward ( for @xmath22 ) when cosmological scales leave the horizon at @xmath23 and as can be seen in fig  [ fig1 ] a spectral index @xmath1 can be obtained by @xmath24 ( for @xmath25 ) , @xmath26 ( for @xmath27 ) .",

    "is heavy with a mass roughly the inflation scale due to a coupling to the squark condensation ( in addition to the waterfall field ) which can generate the required inflation scale",
    ". therefore @xmath84 can not be the inflaton in our model .",

    "the large expectation value of the inflaton field @xmath11 would force @xmath13 through the third term in the potential therefore the fourth term becomes @xmath16 which provides the vacuum energy to drive inflation .",
    "we note that the linear term of the singlet field @xmath84 can be always generated due to the susy breaking @xcite .",
    "in fact , the following term in the khler potential can be always generate the linear term @xmath88 where @xmath68 is a susy breaking superfield , whose @xmath2-term is non - zero . because the gravitino mass is @xmath89 , the size of @xmath90 is related to the susy breaking @xmath91 .",
    "the scale @xmath92 can be also obtained by strong @xmath93 dynamics ( which is different form color @xmath94 ) .",

    "smallness of the coupling constant @xmath103 induces the hierarchy between @xmath104 and the vev of the waterfall field ( namely , unification scale ) .",
    "we do not address the detail of the mechanism in this paper , and we mention the feature of this potential .",
    "it is well - known that fine - tuning between the susy breaking order parameter @xmath67 and superpotential @xmath105 is needed to eliminate the cosmological constant @xmath106 in order to realize the proper susy breaking scale , we need @xmath107    in naive gut superpotential @xmath108 , one obtains @xmath109 gev .",
    "we need @xmath110 ( @xmath111 is a non - gut superpotential ) for vanishing the cosmological constant . therefore , to realized the proper susy breaking scale and vanishing the cosmological constant , two - step cancellation",
    "is needed ( among three quantities ) : @xmath112 unless no - scale supergravity is considered .",
    "if the waterfall potential @xmath113 is employed to break gut symmetry , the first cancellation in the superpotential is  automatic \" via the @xmath2-flatness condition .",
    "( surely , we still need a fine - tune between susy breaking and total @xmath105 for vanishing cosmological constant ) .",
    "the waterfall superpotential requires only one cancellation even if a field acquires a vev @xmath114 gev .",
    "this is one of the important conceptual merits of this scenario in the view of gut model building .",
    "the size of @xmath115 is related to the @xmath85-symmetry breaking scale , which should related to the susy breaking order parameters . in the supernatural inflation models ,",
    "the size of @xmath104 can be also related to the scale naturally .",
    "another implication of the waterfall potential comes from a symmetry of the potential .",
    "the symmetry can be utilized to suppress dangerous proton decay operators . due to the symmetry ,",
    "some of the fields remains light ( @xmath116 ) in the multiplet to break gut symmetry .",
    "contrary to the usual gut superpotential , cubic terms of the field whose vev breaks gut symmetry is absent . as a consequence , there can be an accidental global symmetry ( which may be softly broken ) , and the fields can be light to be tev scale ( or susy breaking scale ) , which can have an phenomenological implication .",
    "in the potential of the hybrid inflation , a large vev of the waterfall field is suggested .",
    "the large vev is available to break a unified symmetry .",
    "as we have mentioned in the previous section , the waterfall potential should have a symmetry which can be adopted to explain a phenomenological issue in the unified models .",
    "to explain these features , we consider the unified model , in which the unified gauge symmetry is directly broken down to sm by a vev of the waterfall field , ( 1 ) .",
    "flipped - su(5 ) model @xcite , whose gauge symmetry is @xmath117 , ( 2 ) .",
    "pati - salam model @xcite , whose gauge symmetry is @xmath118 .",
    "the brief introductions of the models are given in appendix [ b ] .",
    "in the flipped - su(5 ) model , the gauge symmetry can be broken by @xmath119 under the @xmath117 symmetry . the * 10 * representation under su(5 )",
    "is two - rank anti - symmetric tensor .",
    "the vevs of @xmath120 and @xmath121 ( those are singlet components under sm gauge group ) can directly break @xmath122 down to sm .",
    "the symmetry breaking can occur via the waterfall superpotential : @xmath123    as many people concern , gut models have doublet - triplet splitting problem . in the flipped - su(5 )",
    "model , the doublet - triplet splitting can be realized simply .",
    "the higgs multiplets which include mssm higgs doublets ( @xmath124 ) are : @xmath125 the multiplets also include colored - triplets @xmath126 . then , the following superpotential is allowed .",
    "@xmath127 the vev of @xmath128 and @xmath121 ( @xmath129 ) to break the gut symmetry makes the colored triplet heavy because @xmath130 multiplet has a colored - triplet higgs component @xmath131 ( so - called missing partner ) .",
    "the higgs doublet , on the other hand , does not acquire masses from @xmath132 .    the higgs mass term is @xmath133 where @xmath134 and @xmath135 are mass parameters of @xmath130 and @xmath136 multiplets .",
    "the doublet higgs mass ( usually called higgsino mass @xmath137 ) should be small , and therefore @xmath135 should be small , which can originate from the accidental discrete symmetry ( by assuming @xmath85-symmetry , @xmath138 , @xmath139 , etc ) which can spoil the dt splitting can be forbidden by r - symmetry . the concrete r symmetry is written in @xcite . ] ) to construct the waterfall potential in gut .",
    "the interesting feature of this mechanism is that the proton decay via the exchange of colored higgs fields ( dimension 5 operator ) can be suppressed .",
    "indeed , we assume that the matter fields does not couple to @xmath130 , but couple to @xmath136 via yukawa interaction ( neglecting to show coupling constants and generation indices explicitly ) by a symmetry to construct the waterfall potential : @xmath140 then , integrating out the heavy colored higgs field , we obtain @xmath141 and the operator is suppressed by a factor @xmath142 : @xmath143_{22 }   ( m_{h_c}^{-1})_{22 } = \\frac{m_t}{m_t m_h - \\langle t\\rangle\\langle \\bar t\\rangle } \\sim \\frac{m_t}{\\langle t\\rangle } \\frac1{m_g}.\\ ] ] it is interesting to note that @xmath134 has to be much smaller than the gut scale @xmath144 in our inflation framework .",
    "in fact , even if we consider the correction from susy breaking sector , the mass parameter @xmath134 is up to the susy breaking order parameter , @xmath145 .",
    "this is responsible for a symmetry to obtain the waterfall potential for the hybrid inflation .",
    "this means our inflation model is compatible with proton decay suppressing .    the inflation model in the flipped - su(5 ) model with the waterfall potential",
    "is also constructed in ref.@xcite . in their model ,",
    "the singlet field is the inflaton . in this paper",
    ", we construct the quartic hilltop potential term in terms of the matter fields .",
    "the hilltop potential can be constructed in terms of the matter superfields , and the scalar partners of the quarks and leptons can cause the inflation .",
    "let us describe the hilltop potential in the flipped - su(5 ) model .",
    "the matter content of the flipped - su(5 ) model ( see appendix [ b ] for more detail ) is @xmath146 where @xmath147 is a generation index .",
    "the yukawa couplings are : @xmath148 the dirac neutrino yukawa coupling is unified with the up - type quark yukawa coupling @xmath149 .",
    "because the representation of the fields @xmath130 to break the @xmath122 symmetry down to sm are same as the matter filed @xmath150 , one has to adopt a discrete symmetry ( or @xmath85-symmetry ) to distinguish them",
    ". the symmetry can be also useful to obtain the waterfall potential .",
    "cubic terms of the matter representations are not invariant under the gauge symmetry . in the usual su(5 ) gut , @xmath151 term is allowed . this term is not singlet under @xmath152 in the flipped - su(5 ) model . the possible quartic terms in terms of the matter multiplets are @xmath153 in usual su(5 ) gut , since @xmath154 and @xmath155 have same quantum charges , and they can be replace .",
    "however , in the flipped - su(5 ) model , since they have different @xmath152 charges , the replacement is forbidden .",
    "we note that the quartic higgs term @xmath156 is allowed .",
    "it can however destabilize the electroweak symmetry breaking ( which is the same circumstances as in mssm ) due to a diagram with quadratic divergence , and both @xmath157 and @xmath156 have to be suppressed by a symmetry    the auxiliary field in the vector multiplet ( so - called @xmath3-term ) generates the @xmath3-term potential .",
    "the khler potential of the matter superfields are given as @xmath158 then , the @xmath3-term for @xmath159 and @xmath152 are obtained as @xmath160    one can find that @xmath3-flatness ( vanishing @xmath3-term potential ) condition is satisfied , for example , for @xmath161 where subscripts denote the flavor indices and the italic superscripts denote the gauge group indices .",
    "we stress that the @xmath2-term potential is lifted - up if the generation indices are given as their mass eigenstates : @xmath162 the up - quark yukawa coupling is about @xmath163 , and the coupling of quartic term is about @xmath164 , which is not negligible .",
    "the @xmath2-term potential always provides a concave upward piece , which is not suitable to obtain @xmath165 . without loss of generality , using the unitary rotation in the generation space , one can take a basis where @xmath166 where @xmath167 stands for any non - zero values . under this generation configuration , both @xmath2- and @xmath3-flatness can be satisfied .",
    "this is because there are three generations .",
    "the components correspond to the sm component fields , @xmath168 we are using the conventional flavor notation for simplicity , but these are not given as mass eigenstates . considering a non - renormalizable superpotential term @xmath169 we obtain the hilltop potential term ( up to a phase ) @xmath170",
    "one can also find that the @xmath3-flatness condition is satisfied for @xmath171 which corresponds to @xmath172 and @xmath173 .",
    "we note that the @xmath3-term vanishes if @xmath174 .",
    "this is because the group generator is traceless in simple groups . through this superpotential term",
    ", baryon number @xmath99 and lepton number @xmath175 can be generated by affleck - dine ( ad ) mechanism , when the inflaton oscillates .",
    "however , @xmath176 is not generated .",
    "other example of the @xmath3-flat direction is @xmath177 which are in the sm component fields , @xmath178 and @xmath179 . in this direction , both baryon and lepton numbers are not generated by ad mechanism .",
    "the @xmath180 coupling ( @xmath181 term in the superpotential ) is needed to obtain the hybrid potential .",
    "one can consider a variety of models for this coupling .",
    "we will present examples to construct a model .    in the flipped - su(5 ) model ,",
    "the right - handed neutrino is not a gauge singlet . to acquire the right - handed neutrino majorana mass ,",
    "the gut symmetry breaking vev is available .",
    "for example , one can consider the following superpotential to obtain the right - handed neutrino majorana mass : @xmath182 where @xmath70 is a gauge singlet .",
    "then , the right - handed neutrino majorana mass is obtained as @xmath183 .",
    "more precisely , the seesaw mechanism to obtain the sub ev active neutrino mass becomes so - called double seesaw .",
    "naively , @xmath184 is of the order of gut scale ( or planck scale ) , and the @xmath180 coupling should be much less than @xmath185 , depending on the generation of @xmath186 we choose .",
    "for example , if we choose @xmath184 to be the gut scale ( vev of @xmath130 ) , suitable size of @xmath180 coupling is about 0.01 to obtain the right - handed majorana mass to be @xmath187 gev .",
    "choosing the @xmath3-flat direction with the right - handed neutrino components ( in * 10 * ) : e.g. , @xmath188 or @xmath189 the superpotential term @xmath190 or @xmath191 can induce the hilltop potential . from the @xmath3-flatness ,",
    "generations of @xmath192 and @xmath193 have to be different .",
    "this is same for the generations of @xmath194 and @xmath195 .",

    "the @xmath185 size of this term can be problematic to cause a rapid proton decay depending on the flavor configuration . to satisfy the @xmath2-flatness",
    ", the flavor configuration has to be chosen ( as described ) , and the required hilltop term may contain the 1st and 2nd generation much . then , it is dangerous even if the sfermion masses are 100 tev , especially for the operator @xmath198 , which contains left - handed proton decay operator @xmath200 .",
    "the gaugino dressing for the proton decay operators can suppress the proton decay amplitude by a factor @xmath201 .",
    "the light gaugino scenario is favored to suppress the proton decay via the hilltop term .",
    "we note that for the case of @xmath202 , one can choose @xmath203 to be the 3rd generation ( right - handed tau lepton in the mass eigenstate ) , but * 10 * and @xmath204 are 1st and 2nd generations .",

    "then , the right - handed operator @xmath206 is not dangerous because tau lepton is heavier than proton unless a large flavor changing current is affected by susy breaking slepton masses .",
    "one can adopt @xmath207 representations as a waterfall @xmath12 field , whose vev gives a right - handed neutrino majorana mass directly by a @xmath208 coupling .",
    "for example , there is a majorana mass term @xmath209 which can be identified to the @xmath210 coupling to obtain the hybrid potential , for the right - handed neutrino component in @xmath211 is a ( part of ) inflaton , and @xmath212 is identified as @xmath71 which does not contribute to the inflation .",
    "the smallness of @xmath180 coupling can be related to the majorana mass scale , which should be smaller than the gut / planck scale . in this case",
    ", the vev of @xmath207 can also break the @xmath122 down to sm .",
    "contrary to the @xmath213 waterfall fields , they are not utilized to realize the doublet - triplet splitting .",
    "therefore , as a building block for this structure , one can consider pati - salam model in a simple manner .    before moving to describe the inflation in the pati - salam model , we comment on the decays of inflaton and waterfall fields .",
    "sometimes , it is said that the decay of the lightest particle of @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath71 is kinematically blocked due to the symmetry to obtain the hybrid inflation potential .",
    "actually , the superpotential term @xmath214 has a parity symmetry ( assigning @xmath215 to @xmath71 , @xmath12 and @xmath216 , and @xmath217 to the inflaton @xmath11 ) .",
    "inflaton @xmath11 can decay to the sm particle , via the yukawa coupling , one may think that one of @xmath71 and @xmath12 can not decay due to the kinematical block .",
    "however , the parity symmetry is violated via the non - zero values of the waterfall fields .",
    "let us explain it in a concrete example : @xmath218 where the right - handed neutrino is the ( part of ) inflaton and the waterfall field is @xmath219 . because there has to be multiple @xmath70 fields to obtain the majorana masses of three right - handed neutrinos",
    ", we write the index of @xmath70 explicitly .",
    "the inflaton field is the right - handed majorana neutrino and its mass is a little less than the unification scale , @xmath220 after falling down the waterfall potential .",
    "the inflaton field can decay into mssm field directly through the dirac neutrino yukawa coupling @xmath221 .",
    "the field @xmath70 is mixed with @xmath222 in @xmath223 via the non - zero value of @xmath12 , it can decay into the mssm field directly ( without decaying into @xmath12 ) . as a consequence",
    ", both @xmath12 and @xmath71 can decay into mssm fields after all . in the case where we adopt @xmath224 as waterfall fields , the situation is the same as above .",
    "in the pati - salam model , the gauge symmetry is @xmath118 , and the matter content of the model ( see appendix [ b ] for more detail ) is @xmath225    the pati - salam gauge symmetry is directly broken down to sm gauge symmetry by @xmath226 or @xmath227 .",
    "the non - zero values of them can generate the right - handed neutrino majorana masses as same as the flipped - su(5 ) model .",
    "therefore , the hybrid inflation model with hilltop potential can be easily constructed .",
    "because the dimension of the representation is less than the one in the flipped - su(5 ) model , it is easier to understand the field contents in it as a building block . in the model using @xmath227 to obtain the waterfall potential , the remnants in the representations can remain light due to the accidental discrete symmetry for the waterfall potential .",
