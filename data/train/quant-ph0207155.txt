    "one persisting source of troubles is decoherence , which smears out the results of the quantum computation , rendering them useless .",
    "one promising physical implementation for quantum computation that possesses relatively low decoherence is using trapped ions @xcite . in this paper , we present an approach for doing quantum computation with trapped ions that allows one to use only pairwise interaction and stay in a decoherence free subspace ( dfs ) @xcite .",
    "dfs are a subspace of states whose symmetry makes particular error operators act like the identity on the subspace .    for ion traps ,",
    "an important source of errors is long wavelength fluctuating magnetic fields . for neighboring groups of ions such long wavelength magnetic fields",
    "act as a collective phase error .",
    "a dfs exists for the collective phase error which has been studied by several groups .",

    "@xcite have developed a method to perform computation on this dfs uses entangling operations between groups of both two and four physical qubits .",

    "we explain how this could be done in linear ion traps using operations that have already been established . in section [ ion traps ]",
    "we briefly describe the physical system and then show how one can do universal computation using certain prepared encoded states and two sorensen - molmer - type gates @xcite . in section [ encoded ] , we will explain both why these gates are universal and why the encoded subspace is a dfs . in section [ end",
    "] , we conclude with some remarks about the feasibility of such an approach compared to other schemes for universal quantum computation in ion traps .",
    "our system is a string of @xmath0 two level ions in a linear ion trap @xcite . in a linear trap",
    "the confinement in the radial direction is stronger than the confinement in the axial direction . for small displacements of the atoms one can treat the motion of the system as n coupled one - dimensional harmonic oscillators .",
    "detailed calculations of the normal modes for a large number of atoms in experimentally realizable traps are now widely available @xcite .",
    "the scheme we outline below requires that each atom be individually addresed by a control laser .",
    "coupling between atoms is brought about by coupling the internal state of the ions to the motional mode of the string of ions .",
    "a variety of gates have been suggested to achieve this coupling @xcite . for our purposes , the coupling gate introduced by sorensen and",
    "molmer @xcite proves most useful .    the sorensen - molmer gate , described in @xcite , couples two ions via a two photon process that virtually populates the excited motional modes of the ion string .",
    "we briefly summarize their scheme here . by applying two lasers of opposite detuning to two ions , @xmath1 and @xmath2 ,",
    "one creates the following effective hamiltonian :    @xmath3    where @xmath4 is the on - resonant rabi frequency of each atom , @xmath5 is the lamb - dicke parameter , @xmath6 is the detuning , and @xmath7 is the pauli spin operator @xmath8 on atom @xmath1 .",
    "the lamb - dicke parameter @xmath5 is defined as the ration of the width of the zero point motion of the ion divided by the wavelength of applied field . in terms of the ion trap parameters , @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the frequency of the trap",
    ", @xmath11 is the mass of the ion , @xmath12 is the wavelength of the driving field , and @xmath13 is the angle between the wavevector of the light and the axial direction of the trap @xcite .    by changing the phase of the incoming laser pulses by @xmath14 , one can apply the slightly modified hamiltonian ,    @xmath15    note that @xmath16and @xmath17 commute . therefore , by applying @xmath16 followed by @xmath17 for equal times , one can perform the following unitary transformation    @xmath18 = \\exp ( -ith^{ij}).\\ ] ]    @xmath19 is an example of an anisotropic heisenberg exchange interaction ( often referred to as the xy hamiltonian ) .",
    "previous work in our group @xcite has shown that such two - body exchange hamiltonians can be utilized to perform universal quantum computation on encoded qubits .",
    "it has recently been shown by kempe et al .",
    "@xcite that the anisotropic exchange ( xy ) interaction is sufficient to generate universal encoded single - qubit and two - qubit operations .",
    "in particular , these universal gates may be generated over encoded subspaces spanned by either of the following qutrit code states consisting of three physical qubits : @xmath20 or @xmath21 .",
    "it has been shown that the anisotropic exchange interaction between two physical qubits within either of these encodings generates the full @xmath22 algebra , and hence also the @xmath23 group , over the logical qutrits . since @xmath24 , selecting a qubit out of the 3 qutrit states results in universal single qubit operations , as long as the full @xmath22 algebra is preserved .",
    "in addition , encoded two - qubit operations have been shown to be efficiently generated from the anisotropic exchange interaction.@xcite .",
    "the encoded space we employ here is a decoherence free subspace ( dfs ) with respect to collective dephasing .",
    "an operator corresponding to this error model is defined as @xmath25 , reflecting that all physical qubits of the computer simultaneously gather an identical random shift in the relative phase between their ground and excited level .",
    "we illustrate the dfs on a simple example of a logical qubit encoded into the states @xmath26 and @xmath27 of two physical qubits .",
    "collective dephasing simultaneously shifts relative phase of each of the physical two - level systems as follows : @xmath28 , @xmath29 .",
    "the logical qubit stays protected against collective dephasing because this phase shift becomes just an unimportant global phase identical for both logical qubit states .",
    "an important source of collective dephasing error in linear ion traps is long wavelength fluctuations in the ambient magnetic fields .",
    "work by kielpinski et .",
    "al @xcite shows that using the two qubit collective dfs states defined to protect against collective dephasing leads to an increased fidelity limited now only by the heating of the ion motional state .",
    "however the results of kempe et al . @xcite",
    "have shown that the anisotropic exchange interaction requires at least _ three qubits _ to serve as the logical qubit , with two posible qutrit codes ( @xmath30 and @xmath31 ) . therefore ,",
    "as indicated above , one needs to add a third ion in order to form a single logical qubit in the minimal encoding for the pairwise xy interaction .    the xy hamiltonian @xmath19 preserves the dfs and the qutrit codes . within the dfs , the collective dephasing operator @xmath32 commutes with the operator algebra generated by the xy interaction @xcite .",
    "intuitively , all states from either codes are transformed identically if all their physical qubits are simultaneously phase shifted as described in the example above .",
    "the qutrit codes @xmath30 and @xmath31 preserve the total number of qubits in the excited level @xcite .",
    "consequently , they are invariant under collective dephasing , @xmath32 .    the same properties with respect to the collective dephasing model are also valid for qubit encodings derived from qutrits @xcite .",
    "we illustrate this here on an example of the logical qubit encoded into the states @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "the relative phase between the code - words remains unchanged if all the physical qubits of value @xmath35 are simultaneously shifted by an arbitrary phase kick @xmath36 in the course of the collective dephasing process @xcite .    in the present case",
    ", we implement the xy interaction in steps , alternating the @xmath37 and @xmath38 operations . during this alternation",
    ", we could fall out of the dfs because the interactions @xmath37 and @xmath38 do not commute with the collective dephasing operator , @xmath32 .",
    "this departure from the dfs can however be minimized by rapidly switching between the @xmath37 and @xmath38 hamiltonians .",
    "this method of avoiding decoherence is similar to proposed bang - bang schemes @xcite . to illustrate this mechanism",
    ", we make a simple argument here to show why this is the case .",
    "assume we would like to apply the hamiltonian @xmath19 for a time t. one could imagine first applying @xmath37 for a time t then @xmath38 for a time t. or one could apply both operators @xmath39 times , each for a time t / n : @xmath40    assuming only collective decoherence , a simple population model , described below , shows a radically improved decoherence time .",
    "assume that the states outside of the dfs decay with some rate @xmath41 .",
    "we expect that the total decoherence will be proportional to the integral over time of @xmath41 times the population outside of the dfs , @xmath42 .",
    "an overestimate would be to assume no decoherence and to simply integrate over the population outside of the dfs during our operation .",
    "let us examine the unitary operator @xmath43 = \\cos ( t){\\bf i } + i\\sin ( t)\\sigma^i_y\\sigma^j_y$ ] .",
    "if this operator was applied to a state in the dfs subspace , i.e. a qubit from either @xmath30 or @xmath31 , the identity would of course preserve this codespace and the population that has left the codespace , @xmath44 , would then be proportional to @xmath45",
    ". the integrated population from 0 to @xmath46 would then be proportional to @xmath47 .",
    "following this operator by the application of @xmath48 $ ] will return us completely to the subspace , and by symmetry leads to a total integrated population proportional to @xmath49 .",
    "returning to eq .",
    "[ 4 ] , we see that by applying our operators for a time @xmath50 , we can achieve a total integrated population proportional to @xmath51 . for @xmath39 large",
    "compared to @xmath52 , the decoherence is simply proportional to @xmath53 .",
    "therefore , one expects a quadratic improvement in the fidelity with the number of steps , @xmath39 , fig . [ 1 ] .",
    ", obtained by using a series of 2 @xmath39 alternating pulses , from that obtained by applying the @xmath54 interaction followed by the @xmath55 interaction once ( @xmath39=1 ) .",
    "one can clearly see that the total integrated population outside of the dfs , @xmath56 , will be reduced as one increases the number of alternations , @xmath39 . ]    to test this simple model , we calculated the evolution of the density matrix assuming collective decoherence and a hamiltonian that alternates @xmath39 times between @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",

    "the resulting system density matrix @xmath59 was then compared with the expected density matrix , @xmath58 , if instead one could apply the xy hamiltonian directly .",
    "the plot shows operation error , 1-@xmath62 , as a function of the number of steps , @xmath39 , where @xmath62 is the fidelity , @xmath63 the strength of the collective decoherence , @xmath41 , was set equal to the strength of the driving hamiltonian , @xmath64 , in this example .",
    "the fidelity was calculated after a time @xmath65 .",
    "a fit of the data for @xmath66 yields the expected @xmath67 dependence ( dashed line ) predicted by our simple population model ( see text ) . ]",
    "we have presented a scheme for a universal ion trap quantum computation on decoherence free subspaces using the sorensen - molmer two - body hamiltonian .",
    "rapid alternation of control pulses generates an effective two - body interaction which approximates the anisotropic exchange ( xy ) hamiltonian .",
    "this ensures universal quantum computation over dfs protected qubits , as a result of the anisotropic exchange interaction universality properties over logical qubits encoded into three physical qubits @xcite .",
    "the decoherence time improves quadratically with the number of alterations , @xmath39 , for a given total pulse duration @xmath52 .",
    "our scheme is scalable when one assumes the array - based architecture proposed by kielpinski et .",
    "al . @xcite . in that scheme",
    "single encoded qubits are held in individual traps .",
    "pairs of encoded qubits are then moved into the same trap in order to perform two qubit operations .",
    "the advantage of such a scheme is that one can avoid the unfavorable scaling of the two qubit interaction strength as one puts more ions into the same trap .",
    "furthermore , by encoding the ions into dfs , qubit coherences are protected when moving the ions from trap to trap .",
    "there are several differences for the physical implementation of our scheme compared to @xcite .",
    "our scheme requires one extra ion per logical qubit and each ion has to be individually addressed .",
    "our operations take us out of the dfs , although this can be mitigated by the rapid alternation of pulses .",
    "the alternation of pulses results in only a linear increase in the total number of physical operations .",
    "an advantage of our scheme is that we use only two qubit entangling operations , whereas the proposal of kielpinski et al .",
    "@xcite requires four - qubit entangling operations .",
    "two - qubit operations are inherently more robust to noise than four qubit entangling operations @xcite .",
    "one could imagine a hybrid proposal in which the qubits are stored in pairs of ions .",
    "single qubit operations are performed using the standard scheme @xcite .",
    "then when the qubits are brought together to do two qubit gates , two additional ions are placed in the trap allowing one to entangle the qubits only using two physical qubit operations as described here . this hybrid approach may offer greater flexibility .",
