    "gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) are one of the most violent explosions occurring in the deep universe . for recent reviews , see e.g. ref.@xcite . since their accidental discovery in 1967 by vela satellites , significant progresses have been made in the past decades in understanding the properties of grbs . thanks to the combined contributions from various ground - based and space - borne instruments , the time resolved spectra and light curves can be observed with high precision in wide energy bands .",
    "however , several models can explain the observed spectra and light curves equally well .",
    "the emission mechanism of grbs remains a mystery after about half a century researches .",
    "the polarimetric observations , on the other hand , provide a useful supplementary to the spectra and light curves to reveal the central engine .",
    "recently , it is found that photons in the prompt phase of some bright grbs are highly linearly polarized , and may be as high as @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "for example , coburn & boggs @xcite claimed to have detected a polarization of @xmath3 in grb 021206 , although a later reanalysis found no significant polarization signal in this same burst @xcite .",
    "kalemci et al .",
    "@xcite analyzed the data of grb 041219a and obtained a polarization fraction @xmath4 , in spite of the large statistical uncertainty .",
    "a detailed analysis of grb 041219a showed that polarization degree is anti - correlated with photon energy @xcite .",
    "the temporal evolution of polarization has also been detected @xcite .",
    "interestingly , it was found with high confidence that the polarization angle of grb 100826a changes @xmath5 between two time periods @xcite .",
    "photons in the afterglow can also be linearly polarized .",
    "however , polarization in the afterglow is in general much smaller than that in the prompt phase , and it is usually below @xmath1 .",
    "for example , hjorth et al .",
    "@xcite found an upper limit of @xmath6 on the polarization of optical afterglow of grb 990123 .",
    "covino et al .",
    "@xcite found the @xmath7 upper limit of @xmath8 in the optical afterglow of grb 011211 .",
    "bersier et al .",
    "@xcite reported a @xmath9 polarization in the optical afterglow of grb 020405 .",
    "steele et al .",
    "@xcite showed that the early optical afterglow of grb 090102 was polarized at @xmath10 .",
    "mundell et al .",
    "@xcite reported the detection of polarization @xmath11 in the immediate afterglow of grb 120308a , which decreases to @xmath12 over the subsequent ten minutes .",
    "circular polarization is also possible , but it is very small , especially in the afterglow phase @xcite .",
    "several theoretical models have been proposed to account for the polarimetric observations , see e.g. ref.@xcite for recent review .",
    "one of the most promising mechanisms is the synchrotron radiation .",
    "it is well known that photons produced by synchrotron radiation can be highly polarized .",
    "the polarization properties of synchrotron radiation strongly depends on the magnetic configurations .",
    "there are three magnetic configurations that are widely discussed in literatures : ( 1 ) ordered magnetic field in the shock plane @xcite , ( 2 ) ordered magnetic field perpendicular to the shock plane @xcite , and ( 3 ) random magnetic field confined in the shock plane @xcite .",
    "the first two globally ordered magnetic fields can be carried out by the jet from the central engine @xcite , while the random magnetic field can be produced by the shock @xcite .",
    "an alternative mechanism able to produce highly polarized photons is the compton scattering process .",
    "lazzati et al .",
    "@xcite calculated the polarization properties of an isotropic photon field upscattered by a relativistic jet , and found that the polarization can be as large as in the point - source limit . however , they only discussed in the thomson limit , and the seed photons were completely unpolarized .",
    "in fact , the seed photons are very likely to originate from synchrotron radiation , thus are initially polarized .",
    "krawczynski @xcite calculated the polarization properties of inverse compton emission and synchrotron self - compton ( ssc ) emission using numerical simulations , and found that large polarization is possible . in a series of recent papers @xcite , we presented a detailed calculation on the polarization properties of an initially polarized photon scattered by isotropic electrons with arbitrary energy distribution .",
    "we found that the final polarization spans a wide range , depending on the initial polarization state of the incident photon and the energy distribution of electrons . in this model , both the energy dependence of polarization degree in grb 041219a and the change of polarization angle in grb 100826a can be naturally explained @xcite .",
    "the magnetic - dominated jet model is gradually becoming one of the most popular models nowadays due to its ability to explain a number of observational phonomania , such as spectra , light curves and polarization @xcite .",
    "more importantly , in the magnetic - dominated jet model , the jet can be effectively accelerated to a highly relativistic velocity , and the radiation efficiency can be large compared to the baryon - dominated jet model @xcite .",
    "the ssc process is a natural result of the magnetic - dominated jet model . according to this model , grb prompt",
    "emissions are produced through synchrotron radiation and compton scattering process in a highly relativistic jet dominated by poynting flux .",
    "the magnetic field ejected from the central engine is likely to be ordered in large scale , either parallel or perpendicular to the shock plane .",
    "afterglows are assumed to be produce through synchrotron radiation in the external shock region when the jet collides with interstellar medium .",
    "the magnetic field produced by the shock in interstellar medium is possibly random . in the early afterglow region",
    ", the electron density may be still large enough such that the compton scattering may play a role .",
    "in fact , sari & esin @xcite have computed the spectrum of the inverse compton emission in afterglow and found that it can dominate the total cooling rate of the afterglow for several months or even years after the prompt emission .",
    "the ssc radiation may occur in afterglow phase if the grbs explode in a reasonably dense medium .",
    "in a recent paper @xcite , we have calculated the polarization properties of the ssc process from a highly relativistic jet in two ordered magnetic configurations .",
    "we found that in both cases , a maximum polarization degree of @xmath13 is possible if the seed electrons are isotropic .",
    "we also showed that the polarization - luminosity relation in these two magnetic configurations is very different , which can be used to constrain the magnetic configuration in the future when a large amount of polarimetric data is available .",
    "there is another widely discussed magnetic configuration in literature but have not involved in our previous calculation , i.e. , random magnetic field confined in the shock plane .",
    "it is useful to calculate the polarization properties in such a magnetic configuration , because grb afterglows are often assumed to occur in external shock region where the magnetic field is likely to be random . in this paper",
    "we will give a detailed calculation on the polarization properties of the ssc process in random magnetic field .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we calculate the power spectrum and polarization properties of the synchrotron radiation in random magnetic field . in section iii ,",
    "we briefly review the polarization of a photon scattered by electrons with any spectral distribution . in section iv",
    ", we calculate the polarization properties of the ssc process from a highly relativistic jet , in which the magnetic field is randomly distributed in the shock plane .",
    "finally , discussions and conclusions are given in section v.",
    "in this section , we calculate the power spectrum and polarization properties of synchrotron radiation in random magnetic field case .",
    "we assume that the magnetic field is uniform in strength but random in direction , and it is fully confined in the shock plane .",
    "we further assume that the length scale of magnetic field is larger than the lammor radius such that the classical synchrotron radiation formulae are applicable .",
    "we first briefly review the properties of synchrotron radiation in uniform magnetic field .",
    "the geometry of synchrotron radiation is depicted in fig.[fig : geometry1 ] .",
    "the magnetic field is along the @xmath14-axis , and the electron velocity is along the @xmath15 direction .",
    "the cartesian coordinate is chosen such that @xmath15 is in the @xmath16 plane . @xmath17 and @xmath18 are two unit vectors in the @xmath16 plane and perpendicular to this plane , respectively , and @xmath19 .",
    "recall that for a relativistic electron moving in the uniform magnetic field @xmath20 , the radiation is mainly confined in a small cone centering on the direction of electron velocity .",
    "the radiating power spectrum of a single electron is given by @xcite @xmath21 where @xmath22 , @xmath23 is the modified bessel function of order @xmath24 , @xmath25 is the critical frequency , @xmath26 is the lorentz factor of the electron , @xmath27 is the rest mass of electron , and @xmath28 is the pitch angle , i.e. , the angle between the electron velocity and the magnetic field .        the radiating power spectrum can be divided into two parts of different polarization states , @xmath29 , where @xmath30,\\\\      \\displaystyle p_2(\\omega)=\\frac{\\sqrt{3}e^3b\\sin\\alpha}{4\\pi m_e c^2}\\left[f\\left(\\frac{\\omega}{\\omega_c}\\right)+g\\left(\\frac{\\omega}{\\omega_c}\\right)\\right ] .",

    "the polarization degree is defined by @xmath36    for power - law electrons , @xmath37 , we can integrate over the electrons to obtain the total radiating power . through a straightforward calculation",
    "we obtain @xmath38 the polarization degree is obtained from eq.([eq : pi_single ] ) by the following replacements : @xmath39 , and @xmath40 .",
    "thus we have @xmath41 note that the polarization degree is independent of photon energy , and it only depends on the power - law index of incident electrons .",
    "the index @xmath42 is usually in the range @xmath43 , thereby @xmath44 @xcite .    now consider that the magnetic field is along the direction of azimuth angle @xmath45 in the @xmath46 plane , i.e. , the @xmath47 direction in fig.[fig : geometry1 ] .",
    "for power - law electrons moving in this magnetic field , the radiating power spectrum is also given by eq.([eq : power_pl ] ) .",
    "in this case , however , @xmath48 and @xmath49 are defined in a new frame @xmath50 , which is the @xmath51 frame rotating an angle @xmath52 with respect to @xmath15 direction , such that @xmath53 is in the @xmath54 plane , and therefore @xmath55 is perpendicular to this plane .",

    "the polarization is insensitive to @xmath42 , but it strongly depends on @xmath78 . as @xmath78 increases from 0 , the net polarization will firstly decreases .",

    "we found that the maximum polarization degree is usually @xmath149 if the seed electrons are isotropically distributed .",
    "this is consistent with the observation fact that the polarization of grb afterglow is seldom larger than @xmath1 .",
    "interestingly , if the two magnetic components ( random and uniform ) decay with time in different speeds , then the polarization angle may rotate @xmath2 during the temporal evolution . for example , the flux conservation requires that the transverse ( random ) component decays as @xmath150 , and the radial ( uniform ) component decays as @xmath151 , where @xmath152 is the distance to the central engine @xcite . at first , the uniform component dominates over the random component , i.e. @xmath153 . as the jet expands , both components decay .",
    "since the uniform component decays faster than the random component , after a critical radius the latter will dominate over the former and thus @xmath154 .",
    "the polarization angle will change @xmath2 at a critical value @xmath155 .",
    "note that the polarization measurements of grb afterglow are usually performed in the optical band . in this low energy band ,",

    "<S> linear polarization have been observed in both the prompt phase and afterglow of some bright gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) . </S>",
    "<S> polarization in the prompt phase spans a wide range , and may be as high as @xmath0 . in the afterglow phase , however , it is usually below @xmath1 . according to the standard fireball model , grbs are produced by synchrotron radiation and compton scattering process in a highly relativistic jet ejected from the central engine . </S>",
    "<S> it is widely accepted that prompt emissions occur in the internal shock when shells with different velocities collide with each other , and the magnetic field advected by the jet from the central engine can be ordered in large scale . on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> afterglows are often assumed to occur in the external shock when the jet collides with interstellar medium , and the magnetic field produced by the shock through , e.g. weibel instability , is possibly random . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> , we calculate the polarization properties of the synchrotron self - compton process from a highly relativistic jet , in which the magnetic field is randomly distributed in the shock plane . </S>",
    "<S> we also consider the generalized situation where a uniform magnetic component perpendicular to the shock plane is superposed on the random magnetic component . we show that , the polarization is hardly to be larger than @xmath1 if the seed electrons are isotropic in the jet frame . </S>",
    "<S> this may account for the observed upper limit of polarization in the afterglow phase of grbs . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , if the random and uniform magnetic components decay with time in different speeds , then the polarization angle may change @xmath2 duration the temporal evolution . </S>"
