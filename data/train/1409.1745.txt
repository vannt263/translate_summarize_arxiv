    "imagine that you are observing a sample path @xmath17 of the continuous process @xmath5 started at @xmath1 and that you wish to detect when this sample path reaches a level @xmath2 that is not directly observable .",
    "situations of this type occur naturally in many applied problems , and there is a whole range of hypotheses that can be introduced to study various particular aspects of the problem . assuming that @xmath5 and @xmath2 are independent , and denoting by @xmath18 the first entry time of @xmath5 at @xmath2 , it was shown recently ( see  @xcite ) that the median / quantile rule minimises not only the spatial expectation @xmath19 $ ] ( dating back to r. j. boscovich 17111787 ) but also the _ temporal _ expectation @xmath20 $ ] over all stopping times @xmath21 of @xmath5 where @xmath16 is a positive constant . motivated by this development , and seeking for further insights and connections , in this paper we study the `` mixed '' variational problem @xmath22,\\ ] ] which appears in the classic formulation of quickest detection due to shiryaev ( see @xcite and @xcite , sections  22 and 24 and the references therein ) .",
    "the key difference between ( [ 11 ] ) and the classic formulation is that the unobservable time @xmath18 in  ( [ 11 ] ) is obtained through the uncertainty in the space domain ( as the first entry time of @xmath5 at the unknown level @xmath2 ) , while the unobservable time in the classic formulation is obtained through the uncertainty in the time domain ( as the unknown level itself ) .",
    "unlike the classic formulation , however , we do not assume that the probabilistic characteristics of @xmath5 change following @xmath18 so that there is no learning about the position of @xmath2 through the observation of @xmath5 ( quickest detection problems of this kind require a different treatment and will be studied elsewhere ) .",
    "likewise , since the underlying loss processes @xmath23 and @xmath24 are not adapted to the natural filtration generated by @xmath5 ( or its usual augmentation ) , we see that problem ( [ 11 ] ) belongs to the class of `` optimal prediction '' problem ( within optimal stopping ) .",
    "similar optimal prediction problems have been studied in recent years by many authors ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "it may be noted in this context that the nonadapted factor @xmath18 in the optimal prediction problem ( [ 11 ] ) is not revealed at the `` end '' of time ( i.e. , it is not measurable with respect to the @xmath25-algebra generated by the process @xmath5 ) .    while the median / quantile rule was derived in @xcite for general ( continuous ) processes , a closer analysis of the mixed variational problem ( [ 11 ] )",
    "reveals that this generality can hardly be maintained .",
    "for this reason we restrict our attention to a smaller class of processes and assume that @xmath0 is a one - dimensional diffusion starting at @xmath1 and solving @xmath26 where @xmath27 and @xmath28 are continuous functions , and @xmath29 is a standard brownian motion . to gain tractability",
    "we also assume that the distribution function @xmath3 of @xmath2 is strictly increasing and twice continuously differentiable . in the first step",
    "we show that problem ( [ 11 ] ) is equivalent to the optimal stopping problem @xmath30,\\ ] ] where @xmath8 is the range process of @xmath31 ( i.e. , the difference between the running maximum and the running minimum of @xmath10 ) and @xmath11 .",
    "this problem is of independent interest and the appearance of the range process is novel in this context revealing also that the problem is fully three - dimensional .",
    "two - dimensional versions of a related problem ( when @xmath32 and @xmath16 constant ) were initially studied and solved in important special cases of diffusion processes in @xcite and @xcite . the general solution to problems of this kind",
    "was derived in the form of the maximality principle in @xcite ; see also section  13 and chapter  v in  @xcite and the other references therein .",
    "in these two - dimensional problems @xmath16 was a function of @xmath33 instead .",
    "more recent contributions and studies of related problems include @xcite ; see also @xcite and @xcite for related results in optimal control theory .",
    "close three - dimensional relatives of the problem ( [ 13 ] ) also appear in the recent papers @xcite and @xcite where the problems were effectively solved by guessing and finding the optimal stopping boundary in a closed form .",
    "these optimal stopping boundaries are still curves in the state space .    in this paper",
    "we show how problem ( [ 13 ] ) can be solved when ( i ) no closed - form solution for the candidate stopping boundary is available , and ( ii ) the optimal stopping boundaries are no longer curves in the state space .",
    "this is done by extending the arguments associated with the maximality principle @xcite to the three - dimensional setting of the problem ( [ 13 ] ) and disclosing the general structure of the solution that is valid in all particular cases . in this way",
    "we find that that the optimal stopping boundary consists of two surfaces which can be characterised as extremal solutions to a couple of first - order nonlinear pdes .",
    "more precisely , replacing @xmath34 in problem ( [ 13 ] ) above with a more general function @xmath35 specified below , we show that the following stopping time is optimal : @xmath36 where the surfaces @xmath14 and @xmath15 can be characterised as the minimal and maximal solutions to @xmath37 } \\nonumber\\\\[-8pt]\\label{15 } \\\\[-8pt ] & & { } \\times \\biggl [ 1 - \\int_i^{f(i , s ) } \\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial i}(i , y , s ) \\frac{l(y ) - l(i)}{(\\sigma^2 /2)(y ) l'(y ) } \\,dy \\biggr],\\nonumber \\\\",

    "a plain comparison with the median / quantile rule from @xcite shows that the structure of problem ( [ 11 ] ) is inherently more complicated and the optimal stopping time @xmath41 may be viewed as a nonlinear median / quantile rule .",
    "the optimal surfaces @xmath14 and @xmath15 combined with the excursions of @xmath10 away from @xmath42 and @xmath43 exhibit interesting dynamics ( not present in the two - dimensional setting ) which we describe in fuller detail as we progress below .",
    "this dynamics may be combined with lagrange multipliers to tackle the constrained variant of the problem ( [ 11 ] ) where the probability error of early stopping is bounded from above ( we do not pursue this in the present paper ) .",
    "it is also easily seen that swapping the order of @xmath21 and @xmath18 in ( [ 11 ] ) leads to optimal stopping at the diagonal and thus corresponds to the linear median / quantile rule .",
    "the key arguments developed in the proof rely heavily upon the extremal properties of the optimal surfaces and should be applicable in similar multi - dimensional settings .",
    "in this section we will first formulate the quickest detection of a hidden target problem and then show that this problem is equivalent to an optimal stopping problem for the range process .",
    "the latter problem will be studied in the next section .",
    "let @xmath0 be a one - dimensional diffusion process starting at @xmath1 and solving @xmath44 where @xmath27 and @xmath28 are continuous functions , and @xmath29 is a standard brownian motion . to meet a sufficient condition used in the proof of theorem  [ teo1 ] below",
    "we will also assume that @xmath45 is ( locally ) lipschitz .",
    "let @xmath2 be an independent random variable with values in @xmath46 , and let @xmath47 be the first entry time of @xmath5 at the level @xmath2 .",

    "note that @xmath51 represents the probability of early stopping and @xmath52 represents the expectation of late stopping when a stopping time @xmath21 of @xmath5 is being applied .",
