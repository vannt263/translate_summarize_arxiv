    ", a numerical study has demonstrated that essentially almost all two - mode gaussian states are non - classical@xcite .",
    "the typical example of a non - classical gaussian state is a squeezed state .",
    "squeezing represents an essential ingredient to establish entanglement between two or more modes in a global gaussian state@xcite ; entanglement , in turn , constitutes an unambiguous quantum trait , ultimately enabling better - than - classical realisations of communication primitives such as quantum teleportation@xcite . for this reason",
    ", the structure and distribution of bipartite and multipartite entanglement in multimode gaussian states , and its operational significance for teleportation and related schemes , has been extensively studied in recent years@xcite .",
    "one could then ask whether non - entangled gaussian states are just `` classical '' . surprisingly enough",
    ", this question was settled only very recently .",
    "the concurrent works of giorda and paris@xcite and adesso and datta@xcite provide a clear , negative answer to that .",
    "in those studies , a paradigm more general than the entanglement - versus - separability one@xcite has been explored to assess the quantumness of correlations in bipartite gaussian states .",
    "this paradigm was proposed one decade ago in two pioneering independent works by zurek and vedral ( and their collaborators)@xcite .",
    "they identified signatures of quantumness stemming directly from the non - commutativity of quantum observables , which can be retrieved for instance in the fact that local measurements on one or more subsystems of a quantum composite system typically induce a disturbance on the state of the system , at striking variance with what happens when extracting marginal information from a classical joint probability distribution .",
    "this generally happens in entangled as well as in generic separable quantum states .",
    "precisely , this is the case for almost all quantum states , and the purely classically correlated ( or `` classical '' ) states constitute just a null measure , nowhere dense subset of any composite hilbert space@xcite .",
    "the classical states are just those with a ` collapsed ' wavefunction , also known as pointer states@xcite , whose density matrix is diagonal in some local product basis . for a more precise mathematical definition , please refer to the paper by gharibian et al . in this special issue@xcite .    the evidence of quantum correlations in separable states has been mostly ignored until it was speculated that such correlations might be at the root of the quantum speed - up in computational algorithms that run over mixed qubit registers , such as the dqc1 model@xcite . in an attempt to capture , operationally and/or from a more abstract perspective , the essence of general non - classical correlations , several measures have been proposed for their quantification , among which we mention refs .  @xcite . for two - mode gaussian states , detailed results are available concerning the evaluation of the quantum discord @xcite and of the ( ameliorated ) measurement - induced disturbance@xcite . in the case of quantum discord",

    "has recently led to the introduction of the `` geometric measure of quantum discord '' ( or geometric discord ) @xmath5 @xcite , which is easily computable in closed form for general two - qubit states .    in this paper",
    "we propose a generalisation of the geometric discord to gaussian states of cv systems .",
    "we define the `` gaussian geometric discord '' ( ggd ) as the minimum squared hilbert - schmidt distance between a gaussian state and the closest ` classical - quantum ' state obtained after a local generalised gaussian positive - operator - valued - measurement ( gpovm ) performed on one party only .",
    "focusing on two - mode gaussian states , we provide a covariance matrix formulation of the problem , and we solve the optimisation explicitly for the relevant subclass of two - mode squeezed thermal states : the optimal measurement in this case is shown to be a heterodyne detection , similarly to the case of conventional quantum discord@xcite , and the ggd turns out to be symmetric under swapping of the two parties .",
    "we then compare ggd with the quantum discord for two - mode squeezed thermal states .",
    "while an upper bound on ggd can be identified exactly at fixed quantum discord , states can be found with arbitrarily small ggd for any arbitrarily large quantum discord .",
    "we recognise this as a consequence of the known result that infinitely entangled states of cv systems are dense in norm in infinite - dimensional hilbert spaces@xcite .",
    "in fact , imposing simple physical constraints of finiteness of the mean energy , we are able to recover as well a hierarchy of lower bounds on ggd versus discord . we finally discuss possible alternative generalisations of the geometric discord@xcite to gaussian states .",
    "if one applies , for instance , the notion of minimum hilbert - schmidt distance from classical states directly at the level of covariance matrices , an easily computable measure of total quadrature correlations is obtained .",
    "the paper is structured as follows . in section [ secprelim ]",

    "from now on , we drop all the superscripts `` @xmath40 '' and always assume , implicitly , that all the states and measurements we consider are gaussian .",
    "we shall focus on two - mode gaussian states @xmath7 , specified by their @xmath41 covariance matrix @xmath42 which has to be positive definite and has to comply with the uncertainty principle , @xmath43 , to ensure its correspondence to a physical state .",

    "after the measurement , the state of mode @xmath9 is projected onto the seed @xmath48 , while the posterior state @xmath50 of mode @xmath14 has a covariance matrix that is crucially not dependent on the measurement outcome@xcite , being given by the schur complement @xmath51 this entails that no classically correlated mixture can be realised as the outcome of a local gaussian measurement , and the only classical - quantum two - mode gaussian states are just uncorrelated tensor product states , as already proven in@xcite .",
