    "two - component gross - pitaevskii ( gp ) equations describe the evolution of nonlinear excitations in various physical systems .",
    "apparently , it first appeared in nonlinear optics as a `` vector nonlinear schrdinger equation '' describing self - interaction of electromagnetic waves with account of their polarization ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . in the case of equal nonlinearity constants , this system is completely integrable by the inverse scattering transform method @xcite and many particular solutions have been found ( see , e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) . taking birefringence effects into account @xcite leads to even richer dynamics , as confirmed by experiments on propagation of light pulses in fibers @xcite .",
    "the recent surge of interest in vector solitons was caused by the realization of spinor atomic becs ( see the reviews @xcite and references therein ) as well as micro - cavity polariton condensates @xcite .    from the physical point of view , a specific feature of two - component condensates is the existence of two types of elementary excitations . in one mode both",
    "condensates move locally in phase . in the case of a small amplitude potential flow",
    "this corresponds to usual sound waves consisting in density oscillations . in another `` polarization '' mode the two components move in counter - phase in such a way that ,",
    "in some situations , the total density remains constant in spite of the excitation of relative motion of the condensate components .",
    "correspondingly , these two modes can have different values of the sound velocities and , due to different symmetries , their excitation demand different methods @xcite .",
    "in some sense , this is analogous to the situation observed for the first and second sound in superfluid heii : the second sound which corresponds to a temperature ( and entropy ) wave can not be excited by oscillations of the container wall , contrarily to the usual density waves associated with the first sound ; see , e.g. , @xcite .    in the present paper ,",
    "we study the weakly nonlinear evolution of these two modes in presence of small dispersive effects .",
    "whereas in this limit the density waves are described by the standard kdv equation which accounts for quadratic nonlinearities in the wave amplitude , the polarization mode is much more peculiar .",
    "we show that there are situations where one has to take into account third order nonlinearities in the wave amplitude and that the corresponding nonlinear polarization wave is then described by the gardner equation .",
    "as is well known , this is a quite generic equation which arises when the coefficient in the quadratic nonlinearity term is small and when the wave amplitude has the same order of magnitude as this coefficient .",
    "in particular , the gardner equation ( and also the modified kdv equation which shares strong similarities with it ) have been derived for interface waves in stratified fluid dynamics @xcite , lattice dynamics described by the discrete nonlinear schrdinger equation @xcite , and quantum dynamics of condensates in optical lattices @xcite .",
    "the gardner equation has a wide spectrum of different nonlinear excitations @xcite which can be generated by the flow of fluid past an obstacle @xcite .",
    "we expect that the phenomenology associated to this rich dynamics can be observed in experiments with flows of becs .",
    "we consider a two - component condensate confined in a one - dimensional structure ( e.g. , a cigar - shaped trap for atomic condensates or a quantum wire embedded into an elongated cavity for polariton condensate case ) in which the bec is described by a one - dimensional ( 1d ) two - component order parameter @xmath0 whose dynamics is modeled by a set of coupled gross - pitaevskii equations @xmath1",

    "hence in the case of interest in the present work , where @xmath2 is small compared to @xmath8 , one can legitimately denote the branch with dispersion @xmath64 the density modulation branch , and the one with dispersion @xmath68 the polarization modulation branch .",
    "in all the present work we suppose that @xmath70 which is the condition of modulation stability of the polarization mode ( see , e.g. , ref .",

    "in this paper , we have shown that for vector gp equation there exists a region of values of the nonlinearity constants for which this quite complicated system of equations can be reduced to a single nonlinear evolution equation  the so - called gardner equation .",
    "this equation describes the evolution of the nonlinear polarization excitations , that is of such excitations which in the linear limit reduce to the polarization sound waves with constant total density of the condensate .",
    "such an approach leads to several new types of nonlinear waves in the two - component condensates  algebraic solitons , solibores , breathers",
    ". numerical solution of the vector gp equation with corresponding initial data demonstrates that these new types of nonlinear excitations propagate without change of their properties during evolution , that is they are stable with respect to decay to more elementary excitations .",
    "although analytical description of the wave pattern exists at the moment in the small amplitude approximation only , similar large amplitude wave patterns can be described as exact numerical solutions of the vector gp equation .",
    "we expect that these new excitations can be generated in experiments by the flow of the two - component condensate past obstacles or by the phase and density engineering methods applied to the two - component condensate .",

    "<S> waves with different symmetries exist in two - component bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) whose dynamics is described by a system of coupled gross - pitaevskii ( gp ) equations . </S>",
    "<S> a first type of waves corresponds to excitations for which the motion of both components is locally in phase . in the second type of waves the two components have a counter - phase local motion . in the case of different values of inter- and intra - component interaction constants , </S>",
    "<S> the long wave - length behavior of these two modes corresponds to two types of sound with different velocities . in the limit of weak nonlinearity and small dispersion </S>",
    "<S> the first mode is described by the well - known korteweg - de vries ( kdv ) equation . </S>",
    "<S> we show that in the same limit the second mode can be described by the gardner ( modified kdv ) equation , if the intra - component interaction constants have close enough values . </S>",
    "<S> this leads to a rich phenomenology of nonlinear excitations ( solitons , kinks , algebraic solitons , breathers ) which does not exist in the kdv description . </S>"
