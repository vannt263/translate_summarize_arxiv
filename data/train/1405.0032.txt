    "channel state information at the transmitter ( csit ) plays an important role in interference management in wireless systems .",
    "interference networks with global and instantaneous csit provide a great improvement of performance .",
    "for example , in a @xmath0-user interference channel with global and instantaneous csit , the sum degrees of freedom ( sum - dof ) linearly increases with the number of user pairs @xmath0 @xcite , which is much higher than that of the interference channel with no csit @xcite . in practice , however , obtaining global and instantaneous csit for transmitter cooperation is especially challenging , when the transmitters are distributed and the mobility of wireless nodes increases . in an extreme case where",
    "the channel coherence time is shorter than the csi feedback delay , it is infeasible to acquire instantaneous csit in wireless systems .",
    "obtaining global knowledge of csit is another obstacle for realizing transmitter cooperation when the backhaul or feedback link capacity is very limited for csit sharing between the distributed transmitters .",
    "therefore , in this paper , we investigate a fundamental question : is it still possible to obtain dof benefits in interference networks under these two practical constraints@xmath1 in this paper we seek to answer this question by developing an interference alignment algorithm exploiting local and moderately - delayed csit .",
    "recently , an intriguing way of studying the effect of delayed csit in wireless networks has been initiated by the work @xcite .",
    "in particular , in the context of the vector broadcast channel , @xcite showed that completely - delayed csit ( i.e. , csi feedback delay larger than the channel coherence time ) is still useful for improving the sum - dof performance by proposing an innovative transmission strategy .",
    "the key idea of the transmission method was that a transmitter utilizes the outdated csit to align inter - user interference between the past and the currently observed signals .",
    "subsequently in @xcite , the sum - dof was investigated for a variety of interference networks ( interference and x - channel ) when completely outdated csi knowledge was available at transmitters .",
    "later , the characterization of the delayed csit effects was extended to the case where the feedback delay is less than the channel coherence time , i.e. , _ moderately - delayed csit regime _ @xcite .",
    "this regime is particularly interesting because , in practice , the feedback delay can be less than the channel coherence time depending on the user mobility .",
    "further , by leveraging the results obtained with completely - delayed csit , it is possible to obtain a complete picture on how the csi feedback delay affects the scale of the capacity . in the moderately - delayed csit regime ,",
    "a transmitter is able to exploit alternatively both current and delayed csi .",
    "this observation naturally leads to the question of whether current and delayed csit can be jointly exploited to obtain synergistic benefits . in recent work in @xcite ,",
    "the benefits of jointly exploiting current and outdated csit are substantial over separately using them in the context of vector broadcast channel .",
    "in particular , it was shown that , up to a certain delay in the feedback , sum - dof loss does not occur for the multi - input - single - output ( miso ) broadcast and interference channel @xcite .",
    "local csit is also a preferable requirement in the design of wireless systems particularly when the transmitters are not co - located , and the capacity of the backhaul links is limited .",
    "when the transmitters are distributed , each transmitter may obtain local csi between itself and its associated receivers using feedback links without further exchange of information between the transmitters .",
    "the impact of local or incomplete csit has been actively studied , especially for multiple - input - multi - output ( mimo ) interference networks @xcite . in particular , @xcite proposed iterative algorithms for interference alignment with local but instantaneous csit and demonstrated the dof benefits in mimo interference channels .",
    "the limitation , however , is that the convergence of the algorithms in @xcite is not guaranteed when csi delay is considered . in @xcite ,",
    "the feasibility of interference alignment was characterized by an iterative algorithm using incomplete but instantaneous csit in a @xmath0-user mimo interference channel . in @xcite",
    "it was shown that it is possible to strictly increase the dof with completely - delayed and local csit for the the two - user mimo and @xmath0-user miso interference channels which are more closely related to our work .",
    "nevertheless , to the best of our knowledge , characterizing the benefits of dof is still an open problem in single - antenna interference channels with local and moderately - delayed csit .    in this paper",
    "we propose a distributed interference management technique for interference networks with distributed and moderately - delayed csit .",
    "the proposed method is a structured space - time repetition transmission technique that exploits both current and outdated csit jointly to align interference signals at unintended receivers in a distributed manner .",
    "since this method is a generalization of the space - time interference alignment ( stia ) in a vector broadcast channel @xcite by imposing the distributed csit constraint , we refer to it as ",
    "_ distributed stia_. \" one distinguishing feature of the proposed method is that a transmitter only uses local csit , thereby reducing overhead incurred by csit sharing between transmitters , which differs from the conventional ia in @xcite and stia in @xcite . with the proposed method ,",
    "we show that the optimal sum - dof @xmath2 is achievable for the @xmath3 x - channel with local csit , provided that the csi feedback delay is less than @xmath4 fraction of the channel coherence time .",
    "this result implies that there is no loss in dof even if the transmitters have local and delayed csit for this class of x - channels .",
    "furthermore , for the three - user interference channel with local csit , we demonstrate that a total of @xmath5 sum - dof is achievable when the csi feedback delay is three - fifths of the channel coherence time , i.e. , @xmath6 . by leveraging the sum - dof result in @xcite with our achievability results ,",
    "we establish inner bounds of the trade - off for both channels .",
    "a major implication of this result is that local and moderately - delayed csit obtains strictly better the sum - dof over the no csit case in a certain class of interference channels . as a byproduct , leveraging the sum rate outer bound result in @xcite and the proposed method , we characterize the sum - capacity of the two - user x - channel with a set of particular channel coefficients within a constant number of bits .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we describe signal models of the x - channel , the three - user interference channel , and csi feedback model .",
    "we explain the key idea of the proposed transmission method through a motivating example in section iii . in section iv , we characterize the trade - off region between the sum - dof and csi feedback delay of the x - channel .",
    "we provide an inner bound of the trade - off region for the three - user interference in section v. in section , we provide the sum - capacity results for the two - user x - channel within a constant number of bits .",

    "in addition , @xmath11 represents a complex gaussian random variable with zero mean and unit variance .",
    "in this section , we explain two signal models for the @xmath3 x and three - user interference channel and describe the csi feedback assumptions used for this paper .     x - channel with a single antenna . , width=288 ]        we consider the x - channel with @xmath0 transmitters and two receivers , each with a single antenna .",

    "we consider ideal block fading channels where the channel realization remains constant within a block of certain length , i.e. , channel values are invariant for the channel coherence time @xmath36 .",

    "[ fig:3 ] , each receiver perfectly estimates csi from different transmitters and sends back it to the corresponding transmitters every @xmath36 time slots periodically through error - free but delayed feedback links .",
    "this periodic csi feedback model allows for the transmitters to continuously track all variations in the channel changes .",
    "it is worth to note that our block fading assumption differs from the time - correlated block fading models used in @xcite .",
    "since the channel values are assumed to be changed within the same channel coherence block in the correlated model , the transmitter is able to partially track variations in the channel changes , thereby providing imperfect current csit .",
    "we assume that the feedback delay time @xmath37 is less than the channel coherence time , @xmath38 as in @xcite .",
    "if a receiver sends back csi in time slot @xmath16 , the transmitter is able to use the csi from time slot @xmath39 .",

    "for instance , as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] , in time slot 9 , the transmitter has delayed channel knowledge for the first and second blocks , whereas it has current channel knowledge for the third block .     and csi feedback delay is @xmath40 , a transmitter is able to access current and outdated csi over one - thirds and two - thirds of the channel coherence time .",

    "@xmath41 the case of @xmath42 corresponds to the case of completely outdated csi regime as considered in @xcite . in this case , only completely outdated csi is available at the transmitter .",
    "we refer to the case where @xmath43 as the instantaneous csit point .",
    "since there is no csi feedback delay , the transmitter can use the current csi in each slot . as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] , if @xmath44 , the transmitter has instantaneous csi over one - thirds of the channel coherence time and completely outdated csi for the previous channel blocks .",
    "since the achievable data rate of the users depends on the parameters @xmath45 and signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) , we express it as a function of @xmath45 and @xmath46 . in particular , for codewords spanning @xmath16 channel uses , a rate of message @xmath13 , @xmath47 , is achievable if the probability of error for the message @xmath13 approaches zero as @xmath48 .",
    "then , the sum - dof trade - off of the x - channel with local csit is defined as a function of the normalized feedback delay , @xmath49 with the same definition of a rate for message @xmath32 , the sum - dof trade - off of the three - user interference channel with local csit is @xmath50 note that the sum - dof regions of interference networks with local and delayed csit are less or equal to those of the networks with global and delayed csit .",
    "in this section , we illustrate the core ideas behind our approach using the @xmath51 x - channel as an example . gaining insights from this section ,",
    "we extend our method into the @xmath3 x - channel and three - user interference channel in a sequel .",

    "we will show that even with @xmath52 , the sum dof of @xmath53 is achievable .",
