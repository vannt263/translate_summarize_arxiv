    "the context of this work is quantum turbulence @xcite at temperatures @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the critical temperature . in this regime ,",
    "the viscous normal fluid component and the mutual friction can be neglected , and quantum turbulence takes its purest form : a tangle of quantized vortex filaments which move in a fluid without viscosity .",
    "experiments at these very low temperatures have produced intriguing results in both @xmath0he and @xmath3he . in @xmath3he ,",
    "mcclintock and collaborators discovered that quantum turbulence , initially generated by a moving grid , quickly decays , despite the absence of viscous dissipation @xcite . in @xmath0he - b , fisher and collaborators found that quantum turbulence , initially confined in a small region , spreads in space and decays @xcite . these and other results raise challenging questions to low temperature physicists and fluid mechanicists alike .    in the case of homogeneous quantum turbulence ,",
    "the turbulence s intensity is characterized , at least in the first approximation , by the vortex line density @xmath4 ( vortex length per unit volume ) , a quantity which can be measured using techniques such as second sound and ion trapping . from the vortex line density , the typical distance between vortices , @xmath5 , can be inferred .",
    "the current understanding of quantum turbulence @xcite at very low temperatures is that , at length scales much larger than @xmath6 , the nonlinear interaction between the vortex lines results in partial alignment and polarization , such that , for @xmath7 , the superfluid supports an energy cascade from large scales to small scales , which manifests itself in the classical kolmogorov energy spectrum @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the wavenumber .",
    "numerical simulations performed using the vortex filament model @xcite and the nonlinear schroedinger equation model @xcite confirmed the existence of such spectrum .",
    "the energy cascade implies the existence of an energy sink , and the natural question arises as what should be this energy sink in the absence of viscous dissipation .",
    "the likely energy sink is acoustic : it is thought that kinetic energy decreases due to the emission of phonons by kelvin waves @xcite .",
    "kelvin waves are helical displacements of vortex filaments which rotate with angular frequency @xmath10 . to efficiently radiate sound , @xmath11 , hence @xmath9",
    ", must be very large : at the length scale of vortex separation , @xmath6 , sound radiation is negligible . to bridge this gap we have to appeal to the existence of a kelvin wave cascade process which generates smaller scales , and , in analogy to the classical kolmogorov cascade , shifts the energy to the required high wavenumbers @xmath9 .",
    "numerical simulations revealed that vortex reconnections decrease the kinetic energy directly @xcite and trigger the kelvin wave cascade @xcite    the details of this scenario still need to be properly understood .",
    "first of all , the possibility has been raised that there is an energy bottleneck between the kolmogorov cascade at @xmath7 and the kelvin wave cascade at @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "secondly , recently experiments @xcite suggest the existence of a new form of turbulence : a less structured , one - scale , `` ultraquantum '' turbulence state ( also called `` vinen '' turbulence @xcite ) , which decays as @xmath13 , in contrast to the more structured , multi - scale `` semi - classical '' quantum turbulence which decays as @xmath14 ( consistently with the @xmath15 energy spectrum ) .",
    "thirdly , the nature of the spectrum of @xmath4 is still unclear : if we naively interpret @xmath4 as a measure of vorticity , the spectrum of @xmath4 should increase with @xmath9 if @xmath16 , but experiments show otherwise @xcite .",
    "homogeneous turbulence is clearly the most important turbulence problem , but , as mentioned before , there are also experiments in which turbulence is confined in a fraction of the experimental cell , that is to say it is inhomogeneous and it can spread in space .",
    "examples of inhomogeneous or anisotropic turbulence are turbulence generated by a vibrating wire @xcite , or grid @xcite , fork @xcite , counterflow @xcite and rotating counterflow @xcite in @xmath3he , and the twisted vortex state accompanied by a moving vortex front @xcite observed in rotating @xmath0he - b .",
    "inhomogeneous turbulence may seem less generic than homogeneous turbulence , but is equally worth of attention .",
    "the reason is that at very low temperatures , in a pure superfluid , the key difference @xcite between classical and quantum fluid behaviour becomes more apparent : vortex reconnections are forbidden in a classical inviscid euler fluid , but can take place in a superfluid .",
    "the experimental study of quantum turbulence would be greatly facilitated if better visualization techniques were available .",
    "classical turbulence can be investigated using a large variety of methods : ink , smoke , kalliroscope flakes , hydrogen bubbles , hot wire anemometry , laser doppler anemometry , particle image velocimetry ( piv ) , etc . on the contrary ,",
    "there are few techniques available in liquid helium ; the most used are second sound and ion trapping in @xmath3he and nmr in @xmath0he .",
    "a drawback of these techniques is that they only measure quantities which are averaged over a large region , and we know from the study of classical turbulence that it is important to have local information about fluctuations .",
    "fortunately this problem has been recognized : work is in progress to build smaller sensors , and new measurement techniques have been developed . in @xmath3he , at temperatures above @xmath17 , a major breakthrough has been the implementation of the piv technique using micron - size spheres made of glass and polymers @xcite and solid hydrogen@xcite .    in the more difficult regime of very low temperatures @xmath0he - b , the andreev reflection technique pioneered at lancaster has been a major advance in providing experimentalists with a tool for studying turbulence .",
    "the technique is based on the fact that the dispersion curve @xmath18 of quasiparticles is tied to the reference frame of the superfluid , so , in a superfluid moving with velocity @xmath19 , the dispersion curve becomes @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the momentum @xcite .",
    "thus a side of a vortex line presents a potential barrier to oncoming quasiparticles , which can be reflected back almost exactly becoming quasiholes ; the other side of the vortex lets the quasiparticles to go through .",
    "quasiholes are reflected or transmitted in the opposite way .",
    "the vortex thus casts a symmetric shadow for quasiparticles at one side and quasiholes at the other , and , by measuring the flux of excitations , one detects vortices and infer the vortex line density .",
    "a similar problem of interaction of rotons with quantized vortices in @xmath3he and formation of shadows for @xmath22 and @xmath23 rotons was considered by samuels and donnelly  @xcite .",
    "a related problem of andreev reflection within the vortex core was analyzed in refs .",
    "@xcite ( see also the book of volovik  @xcite ) .",
    "the analysis in cited works was concerned with the bound states , whereas our concern is the propagation of thermal excitations outside vortex cores .    in a recent paper @xcite we have solved analytically the semi - classical equations of motion of ballistic quasiparticles in the presence of a single stationary vortex . when extrapolated to a disordered vortex tangle ,",
    "our result is in agreement with simpler order of magnitude estimates which have been used @xcite to infer the vortex line density in turbulence experiments .",
    "the aim of this article is to develop our understanding of the interaction of ballistic quasi - particles and vortices by considering more complex vortex configurations .",
    "for the sake of simplicity , we consider the problem of motion of quasiparticles in the @xmath24-plane in the presence of @xmath25 straight vortex lines aligned in the @xmath26 direction .",
    "the kinetic energy of a thermal excitation of momentum @xmath27 measured with respect to the fermi energy @xmath28 is @xmath29 where @xmath30 .",
    "hereafter we use numerical values taken at zero bar pressure  @xcite for the quantities which are necessary to describe the motion of the excitation : the fermi velocity @xmath31 , the fermi momentum @xmath32 , the fermi energy @xmath33 , and the effective mass @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is the mass of the @xmath0he atom .",
    "let @xmath36 be the magnitude of the superfluid energy gap .",
    "near the vortex axis , at radial distances @xmath37 smaller than the zero - temperature coherence length @xmath38 , the energy gap falls to zero and can be approximated by @xmath39 @xcite . since we are mainly concerned with what happens to the excitation for @xmath40 , we neglect the spatial dependence of the energy gap and assume the constant value , @xmath41 , where @xmath42 is boltzmann s constant and @xmath2 the critical temperature .",
    "the intersection of each vortex line with the @xmath24-plane is a vortex point .",
    "each vortex point moves with the flow field generated by all other vortex points .",
    "the @xmath43 vortex point , located at the position @xmath44 generates the following velocity field at the point @xmath45 : @xmath46 , \\label{eq : vel_vortex}\\ ] ] where @xmath47 , @xmath48 and @xmath49 are respectively the unit vectors along the @xmath50 and @xmath51 axes , and the circulation @xmath52 of the @xmath43 vortex is @xmath53 ; the @xmath54 and @xmath55 signs denote respectively a vortex ( anticlockwise rotation in the @xmath24-plane ) and an antivortex ( clockwise rotation ) . the quantity @xmath56 is the quantum of circulation in @xmath0he - b .",
    "the velocity field at the point @xmath45 created by the @xmath25 vortices is @xmath57 thus the velocity of the @xmath43 vortex point @xmath58 is @xmath59    in the presence of vortices the energy of the thermal excitation becomes @xmath60 in writing eq .",
    "( [ eq : e ] ) , the spatial variation of the order parameter is not taken into account for the sake of simplicity .",
    "we also assume that the interaction term @xmath61 varies on a spatial scale which is larger than @xmath62 , and that the excitation can be considered a compact object of momentum @xmath63 , position @xmath64 , and energy @xmath65 .",
    "this gives us the opportunity to use the method developed in ref .",
    "@xcite , and consider eq .",

    "the numerical solution of eqs .",
    "( [ eq : dimhamilton1])-([eq : dimhamilton4 ] ) which govern the trajectory of quasiparticles and vortices requires special care due to the absence of dissipation mechanisms .",
    "our preliminary investigations revealed that the most commonly used differential equation solvers , such as for example the runge - kutta fourth order method , are not satisfactory , even using a very small time step ; in the case of a single vortex , these solvers failed to conserve the total energy and the total angular momentum of the quasiparticle by large amounts ( 10% or more ) . in the case of",
    "more complex , time dependent vortex configurations , energy and momentum of quasiparticles would not be conserved , but clearly we could not trust our results if the basic conservation laws were not satisfied in the simplest case of a single vortex .    ideally , to build the conservation law into the numerical scheme , the numerical method must be symplectic and conserve phase - space volume @xcite . unfortunately the known symplectic algorithms are geared to problems ( mainly in the context of gravity ) in which the hamiltonian has the additive form @xmath88 , where @xmath27 and @xmath89 are the generalized momenta and positions , @xmath90 is the kinetic energy , and @xmath91 the potential energy , whereas in our problem the variables @xmath27 and @xmath89 appear in nonlinear combinations .",
    "the second difficulty is the stiffness of our equations of motion , as very rapid time - scales appear at the andreev turning points .",
    "after some experimenting , we have found that we can solve the governing equations with satisfactory accuracy using the matlab code _",
    "ode15s _ , which is a quasi - constant step size implementation of the numerical differentiation formulas ( ndf ) particularly efficient for solving stiff problems ( for detailed description of the _ ode15s _ matlab solver and corresponding software see ref .",
    "@xcite ) . when solving eqs .",
    "( [ eq : dimhamilton1])-([eq : dimhamilton4 ] ) , error tolerances were lowered until the particle trajectory had sufficiently converged , in particular at reflections .    to test our numerical method",
    "we determine the trajectories of excitations in the presence of a single vortex located at the origin , and compare the results with previous analytical results @xcite .",
    "the velocity field of the vortex is simply @xmath92 since the vortex does not move , this velocity field is time - independent , and the governing equations ( [ eq : dimhamilton1])-([eq : dimhamilton4 ] ) have two integrals of motion : the first is the energy , defined by the hamiltonian , eq .",
    "( [ eq : dimhamilt ] ) ; the second is the @xmath26-component of the angular momentum , which is @xmath93    the initial conditions at @xmath94 for our calculations are the following .",

    "[ fig:4 ] ( left ) for @xmath113 .",
    "[ fig:4 ] ( right ) shows that @xmath103 changes sign , thus confirming that , upon reflection , the quasiparticle becomes a quasihole . in this calculation ,",
    "the numerical errors in conserving energy and angular momentum are @xmath114 and @xmath115 respectively .",
    "[ fig:5 ] shows another andreev reflection , this time for @xmath116 .    in our previous paper",
    "@xcite we determined the distance from the vortex at which , if @xmath111 , the incident quasiparticle is andreev reflected ; the dashed - dotted ( red ) curve in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] marks this location .",
    "it is apparent that there is a maximum value of @xmath112 past which a quasiparticle with energy @xmath117 is not andreev reflected ; this value ( in our dimensionless units ) is approximately equal to @xmath118 where we used @xmath119 for @xmath120 .",
    "we call @xmath121 the ( dimensionless ) _ andreev shadow _ of a single vortex to quasiparticles of that particular ( dimensionless ) momentum @xmath122 .    * case 3 : * finally , if @xmath123 , the quasiparticle s trajectory is deflected by the vortex but remains a quasiparticle .",
    "the velocity field of two vortices is time - dependent , thus the hamiltonian of the thermal excitation has no integrals of motion . unlike the previous case of a single vortex , @xmath124 and @xmath125 are not conserved .",
    "the only quantity in the problem which is constant is the the distance between the vortices .",
    "there are two cases to consider : two vortices of the same circulation ( vortex - vortex pair ) , and two vortices of the opposite circulations ( vortex - antivortex pair ) .",
    "this section is concerned with the former .",
    "two vortices of the same circulation at distance @xmath126 from each other rotate around a point halfway between them with velocity @xmath127 in dimensionless variables we have @xmath128    far from the vortices , the velocity of the quasiparticle can be estimated from eqs .",
    "( [ eq : dimhamilton1 ] ) and ( [ eq : dimhamilton2 ] ) : @xmath129    to get a more clear picture of the problem , it is useful to make the following simple estimates .",
    "away from the vortices , the velocity of the quasiparticle is approximately @xmath130 . if @xmath131 , the velocity of the vortices is approximately @xmath132 . for a typical timescale of approximately @xmath133 to @xmath134 time units , the vortices travel approximately the distance @xmath135 to @xmath136 , which means that they rotate about the center of rotation by an angle @xmath137 to @xmath138 .",
    "if @xmath139 is larger than @xmath140 the vortices move slower and @xmath141 is even smaller .",
    "we conclude that , in the first approximation , the vortex system is static to quasiparticles with the momentum @xmath142 . however , if @xmath143 , in the corresponding time scale the vortices move by a more substantial angle , @xmath144 to @xmath145 .",
    "if @xmath131 , a significant displacement can be observed for quasiparticles with @xmath146 and the vortex configuration can not be considered static .",
    "we proceed with our calculations and consider two vortices of the same circulation at distance @xmath147 from each other , initially located at positions @xmath148 and @xmath149 .",
    "we integrate the equations of motion of quasiparticles with @xmath142 , keeping @xmath99 fixed and varying @xmath100 . in this configuration ,",
    "the relative angle @xmath150 between the direction of the incoming quasiparticle ( the @xmath50 axis ) and the line which joins the two vortices ( the @xmath51 axis ) is @xmath151 .",
    "[ fig:6 ] illustrates the trajectories of the quasiparticle for @xmath152 as well as the path of the vortices ; fig .",
    "[ fig:7 ] ( left ) shows that the incident quasiparticle is reflected as a quasihole ; since the @xmath153 term in the hamiltonian is time - dependent , the energy is not constant during the evolution , as confirmed in fig .",
    "[ fig:7 ] ( right ) .",
    "we find that the andreev shadow of the first vortex of the pair is @xmath154 , slightly more than @xmath155 ( the andreev shadow of an isolated stationary vortex ) , and that the shadow of the second vortex of the pair is @xmath156 , which is slightly less than @xmath155 .",
    "note that in this case @xmath157 .    if the relative angle @xmath150 between the direction of the incoming quasiparticle and the direction between the vortices is reduced from @xmath151 to @xmath158 , the andreev shadow of the first vortex decreases from @xmath154 to @xmath159 , but the andreev shadow of the second vortex increases from @xmath156 to @xmath160 , so that the total shadow @xmath161 of the vortex configuration remains approximately equal to twice the shadow @xmath155 of a single isolated vortex .",
    "for example , if the vortices are located at @xmath162 and @xmath163 , the angle is @xmath158 , @xmath159 , @xmath160 , and @xmath164 .",
    "if @xmath150 is further reduced from @xmath158 to @xmath165 , the total shadow of both vortices increases and reaches its maximum size : @xmath166 , @xmath167 , and @xmath168 . if @xmath169 the two shadows merge , and the two vortices screen each other .",
    "if @xmath170 then @xmath171 only .    qualitatively , the same behaviour is observed if the distance between the vortices is even smaller , e.g. @xmath172 .",
    "if the angle between the direction of motion of the excitation and the direction of the line through the vortices is @xmath151 , the shadow of the first vortex at @xmath173 is only @xmath174 ( significantly smaller than @xmath155 ) and the shadow of the second vortex at @xmath175 is @xmath176 ( significantly larger than @xmath155 ) , and the total shadow is @xmath177 . if @xmath150 is reduced the two shadows merge when @xmath178 ; at this angle @xmath179 . at @xmath158 ,",
    "the total shadow is @xmath180 , and at @xmath170 @xmath181 .    what happens if @xmath139 is further reduced ?",
    "consider for simplicity the angle @xmath151 : for large @xmath139 the two vortices have independent shadows ( one reduced in size , the other increased in size ) . by decreasing the distance between the vortices",
    "the shadows approach each other ; for distances @xmath182 they merge and the vortex configuration has a single shadow independent of @xmath150 , as if it were a single vortex of strength approximately equal to @xmath183 .",
    "a vortex and an antivortex , set at distance @xmath139 from each other , move through the fluid with ( dimensionless ) translational velocity @xmath184 the same estimates which we have made at the beginning of the previous section apply .",
    "as before , we consider quasiparticles with initial momentum @xmath142 and initial position @xmath185 with @xmath99 fixed and varying @xmath100 .",
    "firstly we consider the case in which the vortex - antivortex pair and the quasiparticle move in the same direction . let the positive ( anticlockwise ) vortex be located at @xmath186 and the negative ( clockwise ) vortex be at @xmath187 , with @xmath147 the separation between the vortices .",

[ fig:9 ] . in both cases , during the timescale of the calculation , the vortex pair moves by only @xmath191 .",
    "we conclude that the relative motion of vortices and excitations has a strong effect on the shadow .",
    "now we examine the dependence of the andreev reflection on @xmath139 .",

    "secondly , we consider the case in which the quasiparticle and the vortex pair move in opposite directions . we have said that if @xmath147 the total shadow is only @xmath190 .",
    "if @xmath139 decreases , @xmath161 decreases too : at @xmath172 and @xmath131 we have @xmath196 and @xmath197 respectively .",
    "we conclude that , independently of @xmath139 , the total shadow of a vortex pair travelling in the opposite direction of the quasiparticle is about half that of a vortex pair travelling in the same direction .",
    "the shadow of the vortex - antivortex pair also depends on the angle @xmath198 between the direction of propagation of the quasiparticle and the direction of motion of the vortex - antivortex pair .",
    "consider a vortex - antivortex pair of separation @xmath172 .",
    "we have already seen that if @xmath199 ( vortex pair moving in the same direction as the quasiparticle ) , then @xmath200 .",
    "if the positive vortex is at @xmath201 and the negative vortex is at @xmath202 , the angle is @xmath203 and the shadow increases to @xmath204 . if the positive vortex is at @xmath205 and the negative vortex at @xmath206 , the angle is @xmath207 and the shadow increases further to @xmath208 .",
    "finally , as said before , if the positive vortex is at @xmath209 and the negative vortex is at @xmath210 ( the vortex pair moving in the direction opposite to that of the quasiparticle ) , then @xmath211 and @xmath212 .",
    "we assume again that the quasiparticle has initial momentum @xmath213 and initial position @xmath185 with @xmath99 ; we vary @xmath100 and determine the total shadow of some simple vortex configurations .    in the first numerical experiment we initially place five vortex points in the square @xmath214 , @xmath215 .",
    "more precisely , the initial positions of the vortices are @xmath216 , @xmath217 , @xmath218 , @xmath219 and @xmath220 .",
    "if the vortices have the same ( positive ) polarity , they rotate around each other , forming the 2-dimensional equivalent of a vortex bundle of total circulation @xmath221 ; we find ( see fig .",
    "[ fig:10 ] ) that the total shadow of the vortex configuration is @xmath222 , which is less than five times the shadow of five individual vortices .",
    "if we change the sign of some of the vortices , the total shadow which is cast changes dramatically .",
    "for example , let the vortices at @xmath217 , @xmath223 and @xmath218 be positive , and the vortices at @xmath216 and @xmath224 be negative .",
    "the net circulation is now @xmath225 and the total shadow is @xmath226 ( see fig .  [ fig:11 ] ) , which is much less than the previous value , but still more than the shadow of a single isolated vortex . a similar value of the total shadow , @xmath227 , is obtained if the positive vortices are at @xmath217 , @xmath223 , @xmath224 and the negative vortices are at @xmath216 , @xmath218 , which corresponds to the same total circulation @xmath225 as before , see fig .  [ fig:12 ] .    in the second numerical experiment we increase the vortex density and place ten vortices ( twice as many as before ) in the same square @xmath214 , @xmath215 .",
    "we consider three cases : ( i ) ten vortices of the same polarity ( total circulation @xmath228 , see fig .",
    "[ fig:13 ] ) , which yields the total shadow @xmath229 ( about twice the shadow of a bundle of five vortices ) ; ( ii ) five vortices and five antivortices ( total circulation is zero , see fig .",
    "[ fig:14 ] ) , which yields @xmath230 ; ( iii ) five vortex - antivortex pairs ( total circulation zero , see fig .",
    "[ fig:15 ] ) , which yields @xmath231 .",
    "we have found that it is possible that , upon impinging on complex vortex configurations , quasiparticles experience multiple reflections , which can be classical , andreev , or both .",
    "an example of multiple andreev reflection is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:16 ] .",
    "in conclusion , the above numerical experiments with simple vortex configurations show that partial screening takes place .",
    "the total andreev shadow of a vortex system is not necessarily the sum of the shadows of individual vortices , and depends not only on the distance but also on the relative orientation between quasiparticles and vortex motion .",
    "this does not mean that the interpretation given to recent experiments is incorrect .",
    "it is possible that , for a large , random vortex system , the partial screening effects which we have found average out . if this is the case , screening effects can be taken into account by introducing a prefactor probably of order one for the total shadow , hence for the vortex line density which is inferred .",
    "numerical investigations in 3-dimensions with realistic vortex line density are needed .",
    "how random are vortex configurations of current experiments ?",
    "probably only the recently discovered @xcite ultraquantum regime is truly random .",
    "homogeneous isotropic turbulence contains coherent vortex structures @xcite and is organized in scales with different energy per scale . on the other hand ,",
    "provided we are interested only in large scale properties averaged over a large region , such as the total vortex length , the partial screening effects can be accounted as said above .",
    "the situation is very different when we move to rotating turbulence @xcite and inhomogeneous turbulence , particularly if there are turbulent fronts . in these cases",

    "<S> the vortex line density of turbulent superfluid @xmath0he - b at very low temperature is deduced by detecting the shadow of ballistic quasiparticles which are andreev reflected by quantized vortices . until now the measured total shadow has been interpreted as the sum of shadows arising from interactions of a single quasiparticle with a single vortex . by integrating numerically the quasi - classical hamiltonian equations of motion of ballistic quasiparticles in the presence of nontrivial but relatively simple vortex systems ( such as vortex - vortex and vortex - antivortex pairs and small clusters of vortices ) </S>",
    "<S> we show that partial screening can take place , and the total shadow is not necessarily the sum of the shadows . </S>",
    "<S> we have also found that it is possible that , upon impinging on complex vortex configurations , quasiparticles experience multiple reflections , which can be classical , andreev , or both . </S>"
