    "the standard model of elementary particles @xcite-@xcite has received its most important experimental confirmation with the discovery of the higgs boson by the atlas @xcite and cms @xcite experiments .",
    "one of the most important theoretical issue associated with the standard model higgs boson is that of naturalness which stems from the existence of significant quadratic corrections to the higgs boson mass @xcite .",
    "the standard model higgs boson properties and higher loop corrections to the mass have been discussed in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the bounds on the mass of the higgs boson from the electroweak precision data were derived in @xcite . in order to predict the mass of the higgs boson",
    "one needs additional assumptions or hypothesis as the mass of the higgs boson can not be extracted only from the standard model parameters . in @xcite we determined the approximate mass of the higgs boson from properties of the background gauge field .",
    "the correct mass for the higgs boson was also obtained in @xcite from the three loop effective potential and in @xcite from 5d gauge unification .    in this work",
    "we rely on the properties of the standard model lagrangian and partition function before and after spontaneous symmetry breaking to make the assumption that the gauge invariant operators are conserved at the transition between the symmetric and spontaneously broken phases . based on this",
    "we calculate at one loop quantum correlators to which we add the most important two loop contributions to determine a mass of the higgs boson very close to the central experimental value .",
    "this is done by relating the quadratic corrections to the gauge invariant kinetic term for the higgs doublet for the symmetric and spontaneously broken lagrangians .    in section",
    "ii we review the standard model lagrangian and present in detail the terms that are most relevant for the present work . in section iii",
    "we compute the vacuum expectation values of the gauge invariant kinetic terms for the higgs boson before and after spontaneous symmetry breaking .",
    "section iv is dedicated to the results and their signification .",
    "we consider the electroweak sector of the standard model given by the lagrangian @xcite :    @xmath1    where , @xmath2 with , @xmath3 furthermore , @xmath4 here we used a generic notations for all fermion terms and for example : @xmath5 next , @xmath6 here @xmath7 is the standard model higgs doublet , @xmath8 with , @xmath9    the potential in eq .",

    "the mass of the higgs boson will become @xmath15 whereas the goldstone bosons will remain massless .",
    "we are mainly interested in the gauge kinetic term for the higgs boson . for future use",
    "we give below the detailed expression for this term as a function of the mass eigenstates of the gauge fields after spontaneous symmetry breaking : @xmath16 + \\nonumber\\\\ & & \\partial_{\\mu}\\phi^{+}[\\frac{i}{2}(bz^{\\mu}+ca^{\\mu})\\phi^-+\\frac{i}{\\sqrt{2}}gw^{\\mu-}\\phi_0g]+ \\nonumber\\\\ & & \\partial^{\\mu}\\phi_0^*[-\\frac{i}{\\sqrt{2}}gw_{\\mu}^-\\phi^+-\\frac{i}{2}az_{\\mu}\\phi_0]+ \\nonumber\\\\ & & \\partial_{\\mu}\\phi_0[\\frac{i}{\\sqrt{2}}gw^{\\mu+}\\phi^-+\\frac{i}{2}az^{\\mu}\\phi_0^*]+ \\nonumber\\\\ & & [ \\frac{1}{2}(bz^{\\mu}+ca^{\\mu})\\phi^-+\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}gw^{\\mu-}\\phi_0][\\frac{1}{2}(bz_{\\mu}+ca_{\\mu})\\phi^++\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}gw_{\\mu}^+\\phi_0]+ \\nonumber\\\\ & & [ \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}w^{\\mu-}\\phi^++\\frac{a}{2}z^{\\mu}\\phi_0][\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}w_{\\mu}^+\\phi^-+\\frac{a}{2}z_{\\mu}\\phi_0 ] .",

    "a gauge invariant lagrangian needs fixing and one can show that the corresponding partition function remains unchanged through this procedure up to an irrelevant proportionality factor . in this work",
    "we shall make the assumption that the vacuum correlators of the gauge invariant operators are exactly the same before and after spontaneous symmetry breaking .",
    "in other words the gauge invariant quantum correlator calculated for the symmetric partition function that contains tachyonic states is equal to the corresponding quantity calculated for the partition function with spontaneously broken symmetry .",
    "this assumption is justified by the fact that in the actual partition function the transition from one state to another can be simply expressed in a change of variable in the higgs sector @xmath18 . in order for this equivalence of the quantum correlators to be valid",
    "it is necessary to keep , besides this change of variable , the partition function unchanged before and after spontaneous symmetry breaking .",
    "this implies that the gauge fixing of the lagrangian must be done similarly and consistent in both cases without the introduction of additional terms in the lagrangian .",
    "the most amenable gauge is the landau gauge @xmath19 which will be used before and after spontaneous symmetry breaking with the amend that the gauge fixing function must be the same in both situations .",
    "this a slight depart from the @xmath20 gauges for theories with spontaneous symmetry breaking where for example the gauge function for a generic case is if the type @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the goldstone boson associated to the gauge field @xmath23 .",
    "here we shall take simply @xmath24 for both cases .",
    "in the standard model lagrangian there are quite a few of gauge invariant operators but we are interested in those that contain the higgs doublet and no constant terms .",
    "the most relevant among these is the gauge kinetic term for the higgs doublet .",
    "we shall equate the quadratic corrections at one loop before and after spontaneous symmetry breaking . before spontaneous symmetry breaking",
    "this term reads : @xmath25 whereas after spontaneous symmetry breaking : @xmath26    next we compute the quadratic corrections corresponding to eq .",

    "we use , @xmath30 , \\label{int43789}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] to find by equating the quadratic divergences before and after spontaneous symmetry breaking : @xmath31 then by assuming the bare masses @xmath32 we determine : @xmath33 eq .",
    "( [ rqwew ] ) leads , by introducing the physical masses for the gauge boson to an estimate @xmath34 gev which is very large compared to the known physical value of the higgs boson .",
    "however this result is a gross approximation for several reasons .",
    "first the quadratic term that relates the goldstone boson with the gauge boson contributes significantly at one loop .",
    "second the two loop contributions especially those that involve the top quark and the tadpole diagrams give important quadratic corrections at two loop which alter substantially the one loop result . next one should consider also the one loop corrections to the bare mass in order to extract a suitable mass for the higgs boson since these corrections contains quadratic divergences . with one amend that we will state later we shall consider all of the above arguments in our subsequent calculations .",
    "we start by considering the quadratic corrections that come from the gauge boson goldstone boson term .",
    "we illustrate this only for the @xmath35 boson : @xmath36 \\label{qrew67}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] a similar contribution is obtained for the @xmath37 bosons for which we shall write down only the result : @xmath38 . \\label{gaugeb554664}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] . if we add the contribution in eqs .",

    "( [ rel775645 ] ) we obtain : @xmath39 which does not make sense as it is and clearly shows the need for the two loop corrections",
    ".    in general a cut - off regularization procedure may be just for one loop corrections but not quite so for higher loops because the translation and gauge invariance are lost .",
    "however because we are interested in quadratic corrections we shall proceed further and consider only those feynman diagrams that are well behaved under a cut - off procedure and neglect those more intricate that require the introduction of the feynman parameters .",
    "namely the diagrams that we will take into account are those diagrams that may be written as product of two loops or vacuum diagrams that contain two connected bubbles , be they of the tadpole type . since the diagrams we consider contain product of two traces and those that we ignore contain one trace and mostly goldstone bosons we estimate that these latter are strongly suppressed and at most may contribute to the final result by one percent .",
