    "the distribution of earthquakes in nature follows non - trivial patterns , some of which are captured by well known empirical laws .",
    "the gutenberg - richter ( gr ) law @xcite states that the number of earthquakes as a function of magnitude @xmath0 scales as @xmath1 .",
    "the exponent @xmath2 is very nearly 1 .",
    "the omori law refers to temporal correlations between earthquakes , in particular to aftershocks , namely the temporal clustering of earthquakes following a large one , usually called the main shock .",
    "the omori law of aftershocks@xcite states that the number of aftershocks per unit of time decays as @xmath3 with the time @xmath4 from the main shock .",
    "the exponent @xmath5 is typically very close to 1 , and @xmath6 is a time constant of the order between minutes and hours .",
    "aftershocks occur mainly in the spatial region where the rupture of the main shock took place .",
    "the gr law has been shown to be compatible with a state of ( at least partial ) critical organization of the system@xcite that is understandable in terms of spring - block models , when an appropriate velocity weakening friction law ( i.e. , a friction force decreasing with the relative velocity of the sliding elements ) is assumed to hold .",
    "this kind of modeling was pioneered by burridge and knopoff@xcite ( bk ) , and was extended along different directions afterwards , particularly in the works on self - organized - criticality of the eighties @xcite .",
    "the bk model reproduces the global statistical behavior implied by the gr law , but it fails to account for the existence of spatial and temporal correlations observed in actual seismicity . on searching for the origin of the aftershock phenomenon , dieterich@xcite followed by others @xcite have shown that an analysis based on rate - and - state equations@xcite is able to justify the appearance of aftershocks following the omori decay . on this perspective , it is puzzling that the use of a bk model with a rate - and - state friction law does not produce realistic aftershocks@xcite .",
    "although aftershocks usually are responsible for less than about 5 @xmath7 of the total released seismic moment , the finding that the gr law is also obeyed within individual aftershock sequences strongly suggests that consistent and compatible explanations for gr and omori laws should exist .",
    "we may thus say that at present , there is not a single , unified picture of the physics behind some of the most robust features of seismicity , namely gr and omori laws .",
    "in addition , the use of rate - and - state equations , although widely supported by experimental results , remains essentially a crude phenomenological approach .",
    "we show here that when a spring - block model without any a priori velocity dependent frictional force is complemented with an appropriate relaxational term as discussed below , it produces : 1 ) earthquake patterns and in particular aftershock sequences quantitatively comparable with real ones , 2 ) a velocity weakening friction law , and in general , agreement with the predictions of the rate - and - state equations , and 3 ) a power law decay of number of earthquakes with magnitude compatible with the gr law , with an exponent @xmath2 that compares well with actual values .",
    "our modeling is based on the original bk model@xcite , with the important difference that the friction law between the blocks and the substrate is not a priori assumed to have any particular form such as the velocity - weakening form commonly used .",
    "a velocity dependent friction law emerges naturally at large scales from the characteristic collective dynamics of elastic manifolds in random media@xcite . in this context ,",
    "an elastic interface ( which corresponds to the blocks joined by springs in the bk model - we already describe the two dimensional case , more appropriate to real faults ) is driven through a disordered potential energy landscape ( the ` substrate ' ) that models the random nature of asperities .",
    "the velocity - dependent frictional force between the blocks and the substrate of the bk model is therefore replaced by a disordered potential energy landscape that is chosen randomly and uncorrelated for each point block of the discretized interface . in concrete",
    ", our model is described by the overdamped equation @xmath8 where @xmath9 is a continuous variable representing the displacement of the block labeled by the indices @xmath10 in a two dimensional grid , @xmath11 is the driving variable ( usually @xmath12 , we will refer also to @xmath13 and to @xmath14 as the strain and local stress in the system , respectively ) , @xmath15 is the discrete laplacian operator , and @xmath16 is the pinning force at each block , which is assumed to be short - range correlated along the direction of the block displacements . for numerical convenience",
    "this spatially random force is chosen in the following way : a random position @xmath17 is selected for each @xmath18 , then the force is @xmath19 .",
    "when , upon the dynamical evolution , @xmath16 reaches some threshold value @xmath20 ( that is chosen randomly distributed between @xmath21 and @xmath22 ) , the corresponding @xmath17 is given the value @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is randomly chosen between @xmath25 and 1 . also , a new threshold is assigned to site @xmath18 .",

    "so far , in the present form , the model does not give any clue on the reason for earthquake clustering , or the origin of a velocity weakening friction law .",
    "however , the inclusion of a simple additional ingredient changes this scenario drastically .",
    "this ingredient turns out to be what we have called _ structural relaxation _ @xcite .",
    "the primary physical justification of its inclusion is the following .",
    "it is known that in solid friction the friction coefficient at rest increases with the time the surfaces have been in contact @xcite .",
    "this is telling us about the existence of a temporal dependent mechanism that makes the sliding surfaces get more attached or pinned to each other when they remain in contact for a longer period of time . in the present model , a rather simple way to include such an effect is to consider , in addition to the random pinning force that the substrate performs on the sliding surface , the reaction that the surface performs onto the substrate .",
    "if we give the substrate the possibility to react to this force , the system will gain pinning energy by making the substrate more correlated , so to pin better the correlated interface structure .",
    "this is in general a slow process , and the longer the surface remains in contact with the substrate , the stronger the join .",
    "this process of attachment is however stopped and restarted when a slip event occurs , since the values of the disordered potential refreshen , becoming uncorrelated again .",
    "we will show in the following that this simple mechanism is enough to explain , in particular , the appearance of a robust sequence of aftershocks , and the occurrence of a velocity weakening friction law .",
    "our structural relaxation mechanism is what in other contexts is called the ageing of the material .     around the main event",

    "the figure depicts a portion of size 350x350 of a system of 512x512 . ]",
    "the modification to the model is as follows .",
    "we allow the values of @xmath17 to relax in time according to @xmath50 this conserved dynamics for the shift of the disorder potential at different block points is a generic way to introduce the back effect of the surface on the substrate ( the actualization of the @xmath30 s when a slip event occurs is made as before ) .",
    "the coefficient @xmath51 is a measure of the intensity or rate of relaxation , and can thus be related to experimental relaxation times .",
    "equation ( [ eq2 ] ) generates a tendency for the local forces @xmath16 to become uniform across the system , generating a stronger contact between surface and substrate .",
    "this relaxational effect competes with the driving , which forces the movement of the surface onto the substrate at a fixed average velocity @xmath52 .",
    "the relevant parameter that measures the competition between the two effects is the ratio @xmath53 .",
    "the mechanism by which earthquake clustering occurs can be summarized as follows ( see fig .",
    "if a particular region of the sample has not experienced a large event in a rather long period of time , the structural relaxation has made this region stronger ( fig .",
    "[ f0](b ) ) .",
    "when an event occurs ( driven by the overall displacement between surface and substrate ) the contacts refreshen and large variations in the local forces remain .",
    "relaxation continues to act , trying to uniformize the local forces . in this process , particular points that were originally stable immediately after the main shock ,",
    "may destabilize and generate a new event ( fig .",
    "[ f0](c ) ) .",
    "note that in this description it is obvious that aftershocks will occur at , or near , the rupture region of the main shock .",
    "it is also worth noting here that aftershocks are triggered by the inner dynamics of the system , and that most aftershocks occur also if we stop the driving of the system after the main shock .",

    "the second set of results that we present corresponds to the stress - strain relation of the model for different driving protocols .",
    "first of all we recall that the model without relaxation shows a stress @xmath65 that is independent of the strain rate , since the internal time scale of the model is very rapid compared to the driving . in eq .",
    "( [ lambda ] ) this means that @xmath66 .",
    "the inclusion of relaxation introduces a new time scale ( set by the parameter @xmath51 in eq .",
    "( [ eq2 ] ) ) and now the average stress in the system depends on the ratio @xmath53 .",
    "when @xmath53 is small , the effect of relaxation is negligible , and the stress will be similar to that in the absence of relaxation",
    ". however , if @xmath53 is high enough , relaxation will act by effectively correlating the pinning potential in a larger spatial region .",
    "the size of this region increases with @xmath53",
    ". a spatially more correlated pinning potential produces , in turn , a larger average stress in the system .",
    "we conclude that the larger is @xmath53 the larger is the average stress . in other words ,",
    "the model will display velocity weakening . in fig .",
    "[ ss]a we show a plot of the stress in the system as a function of strain rate where this weakening is clearly observed . for large strain rates",
    "the stress converges to the value corresponding to no relaxation , whereas the behavior for very small strain shows a saturation at a larger value .",
    "the transition between these two values is logarithmic and spans about a factor of 100 of strain rate .",
    "note that the values reported above as necessary to observe aftershocks ( @xmath67 ) correspond to the limit of small velocity in this plot .",
    "a closer examination at the instantaneous stress - strain relation reveals that the lower the strain rate , the more pronounced the fluctuations in the instantaneous stress .",
    "additional information on the frictional behavior is obtained by studying the system response to abrupt changes of the strain rate .",

    "[ ss]b in particular , the stress on a system in which driving is stopped during some time interval ( the hold time ) and then is re - initiated .",
    "first of all , a logarithmic decrease of stress during the hold time is observed .",
    "this occurs because the system continues to relax during the hold time and some instability events continue to occur for some time .",
    "this is related to our previous statement that aftershocks also occur if driving is stopped after a main shock . despite the stress reduction during the hold time",
    ", a stress peak occurs after re - initiation of sliding .",
    "the height of this peak increases logarithmically with the hold time .",
    "this peak is a consequence of the more stable configuration that the system reached due to relaxation during the hold time .",
    "the phenomenon is similar to the one observed in glass forming materials , where it has been explained using the same ideas @xcite .",
    "these results are in remarkable agreement with those obtained in laboratory measurements @xcite .",

    "case is included again for reference .",
    "the thin continuous line shows the case @xmath69 , followed rather accurately by actual seismic events .",
    "the results in our model in the presence of relaxation show a behavior compatible with the actual seismicity , with a cut - off at large event size that increases upon decreasing the spring constant @xmath46 .",
    "however , finite size effects seem to be appreciably for the system sizes used . the larger decaying rate observed for @xmath70",
    "is an spurious effect associated with events comparable in size with our numerical mesh . ]",
    "the inclusion of relaxation produces also a change in the decaying exponent @xmath2 of the gr law . in fig .",
    "[ s6 ] we see that a power law decaying is maintained in the presence of relaxation , with a @xmath2 value substantially larger than that corresponding to no relaxation .",
    "once a minimum value of relaxation has been over passed ( @xmath71 ) , the @xmath2 decaying exponent is quite insensitive to the precise value of relaxation .",
    "there seems to be an excess of events of large magnitude , before the cut off is reached .",
    "the cut off and the peak corresponding to large events are mainly dependent on the value @xmath46 of the spring driving the system .",
    "the smaller this value , the larger is the cut - off .",
    "it is not clear however if this tendency can be extrapolated to very small values of @xmath46 .",
    "unfortunately , to simulate decreasing values of this spring constant requires an increase in system size , and we reach rapidly very time consuming runs .",
    "the obtained decaying exponent in the presence of relaxation is compatible with the value @xmath72 observed in actual seismicity .",
    "the fact that the @xmath2 exponent takes a value close to 1 in the presence of relaxation , quite independent of the precise value of the relaxation parameter and other details of the model seems to indicate that relaxation takes the system out of its original universality class with @xmath44 , to a new one with @xmath73 .",
    "coincidence of this value with actual ones is another indication that we are capturing essential features of the seismic process with the inclusion of the relaxation mechanism .",
    "summarizing , in the present paper we have presented a modeling that combines a spring - block type system in the spirit of the bk model but without a priori velocity weakening friction , with a rather generic implementation of ageing effects within the sliding materials . the motivation for this approach was to introduce , in a spring - block model , a mechanism that generates ( and not merely assumes ) non trivial frictional effects , which can produce realistic temporal and spatial clustering of earthquakes .",
    "our model allows to obtain a time sequence of events that globally follow the gr law with a @xmath45 exponent , and at the same time highly non - trivial spatial and temporal correlations compatible , in particular , with the omori law .",
