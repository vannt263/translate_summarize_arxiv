    "it is important to evaluate what `` yesterday s tomorrow '' has unveiled in the area of star formation and identify the possible `` today s tomorrow '' breakthroughs .",

    "these questions require systematic studies of a large number of sources , possibly at high angular resolution , as well as observations of specific sources using multi - wavelength observations , in order to converge and refine our hypotheses .",

    "* marseille et al .",
    "( 2010 ) ) compared the physical conditions by observing several molecular tracers in both weak and bright mid - ir emitting massive dense cores .",
    "the methanol class  i maser at 84.5  ghz was found to be strongly anti - correlated with the 12  @xmath4 m source brightness , leading to an interpretation that these represent more embedded mid - ir sources with a spherically symmetric distribution of the envelope material .",

    "( 2011b ) ) analysed some of these ring - like maser sources using thermal emission at arcsec scale and found that mostly the distribution of the methanol gas peaks at the maser position with the larger scale gas showing a modest outflow velocity .",
    "they argued that the methanol gas has a single origin in these sources , possibly associated with an accretion shock .",
    "alma resolution is necessary for probing the regions of interest at size scales of 1000  au .    for all of these studies it is important to remember that the vlbi techniques resolves out some of the emission .",
    "* pandian et al . ( 2011 ) ) noted that more complex morphologies and often larger structures become apparent when using shorter baseline interferometers ( evla , merlin ) compared to vlbi , analyzing a study of 72 sources from the arecibo methanol masers galactic survey .",

    "there has also been significant progress on maser proper motion studies at mas scale .",
    "these result from multi - epoch observations that often have two simultaneous objectives : proper motions of the maser features in order to derive the kinematics of the gas in the direct environment of the ysos and accurate direct distances by means of detecting the parallax .",
