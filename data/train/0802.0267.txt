    "in recent years , higher dimensional black holes have been in the focus of high energy physics research .",
    "they are essential for our understanding of key moments of string theory , quantum gravity and brane - world scenarios .",
    "the most important classical property of black holes is evidently stability : unstable black holes simply can not exist in our world .",
    "in addition , when considering higher dimensional black holes in the context of anti - de sitter / conformal field theory ( ads / cft ) correspondence , that is as a dual backgrounds rather than as real black holes , instability means a phase transition in the dual theory @xcite being essential for understanding the field theory at finite temperature and high coupling .",
    "an opportunity of creating of mini black holes at particle collisions in large hadron collider , according to tev gravity extra dimensional scenarios , also gave a strong impetus to extensive studies of different properties of higher dimensional black holes , including quasinormal modes @xcite and hawking radiation @xcite .",
    "the study of evolution of gravitational perturbations of the d - dimensional black holes in pure einstein theory started from the work of ishibashi and kodama @xcite who managed to reduce the cumbersome perturbation equations to the usual schrodinger - like form . yet",
    "the resulting effective potential of the wave equation is not always positive definite , so that stability is not taken for granted . in a few cases the technique of the so - called s - deformations , i.e. of deformations of the wave equation which does not touch stability properties , helped to transform a potential to a positive definite form , thereby proving the stability . in a general case , an extensive numerical investigation of evolution of gravitational perturbations allowed to prove stability for higher dimensional reissner - nordstrm - de sitter black holes with arbitrary charge and @xmath4-term @xcite .    at the same time , the quantum gravity corrections to classical general relativity implies the existence of the so - called gauss - bonnet term in the dominant order correction , that is , the term in the lagrangian squared in curvature .",
    "this term vanishes when @xmath5 .",
    "therefore , the black holes in the einstein - gauss - bonnet theory @xcite have attracted considerable interest recent years @xcite . in particular , scalar field",
    "quasinormal modes of asymptotically flat gauss - bonnet black holes @xcite and of asymptotically ds / ads gauss - bonnet black holes were considered in @xcite .",
    "the scalar quasinormal modes of gauss - bonnet black holes in the regime of high damping were considered in @xcite . the scalar field , propagating in the background of a black hole ,",
    "although gives the qualitative picture of evolution of perturbations , is not responsible for stability , so that perturbations of einstein - gauss - bonnet equations must be considered instead @xcite , @xcite .",
    "thus , dotti and gleiser reduced the einstein - gauss - bonnet perturbed equations to a wave like form with some effective potentials .",
    "they found an instability for the two particular cases : scalar type of gravitational perturbations for @xmath6 , and tensor type of gravitational perturbations for @xmath7 , leaving the analysis of stability of general @xmath3 open .",
    "the problem was that analytical treatment of stability is difficult in many cases : even if we have a wave like equation with a potential ( extremely cumbersome in the gauss - bonnet case ) , negative gaps in potentials can not be easily removed by the s - deformations , because one needs to know an ansatz that transforms the potential to a positive definite one .",
    "the aim of our work is to perform a complete numerical analysis of the evolution of gravitational perturbations for d - dimensional gauss - bonnet black holes with @xmath8 , what is motivated by string theory and quantum gravity , and to determine the stability and instability regions for these black holes .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : sec .",
    "ii introduces the metric and wave like equations for gauss - bonnet ( gb ) black holes . sec .",
    "iii describes the methods of time domain integration used here and shows all numerical data for evolution of perturbations and quasinormal modes .",
    "sec iv discusses the results obtained .",
    "the lagrangian of the einstein - gauss - bonnet action is @xmath9 here @xmath10 is a positive coupling constant .",
    "the metric has the form , @xmath11 @xmath12 where @xmath13 .    in order to measure all the quantities in terms of the black hole horizon @xmath14 radius we parameterize the black hole mass as @xmath15    as was shown in @xcite , @xcite ,",
    "the gravitational perturbations of a gauss - bonnet black hole can be decoupled from their angular part and reduced to the wave - like equation of the form @xmath16 with the effective potentials which have very cumbersome form @xcite , @xcite .",
    "after some algebra , we managed to simplify the potentials for the tensor , vector and scalar types of the gravitational perturbation respectively :    @xmath17    we used the following dimensionless quantities @xmath18",
    "@xmath19 @xmath20 is the eigenvalue of the angular part of the laplacian .",
    "we study the ringing of gb black hole using a numerical characteristic integration method @xcite , that uses the light - cone variables @xmath21 and @xmath22 . in the characteristic initial value problem ,",
    "initial data are specified on the two null surfaces @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "the discretization scheme we used , is @xmath25 where we have used the following definitions for the points : @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 .    to see the correct time - domain profile at late time we need to calculate precisely the values of the effective potential which are used in ( [ d - uv - eq ] ) .",
    "in order to do this we must integrate numerically the equation for the tortoise coordinate and then solve it with respect to the radial coordinate with high accuracy ( we worked with a precision of @xmath30 ) .",
    "we used simple runge - kutta method for the integration . since it interpolates the function by a cubic spline at each step we are able to find analytically @xmath31 at each step .",
    "the final ` c++ ` programm that finds the time - domain profiles with arbitrary precision is available from the last author upon request .    [ cols= \" > ,",
    "< \" , ]     therefore we can conclude that there is a kind of conceptual gap of what one can consider as a fundamental mode of the quasinormal ringing .",
    "probably , the better choice would be to consider the last stage of ringing , immediately before the tail stage as the one where the fundamental quasinormal modes must be defined .",
    "another essential and distinctive feature of the gauss - bonnet quasinormal ringing is that instability occurs at higher multipole numbers @xmath0 , while lowest @xmath0 are stable !",
    "this is indeed remarkable as , naively , one would expect that if the lowest multipole is stable , then higher multipoles just raise up the pick of the potential barrier , so that higher multipoles should stabilize the potential . yet , for gauss - bonnet black holes , higher multipoles also increase the negative gap near the black hole horizon @xcite , @xcite , allowing existence of bound states in the gap .",
    "this instability at higher multipoles seems to be intrinsic to gauss - bonnet theories , because similar instability was found some time ago in @xcite for gauss - bonnet cosmologies .",
    "one can see the evolution of instability in time domain in fig .",
    "the larger @xmath0 , at the earlier times instability growth occurs , and the stronger the growth rate is ( fig . 5 ) .",
    "in addition , the higher @xmath0 , the smaller threshold value @xmath1 at which instability happens . at @xmath1",
    "smaller than the critical value , black holes are stable .",
    "therefore it is very important not to be limited by small @xmath0 but to see the regime high multipoles , in order to determine the threshold @xmath1 with good accuracy .",
    "analytical estimations of @xcite are compared here with our numerical results in fig.1 , 2 .",
    "there one can see that the estimation of @xcite , which gives an expression for the threshold value @xmath32 , valid for not very large @xmath0 , while at larger @xmath0 instability occurs at smaller @xmath1 .",
    "this decreases the minimal value of @xmath1 , when gauss - bonnet black holes become unstable .",
    "essential point is that the above described instability exists only for @xmath6 and @xmath33 , while at higher @xmath3 the black holes are stable .",
    "it should be explained here that in table iii we have two values of @xmath1 which do not correspond to instabilities , yet do not have any definite quasinormal modes .",
    "the point is that for scalar type of gravitational perturbations , in addition to the negative gap which may deepen when @xmath0 is increasing , there is a negative gap at higher @xmath3 , which is less deep at higher @xmath0 .",
    "this gap does not produce instability , but may suppress the quasinormal ringing by a exponential tail behavior , so that we almost do not see any ringing period ( see fig.3 , 4 ) .",
    "for such a situation , it would be too strong to state that the appearing very short period of oscillations with small real frequency is dominated by some quasinormal modes .",
    "this `` transition '' period happens at intermediate values of @xmath1 , and then some other mode start dominating .",
    "we stress that this rather odd picture , in no way can be suspected as an instability , because this `` transition '' behavior happen also for some parameters , for test scalar field , when stability can be proved analytically .",
    "this kind of negative gap at @xmath34 , is similar to that for the reissner - nordstrm black holes @xcite , which is not deep enough and do not produce the instability .",
    "in this paper the numerical integration in time domain was done for the gravitational perturbations of black holes in @xmath35 gauss - bonnet theories .",
    "the instability occurs only for @xmath6 and @xmath7 cases at some large values of @xmath1 .",
    "higher @xmath3 stabilize the perturbations .",
    "the instability starts after some period of quasinormal ringing and at earlier time for larger multipoles @xmath0 .",
    "apparently the instability at large @xmath1 is a physically expected result : gauss - bonnet black holes is inspired by a one - loop string theory approximation , so that gb theory is valid only as soon as @xmath1 is small enough .",
    "otherwise one needs to take into consideration higher order corrections .",
    "it is interesting to generalize the present work to the case of charged gauss - bonnet black holes and asymptotically de - sitter black holes , because we know that @xmath4-term and the black hole charge give also negative gap to the effective potential , so that if taking into account all these factors , @xmath1-coupling , and @xmath4 and or charge , the parameters range of instability might be increased .",
