    "one starts with a collection of bars , or edges , and fastens them together at hinges , or vertices , that allow either two - dimensional or three - dimensional mobility . in a robot arm , which is a free linkage",
    ", we can fix an initial edge , make each hinge composed of exactly two consecutive bars , and let the terminal vertex move freely .",
    "the space of possible configurations is just a product of circles .    in more general linkages",
    ", we can fix more vertices , make any hinge connect two or more edges , and some vertices can be identified .",
    "for example , if we take two free linkages and identify their initial and terminal vertices , then we obtain a polygonal linkage .",
    "there is a substantial amount of literature on the topological properties of moduli spaces of special polygonal linkages , particularly equilateral polygonal linkages .",
    "a polygonal linkage in @xmath0 is simply a polygon whose vertices are hinges and whose edges are bars .",
    "we are allowed to deform and collapse the polygon without changing the lengths of any bars or any incidences of vertices and edges .",
    "this process can change some ( or possibly all ) of the angles at hinges .",
    "an equilateral polygonal linkage is one where each bar has the same length .",
    "the configuration space of a polygonal linkage is the space of realizations of the linkage .",
    "the generic dimension of this space depends on the number of edges in the linkage and the ambient space .",
    "for example , the dimension of the moduli space of a generic hexagon in @xmath1 is 18 .",
    "but it is convenient to reduce this dimension by fixing one vertex at the origin and one adjacent vertex along one of the coordinate axes .",
    "mathematically speaking , we take space of orbits of configurations for the group of euclidean motions ( translations and rotations ) .",
    "we call this orbit space the moduli space for the linkage .    even though these moduli spaces can not be visualized in general , geometric properties such as dimension , smoothness , betti numbers , etc . , can be investigated .",
    "let @xmath2 be the moduli space of polygonal linkages in @xmath3 , with side lengths @xmath4 , normalized so that the perimeter @xmath5 equals 1 .",
    "in order for @xmath6 to be nonempty , the @xmath4 must belong to a polytope @xmath7 in @xmath3 .",
    "kapovich and millson showed that the topological type of @xmath6 depends on the vector @xmath8 in the following way .",
    "there is a subdivision of the polytope @xmath7 into chambers , the chambers are divided by walls such that the topological type of @xmath9 is constant for @xmath10 in each chamber but undergoes a change as @xmath10 crosses a wall .",

    "we explore combinations of two polygonal linkages which share at least one edge .",
    "we build polygonal and multipolygonal linkages up from free linkages .",
    "the notation for these linkages is set up in section [ s : polyfree ] and [ s : multpoly ] .",
    "the moduli spaces are compact , hausdorff , real triangulable algebraic varieties . in section [ s : multiquad ]",
    "we investigate multiquadrilateral linkages and classify the moduli spaces which have dimension less than two .",
    "in section [ s : gen ] we find topological results for certain classes of multipolygonal linkages .",
    "first we find two classes of multipolygonal linkages that are smooth manifolds .",
    "next , we observe that moduli spaces of multipolygonal linkages can be thought of as a fibered product of moduli spaces of polygonal linkages .",
    "then we join two `` long enough '' edges to a polygonal linkage and determine when the resulting moduli spaces is either equal to or is close to a disjoint union of copies of the original polygonal moduli space .",
    "finally , we find a class of multipolygonal linkages whose moduli space is connected .",
    "in section [ s : spec ] we map the moduli space to @xmath11 via @xmath12 , by sending a configuration to a pre - specified angle in that configuration .",
    "we make use of some technical theorems in differential geometry and algebraic topology to determine when all fibers of the map @xmath12 are homeomorphic , and what can cause the fibers to change topological type and at what angle values .",
    "we conclude the section with a specific example involving an euler characteristic computation .",
    "we define a free linkage in @xmath13 in terms of the lengths of each edge .",

    "the set @xmath15 denotes the space of embeddings of linkages with length vector @xmath10 .",
    "since we will study linkages in the plane , we will write @xmath16 for @xmath17 .",
    "when the lengths are understood , we will simply use @xmath18 .",
    "note that we will use @xmath18 as a particular embedding , but we will also use @xmath19 as a generic object . sometimes we will say `` moving continuously from one point to another point in @xmath18 '' , and other times we will say `` continuously deforming @xmath18 '' .",
    "the difference in usage should be clear from the context .",
    "we define @xmath20 to be the length between the initial vertex @xmath21 and the terminal vertex @xmath22 in @xmath18 .",

    "for example , if we specify a priori a free linkage @xmath32 and a free linkage @xmath33 , and we further force the initial and terminal points of @xmath34 and @xmath35 to agree , then we obtain a hexagonal linkage with lengths in the following order : 3,4,3,1,2,2 .    in this paper",
    "we will study multipolygonal linkages composed of three free linkages embedded in @xmath36 .",

    "in addition , we can mod out by the group @xmath42 of orientation - preserving isometries of @xmath3 . because we already specified that initial and terminal points of each free linkage must agree",
