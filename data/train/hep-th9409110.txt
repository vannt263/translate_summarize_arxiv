    "one of the most intriguing problems in string theory is to understand how space - time emerges naturally . since the vacuum configuration for a critical string is given by a conformal field theory a question which arises in this context is the following . given a conformal field theory , can one construct some corresponding geometrical interpretation ? in this paper we will discuss this question for particularly troublesome conformal field theories .",
    "it is worthwhile to emphasize at the outset that in general when a conformal theory does have a geometrical interpretation it may not be unique . a perusal of even simple systems such as conformal theories with central charge @xmath1 makes this clear . for instance , in this moduli space it is known that a string on the group manifold @xmath2 is equivalent to a string on a circle of radius @xmath3 .",
    "both target spaces have an equal right to be declared _ the _ geometrical interpretation of the conformal field theory .",
    "similarly a circle of radius @xmath4 is equivalent to a circle of radius @xmath5 .",
    "mirror symmetry , in which strings propagating on distinct calabi - yau spaces give identical physical models , is another substantial arena in which geometrical interpretations are not unique .",
    "these ambiguities are a reflection of the rich structure of quantum geometry ; they arise because of the extended nature of the string .    when there are multiple geometric interpretations of a given model , there is no reason why one should be forced to choose between the possibilities .",
    "rather , one can exploit the geometric ambiguity as some interesting physical questions are more easily answered from one interpretation rather than another .",
    "in this paper we shall focus our investigation into the geometric content of certain of @xmath0 conformal theories using the framework established in @xcite .",
    "this approach has the virtue of giving us a physical and mathematical understanding of _ global _ properties of the moduli space of these theories as well as of the theories themselves .",
    "it also gives us the proper arena for understanding the global implications of mirror symmetry .",
    "we will apply this approach to study some theories whose geometrical content has been quite puzzling . for some of these theories ,",
    "previous papers have proposed possible geometrical interpretations @xcite .",
    "we will see that when phrased in the language of @xcite , the previous puzzles are seen to disappear and the geometric status of these theories becomes apparent .",
    "following our remarks above , there need not be one unique interpretation of a given model ; however , we do feel that the approach provided here is especially enlightening and economical .",
    "we will also see that the less natural constructions of @xcite can give misleading results for properties of the corresponding physical model .",
    "we now recall some important background material which will naturally lead us to a summary of the problems we address and the solutions we offer .",
    "our understanding of the geometric content of @xmath6 superconformal theories has undergone impressive growth and revision over the last few years .",
    "the initial picture which emerged from numerous studies is schematically given in figure [ fig:1]a .",
    "we have an abstract @xmath6 conformal field theory moduli space that is geometrically interpretable in terms of complex structure and khler structure deformations of an associated calabi - yau manifold of @xmath7 complex dimensions and a fixed topological type .",
    "the space of khler forms naturally exists as a bounded domain ( the complexification of the `` khler cone '' ) which we denote as a cube .",
    "the moduli space of complex structures does not have this form and is more usually compactified to form a compact space .",
    "observables in each of the conformal theories in the moduli space are related to geometrical constructs on the corresponding calabi - yau space , the latter being taken as the target space of a nonlinear sigma model .",
    "this picture was extended to that given in figure [ fig:1]b after the discovery of mirror symmetry .",
    "two calabi - yau spaces @xmath8 and @xmath9 constitute a mirror pair if they yield isomorphic conformal theories when taken as the target space for a two - dimensional supersymmetric nonlinear , with the explicit isomorphism being a change in sign of the left moving @xmath10 charges of all fields .",
    "geometrically this implies that the hodge numbers @xmath11 and @xmath12 are related to those of @xmath9 by @xmath13 and @xmath14 . since the cohomology groups @xmath15 and @xmath16 correspond to khler and complex structure deformations , respectively , we see that the underlying conformal field theory moduli space has the two geometrical interpretations given in the figure",
    ". this immediately led to a problem since , as mentioned above , the geometric form of the moduli spaces of khler forms and complex structures appeared to be quite different .",
    "this was resolved by the works of @xcite to that shown in figure [ fig:1]c . here",
    "we see that the appropriate interpretation of the conformal field theory moduli space has required that the khler moduli space of @xmath8 be replaced by its `` enlarged khler moduli space '' ( and similarly for @xmath9 ) .",
    "the latter contains numerous regions in addition to the khler cone of the topological manifold @xmath8 .",
    "for instance , it typically contains regions corresponding to the khler cones of calabi - yau spaces related to @xmath8 by the birational operation of flopping a rational curve , regions corresponding to the moduli space of singular blow - downs of @xmath8 and its birational partners , and regions interpretable in terms of the parameter space of ( gauged or ungauged ) landau - ginzburg models fibered over various compact spaces .",
    "the complex structure moduli space can also be equipped with a phase structure @xcite  as must happen to preserve mirror symmetry .",
    "we note that from the  point of view the phase regions in the complex structure moduli space have a less pronounced physical interpretation .",
    "this is because in analyzing the we use perturbation theory in khler modes ( which fix the size of the calabi - yau ) and hence this approximation method is not mirror symmetric .",
    "however , the phase structure in the complex structure moduli space of @xmath8 _ is _ the phase structure in the enlarged khler moduli space of @xmath9 and it is the latter interpretation where this phase structure is most manifest . for the purposes of this paper we may ignore the phase structure in the complex structure part of the moduli space and for this reason we have put parentheses around this in [ fig:1]c .",
    "the results of the present paper all stem directly from a careful study of the phase diagrams of figure [ fig:1]c .",
    "we shall review the quantitative construction of these phase spaces in section [ s : ph ] ; for now we will content ourselves with the schematic description given and summarize our results with a similar level of informality .",
    "there are numerous ways of constructing @xmath0 superconformal theories with @xmath17 .",
    "some constructions , such as the calabi - yau s described above , are manifestly geometric in character .",
    "other constructions do not begin with a geometrical target space and hence their geometrical content , if any , can only be assessed after more detailed study .",
    "more generally and pragmatically , given an abstract conformal field theory in some presentation , how do we determine if it has a geometrical interpretation ?",
    "we will not seek to answer this question in generality , but rather will focus attention on those theories for which we can construct the phase diagram illustrated in figure [ fig:1]c .",
    "for theories of this sort , as we shall review , toric geometry supplies us with a geometric description of each theory .",
    "we hasten to emphasize , though , that calabi - yau s are but one kind of corresponding geometry .",
    "we will see , for instance , that landau - ginzburg orbifolds can be associated with noncompact , generally singular , configuration spaces . from our brief discussion here and also from @xcite",
    "one might think that any theory with a phase diagram such as that in figure [ fig:1]c , has regions interpretable in terms of calabi - yau s. after all , our progression from figures [ fig:1]a through [ fig:1]c has centered around khler cones of calabi - yau spaces .",
    "this conclusion , as we shall see in detail in section [ s : appl ] , is false and comes to bear on a number of issues , including that of the generality of mirror symmetry .",
    "namely , there are calabi - yau manifolds that are rigid , i.e. that have trivial @xmath16 .",
    "the mirror to such a space , therefore , should have @xmath18 .",
    "this is troublesome , though , because calabi - yau spaces are khler and hence have at least one nontrivial element in @xmath15 . with the above discussion , and explicit calculation in section [ s : appl ] , the resolution to this puzzle becomes clear : the enlarged khler moduli space for the theory mirror to the one associated with the rigid space @xmath8 _ does not contain a region interpretable in terms of a calabi - yau _ .",
    "in fact , the enlarged khler moduli space , in contrast to the generic case illustrated in figure [ fig:1]c , is zero - dimensional and consists of a single point . by direct analysis",
    ", we show that the corresponding theory is a landau - ginzburg orbifold - not a calabi - yau  - and hence it is perfectly consistent for the theory to lack a khler modulus .",
    "we note at the outset that possible resolutions to the question of the identity of mirrors to rigid calabi - yau spaces have been previously presented in @xcite .",
    "these authors have invoked unexpected additional structures such as non - calabi - yau spaces of dimension greater than @xmath7 and supermanifolds in an attempt to resolve this issue .",
    "contrary to these works , we see here that absolutely no additional structure is required .",
    "rather , rigid calabi - yau manifolds fit perfectly into the general framework introduced in @xcite .",
    "in addition to applying our analysis to the case of rigid calabi - yau manifolds and their mirrors , we also study two other interesting phenomena .",
    "first , we present an example of a theory with nonzero dimensional enlarged khler moduli space that does not contain a geometric region thus showing that the mere existence of a would - be khler form does not guarantee a calabi - yau interpretation .",
    "second , we briefly discuss an example ( first pointed out in @xcite ) whose enlarged khler moduli space has a phase whose target space has the desired dimension but is not of the calabi - yau type .",
    "the moduli space of @xmath0 superconformal theories is most naturally interpretable in terms of a collection of regions within which the theory assumes a particular phase . amongst the possibilities are smooth and singular geometric calabi - yau phases , gauged and ungauged landau - ginzburg phases , as well as orbifolds and hybrids thereof",
    "this is the burden of figure [ fig:1]c .",
    "the existence and quantitative construction of these phase diagrams has been approached from two distinct vantage points in the works of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "in fact , a point which is not as fully appreciated as it might be is that these two approaches , although phrased in different languages , are _",
    "isomorphic_. different questions , though , are often more easily answered from one of the two formalisms and hence it is important to fully understand both approaches and their precise relationship .",
    "it is the purpose of the present section to explain these issues .",
    "we note that the material in this section is implicit in @xcite and @xcite ; for our purposes we need to make the relation explicit .    in brief , both @xcite and @xcite build constrained @xmath0 supersymmetric quantum field theories . in the physical approach of @xcite these constraints",
    "are phrased in terms of _ symplectic _ quotients . in the mathematical approach of @xcite these constraints",
    "are phrased in terms of _ holomorphic _ quotients .",
    "the well - known equivalence @xcite of these two approaches then implies that each constructs the same theory and hence also the same phase diagrams . the proper language for establishing these statements",
    "is that of _ toric geometry _ for which the reader can find a primer in @xcite . in the following",
    "we will try to convey the main points with a minimum of unnecessary technical detail .",
    "complex projective space may be considered to be the prototypical toric variety .",
    "one constructs @xmath19 by taking the @xmath20 homogeneous coordinates , @xmath21 , spanning @xmath22 , removing the origin @xmath23 and modding out by the @xmath24-action @xmath25 , @xmath26 .",
    "a toric variety is simply a generalization of this concept with perhaps more than one @xmath24-action and a possibly more complicated point set removed prior to the modding out process .",
    "the most natural way of building a @xmath27=2  with a complex projective target space appears to be in terms of a @xmath10-gauged field theory @xcite . in this construction , one begins with the homogeneous coordinates , @xmath21 , denoting chiral superfields , each with the same @xmath10 charge , @xmath28 , ( which we may take to be 1 ) .",
    "the classical vacuum of such a theory may be determined by finding the minimum of the classical potential energy . solving the algebraic equations for the auxiliary d - component of the gauge multiplet and including the result in the scalar potential yields the familiar contribution @xmath29 where @xmath30 , a real number , is the coefficient of the familiar fayet - illiopoulos d - term .",
    "we take @xmath30 to be positive here to avoid navely breaking supersymmetry ( see section 3.2 of @xcite for a discussion on negative values of @xmath30 ) . minimizing the energy forces us to require that ( [ eq : ve1 ] ) should vanish .",
    "this immediately removes the origin @xmath23 from consideration .",
    "it also forces the @xmath21 to lie on the sphere @xmath31 . we may now divide out by the @xmath10 ( i.e. , @xmath32 ) action to form @xmath33 .",
    "the process of dividing by @xmath24 , in the usual formulation of @xmath19 may be viewed to having taken place in two stages .",
    "first we fix an @xmath34 degree of freedom by imposing the vanishing of ( [ eq : ve1 ] ) and then we divide out by @xmath32 .",
    "the equivalence of these two constructions then follows from the fact that @xmath35 .",
    "dividing by the former is a simple example of a holomorphic quotient ; dividing by the latter is a simple example of a symplectic quotient .",
    "we have just seen , therefore , the essential reason why these two are equivalent .",
    "let us now discuss how witten generalized upon this quantum field theory approach of generating symplectic quotients .",
    "we will then discuss their equivalent holomorphic quotient description as in @xcite .",
    "witten @xcite extended the above model to describe not a complex projective space but the `` canonical '' line bundle of complex projective space ( see , for example , @xcite for the precise definition of this bundle ) .",
    "let us reserve @xmath36 to denote the dimension of the toric variety in question so now we are looking at a line bundle over @xmath37 and the variable @xmath38 will now be treated differently to the others .",
    "this space is then built from @xmath22 by removing the point @xmath39 and modding out by the action @xmath40 to produce this from the gauged  point of view we put @xmath41 for @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "the vanishing of the classical potential now implies @xmath44 we see that there are classical vacuum solutions for @xmath30 for either sign .",
    "if @xmath45 , we thus recover the required target space as in the case of the projective space .",
    "if however @xmath46 , we find that @xmath47 and we have no condition on @xmath48 .",
    "let us consider this space more closely .",
    "removing the point set @xmath49 from @xmath22 and dividing by the action ( [ eq : cs1 ] ) produces another toric variety .",
    "@xmath38 may be fixed by choosing a value for @xmath50 leaving the @xmath36th roots of unity to act on the space spanned by @xmath51 .",
    "thus the toric variety is @xmath52 .",
    "therefore we see that the geometry of the target space can change discontinuously as we vary @xmath30 .",
    "this theory is said to have two _ phases _ where the relevant toric variety is either the canonical line bundle of @xmath37 or @xmath52 .",
    "the construction of @xcite does nt quite stop here .",
    "one may introduce a @xmath10-invariant superpotential , @xmath53 , i.e. , a @xmath24-invariant polynomial over the @xmath21 s . minimizing the classical potential now",
    "also implies that we are at a critical point of @xmath53 .",
    "our toric `` ambient '' space will always turn out to be non - compact .",
    "this however will contain compact subspaces which may also be considered as toric varieties themselves .",
    "clearly @xmath37 is a toric subspace of the canonical line bundle over @xmath37 .",
    "the only compact toric subspace of @xmath52 is the point at the origin . assuming that @xmath53 is suitably generic , the effect of including the superpotential term is to force the classical vacuum to be equal to , or contained in some compact toric subspace of the ambient space .    in our example",
    ", a suitable @xmath53 is @xmath54 . in the canonical line bundle over @xmath37 case ,",
    "the critical point set of @xmath53 consists of the hypersurface @xmath55 in @xmath37 .",
    "this is a compact  @xmath56-fold . this is thus named , the _ _ phase . in the @xmath52 case ,",
    "the origin is the critical point set of @xmath53 .",
    "thus our classical vacuum is simply one point .",
    "the effective superpotential of this theory however allows for massless fluctuations around this point given by a landau - ginzburg superpotential @xmath57 .",
    "this is thus the _ _ phase .",
    "note that all fluctuations around the vacuum in the  phase are massive .",
    "let us fix some notation",
    ". of this paper is the @xmath58 of @xcite .",
    "] we will call the ambient non - compact toric space @xmath59 .",
    "this contains a maximal compact toric subset @xmath60 ( which may be reducible ) . within @xmath60",
    "we have the classical vacuum of the quantum field theory which we denote @xmath8 .    a simple generalization of the above construction is to consider a weighted projective space for @xmath60 . clearly this may be achieved by giving different charges to @xmath51 . following the above formalism",
    "we would again obtain two phases depending on whether @xmath30 was less than or greater than zero . when we look at the associated conformal field theory it turns out that this does not capture the full moduli space , i.e. , @xmath61 for many of these theories .",
    "it is not hard to generalize the present description to include at least some of these other degrees of freedom . for each such independent direction in the moduli space",
    "we are able to access in this formalism , we introduce a @xmath10 gauge factor and a corresponding parameter @xmath62 .",
    "thus , the total gauge group is @xmath63 where @xmath64 is the dimension of this subspace of the moduli space .",
    "the chiral fields will in general be charged under all of the @xmath10 factors , and hence we write @xmath65 to denote the charge of the @xmath66 chiral superfield under @xmath67 .",
    "the superpotential @xmath53 must now be a @xmath68-invariant combination of the chiral superfields .",
    "it turns out that the language of toric geometry is precisely suited for determining all of the data needed for building such a model .",
    "namely , in the case of @xmath69 ( or more generally , @xmath64 is the number of distinct toric factors making up the ambient space ) it is straightforward to figure out appropriate charges so that minimization of the scalar potential yields the desired model .",
    "when @xmath64 is not of this form , the problem requires a more systematic treatment ; this is precisely what the formalism of toric geometry supplies .",
    "furthermore , for these more general cases , it proves increasingly difficult to determine the phase diagram of the model by studying the minimum of the scalar potential for various values of the @xmath70 .",
    "the formalism of toric geometry , as described in @xcite , supplies us with a far more efficient means of determining the phase structure , as well .",
    "hence , let us now recast the above formulation directly in terms of toric geometry .",
    "the homogeneous coordinates ( in the sense of @xcite ) @xmath71 form a natural representation of the group @xmath72 .",
    "let us form a toric variety by removing some point set and dividing the resultant space by @xmath73 .",
    "clearly the space formed , @xmath59 , is acted upon non - trivially by @xmath74 .",
    "let us introduce @xmath75 , @xmath76 , as the natural representation of this @xmath74-action .",
    "that is , the @xmath75 provide coordinates on a dense open subset of @xmath59 .",
    "this follows since @xmath59 may be regarded itself as a compactification of @xmath74 .",
    "let us relate these new `` affine '' coordinates to the homogeneous coordinates by @xmath77 where @xmath78 .",
    "we may represent the @xmath79 matrix , @xmath80 , by a collection of @xmath27 points , which we denote @xmath81 , living in an @xmath36-dimensional real space where @xmath80 is the @xmath82th coordinate of the @xmath83th point .",
    "let us demand that @xmath81 is such that there exists an @xmath36-dimensional lattice @xmath84 within this same space ( which we denote @xmath85 ) such that @xmath86 the notation @xmath87 will denote the position vector of the @xmath83th point of @xmath81 in @xmath84 .",
    "consider now the charges of the homogeneous coordinates under the @xmath73 by which we modded out .",
    "denote these @xmath65 where @xmath88 and @xmath89 .",
    "the obvious short exact sequence @xmath90 induces , @xmath91    thus , we see that the charges @xmath92 are simply the _ kernel of the transpose of the matrix whose elements are _ @xmath80",
    ". the reader should check that in the simple case , say , of projective space discussed earlier , that the charge assignment posited can in fact be derived in this manner .",
    "now define @xmath93 as the dual lattice to @xmath84 .",
    "let us demand that there is an element @xmath94 such that @xmath95 this condition is similar to stating that @xmath59 be a space with vanishing canonical class , @xmath96 , ( or zero first chern class ) .",
    "actually @xmath59 need not be smooth so be need to be more careful about our language .",
    "the correct term from algebraic geometry is that @xmath59 is _ gorenstein _ ( see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "applying ( [ eq : hypln ] ) to ( [ eq : krnl ] ) tells us that @xmath97 this appears as an important condition in @xcite ensuring freedom from anomalies in certain chiral currents which should be present if there is an infrared limit with @xmath27=2 superconformal invariance .",
    "it is curious to note that ( [ eq : q0 ] ) is not sufficient to guarantee ( [ eq : hypln ] ) .",
    "we may have @xmath98 for example , for some integer @xmath99 .",
    "@xmath59 would then be @xmath100-gorenstein which is roughly saying that @xmath101 but @xmath96 may be a non - trivial torsion element .",
    "the effect of this in terms of the two dimension quantum field theory has not been studied .",
    "this point set @xmath81 gives us all the information we require to build @xmath59 except which point set should be removed from @xmath72 before performing the quotient .",
    "this is performed in toric geometry by building a fan , @xmath102 .",
    "a fan is a collection of tesselating cones in @xmath103 with apexes at the origin .",
    "the intersection of this fan with the hyperplane containing @xmath81 will be a set of tesselating polytopes .",
    "the convex hull of this set of polytopes must be the convex hull of @xmath81 and the vertices of the polytopes must be elements of @xmath81 .",
    "thus each cone , @xmath104 , in @xmath102 is `` generated '' by a subset of @xmath81 .",
    "we say @xmath105 if @xmath87 is one of the generators , i.e. , @xmath87 lies at a vertex of the intersection of @xmath104 with the hyperplane in @xmath103 containing @xmath81 .",
    "the point set @xmath106 removed from @xmath107 prior to quotienting is then specified by @xmath108 where @xmath109 is the point with coordinates @xmath21 .",
    "the fact that different fans may be associated with the point - set @xmath81 gives rise to the phase structure .",
    "we need only consider the case where all the @xmath104 s are simplicial based cones , i.e. , we induce a simplicial decomposition of triangulation of @xmath81 . to each such fan",
    "( satisfying in addition a certain `` convexity '' property , see @xcite for more details ) we associate a phase .",
    "other fans consistent with @xmath81 not satisfying these conditions may always be considered as models on the boundary between two or more phases .",
    "the parameters , @xmath30 , in the linear  approach give us an identical fan structure .",
    "this is best understood from examining figure 11 of @xcite .",
    "the @xmath30 parameters , in essence , fix the heights of the points in this figure and hence following the discussion of section of 3.8 of @xcite their values determine a triangulation of the point set @xmath81 . from a physical point of view",
    "we can group together those values for the @xmath30 parameters which yield the same phase for the model . in this way we partition the space of all possible @xmath30 s into a phase diagram .",
    "this phase diagram is the `` secondary fan '' for the moduli space as discussed in @xcite .",
    "we now have a dictionary between @xcite and the toric approach : _ specifying generic values of `` @xmath30 '' parameters is equivalent to specifying a triangulation of @xmath81 .",
    "the non - vanishing conditions on the fields @xmath21 specified by minimizing the @xmath110-term part of the classical potential is equivalent to removing the point set @xmath106 given by _",
    "( [ eq : fset ] ) .",
    "note that requiring @xmath81 to be `` complete '' in the sense of ( [ eq : acvx ] ) is not necessary in the analysis of @xcite . by imposing this condition",
    "we gain access to the largest subspace of the moduli space we can reach by this toric method .    one point in the dictionary between @xcite and",
    "the toric approach which we have not spelled out explicitly as yet is how we determine the superpotential @xmath53 from the toric data .",
    "this is straightforward as we now describe .",
    "let us @xmath68 to denote the group @xmath73 .",
    "@xmath53 is a @xmath68-invariant polynomial in the chiral superfields . from ( [ eq : krnl ] ) we see that any monomial of the form @xmath111 for a fixed but arbitrary vector @xmath112 is @xmath68-invariant .",
    "however , we want all terms in @xmath53 to not only be @xmath68-invariant but also to have nonnegative integral exponents . towards this end",
    "we are naturally led to introduce the cone @xmath113 in @xmath114 , dual to @xmath115 which is the cone over the convex hull of @xmath81 in @xmath103 , defined by @xmath116 the integral lattice points in @xmath113 , when substituted for the vector @xmath112 in ( [ eq : prod ] ) , will then generate @xmath68-invariant monomials with nonnegative exponents .",
    "to systematize this , we now define @xmath117 by @xmath118 the integral lattice points contained in the dual cone .",
    "any point in @xmath119 , if substituted for the vector @xmath112 in ( [ eq : prod ] ) , yields a @xmath68-invariant nonnegative exponent monomial .",
    "finally , we note that we would like @xmath53 to be a suitably `` quasihomogeneous '' polynomial of lowest nontrivial degree in the @xmath21 .",
    "this will remove any `` irrelevant '' terms in the superpotential @xcite and may be achieved as follows .",
    "let the monomials in this reduced superpotentials be labeled by elements of @xmath120 .",
    "following @xcite let us put one last condition on @xmath81 , namely that when we derive the point set @xmath121 exists a vector @xmath122 such that @xmath123 and that the vectors given by the elements of @xmath121 ( or a subset of @xmath121 ) generate @xmath113 .",
    "we also impose the condition on @xmath121 paralleling our discussion for the point set @xmath81 .",
    "namely , we can say @xmath124 with the elements of @xmath121 at the vertices of this convex hull generating @xmath113 .",
    "we denote by @xmath125 the number of points in @xmath121 so that @xmath126 .",
    "the superpotential @xmath53 is then constructed according to @xmath127 for @xmath128 with @xmath129    we may note at this point that mirror symmetry is conjectured to exchange the sets @xmath130 .",
    "this may be regarded as a generalization of the `` monomial - divisor mirror map '' of @xcite .",
    "the mirror pairs of @xcite ( which is established at the conformal field theory level ) are a subset of this general construction and the examples in sections [ ss : z ] and [ ss : h1 ] are in this subset .",
    "thus statement concerning mirror symmetry with regards to these examples may be regarded as definitely true .",
    "also note that our analysis of the phases of the moduli space does not depend on the mirror map and thus does not depend on this mirror conjecture .",
    "now let us try to calculate the central charge @xmath131 of the conformal field theory associated to this model .",
    "we may apply the same reasoning as was used in @xcite to determine this .",
    "firstly we have @xmath27 chiral superfields each of which contributes @xmath132 to @xmath7 .",
    "this may be taken to correspond to the string propagating in @xmath107 .",
    "we also have @xmath133 vector superfields which we take to contribute @xmath134 to @xmath7 since each removes one complex dimension from the target space .",
    "thus , so far we have @xmath135 . however ,",
    "the string is further confined by the superpotential @xmath53 and we expect this to reduce the value of @xmath7 as we now show .",
    "consider now rescaling by an element of @xmath72 , @xmath136 the monomial @xmath137 then scales to @xmath138 where @xmath139 consider choosing the weights @xmath140 such that @xmath141 then all the monomials transform @xmath142 and thus , declaring @xmath143 to be invariant , we have @xmath144 . taking the inner product of ( [ eq : wcond ] ) with @xmath145 gives @xmath146 it was shown in @xcite that the effect of the superpotential is to contribute @xmath147 to @xmath7 .",
    "thus we have @xmath148 in agreement with the conjecture in @xcite .    for the cases considered in @xcite based upon the construction of @xcite we had @xmath149 .",
    "this then is a generalization .",
    "it should be noted that this more generalized picture could have been deduced directly by applying the toric language to witten s formulation of @xcite although historically it was first written in the form of @xcite where it was used specifically for conjecturing the mirror map for complete intersections in toric varieties .",
    "to summarize so far , all the data we require to build an abelian gauged linear  of the form studied in @xcite is the matrix @xmath80 . to provide a consistent model for a conformal field theory we demand that this matrix be compatible with @xmath145 and @xmath150 and be consistent with the existence of @xmath84 in the form of ( [ eq : acvx ] )",
    "once we have this information we may apply the technology of @xcite to determine the geometry of the various phases in the moduli space of khler forms .",
    "this is most easily determined in terms of triangulations of the point set @xmath81 .",
    "there is one more piece of information we will need before moving on to some examples concerning orbifolding . the toric variety @xmath59 is acted upon by @xmath74 .",
    "it is simple in toric geometry to describe the orbifold of @xmath59 by a discrete subgroup of this @xmath74 .",
    "consider the affine coordinates introduced by ( [ eq : aff ] ) .",
    "let us consider the element , @xmath151 which acts by @xmath152 where @xmath153 .",
    "we can see ( for more details consult @xcite ) that dividing @xmath59 by the group generated by @xmath154 is equivalent to replacing the lattice @xmath84 by a lattice generated by @xmath155 and the vector @xmath156 .",
    "the reason for this is that lattice points @xmath157 in @xmath84 represent one ( complex ) parameter group actions on the toric variety @xmath158 for points @xmath157 whose components are non - integral , such a map is only well defined if certain global identifications are made on the @xmath159 . in particular , one directly sees that taking @xmath157 to be @xmath160 requires the desired identification of ( [ eq : iden ] ) .",
    "let us now illustrate the general method of the previous section by applying it to various examples .",
    "the possibilities offered by this formulation appear to be very rich but we select here a few key examples to emphasize points relevant to our discussion .",
    "suppose that @xmath161 . in this case",
    "it is easy to see that @xmath162 and that this point lies properly in the interior of the convex hull of @xmath81 ( since @xmath163 is strictly positive ) .",
    "one possible triangulation of the point set @xmath81 thus consists of drawing lines from @xmath150 to each point on the vertices of the convex hull and filling this skeleton in with a suitable set of simplices to form a triangulation .",
    "the resultant set forms a complete fan of dimension @xmath164 with center @xmath150 .",
    "this fan @xmath165 corresponds to a compact @xmath166-dimensional toric sub - variety @xmath60 of @xmath59 .",
    "let us denote by @xmath157 the homogeneous coordinate corresponding to @xmath150 .",
    "we see from ( [ eq : mon ] ) that every term in the superpotential appears linearly in @xmath157 .",
    "thus we may write @xmath167 where @xmath68 is a function of the @xmath168 homogeneous coordinates describing @xmath60 . thus the condition @xmath169 implies @xmath170  i.e. , we are on a hypersurface within @xmath60 . for a generic @xmath68 ,",
    "the other derivatives of @xmath53 imply that @xmath171 .",
    "the target space , @xmath8 , is now a hypersurface within @xmath60 which itself has dimension @xmath164 .",
    "@xmath8 is thus of dimension @xmath172 .",
    "the equation ( [ eq : d ] ) tells us that @xmath173 .",
    "in fact @xmath8 is an anticanonical divisor of @xmath60 @xcite and is thus a  space of @xmath7 dimensions .",
    "note that @xmath8 may not be smooth but these singularities can often be removed by further refinements of the fan @xmath165 .",
    "actually , in the case @xmath174 the singularities may always be removed in this way .",
    "for the case @xmath161 we therefore always have a `` '' phase .",
    "that is , some limit in the moduli space where we may go to build some non - linear  of the conformal field theory ( although in case @xmath175 we may have to include considerations such as terminal orbifold singularities in our model ) .",
    "the case considered here is basically of the type studied in @xcite as shown in @xcite .",
    "it also includes the example of the model with the phase in @xmath52 and the  hypersurface in @xmath37 discussed above .",
    "we now turn to the issue of rigid calabi - yau spaces and their mirrors . for concreteness",
    "we focus on the z - orbifold of @xcite . recall that this is the torus of six real dimensions divided by a diagonal @xmath176 action .",
    "it has 36 ( 1,1)-forms ( 9 from the original torus and 27 associated with blow up modes ) and no ( 2,1)-forms . it is therefore rigid . using the construction of @xcite , it was shown in @xcite how to construct the z - orbifold in terms of an orbifold of a gepner model @xcite . to phrase this more carefully allowing for the phase structure ,",
    "one builds a conformal field theory as an orbifold of a gepner model which may be deformed via marginal operators to a theory corresponding to a  whose target space is the blown - up z - orbifold .",
    "it was also shown how to build a conformal field theory giving the mirror of the above theory , also as a orbifold of the gepner model .",
    "the gepner model itself is believed to be equivalent to an orbifold of a  theory . in the case under consideration ( the @xmath177 model )",
    "the configuration space of this  orbifold theory is @xmath178 .",
    "the space @xmath179 is a toric variety with @xmath180 described simply by the fan consisting of one cone , @xmath104 , isomorphic to the positive quadrant of @xmath181 .",
    "that is , @xmath81 consists of the points @xmath182 .",
    "the required @xmath176 quotient is performed by adding the generator @xmath183 to the integral lattice of @xmath181 .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that the mirror of the z - orbifold was obtained by dividing by a further @xmath176 ( i.e. , taking a @xmath176 orbifold of the gepner model ) given by the vector @xmath184 to give the required @xmath84-lattice .",
    "we may apply a @xmath185 transformation to @xmath103 to rotate @xmath84 back into the standard integral lattice .",
    "this will act on @xmath104 so that it is no longer the positive quadrant .",
    "one choice of transformation leaves @xmath104 generated by @xmath186 these 9 points lie in the hyperplane defined by @xmath187 .",
    "it is a simple matter to show that the dual cone gives @xmath188 so that @xmath81 has the required properties .",
    "the important property of this model stems from the fact that the points @xmath189 form the vertices of a simplex with _ no _ interior points lying on the lattice @xmath84 .",
    "that is , the set @xmath81 consists only of those points listed in ( [ eq : az ] ) .",
    "thus the only triangulation of @xmath81 consists of this simplex !",
    "this model has @xmath190 with superpotential @xmath191 the critical point of @xmath53 is the origin .",
    "thus we have an orbifold of a  theory as expected . since there is no other triangulation of @xmath81",
    "there is no other phase and , in particular , _ no  phase_. since @xmath192 we are not in conflict with the section [ ss : hyp ] .",
    "as expected we see that @xmath193 in agreement with the fact that this theory is the mirror of a smooth  threefold ( i.e. , the blow - up of the z - orbifold ) .    thus , by properly understanding the full content of mirror symmetry",
    " as a symmetry between the moduli spaces of @xmath0 superconformal theories  we see that there is no puzzle regarding the mirror of a rigid calabi - yau manifold .",
    "the mirror description simply does not have a calabi - yau phase and hence the absence of a khler form causes no conflict .",
    "it is important to realize that we have all the information we need to study this model without recourse to finding some other effective target space geometry .",
    "in particular , deformations of complex structure are achieved by deforming the @xmath143 parameters in ( [ eq : wz ] ) in the usual way and one may then use mirror symmetry to study the moduli space of khler forms of the z - orbifold as was done in @xcite .",
    "the lack of a  phase appears due to the existence of _ terminal _ singularities in algebraic geometry as we now discuss ( see also @xcite for a more thorough account ) . in section",
    "[ s : ph ] we discussed the case of a landau - ginzburg theory in @xmath52 . in this case , the @xmath194 symmetry is generated by @xmath195 .",
    "this singularity may be blown - up to give the canonical line bundle over @xmath37 .",
    "this smooth space has trivial canonical class .",
    "thus the singularity @xmath52 may be blown up without adding something non - trivial into the canonical class .",
    "such a blow - up mode is always visible in the associated conformal field theory as a truly marginal operator since it may be regarded as a deformation of the khler form .",
    "a terminal singularity is a singularity which can not be resolved ( or even partially resolved ) without adding something non - trivial to the canonical class .",
    "the singularity @xmath178 generated by @xmath196 of ( [ eq : g1z ] ) is precisely such a singularity . as such , from the conformal field theory point of view ,",
    "it is `` stuck '' .",
    "this agrees with the fact that the gepner model contains no marginal operators corresponding to deformations of the khler form .",
    "one can go ahead and blow - up the @xmath178 singularity if one really desires some smooth manifold .",
    "there is no unique prescription for this but one may , for example , form the space @xmath197 .",
    "this is a line bundle over @xmath198 with @xmath199 ( i.e. , @xmath200 ) .",
    "the homogeneous coordinates of this projective space may be given by the coordinates of the original @xmath179 .",
    "the superpotential of the landau - ginzburg theory is cubic in these fields and so one might try to associate this model to the cubic hypersurface in @xmath198 .",
    "this is the essence of the construction of @xcite .",
    "note that in the language of this paper , we no longer satisfy ( [ eq : q0 ] ) and so our field theory is expected to have undesirable properties in the infrared limit .",
    "when we try to describe the mirror of the z - orbifold , the situation becomes even worse .",
    "the second @xmath176 quotient given by @xmath201 induces further terminal quotient singularities on @xmath198 which require considerably more to be added to the canonical class .",
    "we hope the reader sees that this procedure of forcing a smooth geometrical interpretation when terminal singularities appear is completely unnatural when written in terms of the underlying conformal field theory and it is unnecessary when one adopts the phase picture .",
    "the mirror of the z - orbifold need only be described as an orbifold of a landau - ginzburg theory in @xmath179 .",
    "we should add that the construction of @xcite should be expected to overcome the renormalization group flow problem inherent in the above hypersurface in @xmath198 of @xcite .",
    "in the construction of @xcite one adds ghost fields to reduce the effective dimension of the target space back down to that of @xmath7 .",
    "assuming this is the case , this target space with ghosts can be proposed as a good geometric interpretation of the conformal field theory .",
    "it should be pointed out however that such geometric interpretations are probably highly ambiguous .",
    "that is , one conformal field theory can be given many interpretations .",
    "this occurs in @xcite where constructions of k3 conformal field theories are given in terms of a 4 complex dimensional space with ghosts whereas the complete moduli space is already understood completely in terms of k3 surfaces @xcite .",
    "in fact , it is probable that any geometric model may be blown - up to give @xmath199 and then nonzero contributions the the @xmath202-function be cancelled by adding suitable extra fields . since there are an infinite number of such blow - ups for any model there is the possibility of ascribing an infinity of geometric interpretations of this form .",
    "finally note that it might be possible to associate some geometry with the case discussed in this section by considering orbifolds with discrete torsion @xcite .",
    "since we do not understand precisely how to relate quotient singularities with discrete torsion to classical singularities we will not discuss this interpretation here .",
    "the above example may be considered rather trivial in that our phase space was zero dimensional , i.e. , consisted of only one point .",
    "let us now give a less trivial example which still has no  phase .",
    "consider dividing @xmath179 by the group @xmath204 groups generated by @xmath205 using the arguments of @xcite one may show that the  theory in this space is the mirror of the orbifold @xmath206 where @xmath207 is a complex torus , the @xmath208 group is generated by @xmath209 and @xmath210 by @xmath211 , where @xmath212 are the complex coordinates on the tori .",
    "the @xmath213-form @xmath214 is invariant under this group .",
    "indeed @xmath215 for this orbifold is equal to 1 .",
    "thus we expect the case in question to have @xmath203 .",
    "the point set @xmath81 corresponding to such a space is given by @xmath180 and @xmath216 with @xmath217 and @xmath218 .",
    "therefore this theory has @xmath193 again .",
    "the points @xmath189 form a simplex with @xmath219 positioned along the edge joining @xmath220 and @xmath221 .",
    "thus all the interesting part of the point set as regards triangulations is contained in this line @xmath222 : @xmath223{$\\alpha_{11}$ } } \\put(155,635){\\makebox(0,0)[lb]{$\\alpha_1 $ } } \\put(235,635){\\makebox(0,0)[lb]{$\\alpha_{10}$ } } \\put(395,635){\\makebox(0,0)[lb]{$\\alpha_{12}$ } } \\put(475,635){\\makebox(0,0)[lb]{$\\alpha_2 $ } } \\end{picture}\\ ] ] the points @xmath219 may , or may not be included in the triangulation ( and are hence shown as circles rather than dots ) .    if none of the points @xmath219 are included in the triangulation , we have one simplex with vertices @xmath189 and the associated toric variety is @xmath224 as expected . if all these points are included in the triangulation we have 4 simplices .",
    "the resulting space is a partial resolution of the @xmath224 space .",
    "the exceptional divisor introduced is a `` plumb product '' of three @xmath225 spaces .",
    "each of the points @xmath219 may be taken to correspond to one of these @xmath225 components .",
    "this is shown in figure [ fig : z4b ] .",
    "the black dot on the left hand side shows the isolated singularity . on the right hand side",
    "the singularity ( which is now terminal ) covers the whole exceptional divisor . clearly",
    ", other triangulations represent intermediate steps in this blow - up .",
    "let us now analyze the critical point set of @xmath53 .",
    "finding @xmath121 we determine from ( [ eq : mon ] ) that @xmath226 in total there are 87 points in @xmath121 but we need only consider the above terms with nonzero @xmath227 for a sufficiently generic @xmath53 .    consider the maximal triangulation .",
    "this includes all three points @xmath219 . since @xmath228",
    "we need to remove the set @xmath106 given by ( [ eq : fset ] ) from @xmath229 .",
    "this amounts in imposing @xmath230 or @xmath231 or @xmath232 or @xmath233 .",
    "we also wish to impose @xmath234 for @xmath235 .",
    "it is straight - forward to show that these conditions require @xmath236 and that @xmath237 and @xmath238 can not both be zero simultaneously . as @xmath239",
    "we have three @xmath24 actions to divide this subspace of @xmath240 by .",
    "two may be used to fix @xmath241 and @xmath242 to specific values .",
    "the other @xmath24 may be used to turn @xmath237 and @xmath238 into homogeneous coordinates parametrizing @xmath225 .",
    "the vacuum is thus @xmath225 .",
    "one may also determine the superpotential in this vacuum to show that we have a  theory fibered over this @xmath225 to obtain the familiar hybrid - type models of @xcite .",
    "one may also show that the fiber has a @xmath208-quotient singularity at the zero section .    in terms of the ambient toric variety @xmath243 , what we have just described in the previous paragraph is the @xmath225 that appears in the middle of the chain of three @xmath225 s on the right in figure [",
    "fig : z4b ] .",
    "thus although @xmath59 appears to have three degrees of freedom for the khler form  giving the three independent sizes of the three @xmath225 s , only one makes it down to @xmath8 , the critical point set of @xmath53 .",
    "therefore @xmath8 only has one khler - type deformation .",
    "sometimes additional modes appear in the fibre for these hybrid models but in this case the fibre contains no twist fields with the correct charges to be considered a ( 1,1)-form .",
    "we will therefore assert that @xmath244 .",
    "thus we are in agreement with the assertions concerning the mirror space at the start of this section .    analyzing the other possible triangulations we find that we reproduce one of the two phases we know about",
    " either the  orbifold in @xmath224 or the hybrid model over @xmath225 .",
    "the points @xmath245 and @xmath246 may be ignored when considering @xmath8 .",
    "thus we have constructed a model with a non - trivial phase diagram  there are 2 phases  but neither is a  space .    in general there is a homomorphism : @xmath247 in general however @xmath248 is neither injective nor surjective .",
    "the example in this section shows a failure of injectivity since @xmath249 and @xmath244 . in the more simple case of @xmath149 it was shown in @xcite that the kernel of @xmath248 was described by points in the interior of co - dimension one",
    "faces of the convex hull of @xmath81 . in the case described in this section",
    "we see that such a simple criterion can not be used  all the points @xmath219 lie in a co - dimension 7 face and yet @xmath245 and @xmath246 contribute to the kernel and @xmath250 survives through to @xmath251 . at this point in we know of no simple method of determining the image of @xmath248 except to explicitly calculate the critical point set of @xmath53 on a case by case basis .",
    "let us conclude this section by discussing the short - comings of analyzing this model in terms of the `` generalized  manifolds '' of @xcite .",
    "the @xmath208 singularity in @xmath179 generated by @xmath196 of ( [ eq : gz4 ] ) may be partially resolved by a line bundle over the weighted projective space @xmath252 .",
    "the resultant space has @xmath199 .",
    "the `` generalized  manifold '' , @xmath4 , would be identified as the hypersurface in this weighted projective space given by the vanishing of ( [ eq : wz4 ] ) with @xmath253 taken to be the quasi - homogeneous coordinates and @xmath254 .",
    "the @xmath208-action of @xmath201 acts on @xmath4 to induce @xmath208-quotient singularities over some subspace of codimension two .",
    "these latter singularities are not terminal and may be resolved without adding anything further to @xmath96 .",
    "in fact , resolving these latter singularities may be achieved by introducing the points @xmath219 into the toric fan .",
    "it is easy to see that something similar will happen in general .",
    "that is , any @xmath255 toric resolutions we may perform in @xmath59 may also be performed after blowing up any terminal singularities in @xmath59 .",
    "it follows that the points in the interior of the convex hull of @xmath81 may be counted by analyzing singularities which may be locally resolved with @xmath255 in @xmath4 .",
    "( note that this is a rather inefficient way of proceeding in our picture  one may as well just analyze the singularities in @xmath59 without any destroying the @xmath255 condition . )",
    "this observation sheds light on a conjecture in @xcite that @xmath11 could be determined by counting the contribution to @xmath256 of any resolutions of singularities within the @xmath4 .",
    "we see now that this will count @xmath257 which is , in general , not equal to @xmath11 .",
    "thus this conjecture is false . in the example above , counting this way would imply that @xmath258 .    with regards to determining @xmath11",
    ", it appears hard to save the construction of @xcite from a similar fate .",
    "the problem is that the divisors associated with @xmath245 , @xmath250 and @xmath246 appear on equal footing in @xmath4 .",
    "thus unless some unsymmetric rules are devised for resolving canonical singularities in superspace one can not obtain the correct answer @xmath244 .",
    "one might be led to suspect the following to be the general picture for the geometric interpretation of an @xmath27=2 superconformal field theory .",
    "either @xmath8 is a  space and the string is free to move within @xmath8 and there are no massless modes normal to @xmath8 , or @xmath8 is a space of dimension @xmath260 in which the string is free to move and there are massless modes governed by some superpotential normal to @xmath8 inside some bigger ambient space @xmath59 containing @xmath8 .",
    "we now show an example ( which also appeared in @xcite ) which is an exception to this .",
    "consider the following point set for @xmath261 : @xmath262 thus @xmath263 .",
    "one can also determine @xmath121 with a little effort and find @xmath264 .",
    "thus @xmath193 again .",
    "the superpotential @xmath53 may be written @xmath265 where the @xmath266 are generic homogeneous polynomials of total degree two in @xmath267 .",
    "there are two triangulations of the point set @xmath81 .",
    "the first consists of taking 8 simplices each of which has @xmath268 as 4 of its vertices with the other 7 vertices taken from the set @xmath269 . in terms of @xmath106",
    "this amounts to removing the point @xmath270 from consideration . restricting to the critical point set of @xmath53 forces @xmath271 and @xmath272 . dividing out by the single required @xmath24-action forms @xmath273 with homogeneous coordinates @xmath267 .",
    "thus @xmath8 is the intersection of 4 quadric equations @xmath274 in @xmath273 .",
    "this is a known  space dating back to @xcite .",
    "the other triangulation consists of 4 simplices with 8 vertices given by @xmath275 with the other 3 taken from the set @xmath276 .",
    "this amounts to removing @xmath271 from consideration . restricting to the critical point set of @xmath53 forces @xmath270 .",
    "now the @xmath24-action may be used to form @xmath277 with homogeneous coordinates @xmath278 .",
    "thus @xmath8 in this phase is @xmath277 .",
    "our phase diagram consists of two phases  both of which have the dimension of @xmath8 equal to @xmath7 .",
    "one phase is a  manifold with @xmath203 and @xmath279 which we understand .",
    "the other phase is @xmath277 .",
    "the reader might be alarmed at the appearance of the latter since @xmath277 is not a  space and lacks a nonvanishing holomorphic 3-form for example .",
    "the resolution is as follows .",
    "although we have correctly identified the vacuum of the field theory as @xmath8 we have to be a little careful in declaring it to be the effective target space of a conformal field theory .",
    "let us consider the variables @xmath275 which we forced to zero .",
    "the superpotential is quadratic in these variables so we certainly havent missed any massless degrees of freedom ( which would only add to our troubles by increasing @xmath7 anyway ) .",
    "the point is that there is actually a @xmath210-quotient singularity coming from the identification of homogeneous coordinates in @xmath59 to affine ones .",
    "thus we have a fibration of a  orbifold theory over @xmath277 which may appear trivial in that the superpotential is quadratic but we may expect twist fields is add to our spectrum . in particular we expect to have an analog to a calabi - yau @xmath280 mode ( i.e. a field of charge ( 3,0 ) under the @xmath281 of the superconformal algebra ) coming from such twisted sectors .",
    "of course , such a mode can not be given a literal geometric interpretation in terms of a ( 3,0)-form .",
    "it is interesting also to ask how literally we can take this @xmath277 to be a target space for the conformal field theory . to find the actual size of truly conformally invariant  target space one needs to solve the picard - fuchs system as described in @xcite .",
    "we will not present the details here since they are rather lengthy but we may quickly summarize as follows .",
    "one solves equations ( 42 ) of @xcite where the `` @xmath202 '' vector of this system is set equal to @xmath282 .",
    "( one could then count rational curves on this  space if one so desired . )",
    "the complexified khler form @xmath283 of the phase can then be analytically continued into @xmath277 phase ( which is most easily done by the method of @xcite ) .",
    "taking @xmath284 to be the local coordinate on the moduli space where @xmath285 corresponds to the limit point in the @xmath277 phase we obtain @xmath286 thus @xmath287 in the region near the limit point @xmath288 .",
    "the effective size of target space is very small as @xmath289 .",
    "in other words , the effect of integrating out the massive modes in the linear  of @xcite has caused an infinite renormalization of the `` @xmath30 '' parameter ( unlike what is believed to happen for the  phase ) .",
    "to summarize we see that the phase picture can produce phases with dimension equal to @xmath7 which do not correspond to  non - linear s. to understand these phases more completely will require a better understanding of the hybrid models .",
    "geometrical methods have proven themselves to be a powerful conceptual and calculational tool in understanding the physical content of certain conformal theories and their associated string models . as such",
    ", it is a worthwhile task to gain as complete an understanding as possible of the geometrical status of conformal field theories , especially for the case of @xmath0 worldsheet supersymmetry relevant for spacetime supersymmetric string models .",
    "the phase structure of such @xmath0 models , as found in @xcite , goes a long way towards capturing the full geometric content of these theories , and , in particular , certainly provides the correct framework for discussing mirror symmetry . in this paper",
    "we have used this phase structure analysis to address certain previously puzzling issues regarding the geometrical content of certain theories . in particular , at first sight mirror symmetry seems to come upon the puzzle regarding the identity of the mirror of a rigid manifold .",
    "we have seen , though , that this appears to be a puzzle only because the question itself is not phrased in the correct context .",
    "that is , mirror symmetry tells us that certain _ a priori _ distinct pairs of families of conformal theories actually are composed of isomorphic members . when the phase structure of each family in such a pair contains a calabi - yau  region , then these calabi - yau s form a mirror pair .",
    "however , in certain cases , at least one of the families does _ not _ have a calabi - yau  region .",
    "in such cases mirror symmetry will simply not yield a mirror pair of calabi - yau manifolds . a family which has a rigid calabi - yau phase , as we have seen , provides one such example  the mirror family does not have a calabi - yau region .",
    "thus the absence of a khler form for the mirror is not an issue .",
    "the mirror moduli space has no calabi - yau phase and hence does not require a khler form .",
    "the previous puzzle disappears , therefore , when the question is phrased in the correct context .    beyond the rigid case",
    ", we have also seen that even when there is a conformal mode that can play the part of a khler form , there need not be a calabi - yau phase on which it can realize this potential .",
    "so , whereas in the previous problem we resolved the issue of a `` calabi - yau in search of a khler form '' here we have `` a khler form in search of a calabi - yau '' .",
    "we have established that there are examples in which there simply is no calabi - yau to be found .",
    "it is worth noting that the map @xmath248 in ( [ eq : kappa ] ) is neither injective or surjective .",
    "we saw the effect on this map not being injective in section [ ss : h1 ] .",
    "the failure of surjectivity shows that some ( 1,1)-forms on @xmath8 do not come from the toric ambient space @xmath59 . in the case of models of the form discussed in section [ ss : hyp ]",
    "it is still possible to count the number @xmath11 because of the properties of hypersurfaces @xcite . in the cases considered here",
    "however we deal with more general complete intersections .",
    "the problem of counting @xmath11 in this context is the mirror of the problem of counting @xmath215 for the mirror model .",
    "the analogue of the fact that @xmath248 is not an isomorphism is the fact that deforming the polynomial giving the superpotential is not the same as deformation the complex structure",
    ". it would be interesting to see if methods along the lines of @xcite could be applied in this context to determine the hodge numbers of @xmath8 .",
    "an interesting question , to which we do not know the answer , is whether there are examples in which _ neither _ family in a mirror pair has a calabi - yau region .",
    "such an example would establish that there are @xmath6 conformal theories which are not interpretable in terms of calabi - yau compactifications ( or analytic continuations thereof ) . to answer",
    "this question is difficult because of the failure of the surjectivity of @xmath248 .",
    "one may find mirror pairs of orbifolds of the gepner model , @xmath177 , for which neither has an obvious  interpretation .",
    "an example with @xmath256 and @xmath215 equal to 4 and 40 was mentioned in @xcite .",
    "this is a good candidate for a situation where neither of the mirror partners have a  phase ( despite the assertions of @xcite ) .",
    "unfortunately if @xmath8 is the model with @xmath290 then the image of @xmath248 is trivial , i.e. , none of the ( 1,1)-forms come from @xmath59 . because of this the methods of this paper can not be used to draw any conclusions regarding the lack of  phase for this example .",
    "it is a pleasure to thank d. morrison and r. plesser for useful conversations .",
    "the work of p.s.a . is supported by a grant from the national science foundation .",
    "the work of b.r.g . is supported by a national young investigator award , the alfred p. sloan foundation and the national science foundation .",
    "the mirror of the example of section [ ss : p3 ] was studied in @xcite where it was discovered that there is an extra @xmath210 symmetry in the moduli space .",
    "this should act on the moduli space in section [ ss : p3 ] to identify the two phases with each other .",
    "this may be viewed as a new kind of @xmath291 symmetry ."
