    "the single - site dynamical mean field theory ( dmft ) approach has been extensively employed to explore the properties of the hubbard model and , in general , of strongly correlated materials  @xcite . though the metal - mott insulator transition can be successfully accounted for within the dmft approximation where dynamical fluctuations alone are emphasized , interesting physical phenomena such as spin density waves and superconductivity can not be properly described due to the absence of spatial fluctuations .",
    "cluster - extensions of dmft like cellular - dynamical mean field theory ( cdmft )  @xcite and dynamical cluster approximation ( dca )  @xcite can take into account the inter - site spatial fluctuations within the size of the cluster in addition to the dynamical fluctuations .",
    "for example , cluster extensions of dmft with 4-site clusters in combination with continuous time quantum monte carlo ( ct - qmc ) or exact diagonalization ( ed ) can partly capture the physics of fermi liquid ( fl ) , non - fl ( or pseudo gap ) , mott insulator , and superconductivity on an equal footing  @xcite .",
    "however , due to the computational expense of ct - qmc and ed , the system size is still limited to only small clusters and not all physical properties can be equally precisely studied . in particular , the hybridization expansion ct - qmc approach is able to treat small cluster sizes up to only @xmath1 due to an exponential increase of the local hilbert space with @xmath2  @xcite .",
    "the ed approach encounters a similar problem .",
    "even though other impurity solvers like the interaction expansion ct - qmc approach are applicable to large cluster systems , the computational expense is proportional to the square of three quantities : the interaction strength @xmath3 , the inverse of the temperature @xmath4 , and the number of cluster sites @xmath2  @xcite .",
    "the hirsch - fye qmc ( hf - qmc )  @xcite impurity solver shows a computational expense proportional to @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the number of slices in the imaginary time ( temperature ) .",
    "more recently , khatami _ et al . _",
    "@xcite proposed the determinantal qmc ( dqmc )  @xcite as a new impurity solver where the computational expense has a @xmath7 dependence with @xmath8 being the number of bath sites connected to each cluster site .",
    "this is though a hamiltonian - based impurity solver that requires an explicit form of a cluster anderson impurity model to calculate the self - energy .",
    "in contrast ,",
    "ct - qmc , hirsch - fye qmc and the method under discussion in the present work , the semiclassical approximation ( sca ) , are action - based impurity solvers . summarizing and in view of the above , a fast and reliable impurity solver for dmft calculations and its cluster extensions with large cluster sizes is still highly desirable .    the sca has been proposed as an impurity solver for dmft and its cluster extensions  @xcite .",
    "( i ) this impurity solver is fast since the computational expense depends only on calculation time at each matsubara frequency of the inverse of a matrix with dimensions @xmath9 ( for a cluster with @xmath2 sites ) or @xmath10 ( for a single site with @xmath11 orbitals ) , where @xmath11 is the number of orbitals .",
    "( ii ) while it can not properly account for fermi - liquid behavior in the weak - coupling limit  @xcite , and in general , it is not adequate at low temperatures due to the freezing of quantum fluctuations in the method , it is especially suited for large interaction strength and multi - sites where for example the powerful interaction expansion ct - qmc method is very costly .",
    "( iii ) it provides self - energy information directly on the real frequency axis .",
    "this avoids the uncertainty from analytic continuation which has to be done in various qmc approaches  @xcite .",
    "the previously used sca approach  @xcite was limited though to consider small cluster sizes of @xmath1 due to the difficulty of the multi - dimensional integrations .    in the present work ,",
    "we propose to combine the sca approach with the monte carlo ( mc ) method .",
    "the latter is used to evaluate the multi - dimensional integrals .",
    "we apply our scheme to two test cases : ( i ) the one - orbital hubbard model on the square lattice at half - filling within the dca with cluster sizes @xmath1 and @xmath12 and ( ii ) the anisotropic two - orbital hubbard model with different band widths on the bethe lattice at half - filling within single - site dmft .",
    "we present the density of states , momentum dependent spectral functions , and momentum dependent self - energy as a function of real frequency @xmath13 . for case ( i )",
    "we find that even though the fermi liquid behavior is not obtained  @xcite , the critical onsite coulomb interaction @xmath0 for the metal - insulator transition calculated by our sca approach for both cluster sizes shows a reasonable agreement with the value obtained from ct - qmc which should be numerically exact .",
    "in particular , we find that the behavior of the density of states at the fermi level in each momentum sector obtained from both sca and ct - qmc approaches are quantitatively consistent with each other .",
    "for case ( ii ) we also find a reasonable agreement of @xmath0 obtained from sca and hf - qmc .",
    "the orbital - selective phase transition is also correctly detected .",

    "<S> we propose that a combination of the semiclassical approximation with monte carlo simulations can be an efficient and reliable impurity solver for dynamical mean field theory equations and their cluster extensions with large cluster sizes . in order to show the reliability of the method , we consider two test cases : ( i ) the single - band hubbard model within the dynamical cluster approximation with 4- and 8-site clusters and ( ii ) the anisotropic two - orbital hubbard model with orbitals of different band width within the single - site dynamical mean field theory . we compare the critical interaction @xmath0 with those obtained from solving the dynamical mean field equations with continuous time and hirsch - fye quantum monte carlo . in both test cases </S>",
    "<S> we observe reasonable values of the metal - insulator critical interaction strength @xmath0 and the nature of mott physics in the self - energy behavior . </S>",
    "<S> while some details of the spectral functions can not be captured by the semiclassical approximation due to the freezing of dynamical fluctuations , the main features are reproduced by the approach . </S>"
