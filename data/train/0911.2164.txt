    "it is expected that quark matter plays a role .",
    "therefore it is interesting to study how this form of matter behaves in a strong magnetic field .",
    "two different regions in the qcd phase diagram are of relevance here .",
    "heavy - ion collisions probe the low chemical potential and high temperature regime , for neutron stars it is the other way around . in this paper",
    "the effect of very strong magnetic fields will be investigated in both regimes .",
    "much work has been done on how an external magnetic field changes nuclear matter , for a review see ref .",
    "the behavior of ordinary quark matter has been studied using the nambu - jona - lasinio ( njl ) model , see for example refs .",
    "@xcite and recently also in the linear sigma model coupled to quarks @xcite .",
    "most studies investigate the one and two flavor cases , but recently also the three - flavor case has been investigated @xcite . at high quark chemical potential , it is believed that the ground state is a color superconducting phase .",
    "the effects of an external magnetic field on such a phase are discussed in refs .",
    "here color superconductivity will not be considered .    in this paper",
    "we study the chiral symmetry restoring phase transition , which is strongly influenced by an external magnetic field . from studies in the njl model",
    "it is known that a magnetic field enhances the chiral symmetry breaking  @xcite , this is related to the phenomenon of magnetic catalysis of chiral symmetry breaking , introduced in refs .",

    "model instantons induce an extra interaction , the t hooft determinant interaction , which leads to a mixing between the different quark flavors . following the analysis of refs .",
    "@xcite , the strength of the instanton interaction is set by the dimensionless parameter @xmath5 .",

    "@xcite this case is studied in the chiral limit .",
    "it is observed that for a range of typical value for the coupling constant , phases with broken chiral symmetry and nonzero nuclear density arise .    in general there is a competition between the magnetic field , which tends to differentiate the constituent quark masses for different flavors , and the instanton interaction which favors equal constituent quark masses . in this work",
    "this competition is studied .",
    "apart from studying the ground state as function of magnetic field and chemical potential for various characteristic values of @xmath5 , we also look at the local minima of the effective potential and the corresponding occupation of landau levels .",
    "it is found that in the neighborhood of the chiral phase transition the phase diagram develops metastable phases , differing in the number of filled landau levels .",
    "some of these local minima become the global one upon increasing the magnetic field or chemical potential , but not all of them do .",
    "these phases can have rather different values for the constituent quark masses , in other words , display significantly different amounts of chiral symmetry breaking . unlike in the case of @xmath8 which is isospin symmetric , in these phases",
    "the values of the two constituent quark masses can be very distinct , which corresponds to large isospin violation .",
    "furthermore , we find that for a realistic choice of parameters , appearance of phases of broken chiral symmetry and nonzero nuclear density requires not too large instanton interaction strength , i.e.   @xmath9 .",
    "as mentioned , we also investigate the role of nonzero temperature at zero chemical potential , which is of relevance for heavy - ion collisions . without magnetic field the chiral symmetry restoring phase transition at finite temperature is a crossover . in the linear sigma model coupled to quarks",

    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "first we derive the effective potential of the njl model in the mean - field approximation in a magnetic background .",
    "then we discuss the phase diagram as a function of chemical potential , concentrating on the phase with nonzero nuclear density and chiral symmetry breaking .",
    "we continue with discussing the temperature dependence and end with conclusions .",

    "note that this interaction is flavor mixing . in the literature @xmath16 and @xmath17 are often taken equal , which means that the low energy spectrum consists of @xmath18 and @xmath19 fields only , but here we will allow them to be different",
    ". we will restrict to the two flavor case , using @xmath20 with @xmath21 as generators of u(2 ) .",

    ". the instanton interaction breaks it to su(3)@xmath25su(2)@xmath26su(2)@xmath27u(1)@xmath28 . for nonzero , but equal quark masses this symmetry is reduced to su(3)@xmath25su(2)@xmath29u(1)@xmath28 .",

    "the effective potential has to be minimized . in this section",
    "the effective potential is calculated in the mean - field approximation .",

    "are `` linearized '' in the presence of the @xmath40 and @xmath41 condensates ( this is equivalent to the procedure with a hubbard - stratonovich transformation used in ref .",
    "@xcite ) @xmath42 leading to @xmath43 where @xmath44 and @xmath45    now the lagrangian is quadratic in the quark fields , so we can integrate over them . after going to imaginary time ,",
    "this results in the following effective potential in the mean - field approximation  @xcite @xmath46,\\ ] ] where we have introduced the constituent quark masses @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "as we have mentioned earlier , often @xmath16 is taken equal to @xmath17 , which is the case @xmath7 .",
    "this choice implies that @xmath49 is then always equal to 0 , i.e. , the constituent quark masses are equal .",

    "hence , the conclusion is that @xmath52 and @xmath5 can be any value .",

    "the ratio @xmath55 can simply not be determined if @xmath51 .",
    "since magnetic fields affect the two flavors differently because of the difference in charge , isospin breaking effects are expected and it is unnatural to choose @xmath51 from the start or to take @xmath8 . using the strange quark condensate it was argued in ref .",

    "the role of temperature was studied at zero chemical potential . in ref .  @xcite it was found in the linear sigma model coupled to quarks that a strong magnetic field changes the usual crossover as a function of temperature into a first order transition . in the njl model",
    "it was found that the crossover remains a crossover .",
    "also it was found that including higher landau levels in the calculation of the effective potential changes the details of the crossover , it becomes sharper , albeit the qualitative aspects of the transition are not changed .",
    "the difference between the two models is important , as the first order transition allows for metastable phases , while a crossover does not .",
