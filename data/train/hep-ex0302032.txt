    "the clas detector @xcite is unique in design to accomodate these requirements and to perform a very broad spectrum of physics measurements .",
    "the themes of the hall b scientific program are the precision study of the structure of the nucleon and the nature of the strong interaction .",
    "experiments aim to clarify the interplay between hadronic and partonic degrees of freedom and the effectiveness of the traditional nucleon - nucleon theories or qcd inspired models .",
    "+ this scientific program can be summarized in the following main topics :    * _ baryon resonances _ * _ spin structure functions in the resonance region _ * _ nucleon tomography _ * _ dynamics of the strong interactions _",
    "the study of the baryon spectrum is a fundamental part of the scientific program in hall b. the so - called @xmath1 program is concerned with the electromagnetic production of exclusive hadronic final states , with the purpose of extracting information on excited baryon states that will reveal underlying symmetries and internal dynamics .",
    "a lot of progress has been made in the framework of quark models to provide a consistent picture of all resonant states in terms of three constituent , massive quarks .",
    "various recipes have been introduced to account for relativity and to reproduce form factors @xcite , while other models rely on a different treatment of the basic degrees of freedom and the potential @xcite .",
    "it is the goal of the clas experimental project to provide accurate data to test these different quark - model approaches to nucleon structure .    in the following",
    ", i will show some selected issues in the @xmath1 program both in single pion electroproduction , suitable for investigating the first and second resonance regions , and multiple pion electroproduction .",
    "an interesting aspect of nucleon structure at low energies is a possible quadrupole deformation of the nucleon and the @xmath2 . within su(6 ) models , the @xmath3 transition is mediated by a single quark spin flip , leading to @xmath4 dominance and @xmath5=@xmath6= 0 .",
    "non - zero values for @xmath5 would indicate the quadrupole deformation .",
    "such deformation may dynamically arise through the interaction of the photon with the pion cloud @xcite or through the one - gluon exchange mechanism @xcite .",
    "finally , quark helicity conservation in perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) requires @xmath5=@xmath4 as @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "determination of the ratios @xmath8 and @xmath9 has been the aim of a considerable number of experiments in the past , but they suffered from large systematic and statistical errors , as well as a limited kinematic coverage .",
    "clas , with its nearly full coverage in azimuthal and polar angles , allows the extraction of the multipoles with greater accuracy than in the past .",
    "results of the multipole analysis of the clas data @xcite for the reaction @xmath10 are shown in fig.1 , where data from previous experiments published after 1990 are included as well @xcite .",
    "as one can see @xmath11 remains negative and small throughout the @xmath12 range .",
    "there are no indications that leading pqcd contributions are important .",
    "the ratio @xmath13 also remains negative , but its magnitude is strongly rising with @xmath12 .",
    "the comparison with microscopic models , relativized quark models @xcite , chiral quark soliton model @xcite , dynamical models @xcite shows that the simultaneous description of both @xmath11 an @xmath13 is achieved by dynamical models that include the nucleon pion cloud .     and",

    "model dependencies in the analysis are largely due to the poor knowledge of the non - resonant terms , which become increasingly important at higher @xmath12 .",
    "unfortunately , cross section measurements alone are unable to separate the @xmath2 from the non - resonant background .",
    "polarization observables , on the other hand , can access directly the interference between these processes .",
    "the differential cross section for @xmath15 with a longitudinally polarized electron beam and an unpolarized target , depends on the transverse @xmath16 and longitudinal @xmath17 polarization of the virtual photon and five structure functions : @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",

    "qcd mixing effects could decouple many of these states from the pion - nucleon channel @xcite , with a consequent lack of evidence in elastic @xmath27 scattering , while strongly coupling them to two - pion channels such as @xmath28 @xcite .",
    "however , other models such as the quark cluster model @xcite predict fewer states than the symmetric model , which is more in accordance with experimental observations .",
    "the search for some of these states is therefore crucial for discriminating between alternative descriptions of baryon structure .",
    "the new clas total cross section electroproduction data @xcite for the reaction @xmath29 are shown in fig . 3 in comparison with photoproduction data from desy @xcite .",
    "the most striking feature is the strong resonance peak near the invariant mass w=1.72 gev which is seen here for the first time but is absent in photoproduction data . analyzing the complete hadronic angular distributions and @xmath30 and",
    "@xmath31 mass distributions over the full w range , has shown that the peak near 1.72 gev is best described by a @xmath32 state .",
    "although there exists a state with such quantum numbers in this mass range , its hadronic properties were previously found to be very different from the resonance seen in the clas data .",
    "therefore , this state could be one of the `` missing '' states .",
    "in fact , capstick and roberts @xcite predict a second @xmath26 state at a mass 1.87 gev and capstick and page @xcite predict a hybrid baryon state with these quantum numbers at about the same mass .",
    "mass predictions of these models are uncertain by at least @xmath33 mev , and therefore are not inconsistent with the observed state at 1.72 gev .",
    "independent of possible interpretations , the hadronic properties of the state seen in the clas data appear incompatible with the known states listed in the review of particle properties @xcite and deduced from @xmath34 final states in @xmath27 scattering .",
    "the nucleon spin structure functions , @xmath35 and @xmath36 , in the deep - inelastic scattering ( dis ) region have been widely investigated , both experimentally and theoretically , since the results of the emc experiment @xcite performed at cern found that the quark spins contribute little to the nucleon spin . actually ,",
    "much of the recent work has focused on measuring the fundamental bjorken sum rule @xcite : @xmath37dx } = \\frac{1}{6}g_a\\ ] ] where @xmath38 is the spin structure function for the proton ( neutron ) , @xmath39 is axial coupling constant , and the integration is taken over the full range of _ x _ bjorken ( _ @xmath40 _ ) .",
    "eq.1 only holds true at infinite .",
    "however , it has been evolved to the finite @xmath12 using pqcd and this agrees with experiment to within @xmath41 .    at low energies",
    "the validity of pqcd comes into question , and there is no way to predict or calculate accurately the spin structure functions without directly measuring them .",
    "experiments at very low @xmath12 can use the gerasimov - drell - hearn ( gdh ) sum rule @xcite ( eq.2 ) as a guide to study the evolution of the nucleon spin structure functions : @xmath42\\frac{d\\nu}{\\nu } = - \\frac{2\\pi^2\\alpha}{m^2}{\\kappa^2}\\ ] ] the gdh sum rule relates the difference in polarized cross section @xmath43 , for the scattering of real photons , to the target s anomalous magnetic moment @xmath44 , mass m , and the electromagnetic coupling constant @xmath45 .",
    "this sum rule has been studied for photon energies up to 2.5 gev @xcite and in this limited energy range deviates from the theoretical asymptotic values by less than @xmath46 .",
    "recently ji and osborn @xcite extended the sum rule by linking the integral to the spin - dependent virtual compton amplitude . their work unified the two fundamental sum rules : the bjorken sum rule in the dis regime and the gdh sum rule at the real photon point .",
    "a measurement of the @xmath12-dependence allows test of the gdh sum rule evolution and chiral perturbation theory at low @xmath12 and sheds light on the question at what distance scale pqcd corrections and the qcd twist expansion will break down , and where the physics of confinement will dominate .",
    "it will also allow one to evaluate where resonances give important contributions to the first moment of @xmath47 @xcite .",
    "the spin structure functions experimental program at clas is focused just on the moderate @xmath12 regime and in the domain of nucleon resonances .",
    "the first round of experiments has been completed on polarized hydrogen ( @xmath48 ) and deuterium ( @xmath49 ) . in the following",
    "i will show the results obtained for the inclusive spin structure functions of deuteron .",
    "results from a new measurement of spin structure functions of the deuteron for moderate momentum transfer ( @xmath50 ) and final hadronic state mass in the nucleon resonance region ( @xmath51 ) have been obtained at clas with a 2.5 gev polarized electron beam @xcite .",
    "the spin structure function @xmath52 was extracted from the photon asymmetry measurement for four different bins in @xmath12 and then the integrals @xmath53 = @xmath54 were calculated .",
    "results are shown in fig .",
    "4 together with theoretical predictions and the only experimental data @xcite available before clas .",
    "the solid line at higher @xmath12 is a fit to the world s data in the dis region .",
    "the dotted line indicates the slope for the integral at @xmath55 predicted using the gdh sum rule .",
    "the short - dashed line is the result from a calculation that takes into account the contribution from the nucleon resonances only ( code ao ) @xcite .",
    "the long - dashed line @xcite is the ao result plus a term that depends smoothly on @xmath12 and interpolates between the resonances and the gdh limit at @xmath55 .",
    "fig.4 also shows the prediction from the model by soffer and teryaev @xcite(dot - dashed line ) .",
    "the solid triangle are the clas eg1 data alone while the open triangles include the estimated contribution to the integral from beyond our kinematics limits .",
    "the inner error bars are statistical and the outer error bars represent the systematic errors added in quadrature .    the first conclusion one can draw from fig .",
    "4 is that the integral over the measured region is in rather good agreement with the prediction of the ao parametrization for the resonance contribution only .",
    "therefore , the non - resonant piece must contribute relatively little to the integral over the resonace region in the case of the deuteron ( perhaps due to a partial cancellation between the asymmentry of the proton and the neutron ) .    in general",
    ", one can say that the integral over @xmath52 follows the expected trend , rising towards the dis limit at the highest measured @xmath12 while dropping rapidly below 0 towards the lowest @xmath12 point .",
    "clearly , neither the kinematic range reach nor the statistical precision of the present data set allows a definite statement about the validity of the gdh sum rule limit .",
    "however , new clas data with improved statistical precision and kinematic coverage will better constrain the theoretical predictions .",
    "results on the integral @xmath56 for the proton , neutron and the proton - neutron difference will be soon available .     of the deuteron ( per nucleon).,width=283,height=321 ]",
    "much of our current knowledge of the nucleon comes from inclusive electron scattering experiments that measure elastic form factors and longitudinal parton densities . however , elastic scattering and deeply inelastic scattering give two orthogonal one - dimensional projections of the proton .",
    "the former measures the probability of finding a proton with a transverse size matching the resolution of the probe , while the latter probes the quark s longitudinal momentum distribution , but has no sensitivity to the transverse dimension .",
    "the information resulting from these two types of experiments is disconnected , and does not allow one to construct the image of a real 3-dimensional proton .",
    "semi - exclusive measurements , in which one hadron is observed in addition to the scattered electron , are needed to study the flavour structure of the nucleon and only fully exclusive processes in which all final products are reconstructed can unravel the complete internal dynamics .    the theoretical framework for the interpretation of these new class of experiments",
    "is given by the formalism of generalized parton distributions ( gpds ) @xcite which give information on quark - quark correlations , transverse quark momentum distributions and contributions of correlated quark - antiquark pairs ( mesons ) to the nucleon wave function .",
    "the basis for this approch are the `` handbag '' diagrams shown in fig .",
    "5 . in fact",
    ", it has been shown that in the bjorken scaling regime , the scattering amplitude for exclusive processes can be factorized into a hard - scattering part ( exactly calculable in perturbative qcd ) and a nucleon structure part , the lower blob of the diagrams , parametrized via gpds .",
    "in addition to the dependence on the parton momentum fraction _ x _ , gpds depend on two more parameters , the skewedness _",
    "@xmath57 _ ( which in the bjorken regime is related to the momentum imbalance between the struck quark and the quark that is put back into the final state baryon ) and the momentum transfer _ t _ to the baryonic system .",
    "the complete extraction of the spin - dependent and spin - independent gpds requires an extensive program involving measurements of a variety of channels and observables over a broad kinematic range .          the simplest process that can be described in terms of gpds is deeply virtual compton scattering .",
    "in fact while exclusive meson production requires high energies and high photon virtualities to reach the bjorken regime , dvcs may access the gpds already at @xmath12 as low as @xmath58 @xcite .",
    "+ one of the first experimental observation of dvcs has been obtained from the recent analysis of clas data with a 4.2 gev polarized electron beam in a kinematical regime near @xmath59 and @xmath60 @xcite .",

    "the bh contribution in the cross section is several times larger than dvcs contribution , but this can be turned into an advantage by using a longitudinally polarized electron beam .",
    "in fact one can measure the helicity - dependent interference term that is proportional to the imaginary part of the dvcs amplitude . in this case the pure real bh contribution is subtracted out in the cross section difference .    for this analysis",
    ", electron and proton were both detected in the clas detector , the reaction @xmath61 was studied and the number of single photon final states was extracted by fitting the missing mass @xmath62 distributions .",
    "the beam spin asymmetry ( bsa ) was then calculated as : @xmath63 where @xmath64 is the beam polarization and @xmath65 is the extracted number of @xmath66 events at positive ( negative ) beam helicity .",

    "one of the primary goal of nuclear physics is the study of the interplay between hadronic and partonic degrees of freedom , and of the effectiveness of traditional nucleon - nucleon theories or qcd inspired models in describing the data . in this respect deuteron photodisintegration and photoproduction of light vector mesons at high momentum transfer _ t",
    "_ are two suitable reactions to study .",
    "deuteron photodisintegration is well suited for studying nuclear reactions in the intermediate energy regime where neither the traditional meson exchange models nor pqcd describe the data well .    at high incident photon energy and intermediate angles ,",
    "conventionally @xmath71 , the @xmath72 differential cross section is well - described by the constituents counting rules ( ccr ) @xcite : @xmath73 where @xmath74 is the minimum number of microscopic fields involved in the reaction , @xmath75 is the square of the total energy , and @xmath76 is the proton scattering angle . in this case ,",

    "therefore , observed scaling in the cross section can not be taken as a stringent test that the perturbative regime as been reached .",
    "in fact , traditional models based on meson exchange current , are also able to reproduce this scaling law for @xmath85 @xcite .    in this context",
    "the use of non - perturbative qcd calculations to describe the deuteron photodisintegration process appears more suitable .",
    "this is done by the so - called quark gluon string model ( qgsm ) @xcite .",
    "the reaction @xmath86 is described by the exchange of three valence quarks in the @xmath87-channel plus any number of gluons .",
    "this corresponds to the formation and break - up of a quark - gluon string in the intermediate state , leading to the factorization of the amplitudes .",
    "such a string can also be identified with the nucleon regge trajectory since the qgsm can be considered as a microscopic model for the regge phenomenology , and can be used for the calculation of different quantities that have been considered before only at a phenomenological level @xcite .",
    "open questions include at what momentum transfer does one reach the perturbative regime , which is the most convenient description in the transition region , and where the conventional picture of the deuteron in terms of nucleons and mesons fail , and partons start to come into play .    the clas data on the complete angular distributions for the outgoing proton ( @xmath88 ) and for photon energies between 0.5 and 3.0 gev contribute significantly to answering these questions .",
    "differential cross sections @xmath89 are reported in fig.8 as a function of the proton angle in the cm frame , for fixed photon energy above 0.9 gev and up to 2.45 gev .",
    "the present preliminary results @xcite , obtained from the analysis of about @xmath90 of the accumulated statistics ( and with an additional cut @xmath91 ) show a persistent forward - backward asymmetry .",

    "this corresponds to the vector meson dominance model ( vdm ) , and the cross section depends only on the size of the meson and the target . at high t , hard processes are expected to take over and the production is thus more sensitive to quark and gluon exchange mechanisms .",
    "clas experiments have measured the _ t _ dependence of the photoproduction of @xmath92 , @xmath93 and @xmath67 on the proton up to values of _ t _ around 5 @xmath94 where scarce data were available for @xmath92 and @xmath93 and no data existed for @xmath67 production for @xmath95 .    the results are shown in fig .",

    "the cross section is well described as a purely diffractive process in the framework of the traditional vdm , or in a modern way as the exchange of the pomeron trajectory in the _ t _ channel @xcite . at larger _",
    "t _ , the small impact parameter makes it possible for a quark in the vector meson and a quark in the proton to come close enough to exchange two gluons which do not have enough time to reinteract to form a pomeron",
    ". large momentum transfer also select configurations in which the transverse distances between the two quarks in the vector meson and the three quarks in the proton are small . in that case , each gluon can couple to different quarks of the vector meson , as well as to different quarks of the proton . because of the dominant _ @xmath97 _ component of the @xmath67 , and to the extent that the strangeness component of the nucleon is small , in @xmath67 photoproduction the exchange of quarks is strongly suppressed .",
