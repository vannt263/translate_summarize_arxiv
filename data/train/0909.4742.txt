    "the search for physics beyond the standard model has been a long endeavor in particle physics .",
    "our hope is now on the large hadron collider ( lhc ) experiment which is supposed to start getting physics data next year , in 2010 .",
    "if there is a new physics up to @xmath0  tev , such as predicted by most supersymmetric models , the lhc should be able to see it . to discover the new physics",
    ", however , it might not be sufficient to have a great machine and a huge amount of data , but we also need a correct theoretical interpretation to analyse the data .",
    "it is well known that the phenomenology of supersymmetry depends on its spectrum , therefore it is necessary to study all possible cases .",
    "the most studied scenario is with a neutralino as the lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) .",
    "neutralino lsp is popular due to its possibility as the dark matter particle , provided that it is stable due to some parity conservation . nevertheless , neutralino is not the only dark matter candidate within supersymmetry .",
    "it has been shown that gravitino , as the lsp , is also a feasible candidate  @xcite . in this scenario ,",
    "the next to lightest supersymmetric particle ( nlsp ) is practically stable with respect to the collider detectors , while the gravitino itself is not detectable .",
    "the phenomenology , thus , depends on what the nlsp is .",
    "here we focus our attention onto one such scenario , i.e. with sneutrino as the nlsp . as a neutral particle , the sneutrino",
    "would be seen as missing energy , just like the neutralino . however , because of the different mass hierarchy , the cross sections and the signatures are , in general , different .",
    "the model that we study here is based on a supersymmetric model with non - universal higgs masses ( nuhm )  @xcite .",
    "the supersymmetric parameters in nuhm are the universal sfermion masses @xmath1 , gaugino masses @xmath2 , trilinear masses @xmath3 , all are set at the gut scale , the higgs vev ratio @xmath4 , the higgs mixing parameter @xmath5 and the cp odd higgs mass @xmath6 .",
    "we choose a model with @xmath7 for this set of parameters , the tau - sneutrino is the lightest non - gravitino supersymmetric particle  @xcite .",
    "this can be seen as a result of the non - universal terms , which collectively known as the @xmath8-term , in the rge .",
    "if @xmath8 is negative and large , such as in our case , the left - sleptons become lighter than the right - sleptons , and because of the split by the @xmath9-term the sneutrinos are lighter than the left - charged - sleptons . in this case , the tau - sneutrino is lighter than the electron / muon - sneutrino because of the yukawa term in the rge .",
    "the physical spectrum for the lighter supersymmetric particles ( or sparticles ) is shown in table  [ tab : a ] .",
    "the heavier sleptons are about 460 - 482  gev , the heavier gauginos are above 600  gev , and the squarks are above 1  tev , except for the lightest stop which is about 724  gev .",
    "note that a similar model , but within the gauge mediated framework , is also studied at a preliminary level in  @xcite .",
    ".the lightest part of the supersymmetric spectrum in our model .",
    "[ cols= \" < , < , > \" , ]     note that in our model , the sneutrinos are the partners of the left - handed neutrinos .",
    "left - sneutrino as dark matter is already excluded by direct dark matter detection experiments  @xcite . however , assuming that gravitino is lighter than the sneutrino and is the dark matter , this model is still allowed . for models including right - sneutrino effects in the rge",
    "see  @xcite .",
    "supersymmetric signatures at colliders come from the cascade decays of heavier sparticles down to the lightest stable sparticle . in our case , this is the sneutrino nlsp which appears as a large missing energy .",
    "the signatures can be classified as hadronic , pure leptonic or leptons plus jets .",
    "eventhough the hadronic signals are expected to be stronger for a hadron collider such as the lhc , the heavy squark masses somewhat suppress the signals as compared to the standard model qcd background .",
    "a detail study is needed to find a promising signal in this category . here",
    "we restrict ourselves to the pure leptonic signatures instead .",
    "these come from the productions and decays of sparticles without strong interaction , i.e. the neutralinos , charginos , and sleptons .",
    "since the neutralinos and charginos are relatively heavy , the trilepton signature through neutralino - chargino associated production , which could be prominent for the neutralino lsp scenario  @xcite , is suppressed in our model . on the other hand , the electron / muon - sneutrinos and the charged sleptons are relatively light .",
    "therefore the dominant leptonic signals come from the production of these particles . however , for hadron colliders , such as the lhc , slepton pair production rates are not high , only around 100  fb for a 14  tev lhc .",
    "thus , the problem is to find signals that are strong enough comparatively to the standard model ( sm ) backgrounds .",
    "the dominant sm backgrounds are from drell - yan , @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "we studied 2 , 3 , 4 and 5-lepton plus missing energy signals . in general",
    ", we need a very large integrated luminosity to get @xmath12 discovery .",
    "looking at the trilepton signals in more detail , the most dominant supersymmetric signal is from @xmath13 ( @xmath14 ) associated production , followed by @xmath15 and @xmath16 decays .",
    "for this channel we have two taus of the same sign and an electron or a muon of opposite sign as depicted in fig .  [ fig:1 ] .",
    "the event rates are @xmath17  fb for negatively charged and @xmath18  fb for positively charged electron / muon ( each ) , for a 14  tev lhc .",
    "this , in principle , has a small sm background , coming only from @xmath19 , as follows @xmath20 and similarly for the opposite signs .",
    "this background is of the order of @xmath21  fb . the supersymmetric background for this same sign taus signature is from neutralino - chargino ( @xmath22 ) , but only about two order of magnitude lower",
    ". the supersymmetric qcd background should be reducible by counting the jet multiplicity . imposing same - sign taus should also reduce the @xmath23 and fake leptons background .",

    "the difficulty is that tau decays very quickly such that it can not be identified directly in the detectors .",
    "instead , we have to rely on the reconstruction of tau from its decay products .",
    "tau decays either leptonically ( @xmath31% ) or hadronically ( @xmath32% ) .",
    "thus instead of two taus and an electron or a muon , we get a signal with 0 , 1 or 2 tau - jets ( denoted by @xmath33 ) . at this level ,",
    "other backgrounds get in , most importantly from @xmath34 which can produce electrons and/or muons either directly or through taus . to utilize the same sign signature we take a look at the 2 @xmath33 case , @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is either an electron or a muon .",
    "the @xmath34 background is through @xmath37 followed by the tau decays where the positively charged taus decay hadronically while the negatively charged tau decays leptonically .",
    "our preliminary results show that eventhough this background has a relatively large event rate , the signal can still be distinguishable from the background because the lepton from the tau decay is softer .",
    "for example , by looking at the invariant mass distributions . moreover ,",
    "note that the @xmath19 background is also reduced by the tau decay branching ratios along with the signal , and therefore does not impose a further problem .",
    "we have discussed , briefly , the phenomenology of a supersymmetric model with the tau - sneutrino as the effectively stable lightest sparticle at the lhc",
    ". a more complete and detailed analysis of this topic will appear in @xcite .",
    "the analysis of this model illustrates the complexity in discovering beyond the standard model particle physics ( bsm ) , i.e. not all models would be easily discovered ( or excluded ) at the lhc .",
    "a particular problem in our analysis is related to the fact that many taus are expected to appear in the signals due to the flavor of the lightest sneutrino .",
    "thus , it is important for our model that taus can be identified correctly .",
    "tau identification is often crucial for many bsms .",
    "lots of improvements , both on the experimental and the theoretical sides have been achieved on this issue  @xcite , so this should not be a big problem in the future .",
    "we are optimistic that technical difficulties , which cause delays at the lhc , could eventually be overcome , and we are hopeful that a new physics will be discovered in just a few years from now .",
