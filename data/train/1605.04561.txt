    "the purpose of this paper is to study solutions @xmath0 of special first order linear partial differential equations that appear in the analysis of dimishing urn models .",
    "in particular we follow the work of @xcite .",
    "more precisely , we consider a plya - eggenberger urn model with two kinds of balls and transition matrix @xmath1 .",
    "the process runs as follows .",
    "suppose that the urn contains @xmath2 balls of the first kind and @xmath3 balls of the second kind - we can interprete this state as the point @xmath4 on the integer lattice .",
    "then with probability @xmath5 we add @xmath6 balls of the first kind and @xmath7 balls of the second kind , whereas with probability @xmath8 we add @xmath9 balls of the first kind and @xmath10 balls of the second kind .",
    "( of course , adding a negative number of balls means taking away this number of balls . )",
    "an absorbing state @xmath11 is a subset @xmath12 , where the process stops when we arrive in @xmath11 . in what follows we will only consider ( special )",
    "dimishing urn - models , where the number of balls of the first kind eventually reaches zero , so that the @xmath13-axis @xmath14 is a natural absorbing state .",
    "suppose now that the process starts at @xmath15 with @xmath16 and let @xmath17 $ ] denote the probability generating function of the random variable @xmath18 that describes the position @xmath19 of the absorbing state in @xmath11 when the process starts at @xmath4 .    by definition the probability generating functions",
    "@xmath20 satisfy the recurrence @xmath21 for @xmath22 .",
    "the boundary values at an absorbing state @xmath23 is @xmath24 .    by setting @xmath25",
    "it follows that this generating function @xmath26 satisfies the partial differential equation @xmath27 with some inhomogeneous part @xmath28 that is given by the boundary values which are partly unknown ( for example @xmath29 , see @xcite .",
    "we want to mention that first order linear partial differential equations related to urn models were first systematically discussed by @xcite , see also @xcite , where a special case is detailly treated . on the other hand ,",
    "it is possible to describe the probabilistic behavior of the development of urn models very precisely , sse @xcite , even with absorbing states .",
    "nevertheless the analysis of dimishing urns with the @xmath13-axis as the absorbing state is still quite special . here",
    "we also refer to @xcite , where the analysis is based directly on the recurrence ( [ eqhrec ] ) .",
    "another interesting paper that is related to dimishing urn models and lines as absorbing states is @xcite .",
    "there the authors observe several different kinds of limiting behaviors ( with five phase changes ) .",
    "it turns out that there are some special cases , where it is more convenient to study the generating function @xmath30 that ( also ) satisfies a first order linear partial differential equation of the form @xmath31 with analytic functions @xmath32 .",
    "( in the examples below @xmath33 , and @xmath34 are polynomials . ) for these particular cases it turns out that the unknown boundary conditions are not needed since they cancel in the equation",
    ". nevertheless the methods that we are developing below are ",
    "although we do not work out the general case  suitable to deal with equations of the form ( [ eqpde0 ] ) .",
    "note that by definition @xmath35 furthermore , if @xmath36 then @xmath37 so that @xmath38 this means that @xmath39 is determined by @xmath40 in the present context it is convenient to assume that the function @xmath41 is a solution of the homogeneous differential equation @xmath42 so that @xmath43 and , thus , @xmath44    we first state the following three examples from @xcite ( that we present in a slightly modified way ) .",
    "the pill s problem ( see @xcite ) has transition matrix @xmath45 and absorbing state @xmath14 , and the corresponding differential equation is given by @xmath46 here it follows that @xmath20 is given by @xmath47 finally the corresponding random variable @xmath18 has limiting distribution @xmath48 where @xmath49 has density @xmath50 , @xmath51 , or @xmath52 where ( the beta distribution ) @xmath53 has density @xmath54 , @xmath55 .",
    "a variant of the pill s problem has transition matrix @xmath56 and absorbing state @xmath57 . due to the parity condition in @xmath2 ( that is , only even @xmath2 occur ) ,",
    "it is convenient to consider the generating function @xmath58 that satisfies the differential equation @xmath59 here we obtain an explicit solution of the form @xmath60 which leads to the limiting behavior : @xmath61 where @xmath62 has density @xmath63 , @xmath51 , or @xmath64     the cannibal urn ( see @xcite ) has transition matrix @xmath65 and absorbing state @xmath57 and the generating function @xmath66 satisfies the differential equation @xmath67 the solution is explicitly given by @xmath68 and we have a central limit theorem of the form @xmath69    these three examples show that although the linear differential equations look very similar the limiting behavior of the encoded random variable @xmath18 seems to be far from being universal .",
    "the main purpose of the present paper is to shed some light on this phenomenon .",
    "in particular we detect a sufficient condition that ensures a central limit theorem .",
    "[ th1 ] suppose that @xmath18 , @xmath70 , @xmath16 are non - negative discrete random variables with probabilty generating function @xmath71 $ ] such that the generating function @xmath72 , given by ( [ eqhdef ] ) satisfies a first order linear differential equation of the form ( [ eqpde ] ) , where the coefficient functions @xmath73 as well as the ratios @xmath74 , @xmath75 are analytic in an open set that contains @xmath76 with @xmath77 such that the ratio @xmath74 is negative for non - negative @xmath76 .",
    "furthermore we assume that ( [ eqcond1 ] ) is satisfied ( which also implies ( [ eqcond2 ] ) ) and that @xmath78 can be represented as @xmath79 where the functions @xmath80 are also in an open set that contains @xmath76 with @xmath77 . in particular in accordance with ( [ eqcond1 ] ) we have @xmath81 and @xmath82 .",
    "let @xmath83 be the solution of the differential equation @xmath84 with @xmath85 and let @xmath86 denote the function that satisfies @xmath87 .",
    "we further assume that the function @xmath88 is analytic in an open set that contains @xmath89 with @xmath77 and @xmath90 and non - decreasing for positive and real @xmath91 and @xmath92 ,    let @xmath93 and @xmath94 denote the solutions of the system of equations @xmath95 with @xmath96 and @xmath97 .",
    "furthermore set @xmath98 , @xmath99 and @xmath100 .",
    "if @xmath101$}\\ ] ] for some positive @xmath102 then @xmath18 satisfies a central limit theorem of the form @xmath103 uniformly for @xmath104 , @xmath105 $ ] , where @xmath106    this theorem does not provide a full answer to the problem .",
    "however , it is a first step that covers at least a part , where we obtain a central limit theorem . in future work we will provide a more complete picture , also covering the cases , where there is no central limit theorem .",
    "for example it is not clear whether it is possible to formulate conditions that refer directly to the entries of the transition matrix @xmath1 . in particular",
    "it is an open question whether it is possible to adapt theorem  [ th1 ] so that all cases of ( @xcite ) are covered .",
    "nevertheless , we will discuss the three examples ( from above ) and another one in the next section .",
    "we also present a ( short version of the ) proof of theorem  [ th1 ] in the remaining parts of the paper .",
    "we do not work out the details here but in * examples 1 * and * 2 * several conditions of theorem  [ th1 ] are not satisfied , in particular we have @xmath107 .",
    "the most interesting example is * example 3*. here we have @xmath108 , @xmath109 , and @xmath110 , that is @xmath111 and @xmath112 .",
    "it is easy to check that the conditions of theorem  [ th1 ] are satisfied .",
    "in particular it follows that @xmath113 , @xmath114 , and @xmath115 . from",
    "that we obtain @xmath116 . hence the functions @xmath117 and @xmath118 satisfy the system of equations @xmath119 from which we obtain ( by implicit differentiation )",
    "@xmath120 thus , the central limit theorem follows automatically .",
    "we add a new example in order to demonstrate the applicabilty of theorem  [ th1 ] ( even if this example is not related to an urn model ) . by the way this example can be easily generalized .",
    "suppose that @xmath121 satisfies the differential equation @xmath122 then again all assumptions of theorem  [ th1 ] are satisfied .",
    "here we have @xmath123 , @xmath124 , @xmath125 , and @xmath126 , that is @xmath127 and @xmath112 .    from this",
    "it follows that @xmath128 and consequently @xmath129 the functions @xmath117 and @xmath118 satisfy the system of equations @xmath130 from which we obtain ( by implicit differentiation ) @xmath131 thus , the central limit theorem follows ( again ) automatically .",
    "the first step of the proof is to use the theory of characteristics to provide an integral representation ( [ eqhrep ] ) of the solution of the partial differential equation ( [ eqpde ] ) .",
    "we start with the inhomogeneous differential equation ( [ eqpde ] ) , where @xmath132 is considered as a parameter .",
    "it is a standard procedure to transform ( [ eqpde ] ) into a homogeneous equation .",
    "let @xmath133 denote the solution of the linear differential equation @xmath134 then the solution @xmath72 of the original equation ( [ eqpde ] ) satisfies the implicit equation @xmath135 thus , if we can solve ( [ eqpde2 ] ) then we also get the solution of ( [ eqpde ] ) .",
    "the advantage of the equation ( [ eqpde2 ] ) is that it can be handled with the method of characteristics ( see @xcite ) .",
    "first we translate ( [ eqpde2 ] ) into a system of first order ordinary differential equations : @xmath136 where @xmath137 , @xmath138 , @xmath139 are functions in @xmath140 .",
    "a characteristic of ( [ eqpde3 ] ) is a function @xmath141 for which we have @xmath142 clearly , every characteristic @xmath143 is a solution of ( [ eqpde2 ] ) .",
    "it is well known that a system of three equations has two independent characteristics @xmath144 as a basis and every characteristic @xmath143 can be expressed as @xmath145 for an arbitrary ( differentiable ) function @xmath146 . in the present case",
    "we have to solve the equation ( [ eqqhequ ] ) which simplifies the situation .",
    "more precisely we can rewrite ( [ eqqhequ ] ) to an equation of the form @xmath147 where @xmath148 is an arbitrary ( differentiable ) function .    in order to calculate two independent characteristics",
    "it is convenient to _ eliminate _",
    "@xmath140 from the system ( [ eqpde3 ] ) which gives rise to a simpler system of differential equation : @xmath149 where @xmath150 and @xmath151 are now considered as functions is @xmath92 .",
    "let @xmath152 be a one - parametric solution of the differential equation @xmath153 , where @xmath154 is , for example , the initial value @xmath155 .",
    "if we express @xmath154 from the expression @xmath152 , that is , @xmath156 then @xmath157 is a characteristic of the system ( [ eqpde3 ] ) .",
    "note that @xmath157 does not depend on @xmath158 and also not on @xmath132 .",
    "actually @xmath157 just solves the equation @xmath159 .",
    "nevertheless it is a non - trivial characteristic of ( [ eqpde3 ] ) .    in order to obtain a second characteristic we have to solve the second equation of ( [ eqpde4 ] ) which is a first order linear differential equation .",
    "note that we can substitute @xmath152 and obtain as a solution @xmath160 where @xmath161 is some constant . again",
    "if we express @xmath161 explicitly ( and eliminate @xmath154 with the help of @xmath156 ) we get another characteristic : @xmath162 now if we apply ( [ eqqhequ2 ] ) we obtain the following representation for @xmath158 : @xmath163 in our context we will assume that ( [ eqhw0 ] ) holds , that is , @xmath164 , which implies that @xmath165 .",
    "consequently we have @xmath166",
    "next we assume that the assumptions of theorem  [ th1 ] are satisfied so that we can analyze the analytic properties of the solution function @xmath72 that is given by ( [ eqhrep ] ) .",
    "actually we will show that if @xmath132 is close to @xmath167 that the dominant singularity comes from a curve that is a pertubation of the curve @xmath168 .",
    "first we note that by assumption the function @xmath169 is regular as well as the fraction @xmath75 .",
    "consequently the function @xmath170 is analytic , too .",
    "thus , it remains to consider the integral @xmath171 first let us assume that @xmath36 . in this case we know by assumption that @xmath172 .",
    "furthermore we have @xmath82 .",
    "thus the above integral simplifies to @xmath173 where @xmath174 is a non - zero regular function .",
    "as long as @xmath175 for @xmath176 then the integral represents a regular function in @xmath91 and @xmath92 .",
    "hence , we have to detect @xmath177 for which @xmath178 .",
    "let us first assume that @xmath91 and @xmath92 are real and positive .",
    "we also recall that by assumption @xmath179 . thus ,",
    "if we start with @xmath76 close to zero and increase them we observe that the first critical instance occurs when @xmath180 .",
    "of course this has to coincide with the condition @xmath168 and we have to recover the ( known ) singular behaviour @xmath181 .",
    "actually we can use the following easy lemma ( which follows from partial integration ) .",
    "suppose that @xmath182 and @xmath183 are three times continuously differentiable functions such that @xmath184 and @xmath185 then we have @xmath186    if we apply this lemma in our context it follows that @xmath187 for positive real @xmath76 with @xmath188 ( and a proper non - zero analytic function @xmath189 ) .",
    "summing up we obtain for positive real @xmath76 with @xmath188 the asymptotic representation @xmath190 for some non - zero analytic function @xmath191 .",
    "in particular it follows that @xmath192 can be written as @xmath193 of course the same kind of analysis applies if @xmath91 and @xmath92 are complex numbers close to the positive real line .",
    "furthermore we observe that the integral representation for @xmath194 will not get singular if @xmath195 . by continuity",
    "this also holds if @xmath132 is close to @xmath167 and @xmath196 for some @xmath197 .",
    "finally if @xmath132 is close ( but different ) to @xmath167 and @xmath91 and @xmath92 satisfy @xmath198 then we just have to modify the above analysis slightly and observe that @xmath72 can be represented as @xmath199 thus , the equation @xmath200 determines the dominant singularity of @xmath72 . by the implicit function theorem it follows that there exists a solution of ( [ eqsingcurve ] ) of the form @xmath201 with @xmath202 ( if @xmath92 is close to the positive real line segment @xmath203 $ ] ) .",
    "we start with a lemma on bivariate asymptotics for generating functions in two variables which is a slight generalization of the smooth case in pemantle and wilson s book @xcite .",
    "suppose that @xmath204 is a generating function in two variables that can be written in the form @xmath205 where @xmath206 and @xmath207 are regular functions such that the system of equations @xmath208 has a unique positive and analytic solution @xmath209 , @xmath210 for @xmath211 in a positive interval @xmath212 $ ] such that @xmath213 in this range and that @xmath214 has no other solutions for @xmath215 , @xmath216 .",
    "furthermore we assume that @xmath217 .",
    "then we have uniformly for @xmath105 $ ] @xmath218 f(z , w ) \\sim \\frac{n(z_0(m / n),w_0(m / n))}{-",
    "z_0(m / n)w_0(m / n ) d_z(z_0(m",
    "/ n),w_0(m / n ) ) }   \\frac { z_0(m / n)^{-n}w_0(m / n)^{-m}}{\\sqrt{2\\pi n \\delta(m / n ) } } , \\ ] ] where @xmath219    by assumption the map @xmath220 has a unique polar singularity at @xmath221 , where @xmath222 is determined by @xmath223 ( for @xmath92 close to the real interval @xmath224 $ ] ) which implies @xmath225 f(z , w ) \\sim",
    "\\frac{n(z(w),w)}{-z(w)d_z(z(w),w ) } z(w)^{-n}.\\ ] ] finally we fix the ratio @xmath226 and a direct application of the saddle point method on the cauchy integral evaluating @xmath227 f(z , w ) = \\frac",
    "1{2\\pi i } \\int_{|w| = w_0(\\rho ) } \\left([z^n ] f(z , w ) \\right ) w^{-m-1}\\ , dw\\ ] ] leads to the result .",
    "note that the saddle point @xmath210 that comes from the power @xmath228 has to satisfy ( [ eqsaddle ] ) .",
    "we now apply this procedure to a slightly more general situation , namely when there is a further parameter @xmath132 ( that is assumed to be close to @xmath167 ) : @xmath229 in our context we have to identify @xmath230 with @xmath72 and @xmath78 with @xmath231 . of",
    "course we have to formulate proper assumptions ( similar to the above which are actually satisfied for @xmath72 ) and , hence , by ( [ eqdoubleasymptotics ] ) we obtain an asymptotic expansion of the form @xmath232 h(z , w;v ) \\sim \\frac{c(m / n;v)}{\\sqrt{2\\pi",
    "n } } z_0(m / n;v)^{-n } w_0(m / n;v)^{-m}\\ ] ] that is uniform in @xmath132 ( for @xmath132 sufficiently close to @xmath167 ) .",
    "if we fix the ratio @xmath233 the leading asymptotics is then just a power in @xmath3 : @xmath234 with @xmath235 .",
    "actually we have a so - called _ quasi - power _ , where we can expect that ( after proper normalization ) a central limit theorem should hold .    in our context we obtain @xmath236 = \\frac{[z^n w^{\\rho n } ] h(z , w;v)}{[z^n w^{\\rho n } ] h(z , w;1 ) } \\sim \\frac{c(\\rho;v)}{c(\\rho;1 ) } \\left ( \\frac{z_0(\\rho;1 ) w_0(\\rho;1)^\\rho}{z_0(\\rho;v ) w_0(\\rho;v)^\\rho}\\right)^n.\\ ] ] and this is precisely the assumption that is needed in order to apply hwang s _ quasi - power theorem _ @xcite .",
    "let @xmath237 be a random variable with the property that @xmath238 holds uniformly in a complex neighbourhood of @xmath239 , where @xmath240 and @xmath241 are sequences of positive real numbers with @xmath242 and @xmath243 , and @xmath244 and @xmath245 are analytic functions in this neighbourhood of @xmath239 with @xmath246 .",
    "then @xmath237 satisfies a central limit theorem of the form @xmath247 and we have @xmath248 and @xmath249 where @xmath250 and @xmath251    recall that @xmath252 so that @xmath253 since we have assumed that @xmath18 are non - negative random variables we can only expect a central limit theorem if @xmath254 , since for @xmath255 it would follow that @xmath18 is negative with probability @xmath256 .",
