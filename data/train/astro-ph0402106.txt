    "we consider some consequence of the assumption that radiation of sgr a * is caused by existence of a supermassive compact object without events horizon in the galaxy center .",
    "such steady configurations of the degenerated fermi - gas with masses @xmath1 @xmath2 and with the radiuses @xmath3 less than the schwarzschild radius @xmath4 are one of the consequence of the metric - field equations of gravitation @xcite , @xcite , @xcite . in the theory gravitational field of an attractive",

    "physical consequences from the gravitation equations under consideration are very close to the ones in general relativity at the distances from the central mass much more than @xmath4 .",
    "however they are completely different at the distances nearby @xmath4 or less than that .",

    "since the gravitational equations was tested by the binary pulsar psr 1913 + 16 @xcite and stability of the supermassive configurations was studied sufficiently rigorously @xcite , it is meaningful to investigate the possibility of the existence of such objects at the galaxy center as an alternative to the supermassive black hole hypothesis .",

    "although we never observed the motion of the particle at distances close to @xmath4 , we can test this conclusion for very distant objects in our universe because for its observed mass @xmath18 the value of @xmath19 is close to the observed radius @xmath20 of the universe . at such distances the gravitational force affecting the particles change the sign . and",
    "the repulsion force in a simple model of the expanded selfgraviting dust ball gives a simple and clear explanation of the acceleration of the universe expansion @xcite , @xcite , it is seems in the first sight that the accretion onto the object give rise to a too large energy release at the surface that contradicts the low bolometric luminosity ( @xmath21 @xmath22 ) of sgr a*. however , it must be taken into account that in the gravitation theory under consideration the velocity of free falling test particles decrease inside the schwarzschild radius @xcite .",
