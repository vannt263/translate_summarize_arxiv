    "in recent years black holes in anti - de sitter ( ads ) spaces have attracted a great deal of attention .",
    "there are at least two reasons responsible for this .",
    "first , in the spirit of ads / cft correspondence  @xcite , it has been convincingly argued by witten  @xcite that the thermodynamics of black holes in ads spaces ( ads black holes ) can be identified with that of a certain dual cft in the high temperature limit . with this correspondence",
    ", one can gain some insights into thermodynamic properties and phase structures of strong t hooft coupling cfts by studying thermodynamics of ads black holes .",
    "second , although the  topological censorship theorem \"  @xcite still holds in asymptotically ads spaces  @xcite , it has been found that except for the spherically symmetric black holes whose event horizon is a sphere surface , black holes also exist with even horizon being a zero or negative constant curvature hypersurface .",
    "these black holes are referred to as topological black holes in the literature . due to the different horizon structures ,",
    "these black holes behave in many aspects quite different from the spherically symmetric black holes  @xcite-  @xcite .",
    "it is by now known that the ads schwarzschild black hole is thermodynamically unstable when the horizon radius is small , while it is stable for large radius ; there is a phase transition , named hawking - page phase transition  @xcite , between the large stable black hole and a thermal ads space .",
    "this phase transition is explained by witten  @xcite as the confinement / deconfinement transition of the yang - mills theory in the ads / cft correspondence .",
    "however , it is interesting to note that if event horizon of ads black holes is a hypersurface with zero or negative constant curvature , the black hole is always stable and the corresponding cft is always dominated by the black hole .",
    "that is , there does not exist the hawking - page phase transition for ads black holes with a ricci flat or hyperbolic horizon  @xcite .",
    "higher derivative curvature terms occur in many occasions , such as in the semiclassically quantum gravity and in the effective low - energy action of superstring theories . in the latter case , according to the ads / cft correspondence , these terms can be viewed as the corrections of large @xmath3 expansion of boundary cfts in the strong coupling limit . due to the non - linearity of einstein equations , however , it is very difficult to find out nontrivial exact analytical solutions of the einstein equations with these higher derivative terms . in most cases",
    ", one has to adopt some approximation methods or find solutions numerically .    among the gravity theories with higher derivative curvature terms , the so - called lovelock gravity  @xcite is of some special features in some sense .",
    "for example , the resulting field equations contain no more than second derivatives of the metric and it has been proven to be free of ghosts when expanding about the flat space , evading any problems with unitarity .",
    "the lagrangian of lovelock theory is the sum of dimensionally extended euler densities @xmath4 where @xmath5 is an arbitrary constant and @xmath6 is the euler density of a @xmath7-dimensional manifold , @xmath8 here @xmath9 and hence @xmath10 is just the cosmological constant .",
    "@xmath11 gives us the usual einstein - hilbert term and @xmath12 is the gauss - bonnet term .",
    "a spherically symmetric static solution of ( [ 1eq1 ] ) has been found in the sense that the metric function is determined by solving for the real roots of a polynomial equation  @xcite .",
    "since the lagrangian ( [ 1eq1 ] ) includes many arbitrary coefficients @xmath5 , it is difficult to extract physical information from the solution . in refs .",
    "@xcite , by restricting these coefficients to a special set so that the metric function can be readily determined by solving the polynomial equation , some exact , spherically symmetric black hole solutions have been found .",
    "black hole solutions with nontrivial topology in this theory have been also studied in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "in this paper we will analyze black hole solutions in einstein theory with a gauss - bonnet term and a negative cosmological constant , in which the gauss - bonnet coefficient is not fixed .",
    "in this theory a static , spherically symmetric black hole solution was first discovered by boulware and deser  @xcite .",
    "however , the thermodynamic properties of the solution were not discussed there . here",
    "we will first generalize this solution to the case in which the horizon of black holes can be a positive , negative or zero constant curvature hypersurface , and then discuss thermodynamic properties and phase structures of black holes . because of this gauss - bonnet term , some nontrivial and interesting features will occur .",
    "the einstein - hilbert action with a gauss - bonnet term and a negative cosmological constant , @xmath13 , in @xmath0 dimensions can be written down as@xcite   is assumed in this paper . ]",
    "@xmath14 where @xmath15 is the gauss - bonnet coefficient with dimension @xmath16 and is positive in the heterotic string theory  @xcite .",
    "so we restrict ourselves to the case @xmath17   in sec .",
    "varying the action yields the equations of gravitational field @xmath18 we assume the metric being of the following form @xmath19 where @xmath20 and @xmath21 are functions of @xmath22 only , and @xmath23 represents the line element of a ( @xmath24)-dimensional hypersurface with constant curvature @xmath25 and volume @xmath26 . without loss of the generality ,",
    "one may take @xmath27 , @xmath28 or @xmath29 .",
    "following ref .",
    "@xcite and substituting the ansatz ( [ 3eq3 ] ) into the action ( [ 3eq1 ] ) , we obtain @xmath30',\\ ] ] where a prime denotes derivative with respect to @xmath22 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 . from the action ( [ 3eq4 ] )",
    ", one can find the solution @xmath33 from which we obtain the exact solution ) indeed satisfies the equations ( [ 3eq2 ] ) of motion .",
    "this is related to the fact that following @xcite , one can show that a birkhoff - like theorem holds in the gravity theory ( [ 3eq1 ] ) . ]",
    "@xmath34 where @xmath35 is the gravitational mass of the solution ) into the action ( [ 3eq4 ] ) and then using boundary term method . for this method , for example ,",
    "see @xcite . ] .",
    "the solution with @xmath27 and spherical symmetry was first found by boulware and deser  @xcite .",
    "here we extend this solution to include the cases @xmath36 and @xmath28 . note that the solution ( [ 3eq6 ] ) has two branches with",
    " @xmath37 \" or  @xmath38 \" sign .",
    "moreover , there is a potential singularity at the place where the square root vanishes in ( [ 3eq6 ] ) , except for the singularity at @xmath39 .",
    "here we mention that the theory ( [ 3eq1 ] ) with @xmath40 discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite in five dimensions corresponds to the theory proposed in @xcite ; the solution with @xmath41 discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite in five dimensions was also included in refs .",
    "if @xmath42 , namely , without the gauss - bonnet term , the solution ( [ 3eq6 ] ) reduces to the one in @xcite , and the thermodynamics of the latter was discussed there .",
    "when @xmath43 , the vacuum solution in ( [ 3eq6 ] ) is @xmath44 since @xmath45 , one can see from the above that @xmath46 must obey @xmath47 , beyond which this theory is undefined .",
    "thus , the action ( [ 3eq1 ] ) has two ads solutions with effective cosmological constants @xmath48 .",
    "when @xmath49 , these two solutions coincide with each other , resulting in @xmath50 and that the theory has a unique ads vacuum  @xcite . on the other hand , if @xmath51 , the solution ( [ 3eq7 ] ) is still an ads space if one takes the `` @xmath37 '' sign , but becomes a de sitter space if one takes the `` @xmath38 '' sign and @xmath27 . from the vacuum case ,",
    "the solution ( [ 3eq7 ] ) with both signs seems reasonable , from which we can not determine which sign in ( [ 3eq6 ] ) should be adopted .",
    "this problem can be solved by considering the propagation of gravitons on the background ( [ 3eq7 ] ) .",
    "it has been shown by boulware and deser  @xcite that the branch with ",
    "@xmath52 sign is unstable and the graviton is a ghost , while the branch with  @xmath37 \" sign is stable and is free of ghosts .",
    "this can also be seen from the case @xmath53 .",
    "when @xmath27 and @xmath54 , just as observed by boulware and deser  @xcite , the solution is asymptotically a schwarzschild solution if one takes the",
    " @xmath37 \" sign , but is asymptotically an ads schwarzschild solution with a negative gravitational mass for the `` @xmath38 '' sign , indicating the instability .",
    "therefore the branch with  @xmath38 \" sign in ( [ 3eq6 ] ) is of less physical interest ) without the negative cosmological constant , namely , @xmath54 , has been made in @xcite . ] .",
    "from now on , we will not consider the branch with  @xmath38 \" sign .    from ( [ 3eq6 ] ) , the mass of black holes can be expressed in terms of the horizon radius @xmath55 , @xmath56 the hawking temperature of the black holes can be easily obtained by requiring the absence of conical singularity at the horizon in the euclidean sector of the black hole solution . it is @xmath57 usually entropy of black holes satisfies the so - called area formula .",
    "this is , the black hole entropy equals to one - quarter of horizon area . in gravity theories with higher derivative curvature terms , however , in general the entropy of black holes does not satisfy the area formula . to get the black hole entropy , in @xcite",
    "we suggested a simple method according to the fact that as a thermodynamic system , the entropy of black hole must obey the first law of black hole thermodynamics : @xmath58 . integrating the first law",
    ", we have @xmath59 where we have imposed the physical assumption that the entropy vanishes when the horizon of black holes shrinks to zero black hole , there exists a minimal horizon radius . for these black holes ,",
    "therefore the horizon can not shrink to zero . however , it is known that the black hole entropy is a function of horizon surface  @xcite . according to the second law of black hole mechanics ,",
    "the black hole entropy can be expressed in terms of a polynomial of horizon radius @xmath55 with positive exponents . as a result , although the black hole horizon can not shrink to zero when @xmath60 , this method seems applicable as well . the results in @xcite and in this paper show this point .",
    "for example , when @xmath61 , the formula ( [ 3eq11 ] ) gives the entropy of ads black holes in einstein theory without the gauss - bonnet term . obviously , in this case",
    "the resulting area formula ( [ 3eq11 ] ) holds as well in the case of @xmath60 . ] .",
    "thus once given the temperature and mass of black holes in terms of the horizon radius , one can readily get the entropy of black holes and needs not know in which gravitational theory the black hole solutions are . substituting ( [ 3eq8 ] ) and ( [ 3eq9 ] ) into ( [ 3eq10 ] ) , we find the entropy of the gauss - bonnet black holes ( [ 3eq6 ] ) is @xmath62 when @xmath27 , it is in complete agreement with the one in @xcite , there the entropy of the gauss - bonnet black holes without the cosmological constant is obtained by calculating the euclidean action of black holes .",
    "the heat capacity of black holes is @xmath63 where @xmath64.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the free energy of black holes , defined as @xmath65 , is @xmath66.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] thus we give some thermodynamic quantities of gauss - bonnet black holes in ads spaces .",
    "when @xmath61 , these thermodynamic quantities reduce to corresponding ones in ref .  @xcite . in fig .  1 the inverse temperature @xmath67 of the black holes versus the horizon radius is plotted .",
    "we can see clearly different behaviors for the cases @xmath27 , @xmath29 and @xmath28 : the inverse temperature always starts from infinity and monotonically decreases to zero in the cases @xmath36 and @xmath60 , while it starts from zero and reaches its maximum at a certain horizon radius and then goes to zero monotonically when @xmath27 .",
    "this indicates that for the cases @xmath60 and @xmath36 , the black holes are not only locally thermodynamic stable , but also globally preferred , while in the case of @xmath27 , the black hole is not locally thermodynamic stable for small radius , but it is for large radius .",
    "therefore , for the @xmath27 case , there is a hawking - page phase transition .",
    "for details see @xcite .    when @xmath68 , we see that those quantities drastically depend on the parameter @xmath69 , horizon structure @xmath70 and the spacetime dimension @xmath0 . below we will discuss each case according to the classification of horizon structures , @xmath36 , @xmath60 and @xmath27 , respectively .      in this case",
    "we have @xmath71 where @xmath72 .",
    "it is interesting to note that these thermodynamic quantities are independent of the parameter @xmath69 .",
    "that is , these quantities have the completely same expressions as those @xcite for black holes without the gauss - bonnet term .",
    "we therefore conclude that in the case @xmath36 , the black holes with and without gauss - bonnet term have completely same thermodynamic properties , although the two solutions are quite different , which can be seen from ( [ 3eq6 ] ) . in particular , we note here that the entropy of the gauss - bonnet black holes still satisfies the area formula in the case @xmath36 .      as the case @xcite without the gauss - bonnet term , there are also so - called  massless \" black hole and  negative \" mass black hole in the gauss - bonnet black hole ( [ 3eq6 ] ) . when @xmath43 , the black hole has the horizon radius @xmath73 with hawking temperature @xmath74 .",
    "here there are two  massless \" black hole solutions , corresponding to two branches in the solution ( [ 3eq6 ] ) .",
    "but the black hole with smaller horizon radius belongs to the unstable branch .",
    "given a fixed @xmath69 , the smallest black hole has the horizon radius @xmath75 the black hole is an extremal one , it has vanishing hawking temperature and the most  negative \" mass @xmath76 when @xmath77 , the smallest radius is @xmath78 and @xmath79 , independent of the spacetime dimension @xmath0 .",
    "but in this case , the hawking temperature does not vanish .",
    "it is @xmath80 .",
    "this is an exceptional case .    from the solution ( [ 3eq6 ] )",
    ", one can find that in order for the solution to have a black hole horizon , the horizon radius must obey @xmath81 thus the smallest radius ( [ 3eq17 ] ) gives a constraint on the allowed value of the parameter @xmath69 : @xmath82 which leads to @xmath83 .",
    "since the theory is defined in the region @xmath84 , the condition ( [ 3eq20 ] ) is always satisfied .",
    "due to the existence of the smallest black holes ( [ 3eq17 ] ) , we see from ( [ 3eq9 ] ) that except for the case @xmath85 , the temperature of black hole always starts from zero at the smallest radii , corresponding to the extremal black holes and monotonically goes to infinity as @xmath86 . in the case",
    "@xmath87 , the temperature starts from @xmath88 at @xmath89 .",
    "this can also be verified by looking at the behavior of the heat capacity ( [ 3eq12 ] ) .",
    "after considering the fact that @xmath90 and @xmath91 , it is easy to show that the heat capacity is always positive . in fig .  2 we plot the inverse temperature of black holes in six dimensions versus the parameter @xmath92 and the horizon radius @xmath93 .",
    "among the smallest black holes ( [ 3eq17 ] ) , the most smallest one is @xmath89 when @xmath94 , its free energy is zero .",
    "therefore the free energy is always negative for other black holes since the heat capacity is always positive . as a result , the thermodynamic properties of the black holes with the gauss - bonnet term are qualitatively similar to those of black holes without the gauss - bonnet term : these black holes are always stable not only locally , but also globally .",
    "in addition , let us note that except for the singularity at @xmath39 , the black hole solution ( [ 3eq6 ] ) has another singularity at @xmath95 when @xmath96 . but",
    "both singularities are shielded by the event horizon @xmath55 .",
    "this case is very interesting .",
    "from the temperature ( [ 3eq9 ] ) one can see that the case @xmath2 is quite different from the other cases @xmath1 .",
    "when @xmath2 , the temperature starts from zero at @xmath97 and goes to infinity as @xmath98 , while it starts from infinity at @xmath97 as @xmath1 . in fig",
    "3 we show the inverse temperatures of black holes with @xmath99 in different dimensions @xmath2 , @xmath100 and @xmath101 , respectively .",
    "the behavior of temperature of black holes with the gauss - bonnet term in @xmath1 dimensions is similar to that of ads black holes without the gauss - bonnet term .",
    "but the case of @xmath2 ( see fig .  4 ) is quite different from the corresponding one without the gauss - bonnet term ( see fig .  1 ) . comparing fig .  4 with fig .  1",
    ", we see that a new phase of stably small black hole occurs in the gauss - bonnet black holes .",
    "when @xmath2 , we have from ( [ 3eq8 ] ) the black hole horizon @xmath102 where @xmath103 .",
    "therefore , in this case there is a mass gap @xmath104 : all black holes have a mass @xmath105 . using the horizon radius , from fig .",
    "4 we can see that the black holes can be classified to three branches : @xmath106 where @xmath107 with the assumption @xmath108 . in the branch 1 and 3 ,",
    "the heat capacity is positive , while it is negative in the branch 2 .",
    "therefore the black holes are locally stable in the branch 1 and 3 , and unstable in the branch 2 . at the joint points of branches , namely , @xmath109 , the heat capacity diverges . comparing with the case without the gauss - bonnet term",
    ", one can see that the branch 1 is new .",
    "when @xmath46 increases to the value , @xmath110 , we find that the branch 2 with negative heat capacity disappears . beyond this value ,",
    "the heat capacity is always positive and the gauss - bonnet black holes are always locally stable . in fig .  5",
    ", we show the inverse temperatures of gauss - bonnet black hole with the parameter @xmath92 , subcritical value @xmath111 , critical value @xmath112 , and supercritical value @xmath113 , respectively . in fig .  6",
    ", the continuous evolution of the inverse temperature is plotted with the parameter @xmath92 from zero to @xmath114 , from which one can see clearly that the black holes evolve from two branches to one branch via three branches .",
    "however , inspecting the free energy ( [ 3eq14 ] ) reveals that these stably small black holes are not globally preferred : the free energy always starts from some positive value at @xmath97 and then goes to negative infinity as @xmath86 . in fig .",
    "7 the free energy of black holes with different parameter @xmath92 is plotted .",
    "we see that all curves cross the horizontal axis ( horizon radius ) one time only , where @xmath115 . in fig .",
    "8 we plot the region where the free energy is negative .",
    "the region is @xmath116 where @xmath117 the joint point of the two curves is at @xmath118 and @xmath119 . beyond this region",
    ", the thermal ads space is globally preferred .",
    "we see that there is a smallest horizon radius @xmath120 : there will not exist the hawking - page phase transition when the black hole horizon is smaller than the value @xmath120 .",
    "when black holes cross the curves @xmath121 and @xmath122 , a hawking - page phase transition happens .",
    "the region in which black holes are locally stable is determined by the curve @xmath123 , @xmath124 in fig .",
    "9 the curve @xmath125 is plotted ( the lowest one ) : the region is locally stable above this curve , namely , @xmath126 , and locally unstable below this curve .",
    "this curve @xmath123 touches the curve @xmath127 at @xmath128 and @xmath129 .",
    "unfortunately , in fig .",
    "9 most part of the curve @xmath130 is outside the plot . in fig .",
    "9 one can see that there is a large region where black holes are locally stable , but not globally preferred .",
    "when @xmath1 , unlike the case @xmath2 , there is no the mass gap .",
    "the properties of gauss - bonnet black holes are qualitatively similar to those of black holes without the gauss - bonnet term .",
    "this can be seen from the behavior of the hawking temperature of black holes in fig .",
    "this implies that the equation @xmath131 has only one positive real root @xmath132 . using ( [ 3eq13 ] )",
    ", one can obtain the positive real root .",
    "but its expression is complicated , so we do not present it here . given a spacetime dimension @xmath0 and a fixed parameter @xmath133 ,",
    "when a black hole has a horizon @xmath134 , the black hole is locally stable . otherwise , it is unstable .",
    "the free energy ( [ 3eq14 ] ) always starts from zero in the case @xmath1 , reaches a positive maximum at some @xmath55 , and then goes to negative infinity as @xmath86 .",
    "this behavior is the same as the case without the gauss - bonnet term ( see the curve of @xmath135 in fig .",
    "the region where the black hole is globally preferred is restricted by a relation like ( [ 3eq25 ] ) , but with @xmath136.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and as in the case of @xmath2 , these two curves connect at @xmath137 in the @xmath138 plane .",
    "therefore the phase structure of black holes in @xmath139 dimensions is similar to the one in @xmath2 dimensions ( fig .",
    "finally let us mention that the temperature behavior ( fig .",
    "4 ) of @xmath2 gauss - bonnet black holes is quite similar to the one of the reissner - nordstrm ( rn ) black holes in ads spaces in the canonical ensemble  @xcite . there under the critical value of charge , the phase of stably small black holes occurs as well .",
    "however , there is a big difference between two cases : for the rn black holes , the small black hole is not only locally stable , but also globally preferred , while the small gauss - bonnet black hole is only locally stable and not globally preferred , instead a thermal ads space is preferred .",
    "we have presented exact topological black hole solutions in einstein theory with a gauss - bonnet term and a negative cosmological constant , generalizing the spherically symmetric black hole solution found by boulware and deser  @xcite to the case where the event horizon of black holes is a positive , zero or negative constant curvature hypersurface .",
    "we have examined thermodynamic properties and analyzed phase structures of these topological black holes .",
    "when the even horizon is a zero curvature hypersurface , we find that thermodynamic properties of gauss - bonnet black holes are completely the same as those without the gauss - bonnet term , although the two black hole solutions are quite different . as a result , these @xmath36 gauss - bonnet black holes are not only locally thermodynamic stable , but also globally preferred .",
    "in particular , the entropy of these black holes satisfies the area formula .",
    "note that usually black holes in gravity theories with higher derivative curvature terms do not obey the area formula .",
    "when the even horizon is a negative constant hypersurface , these black holes are qualitatively similar to those without the gauss - bonnet term .",
    "these @xmath60 gauss - bonnet black holes are always locally stable and globally preferred .",
    "when the event horizon is a positive constant hypersurface , however , some interesting features occurs .",
    "when @xmath2 , a new phase of thermodynamically stable small black holes appears if the gauss - bonnet coefficient is under a critical value . beyond the critical value ,",
    "the black holes are always thermodynamically stable . inspecting",
    "the free energy of black holes reveals these stable small black holes are not globally preferred , instead a thermal ads space is preferred .",
    "the phase structures are plotted , from which we find that there is a smallest black hole radius . beyond this radius , the hawking - page phase transition will not happen . from the phase diagram",
    "we see that there is a large region in which the black hole is locally stable , but not globally preferred .",
    "when @xmath139 , however , the new phase of stable small black holes disappears .",
    "once again , the thermodynamic properties of the black holes are qualitatively similar to those of black holes without the gauss - bonnet term .",
    "now we discuss the case @xmath140 .",
    "the vacuum solution is still the one ( [ 3eq7 ] ) .",
    "so in this case there is no restriction on the value of @xmath46 ; the solution ( [ 3eq6 ] ) is still asymptotically ads .",
    "those expressions of thermodynamic quantities ( [ 3eq8 ] ) , ( [ 3eq9 ] ) , ( [ 3eq11 ] ) , ( [ 3eq13 ] ) and ( [ 3eq14 ] ) are applicable as well .",
    "when @xmath36 , since thermodynamic quantities are independent of the parameter @xmath46 in this case , the conclusion is the same as the case @xmath45 , but with a new singularity at @xmath141 which is always shielded by the event horizon @xmath55 .    when @xmath60 , the situation is similar to the case @xmath45 , nothing special appears",
    ". in this case , the smallest radius is @xmath142 the smallest black hole has a vanishing hawking temperature . inside the event horizon",
    "there is an additional singularity at @xmath143 except for the one at @xmath39 .",
    "the black holes are also always locally stable and globally preferred .    when @xmath27 , there is also a smallest horizon radius @xmath144 but this smallest black hole has a divergent hawking temperature . in this case",
    "the event horizon coincides with an additional singularity at @xmath145 . for larger black holes",
    "the additional singularity is located at @xmath146 inside the black hole horizon .",
    "the inverse temperature of black holes starts from zero at the smallest radius ( [ min ] ) , reaches its maximal at some @xmath55 and goes to zero when @xmath86 .",
    "the thermodynamic properties of black holes are qualitatively similar to the case with @xmath42 . as a result , the new phase , which appears in the case @xmath2 and @xmath147 , does not occur in this case .",

    "<S> we study thermodynamic properties and phase structures of topological black holes in einstein theory with a gauss - bonnet term and a negative cosmological constant . </S>",
    "<S> the event horizon of these topological black holes can be a hypersurface with positive , zero or negative constant curvature . </S>",
    "<S> when the horizon is a zero curvature hypersurface , the thermodynamic properties of black holes are completely the same as those of black holes without the gauss - bonnet term , although the two black hole solutions are quite different . when the horizon is a negative constant curvature hypersurface , the thermodynamic properties of the gauss - bonnet black holes are qualitatively similar to those of black holes without the gauss - bonnet term . when the event horizon is a hypersurface with positive constant curvature , we find that the thermodynamic properties and phase structures of black holes drastically depend on the spacetime dimension @xmath0 and the coefficient of the gauss - bonnet term : when @xmath1 , the properties of black hole are also qualitatively similar to the case without the gauss - bonnet term , but when @xmath2 , a new phase of locally stable small black hole occurs under a critical value of the gauss - bonnet coefficient , and beyond the critical value , the black holes are always thermodynamically stable . however , the locally stable small black hole is not globally preferred , instead a thermal anti - de sitter space is globally preferred . </S>",
    "<S> we find that there is a minimal horizon radius , below which the hawking - page phase transition will not occur since for these black holes the thermal anti de sitter space is always globally preferred . </S>"
