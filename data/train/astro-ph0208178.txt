    "important improvements expected from gaia are outlined in section  [ sec:4 ] .",

    "the two pillars of the extragalactic distance scale are cepheids and supernovae of type ia , which are discussed in turn , as well as other distance indicators .",
    "the fundamental rle of classical cepheids for extragalactic distances rests on their period - luminosity ( p - l ) relation , whose shape and zero point must be known .",
    "most published cepheid distances are based on a linear , wavelength - dependent p - l relation as derived by madore & freedman ( 1991 ) from lmc cepheids : @xmath10 ( as to the zero point see 2.1.2 . ) .",
    "these equations yield apparent moduli @xmath11 , @xmath12 , and @xmath13 , still affected by galactic , and in the case of extragalactic cepheids by internal absorption . the true distance modulus @xmath14 can be obtained by a combination of the apparent moduli if an absorption law is adopted ( here : @xmath15 , @xmath16 , and @xmath17 ) , i.e. @xmath18 almost all galaxies with cepheid distances outside the local group have been observed with hst in @xmath19 and @xmath20 . if one assumes ( optimistically ) that the apparent moduli @xmath12 and @xmath13 have errors of @xmath21 the typical error of a cepheid modulus @xmath22 becomes @xmath23 ( 7% in linear distance ) from equation  ( [ eq:5 ] ) .",
    " if the cepheids in a galaxy suffer variable absorption they can be reduced one by one with equations  ( [ eq:4 ] ) and ( [ eq:5 ] ) ; their true distances can then be averaged .",
    "the ogle programme has provided new @xmath24 , @xmath19 , and @xmath20 photometry for hundreds of fundamental - mode lmc cepheids ( udalski et  al .",

    "one could gain the impression from section  2 that the problem of extragalactic distances was solved .",
    "nothing is further from the truth .",
    "only about 200 galaxies with random individual distance errors between @xmath48 and @xmath49 were involved . for the vast majority of galaxies",
    "one has still no distances .",
    "of course , a dynamical distance can be obtained from the recession velocity and an adopted value of @xmath45 , but the accuracy is limited by peculiar motions . if one assumes @xmath50 as a typical large - scale peculiar motion , as judged by the local motion with respect to the microwave background , the dynamical distances of galaxies beyond @xmath9 are affected by only @xmath51 from peculiar motions . for galaxies at @xmath52 the dynamical distance error is roughly tripled , but stays at this value for still nearer galaxies because the peculiar motions tend to decrease over shorter scales .",
    "the `` hubble '' scatter of the cepheid distances suggests that @xmath53 ( cf .",
    "section 2.1.3 ) . of course , the dynamical distances of very nearby galaxies ( @xmath54 or @xmath55mpc ) are highly unreliable , and they require `` honest '' distance determinations .",
    "this picture is over - optimistic for galaxies in high - density regions ( like the virgo region ) because the peculiar motions are larger here .",
    "some investigations depend just on a comparison of dynamical distances and `` honest '' distance determinations , e.g.  if the infall into the virgo cluster should be studied , or generally if the local and not so local expansion field should be mapped , which would result , among other things , in a delineation of the co - moving volume which partakes in the local motion towards the microwave background .    just for this purpose the data in fig .",

    "they define a tight hubble line with a scatter ( @xmath60 ) rivalling sneia .",
    "but they do not yield an independent value of @xmath45 ; this is because the individual cluster distances are the mean of about ten subjectively selected cluster members .",
    "they are far from constituting a complete sample , which is the _ conditio sine qua non _ for any application of equation  ( [ eq:14 ] ) .",
    "also the relative d@xmath61 distances of ten clusters by kelson et  al .",
    "( 2000 ) can not independently be put on an absolute scale for the same reason ( cf .",
    "tammann 2001 ) .    in the preceding pages",
    "only random statistical errors were quoted , although systematic errors are probably prevailing .",
    "most serious are of course systematic errors of the p - l relation of cepheids because the local expansion field on the left side of fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] as well as the large - scale expansion field on the right side depend on the goodness of the calibrating cepheid distances .",
    "so far all cepheid distances are based on equations  ( [ eq:2 ] ) and ( [ eq:3 ] ) .",
    "if equations  ( [ eq:10 ] ) and ( [ eq:11 ] ) were used instead they would be reduced by @xmath62 or 6% ( equation  [ eq:12 ] ) on average , assuming a median period of @xmath63 for the cepheids involved . yet",
    "the new p - l relations are only defined up to @xmath63 , the ogle images being saturated for lmc cepheids with longer periods . identification and photometry of the rare cepheids with long periods are therefore still needed",
    ".      the distance modulus @xmath34 ( table  [ tab:1 ] ) , which defines the zero point of the p - l relations , has a small statistical error , but a systematic error of about @xmath64 can not be excluded .",
    "the whole extragalactic distance scale would benefit from a firm lmc modulus .",
    "no corrections for the dependence of cepheid luminosities on metallicity have been applied , because even the sign of these corrections is not well known ( cf .",
    "tammann et  al .",
    "model calculations ( chiosi et  al .  1993 ; saio & gautschy 1998 ; sandage et  al .  1999 ; alibert & baraffe 2000 ) as well as observations ( kennicutt et  al .  1998 ; tammann et  al .  2001 ) indicate that the effect is smaller than @xmath65[fe / h ] , yet a dependence of this size would still decrease / increase the known cepheid distances by @xmath66 ( 4% ) on average .",
    "independent distance information of cepheids of different metallicity are therefore important .",
    "the finite width of the instability strip in the color - magnitude diagram causes an _ intrinsic _ scatter of the p - l relation which decreases with increasing wavelength ( see the scatter in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] ) .",
    "a p - l relation gives therefore the absolute magnitude and distance of a single cepheid to only @xmath67 .",
    "a p - l - color ( p - l - c ) relation of the form @xmath68 has repeatedly been proposed to position a cepheid within the instability strip .",
    "however , the pulsation models of saio & gautschy ( 1998 ) have shown that the constant - period lines in the instability strip change slope in function of mass , and hence the coefficient @xmath69 becomes a function of period .",
    "it has also been proposed to use the amplitude to locate a cepheid within the strip ( sandage & tammann 1971 ) .",
    "lack of sufficient data has brought these attempts to a preliminary halt .      as stated",
    "before the calibration of the terms @xmath70 and @xmath69 in equation  ( [ eq:13 ] ) is difficult , if not to say controversial .",
    "particularly statistical parallaxes of galactic rr lyrae stars , which strongly depend on the sample definition , have confused the issue .",
    "but there remains a tendency of rrlyr s  although sometimes exaggerated  to yield a smaller lmc modulus than cepheids ( cf .",
    "table  [ tab:1 ] ) .",
    "there is still the possibility that an additional parameter influences the rrlyr luminosities .",
    "the luminosity calibration of the @xmath20-band trgb rests so far only on a few adopted globular cluster distances , or otherwise has to rely on the cepheid distances of external galaxies .",
    "consequently the insensitivity of the trgb against metallicity is not well tested yet .",
    "a definitive calibration would make the trgb a powerful tool requiring relatively little observing time .",
    "the large - scale value of @xmath45 depends entirely on the absolute magnitudes of sneia ( equation  [ eq:17 ] ) , whose goodness in turn depends on nine calibrating cepheid distances .",
    "any improvement of the p - l relation of cepheids reflects therefore directly on @xmath45(cosmic ) .",
    " additional sneia at intermediate distances are needed to tighten the correlation of their absolute magnitudes @xmath71 with their decline rate @xmath7 and intrinsic color @xmath8 .",
    "allowance for this correlation only develops the full power of sneia as standard candles , i.e. it reduces the observed scatter of their hubble diagram from @xmath72 to @xmath73 .",
    "but the correction of @xmath71(observed ) for second parameters has also a systematic effect on @xmath45 .",
    "this is because the nine calibrating sneia lie necessarily in late - type spirals ( to contain cepheids ) , and sneia in spirals tend to be brighter and bluer and to have smaller decline rates than average ( cf .",
    "parodi et  al .",
    "gaia will measure the trigonometric parallaxes of countless stars in lmc and smc as well as in umi and in at least seven other nearby dwarf galaxies .",
    "this will not only provide fundamental distances of these galaxies but also fix their orientation in space .",
    "gaia will in addition provide rotational parallaxes for some nearby galaxies like m31 and m33 and marginally even for galaxies outside the local group like ngc55 , ngc247 , ngc253 , ngc300 , m81 and ngc2403 , by comparing their rotation curves observed from radial velocities ( probably best observed from the ground ) and from proper motions .",
    "the direct distance measurements of nearby galaxies  important for themselves  will offer a control of the distance indicators discussed in the next section .",
    "gaia will determine trigonometric parallaxes of thousands of galactic cepheids , rr  lyrae stars , and of stars at the trgb .",
    "it will also provide highly reliable zams positions in function of metallicity , and the position of the cooling sequence of white dwarfs ( wd ) . moreover",
    ", gaia will measure the parallaxes of most of the 140 galactic globular clusters ( gc ) to better than 1% .",
    "their luminosity function ( gclf ) may in turn become valuable for an extragalactic distance scale based on only old objects ( cf .",
    "finally gaia will decide to what extent the p - l relation of mira variables can be made useful for distance determinations .",

    "section  3 ) .    therefore sneia with @xmath76",
    "are of particular interest . out to this limit their number can be estimated from their frequency per unit luminosity and from the luminosity density summed over all galaxies ( both scaled to [ for instance ] @xmath77 ) .",
    "the former is @xmath78 sneia per @xmath79 solar luminosities ( @xmath80 ) and per 100 years , independent of the galaxy type ( tammann et  al .",
    "1994 ) ; the total galaxian luminosity density is @xmath81mpc@xmath82 ( tammann 1982 ) .",
    "the volume @xmath83 being @xmath84mpc@xmath85 yields then 555 sneia per year with an error of probably less than a factor 2 .",
    "all of them have @xmath86 , where @xmath87 for sneia _ before _ correction for decline rate and color .",
    "half of these sneia will be caught by gaia , which covers every point in the sky once per month , near maximum , i.e.  earlier than 10 days after maximum . at this time",
    "a snia has faded to @xmath88 assuming the standard light curve of leibundgut ( 1991 ) , and if it is subsequently followed for 30 days , even the faintest snia of the sample will have @xmath89 .",
    "this follow - up is sufficient to extrapolate @xmath90 and to determine the decline rate @xmath7 and @xmath91 with sufficient accuracy even for sneia whose maxima have been missed by 10 days .",
    "the resulting @xmath90 corrected for @xmath7 and @xmath91 will yield , if combined with @xmath92 in equation  ( [ eq:17 ] ) , unrivalled distances for 1100 galaxies during the 4-year operation time of gaia .",
    "@xmath93 this number is overoptimistic because of galactic absorption .",
    "roughly one third of the sneia will be at low galactic latitudes , i.e.  @xmath94 and be dimmed by @xmath95",
    ". they are either missed , or their photometry is impaired by large absorption corrections .",
    "sneia at higher @xmath96 will suffer an absorption of @xmath97 on average ( cf.schlegel et  al .",
    "1998 ) . a corresponding margin of the detection and follow - up limits should therefore be allowed for . moreover",
    ", many day time sneia will not be suitable for follow - up from the ground .",
    "nevertheless the benefit of this programme is fourfold :    \\(1 ) the precision distances of these galaxies will map the not so local velocity field and explain the origin of the cmb dipole in great detail ;    \\(2 ) the residuals of the new sneia from the mean hubble line will fix the dependencies of @xmath90 on @xmath7 and @xmath91 with any desiderable accuracy .",
    "these dependencies rest now only on 35 sneia and their errors can still cause systematic errors of all sneia distances of 3 - 4% ( cf .",
    "parodi et  al .",
    "2000 ) .",
    "\\(3 ) the new sneia will richly populate the gap of the hubble diagram ( right side of fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] ) and fix the position of the hubble line to within a vanishingly small error , reducing still further the random error of the constant term @xmath98 in equation  ( [ eq:16 ] ) and correspondingly also of @xmath45 .",
    "moreover , the position of the hubble line at @xmath99 is essential when the cosmological constant @xmath100 shall be derived from the hubble diagram of very distant sneia .",
    "\\(4 ) the new sneia , for which one will have reliable survey times , are ideally suited for the determination of their frequency with unprecedented accuracy .",
    "gaia can not provide the follow - up photometry of the newly discovered sneia .",
    "the above sneia program is therefore only meaningful if it will be possible to organize a dedicated ( earth - bound ) program for the photometry in @xmath24 , @xmath19 ( and @xmath20 ) of the new sneia down to @xmath101 .    if one wants to carry the gaia search for sneia to still fainter limits their total number per year increases as @xmath102 ( cf .",
    "hg et  al .",
    ".    the sn sample provided by gaia will be little `` contaminated '' by sneii / ib because they are fainter by @xmath103 on average than sneia . therefore all magnitude - limited sn searches are strongly biased against sneii / ib in spite of their considerably higher frequency per unit volume .",
    "their value for cosmology is much smaller because their luminosity function is broad ( @xmath104 ; tammann & schrder 1990 ) and even skewed towards fainter sneii ( woltjer 1998 ) .",
    "they can hence not be used as standard candles .",
    "the determination of their _ individual _ distances from the expanding photosphere method ( epm ) poses formidable problems due to the compton scattering in _ moving _ atmospheres .",
    "available results may therefore still be affected by systematic effects ( cf .",
    "hamuy et  al.2001 and references therein ) .",
    "gaia s high resolution power will reveal a large number of gravitationally lensed double or multiple quasars . in principle",
    "they offer themselves for an independent distance determination , but the solution is typically degenerate as to the distance _ and _ the lensing mass .",
    "thus a single lensed quasar leaves a wide margin for @xmath105 ( saha & williams 2001 ) .",
    "a _ combined _",
    "solution for six quasars gives @xmath106 ( saha 2002 ) .",
    "this value can be much tightened when additional cases will be discovered .",
    "reliable distance indicators ( cepheids , tf distances of complete samples , and nearby cluster distances ) require a _ local _ value of @xmath107 .",
    "cepheid - calibrated sneia give a _",
    "large - scale _ value of @xmath108 .",
    "the two values are statistically indistinguishable and one may assume @xmath109 everywhere .",
    "the quoted error is only the statistical error .",
    "but the solution for @xmath45 is dominated by _ systematic _",
    "errors which could amount to as much as 10% .",
    "the largest systematic errors are introduced by cepheids , which form the basis of the local as well as of the large - scale expansion rate .",
    "equation  ( [ eq:12 ] ) suggests , in case of a non - linear form of the p - l relation of cepheids , that @xmath45 is increased by 6% for cepheids with a median period of 30 days , i.e.  a typical period for extra - local group galaxies .",
    "a metallicity dependence of the cepheid p - l relation could affect @xmath45 by @xmath110 ; if the metallicity correction of kennicutt et  al .",
    "( 1998 ) is taken at face value the effect would go in the direction of decreasing @xmath45 .",
    "the zero point of the p - l relation seems to be well determined ( table  [ tab:1 ] ) , but a systematic error of 3 - 4% can not be excluded .      the next important source of a systematic error  at least for the large - scale value of @xmath45  comes from the homogenization of sneia as to decline rate @xmath7 and color @xmath8 .",
    "in fact errors of the slope of the @xmath111 and @xmath112 relations could introduce systematic errors of the sneia distances of @xmath113 ( parodi et  al .",
    "2000 ) . this problem can entirely be solved if good photometry will be obtained for the many hundreds of sneia to be discovered within @xmath9 by gaia .",
    "this at the same time will yield irreplaceable distances to an equal number of field galaxies ( to within random errors of @xmath114 ) , which will outline any concerted deviations from pure hubble flow out to @xmath9 .",
    "the one remaining systematic error of @xmath115 comes from the difficult photometry of extra - local group cepheids with the wide - field camera ( wfpc-2 ) of hst .",
    "gaia can not offer a handle on this problem , and it has to await future photometry from space .",
    "gaia will not only much improve the value of @xmath45 , but also the age of the oldest objects .",
    "definitive distances to globular clusters will reduce the error of their ages , and the improvement of the distances of local group galaxies _ and _ the measurement of their proper motions are very important for the determination of the dynamical age of the local group ( lynden - bell 1999 ) .",
    "thus @xmath45 and a minimum age of the universe can be used as strong priors for the cmb fluctuation spectrum ( cf .",
    "netterfield et  al .",
    "2002 ; pryke 2001 ) which will narrow down the possible range of other cosmological parameters like the baryon density @xmath116 , the matter density @xmath117 , and the cosmological constant @xmath100 .",

    "_ it has become clear now that the p - l relation of galactic fundamental - mode cepheids is distinctly different from that in lmc .",
    "the galactic relation is quite steep , the short - period cepheids being fainter than in lmc and the long - period ones being brighter ( tammann , sandage , & reindl , in preparation ) .",
    "the non - uniqueness of the p - l relations  which is probably due , at least in part , to metallicity differences  greatly increases the need for fundamental distances of nearby galaxies from gaia .",

    "<S> the local expansion field ( @xmath0 ) _ and _ the cosmic expansion field out to @xmath1 are characterized by @xmath2[kms@xmath3mpc@xmath3 ] . while the random error of this determination is small ( @xmath5 units ) , it may still be affected by systematic errors as large as @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> the local expansion is outlined by cepheids and by cepheid - calibrated tf distances of a complete sample of field galaxies and by nearby groups and clusters ; the cosmic expansion is defined by cepheid - calibrated sneia . </S>",
    "<S> the main source of systematic errors are therefore the shape and the zero point of the p - l relation of cepheids and its possible dependence on metallicity . </S>",
    "<S> gaia will essentially eliminate these systematic error sources . </S>",
    "<S> another source of systematic error is due to the homogenization of sneia as to decline rate @xmath7 and color @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> gaia will discover about half of the 2200 sneia which will occur during a four - year lifetime within @xmath9 . for many of them </S>",
    "<S> ground - based follow - up will provide useful photometric parameters ( and spectra ) , which will allow to fix the dependence of the sneia luminosity on @xmath7 and @xmath8 with high accuracy . at the same time they will yield exquisite distances to a corresponding number of field galaxies . </S>",
    "<S>  gaia will also revolutionize the very local distance scale by determining fundamental distances of the companion galaxies of the milky way and even of some spirals in- and possibly outside the local group from their rotation curves seen in radial velocities and proper motions .    moreover , gaia will obtain trigonometric parallaxes of rr lyrae stars , of red giants defining the trgb , of stars on the zams , of white dwarf defining their cooling sequence , and of globular clusters , and determine the metallicity dependence of these distance indicators . </S>",
    "<S> it will thus establish a self - controlling network of distance indicators within the local group and beyond . </S>"
