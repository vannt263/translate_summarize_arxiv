    "during the last few years , remarkable progress has been made in probing the distant universe .",
    "this progress is driven in part by the availability of powerful new instruments at various wavelengths spanning the x - ray , near- , mid- and far - infrared , and submillimeter as well as out to the radio , which have complemented the traditional studies of galaxy evolution at @xmath13 based on uv / optical observations .",
    "a crucial advance is the discovery by far - infrared and submillimetre observations of a significant population of dusty starburst galaxies at high redshift with infrared luminosities @xmath14 , which are uligs with central activities ( agn or starburst ) .",
    "these objects are heavily hidden by dust extinction and are triggered either by violent mergers between gas rich objects or by encounters of galaxies @xcite .",
    "the formation rates for massive stars ( @xmath15 ) are approximately @xmath16 , assuming the bolometric luminosities of uligs are dominated by star formation activities @xcite .    another important clue to galaxy evolution",
    "is the population of optically faint , near - infrared bright extremely red objects ( eros ) often found as counterparts of sources identified in many other wavebands @xcite .",
    "the classifications of this population are divided between dusty starbursts and more evolved objects .",
    "morphological studies by hubble space telescope ( hst ) and ground - based near - infrared ( nir ) imaging show that active dusty eros are mostly disturbed systems , indicating mergers or galactic interactions could be the driving mechanisms for their behavior @xcite .",
    "the de - reddened star formation rates in these objects are in a range of @xmath17 , with far - infrared luminosities generally below @xmath18 . in these cases , near - infrared deep surveys , with detection sensitivity at least three magnitudes deeper than that of far - infrared and submillimeter surveys , can provide a possibility to unveil the high - z dusty starburst galaxies in a way complementary to the surveys at fir / submillimeter , which are only sensitive to the very bright infrared sources @xcite .",
    "nasa s new infrared facility @xmath0 , which brings significant improvements in ir sensitivity and survey efficiency over the previous deep infrared cosmological surveys , has produced deep new multi - wavelength number counts from @xmath2 to @xmath4 that provides a unique opportunity for galaxy evolution studies . because of their sensitivity to the prominent pah spectral features ( polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ) , @xmath0 as well as the infrared space observatory ( iso ) @xmath19 deep cosmological surveys can provide an unbiased view on the evolution of both uligs and ligs at the redshift range @xmath20 @xcite .",
    "although the initial phenomenological models fitted the unified iso/@xmath0 number counts well , they have been shown not to fit the source redshift distribution ( prez - gonzlez et al .",
    "this paper uses models based on a binary aggregation description of galaxy evolution to fit the new data and to provide a more complete test of our understanding of infrared galaxy evolution .    in section 2 of the paper",
    ", we will review our previous work .",
    "section 3 discusses the main features of the binary aggregation dynamics and the numerical simulation approach we use , which is centered on an infrared burst phase triggered by gas - rich mergers . a brief discussion of the construction of template spectra of dusty starburst galaxies is also given in this section .",
    "the model fitting to the recent @xmath0 results , as well as other available multi - band deep surveys spanning from near - infrared to radio wavelengths , and the estimation of the integrated background intensities are all presented in section 4 . in section 5 , we summarize our conclusions .",
    "the cosmological parameters @xmath21 and @xmath22 are adopted throughout .",
    "theoretical modelling of the evolution of dusty starburst galaxies constrained by both the observed cosmic infrared background and the number counts in far - infrared and submillimeter deep surveys by iras , iso , and scuba indicates a dramatic increase in the number density of ligs and uligs towards redshift @xmath23 @xcite .",
    "wang & biermann ( 2000 ) and wang ( 2002 ) discussed the effects of galaxy mergers on the strong evolution seen in these deep surveys in the context of a binary aggregation evolutionary scheme .",
    "the model requires that the infrared behavior be luminosity- and redshift - dependent with a significant population of dusty starburst galaxies or agns from gas rich mergers at redshift @xmath24 , and less luminous gas - poor objects at lower z. the infrared emission of more massive merging systems is taken to be enhanced to a higher level and to fade away faster than less massive systems within the merger time scale of a given epoch .",
    "this hypothesis is based on the observation that uligs are usually more than a factor of 20 brighter than normal starburst galaxies and it is consistent with the recent proposal for a `` downsizing formation scenario '' .",
    "the mechanism driving the strong evolution of infrared luminous sources is still unclear .",
    "it could be , for example , an increment of major/ minor merger rates , an upturn in the probability of minor tidal interactions , or an enrichment of cold gas toward high redshift .",
    "although visual morphological classifications of merger pairs is still very challenging , work by bell et al .",
    "( 2005 ) and shi et al .",
    "( 2005 ) shows that a decrease of the major - merger rate since redshift @xmath23 is probably not the dominant cause for the rapid decline in the cosmic star formation rate .",
    "this finding supports the prediction by wang & biermann ( 2000 ) , that sub - mjy sharp upturn in the far - infrared number counts diagram could not be interpreted solely by a merger rate decrease with cosmic time , but required a luminosity - dependent infrared burst phase from gas rich mergers at high redshift and gas poor mergers at low redshift .",
    "we hope that future sophisticated morphological studies from deep imaging as well as co mass determination from alma will allow such issues to be addressed more completely .",
    "although the details of the infrared burst phase are still unclear , it is believed to be related to a stage of the merger process when the dust mass and temperature are both dramatically increased @xcite .",
    "numerical simulations on the evolution of dusty starburst galaxies by bekki & shioya ( 2001 ) show that there is very strong photometric evolution during the merger process of two gas - rich disks , and a dramatic change of the sed around a cosmic time scale @xmath25 gyr , when the two merging disks become very close and suffer from violent relaxation .",
    "the star formation activities at this moment may reach a maximal rate of @xmath26yr@xmath27 .",
    "the infrared flux in this case increases by an order of magnitude , especially in the far - infrared ( @xmath28 ) in the emitting frame .",
    "however , such dramatic changes only occur for major mergers .",
    "episodic starburst phases are indicated by recent observations @xcite , and they may tend to smooth out the extreme maxima predicted in the models .",
    "our model is not restricted to major mergers . however , for simplicity , we assume in the current work that galactic interactions would trigger only a single infrared burst within a merger time scale and simulate a range of such interactions with a luminosity - dependent infrared burst phase in addition to the mass - light scaling relation of normal starburst galaxies . we believe that episodic bursts would not change the main results of this work , but will relax the requirements for a high fraction of mergers at high redshift .",
    "thus , the current work should be indicative of the overall pattern of infrared galaxy evolution regardless of the detailed time dependence of the star formation .",
    "the redshift distribution of uligs in the model of wang & biermann ( 2000 ) and wang ( 2002 ) shows a remarkable increase of the number density from the local universe up to redshift @xmath29 and a mild decrease towards still higher redshifts .",
    "we have found a similar result based on the study of the cosmic star formation history using x - ray deep surveys ( wang et al .",
    "this paper examines whether the evolution of the uligs observed in the iras and iso deep far - infrared surveys is still compatible with recent observations such as : 1 . ) in the @xmath30 radio band , which is itself a star formation indicator , and is an important way to study the evolution of starburst galaxies ; and 2 . )",
    "@xmath2 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 observations by @xmath33 , which are particularly useful for studying the evolution of the starburst population in the redshift range @xmath34 .",
    "another important rationale for this work is to try to learn more about the relevant physical processes .",
    "although near - infrared number counts , unlike mid- or far - infrared counts , would not provide strong constraints on the star formation activities in our modelling , we include here a comparison of our modelling with the results of near - infrared deep surveys , to get an estimate of the fraction of stellar mass contained in these starburst merging galaxies to the total stellar mass budget in the universe .    with model constraints ranging from near - infrared out to deep radio surveys , we have constructed an overall model for both uligs and ligs that evolves in a continuous way , based on a merger triggered starburst scenario .",
    "this approach differs from other models that assume uligs evolve separately from ligs and with an extremely strong evolutionary rate .",
    "we describe the modelling algorithm briefly in this section .",
    "readers are referred to wang & biermann ( 2000 ) and references therein for the details of the binary aggregation dynamics and the numerical techniques .",
    "an aggregation phenomenon based on the smoluchowski ( 1916 ) equation is adopted in the model to trace the evolution of the mass distribution function with cosmic time , which is in the form of :    @xmath35    @xmath36 is the mass distribution function in the `` comoving '' frame .",
    "the kernel @xmath37 reflects the interaction rate for each pair of masses @xmath38 , and depends on the mechanism and environment of such aggregations .",
    "@xmath39 is the density of galaxies ; @xmath40 is the relative velocity of the interacting pairs , and @xmath41 is the cross section . in aggregation dynamics , the interaction kernel @xmath42 is the key point for driving the whole evolutionary process , which depends strongly on the environmental structures .",
    "however , the determination of the interaction kernel suffers from various uncertainties and complexities .",
    "we shall adopt in this model a simplified formula for the aggregation kernel @xmath43 with separated time evolution and cross section terms as below :    @xmath44.\\ ] ]    where @xmath45 reflects the evolution of the aggregation rate with cosmic time .",
    "the free parameter @xmath46 depends on the specific structures and interacting environments .",
    "a range of values is discussed by cavaliere & menci ( 1997 ) for groups , clusters and large scale structures .",
    "the second free parameter is @xmath47 , which describes the relative importance of two kinds of encounters ( geometric collisions and focused resonant interactions ) in the cross section .",
    "the aggregation time scale @xmath48 is inversely proportional to the interaction kernel @xmath43 i.e. , @xmath49 .",
    "a monte carlo inverse - cascading process is used to simulate the binary aggregation of galaxies described by eq .",
    "( [ von ] ) .",
    "this equation has been solved in a number of cases @xcite , which show that the dynamical process does not strongly depend on the initial conditions , i.e. the mass spectrum is independent of initial details with self - similar evolution . for this study",
    ", we adopted a @xmath50-function at @xmath51 as an initial mass spectrum ( so dwarfs are included in the new calculation ) and start the simulation from redshift @xmath52 . in the previous studies , we had set the initial mass to @xmath53 .",
    "other model parameters of the dynamical processes are discussed in detail by wang & biermann ( 2000 ) and are still valid for the current modelling .    up to now , the mass distribution function @xmath36 could be derived from the smoluchowski equation using the monte carlo simulation . however , to compare the modelling with various observational constraints , such as luminosity functions of galaxies in general or with the morphologies , source counts , redshift distributions and background intensities from multi - band surveys , we need to understand the conversion of the mass distribution function @xmath36 to the observable luminosity function @xmath54 , as well as the modelling of a luminosity - dependent infrared burst phase from gas - rich mergers , all of which are described in detail by wang & biermann ( 1998 , 2000 ) and wang ( 1999 , 2002 ) . we summarize several main points as follows .",
    "a simple prescription of the mass - light ratio for the faint blue galaxies is given by cavaliere & menci ( 1997 ) as @xmath55 ( @xmath56 is the local standard characteristic luminosity with the corresponding mass @xmath57 ) . here ,",
    "@xmath58 if the cross section is purely geometrical ; this value is consistent with the observational results by kormendy ( 1990 ) .",
    "@xmath59 can be used to describe redshift dimming or luminosity evolution . simplifying the color and k- corrections ,",
    "we get roughly that @xmath60 . we assume in our model an infrared to optical color ratio @xmath61 ( @xmath62",
    "is adopted in the calculation ) .",
    "this value is consistent with both the numerical calculations of the photometric and spectroscopic evolution of dusty starburst galaxies , and with the current understanding of the uligs , which are believed to be the extremely luminous infrared burst phase due to starburst merger events where the far - infrared luminosity , @xmath63 , is enhanced both by accumulation of dust and by an increase in the dust temperature .",
    "this burst phase can enhance the infrared luminosity by a factor of about 20 over that of normal starburst galaxies @xcite .",
    "we adopt @xmath64 , @xmath65 in the modelling .",
    "a value of @xmath66 after a transition redshift @xmath29 gives the best fit , which successfully interprets the sharp upturn at the faint end of far - infrared number counts .",
    "in addition , choosing @xmath29 as a transition redshift , with gas rich mergers at @xmath13 and gas poor mergers at @xmath67 , is also consistent with the cosmic time scale at @xmath29 , which is about @xmath68 years , approximately the time scale for disk evolution .",
    "galaxies may become gas poor during this stage .",
    "the scaling factor of the mass - light ratio is normalized by the local luminosity function from the iras survey .    except for understanding the physical basis for the two major free parameters in the interaction kernel ( @xmath69 and @xmath70 ) , which we adjust in the simulation to give a good fit to the current observations , the uncertainties in the relative emission over the radiation spectrum across cosmic time as galaxies evolve , including progressive evolution and episodic starburst activities triggered by galactic interactions etc .",
    ", are now the major challenges to galaxy evolution studies . with only number counts , redshift distributions , and integrated background levels , which are rather loose constraints , we simply assume a luminosity dependent infrared burst phase after a transition redshift , to mimic the change of the sed shapes ( especially in the far - infrared ) for galaxies with different luminosities .",
    "we simulate such an effect by adding a scaling factor @xmath71 to the luminosity evolution term defined in the last paragraph ( @xmath65 ) , where @xmath72 is the minimal luminosity bin of the calculated luminosity function .",
    "the best fit result gives @xmath73 at far infrared wavelengths .",
    "this luminosity dependent infrared burst reflects a physical reality , that the infrared luminous galaxies at the bright tail of the luminosity function become gas poor faster than the less luminous ones and fade away quickly within the merger time scale of that epoch .",
    "this behavior is consistent with the current concept of a `` downsizing formation scenario '' .",
    "in addition , it indicates that less luminous infrared sources , such as ligs , could have infrared burst phases persisting longer than those of uligs .",
    "in fact , we can describe such an idea with an infrared burst  duty circle , \" @xmath74 .",
    "this term is based on expressing the duration of the infrared burst phase in terms of the merger time scale , @xmath75 , where @xmath76 is the starburst time scale and @xmath77 the merging time scale .",
    "learning from observations , we have @xmath78 and @xmath79 .",
    "therefore , we can derive an empirical relation @xmath80 . from the discussion above",
    ", we now understand that this luminosity dependent infrared burst phase is actually implicitly related to the starburst time scale .      while the basic concepts of our model are clearly plausible , the details of the necessary assumptions are somewhat arbitrary .",
    "however , it seems that they are very important for fitting the sharp upturn at faint flux levels in the current deep far - infrared surveys . for a detailed comparision with the color behavior vs. flux densitiy , we shall in the future include a real physical model including both proper chemical evolution and dust emission properties .    in the current calculations , starburst galaxies ,",
    "dust shrouded agns and `` non - evolving '' galaxies are treated separately as three major classes of infrared emitting sources .",
    "the `` non - evolving '' galaxies represent the big spiral and elliptical galaxies , which were already in place about 8 gyr ago and are considered to have a fixed luminosity function with cosmic time @xcite .",
    "we know from recent work by hammer et al .",
    "( 2005 ) that some intermediate - mass spiral galaxies may have experienced starburst phases due to galactic interactions , which are counted within the starburst population triggered by galactic mergers / interactions in our calculation .",
    "although the treatment of the three populations separately in the modelling is a bit arbitrary , this simplification should not affect the current results significantly .    unlike other models that assume uligs evolve separately from ligs and with an extremely strong evolutionary rate",
    ", we prefer to think that merger - triggered infrared luminous sources including both uligs and ligs exhibit a continuous evolution , where the infrared emission of uligs may change more rapidly than that of less luminous sources ( i.e. ligs may have a longer infrared burst duration than that of uligs ) .",
    "we simulate such a continuous range of evolution by assuming a luminosity dependent infrared burst phase based on the consideration of different time scales for the starburst galaxies of different infrared luminosities to consume the cool gas .",
    "the agn component is included as an additional model constraint , since the dust enshrouded geometry could result in significant radiation from them at infrared wavelengths .",
    "we assume agn activities are triggered by galactic mergers or interactions based on the aggregation dynamics , similar to the starburst population .",
    "the statistics of the starburst and agn populations are normalized by the observed local luminosity function of starburst galaxies at @xmath81 from saunders ( 1990 ) and that of seyferts from rush et al .",
    "the abundance of dust - shrouded agns is very uncertain , especially for those dust enshrouded qsos at high redshift . for the models",
    ", we set the abundances of the dust - shrouded agns relative to the total agn population to be @xmath82 and @xmath83 at local and high redshift , respectively , based on the statistics from hubble space telescope imaging survey of nearby agns and the cosmic x - ray background @xcite .      to construct a template spectrum for the high redshift dusty starburst sources around redshift @xmath29 , we utilize the publicly available program grasil introduced by granato and silva to produce a library of seds .",
    "we replace the pah features with a template for pah emission based on rest - frame @xmath84 spectra of arp220 and m82 ( weedman et al .",

    "a third template , the sed of m51 , is assumed for the spiral population .",
    "an important change has been made in our current modelling , compared with our earlier work ( wang 2002 ) .",
    "previously , only a simple template sed ( without specific consideration of pah features ) was assigned for the whole infrared luminous starburst population , rather than the separate seds for ligs , and uligs . to give a good fit to the new @xmath0 results",
    ", it requires adjustment of the merger rate especially at higher redshifts and of the free parameters in the prescription of the infrared burst phase .",
    "this probably contributes significantly to the better fits we achieve for the redshift distributions of the infrared sources compared with previous efforts that have assumed a single sed ( e.g. , lagache et al . 2004 ) .",
    "we choose the template spectrum for the obscured agns at low redshift to be that of ngc 1068 , and the unobscured ones that of the mean sed of a seyfert i. the early phases of these agns are assumed to show typical spectra such as the dust shrouded f10214 + 4724 , and a phase poor in cold gas like the cloverleaf quasar .",

    "although our modelling fits the full suite of available data well , it is not likely to be unique . to break the degeneracies in the model and make further progress requires both a better understanding of the infrared burst phase , and more accurate merger rate statistics . with the existing model constraints such as number counts , redshift distributions and background intensities ,",
    "it is still very difficult to address such issues in detail and give an independent estimation of the model parameters .",
    "a real physical model including both proper chemical evolution and dust emission properties should be used in future work , for a better understanding of both the emission properties and dynamical processes of the dusty starburst merging galaxies across cosmic time .",
