    "about 30 years ago , cohen and lenstra @xcite launched a heuristic study of the distribution of class groups of number fields . to focus the discussion ,",
    "we restrict to a specialized setting .",
    "let @xmath0 be an odd prime . among the numerous insights contained in the work of cohen and lenstra ,",
    "let us single out two and draw a distinction between them : ( 1 ) there is a natural probability distribution on the category of finite abelian @xmath0-groups for which the measure of each @xmath9 is proportional to the reciprocal of the size of @xmath10 ; and ( 2 ) the distribution of the @xmath0-part of class groups of imaginary quadratic fields is the same as the cohen - lenstra distribution of finite abelian @xmath0-groups .",
    "the first statement , a purely group - theoretic one , is quite accessible and , indeed , in the first part of @xcite , cohen and lenstra prove many beautiful facts about the distribution of more general modules ( not just over @xmath11 but more generally over rings of integers of number fields ) .",
    "the second , and bolder , insight is much less accessible at present but leads to striking number - theoretic predictions , only a small number of which have been proven , but all of which agree with extensive numerical data .",
    "note that ( 2 ) quantifies the notion that the ( rather elementary ) necessary conditions for a group to occur as the @xmath0-part of the class group of an imaginary quadratic field - namely that it be a ( finite ) abelian @xmath0-group - should also be sufficient .    in the decades since the publication of @xcite ,",
    "the application of ( 1 ) has been broadened to a number of other situations .",
    "it should be noted , however , that there are many circumstances where the weighting factor should also involve some power of the order of @xmath9 .",
    "this includes recent investigations into variation of tate - shafarevich groups , variation of @xmath0-class tower groups ( @xmath0 odd ) for real quadratic fields ( to be described in a subsequent paper by the authors ) and variation in presentations of @xmath0-groups as described in @xcite .",
    "the case under consideration in the current paper , however , does not involve these extra factors .",
    "as regards the combination of ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) , one can speak of a `` cohen - lenstra strategy , '' perhaps , as follows .",
    "suppose we have a sequence @xmath12 of @xmath0-groups ( arising as invariants attached to some kind of arithmetic objects , say ) . one can hope to identify a category @xmath13 of groups in which the sequence lies and to define a probability measure on that space for which the measure of each group @xmath9 is proportional to @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is a suitable function and @xmath16 is the set of automorphisms of @xmath9 in the category @xmath13 .",
    "the cohen - lenstra philosophy then would say that , assuming the sequence @xmath17 is sufficiently general and the category @xmath13 is correctly chosen , the frequency with which any object @xmath9 of @xmath13 occurs in the sequence @xmath17 , defined to be the limit @xmath18 assuming it exists , is just the same as the cohen - lenstra measure of @xmath9 in the category @xmath13 . here",
    ", @xmath19 is the characteristic function of @xmath9 , taking the value @xmath20 if @xmath21 is isomorphic to @xmath9 ( in the category @xmath13 ) and @xmath22 otherwise . in such a situation , we can speak of the sequence @xmath23 `` obeying a cohen - lenstra distribution for the category @xmath13 . ''    as just some of the examples of applications of this philosophy we cite cohen - martinet @xcite , wittman @xcite , and boston - ellenberg @xcite . in the first two of these ,",
    "the class groups are in fact studied as modules over the group ring of the galois group . in @xcite , the groups under study are non - abelian , and in fact the situation is slightly different because the base field is fixed ( to be @xmath24 ) and the ramifiying set varies ; however the essential cohen - lenstra idea appears to apply in that situation also .      in this article",
    ", we consider a non - abelian extension of the number - theoretic objects studied by cohen and lenstra , passing from the @xmath0-part of the class group of an imaginary quadratic field @xmath1 ( we continue to assume @xmath0 is odd ) to the pro-@xmath0 fundamental group of the ring of integers of @xmath1 , namely the galois group of its maximal everywhere unramified @xmath0-extension . for brevity ,",
    "henceforth we will refer to these groups as `` @xmath0-class tower groups . '' the key fact , as pointed out in koch - venkov @xcite , is that @xmath0-class tower groups ( and certain of their quotients ) must satisfy a `` schur @xmath7 '' condition ; the precise definitions are given below .",
    "we establish that there is a natural cohen - lenstra measure in the category of schur @xmath7-groups .",
    "our main heuristic assumption then is that for the sequence of @xmath0-class tower groups of imaginary quadratic fields , ordered by discriminant , or more generally for the sequence of maximal @xmath0-class @xmath6 quotients of these @xmath0-class tower groups ( where @xmath6 is any fixed whole number ) , the frequency of any given group equals the measure of the group in a corresponding category of schur @xmath7-groups .",
    "to describe our situation in more detail , we specify some notation to be used throughout the paper . for a pro-@xmath0 group @xmath9 ,",
    "we write @xmath25 and @xmath26 , where the action of @xmath9 on @xmath27 is trivial ; these give , respectively , the generator rank and relation rank of @xmath9 as a pro-@xmath0 group .",
    "the frattini subgroup of @xmath9 , @xmath28 , is defined to be the closure of @xmath29g^p$ ] .",
    "the groups @xmath30}$ ] and @xmath31 are , respectively , the maximal abelian quotient and maximal exponent-@xmath0 abelian quotient of @xmath9 .    for an imaginary quadratic field @xmath1 , we let @xmath32 be the @xmath0-sylow subgroup of the ideal class group of @xmath1 .",
    "if we allow @xmath1 to vary over all imaginary quadratic fields , ordered according to increasing absolute value of the discriminant @xmath33 , the groups @xmath32 fluctuate with no immediately apparent rhyme or reason , but regarding their cumulative behavior , cohen and lenstra asked what can be said about the frequency with which a given group would occur as @xmath32 for some @xmath1 .",
    "their heuristic , described above , led them to many predictions , one of which is the following conjecture .",
    "[ cohenlenstra ] for a fixed positive integer @xmath34 , among the imaginary quadratic fields @xmath1 such that @xmath35 has rank @xmath34 , ordered by discriminant , the probability that @xmath35 is isomorphic to @xmath36 is @xmath37    since this statement is not explicitly in the cohen - lenstra papers , let us point out how it follows immediately from their work .",
    "it is a theorem of hall @xcite and , in a more general context , of cohen - lenstra ( cor .",
    "3.8 of @xcite ) , that the sum of @xmath38 as @xmath9 runs over all isomorphism classes of abelian @xmath0-groups is @xmath39 we also have , see p.  56 of @xcite , that the probability that an abelian @xmath0-group has generator rank @xmath34 is @xmath40 thus , under the cohen - lenstra distribution , for a given abelian @xmath0-group @xmath9 , the probability that an abelian @xmath0-group of generator rank @xmath34 is isomorphic to @xmath9 is given by the quantity in conjecture [ cohenlenstra ] .",
    "cohen - lenstra s fundamental heuristic assumption then yields conjecture [ cohenlenstra ] .    to describe how we pass to a non - abelian generalization , recall that if @xmath41 is the @xmath0-hilbert class field of @xmath1 , defined to be its maximal abelian unramified @xmath0-extension , then there is a canonical isomorphism @xmath42 given by the artin reciprocity map .",
    "now , let us consider the field @xmath3 obtained by taking the compositum of _ all _ finite unramified @xmath0-extensions of @xmath1 , not just the abelian ones .",
    "we put @xmath43 .",
    "it is clear that the maximal abelian quotient of @xmath4 is isomorphic to @xmath32 and by burnside @xmath44 .",
    "the central question we consider in this work is : for a fixed odd prime @xmath0 , as @xmath1 varies over all imaginary quadratic fields of ascending absolute value of discriminant , what can one say about the variation of the groups @xmath4 ?    naturally , this is a more difficult question than the variation of class groups , even for venturing a guess .",
    "already , the group @xmath4 is not always finite .",
    "indeed , in @xcite , koch and venkov proved that @xmath4 is infinite if @xmath45 ; they did so by taking into account all the facts they had at their disposal about the group @xmath4 .",
    "namely , @xmath4 is a finitely generated pro-@xmath0 group with finite abelianization and deficiency @xmath22 ( meaning that @xmath46 ) and admits an automorphism of order @xmath47 which acts as inversion on its abelianization ( complex conjugation is such an automorphism , for example ) . since having zero deficiency is equivalent to having trivial schur multiplier in this context , koch and venkov dubbed groups having this particular set of properties `` schur @xmath7-groups . '' in section 2 , we review some of the work of koch and venkov , introduce schur @xmath7-groups , and assign a cohen - lenstra type measure for schur @xmath7-groups and some of their quotients .    insight ( 2 ) of cohen and lenstra was that the most fundamental restriction on the @xmath0-part of the class group , namely that it is a finite abelian @xmath0-group , appears to be the _ only _ restriction on it . in just the same way , positing our main heuristic assumption that a finite @xmath0-group @xmath9 arises as a @xmath0-class tower group over an imaginary quadratic field with the same frequency as @xmath9 occurs as a randomly chosen group among schur @xmath7-groups , in section  3 we arrive at the following conjecture , which should be compared to the cohen - lenstra conjecture above .",
    "[ our - conjecture ] suppose @xmath9 is a finite @xmath0-group which is a schur @xmath7-group of generator rank @xmath48 or , more generally , suppose @xmath6 is a positive integer and @xmath9 is the maximal @xmath0-class @xmath6 quotient of a schur @xmath7-group .",
    "then , among the imaginary quadratic fields @xmath1 such that @xmath32 has rank @xmath34 , ordered by discriminant , the probability that @xmath49 ( or in the fixed @xmath0-class case , the maximal @xmath0-class @xmath6 quotient of @xmath8 ) is isomorphic to @xmath9 is equal to @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the difference between the @xmath0-multiplicator rank and nuclear rank of @xmath9 ( so @xmath52 with @xmath53 for schur @xmath7-groups ) and @xmath54 is the number of fixed points of an automorphism @xmath7 acting as inversion on the abelianization of @xmath9 .",
    "we note that the quantity @xmath54 is independent of the choice of @xmath7 . for more details about this and other quantities that appear in the conjecture",
    "we refer the reader to section  2 . comparing the form of conjectures [ cohenlenstra ] and [ our - conjecture ]",
    ", we note that in the case of @xmath9 being a schur @xmath7-group , the two predicted frequencies differ only by a factor of @xmath55 ; we give an explanation for this factor in theorem [ sigma - automorphism ] .",
    "note that for abelian groups @xmath9 , we have @xmath56 , hence the two formulae match and indeed , suitably interpreted , conjecture [ our - conjecture ] generalizes conjecture [ cohenlenstra ] .      as theoretical evidence for their conjecture , cohen and lenstra were able to show that a relatively cheap consequence of their heuristic assumption , namely the prediction that the average value of @xmath57 ( as @xmath1 ranges over all imaginary quadratic fields ) is @xmath47 , is in fact a highly non - trivial theorem of davenport and heilbronn @xcite .",
    "in more recent work , for example see @xcite , bhargava and his students have obtained deep refinements and extensions of the davenport - heilbronn result , in particular verifying further consequences of the cohen - lenstra and cohen - martinet conjectures .    as regards numerical evidence ,",
    "class groups of imaginary quadratic fields can be computed via an efficient algorithm , and so the class group computations available to cohen and lenstra were quite extensive . in @xcite , they derived many consequences of their heuristic , every one of which matched and in some cases even `` explained '' the _ observed _ variation of the @xmath0-part of the class group of imaginary quadratic fields .    in our non - abelian situation , we do not even know an algorithm for determining whether @xmath4 is finite , much less for computing it , and few examples have actually been completely worked out , so the numerical investigation of our heuristic is bound to be more tricky .",
    "one of the first examples of a computation of @xmath4 in the literature appears in a 1934 article of scholz and taussky @xcite : for the field @xmath58 , with @xmath59 , @xmath32 is elementary abelian of rank 2 and the group @xmath4 has size @xmath60 and is isomorphic to the group denoted smallgroup(243,5 ) in the terminology of the computer algebra software package .",
    "the method of boston and leedham - green @xcite can be used for certain @xmath1 to produce a short list of candidates for the isomorphism class of @xmath4 .    in order to test our heuristic hypothesis , we considered what kind of number - theoretical data ( meaning about the groups @xmath4 ) was within reach and settled on the following : we computed the class groups of unramified extensions of @xmath1 of degree @xmath20 or @xmath0 . in terms of group theory ,",
    "this `` index @xmath61 abelianization data '' or `` ipad , '' describes the abelianization of @xmath4 as well as those of its index @xmath0 subgroups . though it is impractical at present to attempt the complete computation of @xmath4 for all but a handful of fields @xmath1 , it was possible for us to compute the ipads of quite a few such @xmath0-class tower groups and to compare them to the group - theoretical prediction .",
    "as summary of the numerical evidence , the last two columns of table  [ last - table ] in section  5 list the observed and predicted frequencies of the most common ipads . given the variability of the data and the general convergence trend toward the predicted value , we believe that , within the limitations of the computation , the data supports our conjecture .      as in @xcite , we have separated the group theory , where we have theorems , from the number theory , where we mostly make conjectures and collect data .",
    "we develop some basic facts about schur @xmath7-groups in section 2 and give a precise formulation of our conjecture describing the variation of galois groups of @xmath0-towers of imaginary quadratic fields in section 3 .",
    "the distribution of ipads of schur @xmath7-groups is investigated in section 4 .",
    "this investigation yields a number of results which we prove using a mixture of theory and computation , thanks to the powerful technique of organizing @xmath0-groups via obrien s @xmath0-group generation algorithm @xcite .",
    "finally , the number - theoretical data we have collected is summarized in section 5 .",
    "all of the computations were done using the symbolic algebra package  @xcite .",
    "we fix an odd prime @xmath0 . as indicated in the introduction , we are interested in the following family of groups .    a finitely generated pro-@xmath0 group @xmath9 is called a schur @xmath7-group of rank @xmath34 if it satisfies the following properties : 1 ) @xmath62 ; 2 ) @xmath63 is finite ; 3 ) there exists an element @xmath64 of order @xmath47 acting as inversion on @xmath63 .",
    "we will also want to consider certain special finite quotients of these groups , namely their maximal quotients of a fixed @xmath0-class . to define this , let @xmath65 and , for @xmath66 , @xmath67 denote the ( closed ) subgroup generated by @xmath68 $ ] and @xmath69 .",
    "the groups @xmath70 form a descending chain of characteristic subgroups of @xmath9 called the lower @xmath0-central series .",
    "note that @xmath71 is the frattini subgroup @xmath28 .",
    "the @xmath0-class @xmath6 of a finite @xmath0-group @xmath9 is the smallest @xmath72 for which @xmath73 . if @xmath74 is a normal subgroup of @xmath9 , and @xmath75 has @xmath0-class @xmath76 , then @xmath77 .",
    "thus , if @xmath9 has @xmath0-class @xmath6 , then for @xmath78 , the maximal @xmath0-class @xmath76 quotient of @xmath9 is @xmath79",
    ". it will be important for us to give much consideration to the maximal @xmath0-class @xmath76 quotients of schur @xmath7-groups so we make the following definition .",
    "let @xmath9 be a finite @xmath0-group of @xmath0-class @xmath6 .",
    "we say that @xmath9 is _ schur _ ( or _ schur of _",
    "@xmath6 ) if it is the maximal @xmath0-class @xmath6 quotient of a schur @xmath7-group .",
    "suppose @xmath9 has @xmath0-class @xmath6 .",
    "a pro-@xmath0 group @xmath21 satisfying @xmath80 is called a _ descendant _ of @xmath9 and if , additionally , @xmath21 has @xmath0-class @xmath81 , then @xmath21 is called a _ child _ , or _ immediate descendant _ , of @xmath9 .",
    "obrien @xcite produced an algorithm that computes all children ( and so ultimately all descendants ) of a given @xmath0-group .",
    "he also highlighted the importance of two invariants of a @xmath0-group @xmath9 for his algorithm , namely its @xmath0-multiplicator rank and its nuclear rank .",
    "the first minus the second is always nonnegative and does not exceed @xmath82 for any descendant @xmath21 of @xmath9 ( prop .  2 of @xcite ) .",
    "if a group has nuclear rank @xmath22 , then it has no children and is called _",
    "terminal_. a schur group of @xmath0-class @xmath6 which is terminal has no proper descendants but must be @xmath83 for some schur @xmath7-group @xmath21 ; hence it is a schur @xmath7-group .",
    "thus , terminal schur groups are always schur @xmath7-groups . in the other direction , in the appendix ( where basic definitions and facts about the @xmath0-multiplicator and nucleus are provided )",
    ", blackhurst proves that a @xmath0-group with trivial schur multiplier must be terminal ; this is a result to which several authors have referred , but there appears to be no proof in the literature . since schur @xmath7-groups satisfy @xmath84 , they have trivial schur multiplier , hence finite schur @xmath7-groups are terminal . in summary ,",
    "terminal schur groups are the same as finite schur @xmath7-groups .",
    "suppose @xmath9 is schur of @xmath0-class @xmath6 so that @xmath85 for some schur @xmath7-group @xmath21 .",
    "a choice of order 2 element @xmath86 which acts as inversion on @xmath87 induces an involution on @xmath9 , ( which , by abuse of notation , we will also call @xmath7 ) because the subgroup @xmath88 is a characteristic subgroup of @xmath21 . moreover , this automorphism of @xmath9 acts as inversion on @xmath63 .",
    "thus , a schur group @xmath9 is a schur @xmath7-group if and only if @xmath84 . using refinements of the theorem of golod and shafarevich ,",
    "koch and venkov showed @xcite that schur @xmath7-groups of rank at least 3 are always infinite .",
    "much of our work will therefore focus on the case of rank @xmath47 finite schur @xmath7-groups .",
    "we now fix @xmath48 , and let @xmath89 denote the free pro-@xmath0 group on @xmath34 generators @xmath90 .",
    "let @xmath7 be the automorphism of @xmath89 induced by the assignment @xmath91 for @xmath92 .",
    "koch and venkov showed that the relations of a schur @xmath7-group can always be chosen to lie in @xmath93 this is a subset of @xmath94 and in fact these two sets coincide , as we will see in a moment .",
    "first , just a bit more notation ; for each positive integer @xmath6 , we define @xmath95    [ lemma - coincide ] with notation as above , we have @xmath96 and @xmath97 for all @xmath5 .    first , note that @xmath98 and so @xmath99 .",
    "second , note that @xmath100 is closed since it is the image of a compact set under a continuous map and that @xmath101 is closed since it is defined by equality of two continuous functions in a hausdorff space .",
    "since both sets are closed , it is sufficient to show that @xmath102 for all @xmath5 .",
    "note that @xmath103 and @xmath104 are _ finite _ sets .",
    "as above , we have @xmath105 .",
    "define a map @xmath106 by @xmath107 .",
    "since @xmath0 is odd , this is injective , which establishes that @xmath97 .",
    "the sets @xmath108 and @xmath100 are closed and hence measurable .",
    "furthermore , given a schur @xmath7-group @xmath9 of rank @xmath34 , we can consider the set of ordered @xmath34-tuples taken from @xmath100 such that the pro-@xmath0 group presented by these elements is isomorphic to @xmath9 .",
    "denote this set @xmath109 .",
    "it is a closed , and hence measurable , subset of @xmath110 .",
    "we denote its relative measure , i.e. the measure of @xmath109 divided by that of @xmath110 , by @xmath111 .",
    "this represents the proportion of ways in which schur - type relations present @xmath9 .",
    "we can perform this computation in a more effective way by considering schur groups , not just schur @xmath7-groups .",
    "namely , if @xmath9 is schur of @xmath0-class @xmath6 and has generator rank @xmath34 , then we let @xmath112 denote the set of ordered @xmath34-tuples taken from @xmath103 that present @xmath9 as a quotient of @xmath113 and define @xmath111 to be the measure of @xmath112 divided by that of @xmath114 .",
    "note that the definition of @xmath111 for schur groups of @xmath0-class @xmath6 is more general but is consistent with the definition for schur @xmath7-groups .",
    "moreover , as a result , we have given a finite algorithm for computing @xmath115 and exhibited this quantity as a rational number .",
    "as an example , let @xmath59 and consider the finite @xmath47-generated @xmath116-groups of @xmath116-class @xmath47 . obrien s algorithm yields @xmath117 such groups , of which @xmath116 are schur . in this case",
    "@xmath118 has order @xmath119 and we calculate that the set @xmath120 is an elementary abelian subgroup of order @xmath121 . of these @xmath116 schur groups , the one of order @xmath122 - call it @xmath123",
    "- arises when the ordered @xmath47-tuple taken from @xmath120 generates @xmath120 .",
    "this happens for @xmath124 of the @xmath125 ordered @xmath47-tuples .",
    "thus @xmath126 .",
    "the second group , of order @xmath125 - call it @xmath127 - arises when the ordered @xmath47-tuple generates one of the @xmath128 subgroups of @xmath120 of order @xmath116 .",
    "each of these 4 subgroups is generated by 8 of the @xmath125 ordered @xmath47-tuples in @xmath129 ; hence , @xmath130 .",
    "the third group , of order @xmath60 - call it @xmath131 - is @xmath118 itself and arises when both entries in the @xmath47-tuple are trivial .",
    "therefore , @xmath132 .",
    "note that there are two other @xmath47-generated @xmath116-groups of @xmath116-class @xmath47 that have a generator - inverting automorphism , namely @xmath133 and @xmath134 .",
    "these groups arise as quotients of schur @xmath7-groups ( indeed all the groups above are quotients of @xmath131 ) but not as @xmath135 for any schur @xmath7-group @xmath9 and so are not schur groups .",
    "these groups even have the difference between their @xmath0-multiplicator rank and nuclear rank equal to @xmath47 and so are hard to distinguish from schur groups .",
    "we refer to such groups as pseudo - schur .",
    "these arise elsewhere , although rarely since in the situations we are considering , all the children of a group typically have the same order and so one can not be a proper quotient of another .",
    "as an example , @xmath136 , introduced below in section 4 , has @xmath47 schur and @xmath47 pseudo - schur children , which are quotients of one of the schur children by subgroups of order @xmath116 fixed by the schur automorphism .    in the above example",
    ", @xmath103 happened to be a subgroup ; in general , @xmath100 and @xmath103 are not subgroups but we can still obtain explicit formulae for @xmath111 .",
    "suppose @xmath9 is a schur group of generator rank @xmath34 and @xmath0-class @xmath6 .",
    "we let @xmath137 be the relation rank of @xmath9 in the category of rank @xmath34 , @xmath0-class @xmath6 schur groups .",
    "this quantity satisfies @xmath138 and is the amount by which the multiplicator rank of @xmath9 exceeds the nuclear rank of @xmath9 .",
    "if @xmath9 happens to be a schur @xmath7-group , then @xmath139 is also the relation rank of @xmath9 in the category of pro-@xmath0 groups .",
    "we define @xmath54 to be the number of fixed points of an automorphism @xmath7 of @xmath9 which acts as inversion on its maximal abelian quotient .",
    "this quantity depends only on the group @xmath9 , not on the choice of automorphism @xmath7 .    the",
    "reason @xmath54 depends only on @xmath9 is that , as shown by hall ( section 1.3 of @xcite ) , although sometimes attributed to burnside , the kernel from @xmath140 is a pro-@xmath0 group and so by schur - zassenhaus ( e.g. prop .",
    "1.1 of @xcite ) , all lifts of order @xmath47 of the inversion automorphism on @xmath31 are conjugate to each other .    [ main - group - theory ] let @xmath9 be schur of rank @xmath34 and put @xmath141 .",
    "then @xmath142    we compute the proportion of @xmath34-tuples of relators in @xmath108 that present @xmath9 following the strategy in  @xcite , and then modify this to obtain @xmath111 .",
    "first we count the number of epimorphisms from @xmath89 to @xmath9 .",
    "then we use this to count the number of normal subgroups @xmath143 in @xmath89 such that @xmath144 .    for a finite group @xmath145 ,",

    "computing dimensions of the first three factors of the jennings series , we observe that every schur descendant of @xmath123 has its relations at this depth . the apparent combinatorial explosion in descendants of @xmath302 then casts doubt on the `` if '' part of mcleman s conjecture .    as for schur descendants of @xmath127 , those not having both relations at depth @xmath116 are precisely those descended from @xmath349 .",
    "the combinatorial explosion in descendants of these groups lends support to the `` only if '' part of mcleman s conjecture .",
    "one might ask for the probability that a @xmath47-generated schur @xmath7-@xmath116-group is finite . searching through the tree , we find @xmath350 descendants of @xmath123 that are schur @xmath7-groups of @xmath116-class at most @xmath292 , @xmath351 descendants of @xmath127 that are schur @xmath7-groups of @xmath116-class at most @xmath352 , and @xmath353 descendants of @xmath131 that are schur @xmath7-groups of @xmath116-class at most @xmath117 .",

    "it is natural , in the spirit of golod and shafarevich , to conjecture that `` large '' ipads will correspond only to infinite groups , but one must be careful . extending the above census slightly , we find that @xmath356 has schur @xmath7-group descendants of @xmath116-class @xmath121 and order @xmath357 with ipad @xmath358 ;    [ 3,3,3,81],[3,729]^3 ] $ ] .",
    "thus , having a rank @xmath128 subgroup of index @xmath116 ( the highest rank possible by comparison with the free group ) is not sufficient to imply that the schur @xmath7-group is infinite .",

    "our conjecture indicates that the total measure carried by all non - fab schur @xmath7-groups should be zero . whilst we have not yet proven this , evidence for it is provided both by the fact that infinite abelian groups account for zero of the original cohen - lenstra measure and by the above conjecture , which indicates that groups with abelianization @xmath268 $ ] and with an index @xmath116 subgroup with infinite abelianization account for zero of our measure .",

    "the computations took place over a 10-month period although there were some short breaks when some or all of the cores were not in use .",
    "experimentation early on indicated a large amount of variation in the running times for the class group computations so the decision was made to set an arbitrary upper limit of 200 hours on each individual computation ( although part way through the fifth interval of discriminants below this was increased to @xmath364 hours ) . as a result",
    ", only partial ipad data was obtained for @xmath365 of the @xmath366 fields examined . for @xmath367 of these ,",
    "the ipad computation was almost complete with @xmath116-class group data for only one of the 4 extensions missing .",
    "we now present a summary of the data collected .",
    "the first table is a census of the most common ipads .",
    "the second lists their relative proportions obtained by dividing through by the total number of fields examined .",

    "the intermediate columns show the frequencies for these subintervals .",
    "fields for which only partial ipad data was obtained due to time constraints are counted under the heading `` incomplete ipads '' .    while there is certainly not exact agreement between the numerical and theoretical values",
    ", we still find this data promising . given the relatively small size of the interval examined",
    ", one would not expect good convergence to the predicted limiting values .",
    "indeed , if one takes a step back and simply examines the relative proportions of the four most common @xmath116-class groups @xmath268$],@xmath270$],@xmath375 $ ] and @xmath376 $ ] for all fields in the given interval , one obtains the proportions @xmath377 , @xmath378 , @xmath379 and @xmath380 respectively .",
    "however the theoretical values predicted by the cohen - lenstra heuristics are @xmath381 , @xmath382 , @xmath383 and @xmath384 respectively .",
