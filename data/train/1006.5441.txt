    "in many social , biological , and economic systems there are complex networks that include directed links acting only in one direction ; outwards or inwards .",
    "that is , there are processes in which agents do not act in a symmetrical way .",
    "therefore , studying and comparing different dynamics in similar undirected ( un ) and directed networks ( dn ) is an important task . in social systems such as families , clans , schools , etc .",
    "there exist directed or asymmetrical processes like copying or imitating , giving orders , teaching , etc .",
    "similar mechanisms occur in automatized or control systems regarding flux of information or signals .",
    "we can visualize asymmetric cases with arrows pointing in only one direction to indicate the lack of reciprocity or bilaterality .",
    "only one direction instead of two is equivalent to cutting links .",
    "therefore , when some agents are chosen in a network , it is possible that they remain totally passive , i. e. do not change their state .",
    "our networks models are based on the watts - strogatz structure @xcite for small - world phenomena , where in dn there is only one link instead of bidirectional double links connecting the same two vertices or nodes in the corresponding un .",
    "we will now briefly mention some representative works on directed networks .",
    "et al _ @xcite investigated the effect of directed links on the behavior of a simple spin - like model evolving on a small - world network , leading to a phase diagram including first- and second - order phase transitions out of equilibrium .",
    "the majority - vote model has been studied with noise on directed random graphs @xcite .",
    "inspired in food web theory in ecosystems , morelli @xcite studied the fraction of basal , top nodes and node level distributions in directed networks based on the watts - strogatz model , gave analytical expressions for the fraction of basal and top nodes for the model , and studied the node level distributions with numerical simulations .",
    "when a naive spreading process starts in a directed network , the interplay of shortcuts and unfavorable bonds on the small world properties is studied in simple models of small - world networks with directed links @xcite , leading to general results small - world networks with directed links .    on the other hand , convergence ( or divergence ) of ideas or opinions among participants of a debate",
    "is a very important social process . in practice , in opinion models",
    "it is plausible to assume that discussions take place when the opinions of the people involved are sufficiently close to each other , a process called bounded confidence .",
    "then agents can negotiate their difference to try to reach consensus , or al least , to share similar , if not equal , opinions .",
    "in deffuant _ et al _ model @xcite ( hereafter referred to , for simplicity , as deffuant model ) , a simple opinion dynamics was proposed for the full graph , which we employ here in both un and dn within the watts - strogatz model .",
    "some models of opinion dynamics , including deffuant model , have been reviewed in lorenz @xcite and castellano _ et al _ @xcite .",
    "we now mention some papers based on this model .",
    "the effect of varying the number of peers met at one time , for different population sizes , and the effects of changing the self - support in the deffuant model was studied by urbig _",
    "et al _ @xcite .",
    "et al _ @xcite  added a rejection mechanism into a 2d bounded confidence model based in the deffuant model , yielding metastable clusters , which maintain themselves through opposite influences of competitor clusters .",
    "the deffuant model has been studied also in scale free network topology@xcite .",
    "guo and cai @xcite took into account the heterogeneous distribution of connectivity degree in an deffuant model in which the convergence parameter of an agent is a function of the degree of its interaction partner , and in particular , they assumed that convergence is faster in agents interacting with more connected or `` famous '' agents ( `` celebrity '' effect ) . within the deffuant model groeber _",
    "et al _ @xcite combined an agent s behavior and the mean behaviour of her in - group ( agent s past interaction partners in her neighborhood ) to foster consensus and to yield new local clusters or cultures . within the same spirit of incorporating the states of each agents neighborhood ,",
    "the transition from invasion to coexistence in nonlinear voter models has been investigated @xcite to yield three regimes : complete invasion ; random coexistence ; and correlated coexistence . in ref .",
    "@xcite , a node will convert to its opposite opinion , if it is in the local minority opinion , but in contrast with the majority - voter model , the opinion of each node itself is included with its neighbors . then , because of the clustering ( community support ) of agents holding the same opinion , these clusters can not be invaded by the other opinion , analogously to incompressible fluids , a fact that allows to map this opinion clustering behavior to a known physics percolation problem @xcite . in a discrete deffuant model on a directed barabasi - albert , it is shown in @xcite that it is difficult to reach absolute consensus . in a similar network @xcite , a multi - layer model representing various age levels was employed and advertising effects were included . in deffuant model ,",
    "extremists were defined @xcite as individuals with a very low uncertainty in their opinion states , and located at the extremes of the initial opinion distribution . in @xcite , the role of network topology on extremism propagation in small - world networks was investigated and a drift to a single extreme appeared only beyond a critical level of connectivity , which decreases when the randomness increases .",
    "assmann @xcite investigated agents with different random and systematic opinion qualities in the deffuant model .    in this paper",
    ", we investigate the effect of directed links on the behavior of a simple continuous opinion model , the deffuant model , evolving on disordered networks .",
    "our simulations could help understand opinion formation in networks with less number of links due to lack of reciprocity and disordered heterogeneity .",
    "after reviewing the two main elements of our model ; the dynamics of deffuant model and secondly , the directed networks , here we combine them to simulate the deffuant model in @xmath2 watts - strogatz networks for small - world phenomena . in sect .",
    "ii we present the general opinion dynamics in deffuant model and the construction of the directed network ( topology ) . sect .",
    "iii is devoted to results and discussion of the differences of the deffuant model in un and dn regarding clustering , convergence time , distribution of final opinions and conservation of opinion . sect .",
    "iv we present our summary and conclusions .",
    "in the deffuant model _ _  _ _ @xcite , a simple opinion dynamics was proposed for the fully connected graph , where all nodes are connected among them ( or any agent or node has all nodes as neighbors ) . here",
    "we apply the notion of neighbors connected by ( bi - directional or uni - directional ) links . in the case of directed networks",
    "@xmath3 is neighbor of @xmath4 only if there exist a link from @xmath4 to @xmath3 .",
    "the dynamic is summarized as follows : on any issue , each opinion is represented by a continuous number @xmath5 chosen between @xmath6 and @xmath7 , without loss of generality .",
    "one selects an agent @xmath4 and then with the same probability for all its neighbors  ( if there are any ) one selects one of them called @xmath3 .    then between the selected neighbors , if the difference of the opinions @xmath8 and @xmath9 exceeds the threshold , openness or tolerance , @xmath10 , nothing happens ( here @xmath11 is a _ dynamical _ time that labels and orders the time steps of the iterative process ) , but if , @xmath12 ,   \\label{uno } \\\\ x_{j}(t+1 ) & = & x_{j}(t)+\\mu \\lbrack x_{i}(t)-x_{j}(t ) ] .",
    "\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    which means that their opinions get closer , as measured by the parameter @xmath13 @xmath14),$ ] this process can be labeled as a `` negotiation '' .",
    "this procedure is repeated until all opinion values do not change , and then it is said that convergence is reached .",
    "it is usual to use the same approaching parameter @xmath15 for all agents . if @xmath15",
    "= @xmath16 then both opinions  @xmath17 and @xmath9 become the same in one step at their midpoint and consensus of the two agents involved is then very quick and complete .",
    "obviously the underlying topology of the system defines the neighborhood of every agent . when convergence is reached , after employing iteratively the eq .",
    "[ uno ] procedure , we define a cluster as the set of nodes sharing the same final opinions .    a common procedure to create a disordered network , known as the watts @xmath18 strogatz model ( wsm ) @xcite , is to start from a regular structure with  @xmath19  nodes ( in our case nodes on a circle connected with nearest neighbors ) of connectivity @xmath20 , and then remove each link with probability @xmath21 , reconnecting it at random .",
    "the random rewiring process introduces @xmath22 long links which connect nodes that otherwise were connecting only nearest neighbors .",
    "the resulting network from the above procedure is an undirected ( or more properly called in this case bi - directional ) network , because each link connects or acts in both direcctions . for the dn case each bi - directional link is reemplaced by a line with only one arrow , which direction is randomly selected .",
    "therefore , if directedness ( or presence of arrows ) is not taken into account , the directed network ( dn ) has exactly the same structure as the undirected one ( un ) .",
    "in figs.[fig1 ] and [ fig2 ] we show the number of final states @xmath23 for networks with @xmath24 and @xmath25 respectively , averaged over @xmath26 realizations .",
    "we notice that in both un and dn , @xmath27 exhibits a much stronger dependence on the the tolerance @xmath28 than on the disorder parameter @xmath21 . as in any bounded confidence model ,",
    "increasing @xmath28 leads to a monotonous decrease in @xmath27 , an effect that is expected to be more pronounced in the case of the un , due to a larger ( double ) number of links that lead to a more refined convergence process . in contrast , there is a very weak dependence of @xmath27 on @xmath21 in both un and dn .    to compare the results of figs.[fig1 ] and [ fig2 ] , in fig.[fig3 ] we plot the difference of @xmath29final opinions @xmath30 for @xmath24 and @xmath31 , which present the same qualitative behavior .",
    "as mentioned above , this difference as function de @xmath28 is expected to be  positive and large due to larger number of links in the un .",
    "this is the case for large values of @xmath32 but surprisingly , the difference exhibits small negative values for lower values of @xmath28 .    to understand this behaviour",
    "we get more detailed information by calculating the time evolution of the system and distributions of the final opinions as a function of @xmath28  and @xmath21 .",
    "we plot in figs .",
    "[ fig4 ] the time evolution of the number of final opinions @xmath27 averaged over 100 realizations for a set of different parameters . here",
    "each time unit is defined in terms of the system size as @xmath19 dynamical steps or sequential loops of eq .",
    "notice that the convergence time is much larger in the un than in the dn , and this difference grows with @xmath28 .",
    "the presence of less number of links in the dn cause a much faster convergence , whereas the presence of disorder affects little the convergence time in both un and dn .    in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] ( un ) and fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] ( dn ) we show examples of final opinion distributions in the interval [ 0,1 ] for two different values of tolerance ; @xmath33 and @xmath34 .    results in un exhibit a more smoother behavior as compared with those of the dn ( with larger number of links ) , in the sense that the dn curves show a more regular and symmetrical behaviour in [ 0,1 ] due to slower and better convergence .",
    "as expected , for high values of tolerance , the system converges to only one cluster with the average value of all states , but surprisingly for small values of the tolerance , clusters with opinion values closer to the opinion edges 0 and 1 interact less than those near the middle , that have neighbors with similar opinions at both their right and left flanks .",
    "this effect is more pronounced in the dn , for which even some clusters are lost in the middle of [ 0,1 ] for values of @xmath28 less than 0.3 , approximately .",
    "if we roughly divide the interval [ 0,1 ] in thirds , it is the middle section that tends to be emptied because there always exist opinions at both right and left ranges , while opinions at the edge `` thirds '' are more restricted to interact with neighbors in one side , rather than in a less symmetric opinion space .",
    "since in the dn a fewer number of links yield much shorter convergence times , then nodes around the middle in opinion space have less oportunities to come back to middle opinions after interacting with agents with more extreme opinions .",
    "the fact that clusters around the middle loose members or strength was already observed in un on the curves for the population of equally - spaced adjacent opinion clusters  or parties  by ben - naim , _",
    "et al _ @xcite , who employed a density - based dynamics for a density function to determine the agents density in the opinion space . here",
    ", besides this depopulating effect , we also found that in the dn some final opinions do not survive at all , which explains the negative values in @xmath35 in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ]    to summarize the dependence of our results on @xmath28 , we emphasize that for higher values of @xmath28 there are more nodes or agents in the dn that are isolated or jammed that in the un case .",
    "then the number of final opinions @xmath27 in dn is much larger , as compared with the un , because of the relative absence of links .",
    "that is in dn there are more isolated agents or pathway - endings .",
    "the larger number of final opinion in the dn resembles results in un models that include many extremists or stubborn  @xcite agents with small capacity to change opinion .",
    "of course , the underlying mechanisms are different ; in the former case ( dn ) , there are less links than in the usual un , and in the latter un case agents behavior is not homogeneous  by construction . in the region of lower @xmath28 ,",
    "the fact that @xmath36 is negative was explained in terms of the irregularity and lost of clusters in the dn , relative to the un .",
    "the dependence of both @xmath37 and @xmath38 on  @xmath21 is more much smaller than on @xmath28 .",
    "figs.[fig1 ] and [ fig2 ] show how the increase of disorder ( increasing  @xmath21 ) favors long - range dissemination and convergence in the case of @xmath39 and when @xmath28 also increases .",
    "in general , it is known that there is a competition of local and global dissemination in complex networks , since increasing disorder favours long - range dissemination .",
    "the presence of a small fraction of short cuts  connecting otherwise distant points , drastically reduces the average shortest distance between any pair of nodes in network , keeping the clustering high @xcite . in our dynamics , i.e. the deffuant mode",
    ", the effect of the short cuts seems to be less important than , for instance , in the ising model in small - world topologies , for which , when directed links are considered , not only the critical temperature changes but the nature of the transition also switches@xcite . in the axelrod model of cultural dissemination , the same qualitative result as for the equilibrium ising model was found , in the sense that the small - world connectivity favors homogeneous or ordered states @xcite    on the other hand , when @xmath21 increases and @xmath28 is large , @xmath40 may slightly decrease , in contrast to @xmath39 , showing that short cuts are not so efficient in the dn in favoring convergence in the deffuant model . however , the behavior of @xmath35 is more similar to that of @xmath38 .",
    "finally , in our simulations we found that the value of the final opinions in each cluster for both un and dn was the @xmath41 average of the initial opinions for that cluster , regardless of the random process to reach the final consensus within each final cluster @xmath42 . in a similar direction , jacobmeier @xcite employed the deffuant model on a directed barabasi - albert network with discrete opinions , and pointed out that the resulting opinion distribution converged towards the average value of the initial opinion distribution , which was identified as a guide of opinion forming .",
    "ben - naim _ et al _ @xcite also showed how opinion is conserved in the particular case @xmath15",
    "= @xmath16 with a density formalism . here ,",
    "for any value @xmath43 we outline a proof of how the conservation of opinion leads to clusters with the final average of the initial opinion values for both un and dn .",
    "of course , this conservation property is a consequence of the symmetrical approach process ; that is , this property is arises from the same values of the `` approaching '' parameter @xmath15 for both agents @xmath4 and @xmath3 in eq .",
    "[ uno ] .    to prove that all connected nodes will converge to the average of the initial opinions , we start with the simple case @xmath44 for which all agents are capable of interacting and converging to the final consensus value @xmath45 let be @xmath46 @xmath47 the final total sum of opinions after convergence , where superindexes @xmath48 and @xmath49 indicate initial or final states values . from eq . [ uno ] , since in each step @xmath50",
    "is conserved , then the initial total sum of opinions @xmath51 @xmath52 is equal to @xmath53 thus the final opinion satisfies @xmath54 @xmath55 .",
    "when @xmath56 we need to resort to a cumbersome double mathematical induction method over both the number of nodes inside and outside a cluster , but we sketch here the main ideas . at any step of the simulation , the system may be broken into subsets because some interactions might be restricted . at any given time , when  a node @xmath57 interacts with an element @xmath58 of a new cluster with size @xmath59 ( while its former cluster may or not disappear ) , if the node @xmath60 only interacts with the same node @xmath58 always - a very improbable case- the proof is trivial , but in general , there is a competition between diferent clusters that can attract a given node .",
    "we prove in the appendix how the conservation of opinion holds when this competition mechanism applies for the simplified case of three nodes aligned in a simple array .",
    "then , taking into account the fact that in the competition process opinion is always conserved , we can apply the same procedure shown above ( as if @xmath61 ) for all the nodes in the subset with  @xmath62 elements .",
    "this conservation law obviously arises from eq .",
    "[ uno ] , where for all values of @xmath15 the approach process is symmetric .",
    "there is not empirical evidence that the approach process is exactly symmetric in social systems , but it could be regarded as a useful rule to simplify simulattions .",
    "two different random values of @xmath63 and @xmath64 in a pair - wise interaction is another alternative .",
    "it is important to study directed links in networks because many real systems relationships and dynamics are not bilateral or reciprocal . here , we first constructed a directed network ( dn ) from a bidirectional network un , by simply deleting half of the links of the un , to obtain a dn sharing the same structure .",
    "then we performed simulations within the deffuant model of negotiators to find averaged distributions of final opinions @xmath27 as function of the tolerance @xmath10 and of the network disorder parameter @xmath21 in both un and dn .",
    "then , by comparing the results of the deffuant dynamics in these networks we find a rich structure of the averaged difference of clusters or final opinions , @xmath65 the dependence of @xmath27 on @xmath10 in both un and dn was much stronger than on @xmath66 .",
    "obviously , as in all bounded confidence models , increasing @xmath28 leads to a monotonous decrease of @xmath27 in each network , but @xmath67 exhibits a rich structure , since itwas found to be large and positive for large  @xmath28 , but small and negative for smaller values of @xmath28 .",
    "the former case follows logically from the fact that , by construction , the dn have less ( half ) number of links , as compared to the un , making the convergence process to find consensus more difficult in the dn .",
    "the presence of disorder has only a small effect on the convergence time in both un and dn , and the larger number of links causes a much faster convergence in dn . to understand why @xmath30 could be negative , it was helpful to plot the corresponding distributions of @xmath68 in the interval [ 0,1 ] to find that the dn distributions are less homogeneous than the analogous un distributions . also for low @xmath28",
    "the dn distributions suffer a relative loss in the number and strength of the middle opinions , as compared to the un .",
    "finally , in both un and dn we show how final opinions in each cluster are the exact average of the initial opinions .",
    "this conservation property is just a consequence of the two - agent symmetrical approach process built into the model .",
    "such mechanism can be changed by assigning two different random values for the approach parameters in each pair - wise interaction without affecting the main results .",
    "we hope that this work may contribute to the advancement of more realistic models and applications of opinion dynamics in directed networks .",
