    "the factorization theorem @xcite has been one of the most important issues in qcd .",
    "it states that scattering cross sections or amplitudes can be written as a product or a convolution of the hard , the collinear , and the soft parts , and each part depends on a single scale .",
    "the factorization of the hard , collinear , and soft parts in various processes was studied previously in the full theory , considering the appropriate kinematic regions in which the particles involved can be either collinear or soft @xcite .",
    "it has been a complicated task to disentangle the contributions from all the possible kinematic regions , but the soft - collinear effective theory ( scet ) @xcite can be helpful in understanding this difficult procedure since scet is formulated in such a way that the collinear interactions and the soft interactions are decoupled to all orders in @xmath2 from the beginning .",
    "scet successfully describes the factorization properties in @xmath3 decays such as @xmath4 @xcite , @xmath5 @xcite , nonleptonic @xmath3 decays @xcite and @xmath6 @xcite . and it can be applied to other high - energy processes to probe the factorization properties @xcite . in order to show the utility of scet in high - energy processes , we will consider deep inelastic scattering , the drell - yan process , jet production from @xmath0 collisions , and the @xmath7-@xmath8 form factor with two virtual photons , where all the hadrons in these processes are light and energetic so that we can apply scet .",
    "the treatment of these high - energy processes with scet has been extensively discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite .    in scet",
    "the factorization occurs in each process , in which the scattering cross section or the form factor can be written as a convolution of the hard part ( the wilson coefficients from matching the full theory onto @xmath9 ) , the collinear part ( the jet functions from matching @xmath9 onto @xmath10 ) , and the soft part ( the matrix elements of the remaining operators in @xmath10 ) .",
    "the matrix elements between hadronic states are nonperturbative and can not be computed from first principles , but their scaling behavior can be obtained using perturbation theory . in high - energy scattering processes ,",
    "the matrix elements of gauge - invariant operators are usually parameterized as either the parton distribution functions for hadrons in the initial states , or the fragmentation functions for the final - state hadrons @xcite .    in this paper , we are mainly interested in the nonperturbative part from the soft interactions in scet",
    ". the effect of soft interactions in the soft part does not usually appear at leading order in scet since it cancels in many processes .",
    "however , near the boundary of the phase space , the cancellation is incomplete and the nonperturbative effect of soft gluon emission can be important . in this case ,",
    "the conventional operator product expansion breaks down , but still we can consider gauge - invariant nonlocal operators which are connected by an operator with a string of gauge fields . the endpoint behavior in deep inelastic scattering using scet was first discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , focusing on the scaling behavior of the matrix elements of the collinear operators .",
    "the nonperturbative effects of the soft gluon emission in @xmath0 collisions were first considered in terms of scet in refs .",
    "@xcite .    near the phase boundary ,",
    "the final operators , of which the matrix elements between hadronic states describe nonperturbative effects , consist of collinear fields , which are connected by soft wilson lines . in scet , since the soft interactions are decoupled from the collinear sector , we can decompose the operators in terms of the collinear operators and the soft wilson lines and we can consider the matrix elements of these two kinds of operators . though the matrix element of the soft wilson lines can not be computed in perturbation theory , the renormalization group behavior of the soft wilson - line operator can be derived .",
    "there has been such consideration in the full theory .",
    "for example , in ref .",
    "@xcite , the authors considered the vacuum expectation value of a soft wilson line which is defined as @xmath11 in ref .",
    "@xcite , the vacuum average of a soft wilson loop was analyzed , which is given by @xmath12 here the integration path @xmath13 is determined by the kinematics of the processes , @xmath14 orders gauge fields @xmath15 in time , and @xmath16 orders the generators @xmath17 of the @xmath18 gauge group along the path @xmath13 .",
    "the difference between @xmath19 and @xmath20 is that the gluon fields in @xmath19 are ordered along the path @xmath13 , but not according to time .",
    "therefore on different parts of the path @xmath13 , the gluon fields are time or anti - time ordered .",
    "the minute difference in the definitions of @xmath20 and @xmath19 affects the analytic structure of the soft wilson lines .",
    "the main theme of the paper is to study the analytic structure of the wilson lines , especially the soft wilson lines in scet near the boundary of the phase space .",
    "we show that the soft wilson lines appear universally in deep inelastic scattering , in the drell - yan process and in the jet production from @xmath0 collisions , in which the wilson lines appear in the matrix elements squared or the discontinuity of the forward scattering amplitude .",
    "they also appear in the @xmath7-@xmath8 form factor , in which the soft wilson line appears in an amplitude .",
    "after we identify the analytic structure of the soft wilson lines , we compute the anomalous dimensions of the soft wilson lines in scet to see the renormalization group behavior .",
    "the conventional approach @xcite for this analysis is to separate the region of momentum and to extract the contribution from the collinear region and the soft region , but the advantage of scet comes from the fact that this separation is performed automatically when we perform the two - step matching @xcite with the two effective theories called @xmath9 and @xmath10 . near the boundary of the phase space , the intermediate states can have momentum of order @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the large momentum scale with @xmath23 , but still @xmath24 .",
    "first , we integrate the degrees of freedom of order @xmath25 from the full theory and match onto the intermediate effective theory , @xmath9 . here",
    "the ultrasoft ( usoft ) particles with momentum of order @xmath26 can interact with collinear particles .",
    "then we integrate out the degrees of freedom of order @xmath27 to go down to @xmath10 . in @xmath10 , the soft particles and the collinear particles",
    "are decoupled , and the effects of soft gluon emission in scet can be studied without regard to the collinear sector .",
    "the soft wilson line operator in scet , which we will elaborate in detail , takes the form @xmath28 where the wilson lines @xmath29 and @xmath30 are the fourier transforms of @xmath31 , \\",
    "\\overline{s } ( z)=   \\exp \\bigl [ ig \\int ds    \\overline{n}\\cdot a_s    ( \\overline{n}s+z ) \\bigr],\\ ] ] and here we suggest how to prescribe the path ordering , which is determined by the processes under consideration .",
    "we also study the renormalization properties of the soft wilson - line operators for a path @xmath13 lying on the light cone in scet after we separate the soft interactions in @xmath10 .",
    "this is in contrast to eqs .",
    "( [ wc ] ) and ( [ wtc ] ) since the paths are partially lying on the light - cone . in our approach , we put all the energetic collinear particles on the light - cone and consider the soft wilson lines on these light cones at leading order in scet .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows : in sec .",
    "[ sec2 ] , we study in detail the analytic structure of the soft wilson lines in scet . in sec .",
    "[ sec3 ] , we explain how the operator @xmath32 for the soft gluon emission appears in deep inelastic scattering , in the drell - yan process , in the jet production from @xmath33 scattering , and in the @xmath7-@xmath8 form factor with two virtual photons . in sec .",
    "[ sec4 ] , we compute the radiative correction for @xmath32 at one loop and derive the renormalization group equation . we also show that the result is consistent with the result obtained by korchemsky et al . @xcite . in the final section , we present conclusions and compare the conventional approach with the approach in scet .",
    "the analytic structure of the soft wilson lines is important in computing radiative corrections because the position of the poles is determined by the appropriate @xmath34 prescription . in scet ,",
    "the soft wilson line is obtained by factorizing the usoft interactions in @xmath9 .",
    "one way of deriving the wilson line is to attach usoft gluons to collinear fields and use the eikonal approximation .",

    "@xmath40 denotes the usoft gluon in @xmath9 . in the literature",
    ", this is commonly denoted as @xmath41 , and after we go down to @xmath10 , we relabel them as the soft gluon @xmath40 .",
    "however , we will use @xmath40 for the usoft ( soft ) gluon in @xmath9 ( @xmath10 ) for simplicity .",
    "the exponentiated form @xmath42 is related to the fourier transform @xmath43 of the path - ordered exponential @xmath44 where the path ordering @xmath16 means that the fields are ordered in such a way that the gauge fields closer ( farther ) to the point @xmath36 are moved to the left ( right ) .",

    "<S> the effects of the soft gluon emission in hard scattering processes at the phase boundary are resummed in the soft - collinear effective theory ( scet ) . in scet , </S>",
    "<S> the soft gluon emission is decoupled from the energetic collinear part , and is obtained by the vacuum expectation value of the soft wilson - line operator . </S>",
    "<S> the form of the soft wilson lines is universal in deep inelastic scattering , in the drell - yan process , in the jet production from @xmath0 collisions , and in the @xmath1 process , but its analytic structure is slightly different in each process . </S>",
    "<S> the anomalous dimensions of the soft wilson - line operators for these processes are computed along the light - like path at leading order in scet and to first order in @xmath2 , and the renormalization group behavior of the soft wilson lines is discussed . </S>"
