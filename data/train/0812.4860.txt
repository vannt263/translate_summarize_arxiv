    "pg1159 stars are hot hydrogen - deficient ( pre-)white dwarfs with effective temperatures between 75000 and 200000k , and @xmath1=5.58.0 ( werner 2001 ) .",
    "they are in the transition between the asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) and cooling white dwarfs .",
    "spectra of pg1159 stars are dominated by absorption lines of heii , civ and ovi .",
    "roughly half of them have a planetary nebula .",
    "current theory suggests ( e.g.  werner 2001 ) that they are the outcome of a late or very late helium - shell flash , a phenomenon that drives the currently observed fast evolutionary rates of three well - known objects ( fg  sge , sakurai s object , v605 aql ) .",
    "flash - induced envelope mixing produces a h - deficient stellar surface .",
    "the photospheric composition then essentially reflects that of the region between the h- and he - burning shells in the precursor agb star .",
    "the he - shell flash forces the star back onto the agb .",
    "the subsequent , second post - agb evolution explains the existence of wolf - rayet central stars of planetary nebulae and their successors , the pg1159 stars .",
    "these in turn are the progenitors of the helium rich wd sequence .",
    "currently , 40 pg1159 stars are known , figure[fig : tracks ] shows their positions in a log@xmath2-@xmath3-diagram .",
    "recent evolutionary models for pg1159 stars ( miller bertolami & althaus 2006b , werner & herwig 2006 ) lead to spectroscopic masses which still suffer from serious uncertainties concerning the efficiency of the overshooting process in the he - flash driven convection zone during the thermal pulse phase on the agb . this efficiency is represented in the models with an a priori unknown free parameter .",
    "the other ingredient for the determination of spectroscopic masses , the stellar atmosphere models , have to deal with uncertainties in the line broadening theory , so lacking reliable physical input there makes the determination of @xmath4 particularly difficult .",
    "the overall resulting uncertainties in model masses manifest themselves as discrepancies between current asteroseismological masses and spectroscopic masses , as is evident from table  3 in werner & herwig ( 2006 ; an updated version has been adopted as table  1 in schuh & nagel 2007 ) .",

    "the median spectrum of the pg1159 component was normalised to the continuum and cross - correlated with each normalised spectrum of the model grid .",
    "this cross - correlation was restricted to wavelength ranges where at least one of the model spectra shows significant spectral features ( minimum line depth is a free parameter of this restriction ; usually 1% was chosen , 3% , however , yields similar results ) and where the mean companion spectrum shows no significant spectral features ( the maximum line height of emission lines is another free parameter for the restriction  possible red shift differences between the two components are taken into account ) . different choices of the free parameters show a stable maximum in the cross - correlation values for the median spectrum at an effective temperature of about @xmath36 , @xmath1 of about @xmath37 and c / he of @xmath38 .",

    "the radial velocity curves derived by beeck ( 2009 ) are shown in figure[fig : radialvelocities ] . due to the individual exposure times of 30min",
    "the spectral lines are somewhat smeared by the orbital motion , adding to the uncertainties in the determination of the radial velocities .",
    "the ratio of projected semi - amplitudes yields @xmath42 , allowing a range of mass ratios @xmath43 .",
    "although we find a shift of the zero point of the pg1159 s velocity curve with regard to the companion s velocity curve zero point of the order of 11kms@xmath18 ( figure[fig : radialvelocities ] ) which could be caused by the gravitational redshift of the pg1159 star , this result is not formally significant .",
    "the expected gravitational redshift for a star with a mass of 0.5 - 0.8m@xmath5 and a radius of 0.02 - 0.15r@xmath5 would be of the order of 4 to 25 kms@xmath18 .",
    "better data would be required to deduce reliable constraints for the combination of mass and radius of the pg1159 star from a gravitational redshift measurement .",
    "with the know orbital period @xmath44 and projected radial velocities @xmath45 , @xmath46 measured from spectroscopy , in principle the only value the light curve modelling still needs to provide is the inclination @xmath47 to obtain the mass : ( similarly for @xmath21 ) .    at an assumed value for the inclination of 40@xmath48",
    ", the photometric variation can be fit using ` phoebe ` as shown in figure[fig : lightcurve ] ; further independent considerations to constrain the inclination are not overwhelmingly helpful ( figure[fig : msin3iconstraints ] ) .",
    "the best value will be determined from a comprehensive parameter study , including a comparison of results from ` nightfall ` and ` phoebe ` ( beeck 2009 ) .",
    "all the light curve solutions are obtained under the simplifying assumptions of bound rotation and a circular orbit .",
    "further complications arise from the choice of the albedo value in particular for the companion which is unknown and possibly larger than 1 in the relevant wavelength range due to redistribution , large uncertainties in the physical modelling of reflection effect , and a formal limitation inherent to ` phoebe ` where the maximum @xmath49 currently available is 50000k .",
    "constraints for the many parameters governing a light curve simulation will come from the spectral analysis not only of the pg1159 , but also from irradiated spectra calulated using ` phoenix ` to model the hot side of the companion . a particularly strong additional constraint would come from a good determination of the gravitational redshift for the pg1159 star .",
