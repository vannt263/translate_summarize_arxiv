    "a related issue in neutrinos physics is the absolute mass values of the known neutrinos . while the experimental evidence of neutrino oscillations within the known three flavor states @xcite clearly shows that these particles can not all be massless , the oscillations are only sensitive to mass differences , not to their absolute values . in contrast",

    "so far the best bounds on the absolute masses of the light neutrinos come from cosmology @xmath5 ev @xcite .",
    "a pending question is then why light neutrinos are so light , specifically so much lighter than all other standard model ( sm ) fermions .",

    "this mixing is suppressed as @xmath10 ( @xmath111 ) . besides the simplest scenario ,",
    "there are other seesaw scenarios in which the heavy neutrinos may have lower masses , namely near or below 1 tev @xcite and even near the 1 gev scale or below @xcite , and at the same time their mixing with the sm flavors may not be so extremely suppressed as in the original scenarios .    in the first part of this work we discuss lepton number violating ( lnv ) semileptonic decays of charged pseudoscalar mesons such as @xmath1 and @xmath2 , mediated by a heavy majorana neutrino on its mass shell , _ cf .",

    "the pions , which are the lightest mesons , can have only leptonic decays ; we discuss hypothetical leptonic decays that could be mediated by on - shell heavy neutrinos .",

    "it turns out that such cp violation becomes appreciable and possibly detectable in these decays if the scenario contains at least two on - shell heavy neutrinos that are almost degenerate .",

    "this model can explain simultaneously the existence of neutrino oscillations , dark matter and baryon asymmetry of the universe .",

    "cp violation effects in the neutrino sector in scenarios with nearly degenerate heavy neutrinos have also been investigated earlier @xcite using a more detailed formalism , although it amounts to the same effect described here which is the interference of amplitudes with two slightly different dispersive and absorptive parts in the neutrino self energy . in section",

    "<S> some of the outstanding questions of particle physics today concern the neutrino sector , in particular whether there are more neutrinos than those already known and whether they are dirac or majorana particles . </S>",
    "<S> there are different ways to explore these issues . in this article </S>",
    "<S> we describe neutrino - mediated decays of charged pseudoscalar mesons such as @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 , in scenarios where extra neutrinos are heavy and can be on their mass shell . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss semileptonic and leptonic decays of such kinds . </S>",
    "<S> we investigate possible ways of using these decays in order to distinguish between the dirac and majorana character of neutrinos . </S>",
    "<S> further , we argue that there are significant possibilities of detecting cp violation in such decays when there are at least two almost degenerate majorana neutrinos involved . </S>",
    "<S> this latter type of scenario fits well into the known neutrino minimal standard model ( @xmath3msm ) which could simultaneously explain the dark matter and baryon asymmetry of the universe . </S>"
