    "the origin of the small inhomogeneities in the cosmic fluids which eventually evolved into the large scale structures that we observe today in the universe is still under debate .",
    "two classes of models are at present in competition .",
    "the inflationary models on one hand @xcite explain those inhomogeneities by the amplification of quantum fluctuations at the end of an accelerated phase of expansion of the universe @xcite .",
    "on the other hand topological defects appearing during a phase transition in the early universe @xcite can also seed inhomogeneities @xcite .",
    "a way to discriminate between those two classes of models is to compute the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) anisotropies they predict and confront the results to observations . at present the anisotropies on large angular scales",
    "are known from the cobe measurements @xcite . on smaller scales , the present balloon and ground experiments @xcite",
    "are still unprecise but the measurements should improve when the map @xcite and planck @xcite satellite missions are launched .    on the theoretical front , the cmb anisotropy predictions from the inflationary models ( at least the simplest ones ) are robust , and can now in many cases be obtained by plugging into the cmbfast code @xcite@xcite the initial conditions given by the particular model at hand . on the other hand the predictions from defect scenarios",
    "are still unclear , the reason being that the defects , which act as a continuous source of inhomogeneities , are difficult to model .",
    "indeed the description of the formation , evolution and decay of defects requires heavy numerical simulations ( see e.g. @xcite-@xcite ) , and the cmb anisotropies their networks create seem to be very sensitive to their detailed structure .",
    "recent results @xcite@xcite indicate that defect model predictions do not agree with the data .",
    "it is clear however that more work needs to be done before rejecting topological defects as a possible explanation for the cmb anisotropies as they may for example have a more complex internal structure ( see e.g. @xcite ) than that assumed in those numerical models .",
    "considering the complexity of modeling realistic topological defects , the semi - analytic approach initiated by durrer and collaborators @xcite seems to be a fruitful compromise .",
    "the idea is to model the defect network by a stress - energy tensor which acts as a source to the linearized einstein equations and induces inhomogeneities in the cosmic fluids .",
    "the ten components of this stress - energy tensor are then drastically constrained by a number of physical requirements . in this paper",
    ", we shall impose , as in @xcite@xcite , that the defect network    1 .",
    "[ enum1 ] is statistically homogeneous and isotropic ( hence obeys the copernican principle ) , 2 .",
    "[ enum2 ] is created at a phase transition in an up to then perfectly homogeneous and isotropic universe ( hence obeys specific causality @xcite and matching @xcite conditions ) , 3 .",
    "[ enum3 ] evolves deep in the radiation era and deep in the matter era in a way which is statistically independent of time ( scaling requirement @xcite ) .",
    "+ we shall also make the further assumptions that the network 4 .",
    "[ enum4 ] satisfies the conservation equations , 5 .",
    "[ enum5 ] is statistically coherent ( see e.g. @xcite and below for a precise definition ) .",
    "of all those requirements the latter two are stringent and probably not fulfilled by realistic defect networks ( see e.g. @xcite@xcite@xcite ) .",
    "now , as for assumption ( [ enum5 ] ) , it is a sensible one to make , as incoherent sources can in principle be described as a sum of coherent ones @xcite ( see  [ ssec_coh ] ) . as for assumption ( [ enum4 ] ) ,",
    "all authors who describe semi - analytically the defects as a fluid have up to now made it .",
    "all authors who consider global defects construct _ conserved _ stress energy tensors ( see e.g. @xcite ) . those who study local strings may have to add an extra fluid so that the total stress energy tensor is conserved ( see e.g. @xcite@xcite ) . only contaldi _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , as far as we are aware , have questionned it . in order to take into account the network loss of energy through gravitational radiation or particle production ,",
    "they have added an extra fluid which compensates for the non conservation of the defect stress - energy tensor ( which comes from excising small loops from the numerical simulation in order for the network to scale ) .",
    "the problem with such a modelling ( as contaldi _",
    "et al . _ themselves",
    "note ) is , first , that the results are very sensitive to the equation of state of that extra fluid ( which is left as a free parameter ) , and , second , that the energy lost by the network is transferred exclusively to that extra fluid and not to the background photons , baryons , cold dark matter ( cdm ) and neutrinos .",
    "therefore the modelling of the defect network energy loss is still in a primitive stage and needs to be improved by a careful analysis of the microphysics involved in the evolution of the network ( which includes friction effects , particle and gravitational radiation production by decaying loops , as well as electromagnetic interactions with the plasma when the network carries currents ) . in this paper , in order to keep arbitrariness to a minimum , we choose to ignore the network energy losses .",
    "those five conditions being imposed , the stress - energy tensor of the defects will turn out to depend only on four free functions , two describing its scalar part and two describing respectively its vectorial and tensorial parts .",
    "moreover , for a particular ansatz which garantees that the defects evolve from the two scaling regimes in such a way that the conservation equations are satisfied , those four functions will , as we shall see , depend only on one variable @xmath0 and tend to constants when @xmath1 , and to @xmath2 when @xmath3 .",
    "we shall choose simple anstze for those four functions ( their precise shape can in principle be obtained by numerical simulations ) and solve the well - known ( see e.g. @xcite ) linearised einstein equations which couple the defect network to the cosmic fluid inhomogeneities .",
    "finally we shall compute numerically the cmb anisotropies those inhomogeneities produce .    in agreement with @xcite ( as well as with @xcite@xcite )",
    "we shall see that those anisotropies are very sensitive to the choices made for the free functions describing the defects .",
    "our results therefore confirm previous work but the loss of scaling invariance during the transition is treated more carefully .",
    "they are also more complete as they include the vector and tensor contributions .",
    "the paper is organised as follows  : in  [ sec2 ] we write down the linearised einstein equations ( in longitudinal gauge ) describing the evolution of the cosmic fluid inhomogeneities driven by the defect stress - energy tensor ( we suppose that the material content of the universe is a mixture of four perfect fluids  : cdm , neutrinos , baryons and photons , the latter two fluids being tightly coupled before decoupling ) . in  [ sec_stress ] we see in a detailed way how the five conditions given above constrain the defect stress - energy tensor . in  [ sec_ic ]",
    "we solve analytically the linearised einstein equations deep in the radiation era , when all scales of interest today were larger than the hubble radius , and we set the initial conditions on the cosmic fluid perturbations , following @xcite . in  [ sec_cmb ] we give the correlation function of the cmb anisotropies in function of the cosmic fluid perturbations , assuming instantaneous decoupling ( our computation is slightly different from the standard one  see e.g. @xcite ) . finally in  [ sec_res ] we compute numerically the multipole coefficients @xmath4 of the cmb anisotropy correlation function using a perfect fluid code and compare our results to previous computations .",
    "we discuss the approximations made , to wit perfect fluid description , tight coupling and instantaneous decoupling hypotheses , by comparing our perfect fluid code to a boltzmann one .",
    "we also show how to evaluate analytically the vector and tensor contributions to the @xmath4 for small @xmath5 .",
    "the universe at large appears to be remarkably homogeneous and isotropic and governed by the gravitational force created by its material content .",
    "we suppose that that was always so , and describe it in a first approximation by a robertson - walker geometry ( that we shall for simplicity suppose spatially flat ) whose time evolution satisfies friedmann s equations . we suppose that its material content is a mixture of perfect fluids made of decoupled black body radiations of photons and massless neutrinos , of baryons with which the photons were coupled until their temperature dropped to @xmath6 k , and of uncoupled `` cold dark matter '' ( cdm ) .",
    "we thus take the line element to be  : @xmath7 where @xmath8 is conformal time ( we set the velocity of light equal to 1 ) , where @xmath9 , @xmath10 are three cartesian coordinates and @xmath11 is the kronecker symbol , and where @xmath12 is the scale factor .",
    "the conservation equations for the fluids read  : @xmath13 where @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the energy density and pressure of the @xmath16-th fluid and where @xmath17 is the comoving hubble radius , with a prime denoting a derivative with respect to conformal time .",
    "the radiation fluids of photons and neutrinos both have a pressure equal to a third of their energy density , and the fluids of baryons and cdm have zero pressure ( whence they have become non - relativistic ) .",
    "hence the two former scale as @xmath18 and the two latter as @xmath19 .",
    "the friedmann equation is  : @xmath20 where @xmath21 is einstein s constant and @xmath22 .    combining eqns .",

    "( [ c_ell_v],[c_ell_t ] ) ] are entirely determined once the functions @xmath242 and @xmath243 describing the vector and tensor components of the stress - energy momentum of the defects are known .",
    "since we supposed @xmath403 they both reduce to their integrated sachs - wolfe contributions .",
    "as we have seen , only the integrated sachs - wolfe effect contributes to the vector and tensor parts of the @xmath4 . in this section , we estimate them at small @xmath5 .",
    "we first assume that the last scattering surface is deep enough in the matter dominated era to approximate @xmath405 and @xmath0 by  : @xmath406 and @xmath407 . the equations ( [ poisson_vec ] ) and ( [ pert_tens ] ) for @xmath58 and @xmath408 can then be rewritten [ using eqns ( [ def_cons_vi],[corr_coh_vv]-[corr_coh_pit ] ) and ( [ res_coh_vec]-[res_coh_tens ] ) ] as @xmath409 the solutions of which are given by @xmath410    we now make the ansatz that the defects disappear as soon as they enter the horizon i.e. that @xmath411 where @xmath412 is the heavyside function .",

    "( [ c_ell_v],[c_ell_t ] ) , we obtain that @xmath413 with @xmath414 . the main contribution to",
    "the two integrals comes from the points @xmath415 ( since the bessel functions are peaked around that point ) . in a matter dominated universe , we have that @xmath416 and for @xmath417 we will assume that @xmath418 . with that approximation ,",
    "we are led to compute the integrals @xmath419 with @xmath420 and @xmath421 for the tensor and vector modes respectively . using the relation @xcite @xmath422",
    "it can be shown that @xmath423 with @xmath424 thus , the @xmath5 dependance of @xmath404 at small @xmath5 is given by @xmath425 this solution is compared to our numerical results on fig .",

    "the two first approximations are well satisfied for small multipoles .",

    ", we have studied the signature of coherent scaling defects on the cosmic microwave background . for that purpose",
    ", we have developped a semi - analytic formalism to describe the topological defect network as well as two numerical codes ( based respectively on a fluid and a boltzmann approach ) to compute the scalar , vector and tensor components of the coefficients @xmath4 of the cmb anisotropy correlation function .",
    "concerning the scalar component , and contrarily to what happens in standard inflationary scenarii , there is an important contribution from the integrated sachs - wolfe term , which does not in general build up as a plateau . in the generic case",
    ", this term dominates at low @xmath5 so that the power on large scales is of the same order or even higher than on small scales .",
    "such characteristics do not fit the present observations @xcite .",
    "however , one can improve the model in various ways .",
    "first one can find special combinations of the arbitrary functions which yield results that are more compatible with the data ( see fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] and @xcite ) .",
    "but of course such a fine tuning needs to be justified .",
    "second one can play with the cosmological parameters .",
    "third one can extend our approach to more realistic defects ( incoherent defects , loss of scaling ... ) .",
    "finally one can consider defects that are produced at the end of an inflationary period @xcite ( and not , as in this paper , in an up to then perfectly homogeneous and isotropic universe ) .",
    "various extensions of the standard model of particle physics predict such a possibility ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "we plan to explore those various improvements in future work @xcite .",
