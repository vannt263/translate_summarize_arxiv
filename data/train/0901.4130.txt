    "recently , they also reported results on non - photonic electron production in @xmath4 , @xmath12au , and auau collisions at @xmath13  gev @xcite",
    ". unfortunately , these rhic data only cover a very limited small-@xmath10 range , where theoretical predictions based on perturbative qcd are difficult .    on the theoretical side ,",
    "the cross sections for the inclusive production of @xmath15 mesons can be obtained as convolutions of universal parton distribution functions ( pdfs ) and universal fragmentation functions ( ffs ) with perturbatively calculable hard - scattering cross sections .",
    "the non - perturbative input in form of pdfs and ffs must be known from fits to other processes .",
    "the universality of the pdfs and ffs guarantees unique predictions for the cross section of the inclusive production of heavy - flavored hadrons .",
    "the results of such calculations for @xmath15 production at the tevatron have been presented recently by us in ref .",
    "@xcite and compared to the cdf data @xcite .",
    "for all four meson species , @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 , and @xmath7 , we found good agreement with the data in the sense that the experimental and theoretical errors overlap .",
    "for the @xmath1 , @xmath3 , and @xmath7 mesons , many of the central data points fall into the theoretical error band due to scale variation",
    ". only the central data points for the @xmath2 mesons lie somewhat above it . for the @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 mesons ,",
    "the central data points tend to overshoot the central theoretical prediction by a factor of about 1.5 at the lower end of the considered @xmath10 range . with the exception of the @xmath7 case ,",
    "the experimental results are gathered on the upper site of the theoretical error band , corresponding to a small value of the renormalization scale @xmath16 and large values of the factorization scales @xmath17 and @xmath18 , related to the initial and final states , respectively .    in our analysis @xcite , we employed the general - mass variable - flavor - number scheme ( gm - vfns ) , which combines the zero - mass variable - flavor - number scheme ( zm - vfns ) and the fixed - flavor - number scheme ( ffns ) .",
    "the gm - vfns is close to the zm - vfns , but retains @xmath19 power terms in the hard - scattering cross sections . here ,",
    "@xmath20 stands for the mass of the charm quark .",
    "the calculational details for hadron - hadron collisions were elaborated in our previous works @xcite .",
    "the characteristic feature of the gm - vfns is that the charm quark is also treated as an incoming parton originating from the ( anti)proton , leading to additional contributions besides those from the light @xmath21 , @xmath12 , and @xmath22 quarks and the gluon .",
    "this is quite analogous to the zm - vfns , but with the important difference that the power terms are retained in the hard - scattering cross sections .",
    "this allows us to apply the gm - vfns also in the region of intermediate @xmath10 values , @xmath23 .",

    "the strong - coupling constant @xmath26 was evaluated in next - to - leading order ( nlo ) with @xmath27  mev , corresponding to @xmath28 .",
    "we employed proton pdf set cteq6.1 m from the coordinated theoretical - experimental project on qcd ( cteq ) collaboration @xcite and the ffs from ref .",
    "the default choice for the renormalization and the initial- and final - state factorization scales was @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the transverse mass .    compared to our previous work @xcite",

    "these data had rather large experimental errors and the disadvantage of being at a rather large scale @xmath33 , far away from the scales of @xmath15 production in @xmath8 collisions at the tevatron , which typically correspond to @xmath10 values below 25  gev . in the meantime ,",
    "new data on charmed - meson production with much higher accuracy were presented by the cleo collaboraton @xcite at cesr and by the belle collaboration @xcite at the kek collider for @xmath34 physics ( kekb ) .",

    "another important ingredient for the theoretical description of inclusive @xmath15 production are the parton distribution functions ( pdfs ) .",

    "corresponding to large values of @xmath17 , the scale dependence is determined by the qcd evolution equations with perturbatively calculable evolution kernels .",
    "so , the pdfs are fully determined by their functional forms in @xmath40 specified at a fixed scale @xmath41 provided @xmath42 is large enough to be in the region where perturbative qcd is supposed to the valid . in most applications ,",
    "@xmath42 is chosen to be of order 12  gev , which is at the borderline between the short - distance ( perturbative ) and long - distance ( non - perturbative ) regions .",
    "the pdfs of the gluon and the light quarks ( @xmath43 ) are non - perturbative .",
    "they are obtained phenomenologically through global qcd analyses , in which the theoretical predictions are compared with a wide range of experimental data on hard processes @xcite .",
    "the cross sections of inclusive charmed - meson production in the gm - vfns depend heavily on the pdf of the charm quark and less on those of the light quarks . in the following ,",
    "we use the short - hand notation @xmath44 . in the global analyses of refs .",
    "@xcite and many others @xcite , the charm quark is considered a parton .",
    "it is characterized by the pdf @xmath45 that is defined for @xmath46 . in common global qcd analyses at nlo in the @xmath47 scheme ,",
    "the charm quark is considered as a heavy quark , and the ansatz @xmath48 with @xmath49 is assumed as the initial condition for calculating @xmath45 at higher factorization scales @xmath50 .",
    "this is usually referred to as the radiatively - generated - charm approach . in the global analyses cited above",
    ", this ansatz implies that the charm parton does not have any independent degrees of freedom in the parton parameter space , _ i.e. _ , @xmath45 is perturbatively determined by the gluon and light - quark parton parameters .",
    "however , a purely perturbative treatment of the heavy quarks might not be adequate .",
    "this is even more true for the charm quark with mass @xmath51  gev , which is not much larger than typical hadronic scales of a few hundred mev .",
    "in fact , there exists the possibility , that @xmath52 .",
    "actually , for many years , non - perturbative models exist that give non - zero predictions for @xmath53 at some initial factorization scales @xmath54 @xcite . the model of ref .  @xcite was also analyzed in the framework of the ffns @xcite . in this connection , the notion intrinsic charm ( ic ) has become customary .",
    "the ic models of refs .",
    "@xcite and a third one , which will be specified in a later section , were put to a stringent test by extending the recent cteq6.5 global analysis @xcite so that the charm sector has its own independent degrees of freedom at the initial factorization scale @xmath49 @xcite . as a natural extension of the cteq6.5 analysis @xcite , pumplin _ et al . _",
    "@xcite determined the range of magnitude of ic that is consistent with an up - to - date global analysis of hard - scattering data with various assumptions on the shape of the @xmath40 distribution of ic at a low factorization scale .",
    "the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite found the ic of the light - cone models @xcite to be compatible with the global data sample for magnitudes ranging from zero up to three times of what had been estimated in more model - dependent investigations . in these models",
    ", there can be a large enhancement of @xmath45 at @xmath55 , relative to previous analyses that have no ic .",
    "the enhancement persists to rather large scales @xmath17 , up to 100  gev .",
    "therefore , these nonzero ic contributions can have an important effect on charm - initiated processes at hera , rhic , the tevatron , and the lhc .",
    "of course , at hadron colliders , the charm production cross section would be sensitive to @xmath45 at @xmath55 only at sufficiently large values of @xmath56 .",
    "for example , the cross section data at the tevatron @xcite only cover the range @xmath57  gev , so that @xmath58 , which is too small to be sensitive to ic contributions at @xmath55 . only at rhic , where @xmath59 is a factor of 10 smaller , we may expect sufficient sensitivity . at given values of @xmath59 and @xmath10 ,",
    "the sensitivity to @xmath45 at large values of @xmath40 could be further enhanced by performing measurements at large values of @xmath60 , _",
    "i.e. _  in the extreme forward or backward regions @xcite",
    ".    the obvious data that could provide us with information on the ic contribution , would be those on the charm structure function @xmath61 measured at hera .",
    "but these data are already used in the global analysis @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , they do not have a significant effect because of the rather large experimental errors and because the data are mostly located at small values of @xmath40 .",
    "a comparison of such data with results from earlier cteq global analyses may be found in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "after these general remarks , it is clear that it is interesting to study cross sections of inclusive charmed - meson production at rhic ( @xmath13  gev ) and the tevatron ( @xmath9  tev ) more closely and to establish those kinematic regions which are sensitive to the ic component of the proton .",
    "for this purpose , we adopt the gm - vfns approach outlined in ref .",
    "we first compare the @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 production data from ref .",
    "@xcite to nlo predictions evaluated with the respective ff sets @xcite so as to test the latter ( with or without ic ) .",
    "then , we present results for the @xmath1 production cross section under tevatron and rhic experimental conditions assuming the six ic scenarios introduced in ref .",

    "for our calculation of the differential cross section @xmath62 of @xmath63 , where @xmath64 and @xmath65 stands for the residual final state , a crucial ingredient is the non - perturbative ffs for the transitions @xmath66 , where @xmath67 . for @xmath68 ,",
    "such ffs were extracted at lo and nlo in the modified minimal - subtraction ( @xmath47 ) factorization scheme with @xmath69 massless quark flavors several years ago @xcite from the distributions @xmath70 in scaled energy @xmath71 of the cross sections of @xmath72 measured by the aleph @xcite and opal @xcite collaborations at lep1 .",
    "two of us @xcite extended the analysis of ref .",
    "@xcite to include @xmath73 by fitting appropriate opal data @xcite .",
    "besides the total @xmath15 yield , which receives contributions from @xmath74 and @xmath75 decays as well as from light - quark and gluon fragmentation , the aleph and opal collaborations separately specified the contributions due to tagged @xmath75 events yielding @xmath76 hadrons , which then weakly decay to @xmath15 hadrons .",
    "the contribution due to the fragmentation of primary charm quarks into @xmath15 hadrons approximately corresponds to the difference of these two measured distributions .    in refs .",
    "@xcite , the starting point @xmath42 for the dglap evolution of the @xmath66 ffs in the factorization scale @xmath18 were taken to be @xmath77 with @xmath78  gev for @xmath79 and @xmath80 with @xmath81  gev for @xmath82 .",
    "the ffs for @xmath79 were assumed to vanish at @xmath83 and generated through dglap evolution to larger values of @xmath18 .",
    "for consistency with the @xmath47 prescription for the pdfs , these fits of the ffs were repeated for the choice @xmath84 in ref .",
    "these determinations of @xmath15 ffs @xcite were all based solely on data from the @xmath32-boson resonance . in these data ,",
    "the effects of finite quark and hadron masses were greatly suppressed and could safely be neglected .    the most recent fits for @xmath64 reported in ref .",

    "they offered us the opportunity to further constrain the charmed - hadron ffs and test their scaling violations .",
    "however , the lower c.m .",
    "energies of the cleo @xcite and belle @xcite data necessitates the incorporation of quark and hadron mass effects , which are then no longer negligible , into the formalism .",
    "the gm - vfns , which is also the basis of the computation of the cross section of @xmath85 in refs .",
    "@xcite , provides the appropriate theoretical framework also for this ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for details ) .",
    "we adopted the values of @xmath42 and @xmath20 from ref .",
    "@xcite .    in this framework ,",
    "new ffs for @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 mesons were determined through global fits to all available @xmath0 annihilation data , from belle @xcite , cleo @xcite , aleph @xcite , and opal @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the situation at the @xmath32-boson resonance , we had to take into account the effect of electromagnetic initial - state radiation on the belle and cleo data , which distorts the distribution in scaled momentum @xmath86 of the cross section for continuum production in a non - negligible way @xcite .",
    "we found that the global fits suffer from the fact that the belle and cleo data tend to drive the average of @xmath40 of the @xmath36 ffs to larger values , which leads to a somewhat worse description of the aleph and opal data .",
    "since the @xmath87 ffs are only indirectly constrained by the belle and cleo data , namely via their contribution to the dglap evolution , their forms are only feebly affected by the inclusion of these data in the fits . in other words , the @xmath87 ffs are essentially fixed by the aleph and opal data alone .",

    "in fact , they are indispensable for fitting the lower tails of the @xmath88 distributions from belle and cleo    the @xmath89 distributions of the @xmath90 and @xmath91 quark ffs at their starting scales were assumed to obey the bowler ansatz @xcite @xmath92 with three parameters @xmath93 , @xmath39 , and @xmath94 .",

    "however , this will happen at the expense of lowering the accessible @xmath40 values and , thus , of reducing the relative ic effects on the cross sections , especially for the bhps and meson - cloud models . in order to assess the trade - off between higher luminosity and smaller relative shifts in the cross sections , we repeat the @xmath1-meson analysis for the 500  gev mode of rhic .",
    "the results are shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : seven](a ) and ( b ) , which should be compared with figs .",
    "[ fig : five](a ) and [ fig : six ] , respectively .",
    "we observe that , as one passes from 200  gev to 500  gev , the cross section is increased by a factor of 3.6 ( 36 ) at @xmath176  gev ( 20  gev ) in normalization , while its relative shifts due to ic are greatly reduced for the bhps and meson - cloud models , as expected .",
    "in this paper , we updated and improved our previous analysis @xcite of charmed - meson inclusive hadroproduction at nlo in the gm - vfns by using as input the non - perturbative ffs extracted from a global analysis of @xmath0 annihilation data from cesr @xcite , kekb @xcite , and lep1 @xcite in the very same scheme @xcite . in fact , this led to a significantly better description of the @xmath10 distributions of the @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 mesons measured at the tevatron @xcite , as becomes evident by comparing figs .",
    "[ fig : one ] and [ fig : two ] with figs .",
    "1 and 2 in ref .  @xcite .",
    "encouraged by this finding , we then investigated how much room there is for the incorporation of ic inside the colliding hadrons .",
    "specifically , we adopted six ic parameterizations @xcite , which are based on the bhps @xcite , meson - cloud @xcite , and sea - like @xcite models , implemented with two different values of @xmath127 each .",
    "for definiteness , we focused on the @xmath1 meson . in the case of the tevatron , we found that the bhps and meson - cloud models yield insignificant deviations from the zero - ic predictions , while the shift produced by the sea - like model is comparable to the experimental error and tends to worsen the agreement between theory and experiment .",
    "however , the experimental errors in ref .",
    "@xcite are still too sizeable to rule out this model as implemented in ref .",
    "this is likely to change once the full data sample of run  ii is exploited .",
    "since ic typically receives a large fraction @xmath40 of momentum from the parent hadron and the kinematical upper bound on @xmath40 scales with @xmath56 , the sensitivity to ic may be enhanced by lowering the cm .",
    "energy @xmath59 .",
    "this is a strong motivation for studying the inclusive production of charmed mesons with large values of @xmath10 in @xmath4 collisions at rhic , currently operated at @xmath13  gev .",
    "in fact , we found that all three ic models predict sizeable enhancements of the @xmath10 distributions of @xmath1 mesons at rhic , by up to 75% at @xmath177  gev .",
    "we , therefore , encourage our colleagues at rhic to perform a dedicated study of charmed - meson inclusive production in the high-@xmath10 regime . in a future high - energy @xmath4-collision mode of rhic , with @xmath174  gev , which is to accrue more luminosity ,",
    "the cross sections would be increased , while the relative shifts due to ic would be considerably smaller for the bhps and meson - cloud models .",
