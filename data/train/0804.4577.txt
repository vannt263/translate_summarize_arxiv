    "the branching ratio of the  decay ( @xmath2 ) is part of the kloe program of precise and fully inclusive kaon branching ratios ( brs ) measurement .",
    "we have already measured the main @xmath3  @xcite and @xmath4  @xcite branching ratios .",
    "we report here our measurement of the @xmath1 which together with @xmath5  @xcite , @xmath6  @xcite and @xmath7  @xcite covers 95% of all charged kaon decays .",
    "the importance of this measurement is twofold : i ) the most recent measurement based on 16,000 events from a sample of 105 kaon decays , @xmath1=0.21180.0028  @xcite  , dates back to more than 30 years ago and gives no information on the radiation cut - off and ii ) this br is necessary to obtain @xmath8 from measurements normalized to @xmath9  @xcite .",
    "the  branching ratio can be used , together with the @xmath10 branching ratios  @xcite , to determine the relative phase @xmath11 of the @xmath12=0 and @xmath12=2 s - wave @xmath13-scattering amplitudes  @xcite . in the following we report our measurement of the absolute branching ratio @xmath1 performed with the kloe detector using an integrated luminosity @xmath14250 pb collected at , the frascati .",
    "is an  collider operated at the energy of 1020 mev , the mass of the  meson .",
    "equal energy positron and electron beams collide at an angle of ( @xmath150.025 ) radians producing -mesons with a transverse momentum of 13 mev . in its rest frame",
    ", the -meson decays into anti - collinear  pairs of 127 mev momentum and this remains approximately true in the laboratory .",
    "detection of a @xmath16 ( the tagging kaon ) therefore signals the presence of a @xmath17 ( the tagged kaon ) of given momentum and direction .",
    "this procedure , called tagging , allows measurements of absolute brs .",
    "the kloe detector consists of a large volume drift chamber surrounded by an electromagnetic sampling calorimeter .",
    "the entire detector is immersed in an axial magnetic field @xmath18 t. the drift chamber ( dc ) @xcite , 3.3 m long and 4 m in diameter , has a stereo geometry with 12,582 drift cells arranged in 58 layers and operates with a 90% helium-10% isobutane gas mixture .",
    "tracking in the dc provides measurements of the momentum of charged particles with @xmath19 for polar angles larger than 45@xmath20 .",
    "the spatial resolution is 150 @xmath21 m in the bending plane , 2 mm on the @xmath22 coordinate and 3 mm on decay vertices .",
    "the electromagnetic calorimeter ( emc ) @xcite consists of a cylindrical barrel and two endcaps , covering a solid angle of 98% of 4@xmath23 .",
    "particles crossing the lead - scintillator - fiber structure of the emc , segmented into five planes in depth , are detected as local energy deposits .",
    "deposits close in time and space are grouped into clusters .",
    "the energy and time resolution for electromagnetic showers are @xmath24 and @xmath25 , respectively .",
    "the trigger @xcite requires two isolated energy deposits in the emc with : e  @xmath26  50 mev in the barrel and e  @xmath26  150 mev in the endcaps .",
    "cosmic - ray muons are identified as events with two energy deposits with e  @xmath26  30 mev in the outermost emc planes and vetoed at the trigger level ( crv ) . a software filter ( sf ) , based on the topology and multiplicity of emc clusters and dc hits ,",
    "is applied to reject machine background .",
    "the effect of both crv and sf on the br measurement must be determined . in the following",
    "the coordinate system is defined with the @xmath22-axis along the bisector of the  beams , the @xmath27-axis vertical and the @xmath28-axis toward the center of the collider rings and origin at the collision point .",
    "tagging with @xmath29 ( @xmath30 ) and @xmath31 ( @xmath32 ) decays provides two samples of pure @xmath33 for signal search .",
    "these two - body decays are easily identified as peaks in the distribution of the @xmath34 variable , the momentum of the charged decay particle in the kaon rest frame evaluated using the pion mass , as described in @xcite .",
    "the tagging kaon is required to satisfy the trigger request by itself , minimizing the dependence of the trigger efficiency on the decay mode of the tagged kaon . the residual dependency , which we refer to as the tag bias in the following ,",
    "must be determined for the br evaluation .",
    "we choose to measure @xmath35 using  mesons because for them the nuclear interaction correction is negligible , since the probability of interaction is 10@xmath36 for  and 3.4% for .",
    "the branching ratio is determined as : @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the signal count , @xmath39 the number of tagged events and @xmath40 is the overall efficiency , including the detector acceptance @xmath41 and the reconstruction efficiency @xmath42 .",
    "the detector acceptance ( @xmath4159% ) , entering in the final efficiency evaluation , is taken from mc and its value is related to the charged kaon lifetime @xmath43 .",
    "consequently the br depends on @xmath43 as : @xmath44 with @xmath45 ns , the current world average value  @xcite .",
    "a variation of the lifetime of 0.1% changes the br of 0.05% of its value .",
    "the corrections @xmath46 , @xmath47 and @xmath48 account for the cosmic - ray muons veto , the software filter and tag bias effects , respectively .",
