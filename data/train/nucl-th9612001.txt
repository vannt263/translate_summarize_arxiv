    "one of the most exciting topics in nuclear physics is the study of the variation of hadron properties as the nuclear environment changes . in particular , the medium modification of the light vector - mesons is receiving a lot of attention , both theoretically and experimentally .",
    "recent experiments from the helios-3  @xcite and the ceres  @xcite collaborations at the sps / cern energies have shown that there exists a large excess of the @xmath3 pairs in central s + au collisions .",
    "those experimental results may give a hint of some change of hadron properties in nuclei  @xcite .",
    "forthcoming , ultra - relativistic heavy - ion experiments ( eg . at rhic ) are also expected to give significant information on the strong interaction ( qcd ) , through the detection of changes in hadronic properties ( for a review , see ref.@xcite ) .",
    "theoretically , lattice qcd simulations may eventually give the most reliable information on the density and/or temperature dependence of hadron properties in matter .",
    "however , current simulations have been performed only for finite temperature systems with zero baryon density  @xcite .",
    "therefore , many authors have studied the hadron masses in matter using effective theories : the vector dominance model  @xcite , qcd sum rules  @xcite and the walecka model  @xcite , and have reported that the mass decreases in the nuclear medium ( see also ref.@xcite ) .    in the approach based on qcd sum rules ,",
    "the reduction of the mass is mainly due to the four - quark condensates and one of the twist-2 condensates .",
    "however , it has been suggested that there may be considerable , intrinsic uncertainty in the standard assumptions underlying the qcd sum - rule analyses  @xcite . in hadronic models , like quantum hadrodynamics ( qhd )  @xcite ,",
    "the on - shell properties of the scalar ( @xmath0 ) and vector ( @xmath1 ) meson with vacuum polarization were first studied by saito , maruyama and soutome  @xcite , and later by many authors  @xcite .",
    "( good physical arguments concerning the @xmath1 meson in medium were found in ref.@xcite . )",
    "the main reason for the reduction in masses in qhd is the polarization of the dirac sea , where the _ anti - nucleons _ in matter play a crucial role . from the point of view of the quark model , however , the strong excitation of @xmath4-@xmath5 pairs in medium is difficult to understand  @xcite .",
    "recently guichon , saito , rodionov and thomas  @xcite have developed an entirely different model for both nuclear matter and finite nuclei , in which quarks in non - overlapping nucleon bags interact _ self - consistently _ with ( structureless ) scalar ( @xmath0 ) and vector ( @xmath1 and @xmath2 ) mesons in the mean - field approximation ( mfa )  the quark - meson coupling ( qmc ) model .",
    "( the original idea was proposed by guichon in 1988  @xcite .",
    "several interesting applications to the properties of nuclear matter and finite nuclei are also given in a series of papers by saito and thomas  @xcite . )",
    "this model was recently used to calculate detailed properties of static , closed shell nuclei from @xmath6o to @xmath7pb , where it was shown that the model can reproduce fairly well the observed charge density distributions , neutron density distributions etc .",
    "blunden and miller  @xcite have also considered a model for finite nuclei along this line .    to investigate the properties of hadrons , particularly the changes in their masses in nuclear medium",
    ", one must also consider the structure of the mesons , as well as the nucleon .",
    "saito and thomas  @xcite have studied variations of hadron masses and matter properties in _ infinite _ nuclear matter , in which the vector - mesons are also described by bags , but the scalar - meson mass is kept constant , and have shown the decrease of the hadron mass",
    ". now it would be most desirable to extend this picture to _",
    "finite _ nuclei to study the changes of hadron properties in the medium , _",
    "quantitatively_.    our main aim in this paper is to give an effective lagrangian density for finite nuclei , in which the structure effects of the mesons ( @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 ) as well as the nucleon are involved , and to study quantitative changes in the hadron ( including the hyperon ) masses by solving relativistic hartree equations for spherical nuclei derived from the lagrangian density .",
    "( using this model , we also calculate some static properties of closed - shell nuclei . ) in the present model the change in the hadron mass can be described by a simple formula , which is expressed in terms of the number of non - strange quarks and the value of the scalar mean - field ( see also ref.@xcite ) .",
    "this is accurate over a wide range of nuclear density .",
    "we then find a new , simple scaling relation for the changes of hadron masses in the medium : ~ ~ ,   ~ ,   where @xmath8 , with the effective hadron mass , @xmath9 ( @xmath10 ) .",
    "an outline of the paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : qmc ] , the idea of the qmc model is first reviewed .",
    "then , the model is extended to include the effect of meson structure . in sec .",
    "[ sec : numerical ] , parameters in the model are first determined to reproduce the properties of infinite nuclear matter , and the hadron masses in the medium are then discussed .",
    "a new scaling relationship among them is also derived .",
    "the static properties of several closed - shell nuclei are studied in subsection  [ subsec : finite ] , where we also show the changes of the masses of the nucleon , the mesons ( @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 ) and the hyperons ( @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 ) in @xmath14ca and @xmath7pb .",
    "the last section gives our conclusions .",
    "let us suppose that a free nucleon ( at the origin ) consists of three light ( u and d ) quarks under a ( lorentz scalar ) confinement potential , @xmath15 .",
    "then , the dirac equation for the quark field , @xmath16 , is given by _",
    "q(r ) = 0 , [ dirac1 ] where @xmath17 is the bare quark mass .",
    "next we consider how eq.([dirac1 ] ) is modified when the nucleon is bound in static , uniformly distributed ( iso - symmetric ) nuclear matter . in the qmc model",
    "@xcite it is assumed that each quark feels scalar , @xmath18 , and vector , @xmath19 , potentials , which are generated by the surrounding nucleons , as well as the confinement potential ( see also ref.@xcite ) .",
    "since the typical distance between two nucleons around normal nuclear density ( @xmath20 @xmath21 ) is surely larger than the typical size of the nucleon ( the radius @xmath22 is about 0.8 fm ) , the interaction ( except for the short - range part ) between the nucleons should be colour singlet ; e.g. , a meson - exchange potential .",
    "therefore , this assumption seems appropriate when the baryon density , @xmath23 , is not high .",
    "if we use the mean - field approximation for the meson fields , eq.([dirac1 ] ) may be rewritten as _",
    "q(r ) = 0 .",
    "[ dirac2 ] the potentials generated by the medium are constants because the matter distributes uniformly . as",
    "the nucleon is static , the time - derivative operator in the dirac equation can be replaced by the quark energy , @xmath24 . by analogy with the procedure applied to the nucleon in qhd  @xcite , if we introduce the effective quark mass by @xmath25 , the dirac equation , eq.([dirac2 ] ) , can be rewritten in the same form as that in free space , with the mass @xmath26 and the energy @xmath27 , instead of @xmath17 and @xmath28 . in other words ,",
    "the vector interaction has _ no effect on the nucleon structure _ except for an overall phase in the quark wave function , which gives a shift in the nucleon energy .",
    "this fact _ does not _ depend on how to choose the confinement potential , @xmath15 .",
    "then , the nucleon energy ( at rest ) , @xmath29 , in the medium is  @xcite e_n = m_n^(v_s^q ) + 3v_v^q , [ efmas ] where the effective nucleon mass , @xmath30 , depends on _ only the scalar potential _ in the medium .",
    "now we extend this idea to finite nuclei .",
    "the solution of the general problem of a composite , quantum particle moving in background scalar and vector fields that vary with position is extremely difficult .",
    "one has , however , a chance to solve the particular problem of interest to us , namely light quarks confined in a nucleon which is itself bound in a finite nucleus , only because the nucleon motion is relatively slow and the quarks highly relativistic  @xcite .",
    "thus the born - oppenheimer approximation , in which the nucleon internal structure has time to adjust to the local fields , is naturally suited to the problem .",
    "it is relatively easy to establish that the method should be reliable at the level of a few percent  @xcite .    even within the born - oppenheimer approximation ,",
    "the nuclear surface gives rise to external fields that may vary appreciably across the finite size of the nucleon .",
    "our approach in ref.@xcite was to start with a classical nucleon and to allow its internal structure to adjust to minimise the energy of three quarks in the ground - state of a system under constant scalar and vector fields , with values equal to those at the centre of the nucleon . in ref.@xcite ,",
    "the mit bag model was used to describe the nucleon structure .",
    "blunden and miller have also examined a relativistic oscillator model as an alternative model  @xcite .",
    "of course , the major problem with the mit bag ( as with many other relativistic models of nucleon structure ) is that it is difficult to boost .",
    "we therefore solve the bag equations in the instantaneous rest frame ( irf ) of the nucleon  using a standard lorentz transformation to find the energy and momentum of the classical nucleon bag in the nuclear rest frame .",
    "having solved the problem using the meson fields at the centre of the @xmath31nucleon  ( which is a quasi - particle with nucleon quantum numbers ) , one can use perturbation theory to correct for the variation of the scalar and vector fields across the nucleon bag . in first order perturbation theory only the spatial components of the vector potential give a non - vanishing contribution .",
    "( note that , although in the nuclear rest frame only the time component of the vector field is non - zero , in the irf of the nucleon there are also non - vanishing spatial components . )",
    "this extra term is a correction to the spin - orbit force .",
    "as shown in refs.@xcite , the basic result in the qmc model is that , in the scalar ( @xmath0 ) and vector ( @xmath1 ) meson fields , the nucleon behaves essentially as a point - like particle with an effective mass @xmath30 , which depends on the position through only the @xmath0 field , moving in a vector potential generated by the @xmath1 meson , as mentioned near eq.([efmas ] ) .",
    "although we discussed the qmc model using the specific model , namely the bag model , in ref.@xcite , _ the qualitative features we found are correct in any model _ in which the nucleon contains _",
    "relativistic quarks _ and the ( middle- and long - range ) _ attractive _ and ( short - range ) _ repulsive _ n - n forces have _ lorentz - scalar _ and _ vector characters _ , respectively .",
    "let us suppose that the scalar and vector potentials in eq.([dirac2 ] ) are mediated by the @xmath0 and @xmath1 mesons , and introduce their mean - field values , which now depend on position @xmath32 , by @xmath33 and @xmath34 , respectively , where @xmath35 ( @xmath36 ) is the coupling constant of the quark-@xmath0 ( @xmath1 ) meson .",
    "furthermore , we shall add the isovector , vector meson , @xmath2 , and the coulomb field , @xmath37 , to describe finite nuclei realistically  @xcite .",
    "then , the effective lagrangian density for finite nuclei , involving the quark degrees of freedom in the nucleon and the ( structureless ) meson fields , in mfa would be given by  @xcite _ qmc - i&= & [ i - m_n^((r ) ) - g_(r ) _ 0 + & - & g _",

    "we call this model the qmc - i model .",

    "@xmath49 will be discussed further below .",
    "the difference between qmc - i and qhd lies only in the coupling constant @xmath51 , which depends on the scalar field in qmc - i while it is constant in qhd . ( the relationship between qmc and qhd has been already clarified in ref.@xcite .",
    "see also ref.@xcite .",
    ") however , this difference leads to a lot of favorable results , notably the nuclear compressibility , @xcite .",
    "detailed calculated properties of both infinite nuclear matter and finite nuclei can be found in refs.@xcite .",

    "the nucleon mass is a function of the scalar field . because the scalar field is small at low density",

    "therefore , only the first two terms in the right hand side of eq.([nuclm2 ] ) remain , which is exactly the same as the equation for the effective nucleon mass in qhd . by taking the heavy - quark - mass limit in qmc",

    "we denote the bag radius of the nucleon in free space ( matter ) by @xmath22 ( @xmath66 ) . in actual numerical calculations we found that the scalar - density ratio , @xmath56 , decreases linearly ( to a very good approximation ) with @xmath67  @xcite .",
    "then , it is very useful to have a simple parametrization for @xmath59 : c_n ( ) = 1 - a_n ( g _ ) , [ paramcn ] with @xmath68 in mev ( recall @xmath69 ) and @xmath70 ( mev@xmath71 ) for @xmath17 = 5 mev and @xmath22 = 0.8 fm .",

    "the most popular parametrizations are called nl1 , nl2  @xcite and nl - sh  @xcite , and the non - linear terms in those parametrizations are given as _ qhd^nl = - m_^2 ^2 + g_2 ^3 + g_3 ^4 , [ nls2 ] where @xmath125 and @xmath126 take respectively a positive ( negative ) [ positive ] and positive ( negative ) [ positive ] values in nl1 ( nl2 ) [ nl - sh ] .",
    "since the non - linear @xmath0 terms provide the self - energy of @xmath0 meson , it changes the @xmath0 mass in matter . comparing eq.([nls2 ] ) with eq.([nls ] ) , we can see that the effective @xmath0 mass in nl2 _ increases _ at low nuclear density while the @xmath0 mass _ decreases _ in nl1 and nl - sh in mfa .",
    "however , from the point of view of a field theory , like the nambu  jona - lasinio model , an increase of the @xmath0 mass in the medium seems unlikely  @xcite .",
    "( we should note that the values of @xmath125 in those parametrizations are small compared with the corresponding one in eq.([nls ] ) . )",
    "furthermore , from the point of view of field theory , @xmath126 in eq.([nls2 ] ) should be negative because the vacuum must be stable  @xcite .",
    "therefore , we can conclude that one would expect to find @xmath127 and @xmath128 in eq.([nls2 ] ) .",
    "unfortunately , the above three parametrizations used in nuclear physics do not satisfy the condition , while our lagrangian , eq.([nls ] ) , does",
    ". it will be very interesting to explore the connection between various coupling strengths found empirically in earlier work and those found in our approach .    finally , we would like to give some caveats concerning the present calculation .",
    "the basic idea of the model is that the mesons are locally coupled to the quarks .",
    "therefore , in the present model the effect of short - range correlations among the quarks , which would be associated with overlap of the hadrons , are completely neglected . at very high density",
    "these would be expected to dominate and the present model must eventually break down there ( probably beyond @xmath129 ) .",
    "furthermore , the pionic cloud of the hadron  @xcite should be considered explicitly in any truly quantitative study of hadron properties in medium .",
    "we note that subtleties such as scalar - vector mixing in medium and the splitting between longitudinal and transverse masses of the vector mesons  @xcite have been ignored in the present mean - field study .",
    "although the former appears to be quite small in qhd the latter will certainly be important in any attempt to actually measure the mass shift .",
