    "since resolved blazars constitute the class of gamma - ray emitters with the largest number of identified members @xcite , unresolved blazars are expected to have a significant contribution to the extragalactic gamma - ray background ( egrb ) at gev energies @xcite . the amount of this contribution remains unclear , ranging from a few to @xmath0 of the egrb @xcite and depending not only the distribution of blazars with respect to gamma - ray luminosity and redshift ( the blazar gamma - ray luminosity function , glf ) , but also on the distribution of blazar spectral indices ( sid ) at gev energies @xcite .",
    "additionally , photons with energies greater than  20 gev can interact with the lower energy photons of the extragalactic background light ( ir / opt./uv ; ebl ) as they propagate from high redshifts creating electromagnetic cascades of electrons , positrons , and photons .",
    "as blazars also constitute a cosmological population , the collective emission of unresolved blazars at gamma - ray energies will exhibit an absorption feature at the high end of the _ fermi _ lat energy range .",
    "the shape of the absorption feature is sensitive to the blazar glf and the ebl @xcite .",
    "the created cascade emission from absorption can enhance the collective blazar intensity at lower energies with the amount of enhancement being sensitive to blazar spectra at very - high energies @xcite .",
    "the contribution to the egrb due to blazars can be viewed as the superposition of the collective intensity of _ intrinsic _ blazar spectra and the contribution from the cascade radiation from the interactions of very - high  energy photons from blazars with the ebl : @xmath1 where the intensity , @xmath2 , is given in units of photons per unit energy per unit time per unit area per unit solid angle emitted at observer - frame energy , @xmath3 .",

    "we determine the blazar contributions to the egrb including cascade radiation assuming that the two blazar sub - populations , bl lacertae - like objects ( bl lacs ) and flat spectrum radio quasars ( fsrqs ) , form separate populations with respect to emission and evolution .",
    "we propagate photons from distinct glfs and sids for the two blazar sub - populations .",
    "we assume bl lacs to follow a luminosity - dependent density evolution model ( ldde ) and fsrqs to follow the pure luminosity evolution model ( ple ) ( for more information about both models , see * ? ? ?",

    "the effect of the cascade radiation is to flatten the overall collective intensity from blazars .",
    "below @xmath36 gev , the cascade radiation for the two models is roughly comparable , though there is slightly more cascade radiation at the lowest energies for the stecker model . above @xmath36 gev",
    ", there is more cascade radiation for the gilmore model than there is for the stecker model due to the enhanced uv absorption in the stecker model .",
    "the resulting high - energy absorption feature in the overall spectrum is much more prominent in the stecker case than in the gilmore case owing to the higher uv background in the stecker ebl model tens of gev are most likely to interact with uv background photons .",
    "thus , unsurprisingly , models with high uv backgrounds will result in more suppression at high energies . ] .",
    "this is most especially true for the fsrqs , which follow the ple model of evolution , resulting in more high - energy photons being produced at higher redshifts than in the ldde model @xcite .",
    "the hard spectra of bl lacs cause the resulting cascade radiation to be considerable relative to that of the collective intensity from their intrinsic spectra even though their collective radiation tends to be concentrated at low redshifts in the ldde model .",
    "in fact , the total intensity from bl lacs could dominate the egrb at high energies and even overproduce it , though it does nt explain the lower energy intensity .",
    "by contrast , the relatively steep spectra of fsrqs are not conducive to much cascade radiation even though their collective radiation is concentrated more at high redshifts ; hence , most of the collective intensity attributed to fsrqs occurs at lower energies .",
    "thus , while the bl lacs ( including cascades ) dominate the collective blazar intensity at the highest energies , the fsrqs dominate at the lowest energies .",
