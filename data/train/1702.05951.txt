    "a very powerful paradigm when manipulating a huge graph @xmath0 is to _ compress _ it , in the sense of transforming it into a small graph @xmath2 ( or alternatively , into a succinct data structure ) that maintains certain features ( quantities ) of @xmath0 , like distances , cuts , or flows .",
    "the basic idea is that once the compressed graph @xmath2 is computed in a preprocessing step , further processing can be performed on @xmath2 instead of on @xmath0 , using less resources like runtime and memory , or achieving better accuracy when the solution is approximate .",
    "this paradigm has lead to remarkable successes , such as improved running time for fundamental problems , and the introduction of important concepts , from spanners @xcite to cut and spectral sparsifier @xcite . in these examples",
    ", @xmath2 is a subgraph of @xmath0 with the _ same _ vertex set but _ sparse _ , and is sometimes called an edge sparsifier .",
    "in contrast , we aim to reduce the number of vertices in @xmath0 , using so - called vertex sparsifiers .    in the vertex - sparsification scenario , @xmath0 has @xmath1 designated vertices called _",
    "terminals _ , and the goal is to construct a small graph @xmath2 that contains these terminals , and maintains some of their features inside @xmath0 , like distances or cuts . throughout ,",
    "a _ @xmath1-terminal network _",
    ", denoted @xmath8 , is an undirected graph @xmath9 with edge weights @xmath10 and terminals set @xmath11 of size @xmath12 .",
    "as usual , a _ cut _ is a partition of the vertices , and its _ cutset _ is the set of edges that connect between different parts . interpreting the edge weights as capacities , the _ cost _ of a cut @xmath13 is the total weight of the edges in the respective cutset .",
    "we say that a cut @xmath13 _ separates _ a terminals subset @xmath14 from @xmath15 ( or in short that it is _ @xmath16-separating _ ) , if all of @xmath16 is on one side of the cut and @xmath17 on the other side , i.e. , @xmath18 equals either @xmath16 or @xmath17 .",
    "we denote by @xmath19 the minimum cost of an @xmath16-separating cut in @xmath0 , where by a consistent tie - breaking mechanism , such as edge - weights perturbation , we assume throughout that the minimum is attained by only one cut , which we call the _ minimum terminal cut _ ( of @xmath16 ) .    a network @xmath20 is a _ cut sparsifier of @xmath8 with quality @xmath21 and size @xmath22 _ ( or in short , a @xmath23-cut - sparsifier ) , if its size is @xmath24 and @xmath25    in words , requires that every minimum terminal cutin @xmath2 approximates the corresponding one in @xmath0 . here and throughout , we always consider only @xmath26 , although for brevity we will not write it explicitly .",
    "two special cases are particularly important for us .",
    "one is quality @xmath4 , or a @xmath27-cut - sparsifier , which is known in the literature as a _ mimicking network _ and was introduced by @xcite .",
    "the second case is a cut sparsifier @xmath2 that is furthermore a minor of @xmath0 , and then we call it a _ minor cut sparsifier _ , and similarly for a _ minor mimicking network_. in all our results , the sparsifier @xmath2 is actually a minor of @xmath0 , which can be important in some applications , for instance , if @xmath0 is planar , then also @xmath2 admits planar - graph algorithms .    in known constructions of mimicking networks ( @xmath4 ) ,",
    "the sparsifier s size @xmath28 highly depends on the number of constraints   it needs to satisfy . clearly , there are at most @xmath29 constraints , one for every minimum terminal cut(this can be slightly optimized , e.g. , by symmetry of @xmath16 and @xmath17 ) , and this naive bound was used to design mimicking networks whose size @xmath28 is ( a ) exponential in the number of minimum terminal cuts , namely @xmath30 , when @xmath0 is an arbitrary network @xcite ; and ( b ) polynomial in that number , namely @xmath31 , when @xmath0 is planar @xcite .",
    "khan and raghavendra  @xcite used the submodularity of the function @xmath32 to reduce the number of constraints and improve the size @xmath28 ( for general networks ) to be the @xmath33-th dedekind number , roughly @xmath34 , which is still doubly exponential in @xmath1 . our first main result ( below ) identifies a subset of minimum terminal cutsthat essentially generates all the other ones .",
    "in general , this subset might include all the minimum terminal cuts , but in planar graphs , it leads to new bounds .",
    "perhaps the most outstanding question in this area , see e.g. @xcite , asks about tradeoffs between the quality and the size of cut sparsifiers .",
    "we now formulate it for quality that approaches @xmath35 , with an explicit conjecture about the size bound .",
    "[ conj : tradeoff ] every network @xmath0 admits a @xmath36-cut - sparsifier .    in general networks , even a weaker bound of quality @xmath37 and size @xmath38 is open , and the best quality known with such polynomial size is @xmath39 @xcite .",
    "some evidence in support of conjecture  [ conj : tradeoff ] is a construction of a @xmath40-cut - sparsifier @xcite , where @xmath41 is the total weight of edges incident to the terminals , assuming integral weights , but it seems challenging to replace @xmath41 with a function of @xmath1 .    even for planar networks ,",
    "conjecture  [ conj : tradeoff ] is still open , although here an @xmath42-cut - sparsifier is known @xcite .",
    "another result in this direction , which may be viewed as positive evidence , is a similar bound of @xmath36-cut - sparsifier but for a different family of networks , whose non - terminals form an independent set @xcite .",
    "we make progress on this front of planar networks by studying the special case where all terminals lie on the same face .",
    "this special case was extensively studied in several contexts , such as all - pairs shortest paths , minimum @xmath43-cuts and multicommodity flows , often as a building block for all planar graphs , see for example the widely cited papers @xcite .",
    "our second main result ( below ) provides a new version of the well - known duality between cuts and distances in planar graphs , to establish a strong connection between minor cut sparsification and the following problem of distance sparsification , which was studied previously in  @xcite as a separate question with no formal connections to cut sparsifiers .",
    "a network @xmath20 is called a _ @xmath23-distance - approximating minor ( dam ) of @xmath8 _ , if its size is @xmath24 and @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the shortest - path metric in @xmath0 with respect to @xmath46 as edge lengths .    probably the closest notion to duality between cut sparsification and distance sparsification is  rcke s powerful method @xcite , adapted to vertex sparsification as in @xcite .",
    "however , the cut sparsifier @xmath2 in this method is inherently randomized ; this is acceptable if @xmath2 contains only the terminals , because we can take the `` expected '' graph @xmath47 , but it is calamitous when @xmath2 contains non - terminals , and then each randomized outcome has different vertices .",
    "we provide two new insights about the structure of cut sparsifiers , and then apply them to obtain improved cut sparsifiers ( and data structures ) for certain planar graphs . in all our results ,",
    "the sparsifier @xmath2 is a minor of the input graph @xmath0 .",
    "for brevity , the statements in this section are informal , but include pointers to their formal counterparts in the technical sections .",
    "our first main contribution identifies a subset of the minimum terminal cutsthat generates all the other ones .",
    "we call a cut or a cutset _ elementary _ if removing its edges disconnects the graph into exactly two connected components .",
    "[ informal ; see theorems  [ thm : e_s disjoint union elementary cuts ] and  [ thm : elementary cuts for general graphs ] ] every minimum terminal cutset in @xmath0 is a disjoint union of elementary ones .",
    "consequently , if all elementary cutsets in a network @xmath2 approximate the corresponding ones in @xmath0 within factor @xmath21 , then @xmath2 is a cut sparsifier of @xmath0 of quality @xmath48 .    the main applications of this theorem to cut sparsifiers are as follows ( see also table  [ table : mimicking ] ) .",
    "throughout , for a planar network @xmath0 ( and assuming a fixed drawing of it ) , we let @xmath49 be the minimum number of faces that are incident to all the @xmath1 terminals .",
    "observe that @xmath50 is the aforementioned special case , where all terminals lie on the same face .    *",
    "all planar networks admit a minor mimicking network of size @xmath51 , which improves the previous bound of @xcite by a factor of @xmath1 ( see corollary [ cor : ub 2 ^ 2k planar graphs ] ) .",
    "* planar networks with @xmath6 admit a minor mimicking network of size @xmath52 , which in the special case @xmath50 gives @xmath53 ( see theorem [ thm : ub mimicking bounded faces ] ) .",
    "yet another application of the above theorem is to succinct data structures that store all the minimum terminal cutsof an input graph @xmath0 .",
    "for example , for planar graphs whose terminals are all on the same face , i.e. @xmath54 , our data structure requires only @xmath55 words , see section  [ sec : terminal cut scheme ]",
    ". moreover , known bounds on the flow - cut gap in these networks @xcite immediately extend the above cut sparsifiers to flow sparsifiers of related quality ( where @xmath2 is called a flow sparsifier if it supports approximately the same multicommodity flows between terminals as @xmath0 ) , see section  [ sec : ub mimicking planar graphs ] for details .",
    "our second main contribution is a duality between minor cut sparsification and minor distance sparsification ( i.e. , dam ) , applicable to planar networks @xmath0 with all their terminals on the same face , i.e. , @xmath54 .",
    "the two directions of this duality are quite similar , but it is simpler to state each direction separately .    for every planar @xmath1-terminal network @xmath0 with @xmath54 , there is a planar @xmath1-terminal network @xmath56 with @xmath57 , such that @xmath58    for every planar @xmath1-terminal network @xmath0 with @xmath54 , there is a planar @xmath1-terminal network @xmath56 with @xmath57 , such that @xmath59    in planar networks @xmath0 with @xmath54 , the flow - cut gap is @xmath35 by @xcite , and therefore in this graph family , the same bounds hold for all three problems of minor sparsification of distances , of cuts and of flows . in particular , this equivalence yields new results for networks @xmath0 with @xmath54 ( see section [ sec : reduction application ] ) :    * alternative proof ( based on dam ) of a minor mimicking network of size @xmath60 . *",
    "alternative proof ( based on dam ) that a minor mimicking network requires size @xmath61 .",
    "* moreover , improvements in the last two bounds imply new results for dam . * a minor @xmath62-cut - sparsifier of @xmath0 , which can be viewed as a partial progress on conjecture  [ conj : tradeoff ] .",

    "firstly , let @xmath318 be the dual graph of @xmath316 , where every terminal min - cut in @xmath316 is equivalent to a shortest cycle that separates terminal faces .",
    "notice that again each terminal face @xmath526 in @xmath318 contains the two edges @xmath527 and @xmath528 with capacity 0 on their boundary .",
    "secondly , we `` open '' each shortest cycle in @xmath533 into a shortest path between terminals by removing the vertex @xmath308 and all its incidence edges , and denote this new graph by @xmath2 .",
    "the terminals of @xmath2 are all the vertices @xmath534 such that @xmath535 is an edge in @xmath318 , which are equal to the original terminals of @xmath0",
    ". see figure [ fgr : reduction outer dpm to outer cuts ] from right to left for illustration .      .",
    "the second is the graph @xmath306 , where the additional vertex and edges and terminal faces colored in blue . and",
    "the third graph @xmath309 and its terminals are colored in red .",
    "the bold red edges are the dual of the blue edges , and both of them have capacity 0.,scaledwidth=90.0% ]          given that @xmath316 is an @xmath23-cut - sparsifier , i.e. @xmath410 , we will prove that @xmath411 .",
    "we can assume that @xmath316 is a simple planar graph ( if not , we can replace all the parallel edges between every two vertices by one edge where its capacity is the sum over all the capacities of these parallel edges ) , thus @xmath537 . plug it in euler s formula to get @xmath538 . by the reduction construction @xmath539 , and",
    "the lemma follows .",
    "given that @xmath316 is a minor of @xmath309 , and that minor is close under deletion and contraction of edges we get that @xmath318 is a minor of @xmath306 .",
    "now by deleting the same vertex @xmath308 together with all its incidence edges from both @xmath306 and @xmath318 , we get the graphs @xmath0 and @xmath2 correspondingly .",
    "therefore @xmath2 is a minor of @xmath0 , and the lemma follows .",
    "notice that connecting all the terminals to a new vertex using edges with capacity 0 is equivalent to uniting all the terminals into one vertex , and also splitting the vertex @xmath308 to @xmath1 new terminals is equivalent to disconnecting all the terminals by deleting that vertex .",
    "thus our reduction is equivalent to the reduction of theorem [ thm : reduction from outer face cuts to dam ] .",
    "in particular , lemma [ lma : equivalence minimum circuits and shortest paths ] holds on the graphs @xmath542 and on the graphs @xmath543 correspondingly , i.e. every shortest path between two terminals @xmath524 and @xmath468 in @xmath0 ( or @xmath2 ) corresponds to a minimum circuit in @xmath306 ( or @xmath318 ) that separates between the terminal faces @xmath544 to @xmath545 and vise versa .",
    "let @xmath546 be a set of terminals in @xmath309 , where every terminal @xmath547 corresponds to the terminal face @xmath548 in @xmath306 . by the duality between cuts and circuits we get that @xmath549 and @xmath550 .",
    "since @xmath316 is an @xmath23-cut - sparsifier of @xmath309 we derive the inequalities @xmath540 and the lemma follows .    by lemma  [ lma : reduction h dam of size beta ] , lemma [ lma : h is a minor of g ] and lemma [ lma : reduction h is alpha dam of g ] the @xmath1-terminal network @xmath2 is an @xmath304-dam of @xmath0 and the theorem follows ."
