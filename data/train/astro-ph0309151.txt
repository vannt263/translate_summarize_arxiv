    "has been discovered on 1999 october 17 during a search for millisecond pulsar ( msps ) in galactic globular clusters ( ggcs ) in progress at the parkes radiotelescope @xcite .",
    "it is a binary millisecond pulsar with a spin period of 3.26 ms , an orbital period of 0.84 days and very low eccentricity ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "precise celestial coordinates ( @xmath6 , @xmath7 ) have been recently obtained for this source from pulsar timing observations @xcite .",
    "this position is far away ( @xmath2 ) from the cluster optical center : indeed is the more off - centered pulsar among the sample of 44 msps whose position in the respective cluster is known , and it suggests that this object might be the result of strong interactions occurred in the cluster core .",
    "@xcite explored a number of possibilities for the peculiar location of + @xmath0 : a careful analysis led to discard the hypothesis of a primordial binary ( born either in the halo or in the core of the cluster ) and to reject also the possibility of a 3-body scattering or exchange event off core stars .",
    "hence they conjectured that a more massive target ( either a binary or a single intermediate - mass black hole , see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) could have provided the necessary thrust to propel into its current halo orbit at an acceptable event rate .    moreover , beside @xmath0 , ngc6752 hosts also the second most displaced msp ever seen in a globular ( psr j1911@xmath86000c ) and at least two ( out the three ) msps located in the cluster center ( psr - b and psr - e , see figure 2 in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) experience strong acceleration , implying an unusually high central mass to light ratio @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "@xcite showed that ngc6752 is a dynamically evolved cluster probably undergoing a post - core - collapse bounce and investigated scenarios for simultaneously explaining both the anomalous acceleration of psr - b and psr - e and the ejection of and psr j1911@xmath86000c , concluding that the existence of a binary black hole of intermediate mass @xcite could be a viable possibility .",
    "optical detection of the companion to a millisecond pulsar in a globular cluster proved particularly helpful in assessing the origin and the evolution of the binary , besides supporting its cluster membership ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in fact , unlike the systems in the galactic field , the age , metallicity , extinction , distance and hence intrinsic luminosity and radius can be estimated from the parent cluster parameters .",
    "hence , we undertook a systematic program @xcite devoted to the optical identification of msps companion in ggcs ; as a part of this project in this letter we present the identification of the optical counterpart to the psr j1911 - 5958a companion .",
    "the photometric data presented here consist of a set of high resolution images obtained by using the camera fors1 mounted at the _ antu _ unit telescope 1 ( ut1 ) of the very large telescope ( vlt ) at eso on cerro paranal ( chile ) on three nigths in march , april and may 2003 .",
    "all the observations have been performed in the high resolution ( hr ) mode of fors1 . in this configuration",
    "the plate - scale is @xmath10 and the fors1 @xmath11 pixel@xmath12 array has a global field of view of @xmath13 .",
    "the data comprise eight 220s @xmath14-band exposures , five 360s @xmath15-band exposures and three 1500s @xmath16-band exposures , roughly centered on the ( hereafter msp - a ) nominal position .",
    "all the observations were performed in service mode under good seeing conditions ( fwhm@xmath17 ) .    a sub - image of @xmath18 pixels centered on the nominal position of the msp - a has been extracted from the original frames and carefully analized .",
    "all the reductions have been carried out using romafot @xcite , a package specifically developed to perform accurate photometry in crowded fields , allowing for a visual inspection of the quality of the psf - fitting procedure . in order to optimize",
    "the search for faint objects a _ median_-combined image in each band has been obtained and the search procedure has been performed on the deepest combined image .",
    "then the masks with the star positions have been adapted to each image and the psf - fitting procedure performed on each individual frame separately .",
    "the resulting instrumental magnitudes have been transformed to a common photometric system and then averaged .",
    "thus , a final catalogue with the coordinates and the average instrumental magnitude in each filter has been compiled for all the stars identified in the considered sub - image .",
    "photometric calibration of the instrumental magnitudes ( in the @xmath15 and @xmath16 band ) was obtained using four photometric standard stars @xcite secured under photometric conditions .",
    "since no accurate calibration of the v filter was possible with the data secured in service , we calibrated the @xmath14 magnitude by using @xmath19 stars in common with the @xmath20 catalog recently published by @xcite .",
    "the stars in common between the two catalogs permitted also an independent check of the calibration obtained in the @xmath15 band , displaying agreement within a few hundredths of magnitude .",
    "the stars identified in the considered sub - image have been reported to an absolute astrometric system by using the 200 stars in common with the @xcite catalog ( already astrometized ) .",
    "the details of the procedure adopted to derive the astrometric solution are described in other papers @xcite . in short ,",
    "the new astrometric _ guide star catalog _ ( @xmath21 ) was used to search for astrometric standard stars lying in the considered field of view ( fov ) . at the end of the procedure ,",
    "the rms residuals were of the order of @xmath22 both in ra and dec and we assume this value as representative of the astrometric accuracy .",
    "figure  1 shows the @xmath23 and @xmath24 color magnitude diagram ( cmd ) for the stars ( _ large filled circles _ ) identified in the @xmath25 fors1 sub - image considered here .",
    "most of the stars trace a clean and well defined main sequence ( ms ) spanning almost 8 mags in the @xmath16 band reaching @xmath26 .",
    "only a few sparce objects , showing a blue excess , are visible on the left side of the ms .",
    "the most extreme blue objects in the cmds are co white dwarfs ( wds ) : once the ms is matched , they nicely overlaps the position of a co - wds population ( shown as _ small empty circles _ in fig .",
    "1 ) observed in this cluster by @xcite and ( * ? ? ?",
    "* , in preparation ) . in particular , the colors and the luminosities of the three co - wds found here and of the previously observed population agree with the theoretical cooling sequence for @xmath27 hydrogen rich wds @xcite ( drawn as",
    "_ heavy dashed line _ in fig .  1 ) .",
    "on the basis of the accurate astrometric positions obtained from the photometric catalog , we identified a blue object ( hereafter @xmath0 ) lying at only @xmath28 from the nominal position of @xmath0 .",
    "finding chart ( in the @xmath15-band filter ) for + is shown in fig .  2 .",
    "only a few objects ( @xmath29 ) are lying in the region of the cmd to the left of the ms : considering the fov of the sub - image , there is a very small probability ( @xmath30 ) of detecting one of the blue objects just by chance in a circular aperture of radius @xmath31 ( corresponding to the uncertainty in the relative radio - optical astrometry ) centered on the pulsar position .",
    "the position of is marked as a _",
    "large empty square _ in the cmds in fig .  1 , whereas absolute coordinates and magnitudes are listed in table  1 .",
    "taking into account the expected variability of this object and the global uncertainty in the calibration of the photometric zero - point , we conservatively adopted an overall uncertainty in the reported magnitudes of 0.15 mag . while we were writing this letter a not yet refereed paper by bassa et al .",
    "appeared on the web ( astro - ph/0307340 ) also presenting the optical identification of this object .",
    "though the identification is consistent with that presented here , it can be considered , at most , a preliminary detection since the object is nearly at the detection limit in the exposures utilized in that paper .",
    "the deep vlt observations presented here allow us to measure the object with a quite high s / n ratio ( @xmath32 ) and to derive the photometric properties of the star with much higher accuracy .",
    "the location of in the cmds ( @xmath33 mag bluer than the ms in the diagram ) excludes it is a co - wd whilst it resembles @xmath34 , the companion to psr j00247203u in 47 tuc @xcite , which was suggested @xcite to be a low mass helium core wd ( he - wd ) from the comparison with theoretical models by @xcite .",
    "however , the he - wd tracks used by @xcite were computed for progenitors with high ( solar ) metallicity ( @xmath35 ) .    here",
    "we have applied the same procedure taking advantage of a new set of tracks specifically computed @xcite for globular cluster applications , i.e. assuming progenitors with low metallicities . in particular",
    ", we used the cooling tracks at @xmath36 which are the closest to the cluster metallicity ( @xmath37=-1.43\\pm0.04 $ ] ) as recently derived by @xcite .",
    "the cooling sequences for two he - wd masses ( 0.172 and 0.197 , respectively ) are over - plotted in fig .  1 ( _ light dashed lines _ ) .",
    "the models have been drawn by adopting a distance modulus @xmath38 ( from the homogeneous distance scale for 61 ggcs derived by * ? ? ? * ) and a reddening @xmath39 @xcite .",
    "note that the distance modulus adopted here is consistent both with the estimate obtained from the wd cooling sequence ( @xmath40 ) by @xcite and with the most recent determination ( @xmath41 ) derived from ms fitting by @xcite .",
    "inspection of fig .",
    "1 reveals that luminosity and color of well agree with its being a he - wd of mass in the range @xmath42 in particular , from the @xmath43 models of masses @xmath44 and @xmath45 by @xcite , we derive the following estimates for the properties of @xmath0 : a temperature in the interval @xmath46 , a gravity @xmath47 , a luminosity @xmath48 , a radius @xmath49 cm and a cooling age in the range @xmath50 gyr .",
    "we have identified the optical companion to the millisecond pulsar located at 3.3 half mass radii from the center of the globular cluster ngc6752 . @xmath51 and @xmath14 magnitudes ( and related colors ) of the optical source are compatible with its being a helium white dwarf hosted in the globular s halo .    from the pulsar mass - function ( 0.0026887 ,",
    "* ) , it results a minimum companion mass ( corresponding to a system seen edge - on , i.e. with orbital inclination @xmath52 ) @xmath53 for a pulsar mass of @xmath54 @xcite . given the upper limit ( @xmath55 ) of the range of masses of inferred from the cooling tracks of @xcite",
    ", we can constrain the inclination @xmath56 to be larger than @xmath57 . adopting a larger value for the pulsar mass would result in a even larger lower limit for the orbital plane inclination .",
    "dynamical friction can rapidly drive back to the cluster core a object of total mass of order @xmath58 moving on a highly eccentric orbit in the cluster potential .",
    "in particular , ejection of from the core to the outskirts of ngc6752 ( implying a radial orbit ) can not be occurred more than @xmath59 gyr ago @xcite .",
    "the cooling age of is longer than @xmath60 implying that any dynamical event responsible for the ejection probably acted on an already recycled millisecond pulsar .",
    "hence , the optical identification of tends to exclude _",
    "( i ) _ the scenarios in which the recycling process occurred after ( or was triggered by ) the dynamical encounter which propelled the pulsar in the cluster halo ( but see the discussion in sigurdsson , 2003 ) and _ ( ii ) _ any kinds of interactions imparting a significant eccentricity to the binary pulsar ( having excluded a recent mass transfer phase , the circularization of the system at the present level , @xmath61 would require a time much longer than @xmath62 ) .",
    "in particular , among the proposed black hole hypotheses @xcite a binary black hole of mass in the range 10 - 200  seems the most plausible candidate .    since the first discovery of an optical counterpart to a binary msp companion in ggc ( @xmath34 , the companion to psr  j0024@xmath87203u in 47 tuc ; * ? ? ? * ) , the zoo of the optical msp counterparts in ggcs is rapidly increasing : a surprisingly bright object ( com  j1740@xmath85340 , either a subgiant or a heated ms ) has been discovered @xcite in ngc6397 , and a very faint source ( w29 , the companion to psr  j0024@xmath87204w ) has been found by @xcite in 47 tuc . moreover , an additional potential msp companion ( w34 in 47 tuc ) has been recently discussed by @xcite .",
    "3 shows a comparison of the photometric properties of the available optical identifications of msp companions hosted in ggcs .",
    "the ms stars of ngc6752 , the models of co - wd and two he - wd cooling sequences by @xcite are also plotted in fig .  3 as reference .",
    "two among the five sources seem really peculiar : i.e. , the bright object in ngc6397 ( which is as luminous as the turn off stars and shows quite red colours ) and the faint w29 in 47 tuc , which is also too red to be a he - wd @xcite .",
    "bassa et al .",
    "( 2003 ) suggested a similiarity between the photometric properties of and w29 in 47 tuc .",
    "as can be seen from figure 3 , is significantly brighter and bluer than w29 and it turns out to be more similar to @xmath34 .",
    "indeed , @xmath34 and are found to lie nearly on the same mass he - wd cooling sequence and w34 in 47 tuc curiously shares the same photometric properties of . indeed ,",
    "if confirmed as a msp companion , w34 would be the third he - wd companion orbiting a msp in ggcs roughly located on the same - mass cooling sequence .",
    "if further supported by additional cases , this evidence could confirm that a low mass @xmath63 he - wd orbiting a msp is the favoured system generated by the recycling process of msps not only in the galactic field @xcite but also in ggcs @xcite .",
    "is relatively bright and will allow detailed follow - up observations : both optical time series photometry and spectroscopy of this object are planned at the eso vlt , in order to determine the parameters of the he - wd companion , the mass ratio of the two components of the binary and eventually the mass of the neutron star .",
