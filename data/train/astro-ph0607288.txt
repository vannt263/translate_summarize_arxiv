    "it is now widely recognized that weak gravitational lensing is a unique and valuable tool to study the mass distribution of clusters of galaxies as well as large scale structure in the universe since it directly measures the projected mass distribution of the lens regardless of the physical state of the system and the nature of matter content ( bartelmann & schneider 2001 ) . in the usual treatment of the weak lensing analysis , the quadrupole moment of background galaxy images is used to quantify the image ellipticity .",
    "then the lensing properties are extracted from the image ellipticities by assuming that source galaxies are randomly oriented in the absence of gravitational lensing . in practice",
    "we average over a local ensemble of image ellipticities to estimate the lensing properties .",
    "the local ensemble should contain a sufficient number of background galaxies to increase the signal - to - noise ratio of local shear measurements , whereas the region that contains the galaxies should be small enough to guarantee the constancy of the lensing properties over the region .",
    "the latter condition is necessary in the usual prescription for weak lensing because it is based on the locally linearized lens equation . on the other hand , the former limits the resolution of mass maps reconstructed via weak lensing techniques , which is of the order 1 arcmin in ground - based observations .",
    "space - based high - resolution imaging surveys , such as the cosmic evolution survey ( scoville et al .",
    "2007 ) with the _ hubble space telescope _ ( hst ) and the proposed _",
    "supernova / acceleration probe _",
    "( snap ) wide weak lensing survey ( massey et al . 2004 ) , will provide significant gains with a higher surface number density of well - resolved galaxies due to the small , stable point spread function ( psf ) , which will enable high - resolution mapping of the lensing mass distribution down to an angular resolution of @xmath1 . on the other hand ,",
    "such a small psf will allow us to resolve not only the elliptical component , described by the quadrupole moment , but also higher - order shape properties of background galaxy images , which could also carry some sort of information of lensing properties .",
    "it may be therefore interesting to see if such higher multipole moments of the shape are useful for the weak lensing analysis .",
    "there have been some attempts to generalize the weak lensing analysis to include higher order moments of the light distribution .",
    "goldberg and natarajan ( 2002 ) suggested that higher order effects in gravitational lensing , described by the third order derivatives of the lensing potential , can give rise to octopole moments of the light distribution for background galaxies .",
    "goldberg and bacon ( 2005 ) have further developed their approach and proposed a new inversion technique based on the shapelets formalism ( refregier 2003 ; refreger & bacon 2003 ; massey and refregier 2005 ) , and labeled this third order effect as the _ flexion _ of background images .",
    "irwin and shmokova ( 2006 ) developed a similar analysis method for measuring the higher order lensing effects and applied this method to the hst deep field north .",
    "recently irwin , shmokova , & anderson 2006 reported on the detection of lensing signals in the udf due to small scale structure using their `` cardioid '' and `` displacement '' techniques . recently",
    "goldberg & leonard ( 2006 ) has extended our holics approach to developed a method to correct holics for the effect of isotropic point spread function ( psf ) .    in the present paper , following the flexion formalism by bacon et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , we study a possibility to use higher multipole moments of background source images for the weak lensing analysis , and demonstrate via simulations how such higher order moments can improve the accuracy and resolution of a weak lensing mass reconstruction .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "after briefly summarizing the basis of weak lensing and the flexion formalism in section 2 , we introduce higher multipole moments of galaxy images in section 3 .",
    "we define certain combinations of higher multipole moments as holics ( higher order lensing image s characteristics ) and establish an explicit relation between flexion and holics . in section 4 we present simulations of a weak lensing mass reconstruction using mock observational data of image ellipticities and holics .",
    "finally some discussions and comments are given in section 5 .",
    "in this section we briefly summarize general aspects of weak lensing and bacon et al.s flexion formalism . a general review of weak lensing can be found in bartelmann & schneider ( 2001 ) , and we follow the notations and conventions therein .      the gravitational deflection of light ray can be described by the lens equation , @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the effective lensing potential ; @xmath4 is defined via the 2d poisson equation as @xmath5 , with the lensing convergence @xmath6 .",
    "the convergence @xmath7 is the dimensionless surface mass density projected on the sky , which depends on the lens redshift @xmath8 and the source redshift @xmath9 as well as the background cosmology through the critical surface mass density@xmath10 where @xmath11 , @xmath12 , and @xmath13 are the angular - diameter distances from the observer to the deflector , from the observer to the source , and from the deflector to the source , respectively . if the angular size of an image is small enough to be able to neglect the change of the lensing potential @xmath3 , then we can linearize locally the lens equation ( [ eq : lenseq ] ) to have @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the jacobian matrix of the lens equation , @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the trace - free , symmetric shear matrix , @xmath18 being defined with the components of gravitational shear @xmath19 .      in the usual treatment of weak lensing analysis",
    ", we use quadrupole moments @xmath20 of the surface brightness distribution @xmath21 of background images for quantifying the shape of the images : @xmath22 \\delta \\theta_i \\delta \\theta_j } { \\int d^2\\theta\\,q_i[i(\\btheta)]}\\ ] ] where @xmath23 $ ] denotes the weight function used in the shape measurement , and @xmath24 is the offset vector from the image centroid . then we define the complex ellipticity @xmath25 as @xmath26 the complex ellipticity @xmath25 transforms under the lens mapping as @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the reduced shear and @xmath29 denotes complex conjugate . in the weak lensing limit , we neglect 2nd order terms of @xmath30 and @xmath25 , which yields @xmath31 . assuming the random orientation of the source images , we average observed ellipticities over a sufficient number of images to obtain @xmath32 the inversion equation from the shear map to the convergence map is obtained in fourier space as ( kaiser & squires 1993 ) @xmath33      we define the spin for weak lensing quantities .",
    "a quantity is said to have spin-@xmath34 if it has the same value after rotation by @xmath35 .",
    "then , the complex shear @xmath36 , the reduced shear @xmath30 , and the complex ellipticity @xmath25 are all spin-2 quantities",
    ". the product of spin-@xmath37 and spin-@xmath38 quantities has spin-@xmath39 , and the product of spin-@xmath37 and spin-@xmath40 has spin-@xmath41 .",
    "flexion is introduced to be the third - order lensing effect responsible for the weakly skewed and arc - like appearance of lensed galaxies .",
    "the third - order lensing effect arises from the fact that the shear and the convergence are not constant within a source galaxy image . by taking higher order derivatives of the lensing potential @xmath3",
    ", we can deal with higher order transformations of the shape quantities than the complex ellipticity .",
    "flexion consists of four components of the third - order lensing tensor @xmath42 ( see bacon , goldberg , rowe , taylor 2005 ) .",
    "the first flexion @xmath43 is defined as @xmath44 and the second flexion @xmath45 is defined as @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the complex gradient operator , which transforms under rotation as a vector , @xmath48 , where @xmath49 is the angle of rotation .",
    "thus @xmath43 has spin-@xmath50 and @xmath45 has spin-@xmath51 .",
    "the two complex flexion fields satisfy the following consistency relation : @xmath52    we then describe the transformation of the shape of a background source by expanding the lens equation ( [ eq : lenseq ] ) to the second order as @xmath53 the third - order lensing tensor @xmath54 can be expressed as the sum of the two terms , @xmath55 , with the spin-1 part @xmath56 and the spin-3 part @xmath57 : @xmath58 flexion has a dimension of length@xmath59 ( or angle@xmath59 ) .",
    "this means that the effect by flexion depends on the source size .",
    "the shape quantities affected by the first flexion @xmath43 alone have spin-@xmath50 properties , while those affected by the second flexion @xmath45 alone have spin-@xmath51 properties .    from equations ( [ eq : flexion1 ] ) and ( [ eq : flexion2 ] ) , the inversion equations from flexion to the convergence",
    "can be obtained as follows ( bacon et al .",
    "2006 ) : @xmath60 where the complex part @xmath61 describes the @xmath38-mode component that can be used to test the noise properties of weak lensing data .",
    "an explicit representation for the inversion equations is obtained in fourier space as follows : @xmath62 for @xmath63 .",
    "further we can combine independent mass reconstructions @xmath64 @xmath65 linearly in fourier space to improve the statistical significance of the @xmath6 map with minimum noise variance weighting : @xmath66 where @xmath67 with noise power spectrum @xmath68 of a @xmath6 map reconstructed using @xmath69th observable : @xmath70 with @xmath71 being the shot noise power of @xmath69th observable , @xmath72 being the intrinsic dispersion of @xmath69th observable , and @xmath73 being the surface number density of background galaxies . assuming that errors in @xmath74 between different observables are independent ,",
    "the noise power spectrum for the estimator ( [ eq : cmap ] ) is obtained as @xmath75",
    "in this section we consider higher multipole moments of images and define useful combinations of them as higher order lensing image s characteristics ( holics ) .",
    "we then derive a simple , explicit relation between flexion and holics .",
    "higher order moments of images are defined as a straightforward extension of the quadrupole moment .",
    "the octopole moment @xmath76 and the 16-pole moment @xmath77 are define as follows : @xmath78\\delta\\theta_i\\delta\\theta_j\\delta\\theta_k}{\\int\\ !   d^2\\theta\\,q_i[i(\\btheta)]},\\ ] ] @xmath79\\delta\\theta_i \\delta\\theta_j\\delta\\theta_k\\delta\\theta_l } { \\int\\ ! d^2\\theta\\,q_i[i(\\btheta)]}.\\ ] ] we first define the normalization factor @xmath80 as @xmath81 with spin-0 .",
    "then , we define the following combinations of octopole moments as our holics : @xmath82 where the first holics @xmath83 has spin-1 , and the second holics @xmath84 has spin-3 .",
    "note that holics have the dimension of [ length]@xmath59 ( or angle@xmath59 ) , the same as flexion does .",
    "now we are in a position to derive the transformation law of holics under gravitational lensing . for this purpose",
    "we first derive the relation between the source octopole moment @xmath85 and the image octopole moment @xmath76 .",
    "a straightforward calculation leads to @xmath86 where we have used the fact that the integration measures in the source and image planes are related in the following way ( see appendix a for detailed calculations ) : @xmath87 to the first order of _ reduced flexion _ defined as @xmath88 note that the flexion term from the determinant does not yield a net contribution to the denominators of equations ( [ eq : q3 ] ) and ( [ eq : q4 ] ) since the coordinate system is taken such that the first moment of @xmath21 vanishes : @xmath89 \\approx ( 1-\\kappa)^2 \\int\\ ! d^2\\theta q_i[i(\\btheta)],\\ ] ] where we have neglected the second order term in @xmath36 . from this transformation law",
    "one obtains the desired expressions as @xmath90 - 5re[f \\iota_{i}^*]-re[g \\iota_{{i\\hspace{-.3mm}i\\hspace{-.3mm}i}}^ * ] ) } , \\\\",
    "\\label{eq : deltas2delta } \\delta^{(s ) } & = &   \\frac{\\delta-3g\\zeta -\\frac{1}{4}(10f\\eta+7f^*\\lambda + 3 g ) } { ( 1-\\kappa)(1 - 4re[g^*\\lambda]-5re[f \\iota_{i}^*]-re[g \\iota_{{i\\hspace{-.3mm}i\\hspace{-.3mm}i}}^*])},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where dimensionless quantities @xmath91 and @xmath92 are defined with 16-pole moments by @xmath93 with spin-2 and spin-4 , respectively ; @xmath94 , @xmath95 and @xmath96 are defined with @xmath97-pole moments by @xmath98 with spin-1 , spin-3 , and spin-5 , respectively .",
    "assuming that the quantities @xmath99 and @xmath92 are small and neglecting higher - order terms containing @xmath97-pole moments which are reasonable assumptions on the weak lensing data , we can approximate the above equations as @xmath100 the formulae ( [ eq : holic2flex ] ) make it possible to relate directly the flexion fields and the holics measurements .",
    "since the @xmath83 and @xmath84 are quantities with non - zero spin , namely quantities with directional dependence , the expectation values of intrinsic @xmath83 and @xmath84 are assumed to vanish , @xmath101 neglecting the flexion term in the jacobian matrix ( [ eq : jacob ] ) will lead to a reduction of the response @xmath102 from @xmath103 to @xmath104 while it will keep the response @xmath105 unchanged , which was found earlier by irwin & shmakova 2006 . in this way , one can measure directly the flexion fields @xmath106 and @xmath107 from the observable holics .",
    "once we obtain the flexion fields , we can make use of equations ( [ eq : f2k ] ) and ( [ eq : g2k ] ) to invert them to the surface mass distribution .",
    "it is important to note the above relation ( [ eq : f2zeta ] ) is modified if we take into account the fact that the `` apparent '' center of an image defined by the first moment of the image is different from the `` actual '' center mapped by the lens equation from the center of the source .",
    "we discuss in detail this shift of the centroid in appendix b.",
    "in order to test the performance of mass reconstructions based on holics measurements , we generate simulated observations of the weak lensing effects , namely @xmath108 , that include observational errors as gaussian uncertainties .",
    "the flexion fields ( @xmath106 , @xmath109 ) ) can be used to reconstruct mass maps directly , independent of information on the shear field @xmath110 ( see  2.4 ) .",
    "the equation ( [ eq : holic2flex ] ) defines the direct , unbiased estimators for the flexion fields , where the precision of this measurement depends on the intrinsic values of holics convolved with the measurement noise . in the present simulation we do not take into account explicitly the centroid shift ( see appendix b ) but use directly equations ( [ eq : zetas2zeta ] ) and ( [ eq : deltas2delta ] ) to calculate the lensed holics from the intrinsic shape quantities and lens properties , which does not require the measurement and removal of the apparent centroid of an image .    to determine the widths of random gaussian distributions for the noise component of holics @xmath111 , arising from the intrinsic scatter in unlensed holics and observational noise",
    ", we refer to variances of holics obtained from our preliminary study of deep @xmath0-band data of @xmath112 @xmath113 blank fields observed with suprime - cam on the subaru telescope ( t. yamada , private communication ) .",
    "each @xmath114 data set consists of @xmath115 suprime - cam pointings with @xmath116 pixel@xmath59 .",
    "we used our weak lensing analysis pipeline based on imcat ( kaiser , squires , & broadhurst 1995 ) extended to include the higher multipole moments in the shape measurements .",
    "we selected a sample of @xmath117 background galaxies with @xmath118 mag in the blank fields , corresponding to a mean surface number density of @xmath119 .",
    "here we discarded stars and all objects for which reliable shape measurements can not be found . in particular , we excluded those small objects whose half - light radius @xmath120 is smaller than @xmath121 ( 2.5 pixels ) .",
    "we note the median value of stellar @xmath122 over the entire field is @xmath123 with a dispersion of @xmath124 using @xmath125 stars ( @xmath126 ) .",
    "this lower cut - off in the galaxy size is essential for us to be able to make reliable shape measurements because ( 1 ) the smaller the object , the noisier its shape measurement due to pixelization ( i.e. discretization ) noise , in particular for the case of higher - order shape moments , and ( 2 ) the shape of an image whose intrinsic size is smaller than or comparable to the size of psf can be highly distorted and smeared .",
    "for example , if the spatial distributions of both the source and the psf are described by a two - dimensional gaussian , with half - light radii of @xmath127 and @xmath128 , respectively , then the half - light radius of the psf - convolved image is @xmath129 . when both the sizes are equal , then @xmath130 , which is close to our choice for the lower cut - off in @xmath122 .",
    "we estimated the unlensed dispersions of holics to be @xmath131 and @xmath132 , where noisy outliers responsible for the non - gaussian tail were removed in the variance estimation .",
    "after clipping rejections the number of galaxies in this `` clean sample '' is about @xmath133 ( @xmath134 ) , and the median value of @xmath122 is @xmath135 . using the clean sample we also measured dispersions of dimensionless holics , @xmath136 and @xmath137 , with @xmath69 being the characteristic scale of the observed galaxy ( goldberg & bacon 2005 ; goldberg & leonard 2006 ) .",
    "we take @xmath69 to be the half - light diameter , @xmath138 , while goldberg & bacon ( 2005 ) and goldberg & leonard ( 2006 ) chose @xmath69 to be the semimajor axis for measuring the intrinsic flexion of galaxies .",
    "we found @xmath139 and @xmath140 with the median size of @xmath141 .",
    "we note that there is a good agreement between @xmath142 ( @xmath143 ) and @xmath144 ( @xmath145 ) , indicating that the measured dispersions are effectively weighted by moderately large galaxies with @xmath146 .",
    "the first holics @xmath83 , which is a spin-1 quantity , is sensitive to the determination of the centroid , or the first moment , with spin-1 .",
    "thus the error in the centroid determination affects seriously the estimation of the first holics @xmath83 , while this effect is of second order for other shape quantities with non spin-1 quantities .",
    "note that even though small objects were excluded from the analysis , no anisotropic / isotropic psf corrections were applied in measuring the holics for the present study , which implies that the dispersions of holics were underestimated to some degree due to the isotropic smearing effect by the atmosphere and the gaussian weighting in @xmath147 $ ] ( see fig .  2 of irwin et al .",
    "2006 ) .    in the present study",
    ", we simply adopt for illustration purposes random gaussian distributions with dispersions of @xmath148 in generating the intrinsic values of holics , corresponding to flexion dispersions of @xmath149 and @xmath150 .",
    "we note that bacon et al .",
    "( 2006 ) adopted @xmath151 in their simulation .",
    "for the intrinsic dispersion of ellipticities , we adopt @xmath152 . as a lens model",
    "we use a mock cluster located at @xmath153 , which is shown as the dimensionless surface mass density @xmath6 in the top - left panel of fig .  1",
    ". the cluster consists of a main halo and five sub - halos which are described by nfw density profiles with different masses and concentration parameters .",
    "the field is square - shaped with a side length of @xmath154 arcmin .",
    "we use @xmath155 sources ( @xmath156 ) randomly distributed over the field , with intrinsic shape quantities @xmath157 drawn from random gaussian distributions with dispersion @xmath158 , respectively .",
    "we assume the background sources are located at a single redshift of @xmath159 , which is a fair approximation for the lens located at a low redshift of @xmath153 .",
    "these observation parameters are appropriate for a future space - based survey such as the planned weak lensing survey with the snap satellite ( massay et al .",
    "2004 ) , except that the intrinsic flexion dispersions @xmath160 are derived from ground - based weak lensing data with galaxies of @xmath161 .",
    "hence the values of @xmath160 adopted in the present study will probably be very optimistic for space - based data with distant galaxies of @xmath162 ( see fig .  2 of massey et al .",
    "with @xmath163 being the gaussian dispersion . hence , @xmath164 for @xmath165 .",
    "] such small , distant galaxies will have intrinsic flexion dispersions greater by a factor of a few .",
    "finally , we use equations ( [ eq : chis2chi ] ) , ( [ eq : zetas2zeta ] ) , and ( [ eq : deltas2delta ] ) to generate lensed quantities @xmath108 for all sources .",
    "figure 1 shows reconstructed mass maps of the model cluster using @xmath108 along with the input mass model .",
    "we used the linear inversion equations ( [ eq : ks93 ] ) , ( [ eq : f2k ] ) , and ( [ eq : g2k ] ) .",
    "the reconstructed @xmath6-maps were smoothed with a gaussian filter , where the gaussian fwhms are taken to be @xmath166 for reconstructions using @xmath167 , respectively .",
    "then , the dispersions in the gaussian - smoothed @xmath38-mode maps are obtained as @xmath168 .",
    "the @xmath6 maps reconstructed using holics recover substructures better than large - scale structures , allowing a high - resolution mass reconstruction .",
    "the superior sensitivity of flexion to small scale structure comes from the @xmath169-dependence of the noise power spectrum in a @xmath6 reconstruction ( see equation [ [ eq : power ] ] ) .",
    "further , since we have assumed @xmath170 whereas @xmath83 has a three - times larger response to flexion than @xmath84 , the @xmath43-based reconstruction has a three - times better sensitivity than the @xmath171-based reconstruction .    in fig .",
    "2 we show the @xmath6 map obtained by combining shear- and flexion - based reconstructions using equation ( [ eq : cmap ] ) . on small angular scales",
    "the signal is dominated by flexion , while it is dominated by gravitational shear on large angular scales . since @xmath172 for all wavenumbers , the @xmath6 map is less weighted by the second flexion for the observation parameters adopted in this study ( i.e. , @xmath173 ) . the rms noise level in the @xmath6-map from flexion and shear data",
    "is reduced down to @xmath174",

    "one can employ the assumption of random orientation for intrinsic holics of background sources to obtain an unbiased , direct estimator for flexion , in a similar manner to the usual prescription for weak lensing .",
    "we have also shown by using simulated observations how the use of holics can improve the accuracy and resolution of a reconstructed mass map , in which we assumed gaussian uncertainties in the shape measurements estimated using deep @xmath0-band data of blank fields observed with subaru / suprime - cam .",
    "the gravitational shear and flexion have different scale - dependence in mass reconstruction errors . the mass maps reconstructed using holics recover substructures better than the shear - based reconstruction , allowing a high - resolution mass reconstruction .",
    "it is shown that an optimal linear combination of individual mass reconstructions can be formed using the statistical weight in fourier space , which can improve the statistical significance of weak lensing mass reconstructions . in actual observations , on the other hand",
    ", we must apply various shape corrections ( e.g. , isotropic / anisotropic psf corrections ) to the higher order shape quantities in order to measure flexion to high precision .",
    "in particular , the first holics @xmath83 with spin-1 is highly sensitive to the choice of the center - of - image .",

    "in a weak lensing analysis we quantify the shape of an image by measuring various moments of the surface brightness distribution @xmath21 , in which the moments are calculated with respect to the centroid of the image , or the center of light , defined by the first moments of @xmath21 : @xmath179 however , in general , this apparent center can be different from the `` point '' that is mapped using the lens equation from the center of unlensed light .",
    "we refer to this point as the `` true '' center of the image .",
    "the difference between these two centers , namely the apparent and the true centers , cause a significant effect in evaluating the first flexion as pointed out by goldberg & bacon ( 2005 ) .",
    "for the second flexion the effect of the centroid shift is second order so that we will ignore it in the present paper .",
    "let us define the center of the source in the absence of gravitational lensing as @xmath180 and the apparent center of the lensed image as @xmath181 .",
