    "mapping the history of early - type ( elliptical and lenticular ; e / s0 ) galaxies is essential for testing the modern picture of galaxy formation .",
    "first , early - type galaxies are believed to result from the mergers of later - type disk galaxies ( e.g. , white & rees 1978 ; davis et al .",
    "1985 ; kauffmann , white & guiderdoni 1993 ; cole et al .",
    "1994 ; kauffmann 1996 ) , and therefore provide a unique probe of hierarchical clustering in the cold dark matter ( cdm ) paradigm .",
    "second , the evolution of their stellar populations places constraints on the most recent epoch of star formation , and hence , when mergers may have occurred .",
    "semi - analytic cdm models ( e.g. , baugh , cole & frenk 1996 ; kauffmann 1996 ; kauffman & charlot 1998 ; diaferio et al .",
    "2001 ) have investigated the evolutionary history of early - type galaxies , and find significant environmental dependency .",
    "specifically , they indicate that e / s0s in high - density environments such as clusters should have significantly older stellar populations than field ellipticals , many of which should have formed in recent mergers .",
    "current surveys are now able to directly test these predictions by tracing the evolution of early - type galaxies in various environments out to @xmath8",
    ".    ellipticals in rich clusters have been the most extensively studied , with samples now approaching @xmath9 ( van dokkum & stanford 2003 ) .",
    "it is therefore not surprising that a broad consensus has been reached regarding their properties .",
    "the evolution in mass - to - light ratio inferred from the fundamental plane ( fp ) strongly indicates an early mean star formation epoch ( @xmath10 ) .",
    "for instance , the sample of van dokkum et al .",
    "( 1998 ) yields an evolution rate in the @xmath2 band of @xmath11 to @xmath12 , corresponding to a preferred formation redshift of @xmath13 .",
    "the subsample at @xmath9 is consistent with an extrapolation of this result .",
    "cluster galaxies are likely to experience significant morphological evolution , and the mergers in ms105403 ( van dokkum et al .  1999 , 2000 )",
    "appear to be direct evidence for the hierarchical clustering model .",
    "morphological evolution can lead to a `` progenitor bias '' , by which the early - type galaxy population will appear systematically younger than its true age ( kauffmann 1996 ; van dokkum & franx 2001 ) .",
    "however , applying the maximal progenitor bias only changes the evolution rate to @xmath14 ( @xmath15 ; van dokkum & franx 2001 ) . because these and other evolution results ( van dokkum & franx 1996 ; jorgensen , franx & kjaergaard 1996 ; jorgensen et al .",
    "1999 ; kelson et al .",
    "1997 , 2000 ; wuyts et al .",
    "2004 ) are strongly supported by color and spectral analyses ( bower , lucey & ellis 1992 ; ellis et al .",
    "1997 ; stanford , eisenhardt & dickinson 1998 ; ferreras , charlot & silk 1999 ) , there is little evidence to indicate that early - type galaxies in present - day clusters are anything but old , red and dead .    the history of early - type galaxies in low - density environments is less well understood , but progress is being made .",
    "many recent results based on analyses of the fundamental plane yield best - fit evolution rates of @xmath16 , and are mutually consistent within their quoted uncertainties . for example , treu et al .",
    "( 2001 , 2002 ) find @xmath17 , van dokkum et al .",
    "( 2001 ) and van dokkum & ellis ( 2003 ) find @xmath18 , and van der wel et al .",
    "( 2004 ) find @xmath19 , each based on luminosity - selected samples out to @xmath20 . in addition , rusin et al .",
    "( 2003 ; hereafter r03 ) analyze a mass - selected sample of gravitational lens galaxies over the same redshift range and extract a similar evolution rate of @xmath21 , a result that is largely confirmed by van de ven , van dokkum & franx ( 2003 ; hereafter vvf ) .",
    "the only significant outlier among fp studies is the gebhardt et al.(2003 ) measurement of @xmath22 to @xmath23 ( see also i m et al .",
    "2002 ) .    despite the broad consistency of the above evolution rates , there is some disagreement regarding the implied star formation history of early - type field galaxies .",
    "for example , treu et al .  ( 2001 , 2002 ) and gebhardt et al .  (",
    "2003 ) favor a mean star formation redshift of @xmath24 , which , combined with cluster results , would appear to confirm the cdm prediction of younger stellar populations in field e / s0s .",
    "the presence of young stars is supported by spectral ( schade et al .",
    "1999 ; kuntschner et al .  2002 ; treu et al .",
    "2002 ) , color ( menanteau , abraham & ellis 2001 ; vvf ) and evolutionary ( van der wel et al .",
    "2004 ) evidence for some recent star formation .",
    "in contrast , the remaining fp analyses claim a mean star formation redshift of @xmath25 , and little or no age difference between field and cluster populations .",
    "these results are supported by the spectral study of bernardi et al .",
    "( 1998 ) and the color analysis of bell et al .",
    "clearly more work is required to properly interpret current samples of early - type field galaxies , and account for the possibility that stars form over a range of redshifts .",
    "the focus of this paper is the gravitational lens sample .",
    "lenses are uniquely suited to exploring the luminosity evolution of the early - type galaxy population in low - density environments ( e.g. , keeton , kochanek & falco 1998 ; kochanek et al .",
    "2000 ; r03 ) .",
    "first , lenses are mass - selected galaxies , and are therefore less susceptible to malmquist biases which will favor the inclusion of brighter , bluer and younger galaxies in luminosity - selected samples .",
    "second , because the lensing cross section scales strongly with velocity dispersion , almost all lens galaxies are of early morphological types .",
    "third , the optical depth is dominated by galaxies in low - density environments , such as the `` field '' and poor groups ( keeton , christlein & zabludoff 2000 ) .",
    "fourth , lensing naturally selects a galaxy sample out to @xmath26 , due to the redshift spread in the source population and competing volume and cross section effects in the optical depth .",
    "fifth , lenses constrain projected masses , which can be used to normalize the galaxy population to a common scale .",
    "galaxy evolution results based on gravitational lens samples are often viewed with skepticism , as these investigations ( kochanek et al.2000 ; r03 ; vvf ) do not use measured velocity dispersions in their fp analyses .",
    "there is a legitimate reason for this : with a handful of exceptions ( foltz et al .",
    "1992 ; lehr et al .  1996",
    "; tonry 1998 ; ohyama et al .",
    "2002 ; koopmans & treu 2002 , 2003 ; koopmans et al.2003 ; gebhardt et al .  2003 ; treu & koopmans 2004 ) , the velocity dispersions of lens galaxies have not been measured .",
    "however , the geometry of the lensed images allows the velocity dispersion to be estimated very accurately , given a model for the mass distribution .",
    "an isothermal ( @xmath27 ) model is the common choice , as it is consistent with most constraints on lens galaxies ( kochanek 1995 ; cohn et al .",
    "2001 ; muoz , kochanek & keeton 2001 ; treu & koopmans 2002a ; rusin et al .",
    "2002 ; koopmans & treu 2003 ; winn , rusin & kochanek 2003 ; rusin , kochanek & keeton 2003 ; koopmans et al .  2003 ; treu & koopmans 2004 ) and local ellipticals ( fabbiano 1989 ; rix et al .  1997 ; gerhard et al .  2001",
    "; see romanowsky et al .",
    "2003 for an alternative conclusion ) . in the context of evolution studies , the issue is then whether the isothermal assumption is robust and sufficient .",
    "criticisms of r03 ( treu & koopmans 2002b ; gebhardt et al .",
    "2003 ) have centered on claims that velocity dispersion measurements of a few specific lens galaxies require mass profiles which are different than isothermal .",
    "the implication is that the results of r03 and similar papers can be discarded on the grounds that potential systematic and statistical deviations from the isothermal assumption may significantly affect evolution constraints , but have not been properly taken into account .",
    "we must therefore determine how constraints on the luminosity evolution model depend on galaxy structure , and the observationally permitted range of mass profiles .",
    "the primary goal of this paper is to develop and apply a framework for simultaneously investigating the structure and evolution of gravitational lens galaxies . in this way we can consider the range of mass profiles allowed by the ensemble of lens geometries , and its effect on stellar population constraints . in essence",
    ", we derive limits on luminosity evolution without any _ a priori _ assumption regarding the mean mass distribution in early - type galaxies .",
    "the theoretical framework is built upon the self - similar , two - component mass models introduced and analyzed by rusin , kochanek & keeton ( 2003 ; hereafter rkk ) .",
    "we show that the formalism is very closely related to the fundamental plane , and is therefore a powerful tool for tracing luminosity evolution .",
    "the results of our combined structure / evolution analysis bolster the previous claims of r03 that older stellar populations are strongly favored for field e / s0s .",
    "a secondary goal of this paper is to better quantify scatter within the lens galaxy sample , and among early - type field galaxies in general . unlike cluster ellipticals , which typically show little galaxy - to - galaxy age variance , field ellipticals exhibit significant scatter about their best - fit `` mean '' evolutionary tracks ( e.g. , treu et al .",
    "2001 , 2002 ; rkk ; vvf , treu & koopmans 2004 ; van der wel et al .",
    "2004 ) , strongly suggesting a range of stellar ages at @xmath28 .",
    "therefore , in addition to investigating single - epoch star formation models to describe the mean evolutionary history of early - type field galaxies , we also consider a simple model in which galaxies form over a range of redshifts .",
    "in doing so , we obtain the first stellar evolution model which reproduces the statistical properties of the lens sample .",
    "section 2 outlines the theoretical model for investigating galaxy structure and evolution .",
    "section 3 details our lens sample and calculations .",
    "section 4 describes our results .",
    "section 5 compares our findings with other lensing analyses . in  6 we summarize our results and discuss their implications .",
    "we assume @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 for all calculations .",
    "the geometry of a gravitational lens system yields a precise , model - independent relationship between the aperture radii defined by the lensed images and the projected masses they enclose ( schneider , ehlers & falco 1992 ) . for rings and four - image lenses ( quads ) ,",
    "the einstein radius @xmath32 is related to the aperture mass @xmath33 : @xmath34 note that modeling can remove the effects of galaxy ellipticity and external shear in quads and rings , leaving a negligible ( @xmath35 ) uncertainty on eq .",
    "( 1 ) . for two - image lenses ( doubles ) ,",
    "the image radii @xmath36 and @xmath37 are related to the enclosed masses @xmath38 and @xmath39 : @xmath40 \\left ( \\frac{1}{r_1 + r_2 } \\right ) =   \\sigma_{cr } \\ .\\ ] ] modeling can not robustly remove the effects of galaxy ellipticity and external shear in doubles . however , we can account for typical quadrupoles by assuming a @xmath41 uncertainty on eq .",
    "the quantity @xmath42 , defined in eq .",
    "( 1 ) , is the critical surface density , which depends on the angular diameter distance to the lens ( @xmath43 ) , to the source ( @xmath44 ) , and from the lens to the source ( @xmath45 ) .",
    "rkk demonstrate that an ensemble of aperture mass - radius ( amr ) relations can be used to statistically constrain the mean mass profile of lens galaxies , within the context of a model which relates the mass distribution to the light .",
    "once a given mass profile has been normalized to satisfy the aperture mass - radius relation in a particular lens , we can calculate the line - of - sight stellar velocity dispersion at radius @xmath46 by solving the jeans equation . for constant orbital anisotropy @xmath47 ,",
    "the solution is @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the surface brightness and @xmath50 is the corresponding volume distribution of the luminous matter .",
    "the luminosity - weighted velocity dispersion inside some ( circular ) spectroscopic aperture @xmath46 is then : @xmath51 note that galaxy ellipticity and external shear do not significantly affect the dynamical estimate ( kochanek 1994 ) .",
    "the mass normalization required by the amr relation makes the stellar velocity dispersion a very sensitive probe of the radial mass profile in lens galaxies ( e.g. , treu & koopmans 2002a ; koopmans & treu 2003 ) .",
    "our ability to estimate the velocity dispersion from the image geometry means that we can investigate the luminosity evolution of lenses using the fundamental plane ( fp ; djorgovski & davis 1987 ; dressler et al .",
    "1987 ) : @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the effective ( half - light ) radius , @xmath54 is the mean absolute surface brightness enclosed by @xmath53 , and @xmath55 is the central stellar velocity dispersion . is often defined within a standard aperture of 34 ( diameter ) at the distance of the coma cluster ( e.g. , jorgensen et al .",
    "1996 ) , or some fixed fraction of the effective radius ( typically @xmath56 ) . ] the fp allows us to predict the surface brightness that a galaxy would have at @xmath57 , given its velocity dispersion and effective radius . assuming that the structural parameters do not evolve ( the same assumption which has been made in all previous evolution analyses of the fp ; e.g. , jorgensen et al.1996 , 1999 ; kochanek et al .",
    "2000 ; treu et al .",
    "2001 , 2002 ; van dokkum et al .  1998 , 2001 ; r03 ; vvf ; gebhardt et al .",
    "2003 ) , the difference between the observed surface brightness and the predicted @xmath57 value is then directly related to the luminosity evolution : @xmath58 .",
    "this technique  estimating velocity dispersions from mass models normalized to match the amr relations and plugging the values into the fp  has been employed by previous studies to trace the luminosity evolution of lens galaxy samples ( kochanek et al .",
    "2000 ; r03 ; vvf ) .",
    "the drawback of these analyses is that they each focussed on the isothermal mass model , and did not thoroughly consider possible deviations or the range of permitted profiles .",
    "our goal is to investigate galaxy evolution without any _ a priori _ assumption regarding the shape of the mass distribution . of course",
    ", we can not independently set the profile of each lens galaxy .",
    "instead , we assume that early - type galaxies form a regular population , in which the mass distribution is related to the light distribution",
    ". we can then use the fp to simultaneously investigate galaxy structure and evolution . specifically , for a given mass profile , the central velocity dispersion can be calculated for each lens once the profile normalization has been set by the amr constraint .",
    "these velocity dispersions can then be compared with the predictions of the fp / evolution model : @xmath59- \\gamma_0}{\\alpha } \\ , \\ ] ] where @xmath60 is the present - day intercept , and @xmath61 is the evolution in mass - to - light ratio to the galaxy redshift @xmath62 .",
    "for now we assume that all galaxies are described by a single evolutionary track ; more general models will be considered later .",
    "the model may then be evaluated by finding the mass profile , evolution model and zero - point that minimize the scatter of the fp , which is known to be small at both high and low redshift , and in all environments ( e.g. , van dokkum & franx 1996 ; jorgensen et al .",
    "1996 ; kelson et al .  1997 ; van dokkum et al .  1998 , 2001 ;",
    "pahre , djorgovski , & de carvalho 1998a ; bernardi et al .",
    "2003 ) .",
    "the fp technique described above is very closely related to the homology formalism of rkk . for a homologous mass distribution , @xmath63 , where @xmath64 is a constant . substituting the definitions of the surface brightness ( @xmath65 , @xmath66 ) and implicitly evolving all luminosities to present - day",
    ", we have @xmath67 if we allow the mass - to - light ratio to scale as @xmath68 , then @xmath69 which looks like the fundamental plane ( eq .  5 ) , with @xmath70 and @xmath71 ( see also faber et al .",
    "1987 ) .",
    "the rkk homology formalism ( with luminosity evolution ) is identical to the real fp under three reasonable conditions .",
    "first , the fp slopes must be consistent with the definition of @xmath72 , which requires that @xmath73 .",
    "note that this condition is met by measurements of the local fp in the @xmath2 band , which favor slopes ( @xmath74 and @xmath75 ; jorgensen et al.1996 ; bender et al .",
    "1998 ) that are very close to those predicted for @xmath76 .",
    "second , we must fit the local intercept @xmath60 , which depends on a combination of @xmath64 and the stellar mass - to - light ratio .",
    "fitting for @xmath60 is a reasonable procedure , as local measurements of the fp intercept in low - density environments are scarce .",
    "third , the velocity dispersion must be measured / estimated in a spectroscopic aperture which is some fixed fraction of @xmath53 . such a definition",
    "is already used in many fp analyses ( e.g. , jorgensen et al .",
    "1996 , 1999 ; van dokkum et al .  1998 , 2001 ; bernardi et al.2003 ) .",
    "note that the size of the spectroscopic aperture relative to @xmath53 is irrelevant if the intercept is fit , as it changes only the dynamical constant @xmath64 , which has no effect on evolution rates unless the homology breaks down significantly or evolves with redshift .",
    "the value of @xmath77 used to estimate velocity dispersions is also irrelevant for our analysis , as it can be incorporated into @xmath64 .",
    "we make the assumption of constant @xmath77 for computational simplicity .",
    "however , the anisotropy is equally irrelevant for an osipkov - merritt ( osipkov 1979 ; merritt 1985a , b ) parameterization [ @xmath78 , so long as we assume that the isotropy radius @xmath79 is proportional to the effective radius .",
    "consequently , the fp and homology frameworks are interchangeable , with the amr relations derived from image geometries acting as a suitable proxy for velocity dispersions . by incorporating stellar evolution explicitly into the homologous models for galaxy mass distributions",
    ", we can harness the power of the fp to simultaneously constrain the structure and luminosity evolution of early - type lens galaxies .",
    "the combined analysis allows us to obtain limits on luminosity evolution that are relatively unbiased with respect to the choice of mass model",
    ". a certain range of mass profiles will be consistent with a tight fundamental plane , and this range dictates the degree to which a strong homology might be violated in this galaxy population .",
    "the effect of this range on the evolution estimates can then be taken into account .",
    "we begin with a two - component model relating the mass and light in galaxies .",
    "the model is parameterized in terms of projected quantities , as these are directly constrained by gravitational lenses . however , volume mass distributions are necessary for evaluating the jeans equation ( eq .  3 ) .",
    "we therefore employ three - dimensional analogs of the models used by rkk .",
    "the mass component which traces the stars is modeled as a hernquist ( 1990 ) profile , with volume density @xmath80 where @xmath81 is the characteristic radius . in projection ,",
    "the hernquist model closely approximates a de vaucouleurs surface brightness profile for @xmath82 .",
    "the fraction of the total luminosity projected inside @xmath46 is denoted @xmath83 .",
    "allowing the mass - to - light ratio of the stars to vary with galaxy luminosity ( @xmath84 ) , the projected luminous matter inside an aperture @xmath46 is then @xmath85 where quantities are scaled relative to those of an @xmath86 galaxy , which we define as having a present - day ( @xmath57 ) characteristic magnitude of @xmath87 in the rest frame @xmath2 band ( e.g. , madgwick et al .",
    "the quantity @xmath88 is the galaxy luminosity corrected for stellar evolution , which allows all lenses to be evaluated at a common age .",
    "( see  2.3 ) .",
    "the dark matter halo is modeled using the cuspy profile of muoz et al .",

    "the profile follows the generalized form of a simulated cdm halo ( navarro , frenk & white 1997 ; moore et al .",
    "1999 ) , which has a logarithmic density slope @xmath91 for @xmath92 and @xmath93 for @xmath94 .",
    "in most cases we will consider the `` power - law '' limit with @xmath95 .",

    "there is strong evidence that the total mass - to - light ratio increases with luminosity ( e.g. , gerhard et al .",

    "gerhard et al .   ( 2001 ) argue that we are seeing a luminosity dependence of the stellar mass - to - light ratio .",
    "in contrast , padmanabhan et al .",
    "( 2004 ) claim that the effect is due to an increasing dark matter abundance with galaxy luminosity , while the stellar populations exhibit negligible variation ( see also kauffmann et al .",
    "2003 ) . we have tested a non - homologous mass distribution , in which the dark matter abundance @xmath98 varies with galaxy luminosity as @xmath102 where @xmath103 .",
    "unfortunately , the tests show that our lensing analysis has no power to distinguish even the extreme cases of @xmath104 ( structurally homologous ) and @xmath105 ( systematically non - homologous ) , as we can measure only a combination of parameters @xmath106 .",
    "specifically , we obtain a virtually identical value for @xmath72 if @xmath104 as we do for @xmath107 if @xmath105 , with no difference in the goodness of fit or the favored evolution model .",
    "this result is primarily due to the fact that lenses measure total masses only .",
    "consequently , homologous mass distributions contain all the phenomenology we can probe : namely , the concentration of the mass distribution and the dependence of the total mass - to - light ratio on luminosity ( rather than the individual behavior of either mass component ) .",
    "the evolution estimates are the same under either structural assumption .",
    "strict homology is also relaxed if galaxies exhibit structural scatter at fixed luminosity .",
    "this could be tested by modeling the galaxy population with a statistical distribution of mass profiles , much as we will do for star formation redshifts ( see  2.3 ) . in practice , however , this is difficult to accomplish within the context of our global mass model .",
    "for a given galaxy , different mass profiles require different stellar mass - to - light ratios , which renders impossible a parameterization of the galaxy population in terms of a single value of @xmath108 .",
    "we choose to forgo the direct modeling of profile scatter , as we do not wish to add more nuisance parameters to cloud the analysis .",
    "moreover , in  4.2 we show that structural scatter is not necessary to produce a good statistical description of the data .",
    "hence , a single profile model satisfies occam s razor . by ignoring structural scatter",
    ", we will maximize the range of formation redshifts necessary to account for the scatter observed about the amr relations .",
    "we account for evolutionary effects by converting each observed galaxy luminosity @xmath109 to a common stellar age , yielding an evolution - adjusted luminosity @xmath88 .",
    "this may be accomplished in two ways , depending on the complexity of the star formation model .    to derive constraints on the mean star formation redshift and evolution rate , we assume that the galaxies are described by a single star formation redshift ( model 1 ) .",
    "for such a model we can normalize the galaxy luminosities at any redshift we desire , and simplicity dictates that we evolve them to @xmath57 : @xmath110 where @xmath61 is the change in mass - to - light ratio out to redshift @xmath62 .",

    "this is a useful approximation for older stellar populations , and offers a standard for comparing results from different analyses .",
    "second , @xmath61 can be set according to the detailed evolutionary tracks of stellar population models , which we calculate using the gissel96 version of the bruzual & charlot ( 1993 ) synthesis code ( hereafter denoted `` bc96 '' ) .",
    "this technique facilitates constraints on the mean star formation redshift .",
    "a @xmath112 statistic is sufficient to evaluate model 1 .",
    "modeling the early - type galaxy population with a single formation redshift or evolution rate rarely provides a good statistical description of the data ( e.g. , vvf ; van der wel et al .",
    "therefore , we also investigate a model in which star formation takes place over a range of redshifts ( model 2 ) .",
    "this is the first time that such a model has been applied to a gravitational lens sample . as in model 1",
    ", galaxies are formed obeying the self - similarity relation ( eq .",
    "12 ) , though in this case they will exhibit a range of ages at any given redshift .",

    "post - rescaling , the initial value of @xmath135 is of little importance .",
    "the rescaling procedure yields constraints similar to those derived from a jackknife error analysis or bootstrap resampling ( each without error rescaling ) , as all three techniques are designed to provide error bars which are consistent with the observed scatter . for simplicity we will quote only the @xmath134 results . in model 2",
    "we seek a good fit to the data in the absolute sense ( see  3.2 ) , so error rescaling will not be used . while our parameter constraints do vary with @xmath136 , our ability to derive a statistically consistent model does not .",

    "more important than the assumed value of @xmath136 is that we apply it uniformly to all lenses .",

    "while this looks like a very different formalism , it is not . analyzing estimated velocity dispersions with the fp ( eq .  18 ) yields numerically identical results to analyzing amr relations with the homology model ( eq .  17 ) . only if the local intercept @xmath60 is known to high systematic and statistical accuracy ( @xmath155 ) does using the fp formalism add any information .",
    "however , to make use of the local zero - point , one must also know the slopes of the fp and the orbital anisotropy .",
    "in addition , the velocity dispersion must be estimated in a spectroscopic aperture identical to the one used to derive the local fp parameters .",

    "this preserves the relative weighting among the data points , which naturally gives less weight to doubles and those systems with an estimated @xmath150 , and therefore does not alter the optimized values of the model parameters .",
    "however , rescaling does allow us to relate the uncertainties to the observed scatter in the model , yielding parameter errors which agree with those derived from the bootstrap and jackknife techniques ( see  3.1 ) .",
    "rescaling is particularly important because model 1 is undoubtedly a simplistic representation of galaxy structure and evolution .",
    "hence , the @xmath112 is likely to be dominated by unmodeled complexity ( i.e. , deviations from self - similarity and an intrinsic spread in star formation redshifts ) in the galaxy population , rather than by observational errors .",

    "we have confirmed that the techniques yield identical parameter constraints in this case , so long as we keep @xmath166 .",
    "in addition to finding the best - fit model , we also want to determine whether it is a good fit to the lens data in the absolute sense . for model 1",
    ", we simply compare the best - fit @xmath112 ( for @xmath167 ) to the number of degrees of freedom .",
    "model 2 , however , requires a more intricate , monte carlo - based approach in which we select and analyze simulated lens samples , which are based on the geometries of our actual lenses .",
    "first , we randomly select the formation redshift for each galaxy according to the statistical distribution @xmath168 , and set the formation luminosity such that the homologous mass model perfectly reproduces the amr relation .",
    "the luminosity is then evolved to the measured galaxy redshift , and perturbed according to the assumed luminosity errors .",
    "uncertainty in the mass scale due to an estimated source redshift is handled by an additional perturbation .",

    "is an important component of these models , though the mean star formation redshift is still relatively high .",
    "the best - fit models meet the necessary condition for statistical consistency with the lens sample , based on the interpretation of likelihoods . as noted in  3.1 , altering the assumed luminosity errors does not change this conclusion .",
    "the luminosity evolution of gravitational lens galaxies has recently been explored by van de ven et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , who use the fp to derive an evolution rate of @xmath271 from a sample of 26 lenses .",
    "this is slightly faster than the findings of either r03 ( @xmath272 ) or this paper ( @xmath273 for model 1 ) , even though the lens samples and photometry are nearly the same .",
    "furthermore , vvf claim that rather late mean star formation redshifts are permitted ( @xmath274 , 68% c.l . ) , while much of this range is excluded by r03 ( @xmath275 , 95% c.l . ) and the combined structure / evolution analysis of  4.2.1 ( @xmath3 , 95% c.l . ) . while the results of rkk and vvf are technically consistent , it is instructive to discuss three factors which account for the small differences : data weighting , stellar evolution models , and sample selection .",
    "first , differences in data weighting account for most of the systematic disparity in evolution rates .",
    "we set a fixed uncertainty for all galaxy luminosities , ensuring that each lens has a similar relative contribution to the fit .",
    "are weighted down relative to those with measured @xmath150 ( see  3.1 ) . ] in contrast , vvf use uncertainties which they derive from their photometric conversion . based on their quoted errors on the surface brightness , some galaxies are far more important to the fit than other galaxies .",
    "data weighting has a surprisingly large impact on the derived evolution rate .",
    "vvf already demonstrate this by testing an error term ( to account for scatter ) which is added in quadrature with other errors .",
    "this has the effect of weighting the galaxies more uniformly , and slows the evolution rate from @xmath276 to @xmath277 .",
    "we have confirmed these results by reanalyzing the data tabulated in vvf .",
    "furthermore , we find that the vvf data yield an even slower evolution rate of @xmath278 ( very similar to our value ) if we impose uniform weighting .",
    "the choice of weighting is clearly important for constraining the evolution model , and the vvf method is not unreasonable .",
    "however , we believe that our scheme provides a more realistic description of the global properties of the lens galaxy population , since uncertainties in model 1 are certain to be dominated by intrinsic scatter in the mass profile and formation redshift , rather than by measurement errors .",
    "galaxies should not be segregated based on nominal photometric errors if those errors are much too small to account for the observed scatter in the fp .",
    "moreover , weighting galaxies by their photometric errors can introduce a malmquist bias , which we may be seeing in the vvf analysis .",
    "relatively brighter galaxies are expected to have better photometry , giving them greater statistical weight .",
    "since brighter galaxies at high redshift will also imply a greater degree of luminosity evolution , the mean evolution rate will tend to be biased toward faster values .",
    "nearby lens galaxies , which are bright but have little ability to distinguish between star formation models , would also be more strongly weighted than the distant galaxies which are vital for determining stellar age through luminosity evolution .",
    "second , the constraints on stellar age are affected by models of the evolution tracks @xmath61 as a function of star formation redshift .",
    "we use the tracks derived from the bc96 stellar synthesis code .",
    "in contrast , vvf use an approximation to the worthey ( 1994 ) simulation results : @xmath279 , where @xmath280 is the stellar age and @xmath281 .",
    "the models agree very well for @xmath282 , but the bc96 model evolves more rapidly than the vvf fitting function for @xmath283 . as a result ,",
    "later star formation redshifts are more strongly disfavored with the bc96 model , which tightens our lower bound on @xmath284 .",
    "we tested this hypothesis by reanalyzing the vvf data ( with their quoted uncertainties ) .",
    "for example , while vvf find that their @xmath285 track is marginally consistent with their data , the corresponding bc96 track is unambiguously rejected at @xmath286 .",
    "we believe that the bc96 model facilitates more accurate constraints on the mean star formation redshift , as it offers a more detailed treatment of young stellar populations than the vvf approximation .",
    "third , differences in sample selection have a small systematic effect on the evolution results .",
    "systems without measured source redshifts are rejected by vvf , but are included in our analysis ( with an estimate of @xmath287 ) .",
    "two of these systems  mg1131 + 0456 ( hewitt et al .  1988 ) and b1938 + 666 ( patnaik et al .  1992 )  are particularly interesting .",
    "each is at high redshift ( @xmath288 and @xmath289 , respectively ) and exhibits a larger than average mass - to - light ratio ( especially mg1131 + 0456 ) .",
    "hence , they force the model to slightly slower evolution rates .",
    "while excluding such systems alters constraints on the mean star formation redshift at the level of only @xmath290 ( see  4.2 ) , there is no reason that these lenses should be rejected just because they are outliers . in all other respects ,",
    "they look like typical elliptical galaxies ( tonry & kochanek 2000 ) .",
    "one may argue , however , that our choice for the estimated source redshift biases the result .",
    "we note that the implied mass - to - light ratios of these galaxies can be reduced if the sources are at a much higher redshift ( @xmath291 ) .",
    "based on the optical properties of the sources , this is indeed a reasonable scenario .",
    "however , we find that these systems have an equally important role in the fit even if we substitute `` measured '' values of @xmath292 for our estimated values of @xmath293  while the absolute deviation from the global model is reduced , this is almost completely compensated by the reduced fit tolerance for systems with a measured @xmath150 .",
    "therefore , the inclusion of these systems in our analysis is strongly justified , and their effects on the fit are real .",
    "finally , it is interesting to note that r03 and vvf have no systematic differences in rest frame magnitudes , despite using alternate techniques for photometric conversion .",
    "however , vvf appear to have more scatter in their data points , and we trace this to the photometry .",
    "larger scatter slightly broadens the vvf confidence regions compared to our own , and therefore leads to a somewhat weaker rejection of late formation redshifts .",
    "several studies have focussed on the structure and evolution of individual lens galaxies ( treu et al .",
    "2002a , b ; koopmans & treu 2003 ; koopmans et al .  2003 ; gebhardt et al .  2003 ; treu & koopmans 2004 ) .",
    "while these analyses have the benefit of using measured velocity dispersions in the fundamental plane relation , there are also two significant drawbacks .",
    "first , to determine the evolution implied by a single galaxy or a small number of galaxies , one must make an explicit comparison against a local fp intercept measured from other samples .",
    "this often means using the intercept for ellipticals in the coma cluster to evaluate the evolution of field galaxies , even though these populations should not , in general , have identical intercepts at @xmath57 .",
    "second , such studies may be susceptible to a malmquist bias , which presumably makes it easier to measure velocity dispersions in more luminous , higher surface brightness galaxies with younger stellar populations . in this case",
    ", a sample of lenses with measured velocity dispersions , especially at higher redshift , would be biased toward faster evolution rates .",
    "such effects may already be evident in the current dynamical sample .    the lens structure and dynamics survey ( lsd ; koopmans & treu 2002 , 2003 ; treu & koopmans 2002a ; koopmans et al .",
    "2003 ; treu & koopmans 2004 ) has measured the velocity dispersions of several gravitational lenses , which are combined with hst photometry to constrain structure and evolution .",
    "five of these lenses appear in our sample : mg2016 + 112 ( lawrence et al .  1984 ) , 0047281 ( warren et al .  1996 ) , b1608 + 656 ( myers et al .",
    "1995 ) , hst14176 + 5226 ( ratnatunga et al .",
    "1995 ) , and pg1115 + 080 ( weymann et al .  1980 ) . as we discussed in  4.1 ,",
    "our statistical constraints on the galaxy mass profile are largely consistent with those derived through dynamical measurements and modeling .",
    "note , however , that treu & koopmans ( 2004 ) now favor a mean logarithmic slope which is significantly shallower and marginally inconsistent with isothermal , based on a combined analysis of six lens galaxies .",
    "two of these galaxies do not currently appear in our sample , and help weight the lsd analysis toward shallower profiles .",
    "the lsd sample also favors faster evolution rates and younger stellar populations than our results indicate .",
    "this may be due in part to a luminosity - related selection bias , or at least small number statistics .",
    "for example , our evolution results for mg2016 + 112 and 0047281 , based on a fixed local fp intercept , agree well with those measured in the lsd survey  but each lens scatters on the `` young '' side of our evolutionary trend - lines .",
    "moreover , the lsd survey has observed b1608 + 656 , whose spectral properties suggest that the galaxy has undergone significant star formation triggered by an ongoing merger ( koopmans et al .  2003 ) . using dust corrections based on observed color gradients",
    ", they derive a luminosity which is much larger than that of passively - evolving galaxies , and a luminosity evolution which is much faster than our estimate for the overall sample . based on an analysis of their lens sample , treu & koopmans ( 2004 )",
    "find an evolution rate of @xmath294 , which is systematically faster but still broadly consistent with the evolution rate we derive by optimizing over the mass profile .",
    "departures from homology can also have interesting effects on the derived evolution rates .",
    "if we compare the implied fp intercept with a fixed local value , then a larger velocity dispersion yields a slower evolution rate , and vice versa .",
    "pg1115 + 080 , whose measured velocity dispersion is much higher than the isothermal prediction ( tonry 1998 ; treu & koopmans 2002b ) , must undergo virtually no luminosity evolution to @xmath295 if it is to fall on the local fp . alternatively ,",
    "if the galaxy evolves at a standard evolution rate , its structure can not be consistent with the rest of the early - type galaxy population .",
    "hst14176 + 5226 , in contrast , yields a significantly faster evolution rate if the isothermal velocity dispersion estimate is replaced with one of its measured values . unless the quoted error bars on the velocity dispersions have been underestimated , the findings of gebhardt et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , treu & koopmans ( 2004 ) and others suggest that early - type galaxies exhibit significant structural diversity .",
    "such deviations from homology warn against using small numbers of lenses to constrain an evolution model meant to describe the galaxy population as a whole .",
    "evolution studies of early - type galaxies based on gravitational lens samples ( kochanek et al .  2000 ; r03 ; vvf ) have often been criticized for using estimated , rather than measured , velocity dispersions , because a mass model is required to convert the accurately measured projected mass into a dynamical estimate .",
    "the primary concern has been that the preferred mass model for lenses , an isothermal model with a flat rotation curve , could be incorrect .",
    "the secondary concern is that early - type galaxies may not be well characterized by any single mass distribution that is homologous to the luminosity distribution . by simultaneously modeling both the structure and evolution of lens galaxies",
    ", our present analysis helps address these concerns . specifically , we determine the best - fit mass profile for lens galaxies ( as well as the range over which individual lenses might scatter ) , and account for these effects on the mean evolution model .",
    "our technique builds on the homologous two - component mass models of rkk , which were constrained using the ensemble of aperture mass - radius relations derived from lensed image geometries .",
    "the homology formalism is virtually identical to the fundamental plane , with the amr relations substituting for measured velocity dispersions .",
    "in essence , this allows us to trace luminosity evolution with the fp , while directly using the quantity ( aperture mass ) that strong lensing naturally constrains .",
    "we first updated constraints on the structure of early - type galaxies , assuming that lenses are characterized by a single star formation redshift .",
    "we find that uncertainty in the evolution model has little effect on our structural results .",
    "the fp strongly favors nearly isothermal ( @xmath296 ) mass profiles on scales of a few effective radii , with a mean density slope of @xmath0 ( 68% c.l . ) .",
    "these statistical constraints are consistent with the isothermal paradigm favored by modeling ( kochanek 1995 ; cohn et al .",
    "2001 ; muoz et al.2001 ; rusin et al .  2002 ; winn et al .",
    "2003 ) and dynamical ( treu & koopmans 2002a , 2002b ; koopmans & treu 2003 ; koopmans et al .",
    "2003 ) studies of individual lens galaxies , the dynamics of local ellipticals ( e.g. , rix et al .  1997 ; romanowsky & kochanek 2001 ; gerhard et al.2001 ) , and their x - ray halos ( e.g. , fabbiano 1989 ; matsushita et al.1998 ; loewenstein & white 1999 ) . note , however , that treu & koopmans ( 2004 ) favor models with systematically shallower profiles , while romanowsky et al .  ( 2003 )",
    "favor significantly more concentrated models .",
    "our analysis indicates that a small but non - zero fraction ( @xmath209 , 95% c.l . ) of the mass projected inside two effective radii must be in the form of an extended dark matter halo , independent of any assumed stellar mass - to - light ratio .",
    "we also constrain the increase in the total mass - to - light ratio with galaxy luminosity ( @xmath297 ) : @xmath234 for the linear evolution model , and @xmath298 for the detailed bc96 evolution tracks ( both 68% c.l . ) .",
    "these results are consistent with recent dynamical analyses of early - type galaxies ( gerhard et al .",
    "2001 ; bernardi et al .",
    "2003 ; borriello et al .  2003",
    "; padmanabhan et al .",
    "because the fp is closely related to the homology formalism , our constraint on @xmath72 can be considered the first constraint on the slopes of the lensing fundamental plane : @xmath299 and @xmath300 .",
    "these constraints are not yet very restrictive , but they are consistent with measurements of the local fp ( e.g. , jorgensen et al .  1996 ; pahre et al .  1998a ; bernardi et al .",
    "2003 ) .",
    "next we considered the luminosity evolution of lens galaxies , and find a small effect from the uncertainties in the mass model .",
    "we began by investigating a model in which all galaxies form at a common redshift ( model 1 ) .",
    "the same assumption has been made in almost every analysis of early - type galaxies , and therefore provides a basis for comparing results .",
    "the lens sample favors a linear evolution rate of @xmath301 ( 68% c.l . ) .",
    "this constraint includes the spread in structural properties that are consistent with the amr relations , and is therefore weaker than the value derived by r03 based on isothermal profiles , @xmath21 ( 68% c.l . ) . assuming the standard cosmological parameters and a salpeter imf , we require a mean star formation redshift of @xmath302 at 68% confidence , and @xmath3 at 95% confidence , based on the bc96 spectral population models .",
    "these constraints are remarkable , considering that we make no assumption regarding the shape of the galaxy mass distribution or the slopes of the fundamental plane .",
    "our only assumption is that these galaxies are structurally homologous , but even this is not restrictive : we obtain identical conclusions if the increase in mass - to - light ratio with luminosity is modeled as a systematic non - homology .",
    "we favor slightly older stellar populations in lens galaxies than van de ven et al.(2003 ) , who suggest that lenses could be consistent with mean star formation redshifts as late as @xmath303 .",
    "we have traced these differences to data weighting , evolution models and sample selection . in conclusion",
    ", our single-@xmath114 analysis again indicates that , on average , early - type galaxies in low - density environments have old stellar populations  perhaps as old as their counterparts in rich clusters .",
    "model 1 does not provide a good fit to the data given the estimated statistical uncertainties , much as the scatter in the standard fp also exceeds measurement errors .",
    "this suggests that additional sources of complexity have not been properly taken into account . in particular",
    ", we can be confident that galaxies are neither perfectly homologous nor form at a common redshift .",
    "the scatter about our best fitting solution corresponds to a spread of approximately 3035% in some combination of mass ( deviations from homology ) and luminosity ( range of star formation epochs ) . for our overall constraints on the mean structure and the mean star formation redshift",
    ", we included these additional uncertainties in our error estimates .",
    "we explored one source of this scatter using the seven lens systems in our sample with direct velocity dispersion measurements . for each system",
    "we can estimate the parameters of the mass model needed to reconcile the velocity dispersion with the aperture mass constraint .",
    "in general , all seven are consistent with our statistical results , given their mutual errors .",
    "this is just a rephrasing of the fact that our error estimates in model 1 have correctly included the scatter created by deviations from homology or a spread in formation epochs .",
    "four of the seven lenses have parameters and parameter degeneracies similar to our statistical models . pg1115 + 080 requires a steeper mass distribution , while hst14176 + 5226 requires a shallower mass distribution .",
    "however , systematic errors in measuring and modeling stellar velocity dispersions might significantly mitigate these discrepancies . q2237 + 0305 , the bulge of a nearby spiral galaxy ( huchra et al .  1985 ) , should probably be described by a more complex mass model , but an isothermal profile can still describe its inner dynamics .",
    "we also investigated a model which can directly account for the observed scatter in the homology relation by allowing a range of star formation redshifts .",
    "specifically , we assumed that stars form between @xmath115 and @xmath116 , with uniform probability density in @xmath304 , and that the galaxies are structurally homologous at formation . by ignoring any intrinsic distribution of mass profiles",
    ", we expect to maximize the range of formation redshifts necessary to reproduce the observed scatter . applying a likelihood analysis to the lenses , we find that a significant spread in formation redshift is favored : ( @xmath253 at 95% confidence , and @xmath254 at 68% confidence ) , while the single-@xmath114 model is ruled out",
    ". moreover , simulated data sets created from a subset of the acceptable models yield likelihoods similar to that of the real data . allowing a range of formation redshifts",
    "therefore provides a vastly improved statistical description of the lens sample .",
    "the required scatter in @xmath114 increases almost linearly with the mean star formation redshift .",
    "this can be understood by noting that luminosity evolution depends much more sensitively on @xmath114 when @xmath114 is small .",
    "we find that the distribution of star formation redshifts can vary significantly among acceptable models of the lens sample .",
    "for example , the most favored models ( @xmath258 ) allow anywhere from @xmath259 to @xmath260 of galaxies to form at @xmath261 ( fig .  6 ) .",
    "we therefore conclude that the stars in early - type field galaxies form over a substantial range of redshifts , and that some fraction of these stars may have formed as recently as @xmath305 .",
    "our analysis bolsters the findings of treu et al .",
    "( 2001 , 2002 ) , van de ven et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , koopmans et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , and van der wel et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , who argue that late star formation in some fraction of field ellipticals is essential for explaining their evolutionary history . however , we depart from a few recent claims ( treu et al.2001 , 2002 ; gebhardt et al .",
    "2003 ) that the mean star formation redshift of field ellipticals may be as late as @xmath306 . in all of our statistically acceptable models ,",
    "the mean star formation redshift is relatively high ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "understanding the star formation history of early - type field galaxies remains a work in progress",
    ". there is , however , growing consistency among results based on colors ( menanteau et al .",
    "2001 ; vvf ; bell et al .",

    ", these analyses present a strong case that field ellipticals formed the bulk of their stars between @xmath243 and @xmath307 , and are therefore not much younger than their counterparts in high - density environments .",
    "this largely disagrees with the predictions of semi - analytic cdm models ( e.g. , baugh et al .",
    "1996 ; kauffmann 1996 ; kauffman & charlot 1998 ; diaferio et al.2001 ) .",
    "moreover , based on the internal scatter of the various samples , it appears that the stars in field ellipticals are likely to have formed over a range of redshifts , with some fraction of the stars forming as late as @xmath6 .",
    "the degree to which these galaxies experience late star formation is a subject of continuing debate , and several of the above results disagree on the details .    what is the source of these remaining discrepancies among analyses of early - type field galaxies ?",
    "sample selection is probably the best starting hypothesis .",
    "each of the above evolution studies employs different criteria for selecting early - type galaxies . for example , treu et al .",
    "( 2001 , 2002 ) use morphological / magnitude / color cuts , van dokkum & ellis ( 2003 ) use morphological / magnitude cuts , and gebhardt et al .",
    "( 2003 ) use the bulge fraction . the lens sample , by contrast ,",
    "is selected on mass , with large velocity dispersion ellipticals dominating the lensing optical depth .",
    "the mass selection makes the gravitational lens sample unique , as it is the only one not to be affected by malmquist biases related to luminosity , color , or other star formation signatures .",
    "however , lensing also selects more massive samples of ellipticals . assuming an isothermal profile , the 22 lenses we analyzed have a mean velocity dispersion of @xmath119 , about @xmath308 higher than any of the other samples listed above .",
    "the mean velocity dispersion of lens galaxies also increases with redshift , due to angular selection effects ( r03 ) . because there is evidence to indicate that more massive early - type galaxies may be older ( van der wel et al .",
    "2004 ) , the higher mean velocity dispersion of the lens sample could partially account for its slower evolution rate .",
    "additional work is clearly necessary to quantify the benefits and biases of the various samples .",
    "whatever the remaining uncertainties , the lens galaxies are an extraordinarily powerful probe of galactic structure and evolution . using only 22 lenses , we can simultaneously constrain the mean mass profile of early - type galaxies , the dependence of the mass - to - light ratio on luminosity , and the rate of stellar evolution , with statistical and systematic uncertainties that are competitive with all other methods .",
    "the power of gravitational lenses is a result of the aperture mass - radius relations derived from the image geometries , but good photometry and measured redshifts are needed to make use of these constraints .",
    "follow - up imaging and spectroscopy is therefore vital to expanding the current lens sample , which may soon enable significantly improved statistical analyses .",
    "such future studies could investigate lenses as a function of color , velocity dispersion , environment or spectral properties .",
    "in addition , a sufficiently large sample of lenses could probe not only luminosity evolution , but structural evolution as well ( e.g. , mao & kochanek 1994 ; rix et al .",
    "1994 ; ofek , rix & maoz 2003 ) , thereby tracing the merger history in low - density environments .",
    "detailed dynamical studies of individual lenses , such as those being carried out by the lsd survey , are also vital , as they can directly map the diversity of the lens galaxy population .",
    "similar physical constraints can be obtained using time delay measurements in gravitational lenses , if we can safely assume that the hubble constant is accurately measured . with a known hubble constant",
    ", time delays measure the surface mass density near the lensed images ( kochanek 2002 ) , which would break the model degeneracies for individual lenses in the same manner as a velocity dispersion measurement .",
    "models for the time variability created by the microlensing of lensed images can also help break the degeneracy because the light curves can be used to determine the fraction of the surface mass density in the form of stars ( kochanek 2004 ; see also schechter & wambsganss 2002 for a discussion of statistical constraints based on flux ratio anomalies ) .",
