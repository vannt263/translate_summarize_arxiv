    "with recent technological advances it has become possible to detect extra - solar planets via their gravitational influence on their host stars .",

    "while uncovering the existence of planetary systems , such techniques do not probe directly the physical properties of the planets .",
    "rather , the conditions of the planet are inferred from the orbital parameters . however",
    ", monitoring the change in stellar brightness as a planet transits a star reveals the planetary radius , an observation successfully undertaken on hd  209458 ( charbonneau et al .",
    "2000 ; henry , marcy , butler , & vogt 2000 ) .",
    "furthermore , a novel approach has recently detected the doppler - shifted light reflected from a massive , gas - giant planet orbiting @xmath1 botis . utilizing high resolution optical spectroscopy ,",
    "the variability of observed spectral features have provided an estimation of the planet s size , assuming a jupiter - like albedo ( collier cameron , horne , penny & james 1999 : cchpj99 ) .",
    "these approaches are currently only applicable to stars within a few tens of parsecs of the sun .",
    "gravitational microlensing , however , has the potential to detect planetary systems at several kiloparsecs .",
    "the search for microlensing by machos within the galactic halo , proposed by paczyski ( 1986 ) and first detected by alcock et al .",
    "( 1992 ) , has become an veritable astronomical cottage industry , with several groups monitoring stars towards various sources  .",
    "these studies have proved to be very successful , identifying @xmath2 candidates .",
    "a substantial fraction of these events display complex light curves , characterized by rapid and multiple fluctuations , indicative of microlensing by a binary pair of compact objects ( alcock et al .",
    "when the mass ratio between the two microlensing bodies is very much different from unity , as is the case with planetary systems , the result is less dramatic with the resultant light curve exhibiting the general isolated body bell - shaped profile , with the addition of a relatively short time scale additional fluctuation ( e.g. mao & paczyski 1991 ; gould & loeb 1992 ; wambsganss 1997 ) .",
    "several halo microlensing light curves are seen to possess such fluctuations , indicative of the existence of planetary mass companions of the macho bodies ( e.g. bennett et al .",
    "1999 ; rhie et al . 1999 ; alcock et al .",
    "2000 ) , although the interpretation of these events still remains controversial ( albrow et al .",
    "2000 ) .",
    "these approaches focus upon the perturbative effects induced by planets orbiting the macho lensing objects induce on the caustic structure . here",
    "we consider instead planets orbiting the microlensing sources , namely stars in the lmc , smc and the galactic bulge , and examine how large magnifications , induced when the planetary systems is swept by a fold caustic , can probe the physical properties of the planet .    during the final stages of the preparation of this paper , the recent work of graff & gaudi ( 2000 ) was brought to our attention .",
    "they too consider the discovery of planets in the galactic bulge via the identification of additional photometric features due to caustics sweeping across the planetary system .",
    "their results and those presented here for the photometric light curves are in excellent agreement .",
    "the mathematical basis to the simple microlensing seen in the galactic halo has been presented elsewhere , and will not be reproduced here . the reader is directed towards the excellent review article by paczyski ( 1996 ) .",
    "the important scale length , the einstein radius in the plane of the lensing masses , is defined to be @xmath3^{\\frac{1}{2 } } au\\ , , \\label{einstin}\\ ] ] where @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the distances between the source ( @xmath7 ) , lens ( @xmath8 ) and observer ( @xmath9 ) , and @xmath10 is @xmath11 . for a solar mass star located midway between the earth and the galactic bulge ( @xmath12 ) , @xmath13 .",
    "the corresponding value for microlensing of sources in the magellanic clouds ( @xmath14 ) is @xmath15 .",
    "a single , isolated mass produces a very simple point - like caustic structure , and for a source to be significantly magnified it must be extremely well aligned with this caustic feature .",
    "when , however , the lens consists of a binary pair of masses , the combination of the two lensing potentials unfolds the point - like caustic structure into a more complicated , extended form ( schneider & weiss 1986 ) .",
    "this caustic structure is dominated by ` fold catastrophes ' , for which the magnification is singular along a line , as opposed to a point for the isolated mass case .",
    "due to their extended nature , fold caustics are powerful probes of emission structure in a source , and can potentially unravel the complex structure of the central regions of active galaxies on a scale far smaller than the resolution of current optical telescopes ( wambsganss & paczyski 1991 ; lewis & belle 1998 ; belle & lewis 2000 ) .",
    "they can also reveal important details of stellar surfaces , such as the extent of limb darkening and polarization distribution ( e.g. simmons , willis & newsam 1995 ; simmons , newsam & willis 1995 ) .",
    "the magnification induced as a point source is crossed by a fold caustic is given by @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the distance from the source to the caustic and @xmath18 is the heaviside step function ( schneider , ehlers & falco 1992 ) .",
    "the ` strength ' of the caustic is denoted by the flux - factor @xmath19 and typically has a value of unity ( kayser & witt 1989 ; witt 1990 ; witt , kayser & refsdal 1993 ) .      of the sample of extra - solar planets known currently , all are at least a substantial fraction of a jupiter mass .",
    "all are seen to orbit close to their host star , with the majority of semi - major axes being less than @xmath20 .",
    "such a distribution may be the result of observational selection effects , because it is these massive , close orbiting planets that would produce the largest doppler reflex .",
    "for the purposes of this study , the source is taken to be similar to the recently identified @xmath1 botis  planetary system ( cchpj99 ) .",
    "@xmath1 botis , an f7v star , has a mass of 1.2@xmath21 and a luminosity of 3.5@xmath22 .",
    "the doppler reflex motion of amplitude @xmath23 and a period of @xmath24  days suggests a planetary companion of 8@xmath25 , orbiting at @xmath26 ( neglecting inclination effects ) .",
    "with such a proximity to its host star , the planet can be expected to reflect a nonnegligible fraction of light towards an observer , and cchpj99 measure @xmath27 of the flux from @xmath1 botisis light reflected from the planet ( but see also charbonneau et al .",
    "1999 & burrows et al .",
    "2000 ) . with this",
    ", the planet has an inferred radius of 1.8@xmath28 ( for cchp99 s preferred albedo ) . while the characteristics of the planet orbiting @xmath1 botis   may be extreme",
    ", it will serve to illustrate the details of the microlensing model .",
    "the magnification of a point - like source is singular at a caustic .",
    "such singularities are , however , integrable for any extended source , resulting in a finite magnification . the maximum by which a source is enhanced as a caustic sweeps across it is given by ( chang 1984 ) ; @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the effective radius of the source in units of the einstein radius , @xmath19 is the flux - factor ( equation  [ caustic ] ) and @xmath31 is a form factor which is dependent upon the surface brightness distribution of the source [ @xmath31 is typically @xmath32 , being 1.39 for a uniform disk ( kayser & witt 1989 ) ] . for a given caustic ,",
    "smaller sources can be enhanced to a greater degree .",
    "sources with a radius of @xmath33 , located in the galactic bulge , are subject to a maximum magnification of @xmath34 , while for a body of radius @xmath35 ( equivalent to the planet orbiting @xmath1 botis ) , this value increases to @xmath36 . here",
    ", the flux - factor is assumed to be 1.2 ( wook , chang & kim 1998 ) .",
    "taking account of the relative distances the corresponding values of magnification for sources in the magellanic clouds are @xmath37 larger .",
    "when observing a microlensing event the light detected is a blend of the star and the reflected light from the planet . in this situation ,",
    "the maximum fluctuation induced in a light curve as a caustic sweeps across a planet is given by @xmath38 employing the parameters for the @xmath1 botis   system described above , @xmath39 .",
    "the corresponding value for a planetary system located in the lmc / smc is @xmath40      combining the microlensing and planetary model , a schematic picture of the microlensing configuration of interest can be drawn ( figure  [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "it is assumed that the star is observed near the end of a binary microlensing event , recognized through its distinctive light curve , and that the star has moved out of the caustic structure .",
    "here it is magnified by @xmath41 .",
    "the caustic has , however , yet to fully leave the stellar system and has yet to cross the planetary companion .",
    "sweeping a caustic across the model @xmath1 botis  system produces the light curve presented in figure  [ fig2 ] .",
    "the upper abscissa is in units of einstein radii for a solar mass star , and the ordinate is the change in brightness of the microlensed source .",
    "the caustic moves from left to right , first crossing the primary star and producing a fluctuation of more than four magnitudes . after this , the caustic moves on over the planet at @xmath42 . due to its smaller size , it undergoes a sharper , stronger magnification , although as it is much fainter than its host star , it produces a much smaller change in magnitude  .",
    "the conversion of the abscissa in figure  [ fig2 ] into observed time is given by : @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the transverse velocity of the microlenses .",
    "for a source in the galactic bulge , with the microlenses located midway between the source and the observer , and assuming a transverse velocity difference of @xmath45 , @xmath46  days ; this has been used to normalize figure  2 and represents the lower abscissa coordinates .",
    "for the magellanic clouds , where we can assume a higher velocity of @xmath47 , the corresponding value is @xmath48  days . following figure  2 , as the caustic sweeps across the planetary system it first crosses the host star , strongly magnifying it for several hours , with the apparent brightness dropping rapidly after the caustic has completely transited the star .",
    "the light curve is then quiescent as the caustic travels the distance from the star to the planet .",
    "the semi - major axis of the @xmath1 botis   planet is inferred to be 0.0462au ; projecting into the plane of the microlensing mass , this corresponds to @xmath49 @xmath50 for the galactic bulge ( magellanic clouds ) , and the time taken for the caustic to sweep across this distance is 9.6@xmath51hrs ( 4.8@xmath52hrs . after this time scale ,",
    "the region of strong magnification associated with the caustic reaches the planet , and the planet undergoes strong magnification @xmath53 for 1 - 2  hours .",
    "again , once the caustic has completely transited the planet its apparent brightness falls rapidly .",
    "given the relatively short duration of such a planetary microlensing ` event ' , orbital motion of the planet has been neglected .",
    "graff & gaudi ( 2000 ) have considered the identification of the photometric variability induced by the presence of a planetary companion of a microlensed source in the galactic bulge , demonstrating that monitoring on a 10-m class telescope , with 5-minute temporal resolution , would provide a detection with a @xmath54 .",
    "while revealing the planet s presence , however , determining its physical properties is much more difficult , as any spectroscopic study would be swamped by the flux from the host star and observations to separate the two components would require integration times much longer than the time scale of any variability .",
    "recently , seager , whitney & sasslov ( 2000 ) investigated the potential nature of the planetary atmospheres , focusing on the particles responsible for reflecting the light from the host star .",
    "this material also acts to polarize the reflected flux , with the degree of polarization being highly dependent upon the particle size and composition , and hence the physical conditions , in the planetary atmosphere . in practice , however , the degree of polarization is very small , ranging up to @xmath55 , dependent on the model geometry and the dominant particle size in the planetary atmosphere .",
    "these polarization values are small due to the dominating presence of the unpolarized flux from the host star .",
    "flat - fielding uncertainties coupled with inevitable variable seeing limit the accuracy of polarization measurements , and as seager , whitney & sasslov ( 2000 ) conclude , the expected values are well below the capabilities of current observational techniques , even for nearby systems .",
    "can gravitational microlensing boost the polarization to a more observable level ? considering a planetary system which induces a fractional polarization of @xmath56 , the value observed when the planet is magnified by a factor @xmath57 is @xmath58 using the maximum magnification of planets described in section 2.3 , the maximum observed fractional polarization during a microlensing event is @xmath59 for a @xmath1 botis - like system in the galactic bulge .",
    "the corresponding number for the magellanic clouds is @xmath60 and so the apparent flux from the systems is substantially more polarized during a planetary microlensing event .    scaling the seager , whitney & sasslov ( 2000 ) fractional polarization estimates from their 51peg model to @xmath1 botis",
    "the maximum intrinsic v - band polarization will be @xmath61 .",
    "thus the magnified fractional polarization will be @xmath62 for galactic bulge sources , and @xmath63 when microlensing sources are in the magellanic clouds . while these values focus upon the ` best - case ' , an examination of fig 2 .",
    "reveals that the planet will be significantly magnified for an extended period ( by @xmath64 for an hour in the galactic bulge ) and so deeper limits can be reached with extended integration times .",
    "it is currently routine to measure polarization at the 0.1% level , and polarimeters are now available on large telescopes , making such measurements possible even for faint sources . with the fors1 polarimeter instrument on eso s very large telescope ,",
    "a @xmath65  sec exposure at two position angles is sufficient to detect @xmath62 fractional polarization in the v - band at the @xmath66 level on a @xmath67 source ( corresponding to the the apparent magnitude of @xmath1 botis  at the distance of the galactic bulge ) . including the effects of extinction , assuming an @xmath68",
    ", the integration needs to be increased to @xmath69  sec to achieve the same detection .",
    "figure  2 reveals that , for the galactic bulge , the magnification exceeds 65 for @xmath70  mins , and hence the polarization exceeds @xmath71 over the same period .",
    "as there will be a distribution in the luminosity of the sources under consideration , the observing strategy can be ` tuned ' to provide significant detections / limits . for @xmath1 botis - type systems in the magellanic clouds ( @xmath72 )",
    ", however , the detection of the expected polarization appears unfeasible with current instrumentation , as the required integration times become comparable to the planet crossing time .",
    "this paper has considered the identification of planets orbiting the sources ( rather than the lenses ) monitored by the gravitational microlensing experiments , namely stars in the galactic bulge and the magellanic clouds . in this case",
    "it is the light reflected from the planetary surface that undergoes significant magnification when crossed by a caustic .",
    "a close - in extrasolar giant planet , such as that identified orbiting @xmath1 botis , would induce a fluctuation of @xmath73 into a microlensing light curve of a source in the galactic bulge ( magellanic clouds ) , easily identifiable a few hours before or after maximum magnification with a monitoring program on a 10-m class telescope ; such photometric variations will be observable in both the galactic bulge and magellanic clouds .",
    "it should be noted that , with the photometry limits available with current telescopes , the latter case is restricted to luminous stars , such as evolved giants .",
    "the determination of the physical properties of the planet is , however , more difficult due to the relatively short duration of the planetary event and the overwhelming flux from the host star .",
    "the light reflected from close - in extrasolar giant planets is expected to be polarized , due to the presence of particles in the planetary atmosphere .",
    "the degree of polarization is strongly dependent upon the composition and particle size and hence the physical conditions of the atmosphere . if unmagnified , this induced polarization is small , well below the detection capabilities of modern telescopes .    as a gravitational microlensing",
    "caustic crosses the planet , the expected degree of induced polarization can be brought to levels now detectable with 10-m class telescopes .",
    "seager , whitney & sasselov ( 2000 ) , however , concede that significant uncertainties still remain in their modeling of the fractional polarization induced by the presence of a planetary companion .",
    "additional effects , such as multiple scattering and blending in crowded fields , which act to reduce the polarization to even smaller values , may take the proposed probe of planetary atmospheres out of reach with current observational techniques .",
    "nevertheless , the huge gain in contrast in the flux of a planet compared to that of its host during a caustic crossing will likely make this an attractive strategy for future investigations .",
    "while such observations of the magellanic clouds are currently beyond current techniques , the polarmetric monitoring of microlensing events in the galactic bulge may reveal more clues to the physical conditions of close - in extrasolar giant planets than studies of planetary systems much nearer to the earth .",
    "we thank e. corbett and j. bailey for very useful discussions .",
    "the anonymous referee is thanked for providing useful comments on the original version of this manuscript ."
