    "for instance , @xcite and @xcite compute radiative transfer models of agb stars that also take into account the evolution of these stars , and one of the methods by which they evaluate their resultant evolutionary model tracks is to compare them to observed data in ccds @xcite and cmds @xcite .",

    "in order to model the thousands of oxygen - rich and extreme agb star candidates and @xmath5100 rsg candidates , we have constructed a grid of @xmath569000 * 2d*ust models . for a summary of the model parameters explored in our grid that will be discussed in this section , see table 1 .      to create the final grid of 68600 models , we first created an initial grid of 1225 models , which we discuss in this subsection .",
    "the final grid explores a range of values in four parameters that have the greatest effect upon the output model spectra .",
    "these four parameters are stellar effective temperature ( t@xmath10 ) , dust shell inner radius ( r@xmath11 ) , optical depth at 10.0@xmath3 ( @xmath12 ) , and stellar luminosity ( l@xmath13 ) .",
    "the first three are true input parameters , as they are required to be chosen before a model can be run ( this includes t@xmath10 , as the choice of this determines which stellar photosphere model is used in the model ) .",
    "these three are inputs for each * 2d*ust model in the initial grid , and a range of values for each of them is explored in the initial grid . as will be discussed individually in detail later , we explored 14 values of t@xmath10 , 4 values of r@xmath11 , and 39 values of @xmath12 .",
    "this gives a total of 2184 total possible models in the initial grid , but of these , only 1225 were kept because the rest had the unphysical condition of dust hotter than the dust sublimation temperature at the dust shell inner radius .",
    "the last parameter , luminosity , is technically a calculated output parameter ( as we discuss later , it is obtained by integrating the input stellar photosphere model over all wavelengths , then using distance to the star to obtain luminosity ; dust mass - loss rate is also a calculated output ) from each model . in constructing the final grid of models from the initial grid , _ via _ scaling relations that are described below , we do , however ,",
    "explore a range of 56 values of luminosity .",
    "as all models in the final grid result from scaling models in the initial grid , all resultant scaled models were acceptable , so this gave a total of 1225@xmath1456 = 68600 models in the final grid .",
    "the output model spectra and seds are then the true outputs of our models .",
    "in addition to being sensitive to the four parameters we explore here , the output models are also sensitive to the properties assumed for the dust grains ; however , these have already been explored by @xcite .",
    "the output spectra are less sensitive to the model parameters besides the grain properties and the four mentioned previously .",
    "each model is computed using the techniques , procedures , and assumptions described by @xcite . here , we enumerate and briefly discuss each of the various properties that serve as input to the code .      as noted previously , we explore both stellar photosphere properties and circumstellar dust shell properties in our model grid . here",
    "we summarize how we allowed these to vary .    to represent the stellar photosphere emission in each of our models , we use phoenix models @xcite for stars of subsolar metallicity ( log(_z_/@xmath15 ) = -0.5 ) to match determinations of the metallicity of the lmc ( @xmath16 ;",

    "we use phoenix models with stellar effective temperatures , t@xmath10 , between 2100k and 4700k , inclusive , in increments of 200k .",
    "we briefly explored using phoenix models over a range of log(g/[cm*s@xmath17 ) values from -0.5 to + 2.5 , but we found that this did not appreciably affect the colors of the output models , so we use phoenix models of log(g ) = -0.5 only .    to determine the radius of a star for a single model , the mass of the star was assumed to be 1 @xmath7 , as this was the only stellar mass for which phoenix stellar photosphere models were available .",
    "the effect of varying stellar mass was explored by @xcite .",
    "they found the optical - to - infrared colors _",
    "v_-_i _ and _ v_-_k _ to be most affected by increasing the mass , with the colors becoming bluer by @xmath50.1 magnitude when mass was increased from 1 @xmath7 to 5 @xmath7for a star with t@xmath10 = 3500k and log(g ) = 0.5 .",
    "b_-_v _ and _ j_-_k _ colors were less affected , and all colors were less affected for hotter stars .",
    "as many of the models in our grid have t@xmath18 3500k , the optical - to - infrared colors of the naked stellar photospheres could be a few tenths of a magnitude bluer than the 1 @xmath7 ones whose models we use .",
    "greater realism in modeling stellar photosphere emission will have to await coverage of higher stellar masses in stellar photosphere model grids .    for all models in the initial grid , this constant combination of 1@xmath7 and log(g )",
    "= -0.5 gives a stellar radius of @xmath5295@xmath19 ( this follows not from the blackbody law but instead as a direct consequence of g = mr@xmath20 ) .",
    "since phoenix models are given in surface flux units , the choice of t@xmath10 and log(g ) = -0.5 determines the surface flux of the star .",
    "the distance to the lmc and the stellar radius then determines the flux density for the stellar photosphere model . from this flux , * 2d*ust computes the stellar luminosity .",
    "this combination of stellar radius of @xmath5295@xmath19 and the stellar photosphere models we use ( with a range of t@xmath10 between 2100k and 4700k ) , in turn , gives a range of luminosities in the initial grid of 150038000 @xmath21 . as we will describe later , for the final grid we explored a range of luminosities between 10@xmath22 and 10@xmath1 using scaling relations on this initial grid .",
    "one property of the circumstellar dust shells that greatly affects the output models is optical depth at 10@xmath3 , @xmath12 . as @xmath12 increases , the infrared excess increases",
    "this is expected from analytical arguments ( see eq . 2 of * ? ? ?",
    "our o - rich agb , rsg , and extreme agb sample spans a range from barely any excess above stellar photosphere emission to very large infrared excesses ; therefore we allowed @xmath12 for our models to range from 10@xmath4 to 26 .",
    "the other property that had considerable effect on the output models was dust shell inner radius , r@xmath11 .",
    "this parameter determines the temperature of the hottest dust , which , in turn , determines the wavelength in the sed at which the emission from the dust shell becomes significant compared to that of the stellar photosphere .",
    "the values of r@xmath11 explored in our grid were 3 , 7 , 11 , and 15 @xmath23 .",
    "we chose this range of r@xmath11 to correspond roughly to the allowable range of dust shell inner radii for o - rich agb stars ( 2.5 - 14@xmath2 ) according to @xcite .",
    "note that the dust shell inner radii used by @xcite in modeling m stars are distributed over this range , and even in some cases approach 14@xmath2 .",
    "the temperature of the hottest dust for a given model was allowed to be at most 1400k , as this is approximately the sublimation temperature of the astrophysically relevant silicates forsterite and enstatite @xcite .",
    "we note that we do not have a model for every possible combination of t@xmath10 , luminosity , @xmath12 , and r@xmath11 , as models with their hottest dust higher than 1400k were rejected from our model grid .      here",
    "we summarize those model parameters that are set at fixed values .",
    "since we intend to keep the models as simple as possible , we explore only the model parameters to which the output spectra are most sensitive  stellar effective temperature , stellar luminosity , dust shell optical depth , and dust shell inner radius .",
    "we fix the rest of the parameters .",
    "this includes those parameters relating to dust grain properties , which for this oxygen - rich model grid are exactly those used by @xcite .",

    "the models are sensitive to the choice of dust grain properties assumed .",

    "we use scaling relations on this grid . for each model in the final grid , the scalar to be used",
    "is determined by dividing the luminosity of the model in the final grid by the luminosity of the model to be scaled from the initial grid .",
    "we then multiply the output flux density at all wavelengths for the appropriate model from the initial grid by this scalar @xcite .",
    "the radius of the star in the final grid is then determined by multiplying the stellar radius of the model in the initial grid by the square root of the scalar because l = 4@xmath32r@xmath33t@xmath34 , and t does not change .",
    "further , the dust ( and , therefore , total ) mass - loss rate of the star is also scaled by the square root of the scalar ( this follows from eq . 2 of * ? ? ?",

    "the new grid has 41 values of luminosity between 10@xmath22 and 2@xmath1410@xmath35 , inclusive , with equal logarithmic spacing in luminosity , such that consecutive luminosity values differ by a factor of about 1.08 .",

    "all 17956 o - rich agb candidates identified from sage photometry as well as the 32 agb stars whose o - rich chemistries have been confirmed from sage - spec spectra fall within the coverage of our models .",
    "we have finer luminosity resolution in the range 10@xmath0 to 2@xmath1410@xmath35 by design , corresponding to the greatest concentration of o - rich agb candidate points ( for k@xmath52 9.5 ) .",

    "only two are outside of the range of our model grid , but we note that extending the grid to lower luminosities would allow these two points to be covered by our grid . however , as the majority of extreme agb stars shown in this cmd may not have o - rich dust chemistry ( see later discussion ) , it may be of little meaning that lower luminosity models would cover these two points . in the future ,",
    "we hope to use sed - fitting as a means to distinguish o - rich from c - rich dust chemistry among the extreme agb sample .",

    "the 1@xmath53 errors on the [ 3.6 ] and [ 8.0 ] magnitudes should be about 0.05 and 0.03 magnitudes , respectively , so the 3@xmath53 error on the [ 3.6]-[8.0 ] color for the sage and sage - spec rsgs could be up to 0.17 magnitude .",
    "similarly , the two sage - spec o - rich agb stars have [ 8.0 ] @xmath54 [ 3.6 ] @xmath54 10 . for these , the typical uncertainties on the [ 3.6]-[8.0 ] color would be slightly higher .",
    "the 2 o - rich agb stars and 2 rsg stars from sage - spec and the 6 rsgs from sage not directly covered by the grid are therefore still consistent with the model grid .",

    "the effect of varying @xmath12 is demonstrated within each track . each yellow circle on a track is for a different value of @xmath12 , with the lowest values ( optically thin models ) being at the bluest colors and highest values ( optically thick models ) being at the reddest colors .",
    "these tracks show that varying @xmath12 has a large effect upon the [ 8.0]-[24 ] color .",
    "these tracks are not evolutionary models ; instead , they demonstrate the effect of chaning the various parameters on the colors and magnitudes of the models .",
    "@xcite performed a similar exercise , with iras color - color diagrams instead of the cmd we explore here , to explore varying the optical depth of their dust shell models on model colors . from bottom ( greatest [ 24 ] magnitude ) to top ( lowest [ 24 ] magnitude ) , the tracks are for models with the following combinations of t@xmath10 , r@xmath11 , and luminosity : 2100k , 15@xmath2 , and 4820@xmath21 ; 3700k , 15@xmath2 , and 16000@xmath21 ; 2100k , 7@xmath2 , and 57000@xmath21 ; and finally 2700k , 7@xmath2 , and 124000@xmath21 .",
    "t@xmath10 has an effect like that of optical depth but lesser in strength .",
    "namely , cooler stars give rise to the reddest models for the optically thickest sources ( bottommost track ) , while warmer stars give rise to the bluest models for the optically thinnest sources ( the track that is second from bottom ) . changing the luminosity translates a track vertically without distortion , as the flux at each wavelength in a model",
    "is scaled by the same scalar to generate a new model with all parameters the same except for the new luminosity ( equal to the old luminosity multiplied by the aforementioned scalar ) .",
    "this exact effect is not shown , but note that , from bottom to top , the tracks correspond to increasing values of luminosity .",
    "the slope of each track changes around the range of [ 8.0]-[24 ] colors of 24 .",
    "this inflection is most likely due to the flattening of the model sed at mid - infrared wavelengths ( @xmath510@xmath3 ) due to the dust shell becoming optically thick at these wavelengths and also the 10@xmath3 silicate feature transforming from being in emission for @xmath47 1 to absorption when @xmath55 1 .",
    "the effect of varying r@xmath11 is demonstrated by the lowest and second - highest tracks .",

    ", we tried fitting the _ ubv _ data in addition to the infrared data we already include in our fitting .",
    "this resulted in slightly lower dust mass - loss rates , but not enough to explain the factor of 6 discrepancy .",
    "another difference is that @xcite and we only use a single type of dust in our modeling , while @xcite use multiple sources for their dust optical properties .",

    "@xcite data is made public , the addition of that data to the sage data will significantly help constrain our modeling of o - rich evolved stars .",

    "colors and magnitudes are synthesized from the model spectra and compared to the observed colors and magnitudes of o - rich agb , rsg , and extreme agb candidates in the sage sample and of a small sample of oh / ir stars from @xcite .",
    "the coverage of the observed data by the models is generally very good .",
    "almost all of the observed data is consistent with the model grid .",
    "the very few data points that are not consistent often are likely misidentifications , while a few of these may suggest stars with dust shells with parameters somewhat outside the range explored in our grid .",
    "the extreme agb candidate points are covered well in the cmds but poorly in the ccds , suggesting the composition of their dust typically disagrees with that assumed for our model grid ( i.e. , silicates ) .",
    "the sage - spec data , when overlaid on the cmds and ccds , lend further support to these ideas  our model grid typically covers the sage - spec o - rich agbs quite well over wide color and magnitude ranges , and most of the extreme agb candidates are more consistent with c - rich agbs in the sage - spec sample than o - rich agbs in the sage - spec sample .",
    "further , our optically thicker models are largely consistent with a small sample of oh / ir stars from the study by @xcite .",
    "we determine lower envelopes to the k@xmath48-[8.0 ] and [ 3.6]-[24 ] colors as a function of k@xmath48-[3.6 ] color for which extreme agb star colors could be consistent with the colors of the models in our oxygen - rich model grid .",
    "we also wish to note that the close general matching of our model grid to the observed data in cmds and ccds gives further support for the dust properties assumed in modeling o - rich evolved stars by @xcite .",
    "finally , our model grid has been tested by finding the best fit model from the grid to each of the photometric seds of stars modeled by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "the quality of fit of model fluxes to observed fluxes is quite good .",
    "the matching between luminosity , @xmath12 , and dust mass - loss rate found for hv 5715 and especially sstsage052206 by our best - fit model here and by the models obtained by @xcite is fairly close .",
    "also , our modeling is found to be consistent with that of m stars by @xcite and fairly consistent with that of m stars by @xcite .",
