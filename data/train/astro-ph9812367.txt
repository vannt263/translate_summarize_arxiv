    "accurate values of galactic extinction are essential for a number of applications , such as measuring distances and peculiar velocities of galaxies . a small error of only 0.015 mag .  in",
    "the r - band galactic extinction corresponds to a systematic distance error of 1% for the fundamental plane distance indicator . when measuring the large - scale bulk motion of galaxies , the small - scale accuracy of reddening maps is not critical , since random errors add to the scatter but do not introduce a systematic bias in the bulk flow . on the other hand ,",
    "large - scale coherent systematic errors in the reddenings would introduce corresponding systematic errors in the bulk flow .    in this paper , we test two reddenings maps for such large - scale systematic errors : the reddening maps of burstein & heiles ( 1982 , hereafter bh ) , which are based on neutral hydrogen ( for @xmath3 , shane - wirtanen galaxy counts are used to determine dust - to - gas ratios ) ; and the maps of schlegel , finkbeiner & davis ( 1998 , hereafter sfd ) which are based on dust emission measured by iras with dust temperatures determined from dirbe data .",
    "note that the two maps are completely independent .",
    "there is some evidence that the bh reddenings are systematically in error in at least one large coherent region of the sky .",
    "burstein et al .",
    "( 1987 , hereafter b87 ) found that the bh reddenings were overestimates ( by a factor 2 ) in the region @xmath1 , @xmath2 ( hereafter referred to as the vela region ) .",
    "note that this region lacks a dust - to - gas ratio estimate .",
    "sfd calibrated their reddening maps using the colors of brightest cluster galaxies from postman & lauer ( 1995 ) and tested their maps with the ",
    "relation and the data of faber et al.(1989 ) . however , sfd did not test for coherent residuals as a function of longitude .",
    "such residuals are the bane of peculiar velocity work ; they are the focus of this paper .    to test the bh and sfd maps , we require a sample of distant objects with standard colors .",
    "our primary sample is the early - type galaxy data set of faber et al .",
    "we will make use of the tight correlation between  index and  color .",
    "lynden - bell et al.(1988 ) used the ",
    "relation to show that putative systematic errors in the bh reddenings could not be large enough to explain the bulk flow of @xmath4 towards , . however , lynden - bell et al .",
    "did not attempt to push this farther and obtain constraints on the accuracy of the bh reddenings .",
    "this was perhaps due to systematic uncertainties in the  index , which are at the level of @xmath5 in  ( davies et al .",
    "1987 ) , equivalent to 0.008 in  or 0.03 in @xmath6-band extinction .",
    "we have recently determined the corrections required to bring indices from 23 different spectroscopic systems onto a standard system , by comparing 1784 repeat  measurements for 418 galaxies ( smith et al .",
    "1997 , hudson et al .",
    "1999 ) . as a result",
    "the uncertainties in the corrections to the 7s  systems have been reduced by a factor 5 .",
    "this allows us to re - examine the reddening maps with increased accuracy .",
    "there has been much discussion in the literature of the value of reddening at the poles , i.e.  the zero - point of the reddening maps .",
    "this zero - point is impossible to calibrate using only extragalactic color standards .",
    "fortunately global zero - point errors have no effect on peculiar velocity work since they are absorbed into the zero - point of the distance indicator .",
    "we make no attempt in this paper to determine the correct zero - point of the reddening maps .",

    "[ sec : ellip ] , we use early - type galaxies as reddening estimators , and present our data and method (  [ sec : method ] ) , results (  [ sec : results ] ) and discuss the effect of photometric errors in the  data (  [ sec : discuss ] ) . in  [ sec : gcrr ] , we constrain the systematic errors in the sfd maps using independent reddening estimates obtained from globular clusters and rr lyrae stars , and we summarize our results in  [ sec : summary ] .",
    "our primary data are the early - type galaxies of the ` seven samurai ' ( 7s ) survey ( faber et al .",

    "it is possible that systematic errors in the  data or  data are responsible for these residuals .",

    "( davies et al .",
    "1987 ) . by inter - comparison of common data ,",
    "these  data have been re - corrected and brought onto a common system ( hudson et al .",
    "1999 ) . while the corrections are large ( as much as 0.02 ) , the uncertainties in these corrections are now considerably smaller ( typically 0.0025 mag ) .",
    "this translates to only 0.002 mag in  which is a factor of 5 smaller than the residual dipole .",
    "therefore systematic errors in  can not account for the residuals .",
    "it is also possible that there are systematic errors in the colors .",
    "we have performed fits in which we allow for a systematic error in color between galaxies in the northern and southern celestial hemispheres . in table",
    "[ tab : dipoles ] we also show fits for bh and sfd after a 0.01 mag correction applied to the northern  values .",
    "when this correction is applied , the residual dipole terms are small and consistent with zero .",
    "thus an offset in photometry can account for the residuals in the sfd comparison .",
    "in fact , the significance of this photometric correction is somewhat higher than the dipole term fitted above .",
    "as discussed above , we can not really distinguish between photometric errors in small patches of the sky and large - scale ( north - south ) photometric offsets .",
    "the  colors tabulated in b87 arise from 10 different photometric systems .",
    "table 4b of b87 indicates that , while most of their photometric systems are of high accuracy ( better than 0.01 mag . in )",
    ", there are several exceptions .",
    "most notable of these is the k3 system ( kpno 0.9 m oct 81 ) .",
    "the k3 system shows a systematic offset of 0.02 mag in  and possibly a weak ( uncorrected ) color term ( b87 ) .",
    "note that about half of the galaxies in the cameleopardis region have  colors from the k3 system , so this may account for some of the deviant galaxies in this region .",
    "it is beyond the scope of this paper to extract the k3 observations from the merged photometry of b87 .",
    "we simply note that although one can interpret the residuals as a north - south photometric offset , it is also possible that errors from one or more subsystems could mimic the same effect .",
    "note that in fig .",
    "[ fig : aitoff ] both bh and sfd have residuals in the same locations ( e.g.  in the vela and cameleopardis regions ) .",
    "since the two reddening maps are independent , this argues that the primary source of these residuals is due to photometric errors .",
    "therefore , while the residual dipole in the sfd comparison may be real , we conclude that it is more likely due to photometric errors .",
    "an independent sample is required to test this residual dipole more thoroughly .",
    "we can perform an independent test of the reddenings using the estimated  toward distant globular clusters ( gcs ) and rr lyrae stars .",
