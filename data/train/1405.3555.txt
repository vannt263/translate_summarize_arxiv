    "the representative examples of the problem   are subsurface flows in heterogeneous media  @xcite where the heterogeneity varies over a wide range of scales .",
    "the aim of this paper is to design and analyze a feti - dp method for solving such problems based on a composite fe / dg discretization .    instead of using the full dg method over the whole domain ,",
    "the composite fe / dg method employs conforming fe methods inside the subdomains , while applies a dg discretization only on the subdomain interfaces to deal with the nonmatching meshes across the interfaces ; see  @xcite .",
    "the local bilinear forms of the discrete problem are composed of three symmetric terms : the one associated with the energy , the one ensuring consistency and symmetry , and the interior penalty term  @xcite to handle the nonconforming fe spaces across the interfaces ; see cf .  -  .",
    "such discretization allows for nonmatching grids which provides greater flexibility in the choice of mesh partitioning and memory storage .",
    "this may be useful particularly when the coefficient varies roughly in one subdomain and mildly in the others .",
    "feti - dp methods , as well as feti  @xcite and bddc  @xcite , have been well established as a class of nonoverlapping domain decomposition methods for solving large - scale linear systems .",
    "these methods have been used widely for standard continuous fe discretization , and verified to be successful both theoretically and numerically ; see  @xcite and references therein .",
    "feti - dp method was firstly introduced in  @xcite following by a theoretical analysis provided in  @xcite . in feti - dp algorithms , we need a relatively small number of continuity constraints across the interface in each iteration step .",
    "the continuity of the solution across the subdomain interfaces is enforced by lagrange multipliers , while the continuity at the subdomain vertices is enforced directly by assigning unique values .",
    "the methods were further improved in  @xcite to use the continuity constraints on the averages across the edges on subdomain interfaces .",
    "the feti - dp methods have been developed more recently , and possess several advantages over the one - level feti method ; see cf .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the feti - dp method was firstly considered for composite fe / dg discretization in  @xcite .",
    "we will follow the same framework as described therein . in  @xcite , the discontinuities of the coefficients are assumed to occur only across the subdomain interfaces .",
    "the main purpose of this paper is to extend the methodology to the case where the coefficients are allowed to have large jumps not only across but also along the subdomain interfaces and in the interior of the subdomains .",
    "we recall that such problems were investigated in the context of feti methods in  @xcite .    in this paper , we will use the same dg bilinear form as in  @xcite , construct our feti - dp preconditioner as in  @xcite , and define the components of the scaling matrix as proposed in  @xcite . for the theoretical aspect",
    ", we employ the cut off technique and the generalized discrete sobolev type inequality , cf .",
    "@xcite , as well as the standard estimates of the edge and vertex functions , cf .",
    "it will be proved that the convergence of the feti - dp method only weakly depends on the jump of coefficients , i.e. , linearly depends on the contrast of the coefficients in the boundary layer . here",
    "we define the boundary layer as the union of fine triangles that touch the subdomain boundaries .",
    "we also show that the condition number estimate of the proposed method is quadratic dependence on @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the subdomain diameter and @xmath9 is the fine mesh size . this quadratic dependence on @xmath7",
    "can be relaxed to a weaker dependence of @xmath10 under stronger assumptions on the coefficients in the interior of the subdomains .",
