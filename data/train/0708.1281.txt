    "the axial vector anomaly plays a fundamental role in the structure of the standard model and describes many physical processes , including the classic decay @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "one can summarize the traditional current algebra manipulations used to treat anomalous processes by an effective action .",
    "this is a functional , @xmath5 , of a chiral field of the pseudoscalar mesons , @xmath6 , and background gauge fields @xmath7 , @xmath8 , coupled to left- and right - handed chiral currents .",
    "it generates ( consistent ) anomalies under local gauge transformations and is known as the wess - zumino - witten ( wzw ) term @xcite .",
    "the wzw term has been developed into a phenomenologically useful form by kaymakcalan , rajeev and schechter ( krs ) @xcite following witten s pioneering work .",
    "it can be understood as arising from a chern - simons term built of yang - mills gauge fields in @xmath9 , suitably compactified such that @xmath10 zero modes emerge as the mesons @xcite .",
    "it applies to any effective theory of pseudo - nambu - goldstone bosons ( pngb s ) coupled to gauge fields , , as in the case of little higgs theories @xcite .",
    "the wzw term arises naturally in connection with topological physics in extra dimensions , and occurs in both top - down @xcite and bottom - up @xcite approaches to holographic qcd in order to correctly match the flavor anomalies of qcd .",
    "the wzw term for spontaneously broken @xmath11 flavor symmetry describes anomalous processes involving the pseudoscalar pngb s and fundamental gauge fields such as the photon .",
    "for example , we have @xmath12 with @xmath13 and @xmath14",
    ". however , the wzw term also summarizes processes containing effective vector mesons in pole approximation , such as @xmath15 , @xmath16 , where @xmath17 ; and @xmath18 , @xmath19 , . , where @xmath20 , with @xmath21 and @xmath22 @xcite .",
    "to leading order in an expansion in @xmath23 the wzw term is seen to contain `` pseudo - chern - simons '' terms ( pcs )  , such as @xmath24 .",
    "recently it has been proposed that terms involving @xmath25 may be of phenomenological interest @xcite , which has stimulated the present work .",
    "presently we note that the standard model implies a pcs term in the lagrangian involving the photon , the z - boson , and the isoscalar @xmath1 vector meson of the form : [ one ] _ ^z^f^ .",
    "the derivation of this result requires a careful accounting of anomalies . in the absence of @xmath1 , gauge invariance",
    "is maintained by the combination of the wzw term and anomaly cancelling contributions from the lepton sector . in the presence of @xmath1 , @xmath26 gauge invariance",
    "must be enforced by including appropriate counterterms , @xmath27 , .",
    "this uniquely specifies the coefficient of eq .",
    ", apart from coupling constant normalizations .",
    "@xmath28 in eq .",
    "should be thought of as a gauge - invariant stueckelberg field , , we are in unitary gauge for the broken @xmath29 generators . for simplicity , we restrict attention to two light flavors and the @xmath1 is coupled to baryon number @xmath30 , inducing the coupling to the nucleon isodoublet @xmath31 , as @xmath32   in this way , the wzw term contains a term @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is the properly normalized goldstone - wilczek skyrmion baryon current when @xmath35 . ] .",
    "we also note that the one - loop diagram responsible for the pcs term is closely related to the electroweak baryon number anomaly .",
    "the full details will be presented elsewhere @xcite .",
    "physically interesting effects arise when we integrate out the @xmath1 and the @xmath0 , replacing them with the baryon current and neutrino current respectively .",
    "the new anomalous interaction is then : s_int = _ f d^4x ^ j _",
    "|^f_l_^f_l f _ , where @xmath36 is the isosinglet baryon current and we sum over all left - handed neutrino flavors .",
    "the normalization factor is : = , _",
    "one could include similar terms for the @xmath37 and @xmath38 mesons , but @xmath1 is expected to dominate .",
    "interesting effects will arise in processes such as : + n & & + + n ( or n ) + + n & & + | + n ( or n ) .",
    "coherent enhancements to these basic processes can occur in situations described by an ambient background baryon density .",
    "we presently turn to two such classes of phenomena : neutrino scattering on nucleons ; and the cooling of a young neutron star .",
    "we briefly mention that an analogous axion - photon - baryon current interaction arises with similarly important implications .",
    "we consider an incident neutrino of any flavor with 4-momentum @xmath39 colliding with a stationary nucleon , producing an outgoing neutrino of momentum @xmath40 , and a photon of momentum @xmath41 .",
    "we assume @xmath42 , where @xmath43 is the nucleon mass and recoil is treated as negligible .",
    "the action then becomes : [ result2 ] s_int d^4x _",
    "0ijk|_l ^i _ l f^jk ^3 ( ) .",
    "the resulting total cross - section is : [ result ] & = & + & = & 2.610 ^ -41 ( e_/gev)^6 ( g_/10.0 ) ^4 ^ 2 .",
    "we remark that there is considerable uncertainty in the value of @xmath44 , generally extracted from nuclear potential models @xcite , and the value we use here is `` conservative . ''    to assess the possible experimental sensitivity to this effect we note that miniboone observes an excess of @xmath45 events with electromagnetic energy and with reconstructed mean neutrino energies of order @xmath46 mev @xcite .",
    "these events look like @xmath47 mev @xmath48 charged current events , but the electron could be faked by the hard photon in our process .",
    "the miniboone @xmath49 beam spectrum is fairly flat from @xmath50 mev to @xmath51 , peaking at @xmath52 mev .",
    "we focus on @xmath53 mev @xmath49 s and assume that these produce photons with @xmath54 mev via our process",
    ". in this energy range miniboone accepts @xmath55 charged current quasi - elastic ( ccqe ) @xmath56 events with cross - section , @xmath57  @xcite .",
    "thus we expect to produce @xmath58 events .",
    "the extra factor of @xmath59 arises from the fact that our process involves both @xmath60 and @xmath61 while ccqe involves only @xmath60 in a carbon target .",
    "our cross - section has a distinctly flat angular distribution , @xmath62 where @xmath63 .",
    "we note , however , that the photon will be pulled forward as form - factor effects , which we have ignored , set in .",
    "while this estimate is extremely naive , it is encouraging that existing experiments may already have sensitivity to our effect . for a more refined analysis",
    "we require an improved @xmath64 on nuclear ( carbon ) targets , including coherence and form - factor effects , and convolution of @xmath64 with the beam spectrum .",
    "additional anomaly mediated interactions can also be studied systematically starting from the wzw term .",
    "for instance , a term @xmath65 involves pion exchange with the nucleus in place of @xmath1 exchange .",
    "however , this process contains @xmath66 , and is not the dominant effect . also , in contrast to ( [ one ] ) , the amplitude for this process does not add coherently over individual nucleons at low energy  .",
    "however , at the energies of interest , the assumption of coherence on the entire nucleus leads to only small effects confined to the forward direction . ] .",
    "we thus conjecture that the anomaly mediated process may be relevant to the miniboone excess .",
    "moreover , it could lead to multiple enhanced prospects for observing quasi - elastic neutrino scattering on nuclei .",
    "modern neutrino experiments could ultimately provide a normalization of the uncertain input parameter , @xmath44 . while the anomaly mediated",
    "neutrino process is higher order , it contains a hard photon .",
    "even for relatively low energy reactor neutrinos , @xmath67 , the enormous flux availability suggests that the anomaly process may be observable .",
    "the hard photon also provides a possible observable for a quartz - cerenkov detector , or liquid halogen bubble detectors , .",
    "the anomaly mediated process is competitive with the conventional processes for neutron star cooling . for illustration",
    ", we consider a particular coherent subprocess in a superconducting neutron star core , but the anomaly mediated process will have a more general applicability .",
    "neutron star cooling is reviewed in @xcite .",
    "the full set of processes contributing to neutron star cooling is complex . in the ultra - high density inner core",
    "the energy loss is dominated by the direct urca process , @xmath68 throughout most of star the nucleons are at lower densities , @xmath69 , and are fermi degenerate . in this case , the direct urca process is highly suppressed .",
    "energy is then typically lost by the modified urca ( murca ) process where a bystander nucleon is included to conserve energy and momentum .",
    "the murca process is affected by the superfluid phase , which appears below a critical temperature @xmath70 .",
    "this reduces the murca rate .",
    "however , new cooling mechanisms associated with cooper pairing of nucleons may turn on at @xmath71 , compensating the murca suppression .",
    "we presently consider typical neutron star densities of @xmath72 ( twice nuclear density @xmath73 ) and assume that the regime @xmath74 contains the standard murca processes .",
    "we summarize these effects by ( see , table 2 of @xcite ) : @xmath75 at temperature @xmath76 .",
    "this describes a collection of various processes , ignoring superfluidic suppression , and permits a naive comparison to our process .",
    "we now want to estimate the cooling rate due to the anomaly mediated process .",
    "our basic assumptions are :    1 .",
    "the degenerate protons pair to make a superconductor .",
    "this spontaneously breaks @xmath77 and gives a mass to the photon , also known as the inverse penetration length of the superconductor .",
    "the mass depends sensitively on strong interaction models , we take @xmath78 as a typical value .",
    "the ( massive ) photons are in thermal equilibrium with the neutrons , protons and electrons in the superconducting interior of the neutron star and we work in the limit @xmath79 .",
    "the photons are therefore characterized by the phase - space distribution function and number density , @xmath80^{-1 } \\",
    ", , \\quad   n_\\gamma = g \\int \\frac{d^3p_\\gamma } { ( 2 \\pi)^3 } f(p_\\gamma ) \\,,\\ ] ] with @xmath81 for a massive spin - one particle . for @xmath82 , we can approximate @xmath83 .",
    "the emissivity of neutrinos due to @xmath84 is @xmath85 thus requiring the decay rate of the photon , @xmath86 .    in the star rest frame the baryon number current is @xmath87 , and the photon 4-momentum is @xmath88 .",
    "however , it is convenient to work in the photon rest - frame , where @xmath89 . in this frame",
    "the nucleon current is slightly boosted : @xmath90 , where @xmath91 and @xmath92 . in the nonrelativistic limit",
    "we thus have : _ p _ & = & + & & |m|^2 ( 2)^4 ^ 4(p_^- p_1-p_2 ) , and the invariant final - state spin - summed and initial state spin - averaged matrix element is : |m|^2 = ^0 _ ^0 _ _ .",
    "this results in the decay rate : _ p _ & = & |_|^2 , and emissivity : [ lum ] q_^anom & = & ce^-m_/t(m_t)^5/2 , + c & = & = 0.012 - 0.96 .",
    "the range of @xmath93 corresponds to a range of @xmath94 to @xmath95 .",
    "we note that both @xmath44 and @xmath96 run with nuclear density , , refs .",
    "@xcite obtain @xmath96 reduced by a factor @xmath97 at @xmath98 .",
    "holding @xmath96 fixed , larger values of @xmath44 account for this effect , as well as other effects , , higher resonance contributions . for standard density @xmath99 ,",
    "this yields an emissivity of q_^anom & = & 2.31 10 ^ 22 erg^-1 ^ -3 + & & m^9/2(g_/10)^4 e^(-11.6m / t_9)(t_9)^5/2 , where @xmath100 .",
    "[ cool ]    we see in fig.(2 ) that this is competitive with the cooling rate from murca processes  , by a factor of @xmath101 . ] .",
    "we note that in the early phase of neutron star formation with @xmath102 , our process may actually dominate .",
    "this will be developed and reported elsewhere  @xcite .",
    "anomaly mediated interactions between photons and neutrinos at finite baryon density may play an important role in laboratory neutrino experiments and astrophysical processes .",
    "the new interaction ( [ one ] ) may be relevant in accounting for the miniboone low energy excess .",
    "it may also play a significant role in neutron star cooling and early stage evolution .",
    "there are many potentially important applications in various other physical regimes",
    ". we will present a more detailed analysis and discussion elsewhere , including the detailed derivation of pcs and axion interactions from the wzw term  @xcite@xcite .",
    "we further remark that the axion will have a similar induced coupling to the photon and the @xmath1 , leading to an interaction of the form : c_axion _",
