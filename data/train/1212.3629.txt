    "infrared companions ( ircs ; koresko et al .",
    "1997 ) are stellar objects characterized as being in binary systems with young stars , being faint in the visible , and dominating the system flux at infrared and longer wavelengths .",
    "being companions to young t tauri stars suggests they are young stars as well , but the source of high extinction has remained a mystery .",
    "koresko et al .",
    "( 1997 ) noted the seven classical ircs because they are well - studied systems , so it is important to identify the sources of extinction for future studies .",
    "as an example , if the extinction is due to ircs having disks seen edge - on , these systems would present a good opportunity to search for molecular absorption originating in the inner disk regions .",
    "gv tau n , a classical irc , was found to exhibit warm molecular c@xmath0h@xmath0 and hcn absorption ( doppmann et al .",
    "2008 ; cf .",
    "gibb et al .  2007 ) , rare features previously found in only one other disk system ( irs 46 ; lahuis et al .  2006 ) , which provided an important benchmark for inner disk chemistry models ( e.g. agndez et al .",
    "2008 ; woods & willacy 2009 ) .",
    "another disk scenario that may cause the extinction seen toward ircs is if the disk around the primary extends into the line of sight to the irc ( e.g. vv cra ; smith et al .",
    "2009 , kruger et al .",
    "molecular absorption seen in this geometry would originate in the outer regions of the primary disk , likely resulting in largely different temperatures and column densities than expected toward an edge - on disk .",
    "thus it would be important to discern between these disk geometries before further studies of edge - on disks are confused by these disk systems .",
    "doar 24eb is a classical infrared companion to the young star doar 24ea , seen with a separation of 2@xmath1.03 with the irc at a position angle of 150@xmath2 ( e of n ) relative to the primary ( ghez et al .",
    "koresko et al .",
    "( 1997 ) modeled the primary as being a k0 type star with temperature 5240 k , while the irc was modeled as having a central stellar temperature of 4850 k. we observed this system as part of our _ spitzer _ infrared spectrograph ( irs ) observing program of edge - on circumstellar disks and ircs .",
    "we present here findings for the doar 24e system and investigate the disk geometry of this system and the reason for the high extinction toward doar 24eb . in section 2 , we introduce the observations taken . in section 3 , we describe the data reduction and discuss the detections .",
    "we then discuss modeling and conclusions in section 4 , and give a summary of our findings in section 5 .",
    "doar 24e was part of our _ spitzer _ cycle 5 general observers campaign , program i d 50152 , to use the infrared spectrograph ( irs ; houck et al .",
    "2004 ) in short - low and short - high ( sl and sh ) stare mode .",
    "the sl module has a slitwidth of 3.6@xmath1 , plate scale of 1.8@xmath1 pixel@xmath3 ( 270 au pixel@xmath3 assuming a distance of 150 pc to the system ) , and covers the spectral range 5.2 - 14.5 mm with resolution r=60 - 127 , while the sh module has a slitwidth of 4.7@xmath1 , plate scale of 2.3@xmath1 pixel@xmath3 ( 350 au pixel@xmath3 ) , and covers 9.9 - 19.6 mm with r=600 .",
    "the observations were designed to search for weak absorption features and so followed the observing technique described in carr & najita ( 2008 ) .",
    "we shortened the exposure time of each data frame to 6 seconds and increased the number of integrations to verify repeatability of the observations .",
    "each setting ( sl1 , sl2 , and sh ) had twelve on - source data frames at each nod position , accompanied with half as many off - source integrations of the blank sky for hot pixel subtraction and to remove background emission .",
    "the observation ( aor : 25679616 ) was taken on 2008 september 11 at @xmath4 .",
    "the coordinates were chosen to center the slit on doar 24eb , calculated by using the position of doar 24ea from simbad and the offsets found by chelli et al .",
    "the observation used the nominal pointing accuracy of @xmath5 .",
    "the slit position angles during the observations were 139.4@xmath2 for the sh module and 2.6@xmath2 for the sl . given the primary - irc position angle of 150@xmath2 and separation 2@xmath1.03 ( ghez et al .",
    "1993 ) , and the widths of the sh and sl slits ( 4@xmath1.7 and 3@xmath1.6 , respectively ) , we would expect a majority of the flux from both binary components to be within the slit for both observations .",
    "a 4% continuum flux difference between the sh and sl modules was corrected by scaling the sl spectrum by a constant , without any adjustments to the continuum shape , to match the sh spectrum at wavelengths where the orders overlap .      on 2009",
    "april 6 , we took long - slit spectra with phoenix ( hinkle et al .",
    "2002 ) on gemini south to examine the co fundamental vibrational transitions .",
    "we used the standard four pixel slit ( @xmath6 ) with r=50,000 , along with the m2150 filter with the echelle angle oriented to detect the @xmath7co v=1 - 0 r(3)-r(5 ) transitions near 4.62 mm , and the m2030 filter for the p(20)-p(21 ) transitions near 4.86 mm .",
    "each abba nod position had a 120 second integration with four 30 second exposures co - added internally .",
    "standard star observations were taken before the science frames for telluric division .",
    "only doar 24eb was within the slit during the observation due to a sign error in the position angle given for the queue observation .      to search for extended emission and to find flux ratios between binary components , we used t - recs ( telesco et al .",
    "1998 ) on gemini south to image doar 24e in 6 filters ranging from 7.7 - 18.3 mm ( see table 1 ) .",
    "we took calibration images of standard stars before and after doar 24e .",
    "observations were taken by cycling through all six filters once on target .",
    "we used the standard 3 position chop - nod observing sequence and used the off - beams only for background subtraction .",
    "these observations were taken 2009 june 8 .",
    ".fluxes as measured with t - recs imaging [ cols=\"<,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      we used custom idl routines to reduce the t - recs images .",
    "high winds during the observation greatly reduced the image quality , so the images were centered on the peak of the target flux before combining .",
    "we searched for extended emission by varying the extraction apertures , but found none .",
    "deconvolution using _ lucy _ in iraf gave the same results .",
    "we detected both binary components in all images .",
    "we used a @xmath8 aperture radius to estimate the photometric fluxes for the individual binary components , and the results are listed in table 1 .",
    "we find a binary separation of @xmath9 at a position angle of @xmath10 .",
    "ghez et al .  ( 1993 ) also measured a separation of @xmath11 in july 1990 , so we conclude that these objects have similar proper motions and are associated with each other . as the change in separation since this observation is @xmath12 , this shows the velocity difference between the objects in the direction perpendicular to our line of sight is < 3.7 km s@xmath3 , assuming the system is 150 pc away .",
    "we also find the combined fluxes are similar to the _ spitzer _ irs spectrum , shown in figure 1 , assuming a 5% flux loss from both components during the irs observation .",
    "we assume a flux loss from both components as the irs slit was within 10@xmath2 of the actual position angle of the doar 24e components during the observation .",
    "najita et al .  ( 2003 ) showed that co emission is commonly detected toward t tauri stars , and most likely originates from the inner 5 au of the disk .",
    "they found the emission lines typically had fwhm of @xmath13 km s@xmath3 , similar to that found in the r(3)-r(5 ) transitions of doar 24eb ( fwhm@xmath14 km s@xmath3 ) .",
    "we thus continue with the assumption that this emission largely originates from the inner 5 au of the disk of doar 24eb .",
    "we do note , however , the p(21 ) transition has a different velocity profile than the r(3)-r(5 ) transitions as it peaks at -15 km s@xmath3 , has a fwhm of 45 km s@xmath3 , and is not gaussian . while the v=2 - 1 p(15 ) transition complicates the profile , the red side of the v=1 - 0 p(21 ) transition appears to be broader than the blue side .",
    "we modeled the co gas absorption components to extract temperature and column density estimates .",
    "the velocity widths of these components are near the best - case instrument resolution of 5.88 km s@xmath3 ( hinkle 1999 ) , so we can not get precise measurements , but we can find a range of values that would result in the observed equivalent widths .",
    "we modeled the transitions using a uniform temperature slab model with a covering factor of 1 and assuming the gas is in local thermodynamic equilibrium .",
    "we considered a wide range of temperatures and column densities and used a @xmath15 goodness - of - fit to find the best - fit parameters .",
    "the results are shown in figure 4 .",
    "( see text ) . ]",
    "the co absorption feature at v@xmath16 km s@xmath3 ( a3 ) has a small fwhm of 6.1 km s@xmath3 . using the best - case instrument resolution of 5.88 km s@xmath3 , we modeled the absorbing gas with an intrinsic velocity width of 1.6 km s@xmath3 .",
    "the temperature and column density are not well constrained ; the temperature we found is 75@xmath1750 k with a column density of @xmath18 @xmath19 , but these parameters are sensitive to the turbulent velocity . if we assume an instrument resolution of 6.0 km s@xmath3 , just less than the velocity width of a3 and corresponding to an intrinsic turbulent velocity of 1.1 km s@xmath3 , the estimated 1-@xmath20 column density increases to @xmath21 cm@xmath3 and the temperature decreases to @xmath23 k.    the absorption feature at v@xmath24 km s@xmath3 ( a-6 ) has a fwhm of 6.8 km s@xmath3 .",
    "we modeled these transitions with a turbulent velocity of 3.4 km s@xmath3 and found a best - fit temperature of @xmath25 k and column density @xmath26 @xmath19 .",
    "these estimates show little dependence on the turbulent velocity used . again using an instrument resolution of 6.0 km s@xmath3 and resulting turbulent velocity of 3.2 km s@xmath3",
    ", we find a temperature estimate of @xmath27 k and column density @xmath28 @xmath19 .",
    "to further investigate the co absorption , we obtained spectroscopic data from the cryogenic high - resolution infrared echelle spectrograph ( crires ; kufl et al .",
    "2004 ) that was reported in pontoppidan et al .",
    "these spectra include the @xmath7co r(0)-r(1 ) and p(1)-p(9 ) transitions and were observed on 2007 september 3 .",
    "the spectrum of doar 24ea shows only the a3 absorption lines . the emission line profile for doar",
    "24eb does not appear to change between the low- and high - j transitions , up to p(9 ) .",
    "we also found the a3 transitions have an average fwhm width of 3.6 km s@xmath3 , while the a-6 lines have an average width of 4.9 km s@xmath3 .",
    "given the measured instrument resolution of 3.18 km s@xmath3 ( crires user manual , issue 85.2 ) , this would indicate fwhm turbulent velocity widths of 1.7 and 3.7 km s@xmath3 , respectively .",
    "this is comparable to the turbulent velocity estimates with the phoenix data ( 1.6 and 3.4 km s@xmath3 , respectively ) . the a3 line is only seen up to the p(7 ) transition , showing it originates in cooler gas ( < 50 k ) .",
    "it is difficult to estimate the optical depth of the a-6 transitions due to being so near the strong telluric co absorption and the emission line profile changing for higher transitions .",
    "however , the a-6 absorption lines are seen through the p(9 ) transition , and we find that modeling the gas with temperature 115 k and column density @xmath29 @xmath19 , as found with the phoenix spectrum , fits the crires spectrum well .",
    "the emission line in the crires spectrum is slightly narrower than found with phoenix , and peaks at negative velocities .",
    "if we again estimate the emission as a gaussian , we find it has a fwhm of 54 km s@xmath3 and v@xmath30 km s@xmath3 ( see figure 5 ) .",
    "this change in velocity from the emission seen in the phoenix spectrum may be due to complicated details within the inner regions of the disk , possibly due to doar 2eb itself being a binary ( koresko 2002 ) .     and v@xmath30 km s@xmath3 .",
    "the two absorption lines were found by using the turbulent velocity estimates and average absorption strengths found in the phoenix spectrum , convolved with the crires resolving power of 3.18 km s@xmath3 ( see text ) , showing a good fit to the absorption lines in the crires spectrum . ]",
    "there are several possible locations for the two absorbing co gas columns , among which are a disk , disk wind , or envelope associated with doar 24eb , the outer regions of a disk around doar 24ea , or the interstellar medium ( ism ) .",
    "the main source of interstellar extinction is likely the @xmath31 ophiuchus ( @xmath31 oph ) cloud .",
    "this cloud has a system velocity of v@xmath32 km s@xmath3 , similar to the a3 co. chelli et al .",
    "( 1988 ) estimated an interstellar extinction of a@xmath33 mag for doar 24ea , so if we use the interstellar ratio of n(co)/a@xmath34 @xmath19 mag@xmath3 ( rettig et al .",
    "2006 ) , we would expect a co column density of @xmath35 cm@xmath3 .",
    "this column density is within the 1-@xmath20 error of the estimate for the a3 co , and the low temperature of the absorbing gas ( < 50 k ) is typical for the ism .",
    "the crires spectrum also includes doar 24ea within the slit ( although the spectrum of doar 24ea was not included in pontoppidan et al .",
    "2011 ) and we find that doar 24ea also shows the a3 line with a similar velocity profile and equivalent width as doar 24eb .",
    "we conclude the a3 co gas is associated with the ism .",
    "the a-6 line is not seen toward doar 24ea in the crires spectrum , so this co is associated with the material that is extinguishing doar 24eb but not doar 24ea .",
    "koresko et al .",
    "( 1997 ) used h and k band photometry to model the infrared companion doar 24eb and estimated a high extinction of a@xmath36 mag . removing the interstellar extinction , this would indicate a@xmath37 mag for the material that is obscuring doar 24eb but not doar 24ea . again comparing to the n(co)/a@xmath38 ratio of the ism , this would indicate a high co column density of @xmath39 @xmath19 , which is nearly 2 orders of magnitude greater than what we estimated for the a-6 co. while this implies a substantially smaller gas / dust ratio than is seen in the ism ( @xmath40% ) , it may be because the m - band continuum is coming from a larger region of the disk than where the near - infrared extinction is occurring , resulting in a covering factor of < 1 .",
    "this may also explain why we do not see a large silicate absorption feature in the _ spitzer _ irs spectrum as expected for a system showing such high extinction .",
    "while the location of the a-6 co is unclear , it would not be associated with the outer disk regions of doar 24ea . assuming a distance of 140 - 160 pc to the system , the binary components have a projected separation of 285 - 325 au , and the gas temperature of @xmath41 k is high for these disk radii .",
    "furthermore , doppmann et al .  ( 2003 ) observed the photospheric absorption of doar 24ea ( gy 20a ) to find a redshift of v@xmath42 km s@xmath3 .",
    "if the a-6 co was associated with doar 24ea , the gas would have a 12.2 km s@xmath3 velocity shift from the central stellar component , much too high for gas at these disk radii .",
    "with such a large column only seen toward doar 24eb , and having a discrete velocity shift of -9 km s@xmath3 from the surrounding cloud , it is difficult to envision a physical situation in which this is not associated with the disk of doar 24eb .",
    "it is unknown if the a-6 line is at the system velocity of doar 24eb , or possibly shifted from the central star velocity , such as in a disk wind .",
    "to further investigate the system , we used the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) model fitter described in robitaille et al .",
    "this tool finds a best - fit to an input sed using a database of 200,000 pre - computed radiation transfer models of circumstellar disks , with 14 physical parameters varied at 10 different disk viewing angles ranging from 18.2 to 87.1@xmath43 .",
    "the models differentiate the circumstellar extinction , due to the disk material between the stellar surface and the outer edge of the disk , and the interstellar extinction between the disk edge and the observer .",
    "the user inputs spectral points , and can constrain the distance to the system and the interstellar extinction .",
    "the best - fit models are then returned in order of increasing @xmath15 value .",
    "the estimates for the distance to the @xmath31 oph star forming region are in the 140 - 160 pc range , we found that using this limited distance range resulted in only a few returned models .",
    "we thus extended the distance range by 20 pc in both directions ( 120 - 180 pc ) in order to get a range of disk parameters .",
    "we then used only those models with @xmath44 , where n is the number of input data points , and stellar temperatures within 500 k of estimates in koresko et al .",
    "we show the best - fit models described below in figure 6 .",
    "table 4 reports parameters for the best - fit models , as well as the minimum and maximum values of each individual parameter for the models returned given the @xmath15 cut - off .",
    "we first fit the sed of doar 24ea for comparison with predictions .",
    "we constrained the interstellar extinction to be in the 0 - 10 mag range , and find the models are close to previous estimates . while koresko et al .",
    "( 1997 ) modeled this system as having a central stellar temperature of 5240 k , the model stellar temperatures are consistently lower ( @xmath45 k ) .",
    "this may account for the modeled interstellar extinction ( 5.3 mag ) being slightly lower than previous estimates ( e.g. 6.2 mag ; chelli et al .",
    "the models predict the system does not have an infalling envelope .",

    "we investigated the source of the high extinction toward the infrared companion doar 24eb , and considered several disk and envelope geometries that may explain the high extinction toward doar 24eb : a disk or envelope around doar 24eb , the outer regions of a disk around doar 24ea , or the interstellar medium ( ism ) . to test the scenarios , we analyzed near - infrared spectra from phoenix of the co fundamental transitions and modeled the mid - infrared photometric fluxes we found with t - recs imaging .",
    "doar 24eb shows two @xmath7co absorption features at v@xmath16 ( a3 ) and -5.8 km s@xmath3 ( a-6 ) . using a slab model and optically thick gas , we found the a-6 co has a temperature of @xmath41 k and column density @xmath56 @xmath19 while the a3 co has a higher column density ( @xmath57 @xmath19 ) .",

    "<S> we present findings for doar 24e , a binary system that includes a classical infrared companion . </S>",
    "<S> we observed the doar 24e system with the _ spitzer _ infrared spectrograph ( irs ) , with high - resolution , near - infrared spectroscopy of co vibrational transitions , and with mid - infrared imaging . </S>",
    "<S> the source of high extinction toward infrared companions has been an item of continuing interest . </S>",
    "<S> here we investigate the disk structure of doar 24e using the column densities , temperature , and velocity profiles of two co absorption features seen toward doar 24eb . </S>",
    "<S> we model the seds found using t - recs imaging , and investigate the likely sources of extinction toward doar 24eb . </S>",
    "<S> we find the lack of silicate absorption and small co column density toward doar 24eb suggest the mid - infrared continuum is not as extinguished as the near - infrared , possibly due to the mid - infrared originating from an extended region . </S>",
    "<S> this , along with the velocity profile of the co absorption , suggests the source of high extinction is likely due to a disk or disk wind associated with doar 24eb . </S>"
