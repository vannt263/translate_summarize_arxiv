    "the evolution of the universe is believed to involve several symmetry breaking phase transitions , out of which , topological defects , such as strings , are created @xcite .",
    "these transitions can be examined in the framework of condensed matter systems .",
    "although there are differences from the cosmological case where , relativistic dynamics must be used and gravity is important , the formation of such defects in the laboratory @xcite , can provide helpful hints for cosmology .",
    "topologically stable knots and vortex - like structures in general , are of wide interest in condensed matter physics .",
    "for example , one can think of bose - einstein condensates ( bec ) ( i.e. see @xcite ) , vortices in superfluid helium-3 and helium-4 @xcite , or nematic liquid crystals @xcite .    also , in the framework of high energy physics , future experiments in lhc could answer whether metastable particle - like solitons exist in minimal supersymmetric standard model or two - higgs standard model ( 2hsm ) or not . in @xcite-@xcite ,",
    "work on classically stable , metastable quasi - topological domain walls and strings in simple topologically trivial models , as well as in the 2hsm has been done .",
    "these solutions are local minima of the energy functional and can quantum mechanically tunnel to the vacuum , not being protected by an absolutely conserved quantum number .",
    "one can also find other interesting subjects involving superconducting vortex rings such as , rotating superconducting rings @xcite , electroweak strings @xcite or work on such rings in @xmath2 non - abelian yang - mills - higgs model @xcite .",
    "finally , twisted semilocal vortices examined in @xcite can be connected to the models we present below , while one can also search if stable rings can exist in that model .",
    "this paper consists of two parts . in the first part",
    ", we consider a @xmath3 model with a modified ginzburg - landau ( gl ) potential .",
    "the modification has to do with the addition of a cubic term . in thermal field theory ,",
    "such term comes from the @xmath4-loop radiative corrections to the gl potential @xcite .",
    "we search whether this model can admit stable strings or not .",
    "the features of such strings , if they exist , are the supercurrent which flows on the surface of the defect within a certain finite width , as well as , a magnetic flux in the interior of the defect .",
    "this magnetic flux is a consequence of the existence of the supercurrent .",
    "one has to keep in mind that the magnetic field can penetrate in a certain depth inside the superconducting regions where the supercurrent flows .",
    "if the penetration depth is greater than the width of the superconducting surface , then the defect becomes unstable and can be destroyed .",
    "the gl potential we use here , is used in condensed matter physics as well ( see @xcite and references therein ) thus , one can also make interesting connections with that sector and the experiments described in the first paragraph .",
    "stable defects of this @xmath3 model , can also be used to form torus - like strings and study their stability .",
    "this can happen by taking a piece of such straight string and periodically connect its ends together .",
    "these string loops are examined in @xcite but in the framework of a @xmath1 model , where the existence of the defect is ensured for topological reasons @xcite .",
    "that model , is a continuation of previous work @xcite-@xcite . in the second part of this paper ,",
    "we examine a modified version of the model in @xcite .",
    "we add higher derivative terms which might help in stabilizing the torus - shaped soliton .",
    "we investigate that possibility , present and analyse our results .",
    "this model consists of a complex scalar field @xmath5 and a gauge field @xmath6 .",
    "the lagrangian density describing our system is : @xmath7 where the covariant derivative is @xmath8 , the strength of the field is @xmath9 , while @xmath10 is the @xmath3 charge .",
    "we choose the potential @xmath11 where @xmath12 constants .",

    "the vacuum is @xmath15 .",
    "this vacuum leaves unbroken the gauge symmetry @xmath3 . when @xmath16 ) , we have @xmath17 giving non - zero mass to @xmath18 .",
    "thus , one may generate an electric current flowing along regions where @xmath19 . in fig.[pot ]",
    "one can see the shape of the potential .",
    "the eq.([eqmin ] ) gives the position of the minimum of interest for every @xmath20 .",
    "when @xmath21 , the secondary ( non - trivial ) minimum of the potential disappears , at @xmath22 position .",
    "when @xmath23 , it becomes zero only at @xmath15 , while another minimum with non - zero @xmath24 forms .",
    "when @xmath25 , the potential has another zero at @xmath26 which is also a local minimum . finally , when @xmath27 it has two more zeros at @xmath28 between which , it becomes negative ( fig.[neg ] ) .",
    "the mass spectrum is @xmath29    -profile of the system on the right .",
    "the left picture is strongly reminiscent of an infinite solenoid.[sole ] ]      we are interested in configurations having cylindrical symmetry , that is , infinite straight strings ( fig.[sole ] ) .",
    "the field @xmath5 can be non - vanishing on a cylindrical surface of specific radius . at infinity @xmath30",
    ", we have the vacuum of the theory @xmath15 .",
    "the ansatz for the fields is : @xmath31 where @xmath32 the winding number of the field @xmath5 and @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 are the cylindrical unit vectors .",

    "we work in the @xmath38 gauge . for the gauge field",
    "we suppose the above form based on the following thought : the @xmath39 field is the one produced by the supercurrent flowing on the cylindrical surface .",
    "the current is in the @xmath34 direction thus , we expect the non - vanishing component to be @xmath40 and the amplitude @xmath41 of @xmath5 to be independent of @xmath42 .",

    ". the algorithm is written in c. one can find details about the algorithm used , on page 425 of @xcite but , briefly , the basic idea is this : given an appropriate initial guess , there are several corrections to it , having as a criterion the minimization of the energy in every step . when the corrections at the value of the energy are smaller than @xmath73 the program stops and we get the final results .",
    "we are interested in final configurations having non - trivial energy .",
    "this signals the existence of a stable vortex with that energy .",
    "we check our results through virial relation ( [ virsol ] ) .",
    "finally , our results must also satisfy the field equations ( [ fieq ] ) .",
    "the initial guess we use for our computation is : @xmath74 where @xmath75 are constants , the value of which , depends also on the location of the minimum ( say @xmath76 ) of the potential . for the final configurations we present on the figures",
    ", we chose @xmath77 .",
    "the initial guess also satisfies the appropriate asymptotics    * near @xmath78 : @xmath79 * at infinity : @xmath80 , exponentially    while @xmath41 must be non - zero somewhere between @xmath81 and @xmath82 .",
    "one must make a careful choice of the initial guess . that is to say ,",
    "the maximum value of @xmath41 at the initial guess ( dashed lines ) must be inside the favorable area denoted by the horizontal lines in figs.[pa217]-[pa213 ] .",
    "this area is dictated by the form of the potential and especially by its negative sectors ( see fig.[neg ] ) .     and",
    "@xmath83 as @xmath84 goes from 2.17 ( dashed and dotted - @xmath85 - ) , to 2.15 ( dashed - - - ) and 2.13 ( dotted @xmath86).[comp ] ]    since , for values of @xmath87 where @xmath88 is valid , we find no non - trivial solution , we searched and tried to find out what happens when we make the minimum of interest deeper .",
    "for that reason we searched in the region where @xmath89 .",
    "it is possible to find solutions to this model until @xmath87 reaches @xmath90 ( from above ) . under this value , this is difficult if not impossible .",
    "even at @xmath91 ( fig.[pa213 ] ) we use great values of @xmath84 in order to find the solution exhibited . the relation between @xmath84 and @xmath87",
    "can be found in fig.[ab ] .",
    "the solutions of the model for two different values of @xmath27 , are shown in figs.[pa217]-[pa213 ] and a comparison between them in fig.[comp ] in order to observe their different features .",
    "we observe that for a specific @xmath87 , there is a small range for the parameter @xmath84 of the potential , where the model exhibits the solution presented in the figures . out of this small range and for greater",
    "@xmath84 , we end up to a final configuration of negative energy .",
    "this happens because , the bigger the parameter @xmath84 becomes , the stronger the potential is , thus the field @xmath41 strongly prefers to acquire the value where the non - trivial minimum of the potential is ( see fig.[pot ] ) , in order to decrease further the energy .",
    "but , for @xmath89 we have @xmath93 at the position of that minimum , which also enforces the total energy @xmath94 to be negative in this case .",
    "we have to note that , virial relation of such a final configuration is _ not _ satisfied due to the great values the term @xmath95 acquires around @xmath81 and @xmath82 .",
    "this is clear if one directly observe ( [ virsol ] ) , which can not be satisfied for @xmath93 .    on the other hand , for smaller values of @xmath84",
    ", we get the trivial configuration ( @xmath96 ) , as the benefit from the potential term is no longer satisfactory in order to have a non - trivial @xmath41 .",
    "now , for high values of @xmath87 ( i.e. @xmath97 ) we faced difficulties in finding a solution .",
    "we believe that this has the following explanation : as @xmath87 grows , the area of values where the potential @xmath48 is negative , increases as well .",
    "if the parameter @xmath84 is big , then the potential becomes a strong factor in reducing the energy , as it is highly negative .",
    "thus , for big @xmath84 it is energetically favorable to decrease further the potential value .",
    "the latter happens by converting @xmath41 function in such a way , so as to be , as much of it as possible , inside the energetically favorable area ( it is denoted by the horizontal lines in the figs.[pa217]-[pa213 ] ) .",
    "thus , we end up to a final configuration with potential @xmath98 and virial relations can not be satisfied ( see for example eq.[virsol ] ) as we have a sum of positive terms .    on the other hand , for lower @xmath84",
    "the potential is no longer a strong factor for reducing the energy . in this case",
    ", it is energetically favorable to reduce the value of the @xmath95 and @xmath99 terms as the system can gain more from these .",
    "the consequence is that @xmath41 leaves the area of stability as its peak lowers in order to reduce the two terms above and there is only one possibility : to end up to zero energy , that is to say , the trivial configuration .",
    "the difference in the stable solutions we have found above , is that the values of @xmath87 are such , that the potential is negative but not strongly negative while the changes on the terms @xmath95 and @xmath99 can deform the field @xmath41 in such a way , so that it can still be inside the favorable area . then , the potential term has the possibility to change in such a way , so it can satisfy virial as well .     and @xmath100 solution of eq.([ppmm ] ) , for which the potential becomes zero . between these lines",
    "the potential gets negative values ( see also fig.[pot ] ) .",
    "the plot is @xmath41 vs. @xmath87 for @xmath101.[neg ] ]      in the following explanation we will use fig.[comp ] & [ neg ] . in fig.[comp ] one can observe that as we get closer to the critical value @xmath103 , the @xmath41 field tends to acquire everywhere the value @xmath104 ( location of the non - trivial minimum of the potential ) .",
    "this leads to greater values of @xmath105 .",
    "the above has a reasonable explanation which can be found in fig.[neg ] .",
    "as we get closer to @xmath106 , the space within the lines , where the potential can get negative values , becomes smaller . under @xmath106",
    "the potential can be either positive or zero ( the latter for @xmath107 only ) .    observe the energy functional to be minimized : @xmath108\\ ] ]",
    "the main target of minimization is to `` fix '' all the above terms in order to have the minimum possible value for the energy .",
    "below , we analyze the possible cases .",
    "* @xmath109 : +   with respect to @xmath87 .",
    "we observe that as we approach the limit @xmath106 , we need an increasingly deeper minimum of the potential which is expressed through the fastly increasing value of @xmath84",
    ". the dashed vertical line signals the position of @xmath110.[ab ] ] + in that case , all terms except for the potential term , can be either positive or zero .",
    "the potential term ( as we saw in fig.[neg ] ) can become negative for a range of values of @xmath41 .",
    "but , as @xmath87 decreases , this range becomes narrower ( as we see in fig.[neg ] as well as in figs.[pa217]-[pa213 ] where this range is represented by the space between the two horizontal lines ) and @xmath111 increases .",
    "this happens because the energy functional tends to decrease its value through the negative values of the potential term .",
    "we believe that this can _ not _",
    "continue for @xmath87 very close to @xmath106 due to the fact that the range we described above , becomes so small , that @xmath41 tends to get everywhere a constant value ( the value @xmath112 , which makes the potential negative ) .",
    "but @xmath41 must be zero at @xmath81 and @xmath82 , thus there will be a considerable increase in the @xmath95 term of the functional , and that makes the benefits of the negative value of the potential to go away , while the trivial solution @xmath107 becomes energetically favorable .",
    "* @xmath102 : in that case , the potential term can no longer become negative",
    ". it can be either positive or zero and because of the fact that the energy functional is a sum of five positive terms , it s reasonable to prefer the zero value which , at the same time , minimizes all the terms of the functional .    from all the above , one can observe that the crucial difference between the above two cases of @xmath87 , is that in the @xmath27 case , the energy can have a minimum value ( through the potential term ) which corresponds to a non - trivial solution for @xmath41 .",
    "the existence of negative values of the potential are the `` way - through '' that make this possible .",
    "stable strings of the above @xmath0 model could be useful in order to create vortex rings and study their stability",
    ". it could also be relatively helpful numerically , as we would have four fields for minimization in the energy functional instead of five we had in @xcite .",
    "this is not as easy as it might seem , since there are two instability modes .",
    "the vortex itself is not necessarily stable while forming a torus , and the latter has the tendency to shrink due to its tension .",
    "the first instability can be avoided in a @xmath1 model as the one presented in @xcite , where a numerical search for bosonic superconducting static vortex rings in a @xmath113 model is done . there",
    ", the existence of straight strings is ensured for topological reasons .",
    "the superconductivity of the loop though , does not seem to prevent shrinking .",
    "the conclusion there is that current quenching takes place before stabilization .",
    "the model discussed in @xcite is being described by the lagrangian density @xmath114 where the covariant derivatives are @xmath115 , @xmath116 , the strength of the fields are @xmath9 , @xmath117 , while @xmath10 and @xmath118 stand as the relevant @xmath0 charges .",
    "the potential @xmath48 is @xmath119 the vacuum @xmath120 , @xmath15 , breaks @xmath121 , giving non - zero mass to @xmath122 .",
    "the photon field stays massless .",
    "there , @xmath123 .",
    "the vacuum manifold @xmath124 in this theory is a circle @xmath125 and the first homotopy group of @xmath124 is @xmath126 which signals the existence of strings . in regions where",
    "@xmath127 , the field @xmath24 is arranged to be non - vanishing and @xmath128 .",
    "thus , @xmath17 and electric current flows along regions with vanishing @xmath129 . hence , this theory has superconducting strings @xcite .",
    "the vacuum of the theory leaves unbroken the electromagnetic @xmath3 . for @xmath130",
    "this vacuum is stable , while @xmath131 ensures that it is the global minimum of the potential .",
    "the mass spectrum is @xmath132      we intend to modify the above model by adding higher derivative terms of the fields @xmath133 and @xmath5 and find out whether such changes can stabilize the ring . by following derrick",
    "s scaling argument @xcite , one can argue that terms such as @xmath134 or @xmath135 or @xmath136 could be helpful . also , in an investigation of a similar model @xcite , the conclusions lead to the same path , in order to search for possibilities of stabilizing such solitons against radial shrinking .",
    "thus , we have the following lagrangian density : @xmath137 where @xmath138 , @xmath139 , @xmath140 constants",
    ".    configurations with torus - like shape , representing a piece of a @xmath141 nielsen - olesen string , closed to form a loop , are of interest in this search .",
    "thus , we will require @xmath133 to vanish on a circle of radius @xmath84 ( the torus radius ) @xmath142 . at infinity ( @xmath143 )",
    ", we have the vacuum of the theory .",
    "this translates to @xmath144 , @xmath145 .",
    "the ansatz for the fields is : @xmath146 where @xmath32 , @xmath147 are the winding numbers of the relevant fields , @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 are the cylindrical unit vectors and the phase @xmath148 we use cylindrical coordinates @xmath149 , with space - time metric that has the form @xmath150=@xmath151 .",
    "we work in the @xmath152 gauge .",
    "we follow the ansatz of @xcite . a more general choice for @xmath133 would be @xmath153 where @xmath154 , an arbitrary function . but gauge invariance allows us to change @xmath155 , where @xmath156 an arbitrary space - dependent phase .",
    "we can choose @xmath157 thus , gauge fixing removes the arbitrary function @xmath158 .",

    "the conditions to be satisfied by the parameters become : @xmath162    the magnetic fields are @xmath163 while the currents associated with @xmath133 field , namely @xmath164 and @xmath165 and the total current @xmath166 out of these as well as the supercurrent @xmath167 associated with the @xmath5 field are @xmath168 where @xmath169    finally , in order to check our numerical results , we can derive virial relations .",

    "we define the index @xmath180 and we want its value to be as small as possible .",
    "we can produce many other virial relations by assuming generally for a field @xmath133 , the `` double '' rescaling @xmath181 and then demand @xmath182 .",
    "for example , we check our results through the following relations as well .",

    "in fact , these terms are proportional to @xmath192 and @xmath193 . thus , if one chooses @xmath194 , then there are more @xmath195-derivative terms in the functional .",
    "energy minimization lowers these terms , something which one expects to lead to a thicker string .",
    "this is a wanted feature in order to stabilize the ring .",
    "this would have another consequence .",
    "the extra `` @xmath195-terms '' , enforce the @xmath195 field to stay away from its vacuum expectation value within a larger area .",
    "this means that @xmath196 inside a larger area .",
    "there , the potential becomes @xmath197 and its value increases because of the term @xmath198 , as @xmath199 .",
    "minimization tends to make @xmath200 , which tries to compensate for that increase .",
    "the latter means that @xmath41 will increase and this is another wanted feature since the supercurrent @xmath201 .",
    "on the other hand , in ( [ funcu1 ] ) , the terms that come from the @xmath202 extra term , are multiplied with @xmath139 .",
    "in fact , these terms are proportional to @xmath105 and @xmath203 . thus , if one chooses @xmath204 , then the `` derivative '' terms of @xmath41 become more .",
    "the minimization of them is expected to decrease the charge condensate @xmath41 .",
    "this decrease is an unwanted feature .    finally , the terms that come from the @xmath205 term , are multiplied with @xmath140 .",
    "the consequences of the addition of this term can be seen if we observe that the extra terms are of the form @xmath206\\ ] ] where the dots represent the rest of the terms which are positive as well .",
    "we expect a stronger decrease of the charge condensate @xmath41 . this is because @xmath207 which means that @xmath208 .",
    "thus , the need for minimizing the derivative terms of @xmath41 becomes stronger than in the case of @xmath204 .",
    "apart from this , it is also the fact that , since @xmath209 , the weight of the @xmath41-derivative terms is now greater than unity and this is another factor which would tend to make @xmath80 or , at least , smaller than in the case @xmath204 .",
    "theoretically , the fact that the terms @xmath202 and @xmath205 tend to shrink the charge condensate @xmath41 , can also be seen from the virial relation @xmath210 above .",
    "the integral @xmath211 is negative ( because @xmath212 ) and the addition of extra terms leaves it unchanged . on the other hand",
    ", @xmath213 is a sum of positive terms and the above two extra derivative terms rise the value of @xmath213 .",
    "thus , the only way to satisfy that virial relation is either to increase @xmath214 and/or to decrease @xmath41 . if @xmath213 is big enough , then @xmath41 will be enforced to become zero in order to satisfy the @xmath210 relation .",
    "we use the same minimization algorithm , as in @xcite , to minimize the energy functional ( [ funcu1 ] ) .",
    "a 90@xmath21520 grid for every of the five functions is used , that is , 90 points on @xmath216-axis and 20 on @xmath43 .",
    "we begin with fixed torus radius @xmath84 .",
    "then , the configuration with minimum energy for this @xmath84 , is found .",
    "other values of @xmath84 are chosen as well and the same process goes on until we plot the energy vs. the torus radius @xmath217 .",
    "it would be very interesting to find a non - trivial minimum of the energy ( on @xmath218 ) , which would correspond to stable toroidal defects with radius @xmath219 .",
    "one crucial check of our results is done through virial relations .     on the @xmath220 plane.[ig ] ]    the initial guess ( fig.[ig ] ) we use for our computation is : @xmath221 this initial guess also satisfies the appropriate asymptotics    * near @xmath81 : @xmath222 * near @xmath223 : @xmath224 * at infinity : @xmath225    where @xmath226 .    based on @xcite ,",
    "we search in parameter areas where @xmath10 acquires relatively large values , but they are interesting as it concerns the possible stability of the loop .",

    "on the other hand , when the extra term is @xmath191 , then @xmath195 widens and this leads to the broadening of @xmath41 as well .",
    "the latter increases ( compare dashed and solid lines in fig.[extrafp ] ) and the supercurrent increases too ( dashed line in fig.[extraei ] ) . finally , when the extra term is @xmath205 , then @xmath107 for the values of @xmath214 we use . in general , the charge condensate can be non - trivial for higher @xmath214 .",
    "this happens due to the term @xmath236 of the potential .",
    "when @xmath214 grows , @xmath41 tends to reach @xmath237 .",
    "this is also numerically observed .",
    "= @xmath228 , dotted line for @xmath227=@xmath229 , dashed for @xmath227=@xmath230 while dashed and dotted for @xmath227=@xmath231 . for @xmath238=@xmath232 , the supercurrent as well as the charge condensate , are trivial .",
    "parameters in this figure are @xmath233=@xmath239.[extraei ] ]    one can combine two extra terms to see what happens . in example , we add both @xmath191 and @xmath202 , ( case @xmath227=@xmath231 in fig.[extrafp ] ) .",
    "this results to the addition of the `` favorable '' @xmath195-derivative terms , but also @xmath41-derivative terms would be present .",
    "this translates to the growth of @xmath41 but not as much as in the case @xmath227=@xmath230 .",
    "we also observed that the combination of either @xmath191 or @xmath202 or even both , with the @xmath205 term , leads to shrinking of @xmath41 because of the strong action of the last term .",
    "after the theoretical and numerical analysis , we conclude that the most `` interesting '' extra term is @xmath191 .",
    "it is clear that current quenching is present here as well ( fig.[extraei ] ) .",
    "the extra term @xmath191 , can increase the supercurrent and can make the penetration of the magnetic field more difficult , as the string increases its diameter , but this increase is not enough in order for the ring to stabilize . for the shake of research , we also tried higher values of @xmath138 in order to make the favorable term more significant .",
    "we also tried higher values of @xmath10 , but the ring could not be stabilized in a non - trivial radius .",
    "the most crucial terms of the energy functional which could provide for the stability of the ring in a non - zero radius @xmath84 , are : @xmath240 these two terms have an explicit total @xmath241 behavior which helps them to increase as the torus radius decreases .",
    "the problem is that they are not increasing at a satisfactory rate in order to overcome all the rest terms of the energy which are decreasing with @xmath216 .",
    "this is also numerically observed . under some radius @xmath84",
    ", the ideal would be to have a strongly increasing charge condensate @xmath41 .",
    "then , as the radius decreases and at the same time @xmath41 increases , the above two terms would start to increase with sufficient rate in order to lift the energy of the system .",
    "the magnetic term would increase because as @xmath242 increases , @xmath243 .",
    "the latter would make the derivatives of @xmath40 ( and @xmath244 as well ) to increase as @xmath216 decreases .",
    "this is what we tried to do here , especially with the help of the @xmath191 extra term .",
    "the charge condensate became more robust but that was not enough .",
    "this supports the conclusion of @xcite which states that very high values of supercurrent are needed for stabilization .",
    "it seems that such highly increasing currents can not be produced , despite the help of extra terms .",
    "in fact , numerical details reveal that the rate of increase of the terms @xmath245 above , is @xmath246 , while the rate of decrease of all the rest terms is @xmath247 .",
    "this means that the rate of increase of @xmath248 should be @xmath249 times bigger .",
    "that case would require @xmath250 which is something that can not satisfy @xmath210 virial relation .",
    "but even if that was possible , current quenching would be another `` obstacle '' .",
    "we studied a @xmath3 model with a gl potential with a cubic term added to it .",
    "after the numerical analysis we did , we came to the conclusion that for @xmath102 we find no non - trivial solution .",
    "for @xmath251 we get non - trivial solutions which have the profiles we present in figs.[pa217]-[pa213 ] . over @xmath252",
    "we have no non - trivial solutions .",
    "we analyse and explain our results in these cases .",
    "the form of the potential we have in this search , can be found in condensed matter physics as well . on the other hand",
    ", one could try to make a loop out of the straight string studied above .",
    "we did this , but it was difficult to study mainly due to the fact that there are two instability modes , one having to do with the defect itself and another which has to do with the loop that tends to shrink due to its tension .",
    "the former instability is excluded in @xcite for topological reasons .",
    "thus , we are based on the model of @xcite and analyze an extended version of it , by adding higher derivative terms in order to check whether they can stabilize the superconducting ring or not .",
    "although the @xmath191 term is helpful on that direction , it turns out to be insufficient and current quenching prevails .",
    "finally , we discuss what one would need for a stable ring .",
    "this discussion in combination with the results of @xcite , seems to exclude the possibility of existence of such vortex rings in this model .",
