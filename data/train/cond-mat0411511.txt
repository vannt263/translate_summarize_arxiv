    "the polariton physics in a strongly - coupled semiconductor microcavity includes interesting non - linear optical effects .",
    "when resonantly pumped with an off - axis laser , optical parametric oscillator ( opo ) behaviour can be obtained , with the spontaneous appearence of signal and idler emission@xcite .",
    "since the excitonic non - linearity is @xmath0 , the phase matching conditon requires @xmath1 and @xmath2 , which means that the pump , signal and idler can all be close to resonance with the polariton dispersion .",
    "this behaviour has been investigated theoretically by a number of authors , using analytic@xcite and numerical@xcite models . however , all these models differ from the experimental setup by assuming that the pump is a plane wave , with uniform excitation of the system , and uniform polariton fields .",
    "while such treatments provide useful insights into the opo , a fuller understanding of the observed behaviour requires a theory which takes into account the finite excitation spot used in experiments .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to describe a numerical treatment of a two dimensional microcavity polariton system pumped with a gaussian beam , solved in the time domain on a discrete spatial grid .",
    "the model for the opo is based on the non - linear optics treatment of ref.@xcite .",
    "it consists of coupled two - dimensional cavity and exciton fields , @xmath3 and @xmath4 , with a local @xmath0 non - linearity in the exciton to represent the effects of short - range interaction .",
    "both fields have dispersions , described by effective masses @xmath5 and @xmath6 , and are damped with widths @xmath7 and @xmath8",
    ". the coupling is characterised by @xmath9 , the rabi splitting , and @xmath10 , the detuning at normal incidence .",
    "the cavity field is driven by a spatially dependent external pump field @xmath11 .",
    "the time evolution of the fields is thus determined by @xmath12    to be exact , the form for the @xmath0 nonlinearity should be @xmath13 . however , for a numerical treatment",
    ", it is better to chose @xmath14 , as this is independent of the origin of energy , which can thus be shifted to the exciton frequency .",
    "the modified form correctly gives the scattering effects of interest here , but does not describe frequency multiplying effects , which would require extremely small time - steps in the numerics .    for the numerical treatment ,",
    "this model is discretized on a two dimensional grid , with the differential operators are replaced by hopping terms .",
    "the solution is obtained in the time domain , as an initial value problem , using the crank - nicholson method@xcite .",
    "this leads to a semi - implicit time - step formula of the form @xmath15 where the vector @xmath16 describes the cavity photon and exciton amplitudes on the site @xmath17 at time - step @xmath18 .",
    "the precise form of the matrix operator @xmath19 will be specified below .",
    "the problem with solving eq.([eq : crank ] ) in two dimensions is that @xmath19 is a large matrix ( size @xmath20 , where n is the length of the edge of the grid ) , whose structure does not lend itself to efficient numerical solution : there are non - zero terms far from the diagonals .",
    "it is better to use an operator - splitting treatment , the alternating direction implicit method@xcite , writing @xmath21 , where @xmath22 and @xmath23 respectively contain only @xmath24 and @xmath25 hopping terms .",
    "then , each time - step is divided into two sub - steps : first , @xmath26 is solved for every @xmath27 , then @xmath28 for every @xmath29 .",
    "each of these one dimensional strip problems is independent , so it is necessary to solve only @xmath30 @xmath31 sets of equations .",
    "moreover the matrices @xmath22 and @xmath23 contain non - zero terms only on the diagonal and first three sub - diagonals , which permits a very efficient solution by factorisation@xcite .    the part of @xmath22 involving coupling to site @xmath29 is @xmath32 where each @xmath19 is a @xmath33 matrix : @xmath34 the hopping terms are @xmath35 and @xmath36 , with @xmath37 the @xmath24-direction grid spacing .",
    "the value of @xmath4 used in the non - linear term is the old value at that site , ie from the right hand side of eq.([eq : xup ] ) or eq.([eq : yup ] ) .",
    "@xmath23 has a similar form , except @xmath38 replaces @xmath37 , though in practice an isotropic grid is used .",
    "the factors of @xmath39 multiplying @xmath40 are needed to avoid over - counting , because they occur in both @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "eq.([eq : xup ] ) , and similarly eq.([eq : yup ] ) , is most efficently solved in two stages : first an intermediate variable @xmath41 is calculated using @xmath42 then it is straightforward to show that @xmath43 .    to incorporate periodic boundary conditions , eq.([eq : strip ] ) has to be modified by adding hopping terms in the off - diagonal corners of the matrix , coupling the sites at either end of a strip : @xmath44    adding these terms breaks the useful diagonal form of the matrix , so a direct solution of eq.([eq : periodic ] ) would be inefficient .",
    "however , as there are just four extra non - zero entries , the problem can be handled at little numerical cost using the woodbury formula@xcite to incorporate the extra terms .",
    "@xmath45 is written as @xmath46 where the @xmath47 and @xmath48 are chosen to generate the end hopping terms .",
    "an efficent choice is @xmath49 where @xmath50 and @xmath51 are the first two elements along the main diagonal of @xmath22 .",
    "@xmath52 is a slightly modified version of @xmath22 : the @xmath53 terms produce , as well as the required hopping terms , four additional elements along the main diagonal which have to be subtracted from @xmath22 to obtain the correct @xmath45 .",
    "evaluating the woodbury formula requires additional solutions of eq.([eq : trick ] ) with @xmath54 and @xmath55 on the right hand side , but this is very inexpensive once the factorisation of @xmath52 is obtained . hence adding periodic boundary conditions makes little difference to the numerical costs .",
    "the results described in this section are for a microcavity with physical parameters typical of a good gaas structure : the rabi splitting , @xmath56 mev , and the line - widths of the exciton and cavity mode are @xmath57 mev .",
    "the structure is on - resonance at normal incidence ( @xmath58 ) , and pumped at 16@xmath59 with a gaussian beam whose fwhm is 17.05@xmath60 m .",
    "the cavity mode effective mass is taken to be @xmath61 , and the exciton mass @xmath62 .",
    "the spatial grid consists of @xmath63 points with a separation of 0.4@xmath60 m , and the time step is 12 fs .",
    "the calculation is started with the fields set to zero , and the solution is then propagated until a steady state is reached , typically after about @xmath64 time steps or @xmath65 ps .",
    "the pump , signal and idler are then separated by storing the data for a series of time steps , fourier transforming to the frequency domain , and applying band - pass filters .",
    "this process can be carried out in a continuous way using a rolling time window , which allows the observation of dynamical effects occuring on time - scales slow compared to the inverse of the mode separation .",
    "the calculated images show the spatial dependence of the steady - state cavity field intensities in the signal and idler modes at various pump powers . it should be noted that they represent the internal cavity field , which can not be directly observed experimentally .",
    "the emitted light will undergo some additional spatial filtering due to the small @xmath66-width of the polariton branches .    with various powers .",
    "( a ) and ( e ) are the signal and idler intensities for a peak power of 0.2 , just above threshold .",
    "the following rows represent pump powers of 0.3 , 0.4 and 0.5 , with the signal states on the left , the idlers on the right .",
    "the lengths of the edges of the squares are 51.2@xmath60 m , and the fwhm of the pump beam is 17.05@xmath60 m . ]",
    "fig.1 shows the calculated signal and idler images for the steady state at various pump powers above threshold .",
    "close to threshold , ( a ) and ( e ) , only a small spot near to the centre of the image is bright .",
    "this is easily understood : for a gaussian beam profile , the threshold will be reached first where the pump is strongest . at higher pump powers , the emission spot expands , but , instead of the centre becoming brighter , the spot turns into a ring with low intensity in the middle .",
    "it can be explained qualitatively using an analytic plane - wave model where the contributions of the signal and idler to the polariton blue - shifts are taken into account@xcite .",
    "the shifts cause the opo to switch off above a certain power , which depends on the incidence angle and detuning of the pump beam .",
    "this happens first at the centre of the spot , leading to the dark middle . in a gaussian beam",
    ", there will always be a region where the pump power is the range to allow the opo , so an expanding emission ring should be expected as the power is increased above threshold .",
    "of course , the strong spatial dispersion of the polariton means that a such a simple picture , relating the opo intensity to the local value of the pump , is not completely accurate , but it seems to give a reasonable guide .",
    "the dispersion effects are responsible for the fact that the ring is not perfectly symmetrical , and breaks up significantly at higher pump powers",
    ". however , a bilateral symmetry is always mainatined , defined by the incidence plane , which cuts the figure along the @xmath24-axis .",
    "finally , at higher powers than those shown in the fig.1 , the numerics predict that a steady state may not be reached .",
    "instead , the signal and idler undergo a periodic oscillation , maintaining the general ring shape , but with the maximum intensity moving from side to side .",
    "it has been shown that a full understanding of the microcavity opo requires a two - dimensional treatment of the spatial structure of the pump beam and the polariton fields .",
    "a numerical model describing the spatial and temporal evolution of the system has been derived , and used to predict that the emission spot should form a ring at high pump powers .",
    "these results demonstrate that experimental measurements without spatial resolution provide only a limited picture of the opo behaviour .",
