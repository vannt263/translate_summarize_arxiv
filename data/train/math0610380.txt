    "in this article , we will investigate the geometry of compactified type ii supergravity theories by taking a @xmath1structure point of view .",
    "roughly speaking , a @xmath1structure , for a given lie group @xmath1 , encodes the algebraic datum of a vector bundle  the group is determined by looking at the symmetry group of a fibre inside its general linear group .",
    "for instance , a riemannian metric and an orientation on the tangent bundle ( i.e. an oriented riemannian manifold @xmath5 ) is equivalent to an @xmath6structure : each tangent space defines an oriented euclidean vector space @xmath7 whose symmetry group inside @xmath8 ( i.e. the stabiliser under the @xmath9action ) is @xmath10 .",
    "the basic @xmath1structure on @xmath11 underlying the subsequent development is an @xmath12structure induced by an oriented vector bundle which carries a bundle metric of (  split \" ) signature @xmath13 .    in a way ,",
    "a @xmath1structure is a device of putting a given  flat \" model , i.e. a vector space for which an orientation , a metric or a complex structure etc . have been chosen , onto a manifold , where this datum varies smoothly from point to point .",
    "regarding a vector space as a manifold , this datum is constant in the sense that the local coefficients with respect to the natural coordinate system are constant . in general",
    "however , we get non  trivial coefficients and the defect to be constant is measured by _",
    "integrability conditions_. for instance , on a riemannian manifold @xmath14 there exists a coordinate system @xmath15 such that @xmath16 , if and only if the metric is flat , that is , the riemannian curvature tensor vanishes .",
    "the idea of a @xmath1structure approach to physical problems is then to interpret the _ field content _ , defined in physical space , for instance a gravitational field in general relativity , as the algebraic datum associated with a @xmath1structure over some manifold , in this case a metric of signature @xmath17 .",
    "the _ field equations _ , like vanishing ricci tensor , are regarded as an integrability condition on the @xmath1structure defined by the field content .",
    "this often simplifies the problem of finding solutions to the field equations dramatically , as representation theoretic arguments can be invoked to boil down the problem to mere linear algebra .",
    "we will illustrate this point and also recapitulate some general elements of vector bundle and representation theory as we go along .    before this , let us briefly introduce the mathematical content of the physical theory we propose to discuss . neglecting the so ",
    "called _ ramond  ramond fields _ for the moment , the algebraic datum consists of a spinnable metric @xmath18 , a closed integral 3form @xmath19 ( the _ h  flux _ ) , a scalar function @xmath20 ( the _ dilaton field _ ) and two unit spinor fields @xmath21 ( the _ supersymmetry parameters _ )  we review spinors in some detail in section  [ spinstruc ] . in order to preserve two global supersymmetries ( whence  type ii \" ) , this datum is supposed to satisfy the following two supersymmetry equations .",
    "firstly , there is the _ gravitino equation _",
    "@xmath22 where @xmath23 denotes the levi  civita connection of the metric and @xmath24 the @xmath25form obtained from @xmath19 by contraction ( inner product ) with the vector field @xmath26 .",
    "secondly , the _ dilatino equation _",
    "@xmath27 is supposed to hold .",
    "this situation is akin to so  called _ heterotic _",
    "supergravity which has one global supersymmetry and is defined ( in absence of additional gauge fields ) by the gravitino and the dilatino equation on @xmath28 alone . here , @xmath1structure techniques , where @xmath29 is the stabiliser of a unit spinor , could be successfully applied to the construction of solutions ( cf . for instance  @xcite , where the authors exploit the @xmath30structure associated with a unit spinor in dimension @xmath31 ) .",
    "similar attempts have been made for type ii supergravity ( see the review  @xcite ) , but these turned out to be too restrictive . in a nutshell ,",
    "the problem stems from the fact that if the pair @xmath32 is invariant under some @xmath29 , so is their common angle . from a physics point of view",
    ", however , the spinors @xmath28 and @xmath33 are independent , so the  classical \" @xmath1structure ansatz coming from heterotic theory can only capture fairly particular cases . rather , we should consider two independent @xmath1structures associated with @xmath28 and @xmath33 simultaneously ( for instance , two @xmath30structures if we deal with dimension @xmath31 ) .    in  @xcite and  @xcite",
    ", it was noticed that the geometry of the supersymmetry equations  ( [ susyeq1 ] ) and  ( [ susyeq2 ] ) is captured by a so  called _ generalised geometry _ , a notion going back to the seminal article  @xcite of hitchin . in mathematics , these structures naturally arose in connection with moduli spaces of geometric structures occurring in physics , where some points in the moduli space corresponded to _",
    "@xmath34field transformations _ of some well  known `` classical '' structure ( cf . also  @xcite ) .",
    "let us start by explaining what we understand by `` classical '' as opposed to `` generalised '' structures .",
    "classically , any geometric structure on the tangent bundle can be transformed by diffeomorphisms .",
    "for instance , if @xmath35 is a diffeomorphism and if @xmath18 defines a positive definite bundle metric on @xmath36 , so does the pulled ",
    "back tensor @xmath37 , that is both @xmath14 and @xmath38 are riemannian manifolds . in string theory",
    ", physicists are also used to transform geometric structures with @xmath34fields , that is , @xmath25forms on @xmath39 .",
    "we thus want to pass from the natural transformation group @xmath40 acting on @xmath36 to the larger transformation group @xmath41 .",
    "how can this action of @xmath25forms be implemented ? considering @xmath34 as a map from @xmath42 , we define @xmath43 on sections @xmath44 of @xmath45 by @xmath46 we will show in the sequel that this transformation can be indeed regarded as an exponential map as suggested by the notation . on the other hand , diffeomorphisms act on @xmath45 in the usual way .",
    "the @xmath34field transform of a `` classical '' geometry is then obtained by first extending the classical geometry from @xmath36 to @xmath45 in some suitable sense , and then by applying a @xmath34field transformation . for instance",
    ", a riemannian metric @xmath18 on @xmath36 induces a map @xmath47 ( where the matrix is taken with respect to the splitting @xmath45 and we consider @xmath18 as a map from @xmath42 ) .",
    "applying a @xmath34field transformation gives the @xmath34field transformed riemannian metric @xmath48 an expression familiar to physicists ( cf .",
    "we refer to @xmath49 as a _ generalised riemannian metric_. the `` embedded '' case of @xmath50 where @xmath51 is referred to as a _",
    "straight _ generalised riemannian metric .    the geometric structure of type ii supergravity compactifications in dimension @xmath31 involves @xmath34field transformed @xmath30structures , whose basic setup we describe next .",
    "the `` doubled '' bundle @xmath45 carries a natural orientation and an inner product of split signature , namely contraction .",
    "therefore , @xmath45 is associated with an @xmath12structure which is always spinnable , so we can consider @xmath45spinor fields .",
    "these can be regarded , modulo a scalar function , as differential forms of even or odd parity on @xmath39 . a well  known procedure in spin geometry associates with the bitensor",
    "@xmath52 a differential form @xmath53 $ ] . in the setup of type ii supergravity",
    "compactified to dimension @xmath31 , where the two unit spinors @xmath28 and @xmath33 induce an @xmath30structure each , one can show this form , being thought of as an @xmath45spinor , to be invariant under @xmath54 at every point .",
    "the datum @xmath55 induces therefore an @xmath56 or _",
    "generalised @xmath30_structure on @xmath45 .",
    "this class of structures comprises the @xmath34field transformation of `` classical '' @xmath30structures defined by @xmath57 .",

    "the implementation of the @xmath19flux @xmath19 requires one further idea , namely the concept of a _ generalised tangent bundle _",
    "@xmath63  @xcite ,  @xcite .",
    "since @xmath19 is closed , we can locally write @xmath64 for @xmath65 . on intersections @xmath66",
    ", we can twist the transition functions of @xmath45 with @xmath67 which results in new transition functions inducing @xmath63 .",
    "if @xmath19 is integral this means that we are twisting with a _ gerbe_.",
    "the field content on @xmath68 , that is @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath28 and @xmath33 , therefore induces a generalised @xmath30structure on @xmath63 .",
    "moreover , the supersymmetry equations  ( [ susyeq1 ] ) and  ( [ susyeq2 ] ) are equivalent to @xmath69=0,\\quad d_he^{-\\phi}[{\\mathcal}{a}(\\psi_l)\\otimes\\psi_r]=0,\\ ] ] where @xmath4 is the _ twisted differential _ and @xmath70 the _ charge conjugation operator_. this is a natural integrability condition on the generalised @xmath30structure which links the supersymmetry equations to hitchin s generalised variational principle  @xcite ,  @xcite ,  @xcite .",
    "en passant , we observe that this formalism is perfectly general and works for all classical @xmath1structures defined by a spinor .",
    "the spinorial formulation of integrability can be used to compute the ricci and the scalar curvature of the metric , namely @xmath71 where @xmath72 denotes the hessian of the dilaton field , and @xmath73 the laplacian of the metric . moreover ,",
    "this description gives rise to two striking no  go theorems in the vein of similar statements from  @xcite and  @xcite .",
    "firstly , integrability implies @xmath74 if @xmath39 is compact .",
    "this means that both spinors @xmath21 are parallel with respect to the levi  civita connection , and so the holonomy reduces to the intersection of the two @xmath1structures associated with @xmath21 ( this situation belongs indeed to the realm of classical @xmath1structures , for the spinors are either parallel or may be assumed to be orthogonal by parallelity ) .",
    "hence , there are no interesting generalised geometries satisfying  ( [ formint ] ) for @xmath39 compact . secondly , and independently of compactness , @xmath74 if and only if @xmath75 , so in order to obtain non  parallel solutions to  ( [ susyeq1 ] ) and  ( [ susyeq2 ] ) , we need indeed a non  trivial dilaton field . the construction of solutions with non ",

    "in this section we first recall the basic features of @xmath1structure theory and spin geometry as far as we need it here .",
