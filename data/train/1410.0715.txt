    "the connection @xmath12 commutes with the boundary map and thus descends to a connection on the @xmath11-linear periodic cyclic homology @xmath13 .",
    "the fundamental issue for us is to determine when we can parallel tranport with respect to @xmath12 at the level of periodic cyclic homology . indeed , doing so would provide isomorphisms @xmath14 between the periodic cyclic homology groups of any two algebras in the deformation .",
    "this can be used as a computational device if one already knows the cyclic homology of one particular algebra @xmath15 in the deformation .",
