    "there are currently several exciting proposals to use the ( 001 ) surface of silicon for the construction of atomic - scale electronic devices , including single electron transistors  @xcite , ultra - dense memories  @xcite and quantum computers  @xcite .",
    "however , since any random charge or spin defects in the vicinity of these devices could potentially destroy their operation , a thorough understanding of the nature of crystalline defects on this surface is essential .",
    "the si(001 ) surface was first observed in real space at atomic resolution using scanning tunneling microscopy ( stm ) by tromp _ _ et .",
    "al.__@xcite in 1985 . in this study",
    "they observed the surface consisted of rows of `` bean - shaped '' protrusions which were interpreted as tunneling from the @xmath1-bonds of surface si dimers , thereby establishing the dimer model as the correct model for this surface . since then , stm has been instrumental in further elucidating the characteristics of this surface , and in particular atomic - scale defects present on the surface@xcite .",
    "the simplest defect of the si(001 ) surface is the single dimer vacancy defect ( 1-dv ) , shown schematically in figs .  [ def1](a ) and [ def1](b ) .",
    "this defect consists of the absence of a single dimer from the surface and can either expose four second - layer atoms ( fig .",
    "[ def1](a ) ) or form a more stable structure where rebonding of the second - layer atoms occurs  @xcite as shown in fig .",
    "[ def1](b ) . while the rebonded 1-dv strains the bonds of its neighboring dimers it also results in a lowering of the number of surface dangling bonds and has been found to be more stable than the nonbonded structure .",
    "@xcite single dimer vacancy defects can also cluster to form larger defects such as the double dimer vacancy defect ( 2-dv ) and the triple dimer vacancy defect ( 3-dv ) .",
    "more complex clusters also form , the most commonly observed@xcite example is the 1 + 2-dv consisting of a 1-dv and a 2-dv separated by a single surface dimer , the so - called `` split - off dimer '' . the accepted structure of the 1 + 2-dv , as proposed by wang _ et .",
    "based on total energy calculations,@xcite is shown in fig .",
    "[ def1](c ) and consists of a rebonded 1-dv ( left ) , a split - off dimer , and a 2-dv with a rebonding atom ( right ) .",
    "recently we have observed another dv complex that contains a split - off dimer , called the 1 + 1-dv , which consists of a rebonded 1-dv and a nonbonded 1-dv separated by a split - off dimer , as shown in fig .",
    "[ def1](d ) .        here",
    "we present a detailed investigation of dv defect complexes that contain split - off dimers . using high - resolution , low - bias stm we observe that split - off dimers appear",
    "as well - resolved pairs of protrusions under imaging conditions where normal si dimers appear as single `` bean - shaped '' protrusions .",
    "we show that this difference arises from an absence of the expected @xmath1-bonding between the two atoms of the split - off dimer but instead the formation of @xmath1-bonds between the split - off dimer atoms and second layer atoms .",
    "electron charge density plots obtained using first principles calculations support this interpretation .",
    "we observe an intensity enhancement surrounding some split - off dimer defect complexes in our stm images and thereby discuss the local strain induced in the formation of these defects . finally , we present a model for a previously unreported triangular - shaped split - off dimer defect complex that exists at s@xmath2-type step edges .",
    "experiments were performed in two separate but identical variable temperature stm systems ( omicron vt - stm ) .",
    "the base pressure of the ultra - high vacuum ( uhv ) chamber was @xmath3 mbar .",
    "phosphorus doped @xmath4 and @xmath5 @xmath6 wafers , orientated towards the [ 001 ] direction were used .",
    "these wafers were cleaved into @xmath7 mm@xmath8 sized samples , mounted in sample holders , and then transferred into the uhv chamber .",
    "wafers and samples were handled using ceramic tweezers and mounted in tantalum / molybdenum / ceramic sample holders to avoid contamination from metals such as ni and w. sample preparation@xcite was performed in vacuum without prior _ ex - situ _",
    "treatment by outgassing overnight at 850  k using a resistive heater element , followed by flashing to 1400  k by passing a direct current through the sample . after flashing",
    ", the samples were cooled slowly ( @xmath9  k / s ) from 1150  k to room temperature .",
    "the sample preparation procedure outlined above routinely produced samples with very low surface defect densities .",
    "however , the density of defects , including split - off dimer defects , was found to increase over time with repeated sample preparation and stm imaging , as reported previously.@xcite it is known that split - off dimer defects are induced on the si(001 ) surface by the presence of metal contamination such as ni ,  @xcite and w  @xcite .",
    "the appearance of these defects in our samples therefore points to a build up of metal contamination , either ni from in - vacuum stainless steel parts , or more likely w contamination from the stm tip . after using an old w stm tip to scratch a @xmath10  1  mm line on a si(001 ) sample in vacuum and then reflashing ,",
    "the concentration of split - off dimer defects on the surface was found to have dramatically increased , confirming the stm tip as the source of the metal contamination .",
    "figure  [ sods ] shows an stm image of a si(001 ) surface containing a @xmath10  10% coverage of split - off dimer defects .",
    "the majority of the defects in this image can be identified as 1 + 2-dvs , however , two 1 + 1-dvs are also present , as indicated .",
    "the most striking feature of this image is the difference in appearance of the split - off dimers in contrast to the surrounding normal surface dimers .",
    "each split - off dimer in this image appears as a double - lobed protrusion , while the surrounding normal si dimers each appear as a single `` bean - shaped '' protrusion , as expected at this tunneling bias .",

    "the line profile parallel to the dimer row direction agrees with previously reported profiles over 1 + 2-dvs and fits well with the accepted structure ,  @xcite as shown by the overlayed ball and stick model . the line profile taken perpendicular to the dimer row direction",
    ", however , clearly shows that the split - off dimer of this defect is separated into two protrusions while the neighboring si dimers are single protrusions .",

    "[ def1](c ) and [ def1](d ) .",
    "normally si(001 ) surface dimers appear as `` bean - shaped '' protrusions in stm images because the dangling bonds of each si dimer atom mix to form a @xmath1-bond between the two dimer atoms",
    ". however , if we examine the split - off dimer structure closely ( figs .",
    "[ def1](c ) and [ def1](d ) ) we see that unlike normal surface dimers , the split - off dimer has two nearest neighbor second layer atoms that each have a dangling bond .",
    "the separation distance between the split - off dimer atoms and these second layer atoms is sufficiently close to allow the formation of @xmath1-bonds .",
    "the resulting four - atom structure can therefore be referred to as a _",
    "tetramer_. we propose that the four dangling bonds of the split - off dimer tetramer interact primarily along the backbonds between the split - off dimer atoms and the second layer atoms to form @xmath1-bonds down the backbonds , as drawn schematically in fig .",
    "[ sods](c ) .",
    "these two spatially separated @xmath1-bonds therefore lead to the double - lobed appearance of the split - off dimers under low bias filled - state tunneling conditions , which we confirm in section  [ theory1 ] with charge density calculations .    in an attempt to fully characterize the appearance of these split - off dimers in stm images ,",
    "we have performed a series of experiments observing split - off dimers with changing stm sample bias .",
    "figure  [ sodv ] summarizes our results , showing images where a 1 + 2-dv and a 1 + 1-dv located next to each other are observed at four different sample biases  two filled - state images and two empty - state images . in the filled - state image of fig .",
    "[ sodv](a ) we see that at @xmath13  v the split - off dimer of both the 1 + 2-dv and the 1 + 1-dv appear as double - lobed protrusions similar to those in fig .",
    "[ sods](a ) .",
    "however , when the filled - state bias is increased in magnitude to @xmath14  v , fig .",
    "[ sodv](b ) , the split - off dimers become single - protrusions and appear very similar to the surrounding normal si surface dimers .",
    "this is because as the bias magnitude is increased towards @xmath14  v , the dimer @xmath15-bond and bulk states contribute increasingly to the tunneling current  @xcite and the image of the split - off dimer reverts to the bean - shaped protrusion in the same manner as normal surface si dimers . in both of the empty - state images , figs .",
    "[ sodv](c ) and [ sodv](d ) , acquired at + 0.8  v and + 2  v , respectively , the appearance of the split - off dimers is very similar to that of the surrounding normal surface dimers .",
    "this is because under empty - state tunneling conditions electrons tunnel into the @xmath16-antibonding orbitals of the dimers , resulting in the normal si dimers appearing as double - lobed protrusions .",
    "@xcite it is therefore only under low bias magnitude filled - state tunneling conditions that split - off dimers appear significantly different to the surrounding normal si surface dimers .",

    "this is a reproducible effect that we attribute to an increased amount of surface strain induced by the 1 + 1-dv .",
    "figure  [ strain ] shows a series of adjacent defects forming a short vacancy line channel in the surface .",
    "this channel is composed of individual 1-dv , 3-dv , 1 + 2-dv , and 1 + 1-dv defects ( see figure caption ) . in the filled - state image , fig .",
    "[ strain](a ) , there is a clear brightening of the dimers on one end of the 1 + 1-dvs and the dimers on both ends of the 1-dv , which is not present for the 1 + 2-dvs . in the empty - state image of the line of defect complexes , fig .",

    "note the strain - induced brightening of the 1-dv and 1 + 1-dvs in the filled - state ( a ) and the corresponding darkening in the empty - state ( b ) ]    owen _ et .",
    "_ ,  @xcite have shown using low bias stm and first principles calculations , that the dimers neighboring a rebonded 1-dv are enhanced in low bias filled - state stm images due to the strain induced by the defect shifting the surface states upwards in energy toward the fermi energy .",
    "this effect can be seen for the 1-dv in fig .",
    "[ strain](a ) , where the neighboring dimers in the same row as the 1-dv are enhanced in intensity , with the magnitude of the enhancement decaying with distance from the 1-dv .",
    "a very similar enhancement can be seen around the 1 + 1-dv sites in this image , with the split - off dimer in particular appearing much brighter than the surrounding normal surface dimers .",
    "however , for the 1 + 1-dv only the dimers on one end of the defect are enhanced in intensity while the dimers on the other end of the defect are not .",
    "this observation can be readily explained since the 1 + 1-dv is composed of a rebonded 1-dv adjacent to a nonbonded 1-dv ( fig .  [ def1](d ) ) and owen  _ et .",
    "@xcite have shown that while the rebonded 1-dv results in strain - induced image enhancement , the nonbonded 1-dv does not .",
    "the observation of an asymmetric strain - induced enhancement of the 1 + 1-dv in fig .",
    "[ strain](a ) can therefore be taken as an experimental confirmation of the structure of this defect ( fig .",
    "[ def1](d ) ) and the first application of the method of owen  _ et .",
    "@xcite for identifying strain in more complex surface defect structures .",
    "the fact that the 1 + 2-dv causes no enhancement of its neighboring dimers over the surrounding normal surface dimers suggests that the 1 + 2-dv , unlike the 1-dv and 1 + 1-dvs , does not increase the strain of the surface .",
    "this at first seems strange , since the 1 + 2-dv involves a rebonded 1-dv similar to the 1 + 1-dv structure",
    ". however , wang _ et .",
    "_  @xcite have shown , using total energy calculations , that the junction formed between the 1-dv and the 2-dv to create the 1 + 2-dv releases the surface strain that is present when these two defects exist separately from one another .",
    "the stm data that we have presented here is therefore the first experimental verification of this calculation .",
    "the fact that both the 1-dv and the 1 + 1-dv show local enhancement due to strain , while the 1 + 2-dv does not , indicates that the 1 + 2-dv structure induces less local strain than the 1-dv .",
    "in their paper , owen _ et .",
    "do not present empty state stm images , nor do they consider empty states in their tight binding calculations . in fig .",
    "[ strain](b ) , we show an empty state image of the same line of defects shown in fig .",
    "[ strain](a ) . interestingly , in this empty state image the dimers that were enhanced in brightness surrounding the 1-dv and 1 + 1-dvs in the filled - state image are less bright than the surrounding si dimers in the empty - state image .",
    "this suggests that the strain associated with these defects causes the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital ( lumo ) of the adjacent dimers to also shift higher in energy , away from the fermi energy .",
    "to confirm the interpretation of our stm images , we have performed first principles electronic structure calculations of both the 1 + 2-dv and 1 + 1-dv complexes using the car - parrinello molecular dynamics program .",
    "@xcite valence electrons were described using goedecker pseudopotentials  @xcite expanded in a basis set of plane waves with an energy cutoff of 18 rydbergs and the exchange - correlation functional was of the blyp form .",

    "a reference calculation was performed with no surface vacancies and assuming the @xmath23 structure in which the dimers buckled alternately along the row .",
    "a single 256 atom calculation with a duplication along the y - axis confirmed that the effect of dispersion across the rows is minor as has been noted elsewhere .",
    "@xcite    both zero temperature geometry optimization and high temperature molecular dynamics calculations were used to explore a variety of surface and second - layer bonding configurations for the 1 + 2-dv and 1 + 1-dv .",

    "@xcite our calculations show that the split - off dimer tetramer also has two symmetrically equivalent buckling configurations , with charge transfer between the atoms of the tetramer buckling adjacent atoms in alternate directions . by analogy with the normal dimers we can expect room - temperature stm measurements of the tetramer to image the average of the two configurations .",
    "the chemical potential was determined from a 512-atom bulk calculation , which yielded a formation energy of 0.85  ev for the 1 + 2-dv , similar to the value of 0.65  ev computed by wang _ at .",
