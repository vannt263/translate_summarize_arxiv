    "suppose that we have two qubits @xmath2 and @xmath3 in arbitrary pure states @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "when we want to produce entangled states of the form similar to the one discussed in the introduction ( i.e. symmetric or anti - symmetric states ) , by passing these qubits from a quantum machine @xmath8 , it is rather natural to think that an obstacle is that at the output the two parts are entangled with the machine itself in the form @xmath26 where @xmath27 and @xmath28 are states of the machine .",
    "it is easy to see that such an operation is linear and unitary provided that the machine states be two fixed input - independent states satisfying the following relations @xmath29 a convenient parametrization of these inner products is @xmath30 where @xmath31 and @xmath32 are real parameters .",
    "we now ask under what condition , the output density matrix @xmath13 of the two systems @xmath2 and @xmath33 has the maximum value of entanglement . + for two qubits in a mixed state @xmath34 , we have a well established measure of entanglement given by a closed formula .",
    "it has been introduced by wootters and hill in @xcite and is directly related to the entanglement of formation of such a mixed state .",
    "it is called concurrence and is denoted by @xmath35 and is given by @xmath36 where @xmath37 to @xmath38 are the eigenvalues of the following matrix in decreasing order : @xmath39 here @xmath40 @xmath41 is the second pauli matrix and @xmath42 is the complex conjugate of @xmath43 in the computational basis .",
    "equivalently @xmath44 s can be taken to be the square root of eigenvalues of the matrix @xmath45 . + here and in what follows we designate the density matrix of the two qubits simply by @xmath46 instead of @xmath47 . for the calculation of eigenvalues we can take without loss of generality ,",
    "@xmath48 and @xmath49 from which we obtain @xmath50 by taking the trace of @xmath51 over the machine states .",
    "the result is @xmath52 where we have used the relations in ( [ 2 ] ) .",
    "+ using ( [ r1 ] ) we obtain @xmath53    finally the matrix @xmath45 is found to be    @xmath54    where @xmath55 .",
    "the eigenvalues of this matrix are easily determined , it has obviously two zero eigenvalues , the other two being the eigenvalues of the central 2 by 2 sub - matrix . the square root of its eigenvalues which are the eigenvalues of the matrix @xmath56 are in decreasing order @xmath57 where in taking the square roots we have used the chauchy schwartz inequality for the inner products in ( [ 3 ] ) which implies that @xmath58 .",
    "+ putting all this together with equation ( [ 4 ] ) , leads to the following value for the concurrence    @xmath59    to obtain maximum concurrence we have to take @xmath60 which according to the cauchy schwartz inequality forces us to choose @xmath61 .",
    "this then means that the vectors @xmath27 and @xmath62 are the same modulo a crucial phase , that is @xmath63 where @xmath64 is a normalized state .",
    "interestingly the output state now turns out to be disentangled from the machine , so that the machine produces a pure entangled state : @xmath65 having determined the optimal choice of @xmath66 by taking the state @xmath9 in the basis state @xmath67 , we can now calculate the concurrence produced for any two arbitrary input states .",
    "since the output state is pure , its concurrence can be calculated from an alternative formula for any two input pure states @xmath68 where we have abbreviated @xmath69 to @xmath70 and @xmath71 inserting this in ( [ 12 ] ) and using the fact that for every qubit state @xmath19 , @xmath72 , we obtain @xmath73 if the two initial states are two spin states in definite directions on the bloch sphere , that is if @xmath74 and @xmath75 the details of this calculation is given in the appendix .",
    "the average of this concurrence over all input states is @xmath76 .",
    "thus this transformation produces on the average , an entanglement which as measured by concurrence is @xmath77 .",
    "equation ( [ 15 ] ) also shows that maximal entanglement is produced by intertwining two anti - parallel spin states on the bloch sphere . + up to now we have shown the possibility of the desirable entangling transformation . in view of ( [ 11 ] ) the actual form of the transformation is given by @xmath78 where @xmath79 is the permutation operator ( i.e. @xmath80 ) which for two dimensional spaces is related to the pauli matrices as @xmath81 . the above argument and the combination of the last two formulas",
    "also tell us how to produce states with a definite amount of entanglement or concurrence , when we have partial information about the input states .",
    "let us fix the spin state @xmath82 in the direction @xmath83 .",
    "we then need only take a spin state @xmath84 with the @xmath83 axis ( this still leaves the angle @xmath85 undetermined ) and apply the spin spin interaction ( [ 5 ] ) to produce a concurrence of @xmath86 . in this way by just adjusting the initial value of @xmath87 we can produce entangled states with any desired value of entanglement , ranging from the minimum value of @xmath88 for @xmath89 to the maximum value of @xmath90 for @xmath91 .",
    "+ moreover the output density matrix also retain some information about the input states , since it is easily verified from ( [ 11 ] ) that @xmath92 with an identical formula for @xmath93 .",
    "thus the fidelity of reduced one particle density matrices of the output with any of the states @xmath19 or @xmath9 is @xmath94 .",
    "+ if we are interested in determining how much the output state @xmath95 , we find : @xmath96 when averaged over all the input states this will give an overlap of @xmath97 .",
    "by separating the issue of symmetrization from that of entanglement we will have more freedom in constructing states exhibiting each of these properties . concerning symmetrization problem , we can now ask a more general question than the one considered in @xcite .",
    "+ is it possible to have a quantum machine which takes two input states @xmath19 and @xmath0 and produces generalized symmetric state as follows ?",
    "@xmath98 where @xmath99 is a predetermined phase . note that for simplicity we have suppressed all the @xmath100 signs . here",
    "@xmath101 and @xmath102 . to see this we note that if such a machine exists , it has to act as follows @xmath103 where @xmath11 and @xmath104 are two of the machine states .",
    "unitarity then demands the following relations among these machine states @xmath105 we now consider an input state like @xmath106 which according to ( [ machine ] ) should be transformed to @xmath107 where @xmath108 is another state of the machine . on the other hand linearity of quantum mechanics",
    "requires that in view of ( [ bh1 ] ) , this input state be transformed to the state @xmath109 comparing @xmath110 and @xmath111 , we find @xmath112 and @xmath113 ) only if @xmath114 .",
    "this proves the negative part of the theorem .",
    "the positive part has been demonstrated already in section 2 , where we have shown that the operator @xmath115 intertwines any two arbitrary states @xmath116 and @xmath0 to latexmath:[$\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(|\\psi\\rangle |\\phi\\rangle + i |\\phi\\rangle    the interesting point is that from two different starting points we have arrived at the above form of states , one from requiring maximum entanglement production in section 2 and the other from requiring universal symmetrization .",
    "note that while the arguments and the results for entanglement production are specific to qubits , those for symmetrization are valid in any dimension .",
    "this raises the question as to whether this coincidence holds true also in other dimensions . that is",
    "if the states of the form latexmath:[$\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(|\\psi\\rangle |\\phi\\rangle + i |\\phi\\rangle    higher dimensions ?",
    "we will touch upon this question in the conclusion of the paper .",
    "+ although we do not have a quantum machine which can put two arbitrary states @xmath19 and @xmath0 into a combination with a general relative phase @xmath118 , we can achieve this probabilistically by using fredkin gates which do controlled swap operations . the circuit shown in fig .",
    "[ fig.1 ] which is a generalization of the one given in @xcite for producing symmetric and antisymmetric superposition of input states , performs such an operation .",
    "note that no three body interaction is needed for implementing the fredkin gate and such a gate can be constructed by a combination of two body operations exactly @xcite .",
    "in fact such a circuit develops the state @xmath119 to the state @xmath120        before measurement of the control qubit the output state of @xmath2 and @xmath3 is a separable and hence disentangled mixed state given by the density matrix @xmath121 once the control qubit ( the state of the machine ) is measured in the basis @xmath122 and @xmath123 , the two systems @xmath124 and @xmath3 will be projected onto one of the normalized states @xmath125 are normalization factors .",
    "the result of the measurement of the control bit will declare which one of these two states have been produced .",
    "these states are produced with probabilities @xmath126 and @xmath127 .",
    "these states have now quantum entanglement as measured by their concurrence given by @xmath128 the average concurrence of the states produced will be given by @xmath129 which is equal to the concurrence we obtain for the state @xmath130 discussion ----------    we have shown that there is no quantum mechanical process which can change a product state @xmath131 into a state @xmath132 .",
    "this result is true in any dimension . in two dimensions where we are dealing with qubits and",
    "have a closed formula for the entanglement of formation of a mixed state @xcite , we have shown that these states are also the ones which have the maximum value of entanglement , when @xmath18 and @xmath19 are two initially fixed states .",
    "an interesting question is whether this correspondence exists also in higher dimensions or not .",
    "if this correspondence holds also in higher dimension then we can conjecture that the states of the form @xmath133 rather the symmetric or anti - symmetric ones are the states which have the maximum entanglement when averaged over all the input product states .",
    "a hint already comes from calculating the i - concurrence of these states as given in @xcite .",
    "the i - concurrence of a pure state @xmath134 of two systems @xmath2 and @xmath3 is defined to be @xmath135 where @xmath136 and @xmath137 are the reduced density matrices of the subsystems @xmath2 and @xmath33 respectively .",
    "if the two systems are in a pure state as above ( i.e. @xmath138 where @xmath46 stands for the density matrix of any of the two subsystems .",
    "a simple calculation shows that @xmath139 this concurrence reduces to ( [ 15 ] ) for qubits calculated from wootters formula .",
    "moreover for orthogonal states it gives the maximum value @xmath140 and when averaged over all product states it gives the value @xmath141 .",
    "in this section we present in detail the calculation leading to equation ( [ 15 ] ) . for two qubits @xmath142 and @xmath143",
    ", we have according to ( [ 14 ] ) , @xmath144 .",
    "let the qubit states @xmath116 and",
    "@xmath0 correspond to unit vectors @xmath145 and @xmath146 respectively .",
    "then we will have @xmath147 from which we find @xmath148 simplifying this expression leads to @xmath149 which is nothing but the expression @xmath150 written in components .    99 a. einstein , b. podolsky , and n. rosen , phys . rev . * 47 * , 777 ( 1935 ) .",

    "<S> given two arbitrary pure states @xmath0 and @xmath1 introduction ------------    entanglement @xcite is a quantum mechanical resource that can be used for many computational and communication purposes . during the past few years many experimental efforts have been reported for creating entanglement @xcite along with theoretical scenarios @xcite for generating as much entanglement as possible . </S>",
    "<S> a remarkable scenario has been put forward by buzek and hillery in @xcite which stems from the most apparent property of entangled states , that is , their symmetry property . </S>",
    "<S> consider two systems @xmath2 and @xmath3 in a pure state @xmath4 which can not be decomposed into a product of state vectors of the two parts . </S>",
    "<S> such a state is called entangled and has a value of entanglement according to various measures of entanglement , defined for measuring this property . </S>",
    "<S> a symmetric state of the form @xmath5 is a prototype of a pure state having this property . </S>",
    "<S> + the scenario of @xcite is thus based on the following natural question : given two systems @xmath2 and @xmath3 respectively in pure states @xmath6 and @xmath7 , is it possible to construct a quantum machine @xmath8 which takes these two states as input and produces with exact fidelity , a symmetric and hence entangled output state ? </S>",
    "<S> an even simpler task for this machine is to symmetrize an unknown state @xmath6 of @xmath2 with a fixed reference state @xmath9 of @xmath3 , that is @xmath10 where @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the initial and final states of the machine . </S>",
    "<S> the authors of @xcite show by a simple argument that linearity and unitarity of quantum mechanics do not allow such machines to exist . </S>",
    "<S> remarkably however , they succeed to construct an optimal machine which produces an output mixed state @xmath13 which has a universal ( input - independent ) fidelity equal to @xmath14 , with the ideal symmetric state latexmath:[$|\\psi\\rangle_{ab } = n(|\\psi\\rangle_a \\otimes |\\phi\\rangle_b + |\\phi\\rangle_a \\otimes    they then proceed to show that the output impure state @xmath13 is indeed quantum mechanically entangled or inseparable by using the peres - horodecki s criterion @xcite and showing that for all input states the partially transposed matrix @xmath16 has one negative eigenvalue . </S>",

    "<S> + we should also mention another related scheme for optimal entangling , the one proposed by alber @xcite who considers anti - symmetrization of an arbitrary input state with a reference state yielding the result that the output is a maximally disordered mixture of anti - symmetric bell states . for the case of qubits however , there is only one anti - symmetric bell state , namely @xmath17 , we propose a simple method for entangling qubits based on maximization of the entanglement of formation of a mixed state for which we have a closed formula as given by wootters @xcite . in sec .  </S>",
