    "the focus of our research is the accuracy of state estimation in the so - called _ continuous - discrete stochastic state - space _ systems .",
    "this means that their process models are presented in the form of the following it@xmath0-type _ stochastic differential equation _ ( sde ) : @xmath1 where @xmath2 , @xmath3 is a nonlinear sufficiently smooth drift function , @xmath4 is a time - invariant matrix of dimension @xmath5 and @xmath6 is a brownian motion with a fixed square diffusion matrix @xmath7 of size  @xmath8 .",

    "we point out that only _ additive - noise _ sde models are studied in this paper . at the same time , the utilized measurement models are discrete - time and given by the formula @xmath15 where @xmath16 stands for a discrete time index ( i.e. @xmath17 means @xmath18 ) , @xmath19 is a sufficiently smooth function and the measurement noise is @xmath20 with @xmath21 .",
    "we remark that the _ sampling period _ ( or _ waiting time _ ) @xmath22 , i.e. when the additional information @xmath23 comes to consideration , is assumed to be constant , below .",
    "in addition , all realizations of the noises  @xmath24 , @xmath25 and the initial state @xmath9 are assumed to be taken from mutually independent gaussian distributions .",
    "the continuous - discrete stochastic system ( [ eq1.1 ] ) , ( [ eq1.2 ] ) is a usual state estimation problem arisen in many areas of study as diverse as target tracking , navigation , stochastic control , chemistry and finance @xcite .",
    "strong arguments for using the discussed mathematical model in practical estimation tasks are outlined in @xcite .",
    "the key issue of our research is to identify changes in performances of filters , which are core state estimation tools in practice , when they are applied for treating stiff sde models of the form ( [ eq1.1 ] ) .",
    "our first state estimator is the traditional ekf designed long ago and presented , for example , in @xcite . despite its simplicity and the old - fashioned nature it has been a successful filtering means in the realm of nonlinear stochastic systems for decades @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , the first - order approximation provided by the ekf has been criticized in many studies , which have resulted in the development of more accurate ukf  @xcite and ckf @xcite methods .",
    "we point out that a lot of evidence confirming the superiority of the latter filters towards the ekf in estimating various continuous- and discrete - time stochastic state - space systems have been presented in @xcite and in other literature .",
    "however , all published proofs in the cited papers relate to estimation of nonstiff stochastic systems and , hence , the success of the ukf and ckf for treating stiff ones is questionable .",
    "below , we address this issue on two stochastic models whose dynamic behavior may be both nonstiff and stiff .    to estimate these nonstiff and stiff examples of the form ( [ eq1.1 ] ) , ( [ eq1.2 ] ) , we utilize filters designed in the frame of the so - called _ discrete - discrete _ approach @xcite , also known as",
    "_ linearized discretization _ in @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , all methods used below are abbreviated to : _ continuous - discrete extended kalman filter _ ( cd - ekf ) , _ continuous - discrete unscented kalman filter _ ( cd - ukf ) and _ continuous - discrete cubature kalman filter _ ( cd - ckf ) , because of the continuous - discrete fashion of the state estimation task under consideration .",
    "it is also worthwhile to emphasize that the time - invariant form of the matrices @xmath4 and @xmath26 in sde ( [ eq1.1 ] ) is crucial in our research .",
    "this requirement is imposed by the cd - ckf and cd - ukf method developments in @xcite , which are grounded in the it@xmath0-taylor expansion of order  1.5 ( it-1.5 ) . in the case of the variable matrices ,",
    "the underlying stochastic discretization method it-1.5 has a much more complicated form in comparison to that utilized in the latter papers ( see further details in ( * ? ? ?",
    "10.4 ) ) . thus , the cited cd - ckf and cd - ukf methods are not applicable to such models .",
    "in this section , we present all technical particulars of the used state estimators . they allow for an independent inspection of all calculations presented in sec .",
    "[ sect3 ] .",
    "we begin with the classical ekf .",
    "as said in sec .",
    "[ sect1 ] , all filters considered in our study are obtained within the discrete - discrete ( or linearized discretization ) approach and , hence , they are fixed - stepsize .",
    "the latter means that an @xmath27-step equidistant mesh is introduced in the sampling interval @xmath28 $ ] of size @xmath29 for approximating sde ( [ eq1.1 ] ) with the following formula : @xmath30 where the mesh s nodes @xmath31 , @xmath32 , the mesh s step size @xmath33 and the discretized noise @xmath34 .",
    "we point out that the utilized discretization ( [ eq1.3 ] ) is derived with the use of the conventional euler - maruyama method , which is known to be convergent of order  0.5 ( * ? ? ?",
    "then , the subdivision number @xmath27 ( or the step size @xmath35 ) plays an important role in the above discrete - time stochastic model because it is responsible for the accuracy of approximation of the original continuous - time model ( [ eq1.1 ] ) . in other words , raising this number of steps increases the accuracy of formula ( [ eq1.3 ] ) and reduces the corresponding discretization error . in turn , the latter boosts the accuracy and robustness of filtering techniques grounded in this discretization and implemented for treating sde models ( [ eq1.1 ] ) @xcite .",
    "it follows from formula  ( [ eq1.3 ] ) that taking the expectation yields @xmath36 with @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "the state vector @xmath39 is independent of the noise @xmath40 .",
    "therefore the associated covariance obeys the following recursion : @xmath41 further , the ekf technology implies that the moment equations ( [ eq1.4 ] ) and ( [ eq1.5 ] ) are solved approximately on each subinterval @xmath42 $ ] of the euler - maruyama discretization ( [ eq1.3 ] ) @xcite .",
    "this is done by means of the first - order taylor expansion of the drift function @xmath43 around the state mean vector @xmath44 computed at the time @xmath45 , i.e. @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the corresponding partial derivative ( jacobian ) of the function @xmath43 with respect to @xmath39 and evaluated at @xmath48 , @xmath49 stands for higher - order terms of this taylor expansion . now neglecting @xmath49 in  ( [ eq1.6 ] ) and substituting it into eqs  ( [ eq1.4 ] ) and ( [ eq1.5 ] )",

    "@xcite and presented in the cited paper in great detail .",
    "again , this filter is fixed - stepsize and , hence , sde ( [ eq1.1 ] ) should be discretized on an equidistant mesh at first .",

    "in contrast , the cd - ckf and cd - ukf are grounded in the _ third - degree spherical - radial cubature rule _ and in the _ unscented transform _ , respectively .",
    "then , these estimation methods enjoy the third - order approximations of state means and the first - order accuracies of covariances computed in the time- and measurement - update steps of the mentioned filters .",
