    "bloch functions are the basis of periodic system theory , particularly of crystalline solid physics @xcite and optical lattices@xcite . for a high - precision approximation of a standing wave ( sinusoidal potential ) , by one of the authors",
    "was suggested a biparabolic form for the potential@xcite , bloch functions of which are expressed by confluent hypergeometric functions .",
    "the approximation for the potential has been used to calculate the spontaneous emission in the field of resonant standing wave , the presence of light - induced anisotropy in that emission was shown @xcite .",
    "also it was used for calculating the temperature of ideal gas bec in a periodic field and was shown that the critical temperature decreases with the deepening of the potential@xcite .    in this paper",
    "the biparabolic periodic potential is used to investigate the bloch states themselves , more concretely , for identifying the behavior of modulo wave function as a function of energy in the limits of a specific energy band .",
    "specially we are interested in so - called  underbarrier  ( classically forbidden ) states .",
    "the way of dependance of underbarrier states on energy is well - known for a single potential barrier and for transitions from one energy band to the neighboring ones : the underbarrier wave function decreases  conjointly with the decreasing of energy of a particle .",
    "but what is the kind of dependancein the limits of a sole ( definite ) energy band ?",
    "surprisingly this question has slipped from investigators sight ; at least in scientific literature available to us we did not find works concerning this question .  as a formal argument for examining this question , for us appears the fact that bloch states are generated through the interference of particle de broglie waves transmitted and deflected from many ( infinite in the limit ) potential barriers , and hence interference , besides the energy ,",
    "also will play an essential role in establishment of regularities .",
    "of course , the deflection and interference of underbarrier states take place in case of a single - barrier potential too , but they are small there and as a dominating behavior will appear the energetic behavior .",
    "consequently , the inter - band regularity  is not under necessity to be repeated for intra - band states too .",
    "really , in case of periodic potential , when from different barriers multiple - wave interference takes place , as a dominating one can appear the interference behavior ,  and the dominant role of interference will be expected for intra - band regularities .",
    "than , if the interference behavior does not coincide with energy one , the general behavior will mimic the interference but not energy regularity .",
    "our calculations show that indeed , when particle s energy decreases in limits of a definite band , the modulus of the wave function of underbarrier ( classically forbidden ) region does not decrease , as should be expected from energy reasonings , but increases .",
    "the growth rate is the greatest for the band , nearest to the height of periodic potential .",
    "stationary schrdinger equation can be written in a standard form @xmath0 where the particle coordinate @xmath1 is normalized in units of the potential period @xmath2 with coefficient @xmath3 ( @xmath4 @xmath5 is the one - dimensional reciprocal lattice constant ) and the full energy @xmath6 and the potential energy @xmath7 are normalized in units of   lattice  recoil energy quantum @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is mass of the particle .",
    "taking for convenience the zero of the energy on the level of potential energy minimums , biparabolic potential @xmath7 takes the form ( see for more details @xcite or @xcite ) @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the height of the periodic potential , @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath1 for each @xmath14 lays in range @xmath15    the form of the potential is given in fig.[fig.1 ] , where region @xmath16 ( and others similar to it ) will be named well - type , and region @xmath17 ( and similar ones ) - barrier - type .",
    "linearly independent solutions of  schrdinger eq.([1 ] ) for well - type region @xmath16 are written in form @xcite,@xcite @xmath18 @xmath19 where @xmath20 @xmath21 , @xmath22 is the confluent hypergeometric function and @xmath23 the total wave function in this region will be @xmath24 where @xmath25 and @xmath26are unknown constant coefficients .",
    "the corresponding solutions for barrier - type region @xmath17 have the form @xmath27 @xmath28 where @xmath29 @xmath30 and @xmath31 and the total wave function in this region will be @xmath32 with yet arbitrary coefficients @xmath33 and @xmath34    with the help of continuity requirements at boundary points @xmath35 and @xmath36 and bloch periodicity we get the dispersion relation , which can be written in form @xmath37 or @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the normalized momentum of particle and @xmath40 where the prime over the function means derivative with respect to @xmath41    the same requirements , as is well known , with additional normalizing condition @xmath42 define the coefficients @xmath43 and @xmath44    the edge values of energy bands according to ( [ 11a ] ) and ( [ 11b ] ) are determined as solutions of transcendental equations @xmath45    analysis of these conditions shows that left- and right - side edge points on the positive - side axis of quasimomentum ( expanded conception of energy bands ) are determined from conditions @xmath46 and @xmath47 respectively for @xmath48 being even , and by conditions @xmath49 and @xmath50 for @xmath48 being odd@xmath51  for keeping analogy with the harmonic potential the band with the smallest energy is designated @xmath52    for even - numbered bands it is appropriate to express the coefficients by @xmath53@xmath54 @xmath55 where @xmath25 is determined from the normalizing condition . for odd - numbered bands it is appropriate to express the coefficients by @xmath56 ; @xmath57 @xmath58 and use the normalizing condition to determine @xmath59    let s now consider the states , with energies near to the height @xmath11 of periodic potential : @xmath60 in fig.[fig.1 ] these energies lay inside the dotted lines . for them",
    "the parameter @xmath61 ( see ( [ 9 ] ) ) , which determines the character of bloch wave functions in barrier - type region , possesses the value @xmath62  the corresponding formulas ( [ 7 ] ) and ( [ 8 ] ) are simplified with help of a well known representation for bessel functions @xmath63 by confluent hypergeometric ones : @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the gamma function .  to use this formula for ( [ 7 ] ) we must choose @xmath66 , and for ( [ 8 ] ) - @xmath67  after corresponding substitutions we arrive to @xmath68 @xmath69 to avoid misunderstandings we note , that though linearly independent solutions @xmath70 and @xmath71 for the considered  approximation do not depend on energy of the particle , the total bloch wave function @xmath72 is energy dependant via the coefficients @xmath33 and @xmath73 .    as to wave - functions @xmath74 and @xmath75 of well - type region",
    ", we will use the second tricomi expansion@xcite for them , @xmath76 where @xmath77 @xmath78 @xmath79 and will restrict ourselves with the first member of expansion , which corresponds to sufficiently deep potentials ( @xmath80 ) .",
    "the respective bessel functions are expressed by elementary trigonometric functions and as a consequence @xmath81 all the coefficients and dispersion relation @xmath82 also undergo sufficient changes .  the dispersion relation , for example , takes the form @xmath83 \\cos ( \\pi \\sqrt{e% } ) -j_{-1/4}(u)\\times \\\\   j_{1/4}(u)\\frac{\\pi } { 2}\\sqrt{e}\\sin ( \\pi \\sqrt{e}% ) -4u^{2}j_{-3/4}(u)j_{3/4}(u)\\frac{2}{\\pi \\sqrt{e}}\\sin ( \\pi \\sqrt{e } ) \\end{array } \\right\\ } ,   \\eqnum{24 }   \\label{24}\\ ] ] where @xmath84",
    "to display the sought dependance , that is the behavior of bloch wave functions due to changing of the energy in limits of a single ( defined ) band , we proceed from the above mentioned near - top approximation .  with the help of computer simulations we first determined the depth of potential @xmath11 ,",
    "so that the last allowed inner - potential band would be found immediately near the tops of periodic potential ( for fig.([fig.2 ] ) , with @xmath85the energy of mentioned band lays in limits @xmath86 @xmath87 @xmath88and when @xmath89 , in limits @xmath90 @xmath91 ) .  then with the help of formulas ( [ 6 ] ) and ( [ 10 ] ) , with linearly independent solutions ( [ 7 ] ) , ( [ 8 ] ) and ( [ 23 ] ) , coefficients ( [ 15 ] ) , ( [ 16 ] ) or ( [ 17 ] ) , ( [ 18 ] ) , dispersion relation ( [ 24 ] ) and normalizing condition ( [ 13 ] ) , we computed the sought values of  @xmath92 and @xmath93 as a function of coordinate @xmath1 along one spacial period .  repeating these calculations for all the energy values of the band ,",
    "we obtain a ( continuous ) sequence of curves , the juxtaposition of which along the energy lines gives us the seeking behavior .    in figs .",
    "2a and 2b we present the results of such calculations for two different depths of potential ; one ( fig.2a ) for a  potential depth , containing two energy bands , and the other one ( fig.2b ) containing four energy bands .",
    "2a illustrates the energy - space distribution of bloch states in case  of relatively shallow potential . fig .",
    "2b illustrates the same kind distribution for relatively deep potential . left half of the face axis ( @xmath1 )",
    "corresponds to the well - type region of the potential , and the right half - to the barrier - type region .",
    "the energy axis is , as is seen , directed from the reader ( energy grows from face to back ) .",
    "as anomalous one is regarded the behavior of wave function in right - half side(s ) of the figure(s ) , that is the dynamics of bloch functions in the barrier - type regions ( see fig.1 ) as a function of energy .",
    "obviously is seen that the moving along the energy axis from the back face to the front face , which physically means getting deeper into potential , does not decrease but , quite the contrary , increases the modulo square of the wave function .",
    "that merely means that the probability of the particle to be found deeper under the potential barrier ( staying in the limits of a band ) is greater than the probability to be found at smaller depths !",
    "this kind of behavior is in contrary to the regularity for the case of deepening into the periodic potential over various energy bands , or for the case of a single potential barrier .",
    "@xmath94 @xmath95 @xmath96 @xmath97 @xmath98 @xmath99 @xmath100 @xmath101 .    to avoid possible misunderstanding of the mentioned regularity",
    "it will be noted that there is not any strangeness or abnormality in the fact , that the wave function in barrier - type ( right ) space region is essentially greater in average than in well - type ( left ) space region ; it is simply the echo of overbarrier reflecting , when velocity of the particle decreases and the wave function ( probability of being ) respectively increases , in  underbarrier  states .",
    "the next question that is of interest , is how does the rate of anomalous rising depend on the location of the band relative to the height of periodic potential . for this kind of calculations the near - top energy approximation , of course",
    ", is not applicable and we had to proceed from the precise formulas .  a detailed analysis of the regularities obtained for bloch state and comparison with single - barrier case we will give in another publication .",
    "we would like only to note that while moving away from near - top energies as inside as outside the periodic potential , the rate ( scaled in energy units ) of anomalous growth decreases .",
    "finally we note that we carried out the anomalous behavior also for the kronig - penny s potential , but for that case the anomaly is much weaker , than for the case of biparabolic potential ( see fig.([fig.3 ] ) ) .",
    "it is easy to understand since the single barrier transparency in high energy region , and hence the effectivity of matter - wave interference is bigger for biparabolic - form potential than for rectangular - form one .",
