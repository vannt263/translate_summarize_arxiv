    "studies of excitations of ultracold atoms in optical lattices play an important role for understanding of their physical properties and dynamical behavior .",
    "for instance , celebrated quantum phase transition from the superfluid ( sf ) into the mott - insulator ( mi )  @xcite is accompanied by the opening of the gap in the excitation spectrum  @xcite . in the deep optical lattices the system of interacting bosons is satisfactorily described by the bose - hubbard model  @xcite . since the model is not integrable ,",
    "exact analytical results can be obtained only in few special cases like in the limit of weakly interacting gas  @xcite or for hard - core bosons in one dimension  @xcite . however , in general exact results can be obtained only with the aid of numerical methods .",
    "exact numerical results for the spectrum of low - energy excitations were obtained by means of diagonalizations of the bose - hubbard hamiltonian  @xcite . although numerical diagonalization can be really done only for rather small lattices which are far from the thermodynamic limit , this allows to capture all the main characteristic features of realistic systems .",
    "numerical results for larger systems of the same size as in real experiments with ultracold atoms  @xcite have been obtained by quantum monte carlo methods  @xcite which allow to compute the spectral properties  @xcite .",
    "simulation of the real - time dynamics of quantum systems within quantum monte carlo is also possible ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) but has not been yet performed for bose systems .",
    "ground - state properties as well as the real - time dynamics of one - dimensional systems subject to external perturbation were studied , e.g. , in refs .",
    "@xcite by the powerful numerical density - matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) method giving an access to the excitation spectrum  @xcite but so far restricted to one - dimensional systems .",
    "mean - field theories in the dimensions higher than one allow self - consistent study of the excitations and dynamics in the lowest order with respect to quantum fluctuations .",
    "in a weakly interacting regime , the atoms are fully condensed and the system is satisfactorily described by the time - dependent discrete gross - pitaevskii equation ( dgpe ) . the excitation spectrum can be calculated using bogoliubov - de  gennes ( bdg ) equations  @xcite .",
    "it has a form of the goldstone mode characterized at large wavelengths by the sound velocity @xmath0 .",
    "the latter is related to the compressibility @xmath1 , the effective mass @xmath2 and the condensate density @xmath3 through the relation  @xcite @xmath4 the same expression for the sound velocity can be also derived from the bogoliubov theory in the operator formalism  @xcite and from the hydrodynamic approach  @xcite .    in the strongly interacting regime ,",
    "condensate fraction becomes suppressed and for commensurate fillings the system can undergo a transition from the sf into the mi state  @xcite . in this regime , dgpe is not valid and on the mean - field level must be replaced by more general gutzwiller equations  ( ge ) which are exact for a gas of infinite dimensions  @xcite .",
    "ge were successfully used to study various phenomena like creation of molecular condensate by dynamically melting a mi  @xcite , dynamical transition from the sf to bose - glass phase due to controlled growing of the disorder  @xcite , the gas dynamics in time - dependent lattice potentials  @xcite , transport of cold atoms induced by the shift of the underlying harmonic potential  @xcite , dynamics of metastable states of dipolar bosons  @xcite , and the soliton propagation  @xcite .",
    "excitations above the ground state described by the ge were studied using the random phase approximation ( rpa )  @xcite , the schwinger - boson approach  @xcite , time - dependent variational principle with subsequent quantization  @xcite , hubbard - stratonovich transformation  @xcite , slave - boson representation of the bose - hubbard model  @xcite , standard - basis operator method  @xcite , and ginzburg - landau theory  @xcite .",
    "all these methods show that in the mi phase the spectrum of excitations consists of the particle- and hole - modes , both with nonvanishing gaps  @xcite . in the sf phase ,",
    "the lowest branch is a gapless goldstone mode  @xcite , while higher branches are gapped  @xcite .",
    "however , different approximations used in the calculations by different methods do not always lead to the same final results . for instance , in ref .",
    "@xcite it was checked numerically that the rpa gives the same result for the sound velocity as eq .",
    "( [ vs ] ) , whereas the analytical expressions derived in refs .",
    "@xcite differ from that .",
    "excitations above the gutzwiller ground state can be also investigated using generalization of the bdg equations directly derived from the ge within the framework of the linear response theory .",
    "this method was used for the lattice bose gas with short - range  @xcite as well as long - range  @xcite interactions .",
    "this approach , which was not so far widely used to study the lattice bose gas allows to obtain results consistent with other mean - field approaches mentioned above and to study the ground state , stationary excitation modes as well as the dynamics of the gas on equal footing .",
    "the excitations can be probed in experiments on inelastic light scattering ( bragg spectroscopy ) which provide an information on the dynamic structure factor and one - particle spectral function .",
    "recently such experiments were carried out with ultra - cold rubidium atoms in optical lattices of different dimensions in the sf phase  @xcite and across the sf - mi transition  @xcite .",
    "theoretical analysis has been developed using exact diagonalization of the bose - hubbard hamiltonian  @xcite , quantum monte carlo simulations in one dimension  @xcite , perturbation theory valid deep in the mi phase  @xcite , hydrodynamic theory  @xcite , exact bethe - ansatz solution of the lieb - liniger model  @xcite , extended fermionization  @xcite , rpa  @xcite .",
    "analogous studies were also performed within the gutzwiller approximation  @xcite . however , previous calculations are valid only for the mi  @xcite or close to it  @xcite .",
    "it was argued that the second excitation branch in the sf can not be detected by the bragg spectroscopy in the linear regime  @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the calculations beyond the linear response theory taking into account the harmonic trapping potential and the finite duration of the probing bragg pulse were performed which are in good quantitative agreement with the experimental data reporting the observation of the second excitation branch . in the present work",
    ", we will study in details the possibility to observe the second excitation mode in a homogeneous lattice in the linear - response regime .",
    "experimentally sound waves can be observed with the aid of an external potential which creates a density perturbation of the gas .",
    "corresponding numerical simulations for the lattice gas were performed on the basis of the dgpe  @xcite and for soft - core bosons in 1d making use of the dmrg method  @xcite .",
    "the sound velocity extracted from these simulations is in perfect agreement with eq .",
    "( [ vs ] ) in the case of the dgpe  @xcite and has a correct asymptotic behavior in 1d in the limits of weak and strong interactions  @xcite , where analytical expressions are known .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to give a comprehensive self - consistent description of the collective excitations as well as experimental techniques for their observation within the time - dependent gutzwiller ansatz which is gapless and satisfies the basic conservation laws , in particular , f - sum rule .",
    "solution of ge allows not only to obtain the excitation dispersion relations but also to calculate the transition amplitudes in the bragg scattering process .",
    "we present a derivation of eq .",
    "( [ vs ] ) from the generalized bdg equations .",
    "furthermore , the time - dependent approach is also used to investigate the sound wave propagation in the case of a stronger perturbation generated by switching off a local potential . in this way",
    ", we can determine the speed at which this perturbation propagates and compare with the predictions of the linear - response theory .",
