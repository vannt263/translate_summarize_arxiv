    "in @xcite we investigated a model for gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) deriving from a neutrino burst of energy @xmath1 ergs above a heated , collapsing neutron star in a binary .",
    "such conditions have been suggested by numerical relativistic hydrodynamic simulations @xcite of compression , heating and collapse of binary neutron stars near their last stable orbit .",
    "such a thermal neutrino burst was found to partially recombine via @xmath6 into an @xmath2 pair plasma which expands relativistically .",
    "this fireball then recombines into photons via @xmath7 and was found to give a gamma - ray burst of energy @xmath8 ergs with spectral and temporal characteristics consistent with observations .",
    "this paper elaborates on the previous work in three distinct ways .",
    "1 ) the latest general relativistic hydrodynamic calculations by wilson and mathews indicate that evolution and compression of the stars in a binary is faster than previously thought ; @xmath9 sec , thus making this process a more natural candidate for the generation of `` short '' grbs ( @xmath9 sec ) .",
    "2 ) herein we use recent work by @xcite which calculates the neutrino annihilation rate _ between _ two neutron stars in addition to the annihilation rate from a single star @xcite .",
    "this ` inter - star ' annihilation will not drive a baryon wind from the stellar surface and thus we find no baryon loading in the @xmath2 pair plasma that originates between the neutron stars .",
    "3 ) we employ three dimensional ( 3d ) relativistic hydrodynamic calculations to model the flow of the wind in the complex , rotating , strong gravity environment around the neutron stars .",
    "it has been known for some time that the population of grbs is bimodal , with approximately a third of bursts having durations less than 2 seconds , and these short bursts typically have harder spectra than those bursts lasting longer than 2 seconds @xcite .",
    "this bimodality is thought to indicate that short and long bursts are separate populations and mechanisms .",
    "this view is bolstered by evidence that spectral break energy @xcite and pulse lags @xcite have a discontinous jump between short and long populations .",
    "the lack of discovery and location of an afterglow associated with short bursts has severely impeded progress in determining the distance scale and thus the energetics of these bursts .",
    "in fact , comparisons of bepposax and batse data archives indicates a dearth of x - ray afterglows @xcite .",
    "analysis of batse data for short burst decay tails give conflicting results indicating both a lack of an underlying afterglow component @xcite and the existence of such a component @xcite .",
    "in this model we estimate that 10% of the rotationally enhanced binding energy of a neutron star ( @xmath1 ergs ) is converted to thermal energy via compression , vortices and shocks .",
    "this @xmath10 ergs of energy is released as a monotonically increasing luminosity of neutrinos over a timescale of order @xmath11 second as estimated by @xcite .",
    "this neutrino luminosity @xmath12 ergs s@xmath13 annihilates into an @xmath2 pair plasma .",
    "annihilation of high neutrino luminosities in the strong gravitational field of the neutron stars can have high efficiencies ; near unity @xcite .",
    "about half of the pair plasma energy is deposited uniformly around the neutron stars due to single star neutrino annihilation @xcite and the other half is deposited between the stars due to interstar neutrino annihilation @xcite .",
    "this plasma deposition morphology then becomes input for the 3d relativistic hydrodynamic code , which calculates the expansion of the plasma ( figure [ fig:3dfig ] ) .",
    "these simulations show a plasma of very high entropy expanding out along the plane of symmetry between the neutron stars . in the regions around the stars",
    "lower entropy plasma is formed because a baryon wind is blown from the stars .",
    "the numerical model follows the baryons , hence some baryons were added in the interstellar region .",
    "the calculation yields an estimate of the angular distribution of the baryonic loading of the plasma .",
    "thus this model predicts a variety of bursts .",
    "viewed along the axis of rotation , a prompt quasi - thermal burst of duration @xmath11 second will result from the annihilation of fireball pairs @xcite .",
    "because of the dearth of baryons left over to sweep into the interstellar medium , we do not predict the existence of an afterglow .",
    "this agrees with preliminary searches of the data archives for short - burst afterglows , which appear to be missing @xcite",
    ".    viewed far from the axis of rotation a very different burst results .",
    "the lower entropy means that there will not be a prompt burst from pair annihilation in the fireball .",
    "however , there will be a baryon wind sweeping into the interstellar medium .",
    "thus we expect a burst that decays into an afterglow as a power - law @xcite .",
    "this behavior will be made chaotic and complex by the rapid rotation of the binary system .",
    "using one - dimensional ( 1d ) relativistic hydrodynamics described in @xcite , we can study the expansion of an @xmath2 pair plasma fireball from the surface of a single neutron star . as per our model",
    ", we deposit @xmath14 ergs of energy into a narrow ( width @xmath15 km ) shell region above the surface of a @xmath16 km radius and 1.4 @xmath17 mass neutron star .",
    "we monotonically ramp the energy over @xmath18 second .",
    "this model is run with a range of deposited baryon densities and thus a range of baryon loadings of the fireball .",
    "it is important to note that our hydrodynamics do not track the protons and neutrons separately and , as such , assumes they are well coupled during the expansion and acceleration of the plasma . as was shown by @xcite and @xcite",
    ", the neutrons can decouple from the protons and @xmath2 plasma during acceleration , thus changing the overall baryon load of the plasma .",
    "since it is plausible that the baryon matter blown off of the neutron star is 90% neutrons , it is reasonable to expect , depending on the efficiency of the decoupling , the effective baryon mass to be a factor of several less than the total baryon mass .",
    "the plasma fireball is evolved and we find that it expands adiabatically as a thin shell of constant coordinate thickness @xmath19 @xcite .",
    "we track this expansion and pair annihilation until the optical depth , @xmath20 , of the plasma falls below unity : @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the coordinate density of electrons and positrons and @xmath23 is the thompson cross - section .",
    "the energy in photons , @xmath24 , and in the baryons , @xmath25 , is calculated and these results are summarized in fig .",
    "( [ fig : eod ] ) .",
    "one can see that for @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the baryonic rest mass energy , most of the energy goes into accelerating the baryons while for @xmath28 a substantial fraction of the energy is expressed as photons directly from the plasma ; i.e.  a gamma - ray burst .",
    "this result can be understood when one considers that the opacity of the fireball derives from two electron densities : electrons associated with entrained protons , @xmath29 , and electrons and positrons in pairs , @xmath30 . defining the optical depth as @xmath31 , then by comparing the densities @xmath32 and @xmath30",
    ", we understand the relative importance of these two sources of opacity .",
    "we first consider the baryons .",
    "equating the energy deposition with outgoing flux gives the initial energy density at the surface of the neutron star @xmath33 ergs @xmath34 .",
    "it follows that the corresponding initial number density of baryons is @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is the ratio of baryon rest mass energy to total energy .",
    "finally , we know @xcite that for relativistic adiabatic expansion we have : @xmath37 .",
    "let us assume that 10% of the baryons are protons with associated electrons .",
    "then the optical depth from the entrained baryons is @xmath38 and thus optical thinness , @xmath39 happens at a radius @xmath40 cm , where @xmath41 .",
    "notice that this radius depends on the initial baryon loading of the fireball : @xmath42 .",
    "the opacity due to pairs is a bit more complex .",
    "as discussed in @xcite , the pair number density is governed by the following equation @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the maxwellian averaged mean pair annihilation rate per particle and @xmath45 is the local coordinate equilibrium @xmath2 pair density at local temperature @xmath46 given by the appropriate fermi integral with a chemical potential of zero .",
    "early in the fireball expansion @xmath2 pairs are in equilibrium so @xmath47 and thus the pairs expand adiabatically : @xmath48 , where the initial pair number density is given by @xmath49 .",
    "when the local temperature , @xmath46 , of the plasma falls below @xmath50 mev the pairs begin to rapidly annihilate .",
    "this happens at a radius @xmath51 .",
    "the pair number density plummets until the annihilation term in eqn .",
    "( [ jay : e : ndiff ] ) no longer dominates , which happens at a density @xmath52 .",
    "this annihilation happens over a few @xmath53 which is very small compared to the radius at which pairs and photons decouple and therefore these results are independent of the details of this annihilation phase . beyond this point",
    "the pair number density again expands adiabatically : @xmath54 .",
    "thus the optical depth from the pairs is @xmath55 and optical thinness , @xmath56 , happens at a radius @xmath57 cm which is independent of @xmath58 .",
    "thus we see that the transition shown in fig .",
    "( [ fig : eod ] ) from baryon - dominated to photon - dominated fireball energy is governed by the relative importance of opacity associated with the baryons and that associated with the @xmath2 pairs .",
    "therefore it is important to consider both the opacity due to electrons associated with protons , which dominate for high baryon loading , and the opacity of the @xmath2 pair plasma which dominates for low baryon loads . for initial values",
    "@xmath59 , @xmath60 so the opacity is dominated by the electrons associated with the baryons and thus the baryons are able to `` hold '' the plasma longer and thus absorb all of the fireball energy . for @xmath61",
    "we have @xmath62 and the pairs are the dominant source of opacity and thus determine the radius of optical thinness .",
    "if the radius of optical thinness falls below the radius to saturate the energy of the baryons , i.e.  the radius at which most of the plasma energy is in the baryons , @xmath63 , then the acceleration of the baryons is inefficient , they do not attain the energy @xmath64 , and thus more energy remains in the photons , thus yielding a photon burst .",
    "while the 1d hydrodynamics of the last section elucidate the behavior of an expanding relativistic plasma , a 3d calculation is required to capture the structure inherent in the present problem of rotating , emitting binary neutron stars . in this section",
    "we introduce the 3d relativistic hydrodynamic equations .",
    "herein we use units @xmath65 .",
    "the continuity equation is @xmath66 where the spatial dimensions are indicated by the sum over @xmath67 .",
    "the energy equation is @xmath68 ~. \\label{eqn : edens}\\ ] ] and the momentum equations are @xmath69 \\frac { \\partial ( \\log \\phi ) } { \\partial x^i } ~ , \\end{split}\\ ] ] where the four - velocity is @xmath70 and we define a generalized lorentz factor @xmath71 the coordinate velocity in terms of the four velocity ( eqn .",
    "[ fourveleqn ] ) is given by @xmath72 and the equation of state is given by @xmath73    the metric is 3 + 1 and taken to be conformally flat .",
    "the lapse function is given by @xmath74 the spatial factor is @xmath75 and the shift vector is @xmath76 the factor @xmath77 is defined by @xmath78 where @xmath79 and @xmath80 are the distances from the center of the nearest and farthest stars respectively , each of mass @xmath81 and radius @xmath82 .",
    "an example of a 3d run is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:3dfig ] .",
    "an edit of the final lorentz factor , @xmath83 , as a function of angle from the rotation axis in the plane defined by the rotation axis and the line connecting the two stars is shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : eod ] .",
    "one can see that the highest energy per baryon occur along the rotation axis . from this figure one gets the scale of the opening angle of this high energy material : @xmath84 .",
    "the simulation does not sufficiently resolve the region of high @xmath85 at low angles .",
    "very little baryon mass will make it into this region of high energy density , thus we expect @xmath85 to be effectively infinite on the rotation axis . thus for viewers within this angle we have a thermal burst dominated by @xmath2 pair - photon plasma as described in @xcite .",
    "an edit of the observed temperature @xmath86 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : tobs ] , where we have used quantities defined in eqns .",
    "( [ eqn : edens ] , [ eqn : w ] , [ eqn : alpha ] ) .    one can see from fig .",
    "[ fig : eod ] that , depending on the observer angle with respect to the axis of rotation , a wide range of baryon loadings , parameterized by @xmath85 , will be observed .",
    "thus we study the range of expected observed signals as it depends on @xmath85 .",
    "herein we assume a correspondence between the ratio of energy to mass , @xmath58 , of the spherically symmetric calculations of section [ 1dsection ] to the ratio of energy to mass _ coordinate densities _ , @xmath85 , as taken from the 3d code runs . as such",
    ", we expect a thermal burst for observers along the axis of rotation of the stars and within an angle @xmath84 where no baryons are deposited and thus @xmath87 . as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : eod ] , for increasing @xmath88 from the rotation axis , @xmath85 decreases rapidly to @xmath89 .    for all @xmath90 all of the energy of the pair plasma",
    "is deposited into the baryons and therefore a prompt thermal burst does not occur . instead",
    ", the mass , @xmath27 , of baryons moving with lorentz factor , @xmath91 , sweep into the interstellar medium , thus forming a collisionless shock , and decelerate according to ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) @xmath92 for @xmath93 where @xmath94 is the deceleration radius , @xmath95 is the interstellar medium ( ism ) density , @xmath96 @xmath34 is the ism baryon number density , @xmath97 and @xmath98 .",
    "this model was worked out in detail in @xcite .",
    "the shock will emit synchrotron radiation as it decelerates with a characteristic luminosity @xmath99 ergs s@xmath13 at a characteristic photon energy @xmath100 kev and a duration on the deceleration timescale @xmath101 s. note that for @xmath102 this timescale is consistent with long bursts : @xmath103 s.    a distinct feature of this progenitor model , since the wind comes from the surface of a neutron star , is that most of the baryons will be in the form of neutrons ( say 90% ) .",
    "thus these neutrons will not couple with the ism magnetic field and will pass by the decelerating protons .",
    "these neutrons will decay back to protons on a timescale of a neutron half - life , @xmath104 s , which happens at a radius @xmath105 cm . comparing this radius with the decelaration radius ,",
    "@xmath94 , we see that @xmath106 for @xmath107 , i.e.  the neutrons have decayed into protons before reaching the deceleration radius .",
    "so we expect this effect to be important for @xmath108 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : gammaschem ] ) .",
    "another characteristic lorentz factor @xmath109 is when the time , in the fluid frame , to reach the deceleration radius is shorter then the deposition time , @xmath18 s. the fluid frame deposition distance is @xmath110 cm . also in the fluid frame , the deceleration distance is @xmath111 cm .",
    "these are equal at @xmath112 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : gammaschem ] ) .",
    "thus for @xmath113 the plasma deposited at the beginning of the deposition time has begun to decelerate before the plasma has completed deposition , so the assumption that the plasma is a thin , shocked shell plowing into the ism is invalid . instead",
    ", energy will be continuously deposited into the shock .",
    "an important caveat for these high lorentz factors , @xmath114 , is that they likely are beyond the regime of validity for the collisionless shock .",
    "the detailed physics behind such shocks is not well understood ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and assumes that the kinetic energy of the baryons , @xmath115 , will effectively amplify the magnetic field and energize the electrons .",
    "however , low densities of ultra - high energy baryons will inefficently couple with the ism and thus the collisionless shock approximation will be invalid .",
    "again , for energy , @xmath14 ergs , with photon energy @xmath116 kev , the observed photon fluence seen at a distance , @xmath117 , will be @xmath118 @xmath119 , where @xmath120 and @xmath121 is an efficiency factor which may be about @xmath122 .",
    "for example , given @xmath123 , we expect a fluence of @xmath124 photons @xmath119 with characteristic energy @xmath125 gev over a duration @xmath126 s. so such a burst would be far from recognizable as such ( fig .",
    "[ fig : gammaschem ] ) .",
    "a key result of the 3d numerical simulations ( fig .  [ fig : eod ] ) is that the emission from this system is bimodal : about half of the total energy is deposited as a pure , baryon - free , @xmath127 , pair plasma along a ` fan ' of angular half - width @xmath128 along the symmetry plane between the neutron stars , and the other half of the total energy is blown off of the neutron stars as a wind with @xmath129 .",
    "very little of the energy is deposited in intermediate regimes of @xmath85 . as such we analyse the expected observations from this model .",
    "the solid angle subtended by the fan of baryon - free plasma is @xmath130 and the wind blows off into the rest of space , @xmath131 .",
    "therefore the fluence from each component at a distance @xmath117 for total energy @xmath132 is @xmath133 where @xmath121 is an efficiency factor .",
    "now the system is rotating so an observer with angle , @xmath134 , from the rotation axis will see a mixture of the fan and wind , unless he is located within an angle @xmath135 .",
    "since the period of rotation of the system is much smaller than the energy deposition timescale , @xmath18 s , we average over the fluences from the wind and the fan to get a total average fluence .",
    "the proportion of a rotation subtended by the fan is @xmath136 for @xmath137 and is unity for @xmath138 .",
    "so the average fluence contributed by the fan as a function of viewing angle is ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fanwind ] ) @xmath139 and that of the wind is @xmath140 the total average fluence is @xmath141 an observer within @xmath138 sees only the fan emission .",
    "this is effectively a jet of opening half - angle @xmath142 .",
    "such an observer sees a jet of strong thermal emission over a timescale of 0.1 s. for @xmath143 we have @xmath144 so an observer along the jet ( @xmath145 ) will see roughly twice the fluence in a short , @xmath146 s , thermal , @xmath147 mev , gamma - ray burst , than an off - axis observer ( @xmath148 ) who will see a synchrotron burst of duration @xmath149 s with characteristic photon energy 200 kev .",
    "in conclusion , when the binary system is viewed within @xmath150 of the axis of rotation , we have a model for short gamma - ray bursts , @xmath151 s , which have hard spectra , several mev . in addition",
    ", when the binary system is viewed at angles larger than @xmath150 from the rotation axis , our model yields a second group of bursts , 30 times more common , with soft spectra , a few hundred kev , and intermediate time duration of 1 to 5 s. the energy available depends on the neutron star equation of state and the masses of the neutron stars .",
    "the energy in a burst could range from @xmath152 ergs to a few times @xmath5 ergs . from fig .",
    "[ fig : fanwind ] we see that if the detector is primarily sensitive to number counts then at intermediate viewing angles the fan contribution to the signal may be missed .",
    "the pure fan signal , i.e.  a jet viewed within @xmath150 of the rotation axis , will have no afterglow , but the fan plus wind would have an afterglow and a small contribution of high energy photons .",
    "@xcite have observed a 2 s burst with an afterglow . unfortunately the high energy detector data was not obtained ."
