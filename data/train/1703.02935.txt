    "in this paper , @xmath4 and @xmath5 are non - zero radon measures .",
    "the measure @xmath5 is generally assumed to be either _ dyadically doubling _ or _ globally doubling_. dyadically doubling means that @xmath14 where @xmath9 is the standard family of dyadic intervals , and @xmath15 is the _ parent _ of @xmath6 , that is , the smallest interval in @xmath9 strictly containing @xmath6 .",
    "globally doubling means that @xmath16 for @xmath17 and @xmath18 ; in particular , this implies @xmath19 .",
    "the main example for @xmath5 is the lebesgue measure @xmath20 , and the proofs in this particular case would differ little from the ones presented below .",
    "no _ a priori _ homogeneity is assumed of @xmath4 .",
    "i will use the following definition of the ( first ) wasserstein distance : given two radon measures measures @xmath21 on @xmath22 $ ] , set @xmath23 where the @xmath24 is taken over all @xmath25-lipschitz functions @xmath26 , which are supported on @xmath22 $ ] .",
    "such functions will be called _",
    "test functions_. a slightly different  and equally common  definition would allow the @xmath24 to run over all @xmath25-lipschitz functions @xmath27 \\to { \\mathbb{r}}$ ] .",
    "to illustrate the difference , let @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "then @xmath30 , but the alternative definition , say @xmath31 , would give @xmath32 .",
    "the only reason for using the definition @xmath33 in this paper is to make the results as strong as possible .    as in the paper @xcite of j. azzam , g. david and t. toro",
    ", i make the following definition :    [ alphas ] assume that @xmath2 is an interval .",

    "a variant of the @xmath44-numbers was first introduced by x. tolsa in @xcite , where he used them to characterise the uniform rectifiability of ahlfors - david regular measures in @xmath45 .",
    "tolsa s original definition was crafted only to compute distances between ahlfors - david regular measures , so it has a different `` normalisation '' than the one above .    before explaining the results in azzam , david and toro s paper @xcite , and their connection to the current manuscript , i want to emphasise that @xcite deals with `` @xmath46-dimensional '' measures in @xmath45 , for any @xmath47 . for the current paper ,",
    "only the case @xmath48 is relevant .",
    "so , to avoid digressing too much , i need to state the results of @xcite in far smaller generality than they would actually deserve .    with this proviso in mind ,",
    "the main results of @xcite imply the following .",
    "if @xmath4 is a doubling measure on @xmath1 , and the numbers @xmath49 satisfy a carleson condition of the form @xmath50 then @xmath4 , or at least a large part of @xmath4 , is absolutely continuous with respect to @xmath20 , with quantitative upper and lower bounds on the density . as the authors of @xcite point out , the main shortcoming of their result is that condition imposes a hypothesis on the first powers of the numbers @xmath49 , whereas evidence suggests ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* remark 1.6.1 ) , the discussion after ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 1.7 ) , and ( * ? ? ?",
    "* example 4.6 ) ) that the correct power should be two .",
    "more support for this conjecture comes from the following result of tolsa ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 1.3 ) : if @xmath51 , then @xmath52 i should again mention that this is only the easiest @xmath48 case of tolsa s theorem . also , @xmath53 is a slightly different variant of the @xmath44-number , but it seems very likely that the result is true with the present paper s conventions .    the purpose of this paper is to address the problem of azzam , david and toro in the simplest case @xmath48 .",
    "i show that control for the second powers of the @xmath49-numbers does , indeed , guarantee absolute continuity with respect to lebesgue measure .",
    "in fact , the doubling assumption on @xmath4 can be dropped , the carleson condition can be relaxed considerably , and the results remain valid , if @xmath20 is replaced by any doubling measure @xmath5 .",
    "i prove two variants of the main result : a dyadic , and a continuous , one .",
    "here is the dyadic version :    [ main ] assume that @xmath0 are borel probability measures on @xmath54 .",
    "assume that @xmath4 does not charge the boundaries of dyadic intervals , and @xmath5 is dyadically doubling on subintervals of @xmath54 .",
    "then , @xmath10 , where @xmath55 and @xmath56 is the square function @xmath57    in particular , @xmath58 heuristically , this corresponds to assuming only at the scale @xmath59 , but i have not found a way to * reduce * the the continuous problem to the dyadic one ; on the other hand , a reduction in the other direction does not appear easy , either , so perhaps one just needs to treat the cases separately . a caveat of the dyadic set - up is the `` non - atomicity '' hypothesis on @xmath4 . it can not be dispensed with : for instance , if @xmath60 for any @xmath61 , which only belongs to the interiors of finitely many dyadic intervals , then @xmath62 is uniformly bounded ( for instance @xmath63 ) , but clearly @xmath64 .",
    "the simplest solution would be to consider the wasserstein distance @xmath31 , but i will not pursue this matter further .    here is the continuous version of the main theorem :    [ maincont ] assume that @xmath0 are radon measures , and @xmath5 is globally doubling .",
    "then , @xmath10 , where @xmath65 and @xmath7 is the square function @xmath66    in case @xmath67 , the assumption on @xmath5 being globally doubling could be easily relaxed to being doubling in a neighbourhood of @xmath68 . in particular , if the carleson condition holds for some point @xmath69 and radius @xmath70 such that @xmath71 , and @xmath5 is doubling in @xmath72 , then @xmath73 .",
    "finally , assuming the full carleson condition , and that @xmath4 is globally doubling , the authors of @xcite prove something more quantitative than @xmath74 ; see in particular ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 1.9 ) .",
    "the same ought to be true for the second powers of the @xmath44-numbers , and indeed the following result can be easily deduced with the method of the current paper :    [ maincarleson ] assume that @xmath0 are borel probability measures on @xmath54 , both dyadically doubling on sub - intervals of @xmath54 , and assume that the carleson condition @xmath75 holds for some @xmath76 .",
    "then @xmath4 lies in the class @xmath77 , the dyadic @xmath78 class relative to @xmath5 .",
    "similarly , if @xmath0 are radon measures on @xmath1 , both globally doubling , and the carleson condition holds for the second powers @xmath79 , then @xmath12 .",
    "the _ a priori _ doubling assumptions can not be omitted ( that is , they are not implied by the carleson condition ) : just consider @xmath80 .",

    "most of the paper is concerned with the proof of the dyadic result , theorem [ main ] ; it is both conceptually and technically a little simpler than the proof of the `` continuous '' variant , theorem [ maincont ] , given in section [ continuousvariants ] .",
    "there is just one not - purely - technical difference between the arguments : the continuous case seems to require ( or at least benefit greatly from ) working initially with `` smooth '' variants of the @xmath44-numbers , to be introduced at the start of section [ continuousvariants ] .",
    "these are ( often ) dominated by the `` real '' @xmath44-numbers , but enjoy increased stability .",
    "the proof of theorem [ main ] has three main steps .",
    "first , the unwieldy numbers @xmath83 are used to control something analyst - friendlier , namely the following dyadic variants : @xmath84 here @xmath85 stands for the left half of @xmath6 .",
    "this would be simple , if @xmath86 happened to be one of the admissible test functions @xmath87 in the definition of @xmath33 .",
    "it is not , however , and in fact there seems to be no direct ( and sufficiently efficient ) way to control @xmath88 by @xmath83 , or even @xmath89 .",
    "however , it turns out that the numbers are equivalent at the level of certain carleson sums over trees ; proving this statement is the main content of section [ deltaalphacomparison ] .",
    "the numbers @xmath88 are well - known quantities : they are the ( absolute values of the ) coefficients in an orthogonal representation of @xmath4 in terms of @xmath5-adapted haar functions , and it is known that they can be used to characterise @xmath78 .",
    "the following theorem is due to s. buckley @xcite from 1993 :    [ bu ] let @xmath0 be a dyadically doubling borel probability measures on @xmath22 $ ] .",
    "then @xmath90 , if and only if @xmath91    the result in @xcite is only stated for @xmath92}$ ] , but the proof works in the greater generality .",
    "note the similarity between the carleson conditions and : the dyadic part of theorem [ maincarleson ] is , in fact , nothing but a corollary of buckley s result , assuming that one knows how to control the numbers @xmath88 by the numbers @xmath83 at the level of carleson sums ; consequently , the short proof of this half of theorem [ maincarleson ] can be found in section [ deltaalphacomparison ] .",
    "the `` continuous '' part is discussed at the end of the paper , in remark [ ainftyremark ] .",
    "buckley s result is not applicable for theorem [ main ] : the measure @xmath4 is not dyadically doubling , and the information available is much weaker than the carleson condition .",
    "handling these issues constitutes the remaining two steps in the proof : all dyadic intervals are split into trees , where @xmath4 is `` tree - doubling '' ( section [ mainproof ] ) , and the absolute continuity of @xmath4 with respect to @xmath5 is studied in each tree separately ( section [ treeabscont ] ) .",
    "i am grateful to jonas azzam , david bate , and antti kenmaki and for useful discussions during the preparation of the manuscript .",
