    "in the standard model , @xmath0 violating phenomena arise from a non - zero weak phase angle in a complex matrix allowing flavour violation in the weak interaction : the cabbibo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) matrix .",
    "although the source of @xmath0 violation has not been well understood up to now , physicists are striving to increase their knowledge of the mechanism .",
    "many theoretical studies  @xcite ( within and beyond the standard model ) and experimental investigations have been conducted since the discovery of @xmath0 violation in neutral kaon decays ( 1964 ) . according to theoretical predictions , large @xmath0 violating effects",
    "may be expected in @xmath22 meson decays . in the past few years , several facilities have started to collect events on @xmath22 decays and most of them refer to branching ratios .",
    "generally , the main theoretical uncertainties apart from the ckm matrix elements are the hadronic matrix elements , where non - factorizable effects are involved . as regards hadronic matrix elements and non - factorizable effects , a new qcd factorization approach  @xcite has been proposed .",
    "this qcd factorization approach includes all radiative diagrams ( gluon exchange ) but will not be the subject of this paper . for the ckm matrix elements , uncertainties in the parameters @xmath23 and @xmath24 have been reduced and this allows us to predict @xmath0 violating asymmetry in @xmath22 decays more accurately than before .",
    "this will give us an excellent test for the standard model and may lead to suggestions of new physics .",
    "direct @xmath0 violating asymmetries in @xmath22 decays occur through the interference of at least two amplitudes with different weak phase @xmath25 _ and _ strong phase @xmath26 . in order to extract the weak phase ( which is determined by the ckm matrix elements )",

    "in particular , it can lead to a large @xmath0 violation in @xmath22 decay such as @xmath27 , because the strong phase passes through @xmath28 at the @xmath12 resonance  @xcite .",
    "we have collected all the recent data for @xmath29 to @xmath30 transitions , but we shall focus on the cleo , babar and belle branching ratio results .",

    "the aim of the present work is to constrain the @xmath0 violating calculation in @xmath32 , including @xmath33 mixing and using the most recent experimental data for the branching ratios for @xmath34 decays . in order to extract the strong phase @xmath26",
    ", we use the naive factorization approach , in which the hadronic matrix elements of operators are saturated by vacuum intermediate states .",
    "moreover , we approximate non - factorizable effects by introducing an effective number of colours , @xmath6 . in this paper , we investigate five phenomenological models with different weak form factors and determine the @xmath0 violating asymmetry for @xmath35 in these models .",

    "we also discuss the model dependence of our results in detail .",
    "this paper is structured as follows . in section 2",
    ", we introduce the effective hamiltonian based on the operator product expansion ( ope ) including wilson coefficients .",
    "we also present the formalism of @xmath33 mixing and its application to the @xmath0 violating asymmetry in decay processes . in section 3 , the ckm matrix and the relevant form factors are discussed . in section 4 ,",
    "we present numerical results for the @xmath0 violating asymmetry in @xmath14 which is followed by discussion of these results . in section 5 , branching ratios for decays such as @xmath37 and @xmath5 are investigated . from the cleo , babar and belle experimental data for these branching ratios , we extract the range of @xmath6 allowed in these processes and the results are also discussed . in the final section , we summarize our results .",

    "the difference is related to the improvement in the measurement of the ckm matrix elements , and shows the strong effect of the ckm parameters , @xmath23 and @xmath24 , on limiting asymmetry values .    with regard to the ckm matrix elements",
    ", it appears that if we take their upper limit , we obtain a smaller asymmetry , @xmath7 , and vice - versa .",
    "as we found before , there is still a strong dependence of the @xmath0 violating asymmetry on the form factors .",
    "the difference between the two classes of models , @xmath207 and @xmath208 , comes mainly from the magnitudes of the form factors .",

    "the difference observed in our results between @xmath172 and @xmath174 arises from the @xmath148 dependence of the wilson coefficients in the weak effective hamiltonian .",

    "that is why the asymmetry also varies in some range of @xmath6 .",
    "it is obvious that a more accurate value for @xmath6 ( which requires a more accurate approach with non - factorizable effects being taken into account ) , and hadronic decay form factors ( which requires better understanding for pionic structure and the @xmath157 transition ) are needed in order to determine the ckm matrix elements .    in spite of all the uncertainties mentioned above",
    ", we stress that the @xmath33 mixing mechanism in the @xmath34 decay can be used to remove ambiguity concerning the sign of @xmath13 .",
    "as the internal top quark dominates the @xmath131 transition , the weak phase in the asymmetry is proportional to @xmath210 , where @xmath211 $ ] . hence knowing the sign of @xmath13 enables us to determine that of @xmath62 from a measurement of the asymmetry , @xmath7 . in fig .",

    "all the experimental values are summarized in table  [ tab6 ] .    in order to determine the range of @xmath6 , which is allowed by experimental data , we have calculated the branching ratios for @xmath257 , @xmath258 , @xmath259 , and @xmath260 .",
    "all the results are shown in figs .",
    "[ fig14 ] ,  [ fig15 ] ,  [ fig16 ] and  [ fig17 ] for the corresponding branching ratios listed above .",
    "results are plotted for models @xmath176 and @xmath184 , since they involve different form factor values and thus show their dependence on form factors . as experimental data",
    ", we shall use three sets of data from the cleo , babar and belle collaborations , respectively .",
    "since experimental branching ratios from cleo are the most accurate , we shall use them to extract the range of @xmath6 .",
    "the other two , the babar and belle data , will give us an idea of the magnitude of the experimental uncertainties .",
    "it is clear that numerical results are very sensitive to uncertainties coming from the experimental data .",
    "thus , the determination of the allowed range of @xmath6 will be done by using all the branching ratio results .",
    "let us start with the decay processes @xmath227 and @xmath261 . in both cases , there is a large range of acceptable values for @xmath6 and the ckm matrix elements over which the theoretical results are consistent with experimental data from cleo , babar and belle .",
    "for @xmath262 , the lack of data does not allow us to determine the range .",
    "however , experiment and theory are consistent in both cases . for @xmath227 ,",
    "the models show considerable variation even though they are all consistent with the experimental data . numerical results for models @xmath182 and @xmath183 are close , so are those for models @xmath184 and @xmath185 .",
    "we emphasise that the effect of @xmath33 mixing on the branching ratio @xmath257 can be as large as @xmath263 .",
    "as regards @xmath264 and @xmath228 , the results and conclusions are different from those for @xmath227 . if we look at the branching ratio for @xmath265 , only models @xmath184 and @xmath185 are consistent with experimental data over a large range of @xmath6 , whereas models @xmath182 and @xmath183 are not .",
    "the strong sensitivity to the results in that case comes from the fact that the decay branching ratios for @xmath266 depend on form factors more sensitively , because in this case only one form factor , @xmath209 , is involved . in all the other cases ,",
    "the amplitudes depend on both @xmath209 and @xmath267",
    ". therefore these branching ratios are less sensitive to the magnitude of the form factors .",
    "finally , for the branching ratio @xmath268 plotted in fig .  [ fig18 ] , all models give theoretical results consistent with experimental data . once again , the difference observed between models @xmath176 and @xmath184 mainly comes from the form factor @xmath209 ( i.e. from the pion wave function used ) .",
    "our analysis shows that models @xmath182 and @xmath183 can not give results consistent with all experiments and have to be excluded .    to remove systematic uncertainties coming from experimental results , one can calculate the ratio between two branching ratios for @xmath22 decays . in the present case ( with the data available ) ,",
    "the ratio , @xmath250 , is between @xmath269 and @xmath248 .",
    "results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig19 ] .",
    "we observe that the ratios differ totally from each other for models @xmath182 and @xmath183 and models @xmath184 and @xmath185 . since models @xmath182 and @xmath183 have already been excluded , we will use models @xmath184 and @xmath185 for the determination of the range for @xmath6 .",
    "if we just include tree contributions in the decay amplitudes , @xmath250 becomes independent of the ckm matrix elements .",
    "penguin contributions lead to a relatively weak dependence of @xmath250 on the ckm matrix elements . by comparing numerical results and experimental data ,",
    "we are now able to extract a range for @xmath6 which is consistent with all the results . to determine the best range of @xmath6 , we select the values of @xmath6 which are allowed by all constraints for each model . finally , after excluding models @xmath182 and @xmath183 for the obvious reasons mentioned before , we can now fix the upper and the lower limit of the range of @xmath6 ( table  [ tab15 ] ) .",
    "we find that @xmath6 should be in the range @xmath36 for @xmath179 .",
    "comparing with our previous study , the current range of @xmath6 is consistent but smaller than the previous one .",
    "the first aim of the present work was to compare theoretical branching ratios for @xmath270 , @xmath271 , @xmath259 and @xmath260 with experimental data from the cleo , babar and belle collaborations . the second was to apply recent values of the ckm matrix elements , e.g. @xmath272 and @xmath23 , to study direct @xmath0 violation for @xmath22 decay such as @xmath273 , where the @xmath33 mixing mechanism must be included .",
    "the advantage of including @xmath33 mixing is that the strong phase difference which is necessary for direct @xmath0 violation , is large and rapidly varying near the @xmath12 resonance . as a result , the @xmath0 violating asymmetry , @xmath7 , reaches a maximum , @xmath169 , when the invariant mass of the @xmath11 pair is in the vicinity of the @xmath12 resonance and @xmath274 at this point .    in our approach , we started from the weak effective hamiltonian where short distance and long distance physics are separated and treated by a perturbative approach ( wilson coefficients ) and a non - perturbative approach ( operator product expansion ) , respectively .",
    "one of the main uncertainties introduced in our calculation comes from the hadronic matrix elements for both tree and penguin operators .",
    "we treated them by applying a naive factorization approximation , where @xmath6 is taken as an effective parameter .",
    "although this is clearly an approximation , it has been pointed out  @xcite that it may be quite reliable in energetic weak decays such as @xmath34 .",
    "we have investigated the direct @xmath0 violating asymmetry in the @xmath22 decay : @xmath275 .",
    "we found that the @xmath0 violation parameter , @xmath7 , is very sensitive to the parameters @xmath23 and @xmath24 in the ckm matrix , and also to the magnitude of the form factors appearing in the five phenomenological models we investigated .",
    "we have calculated the maximum asymmetry , @xmath169 , as a function of the effective parameter , @xmath6 , with the limiting values of the ckm matrix elements .",
    "we found that the @xmath0 violating asymmetry , @xmath169 , can vary from @xmath276 to @xmath277 over all the models @xmath278 .",
    "as we already suggested in a previous study  @xcite , the ratio between the asymmetries for limiting values of the ckm matrix elements is mainly governed by @xmath24 .",
    "previously , we found a ratio equal to @xmath279 where the ckm values used were the following : @xmath280 , @xmath281 , and @xmath282 . in the present work",
    ", we found for the same decay , a ratio equal to @xmath283 .",
    "the more accurate value for @xmath24 has reduced uncertainties on both the @xmath0 violating asymmetry and the ratio , @xmath284 .",
    "moreover , we stressed that without the @xmath3 mixing mechanism , the @xmath0 violating asymmetry , @xmath7 ( which is proportional to both @xmath285 and @xmath63 ) , is small since in that case either @xmath13 or @xmath63 is small . in the allowed range of @xmath6",
    ", we also found that the sign of @xmath13 is always positive .",
    "therefore , by measuring @xmath7 , we can remove the phase mod(@xmath122 ) ambiguity which occurs in the usual method for the determination of the ckm unitarity angle @xmath16 .",
    "we have calculated branching ratios for @xmath257 , @xmath286 , @xmath259 and @xmath287 and compared the results with experimental data coming from the cleo , babar and belle collaborations .",
    "we have shown that for models @xmath184 and @xmath185 there is a range for @xmath6 , @xmath36 , in which theoretical results are consistent with experimental data .",
    "models @xmath182 and @xmath183 are excluded since the form factor @xmath209 in these models can not produce results consistent with experiment . for a deeper investigation into this problem , some resonant and non - resonant contributions  @xcite which may carry bigger effects than expected in the calculation of branching ratios in @xmath288 may have to be considered seriously .    with more accurate ckm matrix elements values , e.g. @xmath23 and @xmath24 , we are able to give more precise @xmath0 violating asymmetries , and the main uncertainties remaining are from the factorization  @xcite approach and the hadronic decay form factors . in the future",
    "one may hope to use qcd factorization to replace the effective parameter , @xmath6 , and hence to provide a more reliable treatment of non - factorizable effects . with regard to form factors ,",
    "we have shown that some models for the @xmath157 transition are not consistent with the experimental branching ratios .",
    "we expect that our predictions will provide useful guidance for future investigations in @xmath22 decays .",
    "we look forward to even more accurate experimental data from our experimental colleagues in order to further constrain our theoretical results and hence , to further advance the determination of the ckm parameters @xmath23 and @xmath24 and our understanding of @xmath0 violation within or beyond the standard model .        99 a.b .",
