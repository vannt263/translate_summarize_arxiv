    "in @xcite it was found that the distances on a one dimensional lattice in a noncommutative geometry differ from their classical analog . in noncommutative geometry the distances on a one dimensional lattice are given by @xmath0 where @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 is the lattice constant , with units of length .    as can be seen directly , the distance to an odd @xmath4 point has a unit anomaly , whereas the distance to an even @xmath4 point is the geometric mean of the distances to the two nearby odd points .",
    "moreover , we note that translation invariance is broken , since @xmath5 . in the large @xmath4 limit , however , translation invariance is restored asymptotically .",
    "+ the fact that the distances given by ( eq.[dist ] ) thus break the lattice s translation invariance , represents a new phenomenon of a distance s dependence on reference frames .",
    "it follows directly from the basic fact that all the distances in ( eq.[dist ] ) were computed from some zero point , which the lattice sites labeling is been referred to .",
    "the selection of one of the lattice point as the zero point , was done without loss of generality .",
    "therefore , _ if several spectators are present on the lattice sites , with each spectator defining his location as the zero point in his own world , then due to the different sites labeling by different spectators , the distance between two lattice sites becomes reference frames dependent .",
    "_    we may thus define the distance between the @xmath6-th and @xmath7-th sites , as been labeled in some reference frame as the absolute value of the difference between the distances i.e.    @xmath8    we remind the reader of the reason for the introduction of a new definition of distance in noncommutative geometry .",
    "it follows from the fact that the classical definition uses the concept of a _ path _ , i.e. @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the length of the path @xmath11 connecting points @xmath3 and @xmath12 .",
    "the infimum is taken over all such path lengths .",
    "however , the concept of a path is only well defined on a smooth manifold .",
    "one is thus forced to apply the noncommutative geometry definition , which is more fundamental than the classical , and more general , since it fits all topological spaces .",
    "this definition of a distance in noncommutative geometry is given by@xcite : @xmath13 \\;\\right\\| \\leq 1\\right\\}\\ ] ] where @xmath14  @xmath15 is the algebra of functions on @xmath16  @xmath17 is a dirac operator ( which is a self adjoint operator with compact resolvent ) acting in the hilbert space @xmath18  and the norm on the r.h.s is the norm of operators in @xmath19 .",
    "both definitions give the same result when the base space is a riemannian manifold .",
    "however the n.c.g definition has the advantage of being applicable to discrete spaces too .",
    "+ noncommutative geometry , from its foundation was constructed in such a way that it fits the concepts used in quantum mechanics - mainly the passage from variables to operators .",
    "more details about the connection to q.m . can be found in @xcite .",
    "+ in that context the reader should not be surprised that we were led to the concept of reference - frames - dependent distances . not with standing its novelty , what can be more natural in q.m .",
    "than an influence of the observer on the results ?",
    "we believe that a similar phenomenon will be revealed in a full theory of quantum gravity when this will be found .    in the following ,",
    "we analyze some of the possible physical implications of the above result .",
    "assume a one dimensional lattice with lattice constant  @xmath3 .",
    "on the lattice there are a _ spectator _ and a _ test particle ( t.p.)_. we assume that the spectator sticks to one site , which serves as the zero reference point in the spectator s system , from which distances are measured on the lattice .",
    "the t.p . has a mass @xmath20 and is situated at a site @xmath6 .",
    "the dynamics of the t.p . on the lattice are characterized by a hopping motion from site to site on the lattice , where for each jump to occur there is some probability .",
    "such dynamics are particularly appropriate in a scenario in which the system is a quantum system , in analogy with the motion of a particle between discrete energy levels .",
    "note that the dynamics on the lattice can not be `` smooth '' , i.e. the t.p .",
    "can jump between two lattice sites without `` passing '' through the intermediate sites , as in jumps between bohr s orbits for atomic electrons .",
    "essentially , such hopping dynamics are known from solid state physics ( e.g. mott hopping conductance , also connected to percolation theory @xcite ) .",
    "quantum behavior is very much in the spirit of dynamics in a noncommutative geometry .",
    "two questions now arise .",
    "first , how do we treat _ time _ ?",
    "the second question relates to the _ probabilities _ for the test particle s hops  how do we go about evaluating them ?",
    "as we shall see , there are three possible answers ( and perhaps even more ) for the first question .",
    "the first possible answer would claim that there might be no need at all for an answer , since one can deal with probabilities without involving time dependence , in the same way as one deals with the probabilities in dice , namely , without caring about the rate at which the dice are thrown .",
    "thus , in this solution , the jumps rate does not affect the probabilities .",
    "however , having in mind physical models and not just mathematical ones , we believe that the question can not be eliminated .",
    "the second possible answer is that time is an extra dimension , as is usually done .",
    "thus the total spacetime is @xmath21 or @xmath22 , depending on whether the time is continuous or discrete , respectively .",
    "but , since the results for the distances on a lattice which we use here are taken only for the one- dimensional case , and the distances on those two - dimensional spaces could be different from what we use , we prefer not to adopt this answer .",
    "thus , although the second answer might be the correct one physically , we select for our purposes the following third answer , which enables us also to apply our result ( [ dist ] ) for the distances .",
    "this third answer consists in using our quantum hops to define and measure time intervals , in the spectator system . _ to measure time , we count the t.p .",
    "jumps_. in this context , time is not an extra dimension , but rather a parameterization defined by counting , similar to the counting of the vibrations of the quartz in a digital watch .",
    "although some vibrations might have longer periods ( as measured by counting the vibrations of a more accurate watch ) time can still be defined as the result of an exact counting of the vibrations .      to determine the probabilities for the t.p.s hops on the lattice",
    ", we first examine the propagator of a free boson on a translation - invariant space :  @xmath23 .",
    "the fourier transform of this propagator is essentially the correlation function between different locations in the coordinate space .",
    "it seems reasonable to take the correlation function between two different sites as proportional to the probability of a jump between them : the more they are correlated , the stronger the chances for the t.p . to make that jump . working with a one - dimensional lattice , we take the one - dimensional fourier transform of the propagator",
    ". the probabilities will thereby be of the form : @xmath24 where @xmath25(@xmath20 - is the t.p .",
    "mass , and @xmath3 is the lattice constant ) , @xmath6 and @xmath26 are the initial and the final sites of the t.p .",
    "relative to the spectator , @xmath27 , and @xmath28 is the normalization of the probabilities . remembering that the lattice translation invariance is broken and only reached asymptotically - we take the above expression for the probabilities only as a first guess , a form that they should roughly follow .",
    "the normalization is given by the following formula : @xmath29 note that for @xmath30 the t.p .",
    "is initially situated at the same site as the spectator .    as can be immediately seen , if @xmath31 is a constant , the hopping probabilities for the t.p . as seen in the spectator s frame",
    "differ from those evaluated in the t.p .",
    "this is a direct outcome of the fact that @xmath32 where the l.h.s is the distance as observed in the spectator frame and the r.h.s is the distance as observed in the t.p . frame . in the following section ,",
    "we discuss the meaning of this incompatibility between the probabilities in the two systems , and ways of resolving this difficulty .",
    "a closer look at the distances involved will reveal that for a t.p .",
    "initially situated at an even site @xmath33 , the most probable jump , as evaluated in the spectator frame is to the site @xmath34 ( i.e. @xmath35 ) . if the t.p .",
    "was initially located at the site @xmath36 , the most probable jump , as evaluated in the spectator frame is to @xmath37 ( i.e. @xmath38 ) . however in the t.p .",
    "own frame , there is no difference in the probabilities for jumps to the left or to the right .",
    "another anomaly which is an outcome of the above incompatibility can be seen when inspecting distances between sites whose indices differ by two units . though the distance between two neighboring odd points is always @xmath39 ( except for @xmath40 ) , the distances between two neighboring even points form a decreasing series , tending to @xmath39 , when @xmath41 . in the spectator frame , the effective probability for the test particle s motion will thus be larger in an outward direction ( relative to the spectator ) , i.e. the t.p .",
    "_ drifts away_. in the t.p .",
    "frame , however , as there is no difference between its two sides , the t.p . should just stay in its initial position ( on the average ) .",
    "note , moreover , that different spectators - located each at a different lattice site ( i.e. with different origins in their respective frames ) - will observe different probability distributions .",
    "though the probability space in the t.p .",
    "frame is a commutative space ( in the sense that when defining @xmath42  as the probability of jumping @xmath7 sites to the right , then @xmath43 ) , it is noncommutative in the spectator frame , where @xmath44 .",
    "this point summarizes the inconsistencies between the two frames .    since the probabilities are thus not the same , whether between spectator and t.p .",
    "frames , or between two spectator frames , applying our `` third option '' as defined in section 2.1 , we observe that _ the time intervals are not synchronized_. we thus set upon removing the anomalies by an appropriate corrective mechanism .",
    "all above anomalies were obtained under the assumption that the mass - @xmath20 , of the t.p .",
    "is the same in both the spectator and the t.p . frames .",
    "our solution is to abandon the assumption that the t.p .",
    "mass is a global parameter and assume instead that it is a local variable . in the following we demonstrate that this is a complete resolution of our paradoxes .",
    "we require the probabilities @xmath45 and @xmath46 to be equal in both spectator and t.p .",
    "frames , i.e. using localized masses , we restore translation invariance for the probability of hopping @xmath47sites .      where @xmath49 is the mass of the t.p . as observed in the spectator frame , while hopping from the @xmath6 site to the @xmath26 site , and @xmath50 is the mass in the t.p .",
    "the normalization constant @xmath51 is defined as : @xmath52 where we are using ( [ dist])[see figure 1 in the appendix ] , thus normalizing the probabilities ( i.e. @xmath53 ) .",
    "as one can see , equation([mass2 ] ) can not be analytically solved for @xmath55 , but if one assumes for simplicity that : @xmath56 one finds from ( [ prob2 ] ) that the mass as seen by the spectator is given by @xmath57 } \\approx \\mu _ 0\\left [ 1-a\\mu _ 0\\left ( \\left| x_{i+j}-x_i\\right| -\\left| x_j\\right| \\right ) \\right ]   \\label{mass}\\ ] ]    we emphasize that if one assigns planck - length value @xmath58  to the lattice constant @xmath3 ( i.e. @xmath59  ) , then the limit ( [ limit ] ) should be interpreted as the low mass limit @xmath60  , where @xmath61 is a planck - mass ( i.e. @xmath62 ) .",
    "thus , the mass formula ( [ mass ] ) should be seen as semi - classical .    by setting the probabilities to be equal in the two frames",
    ", we are essentially synchronizing the relevant times - applying our definition of time intervals , based on counting jumps .",
    "the price , however , has been paid by the transformation of the mass @xmath63 into a local and dynamical variable - @xmath64 ( local and dynamical because of the @xmath6 and the @xmath7 dependence respectively ) .",
    "there is a very rough analogy with the emergence of the doppler effect in special relativity .",
    "however , whereas in the doppler effect the frequency of a wave emitted by a system moving towards the spectator is blue - shifted , i.e. always increases in the spectator frame , in our case , the t.p .",
    "mass as observed in the spectator frame @xmath64 can be smaller than @xmath50 , even when the t.p .",
    "jump is directed towards the spectator .",
    "the fact that the physical mass @xmath64 depends on the lattice constant @xmath3 , aside from its dependence on @xmath63 and on the location , suggests that @xmath64 depends on the scale .",
    "this behavior allows us to think of the mass as a `` running mass '' , as happens in the context of the renormalization procedure in field theory ( see figure 2 in the appendix ) .    adopting the above concept of a local mass , we have thus achieved full agreement between the spectator and t.p .",
    "probability values .",
    "there is thus also a synchronization of time measurements between the frames , and there is no preferred direction on the lattice .      instead of modifying the kinematics , by constraining the mass to be a local variable , in our effort at restoring covariant dynamics for the t.p .",
    ", we could use an alternative , `` dynamical '' approach , by introducing potentials . with the distances on the lattice",
    "not being translation invariant , the propagator of a boson particle situated at the @xmath65 site ( in the spectator frame ) could be written in terms of a potential @xmath66 , , @xmath67 ^{-1 }   \\label{propagator}\\ ] ] where @xmath68 is induced by the metric defined in ( [ dist ] ) and ( [ disij ] ) .  as we demonstrated , this is , on the average , a repulsive force ,        _ an induced attractive potential @xmath70  _ which will exactly cancel _ @xmath68 .",
    "this is somewhat reminiscent of einstein s 1917 introduction of the cosmological constant , to stabilize the universal geometry .",
    "the propagator of the t.p . in all spectator frames are now the same as for a free particle @xmath71 ^{-1}$ ] .",
    "the existence of the induced potential , in some aspects , is also similar to the lentz law in classical electromagnetism .",
    "_    one can identify the modified mass in ( [ prob2 ] ) with the following effective mass , defined as : @xmath72 in other words , one can deduce from @xmath49 the value of the induced potential between the t.p . and the spectator ( in the low mass limit ( [ limit ] ) one can use ( [ mass ] ) and ( [ effmass ] ) ) .    summarizing this approach , we note that though the distances break translation invariance and while the mass preserves its global definition , the hopping probabilities  and the related beats of the clock  have become translation invariant . + summary + we have shown that the induced metric of a one - dimensional lattice , ( from a noncommutative geometry calculation ) breaks the lattice translation invariance and therefore also becomes reference - frame dependent , possibly leading to some paradoxes concerning the fundamental issue of general covariance .",
    "we have suggested a solution of the paradoxes , essentially at the probabilistic level - which in our opinion is the most important aspect , at least from the measurement aspects of quantum mechanics .",
    "it was done by either allowing an effective locally dependent mass which thus becomes a `` running mass '' , or by introducing a compensating potential .",
    "both ways lead to a commutative probabilistic space which is general covariant .",

    "yuval neeman for the enlightening comments .",
    "i would like also to thank the anonymous referee for his constructive suggestions .",

    "the hilbert space basis @xmath79  is defined as follows : @xmath80 where the @xmath7 -index stands for a state in the hilbert space , while the @xmath81 -index stands for the lattice site .",
