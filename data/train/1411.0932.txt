    "starbursts induced by major mergers are among the most extreme environments in the universe . despite their prodigious luminosities ,",
    "local merger - driven starbursts are very compact , with most of their large gas reservoirs concentrated in dusty regions a few hundred parsecs , or less , in size .",
    "measuring the compactness of these starbursts is critical to understanding these galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "robust size measurements allow us to translate luminosities into key physical quantities such as gas column density , optical depth , volumetric gas density , and star formation rate and luminosity surface densities .",
    "although their luminosity renders them visible out to great distances , the present - day rarity of major mergers means that even the nearest ultra - luminous infrared galaxies ( ulirgs : defined as having @xmath22 \\geq 10^{12}~l_{\\odot}}$ ] ) are relatively distant ( @xmath23 70  mpc ) .",
    "thus , measuring the true extent of their active regions requires high angular resolution .",
    "the extraordinary extinctions present in these systems at both long ( from free - free absorption ) and short ( from dust opacity ) wavelengths complicate the interpretation of measurements at both wavelengths , compounding the difficulty of measuring sizes for such systems .    given the above considerations , radio observations at centimeter wavelengths may be the best tool to study the deeply embedded , compact structures at the heart of such systems ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "radio interferometers can achieve very high angular resolution and radio waves with @xmath24 5  ghz can penetrate large columns of dust and are largely unaffected by free - free absorption .",
    "the recent upgrades to the karl g. jansky very large array ( vla ) make it particularly well - suited for such studies . in this paper , we make use of these new vla capabilities to achieve the best measurement to date of the structure of the nuclear region of the nearest ulirg , arp 220 .    at a luminosity distance of 77.2 mpc , and an infrared luminosity of @xmath25 = 1.44 \\times 10^{12}~l_{\\odot}}$ ] , from ned ; @xmath26 using table 1 in and iras flux densities from @xcite .",
    "however , note that the assumption of isotropic emission that leads to this luminosity has some caveats ( see section [ sec : ir ] and appendix [ app : flux ] ) . ]",
    "arp 220 is the nearest ulirg .",
    "co and near - ir observations indicate that arp 220 is a gas rich merger with dynamical masses of @xmath27 within @xmath5  100 pc of each nucleus .",
    "arp 220 is obscured at optical through mid - ir wavelengths @xcite , obstructing the direct view of the nuclear energy sources at these wavelengths .",
    "observations in the frequency range where arp 220 is optically thin have been able to resolve the system into two compact nuclear disks and find disk sizes of @xmath5 02 .",
    "however , in each case the measured sizes remain comparable to the size of the beam .",
    "vlbi observations at cm wavelengths by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite provide a higher resolution view , recovering a compact distribution of point - like sources that are proposed to be a combination of radio supernovae ( rsne ) and supernova remnants ( snrs ) .",
    "however , these observations resolve out most of the emission from the disks . from the above",
    ", it is already clear that the disks are very compact , implying extraordinary volume densities and surface densities .",
    "the next step is to observe the disks in the optically thin frequency range with resolution high enough to clearly resolve them , and sensitivity to recover the full extent of the emission of the system at that frequency range .    in this paper",
    ", we measure the structure of the arp 220 nuclei with sensitive , high angular resolution images obtained at 6 ghz and 33 ghz observed with the vla . based on the integrated spectral energy distribution ( sed ) model of arp 220 ( see figure 10b in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the total continuum flux density at 33 ghz is a mixture of thermal and non - thermal emission with a @xmath5 1:2 ratio , while at 6 ghz this ratio is about 1:5 .",
    "observing at these two frequencies then helps us diagnose the dominant emission mechanism at radio wavelengths in arp 220 .",
    "we first report our observations , describe the calculations used to assess the disk structure , and then discuss the implications of our measurements . throughout this paper ,",
    "we adopt @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 ( after correction to the cmb frame ) , such that 1  on the sky plane subtends 369 pc at the distance of arp 220 .",
    "we observed arp 220 using the vla c ( 4 - 8 ghz ) and ka band ( 26.5 - 40 ghz ) receivers , recording emission in 1 ghz wide windows centered at @xmath5 4.7 , 7.2 , 29 and 36 ghz .",
    "we used all four vla configurations with a total integration time ratio of 1:1:2:4 between d ( lowest resolution ) , c , b , and a. the total on - source integration time was 40 min at c band and 56 min at ka band .",
    "we used 3c 286 as the flux density and bandpass calibrator , and j1513 + 2338 and j1539 + 2744 as the complex gain calibrators at c and ka bands , respectively .",
    "the data were obtained in multiple observing sessions during the period 2010 august 18 to 2011 july 2 , with the c and ka band observations carried out in separate sessions .",
    "these observations are part of a larger project ; the lower resolution ( c and d configuration ) results are presented in @xcite and @xcite , and the final results for the complete sample will be reported in barcos - muoz et al .",
    "( in prep . ) .",
    "we reduced the data using the common astronomy software application ( casa , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) package following the standard procedure for vla data .",
    "radio frequency interference ( rfi ) contaminating the c band was eliminated using the task ` flagdata ` in mode ` rflag ` .",
    "the rfi at ka band was negligible .",
    "after calibration , we combined the data from all configurations , weighting them in proportion to their integration time per visibility ( i.e. , 10:5:2:1 for d : c : b : a ) .",
    "we then imaged this combined data using the task ` clean ` in mode ` mfs ` @xcite , with _",
    "briggs _ weighting setting ` robust=0.5 ` .",
    "we combined all the data within each receiver band and cleaned using components with a variable spectral index ( ` nterms=2 ` ) to obtain an interpolated image at an intermediate frequency ( 5.95 ghz for c band and 32.5 ghz for ka band ) . even after the initial calibration , we still observed phase and amplitude variations with time . to improve the images further , we iteratively self - calibrated in both phase and amplitude and applied extra flagging during this procedure as needed .",
    "the solutions for the amplitude self - calibration were carefully inspected and accepted as long as the time variations in the amplitude gains for each antenna were less than @xmath5  20% .",
    "we worked mostly with these `` combined '' images at 5.95 and 32.5 ghz , but we also separately imaged the two  1  ghz windows at c band in order to derive a robust internal c band spectral index .    to check our results , we imaged the 33  ghz data separately for each vla configuration . in this test",
    ", we primarily applied iterative phase self - calibration .",
    "amplitude self - calibration was applied ( after @xmath32@xmath33 iterations of phase self - calibration ) , but here we only derived normalized solutions that can not change the observed flux . during this check",
    ", we also experimented with weighting the visibilities by the measured rms noise in each data set ( using the casa task ` statwt ` ) .",
    "these tests revealed that the combined a+b ( two most extended ) configurations recovered essentially all of the flux in the data , agreeing with the c and d data in both flux and morphology when convolved to matched resolution .",
    "the a configuration data alone recovered less flux than the b configuration , consistent with some spatial filtering at this highest resolution .",
    "further , the overall flux recovered agrees with an interpolation of the integrated sed @xcite .",
    "we proceed using the full combined image with our confidence in the results reinforced by these tests ; we verified that our fitting yields consistent results using the combined image and the a+b configuration - only image .",
    "the clean restoring beam for the combined images has a fwhm of 048 @xmath0 035 ( 177 @xmath0 129 pc ) at position angle ( p.a . ) of -40@xmath34 at 6 ghz ( c band ) , and 0081 @xmath0 0063 ( 30 @xmath0 23 pc ) at a p.a . of 65@xmath34 at 32.5 ghz ( ka band ) .",
    "the rms noise measured from signal - free parts of the image is @xmath35jy  beam@xmath36 ( c ) and @xmath37jy  beam@xmath36 ( ka ) , which is within a factor of two of the expected theoretical noise .",
    "the final dynamic ranges of the images are @xmath38 and @xmath5 280 , for c and ka band .    when reporting the measured flux densities from the final images , we consider three sources of uncertainty .",
    "first , we propagated the beam - to - beam noise ( see above ) and found its effect to be negligible at both bands .",
    "second , we assessed the impact of the curve - of - growth technique used to measure the flux densities ( see section [ sec : calc ] ) by using the scatter of such a curve .",
    "this is also small , but larger for the individual nuclei because they are not perfectly separable . finally , we estimated the uncertainty in the overall flux density calibration from the day - to - day variation of the flux density of the complex gain calibrator .",
    "this scatter ( rms ) is @xmath5 12% at ka band , making the flux density calibration the dominant source of uncertainty at this band . at c band ,",
    "the scatter in the curves of growth and the variation in the flux density calibration are comparable , i.e. , @xmath5 1% .",
    "we sum all three uncertainty terms in quadrature and report the combined value in table [ tbl-1 ] .",
    "note that in addition to these uncertainties , the absolute flux scale used at the vla is estimated to be uncertain by @xmath39 .",
    "after reducing the data , we compared our 33 ghz image to vla @xcite , sma @xcite and alma archival images ( * ? ? ? * and scoville et al . _ in prep _ ) .",
    "we found astrometric discrepancies of order 01 ( i.e. , 12 beams ) and traced the origin of these to the adopted position of our 33  ghz phase calibrator .",
    "when revised from the nominal vla position to the position reported in the vlbi calibrator catalog , the astrometric agreement between our image and the other images improved to a fraction of a beam . for reference , in our data",
    "the peak positions of the two nuclei at 33 ghz are @xmath40 , @xmath41 ( east ) and @xmath42 , @xmath43 ( west ) .",
    "we derive these position via a gaussian fit ( casa s imfit ) but they also closely coincide with the positions of the highest intensity pixel for each nucleus . the uncertainties in the peak positions above may also be viewed as our overall astrometric uncertainty , which we derive from the standard deviation between the positions of the highest intensity pixels from our 6 ghz image and our shifted 33 ghz image , and the archival images from @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and scoville et al .",

    "note that these rings oversample the @xmath5 007 beam , so that adjacent bins in figure [ fig2 ] are not independent .",
    "we normalized the rsn / snr radial profile to match the 33  ghz profile at @xmath83 .",
    "the plotted error bars were calculated from the standard deviation of the flux within each annulus divided by the square root of the area in that annulus expressed in units of the beam size ( i.e. , the number of independent beams ) .    in figure [ fig2 ] , we show that the exponential model matches the data well for both nuclei , matching slightly better for the western nucleus . meanwhile , the gaussian profile is not as good as the exponential profile when compared to the observed data , being particularly poorer in the outer parts of the disks .",
    "the linearity of the semilog profiles also confirms ( and motivates ) our adoption of an exponential functional form .",
    "the rsn / snr radial profiles mostly follow the integrated radio emission profiles ( and thus also the model ) . the agreement is better in the western nucleus .",
    "the eastern nucleus lacks a bright central peak and shows a somewhat more scattered distribution , which could be caused by stochasticity and timescale effects ; i.e. , there just may not be enough rsne / snrs visible to give a smooth appearance ( compare to figure [ fig1]d to see the clumpy nature of the sne distribution ) .",

    "we also calculated the peak @xmath84 at each band from the peak flux density and the area of the clean beam at each frequency .",

    "there is a large scale agreement between the locations of radio continuum emission , co , and rsne / snrs , suggesting that the sizes of the radio continuum sources may be viewed as characteristic of the system .",

    "the high brightness temperature of a few @xmath0 @xmath100  k , inferred at 6 ghz by using the 33 ghz nuclear sizes , argues in this direction .",
    "this high brightness temperature can not come from hii regions , even if they are completely opaque , because in a purely thermal environment , the electron temperature of such regions should not exceed @xmath100  k. if we combined the high brightness temperature with the observed internal c band spectral index of the total system , @xmath101 , we infer that most of the emission at 6 ghz is synchrotron .",
    "the spectral index between 6 and 33 ghz , @xmath102 , matches the internal c band @xmath49 of the total system within the errors ; the same is true for the two nuclei separately ( see table [ tbl-1 ] ) .",
    "the similarity between @xmath103 and @xmath104 indicates no significant spectral flattening between 6 and 33 ghz , suggesting that synchrotron dominates the emission across this range of frequencies . reinforcing this point ,",
    "our total flux density and spectral index agree with the predictions made by @xcite ( see their figure 10b ) .",
    "they found synchrotron emission to dominate below @xmath105 ghz , and estimated the thermal fraction at 6 ghz and 33 ghz to be @xmath5  15% and 35% , respectively .",
    "if we assume a non - thermal spectral index of @xmath106 ( see table 9 in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and a typical thermal spectra index of @xmath107 , we obtain @xmath108 and @xmath109 , which is consistent with what we measure and with our observation of a constant spectral index from 6 to 33 ghz .",
    "this result is also consistent with previous results showing lower thermal fractions at 33 ghz for merging starbursts compared to normal galaxies @xcite .",
    "the overall star formation rate of the system provides an alternate way to estimate the expected thermal radio continuum emission .",
    "beginning with the ir ( 8 to 1000 @xmath72 m ) luminosity of arp 220 , we estimate the expected thermal luminosity of the system if the ir is all due to star formation by following star formation rate conversions from table 8 in @xcite and assuming an electron temperature of 7500  k @xcite .",
    "this approach predicts a thermal fraction of @xmath5 55% at 33 ghz and @xmath5 20% at 6 ghz .",
    "this is in good agreement with the thermal fraction at 33 ghz obtained in @xcite for a prototypical starburst , m82 .",
    "however , if we derive the expected spectral index as we did at the end of the previous paragraph ( assuming 55% of thermal fraction at 33 ghz ) , we obtain @xmath110 and @xmath111 , which deviates considerably from what we observe between 6 and 33 ghz .",
    "note that @xmath103 does not vary significantly from what we observe , this is due to the small thermal fraction expected at this frequency range .",
    "the easiest explanation for the lower - than expected thermal flux is that a significant fraction of the ionizing photons produced by young stars are absorbed by dust before they produce ionizations .",
    "this would lower the free - free estimate in the calculation .",
    "we estimate that to match our observations , we would require that at least 20% of the ionizing photons be absorbed by dust .",
    "this number seems plausible for an environment as dust embedded as arp 220 ( see section [ sec : od ] ) and is consistent with some of the arguments made when considering the apparent deficit of ir cooling line emission ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "alternatively , an imf that produces more bolometric light ( and thus ir and likely sne ) relative to ionizing photons could resolve the discrepancy .",
    "that is , we could invoke an `` intermediate - heavy '' imf compared to that used in @xcite .",
    "we could also reconcile our two estimates if the synchrotron spectral slope decays drastically between 6 and 33 ghz , so that the apparent 33 - 6 ghz index is a combination of very steep , curving synchrotron and emerging thermal emission .",
    "however , this would require that thermal emission make up most of the sed at higher frequencies , which is not observed ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "our best interpretation of the data is that the 33 ghz emission is mostly synchrotron , in mild contrast with a typical starburst galaxy ( see figure 1 in * ? ? ?",
    "we suggest that the most likely cause is the suppression of thermal radio emission as dust absorbs ionizing photons .      in figure [ fig1]b , we show the 6 ghz emission is largely co - spatial with co emission .",
    "the 6 ghz emission is our more sensitive band , with a beam nearly matched to the co , and  as just discussed  we expect that it traces the same synchrotron emission as the 33 ghz .",
    "the co and 6 ghz emission cover roughly the same area , have broadly coincident peaks , and both show an extended faint feature to the southwest ( * ? ? ?",
    "* note a similar coincidence between 18 cm emission and the arp 220 starburst traced in the near - ir ) .",
    "the distributions of co and 6 ghz emission do significantly differ in detail .",
    "the ratio of fluxes for the two nuclei is 1:2 ( east : west ) for co and almost 1:1 for continuum . in the west nucleus , the morphology is more centrally concentrated at 6 ghz compared to the co map .",
    "some of these differences may reflect real differences between the current gas reservoir and recent star formation , but they may also reflect temperature and optical depth effects .",
    "the co ( 3@xmath442 ) emission in this region shows good evidence for optical thickness @xcite , and the densities are high enough that the gas temperature will be likely coupled to the dust ( @xmath112  k).therefore , making a straightforward interpretation of the co in terms of column density is challenging .",
    "we draw the broad conclusion from figure [ fig1]b that the synchrotron originates from the same region as , and in very rough proportion to , the molecular gas supply .",
    "a similar situation is also observed on smaller spatial scales by the comparison of the rsn / snr number density map to the 33 ghz map ( see figure [ fig1]d ) .",
    "the distributions are co - spatial , but the continuum map appears smoother than the map made from individual rsn / snr .",
    "this is particularly evident in the eastern nucleus , where the covering fraction of vlba point sources is small  perhaps a result of stochasticity in the rate and lifetime of sn visible using vlbi measurements .",
    "the radial profiles in figure [ fig2 ] highlight the quantitative agreement between the continuum and the rsne / snrs distribution even more .",
    "after azimuthal averaging , the vlba point source maps are a fairly close match to the 33 ghz continuum .",
    "such a close match between the 33 ghz continuum extent and the rsn / snr number density map may not be too surprising : if synchrotron radiation arises from cosmic ray ( cr ) electrons accelerated by sn shocks , then the 33 ghz continuum emission might be expected to resemble a `` puffed up '' version of the rsn / snr distribution due to the diffusion of cr electrons .",
    "instead the distributions match quite well , consistent with most of the 33 ghz emission coming from very close to the original rsn / snr and little diffusion or secondary cr electron production .",
    "this lack of significant propagation could be explained by the cooling timescales being much smaller than the diffusion time .",
    "this is expected in compact starbursts with magnetic fields of the order of a mg ( see measurements from * ? ? ?",

    "* based on zeeman splitting of oh megamaser emission ) , like arp 220 ( see figure 1 in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , though not in normal galaxies @xcite .",
    "for arp 220 , the cooling time of cr electrons at 33 ghz is @xmath5@xmath113 , which is a combination of synchrotron , bremsstrahlung , ionization and inverse compton ( ic ) losses .",
    "we make use of equation 7 in @xcite for cr electrons with energies greater than 1 gev to estimate that the synchrotron emitting electrons at 33 ghz only have time to propagate about 5 pc , which is about 1/10th of the size that we have measured for the nuclei .",
    "this short diffusion scale yields a synchrotron image that looks very similar to the sites of original cr production ( the rsn / snr ) and thus the sites of active star formation .",
    "the advantage of the vla continuum in this case is that in exchange for coarser native resolution , we achieve sensitivity to most of the flux and spatial scales of interest ( and potentially still probe a longer timescale ) .",
    "the similarity of 6 ghz , 33 ghz , co surface brightness , and the rsn / snr number density distributions lead us to view our 33 ghz measurement as indicative of the true size of the main disks of star formation and , presumably , gas and hot dust .",
    "these morphologies are also consistent with the nuclear morphologies measured in mid - ir with the keck telescope @xcite . perhaps surprisingly , the two disks appear fairly similar in terms of profile , scale length , and observed flux .",
    "the western nucleus appears hotter and more compact but the differences are small factors , not an order of magnitude .",

    "the difficulty with this estimate is apportioning this gas mass to the various components of the system .",
    "we consider a conservative approach to be the following : we assume that half of the total molecular gas mass is equally distributed between the two nuclei and the other half in an outer disk ( e.g. , see * ? ? ?",
    "* for evidence of an outer disk ) .",
    "this implies @xmath121@xmath122  m@xmath8 of gas per nucleus from @xcite .",
    "this remains in moderate tension with the dynamical masses because it would imply very high gas fractions , but given the mismatch in scales ( the dynamical masses are estimated on @xmath69  pc scales ) and uncertainties in modeling , a factor of @xmath123@xmath33 uncertainty seems plausible @xcite .",
    "the areas that we measure for the arp 220 nuclei are stunningly small , especially when compared to the integrated properties of the system .",
    "we adopt the literature gas mass of the nuclei as @xmath124  m@xmath8 , with the lower bound set by the @xcite values , the upper bound set by @xcite , and the best estimate consistent ( with modest tension ) with the latter .",
    "we further expect half of the gas mass of each to be distributed within the half - light deconvolved , face - on , area ( @xmath92 ) of our radio images ( these trace star formation , so we implicitly assume that gas and star formation track one another within the system ) .",
    "we thus compare @xmath125  m@xmath8 to our half - light areas to estimate average , nuclear , gas surface densities .",

    "the western nucleus is more compact with a higher @xmath84 than the eastern nucleus .",
    "however , consistent with previous vlbi observations , we observe no significant central excess in either arp 220 images or radial profiles ( figures [ fig1 ] and [ fig2 ] ) . @xcite discuss the possibility that one of three vlbi point sources showing a flat spectrum ( @xmath201 ) , could be an agn .",
    "however , that is one of several possibilities that could explain the shape of their spectrum .",
    "most of the 33 ghz emission that we observe comes from the compact , but still resolved , disks around the nuclei .",
    "specifically , the nuclear beam of the west nucleus contains 20% of the total flux of the nucleus , while the other 80% arises from the more extended star forming regions ( table [ tbl-1 ] ) .",
    "our measured @xmath2 contain similar information ( see table [ tbl-2 ] ) .",
    "we can not rule out an agn in the western nucleus , but if one is present it does not make a dominant , point - like contribution to the overall 33 ghz emission on scales of @xmath202  pc .",
    "similarly , arp 220 does not exceed the ",
    "eddington \" value that might eliminate star formation as a viable power source ( see section [ sec : edd ] ) .",
    "@xcite show that the sn rate and luminosity of arp 220 are broadly consistent with emission only generated by star formation , though uncertainty in the imf , sn rate , and sfr certainly would still allow an agn contribution .",
    "no high brightness temperature radio core indicative of an agn is present .",
    "however , given that most agn are radio - quiet and have weak core emission ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the absence of a radio core does not rule out the presence of an agn . indeed ,",
    "several studies at other wavelengths have presented evidence of a possible agn in arp 220 , but to date there is no clear evidence that the putative agn makes a significant contribution to the bolometric luminosity .",
    "if our estimate of n(h ) @xmath5 10@xmath203 cm@xmath9 in section [ sec : size ] is correct , it would explain why evidence for agn in arp 220 has been so elusive . with such high column densities",
    "any agn would be compton thick and undetectable by standard agn diagnostic tools .",
    "we present new , high resolution vla observations of the nearest ulirg , arp 220 .",
    "our 33 ghz observations measure the light distribution , which originates mostly from synchrotron emission , at a wavelength where optical depth effects are likely negligible .",
    "we find exponential profiles with half - light radii of @xmath3 and @xmath4  pc for the eastern and western nucleus , respectively .",
    "the distribution of 33 ghz radio emission matches the number density distribution of recent rsne / snrs very well .",
    "this similarity may result from strong ( @xmath5 mg ) magnetic fields , which could yield cooling timescales for cosmic ray electrons that are short compared to the diffusion timescale .",
    "adopting the measured 33  ghz sizes as characteristic of the star - forming disks , we derive implied surface densities , h column densities and volumetric gas densities that strikingly illustrate the extreme nature of the environment present in arp 220 . combining our size measurements with unresolved infrared measurements , we estimate total fluxes that , although very large , lie well below the conservative predicted values for the eddington - limited  maximal starburst \" , though this result is sensitive to our assumptions .",
    "regardless , the implied luminosity surface brightness for the west nucleus of arp 220 is among the most extreme for any measured system . given the general uncertain evidence to date of a dominant agn in arp 220 , we conclude that the compact size and disk - like morphology clearly make arp 220 a prototypical example of the most extreme class of star - forming systems in the local universe .",

    "consider a geometrically thin disk with radius @xmath204 viewed face on . then consider a small area parallel to the disk and at distance @xmath205 above the disk center .",
    "the flux , @xmath206 , passing through the area will be    @xmath207    where @xmath208 is the area subtended by an infinitesimal part of the disk .",
    "the factor @xmath209 accounts for the orientation of the area relative to the patch of emitting disk under consideration with @xmath210 just as @xmath211 .",
    "_ i _ is the specific intensity , which for the optically thick case , is just the source function of the disk and is the same for all lines of sight ( as the disk fills the beam ) . in the scenario where radiation pressure is important",
    ", we consider that near the disk high optical depth is likely and proceed in the case of arp 220 at high viewing angles .",
    "this factor cancels with the directional @xmath209 in equation [ eq : ap1 ] so that the optically thin case yields a different answer . ] .",
    "the integral in equation [ eq : ap1 ] goes from 0 to @xmath212 in @xmath213 and 0 to @xmath214 in @xmath215 .",
    "we will immediately change variables so that @xmath216 and @xmath217 .",
    "thus ,    @xmath218    consider the limit where @xmath219 , i.e. , where the area the flux is passing through lies just above the disk .",
    "then    @xmath220    similar to the well known relation that the flux at the surface of a blackbody is @xmath221 will be different by a factor of two in the optically thin case . ] .",
    "similarly , at large @xmath222 , as for an astronomical observation :    @xmath223    which is nothing more than the integral of the intensity over the solid angle subtended by the disk .",
    "the utility in this calculation is to relate @xmath224 back to the luminosity , which for an isotropic emitter is just @xmath225 ( see the last paragraph of this appendix for some caveats regarding this assumption )",
    ". then    @xmath226    so that ,    @xmath227    this @xmath228 is the flux through a surface near the disk and the departure from the perhaps expected @xmath229 is that we have included the @xmath209 term in the original setup to account for the projection of the incident intensity onto the unit area .    when considering real observations cast in terms of the half - light area , @xmath230 ( and recall that the commonly used size at fwhm for a two dimensional gaussian is @xmath230 ) an additional factor enters from the fact that @xmath231 = @xmath232 for @xmath233 .",
    "then in general :    @xmath234    is the flux that should be used for considering radiation pressure near a large disk ( where large is defined so that @xmath219 can hold ) . in arp 220 ,",
    "an additional factor of two comes into play if we assume the luminosity is split between the two nuclei with a ratio of 1:1 .",
    "this decreases the relation to @xmath235 for this specific case .",
    "note the stark difference , even for the general case , from the commonly adopted @xmath236 .    in the case of an",
    "_ optically thick _ disk , the assumption of isotropy is not valid and @xmath237 , instead @xmath238 .",
    "further , the emission is not isotropically distributed , so that if the disk is inclined by an angle , @xmath239 , with respect to the line of sight , where @xmath240 is a face - on disk , then @xmath241 @xmath239 . in other words ,",
    "the emission comes only from the two sides of the disks and an observer finds more flux when the disk is viewed face on ( because the constant intensity surface subtends more solid angle ) .",
    "this is a substantial uncertainty for arp 220 ( e.g. , see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) : it appears to host two inclined disks and shows good evidence for optical depth at ir wavelengths .",
    "however , we are hesitant to impose any correction to the luminosity in the main analysis because we we do not know the true geometry of the infrared photosphere , which might very plausibly be more spherical and emit more isotropically than the nuclear disks picked out by our 33  ghz observations",
    ". therefore throughout the main text we have used the conventional @xmath242 but we note this substantial uncertainty .",
    "as a simple check on the plausibility of radiation pressure representing the main means of support , we consider vertical hydrostatic equilibrium in a simple gas disk .",
    "we consider an infinite slab of surface density @xmath243 , so that the integrated weight of the column of gas at the midplane is @xmath244 ( here @xmath245 is the gravitational constant ) . to a coarse approximation",
    ", radiation pressure can counteract this weight with a pressure set by the momentum flux of photons , @xmath246 ( where @xmath247 is the speed of light ) , multiplied by the total opacity of the gas column , @xmath248 , where @xmath177 is the cross section per unit gas mass . then :      we can then solve for @xmath177 in terms of the other properties of the disk and the resulting @xmath177 expresses the required effective opacity in order for radiation pressure to balance the weight of the disk :      if @xmath206 and @xmath243 are known , comparison of the require @xmath177 to realistic values represents a zeroth order check of whether radiation pressure represents a viable support mechanism for a system . as a close corollary , if @xmath177 is known or can be estimated , assessing the degree to which equation [ eq : hydro1 ] represents an inequality offers diagnostic of the importance of radiation pressure to the system . note that @xmath177 , as we have written it , will depend on the dust - to - gas ratio , grain properties , overall opacity , and temperature distribution . in our simplified thin disk geometry , it does not depend directly on the size of the system but all of these properties may vary substantially as a function of disk structure . as a first order approximation , we assume the @xcite model values serve as a template of typical values that would describe @xmath177 for the nuclei in arp 220 , but to our knowledge a thorough exploration of @xmath177 appropriate for the nuclear disks of merging galaxies remains lacking in the literature .",
