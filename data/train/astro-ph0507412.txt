    "( 1999 ) reported _ rxte _ observations carried out in 1998 february 8 and 16 .",
    "the flux detected in the energy range 330  kev was @xmath20 erg  @xmath11  s@xmath12 , and the obtained photon index was @xmath211.95 , although these values are likely affected by contamination from the diffuse background ( see discussion below ) .",
    "the x - ray timing analysis indicated the absence of pulsed or periodic emission on timescales of 0.022000 seconds .",
    "the source spectrum was well represented by a power - law model plus a gaussian component describing a strong iron line at 6.7  kev .",
    "significant emission was seen up to 30  kev , and no exponential cut - off at high energy was required .",
    "unpublished observations performed by _ asca _ ( 1999 october 4 ) present a photon index of about 1.6 , and an unabsorbed flux in the range 0.310  kev of about @xmath22  erg  @xmath11  s@xmath12 ( martocchia , motch , & negueruela 2005 ) . _",
    "bepposax _ observations , on 2000 october 8 , found a flux of @xmath23 erg  @xmath11  s@xmath12 ( 0.310 kev ) , a photon index of 1.8 and a hydrogen column density of @xmath24  @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "these authors also concluded that an x - ray eclipse by the companion star was ruled out by these data .",
    "the new ephemeris obtained by casares et  al .",
    "( 2005 ) confirm that the _ bepposax _ observations took place during the inferior conjunction of the primary .",
    "the lack of eclipses provides an upper limit for the inclination of the system of @xmath25 ( see discussion in reig et  al .",
    "2003a for details ) .",
    "we have analysed unpublished _",
    "chandra _ data ( 2002 september 10 ) and have found a flux of @xmath26 erg  @xmath11  s@xmath12 and @xmath211.14@xmath270.12 in the range 0.310  kev . finally , _",
    "xmm _ observations of  were carried out recently ( 2003 march 8 and 27 ) , and showed that the source presented a flux of about @xmath28 erg  @xmath11  s@xmath12 ( 0.310  kev ) and a photon index of about 1.5 ( martocchia et  al . 2005 ) .",
    "very similar fluxes and photon indexes are found for both observing periods , being consistent with the fact that both were taken at the same orbital phase ( around 0.55 with the new ephemeris ) .    in any but",
    "the _ rxte _ observations in 1998 , a gaussian component in addition to the absorbed power - law model does not improve the fit .",
    "therefore , it is possible that the gaussian line of the 1998 _ rxte _ observations could come from the galactic ridge , being present because of the large field of view and effective area of the instrument .",
    "we investigate this issue below .",
    "for all the observations , disk features are not necessary to fit the data .",
    "we list in table  [ priorobs ] the dates , missions , orbital phases , photon indexes and extrapolated fluxes in the energy range 330  kev of  using a power - law spectrum , assuming the same slope all up to 30  kev , for all the prior observations but the _ rosat _ one ( because of the big difference in energy range ) .",
    "although it is clear that photon index and flux changes are present , since the different observations are separated months / years in time , it has not been possible up to now to clearly establish whether the intensity of the emission changed with time due to variations in the mass - loss rate of the stellar companion or due to the orbital eccentricity .",
    "there is observational evidence supporting the first option , based on correlations found between the wind intensity of the companion ( inferred from the equivalent width of the h@xmath16 absorption line ) and the observed x - ray flux ( reig et  al .",
    "2003a ; mcswain et  al .",
    "2004 ) , although this does not preclude the second one to occur as well .",
    "the photon index variation could also be a consequence of either long - term phenomena , short - term phenomena , or both .",
    "the main goal of these observations was to perform an in depth study of the x - ray variability during a full orbital period of the microquasar .",
    "in particular , we wanted to answer the following questions : does the source flux vary with orbital phase due to a geometric effect related to the eccentricity of the binary system ? is the power - law index dependent on the orbital phase ? does the iron line come from the source ?",
    "this section tries to answer these three queries , although a deeper and wider discussion is developed in sect .",
    "[ disc ] .",
    "_ rxte _ observed the source on 17 runs of different duration covering a total of 4 days between 2003 july 4 and 8 .",
    "due to the relatively faint emission of  during the observations , the source spectrum is background dominated beyond 30  kev , so hexte data has not been considered and we have focused on the analysis of pca data . for the four longer runs ,",
    "only pcu # 2 data was available , whereas two and even three detectors were on during significant fractions of time of the other runs ( pcus # 1 , 3 and 4 ) .",
    "all the observations performed with pca have been reduced and analysed .",
    "a summary of the observations is shown in table  [ rxteobs ] .",
    "we have reduced the data using the heasoft ftools package version 5.3.1 .",
    "the spectral analysis has been performed with xspec 11.3.1 . to carry out the data reduction ,",
    "we have created a filter file to avoid data taken with an elevation angle with respect to the horizon smaller than 10 degrees , electron contaminated data , data taken during the south atlantic anomaly passage and data with an offset of the pointings bigger than 0.02 degrees .",
    "we have accounted also for the detectors that were on during the observation .",
    "for the 17 runs , we have tried to fit the spectra with an absorbed power - law plus a gaussian emission line and a disk black body components . for all of them",
    "either the difference between models with and without a black body component is insignificant or the black body flux is consistent with being zero .",
    "therefore , to estimate the photon index and the fluxes of both the continuum and the line , we have fitted the data only with an absorbed power - law plus a gaussian line around 6.7  kev with fixed zero width ( due to the low spectral resolution of _ rxte _ ) . regarding absorption",
    ", we note that inhomegeneities in the velocity and/or spatial distribution of the stellar wind could produce a variable amount of hydrogen column density , as has been observed in other wind - fed accreting systems like @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , it is not possible to extract such kind of information from our _ rxte _ data of  due to the faint emission of the source , the relatively low value of @xmath29 and the low - energy threshold of our data at 3  kev .",
    "therefore , we have assumed a constant hydrogen column density and fixed it to a value of @xmath30  @xmath11 ( resulting from the average between the one found by reig et  al .",

    "the spectrum and the fit to the data taken at phase 0.780.84 , during a long - lasting maximum of emission , are presented in fig .",
    "[ spec ] . the aspect of the spectra and the fits obtained from the other observations are quite similar to the one shown here .",
    "the date , time and orbital phase of the 17 runs , with their power - law indexes and unabsorbed fluxes for the power - law component in the energy range 330  kev are presented in table  [ rxteobs ] .    due to the low source flux ,",
    "the upper limits on the source variability within a given run are not very constraining .",
    "the derived limits depend on a number of factors , including the fitting functions used ( power - laws , lorentzians , etc . ) and the background subtraction ( total background is about 30 cts  s@xmath12  pcu@xmath12 in the 330  kev energy range ) .",
    "fast fourier transforms of the high time resolution data from all active pcus were performed to create power density spectra ( pds ) in the 0.011000  hz range . given the faint nature of the source , all available energy channels were combined when making the pds , and the obtained fractional variability amplitude is generally less than 25% ( 3@xmath32 ) .",
    "the pds are dominated by poisson noise , and generally appear to have no significant noise components which can be attributed to the source .      the unabsorbed power - law flux and the photon index as a function of time are presented in fig .",
    "[ flev1 ] .",
    "we find evidence of day to day variations in both parameters .",
    "we show the same data folded with the orbital period in fig .",
    "[ flev2 ] .",
    "it can be seen that the flux appears to be moderately variable along the orbit , presenting a variation of a 50% ( see table  [ rxteobs ] ) with a long - lasting maximum at phase 0.8 and a short - duration maximum around phase 0.16 .",
    "this short - duration maximum , of about half an hour , is more than three sigmas over the level of emission indicated by the adjacent points , and it is not unique since other short - duration peaks are present even within the longer runs . the plotted flux in fig .",
    "[ flev2 ] has been corrected for the internal background . however",
    ", this background subtracted flux still contains a contribution from the diffuse background that is difficult to disentagle from the source spectrum and is estimated to be about 2 counts per second per pcu .",
    "applying an absorbed raymond plus power - law model ( see valinia & marshall 1998 ) to this count rate in the 330  kev energy interval , we obtain a diffuse background flux of about 3@xmath33  erg  @xmath11  s@xmath12 .",
    "thus , the ratio between the long - lasting maximum and the minimum fluxes after subtracting the diffuse background is @xmath02.5 .    in the lower panel of fig .",
    "[ flev2 ] , we show the evolution of the photon index with the orbital phase .",
    "as can be seen , the photon index varies along the orbital period , presenting a hardening close to periastron . actually , comparing in fig .",
    "[ flev2 ] the unabsorbed power - law flux and the photon index evolutions at different phases of the orbit , an anti - correlation between both appears .",
    "this is better illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fluxg ] , where we plot the photon index as a function of the unabsorbed power - law flux .",
    "it seems that , when the flux is higher , the photon index is harder , and the contrary happens when the flux is lower ( this anti - correlation holds even within the longer observations when split and analysed by parts ) .",
    "we stress here that changes in flux and photon index can not be due to changes in the hydrogen column density for this weakly absorbed source , since we are working in the energy range 330  kev , nor to diffuse background variations ( internal background ones are already taken into account ) since , after applying the diffuse background model , the anti - correlation is still there .",
    "we note that the photon indexes calculated using this model are harder , in the range @xmath01.31.6 , more in accordance with those obtained in previous x - ray observations of the source , excluding the 1998 _ rxte _ ones .",
    "nevertheless , the uncertainty in the diffuse background model determination at the position requires to be cautious about these results .",
    "moreover , the flux variability does not seem to depend only on the photon index variability , since when fixing it to an intermediate value of 1.9 the flux variation is still significant .",
    "another test has been done by fitting the unabsorbed flux data given in table  [ rxteobs ] with a constant value .",
    "the obtained reduced @xmath34 greater than 3 indicates that the fit is not good .",
    "moreover , the diffuse background can not introduce variability , since its value , estimated by the _ rxte _ team , remains constant within about a 10% during periods of time longer than the orbital period .",
    "finally , no significant optical variations have been observed in simultaneous photometric observations @xcite , which indicates that the companion star showed a stable behavior from the photometric point of view during our _ rxte _ observations , reinforcing the idea that the measured x - ray flux variability is due to changes of the accretion rate in an eccentric orbit .",
    "although the data do not cover continuously the whole orbit , there appear to be two types of variation timescales in the lightcurves .",
    "one apparently linked to the orbital period of @xmath03.9  days , the other of shorter duration , like miniflares , of about 1  hour .",
    "no significant changes are detected through simultaneous ( although not strictly ) spectroscopic observations of the h@xmath16 line along the orbit on day timescales @xcite .",
    "thus , stellar wind changes can be ruled out to explain the first type of variability .",
    "in contrast , fast fluctuations in the stellar wind might be related to the shorter timescale variability as significant variations on timescales of minutes have been observed in radial velocity measurements of  ( see figure  2 of casares et  al .",
    "( 2005 ) , around hjd  2,452,827.7 ) .",
    "unfortunately , there is no spectroscopic data right before these miniflares observed in x - rays .",
    "our fits to the spectra are well consistent with the presence of a line at 6.7@xmath270.1  kev in the data , as in the previous _ rxte _ observations @xcite . however , as mentioned above , no other x - ray mission but _ rxte _ ( which does not have imaging capabilities ) reported the presence of the iron line , so its origin could be in the galactic plane regions behind the source , and due to the so - called galactic ridge emission . one possible test for determining whether or not the line is related to  would be the presence or not of line - flux variations correlated with continuum flux changes .",
    "in fact , the different values of the line flux obtained on the different runs are always consistent , at 90%confidence , with their average value of @xmath35  photon  @xmath11  s@xmath12 per pcu beam of 0.9 square degree . for comparison ,",
    "the value of the iron - line flux at the position after measurement with the _ ginga _ large area proportional counters ( lac ) is @xmath36  photon  @xmath11  s@xmath12 per lac beam of 1@xmath372 , with the large beam oriented perpendicular to the galactic plane ( yamauchi & koyama 1993 ) .",
    "therefore , this implies a flux around @xmath38  photon  @xmath11  s@xmath12 per 0.9 square degree , compatible with our individual measurements and slightly above the average value we have obtained .",
    "moreover , we have performed the analysis of the slew data ( when _ rxte _ was pointing off the source ) along the four days of observation and found marginal evidence of the presence of a line ( 3@xmath32 ) with the flux similar to that obtained from the on - source data .",
    "although slew data have been difficult to model and we had to restrict the energy range to 3.010  kev , we have fitted first the data to a bremsstrahlung obtaining a reduced @xmath34 of 2 , and afterwards to a bremsstrahlung plus a gaussian line , improving the reduced @xmath34 value down to 1 .",
    "the former facts seem to rule out the possibility that the line comes from the source , although a deep observation by an instrument with imaging capabilities , if possible around periastron passage when the flux is higher , is still required to definitively solve this question .",
    "the _ rxte _ observations presented here show evidence of flux variability occurring on timescales of days which is anti - correlated to the photon index of the spectrum . since this happens while no changes are detected in the companion star and the maximum x - ray flux occurs near periastron , we propose that this variability is related to the orbital motion of the compact object accreting from the companion star wind along an eccentric orbit . actually the emission peak seems to take place at phase 0.8 , not right at periastron passage .",
    "leahy ( 2002 ) models a similar x - ray lightcurve observed in through a non spherically symmetric stellar wind accreted by the compact object following bondi - hoyle accretion .",
    "we can consider that the wind of the companion star follows a @xmath39-law and use a simple spherically symmetric bondi - hoyle accretion model ( see reig et  al .",
    "2003a for details ) to study the ratio of maximum to minimum flux , to be compared to the observed one .",
    "for this purpose we have assumed the following parameters : @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42  yr@xmath12 ( average between the value given in kudritzki & puls 2000 from the wind - momentum relationship and the value inferred from optical spectroscopy by mcswain et  al .",
    "2004 ) , @xmath43  km  s@xmath12 ( from observations by mcswain et  al . 2004 ) , @xmath44 , and finally a neutron star of @xmath45 with a radius of @xmath46  km in an eccentric orbit with @xmath47  days and @xmath48 .",
    "( casares et  al . 2005 ) .",
    "these parameters provide an expected variability with a ratio of @xmath010 between the maximum and minimum flux . even when considering the uncertainties in all the involved parameters , ratios between 817",
    "are found .",
    "these ratios are much lower than the variability ratio @xmath040 considering the previous eccentricity value of about 0.5 @xcite , but still too large to explain the ratio of @xmath02.5 observed by _",
    "rxte_.    a possible solution that would easily reconcile the theoretical and the observed flux ratio is the presence of an accretion disk around the compact object .",
    "this would smoothen the accretion rate of the compact object , implying lower and longer emission bumps around periastron passage in the lightcurves .",
    "therefore , the difference between the expected and the observed flux ratio could be the first hint , in the x - ray domain and independent of the presence of relativistic jets , of the existence of an accretion disk in , although it is not clear what kind of disk can be present at such a low ratio of x - ray to eddington luminosity .",
    "it should be noted that for the short - timescale variations or miniflares , although they present the same flux / photon index anti - correlation as the rest of the observations suggesting to be intrinsic to the source , the disk smoothing might not operate in the same manner as for long - lasting peaks , since it is the wind itself that changes rapidly .",
    "this could affect the accretion process in a more violent manner ( e.g. inducing unsteady accretion and subsequent sudden x - ray flux increase ) than a slow changing flow , as it would be the case for an approximately constant mass - loss rate crossed by the accreting compact object .",
    "_ bepposax _ observations show a decrease in flux of about a 50% between the periastron passage at phase 0.0 and the end of the observations at phase 0.21 ( figure  1 of reig et  al .",
    "interestingly , this is not too far from the flux reduction in this phase interval predicted by the accretion model discussed above , and we remind the reader that _ bepposax _ had imaging capabilities , preventing the influence of background sources in the data .",
    "we note that the position of the maximum of emission in the _ bepposax _ observations is consistent to be before periastron , like in the observations presented here . therefore",
    ", these observations are complementary to the _ rxte _ ones reported here and give clear support to the orbital variability as due to the eccentric orbit .    concerning the long - term correlations in the x - ray emission and the stellar mass - loss rate , the new values for the equivalent width of the h@xmath16 absorption line of @xmath02.8    @xcite are similar to those obtained during the epochs when _ asca _ and",
    "_ chandra _ observed the source .",
    "moreover , taking into account the diffuse background emission , the average x - ray flux truly coming from the source during our observations is about 2@xmath33  erg  @xmath11  s@xmath12 , similar also to the fluxes observed during _",
    "asca _ and _ chandra _ observations .",
    "therefore , the apparent correlation between changes in the mass - loss rate of the stellar companion and the x - ray emission , suggested by reig et  al .",
    "( 2003a ) and supported by mcswain et  al .",
    "( 2004 ) , seems to be confirmed by these new spectoscopic and x - ray results .",
    "the signature of the existence of an accretion disk around the compact object is not present in any of the obtained x - ray spectra of the source and no cut - off is present in data up to 30  kev . actually , the possible detection of  by instruments working in the energy range beyond the _ rxte _ one ( batse , harmon et  al .",
    "@xcite ; comptel , strong et  al .",
    "2001 ; egret , paredes et  al .",
    "2000 ) seems to preclude the existence of any cut - off at energies beyond the _ rxte _ range , typical of the thermal comptonization spectra for emission produced in a corona .",
    "therefore , we propose that the x - ray emission is due to inverse compton ( ic ) and/or synchrotron processes within the relativistic jets of . in our scenario ,",
    "an increase in the accretion rate would imply a higher electron acceleration efficiency in the jets , filling with fresh particles the higher energy range of the electron energy distribution .",
    "this would harden the x - ray spectrum , which is actually observed by _ rxte _ through the flux / photon index anti - correlation .",
    "the smooth evolution of the flux could be explained mainly , as it is mentioned above , by the dynamical timescales of a faint underlying accretion disk , which would smoothen the emission variation around the periastron passage .",
    "it has been considered by several authors that relativistic electrons in the jet of a microquasar could produce significant x - ray emission by ic upscattering of the stellar photons or their own synchrotron photons ( see kaufman bernad , romero , & mirabel 2002 ; georganopoulos , aharonian , & kirk 2002 ; reig , kylafis , & giannios 2003b ; bosch - ramon , romero , & paredes 2005 ) . optically thin synchrotron radiation from a jet",
    "could also dominate at x - rays , depending on the matter density and magnetic field conditions within the jet ( markoff , falcke , & fender 2001 ) .",
    "jet dominated states could be common and the disk radiation would appear covered by the non - thermal jet emission ( fender , gallo , & jonker 2003 ) .",
    "these jet dominated states are associated with the low - hard state of black hole x - ray binaries .",
    "the nature of the compact object in is still unknown ( although in could be a black - hole , see casares et  al .",
    "2005 ) and its relatively high radio flux density and optically thin radio spectrum do not agree with the observed values found in black holes ( gallo , fender , & pooley 2003 ) . however , the observed x - ray spectrum is always very similar to the ones of black holes in the low - hard state : a power - law with a photon index around 1.5 ( see tables  [ priorobs ] and [ rxteobs ] ) .",
    "we have reported recent _ rxte _ observations of  covering a full orbital period of 4  days .",
    "the obtained results show moderate day to day variability that is interpreted as due to changes in the accretion rate because of the orbital motion of the compact object along an eccentric orbit , with an increase of emission right before periastron passage .",
    "in addition , the observed short - timescale flux variations ( miniflares ) are likely related to observed fast variations in the stellar wind properties .",
    "these observational results give support to the accretion scenario , making other possibilities like the young non - accreting pulsar scenario ( martocchia et al .",
    "2005 ) to be more unlikely . in parallel with the power - law flux variability , the flux of the iron line , detected at @xmath06.7  kev like in previous",
    "_ rxte _ observations , has remained constant within the errors and similar to the expected background line flux .",
    "furthermore , slew data of these _ rxte _ observations present marginal evidences of the iron line as well , and the line has not been detected by x - ray satellites with imaging capabilities .",
    "all these facts make us suggest it is a background feature .",
    "no disk signatures are found in the spectra , although this is not rare for other x - ray binaries in the low - hard state .",
    "in fact , the presence of an accretion disk could explain the apparent smoothening of the flux changes along the orbit observed by _ rxte _ with respect to what is predicted by using a bondi - hoyle accretion model .",
    "finally , there appears to be an anti - correlation between the flux and the x - ray photon index along the orbit , reaching a maximum of emission and the hardest spectrum around phase 0.8 .",
    "we suggest that a scenario where the x - rays come from ic interactions and/or synchrotron emission within a relativistic jet could explain this anti - correlation , as well as the absence of cut - off at hard x - rays .",

    "<S> the properties of the orbit and the donor star in the high mass x - ray binary microquasar  indicate that accretion processes should mainly occur via a radiatively driven wind . </S>",
    "<S> in such a scenario , significant x - ray variability would be expected due to the eccentricity of the orbit . </S>",
    "<S> the source has been observed at x - rays by several missions , although with a poor coverage that prevents to reach any conclusion about orbital variability . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , we conducted _ rossixte _ observations of the microquasar system  covering a full orbital period of 4 days . </S>",
    "<S> individual observations are well fitted with an absorbed power - law plus a gaussian at 6.7  kev , to account for iron line emission that is probably a diffuse background feature . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , we have taken into account that the continuum is also affected by significant diffuse background contamination . </S>",
    "<S> our results show moderate power - law flux variations on timescales of days , as well as the presence of miniflares on shorter timescales . </S>",
    "<S> the new orbital ephemeris of the system recently obtained by casares et  al . have allowed us to show , for the first time , that an increase of emission is seen close to the periastron passage , as expected in an accretion scenario . moreover , </S>",
    "<S> the detected orbital variability is a factor of @xmath04 smaller than the one expected by using a simple wind accretion model , and we suggest that an accretion disk around the compact object could be responsible for this discrepancy . on the other hand , significant changes in the photon index are also observed clearly anti - correlated with the flux variations . </S>",
    "<S> we interpret the overall x - ray spectral characteristics of  in the context of x - ray radiation produced by inverse compton and/or synchrotron processes in the jet of this microquasar . </S>"
