    "the catalytic oxidation of hydrocarbons in general , and of methane in particular , is considered as an effective method of power generation associated with low emissions of co@xmath1 and no@xmath3 . because of the high h / c ratio of methane , the heat of combustion per mole of generated co@xmath1 is higher than for other fuels , e.g. twice as much as for coal  @xcite .",

    "the performance of pd - pt catalysts strongly depends on the chemical state of the metal surface at the conditions suitable for oxidation , which in many cases lead to the formation of superficial oxide phases . for pure pd and pt catalysts , there is agreement that oxide formation has a positive effect on their methane oxidation activity  @xcite , although the active oxide phases have not been unequivocally determined yet . on the one hand",
    ", some authors have proposed that bulk pdo is less active than either a thin oxide layer  @xcite or a layer of adsorbed oxygen on pd  @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the formation of bulk oxide has been suggested to explain the observed increase in catalytic activity  @xcite .",
    "recently , gabasch et al .",
    "@xcite reported that bulk pdo seeds grown on a surface , otherwise covered by a pd@xmath10o@xmath11 surface oxide , are the active phase for methane oxidation on a pd(111 ) single crystal surface .",
    "the catalytic behavior of pure pt metal is quite different . according to investigations in refs .",
    "@xcite , its catalytic activity reaches a maximum at a submonolayer coverage of adsorbed oxygen , and further oxidation with formation of pto@xmath1 leads to activity loss .",
    "still , it is unclear whether a similar behavior can be expected also for other pt oxide phases that could develop in an oxidizing atmosphere .",

    "the oxidation of pd and pt surfaces proceeds from the chemisorption of oxygen atoms through the formation of surface oxides to the development of bulk oxide . in the case of palladium",

    "investigations of oxide formation on platinum revealed the following . on pt(111 ) , the formation of a bulk - like , strongly distorted @xmath12-pto@xmath1 surface oxide was observed at an oxygen partial pressure of 0.5 atm and temperatures from 520 - 910  k  @xcite .",
    "@xmath12-pto@xmath1 was predicted to be the stable low temperature phase also by dft calculations  @xcite . on pt(100 ) , dft calculations suggest the formation of an @xmath12-pto@xmath1-like surface oxide at low temperature  @xcite and the existence of a stability region for a pt@xmath14o@xmath11-like oxide layer at higher temperature .      to characterize the binding strength of oxygen atoms adsorbed at metal surfaces , we calculate an average oxygen binding energy @xmath23 per o atom according to the formula @xmath24 \\ ; , \\label{eq2}\\ ] ] where @xmath25 is the total energy of the oxygen - metal system , @xmath26 the energy of the bare metal substrate , @xmath27 the energy of a free oxygen molecule , and n@xmath28 the number of o atoms .",
    "the oxygen atoms in formula ( [ eq2 ] ) include oxygen located on the surface as well as in sub - surface positions .",
    "the calculated oxygen binding energies on ( 111 ) surfaces are listed in table  [ on_sub_tab ] for different oxygen coverages up to 1 monolayer ( ml ) .",
    "the values in the last column are obtained for a stack of atomic layers with pd in the surface layer , pt in the sub - surface layer , and pd in the remaining layers . in a previous dft study  @xcite , we have calculated oxygen adsorption energies on mixed pd - pt surface and sub - surface layers . for the considered pd - pt compositions and configurations ,",
    "the oxygen adsorption energies have been found to vary between -1.26  ev and -0.94  ev . in the case of stacks of pure pd and pt layers ,",
    "we have obtained an adsorption energy of -0.99  ev on pt / pd / pd(111 ) and -1.26  ev on pd / pt / pd(111 ) .",
    "the latter value presents the strongest oxygen binding that we have found on all considered stacks of mixed metal layers .",
    "this strong binding has been attributed to charge transfer from pd to pt which causes a strong binding between the more electropositive pd atoms and electronegative o atoms .",
    "the most stable oxygen adsorption sites on the ( 111 ) surface of pd and pt are the fcc hollow sites  @xcite . according to the energy values in table 1 , the oxygen binding energies on pure pt(111 ) are significantly smaller than on pure pd(111 ) for all considered coverages .",
    "the strongest oxygen binding is found for the pd / pt / pd(111 ) layer stack .",
    "further calculations are performed for the case of fixed sub - surface oxygen coverage of 0.25  ml , and increasing on - surface coverage up to 0.75  ml , thus giving a maximum total coverage of 1  ml . between the first and second metal layer",
    "there are three high - symmetry positions : an octahedral site underneath the fcc on - surface hollow site , a tetrahedral site ( tetra i ) below the hcp on - surface hollow site , and a second tetrahedral site ( tetra ii ) directly below a surface metal atom  @xcite . for simultaneous on - surface and sub - surface adsorption ,",
    "the fcc hollow site on the surface and the tetra i sub - surface position are found to be the most stable oxygen positions for all considered oxygen coverages .",
    "the corresponding average oxygen binding energies are given in table  [ on_sub_tab ] ( referred to as on+sub ) .",
    "they reveal that , in addition to on - surface adsorption , oxygen incorporation underneath the surface layer becomes favorable for a total oxygen coverage @xmath29 0.75  ml on pd(111 ) , and for @xmath30 = 1  ml on pt(111 ) .",
    "this result is in agreement with other dft calculations for pd(111 )  @xcite . for solely on - surface adsorption ,",
    "the binding of oxygen is slightly stronger on pd / pt / pd(111 ) than on pd(111 ) , whereas with sub - surface oxygen the average binding energy is larger for pure pd(111 ) due to the unfavorable binding of oxygen to the pt sub - surface layer in the case of pd / pt / pd(111 ) .",
    "with increasing oxygen coverage , surface oxide phases start forming on pd and pt surfaces . to our knowledge",
    ", there is no experimental information concerning the structure of such phases on the pd - pt bimetal .",
    "for this reason , model structures of possible pd - pt surface oxides are constructed here on the basis of the known oxide structures of pure pd and pt . in particular , we consider the experimentally observed pdo(101)-like  @xcite and the theoretically predicted pt@xmath14o@xmath11-like  @xcite oxide layers on the ( 100 ) surface , as well as the @xmath12-pto@xmath1-like  @xcite layer on the ( 111 ) surface . according to our previous calculations  @xcite , these layers are characterized by small lattice misfits between oxide and metallic substrate , namely 2% for pdo(101)/pd(100 ) , 3.5% for @xmath12-pto@xmath1(0001)/pt(111 ) , and less than 1% for pt@xmath14o@xmath11(100)/pt(100 ) .",
    "the corresponding oxide structures obtained after dft geometry optimization are shown in fig .",

    "the epitaxial pt@xmath14o@xmath11(100)/pt(100 ) oxide layer corresponds to an oxygen coverage of 1  ml . in this case ,",

    "1a , we first replace pd atom 1 in the oxide layer by pt . with increasing pt concentration in this layer pd atoms 2 , 3 and 4",
    "are replaced by pt .",
    "the pt concentration in the metal surface layer is increased in the same manner starting with pd atom 5 . for the other two layer systems ( figs .",
    "1c and 1e ) , the pt atoms are replaced by pd in analogous manner .    in order to characterize the stability of oxide structures with different pd - pt configurations and variable oxygen coverage",
    ", an average oxygen binding energy can be defined as @xmath31 \\ ; , \\label{bin_sur_ox}\\ ] ] where @xmath32 is the total energy of the substrate together with the oxide layer , @xmath26 the energy of the substrate alone , @xmath33 and @xmath34 the energies of pd and pt atoms in their bulk phases , and @xmath35 , @xmath36 and @xmath37 the numbers of oxygen , pd , and pt atoms in the oxide layer .",
    "the binding energy ( [ bin_sur_ox ] ) corresponds to the energy gained by deposition of molecular oxygen and formation of an oxide with metal atoms from ideal bulk metal reservoirs . with this definition",
    "we neglect the difference of chemical potentials of the metal atoms in the pure metal bulk and in a pd - pt alloy .",
    "since the free energy of mixing of pd - pt is of the order of few tens of mev per metal atom , while the oxygen binding energies are of the order of one ev , this approximation will not significantly influence our conclusions .    to study the effect of the pd - pt composition on the oxygen binding energy , we vary the pd / pt ratio both in the oxide layer and in the outermost substrate - layer .",
    "all other substrate layers are composed of pd in the case of the pdo(101 ) layer on pd(100 ) , and of pt for the other two cases .",
    "the calculated oxygen binding energies for the three oxide layers are shown in fig .",
    "[ binding_oxide ] as a function of the pt concentration of the outermost substrate layer .",
    "the different curves presented correspond to different compositions of the oxide layer .",
    "every curve point represents one special pd - pt configuration as noted above .",
    "test calculations for another configuration at fixed composition for pd@xmath38pt@xmath38o on pd@xmath39pt@xmath40/pd(100 ) and for @xmath12-pd@xmath41pt@xmath42o@xmath1 on pd@xmath43pt@xmath44/pt(111 ) yield only small differences in the average oxygen binding energy of 0.012  ev and 0.006  ev , respectively .    for the pdo(101 ) layer structure ( fig .",
    "[ binding_oxide](a ) ) , the maximum variation of the oxygen binding energy with the substrate - layer composition is less than 0.05  ev .",
    "similarly , the binding energy varies less than 0.1  ev for the @xmath12-pto@xmath1 structure ( fig .  [ binding_oxide](b ) , note the different energy scale ) . replacement of pd atoms of the pdo - like layer with pt is energetically unfavorable .",
    "namely , the o binding energy changes from -1.15 to -0.90  ev passing from a pure pdo to a pure pto layer .",
    "the same holds for replacing pt atoms of the @xmath12-pto@xmath1 layer with pd .",
    "an analogous result has previously been found for mixed _ bulk _ oxides of pd - pt  @xcite .",
    "for the case of the pt@xmath14o@xmath45-like oxide layer ( fig .",
    "[ binding_oxide](c ) ) , the changes in the binding energy with the substrate - layer composition are also small ( less than 0.12 ev ) . for this oxide layer",
    "it is very unfavorable to replace pt atoms with pd .",
    "indeed , a bader analysis  @xcite reveals that the oxygen atoms in pd@xmath14o@xmath45/pt(100 ) gain 0.67  e from metal atoms , while the corresponding value for pt@xmath14o@xmath45/pt(100 ) is 0.73  e , reflecting the stronger oxygen binding in the latter case . for the other two oxide structures considered , the charge transfer from metal atoms to oxygen does not change significantly with variation of the pd - pt composition in the oxide layer , consistently with the calculated small differences in the oxygen binding energy",
    "the first important step in the catalytic oxidation of methane is its adsorption on the catalyst surface and dissociation into adsorbed methyl and hydrogen . to get a first insight into the catalytic activity of pd - pt catalysts for methane oxidation , we compute the thermodynamic driving force for this adsorption reaction on various oxide structures , in particular on the superficial oxides of pd - pt considered in the previous section .",

    "we do not perform zero point energy corrections of the calculated adsorption energies since we think that these corrections lead to comparatively small shifts of energy values ( see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite ) , which is of minor importance for comparing adsorption energies on different systems as main goal of this study .",
    "we first report on our calculations concerning methane adsorption on pure metallic ( 111 ) and ( 100 ) surfaces . in agreement with other dft calculations",
    "@xcite , we find that on the ( 111 ) surface the most stable adsorption site for ch@xmath14 is on top of metal atoms and for h on fcc hollow sites .",
    "this applies to pure pd(111 ) and pt(111 ) as well as to the pd / pt / pd(111 ) layer stack with pd in the surface and pt in the sub - surface atomic layer .",
    "the calculated adsorption energies , shown in table  [ diss ] , are -0.08  ev for the pt(111 ) surface and 0.19  ev for the pd(111 ) surface .",
    "the positive value for pd(111 ) corresponds to an endothermic reaction .",
    "this is in agreement with previous dft calculations for methane adsorption on pd(111 ) within the generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) ( @xmath49 = 0.27 ev ) , whereas an exothermic reaction was found by using the local density approximation ( lda ) ( @xmath49 = -0.62 ev )  @xcite . for comparison , at the lda level",
    "we obtain adsorption energies of -0.43  ev , -0.66  ev , and -0.45  ev on pd(111 ) , pt(111 ) , and pd / pt / pd(111 ) , respectively .",
    "thus , for all considered systems , the lda values are shifted roughly by -0.6  ev with respect to the gga values . in the case of all ( 100 ) surfaces ,",
    "ch@xmath14 on top of metal atoms and h on bridge sites are the most stable adsorption configurations . on pd(100 ) and pd / pt / pd(100 ) , dissociative adsorption of methane is found to be endothermic , in agreement with dft calculations in  @xcite . only on pt(100 ) , methane adsorption is exothermic with an adsorption energy of -0.31 ev .      after analyzing methane adsorption on clean metal surfaces ,",
    "we investigate here the adsorption on metal surfaces covered with 1 ml oxygen .",
    "a first set of calculations is performed starting with 1  ml of oxygen adsorbed solely _ on _ the ( 111 ) surface . as initial condition for the dft calculations ,",

    "the largest adsorption energies are obtained starting with ch@xmath14 on top of a metal atom and h on top of an oxygen atom . in particular , the adsorption energy on pd / pt / pd(111 ) is slightly higher than on pd(111 ) . in the latter two cases",
    ", structural optimization leads to a remarkable reconstruction of the adsorbate layer ( fig .",
    "[ ch4_config_pd](a ) ) . both the ch@xmath14 group and the h atom move away from their initial adsorption sites and bind to the same o atom , thus forming an adsorbed methanol molecule .",
    "notably , if ch@xmath14 and h are initially placed over other adsorption sites on pd(111 ) , ch@xmath14 and h also detach from the metal atoms , but bind separately to different o atoms of the surface , resulting in adsorbed oh and ch@xmath14o groups and no methanol formation . the same is found in the case of the pt(111 ) surface where ch@xmath14 and h remain bound to separate sites . in this case , the pt atoms to which ch@xmath14 is bound",

    ", we analyze a slab of five pdo layers covered with a mixed pd@xmath2pt@xmath3o layer , in which pd and pt are arranged in a chess - like pattern for @xmath50 ( adsorption energies for the row - like pd - pt pattern differ less than 0.025  ev from the chess - like one ) .",
    "our analysis shows that on the ( 100 ) surface ch@xmath14 and h adsorb preferentially on top of oxygen atoms , in agreement with previous calculations @xcite ( fig .",
    "[ thin_diss_str](a ) ) . on the ( 101 ) surface ,",
    "h adsorbs on top of oxygen and ch@xmath14 on top of metal atoms , preferentially on pt in the case of a mixed pd - pt bulk oxide , as also found for the thin oxide layer in the previous section ( fig .",
    "[ thin_diss_str](b ) ) .",
    "the calculated adsorption energies on the different surfaces are listed in table  [ diss_pdo ] . with increasing pt content in the oxide , a monotonously decreasing driving force for methane adsorption is found on pdo(100 ) , whereas on pd(101 ) the adsorption energy displays a non - trivial dependence on the pt content , similarly as in the case of the thin pd(101)-like oxide layer considered above .",
    "unlike the case of thin pdo - like oxide layers , where methane adsorption is endothermic , for the pdo bulk phase , the adsorption reaction is exothermic . regarding the dependence of the adsorption energy on the oxide composition , the largest value of -1.0  ev is obtained for the ( 100 ) surface of pure pdo ( cf .",
    "[ ch4_config_thin](a ) ) .",
    "this value is however considerably lower than the energy values calculated for the pt@xmath14o@xmath11-like oxide layers on pt(100 ) and for the oxygen adlayers on pd(111 ) ( cf .",
    "[ ch4_diss_thin](c ) and table  2 ) .",
    "the dissociative adsorption of methane on noble metal surfaces represents an essential reaction step of the catalytic combustion of methane , and is thought to limit the reaction kinetics . as a first effort towards a deeper understanding of this catalytic reaction , we have studied methane adsorption on various oxide structures of pd , pt and pd - pt alloy surfaces .",
    "the choice of the investigated systems is motivated by the facts that palladium oxide phases , in particular pdo , have been suggested to be catalytically more active than pure pd  @xcite , and that mixed pd - pt catalysts have been found to possess higher conversion efficiency for methane combustion , especially on the long term .",
    "our investigation includes chemisorbed o atoms , thin oxide layers and bulk pdo - like oxide surfaces , addressing both their thermodynamic stability and their reactivity towards methane dissociation .",
    "the thermodynamic stability of different oxidized pd - pt structures has been addressed by calculating average oxygen binding energies at 0  k. in general , superficial oxide layers are found to be more stable than oxygen adlayers(including sub - surface o atoms ) at the corresponding oxygen coverages , as displayed in table  2 and fig .",
    "[ binding_oxide ] . the larger stability of oxygen adlayers on pd compared to those on pt can be understood simply from the lower electronegativity of palladium .",
    "consistently with previous findings  @xcite , the largest binding energy is found for a pd / pt / pd(111 ) layer stack , due to the partial donation of electrons from the pd surface layer to the pt sub - surface layer , which increases the surface reactivity .    in the case of surface oxide layers ,",
    "the pd - pt composition of the outermost layer of the metal substrate has only a minor influence on the oxygen binding strength .",
    "changes of the binding strength due to varying the pd / pt ratio in the oxide can be explained on the basis of the stability of the corresponding bulk oxide phases , as thoroughly addressed in refs .",
    "namely , mixed oxides with pdo structure are destabilized by replacing pd atoms with pt , while mixed oxides with @xmath12-pto@xmath1 or pt@xmath14o@xmath11 structure are destabilized by replacing pt atoms with pd .      concerning the dissociative adsorption of methane , our dft calculations at the gga level suggest , in agreement with existing literature  @xcite , that pd metal surfaces are not reactive , and pt surfaces are only little reactive . since ch@xmath14 and h possess an electron - donor character , they are expected to bind better to electronegative elements .",
    "indeed , binding to pure pt ( electronegativity 2.3 on the pauling scale ) is stronger than to pure pd ( electronegativity 2.2 ) .",
    "however , if adsorbed oxygen ( electronegativity 3.4 ) is present on the surface , either in the form of an oxygen adlayer or as surface oxide , then binding to oxygen provides a strong driving force for methane dissociation .",
    "correspondingly , we have obtained the largest adsorption energies for 1  ml of oxygen adsorbed on the ( 111 ) metal surfaces , in particular on pd(111 ) and on the pd / pt / pd(111 ) layer stack , with an energy gain of about -2.4 ev ( cf .",
    "table 2 ) .",
    "a peculiar effect observed on the latter two surfaces is the spontaneous formation of a methanol molecule which remains only loosely bound to the surface via hydrogen bonds and weak metal - oxygen interactions ( fig .",
    "[ ch4_config_pd](a ) ) .",
    "we observe a net thermodynamic preference for methanol formation on all three surfaces considered , with the largest values being obtained on pd(111 ) .",
    "an analysis of the energy barriers associated with the ch@xmath11 @xmath51 ch@xmath14oh conversion reaction exceeds the scope of the present investigation .",
    "however , the possibility of a direct methane to methanol conversion on the ( 111 ) surface of transition metals has been recently put forward in a theoretical dft study  @xcite .",
    "it has to be noted , however , that the further combustion of methanol on pd - pt surfaces is expected to take place at the temperatures required to dissociate the c - h bonds of methane .",
    "therefore , in general the selectivity towards methanol formation is found to decrease by increasing the overall conversion efficiency  @xcite .    in the case of superficial oxide layers formed on pd - pt",
    ", we have found that methane adsorption is clearly endothermic both on the thin pdo(101)-like layer on ( 100 ) surfaces and on the thin @xmath12-pto@xmath1-like layer on ( 111 ) surfaces .",
    "since the same was noted for oxidation of carbon monoxide @xcite , these phases may be considered as a kind of passivation layer on the metal substrate , whose formation may suddenly reduce the oxidation activity of the catalysts . this property ,",
    "however , is not shared by the surfaces of bulk oxides , where both the ( 101 ) and the ( 100 ) surfaces are reactive towards methane dissociation ( table 3 ) .",
    "this behavior can be understood by considering the charge transfer between the ch@xmath14 molecule and the surface atoms . according to a bader analysis , in the case of bulk pdo",
    ", the ch@xmath14 molecule donates electrons to the surface and becomes positively charged ( + 0.44e ) , while in the case of the pdo - like oxide layer ch@xmath14 gains electrons ( -0.13e ) .",
    "this indicates a strongly reduced electronegativity of the metal atoms of the thin oxide layer due to the presence of the underlying metal substrate , compared with the surfaces of bulk oxides . as a consequence , binding of ch@xmath14 to the surface of the bulk oxide is favorable , in contrast to the oxide monolayer over the metal substrate .",
    "this finding is consistent with experimental observations that oxidation of pd with formation of pdo is beneficial for methane oxidation @xcite . in comparison ,",
    "bulk @xmath12-pto@xmath1 is inert with respect to methane dissociation in the absence of defects ( see also ref .  @xcite ) .",
    "this again is consistent with observations that formation of bulk oxide phases is beneficial for methane oxidation on pd , but not on pt @xcite .",
    "oxidation of pt might be beneficial if the reaction conditions allow the formation of pt@xmath14o@xmath11-like phases ( see also the discussion in @xcite ) .",
    "namely , our dft calculations predict adsorption energies of ch@xmath14 and h on pt@xmath14o@xmath11 and pd@xmath14o@xmath11 which are higher than those on pdo surfaces and comparable with that on oxygen adlayers covering pd(111 ) .",
    "this is due to the availability of undercoordinated oxygen sites on the exposed pt@xmath14o@xmath11(100 ) surface , to which electron acception from ch@xmath14 and h is very favorable .",
    "concerning effects on methane adsorption resulting from pd - pt alloying , we note that in most of our calculations the composition of the metal substrate underneath the thin oxide layer does not show a pronounced effect on the methane adsorption energy .",
    "however , the effect of the composition of the oxide layer is evident and the reactivity decreases with increasing pt content .",
    "an exception is the thin pdo(101)-like oxide layer on ( 100 ) surfaces , where the ch@xmath14 group binds preferentially to the metal atom rather than to oxygen . in this case",
    ", the presence of pt atoms does increase the reactivity since they are stronger electron acceptors , as mentioned above .",
    "however , at the same time the presence of pt results in a decrease of the reactivity of the o atoms towards the adsorption of h. these two counteracting effects result in a non - trivial trend of the computed adsorption energies with increasing pt content , both in the case of the thin layers ( fig .  [ ch4_diss_thin ] ) and of bulk pdo(101 ) ( table  3 ) .",
    "the actual adsorption energies in this case depend on the specific arrangements of pt , pd and o atoms close to the adsorption sites of ch@xmath14 and h , both in the oxide layer and in the metal substrate .",
    "however , in none of the cases considered is the adsorption reaction exothermic , as discussed previously .",
    "in conclusion , we have performed extensive calculations of the driving force for methane dissociation on clean and oxidized pd - pt surfaces . both in the case of pd and pt , formation of stable thin layer oxide structures such as the pdo(101)-like layer on the ( 100 ) surface and the @xmath12-pto@xmath1-like layer on the ( 111 ) surface , leads to a reactivity loss towards the dissociative adsorption of methane .",
    "methane adsorption is instead favored on metastable surface oxide structures such as a pt@xmath14o@xmath11-like layer , whose reactivity increases with increasing pd content .",
    "furthermore , reactivity is recovered for exposed surfaces of _ bulk _ pdo , consistently with existing experimental results  @xcite .",
    "in the case of oxygen adlayers we have found that the formation of a methanol molecule after methane dissociation is thermodynamically favored .",
    "this may suggest that selective conversion of methane to methanol rather than total oxidation can be achieved under pressure and temperature conditions that prevent the formation of surface oxides .",
    "however , the further combustion of the produced methanol over other sites of the pd - pt surface can not be excluded , reducing the selectivity of the conversion reaction . as a final remark",
    ", we would like to note that our investigation , being concerned with the thermodynamic driving force for the methane dissociation reaction , should be considered only as a preliminary indication about the reactivity of different surface structures . based on the results presented here",
    ", more thorough calculations of the corresponding activation barriers , which can be directly related to the kinetic constants for adsorption , shall be the subject of forthcoming works .",
