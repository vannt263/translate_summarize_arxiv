    "the investigation of the baryon spectrum and the baryon couplings from experimental data are two of the most important issues in hadronic physics and they are attracting much attention .",
    "both on the experimental and theoretical sides , the nucleon excited states below @xmath7 gev have been extensively studied  @xcite . however , the current information for the properties of states around or above @xmath7 gev is scarce  @xcite . on the other hand in this region of energies , many theoretical approaches ( constituent quark  @xcite and chiral unitary  @xcite ) predict predicted _ missing @xmath8 states _ , which have not been so far observed .",
    "hence , the study of the possible role played by the @xmath7 gev region nucleon resonances in the available accurate data is timely and could shed light into the complicated dynamics that governs the high excited nucleon spectrum .",
    "the associate @xmath9 photon and hadronic production reactions might be adequate to study the @xmath8 resonances around @xmath7 gev , as long as they have significant couplings to the @xmath0 pair .",
    "this is because the @xmath0 is a pure isospin @xmath10 channel and the threshold is about @xmath7 gev .",
    "besides , these reactions require the creation of an @xmath11 quark pair .",
    "thus , a thorough and dedicated study of the strangeness production mechanism in these reactions has the potential to gain a deeper understanding of the interaction among strange hadrons and also on the nature of the nucleon resonances .",
    "recently , there have been several measurements for the @xmath12 reaction  @xcite .",
    "these data suggest that there is a sizeable contribution of total and differential cross sections from the nucleon resonances with masses around @xmath13 gev . on the theoretical side , in addition to the contributions from @xmath14 and @xmath15 exchange in the @xmath16channel and the contact term ,",
    "the contributions from the nucleon states , including the @xmath4 , in the @xmath17channel  @xcite and the @xmath18 pole in the @xmath19channel have been studied  @xcite .",
    "the theoretical results show that when the contributions from the @xmath4 resonance and the @xmath18 are taken into account , the current experimental data  @xcite can be well described .",
    "thus , it is becoming clear that the current experimental data for @xmath20 photoproduction favor the existence of the @xmath4 resonance , and that these measurements can be used to further constrain its properties . on the other hand , based on the results of @xmath1 reaction ,",
    "the @xmath0 production in the @xmath21 and @xmath3 hadronic processes are also studied , paying an special attention to the contributions from the @xmath4 resonance  @xcite . in the present work , we will review the main results from these theoretical studies .",

    "[ dcs - deg ] , the theoretical calculations provides a fair description of these backward @xmath26 angular data thanks to the contribution from the @xmath39 pole term in the @xmath19channel .",
    "furthermore , for the total cross section , due to an important contribution from the photo - excitation of the @xmath4 resonance and its subsequent decay into a @xmath40 pair , the theoretical results can describe the clas data  @xcite very well ( see right panel of fig .",

    "we see that we can describe the experimental data of total cross sections quite well , while the @xmath17channel nucleon pole and @xmath4 resonance and also the @xmath19channel @xmath52 exchange give the dominant contributions below @xmath56 gev .",

    "it is worth to note that our predictions for the total @xmath61 cross section , at @xmath62 gev , is @xmath63 , which is @xmath64 times smaller than the experimental upper limit of @xmath65 as measured by the cosy - anke collaboration  @xcite .",
    "this shows that our model predictions are consistent with the experimental results .",
    "moreover , the total cross section of the @xmath60 reaction has been also measured with hades  @xcite at gsi for a kinetic energy @xmath66 gev ( corresponding to @xmath67 gev ) .",
    "the result is @xmath68b , as shown in fig .",
    "[ pptcs ] , this is to be compared with our theoretical result , @xmath69b . however ,",
    "if we modify the cut off parameters @xmath70 and @xmath71 from 1.3 gev to 1.0 gev , we get @xmath72b , which would be in agreement with the experimental data .",
    "however , it does not make sense to fit only one data point .",
    "so we still keep @xmath73 = 1.3 gev as used in many previous works  @xcite .",
    "we should also mention that , in the present calculation , we did not include the @xmath74 final - state - interaction ( fsi ) , which can increase the results even by a factor of 10 at the very near threshold region , similarly to the important role played by @xmath75 fsi in the @xmath76 reaction  @xcite .",
    "we ignore this effect because there are no experimental data on this reaction and also very scarce information about the @xmath74 fsi .",
    "furthermore , the corresponding momentum distributions of the final proton and @xmath26 meson , the @xmath0 invariant mass spectrum , and also the dalitz plot for the @xmath77 reaction at beam momentum @xmath78 gev , which is accessible for disto collaboration  @xcite , are calculated and shown in fig .",

    "we have reviewed the role of @xmath4 resonance in the associate @xmath0 photon and hadronic productions at low energies within an effective lagrangian approach and the isobar model .",
    "in addition to the contact , @xmath16channel @xmath80 exchange , and @xmath17channel nucleon pole contributions , the contributions from the @xmath19channel @xmath18 hyperon pole term and @xmath81 resonance are also considered .",
    "the results show that when the contributions from the @xmath4 resonance and the @xmath18 are taken into account , both the new clas  @xcite and the previous leps data  @xcite for the @xmath12 reaction can be simultaneously described .    actually , we find an overall good description of the data , both at forward and backward @xmath26 angles , and for the whole range of measured @xmath82 invariant masses .",
    "the contribution of the @xmath19channel @xmath38 pole term produces an enhancement at backward angles , and it becomes more and more relevant as the photon energy increases , becoming essential above @xmath83 gev and @xmath84 . on the other hand , the clas data , clearly support the existence of a spin - parity @xmath85 nucleon resonance with a mass around 2.1 gev , a width of at least 200 mev and a large partial decay width into @xmath86 .",
    "these characteristics could be easily accommodated within the constituent quark model results of simon capstick and w. roberts of ref .",
    "such resonance might be identified with the two stars pdg @xmath4 state , which would confirm previous claims  @xcite from the analysis of the bump structure in the leps differential cross section at forward @xmath26 angles discussed in fig .",
