    "nowadays , more and more high data rate applications , such as video streaming , are supported by wireless networks .",
    "it is envisioned that future 5 g wireless systems should offer 1000x increase in capacity .",
    "one key technology to achieve this challenging goal is by means of cooperative mimo ( comp ) @xcite because it can transform the cross - link interference into spatial multiplexing gain .",
    "however , comp technique requires high capacity backhaul for payload exchange between bss , which is a cost bottleneck for large scale deployment of comp in dense small cell networks . on the other hand ,",
    "cooperative relay has been proposed as an alternative technique to improve the performance of wireless networks without expensive backhaul .",
    "however , it can only contribute to coverage and snr gain and the overall capacity gain is marginal @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we propose a novel solution framework , namely the _ cache - enabled opportunistic comp _ , to fully unleash the benefits of comp without expensive payload backhaul . by introducing cache at the relay ( rs ) , we can opportunistically transform a relay channel into a comp broadcast channel and achieve not only snr gain but also spatial multiplexing gain . due to the absence of payload backhaul , such a solution is very attractive for dense small cell networks . in traditional wireless networks ,",
    "the information bits are treated as random bits and hence , the capacity is limited by the underlying network topology .",
    "however , in future wireless networks , the source should be viewed as _ content _ rather than random bits .",
    "for example , it is envisioned that a significant portion of the 1000x capacity demand in 5 g systems comes from video streaming applications .",
    "as such , a large portion of video traffic corresponds to a few popular video files which are requested by many users .",
    "there are huge correlations between the information accessed by users and such information is _ cachable _ at the rs .",
    "if a user accesses a content which exists in the rs cache , the bs and the rs can engage in comp and therefore , enjoy spatial multiplexing gain in addition to snr gain .",
    "hence , with proper caching strategy , a large portion of backhaul usage can be replaced by the cache .",
    "since the cost of hard disks is much lower than the cost of optical fiber backhaul , the proposed solution is very cost effective .",
    "yet , the opportunity of comp in the information flows depends heavily on the dynamic caching strategy .",
    "caching has been widely used in fixed line p2p systems @xcite and content distribution networks ( cdns ) @xcite .",
    "the benefits of caching in these cases mainly come from reducing the number of hops from the content source to the consumers .",
    "however , we have a fundamentally different caching cost and reward dynamics in the wireless scenario .",
    "in addition to the common advantage of bringing the content close to the consumers , there is a unique advantage of cache - induced topology change in the physical layer ( dynamic comp opportunity ) of the wireless systems . as such",
    ", one can not directly adopt conventional caching algorithms in the fixed line networks . in @xcite ,",
    "a femtocaching scheme is proposed by using small bss called helpers with high storage capacity cache popular video files .",
    "however , the femtocaching scheme does not consider cache - enabled opportunistic comp among the bs and local helpers .",
    "hence , the cache control in @xcite is independent of the physical layer and is fundamentally different from our case where the cache control and physical layer are coupled together . in our recent paper @xcite , we studied a mixed - timescale optimization of mimo precoding and cache control for mimo interference networks employing the cache - enabled opportunistic comp .",
    "however , the cache control and mimo precoding algorithms in @xcite can only be used to guarantee the physical layer qos ( fixed data rate requirement for each user ) and the mimo precoder is not adaptive to the qsi at the mobile users .    in this paper",
    ", we study two timescale joint optimization of power and cache control to support real - time video - on - demand ( vod ) applications .",
    "the role of cache control is to create ( induce ) more comp opportunities and is adaptive to long - term popularity of the video files ( long - term control ) .",
    "the role of dynamic power control is to exploit the comp opportunities ( induced by the cache ) to strike a balance between capacity gain and the _ urgency _ between information flows . as such , it is adaptive to the instantaneous csi , the _ cache state _ at the rs and the qsi at the mobile users .",
    "there are several technical challenges to be addressed .    *",
    "* cache size requirement * : the performance gain of the proposed scheme depends heavily on the comp opportunity , which in turn depends on the cache size and cache algorithm .",
    "the rs usually does not have enough cache to store all the video files . as will be shown in example [ naive - cahce - scheme ] ,",
    "when brute force caching is used , even if a significant portion of the video files are cached at rs , the comp opportunity can still be very small and this is highly undesirable . * * unknown video file popularity * : in many cases , the rs does not have the knowledge of the * * popularity of the video files .",
    "hence , the cache control must have the ability to automatically learn the popularity of video files . * * challenge of qos requirement * : it is important to dynamically control the transmit powers at the bs and the rs based on the csi , cache state ( reveals good opportunities of transmission ) and the qsi ( reveals urgency of the data flow ) at the mobile in order to maintain low interruption probability during video playback .",
    "yet , the optimization belongs to the infinite horizon markov decision process ( mdp ) @xcite , which is well - known to be very challenging . * * complex coupling between cache and power control * : the cache control will affect the physical layer dynamics seen by power control due to different comp opportunities .",
    "furthermore , the optimization objective of the cache control ( long - term ) depends on the optimal power solution as well as the average cost of the mdp . however , there are no closed - form characterizations for them .    to address the above challenges , we first propose a novel cache data structure called _ mds - coded random cache _ which can significantly improve the probability of comp .",
    "we then exploit the timescale separations of the control variables to decompose the problem into an _ inner power control problem _ and an _",
    "outer cache control problem_. to solve the inner power control problem , we exploit a specific problem structure and derive an approximate bellman equation . based on this",
    ", we derive a closed - form approximation for the value function , the power control policy as well as the average cost . to solve the outer cache control problem , we exploit these closed form approximations for the inner problem and transform the outer problem into a convex stochastic optimization problem .",
    "then we propose a stochastic subgradient algorithm to solve it .",
    "we show that the proposed solution is asymptotically optimal for high snr and small timeslot duration . finally , we illustrate with simulations that the proposed solution achieves significant gain over various baselines .",

    "the notation @xmath5 represents the subspace spanned by the columns of a matrix @xmath6 .",
    "in this section , we introduce the architecture of the video streaming system , the physical layer ( opportunistic comp ) , the mds - coded random cache scheme that supports opportunistic comp , and the queue model .      the architecture of the video streaming system is illustrated in fig .",

    "[ fig : system_model ] . on the other hand ,",
    "the rs has no fixed line backhaul connection with the bs and it is equipped with a cache . in this paper , the time is partitioned into time slots indexed by @xmath17 with slot duration @xmath18 .",
    "the ran is the performance bottleneck of the system . without cache at the rs , the ran forms a mimo relay channel and the conventional relay techniques",

    "we propose a cache - enabled opportunistic comp which can opportunistically use the cached video packets at the rs to transform a relay channel into a comp broadcast channel as illustrated in fig .",
    "1 . as a result , the ran can enjoy the additional spatial multiplexing gain @xcite without expensive backhauls .",
