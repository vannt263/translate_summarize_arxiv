    "the cases of plasmas with @xmath287 and @xmath288 in the region @xmath289 were considered .",
    "the conductivities were determined by means of corrected spitzer s expression @xcite where debye s radius @xmath78 for two - component plasma is replaced ( in so called coulomb logarithm ) by screening radius @xmath273 .",

    "one can see that use of @xmath293 provides the complete agreement with the results of rpa calculations in the case @xmath295 .",
    "it is important that this agreement becomes better when the non - ideality degree increases .",
    "the new model method for describing of the electrostatic screening in single- and two - components systems ( electron - ion plasmas , dusty plasmas , some electrolytes , etc . ) developed in part  1 and part  2 of this work , generates a group of new screening parameters . here",
    ", we keep in mind `` small '' characteristic length @xmath59 and the non - ideality parameters @xmath75 and @xmath296 in the single - component case , and the corresponding characteristic lengths @xmath49 and the non - ideality parameters @xmath172 and @xmath173 in the two - component case .    in connection with the mentioned screening parameters",
    "is established that @xmath59 and @xmath49 represent the generalization of classical landau s radii @xmath61 and @xmath174 , and @xmath297 , @xmath172 and @xmath173 - the generalization of known classical non - ideality parameters @xmath72 and @xmath73 in the single - component case , and @xmath193 and @xmath194 in the two - component case .",
    "apart of that , in this paper are introduced into consideration `` medium '' and `` large '' characteristic lengths @xmath95 and @xmath130 in the single - component case , and @xmath201 and @xmath285 in the two - component case .",
    "the behavior of these radii is examined in the whole regions @xmath298 and @xmath299 , where @xmath107 and @xmath248 are the corresponding screening constants , and @xmath21 and @xmath54- the corresponding wigner - seitz s radii .",

    "@xmath301 @xmath302 where @xmath81 and @xmath185 .",
    "these relations establish the two hierarchy systems of the characteristic lengths , and causes a redefinition of wigner - seitz s radii as a boundary screening lengths .",

    "it was found their very good agreement .    finally , we wish to draw attention that developed method is suitable for some astrophysical applications . here",
    "we keep in mind that in outer shells of stars the physical conditions change from those which correspond to the rare , practically ideal plasma , to those which correspond to extremely dense non - ideal one .",
    "however , the method presented gives a possibility to describe the electrostatic screening of all such outer shells in the same way , by means of the obtained screening characteristics .",
    "the authors are thankful to the university p. et m. curie of paris ( france ) for financial support , as well as to the ministry of science of the republic of serbia for support within the project 141033 `` non - ideal laboratorial and ionospheric plasmas : properties and applications '' .",
    "the method developed in part  1 and part  2 serve for describing of the electrostatic screening in the single- and two - component systems which contain only charged particles .",
    "however , as it is well known , the presence of the neutral component in plasma can often be neglected from the aspect of inner - plasma screening .",
    "it gives the possibility to apply the results obtained in this work on the problem of the lowering of the atomic ionization potential in plasmas with the neutral component ( see part  1 ) .",
    "in such a way we will be able to compare the results obtained within the developed and dh method .",
    "the results of this comparison will give another important example of the inapplicability of dh method .",
    "in this context we will remind that in part  2 the potential energies @xmath307 and @xmath308 of the ion and electron in plasma were determined . in the case @xmath178 and @xmath179 , when @xmath309 , the ion potential energy @xmath307 was compared with the corresponding dh ion potential energy @xmath310 .",
    "then , we will denote with @xmath311 and @xmath312 the atomic ionization potential determined within the developed and dh method , and take into account that @xmath313 and @xmath314 where the proportionality coefficients are equal or at least very closed . from here",
    "it follows the relation @xmath315 the behavior of the right side of this relation is shown in fig .  5 of part  2 .",
    "accordingly to this figure we can conclude that @xmath316 in the whole region @xmath317 .",
    "it is important to noted this fact , since the handbooks ( see also @xcite ) , often used in laboratories , recommend just dh lowering of the atom ionization potential @xmath318 , which would not be taken as one of screening characteristics of electron - ion plasmas ."
