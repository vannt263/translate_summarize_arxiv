    "at this writing ( may 2000 ) the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) is ending its commissioning phase and beginning operations .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to provide a concise summary of the vital statistics of the project , a definition of some of the terms used in the survey and , via links to documentation in electronic form , access to detailed descriptions of the project s design , hardware , and software , to serve as technical background for the project s science papers .",
    "the electronic material is extracted from the text ( the `` project book '' ) written to support major funding proposals , and is available at the _ astronomical journal _ web site via the on - line version of this paper .",
    "the official sdss web site ( http://www.sdss.org ) also provides links to the on - line project book , and it can be accessed directly at http://www.astro.princeton.edu/pbook/welcome.htm . in the discussion below",
    "we reference the chapters in the project book by the last part of the url , i.e. that following pbook/. the versions accessible at the sdss web sites also contain extensive discussions and summaries of the scientific goals of the survey , which are not included here .",
    "the text of the on - line project book was last updated in august 1997 .",
    "while there have been a number of changes in the hardware and software described therein , the material accurately describes the design goals and the implementation of the major observing subsystems . as the project becomes operational",
    ", we will provide a series of formal technical papers ( most still in preparation ) , which will describe in detail the project hardware and software in its actual operational state .",
    "section 2 describes the survey s objectives : the imaging depth , sky coverage , and instrumentation .",
    "section 3 summarizes the software and data reduction components of the sdss and its data products .",
    "section 4 reviews some recent scientific results from the project s initial commissioning data runs , which demonstrate the ability of the project to reach its technical goals .",
    "all celestial coordinates are in epoch j2000 .",
    "the sloan digital sky survey will produce both imaging and spectroscopic surveys over a large area of the sky .",
    "the survey uses a dedicated 2.5 m telescope equipped with a large format mosaic ccd camera to image the sky in five optical bands , and two digital spectrographs to obtain the spectra of about one million galaxies and 100,000 quasars selected from the imaging data .",
    "the sdss calibrates its photometry using observations of a network of standard stars established by the united states naval observatory ( usno ) 1 m telescope , and its astrometry using observations by an array of astrometric ccds in the imaging camera .",
    "the sdss telescope is a 2.5 m f/5 modified ritchey - chrtien wide - field altitude - azimuth telescope ( see telescop / telescop.htm ) located at the apache point observatory ( apo ) , sunspot , new mexico ( site / site.htm ) . the telescope achieves a very wide ( @xmath5 ) distortion - free field by the use of a large secondary mirror and two corrector lenses .",
    "it is equipped with the photometric / astrometric mosaic camera ( camera / camera.htm , gunn et al .",
    "1998 ) and images the sky by scanning along great circles at the sidereal rate .",
    "the imaging camera mounts at the cassegrain focus .",
    "the telescope is also equipped with two double fiber - fed spectrographs , permanently mounted on the image rotator , since the spectrographs are fiber fed .",
    "this ensures that the fibers do not flex during an exposure .",
    "the telescope is changed from imaging mode to spectroscopic mode by removing the imaging camera and mounting at the cassegrain focus a fiber plug plate , individually drilled for each field , which feeds the spectrographs . in survey operations , it is expected that up to nine spectroscopic plates per night will be observed , with the necessary plates being plugged with fibers during the day . the telescope mounting and enclosure allow easy access for rapid changes between fiber plug plates and between spectroscopic and imaging modes .",
    "this strategy allows imaging to be done in pristine observing conditions ( photometric sky , image size @xmath6 fwhm ) and spectroscopy to be done during less ideal conditions .",
    "all observing will be done in moonless sky .    besides the 2.5 m telescope",
    ", the sdss makes use of three subsidiary instruments at the site . the _ photometric telescope _ ( pt ) is a 0.5 m telescope equipped with a ccd camera and the sdss filter set .",
    "its task is to calibrate the photometry .",
    "two instruments , a _ seeing monitor _ and a 10@xmath7 m _ cloud scanner _",
    "( hull et al .",
    "1995 ; site / site.htm ) monitor the astronomical weather .",
    "the sdss imaging camera contains two sets of ccd arrays : the imaging array and the astrometric arrays ( camera / camera.htm , gunn et al .",
    "1998 ) .",
    "the _ imaging array _ consists of 30 2048 @xmath8 2048 tektronix ccds , placed in an array of six columns and five rows .",
    "the telescope scanning is aligned with the columns .",
    "each row observes the sky through a different filter , in temporal sequence @xmath9 , and @xmath10 .",
    "the pixel size is 24@xmath11 ( @xmath12 on the sky ) .",
    "the imaging survey is taken in drift - scan ( time - delay - and - integrate , or tdi ) mode , i.e. the camera continually sweeps the sky in great circles , and a given point on the sky passes through the five filters in succession .",
    "the effective integration time per filter is 54.1 seconds , and the time for passage over the entire photometric array is about 5.7 minutes ( strategy / strategy.htm ; gunn et al .",
    "1998 ) . since the camera contains six columns of ccds ,",
    "the result is a long _ strip _ of six _ scanlines _ , containing almost simultaneously observed five - color data for each of the six ccd columns .",
    "each ccd observes a swath of sky @xmath13 wide .",
    "the ccds are separated in the _ row _ direction ( i.e. perpendicular to the scan direction ) by 91.0 mm ( @xmath14 on the sky ) center - to - center .",
    "the observations are filled in by a second strip , offset from the first by 93% of the ccd width , to produce a filled _ stripe _ , @xmath15 wide , with 8% ( @xmath16 ) lateral overlap on each side .",
    "because of the camera s large field of view , the tdi tracking must be done along great circles .",
    "the northern galactic cap is covered by 45 great - circle arcs ( shown projected on the sky in figures 1 and 2 ) .",
    "the five filters in the imaging array of the camera , [ @xmath17 and @xmath18 have effective wavelengths of [ 3590  , 4810  , 6230  , 7640  and 9060  ] ( fukugita et al .",
    "1996 ; gunn et al .",
    "an a priori model estimate of the telescope and camera throughputs and of the sky brightness predicted that we would reach the 5@xmath19 detection limit for point sources in @xmath20 seeing at [ 22.3 , 23.3 , 23.1 , 22.3 , 20.8 ] in the ( @xmath21 ) filters , respectively , at an airmass of 1.4 .",
    "we have put formal requirements on throughput at 75% of the values used for the above estimation , and have demonstrated that we meet this requirement in all bands with the possible exception of @xmath22 .",
    "the sensitivity limit can be tested by finding the magnitude at which repeat observations of a given area of sky yield 50% reproducibility of the objects detected .",
    "this has been tested most thoroughly with data taken in less than optimal seeing ( @xmath23 ) ; nevertheless , the 50% reproducibility level lies within a few tenths of a magnitude of the above - quoted 5@xmath19 detection limit in all five bands ( see ivezi et al .",
    "the sdss science requirements demand that photometric calibration uncertainties for point sources be 0.02 in @xmath24 , 0.02 in @xmath25 and @xmath26 , and 0.03 in @xmath27 and @xmath28 . to meet these stringent requirements in both signal - to - noise ratio and photometricity ,",
    "imaging data are declared to be survey quality only if the pt determines that the night is photometric , with a zero - point uncertainty below 1% , and if the seeing is better than @xmath29 .",
    "the imaging data saturate at about [ 13 , 14 , 14 , 14 , 12 ] magnitudes for point sources .",
    "the magnitude scale is on the @xmath30 system ( oke 1969 , unpublished ) , which was updated to the @xmath31 system by oke & gunn ( 1983 ) and to @xmath32 by fukugita et al .",
    "the magnitudes m are related to flux density @xmath33 by m@xmath34 rather than logarithmically ( see lupton , gunn & szalay 1999 and fan et al . 1999 ) .",
    "this definition is essentially identical to the logarithmic magnitude at signal - to - noise ratios greater than about 5 and is well behaved for low and even zero and negative flux densities .",
    "the calibration and definition of the magnitude system is carried out by the usno 1 m telescope and the 0.5 m pt .",
    "the sdss photometry is placed on the @xmath30 system using three _ fundamental standards _",
    "( @xmath35 , @xmath36 , and @xmath37 ) , whose magnitude scale is as defined by fukugita et al .",
    "( 1996 ) ; a set of 157 _ primary standards _ , which are calibrated by the above fundamental standards using the usno 1 m telescope , and which cover the whole range of right ascension and enable the calibration system to be made self - consistent ; and a set of _ secondary calibration patches _ lying across the imaging stripes , containing stars fainter than @xmath38 whose",
    "magnitudes are calibrated by the pt with respect to those of the primary standards and which transfer that calibration to the imaging survey .",
    "the locations of these patches on the survey stripes are shown in figure 1 . on nights",
    "when the 2.5 m is observing , the pt observes primary standard stars to provide the atmospheric extinction coefficients over the night and to confirm that the night is photometric .",
    "the standard star network is described in photcal / photcal.htm  note that the telescope described there has now been replaced by the 0.5 m pt .",
    "the camera also contains leading and trailing _ astrometric arrays _  narrow ( 128@xmath82048 ) , neutral - density - filtered , @xmath24-filtered ccds covering the entire width of the camera .",
    "these arrays can measure objects in the magnitude range @xmath39 8.5 - 16.8 , i.e. they cover the dynamic range between the standard astrometric catalog stars and the brightest unsaturated stars in the photometric array . the astrometric calibration is thereby referenced to the fundamental astrometric catalogues ( see astrom / astrom.htm ) , using the hipparcos and tycho catalogues ( esa 1997 ) and specially observed equatorial fields ( stone et al .",
    "comparison with positions from the first ( becker et al .",
    "1995 ) and 2mass ( skrutskie 1999 ) catalogues shows that the rms astrometric accuracy is currently better than 150 milliarcseconds ( mas ) in each coordinate .",
    "the imaging survey covers about 10,000 contiguous square degrees in the northern galactic cap .",
    "this area lies basically above galactic latitude @xmath1 , but its footprint is adjusted slightly to lie within the minimum of the galactic extinction contours ( schlegel , finkbeiner & davis 1998 ) , resulting in an elliptical region .",
    "the region is centered at @xmath40 , @xmath41 .",
    "the minor axis is at an angle @xmath42 east of north with extent @xmath43 .",
    "the major axis is a great circle perpendicular to the minor axis with extent @xmath44 .",
    "the survey footprint with the location of the stripes is shown in figure 2  see strategy / strategy.htm for details .      in the south galactic cap , three stripes",
    "will be observed , one along the celestial equator and the other two north and south of the equator ( see figure 2 ) .",
    "the _ equatorial stripe _",
    "( @xmath45 = @xmath46 to @xmath47 , @xmath48 = @xmath49 ) will be observed repeatedly , both to find variable objects and , when co - added , to reach magnitude limits about @xmath50 deeper than the northern imaging survey .",
    "the other two stripes will cover great circles lying between @xmath51 of ( @xmath46 , -@xmath52 , -@xmath53 ) and ( @xmath54 , @xmath55 ) .",
    "objects are detected in the imaging survey , classified as point source or extended , and measured , by the image analysis software ( see below ) .",
    "these imaging data are used to select in a uniform way different classes of objects whose spectra will be taken .",
    "the final details of this _ target selection _ will be described once the survey is well underway ; the criteria discussed here are likely to be very close to those finally used .",
    "two samples of _ galaxies _ are selected from the objects classified as `` extended '' . about @xmath56 galaxies will be selected to have petrosian ( 1976 ) magnitudes @xmath57 17.7 .",
    "galaxies with a mean @xmath24 band surface brightness within the half light radius fainter than 24 magnitudes/@xmath58 will be removed , since spectroscopic observations are unlikely to produce a redshift . for illustrative purposes ,",
    "a simulation of a slice of the sdss redshift survey is shown in figure 3 ( from colley et al .",
    "galaxies in this cdm simulation are ` selected ' by the sdss selection criteria .",
    "as figure 3 demonstrates , the sdss volume is large enough to contain a statistically significant sample of the largest structures predicted .",
    "the second sample , of approximately @xmath4 galaxies , exploits the characteristic very red color and high metallicity ( producing strong absorption lines ) of the most luminous galaxies : the `` brightest cluster galaxies '' or `` bright red galaxies '' ( brgs ) ; redshifts can be well measured with the sdss spectra for these galaxies to about @xmath24 = 19.5 .",
    "galaxies located at the dynamical centers of nearby dense clusters often have these properties .",
    "reasonably accurate photometric redshifts ( connolly et al .",
    "1995 ) can be determined for these galaxies , allowing the selection by magnitude and @xmath59 color of an essentially _ distance limited _ sample of the highest - density regions of the universe to a redshift of about 0.45 ( see figure 4 for a simulation ) .    with their power - law continua and the influence of lyman-@xmath45 emission and the lyman-@xmath45 forest , _ quasars _",
    "have @xmath60 colors quite distinct from those of the vastly more numerous stars over most of their redshift range ( fan 1999 ) .",
    "thus about @xmath61 _ quasar candidates _ are selected for spectroscopic observations as outliers from the stellar locus ( cf .",
    ", krisciunas et al . 1998 ; lenz et al . 1998 ; newberg et al . 1999 ; figure 5 below ) in color - color space . at the cost of some loss of efficiency",
    ", selection is allowed closer to the stellar locus around z = 2.8 , where quasar colors approach those of early f and late a stars ( newberg & yanny 1997 ; fan 1999 ) .",
    "some further regions of color - color space outside the main part of the stellar locus where quasars are very rarely found are also excluded , including the regions containing m dwarf - white dwarf pairs , early a stars , and white dwarfs ( see figure 5 ) .",
    "the sdss will compile a sample of quasars brighter than @xmath62 19 at @xmath63 3.0 ; at redshifts between 3.0 and about 5.2 , the limiting magnitude will be about @xmath64 = 20 .",
    "objects are also required to be point sources , except in the region of color - color space where low - redshift quasars are expected to be found .",
    "stellar objects brighter than @xmath64 = 20 which are first sources ( becker , white and helfand 1995 ) are also selected .",
    "based on early spectroscopy , we estimate that roughly 65% of our quasar candidates are genuine quasars ; comparison with samples of known quasars indicates that our completeness is of order 90% .    in all cases ,",
    "the magnitudes of the objects are corrected for galactic extinction before selection , using extinction in the sdss bands calculated from the reddening map of schlegel , finkbeiner & davis ( 1998 ) .",
    "objects are then selected to have a magnitude limit _",
    "outside _ the galaxy .",
    "if this correction were not made , the systematic effects of galactic extinction over the survey area would overwhelm the statistical uncertainties in the sdss data set .",
    "after the imaging and spectroscopic survey is completed in a given part of the sky , the reddening and extinction will be recalculated using internal standards extracted from the imaging data .",
    "the sdss plans to use a variety of extinction probes , including very hot halo subdwarfs , halo turnoff stars , and elliptical galaxies whose intrinsic colors can be estimated from their line indices .",
    "together with various classes of calibration stars and fibers which observe blank sky to measure the sky spectrum , the selected galaxies and quasars are mapped onto the sky , and ` tiled ' , i.e. their location on a @xmath5 diameter plug plate determined ( tiling / tiling.htm ) .",
    "the centers of the tiles are adjusted to provide closer coverage of regions of high galactic surface density , to make the spectroscopic coverage optimally uniform .",
    "excess fibers are allocated to several classes of rare or peculiar objects ( for example objects which are positionally matched with rosat sources , or those whose parameters lie outside any known range ",
    "these are _ serendipitous _ objects ) and to samples of stars .",
    "the spectra are observed , 640 at a time ( with a total integration time of 45 - 60 minutes depending on observing conditions ) using a pair of fiber - fed double spectrographs ( spectro / spectro.htm ) .",
    "the wavelength coverage of the spectrographs is continuous from about 3800  to 9200  , and the wavelength resolution , @xmath65 , is 1800 ( uomoto et al . 1999 ) .",
    "the fibers are located at the focal plane via plug plates constructed for each area of sky .",
    "the fiber diameter is 0.2 mm ( @xmath66 on the sky ) , and adjacent fibers can not be located more closely than @xmath67 on the sky .",
    "both members of a pair of objects closer than this separation can be observed spectroscopically if they are located in the overlapping regions of adjacent tiles .",
    "tests of the redshift accuracy using observations of stars in m67 whose radial velocities are accurately known ( mathieu et al . 1986 ) show that the sdss radial velocity measurements for stars have a scatter of about 3.5 @xmath68 .",
    "the operational software is described in datasys / datasys.htm .",
    "the data are obtained using the data acquisition ( da ) system at apo ( petravick et al .",
    "1994 ) and recorded on dlt tape .",
    "the imaging data consist of full images from all ccds of the imaging array , cut - outs of detected objects from the astrometric array , and bookkeeping information .",
    "these tapes are shipped to fermilab by express courier and the data are automatically reduced through an interoperating set of software pipelines operating in a common computing environment .",
    "the _ photometric pipeline _ reduces the imaging data ; it corrects the data for data defects ( interpolation over bad columns and bleed trails , finding and interpolating over ` cosmic rays ' , etc ) , calculates overscan ( bias ) , sky and flat field values , calculates the point spread functions ( psf ) as a function of time and location on the ccd array , finds objects , combines the data from the five bands , carries out simple model fits to the images of each object , deblends overlapping objects , and measures positions , magnitudes ( including psf and petrosian magnitudes ) and shape parameters .",
    "the photometric pipeline uses position calibration information from the astrometric array reduced through the _ astrometric pipeline _ and photometric calibration data from the photometric telescope ( reduced through the _ photometric telescope pipeline _ ) .",
    "final calibrations are applied by the _ final calibration pipeline _",
    ", which allows refinements in the positional and photometric calibration as the survey progresses .",
    "the photometric pipeline is extensively tested using repeat observations , examination of the outputs , observations of regions of the sky previously observed by other telescopes ( hst fields , for example ) and a set of simulations , described in detail in simul / simul.htm . for an example of the repeatability of sdss photometry over several timescales ,",
    "see ivezi et al .",
    "these repeat observations show that the mean errors ( for point sources ) are about @xmath69 to @xmath70 , increasing to about @xmath71 at @xmath72 and to @xmath73 at @xmath74 .",
    "these observed errors are in good agreement with those quoted by the photometric pipeline .",
    "they apply only to the @xmath75 and @xmath64 bands  in the less sensitive @xmath76 and @xmath22 bands , the errors at the bright end are about the same as those in @xmath59 , but increase to @xmath71 at @xmath70 and @xmath73 at @xmath72 .",
    "the outputs , together with all the observing and processing information , are loaded into the _ operational data base _ which is the central collection of scientific and bookkeeping data used to run the survey . to select the spectroscopic targets , objects are run through the _ target selection pipeline _ and flagged if they meet the spectroscopic selection criteria for a particular type of object .",
    "the criteria for the primary objects ( quasars , galaxies and brgs ) will not be changed once the survey is underway . those for serendipitous objects and samples of interesting stars can be changed throughout the survey .",
    "a given object can in principle receive several target flags .",
    "the selected objects are tiled as described above , plug plates are drilled , and the spectroscopic observations are made .",
    "the spectroscopic data are automatically reduced by the _",
    "spectroscopic pipeline _ , which extracts , corrects and calibrates the spectra , determines the spectral types , and measures the redshifts . the reduced spectra",
    "are then stored in the operational data base .",
    "the contents of the operational data base are copied at regular intervals into the _ science data base _ for retrieval and scientific analysis ( see appsoft / appsoft.htm ) . the science data base is indexed in a hierarchical manner : the data and other information are linked into ` containers ' that can be divided and subdivided as necessary , to define easily searchable regions with approximately the same data content .",
    "this hierarchical scheme is consistent with those being adopted by other large surveys , to allow cross referencing of multiple surveys .",
    "the science data base also incorporates a set of query tools and is designed for easy portability .",
    "the photometric data products of the sdss include : a _ catalog _ of all detected objects , with measured positions , magnitudes , shape parameters , model fits and processing flags ; _ atlas images _ ( i.e. cutouts from the imaging data in all five bands ) of all detected objects and of objects from the first and rosat catalogs ; a @xmath77 binned image of the corrected images with the objects removed : and a _ mask _ of the areas of sky not processed ( because of saturated stars , for example ) and of corrected pixels ( e.g. those from which cosmic rays were removed ) .",
    "the atlas images are sized to enclose the area occupied by each object plus the psf width , or the object size given in the rosat or first catalogues .",
    "the photometric outputs are described in http://www.astro.princeton.edu/sdss/photo.html .",
    "the data base will also contain the calibrated 1d _ spectra _ , the derived _ redshift _ and _ spectral type _ , and the bookkeeping information related to the spectroscopic observations .",
    "in addition , the positions of astrometric calibration stars measured by the astrometric pipeline and the magnitudes of the faint photometric standards measured by the photometric telescope pipeline will be published at regular intervals .",
    "the goal of the sdss is to provide the data necessary for studies of the large scale structure of the universe on a wide range of scales .",
    "the imaging survey should detect @xmath78 galaxies , @xmath79 quasars and @xmath80 stars to the survey limits .",
    "these photometric data , via photometric redshifts and various statistical techniques such as the angular correlation function , support studies of large scale structure well past the limit of the spectroscopic survey . on even larger scales , information on structure will come from quasars .",
    "the science justification for the sdss is discussed in several conference papers ( e.g. gunn & weinberg 1995 ; fukugita 1998 ; margon 1999 ) .",
    "the project book science sections can be accessed at http://www.astro.princeton.edu/pbook/science/science.htm .",
    "much of the science for which the sdss was built , the study of large scale structure , will come when the survey is complete , but the initial test data have already led to significant scientific discoveries in many fields . in this section ,",
    "we show examples of the first test data and some initial results . to date",
