    "as a prototype of magnetic molecular solids , consider the one generally known as 8 .",
    "this material consists of molecules of [ fe@xmath0o@xmath1(oh)@xmath2(tacn)@xmath3br@xmath0(h@xmath1o)@xmath4 , in which the fe(iii ) ions of one molecule are well separated from those of a neighboring molecule . at low temperatures , each molecule has a spin @xmath5 , a corresponding all - spin magnetic moment of @xmath6 with @xmath7 , and an ising - like anisotropy which translates into an energy barrier of @xmath8k  @xcite .",
    "consider next the experiment of wernsdorfer and sessoli  @xcite , of which a partial and simplified description is as follows . at low temperatures",
    "( @xmath9mk ) they first saturate the magnetization of the sample by applying an external magnetic field @xmath10 along the ising or @xmath11 axis , and also apply a magnetic field @xmath12 along the hard magnetic axis transverse to the easy axis .",
    "they then sweep @xmath10 so as to reverse the magnetization , and measure the rate at which the spins reverse .",
    "astonishingly , this rate turns out to be an oscillatory function of @xmath12 , even though the energy barrier and the angle between the two energy minimizing orientations of the spin are both monotonically decreasing functions of @xmath12 .",
    "the interpretation of this phenomneon is that the sweeping of @xmath10 is inducing landau - zener - stckelberg ( lzs ) transitions  @xcite between the two lowest states on opposite sides of the energy barrier , which take place at a rate proportional to @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the tunnel splitting between these states .",
    "the rate oscillates because @xmath15 oscillates with @xmath12 , in accord with theory  @xcite .",
    "8 is just one of @xmath16 magnetic molecular solids that are now known , and which have been the object of much study over the last fifteen years or so .",
    "their main characteristics are that the spin of one molecule is large at low temperatures , and to a good first approximation , one may treat the spins on different molecules as non - interacting .",
    "( a comprehensive and authoritative review of the entire field is contained in ref .",
    "shorter reviews may be found in refs .",
    "these solids are often known as single - molecule - magnets ( smm s ) , because many phenomena may be understood , at least qualitatively , in terms of the properties of the total ground state spin of a single molecule in a suitable crystal field , via an effective spin hamiltonian that contains anisotropy terms reflecting the overall symmetry of the molecule and its local environment .",
    "the oscillatory tunnel splitting mentioned above is one such phenomenon .",
    "another is that the hysteresis loops are sharply stepped , where the steps coincide with crossings of energy levels on opposite sides of the energy barrier  @xcite .",
    "this single molecule behavior has , unsurprisingly , led to suggestions and proposals for using these materials in devices  @xcite , but they are a new class of magnetic materials and worthy of study in their own right for the novel phenomena they display .    among the various experimental tools employed to study the low temperature magnetization dynamics of such solids , the swept - field or landau - zener - stckelberg ( lzs ) protocol has proven to be one of the most fruitful . when the sweep is sufficiently rapid , the accompanying change in the magnetization can be interpreted in terms of lzs transitions as already mentioned , and thereby provides a measurement of the tunneling amplitude between energy levels on opposite sides of a barrier .",
    "tunnel splittings measured by this technique are as low as @xmath17k in temperature units .",
    "such low splittings are beyond the reach of any other method . when the sweep rate is slow , on the other hand , the interpretation is not clear - cut .",
    "it is essential to consider the dipole - dipole interactions between different molecules , and the transition is influenced by the collective dynamics of all the spins .",
    "indeed , in this case , the smm designation falls short , and a more detailed analysis is called for .",
    "collective , dipole - coupled dynamics of the spins are also seen in several magnetization - relaxation type experiments  @xcite .",
    "theoretical discussions and monte - carlo simulations of these experiments have been provided by  @xcite , and many aspects of the experiments are understood . the same is not true of the swept - field experiments , and we are unaware of any work that addresses the collective dynamics aspects .",
    "theories that include the dipole - dipole interactions in a purely static  @xcite or mean - fieldy  @xcite way can not explain all the experimental behavior , especially that at low sweep fields .",
    "it is important to have a more complete theory since experimentalists often interpret data in terms of the original lzs analysis  @xcite . in light of the fact that the spins in molecular magnets are subject to strong environmental influences , especially the dipolar couplings to other molecular spins , and that the lzs theory is based on fully quantum mechanically coherent time evolution",
    ", it is not at all clear that the lzs description is at all correct a priori . indeed , as explained in ref .",
    "@xcite , it is a fortunate fact that it can be used even at high sweep velocities .",
    "wernsdorfer has argued  @xcite , correctly in our view , that the lzs formula should not be used without first verifying that one is in the fast sweep limit , and that it can in general only yield a lower bound on the tunnel splitting . while the use of this formula may give one qualitative proof of the presence of a geometrical phase in the tunneling spectrum  @xcite , one is on shaky ground if one uses the extracted tunnel splittings to build detailed models of intramolecular magnetic interactions .",
    "it is clear that a recent debate about these matters  @xcite is caused by an incomplete understanding of how molecular magnets respond to a swept magnetic field .",
    "it is the purpose of this paper to provide a more complete analysis of the swept - field protocol including the collective behavior of all the spins .",
    "we study the coupled system of molecular spins by both monte - carlo simulations and by developing and solving a kinetic equation for the joint probability distribution of the spin ( up or down ) of a molecule and the local magnetic field seen by that spin .",
    "we compare the results of these two approaches with each other , and with experiments .",
    "we find that the monte carlo simulation agrees with the experimental results over almost the entire range of sweep velocities , giving us confidence that the physical picture underlying the simulations is correct .",
    "the kinetic equation agrees with the simulations up to moderately low sweep velocities , but fails at still slower velocities , although the failure is not as severe as for previous theoretical treatments  @xcite . in all cases , we find that a model due to kayanuma  @xcite of a spin strongly coupled to a bath does a better job of explaining the physics than the lzs model , but it is never superior to the kinetic equations or the monte carlo simulations .",
    "the main advantage of the kayanuma model is that it yields a simple formula for the magnetization reversal in terms of the tunneling matrix element , whereas we are unable to write a similar formula for the results of out kinetic equation or monte carlo simulations .",
    "we note here that a kinetic equation was written down in @xcite , but this equation is formal in that the collision or interaction term between pairs of spins is written in terms of the two - site distribution of spin and local magnetic field .",
    "it is thus like the first of the equations of the bbgky hierarchy , which are exact , but which can not be solved without truncating the hierachy .",
    "the simplest truncation is at the level of the single - site distribution itself , and amounts to assuming that the two - site distribution factorizes .",
    "however , rather than obtain the kinetic equation in this formal way , we derive the equation by considering the various interaction processes which cause this distribution to change .",
    "this approach gives greater physical insight into the approximations made .",
    "the single - site approximation breaks down at ultra slow sweeps as we explain , leading to the divergence from the simulations mentioned above .",
    "including two - site correlations would lead to an immensely more complex numerical problem , however , and experience with other problems suggests that if two - site correlations are indeed important , then we are faced with a humdinger , as three - site , four - site , and higher - order multi - site correlations are also likely to be important .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in",
    ", we provide background information on 8 , the lzs and kayanuma models , and on a theoretical model for smm s that incorporates the influence of the environment  @xcite .",
    "we also describe how this model differs from our earlier rate equation approach  @xcite . in",
    ", we discuss our monte carlo protocol , and the results of our simulations .",
    "the kinetic equation is discussed in .",
    "we first derive this equation , and then discuss how various partial sums of the collision term in this equation may be physically interpreted .",
    "we also discuss how we integrate this equation numerically , and the results of this integration .",
    "we summarize our conclusions briefly in .",
    "let us first assume ( counterfactually ) that the interactions between different molecular spins may be ignored .",
    "the dynamics of the spin of a single molecule would then be governed by an anisotropy hamiltonian of the form = -k_2 s_z^2 + _ - g_b , where @xmath18 is the total spin of the molecule , the first term in @xmath19 is the leading anisotropy , @xmath20 is a _",
    "g_-factor , @xmath21 is the bohr magneton , @xmath22 is the external magnetic field , and @xmath23 is a term in the transverse spin components that is off - diagonal in the @xmath24 basis and reflects the intrinsic higher - order anisotropies of the molecule . for this reason it is time - reversal invariant , and",
    "so contains only even powers of the spin components . in 8 , for example , _",
    "= ( k_1 - k_2 ) s_x^2 - c(s_+^4 + s_-^4 ) .",
    "[ hperp_fe8 ] the various parameters in @xmath19 are well known for the most highly studied molecules . for 8 ,",
    "@xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27k , @xmath28k , and @xmath29k .",
    "in 12 , by contrast , the anisotropy is tetragonal based on the symmetry of the molecule , but there are believed to be biaxial terms of the same type as in arising from chemical disorder , variable waters of crystallization , variant chemical species , etc . , and there are also additional longitudinal terms such as @xmath30 .",
    "these details are largely immaterial for this paper , since we are interested in ultra - low temperatures only .",
    "we may therefore focus on the lowest two energy levels , @xmath31 , and presuppose that there is an amplitude per unit time , @xmath32 , to tunnel between these levels .",
    "we also assume that the effects of the transverse fields @xmath12 and @xmath33 have been incorporated in @xmath14 , and only the longitudinal field , @xmath10 , is not .",
    "it is this field that is swept .    under these conditions ,",
    "each molecular spin may be described as a two - level system governed by an effective single - spin hamiltonian , _ eff =    \\(t ) & + & -(t ) +    , [ ham2by2 ] where @xmath34 is the energy of the @xmath35 state relative to that of the @xmath36 state , given by ( t ) = 2sg _ b h_z(t ) .",
    "[ eps_vs_h ] we shall refer to @xmath37 as the _ bias _ on the spin  @xcite . in writing , we have defined the zero of @xmath10 so that the levels @xmath38 are degenerate at @xmath39 . in the laboratory , a nonzero offset field",
    "may be required to cancel demagnetizing fields and bring this degeneracy about ; @xmath10 is supposed measured from this offset .",
    "we will interchangeably refer to the two states either as @xmath31 states , or as pseudospin-1/2 states @xmath40 and @xmath41 states , or as  up \" and  down \" states .",
    "we now suppose that the longitudinal field is swept at a steady rate so that ( t ) = t , and the spin is in the lower energy state , @xmath42 as @xmath43 .",
    "then , the probability that spin will flip into the @xmath44 state as @xmath45 is given by the classic lzs formula p_lzs = 1 - ( -^2/2 || ) . the limits of fast sweep , @xmath46 , and slow sweep , @xmath47 , are worth noting : p_lzs    , & ^2 , 1 , & ^2 .",
    "as mentioned in , the lzs model is inadequate to describe the actual experiments .",
    "an alternative single - spin model is that of kayanuma  @xcite wherein the bias field @xmath34 has added to it a fluctuating part @xmath48 , which is taken as a gaussian random process . in the limit where this process has very large amplitude and is delta - function correlated , corresponding to a very rapidly fluctuating bias",
    ", the probability that the spin will end up in the state @xmath44 having started in @xmath42 is found to be p_k = ( 1 - ( -^2/ || ) ) .",
    "[ p_kaya ] the fast and low sweep limits of the reversal probability are now given by p_k    , & ^2 , , & ^2 .",
    "this is identical to the lzs formula for fast sweeps , but very different for slow ones .",
    "whereas the lzs process describes coherent adiabatic reversal of the spin , the kayanuma process describes a spin which is able to make many transitions between the up and down states and is therefore completely randomized at @xmath49 .",
    "we may think of the fluctuating field @xmath48 as a qualitative way of describing the dipolar field of other spins , which are also undergoing transitions between up and down states .",
    "it was shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that we also obtain kayanuma s answer ( [ p_kaya ] ) if we assume that the external field is swept uniformly , and each spin flips between the up and down states independently of the others but with a bias - dependent rate .",
    "that is , if the probability for a spin to be in the up state is denoted @xmath50 , we take _",
    "= ( 1 - 2p _ ) .",
    "[ rate_ind_eps ] follows if ( ) d= ^2 , [ int_gam ] and @xmath51 .",
    "since this requirement on @xmath52 entails only the tunneling amplitude @xmath14 , the details of the physical decoherence mechanism that justifies writing down a rate equation in the first place are irrelevant . in ref .",
    "@xcite , these mechanisms involved the environments of nuclear spins and other molecular spins . the bias - dependent flip rate that we employ in this paper [ see ] is a special case of that in @xcite , and satisfies .",
    "the kayanuma model is attractive because it is simple and economical .",
    "it is a much better model for the reversal than the lzs process .",
    "it is plausible that for a large collection of molecular spins where each one may flip at different times in the sweep cycle because the offset field is not the same for all spins , the field seen by any one spin has a stochastic character .",
    "however , it is clearly an approximation to assume that the time - dependence of the bias on any one spin is uncorrelated with the configuration of the other spins . as shown in @xcite",
    ", it is not even enough to take account of the spin configuration in a mean - fieldy way through the spatially averaged demagnetization field .",
    "therefore , we must consider the interaction between the spins explicitly .",
    "in reality , the spins are neither isolated nor noninteracting as noted before . as discussed in @xcite",
    ", there are two types of interactions to consider .",
    "first , each molecular spin is coupled to nuclear spins in its vicinity .",
    "these spins have the effect that the tunneling between the @xmath31 states becomes fully incoherent for typical molecular magnets . the @xmath53 probability for the @xmath54th spin is given by p_flip , i = _ i dt , where _ i",
    "( _ i ) = 4 ^2 w ( -_i^22w^2 ) .",
    "[ gamma1 ] here , @xmath55 with @xmath56 being the dipole - dipole interaction energy between the molecular spin and the nearby nuclear spins , and @xmath57 is the bias on site @xmath54  @xcite . for 8 ,",
    "@xmath58  mk , and @xmath59  k in temperature units ( see below ) .",
    "second , each molecular spin is coupled to all the other molecular spins via the dipole interaction . at first sight , this leads to a fully many - body quantum mechanical problem .",
    "since the nuclear spins already render each molecular spin slow and incoherent , however , the field of one molecular spin on another may be taken as a c - number and quantum mechanical back action may be ignored .",
    "let us define an ising spin variable @xmath60 on every site @xmath54 , such that @xmath61 corresponds to @xmath62 .",
    "the dipolar part of @xmath57 is then given by _",
    "i , dip & = & _ ji k_ij _ j , [ ebias ] + k_ij & = & 2 e_dm a^3 r^3_ij ( 1 - 3z^2_ij r^2_ij ) .",
    "[ kij ] here , @xmath63 is the interaction energy scale between neighboring molecular spins , and @xmath64 is their separation .",
    "further , @xmath65 is the distance between spins @xmath54 and @xmath66 , and @xmath67 is the difference between their _",
    "z_-axis coordinates .",
    "we estimate the dipolar field in 8 as @xmath68  oe , which implies the energy scale @xmath69  k quoted above .",
    "the net result of these two couplings is as follows .",
    "the ratio @xmath70 is large for most molecules most of the time , so these spins are essentially frozen .",
    "a spin is unfrozen only when the field it sees is essentially zero ( more precisely of order @xmath71 or less ) .",
    "we refer to this range of bias values as the _ reversibility region_. in magnetization relaxation experiments , the combination of a static and narrow reversibility region leads to very slow and non - exponential time decay , which many workers have investigated theoretically  @xcite . if the external field is swept , however , the odds of a spin being able to flip are greatly increased .",
    "particularly if the sweep rate is low , the complete dynamics can be very rich and complex , as we now discuss .",
    "let us focus on one spin as the bias is being increased .",
    "since the dipole energy is so large compared to all other energies in the problem , the flip of even a far away spin can change the bias on the first or central spin from a big negative value ( relative to @xmath71 ) to a big positive one .",
    "the central spin is then shunted past the @xmath72 region and does not flip .",
    "this gives a qualitative explanation of why the net magnetization reversal can be less than that in kayanuma s model .",
    "however , the central spin can be returned to the region of negative bias if another spin not too far away were to flip subsequently .",
    "thus , the actual amount of spin reversal is hard to calculate , especially analytically .",
    "we therefore turn to monte carlo simulations of the lzs protocol .",
    "the physical problem we have described in is characterized by four parameters : the molecular spin dipole - dipole energy @xmath63 , the reversible region width @xmath71 , the external bias sweep rate @xmath73 , and the tunnel splitting @xmath14 . for purposes of analysis and monte carlo simulation ,",
    "however , these parameters can be reduced to just two dimensionless variables : the scaled reversible region width @xmath74 and the scaled sweep rate @xmath75 , given as w & = & , + v & = & .",
    "all bias energies are measured in units of @xmath63 .",
    "we use the symbol @xmath76 ( note the slightly different font ) for the dimensionless biases , both applied and dipolar .",
    "it is not always optimal to frame the discussion in terms of dimensionless variables , and we shall back and forth between dimensionless and dimensionful descriptions as needed .",
    "our monte carlo simulation models a finite system of @xmath77 spins , labeled @xmath60 , that can be in either the up or the down state ( @xmath78 ) .",
    "the bias @xmath57 at site @xmath54 is the sum of the externally applied bias field @xmath79 and the dipole field @xmath80 : _",
    "i(t ) = _ a(t ) + _ i , dip(t ) .",
    "we have explicitly shown that the dipole field is time dependent since the spin state of the system is time dependent .",
    "the spins are taken to lie on a cubic lattice with lattice constant @xmath64 , and the sample is taken to be spherical so that the initial bias distribution is approximately a delta function centered at the value @xmath81 . for the majority of the simulations , the number of spins , @xmath77 , is chosen to be 7,153 , corresponding to 25 spins on the sphere s diameter , and @xmath79 is taken to vary linearly in time , _",
    "a(t ) = _ a t. though the number @xmath77 is significantly less than that used for previous simulations of relaxation  @xcite , we found that the results converged even for @xmath82 ( diameter @xmath83 spins ) . in simulations of relaxation ,",
    "large values of @xmath77 were necessary to ensure that the reversible region was never depleted entirely . in simulations of lzs sweeps ,",
    "the reversible region moves across the bias distribution , so depletion is a much lesser concern .    in each monte carlo timestep ( which we arbitrarily denote by @xmath84 ) , the spin flip probabilities are calculated for every spin in the system from the rate function @xmath52 . to save on computation time",
    ", for most of our simulations , we used a simplification of that is only nonzero for @xmath85 :  ( ) = ( w-|| ) .",
    "[ gamma2 ] ( the constant multiplying @xmath86 is chosen so that the integrals of @xmath52 and @xmath87 over all @xmath37 are identical , and holds with @xmath88 . ) in practice , this rate function gives very nearly the same results as and allows a simpler view of the spin flip process : the only spins that are able to flip are those strictly within the reversible region , a window of width @xmath89 around zero .",
    "after the spins have flipped , the change in bias at every lattice site is calculated and the simulation moves to the next timestep .",
    "over the course of one run of the simulation , the external bias is swept from @xmath90 to @xmath91 . if @xmath92 is the change in the bias in one time step , the probability for a spin in the reversible region to flip in that timestep is p_flip & = & dt + & = & + & = & d_a .",
    "naturally , care must be taken to ensure that @xmath93 . in practice",
    ", we required that it did not exceed @xmath94 .",
    "we also want to ensure that we do not skip past the reversible region in just one time step , so @xmath95 is also chosen not to exceed @xmath96 .",
    "this becomes computationally intensive for slow sweeps , and for @xmath97 , for example , we are only able to study values of @xmath74 exceeding @xmath98 .",
    "the quantities that we record during the simulation are the magnetization per site , m = _ i _ i , and the bias field distributions , @xmath99 , defined so that @xmath100 is the fraction of sites with spin @xmath101 or @xmath102 and a bias field in the range @xmath37 to @xmath103 .",
    "we are especially interested in the final magnetization , @xmath104 .",
    "we have already touched on the feasibility of performing the simulations with spheres of as few as 15 spins on the diameter .",
    "however , to test the stability of the answers with system size , we have performed some simulations with as many as 55 spins on the diameter .",

    "readers will note that irrespective of @xmath75 , the major change in @xmath110 starts when @xmath115 reaches a value close to zero , and there is little change once @xmath115 exceeds @xmath116 .",
    "readers will also note that there appears to be a small drop in @xmath110 before the main one .",
    "the reason is that in the initial state , when all the spins are up , the bias field is zero at almost every site .",
    "however , there are always some spins with nonzero bias on the surface of the sample , though their fraction becomes smaller as @xmath77 increases .",
    "thus the initial bias distribution is not quite a delta function centered at zero bias , and the surface spins start to flip before the external bias reaches @xmath117 , and this is responsible for the small dip .     as a function of the scaled sweep rate @xmath75 for various values of @xmath74 .",

    "this is true even when the agreement with the kayanuma model is poor .",

    "the widths of the gaussians were assumed to be equal , and this common width and the heights of the three gaussian were determined by matching the first three moments of @xmath143 with a model in which every spin was up or down with probabilities @xmath144 independently of the others .",
    "the distribution determined in this way depends only on the system s magnetization , and leads to a closed system of rate equations .",

    "it is paramount to have a good approximation for the bias distribution near the reversible region to properly capture the probability of spin flips . for the relaxation problem ,",
    "the reversible region is static and centered at zero bias , whereas in the case of swept field , the reversible region moves over the full range of the bias distribution . as a result , a larger number of spins are capable of flipping , and the bias distribution is altered over essentially it entire range .",

    "similarly , the bias at the 5 other neighboring sites will also change and these spins will also be removed from the reversible region . as the sample continues to relax , the bias for the central spin will not have a large probability to change significantly because of the fact that 5 of its nearest neighbors are displaced far from the reversible region .",
    "the sixth spin , the one that originally flipped , is still sitting in its original near - zero bias , and therefore has a higher probability to flip back , but this would cause the bias for the central spin to move back closer to the origin .",

    "this explains why the bias distribution in the monte carlo simulation is more bounded and peaked .",
