    "fractional exclusion statistics was introduced  @xcite as a generalization of the pauli exclusion statistics .",
    "the particles obeying such statistics are elementary excitations that can only exist in the interior of the whole system of interacting particles .",
    "it has also been shown that the excitations in exactly soluble many - body problems in one dimension , e.g. the colagero - sutherland model  @xcite , the quasi - particles in the luttinger model  @xcite and the @xmath4 function gas  @xcite , obey this statistics .",
    "excitations in the haldane - shastry spin model follow fes also  @xcite .",
    "in fact , it has rigorously been proved that quasi - particles with non - trivial exclusion statistics exist in a class of models that are solved by the bethe ansatz  @xcite .",
    "applications to other condensed matter systems have also been considered  @xcite .",
    "it has been shown  @xcite that a quantum liquid of particles interacting via a long - range two - body potential , where the particles are supposed to be either bosons or fermions , exhibits the nature of a quantum liquid with fes .",
    "the expectation that fes in arbitrary dimensions continuously interpolates between fermi and bose liquids holds only for one - dimensional systems .",
    "recently  @xcite , it has been shown that fes is a consequence of the interactions between the particles of the system and is due to the change from the description in terms of free - particle energies to the description in terms of quasiparticle energies .",
    "on the other hand , several models in which two - level systems are occupied by bosons have been useful to understand different quantum many - body systems and can be treated numerically by direct diagonalization .",
    "these models have as a common feature that the lower level has a scalar boson , but differ according to the multipolarity @xmath5 of the second level .",
    "for example , the lipkin - meshkov - glick model  @xcite in the schwinger representation has a scalar @xmath6 boson in the upper level , as is the case in the two - mode bose - hubbard model for bose - einstein condensates confined in two - well potentials  @xcite .",
    "a dipolar ( @xmath7 ) boson leads to the vibron model of quantum chemistry and a quadrupole ( @xmath8 ) boson corresponds to the interacting boson model  @xcite .",
    "here we shall study a rather simple , yet general , two - level system with @xmath1 spin - less bosons interacting through a @xmath0body random potential ; this is called the @xmath0body gaussian embedded ensemble for bosons  @xcite .",
    "more specifically , we deal with the cases @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "the former case corresponds to the most common physical situation with two - body interactions .",
    "the latter corresponds to the canonical ensembles of random matrix theory ( rmt )  @xcite , which is important in its own since rmt predicts accurately the universal statistical properties of the fluctuations of the spectra of a large variety of complicated physical systems  @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we use the @xmath0body boson random ensemble to calculate the integrated level density and show that , in all cases , beta - like rank distributions are obtained .",
    "such beta - like distributions have been observed to hold in other complex systems in biology , social sciences and arts  @xcite .",
    "we also obtain here this distribution using quasiparticles that obey fes .",
    "this implies a generalization of two - level systems , since the second level must have a degeneration which is no longer an integer number , as can occur with haldane particles  @xcite as well as with regge poles  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath0body gaussian embedded ensemble for bosons is defined as follows  @xcite .",
    "we denote by @xmath0 the rank of the interaction and by @xmath1 the number of spin - less ( scalar ) bosons so @xmath11 .",
    "the @xmath1 bosons are distributed in two single - particle levels ; for simplicity , we assume that these levels are degenerate .",
    "we introduced the boson creation and annihilation operators @xmath12 and @xmath13 ( @xmath14 ) , which satisfy the usual commutation relations for bosons .",
    "the normalized @xmath1-boson states are denoted by @xmath15 , where @xmath16^{1/2}$ ] is a normalization constant and @xmath17 is the vacuum state . clearly , the dimension of the hilbert space is @xmath18 ( see eq .",

    "( [ dgbd ] ) computed for each realization of the interacting two - level bosons ensemble for @xmath9 and @xmath23 .",

    "the frequency distributions of @xmath24 , @xmath22 , and @xmath25 are given in figures ( b ) , ( c ) , and ( d ) , respectively . , title=\"fig:\",width=321 ]    stochasticity is built into the hamiltonian @xmath20 at the level of the @xmath0body matrix elements @xmath26 .",
    "these matrix elements are assumed to be gaussian distributed independent random variables , with zero mean and constant variance @xmath27 . as in the case of rmt  @xcite",
    ", dyson s parameter @xmath28 distinguishes the ensembles according to its symmetry properties : @xmath29 corresponds to the case where time  reversal symmetry holds , and @xmath30 holds when time ",
    "reversal invariance is broken .",
    "the @xmath0body interaction matrix @xmath31 is thus a member of the gaussian orthogonal ensemble ( goe ) for @xmath29 or of the gaussian unitary ensemble ( gue ) for @xmath30  @xcite .     for @xmath10.,title=\"fig:\",width=321 ]   for @xmath10.,title=\"fig:\",width=321 ]   for @xmath10.,title=\"fig:\",width=321 ]   for @xmath10.,title=\"fig:\",width=321 ]    we note that the number of independent matrix elements of the @xmath0body matrix is equal to @xmath32 .",
    "therefore , for @xmath33 , which is physically the relevant case , the matrix elements of @xmath20 are correlated , i.e. , the number of independent random variables is much smaller than the number of independent matrix elements .",
    "in addition the matrix is sparse since many matrix elements are identically zero .",
    "the combinatorial factors @xmath34 and @xmath35 are introduced in the definition of the ensemble eq .",
    "( [ hkbosons ] ) in order to have for @xmath10 perfect identification , i.e. , a one - to - one correspondence , with the canonical ensembles of rmt  @xcite .",
    "the numerical results presented below are related to the integrated level density , also referred to as the staircase function , of individual realizations of the ensemble  ( [ hkbosons ] ) .",
    "we take into account a large number of such realizations to achieve small statistical errors . for each member of the ensemble",
    "we construct the staircase function directly from the diagonalization of the hamiltonian .",
    "the staircase function is defined as @xmath36 , where @xmath37 are the many - body eigenvalues of the specific realization of the hamiltonian ; @xmath38 is the heaviside step function . by definition ,",
    "the staircase function is a monotonic non - decreasing function of the energy . for later convenience we shall use the rank function @xmath39 .",
    "we invert it numerically and express the energy @xmath40 in terms of the rank @xmath41 ; the function @xmath42 is therefore a monotonic decreasing function of the rank @xmath41 .",
    "for each member of the ensemble , the rank distribution @xmath42 is fitted with the two - parameter distribution  @xcite:@xmath43 here , @xmath44 is the normalization constant of the distribution , @xmath45 is the maximum value attained by the rank @xmath41 , and the constants @xmath24 and @xmath22 are two fitting exponents .",
    "we refer to @xmath46 as the discrete generalized beta distribution ( dgbd ) .",
    "we present now numerical results on the fitting exponents @xmath24 and @xmath22 of eq .",
    "these were obtained by considering @xmath47 members of the @xmath0-body gaussian embedded ensemble for two - level bosons , where we fixed @xmath23 bosons and @xmath29 ; similar results were obtained for @xmath30 .",
    "the best fit was determined by a log - log multiple linear regression ; the quality of the fit is measured by the square correlation coefficient @xmath25 , which must be close to @xmath48 for a reliable fit .",
    "we focus on the cases @xmath9 and @xmath10 since these are physically the most relevant . in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] we present a scatter plot of the fitting parameters obtained for each individual member of the ensemble for @xmath9 and the frequency distributions of @xmath24 , @xmath22 , and @xmath25 ; fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] displays the corresponding results for @xmath10 .",
    "interestingly , these figures show that the distributions for @xmath24 and @xmath22 are much broader for @xmath9 than for @xmath10 ; the results on @xmath25 simply give confidence to the fitting procedure .",
    "from the numerical results , we compute the average values of the fitting parameters . for @xmath9",
    "we have @xmath49 and @xmath50 , where the assigned error corresponds to the standard deviation of the sample .",
    "likewise , for @xmath10 we obtain @xmath51 and @xmath52 . in both cases , @xmath53 is slightly negative and very close to zero , and @xmath54 .",
    "we shall show in section  [ rankdists ] that the fact that @xmath55 and @xmath56 indicates that interactions mimic fes , i.e. , interacting particles are equivalent to non - interacting haldane quasi - particles with respect to the rank distribution .",
    "the combinatorial formula for the number of many  body states @xmath57 of @xmath1 identical particles following fes and occupying a group of @xmath58 states is given by ( cf .",

    "note that @xmath65 could be formally negative .",
    "this gives the possibility of an interesting connection with the famous regge trajectories used in high - energy physics  @xcite .    in order to compare the rank distribution of @xmath1 particles obeying fes with those obtained in section  [ bosons ] for bosons , we shall group the @xmath65 single - particle levels filled by @xmath1 haldane particles into two levels with energies @xmath66 and @xmath67 , with @xmath68 .",
    "if @xmath69 , the number of ( non - interacting haldane particles ) microstates with energy @xmath70 is given by@xmath71 the rank distribution with respect to the energy is then @xmath72 which for @xmath73 yields @xmath74 taking the continuum limit of @xmath40 and using stirling formula , we obtain @xmath75    for particles obeying fes the effective number of states @xmath76 can be positive or negative , as we have remarked in connection with eq .",
