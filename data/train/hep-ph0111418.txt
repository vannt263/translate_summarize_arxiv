    "the solar neutrino problem  @xcite has been defined , for example , as the difference between the neutrino flux measured by a variety of solar neutrino experiments and the predictions of the standard solar model ( ssm ) .",
    "the explanation of this difference by the neutrino oscillation hypothesis has been boosted by the @xmath0 demonstration at the @xmath17 level of the appearance at the earth of sun - directed muon and tau neutrino beams  @xcite and the first determination of the total neutrino flux generated by the sun  @xcite .",
    "the agreement of this flux with the expectations implies as a by - product the confirmation of the validity of the ssm  @xcite .    at present",
    "the @xmath0 experiment measures the solar neutrinos via the reactions  @xcite : 1 ) charged current ( @xmath18 ) : @xmath19 , 2 ) elastic scattering ( @xmath20 ) : @xmath21 .",
    "the first reaction is sensitive exclusively to electron neutrinos .",
    "the second , the same as the one used in superkamiokande ( @xmath22 ) , is instead sensitive , with different efficiencies , to all flavors .",
    "the first results by @xmath0 on solar neutrinos ( 1169 neutrino events collected during the first 240 days of data , ref.@xcite ) confirm previous evidence from @xmath22 and other experiments  @xcite . the solar neutrino flux measured via the observed cc reaction rate , @xmath23 @xmath24 @xmath25 , is lower than the two existing es reaction rate measurements : the more precise at @xmath22 @xmath26 @xmath24 @xmath25 and the one measured by @xmath0 itself @xmath27 @xmath24 @xmath25 .",
    "comparison of the @xmath28 and @xmath29 and especially @xmath28 and @xmath30 can be considered as the first direct evidence for solar neutrino oscillations which cause the appearance of sun - directed muon and tau neutrinos at the earth . when considering only @xmath0 results , it is advantageous to use the experimental ratio of cc to es measurements because of the cancellation of systematic errors .",
    "the experimental value is @xmath31 which is 2@xmath32 away from the no - oscillation expectation @xmath33 .",
    "recall that the statistical significance of the difference @xmath34 is clearly lower ( @xmath35 )  @xcite .",
    "if we use the @xmath20-@xmath22 result , the no - oscillation hypothesis is excluded at @xmath36  @xcite .",
    "moreover the allowed oscillations to _ only _ sterile neutrinos is excluded at the same level ( @xmath37 ) . although less favored , the oscillations to both active and sterile neutrinos are still allowed  @xcite .",
    "although of qualitative importance , the @xmath0 results by themselves , due to their large error bars , are still far from constraining the neutrino oscillation parameters in a significant way . for this purpose",
    "we continue to need the data of all other solar neutrino experiments  @xcite .",
    "the aim of this work is to present an up - to - date analysis of all available solar neutrino evidence including the latest data in a two - neutrino framework .",
    "the predictions for day and night signal rates in the near future real - time @xmath38be sensitive borexino experiment  @xcite are also calculated .",
    "two important characteristics of this paper are the use a thorough numerical computation of the neutrino oscillation probabilities and the use of an improved statistical @xmath1 analysis .",
    "the latter is explained in detail in the next section . in summary",
    "we have followed the @xmath22 standard procedure as close as possible allowing for a better treatment of correlated uncertainties .    as we show below",
    ", the best fit to the full data set including global rates and @xmath22 energy spectrum is obtained in the _ large mixing angle _ ( lma ) region . although less favored , solutions in the _ low mass _ ( low ) and _ vacuum _ ( vac ) regions are possible with a reasonable statistical significance . a best fit solution in",
    "the _ small mixing angle _ ( sma ) region is strongly disfavored .",
    "this work is organized as follows . in section  * [ sec : methods ] * we present a summary of the methods that are used : details of the computation of neutrino oscillation probabilities in the sun and in the earth , scattering cross sections and calculation of the signal at the detectors .",
    "we continue with a detailed account of the @xmath1 statistical methods . in section  * [ sec",
    ": results ] * we present the results of different analyses : first considering total event rates only and then including the @xmath22 energy spectrum information . in section  * [ sec : borexino ] * we present our borexino predictions for the best fit solutions obtained in the previous sections . finally in section  * [ sec : conclusions ] * we summarize and draw conclusions .",
    "in general , our determination of neutrino oscillations in solar and earth matter and of the expected signal in each experiment follows the standard methods found in the literature  @xcite .",
    "nonetheless , this work differs from previous ones in the treatment of the computation of the neutrino transition probabilities .",
    "we completely solve numerically the neutrino equations of evolution for all the oscillation parameter space .",
    "although other alternatives , as the use of semi - analytical expressions in portions of the @xmath39 plane , could be previously justified in terms of economy of resources , at this stage a full simulation is an affordable and better option .",
    "this is specially true in the calculation of the smearing of the neutrino probability as a function of the neutrino production point when introducing non radial propagation .",
    "however no suprises are found : our numerical results are in overall good agreement with the semi - analytical approach .",
    "the survival probabilities for an electron neutrino , produced in the sun , to arrive at the earth are calculated in three steps .",
    "the propagation from the production point to sun s surface is computed numerically in all the parameter range using the electron number density @xmath40 given by the bpb2001 model  @xcite averaging over the production point .",
    "the propagation in vacuum from the sun surface to the earth is computed analytically .",
    "the averaging over the annual variation of the orbit is also exactly performed using simple bessel functions . to take the earth matter effects into account",
    ", we adopt a spherical model of the earth density and chemical composition . in this model , the earth is divided in eleven radial density zones  @xcite , in each of which a polynomial interpolation is used to obtain the electron density .",
    "the glueing of the neutrino propagation in the three different regions is performed exactly using an evolution operator formalism  @xcite .",
    "the final survival probabilities are obtained from the corresponding ( non - pure ) density matrices built from the evolution operators in each of these three regions .",
    "the night quantities are obtained using appropriate weights which depend on the neutrino impact parameter and the sagitta distance from neutrino trajectory to the earth center , for each detector s geographical location .",
    "the expected signal in each detector is obtained by convoluting neutrino fluxes , oscillation probabilities , neutrino cross sections and detector energy response functions .",
    "we have used neutrino - electron elastic cross sections which include radiative corrections  @xcite .",
    "neutrino cross sections on deuterium needed for the computation of the measurements are taken from  @xcite .",
    "detector effects are summarized by the respective response functions , obtained by taking into account both the energy resolution and the detector efficiency .",
    "the resolution function for is that given in  @xcite .",
    "we obtained the energy resolution function for @xmath22 using the data presented in  @xcite .",
    "the effective threshold efficiencies , which take into account the live time for each experimental period , are incorporated into our simulation program .",
    "they are obtained from  @xcite .",
    "the statistical significance of the neutrino oscillation hypothesis is tested with a standard @xmath1 method which we explain in some detail here .    in the most simple case , the analysis of global rates presented in section  * [ globalsection ] * ,",
    "the definition of the @xmath1 function is the following : @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the full covariance matrix made up of two terms , @xmath43 .",
    "the diagonal matrix @xmath44 contains the theoretical , statistical and uncorrelated errors while @xmath45 contains the correlated systematic uncertainties .",
    "the @xmath46 are vectors containing the theoretical and experimental data normalized to the ssm expectations .",
    "the length of these vectors is 3 or 4 depending on whether the experiment is included or not : @xmath47 the index @xmath48 denotes the different solar experiments : chlorine ( @xmath49 ) , gallium ( @xmath50 ) , superkamiokande ( @xmath22 ) and charged current @xmath0 ( ) .",
    "the correlation matrices , whether including the @xmath0 experiment or not , have been computed using standard techniques  @xcite . to test a particular oscillation hypothesis @xmath51 against the parameters of the best fit",
    ", we perform a minimization of the @xmath52 as a function of the oscillation parameters .",
    "a point in parameter space @xmath51 is allowed if the globally subtracted @xmath53 fulfills the condition @xmath54 . where @xmath55 are the @xmath56 degrees of freedom quantiles .",
    "a more elaborated statistical analysis is necessary once one introduces the @xmath22 energy spectrum into the analysis ( section  * [ spectrumsection ] * ) .",
    "the procedure assumed by the @xmath22 collaboration , in order to present its own analysis and obtain the tables of bin correlated errors , is that of using the summation @xmath57 where each term is of the form  @xcite @xmath58 and where the expression @xmath59 is the response function for the correlated error in the @xmath60-energy bin .",
    "the @xmath61 are bin - correlated uncertainties and @xmath62 is an overall flux normalization factor .",
    "the correlation parameter @xmath63 is arbitrary and determined in the minimization process together with the rest of oscillation parameters .",

    "it can be easily shown that the expression to be presented below leads to the @xmath22 expressions   whose effect is negligible ] .",
    "therefore , for the analysis of the full set of data including @xmath22 energy spectrum , we consider a @xmath1 function which is sum of two quantities @xmath64 .",
    "the first one is given by eq .",
    "( [ chi1 ] ) considering only @xmath49 , @xmath50 and total rates , while for the second term we adopt the definition @xmath65 a subindex @xmath66 corresponding to separated day and night quantities is understood for any @xmath67 vector and @xmath32 matrix .",
    "we have introduced the flux normalization factor @xmath62 and the correlation parameter @xmath63 .",
    "the complete variance matrix is not a constant quantity .",
    "it is obtained by combining the statistical variances with systematic uncertainties and dependent on this correlation parameter .",
    "the corresponding @xmath1 terms in eq .",
    "( [ chi2 ] ) are @xmath68 the central value @xmath69 corresponds to the bpb  2001 flux .",
    "the uncertainty on @xmath62 comes from the @xmath70 uncertainty in the flux and we make an average of the two - side errors taking @xmath71  @xcite .",
    "the correlation parameter is assumed to be constrained to vary in a gaussian way with an error corresponding to @xmath72 and we take @xmath73 .    in this work we consider two cases . in the first case the flux normalization is taken to be free ( we allow for a very large @xmath74 in the @xmath75 term ) .",
    "as a second possibility we consider that both quantities @xmath62 and @xmath63 are constrained .",
    "note that the unwanted consequence of eliminating the last term @xmath76 would be to obtain running - away solutions for the optimal value of this parameter .",
    "the @xmath1 summation now contains 41 bins in total : 3 from the global rates ( all the experiments except @xmath22 ) and 2@xmath7719 bins for the @xmath22 day and night spectrums .",
    "the full correlation matrix is defined by blocks .",
    "the 3@xmath773 block corresponding to the global rates is defined as above . for each day and night",
    "spectrum the corresponding 19@xmath7719 block correlation matrices are conservatively constructed assuming full correlation among energy bins   is equivalent to the relaxation of this condition during minimization . ] .",
    "the components of the variance matrix are @xmath78 where @xmath79 are the statistic errors and the quantities @xmath80 are respectively the bin - correlated experimental , the spectrum calculation uncertainties and the bin - uncorrelated ones .",
    "notice that in the above sum we do not simultaneously include the global ratio for @xmath22 and the partial spectrum bins .",
    "we ignore any correlation between the spectrum information and the global rates of all experiments except @xmath22 itself .",
    "finally , a remark is in order . in this case",
    "the defined covariance matrix is dependent on one of the fitting parameters .",
    "one does not , however have to add any correction ( i.e. @xmath81 terms ) to the @xmath82 expression as long as we sit at @xmath83 . to test a particular oscillation hypothesis and obtain",
    "allowed regions in parameter space we perform a minimization of the four dimensional function @xmath84 .",
    "the minimization of the expression with respect to @xmath62 and @xmath63 is done analytically .",
    "the subsequent minimization in the @xmath85 plane is numerical . for @xmath86 , a given point in the oscillation parameter space",
    "is allowed if the globally subtracted quantity fulfills the condition @xmath87 . where @xmath88 are the quantiles for four degrees of freedom .",
    "we have used data on the total event rates measured at chlorine homestake experiment , at the gallium experiments @xmath89  @xcite , @xmath90  @xcite and @xmath91  @xcite and at the water and heavy - water @xmath22 ( live time 1258 days )  @xcite and @xmath0 ( @xmath20,@xmath18 240 days  @xcite ) experiments ( see table  ( [ tableratios ] ) for an explicit list of results and references ) .    for the purposes of this work",
    "it is enough to summarize all the gallium experiments in one single quantity by taking the weighted average of their rates .",
    "in addition , for @xmath22 we use the available information for the day and night energy spectrums . for each of the day and night cases",

    "it illustrates how the data impose additional constraints on the parameter space and in particular how the sma solution loses its statistical significance in favor of the lma and low regions , becoming allowed only at marginal @xmath92 confidence levels .",
    "we present results both with and without the inclusion of the global rate . in the analysis of the global rates of the @xmath22 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 ( ) experiments one has two free parameters @xmath93 and @xmath94 and 3 ( 4 ) experimental quantities , therefore the effective number of degrees of freedom ( d.o.f . )",

    "( [ f1a ] ) we present graphically our results respectively before and after including the global rate . in the plots one can see the regions which are allowed at 90 , 95 , 99 and @xmath115 confidence levels .",

    "the large contiguous areas at 3 and @xmath116 which are present along @xmath117 in the first case are converted into well separated patches after the inclusion of @xmath0 results .",
    "the most serious consequence is however the considerable reduction on the significance of the sma region . from the analysis of the four global rates a good part of this region becomes acceptable only at some marginal level . in these and",
    "next plots , the region above the line at high @xmath93 is excluded at @xmath118 cl from the negative results of @xmath119 and palo verde  @xcite .",
    "note that regions for very large @xmath120 @xmath121 are excluded at the @xmath122 level without need of the @xmath119 result once we included the @xmath0 data .",
    "the reduction of the sma region can be explained from the tables of deviation ( right part in tables  ( [ table1a]-[table1b ] ) ) .",
    "before the introduction of the global rate in the computation and @xmath1 minimization the residuals for the data corresponding to the best fit are very high ( table  ( [ table1a ] ) ) : @xmath123 for the sma and also for the low solution .",
    "the residual values for remaining regions are however smaller . when the data is incorporated into the fit",
    "the sma and low regions become less favored .",
    "the effect is much more important for the relatively small sma region .",
    "for the low region the initial area is large and nearby minima can be found to adjust for the data and still provide reasonable quality fits .      in this section we present the results obtained when including the @xmath22 day and night energy spectrum rates in addition to the total event rates of @xmath49 , @xmath50 experiments and .",

    "@xmath131 ) than the levels obtained in global rates only analysis .",
    "this is only in part an artifact of the statistical machinery .",
    "it is a satisfactory result because it basically reflects the internal consistency of the data : although the number of degrees of freedom have considerably increased , the @xmath1 per d.o.f is still much the same .",
