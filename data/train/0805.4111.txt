    "dwarf novae are a subclass of cataclysmic variables ( cvs ) that consist of a white dwarf primary and a late - type secondary .",
    "the secondary fills its roche lobe and transfers gases into the primary through the inner lagragian point ( l1 ) .",
    "the transferred matter forms an accretion disk around the white dwarf .",
    "the accretion disk causes instabilities , which are observed as an outburst ( for a review , see @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "su uma - type stars are a subclass of dwarf novae .",
    "the majority have orbital periods below 2 hours .",
    "this subclass exhibits two types of outbursts .",
    "one is a normal outburst , lasting a few days .",
    "the other is a superoutburst lasting about 2 weeks .",
    "the most characteristic feature during the superoutburst is that the light curve always shows modulations termed superhump .",
    "the observed period of superhumps is a few percent longer than the orbital period of the system .",
    "this is well explained by the precessing eccentric disk , which is deformed at the 3:1 resonance radius ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "eg aquarii ( hereafter eg aqr ) was introduced as a candidate for dwarf novae by @xcite and later by @xcite .",
    "the variability of eg aqr was reported in @xcite , in which the variable was at 14.0 mag on 1958 november 5 .",
    "there are no other positive and negative observations except this around this outburst , so that we can not lead to the conclusion of the nature of the outburst .",
    "@xcite performed optical spectroscopy of the variable .",
    "the result was , however , that the spectrum showed no emission in balmer series . on the contrary",
    ", it resembles that of a k - type star . there is a possibility that the star was simply misidentified by @xcite .",
    "our astrometric estimation of the variable from the outbursting images yielded ra @xmath5 and dec @xmath6 , respectively .",
    "this means that the variable is identical with usno b1.0 0816 - 0716959 ( ra @xmath7 , dec @xmath8 , @xmath9=18.760 @xmath10=18.260).=18.651 and @xmath11=-0.062 . ] . concerning these results ,",

    "one of the most unique properties in eg aqr is the inactivity of the system . as mentioned before , there is only one recorded outburst since the discovery of eg aqr until the current one .",
    "no outbursts were detected by the asas-3 over the past 5 years , during which the variable was below the detection limit of @xmath20=14.5 .",
    "we also explored visual observations reported to the aavso and vsnet since 1999 .",
    "eg aqr was especially monitored in 1999 , 2000 , and 2004 with a mean interval of observations being a few days .",
    "these intensive observation may detect not only superoutburst but also normal outburst if they really occur .",
    "however , no outbursts were reported until 2006 . although we should await an investigation on archival plates to draw a firm conclusion as to whether eg aqr is indeed inactive , the current available information on eg aqr may suggest its inactive nature .",
    "the non - detection of a normal outburst in eg aqr may also support its long recurrence time , since the frequency of normal outburst is related to the length of the supercycle @xcite .",
    "as noted above , extensive ccd photometry revealed the su uma nature of eg aqr .",
    "superhumps were clearly visible during the course of the superoutburst for the first time in eg aqr .",
    "as for the light curve itself , we should note on the presence of a precursor and the presence of superhumps at the end of the precursor . in the previous section ,",
    "we have shown the @xmath34 diagram , in which we measured the maximum timings at the end of the precursor , corresponding to @xmath24=-4 and -3 .",
    "the obtained @xmath34 diagram strongly suggests that the light source of the variations in -4@xmath278 comes from the same origin , since a phase shift or a change of the period were not seen .",
    "this means that the modulations were coherent for -4@xmath278 .",
    "as can be seen in figure [ elc ] the modulations that we observed around @xmath24=8 were genuine superhumps .",
    "therefore , it is likely that superhumps had already grown at the end of the precursor .",
    "if this is the case , eg aqr is the second example that superhumps were seen even during a precursor , following the 1993 superoutburst of t leo @xcite .",
    "besides the presence of the superhumps during the precursor , the overall light curve is typical of su uma - type dwarf novae , in terms of the duration of the plateau phase , as well as the decline rate of the magnitude .",
    "the presence of a precursor also supports its su uma nature of eg aqr , since no precursor has been reported for wz sge - type dwarf novae @xcite .",
    "as is well known , most of su uma - type dwarf novae decrease their superhump period during the course of the plateau stage .",
    "this is due to shrinkage of the disk , or a natural consequence of the depletion of the mass @xcite .",
    "recent studies , however , have shown that some systems increase the superhump period during the plateau phase @xcite .",
    "so far , the exact mechanism that causes the superhump period change is not known .",
    "recently , @xcite has suggested that the superhump period change may be related to the presence or absence of a precursor .",
    "the authors studied a short period su uma - type dwarf nova tv crv for the 2002 and 2004 superoutburst , and discovered that the superhump period increased during the 2002 superoutburst without a precursor , while hardly changed during the 2004 superoutburst with a precursor .",
    "theoretically , @xcite proposed the refined thermal - tidal instability model , in which a superoutburst without a precursor have a larger disk radius than that with a precursor .",
    "when the accretion disk reaches the tidal truncation radius as a result of the mass accretion onto the white dwarf , the stored matter at the outer edge may prevent the inner propagation of the cooling wave , so that the disk keeps the hot state . on the other hand ,",
    "if the accretion disk does not reach the tidal truncation radius , the outermost region of the disk allows the cooling wave to propagate inward . as a consequence",
    ", the outburst is quenched like a normal one .",
    "if the eccentricity of the accretion disk grows sufficiently , the tidal dissipation at the rim of the disk leads to the orientation of the heating wave .",
    "this process is observed as a superoutburst with a precursor .    in the case of eg aqr ,",
    "the superoutburst was accompanied by a precursor , indicating that the radius of the accretion disk did not reach the tidal truncation radius .",
    "this , however , seems to be peculiar when taking into account the long quiescent time of the object .",
    "the long quiescence means a large amount of mass in the accretion disk , like wz sge - type dwarf novae .",
    "however , the duration of the plateau stage , as well as the presence of a precursor are indicative of the small disk of the object compared to wz sge - type dwarf novae .    during the main plateau stage ,",
    "the best fitting quadratic formula yielded @xmath30 = @xmath31/@xmath22 = @xmath28.2@xmath3210@xmath4 , which is a normal value for su uma - type dwarf novae .",
    "the value is quite different from that observed in wz sge - type stars , which show positive period derivatives , or almost constant value of the superhump periods @xcite .",
    "although quiescence of eg aqr behaves as wz sge - type dwarf novae , the overall feature of the superhump period changes and the light curve of the superoutburst bear strong resemblance to those of usual su uma - type dwarf novae .    regarding the early phase of the observations , it again should be noted that the superhump period unchanged and a sort of period change occurred near the bright maximum .",
    "although evidence of such period changes has been provided in other su uma - type dwarf novae ( e.g. , figure 5 of @xcite ) , this is the first case that we specify when the transition occurred . in future",
    ", we should investigate whether the period change is a ubiquitous property for su uma - type dwarf novae by observing other objects , which shed lights on understanding the origin of the period shift .",
    "so far , as much as 200 objects have been confirmed to be su uma - type dwarf novae , for which we may divide them into two categories according to their superhump periods and their tendency of the period derivatives .",
    "there exists a rough cutoff around @xmath35=0.063 days below which the superhump period tends to increase during the superoutburst @xcite . on the other hand , for systems above @xmath36=0.063 days , where the majority of su uma - type dwarf novae exists , the superhump period tends to decrease or keep almost constant .",
    "the latter systems are sometimes introduced as `` textbook '' su uma - type dwarf novae @xcite .",
    "however , when we focus on the long - term behavior of the respective system , we notice the diversity of the nature .",
    "for example , a prototype su uma - type star vw hyi shows frequent normal outbursts between two successive superoutbursts with a mean recurrence time of the superoutburst being 150 days @xcite .",
    "such systems are well reproduced by the thermal - tidal instability model ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "some long - period systems , on the other hand , hardly show not only a normal outburst , but also a superoutburst .",
    "these systems include ef peg ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , v725 aql ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , qy per , and eg aqr .",
    "all of these systems have a long recurrence time of years , indicating that the mass transfer rate from the secondary is supposed to be small .",
    "this seems to be curious because the secular evolution of dwarf novae suggests the existence of relatively high mass secondaries compared to those in short period dwarf novae unless the binaries are so called `` period bouncers '' ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "it is unlikely that these systems had passed the period minimum of dwarf novae , since the evolutional timescale for `` period bouncers '' may be as long as @xmath0 10 gyrs @xcite .",
    "optical and infrared spectroscopy show mid m - type secondaries in ef peg @xcite .",
    "this indicates that this system does not reach the period minimum , because the `` period bouncers '' are believed to contain a brown dwarf secondary @xcite .    at present",
    ", we can not specify the reason why such inactive systems do exist in long period systems .",
    "in fact , these systems are less studied , especially during quiescence .",
    "actually , we have no information on the orbital period of the above four systems . in future , quiescent spectroscopy is imperative in order to determine the orbital period and the spectral type of the secondary of the system .",
    "this would shed some light on the evolutional status of the above mentioned systems .",
    "we established the su uma nature of eg aqr for the first time by the detection of the superhumps with a mean period of 0.078828(6 ) days . the observed superoutburst showed a precursor , during which a hint of superhumps was seen at the last stage of the precursor .",
    "extensive observations enabled us to examine detailed changes of the superhump period .",
    "it turned out that the superhump period kept almost constant near the bright maximum , after which the superhump period decreased normally at the rate of @xmath30 = @xmath31/@xmath22 = @xmath28.2@xmath3210@xmath4 all over the plateau stage .",
    "although the origin is unknown , we detected a change of the period near the bright maximum .",
    "concerning the observed period change and the presence of the precursor , the maximum radius of the accretion disk was not large during the superoutburst .",
    "the obtained light curves were typical of those of su uma - type dwarf novae .",
    "this is definitely peculiar when taking into account that eg aqr showed only one recorded eruption until the 2006 superoutburst . despite the inactivity of the variable , we conclude that eg aqr is a new member of su uma - type dwarf novae . in future , quiescent studies both from photometry and spectroscopy",

    "<S> we report time - resolved ccd photometry of the cataclysmic variable eg aquarii during the 2006 november outburst during the outburst , superhumps were unambiguously detected with a mean period of 0.078828(6 ) days , firstly classifying the object as an su uma - type dwarf nova . </S>",
    "<S> it also turned out that the outburst contained a precursor . at the end of the precursor , </S>",
    "<S> immature profiles of humps were observed . by a phase analysis of these humps </S>",
    "<S> , we interpreted the features as superhumps . </S>",
    "<S> this is the second example that the superhumps were shown during a precursor . </S>",
    "<S> near the maximum stage of the outburst , we discovered an abrupt shift of the superhump period by @xmath0 0.002 days . </S>",
    "<S> after the supermaximum , the superhump period decreased at the rate of @xmath1=@xmath28.2@xmath310@xmath4 , which is typical for su uma - type dwarf novae . </S>",
    "<S> although the outburst light curve was characteristic of su uma - type dwarf novae , long - term monitoring of the variable shows no outbursts over the past decade . </S>",
    "<S> we note on the basic properties of long period and inactive su uma - type dwarf novae . </S>"
