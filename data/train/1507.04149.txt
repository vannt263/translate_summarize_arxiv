    "in the past few decades , localization of waves in disordered structures known as anderson localization has attracted growing attention , in various fields of physics .",
    "starting from early studies of the localization of electronic wave functions in disordered crystals @xcite , it is believed that the localized states appear in a wide variety of classical and quantum materials .",
    "the possible occurrence of anderson localization for electrons in disordered solids @xcite , ultrasound and acoustic waves @xcite , the transport of light @xcite , microwave @xcite , matter waves @xcite and cold atoms @xcite are just a few examples among many others .",
    "all these disordered systems are typically composed of regions with very different kinds of the spatial distribution of disorder .",
    "the question is what one would expect for effects of the distribution of disorder on controlling the localization properties .",
    "this interesting question has been basis of numerous theoretical and experimental studies @xcite .",
    "more recently , some engineered tunable random mediums have been assembled in the lab that follows the lvy type distribution @xcite .",
    "lvy processes have a power - law distribution @xmath1 , where @xmath0 is the so called lvy exponent @xcite .",
    "power law distributions have been appeared in different physical phenomena such as spectral fluctuation in random lasers @xcite , superdiffusive transport of light across glass microspheres whose diameters have levy distribution @xcite , quantum coherent transport of electrons in one- dimensional ( @xmath2d ) disordered wires with lvy - type distribution @xcite .",
    "recently , fernandez - marin _ et al .",
    "_ have investigated numerically how transmission of electromagnetic waves varies with the system size in a @xmath2d random system in which the layer thicknesses follow a lvy - type distribution with the exponent @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "they demonstrated that @xmath3 for @xmath4 , whereas @xmath5 is proportional to the system size @xmath6 for @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "furthermore , fernandez - marn _ et al . _",
    "have experimentally studied the microwave electromagnetic wave transmission through a waveguide composed of dielectric slabs where spacing between them follows a distribution with a power - law tail ( @xmath0-stable lvy distribution ) @xcite .",
    "they observed an anomalous localization for the case @xmath8 in which transmission @xmath9 decays with length of waveguide as @xmath10 while in the case of standard localization @xmath11 , @xmath12 being the localization length @xcite .",
    "more recently , zakeri _ et al .",
    "_ have investigated anderson localization of the classical lattice waves in a chain with mass impurities distributed randomly through a power - law relation @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the distance between two successive impurities @xcite . for this 1d harmonic disordered lattice of @xmath15-sites with random masses",
    "@xmath16 , they have indicated that in the small frequencies for @xmath17 , the localization length behaves as @xmath18 .     in this paper , we propose a 1d disordered multilayered structure in which the random refractive index of one of its constituents follows a probability density function with a power - law tail with exponent @xmath0 ( lvy - type distribution ) .",
    "the propagation of an obliquely incident electromagnetic wave through the structure is studied using the transfer matrix method .",
    "the effects of variation of the exponent @xmath0 on the localization length and anderson localization are investigated in different frequency ranges .",
    "it is shown that the localization length decreases with decreasing @xmath0 for both @xmath17 and @xmath8 at intermediate and large frequencies .",
    "furthermore , at small frequencies the localization length depends on values of @xmath0 . in this structure , the localization length can be also affected by the incident angle .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sec .",

    "iii . finally , we draw our conclusions in sec",

    "( [ figure:1 ] ) displays a scheme of the proposed structure .     with @xmath23 layers with the fixed thickness @xmath24 .",
    "the refractive index @xmath25 is fixed and the distribution of the @xmath26s follows a lvy - type distribution . , width=340 ]    it is assumed that the layers @xmath20 have the same refractive index @xmath25 and the same width of @xmath22 , while layers @xmath19 have the same thickness of @xmath21 and random refractive indices @xmath27(@xmath28 ) .",
    "the number of layers in the structure is taken to be @xmath29 and the @xmath30-axis is directed across the layers .    here we consider @xmath31 , where @xmath32 are independent identically distributed random variables with standard symmetric @xmath0-stable distribution .",
    "the procedure of computer simulating realizations of the random variables @xmath32 is the following @xcite :    @xmath33^{1/\\alpha } } \\left ( \\frac{\\cos\\left(v-\\alpha v\\right)}{w}\\right)^{(1-\\alpha)/\\alpha}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where random variable @xmath34 has exponential distribution with mean @xmath2 and @xmath35 is uniformly distributed on @xmath36 .",
    "the algorithm introduced in eq .",
    "( [ random_var_levy ] ) allows us to generate a sequence of random numbers with @xmath0-stable distribution for the whole range of parameter @xmath37 .",
    "the main feature of a @xmath0-stable lvy density distribution @xmath38 is the power - law , decay of its tail which behaves as : @xmath39 .",
    "we choose random numbers @xmath32 which their absolute values are in the range @xmath40 .",
    "the refractive index of layer @xmath19 is taken to be @xmath41 .",
    "the transfer matrix formalism is used to compute the localization length of the structure .",
    "we consider a monochromatic electromagnetic wave obliquely incident from left into the random structure . in fig .",

    "the wave vector @xmath42 is taken to be in @xmath44-plane .",
    "the electric and magnetic fields at incident and exit ends of the structure can be related by the product of transfer matrix of different layers included in the heterostructure as : @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the total transfer matrix of the system and @xmath47(@xmath48 ) is the transfer matrix of the @xmath49 dielectric layer which is defined as : @xmath50 here @xmath51 for tm case and @xmath52 for te case , @xmath53 denotes the @xmath30 component of the wave vector in dielectric layers , and @xmath54 is the thickness of different dielectric layers . for a plane wave strikes from left into the disordered structure ,",
    "the transmission coefficient @xmath55 is expressed in terms of the matrix element of @xmath46 as follows : @xmath56 the corresponding transmittance of the structure at frequency @xmath57 is : @xmath58 to study the localization behavior in the @xmath2d random system , it is required to evaluate the localization length .",
    "since the transmittance in the localized regime exponentially decays with the system length @xmath6 , the localization length @xmath12 can be numerically calculated as @xmath59 for a sufficiently long random - layered system , @xmath12 obtained from the above equation is a nonrandom number due to self - averaging .",
    "however , for a system with a finite size , the localization length can be obtained by ensemble averaging of the transmittance @xmath60 over many realizations .",
    "this means that we introduce the localization length of a finite random configuration as @xmath61 where @xmath62 stands for the ensemble averaging .",
    "the values of those parameters used in the following calculations are @xmath63 , @xmath64 , @xmath65 and @xmath66 . in the next section",
    ", we will discuss our numerical findings .",
    "we first study the case at which the plane wave is normally incident into the random structure .",
    "it is assumed the frequency of the incident wave is in the range @xmath67 . in order to understand how localization length can be affected by the variation of @xmath0 values , in fig .",
    "( [ figure:2 ] ) , we plot the localization length in units of the system length ( normalized localization length ) as a function of frequency @xmath57 for different values of @xmath0 . to obtain localization length , @xmath68",

    "the system is in the localized regime .",
    "when @xmath0 decreases from @xmath69 to @xmath70 , the minimum frequency at which localization occurs shifts toward lower frequencies .",
    "our numerical results confirm the self - averaging of the localization length .",
    "that is the localization length obtained from eq . ( 7 ) does not significantly differ from the localization length of a single realization with large number of layers .",
    "furthermore , increasing the number of random realizations from @xmath71 does not lead to any considerable change in localization length values .    to determine whether or not this dependence of localization length on the @xmath0 values is observed in the case of oblique incidence , we display the normalized localization length versus frequency for @xmath72 and @xmath73 in fig .",

    "furthermore , the dip in localization length moves to higher frequencies with increasing incident angle .",
    "therefore , our calculated results indicate that the localization length depends on the incident angle as well as the exponent @xmath0 .",
    "it is well known that for tm polarized waves propagating in a 1d random structure the localization length takes a large maximum value at some critical angles which are called generalized brewster angles @xcite .",
    "it has been demonstrated that generalized brewster angle increases from @xmath81 to @xmath82 with increasing the disorder - averaged refractive index @xcite .",
    "the localization length for a weak disorder diverges in the vicinity oh @xmath83 when the average of refractive index is equal to 1 @xcite .",
    "this phenomenon is known as brewster anomalies and the corresponding angle is called the brewster angle @xcite . in fig .",

    "( [ figure:6 ] ) , the average value of refractive index increases with increasing @xmath0 . as a result ,",
    "increases of @xmath0 leads to the decreasing the refractive index contrast between the layers of disordered system .",

    "( [ figure:6 ] ) represents the variance of refractive index versus @xmath0 .",
    "one can see that the variance of refractive index increases with decreasing @xmath0 .",

    "for all wavelengths , the system is in the extended regime . with decreasing the @xmath0 values , the peaks of normalized localization length shift to lower frequencies",
    ", while the peak values decreases .",
    "consequently , our results demonstrate that if the distribution of the random layer in a @xmath2d disordered system follows the @xmath0-stable lvy distribution , the localization length can be manipulated with the exponent @xmath0 . due to the random nature of anderson localization ,",

    "when @xmath0 decreases , the localization length of the waves decreases in the frequency range @xmath93 decreases .",
    "this effect is due to the increase of mean and variance of refractive index with decrease of @xmath0 .",
    "moreover , the minimum frequency at which localization appears shifts to lower frequencies with decreasing @xmath0 .",
    "localization length shows the same trend with variation of @xmath0 for oblique incidence .",
    "it has been also investigated how the localization length can be affected by @xmath0 variation in the lower and higher frequency ranges . in the frequency range @xmath94 ,",
    "the system is in the localized regime and the localization length indicate an oscillatory behavior with approximately fixed amplitudes .",
    "decrease of @xmath0 in this frequency range also gives rise to the enhancement of localization . in the frequency range @xmath95 .",
    "it is found the system is in the extended regime and the localization length exhibits an oscillatory behavior with increasing amplitude whose value decreases with decreasing @xmath0 .",
    "furthermore , reduction of @xmath0 causes the peaks of localization length to shift toward lower frequencies .",
