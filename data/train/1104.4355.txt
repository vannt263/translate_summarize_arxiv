    "the paradox of enrichment was first observed by m. rosenzweig @xcite in a class of mathematical predator - prey models . since then , there have been a lot of studies on the subject @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite .",
    "these studies cover a wide spectrum of topics including invulnerable prey , unpalatable prey , prey toxicity , induced defense , spatial inhomogeneity etc .. the paradox roughly says that in a predator - prey system , increasing the nutrition to the prey may lead to an extinction of both the prey and the predator .",
    "it is possible that the paradox is purely an artifact of the mathematical models , while in reality increasing the nutrition never leads to extinction .",
    "our studies here totally focus upon the mathematical models themselves .",
    "we are not exploring the experimental aspect of the subject .",
    "as far as the original mathematical models @xcite are concerned , we notice that the paradox can be resolved once the models are put into dimensionless forms . in dimensionless forms , the essential functions of control parameters can be revealed .",
    "the predator - prey model is as follows ( a spatio - temporal extension of one of those in @xcite ) , @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the prey density , @xmath3 is the predator density , @xmath4 is the time coordinate , @xmath5 is the one - dimensional space coordinate , @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the coefficients of migration due to predation , @xmath8 is the spreading ( diffusion ) coefficient of the species ( chosen to be the same for both predator and prey ) , @xmath9 is the maximal per capita birth rate of the prey , @xmath10 is the carrying capacity of the prey from the nutrients , @xmath11 is the half - saturation prey density for predation , @xmath12 is the coefficient of the intensity of predation , @xmath13 is the coefficient of food utilization of the predator , and @xmath14 is the mortality rate of the predator .",
    "the last two terms in equation ( [ mod1 ] ) , i.e. the prey birth term and the predation term , can take many different specific forms , but have the same characteristics as ( [ mod1 ] ) , which leads to the paradox of enrichment , see @xcite .",
    "equations ( [ mod1])-([mod2 ] ) can be rewritten in the following dimensionless form : @xmath15 where @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , and the dimensionless numbers are given by @xmath20 we name @xmath0 : the capacity - predation number , and @xmath21 : the mortality - food number .",
    "these two dimensionless numbers are crucial in our resolution of the paradox of enrichment . the spatial domain is chosen to be finite @xmath22 $ ] .",
    "three types of boundary conditions can be posed ,    1 .",
    "neumann boundary condition , @xmath23 2 .",
    "periodic boundary condition , @xmath24 and @xmath25 are periodic in @xmath26 with period @xmath27 ; 3 .",
    "dirichlet boundary condition , @xmath28    in the dirichlet boundary condition case , the spatially uniform dynamics [ @xmath29 in ( [ md1])-([md2 ] ) ] is excluded .",
    "thus the orginal paradox of enrichment for the uniform dynamics posed by m. rosenzweig @xcite is also excluded .",
    "the paradox of enrichment was originally formulated by m. rosenzweig @xcite for the spatially uniform dynamics [ @xmath29 in ( [ mod1])-([mod2 ] ) ] : @xmath30 the paradox focuses upon the linear stability of the steady state given by @xmath31 it turns out that when other parameters are fixed , increasing @xmath10 leads to the loss of stability of this steady state , in which case , a limit cycle attractor around the steady state is generated . as @xmath10 increases , the limit cycle gets closer and closer to the @xmath3-axis .",
    "that is , along the limit cycle attractor , the prey population @xmath2 decreases to a very small value . under the ecological random perturbations , @xmath2 can reach @xmath32 , i.e. extinction of the prey . with the extinction of the prey",
    ", the predator will become extinct soon . on the other hand ,",
    "increasing @xmath10 means increasing the carrying capacity of the prey , which can be implemented by increasing the prey s nutrients , i.e. enrichment of the prey s environment .",
    "intuitively , increasing @xmath10 should enlarge the prey population and make it more robust from extinction .",
    "this is the paradox of enrichment .",
    "in order to resolve the paradox of enrichment , it is fundamental to rewrite the system ( [ ud1])-([ud2 ] ) in the dimensionless form [ @xmath29 in ( [ md1])-([md2 ] ) ] : @xmath33 and the key to the resolution is a complete understanding of the dimensionless capacity - predation number @xmath0 .",
    "first we need to understand the dynamics of ( [ umd1])-([umd2 ] ) in details . for all parameter values , there are two trivial steady states : @xmath34 the steady state ( i ) is a saddle for all parameter values .",
    "the steady state ( ii ) is a stable node when @xmath35 , a saddle when @xmath36 in which case , a nontrivial steady state is born .",
    "that is , when @xmath36 , there is a nontrivial steady state which is our main focus : @xmath37 which is the intersection point of the parabola and the vertical line ( figure [ pv ] ) : @xmath38 ^ 2 + \\left [ \\frac{1}{2}(1+h ) \\right ] ^2 , \\quad ( v ) .",

    "\\label{uev}\\ ] ] the sign of the real part of @xmath43 is decided by the sign of the quantity @xmath44 .",
    "setting @xmath45 , one gets @xmath46 which is on the symmetry axis of the parabola ( p ) .",
    "this leads to the following fact first observed by m. rosenzweig @xcite :    * if @xmath47 in ( [ fp ] ) is to the left of the symmetry axis of the parabola ( p ) , then the steady state ( [ fp ] ) is linearly unstable . if @xmath47 in ( [ fp ] ) is to the right of the symmetry axis of the parabola ( p ) , then the steady state ( [ fp])is linearly stable",
    ". if @xmath47 in ( [ fp ] ) is on the symmetry axis of the parabola ( p ) , then the eigenvalues @xmath43 in ( [ uev ] ) are purely imaginary .",
    "using this fact , we derive the following linear instability criterion of the steady state ( [ fp ] ) : @xmath48 ( an interesting note is that the unstable zone ( [ h ] ) is symmetric with respect to @xmath49 , i.e. it is the same with @xmath50 . ) based upon this instability criterion , we offer the following resolution of the paradox of enrichment .    * * the resolution * : unlike the original form of the model ( [ ud1])-([ud2 ] ) , the dimensionless form of the model ( [ umd1])-([umd2 ] ) is governed by @xmath51 dimensionless numbers @xmath0 , @xmath21 and @xmath52 ( [ dln ] ) ; while the instability of the steady state ( [ fp ] ) is governed by @xmath53 of them , @xmath0 and @xmath21 .",
    "@xmath0 is a ratio of the half - saturation @xmath11 and carrying capacity @xmath10 , while @xmath21 is independent of @xmath11 and @xmath10 , and is a ratio of predator mortality rate @xmath14 and coefficient of growth from food @xmath54 .",
    "the instability criterion ( [ h ] ) says that for a fixed @xmath21 , @xmath55 ; when @xmath0 is smaller than @xmath56 , the steady state ( [ fp ] ) is linearly unstable ( leading to possible extinction ) .",
    "the model displays a very special feature : increasing the carrying capacity @xmath10 ( for fixed half - saturation @xmath11 ) and decreasing the half - saturation @xmath11 ( for fixed carrying capacity @xmath10 ) have the same effect on the capacity - predation number @xmath0 , that is , @xmath0 decreases .",
    "decreasing the half - saturation @xmath11 implies more aggressive predation ( especially when the prey population @xmath2 is small ) , see figure [ slh ] . notice that @xmath57 and @xmath58 since there is no paradox between more aggressive predation ( especially when the prey population @xmath2 is small ) and extinction of prey led by the instability of the steady state ( [ fp ] ) , the paradox of enrichment now reduces to a paradox between more aggressive predation ( decreasing the half - saturation @xmath11 ) and enrichment ( increasing the carrying capacity @xmath10 ) . as mentioned above",
    ", the special feature of the model ( [ umd1])-([umd2 ] ) is that more aggressive predation ( decreasing @xmath11 ) and enrichment ( increasing @xmath10 ) is not a paradox , and results in the same effect on the governing dimensionless number @xmath0 .",
    "this offers a resolution to the so - called paradox of enrichment .",
    "from last section , we see that the predation term in ( [ umd1])-([umd2 ] ) is mostly responsible for generating the so - called paradox of enrichment . in this section , we will explore more general form of the predation term .",

    "notice that @xmath68 thus , for small @xmath11 , the model @xmath61 represents a much more aggressive predation than @xmath67 when the prey population @xmath2 is small .",
