    "a majority of the @xmath3230 currently confirmed galactic supernova remnants ( snrs ) listed in the latest snr catalogue @xcite were first identified through radio surveys .",
    "however , with the advent of sensitive x - ray satellites , about half a dozen remnants have now been discovered via their x - ray emission ( cf . @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the first galactic snr discovered through its x - ray emission was reported by @xcite .",
    "they found a previously unknown galactic snr based on the _ rosat _ detection of a relatively bright and nearly circular 108 diameter emission structure centred on @xmath0(j2000 ) = 4@xmath4 59@xmath5 @xmath6 , @xmath7(j2000 ) = 51@xmath8 @xmath9 @xmath10 . with an estimated 0.1  2.4  kev x - ray flux of @xmath11 erg @xmath12 s@xmath13 , this new remnant ranked among the ten brightest x - ray galactic snrs known at that time .",
    "@xcite concluded that the remnant was located in a region of very low interstellar density ( 0.01 atoms @xmath14 ) , which might help account , in part , for the remnant s lack of strong radio emission .",
    "the new remnant , designated g156.2 + 5.7 ( also rxj04591 + 5147 ) , was subsequently detected and confirmed in the radio by @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the object s bright x - ray flux , its 1 ghz radio surface brightness of @xmath15 w m@xmath16 hz@xmath13 sr@xmath13 ranks it as perhaps the faintest galactic snr currently known @xcite , being a factor of two in 1 ghz surface brightness below than of the exceptionally radio faint but optically [ o  iii ] bright remnant , g65.3 + 5.7 @xcite .",
    "follow - up searches for a central radio pulsar or central compact object have proven unsuccessful @xcite .        since shortly after its discovery , g156.2 +",
    "5.7 has been studied only in the x - rays . using the _ asca _ satellite , @xcite found both hard and soft x - ray components , an estimated sedov age of @xmath17 yr , and an ambient gas density of @xmath30.2 @xmath14 .",
    "more recently , @xcite used both _",
    "asca _ and _ rxte _ to study the the northwestern rim of g156.2 + 5.7 and investigate the presence of a non - thermal x - ray component and cosmic - ray acceleration .",
    "@xcite reported finding no associated optical emission on the palomar sky survey plates and there are no discernible emission features in this region visible on the relatively deep , narrow passband filter images of @xcite in their emission - line survey of the milky way .",
    "however , here we present wide field h@xmath0 images of the remnant which reveal a remarkably extensive and complex optical emission structure covering a large fraction of the remnant s x - ray shell .",
    "wide - field imaging of g156.2 + 5.7 ( hereafter referred to as g156 ) was performed using the mcdonald observatory 0.76-m telescope and the prime - focus corrector ( pfc ) camera @xcite .",
    "this system uses a 2048@xmath182048 loral fairchild front - side illuminated ccd which produces a plate scale of @xmath19 per pixel and an unvignetted field of view of @xmath20 with little spatial distortion ( @xmath21 , far better than the typical seeing ) .",
    "narrow passband imaging was carried out using a pair of matched interference filters ( fwhm 30  ) centred at 656.8 nm (= h@xmath0 ) and 651.0 nm (= adjacent red continuum ) .",
    "these filters were optimised for an f/7 setup , which caused some concern given the faster ( f/3 ) optics of the 0.76-m / pfc setup .",
    "however , tests on - sky suggest that the faster optics did not dramatically affect the performance .",
    "in particular we detect no significant change in h@xmath0 sensitivity between the centre and the edge of the detector ( other than the variation due to the flat - field ) .",
    "the h@xmath0 setup suffers from a strong internal reflection which is not present in the continuum images , and results in a characteristic halo around bright point sources .",
    "dome flats for both filters were obtained nightly and , whenever clear , twilight flats were also obtained in morning and evening twilight .",
    "since the s / n of the dome flats was significantly better , they were the primary images used for flat - field correction .",
    "however , the twilight flats were used to perform illumination corrections on the nightly dome flats .",
    "the illumination image was created via a two - stage process .",
    "first , all the twilight flats were combined , and each individual twilight flat was divided by the resulting average twilight image .",
    "any twilight frames which showed a significant gradient or other structure relative to the average were then removed and a second image was created using the reduced set of twilight frames .",
    "each of the nightly dome flats was then divided by this refined twilight image , and the illumination correction for the dome flat created via a 2-d , low - order polynomial fit .",
    "observations of g156 were carried out over three nights , 12 , 18 , & 19 january 2004 , in conditions ranging from photometric to moderate cirrus .",
    "since the remnant is much larger than the pfc field of view , it was covered in 13 partially overlapping telescope pointings . for each pointing a pair of 1000  s exposures",
    "was obtained in both the h@xmath0 and 6510 continuum filters .",
    "as the pfc does not have a working guider , the images were unguided , and the tracking rate of the telescope manually adjusted using an empirical mapping of the tracking rate for different declinations and hour angles .",
    "inevitably , this open - loop tracking and the long exposures required for narrow - band imaging resulted in some images with relatively poor point - spread functions ( psfs ) . at the scale of the remnant , this degradation of the image quality is not a serious problem .",
    "however , the psf of the paired h@xmath0 and continuum images are not always a perfect match if the tracking drift was larger in one of the two images .",
    "even in well tracked image pairs , the internal reflections in the h@xmath0 filter leave a residual halo around bright stars in the continuum subtracted images .    after bias and flat - field correction ,",
    "each pair of h@xmath0 and continuum images were registered via cross correlation routines in iraf , and trimmed to the overlapping region .",
    "the h@xmath0 images obtained in non - photometric data were scaled to match the flux levels in the photometric frames by matching the flux in aperture photometry of stars in the overlapping regions between the different pointings . for a couple of fields",
    ", there were no adjacent pointings taken in photometric conditions , and the flux was set matching re - scaled h@xmath0  flux in an adjacent image .",
    "the relative flux across the entire remnant is probably accurate to @xmath22% .    after setting the flux levels for each h@xmath0  image ,",
    "the paired continuum image was scaled to match using aperture photometry of a large number of field stars .",
    "the continuum image was then subtracted from the h@xmath0  image at each pointing , and the resulting continuum subtracted image was combined into a single mosaic .",
    "the continuum subtraction process often left a small residual level in the background , which was removed before the images were mosaiced together .",
    "this reduced the ` patchwork quilt ' appearance of the final mosaic , although variations in signal - to - noise and small flat - fielding errors mean that the combination of these multiple pointings is not seamless ( see fig.[ha ] ) .",
    "the reduced 6510    images were also similarly combined to create a mosaic continuum image .",
    "image of the g156 snr with the locations of the observed optical spectra shown .",
    "[ finder],width=317 ]    low - dispersion optical spectra of a few of the remnant s brighter emission knots were obtained on three nights between 10  12 september 2004 using the mdm 2.4-m telescope at kitt peak arizona and the modular spectrograph with a 600 lines mm@xmath13 6000   blaze grating and a @xmath23 slit .",
    "spectra were taken at four locations in the remnant s detected optical emission , two in the ne and sw ( see fig .",
    "[ finder ] ) with the slit orientated north - south across relatively bright features of the detected optical emission .",
    "total exposure times ranged from 300 to 900  s yielding spectra with an effective coverage of 6000  8000   and a spectral resolution of @xmath24 2   .",
    "standard iraf software was used for the data reduction with wavelength calibration using hg , ne , and xe lamps and flux calibration via @xcite standard stars . although all three nights were photometric , seeing varied between @xmath25 . as a result , slit light losses were considerable at times due to the variable seeing conditions and guiding errors .",
    "consequently , our measured absolute flux values are only accurate to @xmath26 25% .",
    "+    +    a separate 2000  s spectrum was taken of the suspected balmer - dominated , non - radiative filament along the remnant s eastern limb .",

    "aligned slit together with a 300 lines mm@xmath13 5000   blaze grism was used to yield a spectrum coverage of 5500  8000  , calibrated as before with hg , ne , and xe lamps and @xcite standard stars .",
    "our continuum subtracted h@xmath0  mosaic image is shown in figure  [ ha ] .",
    "the mosaic shows an extensive and complex h@xmath0  emission structure .",
    "while numerous features are readily apparent in this image , they are actually quite faint , with an estimated surface brightness of @xmath28 erg @xmath12 arcsec@xmath16 s@xmath13 for most of the brighter regions .",
    "the optical emission seen here is invisible on the palomar sky survey , in the relatively deep narrow passband filter images of @xcite , and is not listed in the atlas of galactic nebulae @xcite .",
    "two distinct morphologies are seen ; faint , thin ( often unresolved ) filamentary arcs some tens of arc minutes long , and much brighter more diffuse filamentary features like those seen in many optical galactic snrs .",
    "the thin filaments are primarily found near the edges of the detected optical emission structure , and are brightest along the eastern limb ( @xmath29 , @xmath30 ) and the northern limb ( @xmath31 , @xmath32 ) of the g156 snr .",
    "two regions exhibiting thin and partially overlapping filamentary arcs are shown in greater detail in the upper and lower left panels of figure  [ blowups ] .",
    "the morphology of such filamentary emission is reminiscent of the non - radiative , balmer - dominated shock emission along the outer edges of supernova remnants ( e.g. , the cygnus loop , tycho s snr , and sn 1006 ) .",
    "indeed , a spectrum of these filaments along the east rim of the detected emission structure ( at the point labelled `` nr '' in figure  [ finder ] ) showed only h@xmath0 line emission within the 6000  8000   wavelength range .",
    "such a spectrum is consistent with it being a balmer filament associated with non - radiative shock emission .",
    "although brightest to the north and east , these filaments can be seen to form a nearly unbroken shell of emission surrounding the brighter , more diffuse emission regions .",
    "these thin filaments fade out in the northwest near @xmath33 , @xmath34 and in the south at @xmath355@xmath36 , @xmath37 50@xmath38 .",
    "the lower right panel of figure  [ blowups ]  shows examples of both the faint filamentary emission and much brighter , more diffuse and clumpy filament type emission .",
    "clumpy filaments are the brightest h@xmath0 features detected in the g156 region and form a patchy arc which loops from the ne down to the sw region of the remnant region ( see fig .  1 ) . in the ne , this arc is dominated by a large complex of filaments at @xmath39 , @xmath40 , which exhibits considerable internal structure",
    ". we will refer to this feature as the `` ne filament complex '' .",
    "in the southwest portion of the h@xmath0 mosaic image , this clumpy type of emission forms a bright ridge which is broken by an apparent foreground dust - lane near @xmath41 , @xmath42 .",

    "this figure shows that the detected gentle arcs of thin filamentary emission lie along the outermost edge of the remnant s observed x - ray emission , confirming that these are indeed non - radiative emission from the outer blast wave of the supernova remnant . along the ne limb , the non - radiative filaments bulge outward a bit from their otherwise relatively circular arc .",
    "this bulge in the optical corresponds well to faint extended x - ray emission seen in the _ rosat _ image .",
    "the rim of h@xmath0  emission fades out close to the region in the southeast where the x - ray emission is also faint .",
    "in contrast , the clumpy optical emission is less clearly associated with emission structures in the x - ray image , but appears to lie somewhat near the boundaries of darker ( x - ray faint ) regions in the _ rosat _ image .",

    "the bright h@xmath0  emission near the left of the image was referred to earlier as the `` ne filament complex '' .",
    "the lower part of this emission complex appears about @xmath53 ne of a dark interstellar cloud which appears in the 6510    image as a region lacking in background stars but with a faint continuum emission , presumably due to ambient radiation scattered by dust near the surface of the cloud .",
    "very weak continuum emission is detected extending from the upper ne end of the cloud which appears to end at approximately the southern extent of the ne filament complex s h@xmath0emission .",

    "[ xray_ha ] and [ skyview ] , the ne radiative filament complex appears as a bright green feature near the ne rim of the remnant , with the dark interstellar cloud to its southwest visible as a virtual ` hole ' in the x - ray emission .",

    "since this @xmath59 map is based solely on a star count analysis of data from the digitized sky survey , there can be no confusion with line emission features .",
    "however , once again the interstellar cloud near the ne filament complex and the large triangular region in the sw are seen coincident with high extinction zones in the @xmath59 map , as are the absorbing regions along the remnant s southern limb and the ne  sw stripe along the northern limb .",
    "the observed coincidences between x - ray emission holes and dusty interstellar clouds strongly indicate that the clouds lie in front of the remnant creating x - ray absorption shadows on the resulting x - ray image of the g156 remnant .",
    "in fact , many of the structures seen in the _ rosat _ image can be attributed to absorption by these foreground clouds .",
    "in addition , several radiative optical emission features appear close to these obscuring dust regions , suggesting that g156 may be physically interacting with these clouds leading to the relatively bright radiative shock emission observed .",
    "it should be noted , however , that the arc of patchy emission stretching from near the ne filament complex down toward the sw ridge of h@xmath0 emission does not appear to be associated with dust features in the 6510    optical continuum image , in the 60  @xmath2 m _ iras _ image , or in the @xmath59 extinction map , although it seemingly does run parallel to a stripe of fainter emission in the _ rosat _ x - ray image .",
    "our mosaic h@xmath0 image of g156 ( fig .",
    "1 ) shows a rather surprising amount of optical shock emission for a remnant previously reported to exhibit no detectable optical emission .",
    "g156 s detected optical emission structure now ranks it among the most extensive seen among galactic remnants , albeit at the faint end of surface brightness . the lack of visibility of g156 on the palomar sky survey is not particularly surprising given the broad passband of its images .",
    "nor is it surprising that the snr emission was not detected by @xcite who imaged a region around the bok globule cb 26 close to the northwest filament complex in both h@xmath0 and [ s  ii ] , but were limited by a small ( @xmath65 ) field of view .",

    "only a handful of galactic remnants show such extensive non - radiative , balmer - dominated emission filaments alongside considerable radiative filamentary nebulae .",
    "the few comparable objects include the cygnus loop , with its bright radiative west and east nebulae ( ngc 6960 & 6995 ) and extensive balmer - dominated filaments outlining much of the remnant s limb @xcite , and rcw 86 with its lone but bright radiative emission sw limb region and non - radiative filaments outlining most of the rest of the remnant @xcite .",
    "the mixture of both radiative and non - radiative optical emission suggests that the remnant is situated in a highly non - homogenous ism , with the radiative emission associated with relatively dense cloud  snr interactions while the thin non - radiative filaments mark regions of much lower interstellar density .",
    "however , @xcite reported no spectral variations in four equally spaced sectors of the remnant , concluding that there was no significant variation in interstellar absorption across g156 .",
    "they did find a range of n(h ) column density of @xmath67 to @xmath68 @xmath12 depending on the choice of model assumed , and chose the lower value in their final analysis . @xcite estimated n(h ) = @xmath69 @xmath12 using nei plus thermal or power law models .",
    "neither study discussed the possibility of n(h ) variations , and yet the presence of these large interstellar clouds along the line of sight clearly indicates that the foreground column density varies significantly across the face of the remnant .",
    "this complicates the assessment of the x - ray results , as the foreground density is position dependent on scales smaller than the effective apertures used in these studies . a re - analysis of the _ rosat _ data is certainly warranted , using emission primarily from the relatively unobscured east side of the remnant .    the projected proximity and apparent alignment of the remnant s brighter radiative filaments with several foreground interstellar clouds and dust lanes hint at a possible physically interaction between the g156.2 + 5.7 remnant and these interstellar clouds",
    "the estimated distance to the t - tauri star v347 aur associated with one of the southwestern foreground clouds is 250  300 pc @xcite , while the estimated distance to the bok globule cb @xmath70 near the remnant s bright northwest filament complex ranges from 140 to 300 pc @xcite .",
    "if g156 is indeed interacting with part of the taurus ",
    "auriga cloud complex in this direction , then the g156 remnant may be only @xmath71 0.3 kpc distant , significantly closer than the previous x - ray derived estimates of 1.3  3 kpc .",
    "it would also be much younger than the 15,000  26,000 yr ages earlier analyses have suggested .",
    "in fact , assuming g156 is in the sedov - taylor ( adiabatic ) expansion phase of its evolution , lies at a distance of just 0.3 kpc , is expanding in an intercloud density of 0.2 @xmath14 @xcite , and was generated by a sn with energy around the canonical value of of @xmath72 erg , then it has a radius of @xmath71 5 pc , an age of @xmath71 400 yr , and a shock velocity around 5000 km s@xmath13 .",
    "such a young age seems highly unlikely , as it should then have been seen as a historical supernova .",
    "this extreme age problem is reduced somewhat if either the distance to the clouds is somewhat farther , or the ambient ism density is higher .",
    "for example , at a distance of 0.6 kpc , a sedov analysis of g156 would give an age of @xmath71 2200 yr , and a shock velocity around 1500 km s@xmath13 .",
    "such an age would make g156 more akin to the sn  1006 snr than the cygnus loop .",
    "its nearly filled x - ray morphology is certainly unlike that seen in moderately old snrs and an age of only a few thousand years would be more consistent with the observed presence of extensive non - radiative shock filaments which are most often seen associated with high - velocity shocks in young remnants .",
    "a relatively youthful remnant might also help explain the apparent enhanced abundances of si and s seen in the x - ray spectra of the centre of g156 @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , the close apparent placement of the foreground clouds and the radiative emission could be simply a coincidence .",
    "obviously , further investigations into the distance and general properties of this snr are needed .",
    "for example ,",
    "if its shock velocity is @xmath3 1000  2000 km s@xmath13 , then high resolution spectra of its balmer dominated filaments should show evidence for a broad h@xmath0 emission component like that seen in the filaments in tycho and sn  1006 . moreover , these balmer dominated filaments should exhibit large proper motions of order 1 arsec yr@xmath13 .",
    "even null results would provide useful lower limits to the distance to g156 , and hence lower limits on the age of the snr .",
    "whatever the outcome of future studies , g156 is clearly an interesting remnant , with a now recognized extensive and diverse optical emission structure .",
    "we thank j. thorstensen for help with the optical coordinate matching .",
