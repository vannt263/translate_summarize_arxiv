    "we study the following two - grid mixed finite - element method for the spatial discretization of the above equations .",
    "first , for the solution @xmath9 of the fully nonlinear navier - stokes equations  ( [ onetwo ] ) corresponding to a given initial condition @xmath10 the mixed finite - element approximation  @xmath11 over a coarse mesh of diameter @xmath12 is computed .",
    "then , for any time @xmath13 , the postprocessed approximation @xmath14 is obtained as the mixed finite - element approximation over a finer mesh ( @xmath15 ) to the following steady oseen - type problem : @xmath16 in this paper we prove that , in terms of the fine mesh diameter @xmath17 , this two - grid technique is of optimal order in the sense that , for appropriate choices of the coarse mesh diameter @xmath12 , the method has the same rate of convergence of standard mixed finite element approximations in the fine mesh . on the other hand , for a suitable value of the discretization parameter @xmath17 , the rate of convergence of the postprocessed approximation in terms of @xmath12 increases by one unit the rate of convergence of the coarse standard approximation .",
    "the improvement in precision is achieved in both the @xmath18 norm for the velocity and the @xmath19 norm for the pressure in the case of linear , quadratic and cubic elements . for other than linear elements the rate of convergence in the @xmath19 norm of the velocity",
    "is also increased by one unit .",
    "we remark that time evolution is performed only at the coarse mesh whereas at the fine grid the time appears only as a parameter ( see equation ( [ eq : oseen ] ) ) , thus the name of static two - grid method .",
    "two - grid or two - level methods are a well established technique for nonlinear steady problems , see  @xcite . in  @xcite ,",
    "@xcite several two - level methods are considered to approximate the steady navier - stokes equations .",
    "they require solving a nonlinear system over a coarse mesh and , depending on the algorithm chosen , one stokes problem , one linear oseen problem or one newton step over the fine mesh .",
    "the corresponding algorithms obtain the optimal rate of convergence in the fine mesh for appropriate choices of the coarse mesh diameter @xmath12 .    in the case of nonlinear evolutionary equations ,",
    "two - grid techniques have been proposed and studied in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite . in these methods , as opposed to the method studied in the present paper , time evolution is also performed over the fine mesh .",
    "the advantage of the method studied in the present paper is that since the time integration is only carried out on the coarse mesh , computations on the fine grid can be done at selected target time levels where an improved approximation is desired , with the corresponding reduction of computing time , specially if these target time levels are sufficiently spaced in time . for this reason , although some of the two - grid methods that incorporate the evolution in time of the fine mesh approximation are more accurate , the method we present can still be more efficient in terms of computational effort for a given error level .",
    "two - grid techniques that integrate in time only on the coarse level have previously been developed in @xcite , @xcite ( see also @xcite ) for spectral methods , and later extended to mixed finite - element formulations in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite . in all",
    "these works the two grid method is referred to as postprocessed galerkin method , and , instead of  ( [ eq : oseen ] ) , the approximation  @xmath14 is found as an approximation to the following stokes problem @xmath20 this two - grid method will be termed standard postprocessed method , to differentiate it to that studied in the present paper , which will be termed new postprocessed method .",
    "both , the standard and the new postprocessed methods , have the same rate of convergence .",
    "however , as already noted in  @xcite for nonlinear convection - diffusion problems , the new postprocessing technique produces more accurate approximations than the standard postprocessed method , for moderate to small values of the diffusion parameter @xmath21 .",
    "this will also be the case in the numerical experiments in the present paper for moderate values of the reynolds number .",
    "in the present paper we take into account the loss of regularity suffered by the solutions of the navier - stokes equations at the initial time in the absence of nonlocal compatibility conditions .",
    "thus , for the analysis , we do not assume the solution  @xmath5 to have more than second - order spatial derivatives bounded in @xmath19 up to initial time @xmath22 , since demanding further regularity requires the data to satisfy nonlocal compatibility conditions unlikely to be fulfilled in practical situations @xcite , @xcite .",
    "due to the loss of regularity at @xmath22 , the best error bound that we can obtain is @xmath23 .",
    "for this reason we do not analyze higher than cubic finite elements .",
    "the same limit in the rate of convergence was found in @xcite for standard mixed finite - element approximations and in @xcite , @xcite for two - grid schemes .    in practice ,",
    "any method to numerically solve evolutionary equations needs of some time discretization procedure .",
    "for brevity reasons , we have preferred to present the method in a semidiscrete manner without reference to any particular time discretization .",
    "however , we emphasize that being static , the method we present can be applied exactly in the same form , with any time discretization . the analysis of fully discrete procedures can be developed along the same lines that appear in @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the rest of the paper is as follows . in section 2",
    "we introduce some preliminaries and notation . in section 3",
    "we carry out the error analysis of the new method .",

    "we can observe on the left of figure  [ semi ] that , in agreement with the theory , the postprocessed method using the mini - element does not increase the rate of convergence in the @xmath19 norm of the velocity although the size of the errors are reduced . in the @xmath18 norm , however , also as predicted by the theory , the postprocessed method does increase the order of convergence by one unit ( indeed , the errors of the postprocessed method in the @xmath18 norm are slightly smaller than those of the galerkin method in the @xmath19 norm ) .",
    "the same improvement is observed for the @xmath19 errors of the pressure on the right of figure  [ semi ] .",
    "this means that we can obtain the level of error corresponding to the fine mesh at essentially the cost of the computation in the coarse mesh because the computation on the fine mesh is performed only once at time @xmath262 .",
    "then , the dominant computational cost is caused by the time evolution in the coarse mesh saving time when compared with the time evolution in the fine mesh that is needed in a standard approach .                in the next experiment",
    "we will show that the new postprocessed method produces better results than both the galerkin method and the standard postprocessed method  ( [ eq : stokes ] ) .",
    "we consider now equations ( [ onetwo ] ) with initial condition @xmath270 and forcing term @xmath271 . we take first @xmath272 . in figure  [ gal1 ]",
    "we have represented the linear part of the first component of the velocity for the galerkin method with @xmath256 at time @xmath273 . in figure  [ pos1 ]",
    "we show the standard postprocessed approximation with @xmath256 and @xmath269 . we can observe that the standard postprocessing introduces some oscillations that were not present in the galerkin approximation .",
    "these oscillations are not reduced with a smaller value of @xmath17 .",
    "finally , in figure  [ posnew1 ] we have represented the linear part of the first component of the velocity for the new postprocessed approximation and the same values of coarse and fine mesh sizes , @xmath256 and @xmath269 .",
    "we observe that this approximation does not oscillate at all and it improves the accuracy of both galerkin and standard postprocessed approximations .",
    "in the last experiment we repeat the experiment with a smaller value of the diffusion parameter , @xmath274 , and the same values of @xmath12 and @xmath17 as that of the previous experiment . as it was already observed in the case of convection - diffusion equations  @xcite the behavior of the standard postprocessed method deteriorates as the diffusion parameter decreases .",
    "we can observe that both the galerkin and the new postprocessed approximations , see figures  [ gal2 ] and [ posnew2 ] respectively , do not present oscillations .",
    "as before , we can also observe the smoothing effect achieved by postprocessing with the new method proposed in this paper .",
    "on the other hand , the standard postprocessed method produces a completely wrong approximation , see figure  [ pos2 ] .",
    "let us remark that , as it has been noted before in the literature , see @xcite , @xcite , the bubble functions used in the mini - element to generate a stable mixed finite - element satisfying the inf - sup condition ( [ lbbh ] ) have also a slightly stabilizing ( over - diffusive ) effect for moderate values of the reynolds number .",
    "this fact explains the non - oscillating behavior of the linear part of the approximation to the velocity in the galerkin method of figure  [ gal2 ] we can also observe , see figure  [ posnew2 ] , that the over - diffusive effect appearing in the galerkin approximation of figure  [ gal2 ] is attenuated by postprocessing with the new method .",
