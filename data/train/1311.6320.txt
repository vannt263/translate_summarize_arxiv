    "starting with the paper @xcite , it has been shown that a wide class of pt symmetric non - hermitian hamilton operators provides entirely real spectra . in the following years",
    "this phenomenon is studied in many theoretical papers , see the review @xcite and the special issue @xcite .    in order to realize complex pt symmetric structures ,",
    "the formal equivalence of the quantum mechanical schrdinger equation to the optical wave equation in pt symmetric optical lattices @xcite can be exploited by involving symmetric index guiding and an antisymmetric gain / loss profile .",
    "the experimental results @xcite have confirmed the expectations and have , furthermore , demonstrated the onset of passive pt symmetry breaking within the context of optics .",
    "this phase transition was found to lead to a loss - induced optical transparency in specially designed pseudo - hermitian potentials . in another experiment @xcite ,",
    "the wave propagation in an active pt symmetric coupled waveguide system is studied .",
    "both spontaneous pt symmetry breaking and power oscillations violating left - right symmetry are observed .",
    "moreover , the relation of the relative phases of the eigenstates of the system to their distance from the level crossing point is obtained .",
    "the phase transition occurs when this point is approached .",
    "the meaning of these results for a new generation of integrated photonic devices is discussed in @xcite .",
    "today we have many experimental and theoretical studies related to this topic .",
    "on the other hand , non - hermitian operators are known to describe open quantum systems in a natural manner , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the original papers more than 50 years ago , statistical assumptions on the system s states are not at all necessary today @xcite due to the improved accuracy of the experimental as well as theoretical studies . in the present - day papers ,",
    "the system is assumed to be open due to the fact that it is embedded into the continuum of scattering wavefunctions into which the states of the system can decay .",
    "this environment exists always .",
    "it can be changed by means of external forces , but can not be deleted @xcite .",
    "the states of the system can decay due to their coupling to the environment of scattering wavefunctions but can not be formed out of the continuum .",
    "hence , loss is nonvanishing usually , while gain is zero .",
    "the complex eigenvalues of the non - hermitian hamiltonian provide both the energy @xmath1 as well as the lifetime @xmath2 ( inverse proportional to the decay width @xmath3 ) of the eigenstate @xmath4 .",
    "recent studies have shown the important role singular points in the continuum play for the dynamics of open quantum systems , see e.g. the review @xcite .",
    "these singular points are called usually exceptional points ( eps ) after kato who studied their mathematical properties @xcite many years ago .",
    "the relation of eps to pt symmetry breaking in optical systems is considered already in the first papers @xcite . nevertheless , the relation between the dynamical properties of open quantum systems and those of pt symmetric systems is not considered thoroughly up to now .",
    "it is the aim of the present paper to compare directly the influence of eps onto the dynamics of open quantum systems with that onto pt symmetry breaking in pt symmetric systems .",
    "the comparison is performed on the basis of simple models with only two levels coupled to one common channel . in both cases ,",

    "the similarities and differences to the hamiltonian of an open quantum system are discussed on the basis of analytical studies ( when possible ) as well as by means of numerical results .",
    "the results are summarized in the last section .",
    "in an open quantum system , the discrete states described by a hermitian hamiltonian @xmath5 , are embedded into the continuum of scattering wavefunctions , which exists always and can not be deleted . due to this fact the discrete states turn into resonance",

    "the so - called internal ( first - order ) interaction between two states @xmath4 and @xmath11 is involved in @xmath5 while their external ( second - order ) interaction via the common environment is described by the last term of ( [ ham1 ] ) .",
    "generally , the coupling matrix elements of the external interaction consist of the principal value integral @xmath12 which is real , and the residuum @xmath13 which is imaginary @xcite . here",
    ", the @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the eigenfunctions and ( discrete ) eigenvalues , respectively , of the hermitian hamiltonian @xmath5 which describes the states in the subspace of discrete states without any interaction of the states via the environment .",

    "the eigenvalues @xmath52 differ from the original values @xmath53 by a contribution to the energies and in the second case by a contribution to the widths .",
    "the width bifurcation starts in the very neighborhood of one of the eps and becomes maximum in the middle between the two eps .",
    "this happens at the crossing point @xmath54 where @xmath55 .",
    "a similar situation appears when @xmath56 as results of numerical calculations show .",
    "the physical meaning of this result is completely different from that discussed above for discrete and narrow resonance states .",

    "the schrdinger equation ( [ form1a ] ) with source term can be rewritten in the following manner @xcite , @xmath84 ) and ( [ int5 ] ) of the eigenfunctions of @xmath32 , ( [ form2a ] ) is a nonlinear equation .",

    "thus , the modes involved in the non - hermitian hamiltonian in optics appear in complex conjugate pairs while this is not the case in an open quantum system . as a consequence , the hamiltonian for @xmath112 symmetric structures in optical lattices may have real eigenvalues in a large parameter range .",

    "<S> exceptional points ( eps ) determine the dynamics of open quantum systems and cause also pt symmetry breaking in pt symmetric systems . from a mathematical point of view , this is caused by the fact that the phases of the wavefunctions ( eigenfunctions of a non - hermitian hamiltonian ) relative to one another are not rigid when an ep is approached . </S>",
    "<S> the system is therefore able to align with the environment to which it is coupled and , consequently , rigorous changes of the system properties may occur . </S>",
    "<S> we compare analytically as well as numerically the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of a @xmath0 matrix that is characteristic of either open quantum systems at high level density or of pt symmetric optical lattices . in both cases , </S>",
