    "in studies of spin - dependent structure functions of nucleons and nuclei with real and virtual photons , the verification of the gerasimov  drell  hearn sum rule",
    "( gdh ) @xcite is of special interest @xcite .",
    "apart from general principles as gauge and lorentz invariance , unitarity , analyticity , and crossing symmetry , this sum rule is based on the assumption that the forward compton scattering becomes spin independent at high energies .",
    "therefore , the gdh provides an excellent test of the spin dynamics of the nucleon .    in the lab frame ,",
    "the amplitude for forward compton scattering off a spin-1/2 target is described by two even functions @xmath6 of the initial - photon energy @xmath7 , [ f - forward ] f = f_1 ( ) + if_2 ( ) , which , at @xmath8 , are constrained by the low - energy theorems @xcite : [ let ] f_1(0 ) = - , f_2(0 ) = -",
    ". here , @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and @xmath11 are the mass , electric charge , and anomalous magnetic moment of the target , respectively , and @xmath12 . within the framework of the regge pole model @xcite ,",
    "these functions behave like f_1 ( ) ^_r(0 ) , f_2 ( ) ^_r(0)-1 , where @xmath13 is the intercept of the leading @xmath14-channel regge exchange contributing to the amplitudes . with the usual assumption of @xmath15 ,",
    "both @xmath1 and @xmath2 satisfy _ once_-subtracted dispersion relations .",
    "the optical theorem allows one to express the imaginary parts of these amplitudes in terms of the total photoabsorption cross sections @xmath16 and @xmath17 , where the subscripts refer to total helicities 1/2 and 3/2 , respectively , [ unitarity ] f_1=(_1/2+_3/2 ) = _ tot , f_2=(_1/2-_3/2 ) .",
    "therefore , we may write dispersion relations for @xmath1 and @xmath2 , [ dr - f1 ] f_1 ( ) = - + _ _ thr^ d , [ dr - f2 ] f_2 ( ) = - + _ _ thr^ . the gdh , [ gdh ] _ _ thr^ ( _ 3/2()-_1/2 ( ) ) = , arises from eq .",

    "the gdh for @xmath21 seems to work very successfully , supporting the conjecture that the leading isoscalar regge exchange ( pomeron ) is decoupled from the spin - dependent transitions .",
    "it is very surprising , however , that the gdh for @xmath22 seems to be violated , despite the fact that all known isovector exchanges ( such as the @xmath23 and @xmath24 mesons ) have an intercept @xmath25 which supports the assumption of @xmath26 for @xmath19 .",

    "such a huge difference would be a great surprise , because the total cross section is @xmath33 @xmath28b at these energies .",
    "we can think of two options to explain the discrepancy .    1 .",
    "the gdh for @xmath22 is not valid , and we have the first experimentally established example that the high - energy behavior of a photon scattering amplitude is determined by the so - called fixed pole ( @xmath34 ) in the complex plane of the angular momentum @xcite rather than known regge exchanges with smaller intercepts @xmath13 . in particular , this would violate the assumption of vector meson dominance in high - energy compton scattering since fixed poles are forbidden in vector meson photoproduction @xcite . some arguments against the fixed pole",
    "are discussed in @xcite .",
    "the existing experimental information on the spin and isospin dependence of photoabsorption is not accurate enough .",
    "an alternative experiment to clarify the nature of the discrepancy would be to measure the amplitude @xmath35 , eq .",

    "( [ dr - f2 ] ) . in the present paper",
    "we propose an alternative method to determine both @xmath38 and @xmath36 by measuring the photoproduction of small - angle @xmath0 pairs which serve as a polarimeter of the virtual photon in the subprocess [ subprocess ] n ^ * n. since the conversion factor of the virtual photon into the @xmath0 pairs is small ( @xmath40 ) , this contribution will be strongly suppressed compared with a huge background of bethe - heitler ( bh ) pair production .",
    "however , the interference between the bethe - heitler amplitude and the amplitude of virtual compton scattering ( vcs ) leads to a specific azimuthal asymmetry between yields of positrons and electrons which could be studied with polarized photons and targets .",

(",

    "( [ tbh ] ) , the interference of @xmath78 and @xmath101 is dominated by the no - spin - flip terms in @xmath102 and @xmath103 . due to angular momentum conservation in the transition @xmath104 , the no - spin - flip part of @xmath102 has to vanish like @xmath64 for small angles . as a toy model",
    ", we may consider compton scattering through e1-excitation followed by the decay of a resonance with the quantum numbers of the @xmath105 .",
    "the corresponding amplitude @xmath106 is proportional to [ d13model ] ^s^+ s = 23 - i3 = , where @xmath107 is the transition spin operator ( see , e.g.  @xcite ) and @xmath108 is the nucleon spin operator , which can be replaced by @xmath109 for no - spin - flip transitions .",
    "accordingly , in such transitions the amplitude @xmath110 is proportional to @xmath111 , and the l / t ratio reads [ l / t ] = 12  . to be more accurate , we should do this calculation in the rest frame of the resonance rather than in the lab frame .",
    "however , such a calculation does not change too much the estimate ( [ l / t ] ) .    using the relationship",
    "d^2 ( x_1 x_2)^-1 w^2 , valid at high energies and small angles , we finally conclude that the longitudinal contribution of @xmath102 to eq .",
    "( [ m*l ] ) is smaller than the contribution of @xmath112 by a factor @xmath113 , which is typically @xmath114 in the kinematics of eq .",

    "it is worth noting that the longitudinal contribution in eq .",
    "( [ m*l ] ) does not depend on the azimuthal direction of the vector @xmath115 , and its interference with @xmath78 does not contribute to azimuthal variations of positron and electron yields .",
    "the longitudinal contribution leads only to a small change of the cross sections and asymmetries .",
    "\\(ii ) another consequence of the virtuality of the photon @xmath116 in the subprocess ( [ subprocess ] ) is the presence of additional form factors at the photon - baryon vertices .",
    "we may expect that such form factors would increase the amplitude @xmath101 by a factor @xmath117 which is @xmath114 for the kinematics considered .",
    "\\(iii ) in the general case of @xmath92 , the amplitude for real compton scattering is characterized by 6 independent functions @xmath118 . even for no - spin - flip transitions we still have 4 different amplitudes ( see appendix  a )",

    "the other two , @xmath119 and @xmath120 , vanish at @xmath121 and describe photon scattering involving a helicity flip .",

    "( [ d13model ] ) suggests that the angular dependence of @xmath1 and @xmath2 follows @xmath124 , such that the @xmath125-corrections are roughly of the scale @xmath126 .",
    "however , already at energies of 1 gev many higher multipoles contribute and the realistic angular dependence is steeper . in terms of the invariant momentum transfer @xmath73 , the slope @xmath127 of the amplitude @xmath128 at high energies should be close to the diffractive slope of the differential cross section @xmath129 of compton scattering @xcite .",
    "thus the decrease of @xmath1 at @xmath130 mev is @xmath131 .",
    "nothing definite is known for @xmath132 and for the flip amplitudes @xmath119 and @xmath120 . from dispersion calculations of the amplitudes",

    "for the amplitude @xmath2 the decrease is equal to 0.6% and 5.2% , respectively . at @xmath136",
    "the helicity - flip amplitudes are very small , @xmath137 and @xmath138 .",
    "we conclude that even for a momentum transfer @xmath54 of 100 mev the compton scattering amplitude is not modified by more than @xmath139 , at least at @xmath134 gev .",
    "eventually , we evaluate the amplitude @xmath101 by keeping only the term @xmath140 in eq .",

    "generally , the vcs amplitude , eq .",
