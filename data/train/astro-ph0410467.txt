    "galaxy groups and clusters appear in many guises .",
    "observationally , they can be identified as pools of x - ray emitting gas , collections of galaxies , sunyaev - zeldovich decrements of the cmb , or strong features in the gravitational shear field .",
    "theoretically , they are identified as the largest over - dense ` halos ' of dark matter .",
    "mass is the key defining attribute of a galaxy cluster .",
    "the evolution of the cluster mass function and its variance plays an important role in constraining cosmological parameters describing dark energy , such as @xmath3  and @xmath4  ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and large - scale structure , such as @xmath5  and @xmath6 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "mass estimates and studies of cluster members both rely upon knowing the size of a cluster of given mass . to define the mass of a cluster ,",
    "typically a cluster radius is specified through some prescription , and the total mass taken to be the mass contained within that radius .",
    "various operational definitions are used to determine cluster size and mass , but all of these show a regular increase in cluster size with mass . in order to study objects in a wide range of masses in a meaningful way",
    ", we must be able to determine an appropriate size scale for these clusters and groups ; we may then use this characteristic scale as an aperture within which to make comparisons .    in numerical simulations , the precision of cluster mass and size measurements is limited only by resolution .",
    "still , there are a variety of definitions for both size and mass in use , as discussed in some detail by @xcite .",
    "one class of estimates is based on top - hat filtered spherical over - densities . in this model",
    ", clusters are expected to be virialized within regions where the enclosed mean mass density exceeds the critical density by a factor @xmath7 200 @xcite .",
    "the radius at which this over - density is reached , @xmath8 , is used as the characteristic radius of the cluster .",
    "the total mass within this radius , @xmath9 , is used as the characteristic mass .",
    "a number of choices of @xmath10 are in use in the literature , from an overdensity of 180 times the mean background ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , 200 times the critical density , i.e. 200@xmath11 times the mean background ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "* ) , to the `` virial mass '' @xcite .",
    "alternative definitions identify halos by ` friends - of - friends ' ( fof ) methods @xcite . in these methods ,",
    "particles are associated with halos to which they are linked by sequences of neighboring particles .",
    "masses for fof halos are often given by the sum of member particle masses , but as the halos are not required to be spherical , halo size is less clearly defined .",
    "observationally , cluster mass and size are difficult to measure directly ; typically some mass estimator is adopted as a proxy , and typically a mass model is assumed to calculate the virial size . with deep observations , lensing may be used to make detailed mass maps of rich clusters , but this is not yet a practical technique for a large sample of systems spanning a wide range of masses . with large , shallower surveys ,",
    "the lensing signals from a set of lens systems can be stacked to determine a composite mass profile @xcite . however",
    ", the large number of lens systems needed for high signal to noise makes such a measurement difficult for examining narrow mass ranges . while examining the lensing signal from an individual cluster recovers a specific mass ,",
    "that estimate is affected by the errors , such as those due to projection effects , in modeling the mass .",
    "combining the lensing signal from many clusters is advantageous because projection effects are unimportant , and the stacking simplifies modeling of neighboring structures .",
    "while stacking does limit the resolution in mass for a large set of clusters , this limitation is due to the amount of data available rather than the technique used .",
    "other observational techniques for estimating mass , whether using x - ray temperature , sz flux , or velocity dispersion as a mass estimator , also rely upon either expensive spectroscopy to gain a detailed understanding of a few rich systems , or upon models for the mass distribution used to infer the total system mass and size . to compare observational data to theoretical models , and to compare the observed properties of clusters of different masses , it would be preferable to avoid using a model - dependent mass / radius scaling .    with a large photometric optical survey it is now possible to use cluster richness to characterize galaxy systems without suffering from the projection effects that have plagued such a mass estimator in the past .",
    "since the cluster catalog of @xcite , systems of galaxies have been sorted and compared using a variety of richness parameters , many of which have been based on the number of galaxies within a certain luminosity range and distance from the estimated cluster center .",
    "the richness parameters of @xcite are of this type ; see @xcite for further discussion and comparison of some of these richness estimators .",
    "we can stack systems in narrow richness bins , and measure directly the distribution of galaxies in clusters over a wide range of masses .",
    "this galaxy distribution is used to estimate the virial size of these systems .",
    "ideally , cluster members would be identified spectroscopically .",
    "such data is not feasible to obtain for a very large sample of clusters , so we rely upon projected photometric data taken in multiple bandpasses , and correct for the foreground and background galaxies that contaminate our line of sight to each cluster .",
    "the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) data offer thousands of clusters and groups for study , and can be used to measure excellent photometric redshifts for those objects .",
    "we use data from the sdss to directly determine a size - richness relation for groups and clusters with a model - independent method . since we can not directly measure the radius at which the cluster has a mass over - density of @xmath12 , we instead determine the radius @xmath13 at which the space density of cluster galaxies , @xmath14 , is over - dense by @xmath15@xmath14 .",
    "we present the scaling of @xmath16  with richness , which can be employed to further study galaxy clusters and their members .",
    "for example , to study the relationship between different mass estimators , such as the mass from lensing measurements and the total luminosity of the cluster , it is essential to know this scaling of cluster size with richness .",
    "if the distribution of galaxies in a halo traces the overall dark matter distribution , our galaxy - density based @xmath16  will reflect the characteristic radius of clusters . in detail , the relation between the dark matter density profile and the radial distribution of a population of galaxies depends on a number of physical processes including dynamical friction and tidal striping , and depends on the properties of the galaxy sample , but both simulations and previous observational work suggest that the distribution of galaxies in a halo at least roughly traces the overall dark matter distribution ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this hypothesis is supported by recent lensing and galaxy clustering measurements @xcite , which suggest that the bias of typical sdss galaxies is approximately one and is roughly scale - independent on scales larger than a few hundred @xmath17 kpc . in any case , without assuming a model for the radial distribution of galaxies in clusters , we can directly measure the radius at which the galaxy density in clusters is @xmath10 times more dense than the average background .",
    "our investigation does not distinguish between galaxy groups and clusters .",
    "systems of galaxies come in a range of masses from single galaxies in larger halos up to the most massive of clusters .",
    "there is a clear boundary between galaxies and systems of galaxies ; there is not any clear dividing point between poor and rich systems of galaxies as observed in the optical .",
    "we use the full range of our cluster finder to develop our catalog of systems ; our mass estimator spans the range from highly populated clusters down to very sparse systems , and we refer to any system with two or more galaxies as a `` cluster '' .",
    "there is no strong break in the properties of the systems found as a function of richness .    in  [ data ]",
    "we describe the sdss data used and discuss the cluster finding technique and richness measurement ; in  [ method ] we present and test our method of background subtraction through examination of the radial profile and luminosity function .",
    "our calculation of @xmath16  as a function of richness is presented in  [ r200 ] .",

    "[ rpr200 ] ; we examine the luminosity function within @xmath16  and how the luminosity function changes as a function of @xmath18/@xmath16  for clusters of different richnesses in  [ lfr200 ] . throughout , we assume a flat , lcdm cosmology with h@xmath19 km s@xmath20 mpc@xmath20 , @xmath21 , and matter density @xmath22 .",
    "in this study , we use 395 deg@xmath23 of sdss commissioning data @xcite , a subset of the early data release data .",
    "in particular , we use the 170 contiguous square degrees imaged september 19 and 25 1998 , covering the range 145.1  @xmath24 ra @xmath24 236.0 , -1.25  @xmath24 dec @xmath24 + 1.25  ( j2000 ) , known as sdss stripe 10 , and the 225 contiguous square degrees imaged march 20 - 21 1999 , covering the range 351  @xmath24 ra @xmath24 56 , -1.25",

    "all apparent magnitudes are measured by the photometric data processing pipeline using a modified version of the @xcite system ( see @xcite for a discussion of the advantages of petrosian magnitudes ) , and are corrected for galactic extinction using the dust maps of @xcite .",
    "further details about the photometric data and the parameters measured may be found in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "clusters used in this study are detected by the maxbcg algorithm .",
    "this method relies on the observation that clusters host a population of early - type galaxies that have small dispersion in color @xcite .",
    "these cluster members populate the red sequence on a color - magnitude diagram .",
    "the brightest cluster galaxies ( bcgs ) have colors that are compatible with the red sequence galaxies @xcite , and also have a very small dispersion in luminosity @xcite .",
    "there is evidence that the colors and magnitudes of bcgs remain predictable ( and thus indicative of redshift ) until at least @xmath27  = 0.6 @xcite , shifting only due to passive evolution .",
    "the maxbcg algorithm takes advantage of these observed properties to find bcgs and the galaxies that are associated with them . for every galaxy ,",
    "the algorithm calculates the highest likelihood , @xmath28 , that any given galaxy is a bcg ( which means the galaxy has the properties of a bcg plus has a red sequence around it ) , and then identifies clusters by finding galaxies with high @xmath28  values compared to the surroundings .",
    "@xmath28  for each galaxy is determined by finding the maximum of @xmath29@xmath30 , the calculated likelihood as a function of redshift for the candidate .",
    "the likelihood function @xmath29@xmath30  is the sum of two terms , and is calculated at every redshift from @xmath27  = 0.0 to @xmath27  = 0.6 in steps of 0.01 .",
    "that is , for each galaxy we calculate    @xmath31    the first term , @xmath32 , is the bcg likelihood : the likelihood that the galaxy in question is consistent with , compared to the known population dispersions , the apparent magnitudes and colors of the mean bcg population as seen at that redshift .",
    "these colors and magnitudes were derived from the properties of abell clusters observed by the sdss . the second term , @xmath33  n@xmath34 , is the log of the count of the other galaxies in the vicinity that are also of the right color and magnitude to be cluster members . to count the number of galaxies ,",
    "we examine only those projected within 1@xmath17 mpc ( at the redshift in question ) that fall in the red sequence for each redshift .",
    "a galaxy is within the red sequence if it is within 2@xmath35 ( @xmath36 mags ) of the mean bcg color at that redshift , fainter than the bcg candidate , and brighter than @xmath37 = -20.25 ( approximately 0.5 l@xmath38 ) .",

    "the region of inclusion for n@xmath34  determination shown by the contours ; the color and apparent luminosity of a passively - evolving bcg as a function of redshift is indicated by a dotted track .",
    "the interplay between finding a galaxy with the right color and luminosity to be a bcg and a galaxy with red sequence neighbors determines the redshift distribution of @xmath29@xmath30 .",
    "we find the redshift that maximizes @xmath29@xmath30   for the galaxy in question .",
    "that galaxy is assigned @xmath28  and the corresponding redshift . at the end of this process each galaxy in the catalog",
    "has a single maximum likelihood and a single redshift .",
    "we then need to select the cluster centers out of the catalog of all galaxies .",
    "we find the peaks in the distribution of @xmath28  over all galaxies ; these peaks are the clusters . for each candidate bcg",
    ", we check whether its likelihood @xmath28  is the highest likelihood when compared with neighboring candidates within @xmath39 that are projected within 1@xmath17 mpc of the bcg candidate in question .",
    "if the candidate bcg s @xmath28  is the greatest of those neighbors , we list the candidate in the cluster catalog as a bcg .",
    "the cluster catalog produced contains information about each cluster identified , including the photometric properties of the bcg , the estimated redshift and the richness , n@xmath34 .",
    "each cluster center is taken to be at the location of its bcg .",
    "the richness measurement for the cluster , n@xmath34 , is defined to be the number of galaxies in the red sequence at the derived redshift .",
    "the resulting catalog contains objects over a wide range of richnesses : from quite poor systems of only a few galaxies ( n@xmath34  @xmath24 8 ; @xmath40 @xmath41 300 km s@xmath20 ; 10,560 systems in 0.07 @xmath42 0.3 ) to very massive clusters of hundreds of galaxies ( n@xmath34  @xmath43 30 ; @xmath44 700 km s@xmath20 ; 19 systems in 0.07 @xmath42 0.3 ) .",
    "figure [ distrib ] shows the distribution of identified objects as a function of redshift and of richness . so as to avoid making an arbitrary distinction between a group and a cluster",
    ", we will generically refer to a system of galaxies as a cluster , and specify the value of n@xmath34  of that system .",
    "the maxbcg algorithm has been tested extensively for completeness and purity .",
    "all previously known abell and noras x - ray clusters in the region surveyed are recovered .",
    "simulations suggest that maxbcg recovers and correctly estimates the richness for greater than 90% of clusters and groups present with n@xmath34  @xmath43 15 out to a redshift of @xmath27  = 0.3 .",
    "the completeness and selection function of the algorithm will be further explored in @xcite .",
    "the clusters identified by this algorithm have been compared with the objects found by different cluster - finding algorithms run on the same dataset .",
    "discussion of the differences between maxbcg and other algorithms can be found in @xcite .",
    "one of the strengths of this algorithm is that it is a robust photometric redshift estimator for the clusters : for the 6708 clusters in the catalog with spectroscopic redshifts available , the dispersion between the maxbcg estimated redshift and the spectroscopic redshifts is @xmath45 , as seen in figure [ zcomp ] , and is smaller for the highest richness clusters .",
    "these 6708 systems span the range of n@xmath34  in the catalog .",
    "as we do not have spectroscopic redshifts for all clusters examined , but are confident in relying upon these estimates , we will henceforth use the term redshift to mean the estimated photometric redshift determined by maxbcg .",
    "given a set of cluster centers with well - defined three - dimensional positions , we need to find the galaxies associated with those clusters .",
    "this section explains how we apply background subtraction techniques to the sdss data , and how we check our method by constructing and examining the radial density profile and the luminosity function .",
    "generically , any properties of galaxies in clusters can be described by some population distribution function ( pdf ) in a multi - dimensional parameter space .",
    "properties of each galaxy such as luminosity , color , star formation rate , mass , and distance from the cluster center may be used as the parameters of a pdf .",
    "examining how the galaxies of a particular cluster occupy the parameter space is a way to sample the pdf ; with a large enough set of cluster galaxies , we may statistically determine the pdf quite well .",
    "the overall properties of the clusters ( e.g. cluster mass or x - ray temperature ) may be used to identify different sets of clusters , and the pdfs of galaxies in these different cluster samples compared . in this way",
    ", we can explore how the properties of galaxies in clusters are related to the characteristics of the host clusters .    without redshifts for all galaxies",
    ", we can only examine the pdf of galaxies associated with clusters by making an appropriate correction for the set of field galaxies projected by chance along the line of sight to the clusters .",
    "we assume the presence of a cluster at some redshift does not affect field galaxies found along the same line of sight .",
    "that is , the pdf of galaxies projected around a cluster center has two independent components : the distribution of real cluster galaxies , and the distribution of random background and foreground galaxies . to determine the projected , azimuthally averaged pdf of just the galaxies associated with clusters ( the pdf@xmath46 ) , we examine the pdf of all galaxies projected around cluster centers ( the pdf@xmath47 ) and the pdf of all galaxies projected around a set of random ( field ) points on the sky ( the pdf@xmath48 ) .",
    "the pdf@xmath46 is determined by subtracting : pdf@xmath46 = pdf@xmath47 - pdf@xmath48 .",
    "although we can not identify exactly which galaxies make up a particular cluster , we can very accurately describe the mean properties of galaxies associated with a set of clusters .",
    "there are a variety of ways in the literature for measuring the contribution of non - cluster members without having spectroscopic information .",
    "historically , the population of field galaxies was estimated from number - flux counts in separate surveys ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , although this method has the disadvantage of not having the cluster and field samples measured in the same set of data .",
    "more recently , some authors @xcite have measured the background in an annulus centered on the cluster , in order to ensure that the background measurement is made using data of similar depth and seeing as the data in the region of the cluster .",
    "other authors , such as @xcite estimated the background from a nearby control field , or from the @xmath49 relationship from the same dataset from which the cluster sample is drawn @xcite .",
    "@xcite subtracted interlopers on the basis of color information , removing `` galaxies with colors not matching the expected ones at the cluster redshift . '' as galaxy surveys increase in area , it becomes feasible to measure the background counts directly from the general field , as done by @xcite .",
    "the sdss data offer large regions of sky measured to the same depth and with the same seeing , so we are able to determine the contribution of field galaxies in the same data as the clusters without artificially restricting the field measurement to the cluster neighborhood , or making assumptions about the color or luminosity distribution of cluster members . by using a set of random points as the locations around which the field galaxy population is determined , we measure the characteristics of all galaxies that are associated with clusters .",
    "the sdss is an ideal dataset with which to examine the pdf of cluster galaxies because it provides sky coverage for a large number of clusters and ample blank sky for measuring the field distribution .",
    "the sdss data offer a rich parameter space with which to define the pdf .",
    "properties such as luminosity , color , star formation rate , and morphology may all be explored . in this work , for @xmath25- , @xmath18- , @xmath26- and @xmath27-bands ,",
    "we construct and examine the pdf@xmath46(n@xmath34 , @xmath18 , @xmath50 ) : the density function of cluster galaxies per surface area in a three - dimensional space of cluster richness n@xmath34 , projected radius @xmath18 , and absolute magnitude @xmath50 .",
    "the pdf may then be projected onto the axis of absolute magnitude to show the luminosity function of cluster members , or onto the axis of projected radius to show the radial density profile of the cluster . in this section",
    "we describe the samples of galaxies examined , and as the pdf@xmath47 and pdf@xmath48 are constructed in the same manner , discuss the construction of a general pdf(n@xmath34 , @xmath18 , @xmath50 ) .",
    "to measure the pdf@xmath47 , we examine galaxies projected near the 12830 maxbcg objects found in the redshift range 0.07 @xmath42 0.3 .",
    "these systems have richnesses in the range @xmath51  n@xmath34  @xmath52 .",
    "we use all galaxies projected within 2@xmath17 mpc of the cluster centers and in the absolute magnitude range -24 @xmath53 -16 .",
    "we bin the data in 50 @xmath17 kpc radial x 1 n@xmath34  richness x 0.2 absolute magnitude bins .",
    "the number of galaxies in each bin is then normalized by the physical area observed in each bin .",
    "details of the calculations are discussed below .    to determine the pdf@xmath48",
    ", we examine galaxies along lines of sight to randomly chosen field locations . for each cluster , we choose five positions on the same @xmath54 200 deg@xmath23 stripe of sky as the cluster , with random ra and dec .",
    "these field positions are assigned the same redshift as the cluster , and labeled with the richness of that cluster .",
    "the resulting set of 64,150 field points are observed with the same seeing and to the same depth as the clusters , and for any set of clusters there is a set of field positions with the same redshift distribution .",
    "the same radial and magnitude ranges and bin widths used for the pdf@xmath47 are applied to determine the pdf@xmath48 .",
    "all excess galaxies seen around cluster locations as compared to the field are identified as cluster galaxies .      to calculate absolute magnitudes",
    "@xmath50 , apparent magnitudes @xmath55 must be corrected for luminosity distance , galactic dust extinction , and @xmath56-corrections as @xmath57    where @xmath58 is the luminosity distance for our assumed cosmology ; @xmath59 is the correction for reddening , computed following @xcite ; and @xmath60 is the appropriate @xmath56-correction .",
    "@xmath56-corrections are necessary because galaxy magnitudes in the observed bandpasses correspond to different rest - frame magnitudes depending on the redshift of the galaxy . to compare magnitudes of galaxies at different redshifts , we apply a @xmath56-correction to convert all the magnitudes to a fixed set of bandpasses . to do so ,",
    "we use the method of @xcite , and following @xcite , @xmath56-correct all galaxies to @xmath61 .",
    "this redshift is chosen since it is close to the median redshift of the sdss spectroscopic sample , and thus requires the smallest typical corrections .",
    "although the true redshifts of the galaxies are unknown , we apply @xmath56-corrections and calculate luminosity distances as though all galaxies projected around a given point ( cluster center or field location ) are at the same redshift as that point . for the galaxies distributed at different redshifts along the line of sight , the resulting absolute magnitudes are not correct , but for galaxies actually located at the redshift of the given position ( i.e. those galaxies physically associated with the cluster ) the @xmath56-correction and @xmath58 are appropriate .",
    "when the pdf@xmath48 is subtracted from the pdf@xmath47 , the contribution from galaxies not at the redshift of the cluster is removed , leaving only the cluster galaxies for which @xmath62 and @xmath60 are correctly determined .    our color - dependent @xmath56-corrections also affect the absolute magnitude to which the sample is complete and volume - limited at a given redshift .",
    "galaxies of different colors ( therefore with different amounts of @xmath56-correction applied ) and different apparent magnitudes can have the same absolute magnitude . thus @xmath56-correcting a range of uncorrected absolute magnitudes @xmath63 maps these magnitudes to the same @xmath64 .",
    "for example , at @xmath65 , @xmath66  @xmath54 0.4 mag ; at that redshift a galaxy with apparent r - band magnitude of 21.0 ( the survey limit ) corresponds , prior to @xmath56-correction , to an absolute magnitude of -19.9 . to be complete to @xmath65",
    ", we can only use those @xmath64  for which the corresponding range of @xmath63  does not extend fainter than -19.9 .",
    "the end result is that we adopt more conservative completeness limits to avoid color bias at faint luminosities .",
    "we do not use data in @xmath67-band because both @xmath56-corrections and star - galaxy separation are not as robust in this passband .",
    "the resulting absolute magnitude limits for a complete , volume - limited to @xmath27  = 0.3 sample of galaxies in @xmath25 , @xmath18 , @xmath26 , and @xmath27  are thus -20.2 , -19.6 , -19.4 , and -20.6 respectively .",
    "we correct for incompleteness both in geometry and in luminosity .",
    "geometric incompleteness occurs when the search radius around clusters extends beyond the boundaries of the survey .",
    "for example , at a redshift of @xmath27  = 0.07 ( the lowest redshift cluster considered here ) , the 2@xmath17 mpc radius aperture is @xmath68 in diameter ; some clusters lie too close to the edge of our 2.5-wide stripe of sky to have all galaxies within the desired aperture contained on an observed region of sky . for each radial bin of each cluster",
    ", we account for this geometrical incompleteness by calculating the area that lies on an observed region and weight the galaxy counts in each bin accordingly .",
    "luminosity incompleteness arises because the apparent magnitude limit of the survey causes a varying range of absolute magnitudes to be accessible at varying redshifts . for example , to a redshift of 0.3 , we can only see galaxies with @xmath69 but can examine all clusters in our catalog , while at @xmath27  = 0.07 , we can see to @xmath70 , but are limited to only a few clusters .",
    "to avoid restricting ourselves to studying only galaxies brighter than the completeness limit of the full set of clusters ( to @xmath65 ) , we account for this luminosity incompleteness . for each magnitude bin , we determine the number of clusters at redshifts low enough to have galaxies observable to that limit .",
    "the galaxy counts in each bin are weighted accordingly .",
    "the result is that the bright end of the luminosity distribution is based on galaxies in all clusters in the catalog ( at redshifts out to @xmath65 ) , but the faint end is determined from galaxies associated with lower - redshift clusters only . for our determination of @xmath16 , we use absolute magnitude limits that ensure luminosity completeness for the full set of clusters , and push fainter only for examining the luminosity function of cluster galaxies .",
    "having calculated the radial and absolute magnitude distributions of galaxies , we can determine the normalized pdf(n@xmath34,r,@xmath50 ) per surface area for galaxies around any set of positions and test our algorithm .",
    "in this section we check the background subtraction technique by examining the radial distribution and the luminosity distribution of galaxies around field locations , and compare these distributions to those measured around cluster centers .",
    "note that only a background - subtracted pdf ( e.g. the pdf@xmath46 ) contains physically meaningful information ; the pdf around any set of points before subtraction is dominated by galaxies projected by chance along the same line of sight , which have not been properly @xmath56-corrected .",
    "we therefore reserve the name ` luminosity function ' for the projection of a background - subtracted pdf onto the axis of absolute magnitude ; such a projection for a non - subtracted pdf we refer to as a ` luminosity distribution . '",
    "likewise , we will reserve the term ` radial profile ' for background - subtracted pdfs only , and will refer to the ` radial distribution ' of galaxies when discussing a non - subtracted pdf .",
    "a check on the errors recovered by our background subtraction technique is done by comparing the pdf@xmath48 with the population density of galaxies around a set of random points , which are different random points than those used in constructing the pdf@xmath48 .",
    "the pdfs measured around two different sets of random points should be statistically identical .",
    "a radial number density distribution is constructed by projecting a pdf(n@xmath34 , @xmath18 , @xmath50 )  onto the axis of projected radius .",
    "examining the distribution of galaxies around field locations enables us to check our correction for incompleteness due to geometry .",
    "when we construct the radial profile of clusters , we first examine the profile using only galaxies brighter than the completeness limit for the full set of clusters , and then using all galaxies while accounting for the varying completeness limit as described above .",
    "the results are statistically the same , but allow for inclusion of fainter galaxies in the latter case .",
    "the radial distribution of galaxies around random points is flat , demonstrating that we are properly calculating the area observed when correcting for geometrical incompleteness . comparing the radial distribution around field locations with that measured around a different set of random points",
    ", we see that the distributions are statistically identical at all radii .",
    "any differences are within the error bars , which reflect the poisson fluctuation of our sample .    around cluster centers ,",
    "however , we find a significant excess of galaxies compared to the field .",
    "this excess varies as a function of radius and as a function of richness .",

    "our cluster - finding algorithm identifies the bcg as the galaxy that maximizes @xmath29@xmath30 , a statistic which incorporates luminosity , color , and the number of fainter neighbors of similar color .",
    "there is an interplay between maximum local density and finding a galaxy with the right luminosity and color to be a bcg .",
    "sometimes the maximum total likelihood selects a galaxy as bcg that the eye would not .",
    "the cluster center is defined to be at the location of the algorithm - defined bcg , and thus may not be at the true center of the cluster potential if either the most massive cluster member is not the one with the highest bcg likelihood , and/or is not at the center of the potential .",
    "tests with simulations suggest that the centering of the maxbcg algorithm is good within @xmath54 80@xmath17 kpc . for a rich cluster ,",
    "this amount is a small fraction of the virial radius , but for a poor group , the algorithm may misplace the cluster center by a third of the virial radius . even if the galaxy identified as the bcg is both the brightest and the closest to the cluster center , x - ray observations suggest that a bcg can reside as far as @xmath54 70@xmath17 kpc from the center of the x - ray emission @xcite .",
    "the inner region of the lowest richness objects may be biased due to failing to correctly identify the galaxy most closely located at the center of the cluster , and therefore incorrectly positioning the center of the cluster . for the radial profiles ,",
    "a higher inner radial bin due to incorrect removal of the bcg of the lower - richness objects will skew the measured concentration parameter to higher values for those objects .",
    "we also see the presence of bcg - like galaxies in the very inner regions of the lowest - richness clusters in the luminosity function : examining the region within 50@xmath17 kpc of the centers of poor clusters shows a luminosity function with a small `` bcg bump '' at the bright end , even when the maxbcg - identified bcgs are removed . further investigation is needed to show whether these galaxies are the true bcgs of these groups , or whether the groups host a population of bcg - like galaxies in addition to the bcg .",
    "by using statistical background subtraction , we have observationally determined the changes in the radial distribution of cluster galaxies as a function of cluster richness , and used that information to calculate a characteristic radius for clusters of each richness .",
    "this model - independent radius , @xmath16 , is based on the number density of galaxies analogously to the way @xmath1  in use in simulations is based on mass density .",
    "we find that @xmath16  exhibits a power law scaling relationship with cluster richness .",
    "this result is in good agreement with the expected scaling from simulations .",
    "our result is also in general agreement with results obtained by other groups using different methods for measuring richness and @xmath1 . @xcite",
    "examined spectroscopically confirmed members of 90 rich clusters , and determined virial and core radii by fitting the observed galaxy distribution with an isothermal sphere .",
    "they find virial radii of 0.5 - 1 @xmath17  mpc , the same range we find for @xmath16  for rich clusters .",
    "@xcite examined @xmath1  as a function of cluster richness @xmath141  ( the amplitude of the galaxy cluster center correlation function measured for each cluster , scaled by a luminosity function and spatial distribution ) for 16 rich clusters with spectroscopically confirmed members .",
    "they measured @xmath1  by applying a singular isothermal sphere model to the velocity dispersion data @xcite , and find @xmath1  @xmath142 .",
    "this scaling matches well with what we find , although with greater scatter than our result . with our techniques , we have been able to use photometric data to confirm this relationship for rich clusters and extend the relationship to much less rich systems .    to compare equivalent regions of clusters of different richness ,",
    "@xmath16   may be used as an aperture within which to compare the properties of cluster members .",
    "the space density distribution of galaxies within @xmath16  is well described by an nfw profile , and the derived concentration parameter varies with cluster richness .",
    "we examined the population distribution function of cluster galaxies to determine how the luminosity function of cluster members changes both radially and with cluster richness , using our determination of @xmath16  to compare clusters in a wide range of richnesses .",
    "the radial variation of the luminosity function of cluster galaxies is similar in clusters of all richnesses , but does depend on the cluster richness .",
    "it is important to note that we can still detect a signal from the clusters at 2@xmath17 mpc from the cluster , even for poor groups . that there is still",
    "a significant over - density at these distances suggests caution when measuring the contribution of the background in an annulus centered on the cluster .",
    "we find that the central galaxies of clusters are distinguishable from the rest of the cluster galaxy population , as has been noted by others in both observational studies and in theoretical models .",
    "the bcg population is clearly evidenced in the luminosity function within @xmath16 , and more dramatically in the lf of the central region of clusters , as a `` bump '' at bright magnitudes that rises above the lf of the other cluster members .",
    "as the richness of the cluster increases , the bcg population becomes brighter but contributes less to the overall cluster light , in agreement with the results of @xmath56-band observations of bcgs in 93 x - ray selected systems studied by @xcite .",
    "we find that the luminosity function of low- and intermediate - richness systems can not be well described by a schechter function when the bcgs are included ; this function provides an acceptable fit only for the richer systems where the fractional contribution of the central galaxy to the lf is small . the total cluster luminosity function within @xmath16  is well modeled by the sum of a gaussian for the central galaxy and a schechter function for the satellites over the whole range of n@xmath34 .",
    "the trends of mean bcg luminosity and fractional contribution of the bcgs are in good agreement with the models of @xcite .",
    "we find that the mean bcg luminosity scales with mean log n@xmath34  as n@xmath34@xmath143 , a similar though slightly steeper result to what is seen in other studies .",
    "the low - richness objects identified with our cluster finding algorithm have properties that are quite different from rich clusters . systems with n@xmath34  @xmath110  5 and n@xmath34  @xmath144  7 have clearly different radial profiles and luminosity functions . the transition region @xmath145",
    "n@xmath34  @xmath140  has intermediate properties .",
    "one possible contribution to this difference is that the lowest - n@xmath34  objects are also the most likely to suffer from the effects of misidentifying the cluster center and/or the the brightest cluster member .",
    "in addition , the n@xmath34  @xmath110 8 objects have a strong selection function : maxbcg is finding systems where specifically only a few red galaxies are within 1@xmath17 mpc of the galaxy identified as the bcg .",
    "it is interesting that demanding so few galaxies of that color be in the neighborhood has the effect of finding objects that have very concentrated radial profiles , are located in isolated regions , and are dominated by bright galaxies .",
    "a possible explanation for these very low n@xmath34  systems is that at least some of them are fossil groups .",
    "observationally , a fossil group has the x - ray luminosity of a group or poor cluster , but in the optical , only a highly luminous early - type galaxy without bright neighbors is observed .",
    "the first such object was detected by @xcite ; subsequent study has shown that there are a few other galaxies in this group , but all are significantly fainter ( @xmath146 ) than the first - ranked galaxy @xcite .",
    "other fossil groups have been identified as well @xcite .",
    "such systems are thought to be the end - product of groups in which most of the galaxies have merged , producing a highly luminous central galaxy mostly alone in a halo of hot x - ray gas .",
    "this scenario is supported by the observations that the central galaxies emit a very high fraction of the total optical light of the group , and that there is a dearth of @xmath147  galaxies in the central region of these systems @xcite .    at fixed halo mass",
    ", there is a theoretical expectation that there should be a correlation between halo formation time and the total number of galaxies above a given luminosity threshold @xcite .",
    "this correlation may select a special population of of clusters at low n@xmath34 .",
    "we speculate that in high mass halos , all systems have bright red galaxies regardless of their formation time , and are equally well found by the maxbcg algorithm , while in smaller , group - mass halos the requirement to select red galaxies may select only the earliest forming halos .",
    "these low n@xmath34  systems would be expected to be early - forming halos with higher than average masses for their n@xmath34 , whose outer satellites have already merged with the central object .",
    "this theory is consistent with the lf shape and the extremely steep radial profiles seen here , as well as with the higher masses that are indicated by cluster - mass correlation function examined by @xcite .",
    "many of these systems may also be classified as compact groups ( cgs ) , such as those studied by @xcite and others .",
    "compact groups have been identified in sdss data by @xcite .",
    "they investigate the local environment of cgs , and find that while on average the number density of surrounding galaxies is comparable to the local environment around field galaxies , there is considerable scatter to both more and less dense environments ( see their figure 9 ) . by demanding few other bright , red galaxies nearby , the maxbcg algorithm may be preferentially selecting fossil groups , which would also look like those cgs in environments with a low number density of neighbors .",
    "further study is needed to understand this interesting set of systems .",
    "more investigation can be done using sdss data , but it also would be interesting to look for an x - ray signal from a stacked set of these low - richness objects .    we draw attention to the range of luminosity functions for galaxies within @xmath16  of clusters of different richness , and also to the differences in the lf seen radially . such variation makes it difficult to compare between different cluster catalogs , where different proxies for mass and aperture are in use .",
    "the lf of clusters in a mass range are different when different fractions of @xmath16  are sampled , and different again when a fixed aperture is used for each cluster .",
    "nonetheless , we do see similar results to those of other authors , including an upturn at the faint end for rich clusters .",
    "this effect comes primarily from galaxies located in the outer regions of the clusters .",
    "we are currently working to compare our results with simulations to show how our space density - based @xmath16  relates to the mass density - based @xmath1  commonly used in n - body models .",
    "also , we will examine how our richness parameter , n@xmath34 , relates to mass @xmath148 from the simulations .",
    "further work will be done to use the rich sdss dataset to explore the distribution of many properties of cluster galaxies in addition to those considered here .",
    "using a small subset of the sdss data is sufficient to determine the scaling of @xmath16  with cluster richness , and to robustly measure the luminosity functions and radial profiles in small n@xmath34  bins .",
    "using the full sdss dataset will allow us to study @xmath54 500 of the richest clusters and over 25,000 groups , and will allow cluster detection to higher redshifts .",
    "we will check for evolution in our scaling relationship by examining the @xmath16-n@xmath34  trend in different redshift samples .",
    "preliminary results indicate that the scaling is the same , but with higher normalization for lower redshift objects . to compare the properties of any stacked set of clusters ,",
    "the relationship of @xmath16  to n@xmath34  is essential .",
    "we can now compare different mass estimates , including those measured from total luminosity , velocity dispersion , and from lensing information .",
    "we will also use lensing studies to compare the profiles of the luminous and dark components of the clusters , more closely investigate the possible differences in concentration of the two profiles , and examine the bias between luminous and dark matter in these dense environments . extending this work to include color and morphology indicators",
    ", we will probe many characteristics of galaxies in clusters , exploring the history of galaxy formation as a function of environment , and studying the bcg population .    for large surveys",
    "it is typically not practical to determine cluster mass or size using spectroscopy . without assuming a model for the distribution of galaxies",
    ", we provide a way to determine cluster size from photometric data alone for @xmath149 0.3 . with knowledge of how the size - mass scaling evolves and a better understanding of the scaling of @xmath16  with total mass , our method provides a feasible way to measure the characteristic radii and masses of clusters that will be found in future large , high - redshift surveys .",

    "<S> imaging data from the sloan digital sky survey is used to measure the empirical size - richness relation for a large sample of galaxy clusters . </S>",
    "<S> using population subtraction methods , we determine the radius at which the cluster galaxy number density is 200@xmath0  times the mean galaxy density , without assuming a model for the radial distribution of galaxies in clusters . </S>",
    "<S> if these galaxies are unbiased on mpc scales , this galaxy - density - based @xmath1  reflects the characteristic radii of clusters . </S>",
    "<S> we measure the scaling of this characteristic radius with richness over an order of magnitude in cluster richness , from rich clusters to poor groups . </S>",
    "<S> we use this information to examine the radial profiles of galaxies in clusters as a function of cluster richness , finding that the concentration of the galaxy distribution decreases with richness and is systematically lower than the concentrations measured for dark matter profiles in n - body simulations . using these scaled radii </S>",
    "<S> , we investigate the behavior of the cluster luminosity function , and find that it is well matched by a schechter function for galaxies brighter than @xmath2 only after the central galaxy has been removed . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the luminosity function varies with richness and with distance from the cluster center , underscoring the importance of using an aperture that scales with cluster mass to compare physically equivalent regions of these different systems . </S>",
    "<S> we note that the lowest richness systems in our catalog have properties consistent with those expected of the earliest - forming halos ; our cluster - finding algorithm , in addition to reliably finding clusters , may be efficient at finding fossil groups . </S>"
