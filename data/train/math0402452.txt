    "the octahedron recurrence is the product of three chains of research seeking a common generalization .",
    "the first is the study of the algebraic relations between the connected minors of a matrix , and particularly of a recurrence relating them known and dodgson condensation . attempting to understand the combinatorics of dodgson condensation lead to the discovery of alternating sign matrices and aztec diamonds .",
    "aztec diamonds are graphs whose perfect matchings have extremely structured combinatorics and soon formed their own , second line of research as other graphs were discovered with the similar regularities . the third is the study of somos - sequences and the laurent phenomenon , which began with an attempt to understand theta functions from a combinatorial perspective . in this section",
    "we will sketch both lines of research . in the following section",
    ", we will begin to describe the vocabulary and main results of this paper .",
    "let @xmath0 be a collection of formal variables indexed by ordered pairs @xmath1 .",
    "let @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 be integers with @xmath6 and set @xmath7 charles dodgson  @xcite observed that @xmath8 suggested using this recursion to compute determinants and found generalizations that could be used when the above recursion requires dividing by @xmath9 .",
    "( this formula is not original to dodgson , according to page 7 of @xcite this formula has been variously attributed to sylvester , jacobi , desnanot , dodgson and frobenius . however , the use of this identity iteratively to compute connected minors and the detailed study of this method appears to have begun with dodgson and is known as dodgson condensation . )    before passing on , we should note that the study of algebraic relations between determinants and how they are effected by various vanishing conditions is essentially the study of the flag manifold and schubert varieties .",
    "this study lead to the invention of cluster algebras which later returned in the laurentness proofs we will discuss in section [ somos ] .",
    "see @xcite for the definitions of cluster algebras . the precise relation between cluster algebras and ( double ) schubert varieties is discussed in @xcite , although the reader may wish to first consult the references in that paper for the history of results that preceeded it .",
    "one can visualize this recurrence as taking place on a three dimensional lattice .",
    "the values @xmath0 are written on a horizontal two dimensional plane .",
    "the values @xmath10 live on a larger three dimensional lattice with @xmath10 written above the center of the matrix of which @xmath10 is the determinant and at a height proportional to @xmath11 .",
    "the six entries involved in computing the recurrence lie at the vertices of an octahedron .",
    "we make a change of the indexing variables of the lattice so that the lattice consists of those @xmath12 with @xmath13 .",
    "then the recurrence above can be rewritten as @xmath14 with @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "robbins and rumsey @xcite considered modifying the recurrence to @xmath17 and also generalized by allowing @xmath18 to be arbitrary instead of being forced to be @xmath19 .",
    "we write @xmath20 when @xmath21 is even and @xmath22 when @xmath21 is odd .",
    "robbins and rumsey discovered and proved that , despite these modifications , the functions @xmath23 were still laurent polynomials in the @xmath24 and in @xmath25 , with all coefficients equal to @xmath19 .",
    "robbins and rumsey discovered that the exponents of the @xmath24 in any monomial occuring in a @xmath26 formed pairs of `` compatible alternating sign matrices . ''",
    "we will omit the definition of these obects in favor of discussing a simpler combinatorial description , found by elkies , kuperberg , larsen and propp @xcite , in terms of tilings of aztec diamonds .",
    "if @xmath27 is a graph then a _ matching _ of @xmath27 is defined to be a collection @xmath28 of edges of @xmath27 such that each vertex of @xmath27 lies on exactly one edge of @xmath28 .",

    ", we will describe a combinatorial interpretation of the entries of @xmath26 in terms of matchings of certain graphs called aztec diamonds . for simplicity , we take @xmath33 in the recurrence for @xmath34 .    consider the infinite square grid graph : its vertices are at the points of the form @xmath35 with @xmath1 , its edges join those vertices that differ by @xmath36 or @xmath37 and its faces are unit squares centered at each @xmath1 .",
    "we will refer to the face centered at @xmath38 as @xmath38 .",
    "consider the set @xmath39 of all faces @xmath38 with @xmath40 .",
    "let @xmath41 be the induced subgraph of the square grid graph whose vertices are adjacent to some face of @xmath39 .",
    "we will call this the aztec diamond of order @xmath29 centered at @xmath42 .",
    "we define the _ faces _ of @xmath41 to be the squares @xmath38 for @xmath43 .",
    "note that this includes more squares than those in @xmath39 ; in particular , it contains some squares only part of whose boundary lies in @xmath41 .",
    "we refer to the faces in @xmath39 as _ closed _ faces and the others as _",
    "open _ faces .",
    "let @xmath28 be a matching of @xmath41 .",

    "@xcite shows that @xmath26 is equal to a sum over `` compatible pairs of alternating sign matrices '' and @xcite shows that such pairs are in bijection with perfect matchings of the aztec diamond . tracing through these bijections easily gives the claimed theorem .",
    "another proof can be found by mimicing the method used in @xcite to count the matchings of the aztec diamond .",
    "this result will also be a corollary of this paper s main result .    the order @xmath49 aztec diamond has @xmath50 perfect matchings .    clearly ,",
    "if we plug in @xmath19 for each @xmath24 , then @xmath51 for every matching @xmath28 so the number of matchings of the order @xmath49 aztec diamond will be @xmath52 .",
    "we will denote this number by @xmath53 .",
    "then the octahedron recurrence gives @xmath54 and the claim follows by induction .",
    "many other families of graphs have been discovered for which the number of matchings of the @xmath55 graph is proportional to a constant raised to a quadratic in @xmath49 .",
    "they are summarized and unified in @xcite .",
    "one of the purposes of this paper is to give proofs of these formulae as simple as the corrolary above .",
    "the monomial @xmath56 keeps track of the matching @xmath28 in a rather cryptic manner ; it is not even clear that @xmath56 determines @xmath28 , although this will follow from a later result ( proposition [ facedetermine ] ) .",
    "it is natural to add new variables that code directly for the presence or absence of individual edges .",
    "let @xmath57 and @xmath58 be integers such that @xmath59 . draw the plane such that @xmath57 increases in the east - ward direction and @xmath58 in the north - ward .",
    "let the edges east , north , west and south of @xmath38 be labelled @xmath60 , @xmath61 , @xmath62 and @xmath63 respectively .",
    "introduce new free variables with the same names as the edges .",
    "we now define an enhanced version of @xmath34 by @xmath64 where the sum is still over all matchings of the order @xmath29 aztec diamond .",
    "each matching is now counted by both the monomial @xmath56 and the product of the edges occuring in that matching .",
    "the new @xmath34 obeys the recurrence @xmath65      somos has attempted to rebuild the theory of theta functions on a combinatorial basis .",
    "theta functions are functions of two variables , traditionally called @xmath66 and @xmath67 . the simplest theta function is @xmath68 . from now on , we will concentrate only on the dependence on @xmath66 and so write @xmath69 . for a general introduction to @xmath70 functions , see for example chapter xxi of @xcite .",
    "somos began with a well known result , that , for any @xmath71 and @xmath72 , @xmath69 would obey @xmath73 for @xmath74 and @xmath75 certain constants depending in a complicated manner on @xmath67 .",
    "somos proposed using this recurrence to compute @xmath76 in terms of @xmath74 , @xmath75 and @xmath77 , @xmath78 , @xmath79 and @xmath80 .",
    "he discovered that @xmath76 was a laurent polynomial in these @xmath81 variables .",
    "this is not difficult to prove by elementary means , but suggests a deeper explanation may be lurking .",
    "moreover , he discovered that all of the coefficients of this laurent polynomial were positive but was unable to prove this ; this will be proven for the first time as a corollary of the results of this paper .",
    "after somos s work , many other recurrence with surprising laurentness properties were discovered ; see @xcite for a summary .",
    "the family of most importance for this paper is the three term gale - robinson recurrence : let @xmath82 , @xmath83 and @xmath84 be positive integers with @xmath85 .",
    "the three term gale - robinson recurrence ( abbreviated to `` gale - robinson recurrence '' in the remainder of this paper ) is @xmath86 note that the somos recurrence is the case @xmath87 .",
    "note that if @xmath88 and @xmath89 , we get the recurrence @xmath90 , the recurrence for the number of perfect matchings of the aztec diamond .",
    "the gale - robinson recurrence , for every value of @xmath91 , can be thought of as a special case of the octahedron recurrence .",
    "this observation was first made by propp and seems to have first appeared in print in @xcite .",
    "the reduction is performed as follows : suppose that @xmath92 obeys the gale - robinson recurrence .",
    "define @xmath23 by @xmath93 .",
    "then @xmath34 obeys @xmath94    thus , if we choose @xmath60 , @xmath61 , @xmath62 and @xmath63 to be constants @xmath83 , @xmath84 , @xmath95 and @xmath96 with @xmath97 and @xmath98 , @xmath34 obeys the octahedron recurrence . in these circumstances",
    ", we must study the octahedron recurrence not with the initial conditions @xmath99 and @xmath18 but with the initial coniditions @xmath23 for @xmath12 such that @xmath100 .",
    "it therefore beomes our goal to study the octahedron recurrence with general initial conditions .",
    "the main result of this paper will be that , with any inital conditions , @xmath23 is a laurent polynomial in the initial coniditions and in the coefficients @xmath60 , @xmath61 , @xmath62 and @xmath63 .",
    "moreover , all of the coefficients of this laurent polynomial are @xmath19 .",
    "in particular , they are positive . in the reduction of the gale - robinson recurrence to the octahedron recurrence , we imposed that many of the initial conditions of the octahedron recurrence be equal to each other .",
    "thus , many monomials that would be distinct if the octahedron recurrence were run with arbitrary inital conditions become the same in the gale - robinson recurrence .",
    "however , we can still deduce that all of the coefficients of the laurent polynomials computed by the gale - robinson recurrence are positive .",
    "in this section we will introduce the main objects and results of this paper .",
    "the main object of study of this paper is a function @xmath34 defined on a three dimensional lattice by a certain recurrence .",

    "it turns out that the values of @xmath34 are laurent polynomials in the initial variables where every term has coefficient 1 .",
    "we are able further more to find families of graphs such that @xmath34 gives generating functions for the perfect matchings of these graphs .",
    "special cases of this result include being able to choose @xmath101 so that @xmath34 gives us the values of three term gale - robinson sequences or such that the families of graphs are aztec diamonds , fortresses and other common families of graphs with simple formulas for the number of their matchings .    in the next subsection",

    "another way to describe the faces of @xmath27 which is more intuitive but harder to write down is that the faces of @xmath27 correspond to those @xmath238 which are used in compuing @xmath23 and the closed faces correspond to those @xmath238 which are divided by in the course of this computation .    in our running example , the closed faces are @xmath239 , @xmath240 and @xmath241 .",
