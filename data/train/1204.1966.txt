    "biomembranes are two - dimensional ( 2d ) fluids that separate the inner and outer environment of organelles in biological cells . naturally occurring biomembranes consist typically of numerous lipid species , sterols , sugars and membrane proteins . according to the `` lipid raft '' hypothesis  @xcite ,",
    "some of the lipid components and/or proteins are incorporated into finite - size domains , which play an important role on cellular functions such as signal transduction processes .",
    "recent experiments suggest that lipid rafts are nothing but dynamical molecular assemblies of 20 nm in size with finite lifetime in the order of 1020ms  @xcite .",
    "being motivated by the raft hypothesis , a large number of investigations  @xcite have been conducted to reveal the properties of artificial membranes consisting of lipid mixtures and cholesterol . below the miscibility transition temperature , formation of micron - size domains were observed using fluorescent microscopy  @xcite . in some cases , rather than a macroscopic phase separation , domains with distinct size in the micrometer range have been reported  @xcite .",
    "for example , various types of modulated ( stripe or hexagonal ) patterns have been found for multicomponent lipid and cholesterol mixtures  @xcite . above the miscibility transition temperature",
    ", even multicomponent membranes do not phase separate , and their concentration fluctuations around the homogeneous state can be investigated  @xcite , in particular , close to the critical point , @xmath0 . furthermore",
    ", it is interesting to note that critical concentration fluctuations have been observed in membranes extracted from living cells  @xcite .",
    "one of the main reasons that initiated the notion of lipid rafts in biomembranes is the existence of finite - size domains , rather than domains resulting from a macroscopic phase separation  @xcite . assuming that membranes are in equilibrium",
    ", the same question can be phrased in terms of whether the biomembrane state is above or below the miscibility transition temperature . in the high temperature one - phase region ,",
    "the only relevant length scale is the correlation length associated with concentration fluctuations , and it diverges at the critical point , @xmath0  @xcite .",
    "below this temperature , there should be a physical mechanism suppressing domain coarsening in order to explain the existence of finite - size domains in equilibrium .",
    "yet another characteristic feature of biomembranes is that the lipid composition of the two leaflets ( monolayers ) constituting the bilayer is not the same  @xcite .",
    "moreover , such asymmetric monolayers are not independent but are coupled to one another .",
    "this was confirmed experimentally by investigating the phase separation of bilayers with different monolayer lipid compositions  @xcite , or seen in simulations  @xcite .",
    "one mechanism that leads to the coupling between the two leaflets is the lipid chain interdigitation occurring at the mid - plane of the bilayer  @xcite , which may affect the domain size in asymmetric bilayers .",
    "one possibility to account for such finite - size domains in lipid mixtures is to consider the special role played by `` hybrid lipids ''  @xcite .",
    "these lipids have one saturated hydrocarbon chain and another unsaturated one .",
    "they tend to be localized at boundaries of 2d domains and act as a line - active agent .",
    "hence , a ternary lipid mixture consisting of saturated lipids with two saturated chains , unsaturated lipids with two unsaturated chains , and hybrid lipids can be regarded as a _",
    " 2d microemulsion \" _ , because it is analogous to the microemulsion phase consisting of oil , water and surfactant  @xcite . for microemulsions",
    "it is known that there is another length scale , in addition to the correlation length mentioned above , related to the size of water and oil micro - domains  @xcite .    using the microemulsion analogy , we suggest that an additional length scale can be responsible for the finite - size structures in biomembranes .",
    "we propose a model for bilayers consisting of two coupled monolayers that are both in a 2d microemulsion state , manifesting modulated phases .",
    "first , we describe a monolayer model that includes a coupling between the lipid composition and a 2d vectorial order - parameter .",
    "the model accounts for the line active nature of hybrid lipids .",
    "next , we consider a bilayer in which two such monolayers are coupled through an inter - leaflet interaction . for the coupled bilayer , we discuss the static and dynamic properties of concentration fluctuations above @xmath0 , and investigate their micro - phase separation below @xmath0  @xcite .",
    "intermediate structures arise when two competing structures have different characteristic length scales .",
    "one of our important conclusions is that the micro - phase separated structures below @xmath0 reflect the static and dynamic properties of concentration fluctuations above @xmath0 .",

    "namely , the inter - leaflet coupling strongly affects the compositional modulation in each monolayer .",

    "the initial growth rates of the unstable modes are identical to the decay rates of the concentration fluctuations .    as mentioned in sec .",
    "i , the special character of concentration fluctuations in our model may explain the finite - size domains (  rafts \" ) in biological membranes .",
    "for ordinary binary mixtures above @xmath0 , the only length scale of the disorder phase is determined by the correlation length , and close to @xmath0 , this length becomes large .",
    "but within our 2d microemulsion model , there is another length scale characterizing the modulations as given by eq .",
    "( [ periodicity ] ) .",
    "this second length scale may also explain the finite - size domains observed in some experiments as a result of micro - phase separation in the low temperature phase .",
    "a related model based on a microemulsion picture was recently proposed by schick  @xcite , who considered a coupling between curvature and compositional asymmetry between the two leaflets , resulting in a 2d microemulsion .",
    "although schick s model as well as ours share the microemulsion viewpoint , the origin of the physical mechanism is different . in schick s model",
    "the coupling between composition asymmetry and curvature gives rise to domains with different spontaneous curvature .",
    "our model , on the other hand , assumes that for flat monolayers , the line - active nature of hybrid lipids is solely responsible for the microemulsion formation ( see eq .",
    "( [ freeenergycoup ] ) ) .",
    "hence , our proposed physical mechanism for the bilayer coupling , as discussed in sec .  [ couplebilayer ] , is different .",
    "one of the consequences of our @xmath60 coupling is that the domains residing on the two leaflets are in register , unlike the prediction of ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the present work is concerned with the analysis of equilibrium properties and relaxation dynamics towards the equilibrium state .",
    "the existence of finite - size domains may also be explained by non - equilibrium lipid transport between the cell interior and the membrane .",
    "such a mechanism was considered  @xcite through a coupling between the membrane and an outer reservoir of lipid or cholesterol . similarly to our model , these works explain the appearance of the finite - size domains as a result of micro - phase separation .    asymmetry between lipid composition in the inner and outer leaflets of biomembranes has a very deep significance and is closely related to the cell biological functions .",
    "for instance , the breakdown of such compositional asymmetry is related to programmed cell death ( apoptosis )  @xcite . for living cells",
    ", this asymmetry is maintained by an enzyme called `` flippase '' that actively transports the lipids between the two leaflets  @xcite .",
    "the half - time of lipid composition due to flip - flop motion is measured using time resolved small angle neutron scattering ( sans )  @xcite , and is estimated to be several hours at physiological conditions .",
    "although membranal signal transduction is important for various biological functions , its dynamical properties are still not so well understood . as our theory offers an explanation for the size and dynamics of lipid domains , we hope that it and similar models will contribute in the future towards the understanding of functional processes in biomembranes .",
