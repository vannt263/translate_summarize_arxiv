    "the movement of cells , bacteria or other microorganisms under the effect of a chemical stimulus , represented by a chemoattractant , such as chemokines or growth factors , has been widely studied in mathematics in the last two decades , see @xcite , and various models involving partial differential equations have been proposed to describe this evolution .",
    "the basic unknowns in these chemotactic models are the density of individuals and the concentrations of some chemical attractants .",
    "one of the most considered models is the patlak - keller - segel system @xcite , where the evolution of the density of cells is described by a parabolic equation , and the concentration of a chemoattractant is generally given by a parabolic or elliptic equation , depending on the different regimes to be described and on the authors taste .",
    "the behavior of this systems is quite well known now , at least for linear diffusions : in the one - dimensional case , the solution is always global in time @xcite , while in two and more dimensions the solutions exist globally in time or blow up according to the size of the initial data , see @xcite and references therein , and see the recent result of global existence for large data in the parabolic - parabolic case @xcite .",
    "however , a drawback of this model is that the diffusion leads alternatively to a fast dissipation or an explosive behavior , while in general , from a biological point of view , it is much more interesting to observe the creation of patterns and permanent structures .    in order to avoid these drawbacks and to improve the accuracy of the transient description , some modifications of the original keller - segel formulation were introduced to prevent overcrowding , by taking into account the volume filling effect ; see @xcite .",
    "for instance , in @xcite , a nonlinear diffusion is considered .",
    "more precisely , denoting by @xmath0 the density of cells and by @xmath1 the concentration of a generic chemoattractant , the keller - segel - like system with nonlinear diffusion reads @xmath2 where @xmath3 and @xmath4 are given positive parameters .",
    "the cells move following the direction of the gradient of the concentration of chemoattractant with a response coefficient @xmath5 ; they also diffuse and @xmath6 is a phenomenological , density dependent function , which is usually given by a pressure law for isentropic gases , such as @xmath7 which is intended to prevent the overcrowding of cells . besides , the evolution of chemoattractant is still given by a linear diffusion equation with a source term which depends on @xmath8 .",
    "the chemoattractant is released by the cells , diffuses in the environment and it is degraded in finite time .",
    "the positive parameters @xmath9 are respectively its diffusion coefficient , the production rate , which is proportional to the cell density , and the degradation rate .",
    "if @xmath10 , we consider a parabolic - parabolic model and in the case where @xmath11 , we deal with a parabolic - elliptic model .",
    "now , it is also expected that a hyperbolic model will enable us to observe intermediate organized structures , like aggregation patterns , at a finer scale @xcite . in @xcite",
    "the advantage of the hyperbolic approach over the parabolic one was considered in the case of a semilinear model of chemotaxis based on the cattaneo law .",
    "in particular , the authors described qualitatively some experiments of patterns formation .",
    "here , we focus on a quasilinear hyperbolic model of chemotaxis introduced by gamba et al .",
    "@xcite to describe the early stages of the vasculogenesis process .",
    "this model writes as a hyperbolic - parabolic system for the following unknowns : the density of cells @xmath0 , their momentum @xmath12 and the concentration @xmath1 of a chemoattractant : @xmath13 the positive constants @xmath5 and @xmath14 measure respectively the strength of the cells response to the concentration of the chemical substance and the strength of the damping forces . the pressure @xmath6 is still given by the pressure law for isentropic gases .",
    "this model of chemotaxis has been introduced to describe the results of in vitro experiments performed by serini et al .",
    "@xcite using human endothelial cells which , randomly seeded on a matrigel , formed complex patterns with structures depending on the initial number of cells .",
    "although analytical results about this model are still far from being complete , for the cauchy problem on the whole space and in all space dimensions , so with no boundary conditions , it is possible to prove the global existence of smooth solutions if the initial datum is a small perturbation of a small enough constant state , see @xcite . in the case of the one dimensional boundary value problem , when the differential part is linearized , the global existence and the time asymptotic decay of the solutions were proved in @xcite , if the initial data are small perturbations of stable constant stationary states . to complete the analytical study of the quasilinear model",
    "there are some clear difficulties .",
    "the first one lies in the appearance of regions of vacuum during the evolution of the time solution , since the hyperbolic part of the model degenerates as the eigenvalues coincide ; as far as we know , the only related results are given in @xcite , and they are about the local existence of solutions for the euler equations with damping and vacuum , but without chemotaxis .    from a more biological point of view , the appearance of non constant solutions with a succession of regions with high density of cells and regions of vacuum , can be put in correspondence with the formation of patterns , such as a network of blood capillaries . in @xcite",
    ", present authors analyzed the existence of some non - constant steady states to model on a one dimensional bounded domain .",
    "in particular , for the pressure law with @xmath15 , a complete description of the stationary solutions formed of one region of positive density near the boundary and one region of vacuum was given .",
    "numerical simulations also shown that such solutions are stable and can be found as asymptotic states of the system even for strictly positive initial data .",
    "in the following , we will call `` bump '' a region with a nonnegative density surrounded by two regions of vacuum , as shown in blue in figure [ fig : solstat ] , and a `` lateral half bump '' will be a bump cut in its middle and stuck to an extremity of the interval , as shown in red in the same figure [ fig : solstat ] . other stationary configurations with several bumps have been also observed numerically as asymptotic states of the model in @xcite .",
    "these configurations are described in details with a comparison of their energy values in @xcite .",
    "remark that in the case of bounded domains with no - flux boundary conditions , stationary solutions for both systems and coincide and it is worth exploring if the asymptotic states of the two systems are the same or not .",
    "actually , one may expect the keller - segel type model with @xmath11 ( i.e. : the parabolic - elliptic case ) to be the large time and large damping limit of the hyperbolic system , and this is actually the case in @xcite for the case without chemotaxis or in @xcite for our case , both results being proved only on unbounded domains . in this paper ,",
    "our main goal is to make a careful comparison of the two models and with @xmath10 , by analyzing numerically their actual asymptotic behavior . in particular , we are able to exhibit some sets of initial data and some parameters such that the two systems converge asymptotically to two different stationary solutions , namely two solutions with a different number of bumps . in that case , the diffusive keller - segel model seems to be more inclined to merge bumps together , so that the asymptotic solution contains a smaller number of bumps than the asymptotic solution for the hyperbolic system , often after a long transient where nothing happens .",
    "some similar phenomena which are referred as metastability of patterns , were observed in the case of a keller - segel type model with linear diffusion and a logistic chemosensitive function in @xcite , see subsection [ generic ] for more details .    in order to perform such a comparison , we need first to find an accurate scheme for the hyperbolic system to make a reliable comparison of the two models .",
    "the approximation of this system needs special care due to the presence of vacuum states and emergence of non - constant steady states .",
    "more precisely , the discretization procedure has to generate non - negative solutions with finite speed of propagation and should resolve properly the non constant equilibria , characterized by a vanishing flux .",
    "such problems are well - known when dealing with hyperbolic equations with sources , see for instance @xcite .",
    "for that purpose , we consider the well - balanced scheme proposed in @xcite and based on the upwinding sources at interfaces methodology @xcite . in @xcite",
    ", we used a hydrostatic reconstruction , introduced by audusse et al .",
    "@xcite in the case of shallow - water equations and by bouchut , ounaissa and perthame @xcite in the case of euler equations with large damping . to use this approach",
    ", we compute the reconstructed interface variables by integrating the equation for stationary solutions with a constant velocity . according to the form of the equation",
    "we integrate , two different reconstructions can be found ; both lead to schemes that are consistent with the hyperbolic problem , preserve the non - negativity of the density , and are exact on non - constant steady states .",
    "however , we show in this paper that only one of these two schemes is asymptotically consistent with a conservative scheme for the parabolic model in the large time and large damping limit , and therefore it will be the one used in our comparison .",
    "another improvement of the scheme described here , with respect with @xcite , is the implicit treatment of the damping term , which solves more accurately the vacuum states and the flux on the non constant equilibria .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : after a brief recall in section [ recall ] about the structure of the stationary solutions with vacuum , found in @xcite and @xcite , we propose in section [ scheme ] two different numerical schemes for the quasilinear hyperbolic system based on well - balanced techniques , with a particular care for their asymptotic preserving property .",
    "then , in section [ numhyp ] , we show some numerical evidences of the behavior of these schemes in order to choose a well adapted scheme .",
    "finally , in section [ numcomp ] , we present an accurate scheme for the parabolic system , based on the diffusive relaxation techniques of @xcite , and we perform a careful numerical comparison between the asymptotic solutions for systems and for system .",
    "in @xcite and @xcite , we noticed that in the particular case @xmath15 , it is possible to compute explicitly and classify the stationary solutions with vacuum of the two systems and , which obviously coincide .",
    "let us recall briefly these results to make the paper almost self - contained .",
    "consider system on a one dimensional bounded domain @xmath16 $ ] with no - flux boundary conditions , that is @xmath17 notice that , under these conditions , the stationary solutions of system and system coincide .",
    "remark also that , when considering the evolution problem ( [ eq : main_system ] ) or with the previous boundary conditions , the mass of the density is constant in time , namely @xmath18 } \\rho(x,0 ) \\ , dx=\\int_{[0,l ] } \\rho(x , t ) \\ , dx , \\ , \\textrm { for all } t \\geq 0.\\ ] ]",
    "therefore , the mass @xmath19 will be considered in what follows as a parameter which characterizes stationary solutions .      the first type of solutions is given by the constant solutions , that is to say , for all domain length @xmath20 and all mass @xmath21 , there is a solution defined by @xmath22 , which is the only constant solution in the space of stationary states .",
    "this kind of solution is displayed in green in figure [ fig : solstat ] .",
    "let us denote by @xmath23 .",
    "we assume that @xmath24 and @xmath25",
    ". then there exists a unique , positive solution ( up to symmetry ) of mass @xmath19 with only one region of positive density and one region of vacuum , given by the following expression  :    [ lateral_bump ] @xmath26 , \\medskip\\\\ 0 , & \\textrm { for } x\\in(\\bar{x},l ] , \\end{array}\\right.\\ ] ] and @xmath27 , \\medskip\\\\ { \\displaystyle}-\\frac{2\\kappa   k}{\\chi } \\frac{\\cosh(\\sqrt{\\frac{b}{d}}(x - l))}{\\cosh(\\sqrt{\\frac{b}{d}}(\\bar{x}-l ) ) } ,   & \\textrm { for } x\\in(\\bar{x},l ] .",
    "\\end{array}\\right.\\ ] ]    the free boundary point @xmath28 is given by the only value @xmath29 which solves the equation @xmath30 and the constant @xmath31 is equal to @xmath32    if @xmath33 , or @xmath24 , but @xmath34 , then there is no half bump solution to the problem .",
    "an example of such solution is plotted in red in figure [ fig : solstat ] .      in @xcite",
    ", we also proved that , in the case when @xmath35 , there exists only one solution composed by a central bump surrounded by two regions of vacuum .",
    "this solution is symmetric with respect to the middle point of the interval @xmath16 $ ] and can be computed by sticking two lateral bumps , calculated on a domain @xmath36 $ ] with a mass @xmath37 .",
    "this can be seen in blue in figure [ fig : solstat ] .    in @xcite , it is shown that , when a two bumps solution , which is made by a concatenation of two bumps ( in the case @xmath38 ) , is computed , then one can find an infinite number of such solutions . namely , there is one parameter free in the family of such solutions .",
    "moreover , for each solution , an energy can be calculated and it can be proved that the symmetric two bumps solution has the higher energy ( in cyan in figure [ fig : solstat ] ) , whereas the solution with no vacuum for one of the two bumps has the lower one ( in black in figure [ fig : solstat ] ) .",
    "it is also possible to construct some 3-bumps solutions with 2 parameters , and so on .",
    "we expect all these stationary solutions to exist for any other values of @xmath39 , but for @xmath40 , it is difficult to work , since we have no more explicit expressions of the solutions . to conclude this section , let us say that , among all these configurations , the constant solution has the highest energy , whereas the lateral half bump is the one with lowest energy , see again @xcite .    in figure [ fig : solstat ] , we can see five different types of stationary solutions for the same parameters of the system , always with @xmath15 , same length of the domain @xmath41 and same mass @xmath19 .",
    "the densities are obtained analytically using the above formulas , while the locations of interfaces with vacuum @xmath28 are found by solving equation numerically .     and @xmath42 .",
    "let us now explain how to construct a well adapted scheme for system , taking care of being accurate in the approximation of stationary solutions . system ( [ eq : main_system ] ) couples equations of different natures , i.e. a quasilinear system of conservation laws with sources , which is coupled with a linear parabolic equation .",
    "the latter is very classical and several methods can be used , as , for instance , finite differences in space and the classical explicit - implicit crank - nicholson method for the time discretization .",
    "now , in this section , we concentrate on the discretization of the hyperbolic part and we improve the finite volume scheme proposed in @xcite , based on the upwinding sources at the interfaces technique developed in @xcite .    after a brief recall about the numerical framework , we analyze the asymptotic preserving property in the large time and large damping limit , which is given by the parabolic system with @xmath11 .",
    "we show that e - reconstruction is not asymptotic preserving , whereas the p - reconstruction is consistent , in the large time and large damping limit , with a conservative scheme for the parabolic problem .      denoting by @xmath43 the vector of two unknowns , respectively density and momentum ,",
    "the hyperbolic part of system can be written in the following form    [ eq : hyp_matrix ] @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the flux function and @xmath46 the source term , i.e. @xmath47    according to the framework of finite volume schemes , we divide the interval @xmath16 $ ] into @xmath48 cells @xmath49 , centered at the nodes @xmath50 . in the following , we assume that all the cells have the same length @xmath51 .",
    "we consider a semi - discrete space approximation of the solution @xmath52 to system on cell @xmath53 , i.e. we compute an approximation of the cell average of the solution at time @xmath54 , that is to say @xmath55 we denote now by @xmath56 an approximation of function @xmath57 at discrete time @xmath58 , where @xmath59 is the time step .",
    "let us consider a numerical flux @xmath60 consistent with the continuous flux @xmath45 , that is to say that it satisfies @xmath61 a general , fully discrete , explicit finite volume scheme for ( [ eq : hyp_matrix ] ) can be written as    [ eq : scheme_main ] @xmath62 where the values @xmath63 are interface variables computed at the point @xmath64 , and @xmath65 is an approximation of the source term .    according to the results in @xcite",
    ", we decided to discretize the homogeneous part using the suliciu scheme adapted to vacuum , see also @xcite . notice that in the following , we may write @xmath66 instead of @xmath67 when necessary .",
    "following @xcite , we compute the interfaces variables in order to preserve non - constant stationary solutions with constant velocity .",
    "we also need to upwind the source term and we use the following ansatz  : @xmath68    this ansatz is based on the equation satisfied by stationary solutions i.e. @xmath69 and the fact that the momentum of a stationary solution is vanishing , thanks to the boundary conditions .",
    "we also reconstruct the interface variables @xmath63 using the local equilibrium @xmath70 to derive our first method , we observe that the second equation can be rewritten in terms of the internal energy @xmath71 defined by @xmath72 , which yields @xmath73 from this equation , we obtain the so - called e - reconstruction , by an approximate integration on @xmath74 and @xmath75 $ ] , by taking :    [ eq : ereconstruction ] @xmath76 and @xmath77_{+ } , \\medskip\\\\ \\psi\\left(\\rho_{i+1/2}^{n,+}\\right)=\\left[\\psi(\\rho_{i+1}^n ) + \\chi(\\min(\\phi_{i}^n,\\phi_{i+1}^n)-\\phi_{i+1}^n)+\\alpha(u_{i+1}^n)_{-}\\delta x\\right]_{+}. \\end{array}\\right.\\ ] ]    we proved in @xcite that the scheme , coupled with the e- reconstruction , is consistent with system ( [ eq : main_system ] ) away from vacuum , preserves the non - negativity of the density and preserves the stationary solutions with vanishing velocity .",
    "another way to proceed is to integrate directly the equilibrium equation to get a different reconstruction , namely :    [ eq : preconstruction ] @xmath78 and @xmath79_{+ } , \\medskip \\\\",
    "p\\left(\\rho_{i+1/2}^{n,+}\\right)=\\bigl[p(\\rho_{i+1}^n ) + \\chi\\overline{\\rho}_{i+1/2}^n(\\min(\\phi_{i}^n,\\phi_{i+1}^n)-\\phi_{i+1}^n)\\\\ \\qquad \\qquad \\qquad \\qquad \\qquad \\qquad \\qquad \\qquad \\qquad   \\qquad \\qquad + \\alpha\\rho_{i+1}^n(u_{i+1}^n)_{-}\\delta x\\bigr]_{+ } , \\end{array}\\right.\\ ] ]    where @xmath80 . in the following this scheme will be mentioned as the p - reconstruction .    the computations to prove that the scheme , coupled with the p - reconstruction is consistent , preserves the non - negativity of the density and preserves the stationary solutions with vanishing velocity , are analogous to the ones performed in @xcite for the e - reconstruction .",
    "moreover , as shown in @xcite , this scheme is stable under a condition of the form @xmath81 where @xmath82 is a numerical speed such that the solver @xmath83 for the homogeneous system @xmath84 preserves the non negativity of @xmath8 by interface ; see @xcite or @xcite for more details .",
    "next , we propose another possible improvement for our scheme , which consists in discretizing implicitly the damping term . indeed , in the previous reconstructions and , the damping term was included in the definition of the interface densities .",
    "however , since it is a stiff term , it is more natural to deal with an implicit treatment .",
    "therefore , the damping term is considered in the discretization equation and disappears in the reconstruction formula ; the second equation of the fully discrete scheme is therefore replaced by  :    [ eq : implicit ] @xmath85 with @xmath86 and the interface values are given respectively by @xmath87_{+ } , \\qquad\\\\ \\psi\\left(\\hat{\\rho}_{i+1/2}^{n,+}\\right)=\\left[\\psi(\\rho_{i+1}^n ) + \\chi(\\min(\\phi_{i}^n,\\phi_{i+1}^n)-\\phi_{i+1}^n)\\right]_{+ } , \\end{array}\\right.\\ ] ] for the e - reconstruction , and by @xmath88_{+ } , \\qquad\\\\ p\\left(\\hat{\\rho}_{i+1/2}^{n,+}\\right)=\\left[p(\\rho_{i+1}^n ) + \\chi\\overline{\\rho}_{i+1/2}^n(\\min(\\phi_{i}^n,\\phi_{i+1}^n)-\\phi_{i+1}^n)\\right]_{+ } , \\end{array}\\right.\\ ] ]    for the p - reconstruction .",
    "next , let us study the convergence of these various schemes in the large time and large damping limit .",
    "we are now going to show that , using a large time and large damping scaling ( ltld in the following ) in system , we obtain a chemotaxis model based on the porous medium equation .",
    "recall that , in @xcite , it was proven that the velocity of the compressible euler system without chemotaxis satisfies the darcy law in the large time limit , while in @xcite the asymptotic convergence of system to parabolic systems was analyzed under various scalings .",
    "both papers were dealing with the case of the whole space .    here , on the contrary , we are in a bounded interval , and so space dilations are not considered .",
    "therefore , let @xmath89 and define the following scaled variables , to perform the ltld limit : @xmath90 hence , system can be rewritten for the new unknowns as  : @xmath91_{x } = \\chi\\rho{^{\\varepsilon}}\\phi{^{\\varepsilon}}_{x}-\\rho{^{\\varepsilon}}v{^{\\varepsilon}}}\\\\ { \\displaystyle}{\\varepsilon\\phi{^{\\varepsilon}}_{\\tau } = d\\phi{^{\\varepsilon}}_{xx}+a\\rho{^{\\varepsilon}}-b\\phi{^{\\varepsilon } } } \\end{array}\\right.\\ ] ] as @xmath92 , which corresponds to the ltld limit , we obtain the following parabolic - elliptic system , see @xcite for more analytical details , that is system with @xmath11  : @xmath93\\medskip \\\\ { \\displaystyle}0=d\\phi_{xx}+a\\rho - b\\phi . \\end{array}\\right.\\ ] ] in this section , we study the asymptotic preserving property of the numerical scheme with the reconstruction or for system .",
    "following @xcite , we compute the ltld limit of the first component of the numerical flux @xmath94 obtained with the two methods of reconstruction for system and we analyze their consistency with system .",
    "more precisely , we say that a numerical flux is asymptotic preserving in the ltld limit , if we have the following local expansion : @xmath95 where @xmath96 is a consistent and conservative numerical flux for the parabolic equation  : @xmath97 we show in the following theorem that this property depends on the reconstruction we choose .    to handle correctly the proof of the theorem",
    ", we need the following conditions on the numerical flux  :    [ thedef ] a consistent numerical flux function @xmath98 is said to be strongly consistent if it satisfies the two following conditions  :    * if @xmath99 then @xmath100 ; * if @xmath101 then @xmath100 .    this definition is derived from a condition given in @xcite and is satisfied , in particular , for the hll flux , the hll - roe flux and the suliciu relaxation flux adapted to vacuum ( see @xcite ) . in the annex [ annex ] , the reader can find a discussion about this condition and the computations to prove that the previous fluxes satisfy it .",

    "we first pass to the limit @xmath108 in the second equation of scheme , using expansions , and we obtain that @xmath109 thanks to the assumption of strong consistency of the flux , the relation @xmath110 gives a unique solution to the previous equation ; see annex [ annex ] for more details .",

    "let us first recall the definition [ thedef ] . a strongly consistent numerical flux @xmath154 satisfies the two following conditions  : @xmath155    we consider the following equations  : @xmath156 computed at the beginning of the proof of theorem [ thethm ] . in the following , we will prove that conditions are necessary and sufficient conditions to ensure that the equalities @xmath157 for all @xmath116 are the unique solutions of equations .",
    "we will also show that the following classical fluxes  : hll , hll - roe and suliciu relaxation flux adapted to vacuum are indeed strongly consistent fluxes .",
    "remark that conditions have already been derived as necessary conditions on the flux in @xcite , where a sufficient condition on the flux is also given to ensure the uniqueness property for the solutions of equations .",
    "since we are dealing here with the bounded domain case with boundary conditions , our computations are slightly different from the ones of @xcite and we are able to prove that the conditions are also sufficient conditions .    indeed , considering equations for all @xmath116 , using that @xmath158 thanks to boundary conditions and using that the flux @xmath102 is consistent , a straightforward induction implies that @xmath159 using condition , we obtain that @xmath157 for all @xmath116 .",
    "therefore , condition is a necessary and sufficient condition to guarantee that the equalities @xmath157 for all @xmath116 are unique solutions of equations .",
    "now , let us show that hll , hll - roe and suliciu with vacuum fluxes satisfy conditions .",
    "we assume in the following that the functions @xmath6 and @xmath160 are increasing , as satisfied by the pressure we consider here",

    "( 2.111 ) in bouchut s book @xcite and we can compute @xmath161 with @xmath162 and @xmath163 , that is to say @xmath164 which satisfies clearly conditions .    * hll - roe flux . * in @xcite , we can find a version of the hll flux adapted to vacuum . in that case , @xmath161 with @xmath165 and @xmath166 , where @xmath167 , that is to say @xmath168 from this expression , we conclude easily that hll - roe flux satisfies conditions .",
    "now , we consider the equation @xmath99 . on the one hand , in the case @xmath177 , @xmath178",
    "since the right - hand side of the last equation is the sum of two positive terms , it is straightforward that they are both null and that @xmath179 , which leads to @xmath180 . on the other hand , in the case @xmath181 , @xmath182 this equation",

    "<S> we consider two models which were both designed to describe the movement of eukaryotic cells responding to chemical signals . besides a common standard parabolic equation for the diffusion of a chemoattractant , like chemokines or growth factors , </S>",
