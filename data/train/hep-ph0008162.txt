    "branching processes are widely used in high energy physics  @xcite . for example , the well known furry - yule and negative binomial distributions occur in simple branching processes with allowed transition @xmath0 .",
    "the use of processes with higher order transitions @xmath1 with @xmath2 is rare due to the absence of explicit solutions in terms of elementary functions . in this paper",
    "we describe the solution for processes with higher order transitions using a recently found recursive procedure for the pure birth branching process@xcite .",
    "the solution is based on the use of the koenigs function@xcite and the functional schrder equation@xcite , sometimes called the schrder - koenigs equation ( for a detailed description and extensive bibliography see  @xcite ) . in section  2",
    "we describe the solution@xcite for the pure birth branching process . in sections 3 and 4 , respectively , the procedures for non - critical branching processes and branching processes with immigration are outlined .",
    "the results are summarized in the last section .",
    "a branching process with continuous evolution parameter @xmath3 is determined by the rates @xmath4 for the transition ( `` splitting '' ) of one particle into @xmath5 particles with all particles subsequently evolving independently . for a pure birth branching process @xmath6 .",
    "the probability distribution @xmath7 for the process having one particle at @xmath8 with @xmath9 is a solution of the forward kolmogorov equation  @xcite @xmath10 for the probability generating function @xmath11 with @xmath12 and with @xmath13 .",
    "the taylor expansion of equation  ( [ eq:1 ] ) leads to the following system of equations for the probabilities @xmath14 @xmath15 and for arbitrary @xmath5 @xmath16 a simple interpretation of the equation ( [ eq:5 ] ) is as follows : let us consider the state with @xmath5 particles at the moment t. the change in this state is due to the arrival from states with multiplicity lower than @xmath5 and to the departure to states with higher multiplicity .",
    "the arrival rate from the state with @xmath17 particles is proportional to the number of particles @xmath17 , to the transition rate ( for one particle ) to produce @xmath18 new particles , i.e. @xmath19 , and to the population density in the state @xmath17 , the sum in the equation ( [ eq:5 ] ) goes over all states below @xmath5 .",
    "the departure rate is proportional to the total transition rate ( for one particle ) @xmath20 , to the number of particles @xmath5 in this state and to the population density , this explains second term in the equation ( [ eq:5 ] ) .",
    "formally this system of equations is valid for any initial condition .",
    "let us recall the recursive solution of the equations ( 4)-(7 ) given in @xcite : the probability @xmath21 is @xmath22 and @xmath23 with the following recursion for the coefficients @xmath24 @xmath25 here @xmath26 is the relative probability to produce @xmath27 new particles .",
    "the recursion starts from @xmath28 and the coefficient @xmath29 can be found from the initial condition @xmath30 for the case with n initial particles with @xmath31 , the first n-1 equations are automatically valid since @xmath32 and the solution in this case has the following form : @xmath33 and @xmath34 with the same recursion as ( [ eq:8 ] ) for the coefficients @xmath35 @xmath36 this recursion starts from @xmath37 and the coefficient @xmath38 can be found from the relation @xmath39 one can calculate the coefficients @xmath40 using the concept of the koenigs function  @xcite . for the branching process starting from one particle at @xmath8 this function",
    "is defined as the limit @xmath41 @xmath42 has the following taylor expansion : @xmath43 for the branching process starting from n particles the koenigs function is defined analogously : @xmath44 the recursion ( [ eq:14 ] ) leads to the following recurrence for the coefficients @xmath45  : @xmath46 let us denote @xmath47 , then @xmath48 and @xmath49 is given by the following recursion @xmath50 it is evident from the equation ( [ eq:20 ] ) that the @xmath51 is a polynomial of order @xmath5 in @xmath52 .",
    "the @xmath53 in terms of @xmath49 is equal to @xmath54 .",
    "the remarkable property of the koenigs function is that it satisfies the functional schrder equation : @xmath55 it is convenient to introduce the function @xmath56 the inverse of the koenigs function . then the equation ( [ eq:21 ] )",
    "gives the functional relations @xmath57 and @xmath58 .",
    "the coefficients of the taylor expansion for @xmath59 can be found using the following relation ( see appendix  b in @xcite and references therein ) : @xmath60 in terms of @xmath49 it gives @xmath61 finally , comparison of equation ( [ eq:13 ] ) with the taylor expansion in @xmath52 of the @xmath62 leads to the following expression for the coefficients @xmath40 : @xmath63",
    "in this case the absorption coefficient @xmath64 is not equal to zero and the function @xmath65 ( [ eq:2 ] ) has an additional term @xmath66 .",
    "let us denote by @xmath67 the smallest positive , different from unity root of the equation @xmath68 .",
    "branching processes with @xmath69 are called supercritical branching processes and processes with @xmath70 are called subcritical ones .",
    "the solution for the supercritical branching processes is obtained in the following way .",
    "let us transform @xmath71 and @xmath52 to @xmath72 and @xmath73 by the linear transform @xmath74 this transform moves the root @xmath67 to zero . then the forward kolmogorov equation ( [ eq:1 ] ) for the process with absorption transforms to the form for the pure birth branching process .",
    "therefore one can introduce the koenigs function with @xmath75 where @xmath76  .",
    "this leads to the expression for the @xmath77 @xmath78 and to the infinite series in @xmath79 for the probabilities @xmath14 @xmath80    the solution for the subcritical branching processes ( @xmath81 ) can be obtained in a similar way . in this case",
    "the linear transform should move 1 to zero and @xmath67 to 1 , i.e. @xmath82 .",
    "this leads to the similar expressions @xmath83 and @xmath84    the procedures described above are not suitable for critical branching processes with @xmath85 . in simplest case without higher order transitions the probability generating",
    "function @xmath77 is a linear fraction with coefficients having linear dependence on @xmath3 ( instead of @xmath86 dependence for non - critical processes ) . in general case with higher order transitions",
    "the interplay between @xmath3 and @xmath86 dependences leads to more complex equations .",
    "for the branching processes with immigration there is an additional external source of particles appearing in clusters of @xmath17 particles with the differential rates @xmath87 ( @xmath88 ) .",
    "the generating function for the process starting with zero particles at @xmath8 can be written  @xcite as @xmath89 with @xmath90 where @xmath91 is the solution for the underlying branching process without immigration . for the underlying pure birth branching process , equation ( [ eq:32 ] )",
    "leads to the following expression @xmath92 with @xmath93 let us denote @xmath94 then the final probability @xmath95 . the coefficients @xmath96 can be calculated using the recursive relation : @xmath97 this relation is known in combinatorics and is used , for example , in the study of combinants@xcite .",
    "in this paper we have derived explicit expressions for the probability distributions in various branching processes .",
    "although we have not derived closed expressions for the polynomials @xmath49 , the given recursions can serve as a calculational tool both in theoretical and experimental studies .",
