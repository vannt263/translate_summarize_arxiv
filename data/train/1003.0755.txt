    "dynamics of self - propelled objects have attracted much attention recently as a fundamental subject of statistical physics far from equilibrium . historically , self - propulsion of flexible body has been formulated in terms of hydrodynamics at low reynolds number @xcite . in that circumstance ,",
    "viscous force is so large that the particle needs to keep non - reciprocal deformation of its shape for the persistent centroid motion @xcite .",
    "swimming microorganisms are the typical examples @xcite .",
    "shape deformation causes the center - of - mass motion in this case .    besides the development along this line",
    ", another class of self - propelled particles or domains is known in which the persistent motion can be maintained due to a broken symmetry of their interfaces . in this case , interfacial forces are playing important roles .",
    "experimental examples are seen in self - propelled oil droplets in water which contains surfactant molecules @xcite , and self - propelled motions of vesicles in which chemical reactions take place @xcite .",
    "synthetic self - propelled systems also make a conversion of chemical energy into directed motion @xcite in these systems , one notes that shape deformation or asymmetry of chemical components around the domain is associated with the self - propelled motion .",
    "for example , an oily droplet in surfactant solution , which is spherical in a motionless situation becomes a banana shape when it undergoes a straight motion .",
    "eukaryotic cells such as amoebas or fibloblast change their shape during migration .",
    "therefore , the coupling between the motion and the shape deformation is one of the most important properties to understand the dynamics of self - propulsion from a unified point of view @xcite .    from the above consideration",
    ", one may divide the self - propelled dynamics into two classes .",
    "one is the case that deformation is induced by the migration and the other is that the motion of the center of gravity is induced by the shape deformations .",
    "the oily droplets are a typical example of the former whereas almost all of the living cells belong to the latter .    in this letter",
    ", we consider two model systems for self - propelled dynamics in two dimensions .",
    "one is called a tensor model in terms of the velocity of the center of gravity and two tensor variables for deformation .",
    "the coupled set of equations are given by symmetry consideration and therefore they are quite general independent of any specific details of the self - propelled objects @xcite .",
    "we shall show that this model is applied , by changing the parameters , to both the deformation - induced motion and the motion - induced deformation .",
    "the other model is represented in the form of a partial differential equation for a eucledian invariant variable of a closed loop .",
    "the condition of a self - propulsion is added , which is expressed in terms of a local deformation .",
    "therefore this model is inherently a model for deformation - induced motion . by solving these two different model equations numerically ,",
    "we explore possible universal and/or non - universal behaviors of self - propelled dynamics .",

    "moreover , we note the difference of the zigzag motions in the two models .",
    "the zig - zag motion with the angle about @xmath101 has been obtained in the tensor model .",
    "this is attributed to the fact that only the second and the third modes are considered in the tensor model so that the deformation with three fold symmetry is possible which triggers the @xmath101 zigzag motion . in the active cell model ,",
    "on the other hand , more complicated zigzag motion with the angle about @xmath169 and @xmath170 appears as in figs . [ zigzag4](c ) and ( d ) where @xmath171 is close to 4 .",
    "therefore , it is expected that higher modes such as the fourth mode are dominant for the zig - zag motion in the active cell model .",
    "we emphasize that the rectangular motion , the @xmath101 zigzag motion and an apparently chaotic motion have been observed in real experiments of amoebas @xcite .",
    "therefore the present approach based on the symmetry argument to construct the time - evolution equations captures the essential feature of the coupling between the shape and the motion of a self - propelled domain .",

    "<S> we investigate the dynamical coupling between the motion and the deformation of a single self - propelled domain based on two different model systems in two dimensions . </S>",
    "<S> one is represented by the set of ordinary differential equations for the center of gravity and two tensor variables characterizing deformations . </S>",
    "<S> the other is an active cell model which has an internal mechanism of motility and is represented by the partial differential equation for deformations . </S>",
    "<S> numerical simulations show a rich variety of dynamics , some of which are common to the two model systems . the origin of the similarity and the difference is discussed . </S>"
