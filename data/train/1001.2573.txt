    "motivated by the world s ever increasing need for cleaner burning fuels and more viable forms of renewable energy , hydrogen production via photocatalysis has been intensely researched as a possible candidate for addressing these issues . since the first experimental formation of hydrogen by photocatalysis in the early 1980s  @xcite ,",
    "tio@xmath0 has been the catalyst of choice .",
    "reasons for this include the position of tio@xmath0 s conduction band above the energy of hydrogen formation , the relatively long lifetime of excited electrons which allows them to reach the surface from the bulk , tio@xmath0 s high corrosion resistance compared to other metal oxides , and its relatively low cost @xcite .",
    "however , the large band gap of bulk tio@xmath0 ( @xmath4 3 ev ) means that only high energy uv light may excite its electrons .",
    "this effectively blocks most of the photons which pierce the atmosphere , typically in the visible range , from participating in any bulk tio@xmath0 based photocatalytic reaction . on the other hand ,",
    "the difference in energy between excited electrons and holes , i.e. the band gap , must be large enough ( @xmath5 1.23 ev ) to dissociate water into hydrogen and oxygen . for these reasons",
    "it is of great interest to adjust the band gap @xmath6 of tio@xmath0 into the range 1.23 @xmath7 2.5 ev , while maintaining the useful properties mentioned above @xcite .    with this aim",
    ", much research has been done on the influence of tio@xmath0 nanostructure  @xcite and dopants @xcite on photocatalytic activity . for low dimensional nanostructured materials , electrons and holes",
    "have to travel shorter distances to reach the surface , allowing for a shorter quasi - particle lifetime . however , due to quantum confinement effects , lower dimensional tio@xmath0 nanostructures tend to have _ larger _ band gaps @xcite . on the other hand , although doping may introduce mid - gap states , recent experimental studies have shown that boron and nitrogen doping of bulk tio@xmath0 yields band gaps _ smaller _ than the threshold for water splitting @xcite .",
    "this suggests that low dimensional structures with band gaps larger than about 3.0 ev may be a better starting point for doping .",
    "the experimental synthesis and characterization of nanostructured materials is in general a costly and difficult task . on the other hand ,",
    "modern electronic structure modelling has reached a level where large - scale calculations can provide realistic descriptions of structure and electronic properties .",
    "based on our investigation , we suggest as a promising candidate small ( @xmath8 5  ) tio@xmath0 nanotubes , with a hexagonal abc pto@xmath0 structure ( hexabc ) , which we find to be surprisingly stable , even in the boron and nitrogen doped forms .",
    "this stability may be attributed to their structural similarity to bulk rutile tio@xmath0 , with the smallest nanotube having the same structure as a rutile nanorod .",
    "a further difficulty for any photocatalytic system is controlling how electrons and holes travel through the system @xcite .",
    "for this reason , methods for reliably producing both @xmath2-type and @xmath3-type tio@xmath0 semiconducting materials are highly desirable .",
    "so far , doped tio@xmath0 tends to yield only @xmath2-type semiconductors .",

    "we may attribute this increasing disparity to the greater quantum confinement and charge localization in the 1d and 0d systems , which yield greater self - interaction effects .",
    "we find b3lyp gaps also underestimate this effect , simply increasing the rpbe energy gaps for both 0d and 3d systems up by about 1.4 ev .    on the other hand , we find the rpbe gaps reproduce qualitatively the structural dependence of the @xmath65 , gw , and experimental results for a given dimensionality , up to a constant shift .",
    "this is true even for 3d bulk systems , where standard dft does not predict rutile to be the most stable @xcite , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] .    whether calculated using rpbe , @xmath69 or gw ,",
    "the energy gaps for both boron and nitrogen doped tio@xmath9 nanostructures are generally narrowed , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3](b ) and ( c ) .",
    "however , for nitrogen doped ( tio@xmath0)@xmath70 clusters where nitrogen acts as an acceptor ( @xmath71 ) , the energy gap is actually _ increased _ when spin is conserved , compared to the undoped clusters in rpbe .",
    "this effect is not properly described by the @xmath72 transitions of @xmath69 , for which spin is not conserved for these nitrogen doped clusters . on the other hand , when nitrogen acts as a donor ( @xmath73 ) the smallest gap between energy levels does conserve spin .",
    "the boron doped tio@xmath9 nanorods and nanotubes have perhaps the most promising energy gap results of the tio@xmath9 structures considered herein , as seen in fig .",
    "[ 1d_dos](b ) .",
    "boron dopants introduce in the nanorods localized occupied states near the conduction band edge in both rpbe ( _ cf .",
    "_ figs .  [ 1d_dos ] and [ 1d_structures ] ) and gw ( _ cf . _ fig .  [ 1d_dos_gw ] )",
    "calculations . on the other hand ,",
    "nitrogen doping of nanorods and nanotubes introduces well defined mid - gap states , as shown in fig .",
    "[ 1d_dos](c ) . however , to perform water dissociation , the energy of the excited electron must be above that for hydrogen evolution , with respect to the vacuum level .",
    "this is not the case for such a mid - gap state .",
    "this opens the possibility of a second excitation from the mid - gap state to the conduction band",
    ". however , the cross section for such an excitation may be rather low .    for boron doping of 2d and 3d structures , the highest occupied state donates its electron almost entirely to the conduction band , yielding an @xmath2-type semiconductor .",
    "thus at very low temperatures , the rpbe band gap is very small .",
    "the same is true for @xmath2-type nitrogen doped bulk anatase . for these reasons",
    ", we also provide the energy gap between the highest fully occupied state and the conduction band , which may be more relevant for photoabsorption .",
    "we find these rpbe gaps are still generally smaller than those for their undoped tio@xmath9 counterparts .    in summary , for both boron and nitrogen doped clusters we find",
    "rpbe gaps differ from @xmath65 by about 3 ev , while for nitrogen doped anatase the rpbe gap differs from experiment by about 0.6 ev . given the common shift of 1 ev for undoped 2d and 3d structures , this suggests that both boron and nitrogen doped 2d tio@xmath0 structures are promising candidates for photocatalysis .",
    "further , the boron and nitrogen doped 1d nanotube results also warrant further experimental investigation .",
    "in conclusion , we have demonstrated how the electronic properties of tio@xmath0 may be `` tailored '' using nanostructural changes in combination with boron and nitrogen doping . while boron doping tends to produce smaller band gap @xmath2-type semiconductors , nitrogen doping produces @xmath3-type or @xmath2-type semiconductors depending on whether or not nearby oxygen atoms occupy surface sites .",
    "this suggests that a @xmath3-type tio@xmath0 semiconductor may be produced using nitrogen doping in conjunction with surface confinement at the nanoscale .",
