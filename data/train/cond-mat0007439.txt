    "magnetic frustration resulting from the competing coexistence of ferromagnetic double - exchange ( de ) and antiferromagnetic superexchange interaction , is present in colossal magneto - resistance ( cmr ) materials .",
    "recently , frustration related effects have been observed in the cmr ferromagnet @xmath6 @xcite ; also , a reentrant spin - glass ( rsg ) phase has been evidenced in @xmath7 @xcite using relaxation measurements . in a recent paper @xcite , sg - like",
    "behavior has been advocated in @xmath0 from a cusp at @xmath8 k in the @xmath9 curve and a corresponding frequency dependence in the ac susceptibility . in the present work ,",
    "we have performed low - field magnetic relaxation and associated temperature cycling measurements at temperatures above and below the @xmath9 maximum .",
    "the relaxation of the low - frequency ac susceptibility is also studied to investigate memory effects in the two temperature regions .",
    "below @xmath10 the system exhibits features of a true sg state .",
    "however , long - time relaxation and aging effects are still found at higher temperatures , well above @xmath10 .",
    "additional magnetic hysteresis measurements reveal ferromagnetic short - range correlations below @xmath11 , suggesting the existence of clusters of ferromagnetic order .",
    "memory effects are observed in both regions .",
    "the @xmath0 ( ycmo ) compound was prepared by standard solid state reaction .",
    "after sintering at 1300@xmath12 c , the mixture was annealed in oxygen at 1000 , 800 , and 600@xmath12 c for several days at each temperature .",
    "the final product was characterized by x - ray diffraction technique showing a single phase of orthorhombic structure .",
    "the xrd measurements were performed at room temperature using a siemens d5000 diffractometer with cuk@xmath13 radiation ( @xmath14=1.5406  ) and a scanning step of 0.02@xmath12 .",
    "the sample was first mixed with high - purity si powder for standard angular calibration . as seen in the diffractogram presented in fig .",
    "[ fig0 ] , which includes the si peaks , the ycmo reflections can be indexed according to an orthorhombic structure .",
    "the obtained lattice parameters are a=5.528  , b=7.441  , and c=5.293  , in agreement with earlier results@xcite .",
    "no secondary phases or impurities were detected .",
    "+ the temperature dependence of the zero - field - cooled ( zfc ) , field - cooled ( fc ) and thermo - remanent ( trm ) magnetization , as well as the relaxation of zfc magnetization @xmath15 and temperature cycling measurements @xcite were made in a non - commercial low field squid system @xcite ; the background field of which is less than 1 moe . in the relaxation experiments ,",
    "the sample was rapidly cooled in zero field from a reference temperature of 80 k to a measuring temperature @xmath16 and kept there a wait time @xmath17 .",
    "after the wait time , a small probing field @xmath18 was applied and @xmath15 was recorded as a function of the time elapsed after the field application . in the temperature cycling measurements , just after the wait time and immediately prior to the application of the probing field , the sample was additionally subjected to a temperature cycle @xmath19 of duration @xmath20 . using the same squid system ,",
    "low - frequency ac susceptibility experiments were used to investigate memory phenomena . + additional `` high field '' measurements were performed in a commercial quantum design mpms5 squid magnetometer ( curie weiss behavior and arrot plots ) and a lakeshore 7225 susceptometer ( ac susceptibility in large superimposed dc - fields ) .",
    "figure [ fig1 ] presents the @xmath21 , @xmath22 , and @xmath23 curves measured at an applied field of 0.1 oe .",
    "@xmath9 exhibits a maximum at @xmath24 k in agreement with a previously reported result @xcite .",
    "the inset shows the zfc and fc curves for 0.1 and 0.5 oe ; a substantial suppression of @xmath22 is seen , whereas @xmath21 is virtually unaffected by the increased field strength . as demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ fig2](a ) , a curie - weiss behavior is observed at temperatures above @xmath25 k. @xmath26 appears nonzero below @xmath11 and both @xmath9 and @xmath27 deviate from curie - weiss behavior suggesting an establishment of ferromagnetic correlations related to the double - exchange mechanism .",
    "however , our @xmath28 measurements in applied fields up to 3 t and the corresponding arrot plots ( fig . [ fig2](b ) ) show no indication of spontaneous magnetization .",
    "these results imply that the ferromagnetism appearing below @xmath11 is of short - range order , i.e. clusters of short - range fm correlations develop below @xmath11 .",
    "similar magnetic properties have previously been reported for @xmath29 wherein short - range ferromagnetic correlations above @xmath10 were evidenced from magnetic and small - angle neutron scattering measurements @xcite . + it is observed in our @xmath15 measurements that @xmath0 exhibits logarithmically slow dynamics at all temperatures below @xmath11 .",
    "the system does not reach equilibrium on time scales up to @xmath2 s even at temperatures far above @xmath10 .",
    "furthermore , together with the long - time relaxation , aging effects @xcite can also be seen not only below but also well above @xmath10 .",
    "[ fig3 ] displays the relaxation rates @xmath30 derived from the zfc @xmath15 curves recorded at ( a ) @xmath31 and ( b ) @xmath32 ; @xmath33 oe and @xmath34=0s ( 10s ) and 3000s .",
    "the figure shows that @xmath35 attains a characteristic aging maximum at an observation time close to @xmath17 , where there exists an inflection point in the corresponding @xmath15 curves ; a similar non - equilibrium behavior has been observed in a variety of frustrated and disordered systems including some other perovskite compounds@xcite . in spin - glasses , the aging effect can be interpreted within the droplet model @xcite by associating the maximum in the relaxation rate to a crossover between a quasi - equilibrium dynamic regime at short observation times ( @xmath36 ) and a non - equilibrium regime at long observation times ( @xmath37 ) .",
    "results from monte carlo simulations for two- and three - dimensional ising spin - glass systems also show that the relaxation rate @xmath35 exhibits a maximum at @xmath38@xcite .",
    "+ the non - equilibrium dynamics observed at temperatures above @xmath10 is probably caused by random dipolar interactions between the ferromagnetic clusters . in this region ,",
    "the relaxation time of the system may remain finite although it is much larger than the time scales employed in our experiments .",
    "in fact , in original sg systems , aging effects are found also at temperatures above @xmath39 at time scales shorter than the maximum relaxation time of the system @xcite .",
    "+ in both two and three dimensional spin glasses , temperature cycling experiments have shown that aging states are virtually unaffected by a negative @xmath19 , while re - initialization occurs for a sufficiently large positive @xmath40 @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , for frustrated ferromagnetic systems , re - initialization occurs irrespective of the sign of @xmath19 @xcite .",
    "this difference can be used to distinguish a spin glass from other frustrated magnets . @xmath35",
    "measured at @xmath41 k with @xmath19=0 , -3 and -5 k and @xmath20=0s are indistinguishable from each other , evidencing spin glass behavior below @xmath10 ; the corresponding experiments above @xmath10 at @xmath42 k give the same result . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ( a ) and ( b ) , if a long wait time @xmath20 is added , a small but noticeable reinitialization occurs , in accordance with the behavior of ordinary spin glasses@xcite .",
    "the spin configuration of the aging state at @xmath43 seems to be frozen in as the temperature is lowered . in the positive cycling experiment one",
    "notices an increase of s(t ) at short time scales indicating re - initialization of the configuration .",
    "+ at @xmath44 ( fig . [ fig4](b ) ) , the @xmath35 curves measured at 45 k with @xmath19=0 , -3 , -5 , and + 5 k look very very similar to the @xmath41 k curves .",
    "the material still exhibits a characteristic sg behavior , strikingly different from the behavior of a reentrant ferromagnetic phase , which could have been anticipated since we observe ferromagnetic ordering above @xmath45 .",
    "however , we deal here with a system that only exhibits short - range ferromagnetic correlation . in passing ,",
    "it is worth noting that the magnitude of the aging is large below @xmath11 , proving the effect to be intrinsic to the material rather than only associated to a possible spin disorder at grain boundaries .",
    "fig . [ fig5 ] shows the ( a ) in - phase and ( b ) out - of - phase components of the ac susceptibility vs. temperature for different frequencies . as seen on fig .",
    "[ fig5](b ) and insert , the ferromagnetic onset is frequency independent .",
    "below @xmath4660k , the out - of - phase component decreases with decreasing frequency . further decreasing the temperature",
    ", there is a frequency dependent maximum in the in - phase component and a corresponding but more pronounced frequency dependence of the out - of phase component . using these data it is possible to define a freezing temperature @xmath45 that decreases with decreasing frequency . employing the position of maximum slope in the out - of - phase component as definition of the freezing temperature at observation time @xmath47=1/@xmath48 , we have analyzed the data according to possible dynamic scaling scenarios .",
    "the physically most plausible parameters were obtained using activated dynamics and a finite critical temperature , @xmath49^\\gamma\\ ] ] with @xmath50=0.87 and @xmath51=28.9k . however , a microscopic relaxation time of order 1 s was encountered . analyzing the data according to conventional critical slowing down@xcite resulted in rather poor fits . also , analyses according to ahrenius or generalized ahrenius slowing down of the dynamics gave no or unphysical parameters .",
    "there are thus strong indications of the existence of a finite phase transition temperature , albeit not necessarily to a conventional low temperature spin glass phase . +",
    "to further characterize the low and high temperature regions , memory effects were investigated both below and above @xmath45 using the relaxation of the out - of phase component of the ac susceptibility .",
    "when cooling from above @xmath11 ( @xmath39 in a conventional sg case ) , a halt at constant temperature @xmath52 is made during @xmath53 , allowing the system to relax towards its equilibrium state at @xmath54 ; both components of the ac susceptibility then decay in magnitude . in spin glasses ,",
    "this equilibrated state becomes frozen in on further lowering the temperature , and is retrieved on re - heating the system to @xmath54 .",
    "the weak low frequency ac - field employed in this kind of experiments does not affect the non - equilibrium processes intrinsic to the sample , but only works as a non - perturbing probe of the system .",
    "a memory effect is here clearly observed , fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] , not only at @xmath55=27k but , surprisingly , also at 45k .",
    "the memory dip appears even more clearly when substrating the references curves as in fig .",
    "[ fig6](b ) .",
    "the insert shows the out - of - phase component of the ac susceptibility recorded vs time at t=27 and 45 k after direct cooling from above @xmath11 .",
    "as already seen in the memory plot , the relaxation is comparably smaller at @xmath56 .",
    "one notices that the measured relaxation at both temperatures is larger than in the memory experiment ; this is because the ac susceptibility in this case was recorded directly after cooling the system from the reference temperature above @xmath11 to the measurement temperature . +",
    "a superimposed dc field affects the ac susceptibility of spin glasses in a peculiar and signifying way .",
    "the in - phase component is significantly suppressed , but only at temperatures above the freezing temperature @xmath57 ; and the onset of the out - of - phase component is suppressed to lower temperatures , but also remains unaffected at lower temperatures@xcite ! in fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] we have plotted @xmath58 in different superposed dc - fields .",
    "[ fig7](a ) , shows that the near-@xmath11 magnitude and onset is fragile with respect to even a weak superimposed dc - field .",
    "@xmath58 is substantially affected by a dc - field of only 1 oe , and is suppressed to lower temperatures already at 5 oe . at lower temperatures around @xmath45",
    "the out - of - phase component remains unaffected by the dc - field . at larger dc - fields , fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] ( b ) shows that also the freezing temperature becomes suppressed , but that the ac susceptibility below @xmath45 remains unaffected in a spin glass like fasion@xcite .",
    "the magnetic response of @xmath0 becomes governed by short range ferromagnetic correlations at temperatures below @xmath59 k. above @xmath10 , a surprisingly sg - like state is observed , featuring aging and memory effects .",
    "the non - equilibrium dynamics above @xmath10 may be attributed to a thermally activated redistribution of ferromagnetically ordered clusters and the random dipolar interaction amongst their magnetic moments .",
    "this state seemingly evolves into a conventional spin - glass state at temperatures below @xmath10 .",
