    "the compass experiment is located in the super proton synchrotron ( sps ) accelerator at cern . for a more complete description of the experimental apparatus the reader",
    "is addressed to @xcite . in 2007 ,",
    "the compass collaboration estimated the quark contribution to the nucleon spin with high precision @xcite , using a nlo qcd fit with all world data available .",
    "this contribution confirms that approximately 1/3 of the nucleon spin is carried by the quarks , as demonstrated by earlier experiments @xcite .",
    "the nucleon spin can be written as : @xmath5    @xmath6 and @xmath7 are , respectively , the quark and gluon contributions to the nucleon spin and @xmath8 is the orbital angular momentum contribution coming from from the quarks and gluons .",
    "the aim of this analysis is to estimate the gluon polarisation , @xmath0 , using the high transverse momentum ( high @xmath1 ) hadron pairs sample .",
    "the analysis is performed in two complementary kinematic regions : @xmath9 ( low @xmath10 ) and @xmath11 ( high @xmath10 ) regions . the present work is mainly focused on the analysis for high @xmath10 .",
    "however , the analysis for the low @xmath10 region is summarised in sec .",
    "[ sec : lowq2 ] .    for completeness , the slides of the presentation can be found in @xcite .",
    "spin - dependent effects can be measured experimentally using the helicity asymmetry    @xmath12    defined as the ratio of polarised ( @xmath13 ) and unpolarised ( @xmath14 ) cross sections . @xmath15 and",
    "@xmath16 refer to the parallel and anti - parallel spin helicity configuration of the beam lepton ( @xmath17 ) with respect to the target nucleon ( @xmath18 or @xmath19 ) .    according to the factorisation theorem ,",
    "the ( polarised ) cross sections can be written as the convolution of the ( polarised ) parton distribution functions , ( @xmath20)@xmath21 , the hard scattering partonic cross section , ( @xmath20)@xmath22 , and the fragmentation function @xmath23 .",
    "r10 cm    the gluon polarisation is measured directly via the photon - gluon fusion process ( pgf ) ; which allows to probe the spin of the gluon inside the nucleon . to tag this process directly in dis",
    "a high @xmath1 hadron pairs data sample is used to calculate the helicity asymmetry .",
    "two other processes compete with the pgf process in leading order qcd approximation , namely the virtual photo - absorption leading order ( lo ) process and the gluon radiation ( qcd compton ) process . in fig .",
    "[ fig : procs ] all contributing processes are depicted .    the helicity asymmetry for the high @xmath1 hadron pairs data sample",
    "can thus be schematically written as : @xmath24    the @xmath25 ( the index @xmath26 refers to the different processes ) are the fractions of each process .",
    "@xmath27 represents the partonic cross section asymmetries , @xmath28 , ( also known as analysing power ) .",
    "@xmath29 is the depolarisation factor  .",
    "the virtual photon asymmetry @xmath30 is defined as @xmath31 .    to extract @xmath0 from eq .",
    "( [ eq : allmain ] ) the contribution from the physical background processes lo and qcd compton needs to be estimated .",
    "this is done using monte carlo ( mc ) simulation to calculate @xmath25 fractions and @xmath27 .",
    "the virtual photon asymmetry @xmath30 is estimated using a parametrisation based on the @xmath32 asymmetry of the inclusive data @xcite",
    ". therefore a similar equation to ( [ eq : allmain ] ) can be written to express the inclusive asymmetry of a data sample , @xmath33 .",

    "data from 2002 to 2004 years is used .",
    "the selected events have an interation vertex containing an incoming muon beam and a scattered muon . as mentioned in sec .",
    "[ sec : analysis ] the data samples are divided into two data sets : the high @xmath1 hadron pairs and the inclusive data samples .",
    "both data sets have the @xmath44 kinematic cut applied .",
    "another cut is applied on the fraction of energy taken by the virtual photon , @xmath45 : @xmath46 .",
    "these cuts described previously are used to select the _",
    "inclusive sample_.    in the high @xmath1 hadrons data sample , besides the inclusive selection , events with ( at least ) two outgoing high @xmath47 hadrons are considered .",
    "these so - called hadron candidates must fulfill the following requirement : the two hadrons with the highest transverse momentum must have @xmath48 . this requirement constitutes the high @xmath1 cut .",
    "all these cuts additionally correspond to the _ high @xmath1 sample _ selection .",
    "important information to be used in the @xmath0 extraction is obtained from mc simulation . in this analysis",
    "it is fundamental that the simulation describes well the experimental data .",
    "two mc samples were produced : one for the high @xmath1 sample and another for the inclusive sample , to estimate the terms in the set of eq .",
    "( [ eq : form : betas ] ) .",
    "r12 cm                            the mc production comprises three steps : first the events are generated , then the particles pass through a simulated spectrometer using a program based on geant3 @xcite and finally the events are reconstructed using the same procedure applied to real data .    for the first step the lepto 6.5 @xcite event generator",
    "is used together with a leading order parametrisation of the unpolarised parton distributions .",
    "the mrst04lo set of parton distributions is used in a fixed - flavour scheme generation .",
    "this set of parton distributions has a good description of @xmath49 in the compass kinematic region .",
    "nlo corrections are simulated partially by including gluon radiation in the initial and final states ( parton shower ",
    ".    the fragmentation is based on the lund string model @xcite implemented in jetset @xcite . in this model",
    "the probability that a fraction @xmath50 of the available energy will be carried by a newly created hadron is expressed by the lund symmetric function @xmath51 , with @xmath52 , where @xmath53 is the hadron mass .    to improve the agreement between mc and data , the parameters ( @xmath54,@xmath55 ) in the fragmentation function",
    "are modified from their default values ( 0.3,0.58 ) to ( 0.6 , 0.1 ) .",
    "the transverse momentum of the hadrons , @xmath1 , at the fragmentation level is given by the sum of the @xmath1 of each hadron quarks .",
    "then the @xmath1 of the newly created hadrons is described by three steering paramrters jetset parameters : parj(21 ) , parj(23 ) and parj(24 ) .",
    "the default values of these three parameters are ( 0.36 , 0.01 , 2.0 ) , and were modified to ( 0.30 , 0.02 , 3.5 ) .    the remarkable agreement of the mc simulation with the data is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : mc ] ; this figure shows the data ",
    "mc comparison of the kinematic variables : @xmath56 , @xmath45 and @xmath10 ( 1st row ) , the hadronic variables , @xmath1 for the leading and sub - leading hadrons , together with the sum of @xmath57 , i.e. @xmath58 ( 2nd row ) , and the momentum @xmath59 of those hadrons ( 3rd row ) , also two comparisons of the @xmath60 variable one using the compass tuning and another using the default lepto tuning . in this example , it is evident that the compass tuning describes better our data sample than the lepto default one .",
    "in the original idea of the high @xmath1 analysis , the selection was based on a very tight set of cuts to suppress lo and qcd compton .",
    "this situation results in a dramatic loss of statistics .",
    "a new approach was found , in which a loose set of cuts applied , combined with the use of a neural network @xcite to assign a probability to each event to be originated from each of the three processes .",
    "the main goal of this method is to enhance the pgf process in the events sample , which accounts for the gluon contribution to the nucleon spin .",
    "the neural network is trained using mc samples . in this way",
    "the neural network is able to learn about the three processes in order to be disentangled .",
    "a parametrisation of the variables @xmath25 , @xmath61 and @xmath62 for each process type are estimated by the neural network using as input the kinematic variables : @xmath56 and @xmath63 , and the hadronic variables : @xmath64 , @xmath65 , @xmath66 , and @xmath67 .",
    "r10 cm         as the fractions of the three processes sum up to unity , we need two variables to parameterise them : @xmath68 and @xmath69 . the relations between the two neural network outputs @xmath70 and @xmath71 and the fraction are @xmath72 , @xmath73 and @xmath74 .",
    "a statistical weight is constructed for each event based on these probabilities . in this way",
    "we do not need to remove events that most likely do not came from pgf processe , because the weight will naturally reduce their contribution in the gluon polarisation , thus enhancing the sample of events thathave a pgf likelihood .",
    "the resulting neural network outputs for the fractions are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : form:2dsel ] in a 2-dimensional plot .",
    "the triangle limits the region where all fractions are positive . for the inclusive sample",
    "the average value of @xmath69 is quite large , which means that the lo process is the dominant one .",
    "the situation is different for the high @xmath47 sample , in which the average outputs are @xmath75 0.5 and @xmath76 0.35 .",
    "note also that the spread along @xmath71 is larger than along @xmath68 .",
    "this means that the neural network is able to select a region where the contribution of pgf and qcdc is significant compared to lo , although it can not easily distinguish between the pgf and qcdc processes themselves .",
    "r8 cm                the reason for splitting the @xmath10 range in two complementary regions is that for the low @xmath10 region the resolved photon contributions are considerably higher ( @xmath77 ) than in the high @xmath10 region , which contains practically only the three processes previously mentioned .",
    "this means that the qcd hard scale is also different for both @xmath10 regions : for low @xmath10 the scale is given by the high @xmath1 hadrons , while for the high @xmath10 is given by the @xmath10 value itself .",
    "a more complicated description of the physics than pure qcd in lowest order needs to be included in the mc simulation for this case .",
    "therefore the event generator used in this analysis is pythia 6.2 @xcite which covers the physiscal processes for quasi - real photoproduction .    in this analysis",
    "the selection is essentially the same as in high @xmath10 region plus a slightly strict set of cuts : @xmath78 , @xmath79 , and @xmath80 .",
    "the data sample in this region is 90 % of the whole data for all @xmath10 range .",
    "the weighting method used in the high @xmath10 analysis is not applied in this case .",
    "the mc simulated and real data samples of high @xmath47 events are compared in fig .",
    "[ fig : lowq2mcrealcomp ] for @xmath10 , @xmath45 ( 1st row ) , and for the total and transverse momenta of the high @xmath1 hadron ( 2nd row ) , showing a good agreement .",
    "the gluon polarisation in the low @xmath10 region is extracted using averaged values as shown by this expression :    @xmath81    @xmath82 is the fraction of events in the high @xmath47 sample for which a parton @xmath83 from the nucleon interacts with a parton @xmath84 from a resolved photon ; @xmath32 is the virtual photon deuteron asymmetry measured in an inclusive sample ; @xmath85 ( @xmath86 ) is the polarisation of quarks or gluons in the deuteron ( photon ) .",
    "this analysis was performed using a data sample from the years 2002 to 2004 . for more details about this analysis",
    "the reader is invited to look into ref .",
    "the preliminary measurements of the gluon polarisation in low and high @xmath10 regions , using data from the years 2002 to 2004 , are :    @xmath87    the average of the hard scale , @xmath88 , for low and high @xmath10 is about 3 @xmath89 .",
    "@xmath90 is the momentum fraction carried by the probed gluons obtained from the mc parton kinematics .",
    "the result of the measurement for low @xmath10 using data from 2002 and 2003 can be found in  @xcite .",
    "r8 cm        fig .",
    "[ fig : dgg ] shows these new values of @xmath0 together with the preliminary value from the open charm analysis .",
    "also the figure shows the measurements from smc collaboration , from the high @xmath1 analysis for the @xmath91 region @xcite and also the measurements from hermes collaboration , for single hadrons and high @xmath1 hadron pairs analyses @xcite .",
    "the curves in the figure are the parametrisation of @xmath92 using a nlo qcd analysis done by compass @xcite in the @xmath93 scheme with a renormalisation scale @xmath94 .",
    "the dashed line curve is the qcd fit assuming that @xmath95 , the dotted line is the qcd fit assuming @xmath96 .",
    "it is seen that both results from high @xmath1 analyses , for high and low @xmath10 regions , are compatible with each other and also , within their @xmath90 region , in agreement with the nlo qcd fits .",
    "the preliminary values of the gluon polarisation for low and high @xmath10 regions were presented .",
    "the gluons were probed at an average scale @xmath97 .",
    "both measurements show that the gluon contribution to the nucleon spin for @xmath98 is compatible with zero .",
