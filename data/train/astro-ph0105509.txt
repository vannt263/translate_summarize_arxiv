    "even if it has colors that are the same as the bluest stars in that sample , the reddening would be only @xmath104 . in conclusion",

    "hobbs et al .  (",
    "1986 ) did note the possibility that an unusually high concentration of foreground neutral gas could be responsible for the na absorption towards @xmath90  ari  ab and that the mbm12 cloud could fall at some distance behind the star , which would explain the lack of reddening towards the star .",
    "they considered this an unlikely possibility for the following reasons .",
    "the sun is surrounded by a cavity containing hot ionized gas that extends out to @xmath105  pc , which is known as the local bubble ( cox & reynolds 1987 ) . because the spectroscopic distance of 70  pc used by hobbs et al .",
    "( 1986 ) for @xmath90  ari  ab placed the star within this cavity , it appeared unlikely that a neutral gas cloud of high optical depth would fall in the foreground of the star .",
    "however , the _ hipparcos _ distance to @xmath90  ari  ab is @xmath92  pc , which places it near the wall of the local bubble .",
    "in fact , in a study where _ hipparcos _ distances were combined with na measurements to map the structure of the local bubble , sfeir et al .",
    "( 1999 ) attributed the na absorption for @xmath90  ari  ab to a clump of cold neutral interstellar gas that is possibly associated with the local bubble wall .",
    "a similar scenario was suggested for hd14613 and hd14670 , which also have strong na absorption and are near a clumpy portion of the wall of the local bubble . as with @xmath90  ari  ab , these stars exhibit no reddening in their @xmath98 colors .",
    "given this explanation for the na absorption and the lack of reddening , it is likely that @xmath90  ari  ab and the wall of the local bubble are in the foreground of the mbm12 cloud . as a result , this star can not be used to provide the upper limit to the distance to the cloud .",
    "in fact , because the boundary of the local bubble is mapped by searching for the na absorption that is expected from the interstellar medium beyond the bubble , the presence of na absorption can not be used as evidence that a star is behind a dark cloud if that star is beyond the local bubble , or at distances greater than 90  pc for the direction of mbm12 . in other words , the na absorption detected for the stars beyond 90  pc in figure  [ fig : hip ] could be attributed to the interstellar medium rather than the mbm12 cloud .",
    "therefore , the na absorption measurements provide only a lower limit of @xmath97  pc for the distance to mbm12 .",
    "while na absorption can be produced by both molecular clouds and the neutral gas in the interstellar medium , reddening is by definition a direct tracer of a dark cloud .",
    "i explore two methods that incorporate reddening in measuring the distance to mbm12 .    for the stars near the cloud that have",
    "_ hipparcos _ distances , their foreground or background nature can be examined through their reddenings .",
    "the positions of the 12 stars in the immediate vicinity of the mbm12 cloud on the sky that have _ hipparcos _ distances are plotted in figure  [ fig : map2 ] .",
    "colors in @xmath98 are taken from the _ hipparcos _ database .",

    "hipparcos _ to arrive at @xmath108 colors . an approximate luminosity class ( dwarf or giant ) of each star was inferred from its absolute magnitude .",
    "extinctions are calculated from the @xmath98 and @xmath108 colors by assuming the appropriate intrinsic values expected for the spectral type and luminosity class in question ( see   [ sec : ext ] ) .",
    "the reddenings and distances for the 12 stars are shown on the map in figure  [ fig : map2 ] and are used to construct the diagram of distance vs.  reddening in figure  [ fig : hip ] .",
    "the reddenings among these stars increase with distance in a manner that is consistent with the reddening arising from the interstellar medium ; there is no abrupt increase in reddening that is expected if any of these stars are behind the mbm12 cloud .",
    "the lack of significant reddening towards these stars implies that the cloud has a distance of more than 200 - 250  pc .",
    "however , because the more distant stars in this sample are on the outskirts of the cloud , they could be behind the cloud and yet have fairly low reddenings .",
    "[ sec : dwarfs ]    i now estimate the distance to the mbm12 cloud by using ir and optical photometry to identify background and foreground dwarf stars and then comparing their apparent magnitudes to the absolute magnitudes of nearby dwarfs at comparable spectral types .    for this method to be successful , there must be a range of dwarf spectral types that is distinguishable from all other types through photometry alone , even in the presence of variable reddening .",
    "because of reddening , stars of different spectral types can inhabit the same regions of most color - color and color - magnitude diagrams .",
    "however , in a diagram of @xmath49 vs.  @xmath53 , m dwarfs have positions that are unique from those of other stars , as demonstrated in the top panel of figure  [ fig : riik ] where the colors of the foreground dwarfs and the background giants and early - type stars from the spectroscopic sample are compared .",

    "m dwarfs become well - separated from other stars .",
    "because the path of the latest m dwarfs becomes nearly parallel to the reddening vector in @xmath49 vs.  @xmath53 , their reddenings can not be accurately estimated from this combination of colors .",
    "on the other hand , the extinctions for dwarfs at @xmath111 can be readily determined by dereddening the @xmath49 and @xmath53 colors to the sequence of intrinsic colors represented by the dashed line in figure  [ fig : riik ] .",
    "therefore , through @xmath49 vs.  @xmath53 , dwarfs from @xmath112 to 1.5 ( m1-m4 ) can be separated from stars of other spectral types and have their reddenings estimated .",
    "the lower panel of figure  [ fig : riik ] shows all stars in the images of mbm12 that lack spectra and have @xmath113 and @xmath114 .",
    "stars that are near the m dwarf fit at @xmath112 - 1.5 and that are projected against the higher levels of _ iras _ 100  @xmath82 m emission are likely to be m dwarfs in the foreground of the cloud .",
    "the remaining stars within the reddening band for the m dwarf fit are probably reddened m dwarfs , where those with colors indicative of @xmath115 are very likely to be behind the mbm12 cloud .",
    "the two samples of probable foreground and background m dwarfs can be compared to local m dwarfs in a color - magnitude diagram to constrain the distance to the mbm12 cloud . for this diagram , @xmath49 is selected as the color because it changes significantly from types of m1 to m4 .",
    "the 2mass measurements at @xmath106 are used for the magnitude ; the correction for reddening is small in this band and the availability of 2mass data for both the mbm12 stars and a large number of local m dwarfs enables a reliable comparison among all stars .",
    "the foreground and background dwarfs towards mbm12 are shown in the diagrams of @xmath49 vs.  @xmath106 in figure  [ fig : rik ] .",
    "the data for the background dwarfs have been corrected for the reddenings implied by figure  [ fig : riik ] .",
    "the local field dwarf sample consists of all single m stars from the nasa nstars database ( @xmath116  pc ) for which @xmath49 and 2mass @xmath106 data are available .",
    "the individual distances and @xmath49 colors compiled by nstars and the @xmath106 measurements from 2mass are used to place the stars in this local dwarf sample at distance moduli of 6.7 , 7.2 , and 7.7 in figure  [ fig : rik ] .",
    "if the field dwarfs in the vicinity of mbm12 and those in the solar neighborhood have similar photometric properties , and if the latter are placed at the distance to mbm12 , than the lower envelope of the distribution of dwarfs in the foreground of mbm12 should match the lower envelope of the local m dwarf sequence . at the same time",

    "although the larger revised distance suggests the cloud is more easily bound , these general conclusions may remain unchanged with the larger distance ( zimmerman & ungerechts 1990 ) .",
    "because of its shadow against the diffuse soft x - ray background and its suggested distance of 65  pc , the mbm12 cloud was believed to fall within the local bubble ( snowden , mccammon , & verter 1993 ) . in estimating the size of the local bubble from x - ray data , snowden et al .",

    "as a result , the x - ray shadow towards the mbm12 cloud is probably caused by diffuse emission from a region outside of the local bubble , such as the galactic halo , as observed for other distant clouds ( snowden et al .",

    "the age of mbm12a is constrained through two independent methods in the following discussion .",

    "i have selected four of the nearest associations and clusters that have ages of 10 - 30  myr : @xmath6  cha , twa , hora , and ic  2602 .",
    "the sources of the data for these young associations are described in detail in the appendix .      as young low - mass stars evolve from the birthline ( @xmath7  myr ) to the main sequence ( @xmath105  myr ) , the processes of convection and nuclear burning deplete li at their stellar surfaces .",
    "consequently , the age of a coeval population of stars is reflected in the typical strengths of photospheric li absorption in those stars .",
    "the behavior of li absorption is dependent on both age and effective temperature . at m",
    "spectral types , the li equivalent widths vary from 0.45 - 0.8    at @xmath7  myr ( e.g. , taurus ; basri et al .",

    "1997 ) . for g and k stars ,",
    "the initial li absorption is weaker and the species is not fully depleted even at 100  myr , resulting in a smaller change in observed li strengths with time .",
    "consequently , the diagram of @xmath119 vs.  @xmath120(li ) in figure  [ fig : li ] is useful for comparing the li strengths among mbm12a and the other young populations .",

    "the range of equivalent widths ( 0.4 - 0.65   ) for the m stars in these associations is similar to or slightly less than that observed for taurus .",
    "meanwhile , the li data clearly indicate that mbm12a , @xmath6  cha , and twa are younger than ic  2602 and hora .",
    "the li measurements are consistent with the same age for the latter two populations . however , because the change in li strengths is small from ic  2602 ( 30  myr ) to the pleiades ( 125  myr ) and the number statistics are poor for hora , these li data also allow for an age difference of few tens of millions of years between ic  2602 and hora .",

    "the luminosities and temperatures have been derived in the most uniform fashion that is possible given available data . by then placing these associations on one set of theoretical evolutionary models ( baraffe et al .",

    "will form a locus that has a large range in luminosities at a given temperature .",
    "the dominant sources of this width in the locus are uncertainties in luminosity estimates , variability , and a spread in ages among the cluster members . as a result , when using evolutionary models to infer an age for the population , it is the median or mean age that is generally measured and reported . for a stellar cluster that is older than 5 - 10  myr , the lack of reddening and circumstellar excess emission allows more accurate luminosity estimates , accretion - related variability is not present , and typical age spreads of a few million years correspond to negligible ranges of luminosities . instead",
    ", the largest contributor to the width of the locus for an older cluster is expected to be unresolved binaries that appear as overly luminous single stars .",
    "therefore , for older populations the age is measured from the sequence of single stars that forms the lower envelope of the locus rather than from the median of the locus .",
    "this approach is clearly applicable to ic  2602 .",
    "because of the lack of excess emission near the bands from which the luminosities are computed and the low level of reddening for stars in @xmath6  cha and mbm12a , unresolved binarity could be the source of the spread in luminosities of their sequences as well .",
    "in fact , the presence of double h@xmath14 emission profiles for some of the brighter members of mbm12a and @xmath6  cha suggests that they may be binaries ( jayawardhana et al .",

    "2000 ) , 2 - 3 brown dwarfs ( @xmath139  @xmath0 ) are expected in mbm12a where none were found .",
    "although this difference between mbm12a and the trapezium is not significant by itself , it is consistent with the deficit of brown dwarfs observed for taurus ( luhman 2000 ) , which has similar star - forming conditions as mbm12 .",

    "there are a total of 11 young sources that are resolved in normal ground - based imaging ( @xmath140 ) towards the mbm12 cloud and an additional star @xmath141 away towards mbm13 that is probably associated with mbm12a .",
    "i identify a few additional candidate members of mbm12a that have not been observed spectroscopically .",
    "i have used optical and ir photometry to identify stars that are likely to be m dwarfs in the foreground and background of the mbm12 cloud . by comparing the magnitudes of these stars to those of local field dwarfs ,",
    "the distance modulus to the cloud is constrained to be @xmath3 ( 275  pc ) .",
    "mbm12 is not the nearest molecular cloud and is not inside the local bubble of hot ionized gas as had been implied by previous distance estimates of 50 - 100  pc .",
    "if the mbm12 cloud were at 65  pc as previously reported , its associated t  tauri stars would fall near the main sequence ( @xmath121  myr ) .",

    "the reddenings , radial velocities , and locations of the young stars relative to one another and to those of the mbm12 cloud combined with the coevality of the stars on the h - r diagram are compelling evidence that these stars comprise an association and that it originated from the cloud .",
    "most of the young stars in taurus are located in loose aggregates of 10 - 20 young stars within the dark clouds ( gmez et al .",
    "similarly , the mbm12a stars form a small , sparse group around the mbm12 cloud . however , compared to the taurus sites , the mbm12 cloud is less opaque ( @xmath47 - 10 vs.  @xmath143 ) and the stars are less reddened ( @xmath11 - 2 vs.  @xmath11 - 10 ) , have more evolved disks and appear to be slightly older on the h - r diagram ( 2  myr vs.  1  myr ) , and have a lower space density ( @xmath144  pc@xmath145 vs.  @xmath146 - 10  pc@xmath145 ) .",
    "in addition , the mbm12 cloud may be gravitationally unbound and in the process of dispersing following the episode of star formation that created its associated young stars .",

    "luhman ( 1999 ) found that the intrinsic @xmath49 colors of young stars at m4-m5 types are slightly bluer than the dwarf values , which is a departure from dwarf colors towards giant - like colors .",

    "therefore , although dereddening the colors of these stars to dwarf values implies no reddening , they could in fact have small reddenings of up to @xmath160 if the intrinsic colors are even bluer and more giant - like than the observed colors .",
    "however , because the 4 stars at m5.5 and m5.75 have nearly identical colors , it s likely that they are unreddened stars rather than 4 stars all with the same extinction .",
    "optical colors were not measured for mbm12a  1 , 5 , and 12 .",
    "the first two stars were saturated in the @xmath15 data and the latter source was outside of the field that was imaged . because mbm12a  1 shows no ir excess in the colors @xmath69 , @xmath129 , and @xmath161 , the @xmath52 color should be uncontaminated by ir excess emission .",
    "therefore , the extinction for this star is calculated by dereddening the observed @xmath52 color to the dwarf value at its spectral type . on the other hand , mbm12a  5 and 12 both exhibit strong excesses at @xmath130 and @xmath162 that are indicative of circumstellar disks . to estimate reddenings for these stars ,",
    "the @xmath52 and @xmath163 colors are dereddened to the locus observed for classical t tauri stars ( ctts ) by meyer et al .",

    "this method assumes that the central stars of young mid- and late - m stars have dwarf - like @xmath52 and @xmath163 colors , which is suggested by the work of luhman ( 1999 ) .",
    "the reddenings derived from ir colors in this manner will have higher uncertainties than those estimated from optical measurements .",
    "for instance , the intrinsic ctts @xmath52 colors can vary by @xmath164  mag , which corresponds to @xmath165  mag in @xmath155 .      for reasons described in previous studies ( e.g. , luhman 1999 ) ,",
    "@xmath16 and @xmath166 are the preferred bands for measuring bolometric luminosities of young low - mass stars .",

    "( 2000 ) is highly dependent on the assumption that the relation of colors to spectral types for young stars is the same as that for dwarfs , which is not the case for certain colors and ranges of spectral types .",
    "for instance , because the optical colors of recx  5 were bluer than the values expected for the spectral classification of m5 , lawson et al .",
    "( 2000 ) concluded that the star must be m4 .",
    "however , young stars at these spectral types in fact exhibit intrinsic colors that are bluer than those of dwarfs and are more giant - like ( luhman 1999 ) . when comparing their photometrically inferred spectral types to spectral classifications , lawson et al .",
    "( 2000 ) found that their types were systematically later by an average of one subclass .",
    "they adopted the photometric spectral types and offered no explanation for why the spectral classifications would have such a systematic error .",
    "instead , it is more reasonable and likely that the spectral classifications are correct and that the red color excesses are simply to due to extinction .",
    "the small amount of reddening in question could easily arise from dust within the cluster or from circumstellar material near these young stars .",
    "mamajek et al .  ( 2000 ) also note that hd75505 is redder than expected for its spectral type of a1 by 0.13  mag in @xmath98 , which is equivalent to @xmath169 .",
    "again , they attribute the color excess to a spectral misclassification rather than reddening .",
    "mamajek et al .",
    "( 2000 ) contend that if the spectral type of this star is truly a1 , than it would fall 0.05  dex below the 100  myr isochrone and thus have an age that is inconsistent with that of the association .",
    "but , of course , at a spectral type near a0 , isochrones for 10 and 100  myr are nearly coincident ( e.g. , dantona & mazzitelli 1997 ) .",
    "thus , this position on the hr diagram is consistent with the age of 10  myr found for the other members .",
    "furthermore , mamajek et al .",
    "( 2000 ) argue that the red @xmath170 and @xmath171 colors of hd75505 are evidence of a later spectral type of a6 .",
