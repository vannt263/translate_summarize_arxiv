    "the emission of bhbs has been classified into four states based on spectral and timing properties : the quiescent , hard , thermal dominant ( td ) , and steep power - law states @xcite .",
    "the td state is the best understood and is well described by the standard accretion disk model @xcite .",
    "the emergent x - ray spectrum is described by a multicolor disk ( mcd ) model with two parameters : the disk inner radius ( @xmath2 ) and the temperature ( @xmath3 ) at that radius . in the td state , @xmath2 is constant and the accretion disk is thought to extend all the way to the `` innermost stable circular orbit '' ( isco ) around the bh @xcite .",
    "the isco radius depends solely on the mass and spin of the bh .",
    "therefore , a td spectrum from an accreting bh can be used to shed light on its mass and spin .",
    "the td state has been found during outbursts of many bhbs and exhibits specific properties .",

    "is observed @xcite . due to up scattering of disk photons in the corona , sometimes the observed exponent is lower than 4 , but can be recovered by applying hardening correction @xcite .",
    "moreover , sources in the td state have low levels of short term variability , with very weak or absent narrow band timing noise ( quasi - periodic oscillations ; qpos ) and weak broad band power continuum @xcite .",
    "spectral surveys of ulxs in nearby galaxies show they are rarely in the td state @xcite .",
    "the spectra of a few ulxs are super - soft and can be modeled by an mcd with an inner temperature close to 0.1 kev . however , repeated observations revealed an evolution pattern inconsistent with the @xmath5 relation ruling out interpretation as thermal dominant disk emission @xcite .",
    "some other ulxs show soft excesses in the spectra that could be fitted by cool disk emission @xcite .",
    "however , the cool disk is not the dominant component in their spectra , thus , the sources are not in the td state . finding a ulx in the td state would demonstrate that the ulx has emission states similar to galactic bhbs and allow inference of the bh mass and spin .",

    "low frequency qpos and broadband timing noise , detected in the central region of m82 @xcite and later confirmed to originate from this ulx @xcite , suggest that the ulx harbors a massive bh .",
    "@xcite also suggests that the ulx contains a massive bh which is the nucleus of a satellite galaxy merging with m82 .",
    "positive identification of the emission states requires both timing and spectral information . here",
    ", we describe simultaneous observations exploiting the high angular resolution of chandra to isolate the ulx spectrum from diffuse emission and nearby sources and the large collecting area of xmm - newton to obtain timing information .",

    ", the chandra observations placed the ulx @xmath7 off the optical axis , so the source covers multiple pixels , and the ccd was operated in a 1/8th sub - array mode to reduce the readout frame time . using the pileup_map tool in ciao 4.1.2 , we measured that the ulx resulted in 0.25 counts per frame ( @xmath813% pileup fraction ) on the brightest 3-by-3 pixel island in the observation on 2008 oct 4 , and found that about 85% of the total events were recorded on pixel islands with counts per frame larger than 0.06 ( @xmath83% pileup fraction ) .",

    "the observed eddington ratio is as high as 7 in v4641 sgr despite the uncertainty on the distance @xcite .",
    "when the luminosity is high and the radiation pressure is dominant , the thin accretion disk is predicted to be able to exceed the eddington limit by a factor of a few @xcite .",

    "we note that active galactic nuclei do not appear to exceed the eddington limit by more than a factor of 10 in any accretion state @xcite .",
    "the eddington ratio for a non - rotating bh is too large and this scenario should be ruled out .",
    "in contrast , if the bh is maximally spinning , the derived eddington ratio is only 2 .    freezing the spin at the maximum allowed value resulted in a best - fit bh mass of 660 solar masses and a 90% error range of 300 - 1250 solar masses , a disk inclination angle of at least @xmath47 , and @xmath48 .",
    "the other two observations produce similar results .",
    "we also applied the model to the three observations simultaneously , imposing the same mass , spin , and inclination , and allowing the mass accretion rate and absorption column density to vary individually .",

    "the inferred eddington ratio exceeds 10 for @xmath51 , which we took as the lower limit of the spin .",
    "fixing @xmath52 , the best - fit bh mass is 430 solar masses with a 90% error range of 190 - 570 solar masses , and the inclination is larger than @xmath47 .",
    "thus , the spectral fitting suggests that the ulx contains a rapidly spinning ( @xmath53 ) intermediate mass bh of 200 - 800 solar masses .",
    "joint chandra and xmm - newton observations have enabled us to precisely measure the spectral and timing behavior of this ulx in m82 .",
    "disappearance of qpos and low timing noise , an x - ray spectrum best - fitted with an mcd model , and an @xmath5 pattern in the spectral evolution provide strong motivation to interpret this behavior in terms of the td state seen in stellar - mass bhbs .",
    "the mcd model indicates that the source spectrum shows spectral curvature at a few kev and thus could also be fitted by more complicated models like a cool optically thick corona which has been proposed recently as an indicator of a new ` ultraluminous state ' @xcite .",
    "however , a transition from the hard spectrum ( incompatible with the steep power - law state ) seen at lower luminosities to the ultraluminous state would be difficult to explain and we , therefore , do not discuss this proposed state in detail .    simply scaling the @xmath5 pattern to those from galactic bhbs",
    "suggests that the source contains a more massive bh , because the compact object mass is proportional to the square root of the disk luminosity if two bhs have the same disk inner temperature and spin @xcite .",
    "fitting with a fully relativistic mcd model leads to a consistent result .",
    "a conservative estimate of the bh mass by allowing an eddington ratio of as high as 10 suggests a bh of at least 200 solar masses but less than 800 solar masses .",
    "this is coincident with the theoretical estimate of the mass of this bh if it is created in a nearby star cluster by runaway collisions @xcite .",
    "the fast spin of the source makes it efficient in extracting gravitational energy .",
    "the spectral fitting also indicates a relatively high inclination angle , 59 - 79 degrees , of the accretion disk . for a maximally spinning bh of a few hundred solar masses ,",
    "the relativistic effect has largely eliminated the limb - darkening effect ; viewing the disk at a high inclination angle receives almost the same flux as at a low angle .",
    "therefore , the observed high flux is not a problem for a nearly edge - on disk .",
    "the x - ray flux from m82 is modulated at a period of 62 days , interpreted as due to orbital motion of this ulx binary , which must contain a giant or super - giant star inferred from the period assuming roche - lobe overflow @xcite . with knowledge of the bh mass ( assuming 200 - 800 solar masses ) and the 62-day binary orbital period",
    ", the binary separation of the ulx can be calculated with the assumption of roche lobe overflow as @xmath54  cm , which is insensitive to the mass of the companion star .",
    "this is larger than all separations of low - mass bhbs with a dynamical measurement of the mass , and larger than that of grs 1915 + 105 , which has the largest separation known so far , by a factor of a few . this ulx and grs 1915 + 105 share a similarity that they have both been active for many years without quenching to the quiescent state",
    ". the large separation and consequently a huge reservoir of accretion mass could be the factor that determines their long - term activity @xcite .",
