    "a weak measurement is but a peculiar interference experiment : a quantum system is initially prepared in a superposition of eigenstates of an observable @xmath1 ; the system interacts with a second quantum system , the probe , prepared in a suitable coherent state , through a weak coupling proportional to @xmath1 ; as a result , the probe evolves as if subject in parallel to different interactions ; the different branches of the probe s wavefunction interfere , as revealed by the observation of the pointer variable ; as in an ordinary interference experiment the fringes disappear if averaged over the whole screen , the same happens with a weak measurement ; in order to fix a point of the ` screen ' it is necessary to make a postselection of the system .",
    "weak measurement ( without postselection ) was introduced in the pioneering paper of arthurs and kelly @xcite , where it allowed to overcome the quantum mechanical limitation to the joint measurement of non - commuting observables .",
    "the coherence of the detectors manifests in the variance of the outputs @xcite , resulting in an uncertainty relation @xmath2 , twice as large @xcite as the kennard limit @xcite . in another pioneering paper @xcite ,",
    "aharonov , albert , and vaidman studied the average output of a weak measurement of a single observable with post - selection @xcite , showing that it can be dramatically larger than the maximum eigenvalue .",
    "this effect was soon attributed to the coherence of the probe @xcite .",
    "interestingly , when unpolarized spins are injected into a series of three detectors , even though these are initially prepared with no coherence in the readout basis , coherence can be induced in the middle detector by the interaction with each spin , while the first and third detector provide pre- and post - selection .",
    "this has observable consequences if the rate at which particles are fired into the detectors is higher than the decoherence rate of the latters @xcite .",
    "several experimental realizations of weak measurement have been performed by now @xcite .",
    "weak measurement has been contemplated theoretically for applications in solid state devices @xcite . on a theoretical ground , ref .",
    "@xcite extended the results of @xcite to any initial state of the probe ; also , the average and the variance of both @xmath3 , the pointer variable , and of @xmath4 , its conjugated variable were considered @xcite ; in ref .",
    "@xcite , the general case of a non - instantaneous interaction was studied , showing that the dynamical phase of the detector influences the outcome .",
    ", interacts with a probe , then is projected into @xmath5 by a measurement .",
    "after the interaction , the observable @xmath6 of the probe is measured .",
    "a random number generator produces a number @xmath7 . if @xmath8 , an arbitrarily chosen probability depending on @xmath9 , then the record @xmath6 is discarded.,height=76 ]    ref .",
    "@xcite associated a complex quantity , the weak value @xmath10 , to the weak measurement . assuming a gaussian distribution for the probe , the real part of the weak value equals the average output . for spin 1/2 , this value can easily exceed @xmath11 even for random pre- and postselected states @xcite . the real part of @xmath10 describes well the average output of the weak measurement as far as the pre- and postselected states are not almost orthogonal . when they are nearly orthogonal , the output can indeed reach a large value , but the perturbative expansion used in @xcite fails , for a fixed coupling strenght , since @xmath10 diverges , while the observed output has a finite maximum just before the orthogonal configuration , then drops abruptly @xcite . in simple words ,",
    "weak measurement with postselection relies on a conditional probability which , by bayes rule @xcite , is @xmath12 , the ratio of the joint probability @xmath13 of observing @xmath6 for the probe and making a final postselection @xmath14 , over the marginal probability @xmath15 of making a successful postselection .",
    "both probabilities can be expanded in powers of the interaction strength . for nearly orthogonal pre- and postselected state , however , the leading term in the denominator vanishes faster than the corresponding term in the numerator for the average @xmath16 .",
    "this artificial divergence should be treated by expanding both numerator and denominator up to the first non vanishing terms .",
    "this apparently straightforward prescription was missed so far by the community working with weak measurement , with the exception of @xcite , where the correct expansion , however , was made only for the denominator .",
    "furthermore , while the experiments provide the full probability distribution @xmath17 , the theory generally considers only average values , and at times variances @xcite .",
    "here , we provide the full counting statistics , i.e. , the characteristic function for all the moments of any observable @xmath0 of the probe , conditioned on the postselection .",
    "we give a correct expansion working for any pre- and postselected state , and a somewhat simpler interpolating formula working satisfactorily over the whole range of postselection .",
    "we start by describing an ideal , instantaneous ( von neumann ) measurement with postselection .",
    "let us consider a quantum system prepared , at time @xmath18 , in a state @xmath19 ( preselection ) , with @xmath20 an infinitesimal time .",
    "the system interacts , at time @xmath21 , with another quantum system , the probe , through @xmath22 , where @xmath1 is an operator on the system s hilbert space , @xmath4 on the probe s .",
    "the probe is prepared in a state @xmath23 . at time",
    "@xmath24 a projective measurement of the observable @xmath0 is made on the probe .",
    "the procedure is particularly interesting , when @xmath25 is conjugate to @xmath4 , @xmath26=i$ ] , since then it is the observable of the probe that carries information about the measured quantity @xmath1 . at time @xmath27 , a projective measurement of an observable @xmath28 of the system is made , giving an output @xmath9 and leaving the system in the state @xmath29 .",
    "then , given @xmath9 , one keeps the record @xmath6 according to an arbitrarily chosen probability @xmath30 .",
    "this leaves the system in the postselected mixed state @xmath31 , with @xmath32 .",
    "the procedure detailed above describes a measurement with pre- and post - selection and it is sketched in fig .",
    "[ fig : scheme ] .    since the interaction is instantaneous , the problem can be treated analytically .",
    "the joint state for the probe and the system after the interaction is @xmath33 or , in the basis of eigenstates of @xmath3 and @xmath1 , @xmath34    the conditional density matrix for the probe given an initial preparation on @xmath35 , a system preselected in @xmath36 and successfully postselected in @xmath37 at time @xmath27 , follows readily after applying born s rule to eq .",

    "by contrast , eq .   reveals that no interference effects arise if one chooses to observe @xmath4 rather than @xmath3 , so that this case is of lesser relevance .",
    "interference terms are appreciable when @xmath59 , where @xmath60 is the spacing between eigenvalues of @xmath1 and @xmath61 is the coherence scale in @xmath49 , i.e. , the value over which the off - diagonal elements @xmath62 die out . a measurement performed in this regime",
    "is called weak measurement .",
    "the state of the system after a weak measurement is almost unaffected , but may acquire a small perpendicular component to its initial state . in the rare cases when",
    "the postselection is made on an almost perpendicular state , so that @xmath63 , the average value of @xmath49 can be finite , due to the constructive interference represented by the contribution of the off - diagonal elements . since for a strong measurement there is a one - to - one correspondence between the final state of the detector and that of the system , so that @xmath64 is associated to the system , if one makes stubbornly the same position , then the weak measurement of @xmath1 can yield a large average output .",
    "this is a purely quantum effect , since if it was due simply to a large classical uncertainty in the initial distribution @xmath65 , then each individual measurement may give a large value , but this would be washed out by averaging .",
    "the results presented so far are exact , but not always susceptible of an easy evaluation . in the following",

    "this implies that @xmath85 is a projection operator ( over the subspace spanned by the eigenvectors of @xmath1 with non - zero eigenvalue ) .",

    "the coefficients of @xmath243 and @xmath244 may vanish in the numerator @xmath14 , so that it is necessary to introduce another complex number , @xmath245 , in order to obtain a satisfactory interpolation .",
    "the results presented here apply to an instantaneous interaction , so that the hamiltonian evolution of the detector can be neglected .",
    "if this is not the case , the coefficients of the expansion have more involved expressions , and will be considered in a forthcoming work @xcite ."
