    "the @xmath0 x  ray observatory ( cxo ) is providing us with unprecedented high spatial ( and spectral ) resolution data on extended structures . the very first observation of a radio  loud quasar , pks  0637752 , revealed the presence of an x - ray jet extending for @xmath2 10 arcsec ( chartas et al . 2000 ; schwartz et al . 2000 ) , and since then other x  ray jets have been detected with high spatial resolution ( cen a , pictor a , see cxo www page http://chandra.harvard.edu/photo/cycle1.html ) .    while the detection of an x  ray jet is not unprecedented ( e.g. m87 , biretta , stern & harris , 1991 ; 3c273 , harris & stern 1987 ; rser et al .",
    "2000 ) , it is interesting to notice that both radio  galaxies and blazar  like sources ( i.e. with a jet oriented close to the line of sight ) have been observed .",
    "models involving inverse compton scattering of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) and nuclear hidden quasar radiation to produce large scale x ",
    "rays have been proposed ( e.g. brunetti , setti & comastri 1997 in the case of emission from the lobes ) .",
    "however it has been found that the local broad band spectral energy distributions from the knots in both pks  0637752 and m87 , are not straightforward to interpret , since the level of the x  ray emission is higher than what simple models predicts ( e.g. chartas et al .",
    "2000 ; schwartz et al .",
    "2000 , rser et al .",
    "2000 ) .    here",
    "we propose a scenario involving both highly and mildly relativistically moving plasma in the jet and consider the dominant radiation fields on which relativistic particles compton scatter .",
    "this can satisfactorily account for enhanced large scale x ",
    "ray emission in all jetted sources , both blazars and radio  galaxies .",
    "we also consider the spatial distribution of emission at different frequencies ( section 3 ) .",
    "the predictions are compared to the results on pks  0637752 in section 4 and our conclusions drawn in section 5 .",
    "comparatively little is observationally known on the structure and dynamics of extragalactic jets .",
    "theoretically one would expect the existence of a velocity structure along the jet , from a faster inner core to slower outer regions of the flow  dissipation can be produced by shocks in the relativistic plasma flow , or deceleration of the jet material can be caused by obstacles in the jet or by the interaction of the relativistic flow with the ( steady ) walls .",
    "however only recently observational evidence has been accumulating in support of such possibility and on the relevant role of the outer layers in contributing to the observed emission .",
    "this evidence includes the morphology and polarization structure of large scale low power jets ( komissarov 1990 , laing 1993 , 1999 ; giovannini et al .",
    "1999 ) as well as apparent inconsistencies on the value of the relativistical beaming parameters as inferred from the flux observed at large angles with the jet direction and the statistic properties of beamed and parent populations according to the unification schemes ( chiaberge et al . 2000 ) .",
    "these facts have been satisfactorily accounted for by schematically consider the jet as constituted by two main components : a slow , but still mildly relativistic , outer `` layer '' and a high relativistically moving `` spine '' .",
    "strong support for such a fast component even at large ( arcsec ) distances from the active nucleus comes from the detected superluminal motion of m87 on kpc scales ( biretta , sparks & macchetto 1999 ) .    within this assumption on the jet structure ,",
    "let us consider the electromagnetic fields ( magnetic and radiative ) which can contribute to the emission of relativistic electrons at different distances along the jet , and thus determine the corresponding dominant cooling process for relativistic particles .",
    "indeed , if dissipation occurs in knots at large distances , the accelerated particles can cool by the synchrotron and synchrotron self ",
    "compton ( ssc ) processes , but also by scattering any radiation produced externally to the knot itself .",
    "the relative importance of the fields clearly depends on the bulk lorentz factor of the emitting regions in the jet , i.e. the spine and the layer bulk lorentz factors .",
    "theoretical advances in recent years ( especially due to high energy @xmath3ray observations ) have convinced us that the bulk of the emission seen in blazars is produced in a rather well defined region of the jet , which on one hand can not be too compact ( hence , close to the jet apex ) in order not to absorb @xmath3ray photons through @xmath3@xmath3 interactions , and on the other hand can not be too large in order to vary on short timescales ( ghisellini & madau 1996 ) .",
    "this region should be located at some hundreds of schwarzschild radii from the black hole , and produce radiation collimated in the beaming cone of semi  aperture angle @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is its bulk lorentz factor . at larger distances ,",
    "the jet is therefore illuminated by this radiation : it turns out that it can be observationally relevant as scattered radiation if the large scale plasma has only mildly relativistic speeds , as supposed for the jet layer .",
    "in fact , let us assume that on the parsec and sub  parsec scale the jet contains a blazar  like emitting region , moving with a bulk lorentz factor @xmath5 at an angle @xmath6 with the line of sight .",
    "this region emits an intrinsic ( comoving ) synchrotron luminosity @xmath7 .",
    "further out , at a distance @xmath8 from the jet apex , there is a knot where dissipation occurs and electrons are accelerated and therefore radiate .",
    "if the bulk lorentz factor @xmath9 of this region is significantly smaller than @xmath5 this region will see the nuclear ( inner ) flux enhanced by beaming , with a corresponding radiation energy density @xmath10 where @xmath11^{-1}$ ] is the beaming or doppler factor of the inner jet , and @xmath12 is the corresponding velocity .",
    "this external energy density must be compared with the local magnetic ( @xmath13 ) and synchrotron radiation ( @xmath14 ) energy densities .",
    "if the magnetic field is in equipartition with the locally produced synchrotron radiation , we have @xmath15 , and the self ",
    "compton emission is then of the same order .",
    "alternatively , the field can be estimated by conservation of magnetic flux @xmath16 , which at large distances gives @xmath17 where we assume that the emitting region located at @xmath8 has a transverse dimension @xmath18 . in general @xmath19",
    "can be a function of @xmath8 if the jet is not conical , especially at @xmath20kpc scale , where some recollimation may occur ( see e.g. kaiser & alexander 1997 ) .",
    "the synchrotron energy density can be written as @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the beaming factor of the knot radiation .",
    "further fields which can provide seed photons for compton scattering are those reprocessed in the narrow line region ( nlr ) and by any large scale dust structure surrounding the nucleus .",
    "we consider these two components as produced within @xmath2kpc scale and therefore they would be seen de  amplified by plasma moving along the jet on larger scales : @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the fraction of the disk emission reprocessed by the nlr .",
    "dust is assumed to re - emit as a quasi - blackbody at temperature @xmath25 at a distance @xmath26 .",
    "finally , the cmb radiation provides a uniformly distributed contribution to the radiation fields : @xmath27 the inverse compton process on the cmb photons is particularly relevant if the knot is moving relativistically , since in this case the cmb energy density as seen in the comoving frame is amplified by @xmath28 .",
    "a possible contribution to the seed photons comes from the interplay between the spine and the layer of the jet , if both are active and relatively close .",
    "radiation produced in one zone can in fact be seen amplified ( by beaming ) by the other zone .",
    "we have however verified that these contributions are less important than the other ones , at least for the range of parameters considered in this work .",
    "we have also neglected any stellar contribution .",
    "the relative importance of the radiation produced by the blazar component and the local ssc emission is given by @xmath29 for illustration , consider the two cases of @xmath30 ( corresponding to a fast moving spine ) and @xmath31 ( corresponding to a layer at rest relative to the center ) :    \\i ) @xmath30 : in this case @xmath32 dominates if @xmath33 , i.e. if the observed power coming from the nucleus is two orders of magnitude ( for @xmath34 ) greater than the power of the knot ;    \\ii ) @xmath31 : in this case , for @xmath35 of the order of unity , @xmath32 dominates if the power dissipated in the inner jet is greater than the power dissipated at large scales , i.e. if @xmath36 .",
    "we conclude that it is likely that some part of the outer jet can produce  depending on the relative velocities of the inner and outer regions  an inverse compton spectrum dominated by seed photons coming from the inner regions , for @xmath37@xmath38 @xmath39 .    in order to fully compare all the contributions discussed above to the compton emission of the knot , in fig .",
    "1 we report the relevant energy densities as a function of the distance along the jet , for two values of the bulk lorentz factors ( schematically corresponding to a `` spine '' and `` layer '' ) . for semplicity , in fig .",
    "1 we also assumed that @xmath19 is constant ( and equal to 0.1 ) , i.e. a conical jet . clearly ,",
    "if the jet progressively recollimates at large @xmath8 , the scaling of @xmath40 and @xmath41 changes and their values increases relatively to the other energy densities .",
    "-0.5 true cm    fig .",
    "1 shows that along most of the jet the cmb is the dominant field for the spine : the energy densities of the magnetic field and of the nuclear blazar emission becomes relatively important only in the inner parts ( @xmath42 few kpc ) .",
    "on the contrary for a slowly moving layer the beamed inner radiation can dominate the radiation energy density up to large scales . reprocessed radiation from the nlr and dust structures do not provide a relevant contribution at any distance .",
    "for the spine emission , a systematic increase of the compton dominance ( ratio of the luminosity in the high energy and low energy spectral components ) is expected with increasing distance .",
    "clearly in terms of the observed luminosity the relative contributions of the spine and layer have to be weighted by the corresponding beaming factors .",
    "finally , let us consider the relative importance of the energy density in relativistic electrons and fields ( see fig .",
    "the electron density can be estimated from the intrinsic synchrotron luminosity @xmath43 of the knot : @xmath44 then the electron energy density @xmath45 is @xmath46 where @xmath47 .",
    "we have assumed that the particle distribution is a power law , @xmath48 , between @xmath49 and @xmath50 , with @xmath51 . for illustration ,",
    "assume @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 , and equal synchrotron and magnetic energy densities .",
    "in this case @xmath55 erg @xmath56 . it is then clear that if @xmath57 holds , then the energy density of relativistic electrons is bound to dominate by a large factor , especially at large distances , as long as @xmath58 increases with @xmath8 ( since @xmath59 scales as @xmath60 while the other energy densities scale as @xmath61 ) .    the only way to decrease the particle dominance is to increase the relative importance of @xmath13 . but",
    "this immediately implies that the ssc component of the spectrum becomes weaker than the synchrotron one .",
    "if a large compton x  ray flux is instead observed , then a more moderate particle dominance can be achieved only if this emission is not due to ssc .",
    "equipartition between @xmath13 and @xmath59 is however possible if the external radiation fields are orders of magnitude greater that the local synchrotron energy density ( if the x  ray flux is comparable to the low energy synchrotron one ) . such large ratios of external to local radiation fields are possible for the spine component ( see fig .",
    "1 ) at large distances .",
    "the spine component of jets can then have a compton dominated spectrum even in the case of equipartition between magnetic field and particles , providing that the magnetic field in the emitting region is greater than the values shown in fig .",
    "1 ( possibly due to shock compression and field amplification ) .    in summary , suppose to observe a significant inverse compton x  ray flux in an extended jet structure . if the source is a radio  galaxy , we have a strongly particle dominated emitting region , since we are likely observing the emission from the layer , for which the external photon fields can only slightly reduce the particle to magnetic energy density ratio .",
    "if the source is an extended jet of a blazar , we are observing the emission from the spine , with a strongly dominating cmb field . in this case",
    "it is possible ( even if not guaranteed ) , that @xmath62 .",
    "in aligned sources ( i.e. superluminal sources and blazars ) the more visible parts of the jet will be those still moving at relativistic speeds , producing radiation highly beamed towards the observer ( i.e. the spine emission will dominate ) . on the contrary , in misaligned radio  galaxies the slower moving parts ( layer )",
    "dominate with quasi ",
    "isotropic radiation providing most of the observed flux .",
    "a further crucial point to be considered in such extended structures is the relative role of radiative versus adiabatic cooling .",
    "the bottom panel of fig .",
    "1 shows the radiative cooling timescales of @xmath63 electrons of both the spine and the layer . due to the different radiation fields dominating in the spine and in the layer , the spine is radiatively efficient in the outer parts and the layer in the inner parts .",
    "therefore at large distances the adiabatic losses are negligible for the spine , and are instead important for the layer .    in fig .",
    "2 we show examples of the sed for the spine and layer , where the corresponding jets are assumed to be observed at @xmath64 and @xmath65 from the jet axis , respectively . the particle distribution is normalized to give a fixed amount of _ total _ ( synchrotron plus compton ) luminosity .",
    "the addition of the external radiation field then changes also the synchrotron flux level , and greatly changes the compton to synchrotron flux ratio .",
    "this can be seen in the upper panel of fig .",
    "2 , comparing the sed corresponding to ssc only with the one including the contribution of the external nuclear photons . note that the pure ssc case can be appropriate for a curved or bent jet , in which the beamed radiation from the center does not illuminate the large scale jet .",
    "a further prediction of the model due to the energy dependent cooling timescales is that the relative extension from the dissipation region where particles are accelerated would be larger for slower cooling particles , i.e. will depend on the mapping frequency , as @xmath66 .",
    "-0.5 true cm    -0.5 true cm",
    "let us consider the specific case of the jet associated with pks 0637752 , and in particular of its knot w7.8 , for which detailed information are reported ( chartas et al . 2000 ) .",
    "the spatially resolved x  ray images allowed to identify knots of emission similar in structure and intensity to those seen in the radio ( tingay et al .",
    "1998 ) and optical ( hst ; schwartz et al .",
    "2000 ) bands . according to the cxo and radio results ,",
    "the source can be resolved at 5 ghz with a dimension of 0.3 `` , at a distance from the central source of about 7.8 '' , yielding @xmath67 .",
    "vsop observations detected superluminal motion in the ( pc scale ) jet ( lovell 2000 ) , setting a lower limit on the ( inner ) bulk lorentz factor @xmath68 and an upper limit on the viewing angle @xmath69 degrees ( assuming @xmath70 km @xmath71 mpc@xmath72 and @xmath73 ) .",
    "the small scale jet appears to be well aligned with the kpc scale one .    as discussed by chartas et al . and schwartz et al .",
    ", the radio spectrum can be explained as synchrotron emission , as also supported by the detection of strong linear radio polarization , while the x  ray emission largely ( @xmath2 2 orders of magnitude ) exceeds the extrapolation from the radio  optical spectrum . on the other hand ,",
    "if the x  ray flux is due to ssc emission , large deviation from equipartition between magnetic field and particle energy density and/or strong inhomogeneities have to be invoked in the emitting region . thermal emission by e.g.",
    "shocked plasma also appears to be unlikely , as it would imply high particle density and thus unobserved large rotation measures . on the contrary in the proposed scenario the x ",
    "ray emission can be satisfactorily interpreted as scattered cmb radiation .",
    "3 shows the sed of both the nuclear blazar component and of the knot w7.8 . to fit the core emission ,",
    "we have assumed an emitting region of size @xmath74 cm , magnetic field @xmath75 gauss , bulk lorentz factor @xmath76 and viewing angle @xmath77 ( yielding @xmath78 ) .",
    "the emitted intrinsic luminosity is @xmath79 erg s@xmath72 .",
    "for this nuclear jet component we could estimate the kinetic power carried by the jet : in the form of poynting flux and emitting electrons we have respectively @xmath80 erg s@xmath72 @xmath81 .",
    "assuming one ( cold ) proton for each electron , the estimated kinetic power is of order @xmath82 erg s@xmath72 .",
    "-0.5 true cm    -0.5 true cm    for the knot , we have assumed that the emission region has a size of @xmath23 kpc , at a distance of 640 kpc from the center ( corresponding to the deprojected observed distance , with a viewing angle of @xmath83 ) .",
    "the magnetic field is @xmath84 g , the intrinsic luminosity is @xmath85 erg s@xmath72 and @xmath86 .",
    "the viewing angle is the same as the core . with these parameters , the cmb contribution to the radiation fields as seen by the knot is largely dominating . at the redshift of pks",
    "0637752 this corresponds to @xmath87 erg @xmath56 , to be compared with @xmath88 and @xmath89 erg @xmath56 .",
    "the jet bulk kinetic powers are @xmath90 and @xmath91 erg s@xmath72 .",
    "if there is one proton for emitting electron @xmath92 erg s@xmath72 .",
    "these numbers , typical for powerful radio sources , are in rough agreement with the corresponding values for the core , suggesting that the kinetic power is conserved along the jet ( see e.g. celotti & fabian 1993 ) .",
    "note that both the large bulk lorentz factor and the small size ( i.e. a much smaller value of @xmath19 than what adopted in the previous section ) refer to the _ spine _ component , while the jet could appear wider and slower if the layer dominates ( i.e. at large viewing angles ) .",
    "however , so far direct evidence for layers exists only for @xmath2kpc scale jets ( swain , bridle & baum 1998 ; laing et al . 1999 )",
    ".    the optical emission can be self  consistently interpreted as the higher energy part of the synchrotron component .",
    "this in turn implies that the emission is due to high energy electrons , whose cooling length corresponds to distances @xmath93 kpc .",
    "radio and x  ray emission are instead accounted for by particles of similar ( lower ) energies and therefore images in these two bands are expected to resemble each other ( with cooling lengths @xmath94 kpc ) , as indeed observed ( schwartz et al . 2000 ) .    in our model",
    ", @xmath49 is required to be small ( 1020 ) in order to fit the x  ray flux and spectrum .",
    "the presence of such low energy electrons can cause some depolarization of the radio emission of the knot ( wardle et al .",
    "1998 ) possibly indicating the contribution of electron  positron pairs ( which do not affect polarization ) .",
    "we have discussed the role of different electromagnetic fields for the radiative dissipation of relativistically accelerated electrons in large scale jets . the dissipation regions ( knots ) act as scattering mirrors for any externally produced photon field as well as the nuclear beamed radiation .",
    "a jet structure comprising components with different speeds can account for large scale emission in jets associated with both blazar and radio  galaxies .    in the former case",
    ", we expect to detect more intense radiation from a fast moving component ( spine ) , spatially concentrated in the outer jet regions and dominated by the cmb scattered field at distances greater than a few kpc . on the contrary , weaker and more",
    "isotropic emission would dominate in radio  galaxies , produced by a mildly relativistic portion of the jet , mainly compton scattering the beamed radiation coming from the nucleus .",
    "deviation from this behavior in radio galaxies is expected for jets which are subject to strong bending : in this case the inner beamed field would not reach any misdirected component .",
    "while the above estimates imply values of the kinetic power associated with the emitting knots typical of high power radio sources , a quasi  stationary hydrodynamical confinement of such structures appears to be a problem as extreme high gas densities for the external gas would be required .",
    "we expect that optical and x  ray emission to be common in large scale jets of both blazar and radio  galaxies .",
    "the promising results by @xmath0 and hst will thus play a key role in the understanding of the jet structure and dynamics as well as the dissipation processes .",
