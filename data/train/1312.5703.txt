    "it is an amazing coincidence that both dark matter and the baryonic energy densities are approximately within a factor five of each other @xcite .",
    "since normally the two densities are generated by very different mechanisms and at different scales , e.g. a wimp mechanism below the electroweak scale and leptogenesis at high scale , it is usually not possible to understand theoretically why the numbers are not much wider apart . since the pioneering work by sakharov  @xcite , it has been realized that obtaining a sufficiently large baryon number is usually a much more difficult task than just to produce dark matter : baryogenesis requires a sufficiently large violation of c , cp and baryon number violation and a departure from thermal equilibrium , while dm production can take place even in thermal equilibrium and without any quantum number violation .",
    "one would therefore expect the density of dark matter to be much less suppressed than the baryon asymmetry and indeed , in order to obtain the observed number density for dark matter , one usually has to rely on either a reduced number density , e.g. via a non - relativistic decoupling , or a very small mass for the dark matter particle , which is often in tension with being _ cold _ dark matter .",
    "a simple way to connect dark and baryonic matter is to invoke for both types of matter an asymmetry , like it has been proposed in asymmetric dark matter ( adm ) models @xcite . in that case",
    ", the asymmetries in the two species can be related , and then in the simplest realizations the ratio between the matter densities can be simply explained through a ratio of masses . then it is expected that the dark matter has a mass not much heavier than the proton and must interact sufficiently strongly to erase the symmetric density component .    in a similar spirit , in this letter we would like to propose and explore another way to connect the baryon and dm generation relying on baryogenesis through out - of equilibrium decay  @xcite and the superwimp mechanism  @xcite .",
    "in such a case both matter densities are produced from an initial mother particle and they are naturally suppressed compared to its initial density , by the cp violation , needed to generate the baryon asymmetry , and by the branching ratio into dm respectively .",
    "these two suppression factors can be naturally of the same order of magnitude and explain why the baryon and dark matter densities turn out to be so similar . in general then the ratio between the dm and the baryonic energy densities",
    "is independent of the original mother particle density and given just by masses , the decay cp asymmetry and branching ratios .",
    "the mechanism we would like to propose is very simple and relies on the possibility of generating both the baryon asymmetry and dark matter via the out - of - equilibrium decay of the same particle  @xmath0 .",
    "let us consider first baryogenesis .",
    "in general if a massive particle @xmath0 decays out - of - equilibrium in two channels with different baryon number and with a non - vanishing c- and cp - violation , one can obtain from the decay the baryon number  @xcite @xmath1 where @xmath2 is a coefficient taking into account the possible effects of wash - out processes and baryon number dilution ( e.g. via annihilation of massive particles into photons ) , @xmath3 are the proton and decaying particle masses , @xmath4 is the initial density of the @xmath0 particle at departure of equilibrium and @xmath5 gives the branching ratio for the decay into baryons and antibaryons .",
    "the cp - violation in the decay is taken into account by @xmath6 given as : @xmath7 in order to generate a sufficiently large @xmath8 one needs a large initial number density of the @xmath0-particle since both @xmath9 and @xmath10 tend to suppress the final baryon density . for the general case of wimp - like decoupling , @xmath11 , this condition requires a heavy @xmath0-particle possibly above the tev scale with suppressed annihilation channels .    in this setting",
    ", we consider also the decay of the @xmath0-particle into dark matter .",
    "the presence of this additional decay channel does not modify the mechanism of baryogenesis discussed above , as long as the branching ratio into dm is negligibly small .",
    "the decays of the particle @xmath0 after its freeze - out produce a dm abundance through the superwimp mechanism  @xcite as : @xmath12 where in this case @xmath13 just accounts for the possible dilution after dm production . therefore due to the presence of the other decay channels , the dm density is suppressed by the corresponding branching ratio and is much smaller than the original @xmath0 density .",
    "note that the time - scale of the @xmath0-particle decay is set by the total decay rate @xmath14 avoiding problems with big bang nucleosynthesis as long as @xmath15 s.    we see that in this scenario we expect both @xmath8 and @xmath16 to be suppressed by small numbers compared to @xmath4 and we can obtain their ratio as @xmath17 with @xmath18 , independently of the initial density of the particle @xmath0 .",
    "so we can indeed obtain naturally @xmath19 , if the masses of the dm and of the proton are of the same order and if the branching ratio of the decay of @xmath0 into dm is strongly suppressed in comparison to the other channels and is of order @xmath20 .",
    "note that in order to explain the whole dark matter abundance as coming from the same particle that produces the baryon asymmetry , all the other mechanisms that could produce dm in the early universe have to be subdominant .    in the following",
    "we will discuss two different implementations of this mechanism in the context of supersymmetric models with gravitino dm .",
    "indeed if the @xmath0 particle is a superpartner , it has always a decay channel to gravitino lsp with planck suppressed decay rate .",
    "we have indeed for a fermionic @xmath0 : @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the reduced planck mass , @xmath23gev , @xmath24 is the mother particle mass and @xmath25 the gravitino mass .",
    "it is in this case therefore easy to achieve a small branching ratio into gravitino of the order of @xmath26 . indeed",
    "the condition ( [ eq : ratio_fit ] ) allows for a gravitino lighter than the proton , but the requirement of proton stability against processes mediated by the @xmath0-particle , points towards a gravitino heavier than 1 gev , corresponding to @xmath27 .",
    "let us consider one this mechanism at the tev scale in the case when baryogenesis occurs in a supersymmetric model with r - parity violation  @xcite .",
    "the model is based on the mssm extended with the baryon and r - parity violating superpotential @xmath28 where @xmath29 represent the squark chiral multiplets and @xmath30 are generation indices .",
    "then a bino - like neutralino , not the lsp , can decay into different r - parity conserving channels , in particular the dominant one into a gluino and a quark - antiquark pair and subdominant decays into photon / z and gravitino , as well as into three quarks via the r - parity violating coupling .",
    "then the bino plays the role of the @xmath0 particle with decay rates given by  @xcite @xmath31 where @xmath32 are the gauge coupling strenghts of the @xmath33 and @xmath34 gauge groups , @xmath35 are the hypercharges of the quarks @xmath36 , @xmath37 and @xmath38 denote the bino s and a common scalar superpartner s masses . in the rate we have already summed over color states ,",
    "while the sum over the final state flavours gives factors @xmath39 instead of @xmath40 in the r - parity conserving case and @xmath41 instead of @xmath42 for the rpv decay for flavour - universal @xmath43 .",
    "if some of the squarks are substantially heavier than the others , the rates get smaller and we can obtain the limiting cases with decoupled @xmath44 by setting @xmath45 equal to zero respectively . in order for the neutralino to decay out - of - equilibrium , the scalar superpartners have to be sufficiently heavy to satisfy the relation @xmath46 but lighter than the susy breaking scale @xmath47 in order for the decay into gravitino to have a small branching ratio . for universal @xmath48",
    ", we obtain from these two conditions the window of squark mass : @xmath49 with @xmath50 and @xmath51 counting the effective relativistic degrees of freedom at the time when the neutralino becomes non - relativistic .",
    "we show here in red ( dark grey ) the region where @xmath8 is between 0.01 - 0.04 in the plane @xmath38 vs @xmath52 for @xmath53 .",
    "the black line gives @xmath54 for @xmath55 gev .",
    "we can see that we can obtain both quantities in the observed range for @xmath56 gev and @xmath57 tev . in the orange ( light grey ) region ,",
    "the bino annihilation and other wash - out processes are still active during the decay .",
    ", width=268 ]    the rpv decay may have a non - vanishing cp asymmetry , due to the one - loop diagrams with on - shell gluino and quark .",
    "assuming that the couplings contain different complex phases and that the intermediate down squarks dominate the process , the cp violation parameter can be estimated as  @xcite @xmath58   \\alpha_3   \\frac{m_{\\tilde{b}}^2}{m_0 ^ 2}\\ ] ] where @xmath59 denotes an effective cp - violating phase .",
    "if the bino density is sufficiently large , as it can be arranged for large @xmath60 and pure bino , i.e. when the annihilation is mostly into higgs bosons , a baryon asymmetry can be generated as  @xcite @xmath61 for @xmath62 = 1 $ ] .",
    "so we can obtain for the baryon to dm ratio simply @xmath63 from this expression it is clear that we need @xmath64 to match the observed baryon to dm ratio and that the gravitino mass can not be far from the proton mass and , likely , values lower than 1 gev are favored .",
    "such a large scalar mass is also required to obtain the right baryon number @xcite .",
    "we show in figure 1 the regions of parameter space with the correct baryon and dm densities in the plane of @xmath38 vs @xmath52 for a fixed gravitino mass of @xmath65 gev . in figure 2",
    "we give the same regions in the plane @xmath66 vs @xmath67 for fixed values of @xmath68 and @xmath69 .",
    "we show here in the plane @xmath66 vs @xmath67 the lines where the ratio @xmath70 takes the observed value for different values of the scalar mass @xmath38 .",
    "the matching colored regions have also the observed value for the baryon number , assuming @xmath71 . ,",
    "width=268 ]    in order for this mechanism to work , one has to be sure that the contributions to the gravitino density from thermal scatterings @xcite and fimp @xcite mechanism from the heavy scalars are not larger than the superwimp one .",
    "the easiest way to achieve that simultaneously is to require a sufficiently low reheat temperature that the scalar superpartners are not in thermal equilibrium @xmath72 , while the fimp decay of the gauginos is less important .",
    "a detailed study of all the relevant processes will be the subject of a longer publication @xcite .",
    "let us consider now another implementation of the mechanism , where instead baryogenesis happens via leptogenesis at a high scale @xcite . in this case",
    "the decay of the lightest rh neutrino and its superpartner , the rh sneutrino , both produce a lepton asymmetry with similar values of @xmath10 @xcite . the lightest rh neutrino and sneutrino decay rates into leptons and antileptons and their superpartners are given by @xmath73",
    "so that to have an out - of - equilibrium decay we need @xmath74 note that barring cancellations the heaviest light neutrino mass is well approximate by @xmath75 @xcite .",
    "the generated lepton asymmetry is given by @xmath76 where again @xmath77 takes into account possible effects of wash - out processes as well as the change in degrees of freedom from the leptogenesis epoch to today and @xmath78 is the number density of the species @xmath79 rescaled by the entropy density @xmath80 . in the preferred region of strong wash - out , where the baryon asymmetry is independent of the initial conditions",
    "@xcite , we have @xmath81 .",
    "this lepton asymmetry is finally transferred into a baryon asymmetry by sphaleron processes as @xmath82 where @xmath83 is the sphaleron factor relating the original @xmath84 number to the baryon number @xcite .    in this",
    "setting the production of gravitino dark matter can happen via rh sneutrino decay .",
    "if the degeneracy in mass between the rh sneutrino and neutrino is lifted , i.e. for @xmath85 and @xmath86 the decay can proceed into rh neutrino and gravitino .",
    "this points towards large mass splitting @xmath87 .",
    "the decay rate of the rh sneutrino into a rh neutrino and a gravitino is @xmath88 so that the decay is suppressed both by @xmath89 and the available phase space .",
    "indeed the decay is governed by the goldstino coupling that vanishes in the limit of conserved susy .",
    "if the mass splitting is too small , the three - body decay into higgs , lepton and gravitino can be more important .",
    "for such three - body decay , away from resonances in the intermediate rh neutrino or higgsino , taken into account in eqs .",
    "( [ sndecaylh ] ) , ( [ sndecay2 ] ) , we have @xmath90 we see therefore that the 3-body decay dominates over the 2-body as soon as @xmath91    the branching ratio of the rh sneutrino decay into gravitino is then @xmath92 and it can naturally be of the same order as @xmath93 even for small @xmath94 . taking @xmath95 and @xmath96 , we have then for the ratio between baryon and dm energy density the relation : @xmath97 assuming for the parameters the typical values from thermal leptogenesis  @xcite , i.e. @xmath98 gev , @xmath99 , @xmath100 , and the strong wash - out regime with @xmath101 , we obtain the observed value of the ratio for intermediate values of the mass difference @xmath87 , i.e. @xmath102 note that the result is independent of the rh sneutrino mass since the 3-body decay into gravitino dominates and has the same dependence on that mass as the lepton violating decays . for larger gravitino masses",
    "instead the 2-body decay plays the dominant role and the relation changes to @xmath103 for @xmath99 .",
    "we show in figure 3 the curves for the observed value of @xmath104 in the plane @xmath10 vs gravitino mass . for values @xmath105 gev it is possible to match the observation for @xmath106 as required by thermal leptogenesis . in case of non - thermal leptogenesis ,",
    "the rh sneutrino and neutrino number densities can be larger and allow also for smaller values of @xmath107 and therefore @xmath108 .     curves of correct values of the ratio @xmath70 in the plane @xmath109 vs @xmath67 for different values of the mass difference @xmath108 .",
    "we take @xmath110 gev and @xmath111 . a typical value @xmath112 is given by the green ( dashed ) line . , width=268 ]    in both cases",
    "we need a quite large mass splitting in the rh neutrino multiplet , larger than expected for the other sm superpartners , but still smaller than the rh sneutrino masses .",
    "such a splitting could arise naturally if the rh sneutrino couples directly to the supersymmetry breaking sector .    in this case again",
    ", in order for the mechanism to work , we need to suppress all other production channels of gravitinos , which is not so simple at high temperature .",
    "possibly the easiest way would be to consider a heavy gravitino that couples more weakly or to reduce the scale of leptogenesis and so also @xmath113 as in non - thermal leptogenesis @xcite .",
    "we have considered the possibility of producing both dm and the baryon asymmetry from the out - of - equilibrium decay of a single particle . in the general case",
    "this allows to obtain densities of the same order since both the baryon and the dm densities are strongly suppressed , by the cp asymmetry or by the decay branching ratio respectively .",
    "we are in this way able to obtain the observed ratio just from fundamental parameters like masses and couplings , independently of the mother particle density .",
    "the mechanism can in principle be embedded both in low and high scale baryogenesis models with gravitino dm , as we have discussed in sections 3 and 4 , as long as the usual thermal gravitino production by scatterings or decays is sufficiently suppressed . in both the models we find that at least part of the supersymmetric spectrum must be quite heavy . in the first case",
    "the squarks are required to be much heavier than the gauginos in order to achieve the out - of - equilibrium condition and also the right branching ratio of the bino into gravitino . in the case of leptogenesis , a sufficiently large mass splitting in the rh neutrino multiplet",
    "is needed , implying very heavy scalar superpartners if extended to the whole mssm superpartners .",
    "nevertheless the gravitino lsp and also other part of the spectrum can still reside below or at the tev scale .",
