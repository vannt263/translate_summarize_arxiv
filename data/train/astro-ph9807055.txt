    "after a decade of ambiguous detections , bona fide brown dwarfs and extrasolar giant plants ( egps ; burrows 1995 ) are now being discovered at an accelerating pace . whether by radial velocity techniques ( mayor & queloz 1995 ; marcy & butler 1996 ; butler & marcy 1996 ; latham 1989 ; cochran 1997 ) , by direct detection in the field ( tinney , delfosse , & forveille 1997 ; delfosse 1998 ; tinney 1998 ( denis ) ; kirkpatrick , beichman , & skrutskie 1997 ; kirkpatrick 1998 ( 2mass ) ) , by direct detection in young stellar clusters ( zapatero - osorio , rebolo , & martin 1997 ; comeron 1993 ) , by direct detection around nearby stars ( nakajima 1995 ; oppenheimer 1995 ; matthews 1996 ; oppenheimer 1998 ( gl 229b ) ) , or from space ( terebey 1998 ( nicmos ) ) , the expanding census of objects beyond the solar system with masses between 0.5 and 80 is lending new urgency to theoretical efforts to understand their evolution , spectra , and compositions . .",
    "] at the low temperatures ( 100 k @xmath0 t @xmath0 2500 k ) achieved in the dense , high  gravity atmospheres of brown dwarfs and egps , chemical species not encountered in traditional stellar realms assume a new and central importance .",
    "the molecular compositions of these exotic , low  ionization atmospheres can serve as diagnostics of temperature , mass , and elemental abundance and can help define a spectral sequence , just as the presence or absence of spectral features associated with various ionization states of dominant , or spectroscopically active , atoms and simple molecules does for m through o stars .",
    "however , the multiplicity of molecules that appear in their atmospheres lends an additional complexity to the study of substellar mass objects that is both helpfully diagnostic and confusing .",
    "nowhere is the latter more apparent than in the appearance at low temperatures of refractory grains and clouds .",
    "these condensed species can contribute significant opacity and can alter an atmosphere s temperature / pressure profile and its albedo .",
    "grain and cloud droplet opacities depend upon the particle size and shape distribution and these are intertwined with the meteorology ( convection ) in complex ways .",
    "furthermore , condensed species can rain out and deplete the upper atmosphere of heavy elements , thereby changing the composition and the observed spectrum .",
    "hence , in brown dwarf and egp atmospheres , abundance and temperature / pressure profiles , particle properties , spectra , and meteorology are inextricably linked .",
    "one might naturally throw up one s hands at the messiness of this problem were it not for two things : 1 ) there are chemical systematics that somewhat simplify the study of these atmospheres and 2 ) further progress in understanding the edge of the main sequence , brown dwarfs , and egps hinges directly upon its resolution .",
    "the goal of this paper is to explore and clarify the chemical condensation sequences , molecular abundance profiles , and molecular spectral diagnostics of brown dwarf and egp atmospheres .",
    "the formation of refractory silicate grains below 2500 k was already shown by lunine ( 1989 ) and burrows ( 1989 ) to influence the evolution of late m dwarfs and young brown dwarfs through their `` mie '' opacity . the blanketing effect they provide",
    "lowers the effective temperature ( t@xmath1 ) and luminosity ( l ) of the main sequence edge mass from about 2000 k and @xmath4 to about 1750 k and @xmath5 , an effect recently verified by chabrier ( 1998 ) .",
    "in addition , grain opacity slightly delays the cooling of older brown dwarfs , imprinting a slight bump on their luminosity / age trajectories ( see figure 7 of burrows 1997 ) .",
    "the presence of grains in late m dwarf spectra was invoked to explain the weakening of the tio bands and the shallowing of their h@xmath6o troughs in the near infrared ( tsuji 1996 ; jones & tsuji 1997 ) .",
    "tsuji and collaborators concluded that titanium was being depleted into refractories , a conclusion with which we agree ( see  3 ) .",
    "gl 229b ( nakajima 1995 ; oppenheimer 1998 ) is a rosetta stone for brown dwarf research . with a t@xmath1 of @xmath2950",
    "k , a luminosity below @xmath7 , and spectra or photometry from the @xmath8 band through 5 , gl 229b hints at or exemplifies all of the unique characteristics of the family ( marley 1996 ; allard 1996 ) : metal ( fe , ti , v , ca , mg , al , si ) depletions , the dominance of h@xmath6o vapor , the appearance of ch@xmath9 and alkali metals , and the signatures of clouds . clouds of low  temperature condensible species above the photosphere are the most natural explanation for the steep drop below 1 in the keck spectra between 0.83 and 1 ( oppenheimer 1998 ) .",
    "these clouds may not be made up of the classic silicate refractories formed at much higher temperatures , since these species have probably rained out ( marley 1996 ) . from simple mie theory ,",
    "their mean particle size must be small ( @xmath2 0.2 ) in order to influence the `` optical '' without much perturbing the near infrared .",
    "in addition , such a population of small droplets can help explain why gl 229b s near  infrared troughs at 1.8 and 3.0 are not as deep as theory would otherwise have predicted .",
    "just as tsuji and collaborators have shown that silicate grains at higher temperatures can shallow out the h@xmath6o troughs , so too can species that condense at lower temperatures ( @xmath0 1000 k ? ) explain the shallower  than  predicted gl 229b h@xmath6o troughs .",
    "what those species might be can be illuminated by chemical abundance studies and is one of the subjects of this paper .",
    "note that a cloud grammage in these small  radius low  temperature refractories of only @xmath10 gm @xmath11 would be adequate to explain the anomalies .    with gl 229b as a reference benchmark",
    ", we explore the composition profiles of low  temperature brown dwarfs and egps to derive the systematics of the changes in the dominant reservoirs of the major elements ( table 1 ) .",
    "these equilibrium chemical sequences are predominantly a function of temperature and can help to define a spectral sequence for substellar objects from the main sequence edge near 2000 k to egps with t@xmath1s of a few hundred kelvin .",
    "the appearance and disappearance of various molecules and refractories delineates an effective temperature sequence and the new proposed `` l '' dwarf spectral classification ( kirkpatrick 1998 ) may correspond to a subset of the compositional sequences we derive .",
    "however , as mentioned above , the full problem requires that the composition profiles , opacities , meteorology , temperature / pressure profiles , and spectra be handled self  consistently . at the present time , given the ambiguities in the grain / cloud properties and the paucity of optical constants , such a program is not realistic . in lieu of this , we employ the temperature / pressure profiles derived in burrows ( 1997 ) .",
    "this allows us to define the overall trends , while at the same time focusing on the essential chemistry .",
    "the models of burrows ( 1997 ) consistently incorporate the abundances of the major gas  phase species , with their opacities , but do not include the thermal effects of the low  temperature condensibles .",
    "nevertheless , the thermal profiles below the photospheres ( at higher pressures ) are always close to adiabatic , while the thermal profiles at lower optical depths are generally super  adiabatic ( @xmath12 small ) .",
    "coolants in the atmosphere and non  gray effects generally lower the temperatures achieved at the lower pressures far below the milne temperature ( @xmath2 0.81t@xmath1 ) to near @xmath2 0.5t@xmath1 .",
    "this has the consequence that species that would not otherwise condense in gl 229b  like atmospheres may in fact be present",
    ". the burrows ( 1997 ) models incorporate such cooling and non  eddington effects . in  2 , we describe the techniques and procedures we employ to perform the equilibrium calculations . in  3 , we present temperature profiles for representative model brown dwarf and egp atmospheres .",
    "we also calculate various composition boundaries in temperature  pressure space between the major compounds of the abundant elements . in addition ,",
    "element by element we describe the abundance profiles in realistic brown dwarf / egp model atmospheres .",
    "this is the central section of the paper . in  4 , we explore the potential effects of rainout and depletions on the remaining mix of dominant chemical species . in  5 , we summarize the list and order , as a function of temperature , of chemical indicators that can help to define a spectral classification scheme for substellar objects and we review our general findings .",
    "using the brown dwarf and giant planet model atmospheres of burrows _ et al . _  ( 1997 ) , and assuming an anders and grevesse ( 1989 ) solar composition of the 27 chemical elements h , he , li , c , n , o , f , ne , na , mg , al , si , p , s , cl , ar , k , ca , ti , v , cr , mn , fe , co , ni , rb and cs , we calculate the abundances of each of about 330 gas  phase species , including the monatomic forms of the elements , and of about 120 specified condensates .",
    "these calculations are performed at each of about 2000 temperature - pressure points for every atmosphere model .",
    "table 1 lists the abundances by number for the 27 elements used in these calculations . with the exception of lithium , rubidium and cesium",
    ", the list covers nearly all the most abundant elements anticipated to be in brown dwarf atmospheres .",
    "lithium is added because it is an important brown dwarf indicator .",
    "rubidium and cesium are added because they have recently been detected in cool objects ( oppenheimer 1998 ; tinney 1998 ) .",
    "their very low excitation and ionization potentials make them good temperature indicators in a range were many other elements are associated into molecules or have condensed out .",
    "the same methods were used as in sharp and huebner ( 1990 ) , but the improved version of the original computer code solgasmix ( besmann 1977 ) used in that paper was further improved in the current work by including more species , incorporating a number of error traps , and adding features to make the code more user - friendly . using the multi - dimensional newton - raphson method of white , johnson and dantzig ( 1958 ) , the equilibrium abundances of gas  phase and condensed ",
    "phase species at a given temperature , pressure , and elemental composition were obtained by minimizing the total free energy of the system . after subtracting the constraint equation in the manner of lagrange s method of undetermined multipliers and linearizing ,",
    "solgasmix uses gaussian elimination with pivoting to iteratively solve the resulting matrix equations .",
    "the free energy of each species at a particular temperature is obtained by evaluating a polynomial of the form    @xmath13    where @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 are fitted coefficients and @xmath19 is the gibbs free energy of formation at temperature @xmath20 of species @xmath21 in phase @xmath22 , relative to its consitituent atoms in their monatomic neutral gaseous state .",
    "for instance , for h@xmath6s the reference states of the elements are monatomic hydrogen and sulfur in the gas phase , whose energies of formation are zero by definition . if the species being considered is in the gas phase and is monatomic , all the coefficients on the right hand side of eq . ( [ eq : fit ] ) are zero .",
    "in the original work of sharp and huebner ( 1990 ) , the total free energy of the system was expressed quite generally in terms of the gas phase , several liquid or solid solutions ( each containing at least two species ) , and distinct condensed phases of invariant stoichiometry ( each containing a single species ) . in our current work , because of the large number of species considered , we decided to simplify the calculations and omitted solutions , such as the solid solution of melilite ( ca@xmath6al@xmath6sio@xmath23 with ca@xmath6mgsi@xmath6o@xmath23 ) .",
    "thus , given a value of @xmath19 from eq .",
    "( [ eq : fit ] ) for each chemical species , the elemental composition , and initial trial values of the species abundances , the total equilibrium free energy of the system is found by minimizing    @xmath24_{\\phi=1 } + \\frac{1}{rt } \\sum_{\\phi=2}^{s+1 }   \\big[n_{\\phi i } \\delta g_{\\phi i}(t)\\big]_{i=1 } , \\label{eq : minig}\\ ] ]    where @xmath8 is the gas constant , @xmath25 is the total pressure in atmospheres , and @xmath26 is the total number of moles in the gas phase . the first sum is over @xmath27 species in the gas phase with @xmath28 , the second sum is over @xmath29 condensed phases ( numbered 2 to @xmath30 ) , and @xmath31 is the number of moles of species @xmath21 in phase @xmath22 .",
    "each condensed phase is in fact only a single species , so @xmath32 in the second sum , since we need to distinguish between , for example , h@xmath6o(gas ) and h@xmath6o(liquid ) , which are considered separate species .",
    "the subsidiary mass balance relations are satistfied for each element @xmath33 of the total number of elements , @xmath34 , as follows :      where @xmath36 is the stoichiometric coefficient of element @xmath33 in species @xmath21 in phase @xmath22 and @xmath37 is the number of gram - atoms of element @xmath33 .",
    "( [ eq : minig ] ) , the first sum is over the gas - phase species ( @xmath28 ) and the second sum is over all the single component ( @xmath32 ) condensates .",
    "most of the thermodynamic data were obtained from the janaf tables ( chase 1982 ; chase _ et al .",
    "data on a number of condensates not available in these tables were obtained from turkdogan ( 1980 ) and data on the two condensates naalsi@xmath38o@xmath39 ( high albite ) and kalsi@xmath38o@xmath39 ( high sanidine ) were obtained from robie and waldbaum ( 1968 ) .",
    "tsuji ( 1973 ) was the source of data for the gas - phase molecules cah , crh , mnh , nih , mno , nio , mns , tis , tin , sih@xmath6 , sih@xmath38 , together with some carbides of little importance in the brown dwarf context .",
    "our database currently holds information on 1662 species , of which about 450 are followed in these calculations . for those species for which the janaf tables were used , the coefficients in eq .",
    "( [ eq : fit ] ) were obtained from a database generated in sharp and huebner ( 1993 ) , in which the free energies were renormalized relative to the monatomic gaseous phase of each element , rather than relative to standard reference states .",
    "a polynomial with up to five coefficients as in eq .",
    "( [ eq : fit ] ) was fitted over the tabulated temperature range of each species . using the redefined free energies",
    "has the advantage of removing any discontinuities associated with phase changes in the reference states , permitting polynomial fits to be made over large temperature ranges .    in sharp and huebner ( 1990 ) ,",
    "the only alkali elements considered were sodium and potassium , together with their most important compounds . in this work",
    ", we include all the other alkali elements , except francium , together with their most important compounds , in particular their chlorides and fluorides , in both gas and condensed phases . with the exception of rubidium",
    ", all the data were obtained from the janaf tables . as no useful data on rubidium and its compounds are available in the janaf tables , including in the more recent compilations in chase _ et al . _",
    "( 1985 ) , we used barin ( 1995 ) .    the janaf tables are deficient in a number of important volatile condensates , the most important being h@xmath6o(ice ) .",
    "a prescription for water from eisenberg and kauzmann ( 1969 ) was modified and incorporated into our code .",
    "a second important volatile condensate is nh@xmath38(ice ) .",
    "the pure liquid phase of nh@xmath38 , together with a number of its hydrated liquid phases , were not considered .",
    "the data for nh@xmath38 were obtained from the crc handbook ( weast and astle 1980 ) in the form of vapor pressure coefficients .",
    "another important volatile condensate is ammonium hydrogen sulfide , nh@xmath9sh , which is believed to be an important component in the jovian atmosphere ( lewis 1969 ) . as with nh@xmath38(ice ) , we obtained the data for nh@xmath9sh from the crc handbook , in the form of vapor pressure coefficients .",
    "however , unlike either nh@xmath38 or h@xmath6o , which on vaporization remain the same compound , nh@xmath9sh decomposes into the two gaseous components , nh@xmath38 and h@xmath6s .",
    "in addition , we added nh@xmath9cl , which decomposes into nh@xmath38 and hcl , but this species proves to be unimportant at the temperatures and pressures encountered in giant planet and brown dwarf atmospheres .",
    "except for the data originating from tsuji ( 1973 ) and our newly added data on the condensed phases of h@xmath6o , nh@xmath38 , nh@xmath9sh , and nh@xmath9cl , which were expressed in different forms , all data were converted to the same form as eq .",
    "( [ eq : fit ] ) , before the evaluation of eqs .",
    "( [ eq : minig ] ) and ( [ eq : conserve ] ) .",
    "furthermore , we replaced the polynomial fit for the gaseous species co found in the janaf tables with a polynomial fit based on its spectroscopic constants , as the spectroscopic data are very well known for this molecule ( sharp 1985 ) .",
    "we assume that the gas is ideal , _ i.e. _ that the activity of each species is the same as the partial pressure in atmospheres and , with the exception of liquid h@xmath6o , only solid condensates are included in the calculations .",
    "we consider the neglect of the liquid phases to be quite reasonable , as the difference between the free energies of formation of the liquid and solid phase of a species is generally much smaller than the difference between the free energies of one of the condensed phases and the gas phase .",
    "for example , for iron in the range 1000 to 2000 k , the change in the free energy when converting the vapor into the liquid is at least five orders of magnitude larger than the corresponding change when converting the liquid to the solid . in the case of tio ,",
    "the ratio of the change in the free energy between vapor and liquid to between liquid and solid is much smaller , but is still at least one order of magnitude in the same range ( though in detailed calculations other condensed oxides form ) .",
    "additionally , the inclusion of ionization slows down the calculations substantially in any temperature region which involves both marginal ionization and condensation , as is the case in this work , and since ionized species play a negligible role at the lower temperatures of substellar atmospheres , we omit them .    the main object of this work is to derive the detailed equilibrium abundance profiles for models of the atmospheres of cool brown dwarfs and giant planets , given their temperature - pressure profiles , with particular reference to the brown dwarf gliese 229b ( nakajima _ et al .",
    "_ 1995 ) . since we start with temperature - pressure profiles with specified gravities and effective temperatures from burrows _ et al . _",
    "( 1997 ) , to obtain such profiles for given ages and masses , we interpolate using the evolutionary calculations from that work . given a profile corresponding to the require model , we calculate the abundances by minimizing the free energy of the system .",
    "starting at the high temperature end of the profile , the code uses approximate trial values based on the element abundances to start the calculations . upon convergence ,",
    "the abundances of selected species are written to a file for later graphical treatment .",
    "these abundances are then used as trial values for the next calculation 1  kelvin lower in temperature , and at selected temperature intervals , typically 100 k , additional data are printed out .",
    "this process is repeated for progressively lower temperatures and pressures in the atmosphere , until the end of the data file is reached . at the high temperature end , convergence is usually rapid , since the gas consists of atomic and simple molecular species , and few , if any , condensates . at progressively lower temperatures , as more species condense out and the chemistry becomes more complicated , convergence is slower and more `` delicate . ''",
    "if the starting values before each iteration are too far away from the solution , there is a risk of non - convergence .",
    "it is for this reason that the calculations are always started at the high temperature end of a profile .",
    "however , even with the above method , convergence problems can arise .",
    "it is found that between 1100 and 1200 k for pressures less than about 0.1 atmospheres the program may fail to converge . for higher pressures ,",
    "the code generally operates successfully until temperatures below 600 k are reached .",
    "in the first case , non - convergence is often associated with the refractory condensate ca@xmath6mgsi@xmath6o@xmath23 , and in the second case it is often associated with the less refractory ( and very low abundance ) condensate lialo@xmath6 . in both cases , these condensates appear at higher temperatures , only to disappear into other species before the problems are encountered . upon removal of these and many other similar species , such as al@xmath6o@xmath38 , which is present only above about 1800  k in most models and disappears into other aluminum - bearing species at lower temperatures , the problems are often solved .",
    "these problems are caused by a too rapid change in abundance associated with condensation or a phase change .",
    "unfortunately , it is often not possible without doing the calculations to know _",
    "ab initio _ which species are likely to be unimportant and can be neglected . fortunately , removing gas - phase species of negligible abundance can speed up the calculations . after removing redundant species ,",
    "iterations can be restarted .    if it was still not possible to obtain successful convergence after removing one or more redundant species , condensates that are present , but that can be considered inert , can be removed from the calculations , which can be restarted with trial values from a previous dump file . in the process of removing a condensate from the calculations , the corresponding abundances of each element tied up in the species is removed .",
    "for example , if the condensate spinel , mgal@xmath6o@xmath9 , is present and is to be removed from the calculations , then given n(mg ) and n(mgal@xmath6o@xmath9 ) , which are , respectively , the number of gram - atoms of mg in all forms in the calculations and the number of moles of spinel , the corrected total abundance of mg is n(mg)n(mgal@xmath6o@xmath9 ) , that of al is n(al)2n(mgal@xmath6o@xmath9 ) , and that of o is n(o)4n(mgal@xmath6o@xmath9 ) , from which the relative element abundances can be obtained .    however , it was often found that at a lower temperature , removing a condensate changed the chemistry .",
    "a very good example is iron , which in our calculations normally forms the solid metal at high temperatures .",
    "if iron is retained in the calculations , at 718  k iron metal reacts with h@xmath6s to form fes , which is then the main compound of sulfur , and substantially depletes sulfur from the gas phase . if iron is removed from the calculations when it initially condenses , much more sulfur remains in the gas phase , which is then available to form the volatile condensate , nh@xmath9sh , at lower temperatures .",
    "hence , the presence of nh@xmath9sh clouds inferred in jupiter s atmosphere may be an indirect consequence of the rainout of iron metal to deeper regions .",
    "figure 1 depicts temperature  pressure profiles for 5 , 10 , 20 , and 40 atmosphere models from burrows ( 1997 ) , for ages of 0.1 , 1.0 , and 10.0 gyrs . only the 5 and 10 models are given at 0.1 gyr .",
    "the dots identify the positions of the photospheres .",
    "this set of profiles represents the general trends in brown dwarfs and egps .",
    "note that the concept of a photosphere is ambiguous , since the opacities are stiff functions of wavelength .",
    "radiation at different wavelengths decouples from a variety of disparate pressure levels . by photosphere",
    "we mean here the level at which the temperature equals the effective temperature , defined via stefan s law .",
    "this approach provides us with a sensible average position , but should not be overinterpreted .",
    "higher  mass models generally reside at higher entropies , _",
    "i.e. _ , at a given temperature level the gas is at lower pressures .",
    "however , as figure 1 demonstrates , cooling in the radiative zones above the photosphere at lower temperatures can result in a reversal of this behavior .",
    "furthermore , for a given mass the older a substellar object the lower the effective temperature and the higher the photospheric pressure .",
    "in addition , for a given age the higher the mass the higher the photospheric pressure . however , and importantly , although the effective temperature is a strong function of age and mass , the corresponding pressure at the photosphere is only weakly dependent upon these quantities , and varies within @xmath2 half a dex of 1 atmosphere .",
    "consequently , the abundances of species at the photosphere of a brown dwarf or egp are governed almost entirely by the temperature .",
    "this is an important conceptual simplification .",
    "figures 2 through 4 depict the regions of transition from one chemical species to another in temperature  pressure space for a variety of important constituents of equilibrium substellar atmospheres .",
    "anders & grevesse ( 1989 ) solar abundances are assumed ( table 1 ) .",
    "only a subset of the calculated and interesting composition boundaries are depicted .",
    "nevertheless , these figures summarize some of the diagnostic chemical sequences and transitions encountered in theoretical substellar atmospheres and the reservoirs of the major elements . superimposed on these plots are atmospheric profiles of 5 , 10 , 20 , and 40 models at 1 gyr from figure 1 .",
    "also shown for comparison on figures 2 through 4 are adiabats above and below the photospheres for more massive m dwarf models of burrows ( 1993 ) at 0.08 , 0.09 , and 0.115 @xmath40 and 1 gyr . as demonstrated in figure 1 , for a broad range of objects and ages ,",
    "the narrow band around 1 atmosphere is relevant when looking at the compositions near the photosphere .",
    "furthermore , the near verticality of the transition curves confirms that composition is most closely linked with temperature .",
    "figures 5 through 14 depict theoretical chemical equilibrium composition profiles versus temperature for gl 229b  like models ( see marley 1996 ; allard 1996 ) as a function of t@xmath1 and gravity .",
    "to avoid confusion , only a subset of the major compounds are included in the plots .",
    "implicit are the corresponding pressures from the atmosphere models of burrows ( 1997 ) .",
    "the odd  numbered figures depict the gravity dependence for t@xmath1 = 950 k and the even  numbered figures depict the t@xmath1 dependence for a gravity of 1000 m s@xmath41 .",
    "the figures are approximately in order of decreasing elemental abundance .",
    "hence , figures 5 through 14 and the curves on those figures follow the rough sequence : o , c , n , mg , si , fe , s , al , ca , na , p , k , ti , v , li , rb , and cs",
    ". we will describe each of these figures in turn , but even though they depict the range of theoretical abundance profiles for gl 229b models , they demonstrate that the sequence of chemical reservoirs of the major elements as a function of temperature varies little with model .",
    "this is a consequence of the weak pressure and gravity dependence of the equilibrium abundances and the steepness of the transition boundary curves in figures 2 through 4 relative to the model temperature  pressure profiles .",
    "hence , the sequence of dominant chemical species for an element along the entire brown dwarf / egp continuum and the transition temperatures from one species to another are very approximately universal .",
    "note that the proximity of a species to the photosphere and its importance in the emergent spectrum does vary importantly as a function of age and mass or gravity and t@xmath1 .",
    "tables 2a and 2b provide useful lists of the major chemical species of each of the most abundant elements found in the atmospheres of substellar objects .      as figures 5 and 6",
    "demonstrate , the major reservoir for oxygen in substellar atmospheres is gaseous h@xmath6o .",
    "the only significant competitor for abundant oxygen is co , but co is converted into ch@xmath9 between temperatures of 1100 and 2000 k. only at temperatures below @xmath2300 k does h@xmath6o condense , as the liquid above 273.15 k , otherwise as ice .",
    "as is well known ( fegley & lodders 1996 ) , jupiter has condensed h@xmath6o below its photosphere .",
    "as is not so well known and as is demonstrated in figure 2 , at 1 gyr a 10 object may have condensed h@xmath6o in its atmosphere .",
    "in fact , as figure 2 suggests , all but the youngest egps and those not at elevated temperatures due to proximity to a primary ( _ e.g. _ , 51 peg b , @xmath42 boo b ) should have water clouds ( burrows 1997 ) . this may importantly affect their albedos and reflected spectra ( marley 1998 ) .    as alluded to above and as shown in figures 5 and 6 ,",
    "the major reservoirs of carbon are co and ch@xmath9 .",
    "the reaction @xmath43 and le chatelier s principle indicate that for a given temperature co is favored at low pressures and gravities .",
    "co is also favored at high temperatures and for models with high t@xmath1s . from figures 5 and 6 ,",
    "it is expected that in gl 229b co will convert into ch@xmath9 between temperatures of 1300 and 1800 k , depending upon t@xmath1 and gravity . to put equilibrium co closer to the photosphere in gl 229b ,",
    "high t@xmath1s and lower gravities are preferred .",
    "this makes the interpretation of the detection in gl 229b of co at 4.67 ( noll , geballe , & marley 1997 ) problematic , since co is not expected in great abundance near the photosphere for t@xmath1s near 950 k. this may imply that the higher co abundances at the higher temperatures at depth are being advected out of equilibrium into the cooler regions of the photosphere and that the kinetics of the reaction might have to be considered .",

    "rubidium and cesium form the chloride as well , but at temperatures that are 200 to 300 k lower than does li . nevertheless , the alkali metals survive in atomic form to lower temperatures than do the other true metals .",
    "since they are less refractory and survive in monatomic form for a longer stretch of temperature , the alkali metals should manifest themselves in the spectra of transition objects after the other metals ( _ e.g. _ , fe , ca , ti , v , mg , al ) are depleted and rainout , as described above and in  4 . very approximately , the order of disappearance of the atom with decreasing temperature from @xmath21500 k to @xmath21200 k should be : li , na , cs , rb , k , with cs , rb , and k disappearing at about the same temperature .",

    "however , two cesium lines are clearly visible in its spectrum ( oppenheimer 1998 ) . along with the anomalous ( see figures 2 , 5 , and 6 ) detection of co in the cold atmosphere of gl 229b alluded to above , the atomic cesium detections may imply that its convective zone extends below 1500 k to @xmath21200 k and that some of its chemistry is not in equilibrium . in principle",
    ", grain and cloud opacities can extend the convective zone beyond the range theoretically predicted without them ( burrows 1997 ) . the necessity to include chemical kinetics in the convective zones",
    "will further complicate the theoretical treatment of brown dwarf atmospheres .",
    "due to its small abundance , fluorine is not a very important element , but its chemistry is similar to that of chlorine . in these calculations ,",
    "most of fluorine is in hf , with much of the remainder being in the gas  phase alkali fluorides .",
    "chlorine is combined in hcl , with much of the rest at low temperatures being in the gas  phase alkali metal chlorides .",
    "the equilibrium abundance calculations we presented in  3 are fiducial reference models in the study of the atmospheric compositions of brown dwarfs and egps , in general , and of gl 229b , in particular .",
    "tables 2a and 2b and figures 2 through 14 summarize the results and the major trends .",
    "however , as demonstrated in the gl 229b campaign and in attempts to fit its spectrum , there is strong evidence that heavy metals , such as ca , fe , ti , v , si , al , and mg , are depleted in gl 229b s atmosphere ( marley 1996 ) .",
    "in addition , such depletions are manifest in the atmospheres of jupiter and saturn .",
    "this is altogether to be expected , since the grains that condense below temperatures of @xmath22500 k should form droplets and rain out of the atmosphere .",
    "this `` rainout '' will carry the condensate s elements to depth .",
    "the lower boundary of the grain cloud deck should be near where the object s temperature  pressure profile intersects the condensate s `` clausius  clapyron '' lines ( see figures 24 ) , but its upper boundary is more difficult to determine . the physical extent of the clouds is a function of the character of convection and the meteorology of the atmosphere .",
    "the droplet sizes are determined by the poorly  understood processes of nucleation , coagulation , and breakup . furthermore",
    ", the high opacity of the grains can turn an otherwise radiative zone into a convective zone , and , thereby , influence the cloud extent and composition . in principle , if a convective zone were well  mixed and the chemical kinetics were suitably fast , the compositions in the convective zones would closely follow the equilibrium abundance patterns described in  3 .",
    "however , the condensibles are likely to settle and concentrate at depth . in short , due to the low temperatures of substellar atmospheres , we would expect a variety of cloud layers with a variety of compositions both above and below their photospheres . which clouds dominate is expected to be a function of the object s effective temperature , gravity , and metallicity .",
    "the equilibrium calculations are a straightforward guide in determining the likely cloud chemicals and layers as a function of depth ( temperature ) .",
    "however , it is not known where the tops of these cloud decks will reside . the condensates that form from temperatures of @xmath22400 k to @xmath21400 k ( _ e.g. _ , akermanite , spinel , fe , enstatite , fosterite , the titanates , mns , high albite ) have in a gl 229b column total grammages above a few gm @xmath11 .",
    "the optical depth of a column of monodispensed grains is approximately    @xmath53    where @xmath25 is the pressure at the base of the cloud layer of a given composition , @xmath54 is the mixing ratio of the cloud particles , @xmath55 is the gravity , @xmath56 is the extinction parameter in mie theory , @xmath57 is the cloud grammage , @xmath58 in the density of a grain , and @xmath14 is the grain radius .",
    "the term with @xmath25 in it assumes that the atmosphere is completely depleted in the corresponding refractory down to the cloud base . from eq.([optical ] ) , we can readily calculate that the predominantly silicate and iron cloud layers below the photosphere of gl 229b are quite optically thick ( @xmath59 ) , the precise thickness depending crucially upon grain radius . grain radii would have to exceed 1 cm to render these clouds transparent , whereas it is expected that the mean @xmath14 will be below 100 @xmath60 m  ( lunine 1989 ) .",
    "hence , these regions are expected to be more vigorously convective than would be expected without grain opacity and the convective zone may extend to lower pressures and temperatures .",
    "this phenomenon may help to explain the anomalous detections of cs ( oppenheimer 1998 ) and co ( noll , geballe , & marley 1997 ) in gl 229b , particularly if disequilibrium chemistry is involved , though a detached convective zone ( marley  1996 ) may also be implicated .",
    "however , the rainout of a high  temperature refractory will leave the upper regions of brown dwarf and egp atmospheres depleted in the refractory s constituent elements , in stoichiometric ratios .",
    "the lower  temperature chemical species will be assembled from the depleted elemental mixture . as a consequence",
    ", chemical abundances will be altered from the values assuming an anders & grevesse ( 1989 ) mixture at all altitudes (  3 ) .",
    "we attempt to explore this process with a series of artificial `` rainout '' calculations in which we progressively sequester from the calculation the elements involved in grain formation . from some starting temperature that defines each exercise ( either 1000 , 1400 , or 2000 k : trial 1 , 2 , or 3 ) , every 200 k we deplete the atmosphere ( in stoichiometric ratios ) of the elements found in the chemical species that condense in that temperature interval . in the lower 200 k interval",
    ", we perform the equilibrium calculations with a composition depleted in the constituent elements of the higher temperature refractories .",
    "this simulates in a crude way the progressive depletion and rainout of refractory elements from the entire atmosphere as we go down to lower temperatures ( higher altitudes , lower pressures ) .",
    "for example , for trial 3 , we progressively deplete from the atmosphere the constituents of the refractories formed at 2000 k , 1800 k , 1600 k , 1400 k , 1200 k , 1000 k , 800 k , and 600 k. for trial 1 , we do the same for 1000 k , 800 k , and 600 k , but with an anders & grevesse mixture leave in equilibrium the layers at higher temperatures . a major motivation for this exercise is the identification of likely condensates in the _ upper _ atmosphere of gl 229b , below temperatures of 1000 k , that may be implicated in the muting of the `` optical '' spectrum observed from @xmath21 to @xmath20.8 ( oppenheimer 1998 ) .",
    "the different trials represent our attempt to bracket the results .",
    "if this procedure consistently identifies specific low  temperature refractory compounds below @xmath21000 k at useful cloud grammages then we may have a reasonable hint at the culprits .",
    "tables 3a and 3b depict the results of these trials below 1000 k. the temperature  pressure profile used is for a gl 229b model with a t@xmath1 of 950 k and a gravity of @xmath61 cm s@xmath41 ( burrows 1997 ) .",
    "the species listed have condensed either in the 8001000 k range ( table 3a ) or in the 600800 k range ( table 3b ) , after the corresponding depletions have been carried out at depth by the described procedure .",
    "certain features are readily apparent .",
    "first , the grammages of the clouds formed at altitude are significantly below the few gm @xmath11 for silicates at depth .",
    "this is encouraging , since only modest optical depths are needed to explain the shorter  wavelength gl 229b data . from eq.([optical ] ) , a grammage of only @xmath7 gm @xmath11 with a particle radius of 0.1 provides close to unit optical depth .",
    "( note that small particles are expected in radiative zones . )",
    "second , the `` abundant '' low  temperature refractories are predominantly the chlorides and the sulfides .",
    "in particular , kcl , nacl , naf , and sis@xmath6 stand out , with sis@xmath6 dominating for trial 3 . without depletion ,",
    "sis@xmath6 would not form in abundance , but progressive depletion starting at the highest temperatures is needed for it to become important . if sis@xmath6 forms , it does so around 743 k , whereas naf forms near 920 k , nacl forms near 800 k , and kcl forms near 740 k. be that as it may , the sodium and potassium salts emerge as cloud candidates in gl 229b s upper atmosphere , with grammages that may range from @xmath62 to @xmath63 gm @xmath11 . in trial 3 , though the kcl cloud is thin , the sis@xmath6 is thick .",
    "these calculations suggest that thin clouds of non  silicate , low  temperature refractories can and do exist in the upper atmosphere of gl 229b .",
    "furthermore , they may also reside in the atmospheres of brown dwarfs with t@xmath1s below about 1400 k ( ? ) .",
    "hence , it is expected that many cloud layers with different compositions are formed both above and below the photospheres of brown dwarfs and egps . at times , from the lowest effective temperatures up , clouds of either nh@xmath38 ( t@xmath1 @xmath0 250 k ) , h@xmath6o ( t@xmath1 @xmath0 400 k ) , chlorides , sulfides , iron , or silicates should be found in these exotic substellar and late m dwarf atmospheres .",
    "we have explored in detail the abundance profiles and compositions expected in the atmospheres of brown dwarfs and egps . in chemical equilibrium , the major reservoirs of the dominant elements shift with pressure and , most importantly , with temperature in ways reflected in figures 2 through 14 and in tables 2a and 2b . unlike in any other stellar context , chemistry and",
    "molecules assume a central role in determining the character of the atmospheres of substellar objects .",
    "as the temperature decreases with increasing height in such an atmosphere , molecules not encountered in m dwarfs or in standard stellar atmospheres form . at the higher temperatures , the standard refractories , such as the silicates , spinel , and iron , condense out into grain clouds which by their large opacity lower the t@xmath1 and luminosity of the main sequence edge ( burrows 1993 ) and alter in detectable ways the spectra of objects around the transition mass ( jones & tsuji 1997 ) .",
    "as t@xmath1 decreases below that at the stellar edge , the classical refractories are buried progressively deeper below the photosphere and less refractory condensates and gas  phase molecules come to dominate ( marley 1996 ; burrows 1997 ) .    below temperatures of @xmath21500 k ,",
    "our calculations demonstrate and confirm that the alkali metals , which are not as refractory as fe , al , ca , ti , v , and mg , emerge as important atmospheric and spectral constituents . at still lower temperatures , chlorides and sulfides appear , some of which will condense in the cooler upper atmosphere and form clouds that will affect emergent spectra and albedos .",
    "cloud decks of many different compositions at many different temperature levels are expected , depending upon t@xmath1 ( and weakly upon gravity ) .",
    "we expect that clouds of chlorides and sulfides ( not silicates ) , at temperature levels below @xmath21000 k , are responsible for the steeper slope observed in the spectrum of gl 229b at the shorter wavelengths ( oppenheimer 1998 ) . at slightly higher temperatures , mns , zns , naalsi@xmath38o@xmath39",
    ", kalsi@xmath38o@xmath39 , v@xmath6o@xmath38 , mg@xmath38p@xmath6o@xmath39 , and mgti@xmath6o@xmath49 may play a role , but only if their constituents are not scavenged into more refractory compounds and rained out deeper down .    as t@xmath1 decreases ( either as a given mass cools or , for a given age , as we study objects with lower masses ) , the major atmospheric constituents of brown dwarfs and egps change .",
    "this change is reflected in which spectral features are most prominent and in the albedos of substellar objects near their primaries .",
    "hence , specific mixes of atoms , molecules , and clouds can serve as approximate t@xmath1 and temperature indicators and a composition scale can be established . in order to do this definitively , synthetic spectra with the atmospheres we have calculated are required . however , the composition trends we have identified are suitably dramatic that reasonable molecular indicators of spectral type can be suggested",
    ". a workable sequence might be : tio disappears ( at 23002000 k ) , refractory silicates and fe(c ) appear ( at 23002000 k ) , mg@xmath6sio@xmath9 appears ( at 1900 k ) , vo(g ) disappears ( at 17001900 k ) , mgsio@xmath38 appears ( at 1700 k ) , silicates rainout ( at @xmath21400 k ( ? ) ) , crh disappears ( @xmath21400 k ) , li @xmath51 licl ( @xmath01400 k ) , co @xmath51 ch@xmath9 ( 12001500 k ) , ( rb , cs , k ) @xmath51 chlorides ( @xmath0 1200 k ) , ph@xmath38 @xmath51 ( p@xmath9o@xmath50 , mg@xmath38p@xmath6o@xmath39 ) ( @xmath0 1000 k ) , formation of naf , nacl , and kcl clouds and various sulfide clouds ( @xmath27001100 k ) , n@xmath6 @xmath51 nh@xmath38(g ) ( @xmath2700 k ) , h@xmath6o(g ) @xmath51 h@xmath6o(c ) ( @xmath2350 k ) , and nh@xmath38 @xmath51 ( nh@xmath38(c ) , nh@xmath9sh(c ) ) ( @xmath2200 k ) .",

    "given the ambiguities in cloud physics and theoretical meteorology , new observations will be crucial to educate and guide theory concerning the true nature of substellar atmospheres .",
    "nevertheless , it is clear that brown dwarfs and giant planets occupy an exciting new realm of science midway between astronomy and planetary studies in which new insights and for which new tools must be developed .",
    "the theoretical study of substellar objects with t@xmath1s between those of jupiter and the stars has only just now begun in earnest .",
