    "erosion tungsten is the favoured material for the wall regions of highest particle and heat load in a fusion reactor vessel  @xcite .",
    "inevitably , tungsten atoms and ions are released from the walls and enter the plasma . with their high atomic number , @xmath7 ,",
    "they do not become fully stripped of electrons and therefore radiate copiously , so that the tolerable fraction of tungsten impurity in the plasma is at most 2@xmath810@xmath9  @xcite .",
    "understanding and controlling tungsten in a plasma requires detailed knowledge about its collisional and spectroscopic properties . although not directly relevant to fusion , photoionization of tungsten atoms and ions is interesting because it can provide details about spectroscopic aspects and , as time - reversed photorecombination , helps to better understand one of the most important atomic collision processes in a fusion plasma , electron - ion recombination .",
    "r - matrix theory is a tool to obtain information about electron - ion and photon - ion interactions in general .",
    "electron - impact ionization and recombination of tungsten ions have been studied experimentally  @xcite while there are no detailed measurements on electron - impact excitation of tungsten atoms in any charge state .",
    "thus , the present study on photoionization of these complex ions and the comparison of experimental data with r - matrix calculations provides benchmarks and guidance for future theoretical work on electron - impact excitation .",
    "photoabsorption by neutral tungsten atoms in the gas phase has been studied experimentally by costello et al . employing the dual - laser - plasma technique  @xcite .",
    "a few years later the production of w@xmath6 and w@xmath10 photo - ions from tungsten vapor was observed by sladeczek et al .",
    "however , no experimental data have been available in the literature for tungsten ions prior to the present project .",
    "direct photoionization of w@xmath11 ions is included in the calculations by trzhaskovskaya et al .",

    "theoretical treatment of photoabsorption using a relativistic hartree - fock ( rhf ) approach was reported by sladeczek et al .",

    "very recently , ballance and mclaughlin have carried out large - scale r - matrix calculations for the neutral tungsten atom  @xcite using the dirac - coulomb r - matrix approximation implemented in the darc codes .",
    "the present study is the first investigation on photoionization of tungsten ions and addresses singly charged w@xmath6 .",
    "preliminary reports on our ongoing tungsten photoionization project were presented at conferences  @xcite previously .",
    "the ground level of the ta - like w@xmath0 ion is @xmath12 with an ionization potential of ( 16.37 @xmath13 0.15 )  ev  @xcite .",
    "one must assume that along with the @xmath14 ground level , the excited ground - configuration fine - structure levels @xmath15 with @xmath2=3/2 , 5/2 , 7/2 and 9/2 at excitation energies below 0.8  ev  @xcite , respectively , are also populated in an ion source that produces w@xmath0 by electron - impact ionization of neutral tungsten .",
    "also the lowest levels of the first excited @xmath16 and @xmath17 configurations have excitation energies below 2  ev and are likely populated in the ion - source plasma .",
    "the energetically lowest configurations @xmath18 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 all have even parity and , hence , all the 118 excited levels within these configurations are long - lived because electric dipole transitions between any of these levels are forbidden . any strong signal in the experimental photoionization spectrum below the threshold of ( 16.37 @xmath13 0.15 )",
    "ev would indicate the presence of metastable excited states in the parent ion beam , most likely within the @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 terms .",
    "the direct and resonant photoionization processes occurring in the present energy range up to 245  ev for the interaction of a single photon with the ground - state and the lowest metastable configurations of the ta - like tungsten ion comprise removal or excitation of either a @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 or a @xmath26 electron . for the theoretical description of w@xmath6 photoionization suitable target wave functions have to be constructed that allow for promotions of electrons from these subshells to all contributing excited states .",
    "this is challenging for a low - charge ion such as w@xmath6 but becomes simpler for the ions in higher charge states due to the increased effect of the coulomb charge of the target and the slight reduction in the r - matrix box size .",

    "5 conclusions are drawn from the present investigation .",
    "an appendix has been added to describe corrections of measured photoionization cross sections for effects of higher - order radiation present in the photon beam particularly at low photon energies .",
    "the measurements on photoionization of w@xmath0 ions were carried out at the ion - photon beam ( ipb ) endstation of beamline 10.0.1.2 at the advanced light source als in berkeley , california , usa .",
    "the general layout of the experimental setup and the procedures employed have been described previously by covington  @xcite .",
    "technological developments since these early measurements have been discussed recently by mller  @xcite .",
    "an overview of the experiment is presented here and aspects specific to the present measurements are discussed in detail .",
    "ta - like w@xmath6 ions were produced from w(co)@xmath27 vapour in an electron - cyclotron - resonance ( ecr ) ion source .",
    "the ions were extracted and accelerated to ground potential by a voltage of 6  kv forming a beam of ions that was composed of a complex mixture of electrically charged fragments of the initial tungsten hexacarbonyl molecules .",
    "the ion beam was steered and focused electrostatically to the entrance aperture of a 60@xmath28-bending - angle dipole magnet which separated the ions with respect to their momentum per charge .",
    "a beam of isotopically pure @xmath29w@xmath6 ions was selected by appropriately choosing the field of the analyzer magnet .",
    "the @xmath29w@xmath6 ion beam emerging from the exit aperture of the magnet was deflected by a hemispherical electrostatic 90@xmath28 deflector , the  merger  , onto the axis of the counter - propagating narrow - bandwidth photon beam provided at the beamline .",
    "w@xmath10 product ions formed as a result of interactions of single photons with single w@xmath0 parent ions were separated from the parent ion beam by a second magnet positioned downstream of the interaction region ( upstream of the photon beam ) .",
    "this so called  demerger ",
    "magnet deflected the product ion beam by 45@xmath28 so that it could enter a single - particle detector unit while the parent ion beam , deflected by half that angle , was collected by a large faraday cup .",
    "the detector unit consists of a hemispherical electrostatic 90@xmath28 deflector , a variable - size aperture based on a four - jaw movable - slit system and a single - particle detector with almost 100% efficiency  @xcite .",
    "the additional deflection served to decouple the detector from stray particles and photons produced in the deflection plane of the demerger magnet as well as to sweep the product beam across the detector in a direction orthogonal to that by the demerging magnet to ensure complete detection of products .    for optimizing w@xmath10 signal count rates",
    "the ion beam was tuned for maximum overlap with the photon beam positioned on the axis of the merging section of the apparatus between the  merger  deflector and the  demerger",
    "the overlap of the ion and photon beams was quantified by using three slit scanners at the entrance , exit , and middle position of the photon - ion interaction region which was defined by a metal drift tube with entrance and exit apertures .",
    "each slit scanner could probe the overlapping beams in two directions perpendicular to one another thus providing access to the form factor @xmath30  @xcite at each position z. the total form factor @xmath31 characterizing the three - dimensional overlap of the two beams in the interaction region was then obtained by interpolation of the position - dependent form factors @xmath30 considering that the trajectories of ions and photons within the interaction region are straight lines .    for maximum reduction of background arising from collisions of w@xmath6 parent ions with residual - gas particles along the whole merging section",
    "the pressure in this section was kept at a minimum .",
    "operating pressures ranged from about 3 to 5@xmath32  mbar . for separation of the signal of photoionized tungsten ions from background of collisionally - produced w@xmath10 ions",
    "the photon beam was chopped at approximately 6  hz during the data acquisition so that the background and signal - plus - background count rates could be measured separately . by subtracting the former from the latter",
    "the instantaneous signal count rate was recovered .",
    "total signal counting times up to hundreds of seconds were used to obtain suitable levels of statistics .",
    "two modes of operation were applied to obtain information about the photoionization cross section of w@xmath6 ions . in ",
    "spectroscopy mode ",
    "the voltage on the interaction region was set to 0  v so that signal could be collected from the whole merging section ( approximately 1.4  m length ) between the  merger  and  demerger  units . at constant but unknown beam overlap",
    "the energy dependent w@xmath10 signal count rate @xmath33 ( obtained by chopping the photon beam ) was recorded as a function of photon energy @xmath34 .",
    "these energy - scan measurements were carried out at 100  mev constant resolution covering an energy range from 16 to 108  ev in 50  mev steps ( at energies below 27.1  ev the beamline provides beams with lower bandwidths ; at a fixed maximum exit slit width of 1300  @xmath35 m the beamline resolution gradually drops from 100  mev at 27.1  ev to about 36  mev at 16  ev . ) at the same time the primary - ion and photon fluxes , @xmath36 and @xmath37 , respectively , were recorded so that a normalized relative cross section @xmath38 could be obtained for each energy step .",
    "as already mentioned , the ion beam was collected in a large faraday cup and its electrical current @xmath39 was measured with a precision electrometer with @xmath40 being the elementary charge .",
    "the photons were collected on the sensitive area of a calibrated photodiode .",
    "the photocurrent @xmath41 was measured with a similar electrometer where @xmath42 is the known conversion efficiency of the photodiode , i.e. , the number of electrons per incident photon .",
    "the relative cross section function obtained by energy - scan measurements was normalized afterwards to absolute cross sections measured in a separate phase of the experiment .    in  absolute mode ",
    "absolute cross - sections @xmath43 at selected photon energies @xmath34 were determined from @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the charge state of the primary ions , @xmath46 the primary ion velocity and @xmath47 the detection efficiency of the product - ion detector system .",
    "the quantities @xmath48 , @xmath49 and @xmath50 are readily obtained from the experiment , @xmath42 and @xmath47 are known from separate calibration measurements .",
    "the determination of the conversion efficiency @xmath42 was performed with reference to a photodiode calibrated by nist  ( for this service see url http://www.nist.gov/pml/div685/calibrations.cfm ) . in order to determine @xmath51",
    "the interaction length has to be experimentally defined . for this purpose the photoionized ( w@xmath10 ) ions produced in the interaction region",
    "were energy - tagged by applying a voltage of + 500  v to the metal tube defining the interaction region .",
    "parent w@xmath0 ions were decelerated to an energy of 5.5  kev when entering the interaction region .",
    "product w@xmath10 ions generated inside the drift tube were accelerated to 6.5  kev when leaving the interaction region thus gaining a net total energy of 6.5  kev compared to the 6  kev of those w@xmath10 ions which were formed outside of the interaction region .",
    "the interaction length could thus be defined as the  inside  length of the potential barrier applied to the drift tube which was ( 29.4@xmath130.6 )  cm .",
    "the downstream demerger and detection unit can easily separate w@xmath10 ions with energies of 6 and 6.5  kev energy .",
    "the energy - tagged 6.5  kev w@xmath10 ions unambiguously arise from the defined interaction length of 29.4  cm and are associated with the measured total form factor @xmath52 .",
    "typical ion currents in collimated beams used for the absolute measurements were 15  na .",
    "photon fluxes strongly depended on the energy @xmath34 and the desired energy bandwidth . for consistency ,",
    "most absolute measurements were performed at 45  mev bandwidth defined by suitable settings of the monochromator slits . in a few cases bandwiths of 50  mev and 70  mev",
    "were employed which did not have a significant influence on the cross section results .",
    "this was expected given the fact that the measurements were carried out at energies where there were no obvious resonances in the spectrum .",
    "numbers for the photon flux were about @xmath53  s@xmath54 at 16  ev , @xmath55  s@xmath54 at 40  ev , @xmath56  s@xmath54 at 120  ev , and @xmath57  s@xmath54 at 245  ev .",
    "total beam overlaps @xmath52 varied in the absolute measurements between about 200  cm@xmath54 and 500  cm@xmath54 .",
    "signal count rates varied from 40  khz at 40 ev to 0.8  hz at 245  ev .",
    "background count rates were near 1  hz .    the present measurements were extended to energies down to 16  ev because the ground - level ionization energy is expected to be at ( 16.37 @xmath13 0.15 )  ev  @xcite .",
    "this energy is stretching the range of applicability of the available low - energy - grating monochromator of the beamline .",
    "a serious problem at such low energies is the rapidly decreasing photon flux while the fraction of higher - order radiation is increasing relative to the first - order flux .",
    "while corrections for higher - order effects on cross sections measured at the ipb endstation of bl 10.0.1.2 at the als have been applied previously  @xcite , a more extensive assessment of such effects was in order due to the increased relative magnitudes of these contributions .",
    "their effect is further increased in the case of w@xmath6 because the photoionization cross sections at twice and three times the ground - state ionization threshold energy are relatively large .",
    "fractions of higher - order radiation were determined by separate experiments which are described in the appendix . from the results of that investigation corrections",
    "were derived for the measured apparent cross sections .",
    "the corrections are large for the lowest photon energies reaching almost a factor of 2 at 16  ev . at 20",
    "ev the correction is down to 37% and at 25  ev amounts to only 17% which is less than the typical uncertainty of absolute measurements of photoionization cross sections at the als ipb endstation .",
    "the error budget of cross section measurements has recently been discussed by mller  @xcite who estimated a systematic uncertainty of 19% for cross sections determined by the use of eq .",
    "[ eq : xsec ] .",
    "this uncertainty includes the uncertainty of the photodiode calibration curve .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the quoted possible error of the calibration is only about 1% in the energy range 37.5  ev to 170  ev .",
    "this precludes significant changes of the photoionization spectrum due to uncertainties of the calibration curve - at least in the energy range where this uncertainty is negligibly small .",
    "the energies investigated in the publication by mller  @xcite ( @xmath59  ev ) were far beyond the region where significant corrections for higher - order effects would be required . in the present study",
    ", however , the uncertainty of the higher - order corrections has to be considered .",
    "moreover , the photodiode used in the present experiment had already been exposed to substantial photon doses .",
    "therefore the photon flux measured with the present photodiode was compared with the response of a calibrated pristine photodiode covering the whole energy range investigated here for which three different gratings were used in the monochromator .",
    "the comparison showed an average reduction of the diode conversion efficiency of 5% for the heavily used diode .",
    "this fatigue effect was corrected for . on the basis of the observed fluctuations the additional relative uncertainty of the photon flux measurements with the two photodiodes",
    "was estimated to be 9% and the associated absolute uncertainties were included in quadrature in the total systematic uncertainty . in addition , an uncertainty of 50% of the difference between the uncorrected and the higher - order - corrected cross section ( see appendix ) was assumed .",
    "the associated absolute uncertainty as well as the statistical uncertainty of the measured count rate @xmath48 was added in quadrature in order to obtain an estimate of the total possible error of the cross section .",
    "total absolute error bars are shown for absolute cross sections in sec .",
    "[ sec : results ] .",
    "in addition , the photon - energy calibration of the present measurements has uncertainties .",
    "the counterpropagation of the photon and ion beams results in small doppler effects of @xmath60 of the actual photon energy .",
    "corrections of @xmath34 are thus at most 62  mev at 245  ev .",
    "the uncertainties of such corrections are negligible .",
    "the energy axis was cross - calibrated to known resonance positions in the photoionization of ar@xmath6 ions .",
    "since there are no sharp cross section features in the investigated energy range the calibration of the energy axis was not a prime issue .",
    "we estimate a maximum uncertainty of the energy axis of at most @xmath13100  mev in the energy range 16 to 80  ev where the only structures in the cross section occur .    as mentioned in the introduction , the 118 excited levels ( plus the ground level ) in the lowest - energy configurations @xmath18 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 of w@xmath0 are all expected to be long lived . in principle , they can all be populated by energetic electron collisions in the plasma of the ecr ion source  @xcite .",
    "it is not _ a priori _ evident , however , which levels are populated at what relative weight .",
    "given the small energy splitting of fine - structure levels within a given term , it is reasonable to assume that all levels within that term are populated and that the population is statistical , i.e. , it follows the statistical weight of each level within the term . in this context",
    "it may be worth mentioning that measurements on the photoionization of w@xmath0 ions have been carried out over a time range of 5 years during 4 different beamtimes at the als .",
    "energy - scan spectra in certain energy ranges were taken repeatedly and with different operation modes of the ion source . nevertheless , the scan measurements and particularly the cross section features at certain energies were always reproducible .",
    "this is a strong indication for consistent and reproducible sets of initial - level populations in the primary ion beams used in all those experiments .",
    "the photoionization cross section results suggest that there was a strong , maybe even dominant , contribution from ions in the lowest - energy term , the @xmath61d term , within the @xmath62 ground - state configuration .",
    "for comparison with the measurements made at the als , state - of - the - art theoretical methods using highly correlated wavefunctions were applied that include relativistic effects .",
    "an efficient parallel version @xcite of the darc @xcite suite of codes was applied which has been developed @xcite to address electron and photon interactions with atomic systems providing for hundreds of levels and thousands of scattering channels .",
    "these codes are presently running on a variety of parallel high performance computing architectures world wide @xcite .",
    "recently , darc calculations on photoionization of trans - fe elements were carried out for se@xmath0 , kr@xmath0 , xe@xmath0 , and xe@xmath63 ions @xcite showing suitable agreement with high resolution als measurements .",
    "photoionization cross section calculations on ta - like w@xmath6 ions were performed for 10 selected levels in the ground and the lowest excited configurations @xmath64 , @xmath65 and @xmath66 .",
    "the atomic structure calculations for the w@xmath10 product ion were carried out using the grasp code @xcite .",
    "we included 573 levels in our close - coupling calculations resulting from the 6 configurations @xmath67 , @xmath68 , @xmath69 , @xmath70 , @xmath71 and @xmath72 to represent the atomic structure of the w@xmath10 residual ion .",
    "the 573-level approximation is the simplest approximation which allows for the opening of both the @xmath25 and @xmath24 subshell .",
    "alternatively , a 449-level model based on the 6 configurations @xmath67 , @xmath68 , @xmath69 , @xmath70 , @xmath71 and @xmath73 was used to see possible differences in the representation of the atomic structure of w@xmath10 levels .    in table 1",
    "we show a comparison of the 449-level and 573-level target approximations obtained from the grasp code with the tabulated values from nist .",
    "note the difficulty of accurately describing the energy levels in the two approximations for near neutral states of tungsten .",
    "larger target expansions ( allowing for two - electron promotions to higher lying residual orbitals , and the opening of further inner shells ) would naturally bring the theoretical results in better agreement with experiment but would be prohibitive for scattering and photoionization calculations .",
    "in other words , extending the basis set for describing photoionization of w@xmath6 with its open @xmath25 and @xmath26 subshells by including more configurations of the w@xmath10 product ion would quickly increase the number of levels and thus require a computational effort that would go well beyond the limitations set by presently available computing resources .",
    "therefore , the 573-level approximation has to be considered a reasonable compromise between adequate representation of the tungsten ion structure and feasibility of the photoionization computations at the present technical limit of _ ab initio _ close - coupling treatment .",
    "the cross section calculations for this 573-level model were carried out in the dirac - coulomb approximation using the darc codes @xcite for photon energies from the ionization thresholds up to 150  ev . the r - matrix boundary radius of 10.88 bohr radii was sufficient to envelop the radial extent of all the n=6 atomic orbitals of the residual w@xmath10 ion .",
    "a basis of 16 continuum orbitals was sufficient to span the photon energy range chosen for the calculations . since dipole",
    "selection rules apply , total ground - state photoionization cross sections require only the bound - free dipole matrices , @xmath74 . whereas for the excited metastable states then , @xmath75 and @xmath76 , @xmath77 , @xmath78 are necessary .    .",

    "@xmath181 the sequence appears to indicate that higher order fractions substantially decrease with @xmath149 . by assuming that the fractions with @xmath182 can be neglected and that the fractions @xmath183 and @xmath184 ( and hence also @xmath185 ) are smooth functions of @xmath34 one finds that @xmath183 is a bell shaped function of @xmath34 with a maximum of approximately 3% at about 45  ev and only 1% at 27 and 66  ev .",
    "consistent with previous observation  @xcite the dominant fraction @xmath184 is about 6% at 20  ev but drops off more slowly with increasing photon energy than previously assumed .",
