    "early - type galaxies such as ellipticals and bulge - dominated lenticular galaxies are expected to form and grow through a number of major and minor mergers in the @xmath0 cold dark matter ( @xmath0cdm ) universe @xcite .",
    "today , the most massive galaxies in the universe are mostly bulge - dominated early - type galaxies , which is consistent with this view of the galaxy evolution .",
    "if the hierarchical galaxy formation model in the @xmath0cdm universe is correct , these massive early - type galaxies should reveal properties that reflect the model predictions .",
    "sizes of galaxies have been recognized as one of the key galaxy properties that are useful for testing the galaxy evolution models .",
    "for early - type galaxies , sizes can reflect their merger history ",
    "dissipationless mergers such as dry mergers can increase galaxy sizes in proportion to mass change , while dissipational merger ( wet merger ) does not , leading to a scale relation that is different at low and high mass .",
    "indeed , many studies have shown that the mass  size relation of early - type galaxies can be a result of hierarchical growth @xcite .",
    "it is found that the most massive part ( @xmath3 ) of the mass  size relation is curved in such a way that their sizes are larger than the linear relation of less massive galaxies @xcite .",
    "the curvature of scaling relations in early - type galaxies can be found in other relations such as color , velocity dispersion , axis ratio , and color gradient  mass @xcite .",
    "interestingly , all the relations have a special point at @xmath4 where the slopes begin to change .",
    "the studies suggest that this is due to an increased role of galaxy assembly by major mergers above this point .",
    "the mass  size relation can be examined further as a function of environment to test the hierarchical galaxy formation models .",
    "the @xmath0cdm cosmological models predict that galaxies form early in dense environments , and they are expected to undergo more merging activities than in less dense environments . if early - type galaxies are products of merging activities , their properties are expected to reflect the environmental dependence in the @xmath0cdm cosmological models .",
    "for example , their color gradients are found to be flatter in cluster environments due to mixing of stars through frequent merging @xcite .",
    "the past merger history should be reflected in sizes of early - type galaxies as well . in terms of environmental dependence , we expect the following . the galaxy evolution is accelerated in dense environments , so that massive galaxies formed early and had undergone merging activities and their sizes grew rapidly through dry merging at the massive end . on the other hand ,",
    "early - type galaxies in less dense environments are catching up the evolutionary stages that cluster early - type galaxies underwent , and their sizes are relatively smaller for a given galaxy mass .",
    "consequently , hierarchical galaxy simulation models predict the environmental dependence of the mass  size relation @xcite .",
    "these models predict that galaxies living in massive halos today are larger than their counterparts by a factor of @xmath5  @xmath6 .    in spite of such a prediction",
    ", previous studies on early - type galaxies at @xmath7 have found that there is no environmental dependence in their mass  size relation @xcite . on the other hand , there are studies suggesting that early - type galaxies in cluster environments are larger ( @xmath8  @xmath9 or more ) than their counterparts in fields at @xmath10 @xcite . in contrast , @xcite could not find environmental dependence at the high redshift . at intermediate redshift ( @xmath11 ) , studies show mixed results with @xcite or without @xcite environmental dependence . some studies even claim that field galaxies are even slightly larger than their counterparts in clusters @xcite . to sum up",

    "results at intermediate redshifts are mixed .",
    "the current status of the observational studies is summarized in table [ tabint ] with various information and special remarks .",
    "the discrepancy between the low - redshift results and the model predictions can be possibly caused by the mass range considered .",
    "for example , the mass range of the sample of @xcite is limited to @xmath12 , and they have a small number of objects ( @xmath13 ) at @xmath14 , making it difficult to find any environmental dependence beyond @xmath15 . the small sample sizes of some of the studies , especially at the massive end , also make it difficult to judge the robustness of the results .",
    "additionally , a decrease of the environmental dependence from high redshift to low redshift @xcite could be the reason for the contradiction between results for high redshift and low redshift .    in this paper",
    ", we provide enough number statistics especially at massive end in the study of the mass  size relation .",
    "more specifically , we examine environmental dependence of the mass  size relation of 73,116 early - type galaxies in the local universe ( @xmath16 ) , especially for massive galaxies ( @xmath17 ) .",
    "they are on top of the hierarchical assembly tree ; therefore , we can expect that they have had more chances to be affected by environment in their assembly histories . through this work",

    "the figure indicates that our nonparametric method well recovers the sizes of the simulated galaxies regardless of the input models . moreover ,",

    "the disk is considered to be unstable and the mass of the inner part of the disk is transferred to the bulge .    in order to understand the environmental dependence of the mass  size relation , we analyzed merger histories of all the simulated galaxies we selected and counted the number of major mergers and minor mergers that each galaxy has experienced .",
    "we classify a merger as a major merger when progenitors are more massive than @xmath254 and the mass ratios of the progenitors are larger than 0.3 ( @xmath255 ) . on the other hand",
    ", a minor merger is defined as a merger when progenitors are more massive than @xmath256 and the mass ratios of them are in the range of @xmath257 .",

    "we show here mass  size relations of early - type galaxies analyzed in many different ways to demonstrate that our main conclusion of the environmental dependence is not affected by details of how the sample is analyzed .",
    "first , we show that the exclusion of the objects with close bright neighbors ( see section [ sec : data ] ) does not influence our main conclusion , by presenting the mass  size relation of our full sample of early - type galaxies ( 79,184 early - type galaxies , including those that were excluded in the mass  size relation using nonparametric size measurements due to close neighbors ) based on effective radii and stellar masses derived by the model fit from s11 and m14 catalogs .",
    "the mass  size relations based on the de vaucouleurs + exponential profile fit is shown in the left panel of figure [ ms_simard ] , while that based on the srsic + exponential profile fit is shown in the right panel of figure [ ms_simard ] . where the magnitudes and color values are from the srsic + exponential profile fit .",
    "] in these two cases , there is also environmental dependence ( @xmath343@xmath105 dex ) of the mass  size relation for the massive galaxies of @xmath335 .",
    "we also found that slopes of the mass  size relations in the low mass range of @xmath150 are similar to what we found in section [ sec : ms ] with 0.563 for the de vaucouleurs + exponential profile fit and 0.634 for the srsic + exponential profile fit .",
    "we provide the mass  size relations of early - type galaxies when the environments are measured by @xmath88-band luminosity density within the 10th nearest objects in figure [ ms_lumden ] and within 1 mpc in figure [ ms_lumden_ap ] .",
    "the unit of luminosity density @xmath344 is @xmath345 . in these figures , we divided galaxies into five environments so that each environment bin has a similar number of galaxies to that of each environment in figure [ ms_1fig ] .",
    "use of the luminosity density reaches essentially the same result .",
    "we also provide the mass  size relation of early - type galaxies when half - light semimajor axes are used in figure [ ms_sma ] .",
    "the half - light semimajor axes were calculated by dividing the half - light radii derived in section [ sec : radius ] by square root values of the seeing - corrected axis ratios from sdss dr7 .",
    "this is because our nonparametric method is not ideal for deriving the half - light semimajor axis , particularly for small galaxies , because the axis ratio of the elliptical aperture is affected by seeing , unlike a circular aperture .",
    "use of a half - light semimajor axis increases the sizes of the early - type galaxies , but it does not affect the environmental dependence we find in the massive end . on the other hand , we find a weak environmental dependence in an opposite way at low - mass galaxies .",
    "the amount of the dependence is small ( @xmath346 0.03 dex ) and comparable to the bias in size measurements in crowded environments , so it is not easy to judge whether this trend is real .",
    "it is worthwhile to examine this reverse environmental dependence further in a future work .",
    "we also examined whether the environmental dependence is driven by a difference in the stellar mass distribution between different environments at a given mass bin , since stellar mass is coupled with environment in a sense that massive galaxies preferentially inhabit dense environments .",
    "thus , for a given stellar mass bin , the stellar mass distribution of high - density environments could be skewed more toward massive galaxies in comparison to that of low - density environments .",
    "the different mass distribution in a mass bin between different environments can possibly bias the environmental dependence of the mass  size relation . to test this hypothesis , we constructed the mass - matched sample as follows : for each stellar mass bin in the high density environments ( @xmath99 and @xmath100 ) , we created a randomly selected sample whose mass distribution is the same as that of the counterpart in the lowest - density environments in that mass range ( we repeated this random sampling 10,000 times for robustness ) .",
    "this was done from @xmath347 to the most massive bin where the environmental dependence exists .",
    "then we examined how much the sizes of the galaxies in the high - density environments change and how much weaker the environmental dependence becomes .",
    "when the mass - matched sample described above is used , the median sizes of the galaxies in the high - density environments become on average @xmath348 dex ( median difference of @xmath349 dex ) smaller than before , with a standard deviation of @xmath350 dex .",
    "this small change is negligible when examining the environmental dependence , which is of the order of 0.1 dex .",
    "we repeated the same test in reverse : for each stellar mass bin in the low - density environments ( @xmath116 and @xmath97 ) , we created a randomly selected sample whose mass distribution is the same as that of the counterpart in the highest - density environments . in this case , the median sizes of the galaxies in the low - density environments become on average @xmath351 dex ( median difference of @xmath351 dex ) larger than before , with a standard deviation of @xmath351 dex .",
    "again , the change is very negligible .",
    "these tiny variations are smaller than typical errors ( @xmath352  @xmath353 dex ) of the median sizes of each bin at @xmath14 and do not change environmental dependence significantly .",
    "therefore , we conclude that the environmental dependence of the mass  size relation we found is driven by a difference in the mass  size relation , not by a simple difference of mass distribution in a mass bin between different environments .",
    "we show the mass  size relation of the mass - matched sample in figure [ msmatched_fig ] . in this figure",
    ", we matched the mass distribution of each mass bin with that of the counterpart in the environment of @xmath99 .",
    "the use of the mass - matched sample does not change our result .",
    "this is related to the very small difference of the average mass between each stellar mass bin in high density and low density in the same mass range , which is measured to be smaller than @xmath145 dex , as shown in figure [ massdiff_fig ] .",
    "this small mass difference corresponds to a size difference smaller than @xmath145 dex by equations [ eq4 ] and [ eq5 ] .",
