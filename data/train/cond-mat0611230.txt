    "<S> motivated by the recent realization of a @xmath0cr bose - einstein condensate , we consider the phase diagram of a general spin - three condensate as a function of its scattering lengths . </S>",
    "<S> we classify each phase according to its reciprocal spinor , using a method developed in a previous work . </S>",
    "<S> we show that such a classification can be naturally extended to describe the vortices for a spinor condensate by using the topological theory of defects . </S>",
    "<S> to illustrate , we systematically describe the types of vortex excitations for each phase of the spin - three condensate .    over the past few years </S>",
    "<S> , there has been remarkable experimental progress in the study of spinor bose - einstein condensates @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> one of the most intriguing examples is the recent realization of a @xmath0cr @xcite condensate which has since received substantial theoretical attention @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> atomic chromium has six electrons in its outermost shell which combine into a state with maximal spin @xmath1 according to hund s rules . </S>",
    "<S> these electrons also give rise to a magnetic dipole moment which is much larger than that of the alkalis where dipolar effects are typically unimportant . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , such dipolar effects have been observed in the expansion profiles of @xmath0cr @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> dipolar effects are important for magnetic traps where the spin degrees are frozen out . however , when purely optical traps are used it has been argued that the spin exchange interaction will overwhelm the dipolar interaction @xcite . due to such spin interactions , a dilute gas of spin </S>",
    "<S> three bosons will interact according to the pair potential @xmath2 where @xmath3 projects into the state with total spin @xmath4 and @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the scattering length corresponding to spin @xmath4 . for the spin - three problem , </S>",
    "<S> this potential gives rise to a phase diagram ( as a function of the possible values of the scattering lengths ) of great richness as was revealed in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in addition to having such rich phase diagrams , spinor condenstates in general and the @xmath0cr condensate in particular will have intriguing topological excitations . </S>",
    "<S> topological excitations for spin - one , spin three - halves , and spin - two condenstates have received considerable attention in the literature @xcite since the pioneering work of ho @xcite and ohmi and machida @xcite . also , recently topological spin textures have been observed in @xmath7rb atoms in the spin - one hyperfine state @xcite .    in a previous publication @xcite , we have developed a way of classifying spinor bec and mott insulating states and illustrated the method with an application to the spin - two boson problem . </S>",
    "<S> more specifically , we showed that it is natural to identify a spin @xmath4 state @xmath8 with @xmath9 points on the unit sphere @xmath10 . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , there is a one - to - one correspondence between a spinor and a `` reciprocal spinor '' up to phase and normalization @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the stereographic image on the complex plane of the point @xmath10 on the unit sphere . </S>",
    "<S> the set of such complex numbers @xmath13 are explicitly constructed by finding the coherent states @xmath14 which are orthogonal to the spinor states @xmath15 . </S>",
    "<S> the characteristic equation @xmath16 will then be a polynomial in @xmath17 of order @xmath9 and its @xmath9 roots projected on the sphere will immediately give the symmetries of the spinor . </S>",
    "<S> spin rotations which leave this set of points invariant will take a spinor @xmath18 into itself modulo an overall phase which can be computed through geometrical considerations . </S>",
    "<S> thus this method gives a complete description of the spinor state .    in this work , we show that such a method is also useful for classifying the spinor vortices . to illustrate , we focus on the spin - three problem , motivated by the recent experimental development @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we first reproduce the phase diagrams for spin - three condensates obtained previously in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> then we find the symmetries of each phase ( see fig .  [ </S>",
    "<S> fig : shapes ] ) by applying the method developed in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we then systematically describe the types of topological excitations for such a system using the topological theory of defects @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> such a scheme enumerates all possible types of vortex excitations , though it does not determine which are energetically stable against dividing into multiple vortices . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we will briefly discuss the resulting microscopic wave functions for the vortex excitations . </S>",
    "<S> such understanding of vortices will be relevant for rotating @xmath0cr condensates in optical traps . </S>",
    "<S> in general , the topological vortex excitations ( line defects ) of an ordered medium are given by the first homotopy group @xmath19 ( the group of closed loops ) of the order parameter space @xmath20 . </S>",
    "<S> more specifically , the conjugacy classes of @xmath21 correespond to the vortex types . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the way such vortices combine is determined by the multiplication table of the conjugacy classes . for a pedagogical review of the topological theory of defects , </S>",
    "<S> see @xcite ( whose notation we will adopt ) . a theorem from algebraic topology ( see e.g. @xcite ) which is used as a reliable tool for computing the first homotopy group </S>",
    "<S> is the following . </S>",
    "<S> let @xmath22 be a simply connected group and @xmath23 be a subgroup of @xmath22 . </S>",
    "<S> then @xmath24 where @xmath25 are the elements of @xmath23 which are connected to the identity by continuous transformations . to apply this theorem to our system , we need to take @xmath22 to be a group of operators that act transitively on the spin groundstates and @xmath23 to be the subgroup of @xmath22 which leave the particular spinor state we are considering invariant </S>",
    "<S> . then @xmath20 has the same topology as @xmath26 , so the theorem applies . </S>",
    "<S> the first guess would be to use elements like @xmath27 ( where @xmath28 is the spin - three matrix and @xmath29 is a unit vector ) which act directly on the spinor states and superfluid phase . </S>",
    "<S> however , these elements form a representation of @xmath30 , which is not simply connected , so eq .  ( [ theorem ] ) will not apply . </S>",
    "<S> thus we need instead to take the simply connected group @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the group of translations in 1d with elements satisfying the property @xmath33 ( which will be simply connected ) . </S>",
    "<S> this is the covering group of @xmath34 . in this work </S>",
    "<S> we will use the representation of @xmath35 by pauli matrices , thus we describe its elements in the form @xmath36 . </S>",
    "<S> we then use the homomorphism @xmath37 given by @xmath38 which `` lifts '' our group acting directly on the spinor states into the larger simply connected group , @xmath22 . the subgroup @xmath39 will be the collection of elements @xmath40 which leave the particular spinor under consideration invariant . </S>",
    "<S> once @xmath23 is constructed by such a method , eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ theorem ] ) can then be directly applied to construct the first homotopy group .    as we will see , the majority of the phases in the spin - three phase diagram have only discrete symmetries . </S>",
    "<S> for such states , @xmath25 is the trivial group containing one element . </S>",
    "<S> for this situation , our computational theorem reduces to @xmath41 therefore , constructing @xmath42 for such states becomes straightforward : one first finds the rotations in @xmath43 which leave invariant the points on the unit sphere @xmath44 given by our classification scheme @xcite . for this purpose , it is helpful to note the possible finite subgroups of @xmath43 . </S>",
    "<S> they are the cyclic groups @xmath45 , the dihedral groups @xmath46 , the tetrahedral group @xmath32 , the octahedral group @xmath47 , and the icosahedral group @xmath48 ( see table  [ table ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> one then lifts this subgroup of @xmath43 into the twice - as - large group @xmath35 . </S>",
    "<S> on top of this `` spinor scaffolding '' one can impose a superfluid winding @xmath49 , but the allowed values of @xmath49 are related to the spin rotation chosen . </S>",
    "<S> the winding is given in the form @xmath50 where the integer @xmath51 is arbitrary . </S>",
    "<S> the offset @xmath52 is fixed and can be determined geometrically through the relation @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the angle of rotation , @xmath55 is the multiplicity of the spin - root on the axis of rotation , and @xmath4 is the total spin ( see appendix for proof ) . </S>",
    "<S> this information on the superfluid phase determines the translation group elements @xmath56 . </S>",
    "<S> this provides a direct way of constructing @xmath23 and therefore classifying the possible vortices which we illustrate below for the spin - three problem . </S>",
    "<S> now we move on to discuss the possible phases of the spin - three condensate in the absence of an external magnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> the interaction hamiltonian determined by the pair potential eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ pair - potential ] ) is given by @xmath57 where @xmath58 creates a zero - momentum boson in the spin @xmath59 state , @xmath60 are clebsch - gordan coefficients , and the sums over the greek indices are implicit . note that this interaction energy alone is sufficient to determine the spinor ground state since the rest of the hamiltonian will not have a spinor preference . using the variational state @xmath61 , where the coefficients are normalized @xmath62 the interaction energy to leading order in @xmath63 </S>",
    "<S> can be found by replacing @xmath64 by the scalar @xmath65 giving the interaction energy of @xmath66 where @xmath67 we numerically minimize this energy as a function of the seven complex variational parameters @xmath18 under the constraint of normalization @xmath62 for all possible values of the scattering lengths , and reproduce the phase diagram given in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we give explicit forms of the wave functions up to @xmath43 rotation which are summarized in table  [ table ] where , for comparison , we use the same notation as was used in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a subtle difference is that we find the additional state hh which is degenerate with the phase h reported in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it is important to note that the unspecified angles @xmath68 and @xmath69 will take unique values for particular regions in the phase diagram . </S>",
    "<S> that is , there is no mean - field degeneracy as was reported for the spin - two case @xcite .    [ </S>",
    "<S> cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     . </S>",
    "<S> the small white spheres are put at the origin as a visual aid . </S>",
    "<S> points which correspond to degenerate roots are marked.,width=336 ]    we now apply the classification scheme developed in @xcite to give the symmetries of the possible spinor condensates , and the results are given in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : shapes ] . </S>",
    "<S> shown are reciprocal spin - three spinors which are six points on the unit sphere which make the symmetries explicit . </S>",
    "<S> all of the phases except for f and ff have no continuous symmetries . as was explained in @xcite , all of the scattering lengths for @xmath0cr </S>",
    "<S> are known except @xmath70 . </S>",
    "<S> this gives a line in parameter space of possible ground states for such a condensate where the phases a , b , and c are the candidate ground states of the @xmath0cr condensate . </S>",
    "<S> we will now discuss the topological excitations of each phase . </S>",
    "<S> for each case we will take @xmath71 which will act on the spinor states via the homomorphism @xmath72 . </S>",
    "<S> the goal is to find the isotropy group @xmath23 which leaves the particular spinor state under consideration invariant . </S>",
    "<S> we start with the two states having continuous symmetries , namely f and ff . for state ff , taking the state to be oriented along the @xmath73-axis , we find that the only operators leaving the spin state invariant are @xmath74 with @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> note that the phase factor @xmath75 is necessary to cancel the phase from rotation . immediately </S>",
    "<S> , we find that this gives the isotropy group @xmath76 the first homotopy group is then computed to be @xmath77 consistent with that in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> carrying through the similar analysis for state f , we find @xmath78 . </S>",
    "<S> note that since these groups are abelian , the conjugacy classes are the original group elements giving . </S>",
    "<S> the number of conjugacy classes for these cases are @xmath79 ( ff ) and @xmath80 ( f ) . </S>",
    "<S> the number of possible types of vortex excitations is smaller by one here since the identity corresponds to the absence of a vortex . as noted </S>",
    "<S> before , this is quite a nontrivial result . </S>",
    "<S> this is in contrast to the spinless case where there are infinitely many types of vortices corresponding to different windings in the superfluid phase as the vortex is circled ( with @xmath81 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the underlying reason for this is that rotating such a spinor along its symmetry axis is identical to changing the superfluid phase .    </S>",
    "<S> we now move on to consider the remaining phases which have only discrete symmetries . </S>",
    "<S> for these situations , as mentioned before , @xmath25 is the trivial group , so we can apply eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ theorem_discrete ] ) directly . </S>",
    "<S> we will start with the phases having the smallest isotropy groups , namely phases c and g. for phase g , with the spinor wave function written as in table  [ table ] , the only symmetry is a rotation by @xmath82 about the @xmath73-axis . such an operation will not change the phase of the spinor , i.e. @xmath83 . </S>",
    "<S> we then find for the isotropy group @xmath84 where @xmath85 is the @xmath86 identity matrix and we note that @xmath87 . </S>",
    "<S> this group is abelian , so the conjugacy classes are just the group elements themselves . </S>",
    "<S> note that the translational part of @xmath23 merely tells us that an arbitrary winding in the superfluid phase can be imposed on any vortex state . </S>",
    "<S> _ in the following , we will suppress the translational part of @xmath23 _ , keeping this in mind . </S>",
    "<S> the phase c will have a similar isotropy group , but we note here that rotation by @xmath82 about the symmetry axis will give a phase of @xmath88 .    </S>",
    "<S> phases e , h , and hh have @xmath89-fold rotational symmetries about a particular axis . </S>",
    "<S> phases e and hh have a three - fold rotational symmetry about their symmetry axes , and the first homotopy group is found to be @xmath90 on the other hand , phase h has a five - fold rotational symmetry , and its first homotopy group is similarly @xmath91 as before , these groups are abelian </S>",
    "<S> . therefore , the types of possible vortices will correspond to rotating the polyhedra about the axes of symmetries @xmath89 times as the vortex is circled . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , the phase winds by @xmath92 where @xmath51 is an arbitrary integer and @xmath93 for the phases e , h , and hh respectively .    </S>",
    "<S> phase b is the first phase we encounter that has a nonabelian isotropy group . </S>",
    "<S> this phase has a rotational symmetry of @xmath82 about the @xmath73-axis . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , it also has the symmetry of a rotation about two axes in the @xmath94 plane , namely @xmath95 . </S>",
    "<S> the isotropy group for this is @xmath96 since this group is nonabelian , the conjugacy classes are not just the original group . </S>",
    "<S> this group is isomorphic to the quaternion group having eight elements . </S>",
    "<S> the conjugacy classes corresponding to each possible type of vortex excitation are : @xmath97    phases a and d have larger isotropy groups ; we will not write out explicit representations here , but will merely state the results . for phase a which has the symmetry of the hexagon as seen in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : shapes ] there is a six - fold rotational symmetry about the @xmath73-axis . </S>",
    "<S> in addition to this there are six axes in the @xmath94 plane for which there will be a two - fold rotational symmetry . </S>",
    "<S> this will make @xmath98 have @xmath99 elements , which will have @xmath100 conjugacy classes . </S>",
    "<S> phase d has the symmetry of the octahedron . for this </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath101 will have @xmath102 elements and @xmath103 conjugacy classes . </S>",
    "<S> all of these results are summarized in table  [ table ] . </S>",
    "<S> now that the classification scheme for vortices based on homotopy theory has been completed , we will briefly consider the resulting microscopic wave functions . </S>",
    "<S> we can express the order parameter explicitly in terms of the spinor as @xmath104 and write @xmath105 . </S>",
    "<S> note that the amplitude of @xmath106 is taken to have constant magnitude which is realistic provided we are sufficiently far from the vortex core . </S>",
    "<S> for @xmath107 it will prove useful to use the spinor - ket notation and write @xmath108 where @xmath109 is the reference state which can be taken as one of the spinors given in table  [ table ] . </S>",
    "<S> in this equation , @xmath110 is the axis about which the spinor is rotated as the vortex is circled and @xmath111 give the spatial dependence of the superfluid phase and spinor rotation around the vortex . </S>",
    "<S> these functions must satisfy the requirement that the original wave function must be recovered after the vortex is completely circled . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , suppose the spinor state under consideration is invarient under a rotation by angle @xmath54 . </S>",
    "<S> then a vortex at the origin corresponding to this symmetry is given by @xmath112 and @xmath113 where @xmath72 is the azimuthal angle , @xmath51 is the winding number , and @xmath52 is given by eq .  </S>",
