    "the gamma - ray photon energy is 1808.65  ( @xmath50.07 )  kev in the laboratory frame .",
    "such gamma - rays penetrate interstellar matter easily and reach gamma - ray telescopes even from within dense molecular clouds .",
    "their densities are @xmath610@xmath7 g  @xmath8 , the line - of - sight mass column reaches @xmath9  g  @xmath10 .",
    "therefore interstellar clouds occult sources at almost all other frequencies of the electromagnetic spectrum ; only stellar envelopes reach column densities above a few g@xmath10 , the optical depth for such gamma - rays , so that radioactivities inside stars and the early supernova and nova phases remain hidden from direct observations .",
    "all - sky mapping of @xmath0al  gamma - rays with the comptel imaging telescope ( see fig . [ fig_almap ] ) @xcite has convincingly shown that the @xmath0al  sky reflects recent nucleosynthesis over the entire galaxy , rather than peculiar interstellar @xmath0al  in the solar vicinity ; the latter had been suggested from @xmath0al  enrichments of the early solar system as inferred from meteorites .",
    "presolar grains in meteorites have shown in recent years that all candidate sources of @xmath0al  ( novae , agb stars , wolf - rayet stars , and core - collapse supernovae ) indeed produce @xmath0al  @xcite . yet , we consider plausible that massive stars dominate the galactic @xmath0al  budget @xcite .",
    "this arises from the non - homogeneous 1809  kev emission along the plane of the galaxy @xcite reminiscent of massive - star tracers , and from consistency of massive - star @xmath0al  sources with dust heating and interstellar - medium ionization @xcite .",
    "probably agb stars and novae are minor contributors , unless only a subset of them are important , which would spatially coincide with massive star regions .",
    "a plausible value appears to be 4@xmath51  10@xmath11ph  @xmath10s@xmath2 ( dotted ) . ]",
    "a number of experiments have measured cosmic @xmath0al  gamma - rays .",
    "as the spatial resolutions of instruments vary between allsky except earth s shadow ( rhessi , @xmath12230@xmath13 ) , @xmath12180@xmath13 ( smm ) , and @xmath123 - 4@xmath13 ( spi / integral , comptel ) , flux values can be compared only for large regions such as the bright ridge ( fig.[fig_almap ] ) of the inner galaxy ( defined as the inner radian , @xmath1430@xmath13 ; the latitude integration range is less critical , @xmath1415@xmath13 see fig.[fig_almap ] ) .",
    "fig.[fig_alflux ] summarizes the flux values which have been derived for this region from 9 experiments , 5 of them with reported significant detections .",
    "the discrepancies among experiments may indicate instrumental systematics , but partly also may be due to instrument field - of - view differences ( see e.g. @xcite ) and the definition of background references .",
    "therefore , from this integrated flux of @xmath124@xmath51  10@xmath11ph  @xmath10s@xmath2 only weak constraints on the sources of @xmath0al  can be derived when integrated yields per type of source from models are compared to this value .",
    "interpretations depend on the spatial distribution in the galaxy , from models smoothly following interstellar gas as represented by exponential disks with typical scales r@xmath123.5  kpc and z@xmath120.1  kpc @xcite , to irregular models due to spiral structure and peculiar , active regions such as cygnus ( see fig .",
    "[ fig_almap ] and @xcite ) . from comptel ,",
    "a total galactic mass of @xmath122@xmath51  m@xmath15 has been estimated @xcite .",
    "all candidate sources all have been reported to be able to produce such amounts @xcite .",
    "but yields for agb stars are probably most uncertain ( 0.014  m@xmath16 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and nova yields in current models are 0.10.4  m@xmath16@xcite and would reach the observed total only under extreme mixing assumptions or if scaled with the ejected - mass ratios between models and nova observations to obtain such high values ; therefore these two candidate - source arguments are somewhat controversial . for massive stars in their wolf - rayet and core - collapse supernova stages , much detailed modeling is available , and both are compatible with these inferred 2  m@xmath15 of @xmath0al   in the galaxy ( though on the low side ) @xcite .    other arguments can be derived from a comparison of the @xmath0al  map with tracers of the candidate sources . from comparisons of heated - dust distribution , free - electron distribution , and",
    "h@xmath17 maps , an @xmath0al  origin in massive stars has been found most plausible @xcite .",
    "in particular , the ionizing power and @xmath0al  yields from massive stars have been shown to be consistent : the galactocentric gradient for supernova and wolf - rayet star space densities predicts an @xmath0al  yield profile as a result of different metalicity dependencies for these source types @xcite , which matches the @xmath0al  map profile more closely for a wolf - rayet origin @xcite ; furthermore , the presence of significant @xmath0al  in the young cygnus massive - star region with probably - low supernova history suggests that the wolf - rayet phase of massive stars dominates over the contribution from core collapses @xcite .",
    "but , detailed proof is not available yet .",
    "convincing arguments could be derived from better estimates of the distances and locations of candidate sources .",
    "this can be achieved in localized source regions such as cygnus , vela , and orion ( see contributions by kndlseder et al . , and schanne et al .",
    ", these proceedings , and @xcite ) ; population - synthesis modeling of the @xmath0al  content in the region can be compared to the gamma - ray measurements , to check for consistency of the age of the stellar population with nucleosynthesis models ( see * ? ? ?",

    "the measurements of the @xmath0al  gamma - ray line profile with experiments featuring high - resolution spectroscopy ( see fig.[fig_alwidth ] ) are somewhat controversial .",
    "the gris balloon - borne experiment had obtained a significantly - broadened line , corresponding to interstellar velocities of decaying @xmath0al  nuclei of 540  km  s@xmath2 @xcite ; this had been difficult to understand , unless large ( kpc - sized ) cavities in the interstellar medium or dust grains would hold the bulk of @xmath0al   ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "all satellite - based ge detector experiments report @xmath0al  line widths consistent with instrumental resolutions or only slightly broadened @xcite ( see fig . [ fig_alwidth ] ) ; this suggests some unknown systematic distortion of the gris measurement .",
    "still , gamma - ray spectroscopy in space at the 0.1  kev level is an experimental challenge ; careful assessments of instrumental response and background are essential .",
    "the spi spectrometer on integral features a 19-element ge detector camera embedded in a massive shield of bgo detectors , with imaging capability due to a tungsten coded - mask mounted in the telescope aperture @xcite . at 1809 kev ,",

    "spectral resolution varies over time , due to cosmic - ray irradiation of the detectors which degrades the charge collection efficiency ; this is rectified periodically through detector annealing procedures , restoring the quoted resolution @xcite .",

    "al  line is dominated by continuum . but a feature from several blended lines at 1810 kev , although much weaker than adjacent background lines from al and bi activation at 1779 and 1764 kev , respectively , complicates spectroscopy of the @xmath0al  line . ]",

    "the spi sensitivity is constrained by the underlying instrumental background . in the vicinity of the @xmath0al  line ( see fig .",

    "but other nuclear lines may contribute : in particular , there is a strong hint for another , yet unidentified line , at 1805.5 kev ( see fig .",
    "[ fig_alresspec ] ) .",
    "the total event rate in the instrumental feature is 2  10@xmath2  hz , which compares to an expected celestial @xmath0al  event rate of a few  10@xmath23  hz at 1808.6 kev from diffuse emission in the inner galaxy .",
    "from the first part of the inner - galaxy deep exposure ( gcde ) , the detection of the 1809 kev gamma - ray line from @xmath0al  could be reported ( * ? ? ? *  ms of exposure selected as useful at the time ) .",
    "considerable uncertainties had to be faced , since underlying background is large and variable .",
    "different approaches to spectral analysis and background treatment are essential at this early stage of the mission to get estimates of systematic uncertainties and the overall consistency of results , because the coded - mask encoding of the signal is rather weak for diffuse emission .",
    "the @xmath0al  sky intensity from the inner @xmath530@xmath24 of the galaxy was derived as ( 35)@xmath25  ph  @xmath10s@xmath2 , the line width was found consistent with spi s instrumental resolution of 3  kev ( fwhm ) .",
    "figure [ fig_spec_obsfit_gcde1 ] shows a spectrum obtained from these data through one of the analysis approaches discussed in @xcite .",
    "an offset by @xmath26 0.3  kev in line energy was attributed to the preliminary energy calibration .    in the meantime",
    ", the exposure of the inner galaxy has been more than doubled , and data corruption during processing have been minimized , so that an effective exposure ( live time ) of 3.6  ms is obtained ( see fig .",
    "[ fig_exposure_gcde12 ] ) .",
    "additionally , the energy calibrations have been improved @xcite , and the background behavior has been studied in much more detail ; several approaches to model the instrumental lines and continuum are being employed and refined @xcite . we usefully exploit the performance record of spi over mission time for energy calibration ; in addition , background modeling benefits from such continuous data , and in particular from exposures off the plane of the galaxy which are presumably free of celestial @xmath0al  signal .",
    "( for the earlier analysis , only off - source data from crab and lmc exposures could be used , because of several changes of operational mode in the early part of the mission . ) with now @xmath12 4  ms of galactic plane exposure from the integral core program ( fig .",
    "[ fig_exposure_gcde12 ] ) , and more than 2  ms of additional performance data at other times , the background history can be traced much more accurately .            for an adequate model of background in the ge detector spectra ,",
    "we use adjacent energies to force an absence of celestial signal outside the @xmath0al  line ; in the @xmath0al  line region , we adopt the spectral signature of background from off - source measurements .",
    "as one approach , we scale this template at fine time resolution to model line background intensity variations from saturated event counts in the ge detectors as a tracer of activation , and account for radioactive build - up where lines are identified with an isotope ( see * ? ?",

    ", we may not only impose constraints on characteristics expected for background , but also on the shadow pattern cast by celestial photons as they illuminate the ge camera through the coded mask ; else the discrimination of the celestial component against the background component will be blurred .",
    "we implement this through an assumption on the intensity distribution in the sky , and fit the scaling factor of this sky model per each spectral bin , producing as result a spectrum of celestial intensity .",
    "software tools _ spidiffit _ and _ spi_obs_fit _ are used for this analysis ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "these efforts improve the sensitivity to the celestial signature substantially , beyond on / off methods . in fig .",
    "[ fig_spec_obsfit ] we illustrate how additional data and better calibrations and background treatment improve spectra for the inner galaxy ; the analysis approach shown here is closest to the one which produced the result shown in fig.[fig_spec_obsfit_gcde1 ] .",
    "the distribution of @xmath0al  emission is modeled here by the emission of dust as observed by cobe / dirbe at 240  @xmath27 m , background is modeled from adjacent energy bands adjacent to the line ( 1786 - 1802 and 1815 - 1828 kev ) , plus a line complex template extracted from off - source observations of the lmc ( fig .",

    "again , variations of sky models do not affect results , but background models have a significant impact .",
    "biases are possible which suppress galactic @xmath0al  or which still retain a contribution from the structured instrumental background .",
    "therefore , quantitative results for the galactic large - scale @xmath0al  emission significantly beyond our earlier paper @xcite , in particular intensity and gamma - ray line shape details , will have to await sufficiently deep understanding of the biases of each of our analysis approaches , through simulations and through tests on other source cases .",

    "the massive - star source distribution is shown as histogram . ]",
    "further sophistication of such analysis would be the generation of @xmath0al  sky intensity distributions on the sky .",
    "this becomes feasible , once the celestial signal is sufficiently significant so that it can be broken down into different `` pixels '' on the sky .",
    "first steps towards this have been taken by splitting the sky intensity models for different quadrants of the galaxy , and by the iterative imaging methods adapted from comptel analyses @xcite .",
    "publication agreements within integral s science working team have led to a split of studies of different galactic quadrants , pursued by different subgroups .",
    "these spatially - resolved @xmath0al  results will thus be published elsewhere .",
    "most sensitive large - scale spatially - resolved studies require one to exploit all pointings along the galactic plane , and model background accurately around all these observing times .",
    "once this will be achieved , the doppler motion of source regions at different locations within the galaxy is expected to leave a characteristic imprint on the @xmath0al  gamma - ray line shape .",

    "it has been shown that the ionization from massive stars produces a spatial distribution reminiscent of observed @xmath0al  gamma rays .",
    "the ionization power and the @xmath0al  yields from the population of massive stars throughout the galaxy make up a consistent description of massive - star origin for @xmath0al  @xcite .",
    "if sufficiently large regions on the sky with doppler motions in opposite directions are integrated and compared against each other , a displacement of the line centroids as large as 0.5  kev should result . with spi s energy resolution of 3  kev",
    ", this will be significant for a statistical accuracy corresponding to 3  ms of exposure throughout these regions of the galactic plane , assuming that systematic uncertainties are negligible in comparison ( see fig .",
    "[ fig_lineshape_ew ] ) .",
    "this appears achievable over the duration of the integral mission , yet presents a significant challenge for data analysis in the light of current uncertainties .",
    "the galactic emission from @xmath0al  provides unique insight into the massive star population of the galaxy and its interaction with the interstellar medium .",
    "several experiments have set the stage for addressing the related astrophysical questions with integral s spectrometer : the galaxy - wide flux measurement still lacks the precision required for source type discrimination .",
    "local intensity measurements such as in the cygnus region will be a valuable complement to this study , because in this case source populations are better constrained than in the inner galaxy ( see * ? ? ?",
    "fine spectroscopy promises to become a diagnostic , both for source distributions within the galaxy ( through galactic rotation ) , and for ejection dynamics and the interstellar medium surrounding the sources in localized regions .",
    "spi measurements of the first 1.5 years have demonstrated that integral has the potential to provide answers within the time frame of its mission .",
    "spi has been completed under the responsibility and leadership of cnes .",
