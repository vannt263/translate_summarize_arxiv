    "even the simplest model of a quantum two - level system ( tls ) , the ohmic spin - boson model , already shows nontrivial features , such as , e.g. , a quantum phase transition of localization due to strong damping @xcite .",

    "recently , a novel numerical approach has been put forward @xcite , which uses a sparse polynomial representation of the basis of the system - bath hilbert space and which allows to obtain numerical results based on exact diagonalization .",

    "the dynamics is notoriously difficult to determine , since strong non - markovian effects even for relatively weak coupling arise .    in this work ,",
    "we show that a sub - ohmic heat bath generates an effective dynamical asymmetry for an intrinsically symmetric quantum tls ( spin@xmath0 ) , which leads to a _ transient shifted quasiequilibrium _ for the tls , which then itself decays extremely slowly .",
    "this transient symmetry breaking occurs in the delocalized phase of the tls , which follows the slowly changing quasiequilibrium .",
    "moreover , it depends on the precise form of the initial condition and only occurs for the case when the spin@xmath0 is initially shifted and the bath is initially thermalized to the shifted spin .",
    "we establish a simple qualitative picture based on a perturbative analysis in terms of an asymmetric spin - boson system in order to interpret the dynamics of the spin polarization at short times .",
    "there , the dynamical asymmetry shows an initial fast exponential decay towards a quasiequilibrium with a finite quasistatic asymmetry .",
    "since the system is globally symmetric , a subsequent decay towards global thermal symmetric equilibrium follows in which the dynamical asymmetry vanishes as expected , as long as the system is in the delocalized phase . our numerical data allow us to conclude that the time scale of this final decay is much larger than any simple time scale , such as given by the inverse spin splitting @xmath15 , the inverse temperature @xmath16 or the inverse cut - off frequency @xmath17 of the bath .",
    "moreover , we find that it is much larger than the observed decoherence time @xmath18 .",
    "the asymptotic regime can not be described anymore in terms of a simple perturbative picture .",
    "the feature of the ultraslow relaxation dynamics together with the fast initial decay towards a quasiequilibrium resembles qualitatively the dynamical response of coarsening or a spinglass - like dynamics @xcite to some extent .",
    "we should , however , emphasize that the numerical scheme is limited to time ranges which are too short to study the full asymptotic nature of the ultraslow decay , apart from stating its existence and some central features , such as its dependence on the model parameters .",
    "a full study of quantum critical features lies beyond the scope the approach . in general",
    ", the ultraslowly decaying transient asymmetry is shown to be more pronounced for stronger system - bath coupling and smaller exponents @xmath19 , which clearly illustrates the quantum many - body nature of the dynamical asymmetry .",
    "in addition to this , we find _ coherent oscillations _ in the nonequilibrium polarization of the tls in the _ localized _ phase where in equilibrium all coherence is suppressed .",
    "these findings allow us to sketch the zero - temperature phase diagram with four distinct phases .",
    "we argue that our results may have immediate experimental implications , since the slow transient asymmetry will dominate all spin fluctuations and thus the true equilibrium spin fluctuations , which are relevant for quantum critical behavior and which require asymptotically long times , may be difficult to access experimentally . in turn , the slow dynamical asymmetry should also be taken into account by quantum engineering of nanodevices .    to structure the paper ,",
    "we introduce the model in the next section and then discuss briefly the necessary technical modifications of the numerical exact quasi adiabatic propagator path - integral to tackle the spin dynamics with factorized and shifted or polarized bath initial conditions . in section [ sec.decay ] , we develop our simple qualitative picture which quantitatively describes the formation of the dynamically generated asymmetry for the spin at intermediate times . in sec .",

    "we are numerically restricted to finite times and can not investigate the localization quantum phase transition , but rather the dynamic crossover between oscillatory and overdamped dynamics .",

    "the dynamics of the sub - ohmic spin - boson model is rather sensitive on the way how the system and bath are initially prepared , in particular with respect to their mutual interaction .",
    "it enters the formalism when the bath degrees of freedom are averaged over . to understand this ,",
    "consider an experiment where a symmetric spin is in thermal equilibrium with the bath at temperature @xmath45 and at initial time @xmath46 , the spin density operator @xmath47 is prepared such that @xmath48 .",

    "a different case is to start preparing the spin long time before the experiment starts in order for the environment to thermalize to the _ shifted _ spin .",
    "this results in the shifted ( correlated ) initial condition @xmath54 with @xmath55 , where @xmath25 and @xmath56 .",
    "all recent studies  @xcite were based on the shifted initial condition .",
    "the coupling between the spin and a single bath mode scales with @xmath57 , with @xmath58 being the number of modes and thus is infinitely small for a continuum of modes .",
    "therefore the difference between @xmath59 and @xmath60 is small and believed to have little influence on the spin dynamics itself .",
    "this assumption is at the heart of open quantum dynamics since only an environment which is large enough to stay unaffected by a small quantum system can be averaged over without loss of crucial physics .",
    "@xcite showed that for an ohmic bath , both initial conditions lead to sizeable differences for the spin dynamics only on very short times of the order of @xmath61 .",
    "thus , the spin dynamics which lives on a time scale of @xmath62 , is unaltered as long as @xmath63 .",
    "the relevant parameter to distinguish both cases is the energy difference between the two initial conditions of the bath .",
    "it is estimated by the reorganization energy @xmath64 and is dominated by the low frequency modes . as they are weakly present in the ohmic case , their influence is negligible when @xmath65 .",
    "in contrast , for a sub - ohmic bath , any reorganization is _ slow _ , implying that the bath initial condition has a crucial influence on all time scales of the system dynamics .    in order to treat this situation properly ,",
    "we adopt the quapi scheme , which has originally been formulated for factorizing initial conditions @xcite , also to correlated initial conditions .",
    "quapi is an efficient , iterative and numerically exact method , in which the real - time quantum evolution operator is sliced into @xmath66 trotter slices of duration @xmath67 . for the factorizing initial condition ,",
    "the bath influence is captured by influence functional i_0 = \\ { -_k=0^n_k=0^k [ s_k^+-s^-_k ] } with the bath correlators @xmath68 defined in ref .   and",

    "all bath correlations decay exponentially fast at asymptotically long times @xcite , which allows for a truncation of the bath - induced memory time beyond a certain time span .",
    "this corresponds in the above sum to setting @xmath71 when @xmath72 for a given memory length @xmath73 .",

    "neglecting all correlators with @xmath72 would imply to also neglect @xmath83 at times @xmath84 and no sizeable difference for the two initial conditions would be found .",

    "[ fig1 ] shows the polarization @xmath40 for the factorizing initial condition for a symmetric spin ( @xmath41 ) for different coupling strengths for @xmath85 and @xmath42 ( @xmath86  @xcite ) .",
    "we find damped oscillations where damping grows with increasing @xmath31 .",
    "as expected from a bloch - like picture , the oscillations occur around zero average .",
    "surprisingly even in the localized phase , @xmath40 shows quantum coherent oscillations out of equilibrium . in the localized phase",
    "the bath modes are too slow to localize the out - of - equilibrium tls fast enough and thus damped coherent oscillations still occur at short times .",
    "in contrast to that , fig.[fig1 ] also shows @xmath40 for the shifted bath initial condition . as before , we find damped oscillations with a damping constant increasing with @xmath31 .",
    "however , in striking qualitative difference , the oscillations occur around a finite value @xmath87 , even for coupling strengths well in the delocalized phase , which indicates an intermittent symmetry breaking .",

    "the latter results are in line with those of ref .  .",
    "the dependence on the initial preparation , however , has not been disclosed before .",
    "in order to study the effect of the shifted oscillations more quantitatively , they can be formalized in terms of an effective time - dependent asymmetry @xmath89 for the tls which generates a finite polarization @xmath90 .",

    "nevertheless , we expect that particularly at short times , the dynamics is well described by a lowest order perturbative description in the tunneling strength , yielding an initial exponential decay also for the bath correlations .",

    "this approach will no longer hold for truly asymptotic times @xmath100 . with increasing @xmath31 , the dynamical asymmetry ( both at @xmath46 and @xmath101 ) increases , but",
    "its short time decay rate @xmath96 decreases slightly .",
    "the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] shows the extracted parameters vs.  @xmath31 and linear fits to the data .",
    "a simple qualitative picture can be obtained by assuming that the initially shifted bath modes generate this transient dynamical asymmetry .",
    "the slow modes drag the tls to its original position , similar to the cage effect in the fractional langevin equation  @xcite .",
    "this causes a non - zero effective polarization @xmath102 and a finite asymmetry both of which are clearly dynamically generated by the sub - ohmic bath correlations .",
    "in general , the symmetry breaking is enhanced with increasing coupling , emphasizing the many - body character of the asymmetry . at",
    "asymptotically long times , we expect the bath to relax slowly towards global equilibrium with the tls being in either of its two symmetric eigenstates in which @xmath103 and the asymmetry will thus slowly vanish .",
    "the decay of the initial coherent oscillations shown in fig .  [ fig1 ] occurs on a time scale of the same order as the period of the oscillation , but is very fast compared to the decay of @xmath90 which we actually can not fully observe but clearly conjecture  @xcite .",
    "this effect depends on the initial preparation of the bath and , moreover , it is absent in an ohmic bath @xcite .",
    "we note that the feature of an initial decay with a time scale of the order of a _ microscopic _ decay rate of the spin and a subsequent ultraslow decay towards a global equilibrium resembles that of coarsening or of spin glasses @xcite after a quench  @xcite .",
    "although the sub - ohmic model has no explicit spatial disorder , its low - frequency noise implicitly mimics disorder , similar to @xmath104-noise .",

    "note that we have set @xmath114 , which is strictly valid for a symmetric system @xcite and that we have ignored the additional correction term for the rate due to a finite asymmetry .",
    "all data show the initial oscillatory behavior except for @xmath111 and @xmath115 which exhibits overdamped dynamics .",
    "for @xmath42 , the asymmetry is smoothly increasing for larger @xmath31 up to the phase transition and even beyond . at the same time",
    ", the tunneling matrix element is hardly influenced and larger than the decoherence rate which increases with coupling .",
    "thus , the presence ( absence ) of oscillations is not a sufficient condition for the existence of the delocalized ( localized ) phase . for @xmath97 ,",
    "the asymmetry is generally smaller , but also increases with increasing @xmath31 . for @xmath116 , the decoherence rate exceeds the tunneling element hinting at the crossover to overdamped behavior for stronger couplings .",
    "for @xmath111 , the dynamical asymmetry is small , depends nonmonotonously on @xmath31 and vanishes for @xmath117 .",
    "the tunneling matrix element also vanishes there , indicating the crossover to overdamped dynamics .",
    "thus both the overdamped dynamics and the dynamical asymmetry are closely connected .",
    "thus , we can summarize our physical picture in the following way : in general , when the tls is fully polarized and released at @xmath46 , it starts to oscillate coherently and resonant bath modes damp the oscillations .",
    "since the slow bath modes are not yet in equilibrium with the evolving tls , but still shifted , they cause a drag for the tls to its initial state , resulting in the formation of a dynamical asymmetry .",
    "this decays to zero on an ultraslow time scale since the global equilibrium is symmetric .",
    "thus , the local quantities decay first to a _ local _ quasiequilibrium generated by the immediate environment .",
    "this oscillatory decay at short to intermediate times is well characterized by exponential decay rates @xmath118 ( see eq .",
    "( [ fit ] ) , data not shown explicitly ) and a dynamical asymmetry @xmath89 , which itself varies with time .",
    "following our simple perturbative line of reasoning , @xmath119 consists of two parts .",
    "one part , @xmath120 , decays exponentially with rate @xmath96 and quickly vanishes as time increases .",
    "the second part @xmath121 decreases only very weakly with growing time which is revealed by our numerical data , but has to vanish in the asymptotic limit @xmath122 due to global symmetry .",
    "hence , only at very large times , a global equilibrium state emerges . at stronger coupling",
    ", strong correlations between the tls and resonant modes generate an overdamped dynamics .",
    "the responsible modes are not the slow modes , thus the dragging effect is suppressed .",
    "with increasing temperature , the dynamics becomes overdamped as well .",
    "[ fig4 ] shows the ratio @xmath123 for @xmath124 .",
    "in general , it decreases with increasing @xmath45 . only for @xmath42 at @xmath125 , we observe overdamped behavior .",
    "the data shown in fig .  [ fig4 ] indicate that the crossover temperature at which the overdamped regime start increases with decreasing exponent @xmath19 ( at fixed relative coupling @xmath124 ) .",
    "the final asymmetry ( inset of fig .  [ fig4 ] ) decreases with temperature in a monotonic way , also around the crossover temperature .",
    "the findings can be summarized in a phase diagram sketched in fig.[fig5 ] ( at @xmath126 ) .",
    "the black circles mark the equilibrium localization phase transition known in the literature  @xcite ( note that the numbers refer to the values of @xmath31 along the ordinate , the scale , however , is not linear ) .",
    "the second solid line with the squares mark the dynamic crossover from coherent to overdamped dynamics  @xcite .",
    "the delocalized ( weak - coupling or symmetric ) phase is reflected in the coherent oscillations of @xmath40 , in which we have unexpectedly found a transient symmetry breaking for all @xmath127 . for @xmath128 , a dynamical crossover to the overdamped delocalized phase occurs without transient symmetry breaking , before the localized phase is reached for large @xmath31 .",
    "unexpectedly , for @xmath129 , no overdamped dynamics occurs but the nonequilibrium polarization still shows quantum coherent ( damped ) oscillations in the localized phase , where in equilibrium coherence is completely suppressed . although we could not obtain converged results for stronger couplings , we expect that the oscillatory dynamics deeper in the localized phase should vanish .",
    "the phase diagram summarizes our two major results : ( i ) in the delocalized phase where the dynamics is oscillatory , the initial preparation of the bath strongly influences the dynamics .",
    "thus , the dynamics in this phase is dominated by the ultra - slow sub - ohmic bath modes . any experiment addressing",
    "this phase will have to deal with these unusual long - time transients and true equilibrium quantities will be hard to access .",
    "accordingly , one can not expect to observe the spectrum of the equilibrium fluctuations when approaching the localization phase transition from this phase .",
    "this has to be taken into account when analyzing the data for the dynamic structure factor of heavy fermion systems within a picture of local quantum criticality .",
    "the latter assumes the local critical fluctuations to be of sub - ohmic nature .",
    "( ii ) moreover , the phase denoted as `` localized  oscillatory '' in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] is characterized by an oscillating polarization , although the spin is in the localized phase where in equilibrium any oscillation is suppressed .",
    "this phase is novel and , to the best of our knowledge , has not been revealed or discussed before .",
    "note that it is not an equilibrium phase .",
    "strictly speaking , it is just a part of the equilibrium phase denoted as `` localized '' , but from the viewpoint of the real - time dynamics , the two regions ( one with oscillatory dynamics and one without ) are distinct .",
    "it is known that for @xmath130 no oscillatory dynamics occurs for couplings stronger than the critical coupling of the crossover to overdamped dynamics .",
    "accordingly , in the localized phase ( which occurs here at even stronger couplings ) , no oscillatory dynamics is observed .",
    "we believe that even for @xmath6 , the oscillatory behavior will be suppressed at very large couplings .",
    "hence , we conjecture the dashed phase separation line between localized - oscillatory and the localized - overdamped region in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] .",
    "we note that experimental studies in this phase might observe a dynamical behavior which does not allow to distinguish it from behavior found in the delocalized phase unless the experimental time scale exceed the time scale of the ultraslow decay in the delocalized phase since in the localized phase the asymmetry will not decay at any time .",
    "although the numerical scheme does not allow to observe the ultraslow decay , we can estimate it to be at least two orders of magnitude slower than the intrinsic time scale @xmath15 of the spin as we observed finite asymmetries up to times @xmath131 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) .",
    "to summarize , we have found a distinct ultraslow transient dynamics of the polarization in the sub - ohmic spin - boson model .",
    "a dynamically correlation - induced asymmetry is generated , which mimics a local quasiequilibrium and generates a symmetry broken phase at intermediate times .",
    "it occurs due to the dominating low - frequency bath modes and only for an initially polarized thermal bath .",
    "the latter refers to the case when the system is initially prepared in a non - thermal polarized state and the bath can thermalize to that before relaxation to the global thermal equilibrium can start .",
    "technically , this kind of initial preparation can be included by adopting the numerical quasiadiabatic propagator path integral scheme .",
    "for this , an additional term in the feynman - vernon influence phase is included which only depends on the initial and the momentary observation time , but not on the times in between .",
    "hence , the general strategy of a finite memory time in quapi is not affected and this term can be taken into account in an exact manner . with that , we can show that the dynamic crossover between oscillatory and overdamped behavior is connected to the transient symmetry breaking and not to the localization quantum phase transition .    finally , we comment on an important possible consequence of our findings for identifying the quantum critical transition in heavy fermion systems  @xcite .",
    "an effective sub - ohmic spin - boson model is used for this  @xcite . at present , the non - linear scaling of the dynamic susceptibility @xmath8 with @xmath9 is used as a criterion  @xcite . however , our results suggest that the ultraslow relaxation dynamics in the sub - ohmic spin - boson model requires to carefully measure the relaxation dynamics at very long times .",
    "in fact , this could render an experimental observation of the equilibrium localization quantum phase transition difficult in general .",
    "for the same reason , the nonlinear scaling of the dynamical susceptibility has to be evaluated very carefully in order to ensure the existence of local quantum criticality in heavy fermion systems .",
