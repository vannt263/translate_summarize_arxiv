    "the variation of the total cosmic star formation rate with redshift @xmath2 @xmath3 the sfr plot @xmath3 is conventionally determined by measurements of the h@xmath4 luminosity of galaxies at @xmath5 and of uv luminosities at @xmath6 ( madau et al .",
    "1996 ) .",
    "two major complications in constructing the sfr plot at any @xmath2 are ( i ) the need to correct uv luminosities for dust extinction , and ( ii ) the need to assume a stellar imf . however , both of these seem to have been addressed with considerable success : ( i ) by adopting the corrections of calzetti ( 1997 ) , which when applied to the cfrs data of lilly et al .",
    "( 1996 ) produce a sfr plot similar to that generated from infrared _ iso _ observations ( flores et al .",
    "1999 ) , which are sensitive to the absorbed and re - radiated uv flux , and ( ii ) by using an imf that flattens below 1 m@xmath7 e.g.  that of kroupa et al .",
    "1993 , which seems to be universal ( gilmore & howell 1998 ) . the sfr plot constructed with both of these assumptions , when integrated over cosmic time , reproduces the correct local stellar density of @xmath8 that we derive from a number of methods .",
    "we can therefore have considerable confidence in current determinations of the sfr plot at @xmath9 ( somerville et al .",
    "2000 ) .    at @xmath10",
    ", there are additional , potentially more serious , complications .",
    "the only types of high-@xmath2 galaxies whose contributions to the sfr plot have been unambiguously determined are the lyman - break galaxies ( lbgs ; steidel et al .",
    "lyman-@xmath4 ( ly@xmath4 ) emitters may contribute too , but current indications are that their contribution is small ( 10@xmath11 m@xmath7 yr@xmath12 mpc@xmath13 compared to 10@xmath12 m@xmath7 yr@xmath12 mpc@xmath13 for the lbgs ; hu et al .",
    "however , these ly@xmath4-emitters and other galaxies which might exist but can not be found by the selection techniques used to find either ly - break or ly@xmath4 galaxies , could have their contributions systematically underestimated .",
    "such galaxies might be lost due to @xmath14 surface - brightness dimming ( lanzetta et al .",
    "2000 ) , or the detectability of a small fraction of the members of a population might be enhanced by supernovae that happened to go off in those members causing us to miss the bulk of the sources representing that population ( the supernovae are not dimmed by @xmath14 and can affect detectability if @xmath15 )",
    ". therefore , indirect constraints are important at such high @xmath2 .",
    "the constraint from @xmath16 is weak since the contribution to the total integral of the sfr plot is small at high @xmath2 since @xmath17 is small there .",
    "another constraint is that all the star formation at @xmath10 must produce enough metals to enrich the ly@xmath4 forest at @xmath18 ( cowie & songaila 1998 ) , but this is also of limited use here , since it is unclear what fraction of metals escape from the galaxies in which the stars form .",
    "a potentially more powerful probe is given by the @xmath0-ray burst ( grb ) formation rate plot , which must track the sfr plot closely if the majority of grbs originate from the collapse of massive stars .",
    "this is what we investigate here .",
    "grbs are detectable out to the farthest reaches of the observable universe , and provide information about processes occurring at all cosmic epochs .",
    "recent observations suggest that the long - duration grbs and their afterglows are produced by highly relativistic jets emitted in core - collapse supernova explosions .",
    "hence the redshift distributions of grbs should track the cosmic star formation rate of massive stars accurately ( lamb & reichart 2000 ; blain & natarajan 2000 ) . at present , however , there are too few redshift measurements with which to estimate the global grb formation rate .",
    "nonetheless , these few measured redshifts can be used to calibrate properties of grbs that might let them serve as standard candles .",
    "fenimore & ramirez - ruiz ( 2000 ) have suggested that the spikiness of the burst time structure is correlated with luminosity , with smooth bursts being intrinsically less luminous . in principle , the measured spikiness combined with the observed flux can be used to obtain distances much like cepheid observations give distance estimates from the pulsation period . using a sample of 220 bright",
    "bursts for which high - resolution light curves were available , fenimore & ramirez - ruiz ( 2000 ) estimated the evolution of the grb formation rate from parameters measured solely at @xmath0-ray energies .",
    "at low redshift , the grb formation rate ( bfr ) plot tracks the sfr plot in shape ( see figure 1 ) .",
    "this is the redshift regime where we have considerable confidence in the sfr plot ( see @xmath20 1 ) .",
    "this concordance suggests : ( i ) the idea that grbs do indeed track the sfr of the universe .",
    "this would imply that the formation rate of massive stars that produce grbs is proportional to the total sfr , as would follow if the imf does not vary substantially over this @xmath2 range ; ( ii ) that we can use grbs as a high-@xmath2 probe .",
    "they are not affected by extinction or surface - brightness dimming .",
    "so one might therefore expect the high-@xmath2 bfr plot to track the high-@xmath2 sfr plot .",
    "the high-@xmath2 bfr plot has a steep slope .",
    "this is different from the much flatter slope of the sfr plot as derived from lbg observations ( steidel et al .",
    "if the bfr plot does indeed track the sfr plot at high-@xmath2 ( as it does at low-@xmath2 ) , then this would suggest that much high-@xmath2 star formation is being missed in the optical surveys , even after corrections for dust extinction have been made .",
    "interestingly , lanzetta et al .",
    "( 2000 ) find evidence for a very steep sfr plot based on an analysis of high-@xmath2 galaxies in the hubble deep fields in which they consider selection effects that can arise from surface - brightness dimming .",
    "an additional source of star - formation at high-@xmath2 could come from luminous _",
    "galaxies ( blain et al .  1999 ) which could be missing from optical surveys ( e.g.  smail et al .",
    "1999 ) because they are heavily extinguished by dust .",
    "one important caveat is that the redshift range ( @xmath22 ) in which the bfr plot tracks the sfr plot is similar to the redshift range in which grbs were used to calculate the variability - luminosity relation ( there is only one event with @xmath23 3.0 ) .",
    "the application of this relation to faster variabilities and therefore higher luminosities ( as is required to derive the bfr plot at @xmath1 ) depends on an extrapolation of this relation . if the extrapolation fails , this weakens our conclusion about the steep slope of the bfr at high-@xmath2 .",
    "also , if the fraction of massive stars that produce grbs is a strong function of metallicity , then this could create a redshift - dependence of the normalization of the bfr plot relative to the sfr plot , which would also weaken the assertion that the sfr plot is steep at high-@xmath2 .",
