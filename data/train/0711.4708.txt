    "one of the early triumphs of quantum mechanics has been to enable one to calculate the discrete energy spectrum and the corresponding stationary states - eigenstates of the quantum hamiltonian - of atoms and molecules , neglecting their interactions with the quantized electromagnetic field .",
    "however , if these interactions are taken into account , stationary states corresponding to discrete energies , save for the groundstate , are absent .",
    "the data of atomic and molecular spectroscopy can be interpreted in terms of the decay of metastable states with energies close to the discrete energies , or eigenvalues , of the non - interacting atoms or molecules .",
    "the decay of these states is accompanied by emission of photons with nearly discrete energies equal to differences between energies of stationary states ; ( bohr s frequency condition ) .",
    "these metastable states are called `` ( quantum ) resonances '' .",
    "their analysis is the subject of this paper : we further develop some key ingredients of the mathematical theory of resonances for the standard model of `` non - relativistic quantum electrodynamics '' ( qed ) and for nelson s model of electrons interacting with quantized ( longitudinal lattice ) vibrations , i.e. , phonons . due to the interactions of electrons with massless field quanta - photons or phonons - the standard techniques to analyze quantum - mechanical resonances developed during the past thirty or so years ( see , e.g. , and references therein )",
    "can not be applied to realistic models of atoms or molecules .",
    "our goal , in this paper , is to modify these techniques to cover the present models .    before introducing the models we explain the resonance problem in general terms .",
    "let @xmath0 be a quantum hamiltonian , where @xmath1 is a real parameter called the coupling constant .",
    "assume there is a one - parameter family of unitary transformations , @xmath2 with @xmath3 , s.t .",
    "the family @xmath4 has an analytic continuation in @xmath5 to a disc @xmath6 in the complex plane .",
    "we call such an analytic continuation a _ complex deformation _ of @xmath0 .",
    "we note that , while the essential spectrum of @xmath7 usually changes dramatically under such an analytic continuation , the eigenvalues are locally independent of @xmath8 for suitably chosen deformation transformations @xmath9 , at least when they are isolated . moreover , the real eigenvalues of @xmath7 coincide with the eigenvalues of @xmath0 . the complex eigenvalues of @xmath10 are called the ( quantum @xmath11)resonance eigenvalues - or just resonance eigenvalues - of the hamiltonian @xmath0 . the transformations most commonly used is the group of dilatations of positions and momenta ( see below ) , and the corresponding resonances are sometimes called `` dilatation resonances '' .    it is plausible from our definition that resonances - at least for weakly coupled systems ( @xmath1 small ) - are closely related to eigenvalues of @xmath12 but what is their physical significance ?",
    "physically , one thinks of quantum resonances as long - lived metastable states or as `` bumps '' in the scattering cross - section as a function of energy .",
    "the energies and life - times of metastable states are given by the bumps centers and the inverse of the bumps widths .",
    "a known approach to establish such properties is as follows .",
    "let @xmath13 denote the dense linear subspace of @xmath11entire vectors , i.e. , vectors @xmath14 for which the family @xmath15 has an analytic continuation to the entire complex plane .",
    "for such vectors one has the `` combes formula '' @xmath16 if we continue the r.h.s .",
    "analytically , first in @xmath5 and then in @xmath17 then we see that matrix elements , @xmath18 of the resolvent , for @xmath19 and @xmath20 have an analytic continuation in @xmath21 across the essential spectrum of @xmath0 to the `` second riemann sheet '' whenever the resolvent set of the operator @xmath22 contains a part of this essential spectrum . ] .",
    "clearly , eigenvalues of @xmath22 in the lower complex half - plane , @xmath23 , are poles of this analytic continuation , provided these eigenvalues are isolated .    in the latter case ,",
    "the metastability property can be established ( at least , for weakly coupled systems ) by using the relation - via the fourier transform - between the propagator and the resolvent , contour deformation and cauchy s theorem ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the `` bumpiness '' of the cross - section can be connected to the resonance poles .",
    "the real and imaginary parts of the resonance eigenvalues give the energy and the rate of decay , or the reciprocal life - time , of the metastable state .",
    "the situation described above is exactly the one encountered in quantum mechanics . in non - relativistic qed and phonon models ,",
    "the resonance eigenvalues are _ not isolated _ ; more precisely , a branch of essential spectrum is attached to every complex eigenvalue of the deformed hamiltonian @xmath7 .",
    "this is due to the fact that photons and phonons are _ massless_. as a result , establishing the property of metastability and the pole structure of the resolvent ( and the related bumpiness of the cross - section ) becomes a challenge . in this paper , we prove , for non - relativistic qed and nelson s model , the metastability property of resonances and characterize them in terms of poles of a meromorphic continuation of the matrix elements of the resolvent on a dense set of vectors .",

    "eqn follows in the same way as , provided we prove that still holds if one replaces @xmath182 and @xmath539 respectively by @xmath540 and @xmath541 .",
    "to prove the latter property , we note that @xmath542 where @xmath543 and similarly for @xmath544 , @xmath545 , @xmath546 and @xmath547 . using that @xmath548 and the fact that @xmath549 has the same eigenvalues as @xmath550 we write @xmath551^{-1}\\overline{p}^\\delta_\\theta= \\left [ e^{-\\theta } h_f^ { \\geqslant \\sigma } + \\lambda_j - z \\right ] ^{-1 } ( p_{p , j , \\theta } ^\\delta \\otimes \\overline{p}_\\omega^ { \\geqslant \\sigma } ) \\ ] ] @xmath552^{-1}(\\overline{p}_{p , j , \\theta } ^\\delta \\otimes i).\\ ] ] using this decomposition we conclude , similarly to , that for @xmath553 and @xmath21 in @xmath554 , we have the for some positive constants @xmath384 , @xmath385 @xmath555^{-1 } \\left ( - w_{g,\\theta}^ { \\delta , \\geqslant \\sigma } \\left [ \\overline{p}^\\delta_\\theta h_{0,\\theta}^ { \\delta , \\geqslant \\sigma } - z \\right ] ^{-1 } \\right ) ^n \\right \\|",

    "finally , the term @xmath568 is quadratic in @xmath569 . putting it to the normal form and using the estimates and leads to the estimate @xmath570 . collecting the above estimates and using that @xmath571 , we arrive at @xmath572 next , we pull @xmath559 , with @xmath560 sufficiently small , from @xmath109 and use the above estimate to obtain @xmath573 therefore , the largest contribution to @xmath517 comes from the term that involves the difference of the eigenvalues . taking into account the factor @xmath263 obtained from the @xmath21 integration yields that @xmath574    one can estimate the operators @xmath575 similarly . in particular , we claim that @xmath576 for @xmath577 .",
