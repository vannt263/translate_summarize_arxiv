    "the generation and characterization of beam halo has been of increasing importance as beam intensities increase , particularly in a machine such as the fermilab booster .",
    "the fnal booster provides a proton beam that ultimately is used for collider experiments , antiproton production , and neutrino experiments  all high intensity applications .",
    "the injection energy of the booster is 400 mev , low enough that space charge dynamics can contribute to beam halo production .",
    "beam loss , in large part due to halo particles , has resulted in high radiation loads in the booster ring .",
    "the beam loss must be continuously monitored , with safeguards to insure that average loss rates do not exceed safe levels for ground water , the tunnel exterior , and residual radiation within the tunnel .",
    "collimation systems have been installed to localize beam loss within shielded regions  @xcite .",
    "methods have been developed to characterize beam halo that are based on analyzing the kurtosis of the beam profile  @xcite .",
    "kurtosis is a measure of whether a data set is peaked or flat relative to a normal ( gaussian ) distribution .",
    "distributions with high kurtosis have sharp peaks near the mean that come down rapidly to heavy tails .",
    "the kurtosis will decrease or go negative as a distribution becomes more square , such as in cases where shoulders develop on the beam profile .",
    "an important feature of quantifiers such as the _ profile _ and _ halo parameters _ ( introduced by crandall , allen , and wangler in refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite ) is that they are model independent .",
    "such beam shape quantities based on moments of the beam particle distribution are discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , which extends previous work based on 1d spatial projections  @xcite to a 2d particle beam phase space formalism .",
    "these studies utilize numerical simulations of the physics which cause the halo generation , but ignore the potential effects of the detectors used in the experimental measurements . in realistic accelerator operating conditions and , to some extent , also in carefully prepared dedicated beam halo measuring experiments , instrumental effects can reduce the effectiveness of the above defined quantities . even when state - of - the - art 3d numerical simulations are used to model realistic experiments , the models fail to describe the measured beam distributions to the desired detail  @xcite . in the following , we will investigate the use of shape parameters relevant to the profiles observed with the fermilab booster ipm , and will study how they perform using realistice 3d particle beam simulations and a model of the ipm detector response .",
    "beam profile measurements in the fermilab booster are almost exclusively done with an ion profile monitor ( ipm )  @xcite .",
    "the booster ipm is able to extract horizontal and vertical beam profiles on a turn - by - turn basis for an entire booster cycle .",
    "the ipm relies on the ionization of background gas by the particle beam in the vicinity of the detector .",
    "a high voltage field is applied locally , causing the ionized particles to migrate to micro - strip counters on a multi - channel plate .",
    "the applied high voltage is perpendicular to the measurement axis of the multi - channel plate , so that it does not alter the relative transverse positions of the ions .",
    "however , the space charge fields of the particle beam affect the transverse trajectories of the ions , requiring a sophisticated calibration of the ipm to relate the measured width of the distribution to the true width of the particle beam  @xcite .",
    "this paper describes a new quantity for characterizing beam profiles , @xmath0 .",
    "we start by describing the observed beam profiles in the booster and their parametrization .",
    "we then define and calculate kurtosis and @xmath0 for the resulting functional form .",
    "next , we consider the effect of the systematic and statistical uncertainties in the ipm detector on both kurtosis and @xmath0 .",
    "we then combine a simulation of beam dynamics with a simulation of the ipm detector response in order to demonstrate that @xmath0 can be used to characterize the non - gaussian beam tails in the booster .",
    "we compare the sensitivity of @xmath0 to that of kurtosis , and we find that @xmath0 is a superior discriminator of beam halo when realistic beam shapes , detector effects and uncertainties are taken into account",
    ". finally , we present the results of two booster beam studies performed with and without beam collimators , which demonstrate the sensitivity of @xmath0 to non - gaussian beam tails .",
    "the booster ipm is used to measure beam profiles under a wide range of operating conditions , ranging from normal operating conditions to machine tuning and beam studies under potentially extreme conditions .",
    "the beams under these conditions vary considerably . following the standard experimental procedure for characterizing a peak signal combined with a potentially large background by fitting to a gaussian plus polynomial background ,",
    "the ipm data are characterized by fitting the profiles to a sum of gaussian and linear functions  @xcite , @xmath1 where @xmath2 @xmath3 and @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 , and @xmath8 are the fitting parameters .",

    "our goal is to describe the shape of the observed beam profiles by some parameter derived from the observed beam shape . for simplicity",
    ", we start by ignoring all detector effects and assume that the measured beam shape is well described by the function @xmath9 defined above .    a standard technique for characterizing the shape of a distribution is to calculate the kurtosis of the distribution , @xmath10 , defined by @xmath11    we now calculate the kurtosis of @xmath9 ( eq .  [ gauss_lin ] ) .",
    "since the function @xmath12 is not compact , we have to restrict ourselves to a fixed range in @xmath13 .",
    "we take the region @xmath14 and use @xmath15 wherever numerical results are needed . ignoring the irrelevant overall normalization , we set @xmath16 and @xmath17 where we have introduced the parameter @xmath18 to characterize the relative fractions of gaussian and linear components . with this definition @xmath19 and @xmath20",
    "we now evaluate @xmath21 neglecting the small difference @xmath22 for @xmath15 , we obtain @xmath23 which is shown in fig .  [ fig : kurtosistheory ] .     for @xmath15 . ]",

    ", kurtosis gives a qualitative measure of the degree to which the distribution is non - gaussian .    in order to find a more quantitative shape measure that is compatible with the experimentally observed gaussian plus linear shape , we start by defining the integral quantities @xmath27 and @xmath28 by @xmath29 and @xmath30 and use the ratio @xmath0 as our new shape parameter .",

    "extracting beam shape information from the booster ipm is complicated by the beam intensity - dependent smearing of the signal and statistical noise .",
    "the smearing effect comes from the electromagnetic field generated by the beam itself .",
    "the observed beam shape is a convolution of the true shape with the response function of the detector , the _ smearing function_. the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite studied the ipm smearing function and developed a system for extracting the true beam width from the observed ipm data . in the case discussed in the reference ,",
    "the objective was to study the evolution of the statistical emittance of the beam , which only depends on the second moment of the beam profile . by assuming a gaussian shape for the true beam distribution , it was possible to invert the smearing function as it applies to the beam size .",
    "experimental measurements utilizing independent measurements of the beam size verified that the inversion of the smearing function is accurate when applied to beam size .",
    "since halo studies require quantitative measurement of the _ shape _ of the beam in addition to the size , any inversion of the smearing function would be strongly dependent on the assumed shape .",
    "furthermore , independent measurements of the true beam shape are not readily available , so experimental verification is excluded .",
    "the method we present in these paper avoids the difficulties of inverting the ipm smearing function by operating directly on the raw ipm data . where we compare the experimental data with predictions from beam dynamics simulations , we smear the simulation results in order to compare them with data .",
    "the smearing function is not the only experimental complication .",
    "each channel in the ipm includes a constant pedestal that must be subtracted from the data .",
    "before each ipm run , 30 pedestal triggers are collected ; these triggers are used to find the mean and standard deviation of the pedestal .",
    "[ fig : peds ] shows the typical pedestal variation present in the ipm .",
    "the pedestal introduces a fluctuation in the data that is constant across the entire detector .",
    "we take this source of error into account when calculating the fits to eq .",
    "[ gauss_lin ] , so the expected effect on @xmath0 is only a small increase in the overall error .",
    "the kurtosis calculation suffers a much larger error because of the effect of the @xmath36 term ; the error in @xmath13 far from @xmath37 is magnified fourfold .",
    "we will see below that the end result is a smaller overall fractional error in @xmath0 than in kurtosis when extracting from data .",
    "in order to test our @xmath0 technique and compare it with kurtosis , we employ an integrated simulation of both the booster accelerator and the ipm detector .",
    "our accelerator model is based on the code synergia  @xcite , which includes halo generating effects such as nonlinearities in the accelerator lattice and 3d space - charge effects .",
    "our ipm detector model includes both the space - charge effects on the ipm response  @xcite and pedestal variations .",
    "we simulate a variety of initial beam shapes , ranging from a gaussian with no space - charge effects , to beam with severe halo component , much larger than what is usually observed experimentally at the booster . in order to generate beams with large halo that are realistic",
    ", we construct an initial beam containing a matched gaussian component combined with a completely flat ( and mismatched ) halo component , then use synergia to simulate its evolution through two revolutions through the booster .",
    "the resulting beam has a profile that is qualitatively consistent with observed beam profiles .    in fig .",

    "we take seven different input beams with mixing parameters @xmath18 ranging from 0 to 0.7 .",
    "we then pass them through two simulated revolutions of the booster cycle and then the detector simulation .",
