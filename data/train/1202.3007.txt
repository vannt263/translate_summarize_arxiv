    "the metal - insulator ( mi ) transition in prru@xmath1p@xmath2 has attracted a great amount of attention since its discovery.@xcite prru@xmath1p@xmath2 has the filled skutterudite structure , where a pr atom is contained in a cage - shaped p@xmath2 molecule . due to the large coordination number",

    "this property has made prru@xmath1p@xmath2 an attractive stage to study the interaction between 4@xmath6 configuration with the conduction electrons .",

    "with theoretical considerations,@xcite it is currently believed that a novel charge density wave ( cdw ) formation is responsible for the mi transition . unlike the conventional cdw where",
    "the spatial modulation is provided by strong electron - lattice coupling , in the cdw of prru@xmath1p@xmath2 the modulation is provided by the formation of two pr sublattices , where the crystal field - split 4@xmath4 level scheme in one sublattice is different from that in the other.@xcite the microscopic nature of the @xmath11-@xmath4 hybridized electronic structure deserves further studies .",

    "<S> optical conductivity [ @xmath0 of prru@xmath1p@xmath2 has been studied under high pressure to 14  gpa , at low temperatures to 8  k , and at photon energies 12  mev-1.1  ev . the energy gap in @xmath3 at ambient pressure , caused by a metal - insulator transition due to an unconventional charge - density - wave formation at 63  k , is gradually filled in with increasing pressure to 10  gpa . at 14  gpa and below 30  k , @xmath3 exhibits a pronounced drude - type component due to free carriers . </S>",
    "<S> this indicates that the initial insulating ground state at zero pressure has been turned into a metallic one at 14  gpa . </S>",
    "<S> this is consistent with a previous resistivity study under pressure , where the resistivity rapidly decreased with cooling below 30  k at 14  gpa . </S>",
    "<S> the evolution of electronic structure with pressure is discussed in terms of the hybridization between the 4@xmath4 and conduction electrons . </S>"
