    "these studies can be extended and generalized towards the analysis of a system composed of n harmonic oscillators coupled to an environment modeled as an ensemble of harmonic oscillators .",

    "it is our motivation here to show the promise of white noise analysis in evaluating propagators for open quantum systems .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "the first section will present the system and the bath , together with their corresponding hamiltonians , considered in this study .",
    "the second and third sections will discuss some basics on white noise analysis and the recasting of feynman path integral in the context of white noise analysis following ref .",
    "finally , the fourth section will present the application of white noise analysis to derive the quantum propagator , before we conclude with a short summary .",
    "in this section , we review the fundamentals of white noise analysis , which is the mathematical tool that will be used in evaluating the feynman path integral arising in the quantum propagators describing the dynamics of the system .      the hamiltonians of the system @xmath0 , which is a simple harmonic oscillator , the environment @xmath1 , consisting of @xmath2 harmonic oscillators ( see fig .",

    "moreover , we assume that the environment coordinate is linearly coupled to the system , with the coupling described in terms of the hamiltonian @xmath3 , given above . thus , the total hamiltonian can be written as @xmath10      formally , a stochastic process like brownian motion obeys the stochastic differential equation given by @xmath11 where @xmath12 describes the brownian motion , @xmath13 is the wiener process , @xmath14 and @xmath15 ^ 2 $ ] are the drift and diffusion coefficients , respectively .",

    "<S> white noise analysis is used to derive the propagator of an open quantum system consisting of a harmonic oscillator which is coupled to an environment consisting of n multimode harmonic oscillators . </S>",
    "<S> the quantum propagators are obtained after solving for the normal modes of the system - environment interaction in order to decouple the coordinates in the lagrangian describing the dynamics of the system , the environment and their interaction with each other . </S>",
    "<S> the decoupled lagrangian is then used in the path integral corresponding to the propagator of the system , with the path integral evaluated using white noise analysis . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting propagator is then found to consist of a product of n simple harmonic oscillator propagators . </S>",
    "<S> n-2 of these propagators correspond to the degenerate normal mode frequencies of the system - environment interaction , while the other 2 correspond to the non - degenerate normal mode frequencies . </S>",
    "<S> this method of deriving the propagators greatly simplifies the task of mathematically describing the dynamics of the open quantum system . </S>",
    "<S> the ease of use of this method suggests that , together with its inherent mathematical rigor , white noise analysis can be a powerful tool in analyzing the dynamics of an open quantum system . </S>"
