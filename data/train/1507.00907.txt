    "the central region of our galaxy is dominated by a bar @xcite , which consists of an x - shaped box / peanut bulge at @xmath9 @xcite and a vertically thin part , the _ long bar _ , extending to @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "recently , the apache point observatory galactic evolution experiment ( apogee ) survey @xcite has revealed that the line of sight velocity @xmath1 distributions of @xmath11 k / m giant stars towards the galactic centre at galactic coordinates @xmath12 degrees and @xmath13 degrees exhibit distinct shoulders at high velocities @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "this result was followed up by other surveys , which yielded differing results : on the one hand , @xcite analysed the @xmath1 distribution of @xmath14 bar red clump stars at @xmath15 degrees and @xmath16 degrees and found hints of a distinct high @xmath1 component at @xmath17 at positive @xmath3 and additionally of a distinct low @xmath1 component at @xmath18 at negative @xmath3 .",
    "on the other hand , @xcite failed to detect distinct high or low @xmath1 components in a survey of @xmath19 red clump stars in the central galaxy .",
    "however , they were probing different sight - lines , most of them at @xmath20 degrees and thus further away from the plane than the other authors , or pointing more closely towards the galactic centre at @xmath21 .",
    "bars are rotating triaxial structures which are expected to be supported mostly by stars on prograde orbits parented by the @xmath7 family of closed long - axis orbits @xcite .",
    "these orbits have proven essential in explaining the @xmath22 diagram of gas towards the galactic centre @xcite and are thus expected to be an important ingredient for explaining any observation of the kinematics of bar stars . @xcite",
    "have recently shown that they could recover a distinct high @xmath1 peak in an @xmath0-body simulation of a barred galaxy if they analysed only 2:1 resonant orbits elongated along the long bar axis , i.e. @xmath7 orbits .",
    "they did not recover the feature when taking into account all stars .",
    "previously , @xcite and @xcite had failed to recover the observational feature in @xmath0-body simulations of milky way ( mw ) like galaxies .",
    "this led @xcite to conclude that the high @xmath1 peak is either a spurious feature due to low numbers of stars or not connected to stars on bar orbits .",
    "here we analyse a controlled simulation of a growing mw - like disc galaxy with respect to @xmath1 distributions towards the barred galactic centre .",
    "the model galaxy features a live dark halo and is continuously fed with stellar and gas particles on near circular orbits .",
    "this type of simulation was introduced by @xcite for a 2d disc but has scarcely been used since ( e.g. @xcite for a specific problem ) .",
    "the disc develops a bar early on and becomes comparable in structure to the mw at later stages , which allows us to create @xmath1 distributions and compare them to the apogee data .    with the help of this simulation",
    ", we explore the origin of the high @xmath1 structures and fit the detections and non - detections into a consistent picture .",
    "we find that these features are associated with a kinematically cool population of stars running alongside the bar and likely recently captured from the galactic disc as a consequence of bar growth .",
    "our paper is organised as follows : basic information about the data and simulation are found in section 2 ( survey data , selection function ) and section 3 ( simulation setup ) .",
    "the general evolution of disc and bar in our simulation is discussed in section 4 .",
    "detailed kinematics are analysed in section 5 with focus on the high @xmath1 peak . in section 6",
    "we apply the apogee selection function and directly compare the model to the data .",
    "we also explore some variation of assumed parameters , e.g. latitude @xmath23 and bar angle @xmath24 . in section 7",
    ", we use the successfully identified high @xmath1 peak for a detailed study of the contributing orbits .",

    "for kinematic data from the central bar / bulge region of the mw we use data from the apache point observatory galactic evolution experiment ( apogee , @xcite ) , an infrared , high - resolution survey , which is part of the sloan digital sky survey iii ( sdss * ? ? ?",
    "the fibre - spectrograph allows for @xmath30 spectra per plate covering a spectral range of @xmath31 in the @xmath32 band . as an infrared survey",
    ", apogee has a unique capability to obtain information from stars in the high - extinction regions within the galactic plane and towards the central region of the mw .",
    "we use the apogee data publicly available via the cas for sdss dr10 @xcite . throughout this work ,",
    "we correct all observed stellar velocities from apogee to the galactic standard of rest , using @xmath33 , in concordance with @xcite and @xcite .",
    "another advantage of the survey is the benign selection function described in @xcite .",
    "stars in the target magnitude range with dereddened colours @xmath34 are targeted evenly . in the case of the central galaxy fields used within this work ,",
    "stars were targeted for @xmath35 . to model the selection function",
    "we employ the population synthesis machinery from the @xcite model .",
    "we apply a standard salpeter imf with an exponent of @xmath36 , neglecting binarity of stars .",
    "the population synthesis uses a dense grid of b.a.s.t.i .",
    "stellar models ( @xcite , for their colour calibrations see @xcite ) . at each distance @xmath27 and age @xmath25",
    "we count the number of stars per mass of the initial population that would end up within the colour and magnitude selection of apogee .",
    "the result is shown in figure [ selfu ] for a fixed metallicity of @xmath37 .",
    "the use of a single , slightly super - solar metallicity is a simplification , as the inner mw has a relatively wide metallicity distribution around this value @xcite .",
    "however , all relevant metallicities show a similar preference for the detection of young stars .",
    "as the detailed age - metallicity distributions for the relevant sightlines are not well known and the detailed connection between model galaxy and mw in terms of structure and formation history is unclear , we choose to keep the model simple and use one typical metallicity .",
    "the band of high selection probabilities at very small distances derives from main - sequence dwarf stars .",
    "the stellar models are not fully reliable in this region for such cool dwarfs . however , this foreground is strongly suppressed by the geometric factor ( @xmath38 ) of the pencil beam survey .",
    "the number of stars currently in the giant stages of interest to us declines strongly ( by roughly one order of magnitude ) with age , implying a strong bias in favour of young stars within the apogee survey .",
    "we apply this selection function to our @xmath0-body simulation by weighting each particle with its respective selection probability .",
    "apogee uses dereddened magnitudes for targeting , however there are residual effects from reddening uncertainties , which we neglect here .",
    "in this paper we present a controlled collisionless+hydrodynamic simulation of a growing galactic disc embedded in a non - growing dark matter halo .",
    "the simulations were all carried out with the tree smoothed particle hydrodynamics ( treesph ) code gadget-3 , last described in @xcite .",
    "the applied gravitational softening lengths are @xmath39 for stellar and gaseous disc particles and @xmath40 for halo particles .",
    "we use an opening angle for the tree code of @xmath41 . an adaptive time - stepping scheme which assigns time steps in bins @xmath42 according to @xmath43 to individual particles",
    "is applied . here",
    "@xmath44 is an accuracy parameter and @xmath45 is the gravitational acceleration at the position of particle @xmath46 with softening @xmath47 .",
    "the base timestep @xmath25 is appropriately chosen by the code and a maximum of 10 myr is allowed for timesteps .",
    "the hydrodynamical timestep is based on a courant - like condition @xmath48 , where @xmath49 is the courant parameter , @xmath50 is the smoothing length and @xmath51 is the soundspeed .",
    "we apply an isothermal equation of state @xmath52 with @xmath53 and use @xmath54 neighbours for the smoothing kernel . for further code details",
    "we refer to @xcite .      to generate initial conditions ( ics ) for our numerical experiments we use the publicly available galic code @xcite , which produces near - equilibrium ics of multi - component collisionless systems with given density distributions using an iterative approach .",
    "the initial system consists of a dark halo with a mass of @xmath55 represented by @xmath56 particles and an embedded thin galactic disc with a mass of @xmath57 represented by @xmath58 particles , so that the disc particle mass is @xmath59 .",
    "the dark halo has a hernquist profile with @xmath60 the inner profile is adjusted so that it is similar to an nfw profile with concentration @xmath61 and virial radius @xmath62 .",
    "this leads to a scale radius @xmath63 .",
    "the halo initially has a spherical density profile and radially isotropic kinematics , i.e. equal velocity dispersion in the principal directions , @xmath64 and consequently a value of the anisotropy parameter of @xmath65 .",
    "the disc is set up with a mass profile @xmath66 with an exponential scalelength of @xmath67 and an isothermal vertical profile with a radially constant scaleheight of @xmath68 .",
    "the vertical velocity dispersion @xmath69 thus declines with radius .",
    "we assume @xmath70 , so that toomre s @xmath71 shows a minimum value of @xmath72 at @xmath73 .    for further information regarding the ics we refer to aumer et al .",
    "( in prep . ) .",
    "we note that here the halo is rather poorly resolved with @xmath56 and a rather short softening length ( @xmath74 ) is applied .",
    "the low @xmath75 is due to limited computational resources and a preference to use them to resolve the disc .",
    "as expected ( e.g. @xcite ) , purely collisionless ( no sph ) tests with a higher @xmath76 show reduced disc heating and less bar slowdown .",
    "yet the disc heating for the simulation studied here is comparable to the mw , with similar velocity dispersions for 10 gyr old solar neighbourhood stars , since heating by massive halo particles compensates the lack of heating by giant molecular clouds or other sources such as satellite galaxies .",
    "as far as bar slowdown due to angular momentum transfer to the halo is concerned , the radius and rotation frequency of bars differ by less than @xmath77 20 per cent at late times ( 6 - 10 gyr ) , the time relevant for this work .",
    "+      to model the continuous growth of galactic discs via star formation and gas accretion we , over a timespan of 10 gyr , add new particles with @xmath59 to the existing disc every 5 myr .",
    "we assume a mass growth rate history given by @xmath78 with an exponential decay timescale @xmath79 , which is motivated by the findings of @xcite , and a normalisation @xmath80 , so that a total of @xmath81 are fed over 10 gyr .",
    "the added disc mass is radially distributed as @xmath82 , with an exponential scale - length that increases with time as @xmath83 this increase from @xmath84 to a scale - length at 10 gyr @xmath85 is motivated by the findings of @xcite .",
    "the particles are randomly scattered over azimuth @xmath24 and placed at @xmath86 .",
    "the coordinate system is regularly updated to be centred on the centre of mass of the system .",
    "the particles are assigned near circular orbits .",
    "we determine the new particles rotational velocities as @xmath87 for a particle @xmath46 at cylindrical radius @xmath88 and the component of the gravitational acceleration pointing towards the centre , @xmath89 . for stellar particles ,",
    "we add random velocity components in all three directions @xmath24 , @xmath90 and @xmath91 , drawn from gaussian distributions with @xmath92 .",
    "after a disc goes bar unstable , there are no stable circular orbits in the bar region .",
    "so we impose an inner cutoff radius @xmath93 , within which no particles are introduced .",
    "we use the radius where the logarithm of the @xmath94 fourier amplitude @xmath95 drops below @xmath96 as an inner cutoff radius .      in disc galaxies ,",
    "bars slow down and grow in size due to the transfer of angular momentum to the dark halo @xcite .",
    "this loss is to some extent balanced by the transfer of angular momentum from the gas to the bar @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is desirable to include a gas component in barred disc galaxy models . we do not wish to introduce a full model containing the accretion of gas onto the galaxy , its cooling and the subsequent star formation and feedback processes ( see e.g. @xcite for an isolated galaxy model ) , as uncertainties regarding the modelling of the physical processes are high",
    "( see e.g. @xcite ) .    to keep the model simple ,",
    "we add a constant fraction of gas to our galactic disc and model it with an isothermal equation of state @xmath52 with @xmath53 .",
    "we simulate the growth of the disc by continuously adding stellar and gas particles .",
    "the initial gas disc is created by turning 5 per cent randomly chosen stellar particles into sph particles .",
    "this mild disturbance of the ics is unimportant compared to the rapid onset of disc instability in the growing galaxy . during disc growth we aim at a gas mass fraction in the disc of 10 per cent as observed in modern day mw like disc galaxies .",
    "we achieve this by adding 10 per cent of new particles as gas when the mass fraction of gas in the galaxy is above 10 per cent and 20 per cent of new particles as gas whenever it is lower .",
    "computationally , high gas densities in the central galaxy are very expensive .",
    "therefore we include a number of measures to limit the central density : i ) prior to the bar forming and the inner cutoff on particle insertion coming into play , we create no gas particles at @xmath97 .",
    "ii ) we include a model for star formation in the very central galaxy .",
    "we turn sph particles with hydrogen number densities @xmath98 and specific angular momentum @xmath99 into star particles with a probability @xmath100 , where @xmath101 is an efficiency parameter , @xmath102 is the local dynamical timescale and @xmath103 is the timestep of the particle . to mimic the effect of a central galactic outflow @xcite",
    "we only turn one out of five particles into a star and remove the other 4 out of five from the simulation .",
    "note that only gas particles in the inner bar region are affected by these prescriptions .",
    "in this section we discuss the structure of our model of a barred disc galaxy .",
    "note that we are comparing a specific - and in no way fitted - model to a specific galaxy , the milky way . though our model should not provide a perfect match to our galaxy",
    ", we expect the model to qualitatively share important characteristics .",
    "note that due to computational limitations we currently have only one model of this type including hydrodynamics available .",
    "+    in figure [ bar - evo ] we present the evolution of bar parameters in our simulation .",
    "we determine a bar radial extent @xmath104 by first calculating the @xmath94 fourier amplitude profile @xmath105 where n(r ) is the number of particles in the radial bin centred on @xmath90 and we only take into account stellar particles .",
    "then we define @xmath104 as the radius where @xmath106 drops below -1.5 or as zero if it never reaches the value in the central area .",
    "in the left panel of figure [ bar - evo ] we see that the bar forms in the first gyr , but its radius and strength are varying significantly . from @xmath107 gyr on the bar grows almost linearly in time to reach @xmath108 at @xmath109 gyr .",
    "our definition for @xmath104 allows no exact comparison to the values cited for the length of the mw long bar . @xcite",
    "determine a length of 5 kpc and give 4 kpc as a lower limit , not in disagreement with our model .",
    "+    in the middle panel of figure [ bar - evo ] we present the evolution of the bar rotational frequency @xmath110 determined by following the angle of the bar major axis from snapshot to snapshot .",
    "the bar initially rotates with a frequency of @xmath111 , but as the loss of angular momentum to the halo is not balanced by the transfer of angular momentum from the inflowing gas component , @xmath110 steadily declines to reach @xmath112 at the end of the simulation . for the mw bar this quantity is little constrained .",
    "while our value is lower than most estimates for the mw @xcite , the value is in concordance with a recent estimate by @xcite ( see their section 8.3 for a discussion of deduced mw bar pattern speeds ) .",
    "our model is thus at the lower end of values inferred for the mw .    in figure [ images ] we present surface density projections of the whole galaxy model and the bar region at a simulation time @xmath113 gyr .",
    "the lower panels show face - on views of the stellar and the gaseous components . apparently , the galaxy is dominated by the bar within @xmath114 and shows flocculent spiral structure at outer radii .",
    "the upper panels give close ups of the bar region .",
    "the face - on view shows two distinct radial regions in terms of minor axis extent . at @xmath9 ,",
    "the bar shows a mildly elongated structure , at @xmath115 a thinner , long bar structure is visible . the edge - on view reveals , that the region @xmath9 is dominated by an x - shaped structure with the tips of this structure at @xmath116 , very similar to the structure of the mw bulge / bar region inferred by @xcite .",
    "this view also shows that the outer bar is significantly thinner . around the tips of the bar we measure a vertical exponential scale - height of 180 pc , similar to the long bar scale - height inferred by @xcite , but without a super - thin 45 pc component as found by these authors .",
    "such a component is likely too thin to be resolved in our simulation , considering our softening length of 30 pc .    at a solar neighbourhood like radius @xmath117",
    ", we find that our model at 7.3 gyr has a stellar exponential scale - length of 3.5 kpc , which grows mildly towards 10 gyr .",
    "the disc is thus likely more extended than that of the mw , for which estimates usually range at 2 - 3 kpc .",
    "the model has a total baryonic mass of @xmath118 at 7.3 gyr , it has grown from a mass of @xmath119 at @xmath120 .    in the right panel of figure [ bar - evo ]",
    "we plot the circular velocity curve @xmath121 in the plane of the model galaxy at 7.3 and 9.3 gyr .",
    "the contributions from dark matter and baryons are shown in red and blue .",
    "we measure @xmath122 by calculating the component of the gravitational acceleration pointing towards the centre @xmath123 on an @xmath124 grid at @xmath86 and at each @xmath90 average over the equally distributed values of @xmath24 .",
    "we note that the circular velocity curve in the centre of the mw is not well constrained and that it is uncertain how the observations of gas velocities in the mw bar are connected to our definition of @xmath121 .",
    "there is only mild evolution from 7.3 to 9.3 gyr visible in @xmath121 .",
    "the circular velocity curves show features at the bar radius , deriving from the baryonic matter distribution .",
    "the reason for these features is that the bar redistributes matter towards the centre , whereas by construction of the model new baryons are added outside the bar region , which gives rise to the baryonic dip at @xmath125 . in our model ,",
    "the baryonic contribution to the circular velocity is greater than the dark matter equivalent only within @xmath126 .",
    "it is unclear how this relates to the mw , but our model agrees with two important constraints : a ) at @xmath117 and 7.3 gyr we recover @xmath127 , in good agreement with what @xcite finds from local kinematics .",
    "b ) the total dark matter mass within a sphere of @xmath128 is @xmath129 in good agreement with the dark matter mass within a sphere of solar galactic radius that @xcite have deduced .    at the evolution stages relevant for this paper , the model has a slow bar with @xmath130 , where @xmath131 is the bar corotation radius .",
    "this is likely connected to the fact that our galaxy model is _ sub - maximum _ , i.e. the dark matter contribution to the circular velocity curve is significant in the bar / disc region , as fast bars with @xmath132 are thought to require _ maximum _ discs with baryon - dominated circular velocity curves @xcite .",
    "in the previous section we have shown that the bar emerging in our galaxy model has comparable structural parameters to the mw bar .",
    "we now extract line of sight velocity @xmath1 distributions from our model and qualitatively compare them to the results of @xcite . in this section ,",
    "we limit ourselves to the general understanding of the observed phenomena .",
    "we will attempt a quantitative comparison to observed data in the following section .",
    "as we expect stars moving along the major axis of the bar to be the source of the stars that comprise the high @xmath1 peak , we focus here on the central region of the model , defined by galactocentric @xmath133 .",
    "the full model including the selection function will be discussed in the next section .    to create @xmath1 distributions we place ourselves at a solar radius of @xmath134 @xcite and orient the bar to an angle of @xmath24 between its major axis and the sun - galactic centre sightline .",
    "values found for @xmath24 in the literature range between 15 and 40 degrees . for most of this paper we choose @xmath135 degrees and show in the next section that our conclusions are unchanged for the full range of cited values .",
    "we usually define sightlines which are 2 degrees wide in @xmath3 and @xmath23 and centred on the given values .",
    "to curb poisson noise we use the @xmath136 ( @xmath94 ) symmetry of the model and use two sightlines per snapshots , 180 degrees apart in azimuth . for each plot",
    "we stack 50 snapshots , separated in time by 1 myr and rotate the bar to achieve the same value of @xmath24 for each snapshot .    in figure",
    "[ vlos - all ] , we show @xmath1 histograms at latitudes @xmath137 degrees at a simulation time of 7.3 gyr for eight different longitudes @xmath3 between @xmath138 and @xmath139 degrees .",
    "the figure shows histograms for all bar stars with @xmath133 in blue and for the subset of young star particles with ages @xmath140 gyr in red .",
    "the @xmath1 distributions for all stars ( blue lines ) do not reveal significant features at high velocities .",
    "this is consistent with recent examinations of simulations in @xcite , @xcite and @xcite , who also detected no features when all stars are taken into account .",
    "+    @xcite reported peaks of high velocity stars with @xmath141 of varying extent for longitudes",
    "@xmath3 between @xmath138 and @xmath142 degrees and @xcite reported such peaks for @xmath143 and @xmath144 degrees and a peak at @xmath145 at @xmath146 degrees .",
    "closer inspection of the blue histograms at @xmath147 and @xmath148 degrees reveals an excess of stars at the expected @xmath1 values .",
    "moreover , the position of the main peak in the @xmath1 distribution decreases with decreasing @xmath3 as observed by @xcite .",
    "these main peaks of the distributions are , however , wider in the model than in the observation .",
    "the fact that the apogee selection function ( figure [ selfu ] ) favours young stars motivates to examine only stars with ages @xmath140 gyr shown as red curves . note that stars formed from low angular momentum central gas do not play a role for this analysis and are excluded here .",
    "the main @xmath1 peaks are much narrower for young stars than for all stars , indicating that these populations are cooler .",
    "the red histograms clearly show distinct components at @xmath149 for @xmath150 and @xmath151 degrees and at @xmath152 for @xmath153 and @xmath139 degrees , in agreement with observations .",
    "interestingly , we do not recover a separate component at @xmath154 degrees , where @xcite also claimed to find a distinct high @xmath1 peak , a finding which we will return to in the next section .      as the model young populations show the observed signature , it is interesting to ask whether this is specific to a unique time or stage of bar evolution or a generic feature of young stars . in figure",
    "[ vlos - young ] we examine the evolution of young stellar populations with time plotting the populations which at respective times are less than 2 gyr old .",
    "we consider simulation times 7.3 , 8.3 and 9.3 gyr .",
    "we notice several points : i ) there is very little change in the general shape of the histograms and in the position and width of the main @xmath1 peaks at all longitudes @xmath3 .",
    "ii ) the extreme values of @xmath1 increase with time by around @xmath155 for all sightlines which do not cross the galactic centre .",
    "iii ) the high @xmath156 peaks identified in figure [ vlos - all ] become slightly more distinct in time and also move to higher velocities .",
    "iv ) for 9.3 gyr additional features / peaks become apparent at the opposite side of the main peaks , e.g. at @xmath157 at @xmath158 degrees or at @xmath159 at @xmath146 degrees .",
    "the high @xmath1 features at positive longitudes and low @xmath1 features at negative longitudes are thus stable over time and not connected to any temporary phenomenon . due to the lack of opposite peaks in the apogee data we will focus our analysis on the simulation time 7.3 gyr .    so far we have shown that young stars show high @xmath156 peaks , whereas the whole population of bar stars does not .",
    "it is thus interesting to study in more detail how the @xmath1 distribution evolves with age .",
    "we attempt this in figure [ vlos - age ] , where we concentrate on one sightline , @xmath160 degrees , for which both our simulation and apogee data display a peak at high @xmath1 .",
    "panel e shows how the @xmath1 distribution varies when stars are sorted in four different age bins . whereas the high @xmath1 population is very distinct for stars with ages below 1 gyr , this population becomes less distinct at higher ages .",
    "for stars with ages between 1 and 2 gyr , it is still clearly visible , at 2 - 4 gyr only a small feature remains and for older stars even this weak signature vanishes .",
    "the vanishing of the distinct high @xmath1 population goes hand in hand with broadening of the main @xmath1 peak indicating a heating of the population .     +    to see how this evolves with simulation time , we plot in panels a - d stars in these age bins at three different simulation times , 7.3 , 8.3 and 9.3 gyr .",
    "we notice that there is much less evolution with simulation time than there is with age .",
    "the level of distinction of the high @xmath1 signature remains similar at all considered simulation times for each age bin .    to strengthen these findings we plot in panel f of figure [ vlos - age ] the population of stars born between 6.3 and 7.3 gyr at three different times representing mean population ages 0.5 , 1.5 and 2.5 gyr .",
    "this underlines that the evolution of the @xmath1 distribution with age shows the broadening of the main @xmath1 peak due to heating and the gradual loss of the high @xmath1 peak .",
    "we again notice that the young populations of stars at 9.3 gyr show additional features at the opposite side of the main peak .",
    "closer inspection reveals hints of this feature also at earlier times .",
    "additionally , the main peaks move to higher @xmath1 .",
    "we will provide an explanation for these changes in section 7 .",
    "we note , however , that these additional peaks are only visible if we select young bar stars .",
    "when applying the selection function on all stars along the line of sight , as described in the next section , these features , unlike the conventional high @xmath1 peaks , are too small to be detected .",
    "in the previous section , we have shown that populations of young bar stars are expected to display high @xmath156 features as observed by @xcite and @xcite . in reality ,",
    "not only stars with @xmath133 will contribute to the apogee @xmath1 distributions , but also disc stars in front of or behind the bar . in the following ,",
    "we directly compare the @xmath0-body simulation to the apogee data , applying the selection function described in section 2 .",
    "+      we start with figure [ compare ] , where we compare the @xmath1 histograms for stars with galactocentric radii @xmath133 ( see previous section ) to @xmath1 histograms obtained for the full sightlines .",
    "we do so for three longitudes , @xmath161 and 14 degrees .",
    "the blue curves represent all stars within 4 kpc and the red curves show the subset of young stars , both are taken from figure [ vlos - young ] .",
    "the velocity distributions for all stars along the sightline ( equally weighted , green ) are strikingly different .",
    "their main @xmath1 peaks are significantly narrower and shifted by more than @xmath162 towards zero .",
    "this is due to the dominant contribution by fore- and background disc stars , which are kinematically cold and are observed with the local azimuthal direction nearly perpendicular to the line of sight .",
    "we noticed above that no distinct high @xmath156 feature is found for all stars at @xmath133 .",
    "interestingly this is not true for all stars along the line of sight . in this population , the feature is less distinct than the one for young bar stars , but lies at the same @xmath1 range .",
    "the histograms obtained when weighting all stars along the line of sight according to the selection function presented in section 2 are shown as black lines .",
    "overall , they resemble more the ones for all stars along the line of sight than to the ones for stars at @xmath133 .",
    "when present , the high @xmath156 feature is strengthened by the selection function and the main peak is shifted to slightly larger @xmath156 .    from these comparisons",
    "we conclude that the @xmath1 distribution is not only shaped by stars in the bar region , but by all stars along the line of sight .",
    "this is illustrated by the selection function weighted ( sfw ) distribution of stars along the line - of - sight @xmath163 as a function of distance from the sun @xmath27 in the left panels of figure [ sightline ] ( dashed lines ) .",
    "clearly , the sfw distribution functions do not simply reflect the density distributions along the pencil beams , but are shaped by the age and distance dependent selection function modulated by the beam area increasing as @xmath38 .",

    "the distance distribution of contributing stars @xmath163 is narrowest for @xmath158 degrees and widest for @xmath154 degrees .",
    "the main peaks are at @xmath168 on the rear side of the bar ( front side for @xmath146 degrees ) . to visualise where these contributions arise in relation to the bar , we use the right panel of figure [ sightline ] , where we show the position of the sun in yellow , the considered sightlines in blue , red and orange and the surface density contours of the stellar mass in the bar region at 7.3 gyr in black ( see figure [ images ] ) .",
    "the 95 per cent contribution regions of high @xmath167 stars for each sightline are shown in magenta for stars moving away from the sun and in cyan for stars moving towards the sun at negative longitudes .",
    "we highlight the regions of @xmath169 around the peak distances in darker shades . for @xmath161 degrees ,",
    "these regions are fully within the bar region and strictly on one side of the bar ( rear side for @xmath170 , front for @xmath171 ) , as the fast stars travelling alongside the bar have to lose angular momentum on the way in and gain it on the way out . the contribution region is narrower for @xmath158 degrees as this sightline crosses the bar at a greater angle than the one for @xmath146 degrees .",
    "this indicates that the high @xmath156 features found by @xcite correspond to stars which are associated with the bar region and not with disc orbits .",
    "this confirms the ideas of @xcite and @xcite and rejects the notion of @xcite that the observed features are not related to the bar .    at @xmath154 degrees",
    "there is a tentative feature in observed data , but not in our simulations . if we select the highest @xmath1 stars in the simulation we find that the main contributions come from the edge of the bar , but extend far into the disc region behind the bar . at these longitudes ,",
    "the inner parts of the disc align with the line of sight and start to contribute to the high @xmath1 window .",

    "the feature is less distinct in the simulation . interestingly , at @xmath176 degrees",
    "the sfw histogram provides a worse fit than the ew histogram , as it misses the position of the main peak , which at other longitudes is well reproduced .",
    "when we look slightly above and below the plane at @xmath177 degrees , asymmetries at high @xmath1 are present in apogee data at @xmath178 degrees , but again not at greater @xmath3 .",

    "the location of the main @xmath1 peak is determined by the radial potential gradient ( in idealisation the circular speed ) .",
    "if this differs , simulation and data will show a systematic difference .",
    "ii ) we know that the structure in particular in this region will show differences between simulation and observed data , e.g. caused by a difference in bar length .",
    "a longer bar would mean that we see regions further away from the bar tips .",
    "we can achieve such an effect also by lowering the solar radius .",
    "indeed , if we do so , the asymmetry becomes more prominent .",
    "iii ) another explanation could be the dense ring of molecular clouds at @xmath179 in the mw @xcite .",
    "this ring is associated with an intense radial peak in star formation , which is not matched by our simulations .",
    "the selection function of apogee is very sensitive to young stars .",
    "this feature will have no strong consequence when the sightline is perpendicular to circular orbits at @xmath180 ( at small @xmath3 ) or outside the region ( @xmath181 ) , but sightlines at @xmath182 degrees will be strongly affected . as they pass through @xmath183 at an intermediate angle to the local azimuthal direction , the enhancement of these stars will drive up stellar densities at intermediate @xmath1 and shift the main peak .",
    "overall , the complicated contribution function of stars at these sightlines prevents any strong conclusions to be drawn from this discrepancy .    moving even further away from the plane",
    ", we consider latitudes @xmath184 degrees in the lower row of figure [ apogee ] .",
    "there is no discernible feature , either in observations or simulation .",

    "we do this both for sfw histograms for all stars along the lines of sight ( left panels ) and for ew young central stars ( right panels ) .",
    "the difference between these two types of histograms is even more striking at higher @xmath172 where for young central stars they are significantly broader .",
    "this indicates that young bar stars play a small role in observations at higher latitude .",
    "note also that the number of young bar stars decreases strongly with increasing latitude in the simulations , which explains the noisier nature of the corresponding histograms .",
    "we find that the exponential scaleheight @xmath185 for stars with ages @xmath140 gyr , which contribute to the high @xmath1 features is @xmath186 , compared to @xmath187 for all stars at the ends of the bar .",
    "all panels show that distinct high @xmath156 features are only present close to the plane . at @xmath188 degrees",
    "a mild feature is still present , while at greater @xmath23 there is nothing left .",
    "this explains why @xcite did not discover such features in their data , which are mostly at @xmath189 degrees . their only field at smaller latitude is at @xmath21 , where we do not expect a peak anyway",
    "this can be explained by the fact that the high @xmath1 populations are dynamically cool and thus also live at small vertical distances from the galactic plane .",
    "so far , we have assumed a bar angle of @xmath135 degrees . in the literature",
    ", estimates range from 15 to 40 degrees .",
    "@xcite recently claimed that the high @xmath1 features observed by @xcite could help to constrain @xmath24 and would favour low values @xmath190 degrees . in figure [ phi",
    "] , we thus attempt to study the influence of @xmath24 on @xmath1 distributions .",
    "we consider angles between 10 and 55 degrees for three sightlines and both sfw stars ( upper row ) and young stars with @xmath133 ( lower row ) .",
    "+    we see that both for positive and negative @xmath3 , the high @xmath156 features are less distinct for large @xmath24 .",
    "this can be explained by the larger angle between the sightline and the bar . as the high velocity stars move along the bar , their projected @xmath1 decreases . at larger @xmath24",
    ", stars on different orbits moving at greater angles to the bar can be seen at higher @xmath1 .",
    "as they are less numerous , the feature becomes less prominent .",
    "this is especially clear for young stars at @xmath133 .",
    "if one tried to fit multiple gaussians to the @xmath1 distribution , as did @xcite and @xcite , one would find that the high @xmath1 peak becomes broader and centred at lower @xmath1 as reported by @xcite .    in the upper panels of figure [ phi ] ,",
    "apogee data are plotted over the sfw model .",
    "we should keep in mind the uncertainties in the observations and the fact that the structure and age distribution of the model bar differ in an unknown extent from the mw bar .",
    "we thus conclude that the apogee data put only mild constraints on the bar angle .",
    "they favour small angles , but only strongly disfavour angles @xmath191 degrees .",
    "the estimate by @xcite is also intrinsically overly confident , as they ascribe the high @xmath1 feature to one orbit family only , whereas , as we will show in the next section , several families can contribute .",
    "moreover , degeneracies with the potential , the pattern speed , the bar structure etc complicate their determination of @xmath24 .",
    "to understand better the origin of the high and low @xmath1 peaks discussed above , we focus in this section on the orbits producing these features .",
    "we created snapshots of the simulations at a frequency of 1 per 1 myr from simulation time 7.3 gyr onwards .",
    "we first consider the following exercise : what would the @xmath1 distribution look like if it were only made up of stars that at some point contribute to the high @xmath1 peak .",
    "we therefore select all stars with ages @xmath140 gyr and @xmath133 that at 7.307.35 gyr contribute to the high @xmath1 peak at @xmath160 degrees and @xmath137 degrees .",
    "we then follow these particles for a further 500 myr and construct a @xmath1 distribution at the same @xmath3 and @xmath23 ranges only from these stars .",
    "we do the same 2 gyr later for a new set of stars selected in the same way .",
    "figures [ vlos - age ] and [ vlos - young ] have already shown that the maximum ( minimum ) @xmath1 observed increase ( decrease ) by about @xmath155 within these 2 gyr .",
    "this is because of a growth of both the potential well and the bar and also because of the slowdown of the bar which allows orbits to have lower angular momentum and reach positions closer to the centre and thus cover a larger potential difference .",
    "consequently , we increase the high @xmath1 window from @xmath192 to @xmath193 .",
    "+    these @xmath1 distributions are shown in figure [ vlos - peak ] .",
    "unsurprisingly they have their main peaks at the selection positions .",
    "both distributions clearly show a distinct peak at negative @xmath1 made up by orbits returning along the other side of the bar .",
    "this peak was already visible in figure [ vlos - age ] for 9.3 gyr .",
    "the increase in maximum absolute velocities between 7.3 and 9.3 gyr widens the gap between the peaks and shifts the main peak of the overall distributions for stars within @xmath133 to higher @xmath1 .",
    "consequently the negative @xmath1 peak at 9.3 gyr for figure [ vlos - age ] becomes visible .",
    "the negative peak comprises approaching stars while the positive peak features stars moving away from the sun .",
    "figure [ vlos - peak ] reveals a third peak for 7.3 gyr indicating that a group of orbits has a more complicated structure than alternately contributing to the two peaks .",
    "in the right panel of figure [ vlos - peak ] we visualise the origin of the high and low @xmath1 peaks at @xmath193 and @xmath157 for young bar stars at 9.3 gyr from spatially separate components along the line of sight . here",
    "we plot the spatial positions of all stars in the positive @xmath1 peak at 9.3 gyr in black and of all stars in the negative @xmath1 peak at 9.3 gyr in red .",
    "the components clearly separate to the expected sides .",
    "one orbit family that would contribute to both peaks are the @xmath7 orbits . in the rotating frame of the bar , these orbits move along opposing sides of the bar major axis and",
    "turn around at the bar tips .",
    "they would obviously produce the two peak feature in the left panel of figure [ vlos - peak ] , as was e.g. discussed by @xcite .",
    "we overplot in green one such orbit extracted from the simulation which alternately contributes to both peaks .",
    "however , as we will show below , the high @xmath1 features in our simulation are made up of a more complicated population of orbits from different orbit families .",
    "+      to get a better understanding for the orbits that contribute to the peak , we track all orbits that contribute to the high @xmath1 peak at @xmath160 and @xmath137 degrees at 7.30 - 7.35 gyr defined by @xmath192 for young stars with ages @xmath140 gyr and radii @xmath133 .",
    "if an orbit is similar to a closed orbit , we will expect it to return to the same region in phase space periodically .",
    "our selection of sightline plus @xmath1 range can be seen as a rough proxy for a phase space region .",
    "considering that the bar grows and the potential changes , a more sophisticated definition is complicated .",
    "therefore we record the time interval needed by an orbit to return to the sightline and @xmath1 window .",
    "the histogram for the first return time @xmath194 is plotted in the panel a of figure [ hist ] .",
    "we see that this distribution shows three distinct peaks at circa 110 ( red ) , 190 ( green ) and 280 myr ( blue ) , which contain approx .",
    "23 , 13 and 28 per cent of the stars .",
    "there are also two broader peaks at 450 - 650 myr ( 14 per cent , purple ) and 650 - 800 myr ( 7 per cent , orange ) .",
    "note that @xmath77 13 per cent of orbits never return or have return times @xmath195 myr .",
    "were all these orbits simple @xmath7 orbits , we would expect a simpler structure .    in panels",
    "b - f of figure [ hist ] , we look at histograms of the second return time @xmath196 for stars selected to have first return times @xmath194 in the five peaks found in the @xmath194 histogram . to some degree , all these @xmath196 histogram resemble the @xmath194 histogram , as they reproduce one to three of the previously found three narrow peaks . above 450 myr , the @xmath196 histograms all seem dominated by noise , but all of them contain a similar fraction of such orbits , varying between 25 and 31 per cent .",
    "a first clear conclusion is , that for each histogram , the fraction of orbits that remain in the same return time peak is below 50 per cent .",
    "this shows that most orbits do not show a steady periodicity in our definition , but rather combine a low number of possible return times .    to connect the shape of these histograms to types of orbits , we extracted random sets of orbits with similar combinations of return times @xmath194 and @xmath196 , for example contributors to the green peak for @xmath194 and to the blue peak for @xmath196 .",
    "in addition we extracted a set of orbits that do not contribute to return time peaks .",
    "from these we select by eye 42 typical orbits .",
    "they are shown in figure [ orbits ] .",
    "note that due to different prominence of the peaks this figure does not represent orbit types at their underlying contribution fractions .",
    "the stars with shortest return times @xmath194 ( red peak ) show a high fraction ( 45 per cent ) of stars with @xmath197 .",
    "additionally , 30 per cent of the stars have @xmath196 in the area of the green or blue peak , but these peaks are not separately visible .",
    "the first row of figure [ orbits ] reveals that these stars are essentially all on @xmath7 like orbits .",
    "if they have @xmath198 , it is mostly because the orbits are not exactly closed .",
    "they can miss the high @xmath1 window as their directions of motion and velocity vary when they cross the sightline . moreover , @xmath0-body noise can cause the integrals of motion of the particles to fluctuate .    stars from the second ( green ) @xmath194 peak show three @xmath196 peaks at the locations of the three narrow @xmath194 peaks which are equally populated ( @xmath199 per cent each ) .",
    "most stars are again on @xmath7-like orbits , but there are also the first objects from more complex closed orbit families with pretzel - like structures @xcite , such as the 202 - 213 or 216 - 229 objects . at higher return times ,",
    "@xmath7 orbits are a minority .",
    "if they have such return long return times , it is because they miss @xmath1 due to the fluctuations mentioned above more often than not , e.g. because they have lower energies and only in exceptional cases reach high enough @xmath1 .",
    "pretzel - like morphologies are the most frequent pattern found at longer return times . for blue @xmath194 stars ,",
    "there is again a high fraction ( 46 per cent ) of @xmath197 stars , which tend to shows such patterns , as seen in the fourth row of figure [ orbits ] .",
    "generally , the structures become more complicated and more irregular as @xmath194 increases .",
    "clearly some orbits show 3:1 characteristics with a changing orientation ( objects 421 - 402 or 506 - 862 ) , but there are also more complicated , but apparently regular structures , such as the object 273 - 176 , which was labelled q in @xcite , and objects like 176 - 324 or 424 - 103 which also combine 3:1 and @xmath7 features .",
    "other orbits appear to change structure with time , an indication of chaotic behaviour .",
    "if we combine the results from above , we estimate that the fraction of stars in the high @xmath1 peak that are on @xmath7 orbits at the given time is between 40 and 50 per cent .",
    "if we determined the full population of stars , which over a longer timescale ( @xmath200 gyr ) periodically contributed to the high @xmath1 peak , the fraction of @xmath7 stars would be even lower , as they have the shortest return times .",
    "this invalidates the original assumption of @xcite that the high @xmath1 feature is only caused by 2:1 orbits .",
    "there are other major contributors , most prominently the pretzel - like orbits , but also 3:1 or more complex orbits .",
    "we note that @xcite have recently updated their paper in response to our work and now also find that higher order orbit families ( they name 3:1 and 5:2 ) can make significant contributions to the high @xmath1 features .",
    "we note that we have attempted to analyse the vertical structure of orbits in connection to the in - plane one and experimented with frequency analysis , but concluded that the results were to diverse or noisy to help with the understanding of the high @xmath1 features .      .",
    "we exclude orbits that never return to the high @xmath1 window or have very long return times @xmath201 0.8 gyr .",
    "we record each passage of the sightline @xmath160 degrees ( total number @xmath202 ) and each contribution to the high @xmath1 peak @xmath192 ) during such a passage ( total number @xmath203 ) .",
    "we plot the fraction @xmath204 .",
    ", title=\"fig:\",width=302 ] +    in our discussion of figure [ hist ] , we already noted that around 10 per cent of stars which contribute to the high @xmath1 peak at a given time and sightline , need 1 gyr or longer to achieve this again .",
    "the @xmath196 histograms have also shown that @xmath7725 per cent of stars that initially had return times @xmath205 myr need more than 500 myr to return again .",
    "so orbit populations slowly change in a way that reduces the proportion of their time during which they contribute to the high @xmath1 peak .    to understand why the high @xmath1 peak vanishes with age , we conducted the following exercise : we tracked all orbits from the histogram in panel a of figure [ hist ] .",
    "as the orbits that never return or have very long return times ( defined as @xmath206 0.8 gyr ) are likely random contributors , we exclude them .",
    "we record each passage of the sightline ( total number @xmath202 ) and if during this passage the orbit contributes to the high @xmath1 peak ( total number @xmath203 ) .",
    "the fraction @xmath207 gives a measure of how much the population of orbits is contributing to the peak at time @xmath208 .",
    "a priori one would expect a ratio @xmath209 for @xmath7 orbits as they are approximately axisymmetric along the bar passing once through the sightline while approaching and once while moving away and contributing to the high @xmath1 peak .",
    "consequently , smaller values for @xmath210 are expected for more complex orbits .",
    "this is slightly complicated by the geometry and the slower absolute velocity of stars while approaching : the front side of the bar is geometrically disfavoured , as the pencil beam covers a larger area at the rear side . on the other hand ,",
    "the approaching stars are closer to the tip and hence slower , taking more weight in the observations .",
    "moreover , it is also possible that stars moving along the rear side have high enough @xmath1 only for a fraction of the time they spend in the sightline .",
    "if we select @xmath7 orbits which at every second crossing of the sightline contribute to the high @xmath1 peak , we empirically find a mean value of @xmath211 , close to the simple estimate .",
    "+    from the return time analysis shown above , we would expect @xmath212 , as most orbits exhibit a more complex behaviour .",
    "@xmath213 is shown in figure [ frac ] .",
    "initially , @xmath210 fluctuates periodically .",
    "this can be understood as most orbits return to the high @xmath1 peak after specific characteristic times ( see figure [ hist ] ) and they have been selected at correlated phases . the average value of @xmath210 over the covered 2 gyr drops from @xmath214 to @xmath215 .",
    "this shows that the fraction of orbits contributing to the high @xmath1 peak continuously decreases .",
    "most of this decrease is caused by diffusion of stars away from the contributing orbits , but it is not clear , if our simulation handles this diffusion correctly .",
    "sources for this diffusion are chaotic orbit behaviour , two - body noise and fluctuations in bar parameters .",
    "our resolution is likely not sufficient to cover chaotic orbital behaviour correctly .",
    "for the two - body noise , it is unknown if the level of @xmath0-body noise is realistic compared to the mw ( bearing e.g. giant molecular clouds near the bar tips , and dark matter substructure ) . in addition , our simulation will not have sources for bar fluctuations like tidal torques exerted by satellites .",
    "the important point to take away is that the vanishing of the high @xmath1 peak in older stars is not only due to the broadening of the main peak , but also due to active loss of stars from high @xmath1 orbits .      by design , new - born star particles in our simulation",
    "are released on near circular orbits , where the circular speed was determined to balance the local radial component of the gravitational force .",
    "obviously , the young stars contributing to the high @xmath1 peak discussed above are not on circular orbits .",
    "just as obviously , there are no stable circular orbits near the bar .",
    "this is why we set an inner radius limit for new born stars , so that no new star particles are inserted within the main bar region .",
    "this cutoff is , of course , to some degree arbitrary and young stars born close to the bar can be captured by the bar , resulting in the young bar populations studied in the previous sections .",
    "bars in real galaxies can also grow by capturing stars and thus changing their orbits .",
    "so the young stars that end up in the high @xmath1 peak are predominantly the result of continuous bar growth .    in figure",
    "[ capture ] , we show six stars that at 8.3 gyr contribute to the high @xmath216 feature and were born within 1 gyr before that time .",
    "we find that the shortest time it takes to appear in the high @xmath1 peak is similar to the shortest return time peak , 110 myr .",
    "the capture times are rather equally distributed between this lower limit and the maximum 1 gyr due to the selection criteria .",
    "the shown star particles were selected at different _ capture time _ intervals .",
    "they start out on non - bar orbits and at some point transition to @xmath7-like or pretzel - like orbits .",
    "clearly stars that end up in the high @xmath1 features are born at radii that correspond to the tip of the bar , so they belong to the innermost inserted particles . to visualise this point , we plot in figure [ radbirth ] the distribution of birth radii @xmath217 of high @xmath1 stars . for this figure we select stars which were born after 7.3 gyr and contribute to the high @xmath1 feature at @xmath158 degrees at 8.3 - 8.5 gyr and/or at 9.3 - 9.5 gyr .",

    "we notice that the majority of stars is born just outside the bar at @xmath219 .",
    "as seen in figure [ bar - evo ] the bar radius fluctuates mildly , which allows smaller birth radii .",
    "the subsample of stars which were born at later times has its lower cutoff slightly further out due to the continuing growth of the bar .",
    "the outer tail is wider for older stars , indicating that stars which are older at capture can have larger birth radii .",

    "the histogram of stars born after 8.5 gyr and contributing at 9.3 - 9.5 gyr is shown in red .",
    "the vertical dashed lines mark the positions of the inner 4:1 ( ultra - harmonic ) resonance at 7.3 and 9.3 gyr .",
    ", title=\"fig:\",width=302 ] +    resonances can play a role in capturing orbits ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the corotation resonance of our bar at the analysed time intervals is at @xmath220 , but no stars from these regions are captured .",
    "we find that the ultra - harmonic resonance ( uhr ) , @xmath221 , in our model lies just outside the bar .",
    "this is likely not coincidental , as the uhr can limit the radial extent of stable @xmath7 orbits and thus the size of the bar @xcite .",
    "the resonance may play a role in shaping the spatial distribution from which stars are captured by the bar , as while the bar grows , the resonance moves outwards , and stars on orbits just outside the bar get scattered , absorbed or released by it .",
    "these processes can transport orbits to the regions of phase space occupied by high velocity bar orbits .",
    "however , the exact role of the resonance in the capture process is unknown , as the bar is strong , evolving and the potential is not smooth .",
    "the capture of orbits can be understood in simpler terms ( similar to @xcite ) , in that stars come in at the right angle to the bar to lose angular momentum and get trapped .",
    "a detailed study of capture processes is beyond the scope of this work .",
    "capture of stars onto these orbits along the bar is mostly drawn from kinematically cool populations that are close to the galactic plane , which have a small random energy compared to the potential disturbance and are at low altitude , where the disturbance is strongest .",
    "while these stars drastically change the in - plane geometry of their orbits during capture by the bar , their vertical energy and hence scale height remain small .",
    "consistently , both the mw and our simulation display a discernible high @xmath1 feature only at observed latitudes @xmath222 degrees .",
    "above , we have learned that for populations of stars which at a given time contribute to the high @xmath1 feature , the contribution fraction slowly declines with time .",
    "as the simulation evolves , the high @xmath1 feature , however , remains detectable .",
    "this is because of ongoing star formation close to the bar region and the continuous capture of young stars on @xmath7-like or pretzel - like orbits .",
    "the young populations on such orbits then slowly evolve towards more complex orbit populations with a decreasing fraction of high @xmath1 stars .",
    "we note that another process which could produce young stars on high @xmath1 orbits is not included in our model : in real galaxies , molecular clouds can exist on bar orbits @xcite .",
    "stars born in these clouds would make up kinematically cool populations born directly on high velocity bar orbits and could thus contribute to the high @xmath1 features .",
    "in this paper , we have studied how an @xmath0-body+sph model of a growing milky way ( mw ) like barred disc galaxy compares to the mw in terms of line of sight velocities @xmath1 of stars seen from the earth and in the direction of the bar .",
    "the model uses an approach that has not yet been used in this context .",
    "we start with a light ( one tenth of the final mass ) and short scale - length disc of gas and stars in equilibrium within a live dark halo . this disc is grown by continuously adding star and gas particles on near circular orbits in a controlled way .",
    "the mass and size growth histories are matched to expectations for the mw , and indeed at simulation time 7 - 10 gyr the simulated bar is similar in structure to the mw bar .",
    "our simple prescription for the evolution of the galaxy in our @xmath0-body simulation lowers the computational cost and also circumvents the uncertainties in the parametrisation of sub - grid model approaches to star formation and stellar feedback .",
    "the general dynamics of gas and stars are expected to be reasonably represented , but we do not cover varying gas fractions , supernova induced turbulence and effects of multiple gas phases",
    ". the simulation does not produce any sensible interplay between gas and stars : there is e.g. no enhanced star formation at places with high gas densities .",
    "external galaxies show indications for star formation associated with the gas flows along the edges of a bar ( the equivalent of the mw s @xmath223 arms ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which depend strongly on the dynamical state of the bar ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . however , these processes are not covered in our simulation . on the positive side",
    ", our approach allows us to set a reasonable star formation history , to keep spurious sources of heating under control , and hence to observe the dynamical effects of bar formation with less scatter .",
    "we use this simulation to interpret line of sight velocity ( @xmath1 ) data for the central and inner disc regions of the mw from the apogee survey . to enable a robust comparison",
    ", we apply a simple population synthesis to model the apogee selection function . apart from minor discrepancies at a minority of sightlines , the model fits the data surprisingly well without any scaling or adjustment .",
    "the simulation not only reproduces the positions and dispersions of the main peaks in the @xmath1 distributions at each sightline , but also displays the high @xmath1 features found by @xcite within the central bar region .",
    "our simulation clearly identifies these high @xmath1 features with stars travelling near the plane alongside the bar . by showing that these are kinematically cool features with preferentially young stars in the plane ,",
    "we naturally explain why the high @xmath1 structure was seen by @xcite and @xcite in observation fields at @xmath224 , but is absent in the higher - latitude fields studied by @xcite . by the strong preference of the apogee selection function for young stars ,",
    "the high @xmath1 features get additionally enhanced and have comparable strength and shape in our simulation and the apogee observations .",
    "we also determine at which velocities low @xmath1 peaks at negative @xmath3 , produced by stars moving towards the sun along the front side of the bar , should be visible .",
    "so far , only hints of these features have been seen by @xcite .",
    "we show that , unlike for the high @xmath167 features , the position and width of the main peaks of the @xmath1 distributions are dominated by fore- and background stars , which are not associated with the bar .",
    "we also study a variation of our parameters , in particular the bar angle @xmath24 .",
    "other than @xcite we feel unable to put strong constraints on the observed bar angle : while large @xmath225 are clearly disfavoured as the majority of high velocity stars get a too large projection angle with the line of sight , no reliable constraint can be found for smaller values of @xmath24 , since change in velocities is degenerate with our general uncertainty about the bar length , pattern speed and strength . additionally , we show that the high @xmath1 feature is detectable at simulation times between 7 and 10 gyr and is thus not connected to specific events",
    ". the feature changes mildly over this period due to a growth of the bar in length and mass , but the change is too small to allow any conclusions about the properties of the mw bar .",
    "we note that on two sightlines , namely @xmath226 and @xmath227 degrees , the simulation shows a mild difference to the observations , missing the tentative high @xmath1 peak at @xmath226 and predicting the main peak of the velocity distribution at too high velocities at both sightlines .",
    "possible origins for the discrepancies are a longer bar length for the mw or the @xmath228 molecular ring in the mw .",
    "a decisive answer on this question would require detailed analytical models that can cover the full space of possible parameters .",
    "a detailed analysis of the stars participating in the high @xmath1 features in our model reveals that ( contrary to the original view of * ? ? ?",
    "* ) only about half of the contribution is made by stars on @xmath7 orbits , with additional large contributions from pretzel type @xcite and more complicated orbits .",
    "this finding results from a detailed study of these orbits guided by return times into the high velocity peak at the sightline @xmath229 degrees .",
    "the return times display several peaks that are associated with the different orbit families ( and some scatter by stars missing the observation window ) and help with the quantification of the contribution of different orbit families .",
    "we note that , in response to our work , @xcite have updated their paper and now also conclude that higher order orbit families ( they name 3:1 and 5:2 ) can make significant contributions to the high @xmath1 features .",
    "another interesting statistic is the ratio of the number stars in the high @xmath1 region of a certain sightline divided by all stars passing through the sightline at arbitrary @xmath1 values for all stars that have been observed once in the high velocity peak . while we find that @xmath7 orbits with stable short return times show an average ratio of @xmath211 , the stars in the simulation start with a ratio of @xmath230 , as a consequence of the significant contribution of more complex orbits to the velocity peak .    within @xmath231 gyr of the initial detection , this ratio drops steadily down to @xmath232 .",
    "due to changes in the bar potential , length , and pattern speed , as well as orbital diffusion , stars diffuse out of these orbit families weakening the high @xmath1 peak . however , the high @xmath1 feature in our simulation persists , as the growing bar captures new stars from the surrounding disc .",
    "it is unclear , how realistically our model represents the precise balance of orbit capture and diffusion , which is determined by chaotic diffusion , two - body interactions and fluctuations in bar parameters .",
    "in addition , observations of enhanced star formation at the bar tips and on bar orbits along the leading bar edges ( see above ) , imply a source of young stars on high velocity bar orbits , which is not mirrored by our model .",
    "overall , our result provides an indication for the recent growth of the galactic bar .",
    "quantitative constraints on the bar dynamics and history would demand further exploration of model parameters and also a detailed age and distance tomography of the observed high @xmath1 stars .",
    "we note that our bar is a slow bar with @xmath130 in a disc with a high dark matter contribution to the circular velocity curve .",
    "as discussed in section 4 , observations",
    "do not constrain the pattern speed and the length of the mw bar well and we currently can exclude neither a slow bar as ours nor a fast bar with @xmath233 .",
    "as far as the dark matter fraction is concerned , our disc agrees with recent estimates on the local circular velocity in the mw and the corresponding dm contribution .",
    "further work is necessary to understand how faster bars and/or lower dark matter fractions would alter the processes discussed in this paper .",
    "@xcite point out that a nuclear stellar disc with a radial extent of @xmath234 could explain high velocity features at @xmath235 degrees .",
    "although this idea is interesting , they do not currently have a model which can explain the velocity distributions at the full apogee range of bar longitudes , as our model can .",
    "the simulations of @xcite advocate against such a giant @xmath236 disc for the current mw centre , but the extent of such a disc may have varied over time . to safely determine whether this idea can explain the data , a model , which self - consistently predicts velocity distributions at longitudes @xmath237 degrees would be needed",
    ". a higher number of observed stars in this region with reasonable measurements of distances , ages and metallicities would certainly help to ( in)validate our model or other attempts to explain the observed velocity distributions .",
    "as far as the nuclear stellar disc in the mw is concerned , its existence so far has only reliably been detected in the central @xmath238 @xcite and the short scalelength inferred for this structure currently seems to disfavour a large nuclear disc as proposed by @xcite .    to summarise , we have shown that the high @xmath1 features seen towards the bar in apogee are likely due to preferentially young stars on orbits moving along the major axis of the bar .",
    "they move close to the plane , which is why the feature disappears at high latitudes .",
    "the most important orbit family contributing to the feature are @xmath7 orbits , but a variety of more complex orbits also make significant contributions . despite its simplicity , our model is the first shown to match the detailed kinematics in the bar region , and hence its late stages can serve as a blueprint for further and more detailed studies .",
    "it is a pleasure to thank james binney for helpful discussions and comments on the manuscript .",
    "we are grateful to mattia sormani and evgeny vasilyev for helpful comments .",
