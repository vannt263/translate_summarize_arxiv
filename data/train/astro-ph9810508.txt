    "the shape of a star cluster s initial mass function ( imf ) at and below the hydrogen burning limit can yield important information about the star formation process as well as the relative importance of brown dwarfs in a localized region of the galaxy .",
    "it is becoming evident that in most clusters , the imf below 0.3 m@xmath3 is approximately flat in logarithmic mass units and that the total cluster mass is not dominated by the lowest mass members ( see luhman 1998 and references therein ) . yet",
    "the detailed shape of the imf in clusters below 0.3 m@xmath3 is poorly defined ( see scalo 1998 for review ) . to constrain the slope of a cluster imf in this mass range ,",
    "it will be necessary to identify significant numbers of brown dwarfs .",
    "this is most easily accomplished in young clusters since low mass objects are most luminous in their youth . as demonstrated in models by burrows ( 1997 ) ,",
    "deuterium burning stabilizes the luminosity of a contracting brown dwarf such that its luminosity at 10@xmath4 years is about 3 orders of magnitude greater than at 10@xmath5 years .",
    "recent visible wavelength studies of the orion nebula cluster ( onc , hillenbrand 1997 ) and the taurus molecular cloud ( briceo 1998 ) have indeed been successful in detecting several young , substellar mass objects .",
    "but due to their cool effective temperatures ( @xmath63000 k ) and the large columns of dust in regions of star formation , young brown dwarfs are most easily observed at near - infrared wavelengths .",
    "models predict that in the closest star - forming regions ( d@xmath7150 pc ) , pre - main sequence ( pms ) stars of age 10@xmath4 years at the hydrogen - burning limit will have apparent magnitudes of k ( 2.2 @xmath2m)=15.5@xmath8 when viewed through a@xmath9=50@xmath8 and will be easily detectable in deep ground - based near - ir surveys .",
    "the @xmath0 ophiuchi molecular cloud lies in the upper scorpius subgroup of the sco - cen ob association . at a distance of only 150 pc ( de zeeuw 1997 )",
    ", it is an ideal area to search for young brown dwarfs .",
    "it is the highest stellar density region of low mass star formation among clouds within 200 pc of the sun .",
    "it hosts over 100 young stellar objects ( ysos ) in its 1 pc @xmath10 2 pc centrally condensed core ( grasdalen , strom , & strom 1973 ; vrba 1975 ; wilking & lada 1983 ; greene & young 1992 ; comern 1993 ; strom , kepner & strom 1995 ) .",
    "the central regions of the core , with a@xmath9 estimated to be 50@xmath8100@xmath8 , provide an effective screen of background stars even at infrared wavelengths .",
    "the pms stars in the core have an estimated age of @xmath610@xmath4 years ( greene & meyer 1995 ) and theoretical models predict that brown dwarfs of this age and distance will be easily detected at near - infrared wavelengths over a broad range of masses .",
    "previous infrared studies in the @xmath0 oph core have used broadband photometry to estimate masses of ysos and identify substellar candidates ( e.g. , rieke & rieke 1990 ; comern 1993 ; strom , kepner & strom ; williams 1995 ; comern , rieke & rieke 1998 ) .",
    "comern and collaborators have gone a step farther and derived an imf for this cluster which is relatively flat down to to 0.05 m@xmath3 ( comern , rieke , & rieke 1996 ) .",
    "yet this result depends on large completeness corrections at the lowest masses and , in most cases , the mass estimates have not been confirmed by spectroscopy . using optical spectroscopy , luhman ( 1997 ) have confirmed one of the candidates , 162349.8 - 242601 , as a brown dwarf with a mass of 0.010.06 m@xmath3 .    in this contribution",

    "section 3 introduces a new technique , calibrated with a grid of m dwarf standards , that uses water vapor absorption bands in the infrared spectra to derive spectral types . as a result",
    ", 15 brown dwarf candidates are assigned late - type spectral classifications , with ten objects classified as m6 or later .",
    "the spectral classification for one pms star is confirmed through optical spectroscopy .",
    "given their spectral types , the effective temperatures and bolometric luminosities of the brown dwarf candidates are estimated in section 4 . using a hertzsprung - russell diagram and two sets of pre - main - sequence tracks , we find that 6 candidates clearly fall in the brown dwarf regime and 5 candidates lie in the stellar / substellar transition region .",

    "most of the 20 brown dwarf candidates in the core of the @xmath0 oph cloud observed spectroscopically were selected from the two - micron survey of comern ( 1993 ) .",
    "not only is the magnitude limit of their survey comparable to the detection limit for our spectroscopic observations ( k@xmath614.5@xmath8 ) , but they concentrated on the highest extinction region of the cloud core where a@xmath9=50100@xmath8 and contamination by background stars is minimal .",

    "observations were made using the facility infrared camera , nsfcam , in the k band with the hkl grism , a 0.3 arcsec pixel@xmath20 scale , and a 0.6  slit ( see shure 1994 and rayner 1998 for a description of the instrument and grism ) . the spectra cover the 2.02.5 @xmath2 m band and",

    "flat field exposures of the dome interior illuminated with incandescent lamps were taken at the beginning of each night .",
    "a typical set of observations consisted of the star observed at two positions along the slit , separated by 10 arcsec .",
    "typical exposure times for the brown dwarf candidates were 120180 seconds per slit position and limited by variations in the atmospheric oh emission .",
    "total on - source integration times were typically 2 minutes for the standard star observations ( but extended for 9 minutes for the m9 stars ) and 18 minutes for the brown dwarf candidates ( see table 1 ) . before extraction ,",

    "the airmass difference between the telluric standard and program star never exceeded 0.25 .",
    "no attempt was made to restore the true continuum shape of the program objects ; to recover the true shape one could multiply each spectrum by a blackbody corresponding to the effective temperature of the telluric standard .",
    "because of the steep response function of the grism , it was not possible to extrapolate over the br @xmath22 absorption line in the telluric standard and hence we were not sensitive to br @xmath22 emission in the program stars .",

    "image processing was accomplished by subtracting beam  switched pairs from each other to remove bias , dark current and sky emission .",
    "the subtracted frames were flat  fielded and corrected for grating efficiency using a set of calibration frames obtained with a featureless quartz lamp .",
    "wavelength calibration was achieved with a comparison spectrum taken with a henear lamp .",
    "the individual spectra were then extracted and the local sky level was re  calculated using apertures adjacent to that containing the source spectrum .",
    "the four spectra were median filtered , and the resultant spectrum was smoothed with a gaussian of half - width @xmath25 for comparison with the library of spectral standards from kirkpatrick , henry , & mccarthy ( 1991 ) .",
    "infrared spectra of 13 standard stars , ranging in spectral type from k5v to m9v , are shown in fig .",

    "ascii data files of the 14 standard star spectra and a table of the observational details are electronically available upon request .      at this low spectral resolution , there are no absorption lines present in our spectra that can be reliably used to derive spectral types .",
    "however , the depths of the broad water vapor absorption bands are extremely sensitive to spectral type for m dwarfs .",
    "we have derived a quantitative index that measures these depths which is independent of reddening .",
    "this index is analogous to the q index derived from ubv photometry which is used to determine spectral types for visible stars ( e.g. , johnson & morgan 1953 ) . using the average values of relative flux density calculated in three narrow bands , f1 ( 2.072.13 @xmath2 m ) , f2 ( 2.2672.285 @xmath2 m ) , and f3 ( 2.402.50 @xmath2 m )",

    "the error bars in the q values are calculated from the statistical errors in the average flux values of f1 , f2 , and f3 .",
    "the plot shows that q appears to be linear from spectral type m0 to m8 but may start to flatten by m9 .",
    "a weighted linear least squares fit to the m standard star data ( excluding the k5v star gl  775 and @xmath19m9.5v star bri 0021 - 0214 ) data yields the following relation : @xmath32 with a correlation coefficient of r=0.98 .",
    "we expect that this relation can not be used for spectral classification of objects with very strong co bands , such as those found in late - type giants , as the higher vibrational first overtone bands become evident in the 2.4 - 2.5 @xmath2 m region .",
    "the application of this relation to spectral classifications of the brown dwarf candidate spectra is discussed in the following section .",

    "gy  30 displayed a featureless spectrum and wl  18 has br@xmath22 emission in an otherwise featureless spectrum ( see also greene & lada 1996 ) .",
    "the s / n in the spectrum for gy  218 ( k=14.4 ) was insufficient to attempt any classification .",
    "finally upon further analysis , two objects ( crbr  1 and 2316.6 - 2131 ) showed br@xmath22 absorption characteristic of stars of spectral type earlier than g0 . these objects are discussed in sec .",
    "3.3.3 .",
    "fifteen of the @xmath0 oph objects have spectra displaying absorption by co , na  i , ca  i , and h@xmath27o as expected from late  type photospheres . their composite co equivalent widths ( sum of @xmath33=0 - 2 and 2 - 4 ) range from @xmath196.5 @xmath23 ( gy  59 ) to @xmath1925 @xmath23 ( gy  107 ) with a median value of 12.5 @xmath23 . with the possible exception of gy  107 , these equivalent widths are consistent with those observed in m dwarf stars",
    ". however , they are inconsistent with co equivalent widths expected in m giants with strong water vapor absorption bands ( e.g. , fig .",
    "7 of greene & lada 1996 ) .",
    "co band absorption in the 2.42.5 @xmath2 m region is present in gy  107 , and may cause the q index and the photospheric temperature to be underestimated . for most sources in our sample , which appear to be late - type dwarfs ,",
    "the co absorption from 2.42.5 @xmath2 m has a negligible effect on the water - vapor index .",
    "thus we conclude that most of the 15 objects in our sample are candidate very low mass stars and that our dwarf star calibration of the q index introduced above is appropriate for estimating their spectral types .",
    "we assume that the observed absorption features arise from some combination of a yso photosphere plus possible contribution from continuum dust emission and not from a disk photosphere .",
    "while optically  thick continuum dust emission is commonly observed toward actively accreting t tauri stars ( strom 1989 ; beckwith 1990 ) , optically ",
    "thick gas emission is thought to dominate near  ir emission only for objects with very high disk accretion rates such as the fu ori class of eruptive variables ( kenyon & hartmann 1996 ) .",
    "comparison of the co equivalent widths for our candidate brown dwarfs with the sample of fu ori stars studied by greene & lada ( 1996 ) at low resolution suggests that none of our objects belong to this rare class of objects .",
    "however , water vapor absorption can also arise in circumstellar disks surrounding less extreme pms stars under certain conditions according to the models of calvet ( 1992 ) .",
    "features due to water vapor can contribute as much as 10% of the observed flux for accretion rates 10@xmath34 m@xmath35 yr@xmath20 only if the circumstellar disk extends all the way into the stellar surface . at an accretion rate of 10@xmath36 m@xmath35 yr@xmath20 ,",
    "water vapor becomes significant only for disks that extend to within 2 r@xmath37 .",
    "note that these calculations assume a central stellar temperature of 4000 k. a cooler central star will have a colder disk , making it less likely that inner disk will reach temperatures where gas opacity is dominant ( @xmath19 1000 k ) . whether it is because disk accretion rates are typically @xmath38 yr@xmath20 ( hartmann 1998 ) , or inner disks have inner holes @xmath39 ( meyer 1997 )",
    ", it appears that the near - ir spectra of most ysos are dominated by star+continuum dust emission rather than disk photospheres ( casali & eiroa 1996 ; greene & lada 1997 ) .    we have computed the reddening - independent water vapor index q for each object in our sample using eqn .",

    "we compared our optical spectrum of gy  5 with dwarf and giant star standards of kirkpatrick ( 1991 ) .",
    "based on the relative strength of surface gravity sensitive features ( e.g. , na  i at @xmath1 8183 @xmath23 ) , gy  5 appears to be intermediate between luminosity class iii and v as expected for a pms star sitting above the main sequence .",
    "similar behavior is reported by luhman ( 1997 ) for another brown dwarf candidate identified in the ophiuchus dark cloud and observed with the same instrument . however , based upon the behavior of molecular features such as tio and vo , gy  5 appears to be closer to the dwarf sequence . as shown in fig . 5",
    ", a comparison of our spectrum with the dwarf standards of kirkpatrick ( 1991 ) suggests a spectral type of m6@xmath401.0 for gy  5 .",
    "this agrees well with the spectral type derived above using the q index ( m7@xmath401.5 ) .",
    "we note the absence h@xmath41 in emission with the ew(h@xmath41)@xmath6 5  .      although the computed h@xmath27o index q is insensitive to reddening by interstellar extinction , other effects may cause variations in q between stellar standards and pms stars of identical spectral type .",
    "one major concern alluded to above is wavelength - dependent infrared excess due to thermal emission from warm dust grains in the circumstellar environments of the pms stars . a geometrically  thin , optically ",
    "thick circumstellar disk is expected to exhibit an ir spectral shape characterized by @xmath42 , whether heated via viscous accretion or passive reprocessing ( lynden - bell & pringle 1974 ; adams , lada , & shu 1987 ) .",
    "we adopted this function to simulate the spectrum of a circumstellar disk at each observed wavelength in our spectral bandpass .",
    "we divided the resulting spectrum by a t=9000 k planck function in order to process it comparably to the observed spectra which have been divided by the spectrum of a dwarf star ( usually near a0v ) for telluric correction .",
    "what is the magnitude of the effect of thermal emission by dust on spectral types derived using the water vapor index q ?",
    "k band excess emission can be characterized by @xmath43 , where @xmath44 is the broadband flux from excess ( circumstellar ) emission and @xmath45 is stellar flux at 2.2 @xmath2 m .",
    "meyer ( 1997 ) found that classical t tauri stars have a median value of @xmath46 , while weak - emission t tauri stars have a median value of @xmath47 . in order to simulate this range of excesses , we scaled a normalized disk spectrum to equal 0.2 and 0.6 times the flux of several standard star spectra at @xmath48 m .",
    "these scaled model disk spectra were then added to those of the standard stars , resulting in spectra which are representative of pms stars whose k band emissions arise from both stellar photospheres and disks .",
    "we then recomputed the q indices of these resultant spectra and found that q increased ( implying earlier spectral types ) over that of the same standards without this excess emission added . both the m6.5v ( gj  1111 ) and m9v ( lhs  2924 ) standards appeared to have q - derived spectral types 1 subclass earlier when @xmath49 disk spectra were added , and spectral types 3 subclasses earlier when @xmath50 disk spectra were added .",
    "we have estimated the minimum likely k band excess , @xmath51 , for each brown dwarf candidate from published near - infrared photometry and include these results in table 2 .",
    "these estimates are minima because our calculations assume that the candidates have no excesses in the @xmath52 or @xmath53 bands .",
    "the k excess is estimated from @xmath54 , where @xmath55 ( e.g. , meyer ) .",
    "the value of @xmath51 is less than 0.3 for all sources except for crbr  15 , gy  11 , gy  64 , and gy  202 , which have values similar to those of classical t tauri stars .",
    "thus the q - derived spectral types of most brown dwarf candidates in the sample should be unaffected by emission from circumstellar dust , but crbr  15 , gy  11 , gy  64 , and gy  202 may have actual spectral types which are 23 subclasses later than those presented in table 2 .",
    "we have compared the spectra of our brown dwarf candidates to a sequence of dwarf standards rather than giants . yet",
    "surface gravities for pms stars are known to be intermediate between those of dwarfs and giants ( e.g. , schiavon , batalha , & barbury 1995 ) .",
    "spectroscopic studies indicate that the surface gravities of pms stars are most similar to those of main sequence dwarfs ( basri & batalha 1990 ; greene & lada 1997 ) .",
    "this is consistent with our analysis of the composite co equivalent widths in our sample and the gy  5 spectrum .",
    "if the brown dwarf candidates have surface gravities of subgiants , how would this effect our derived spectral types ?",
    "absorption in the 1.9 @xmath2 m water vapor band is generally weaker in late - type giants than in dwarf stars of the same spectral type ( e.g. , aaronson , frogel , & persson 1978 , kleinmann & hall 1986 ) . only for the latest spectral types ( @xmath19m6 )",
    "is the water band similar in depth for dwarfs and giants .",
    "hence , we may have systematically classified stars 12 subclasses earlier than appropriate for stars @xmath6m6 by assuming dwarf rather than subgiant surface gravities .",
    "classifications of stars m6 or later appear to be nearly independent of surface gravity .",
    "higher resolution data , obtainable with the next generation of 810 m class telescopes , are required in order to perform a detailed analysis of the surface gravities of very low mass pms objects .",

    "the masses and ages derived for our brown dwarf candidates from both models are presented in table 3 . regardless of choice of tracks",

    "in addition , the brown dwarf candidates crbr  15 , gy  5 , gy  37 , gy  59 , and gy  84 lie in the transition region between stellar and substellar objects and we can not rule out that some are brown dwarfs .",
    "again , masses derived from pms models require independent confirmation by studies of pms binary stars ( ghez 1995 ) or other techniques ( bonnell 1998 ) .",
    "the range of masses derived from both sets of tracks considered here gives some indication of the uncertainties in the mass estimates ( see table 3 ) .",
    "in the previous section , we demonstrated that six of our candidate objects appear to be brown dwarfs according to the pms tracks considered .",
    "an additional five stars in our sample lie at the stellar  substellar boundary at an age of @xmath67 yrs .",
    "what can we say about the nature of these very low mass objects ? by studying these and other recently discovered young brown dwarfs in more detail , we hope to learn whether very low mass stars are assembled in a similar fashion to higher mass stars .",
    "we conclude with a discussion of how purely photometric techniques compare with our mass estimates based on spectroscopy .",
    "do young brown dwarfs exhibit infrared excess emission characteristic of active accretion disks ?",
    "if pms stars of masses 0.51.0 m@xmath3 evolve from 0.1 m@xmath3 protostars with massive accretion disks , perhaps the lowest mass association members are those that form without significant disk accretion . in our sample ,",
    "crbr  15 , gy  11 , gy  64 , and gy  202 have obvious 2.2 @xmath2 m excesses ( lower limits are given in table 2 as r@xmath68 ) .",
    "this group includes three of our six probable brown dwarfs .",
    "these 2.2 @xmath2 m excesses are confirmed by combining near - infrared data and our effective temperature estimates with isocam observations in the thermal ir ( comern 1998 ) .",
    "in addition , an excess is suggested for crbr  14 at wavelengths beyond 5 @xmath2 m , indicating the presence of an inner hole in the circumstellar dust distribution .",
    "finally we note that the @xmath0 oph brown dwarf studied by luhman ( 1997 ) exhibits strong h@xmath41 emission as well as thermal ir excess emission , suggesting the presence of an accretion disk . in summary , indications are that brown dwarfs in the ophiuchus dark cloud can indeed possess active accretion disks analogous to those found around higher mass pms stars . using excess emission at @xmath1=2.2 @xmath2 m to identify circumstellar disks among members of the onc , hillenbrand et al .",
    "( 1998 ) find a lower disk frequency for the lowest mass cluster members ( m@xmath60.2 m@xmath3 ) ; a disk frequency of only 2050% is estimated for substellar objects compared to 5590% for the cluster as a whole .",
    "hillenbrand et al .",
    "forward several possible explanations for this lower frequency including smaller disk masses , lower disk accretion rates , and/or a higher incidence of disk stripping for the lowest mass cluster members . by identifying a statistically significant sample of brown dwarfs in the core of the rho oph cloud",
    ", this latter hypothesis can be tested in a cluster of approximately the same age as the onc .",
    "stellar encounters and the stripping of circumstellar disks would be less prevalent in the lower stellar density environment of the rho oph core whose stellar density is a factor of @xmath2850 times lower than the onc density of @xmath285 @xmath10 10@xmath69 pc@xmath70 .      even though spectroscopy affords the most reliable way to estimate effective temperatures of stars and young brown dwarfs , it has limitations .",
    "first , while optical spectroscopy provides the best studied sets of lines for spectral classification , the visual extinction in a star - forming cloud severely limits the number of young brown dwarfs that can be observed at @xmath71 in the r and i bands . among the 15 brown dwarf candidates in this study , only six ( with extinctions less than 13@xmath8 ) appear in an i band image of the cloud ( i@xmath619@xmath8 , wilking 1998 ) and are accessible targets for moderate resolution spectroscopy on a 4-m class telescope .",
    "second , even infrared spectroscopy is currently limited to low - luminosity objects near the surface of the cloud . in our study , the probable brown dwarfs range in extinction from 514@xmath8 while the total extinction in the core is estimated to be 50100@xmath8 .",
    "brown dwarfs throughout most of the cloud volume are below the detection limit even for low resolution infrared spectroscopy with a 34 m class telescope .    ultimately , any study of the mass functions of young clusters down to substellar masses will have to combine sensitive photometric surveys with spectroscopic data .",
    "the main disadvantage of analyzing photometric data alone is that mass and age can not be uniquely determined .",
    "typically one either assumes an input mass distribution and derives an age from fits to pms evolutionary tracks ( e.g. , lada & lada 1995 ) or one assumes an age distribution and derives the mass function ( e.g. , comern , rieke , & rieke 1996 ) .",
    "the addition of spectroscopic information permits one to construct an h ",
    "r diagram for some fraction of the photometric sample in order to estimate the age distribution of the cluster , crucial for adopting the appropriate mass  luminosity relationship ( e.g. , meyer 1996 ) . given this age distribution ,",
    "the derived distribution of stellar masses should reflect the cluster mass function for a large statistical sample .",
    "how do determinations of mass made with infrared spectra compare with those determined from infrared photometric data ?",
    "for example , the color - magnitude diagram in fig .",
    "1 based upon the dantona & mazzitelli models would predict that for an age of 3 @xmath10 10@xmath15 years , 15 of the 20 brown dwarf candidates ( 75% ) have masses @xmath720.1 m@xmath3 .",
    "using the infrared spectra and the same input models , we have determined that 11 of 14 ( 79% ) candidates have m@xmath720.1 m@xmath3 , with three of the brown dwarf candidates identified as possible background stars .",
    "one of the important advantages of infrared spectroscopy is the ability to reduce contamination of the sample by field stars .",
    "a recent photometric study by comern ( 1998 ) used model fits of the seds of ophiuchus brown dwarf candidates , extended to mid - infrared wavelengths by isocam data at @xmath1= 3.6 @xmath2 m , 4.5 @xmath2 m , and 6.0 @xmath2 m , to estimate effective temperatures .",
    "they utilized the burrows ( 1997 ) models to estimate mass assuming an age of either 10@xmath4 or 3 @xmath10 10@xmath4 years .",
    "the distribution of sources in our h ",

    "the temperatures derived by their sed models are systematically higher by several hundred k compared to those suggested from the infrared spectra , but usually within the stated uncertainty of our technique .",
    "notable exceptions include gy  10 and crbr  14 ; the photometric technique derives an effective temperature for gy  10 which is 700 k hotter than indicated from the near - infrared spectrum and 350 k hotter for crbr  14 .",
    "masses derived by the comern study are typically a factor of two greater than we derive from the same pms tracks ( burrows models ; see col .",
    "4 - 5 , table 3 ) with larger differences evident for crbr  14 , crbr  15 , and gy  10 . in the case of crbr  15",
    ", the higher mass derived by comern ( 0.23 m@xmath3 vs. @xmath60.09 m@xmath3 from this study ) arises from using a higher visual extinction than we estimate from the ( j - h ) color and spectral type .",
    "their model appears to overestimate the luminosity of the star while underestimating the contribution to the bolometric luminosity from infrared excess emission . in summary",
    ", our mass estimates usually agree within a factor of two of those derived by sed fitting , although they are systematically lower as expected given that the objects appear to be cooler and slightly younger than assumed by comern",

    "<S> we present an analysis of low resolution infrared spectra for 20 brown dwarf candidates in the core of the @xmath0 ophiuchi molecular cloud . </S>",
    "<S> fifteen of the sources display absorption - line spectra characteristic of late - type stars . by comparing the depths of water vapor absorption bands in our candidate objects with a grid of m dwarf standards </S>",
    "<S> , we derive spectral types which are independent of reddening . </S>",
    "<S> optical spectroscopy of one brown dwarf candidate confirms the spectral type derived from the water bands . combining their spectral types with published near - infrared photometry </S>",
    "<S> , effective temperatures and bolometric stellar luminosities are derived enabling us to place our sample on the hertzsprung - russell diagram . </S>",
    "<S> we compare the positions of the brown dwarf candidates in this diagram with two sets of theoretical models in order to estimate their masses and ages . </S>",
    "<S> considering uncertainties in placing the candidates in the h - r diagram , six objects consistently lie in the brown dwarf regime and another five objects lie in the transition region between stellar and substellar objects . </S>",
    "<S> the ages inferred for the sample are consistent with those derived for higher mass association members . </S>",
    "<S> three of the newly identified brown dwarfs display infrared excesses at @xmath1=2.2 @xmath2 m suggesting that young brown dwarfs can have active accretion disks . </S>",
    "<S> comparing our mass estimates of the brown dwarf candidates with those derived from photometric data alone suggests that spectroscopy is an essential component of investigations of the mass functions of young clusters .    </S>",
