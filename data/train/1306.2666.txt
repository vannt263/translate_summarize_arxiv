    "we focus on the anisotropic heisenberg ( xxz ) chain , and examine structures that appear in the spectra due to the presence of open boundary conditions ( edges ) , in particular those eigenstates whose spatial forms are dictated by the edge . in these eigenstates , one or more `` particles '' ( overturned spins ) are localized or locked at the edges . in the sectors we look at ( one or two particles ) , most of these features are physically simple and show up as prominent band structures in the spectrum , as we show below in figure [ fig_spectra_periodic_vs_open ] . however , a bethe ansatz description has been lacking in the literature to the best of our knowledge , despite the relevant bethe equations having been available since the work of refs .",

    "the energy splitting within the doublet vanishes exponentially with the system size . in the @xmath16 case , these are eigenstates where the two particles are localized on the same edge .",
    "a third fully edge - locked state has one particle localized at each edge ; this state is not spectrally separated but has an intriguingly simple structure ( section [ edge_eig_2p ] ) .    in this work",
    "we throughly characterize the natures of the eigenstates in the bethe ansatz language , by providing the numbers of different classes of eigenstates at different @xmath0 values , the locations of the exceptional points @xmath23 , analytic expressions for the bethe momenta at large @xmath0 and large @xmath5 and in the vicinity of the exceptional points , etc .",
    "the values of the exceptional points are described by a set of two coupled equations that we provide explicitly .",
    "an intriguing feature is that in the limit @xmath24 all the exceptional points coalesce at the isotropic point @xmath3 , signaling that edge - locked particles become stable in the whole region @xmath19 .",
    "finally , we discuss @xmath16 eigenstates where the particles are extended but mutually bound , which correspond to complex conjugate pairs of bethe momenta , and are closely analogous to `` 2-strings '' well - known from the periodic chain .",

    "we presented a complete classification of all the possible solutions of the bethe equations in the whole region @xmath113 .",
    "edge - locked eigenstates are those in which one or more of the particles are exponentially localized at the edges of the chain . in all sectors ( e.g. , the @xmath18 and @xmath16 sectors we have detailed ) , there are two eigenstates where the particles are all localized at the left or at the right edge . in addition , for @xmath393 we can have some particles localized at the left edge and some localized at the right edge . these fully edge - locked eigenstates are all associated with pure imaginary solutions of the bethe equations .",
    "in contrast , real solutions of the bethe equations reflect extended ( i.e.  `` magnon''-like ) behavior . for @xmath393",

    "one of the two imaginary solutions becomes real at @xmath394 , so that we are left with a single imaginary solution , i.e. , a single edge - locked eigenstate , at @xmath395 . for @xmath16 , we have transitions from \\{im , im } to \\{re , im } , or from \\{re , im } to \\{re , re } , as @xmath0 is lowered .",
    "this corresponds to some of edge - locked particles getting delocalized and becoming extended in the bulk of the chain .",
