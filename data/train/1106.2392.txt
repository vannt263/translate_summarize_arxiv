    "high-@xmath0 processes taking place in the background of the medium produced in ultrarelativistic heavy - ion ( a - a ) collisions are a cornerstone of the experimental a - a program at the lhc .",
    "the aim is to use these processes to do `` jet tomography '' , i.e. to study both the short - distance physics of the bulk medium ( i.e. its relevant degrees of freedom ) and the geometry of its expansion .",
    "however , so far attempts to extract even solid qualitative statements about the nature of parton - medium interaction have not been successful .",
    "two main reasons can be identified : 1 ) for steeply falling primary parton spectra , medium - induced shifts in parton energy can not be distinguished from parton absorption , hence observables lose sensitivity to model details ; 2 ) computed observable quantities depend both on assumptions made about the bulk medium evolution and the parton - medium interaction . in this work",
    ", we propose to resolve the second ambiguity by a systematic investigation of multiple observables , while we demonstrate that the first is significantly lessened for the harder lhc parton kinematics .",
    "we test different combinations of medium evolution and parton - medium interaction models against a large body of high @xmath0 observables .",
    "in particular , for the medium evolution we use a 3 + 1d ideal @xcite , a 2 + 1d ideal @xcite and a 2 + 1d viscous hydro code @xcite with both cgc and glauber initial conditions . on the parton - medium interaction side ,",
    "we test a radiative energy loss model @xcite , a parametrized @xcite and a monte - carlo ( mc ) model @xcite for incoherent energy loss , a strong - coupling phenomenological model based on ads / cft ideas @xcite and the mc in - medium shower code yajem @xcite with its variant yajem - d @xcite which introduces an explicit pathlength / energy dependence into the minimum virtuality scale down to which the shower is evolved .    in a first run ,",
    "we pose the question to what degree the underlying medium model is able to influence high @xmath0 observables . in fig .",
    "[ f-1 ] we present an example of results from a systematic investigation of both the influence of smooth hydrodynamical models @xcite and event - by - event hydrodynamics @xcite with initial state density fluctuations @xcite . summarizing the result , we find that the medium model has a considerable ( factor @xmath3 ) influence on observables such as @xmath4 at high @xmath0 or extracted parameters such as the transport coefficient @xmath5 .",
    "chiefly responsible is the location of the freeze - out hypersurface  the agreement with data in general improves if the freeze - out hypersurface is large , but noticeable effects are also caused by the initialization time or the presence / absence of viscosity .",
    "fluctuations in the hydrodynamical initial state play a minor role for extracted parameters ( @xmath6 20% ) , due to a cancellation of competing effects ( see @xcite ) , but for non - central collisions the cancellation is incomplete , leading to a decrease in suppression for small fluctuation size scale . if hard probes are used to constrain the fluctuation size , a scale of @xmath7 fm is preferred .",
    "in a second run , we test the pathlength dependence of the available parton - medium interaction models against the data @xcite . in a static medium with constant density , we expect incoherent processes to scale with pathlength @xmath8 ( elastic ) , radiative energy loss ( asw ) with @xmath9 due to coherence effects and the strong coupling model ( ads ) with @xmath10 due to the drag - force like interaction of the virtual gluon cloud with the medium .",
    "the shower code yajem is known to have in principle an @xmath9 dependence due to coherence , but which effectively reduces to @xmath8 by finite - energy corrections , whereas yajem - d has a complicated non - linear pathlength dependence . in an evolving hydrodynamical medium ,",
    "the pathlength dependence is effectively much more complicated due to effects like spatial inhomogeneities in the medium , longitudinal and transverse flow and viscous entropy production .",
    "we find that the data allow to unambiguously rule out linear pathlength dependence , leading to the conclusions that a large component ( @xmath11% ) of elastic energy loss is not favoured by the data and that finite - energy corrections to coherence arguments need to be taken seriously .",
    "the other models we tested ( asw , ads and yajem - d ) remain viable with the data , although in each case only in combination with a particular hydrodynamical evolution model .",
    "using the ekrt saturation model , we can extrapolate one of our default hydro runs to lhc energies @xcite and thus significantly reduce the uncertainty in the hydrodynamical modelling , as the well - defined extrapolation procedure allows to compare results for the same hydrodynamics at different @xmath12 .    fig .",
    "[ f - lhc ] shows results for @xmath13 in central and non - central collisions .",
    "as expected , the sensitivity to model details in the @xmath0 dependence of the nuclear suppression factor is found to be much larger at lhc than at rhic . combined with pathlength - dependent observables such as @xmath14 or the dihadron suppression factor @xmath15",
    ", precision lhc data thus have a high potential for distinguishing between different models .",
    "we can quantify the quality of extrapolation in @xmath12 by the factor @xmath16 which quantifies the differences of parton - medium interaction parameters for a best fit to rhic and lhc data , using the same hydrodynamical models .",
    "@xmath17 indicates an extrapolation without any tuning .",
    "we find that the shower codes yajem - d ( @xmath18 ) and yajem ( @xmath19 ) extrapolate reasonably well , whereas the radiative energy loss scenario asw ( @xmath20 ) is not favoured by the data , and a strongly coupled scenario ads is strongly disfavoured with @xmath21 .",
    "the latter effect can be readily understood by a dimensional analysis  if the pathlength dependence is @xmath10 , then for dimensional reasons the model must probe the medium temperature as @xmath22 , i.e. the model responds much more strongly than all others to the higher initial medium density at the lhc , which leads to overquenching . given this finding , there is currently no reason to assume that the data would prefer a strongly coupled over a perturbative scenario of parton - medium interaction .",
    "combining the constraints from pathlength dependence and @xmath12 extrapolation , assuming no systematic uncertainty on the published lhc data @xcite , out of the models tested here only yajem - d together with a hydrodynamics similar to the 3 + 1d code remains a viable description .",
    "we take this as a strong indication that systematic studies along the lines discussed here are indeed a suitable tool to do jet tomography .    *",

    "<S> despite a wealth of experimental data for high-@xmath0 processes in heavy - ion collisions , discriminating between different models of hard parton - medium interactions has been difficult . </S>",
    "<S> a key reason is that the pqcd parton spectrum at rhic is falling so steeply that distinguishing even a moderate shift in parton energy from complete parton absorption is essentially impossible . </S>",
    "<S> in essence , energy loss models are effectively only probed in the vicinity of zero energy loss and , as a result , at rhic energies only the pathlength dependence of energy loss offers some discriminating power . at lhc </S>",
    "<S> however , this is no longer the case : due to the much flatter shape of the parton @xmath1 spectra originating from 2.76 @xmath2gev collisions , the available data probe much deeper into the model dynamics . </S>",
    "<S> a simultaneous fit of the nuclear suppression at both rhic and lhc energies thus has great potential for discriminating between various models that yield equally good descriptions of rhic data alone . </S>"
