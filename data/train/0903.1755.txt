    "the determination of the nature of ultra high energy cosmic rays ( uhecr ) is a crucial point to help understanding their origin , acceleration mechanisms and propagation from the sources to the earth . at energies below @xmath0 ev , both charge and mass can be measured directly using space detectors , however , the properties of cosmic rays of the highest energies have to be inferred from the features of the shower induced in the atmosphere .",
    "air shower experiments are either ground arrays of detectors that trigger in coincidence when a shower passes through them , or optical detectors that observe the longitudinal development of the extensive air shower ( eas ) @xcite .",
    "the measurement of the primary mass in eas experiments is known to be very difficult due to the large fluctuations resulting from the statistical nature of the shower development , in particular those associated to the depth and the number of particles produced in the first interactions .",
    "furthermore , the interpretation of data to determine mass composition has to be obtained by comparison with monte carlo predictions dependent on high energy hadronic models . with increasing primary energy ,",
    "this task becomes more difficult as the gap to the energy range studied in accelerator experiments increases and the hadronic interaction properties have to be extrapolated over a wide range .",
    "one of the main sources of uncertainties in any analysis to determine mass composition comes from the different predictions for different hadronic interaction models .    ) defines two regions , `` early '' ( @xmath1 ) before the shower core impact point and the opposite `` late '' region .",
    "note the different amount of atmosphere traversed by the particles reaching the detectors in each region.,width=529 ]    the distribution of shower maximum , @xmath2 , that is the atmospheric depth at which the number of charged particles in the eas is maximum , is sensitive to the composition of cosmic rays .",
    "protons produce deeper showers with fluctuations larger than those of heavier nuclei .",
    "therefore , for a given primary energy , the @xmath3 value and its fluctuations decrease with heavier primary mass .",
    "this is the principle in which separation methods using @xmath3 , its fluctuations and the elongation rate , d(@xmath2)/d(log@xmath4 ) @xcite , as measured by fluorescence detectors , are based .    in ground array experiments",
    "the analysis is usually performed by projecting the signals registered by the detectors into the shower plane ( see figure [ fig : esquema ] ) and thus , neglecting the further shower evolution of the late regions . as a consequence , for inclined showers , the circular symmetry in the signals of surface detectors is broken .",
    "this results in a dependence of the signal features on the azimuth angle in the shower plane  @xcite , mainly due to the different amount of atmosphere traversed by the shower particles  @xcite .",
    "evidences of azimuthal asymmetries in the signal size were first observed at haverah park  @xcite .",
    "recently the pierre auger observatory has found in addition , the expected asymmetry in the particle arrival time distributions  @xcite .",
    "the observation of these asymmetries for incoming directions with zenith angle smaller than 60@xmath5 , has been possible at the pierre auger observatory due to the large size of the array and the high time resolution electronic of the surface detector stations  @xcite .",
    "the design of the observatory allows measuring this feature of eas which , as demonstrated below , carries very valuable information on to the chemical composition of cosmic rays .",
    "first results showing the sensitivity to primary species at the pierre auger observatory have been presented in  @xcite and  @xcite .    in this work",
    "it is shown that the asymmetry in risetime , @xmath6 , defined as the time to reach from 10% to 50% of the total integrated signal in each station , is related to the shower stage of development  @xcite .",
    "thus , for a given primary energy @xmath4 , the asymmetry depends on zenith angle @xmath7 of the primary cosmic ray in such a way that its behavior versus @xmath8 is reminiscent of the longitudinal development of the shower .",
    "this `` longitudinal development of the asymmetry '' is strongly dependent on the nature of the primary particle .",
    "the method presented here is quite general and , in principle , might be applied to other timing parameters describing the time signal structure as well as other shower observables like signal size which was observed to be less sensitive to mass composition .",
    "the analysis described in this work is based on monte carlo simulations carried out with the code aires  @xcite using the hadronic interaction models qgsjetii(03 ) @xcite and sibyll 2.1 @xcite . the aires generated showers were subsequently used as input in the detector simulation code and finally reconstructed using for both tasks the official offline reconstruction framework of the pierre auger observatory  @xcite .",
    "the paper is organised as follows . in section [ sec : linear ] the relationship between asymmetry in the time structure and shower evolution is discussed in detail .",
    "a brief description of the pierre auger observatory , which has been selected as a case study of this novel technique is given in section [ sec : au ] .",
    "the features of the monte carlo sample used for our analysis are described in section [ sec : mc ] .",
    "the core of the method is presented in section [ sec : steps ] where several mass sensitive parameters are defined .",
    "the procedure for the determination of the longitudinal asymmetry development and the definition of the discrimination parameters is firstly presented in [ sec : longdev ] .",
    "the energy dependence of the parameters as predicted by two different hadronic models is discussed in [ sec : had ] . in section [ sec : xmax ]",
    "the relationship of our discrimination parameters with the shower maximum depth is analysed . finally , a statistical method to estimate the primary mass composition under a two - component ( p - fe ) assumption is presented in section [ sec : fefraction ] with a discussion on systematic uncertainties .",
    "most of the observables sensitive to composition aim at being like a snapshot of the shower development and thus , they are correlated with both @xmath2 and the observation depth . the time distribution of the signals recorded by the surface detector in eas experiments contains implicitly the information of the shower development .",
    "therefore , it is natural to expect a dependence of the mean value of risetime and its azimuthal asymmetry with the atmospheric depth traversed by the shower and thus with the zenith angle of the incoming cosmic ray direction .",
    "the sensitivity of timing parameters to primary composition can be explained on the basis of the dominance in the different time regions of the signal of the electromagnetic and muonic component .",
    "the first portion of the signal is dominated by the muon component which tends to arrive earlier and over a period of time shorter than that of the electromagnetic particles ( em ) , which are spread out on time .",
    "the relation between asymmetry and shower evolution is sketched in figure  [ fig : eas ] , where three different scenarios are presented for a shower with a given @xmath2 value , arriving at three different zenith angles .",
    "the attenuation ( early - late ) of the em component depends on the difference in the path travelled by particles to reach the detector stations . in case ( a ) ,",
    "i.e. vertical shower , there is no difference in the paths of the em component so there is no asymmetry . as the zenith angle increases",
    "( case b ) the difference in the attenuation of the em component due to different travelled paths increases and , as a result , early - late asymmetry appears . at zenith angles smaller than 30@xmath9",
    "there is an additional effect affecting the asymmetry when using water cherenkov detector for surface arrays , due to a combination of the geometry of these stations and the arrival direction of individual particles @xcite . at very large zenith angles ( case c )",
    "the em component has been strongly absorbed before reaching the detector .",
    "therefore , the asymmetry decreases with @xmath7 since the larger is the angle the smaller is the contribution of the em component .",
    "note that the muonic component is basically asymmetry free .",
    "then for a given zenith angle the asymmetry gives information of the stage of development of the shower . according to the above arguments , a plot of asymmetry against @xmath10",
    "is expected to have a maximum which is correlated with the longitudinal shower evolution .",
    "the slant depth traversed by the shower particles , @xmath11 , can be expressed using a taylor expansion around @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the vertical atmospheric depth at ground .",
    "since the azimuth angle correction is small compared to the total slant depth , in a first approximation , one can keep only the first term which is equivalent to using a linear function in @xmath14 to describe asymmetries @xcite .",
    "thus , the atmospheric slant depth around the shower axis , can be expressed at fixed distance from the core , @xmath15 , by @xmath16 a generic time distribution for vertical showers @xmath17 depending on atmospheric depth and core distance @xmath18 , becomes for inclined showers @xmath19 where @xmath18 is measured in the shower plane .",
    "a taylor expansion of @xmath20 around @xmath21 gives @xmath22",
    "@xmath23 @xmath24 @xmath25    keeping only the first term of the expansion , equation ( [ eq : taylor ] ) can be expressed as @xmath26 with @xmath27 @xmath28 the asymmetry factor @xmath29 which depends on @xmath21 , can be used as a measure of the logarithmic variation of @xmath20 with slant depth .",
    "this parameter is an indicator of the shower evolution and hence it provides a measure of the composition of the primary particle .",
    "the dependence of the asymmetry factor @xmath30 with @xmath31 allows one to find new observables useful for determining the mass composition , as it will be shown in section [ sec : steps ] .",
    "the technique shown in this work relies in the fact that ground detectors located symmetrically around the shower axis are spread out over large areas .",
    "therefore , the em component of the late signal is attenuated as compared with that of the early one .",
    "this attenuation is only significant if the shower front is very extensive .",
    "the smaller is the primary energy , the shorter is the difference in atmospheric depth between early and late stations and thus , the weaker is the observed asymmetry .",
    "for instance , a reduction of the energy shower from @xmath32 to @xmath33 ev lowers the maximum distance between fired detectors by about a 50% and so the same percentage in the attenuation difference . on the other hand ,",
    "the asymmetry in the time structure of the signal can be observed if the detectors are sensitive to both the em and muonic components .",
    "notice that the attenuation of the em component translates into a decrease of the signal risetime because the earlier muon contribution is basically the same in the early and late regions ( see figure 2 ) .",
    "thus , this method can be applied in air - shower arrays designed for the detection of uhecr which are able to register information from both components .",
    "the recently completed southern site of the pierre auger observatory @xcite fulfils these requirements and therefore the technique is very suitable for studies of mass composition using its ground array .",
    "the northern site planned to be built in colorado usa , will also be able to use this technique very efficiently with a larger array .",
    "the two sites will ensure full sky coverage .",
    "both have been designed to use hybrid detection ( a ground array of cherenkov detectors overlooked by fluorescence telescopes ) to record eass produced by cosmic rays of energies greater than @xmath32 ev .",
    "the surface detector ( sd ) of the southern site , situated near the town of malarge , in western argentina , consists of 1600 stations equally spaced on a triangular grid ( 1.5 km ) over an area of approximately 3000 @xmath34 .",
    "each sd station is a water cherenkov tank , 1.2 m high and top area of 10 @xmath35 with an internal reflecting coating .",
    "three 9 inches pmts overlook the water , and their signals are recorded by local digitisation electronics with a 40 mhz sampling rate .",
    "the southern site fluorescence detector ( fd ) consists of 4 eyes with 6 telescopes each located at the border of the sd array overlooking it .",
    "the sd records the shower front , by sampling the particle density at ground level , with a duty cycle of 100% .",
    "the fd measures the fluorescence light emitted as the shower develops through the atmosphere . as it can only operate on clear , moonless nights , its duty cycle is about 10% .",
    "this unique combination of both techniques in a hybrid detector offers huge advantages in particular , for the determining energy @xcite . with respect to primary mass estimation ,",
    "hybrid events provide a direct measurement of @xmath36",
    ". however , the bulk of events collected by the observatory have information only from the surface array , making sd observables as the one presented in this paper very valuable for composition analysis at the highest energies .",
    "the sensitivity of the method proposed here for mass composition measurements has been studied , as mentioned above , with simulated showers generated with aires 2.8.3  @xcite using both hadronic interaction models qgsjetii(03 ) and sibyll 2.1 .    the generated data sample contains a total of 2@xmath37 showers , initiated by proton and iron nuclei .",
    "the energy and zenith angle values are as follows :    * @xmath38 = 18.5 , 19.0 , 19.25 , 19.5 , 19.75 , 20.0 * @xmath7 ( deg ) = 32 , 36 , 41 , 45 , 49 , 53 , 57 , 60 , 63    the aires generated showers were subsequently used as input in the detector simulation code and finally reconstructed using for both tasks the official offline reconstruction framework of the pierre auger observatory  @xcite .",
    "detector simulation includes the generation of ground signals in the water cherenkov stations of the pierre auger observatory .",
    "the surface detector simulation has been tested and proved to be in good agreement with experimental data  @xcite .",
    "the reconstructed values of the primary energy , arrival direction and core location of the shower have been used in this analysis .",
    "the analysis is limited to the range of reconstructed @xmath7 value above 30@xmath39 and below zenith angle of 63@xmath39 where the asymmetry effect due to the shower evolution dominates .",
    "in addition standard fiducial cuts on sd stations have been applied including minimum and maximum distances to the core , signal sizes and good reconstruction of global shower parameters .",
    "in this section several parameters related to the longitudinal asymmetry development will be defined and their sensitivity to the primary mass analysed .",
    "due to the intrinsic fluctuations in extensive air showers and the limited sampling of the shower front recorded by the sd , it is not possible to obtain the mass composition in a shower by shower basis .",
    "that is , instead of measuring the asymmetry in individual showers , the approach used in this work consists of using the mean value of the asymmetry factor , as defined above ( equation [ eq : linearcos ] ) , for all showers in a certain interval of energy and zenith angle .",
    "the procedure used to get the average longitudinal development of the asymmetry , can be summarised in the following steps :    * select events in bins of reconstructed energy and @xmath40 values . for these events",
    "the risetime of those stations passing the corresponding cuts is determined . for each interval of @xmath4 , @xmath41 and @xmath42 ,",
    "the mean value and the standard deviation of the corresponding @xmath43 distribution , is calculated .",
    "it is worth mentioning that risetime grows nearly linear with the core distance ( see  @xcite and references therein ) and thus the @xmath43 value is more sensitive for the asymmetry as the whole range of @xmath18 can be used for the analysis . * for each ( @xmath4 , @xmath7 ) bin , a fit of @xmath44 to a linear cosine function of @xmath42 ( equation [ eq : linearcos ] ) provides the asymmetry factor @xmath29 .",
    "figure [ fig : rise_vs_zeta_mc ] shows as an example , the dependence of @xmath44 with azimuthal angle for monte carlo samples for both primaries , proton ( left ) and iron ( right ) , at e = @xmath45 ev and four zenith angles , 32@xmath39 , 45@xmath39 , 53@xmath39 and 60@xmath39 .",
    "the line represents the result of the fit to equation [ eq : linearcos ] . from these plots",
    "it can be seen that the mean value of @xmath44 decreases with the zenith angle as expected .",
    "besides , the asymmetry increases with the zenith angle up to a maximum value and then decreases for larger angles . * for each primary type and energy interval the dependence of the asymmetry factor on @xmath31",
    "is studied . in all cases",
    "the plot @xmath29 versus @xmath46 , i.e. the asymmetry longitudinal development , is quite symmetric and shows a clear maximum . the position of the maximum is obtained by fitting a normal function to the values of @xmath29 in bins of @xmath47 .",

    "results for both hadronic models are included in the plots .",

    "the bottom - left plot shows that _ xasymmax _ grows linearly with log@xmath4 .",
    "the corresponding linear fits ( continuous lines ) of both primary types are clearly separated , thus allowing discrimination of heavy and light primaries . on the other hand ,",

    "results of the corresponding fit are shown for iron ( red solid line ) and proton ( blue solid line ) in figure  [ fig : model_had ] at the top - right panel .",
    "the values of _ asymheight _ for heavy and light primaries for primary energies above @xmath52 ev are well separated . finally , _ xasymwidth _ is nearly independent on primary energy with a value very similar for both primaries and therefore this parameter does not allow separation between primaries .",
    "the results seem to indicate that the correlation of the asymmetry parameters with @xmath2 has a slight dependence on the hadronic interaction model .",
    "this will be addressed in the next section .",
    "as can be seen in figure [ fig : model_had ] , predictions for iron do not show a remarkable dependence on the model . on the contrary",
    ", there is a clear difference for proton primaries , particularly at high energies .",
    "this is also a feature of the @xmath2 versus @xmath4 plots ( elongation rate ) where a similar behaviour at high energies is observed for both models  @xcite .",
    "it was mentioned before that @xmath2 is the main observable related to composition in fluorescence measurements .",
    "thus , it is desirable to study the correlation between our asymmetry mass sensitive parameters measured with a surface detector and the position of shower maximum . to this end",
    ", the steps described above were repeated but instead of grouping separately p and fe events by primary energy , they were grouped in bins of @xmath2 mixing both primaries .",
    "the @xmath2 values used in these plots , are those of the simulated eas .    in figure",
    "[ fig : model_xmax ] the correlation with @xmath2 is shown for the three parameters : _ xasymmax _ , _ asymheight _ and _ xasymwidth _ using both hadronic interaction models qgsjetii(03 ) and sibyll 2.1 .",
    "as expected from figure [ fig : model_had ] , _ xasymmax _ and _ asymheight _ present a strong correlation with @xmath2 which is nearly independent on the hadronic model .",
    "this is an encouraging result reaffirming that the observed azimuthal asymmetry is a reliable mass estimator , providing accurate models to describe eas .",
    "certainly , the correlation of the sd parameters with the position of shower maximum might be also useful to provide a measurement of @xmath3 using only the data of surface detector .",
    "[ fig : model_xmax ]",
    "as already shown , the asymmetry longitudinal development , described by the three parameters above defined , is sensitive to the mass composition .",
    "the dependence of these parameters on composition has been determined as follows .",
    "firstly , a two component composition ( proton - iron ) has been assumed .",
    "for each interval in @xmath4 , @xmath40 and @xmath42 , the risetime for proton and iron showers has been obtained following the procedure described in section [ sec : steps ] .",
    "the corresponding risetimes for a number of mixtures have been inferred as the average value for both components weighted with the corresponding composition factors .",
    "the percentage of iron and proton events in the sample was changed in steps of 10% . as an example , the asymmetry longitudinal development curves at @xmath45 ev showers for different compositions are shown in figure [ fig : param_mix ] ( top - left ) . a smooth transition between pure proton to pure iron compositions can be observed .",
    "this procedure allows us to determine the dependence of the three discrimination parameters with composition , e.g. the fe fraction , named in the following @xmath53 .",
    "the result for @xmath45 ev is shown in figure [ fig : param_mix ] .",

    "<S> azimuthal asymmetries in signals of non vertical showers have been observed in ground arrays of water cherenkov detectors , like haverah park and the pierre auger observatory . </S>",
    "<S> the asymmetry in time distributions of arriving particles offers a new possibility for the determination of the mass composition . </S>",
    "<S> the dependence of this asymmetry on atmospheric depth shows a clear maximum at a position that is correlated with the primary species . in this work a novel method to determine mass composition based on these features of the ground signals </S>",
    "<S> is presented and a monte carlo study of its sensitivity is carried out .    </S>",
