    "the procedure of first multiplying by a model telluric spectrum , convolving with the resolution function and then dividing by a convolved telluric spectrum , which might appear to be unnecessary , corrects for the fact that the telluric absorption that affects the interstellar line depths differs from the observed telluric absorption because the telluric lines are not fully resolved at our r=45,000 resolution . the instrumental resolution and co column densities , temperatures , and line widths were considered free parameters which were adjusted to give the best fit to the observed spectra .",

    "the low temperature of the co gas toward hd  283809 , elias  3 - 1 , and elias  3 - 18 indicates that only the j=0 state of h@xmath0  should be populated if the h@xmath0  ortho : para ratio is thermalized at the gas temperature .",

    "the presence of both emission and absorption toward this source complicates its modeling , but the observation of q - branch lines allows us to correct for emission in the s(0 ) line , albeit with substantial uncertainty .",

    "<S> the abundance of h@xmath0  in molecular clouds , relative to the commonly used tracer co , has only been measured toward a few embedded stars , which may be surrounded by atypical gas . </S>",
    "<S> we present observations of near - infrared absorption by h@xmath0 , co , and dust toward stars behind molecular clouds , providing a representative sample of these molecules in cold molecular gas , primarily in the taurus molecular cloud . </S>",
    "<S> we find @xmath1/@xmath2  @xmath3 , @xmath4/@xmath2  @xmath5 ( @xmath6 including solid co ) , and @xmath1/@xmath4  @xmath7 . the measured @xmath1/@xmath4  ratio is consistent with that toward embedded stars in various molecular clouds , but both are less than that derived from mm - wave observations of co and star counts . </S>",
    "<S> the difference apparently results from the higher directly measured @xmath4/@xmath2  ratio . </S>"
