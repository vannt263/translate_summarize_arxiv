    "the spitzer space telescope ( @xcite ) was the first facility to detect photons from known extrasolar planets ( @xcite ) , inaugurating the current era wherein planets orbiting other stars are being studied directly .",
    "cryogenic spitzer has been a powerful facility for exoplanet characterization , using all three of its instruments .",
    "spitzer studies have produced the first temperature map of an extrasolar planet ( @xcite ) , and the first spectra of their atmospheres ( @xcite ) .",
    "spitzer will continue to study exoplanets when its store of cryogen is exhausted .",
    "` warm spitzer ' ( commencing @xmath0 spring 2009 ) will remain at t @xmath0  35k ( passively cooled by radiation ) , allowing imaging photometry at 3.6 and 4.5 @xmath1 m , at full sensitivity .",
    "the long observing times that are projected for the warm mission will facilitate several pioneering exoplanet studies not contemplated for the cryogenic mission .",
    "currently over 200 extrasolar planets are known , including 22 transiting planets ( 17 orbiting stars brighter than v=13 ) .",
    "some of these have been discovered by the doppler surveys , but an increasing majority of the transiting systems are being discovered by ground - based photometric surveys . however , the doppler surveys remain an efficient method to find hot jupiters , and surveys such as n2k ( @xcite ) continue to be a productive source of both transiting and non - transiting close - in exoplanets .",
    "the discovery rate from the photometric surveys is accelerating , because these teams have learned to efficiently identify and cull their transiting candidates , and quickly eliminate false positives . several transit surveys ( hat , tres , and xo ) recently announced multiple new giant transiting systems ( @xcite ) , and a neptune - sized planet has been discovered transiting the m - dwarf gj436 ( @xcite ) .",
    "we estimate that the number of bright ( v<13 ) stars hosting transiting giant planets will increase to @xmath0100 in the warm spitzer time frame .",
    "the discovery of transits in gj436b has stimulated interest in finding more m - dwarf planets , both by doppler surveys ( @xcite ) , and using new transit surveys targeted at bright m - dwarfs .",
    "it is reasonable to expect that @xmath010 transiting hot neptunes will be discovered transiting bright m - dwarf stars by the advent of the warm mission .",
    "moreover , the doppler surveys are finding planets orbiting evolved stars ( @xcite ) . the greater luminosity of evolved stars can potentially super - heat their close - in planets and facilitate follow - up by warm spitzer at 3.6 and 4.5  @xmath1 m .",
    "warm spitzer has a particularly important role in follow up for bright transiting exoplanet systems , as well as non - transiting systems , because in 2009 it will be the largest aperture general - purpose telescope in heliocentric orbit .",
    "heliocentric orbit provides a thermally stable environment , and it allows long periods of observation , not blocked by the earth . although kepler will have a greater aperture than spitzer , kepler will be locked - in to a specific field in cygnus , so it can not follow - up on the numerous bright transiting systems that will be discovered across the sky .",
    "the thermally stable environment of heliocentric orbit has proven to be a boon for precision photometry from spitzer .",
    "for example , the recent spitzer 8  @xmath1 m observations of the hd189733b transit reported by @xcite , illustrated in figure  1 , are among the most precise transit observations ever made .",
    "these investigators measured the planet - to - star radius ratio for hd189733b as 0.1545 @xmath2 0.0002 , corresponding to a precision of @xmath2  90 km in the radius of the giant planet , and they also measured the orbital phase variation of the planet s thermal emission .",
    "secondary eclipse detection ( right ) of hd189733b at 8  @xmath1 m using a continuous 33-hour spitzer photometry sequence ( @xcite ) . ]",
    "spitzer s precision for transits derives not only from its stable thermal environment , but also from the lack of stellar limb darkening in the ir . without limb darkening ,",
    "the transit becomes extremely  box - like  , with a flat bottom ( @xcite , see figure  1 ) .",
    "the ir transit depth yields the ratio of planet to stellar area simply and directly , without the added uncertainty of fitting to limb - darkening .",
    "spitzer is now the facility of choice for transiting planet radius measurements . a warm spitzer transit program - exploiting the bright stellar flux at 3.6 and 4.5  @xmath1 m -",
    "could significantly improve our knowledge of the mass - radius relationship , and clarify differences in bulk composition , for all but the faintest hot jupiter systems .",
    "figure  2 shows the mass - radius relation for several of the transiting giant planets ( @xcite ) .",
    "the mass - radius relation encodes fundamental information on the global structure of these planets .",
    "for example , hd149026b is inferred to have a heavy element core of at least 70 earth masses , based on the small radius for its mass ( figure  2 , and @xcite ) .",
    "this information is crucial to our understanding of planet formation , e.g. , by the core accretion and gravitational instability mechanisms ( @xcite ) .",
    "the scientific utility of these measurements will be maximized if all transiting exoplanet radii are measured to high precision , in a mutually consistent manner . moreover , as the doppler and transit surveys discover neptune to earth - sized planets orbiting m - dwarfs , the highest precision photometry will be needed to measure their radii to a precision sufficient to constrain their interior structure .",
    "ground - based photometry in the z - band is achieving sub - milli - magnitude levels of precision in many cases ( @xcite ) , and can determine the radii of some transiting giant planets to error limits imposed by astrophysical uncertainty in the stellar mass .",
    "the most favorable systems for ground - based observation are those occurring in fields with numerous nearby reference stars of comparable brightness .",
    "planets transiting bright , spatially isolated , stars are not as favorable for ground observation . moreover , as the radius of the transiting planet decreases , greater photometric precision is needed to reach the limits imposed by uncertainty in the stellar mass .",
    "nearby m - dwarfs have flux peaks longward of the visible and z - band spectral regions , and they often lack nearby comparison stars of comparable infrared brightness .",
    "neptune- to earth - sized planets orbiting nearby m - dwarfs will therefore require infrared space - borne photometry for the best possible radius precision .",
    "figure  3 illustrates a single transit of a 1-earth radius planet across an m - dwarf , observed by spitzer at 8  @xmath1 m .",
    "we simulated this case by re - scaling a real case : spitzer s recent photometry of gj436b ( @xcite ) .",
    "spitzer s nearly photon - limited precision detects this earth - sized planet to @xmath3 significance in a single transit .",
    "m observations of gj436b ( @xcite ) ]    .",
    "although figure  3 is based on spitzer observations at 8  @xmath1 m , the photon - limit for observations during the warm mission ( e.g. , at 4.5  @xmath1 m ) will be even more favorable , simply because stars are brighter at the shorter wavelength .",
    "stellar photometry at the wavelengths used by the warm mission is affected by a pixel phase effect in the irac instrument ( @xcite ) , but that can be successfully corrected by decorrelation ( @xcite ) , and recent results have demonstrated secondary eclipse detections with a precision of @xmath4 ( @xcite ) .",
    "the pixel phase effect should be correctable to even greater precison using the large data sets contemplated for the warm mission .",
    "ongoing doppler and transit monitoring of known hot jupiters can detect subtle deviations from keplerian orbits ( @xcite ) , indicating the presence of additional planets , e.g. , ` warm jupiters ' in longer period orbits , or terrestrial mass planets in low order mean motion resonances .",
    "the likely co - alignment of orbital planes increases the chance those planets will also transit , and intensive radial velocity monitoring could constrain the transit time for giant planets .",
    "warm spitzer will be a sensitive facility for confirming those transits , and extending the mass - radius relation ( figure  2 ) to planets in more distant orbits , and even to close - in terrestrial planets . even lacking specific indications from doppler measurements , searches for close - in terrestrial planets in low order mean motion resonances with known giant transiting planets ( @xcite )",
    "are warranted using warm spitzer .",
    "these searches could be combined with radius and transit timing measurements for the giant planets , in the same observing program .    for stars",
    "not known to host a hot jupiter , ongoing doppler surveys and space - borne transit surveys ( e.g. , corot ) will find more transiting planets , extending to neptune mass and below .",
    "spitzer transit measurements can precisely determine the radii of small planets .",
    "exoplanet radius measurements and transit searches are particularly appropriate for warm spitzer , because : a ) stars are bright in the 3.6 and 4.5 @xmath1 m bands , while limb darkening is still absent , b ) stellar activity is muted at ir wavelengths , and c ) longer observing times are congruent with the goal of simplified operations in the extended mission .",
    "figure  4 shows a potential example of a precise radius ( allowing precise density ) determination for a hot super - earth , compared to the mass - radius relation for solid exoplanets of various composition ( @xcite ) . in this case , the spitzer radius is sufficiently precise ( @xmath2  0.1  earth radii ) to constrain the bulk composition of this solid exoplanet by comparison to the @xcite models .",
    "m. the horizontal error bar is the mass error from gliese 876d ( @xcite ) ; the vertical ( radius ) error bar is calculated for warm spitzer , not including error in the stellar radius . ]",
    "the secondary eclipse of a transiting planet has the greatest depth at spitzer s longest wavelengths .",
    "however , the eclipses are quite detectable at spitzer s shortest wavelengths , because these are close to the peak of the planck function at the temperatures of transiting planets .",
    "secondary eclipse photometry using warm spitzer can therefore continue to define the brightness of exoplanets at 3.6 and 4.5 @xmath1 m for new bright transiting systems",
    ". this will be especially valuable if complemented by ground - based detections exactly at the expected spectral peaks at 2.2 and 3.8  @xmath1 m , which is believed to be feasible ( @xcite ) .",
    "the predicted spectrum of a hot jupiter exoplanet is illustrated in figure  5 , from @xcite .",
    "normally , the broad band spectrum is expected to be shaped by water vapor absorption .",
    "however , recent spitzer photometry of hd209458b ( @xcite ) indicates much better agreement with a spectrum wherein the water bands appear in _ emission _ , and can only be explained by the presence of a thermal inversion at high altitude ( @xcite ) .",
    "the nature of the high altitude absorber needed to create this inversion is unknown , and may be connected to the specific properties of the system , such as the planet s level of irradiation or surface gravity .",
    "a comprehensive survey of the bright transiting systems would make it possible to search for correlations between the presence of a temperature inversion and other properties of the systems , thus providing insight into the origin of the inversions .",
    "such a survey would also identify the best systems for spectroscopic follow up by jwst .",
    "the signature of such an inversion is easily observed in the 3.6 and 4.5  @xmath1 m spitzer bandpasses .",
    "standard models for atmospheres without temperature inversions predict that the planets will appear brighter at 3.6  @xmath1 m than at 4.5  @xmath1 m ( see figure  5 ) due to the presence of water absorption bands at wavelengths longer than 4.5  @xmath1 m . with a thermal inversion",
    "the relative brightnesses in the two bands are reversed , as the 3.6  @xmath1 m flux is suppressed and the 4.5  @xmath1 m flux is correspondingly enhanced by the presence of water emission at the longer wavelengths .",
    "m compared to 4.5  @xmath1 m , indicative of a water absorption spectrum .",
    "these contrast values will be reversed for a water emission spectrum .",
    "the dotted line is a blackbody spectrum . ]",
    "the cycle of variable stellar heating caused by planetary rotation can drive a lively dynamics in hot jupiter atmospheres ( @xcite ) . in turn",
    ", the atmospheric dynamics will produce a spatially and temporally varing temperature field , and the temperature fluctuations are expected to be of large spatial scale for close - in planets ( @xcite ) . for the temperatures found in hot jupiter atmospheres ( t@xmath01200k ) , the planck function at warm spitzer wavelengths varies strongly with temperature .",
    "consequently , temporal variations in thermal emission from close - in planets should be readily observable during the warm mission .",
    "the secondary eclipse depth of a given transiting system can vary , and observations of multiple eclipses could yield key insights into the atmospheric physics .",
    "observations extended over a full orbit - even for non - transiting systems - can potentially reveal variations in thermal emission correlated with orbit phase ( @xcite ) .",
    "orbital phase variations can reflect the changing viewing geometry , but can also be caused by strong atmospheric dynamics in response to the variable stellar forcing that is characteristic of eccentric orbits .",
    "extrasolar planets have more eccentric orbits on average than do the planets of our own solar system . in some cases",
    ", their eccentricity extends to strikingly high values .",
    "for example , hd 80606b has an eccentricity of 0.93 ( @xcite ) . during its close periastron passage , it receives a stellar flux more than 1000 times greater than the flux received by earth from the sun .",
    "this strong flux will cause a rapid heating of the planet s atmosphere , and its time dependence encodes crucial information on the radiative time scale , and thus the composition , of the planet s atmosphere ( @xcite ) .",
    "this rapid heating of hd 80606b and similar systems may be observable at 3.6 and 4.5 @xmath1 m . in this regard",
    "it is interesting to note that the exoplanet hd185269b orbits a sub - giant star , having greater than solar luminosity , in a close orbit ( 6.8 day period ) , with an eccentricity of 0.3 ( @xcite ) .",
    "the resultant strong variation in stellar heating over the orbit will force a corresponding variation in the planet s thermal emission , that should correlate with orbital phase .",
    "recently , the transiting planets xo-3 and hat - p-2 have also been found to have a significant eccentricity ( @xcite ) , opening the possibility to also measure the spatial distribution of time dependent heating on the planet s disk ( @xcite ) .",
    "given the high precision possible from spitzer , it may be possible to observe all of these effects at 4.5  @xmath1 m using warm spitzer .",
    "there is considerable recent interest in the indirect detection of extrasolar terrestrial planets via their perturbations to the transit times of giant transiting planets ( @xcite ) .",
    "spitzer transit photometry during the warm mission is an excellent way to make precise transit timing measurements .",
    "the lack of ir limb darkening is again a significant advantage , because it results in very steep ingress and egress curves , producing excellent timing precision .",
    "@xcite found a timing precision for the hd189733b transit of 6  seconds .",
    "hubble transit timing errors range from 10 to 50 seconds ( @xcite ) , although a 3  second timing precision was recently achieved for hd189733b by @xcite",
    ". however , spitzer has the advantage that the lower contrast of star spots and plage in the ir as compared to visible wavelengths minimizes systematic errors due to stellar activity noise .",
    "also , spitzer s heliocentric orbit permits continuous measurements before , during , and after transit - unlike hubble where blocking by earth interrupts transits",
    ". moreover , spitzer transit timing precision should be even better at the shorter wavelengths available for the warm mission , because stars are brighter at shorter wavelengths , and limb darkening remains negligible .    ) for warm spitzer observing giant planet transits at 4.5  @xmath1 m , as a function of stellar brightness . ]",
    "the continued success of the ground - based transit surveys , the advent of corot , and the upcoming launch of kepler , will provide a wealth of targets for warm spitzer follow - up .",
    "we have calculated the transit timing precision by warm spitzer at 3.6 and 4.5 @xmath1 m , for solar - type stars at different distances ( figure  6 ) .",
    "this calculation is consistent with the @xcite result , and it projects a spitzer timing precision of better than 40 seconds down to the faint end of kepler s range at v=14 .",
    "this is sufficient to detect perturbations by terrestrial planets well below one earth mass in resonant orbits ( agol et al .",
    "2005 ) , or to @xmath0 10 ( 150 days/@xmath6 ) earth masses for @xmath7 , where @xmath8 are the periods of the transiting and perturbing planets ( @xcite ) .",
    "the warm spitzer mission will begin at about the same time that kepler begins to discover multiple new giant transiting planets ( february 2009 launch ) .",
    "the observing cadence of the kepler mission is not optimized for transit timing ( @xcite ) , so transit timing observations in the kepler field by warm spitzer could leverage and enhance kepler s science return .",
    "although the bulk of spitzer s results for exoplanets have relied on time series photometry and spectroscopy , spitzer s high sensitivity in imaging mode is also important for exoplanet imaging studies .",
    "radial velocity surveys have reached the precision required to detect planets only in the last 10 years , so little is known about the frequency of exoplanets and other low mass companions at distances greater than @xmath0 5 - 10 au .",
    "this is unfortunate because determining the presence of planetary mass bodies in the periphery of known exoplanetary systems has important implications for their evolution .",
    "these include studying the dynamical `` heating '' of the orbits in the system , which may result in higher eccentricities ( or even expulsion ) of some components , or in enhanced collision rates between the bodies in extrasolar kuiper belts , which may be responsible for the formation of transient debris disks .",
    "imaging can in principle fill this observational gap .",
    "three objects of near planetary mass have already been detected within 300 au from the primary around the brown dwarf 2m1207 ( @xcite ) and the stars gq lup ( @xcite ) and ab pic ( @xcite ) with ground based adaptive optics observations .",
    "other optical and near - ir searches from the ground and from space , have so far produced negative results .",
    "warm spitzer may provide a significant contribution in this arena , as the two surviving irac bands are particularly suited for the detection of cool extrasolar planets and brown dwarf companions ( t and the so - called y dwarfs ) .",
    "a gap in molecular opacities of giant planets near 4.5  @xmath1 m allows emission from deep , warmer atmospheric layers to escape : giant planets are very bright at this wavelength ( @xcite ) .",
    "a strong methane absorption band strongly depresses the planetary flux at 3.6  @xmath1 m : as a result , the irac [ 3.6]-[4.5 ] color of planetary mass bodies is expected to be unique , and allow for their identification among background objects in the field .",
    "model atmosphere calculations predict that a 1  gyr old , 2  m@xmath9 planet around a star 10 pc from the sun will have a 4.5  @xmath1 m magnitude of @xmath0  18 .",
    "such planets are detectable today with irac provided that the diffracted light from the central bright star can be removed at the planet s image location .",
    "the stability of spitzer s optical and pointing systems assures that the stellar point spread function ( psf ) is highly reproducible , allowing much fainter nearby sources to be identified in the psf wings using differential measurements .",
    "this search has already been carried out for the debris disk star @xmath10  eridani , which is also home of a jovian class radial velocity planet orbiting the star at 3.4  au ( @xcite ) .",
    "the search has set stringent limits for the mass of external planetary bodies in the system ( including the area occupied by the debris disk , @xcite ) , and demonstrated that this technique is sensitive to the detection of planets with mass as low as 1  m@xmath9 ( figure  7 ) outside the 14 arcsec radius ( 50  au ) where the irac frames are saturated .",
    "the search radius can be reduced to @xmath11 arcsec or less by using shorter frame times available in irac subarray mode .",
    "a pilot search of 16 nearby stellar systems is being conducted in spitzer cycles 3 and 4 .",
    "these programs will identify possible candidates based on their [ 3.6]-[4.5 ] colors , which will need to be verified by second epoch observations during the warm mission , to detect their common proper motion with the primary .",
    "the spitzer warm mission will provide the opportunity to extend the search of planetary mass companions through imaging techniques to a large number of systems in the solar neighborhood , probing a search radius from @xmath0 10 to 10,000 au around stars within 30 pc from the sun .",
    "this search will be sensitive to masses as low as a few jupiter masses , depending on the age and distance of the systems .",
    "these observations will be complementary to ground based radial velocity and imaging searches with adaptive optics systems , given the larger field of view and higher sensitivity of irac , in a wavelength range where the required contrast ratio ( as low as @xmath12 of the parent star flux ) is more accessible than in the optical and near - ir .",
    "we thank the spitzer science center for the opportunity to consider and discuss the potential for exoplanet science during the warm mission .",
    "we are grateful to josh winn and andy gould for helpful conversations and remarks regarding the relative merits of of ground - based vs. space - borne photometry .",
    "we also acknowledge informative conversations with greg laughlin on the effects of heating in eccentric orbits ."
