    "<S> we present an experimental study of the compaction dynamics for two - dimensional anisotropic granular systems . </S>",
    "<S> the compaction dynamics of rods is measured at three different scales : ( i ) the macroscopic scale through the packing fraction @xmath0 , ( ii ) the mesoscopic scale through both fractions of aligned grains @xmath1 and ideally ordered grains @xmath2 , and ( iii ) the microscopic scale through both rotational and translational grain mobilities @xmath3 . at the macroscopic scale , we have observed two stages during the compaction process suggesting different characteristic time scales for grain relaxation . at the mesoscopic scale , we have observed the formation and the growth of domains made of aligned grains during the first stage of compaction . at the late stage , </S>",
    "<S> these domains of aligned grains are sheared to form ideally ordered domains . from a microscopic point of view </S>",
    "<S> , measurements reveal that the beginning of the compaction process is essentially related to translational motion of the grains . </S>",
    "<S> the grain rotations drive mainly the process during the late stages of compaction . </S>"
