    "exoplanet surveys have contributed to a wide range of ancillary astrophysical disciplines during the last two decades , including studies of variable stars , binary stars and brown dwarf ( bd ) companions .",
    "during the course of operation , these surveys detect a large variety of stellar binaries that can be used to study stellar structure , atmospheres and formation mechanisms .",
    "one example of the latter is a study of the multiplicity of close binaries , e.g. , the fraction of close binaries that are in triple or higher - order systems . indeed , triple systems are not uncommon amongst short - period binaries ; 9 out of 16 binaries with @xmath13 days in the volume - limited sample of @xcite are members of triple systems .",
    "shorter - period binaries have an even greater probability of being in a multiple - star system ( @xmath14% for @xmath15 days vs. @xmath16% for @xmath17 days , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    the orbital elements of such binaries , including the mutual inclinations of the companions orbital angular momentum vectors , are fossil records of their formation process , and provide critical constraints to binary star formation models @xcite .",
    "comparison of the orbital and physical properties between different binary hierarchies also provides insight into binary star formation theory @xcite .",
    "in fact , the dynamical evolution of these systems may be dominated by dynamical interactions between the inner and outer companions via a combination of the kozai - lidov mechanism @xcite and tidal forces , which drive the inner companion to shorter orbital separations until it circularizes with some period @xmath18 days , beyond which tidal forces are ineffective @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we present the discovery of a companion with a substellar minimum mass orbiting the bright ( @xmath19 ) f - type star tyc 2930 - 00872 - 1 ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter tyc 2930 ) , with an orbital period of @xmath0 days .",
    "this discovery is part of a series of papers dedicated to analyses of individual low - mass companions in anticipation of a global analysis of the marvels sample at the conclusion of the survey ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , therefore , tyc 2930 is also designated `` marvels-2 '' as an internal reference within this series .",
    "the a priori transit probability of the inner companion is @xmath2013% with an expected central transit depth of @xmath21% for a @xmath22 companion radius , although no transits are detected .",
    "an additional , long - term trend in the rv data is detected from a stellar tertiary in the system .",
    "a detailed analysis of the combined radial velocity , spectroscopic and photometric data suggests the inner companion is oriented towards a pole - on configuration , and is more likely an m dwarf with a mass @xmath23 , while the tertiary is likely to be less inclined .",
    "in such a scenario , the mutual inclination between the secondary and tertiary is likely to be significant , which would make this an excellent example of a system whose dynamical history was driven via the kozai - lidov mechanism .",
    "the paper is organized such that  [ specsec ] describes the spectroscopic observations and their data processing ,  [ photobs ] describes the archival and observed photometry for the system ,  [ starchar ] describes the characterization of the host star s properties , including mass , radius , effective temperature , surface gravity , metallicity , stellar activity and rotation rate ,  [ orbitfit ] describes our determination of the orbital parameters from fitting the measured rvs ,  [ imaging ] describes both lucky imaging and adaptive optics imaging to search for any wide companions to tyc 2930 ,  [ relphot ] describes our search for photometric variability and any potential transits of the inner companion ,  [ geomtides ] discusses the tidal evolution of the inner companion ,  [ massdistsection ] describes the posterior distribution of the true masses for both the secondary and tertiary given the results from the previous sections , and finally , ",

    "the importance of the octupole - order terms relative to the quadrupole - order terms in the doubly - averaged three - body hamiltonian is given by the parameter @xmath348 in the limit that @xmath349 and @xmath350 , it is possible for the triple system to `` flip '' , i.e. , the system exhibits quasi - periodic cycles in @xmath297 through 0 , and the tertiary passes between prograde and retrograde @xcite .",
    "these flips occur even for small values of @xmath351 ( @xmath352 ) in the test particle approximation , as long as the system is sufficiently inclined and the arguments of periastrons are chosen judiciously ( see figures 3 and 7 of @xcite and @xcite , respectively ) .",
    "flips become increasingly common for triple systems with larger values of @xmath351 , and they correspond to extremely large spikes in @xmath89 , such that @xmath353 . such qualitative behaviors ( flips and eccentricity spikes ) are referred to as the `` eccentric kozai - lidov mechanism '' , and can occur over a broad range of parameters within octupole - order calculations .",
    "@xcite have recently highlighted the mass dependence of the eccentric kozai - lidov mechanism , and performed one of the first explorations of the eccentric kozai - lidov mechanism for triple stellar systems .",
    "they found that many triple systems become tidally affected while on the main sequence as a result of this mechanism .",
    "the mechanism can even be effective for triple systems that would not otherwise become tidally affected during normal kozai - lidov oscillations in quadrupole - order calculations .",
    "as an example of the eccentric kozai - lidov mechanism , we integrated the orbit of a system with @xmath332 , @xmath333 , @xmath334 , @xmath354 , @xmath336 , @xmath355 , @xmath356 , @xmath339 , @xmath357 , and @xmath341 .",
    "[ eccentrickozai ] shows the resulting evolution .",
    "there are many qualitative differences between the evolution of this system and that shown in fig .",
    "[ normalkozai ] .",
    "the most obvious of these are the periodic oscillations of @xmath90 , the long - term oscillations of the minimum @xmath326 , and the flipping of the sign of @xmath326 , which corresponds to large spikes in @xmath358 .",
    "what is the fate of systems that become tidally affected due to the eccentric kozai - lidov mechanism ?",
    "unfortunately , no study has been performed to investigate the eccentric kozai - lidov mechanism with the inclusion of tidal dissipation for triple stellar systems .",
    "it is possible that tidal friction will simply detune the eccentric kozai - lidov mechanism , inhibiting the extreme spikes in eccentricity observed in our example system .",
    "however , @xcite investigated the eccentric kozai - lidov mechanism with tidal friction for a jupiter - mass secondary in an octupole - order calculation .",
    "they demonstrate that the extremely high @xmath89 obtained during a flip can lead to large tidal effects , which rapidly capture the planet in a short - period retrograde orbit .",
    "they coin this mechanism `` kozai capture '' and claim it may explain the occurrence of retrograde , short - period , gas giant planets .",
    "a similar mechanism may operate for stellar triple systems , in which kozai capture would cause a rapid dissipation of orbital energy from the inner binary during its evolution .",
    "this would result in a circularized inner binary with a semimajor axis of a few @xmath344 , and thus provides a plausible scenario by which tyc",
    "2930 s secondary star was driven to such a small semimajor axis .",
    "we have discovered a short - period companion to tyc 2930 - 00872 - 1 with a minimum mass below the hydrogen burning limit . despite its relatively high transit probability",
    ", we exclude any transits of the companion with high confidence using data from three ground - based telescopes . a long - term trend in the rvs",
    "indicate the presence of a longer - period tertiary in the system .",
    "the tertiary s spectral lines are not detected in our spectroscopic data , its fluxes do not significantly contribute to our sed fitting , and direct imaging excludes stellar - mass , main - sequence companions out to projected separations of 30 au .",
    "our spectra show the clear presence of ca h and k core emission , but there is an unexpected lack of photometric variability , and the measured @xmath7 is significantly smaller than expected if the primary s rotation rate was tidally synchronized to the inner companion s orbital period .",
    "this suggests the primary s stellar spin axis is closely aligned to the line - of - sight .",
    "given the age of the system , it is expected that the inner companion s orbital angular momentum vector is aligned with the stellar spin axis , therefore its line - of - sight orbital inclination is low , and its true mass is likely to be stellar .",
    "the absence of any detected signal from either component in the spectra and sed place an upper mass limit of @xmath359 , if they are not stellar remnants . assuming",
    "the tertiary is not a remnant , the upper mass limit places a lower limit to its line - of - sight inclination , which results in a significant mutual inclination between the secondary and tertiary .",
    "such mutual inclinations are expected if the system s dynamical history was driven by the kozai - lidov mechanism .",
    "long - term rv monitoring of the outer companion to obtain reliable orbital parameters will greatly improve the constraints that can be placed on the mutual inclination between the secondary and tertiary .",
    "furthermore , high signal - to - noise ratio spectroscopic observations that could detect the presence of the ( presumably ) m dwarf companions would also allow for masses to be assigned to both objects and improve the inclination constraints .",
