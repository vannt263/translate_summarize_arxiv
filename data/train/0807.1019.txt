    "uniaxially anisotropic heisenberg antiferromagnets in a magnetic field have been studied quite extensively in the past , both experimentally and theoretically .",
    "typically , they display , at low temperatures , the antiferromagnetic phase and , when increasing the field , the spin  flop phase @xcite .",
    "a prototypical model describing these phases is the heisenberg model with a uniaxial exchange anisotropy , the xxz model    @xmath0    \\ ; - \\ ; h \\sum\\limits_{i } s_i^z\\ ] ]    where @xmath1 is the exchange coupling between classical spins , @xmath2 , of length one at neighboring sites , @xmath3 and @xmath4 , of a simple cubic lattice , @xmath5 is the exchange anisotropy , @xmath6 , and @xmath7 is the applied magnetic field along the easy axis , the @xmath8axis .",
    "the phase diagram of the model has been studied several years ago , using mean  field theory @xcite , monte carlo simulations @xcite , and high temperature series expansions @xcite , suggesting the transition between the antiferromagnetic ( af ) and spin  flop ( sf ) phases to be of first order and the boundaries of the paramagnetic phase to the af and sf phases to be continuous transitions in the ising and xy universality classes .",
    "based on renormalization group analysis in one loop order , a bicritical point in the heisenberg universality class has been proposed , at which the three different phases meet @xcite . however , this scenario has been scrutinized when doing renormalization group calculations in high loop order @xcite , where the bicritical point is found to be unstable against a tetracritical biconical point @xcite , which , in turn , may be unstable towards transitions of first order in the vicinity of the multicritical point of the three phases .",
    "the seemingly conflicting descriptions may be reconciled by a new renormalization group analysis in two loop order @xcite .    as has been noted very recently @xcite , not only af and sf phases , but also biconical ( bc ) structures ,",
    "1 , may play an important role in the xxz model .",
    "indeed , such bc structures are degenerate ground states at the critical field separating af and sf configurations at zero temperature . for the xxz model on a square lattice , these degenerate bc fluctuations seem to lead to a narrow disordered phase intervening between the af and sf phases at low temperatures @xcite .",
    "the importance of bc structures for the three  dimensional xxz antiferromagnet , where they are also present as degenerate ground states at the special field , had not been studied in any detail so far .",
    "biconical structures may be ground states even in a finite range of magnetic fields , giving then rise to an ordered bc phase at low temperatures , when introducing in the xxz model further anisotropy terms or longer ",
    "range exchange interactions , as it is known for many years @xcite .",
    "this feature has been confirmed in recent simulations when adding a quadratic single ",
    "ion anisotropy to the xxz model on the square lattice @xcite .",

    "ion term of cubic symmetry may be written in the form @xcite @xmath9\\ ] ] where @xmath10 denotes the strength of the cubic anisotropy. the sign of @xmath10 determines whether the spins tend to align along the cubic axes , for @xmath11 , or , for @xmath12 , in the diagonal directions of the lattice . because of these tendencies , the bc structures show no full rotational invariance in the @xmath13plane perpendicular to the easy axis , the @xmath8axis , in contrast to the xxz case .",
    "when an ordered bc phase exists at low temperatures , for example due to the cubic anisotropy , intricate multicritical behavior may show up , including a tetracritical biconical point , at which the af , sf , bc , and paramagnetic phases meet , as has been discussed before @xcite , applying mean - field theory and renormalization group arguments .",

    "the phase boundary lines deviate somewhat from the ones estimated before @xcite , which we attribute to the improved statistics of the present study .",
    "we also identified the type of transitions and , in the case of continuous transitions , their universality classes , by monitoring , e.g. , the finite size  dependences of the peak heights of the susceptibilities and specific heat , to estimate critical exponents , see below .    in agreement with previous suggestions @xcite",
    ", the transition between the af and sf phases is found to be of first order , with , for instance , the maximal staggered susceptibilities increasing with system size proportionally to @xmath44 , characteristic for such transitions @xcite .",
    "moreover , as a remainder of the degeneracy of the ground state at @xmath29 , biconical structures prevail near that transition at low temperatures , as one may easily observe in @xmath63 , see fig .",
    "5 . as included in the figure , the dominant bc fluctuations are quite close to those expected from the degenerate ground states , eq .",
    "note that @xmath63 displays simultaneously local maxima at positions belonging to the af and sf structures , as shown in fig .",
    "5 . the phenomenon gets more pronounced when increasing the system size , and it reflects coexistence of the af and sf phases at a first  order transition .",
    "this behavior is in marked contrast to that of the xxz antiferromagnet on a square lattice , where the bc fluctuations seem to lead to a disordered phase between the af and sf phases @xcite .",
    "the transition from the paramagnetic phase to the af phase is found to be in the ising universality class , while the transition from the paramagnetic phase to the sf phase is found to belong to the xy universality class .",

    "the arrow marks the asymptotic critical exponent in the ising universality class @xcite . ]    analyzing critical exponents and critical binder cumulants , we locate the multicritical point at @xmath68 and @xmath69 , improving the previous estimate @xcite . to obtain the estimate",
    ", we proceed as exemplified for @xmath52 in fig .",
    "we determine the _ effective _ , size  dependent critical exponent @xmath70 of the height of the peak in the staggered longitudinal susceptibility @xmath52 for the simulated system sizes at various fixed temperatures close to the boundary of the af phase .",
    "one observes a pronounced increase of the effective exponent in a small interval of temperatures .",
    "this behavior signals the change from a continuous transition of ising type , with @xmath71 @xcite , to a transition of first order , where the asymptotic exponent is expected to be 3 .",
    "a pronounced increase occurs simultaneously , within the temperature resolution of the simulations , for the effective exponent of the staggered transverse susceptibility @xcite .",
    "accordingly , it indicates a transition of first order between the af and sf phases .",
    "the ratio of the two staggered susceptibilities exhibits an extremum which height is largely independent of system size in the vicinity of the multicritical point .",
    "such a behavior seems to be consistent with a bicritical heisenberg point .",
    "these observations and interpretations on the character of the multicritical point have to be viewed with care , having in mind controversial renormalization group arguments .",
    "early renormalization group calculations in one loop order suggested a bicritical heisenberg point @xcite . later work , in five loop order , found the biconical point to be the stable one @xcite , however , not ruling out a triple point , at which at least one of the transition lines to the paramagnetic phase is , eventually close to the multicritical point , of first order .",
    "a most recent analysis indicates that all three scenarios are possible , depending on the model parameters @xcite . in our case ,",
    "@xmath59 , the monte carlo simulations seem to favor a bicritical point , with ising and xy lines of the paramagnetic phase meeting the line of first order between the af and sf phases .",
    "of course , a crossover to a different multicritical behavior in the immediate vicinity of the multicritical point may happen .",

    "however , much more extensive simulations , being beyond the scope of the present study , would be needed to study the possible multicritical points in detail .",
    "especially , the order of the transition between the bc2 and sf phases deserves a careful analysis .",
    "a transition of first order , as suggested by the ground state analysis , would preclude a tetracritical point @xcite .    finally ,",
    "we briefly mention results for the case of negative cubic anisotropy , @xmath27 , favoring spin orientations along the cubic axes . as follows from the ground state considerations , see fig.2 , biconical structures only show up at relatively large negative values of @xmath10 .",
    "moreover , the tilt angles usually seem to jump when going from the bc1 region to one of its neighboring , i.e. , ferromagnetic , af , or sf , regions .",
    "our monte carlo simulations , especially at @xmath74= -2 and varying the field at fixed temperatures @xcite , suggest that there is an ordered bc1 phase which , however , gets destabilized at quite low temperatures .",

    "classical heisenberg antiferromagnets on cubic lattices with uniaxial exchange , @xmath5 , and cubic , @xmath10 , anisotropies in a magnetic field , @xmath7 , have been studied , using ground state considerations and monte carlo techniques .",
    "in addition to antiferromagnetic ( af ) and spin  flop ( sf ) structures non  collinear , biconical ( bc ) structures are observed , depending on the strength of the anisotropies , the field , and temperature .",
    "they may occur as ground states , which , at low temperatures , may contribute to thermal fluctuations of bc type or may give rise to ordered bc phases .",
    "specifically , in the xxz antiferromagnet ( @xmath10= 0 ) biconical structures are present as degenerate ground states at the critical field separating the af and sf states . at low temperatures near the transition between the af and sf phases ,",
    "bc fluctuations show up , but they do not lead to a distinct phase , in contrast , for instance , to the situation for the xxz magnet on a square lattice , where the af and sf phases are separated by a narrow disordered phase . moreover , in this study , the multicritical point of the three  dimensional xxz model , at which the af , sf , and paramagnetic phases meet , has been located accurately for @xmath5= 0.8 .",
    "that point seems to have bicritical character , being the intersection of two continuous transition lines between the af and sf phases to the paramagnetic phase with a transition line of first  order between the af and sf phases .",
