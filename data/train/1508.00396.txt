    "with the advancement of computer technologies and 3d acquisition techniques , 3d objects nowadays are usually captured and modeled by triangular meshes for further usages . a large number of applications of triangular meshes can be found in computer graphics and computer - aided design .",
    "however , working on general meshes is a difficult task because of their complicated geometry .",
    "the complicated geometry hinders applications such as surface registration , morphing and texture mapping .",
    "to overcome this problem , one common approach is to parameterize the surfaces onto a simple parameter domain so as to simplify the computations .",
    "for instance , textures can be designed on the simple domain and then mapped back onto the original surfaces @xcite .",
    "another example that usually makes use of parameterization is surface registration @xcite . instead of directly computing the registration between two convoluted surfaces , one can perform the registration on the simple parameter domain , which is much easier .",
    "it is also common to perform surface remeshing with the aid of parameterizations @xcite . with the development of the computer industry , the problem of finding a good parameterization method is becoming increasingly important .    to make a parameterization useful and applicable",
    ", one should seek for a method that minimizes certain types of distortions .",
    "in particular , it is desirable to minimize the angular distortions of the 3d meshes .",
    "_ angle preserving parameterizations _ , also known as _ conformal parameterizations _",
    ", effectively preserve the local geometry of the surfaces . hence , in this paper , our goal is to develop an efficient conformal parameterization algorithm .",
    "the choice of the parameter domain is also a key factor in deciding the parameterization scheme . for simply - connected open surfaces ,",
    "one popular choice of the parameter domain is the unit disk . using the unit disk as a parameter domain is advantageous in the following two aspects .",
    "firstly , the existence of the conformal parameterization is theoretically guaranteed . by the uniformization theorem ,",
    "every simply - connected open surface is conformally equivalent to the open unit disk .",
    "secondly , unlike free and irregular shapes on the plane , a consistent circular boundary of the parameter domain facilitates the comparisons and mappings between different surfaces .    in real applications , besides the quality of the parameterization result , it is also important to consider the computational efficiency of the parameterization algorithm . in particular , a fast algorithm is desired so that the computation can be completed within a short time . in this paper , we develop an efficient algorithm for the disk conformal parameterization of simply - connected open surfaces . to achieve the efficiency , we first transform a topologically disk - like surface to a genus-0 closed surface by a double covering technique .",
    "then we can apply a fast parameterization algorithm for genus-0 closed surfaces to compute a spherical parameterization of the double covered surface . note that although the size of the problem is doubled by double covering , the computational efficiency is preserved because of the symmetry of the double covered surface .",
    "the spherical parameterization , together with a suitable mbius transformation and the stereographic projection , provides us with an almost circular planar parameterization for the original surface . a normalization technique followed by a composition of quasi - conformal maps",
    "are then used for obtaining a bijective disk conformal parameterization .",
    "the bijectivity of the parameterization is supported by quasi - conformal theories .",
    "the entire algorithm only involves solving sparse linear systems and hence the computation of the disk conformal parameterization is greatly accelerated .",
    "specifically , our proposed method speeds up the computation of disk conformal parameterizations by over 60% while attaining accuracy comparable to the state - of - the - art approaches @xcite .",
    "in addition , our proposed method demonstrates robustness to highly irregular triangulations .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "[ previous ] , we review the previous works on surface parameterizations . in section [ contributions ] , we highlight the contribution of our work . our proposed algorithm is then explained in details in section [ main ] .",

    "table [ difference ] highlights the main features of our proposed method and the two - step iterative approach @xcite for disk conformal parameterizations .",
    "the two - step iterative approach makes use of the disk harmonic map as an initial map , with the arc - length parameterized circular boundary constraint .",
    "this introduces large conformality distortions in the initial map . to correct the conformality distortion ,",
    "two further steps are required in @xcite .",

    "in contrast , our proposed fast method primarily consists of only two stages . in the first stage , we find an initial planar parameterization via double covering followed by a spherical conformal map .",
    "since there is no enforcement of the boundary in computing the initial planar parameterization , the conformality distortion of our initial map is much lower than that by the disk harmonic map . in the second stage",
    ", we enforce the circular boundary , and then alleviate the conformality distortion as well as achieving the bijectivity using quasi - conformal theories .",
    "the absence of iterations in our proposed algorithm attributes to the significant enhancement in the computational time when compared with the two - step iterative approach @xcite .    in the following ,",
    "we explain the two stages of our proposed algorithm in details .      instead of directly computing the map @xmath3 from a simply - connected open surface @xmath4 to the unit disk @xmath5",

    "the double covering technique was also suggested in @xcite to compute conformal gradient field of surfaces with boundaries . in the following ,",
    "we discuss the construction in the continuous setting .",
    "specifically , we construct a genus-0 closed surface @xmath6 by the following method .",
    "first , we duplicate @xmath4 and change its orientation . denote the new copy by @xmath7 .",
    "then we identify the boundaries of the two surfaces : @xmath8 by the above identification , the two surfaces @xmath4 and @xmath7 are glued along the two boundaries .",
    "note that here we do not identify the interior of the two surfaces @xmath4 and @xmath7 . as a result",
    ", a closed surface is formed .",
    "denote the new surface by @xmath6 .",
    "it can be easily noted that since @xmath4 and @xmath7 are simply - connected open surfaces , the new surface @xmath6 is a genus-0 closed surface .",
    "more explicitly , denote by @xmath9 and @xmath10 the gaussian curvature and geodesic curvature .",
    "assume that we slightly edit the boundary parts of @xmath4 and @xmath7 so that @xmath6 is smooth .",
    "then by the gauss - bonnet theorem , we have @xmath11 and @xmath12 hence , we have @xmath13 therefore , the new surface @xmath6 has euler characteristic @xmath14 , which implies that it is a genus-0 closed surface . as a remark , in the discrete case , the unsmooth part caused by the double covering does not cause any difficulty in our algorithm since we are only considering the angle structure of the glued mesh .",
    "the details of the combinatorial argument are explained in section [ implementation ] .    after obtaining @xmath6 by the abovementioned double covering technique",
    ", we look for a conformal map that maps @xmath6 to the unit sphere . by the uniformization theorem ,",
    "every genus-0 closed surface is conformally equivalent to the unit sphere .",
    "hence , the existence of such a conformal map is theoretically guaranteed .",
    "in @xcite , choi _ et al .",
    "_ proposed a fast algorithm for computing a conformal map between genus-0 closed surfaces and the unit sphere .",
    "the algorithm consists of two steps , and in each step one sparse symmetric positive definite linear system is to be solved . in the following ,",
    "we briefly describe the mentioned spherical conformal parameterization algorithm .",
    "the _ harmonic energy functional _ of a map @xmath15 from a genus-0 closed surface @xmath16 to the unit sphere is defined as @xmath17 in the space of mappings , the critical points of @xmath18 are called _",
    "harmonic mappings_. for genus-0 closed surfaces , conformal maps are equivalent to harmonic maps @xcite .",
    "therefore , to find a spherical conformal map , we can consider solving the following laplace equation @xmath19 subject to the spherical constraint @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the tangential component of @xmath22 on the tangent plane of @xmath23 .",
    "note that this problem is nonlinear . in @xcite ,",
    "the authors linearize this problem by solving the equation on the complex plane : @xmath24 given three point boundary correspondences @xmath25 , where @xmath26 for @xmath27 .",
    "note that @xmath28 since the target domain is now @xmath29 .",
    "now the problem ( [ eqt : laplace ] ) becomes linear since @xmath30 is linear and the nonlinear constraint @xmath31 in the original problem ( [ eqt : original ] ) is removed . after solving the problem ( [ eqt : laplace ] ) ,",
    "the inverse stereographic projection is applied for obtaining a spherical parameterization .",
    "note that in the discrete case , the conformality of the inner region on the complex plane is negligible but that of the outer region on the complex plane is quite large .",
    "correspondingly , the conformality distortion near the north pole of the sphere is quite large",
    ". therefore , to correct the conformality distortion near the north pole , the authors in @xcite propose to apply the south - pole stereographic projection to project the sphere onto the complex plane . unlike the result obtained by solving equation ( [ eqt : laplace ] ) , the part with high conformality distortion is now at the inner region on the plane . by fixing the outermost region and composing the map with a suitable quasi - conformal map",
    ", the distortion of the inner region can be corrected . finally , by the inverse south - pole",
    "stereographic projection , a bijective spherical conformal parameterization with negligibly low distortions can be obtained .",
    "readers are referred to @xcite and @xcite for more details of the harmonic map theory and the abovementioned algorithm respectively .",
    "the combination of the double covering technique and the fast spherical conformal parameterization algorithm in @xcite is particularly advantageous .",
    "it should be noted that because of the symmetry of the double covered surface , half of the entries in the coefficient matrix of the discretization of the laplace equation ( [ eqt : laplace ] ) are duplicated .",
    "therefore , even we have doubled the size of the problem under the double covering technique , we can save half of the computational cost of the coefficient matrix by only computing half of the entries .",
    "moreover , the spherical conformal parameterization algorithm in @xcite involves solving only two sparse symmetric positive definite systems of equations .",
    "therefore , the computation is still highly efficient .    after finding a spherical conformal map @xmath32 for the glued surface @xmath6 using the parameterization algorithm ,",
    "note that by symmetry , we can separate the unit sphere into two parts , each of which exactly corresponds to one of @xmath4 and @xmath7 . since our goal is to find a disk conformal map @xmath3 , we put our focus on only one of the two parts .",
    "now , we apply a mbius transformation on @xmath23 so that the two parts become the northern and southern hemispheres of @xmath23 . after that , by applying the stereographic projection @xmath33 defined by @xmath34 the southern hemisphere is mapped onto the open unit disk @xmath5 . since the mbius transformation and the stereographic projection are both conformal mappings , the combination of the above steps provides a conformal map @xmath3 .",
    "theoretically , by the symmetry of the double covered surface , the boundary of the planar region obtained by the above stereographic projection should be a perfect unit circle .",
    "however , in the discrete case , due to irregular triangulations of the meshes and the conformality distortions of the map , the boundary is usually different from a perfect circle , as suggested in the experimental results in @xcite . in other words ,",
    "the planar region @xmath35 we obtained after applying the stereographic projection may not be a unit disk .",
    "an illustration is given in figure [ fig : foot_disk_unnormalized ] .",
    "to solve this issue , we need one further step to enforce the circular boundary , at the same time maintaining low conformality distortions and preserving the bijectivity of the parameterization .          .",
    "]    to control the conformality distortion and the bijectivity , our idea is to normalize the boundary and then compose the map with a _ quasi - conformal map_. quasi - conformal maps are a generalization of conformal maps , which are orientation preserving homeomorphisms between riemann surfaces with bounded conformality distortions .",
    "intuitively , a conformal mapping maps infinitesimal circles to infinitesimal circles , while a quasi - conformal mapping maps infinitesimal circles to infinitesimal ellipses with bounded eccentricity @xcite .",
    "mathematically , a _ quasi - conformal map _ @xmath36 satisfies the beltrami equation @xmath37 for some complex - valued functions @xmath38 with @xmath39 .",
    "@xmath38 is called the _ beltrami coefficient _ of @xmath40 .",
    "the beltrami coefficient captures the important information of the mapping @xmath40 .",
    "for instance , the angles and the magnitudes of both the maximal magnification and the maximal shrinkage can be easily determined by the beltrami coefficient @xmath38 ( see figure [ fig : qc ] ) . specifically , the angle of the maximal magnification is @xmath41 with the magnifying factor @xmath42 , and the angle of the maximal shrinkage is the orthogonal angle @xmath43 with the shrinking factor @xmath44 .",
    "the maximal dilation of @xmath40 is given by : @xmath45 it is also noteworthy that @xmath40 is conformal around a small neighborhood of @xmath46 if and only if @xmath47 .",
    "hence , @xmath48 is a good indicator of the angular distortions of a mapping .",
    "in fact , the norm of the beltrami coefficient @xmath38 is not only related to the conformality distortion but also the bijectivity of the associated quasi - conformal mapping ,",
    "as explained by the following theorem :    [ bijectivity ] if @xmath3 is a @xmath49 map satisfying @xmath50 , then @xmath40 is bijective .",
    "see @xcite .    this theorem can be explained with the aid of the jacobian of @xmath40 .",
    "the jacobian @xmath51 of @xmath40 is given by @xmath52 suppose @xmath50 , then we have @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "therefore , @xmath55 is positive everywhere .",
    "since @xmath5 is simply - connected and @xmath40 is proper , we can conclude that @xmath40 is a diffeomorphism .",
    "in fact , @xmath40 is a universal covering map of degree 1 .",
    "therefore , @xmath40 must be bijective",
    ". one important consequence of theorem [ bijectivity ] is that we can easily achieve the bijectivity of a quasi - conformal map by enforcing its associated beltrami coefficient to be with supremum norm less than 1 .",
    "moreover , it is possible for us to reconstruct a mapping by a given beltrami coefficient , as explained by the following theorem :    [ correspondence ] let @xmath56 and @xmath57 be two simply - connected open surfaces . given 2-point correspondences , every beltrami coefficient @xmath38 with @xmath58",

    ", please refer to @xcite . in the following discussion",
    ", we denote the quasi - conformal map associated with the beltrami coefficient @xmath38 obtained by * lbs * by @xmath71 .",
    "another important property of quasi - conformal mappings is about their composition mappings .",
    "in fact , the beltrami coefficient of a composition mapping can be explicitly expressed in terms of the beltrami coefficients of the original mappings .",
    "[ composition ] let @xmath72 and @xmath73 be two quasi - conformal mappings . then the beltrami coefficient of @xmath74 is given by @xmath75 in particular , if @xmath76 , then since @xmath77 , we have @xmath78 hence @xmath74 is conformal .",
    "see @xcite .",
    "in other words , by composing two quasi - conformal maps whose beltrami coefficients satisfy the above condition , one can immediately obtain a conformal map .",
    "this observation motivates the following step .    to enforce the circular boundary of the parameterization , we first normalize the boundary of the region @xmath35 to the unit circle : @xmath79 for all @xmath80 .",
    "denote the normalized region by @xmath81 . since the vertices near the boundary of the region @xmath35 may be very dense , a direct normalization of the boundary may cause overlaps of the triangulations as well as geometric distortions on the unit disk . to eliminate the overlaps and the distortions of @xmath81",
    ", we apply the linear beltrami solver to construct another quasi - conformal map with the normalized boundary constraints .",
    "then by the composition property , the composition map becomes a conformal map .",
    "more specifically , denote the beltrami coefficient of the mapping @xmath82 from the normalized planar region to the original surface by @xmath38 .",
    "we reconstruct a quasi - conformal map with beltrami coefficient @xmath38 on the unit disk by extending the linear beltrami solver , so that it is applicable not only on rectangular domains but also circular domains .",
    "we compute a map @xmath83 by applying the linear beltrami solver : @xmath84 with the circular boundary constraint @xmath85 .",
    "note that by the composition property stated in theorem [ composition ] , @xmath86 is a conformal map from the original surface @xmath4 to the unit disk @xmath5 . finally , the bijectivity of the composition map is supported by theorem [ bijectivity ] , since the beltrami coefficient of the composition map is with supremum norm less than 1 .",
