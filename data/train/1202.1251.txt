    "in the past , parton shower generators and next - to - leading - order ( nlo ) calculations were seen as complementary approaches to computing hadronic interactions .",
    "the former had the more practical purpose of assisting experimental physicists in planning and carrying out experimental analysis .",
    "the latter were instead aimed at performing precision tests of perturbative qcd .",
    "the simplicity of the framework of fixed - order calculations was in fact required in order to make unbiased comparisons of theoretical calculations and data .",
    "after the many tests of qcd carried out at lepton and hadron colliders , convincing evidence was established that perturbative qcd at the nlo level works well , and improves the agreement of theoretical prediction with data .",
    "the interest in precise nlo calculations has then shifted in the direction of predicting cross sections and backgrounds for collider processes . in the meantime ,",
    "a theoretical effort has begun aimed at improving shower generators with the use of more precise matrix elements .",
    "this effort has led to two new developments that have had a significant impact on collider phenomenology : matrix - element and shower matching ( me+ps ) , and nlo calculations interfaced with showers ( nlo+ps ) .",
    "the former originated from the so - called ckkw paper  @xcite , and several implementations and variants of the original method have subsequently appeared in the literature ( see @xcite for a review ) . in the present review ,",
    "we focus upon the nlo+ps development , initiated by the mc@nlo paper  @xcite and followed later by the powheg proposal @xcite .",
    "the aim of these methods was to improve the event generation of a basic process in such a way that nlo accuracy is reached for inclusive observables , while maintaining the leading logarithmic accuracy of the shower approach .",
    "this review is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : nlocalc ] we briefly recall the structure of an nlo calculation , with emphasis on those aspects that are needed for the implementation of nlo+ps generators , and in section  [ sec : shower ] we review the basics of parton showers . in section  [ sec : sudakov ] we contrast the description of the sudakov region in fixed - order calculation and in shower algorithms , and specify the requirements for a nlo+ps generator . in these sections , for concreteness , we will always make reference to the simple example of higgs boson production in gluon fusion in order to clarify the basic concepts .",
    "sections  [ sec : mcatnlo ] and [ sec : powheg ] illustrate the basics of the mc@nlo and powheg methods .",
    "the following three sections discuss few issues that are common to both methods . in section  [ sec :",
    "pdf ] we discuss the use of parton density functions in the nlo+ps framework , and in section  [ sec : spincorr ] , we discuss a commonly used method for the inclusion of spin correlations .",
    "the illustration of the methods given in sections  [ sec : mcatnlo ] and [ sec : powheg ] are limited for simplicity to cases where there is only one singular region to be considered .",
    "there are in essence no conceptual difficulties in dealing with more complex cases , and in section  [ sec : complex ] we give some indications of how this is done .",
    "section  [ sec : truncated ] illustrates the role of truncated showers , which were introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite as a requirement to preserve colour coherence in the powheg approach . in this framework ,",
    "the relation between powheg and mc@nlo is also better clarified .",
    "this common view of both methods allows one to better understand the origin of differences between them , as discussed in section  [ sec : compare ] . in section  [ sec : uncertainties ] , the dominant uncertainties in nlo+ps generators are discussed , using again as an example the process of higgs production via gluon fusion .    in section  [ sec : meps ] we compare the nlo+ps and me+ps approaches , with the aim of clarifying when either approach should be preferred .",
    "finally , in section  [ sec : newdevel ] we briefly summarize the future direction of improvement in the development of nlo+ps generators .",
    "next - to - leading - order ( nlo ) calculations in qcd are used to compute infrared and collinear safe quantities at the one loop level .",
    "they considerably reduce the uncertainties of theoretical predictions , and experience from @xmath0 , @xmath1 and hadron colliders has shown that they lead to remarkable agreement of theory with data . since qcd radiation has collinear and infrared divergences , infrared and collinear insensitivity is an unavoidable requirement for an observable to be perturbatively calculable .",
    "thus , fixed - order nlo calculations can not be used for fully exclusive observables , and are not straightforwardly interfaced to parton shower programs .    a detail explanation of the general structure of an nlo calculation , with particular attention to its use in the context of shower matching , is given in ref",
    ".  @xcite .",
    "the reader will also find there references to the most popular subtraction methods for the implementation of qcd nlo corrections . here",
    "we will give an elementary illustration of the typical structure of an nlo calculation , using as an example the gluon fusion production of an on - shell higgs boson in hadronic collisions .",
    "in this example , the born phase space is characterized by a single variable that can be taken to be equal to the higgs rapidity @xmath2 .",
    "we write the born cross section as @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the differential born cross section , and @xmath5 is the born phase space . in our higgs example , @xmath6 , and @xmath7 .",
    "the calculation of the nlo cross section for the production process requires the inclusion of the virtual corrections @xmath8 and of a real emission process , with a phase space including one extra parton with respect to the basic process . in our example , the real production process is the production of the higgs plus one extra gluon .",
    "we neglect at this point @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 processes that arise at nlo , in order to keep our illustration as simple as possible . the real cross section kinematics",
    "can be characterized by the higgs rapidity , as before , and by three variables associated with the emission of an extra parton .",
    "we can choose for these variables the cosine of the angle of the emitted parton momentum with respect to the beam direction , its energy and its azimuth , all measured in the higgs+parton rest frame ( i.e. in the partonic centre - of - mass system ) .",
    "we write the real cross section as @xmath12 , where @xmath13 .",
    "we will also write @xmath14 , with @xmath15 .",
    "we call @xmath16 the radiation phase space",
    ". the differential nlo cross section is written schematically as @xmath17 where we have also assumed that all phase space jacobians needed to reproduce the lorentz invariant phase space are absorbed into the definition of @xmath4 , @xmath8 and @xmath18 .",
    "the virtual cross section @xmath8 ( which we assume to be renormalized ) has soft and collinear divergences , and must thus be regulated with an infrared cutoff , or by using dimensional regularization .",
    "the real cross section also exhibits infrared and ultraviolet divergences after integration over the radiation phase space , such that the full cross section is finite after integration .",
    "we have not included in equation  [ eq : dsignlo ] a collinear counterterm , which is needed to remove initial - state collinear singularities , since our aim here is to illustrate the structure of the nlo corrections , rather than give a detail explanation of how they are structured .",
    "notice that we assume that the real phase space @xmath19 can be given as a function of the born phase space and a radiation phase space , @xmath20 .",
    "this is straightforwardly achieved in our example , but it can be done in general .",
    "we will say that @xmath5 is the _ underlying born configuration _ of the real phase space .",
    "we also require that the mapping @xmath21 has the following properties : in the limit in which the radiated parton is soft , @xmath19 coincides with @xmath5 after removal of the soft parton , and in the limit in which the radiated parton is collinear to another massless parton , @xmath19 coincides with @xmath5 after merging of the collinear partons . by merging we mean that the two collinear partons are replaced by a single parton , with momentum equal to the sum of the two in case of final state radiation , or equal to the difference of the two in case of initial state radiation . in the higgs example , the underlying born configuration is obtained by performing a longitudinal boost to the frame where the higgs has zero rapidity , and then performing a transverse boost , such that the higgs transverse momentum vanishes .",
    "after that , the inverse of the initial longitudinal boost is applied . in this way",
    "the higgs rapidity remains equal to that in the underlying born configuration .",
    "the cancellation of soft and collinear singularities in nlo calculations is usually dealt with using the so - called subtraction method .",
    "we introduce an auxiliary counterterm @xmath22 , which is required to coincide with the real squared amplitude @xmath18 in the soft and collinear limits .",
    "assume now that we want to compute an infrared safe observable @xmath23 .",
    "infrared safety requires that @xmath24 in the soft or collinear limit .",
    "we can write @xmath25o({\\phi_{\\rm b } } ) + \\int { { \\mathrm d}}{\\phi_{\\rm r}}\\,\\left[r({\\phi_{\\rm r } } ) o({\\phi_{\\rm r}})-c({\\phi_{\\rm r}})o({\\phi_{\\rm b}})\\right ] \\label{eq : rmc}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath26 the above equations represent schematically the subtraction method in qcd . by a suitable choice of the counterterm @xmath27 ,",
    "the integral of the radiation variables in equation  [ eq : evnlo ] can be performed analytically .",
    "the soft and collinear divergent terms arising from this integration cancel against those of the virtual term , @xmath8 , yielding a finite result @xmath28 in the sum . at the same time , in equation  [ eq : rmc ] the soft and collinear divergences in @xmath18 cancel , because in the soft or collinear limit @xmath29 , and @xmath27 has the same singularity structure as @xmath18 .",
    "the collinear and infrared divergences of qcd are associated with enhanced amplitudes in collinear and soft regions of phase space .",
    "these enhancements are manifest in jet production , and in the rapid increase in particle multiplicity in hard scattering processes .",
    "they give rise to large logarithmic coefficients in observables that involve widely different scales , for example the jet mass @xmath30 at a hard process scale @xmath31 .",
    "the parton shower approximation aims to take the enhanced contributions into account to all orders , neglecting terms with subleading logarithmic or constant coefficients .",
    "we consider first the leading collinear region in which an extra parton is emitted at a small angle by one of the outgoing lines of an @xmath32-parton process ( final - state emission ) . here",
    "the cross section approximately factorizes in the form @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "the function @xmath35 depends on the type of emitting and emitted partons . in the notation of the previous section , if the @xmath32-parton process is the born process , we have @xmath36 , @xmath37 , and @xmath38 is an approximation to @xmath39 in the near - collinear region . in this region",
    "it is convenient to parametrize the phase space @xmath16 in terms of a hardness scale @xmath40 , for example the transverse momentum @xmath41 relative to the emitter , the fraction of longitudinal momentum @xmath42 of the emitter after the emission , and the azimuthal angle of splitting , @xmath43 .",
    "then @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the relevant ( dglap ) _ splitting function _ , which in practice is averaged over the azimuthal angle and simply written as @xmath46 .",
    "the collinear divergence is regulated with a cutoff , @xmath47 .",
    "emissions with @xmath48 are said to be unresolvable .",
    "emissions with small momentum fractions @xmath42 are also unresolvable . depending on the definition of the scale @xmath40 , the cutoff on @xmath42 is some function @xmath49",
    ".    equations  [ eq : dsigcoll ] and [ eq : pphi ] provide the basis of an iterative scheme for summing collinear - enhanced contributions to all orders .",
    "each parton participating in a hard process can emit at scales @xmath40 up to order @xmath50 .",
    "the probability of an emission in an interval between @xmath51 and @xmath40 is given by equation  [ eq : pphi ] .",
    "it follows that the probability of no resolvable emissions between scales @xmath52 and @xmath53 is given by @xmath54\\,.\\ ] ] this function is known as the _ sudakov form factor_.    we have justified equation  [ eq : sudakov ] using unitarity , i.e.  the conservation of probability .",
    "we now remark that relying solely upon field theory would lead to the same conclusions . in other words",
    ", it can be proven that the inclusion of all logarithmically enhanced virtual corrections in a shower process amounts to the inclusion of running couplings at each splitting vertex , evaluated at a scale of the order of the virtuality of the incoming parton , supplemented by the insertion of a sudakov form factor on each internal line , having as argument its virtuality .",
    "the result satisfies unitarity , which we do expect , since field theory must satisfy unitarity .",
    "we can say , more specifically , that logarithmic singularities must cancel in inclusive quantities , thanks to the kinoshita - lee - nauenberg ( kln ) theorem @xcite , which in turn is a consequence of unitarity .",
    "thus we expect all singularities to cancel order by order in perturbation theory , and in fact we see that by expanding the sudakov form factor in equation  [ eq : sudakov ] at order @xmath55 we do get a term that cancels exactly the integral of the real diagram describing the splitting process in the collinear approximation , given by equations  [ eq : dsigcoll ] and [ eq : pphi ] .    in a _ parton shower event generator _ , multiple emissions are generated by the monte carlo method . given the initial scale @xmath50 ,",
    "the scale of the first emission is found by solving the equation @xmath56 , where @xmath57 is a pseudorandom number uniform on the interval [ 0,1 ] .",
    "the next emission is at @xmath53 where @xmath58 , and so on , until the chosen scale falls below the cutoff @xmath59 .",
    "the emitted partons can themselves emit in the same way . in this way each outgoing parton from the hard process is converted into a shower of partons at the cutoff scale @xmath59 . below this scale the running coupling becomes large and colour confinement ensures that the parton showers are converted into jets of hadrons .",
    "perturbation theory is not applicable to this process and one has to resort to _ hadronization models _ , which fall outside the scope of the present article ( for a review see @xcite ) .",
    "one important feature of the hadronization process , observed experimentally and built into the models , should however be noted here , namely its _ locality _ : the flow of energy - momentum and flavour in the parton showers is preserved , up to power - suppressed corrections , in the resulting hadron jets .",
    "this justifies the comparison of results in perturbative qcd with data on hadronic final states .",
    "shower monte carlo generators also treat initial - state radiation in the collinear approximation , but the kinematics are slightly different : a parton from an incoming hadron beam starts at a low scale with its momentum along the beam direction and recoils with a more spacelike four - momentum after each emission , eventually reaching the hard process scale @xmath60 with a significant transverse momentum .",
    "for technical reasons it is more convenient to treat this in the opposite direction , evolving incoming partons from the hard scale down to the hadronic scale , where they are matched to the parton distributions of the incoming hadrons .    in order to arrive at a formula for the backward splitting probability in initial - state radiation ,",
    "we begin by writing the forward splitting probability in the form @xmath61 where @xmath62 and @xmath63 are the @xmath64 and @xmath32 body cross section in the mc approximation , in the singular limit .",
    "this formula can be immediately generalized to initial - state radiation , the only difference being due to the fact that the ratio of parton density functions in @xmath65 does not cancel as in final - state radiation , leading to the formula @xmath66 which is sjstrand s formula for backward evolution  @xcite in initial state radiation .",
    "collinear parton emission can be treated at the cross - section level , as in equation  [ eq : dsigcoll ] , because an emission can not be collinear with more than one hard parton .",
    "this is not the case for soft gluon emission , which occurs coherently from different partons and so should be treated at the amplitude level .",
    "two approximate showering schemes have been developed to take account of soft gluon interference . in _ angular - ordered _ showering",
    ", the scale variable @xmath40 is defined so that successive parton emissions are at decreasing angles .",
    "the separate colour charges of a pair of partons in the shower with opening angle @xmath67 can be resolved by soft gluons emitted at smaller angles , @xmath68 , so this emission is treated incoherently . on the other hand , when @xmath69 the partons are not resolved and they emit as a single object with the colour charge of their parent parton .",
    "therefore this emission is treated as coming from the parent , corresponding to angular ordering of successive emissions , as shown in figure  [ fig : qcd_coh ] .",
    "the other method for treating soft gluon coherence is _ dipole showering _",
    "@xcite . instead of",
    "sequential splitting of one parton into two , pairs of partons are treated as dipole sources for gluon emission , which splits one dipole into two .",
    "this is valid in the large-@xmath70 approximation , where @xmath70 is the number of colours .",
    "some subleading colour effects are included by matching the resulting cross sections to the parton splitting functions in collinear regions .",
    "the most visible difference between an nlo result and the output of a parton shower is the structure of the so - called sudakov region , i.e.  the region where radiation with low energy and transverse momentum is important . in the example of higgs production , this is the region where the transverse momentum of the higgs is much smaller than its mass .",
    "the @xmath71 result for this quantity diverges as @xmath72 in the @xmath73 limit .",
    "however , the integral of the @xmath41 distribution from zero to any finite value is finite .",
    "in other words , one should imagine that a contribution formed by a negative @xmath74 function with an infinite coefficient is located at @xmath41 equal to zero , and that it cancels the divergent contribution arising from the real emission cross section .    in the small @xmath41 region ,",
    "perturbation theory is not reliable any more , and one needs to resum the large logarithms of @xmath41 to all orders in perturbation theory . in the leading logarithmic approximation , this distribution is dominated by recoil of the higgs against the hardest emission .",
    "the shower monte carlo algorithm yields for the hardest emission the cross section @xmath75\\;.\\ ] ] the factor @xmath76 arises from the product of the two @xmath77 sudakov form factors , associated with the radiation from each initial line , in the notation of equation  [ eq : sudakov ] . here",
    "@xmath50 is the hard process scale , of the order of @xmath78 in this case , and @xmath79 denotes the shower monte carlo approximation for the real emission cross section . if we assume that the shower algorithm is ordered in @xmath41 , equation  [ eq : dsigdptsh ] is a simple consequence of the shower formula , since it corresponds to the generation of the first emission by the algorithm .",
    "it can be shown , however , that the formula also holds for angular ordered showers , where the hardest emission is not necessarily the first  @xcite .",
    "we notice that the shower unitarity relation holds @xmath80 { { \\mathrm d}}{p_{\\rm t}}=\\delta(q_0)+\\int_{q_0}^q \\frac{{{\\mathrm d}}\\delta({p_{\\rm t}})}{{{\\mathrm d}}{p_{\\rm t } } } { { \\mathrm d}}{p_{\\rm t}}=\\delta(q)=1\\ ] ] so that @xmath81 this relation is independent of the particular form of @xmath79 .",
    "a shower monte carlo program alone will generate a transverse momentum distribution that is accurate only for small transverse momenta , since @xmath82 is reliable only in the collinear approximation . for small transverse momenta , however , rather than having the singular behaviour of an nlo calculation ,",
    "it is well behaved , with the sudakov form factor damping the small @xmath41 singularity of the tree level result .",
    "many event generators are capable of adding a _ matrix - element correction _ ( mec ) , such that for large transverse momentum the shower result matches the fixed - order result  @xcite .",
    "this is achieved , in essence , by replacing @xmath79 with @xmath83 in equation  [ eq : dsigdptsh ] .",
    "assuming , for the moment , that we are dealing with a shower algorithm ordered in transverse momentum , the generation of the first emission in mec is given by @xmath84 , \\quad\\delta({p_{\\rm t}})=\\exp\\left[-\\int \\frac{r}{b}\\delta({p_{\\rm t}}({\\phi_{\\rm r}})-{p_{\\rm t } } ) { { \\mathrm d}}{\\phi_{\\rm rad}}\\right]\\;.\\ ] ] the notation used in equation  [ eq : dsigmamec ] deserves some explanation .",
    "we write in a compact notation a fully differential cross section that can have different final states as a single formula .",
    "the first term in the square bracket represents the production of an event with the born kinematics , and phase space @xmath5 . in the higgs example",
    ", it represents a higgs boson with zero transverse momentum .",
    "the second term represents the full real process , with production of a higgs and a parton , balanced in transverse momentum .",
    "the above formula represents the probability that either event is produced .    the shower unitarity equation  [ eq : unitarity0 ] is then written in the general form @xmath85 where it is intended that the @xmath86 integration is limited to the region where @xmath87 .    in figure  [ fig : hsuda ]    we give a pictorial representation of the distribution of the transverse momentum of the higgs boson at fixed rapidity at nlo order ( i.e. @xmath71 ) , from the shower algorithm , and from a mec shower algorithm . for the nlo result",
    ", one should imagine that the nlo curve diverges at small @xmath41 up to a tiny cutoff , and that a tiny bin with a very large , negative value is located at @xmath88 .",
    "the resummation of collinear and soft singularities performed by the shower algorithm using the exact real emission cross section starts to differ from the lo one at @xmath41 around @xmath89  gev , and for smaller @xmath41 it tames the divergence of the nlo cross section .",
    "the shower approximation has the same behaviour for moderate to small @xmath41 , but it drops rapidly as @xmath41 approaches the maximum scale of radiation allowed by the shower algorithm ( an exact implementation of equation  [ eq : dsigdptsh ] would imply that the cross section vanishes exactly for @xmath90 .",
    "subsequent emissions in the shower process will tend to smear the region of @xmath91 ) .",
    "the area under the two shower curves equals the born cross section .",
    "the main objective of a nlo+ps implementation is to improve the shower approximation , in such away that it achieves nlo accuracy for inclusive quantities .",
    "thus , referring to figure  [ fig : hsuda ] , we would expect that the higgs transverse momentum distribution in an nlo+ps approach should have the smooth shape of the shower and mec approaches at small @xmath92 , should match ( up to even higher order terms ) the nlo calculation at large @xmath92 , and should have the total area of the curve equal to @xmath93 . in other words",
    "@xmath94 where @xmath95 is a rapidity and transverse momentum dependent @xmath96-factor .",
    "we require @xmath96 to be smooth for small @xmath92 , so that the smooth shape of the shower and mec approaches is preserved , and to be such that @xmath97 for example , we could require @xmath98 which , using the fact that @xmath99 satisfies equation  [ eq : nlopsnlo ] . with this choice",
    ", the large transverse momentum tail of the distribution differs from the pure nlo result by terms suppressed by a further power of @xmath55 , i.e. terms of nnlo order . but this does not spoil nlo accuracy , and it is therefore allowed . alternatively , the @xmath96 factor may also have some transverse momentum dependence , such that the corresponding curve in figure  [ fig : hsuda ] would be above the mec result for @xmath100 , but would approach it for larger transverse momenta .",
    "this nnlo ambiguity in the definition of an nlo+ps generator is unavoidable , and it should thus be kept in mind that different nlo+ps generators , besides differing because of different renormalization and factorization scale choices , and different shower algorithms , may also differ because of this .",
    "in the parton shower monte carlo approach , one starts from the born cross section @xmath101 and adds higher - order corrections in the shower approximation .",
    "if one started instead from the nlo cross section , there would be double counting because the showers would add terms that are already present in the nlo result .",
    "the aim of the mc@nlo scheme is to remove from the nlo expressions those terms that will be generated by the parton showers .",
    "this is achieved by modifying the subtraction terms of the nlo calculation .",
    "the method was worked out in detail in @xcite and applied there to vector boson pair production , then extended to heavy quark pair production in @xcite . in @xcite the decay",
    "angular correlations in these processes were added .",
    "single top quark production processes were implemented in @xcite .",
    "the present version  @xcite also includes the single and associated production of higgs and vector bosons .",
    "all these processes are implemented for hadron - hadron collisions .",
    "heavy quark photoproduction has been considered in @xcite . the amc@nlo project , developing a fully automated nlo event generator based on the mc@nlo scheme , with loop corrections from madloop @xcite using the opp method @xcite , has provided results on a range of more complex processes of interest  @xcite .",
    "a variant of the mc@nlo  approach has been implemented within the sherpa  event generator  @xcite .    referring to section  [ sec : shower ]",
    ", one can see that two types of nlo terms are generated by parton showering and need to be removed from the nlo calculation .    1 .",
    "a resolvable real emission gives rise to a positive term of the form in equation  [ eq : dsigcoll ] , which has to be subtracted from the corresponding term in equation  [ eq : dsignlo ] .",
    "that is , one must replace @xmath102 by @xmath103 .",
    "2 .   in addition",
    ", expansion of the sudakov form factor for no resolvable emission , @xmath104 in equation  [ eq : sudakov ] , to first order gives a negative term which is the integral of @xmath105 over the real emission phase space @xmath16 .",
    "thus in place of equation  [ eq : dsignlo ] one should start the parton shower monte carlo from the modified nlo cross section @xmath106 where the extra terms are understood to be summed over all coloured external lines of the born process . by comparison with equations  [ eq : onlo ] and [ eq : evnlo ]",
    ", one can see that this amounts to a modification of the counterterms @xmath22 in the subtraction method .",
    "it is clear that , upon integrating over the real emission phase space @xmath16 , equation  [ eq : dsigmcnlo ] reproduces the equivalent nlo cross section in equation  [ eq : dsignlo ] .",
    "however , it should be emphasised that @xmath107 as it stands does not represent a physical _ differential _ cross section : for example , the distribution of real emissions is completely wrong and must be supplemented by the emissions generated by a parton shower generator .",
    "furthermore equation  [ eq : dsigmcnlo ] is specific to a particular generator , represented by the label ( mc ) .",
    "for each shower generator , one must calculate analytically exactly what the program does at relative order @xmath55 and modify the nlo counterterms accordingly . at present",
    "there are complete mc@nloversions  @xcite for the herwig  @xcite and herwig++  @xcite event generators , while amc@nlo  is also available  @xcite for pythia  @xcite with virtuality - ordered parton showering .    in the analytical calculation of the modified counterterms , to avoid the useless generation of unresolvable emissions and cancelling virtual corrections , the resolution cutoff @xmath59 should be set to zero .",
    "this has the effect of cancelling the divergences of the pure nlo counterterms , provided the monte carlo distribution @xmath108 is accurate in the soft and collinear regions . in collinear regions , factorization of the cross section according to equation",
    "[ eq : pphi ] is exact and so the cancellation of collinear singularities is guaranteed . in soft , non - collinear regions , the azimuthal averaging of the splitting functions and the angular - ordering treatment of coherence used in the monte carlo",
    "mean that the cancellation of soft divergences occurs after integration over angles and not point - by - point .",
    "smoothing functions are therefore introduced to match the mc and nlo expressions in these regions .",
    "this is not a problem as physical observables are insensitive to the angles of soft gluon emission .",
    "in addition , the factorization of colour structure in equation  [ eq : pphi ] does not hold in general in soft , non - collinear regions , so there may be colour - suppressed contributions with non - cancelling sub - leading divergences , which give rise to power - suppressed corrections after smoothing and do not affect the nlo accuracy of predictions . a proof of this point",
    "is given in appendix [ sec : appendix ] .",
    "for technical details , see the appendices of refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the cancellation of divergences makes it possible to prepare separate samples of born - like and real emission configurations for processing by the shower generator , known as @xmath109 events and @xmath110 events respectively , each with finite weights equal to the relevant coefficient in equation  [ eq : dsigmcnlo ] .",
    "this is in contrast to a pure nlo calculation , where the positive divergences of the real emission distribution are cancelled by negatively divergent contributions in the born phase space .",
    "the @xmath109 and @xmath111 events can be unweighted , if desired , by accepting them in proportion to their weights before showering .",
    "however , these weights are not guaranteed to be positive , so some configurations generate counter - events that have to be subtracted rather than added in histograms . as can be seen from equation  [ eq : dsigmcnlo ] , provided the monte carlo is close to the true emission distribution in the important regions , the counter - events tend to be a small fraction of @xmath110 events that serve to correct predictions to the nlo level .",
    "in section  [ sec : sudakov ] we claimed that a nlo+ps generator should spread the nlo @xmath96 factor over a certain region of the transverse momentum distribution of the hardest radiation .",
    "if we dropped the second and third term in the first line of equation  [ eq : dsigmcnlo ] , the mc@nlo result would approach that of a mec accurate monte carlo , with the @xmath112 events being just the shower events , and the @xmath113 events correcting the shower hardest emission at large transverse momenta , in order to match the tree - level result .",
    "the integrated cross section would be near the born cross section .",
    "in fact , the second line of equation  [ eq : dsigmcnlo ] gives only a minor contribution to the integral , since it is non - vanishing only in the large transverse momentum region where the collinear approximation differs substantially from the tree - level matrix element . by including the full round bracket on the first line of equation  [ eq : dsigmcnlo ] , we increase only the @xmath112 contribution by a @xmath96 factor depending on the born kinematics @xmath5 .",
    "we thus see that in the mc@nlo case the @xmath96 factor acts uniformly over the @xmath41 region that is dominated by @xmath112 events , which typically extends out to @xmath41 values of the order of the hard scale of the process in question , while the region of harder emissions is not affected by it .    the practical implementation of the mc@nlo method proceeds as follows .",
    "the nlo part first performs the integrations necessary to determine the weights of the @xmath109 events and then generates the @xmath109 and @xmath110 events ( i.e.  born - like and born+one - parton configurations , respectively ) to serve as the starting - points of the corresponding mc generator .",
    "these may remain weighted or can be unweighted as described above . for the purposes of parton showering and hadronization",
    ", each event has to be assigned a unique colour flow , which corresponds to the large-@xmath114 limit of qcd , where @xmath114 is the number of colours . therefore a colour flow is selected according to their relative probabilities in the large-@xmath114 limit of the corresponding born or real emission matrix element .",
    "however , it should be emphasised that the sum of all colour flows reproduces the full nlo result , including all subleading @xmath114 dependence .",
    "each coloured external line of the event can then be processed by the shower generator in the normal way . in particular , there is no restriction that shower emissions from @xmath110 events should be softer than the extra parton emitted at the nlo level , because the weights of those events are computed assuming unrestricted showering .",
    "however , @xmath110 events are not singular in the collinear and soft regions , and thus their contribution to those regions is phase - space suppressed , so that the cross section for producing events in which the shower generates radiation much harder than that generated in the @xmath110 configuration is power suppressed .",
    "figure  [ fig : mcatnlotop ] shows some mc@nlo results on top quark pair production at the lhc , compared with those obtained at nlo and with herwig .",
    "the mc@nlo and herwig results , but not of course the nlo ones , include parton showering and hadronization",
    ". for ease of comparison , the herwig results have been rescaled by @xmath115 , so that all plots have the same normalization .",
    "for the inclusive transverse momentum and rapidity distributions of the top quark , higher - order corrections tend to have a global effect without causing much change of shape in the distributions , and consequently the results of all three approaches are similar . it should be noted , however , that the mc@nlo results are more stable than pure nlo with respect to statistical fluctuations .",
    "this is due to the absence of divergences in the weights within the @xmath109 and @xmath110 event samples separately , rather than cancellation of oppositely divergent weights between the two samples .",
    "thus it can happen that a given statistically significance is achieved more quickly , in spite of the extra computation involved in parton showering .    for quantities sensitive to correlations between the top quark and antiquark , differences are more apparent .",
    "the mc@nlo prediction for the transverse momentum distribution of the pair follows the nlo result at high @xmath41 , while the herwig distribution , generated by parton showering alone , falls off rapidly at values above the top quark mass . at low @xmath41 the opposite is the case , as @xmath109 events dominate and the distribution is controlled by parton showering , so that mc@nlo agrees with the ( rescaled ) monte carlo prediction . on the other hand , both nlo and herwig fall below the mc@nlo prediction at low values of the azimuthal angle between the pair , where both single hard and multiple soft emissions contribute .",
    "the basic idea in powheg ( the acronym stands for positive weight hardest emission generator ) is to generate the hardest radiation first , and then feed the event to any shower generator for subsequent , softer radiation . in shower generators ordered in transverse momenta , the hardest emission is always the first , and in this case",
    "powheg simply replaces the hardest emission with its own , nlo accurate emission . in angular ordered showers",
    ", the hardest radiation may not be the first , and , as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , the inclusion of so - called `` truncated showers '' , to be discussed in section  [ sec : truncated ] , is needed to restore soft coherence in these cases . in powheg events",
    "can be produced with positive ( constant ) weight .",
    "furthermore , since the algorithm does not depend upon a particular parton shower program , the powheg output can be easily interfaced to any modern shower generator that is capable of handling user processes ( typically those that comply with the les houches interface for user s processes  @xcite ) .    the first proofs of concept of powheg were the implementation of @xmath116 pair production in hadronic collisions  @xcite , followed by the implementation of heavy flavour production  @xcite .",
    "the method was described in great details in ref .",
    "drell - yan vector boson production  @xcite , higgs boson production via gluon fusion  @xcite and single - top production  @xcite were soon implemented . in ref .",

    "this event is then fed to a shower monte carlo , which is required not to generate any radiation with larger transverse momentum . because of the presence of the cutoff @xmath59 , a small fraction of events without radiation will also be generated .",
    "in this case , also the shower will not generate radiation .",

    "one can then drop the @xmath131 ratio and the sudakov form factor in this term , since they both differ from unity by higher - order terms , which lead to corrections of order higher than nlo . finally , replacing @xmath132 with its explicit expression",

    "we assume that some sort of infrared regulator is applied to the virtual term and to the integral of the real term , so that infrared cancellation takes place as usual for infrared insensitive quantities .",
    "as we will see in the following , further showering is forced to be softer than the hardest radiation in powheg , so that ir - safe observables are affected by it only at a subleading level .",
    "it is interesting to ask ourselves what happens if we take the limit @xmath134 .",
    "it turns out that the @xmath132 function will develop a negative infinity , since the integration of @xmath121 has a positive soft - collinear singularities that cancels an analogous negative singularity in the virtual term .",
    "by gradually reducing @xmath121 , the negative infinity in @xmath28 will be gradually exposed .",
    "it is also clear that the transverse momentum distribution will approach more and more the nlo result , and the proof of nlo accuracy that we have just given guarantees that the nlo result is recovered .",
    "from this discussion , it becomes clear that @xmath135 should be such that the nice shape of the @xmath41 distribution in the region of the resummation should not be spoiled , i.e. @xmath135 can not be taken too small .",
    "the powheg generated event is fed to a general - purpose shower monte carlo ( smc ) such as herwig or pythia for the generation of the rest of the parton shower and hadronization .",
    "care must be taken , however , that the smc should not generate radiation with transverse momenta larger than that of the initial parton .",
    "an smc complying with the les houches interface for user processes ( lhiup from now on ) can be easily instructed to do so , just by setting the common block variable scalup to the transverse momentum of the powheg generated radiation .",
    "when we talk about the transverse momentum generated by the smc , we mean here either the transverse momentum with respect to the beam axis , for initial state radiation partons , or the transverse momentum with respect to a final state parton , if the emission is from a final state parton .",
    "observe that , in the case of no radiation ( i.e.  the event consists of the higgs boson alone ) , scalup has to be set to such a small value that further radiation from the smc is essentially prohibited . in the following",
    "we will refer to the event generated by powheg as the les houches event ( lhe ) , precisely because powheg passes the event to the smc by using the lhiup .",
    "we will not try to illustrate here how the powheg event is generated in practice .",
    "the interested reader can look at the first powheg implementation @xcite , or at the general powheg papers @xcite for details .",
    "we only note here that , besides generating the event kinematics , one must also assign colour to the final state partons , according to the lhiup convention .",
    "the only requirement for the correctness of the powheg procedure is that colour assignment should be at least as accurate as in a shower monte carlo . in the powheg box , for example ,",
    "a process - specific routine assigns the colour to the underlying born configuration .",
    "this is generally done in the large @xmath136 limit , but subleading colour connections may also be included , if desired .",
    "the powheg box then assigns colour to the generated hardest emission configuration , assuming the large-@xmath136 limit colour assignment in collinear radiation that is used in parton shower algorithms .",
    "in order to claim nlo accuracy , an nlo+ps generator must make some use of nlo accurate parton densitites . in both mc@nlo and powheg",
    "the generation process begins with the calculation of an inclusive cross section , which is given by the two terms in round bracket in equation  [ eq : dsigmcnlo ] for mc@nlo , and by the calculation of @xmath137 and @xmath120 ( see equation  [ eq : dsigdptpwh ] ) in powheg .",
    "the @xmath137 function in powheg , as well as the term in round bracket in the first line of equation  [ eq : dsigmcnlo ] in mc@nlo , must be computed using nlo accurate parton density functions ( pdfs ) . strictly speaking ,",
    "this is not needed for the @xmath120 term in powheg and for the @xmath113 events in mc@nlo ( i.e.  for the second line of equation  [ eq : dsigmcnlo ] ) , although in practice nlo pdfs are also alway used there .",
    "parton densities also play a role in the generation of radiation via backward evolution in mc@nlo .",
    "in powheg they play a role in the generation of the hardest radiation for initial - state radiation , and subsequently in the smc that takes care of the rest of the radiation . in these steps ,",
    "nlo pdfs are not needed .",
    "the key observation needed to justify the above statements is that nlo pdfs are needed when they multiply a contribution to the cross section that is of leading order .",
    "for example , in higgs production , nlo pdfs are needed in the contributions to the cross section that start at order @xmath138 .",
    "this is because nlo and lo pdfs differ by terms of order @xmath55 , which multiplied by a term of order @xmath138 lead a term of nlo accuracy . in the nlo+ps generators this is only the case for the @xmath112 and @xmath139 cross sections in mc@nlo and powheg , respectively . in mc@nlo",
    "it is in general preferred to run the shower stage using the mc internal pdf s , although a user can optionally use the same nlo pdfs used in the nlo calculation . in powheg ,",
    "the generation of the hardest radiation is usually performed using the nlo pdfs , although other choices are possible .",
    "basic processes that include narrow resonance decays can be dealt with in a standard way in both mc@nlo and powheg , considering the decay as part of the born process .",
    "thus , for example , for @xmath140 production , one can consider @xmath141 . in this way",
    ", the angular correlation of the final state decay products with the rest of the event are accounted for correctly .    in the case of the production of spinless particles , as in higgs production",
    ", it is always more convenient to treat the decay at a later stage , since the production formulae are simpler for the undecayed object , and the whole process implementation becomes simpler .",
    "one first generates the resonance , and then replaces it with its decay products , distributed isotropically in its rest frame .",
    "the same procedure can also be applied to the production and decay of resonances with spin , but , in doing so , one loses spin correlations .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , a method for the inclusion of spin correlations in the decay of resonances in monte carlos , applicable also to nlo+ps implementations , has been introduced .",
    "in essence , the method works as follows .",
    "the mc@nlo framework generates an event to be passed to the shower monte carlo , which is simply the partonic born configuration in the case of @xmath112 events , or the born configuration plus the radiation of one parton in @xmath113 events .",
    "the idea is essentially to complete the partonic event by letting the heavy resonance decay and weighting the angular distribution of its decay products according to the corresponding tree - level matrix element .",
    "this procedure certainly captures correctly the born level angular distribution , and , for hard radiation , also the correct correlation when an associated hard jet is produced .",
    "the same procedure can be applied to the powheg case . in powheg , most events include the hardest radiation . in this case",
    "the correlation is retained even if the radiated parton is near the collinear region , or very soft .",
    "it should be kept in mind , however , that the procedure of ref .",
    "@xcite does not include the full nlo correction to correlations , since the spin dependence of the virtual corrections is not fully accounted for",
    ".    in final state resonance decays into coloured particles , like @xmath142 , or top production and decays , the same method can be , and in fact is , used .",
    "chain decays , such as @xmath143 , are also handled .",
    "however , next - to - leading corrections to the decay process are not included .",
    "thus , for example , in the implementation of heavy flavour production in mc@nlo and powheg , the top decay is only handled at the leading - order level , and only at this level are spin correlations accounted for correctly .",
    "the discussion given so far has focussed upon a relatively simple process , where only initial - state collinear radiation has to be dealt with . in general ,",
    "final - state massless partons may also be present , and should be properly considered .",
    "typically , processes like single top production , or higgs production via vector boson fusion , have final - state light partons that can emit collinear radiation . in processes of associated jet production , like vector boson plus one jet production , or dijet production",
    ", one has the further complication that the born cross section itself is divergent , unless some transverse momentum cut on the jet kinematics is imposed .",
    "all these issue add practical complexity to the nlo+ps implementation .",
    "however , no conceptual complexity arises : the same method used in the simplest cases can be applied in the most complex ones .",
    "the key observation is that the real cross section can be split into a sum of contributions with specific flavour structure that are singular in one collinear region only .",
    "one writes @xmath144 where each @xmath145 labels a particular flavour structure and a singular region of the real amplitude , and the @xmath146 is required to be singular only in the corresponding region .",
    "considering , for example , @xmath147 production , the real - emission flavour structure @xmath148 has the following singular configurations : the first emitted gluon may have vanishing transverse momentum ( i.e. it is soft or collinear to either of the initial - state partons ) , the second emitted gluon may have vanishing transverse momentum , or the two emitted gluons may have small relative angle",
    ". the full cross section for the @xmath148 process may be written as @xmath149 with @xmath150 , where @xmath151 is the transverse momentum of the first gluon , @xmath152 is the transverse momentum of the second gluon , and @xmath153 is the relative transverse momentum of the two final state gluons .",
    "it is clear that @xmath57 is singular only when the first gluon is collinear to either initial - state parton , @xmath154 is singular only when the second gluon is collinear to either initial - state parton , and @xmath155 is singular only if the two final - state gluons are collinear to each other .",
    "notice also that the soft singularities are partitioned among the different collinear regions , but that in all cases nothing is omitted , since the sum of the three contribution yields the total real amplitude by construction . both powheg and",
    "mc@nlo adopt a similar separation of the collinear regions . in the computation of the @xmath112 events in mc@nlo , the third term on the first line of equation",
    "[ eq : dsigmcnlo ] should include all contributions arising from the shower , i.e.  initial - state radiation and final - state radiation .",
    "the term on the second line of equation  [ eq : dsigmcnlo ] is instead split into all singular components of @xmath18 , and each component is accompanied by the corresponding mc component .",
    "thus , for example , the final - state radiation contribution will have the structure @xmath156 where @xmath16 refer here to the final - state radiation variables , and @xmath157 refers to the monte carlo implementation of the final - state splitting process .",
    "notice that the nlo and mc terms in equation  [ eq : r3-rmc ] must be expressed in terms of the same variables , including appropriate jacobian factors .    in powheg ,",
    "in the case of multiple singular regions , one must first of all define the appropriate @xmath137 function as @xmath158 here @xmath159 represents a specific born flavour configuration , and the notation @xmath160 stands for all @xmath145 such that @xmath161 has @xmath159 as flavour of the underlying born configuration .",
    "notice that the mapping of @xmath5 and @xmath16 into the full real phase space also depends upon the particular singular contribution that we are considering , and the superscript @xmath145 on @xmath16 is there to remind us of this fact .",
    "we can think of the @xmath162 as the inclusive nlo cross section at fixed underlying born flavour @xmath159 and kinematics @xmath5 .",
    "of course , the definition of the underlying born structure also depends upon the separation of the real cross section @xmath18 into the singular components @xmath161 , and upon the mapping that is used in a particular singular region for constructing the real phase space out of the underlying born phase space and the radiation variables .",
    "a detailed description of the decomposition equation  [ eq : singdecomp ] and of the mappings is given in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the generation of radiation in powheg , once the underlying born kinematics and flavour structure have been generated , is obtained using as sudakov form factor the expression @xmath163 again , the sum in the exponent is over all @xmath145 such that @xmath161 has @xmath159 as the flavour of the underlying born configuration , and the integral is performed at fixed underlying born configuration .",
    "the function @xmath164 is the radiation transverse momentum , i.e.  the transverse momentum of the radiated parton in initial - state radiation , and the transverse momentum of the radiated parton relative to a final - state parton in final - state radiation , and for this reason it depends upon the singular region under consideration .",
    "the sudakov form factor in equation  [ eq : sudcomplex ] is the probability that no radiation , either initial- or final - state , from any of the final - state partons , has @xmath165 larger than @xmath41 . in practice , in order to generate the radiation , the full sudakov form factor is decomposed in the product of sudakov form factors for each @xmath161 contribution .",
    "according to standard monte carlo methods , the generation of @xmath41 according to equation  [ eq : sudcomplex ] ) can be performed by generating a @xmath41 using each sudakov form factor , and picking the largest .",
    "the generation of the contribution of the non - singular @xmath120 terms does not present any particular problem .",
    "in angular - ordered showers , like those in herwig and herwig++ , the hardest emission during the shower development may not necessarily be the first in the shower chain . as seen in section  [ sec : shower ] , angular ordering allows softer , larger - angle emission to take place earlier in the shower development , in order to account for coherent soft gluon emission from a bunch of collinear partons .",
    "these soft , large - angle emissions see the bunch of collinear emitting partons as a single coherent colour source , its colour being that of the parent parton of the bunch . this is why the shower can treat these emissions as if they were coming from a single parton . in ref .",
    "@xcite , it was shown that even in the case of angular - ordered showers , the hardest parton emission is described , up to subleading corrections , by the equation @xmath166 , \\nonumber \\\\",

    "it was thus suggested that the herwig shower was equivalent to a shower initiated by equation  [ eq : hardestmc ] ) , which we call in the following the initial process , with the remaining radiation provided as follows :    i a shower initiated at an angle determined by the underlying born configuration of the initial process , stopping at an angle equal to that of the emission in the initial process , vetoing radiation harder ( i.e.  with larger transverse momentum ) than the initial - process radiation .",
    "this shower was called a vetoed truncated shower in ref .  @xcite .",
    "ii all partons produced in the initial process are allowed to radiate with standard angular - order initial conditions , but radiation with transverse momentum larger than that of the initial process is vetoed .",
    "the vetoed truncated shower described in item i is needed in order to supply the soft , coherent radiation that can be emitted at large angles by the splitting partons associated with the hardest emission .",
    "an angular - ordered shower algorithm generates this radiation first , so the hardest emission may take place later in the shower . if instead the shower is started with the hardest emission , this coherent radiation must be added explicitly .    in ref .",
    "@xcite it was proposed to implement a positive weights nlo+ps generator by generating the initial process with the powheg method , and to complete the shower according to the prescriptions i and ii .",
    "it was also pointed out that vetoed - truncated showers are not really specific requirements of powheg , but that they also appear naturally in the ckkw matrix - element to shower matching ( me+ps ) . in ref .",
    "@xcite , an implementation of ckkw matching using truncated showers has been proposed in the herwig++ framework .",
    "an implementation of truncated showers in the sherpa framework has been proposed in @xcite .",
    "however , since sherpa uses a transverse momentum ordered dipole shower , one can no longer claim that truncated showers are needed there to restore the coherence of soft emission .",
    "in the present section we compare and contrast the mc@nlo and powheg  methods . as discussed in section  [ sec : truncated ] , it was shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that the herwig shower could be replaced by a shower where the hardest emission is generated first , and that the hardest emission , up to subleading corrections , is described by equation  [ eq : hardestmc ] .",
    "it then follows that , up to their nominal accuracy , we can identify the mc@nlo prescription with a powheg implementation having @xmath167 , where the @xmath109 and the @xmath110 events in mc@nlo are identified with the s and f events respectively in powheg .",
    "this reasoning provides an alternative to the proof in ref .",
    "@xcite of the correctness of the mc@nlo procedure by showing that it is equivalent to a powheg approach , so that the proof of nlo accuracy for inclusive observables used for powheg also applies .",
    "furthermore , it allows us to better understand the similarities and differences between the two approaches .",
    "as will be made clear , they can mostly be traced back to differences between @xmath121 and @xmath108 .",
    "detailed comparisons of mc@nlo and powheg were carried out in refs .",
    "remarkable agreement was found for inclusive quantities , i.e.  quantities that are inclusive in the hardest jet being radiated .",
    "discrepancies were found in the kinematics of the hardest jet , especially for processes with a very large nlo @xmath96 factor , like higgs production .",
    "we will focus now upon these distributions , bearing in mind that all the discrepancies reflect differences in the estimation of corrections that are beyond the formal accuracy of the two approaches .",
    "we begin by showing the transverse momentum distribution of the higgs in the left plot of figure  [ fig : mcatnloptdy ] .",
    "the powheg and mc@nlo predictions agree for moderate transverse momenta . for large transverse momenta powheg",
    "gives a larger results , with the upper powheg prediction ( corresponding to @xmath168 ) in the last bin in the plot being above mc@nlo by roughly a factor of three .",
    "this difference can be understood as due to the part of the transverse momentum spectrum that is amplified by the nlo @xmath96 factor in the two programs . for transverse momenta below about 100  gev ,",
    "the mc@nlo result is dominated by @xmath112 events , and is thus equal to the pure herwig result multiplied by an nlo @xmath96-factor . at larger transverse momenta ,",
    "the @xmath113 events start to contribute , and eventually dominate the spectrum . the difference with respect to powheg is due to the fact that in the latter , for @xmath168",
    ", one chooses @xmath169 and @xmath170 .",
    "therefore , the nlo @xmath96 factor multiplies uniformly the whole transverse momentum distribution , amplifying it by a factor of order 2 , even in the region of high transverse momenta , where mc@nlo is dominated by @xmath113 events and no @xmath96-factor is present .",
    "notice also that the powheg prediction with @xmath171  gev is below the @xmath168 prediction by almost a factor of @xmath172 , since with this choice that region is dominated by @xmath173 events .",
    "a remaining factor of about @xmath174 arises from the fact that mc@nlo uses as default central value for the factorization and renormalization scales the higgs transverse mass @xmath175 , while in powheg the higgs mass is used .",
    "it is easily seen that , for the given choice of center - of - mass energy and higgs mass , the gluon density is quite insensitive to the factorization scale , and the whole remaining effect is due to the different choices of renormalization scale in the @xmath176 dependence of the cross section at large transverse momentum .",
    "we report in the figure also mc@nlo with no nlo terms included in the @xmath112 events . in this way",
    ", one gets essentially the mec corrected spectrum , with the hard tail matching the fixed - order nlo result , but the total rate nearly equal to the lo result .",
    "we can see that this result is closer in shape to the powheg result , the difference being due to the different renormalization scale choice .",
    "the right plot of equation  [ fig : mcatnloptdy ] shows the distribution in the rapidity difference between the hardest jet and the higgs boson for a jet @xmath41 cut of 20 gev . in this case",
    ", the pure herwig result has a dip at zero rapidity difference , a feature due to the shower approximation , since radiation is built from the independent radiations of the two incoming partons .",
    "this feature is somewhat sensitive to the shower generator  ( see e.g. @xcite ) . from the figure it is apparent that in the mc@nlo result with no nlo correction to the @xmath112 events , the inclusion of the @xmath113 events corrects almost completely for this effect",
    "this is not unexpected , since the @xmath113 events are generated with a distribution equal to the difference between the real one - parton emission and the herwig approximation to it . in the full mc@nlo result , however , @xmath112 events are amplified by the large @xmath96 factor , which amplifies the dip in the @xmath41 region where @xmath112 events contribute significantly , and the @xmath113 events , which are not multiplied by the same @xmath96 factor , can no longer compensate for it .",
    "notice however that this effect is in fact of order @xmath177 , i.e.  it is beyond the nlo approximation .",
    "it was first noticed in ref .",
    "@xcite in the framework of @xmath178 production .",
    "an explanation of the effect along the lines reported here has been given in refs .",
    "even if somewhat extreme , the effect is within the uncertainties due to unknown nnlo terms .",
    "it unfortunately affects the shape in an unphysical way , since no behaviour of this kind is observed in the @xmath179 calculation of the higgs plus one jet cross section .",
    "it reminds us , however , that also the shape of distributions is subject to the same nnlo uncertainties as those affecting the total cross section .",
    "several uncertainties affect nlo+ps generators .",
    "some of them are specific to the shower and hadronization parts , and others are related to the parameterization of the parton densities and to the chosen value for the strong coupling constant . here",
    "we want to focus upon the uncertainties that are characteristic of the qcd nlo calculation . we know that factorization and renormalization scale uncertainties will play an important role in estimating the effect of higher order terms .",
    "there are , however , other sources of uncertainty that are specific to the nlo+ps algorithms , and in fact to all nlo calculations that are improved with the leading log resummation of soft gluons effects . as discussed in section  [ sec : sudakov ] , the distribution of the transverse momentum of the radiation has a singularity at zero momentum , and the value of the nlo corrections is determined by the interplay of the soft divergences in the virtual corrections and of the singularity of the real cross section at zero transverse momenta . on the other hand , nlo+ps generators , as well as resummation formulae , turn this singularity into a smooth curve .",
    "nlo effects are thus spread over a wider region , and a further scale will implicitly appear to delimit this range .",
    "we have seen in the previous section that this implicit scale is the cutoff scale for the mc radiation in mc@nlo ( the higgs mass in the higgs production example ) , while it can be up to the kinematic limit for the transverse momentum of radiation in powheg .",
    "nlo uncertainties for quantities that are inclusive in the hardest radiation can safely be estimated using standard scale variation .",
    "on the other hand , for quantities that are sensitive to the hardest radiation some care is needed .",
    "in fact , for @xmath112 or s events in mc@nlo or powheg respectively , the shape of the transverse momentum distribution of the hardest radiation is unaffected by scale variation . in practice ,",
    "scale variation in the square bracket on the r.h.s . of equation  [ eq : dsigdptpwh ]",
    "is never performed , since by doing it one easily spoils the nll accuracy of the sudakov form factor .",
    "similarly , a scale variation of the corresponding term in mc@nlo is never performed , since it can only be achieved by changing the scale in the monte carlo event generator that is being used .",
    "thus , the scale variation in the @xmath139 events in powheg , and in the @xmath112 events in mc@nlo , only affects the @xmath137 prefactor .",
    "this implies that the effect of scale variation on @xmath139 ( or @xmath112 ) events is of relative order @xmath138 , while that of @xmath173 ( or @xmath113 ) events is of relative order @xmath55 .",
    "this point can be better illustrated as follows .",
    "the @xmath137 prefactor is of order @xmath138 at the born level , and it includes nlo corrections , of order @xmath180 .",
    "its scale variation must therefore be of order @xmath177 , i.e.  beyond its nominal accuracy .",
    "therefore the relative scale variation @xmath181 is of order @xmath138 . on the other hand ,",
    "the @xmath173(@xmath113 ) term is of order @xmath180 , and its scale variation is of order @xmath177 , so its relative scale variation is of order @xmath55 .",
    "thus , the larger the contribution to the transverse momentum distribution coming from @xmath139 ( or @xmath112 ) events , the smaller its relative scale dependence will be . in the following , we will focus on this problem , taking as an example the transverse momentum distribution of the higgs boson .",
    "this can also be computed ( using the hqt program @xcite ) at a matched nnll+nnlo accuracy , and can thus serve as a benchmark for assessing how realistic are the nnlo terms introduced by the nlo+ps approaches .",
    "we will include in our calculation the perturbative uncertainty determined by scale variation .",
    "the studies reported here are taken from ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the plots that follow have all been obtained with the following settings .",
    "we have used the mstw2008 nnlo central pdf set  @xcite for all curves .",
    "this is because hqt requires nnlo parton densities , and because we want to focus upon differences that have to do with the calculation itself , rather than the pdfs .",
    "the hqt result has been obtained by running the program with full nnll+nnlo accuracy , using the `` switched '' result .",
    "the resummation scale @xmath50 in hqt has been set to @xmath182 .",
    "the bands shown in the figures for hqt , powheg and mc@nlo are all obtained by varying the factorization and renormalization scales by a factor of two above and below their default central value , imposing the constraint @xmath183 .",
    "in the mc@nlo case , the independent scale variation is not performed , and only equal scales are used .",
    "it is instructive to analyze the difference between mc@nlo and powheg at their default value of parameters .",
    "this is illustrated in figure  [ fignlomc : pthdefault ] .    as shown earlier ,",
    "a large difference in the high transverse momentum tail is visible .",
    "as can be seen immediately , when the uncertainty bands due to scale variations are included , the differences between the two nlo+ps methods , and their differences with respect to the hqt result , become less pronounced .",
    "the observation made earlier on the insensitivity of the shape of the @xmath41 distribution contributed by @xmath139 ( or @xmath112 ) events is also visible , with the powheg shape being constant for all transverse momenta , and the mc@nlo shape being roughly constant in the region dominated by @xmath113 events .",
    "it is also seen that the scale uncertainty in powheg corresponds to a uniform factor in the whole range of transverse momentum being considered .    in order to give a more realistic assessment of the uncertainties in powheg",
    ", one can also exploit the freedom in the separation @xmath184 . in the case of higgs production",
    ", it is found that by choosing @xmath185 , the powheg result closely matches in shape that of hqt .",
    "it is similarly found that mc@nlo better matches the hqt output if @xmath78 , rather than @xmath186 , is used as central scale for scale variations .",
    "these results are shown in figure  [ fignlomc : ptmcatnlomh ] .",
    "we see that now the large differences between mc@nlo and powheg are mostly removed , since both adopt a central scale equal to @xmath78 , and both adopt a similar separation of @xmath139 ( or @xmath112 ) and @xmath173 ( or @xmath113 ) events .",
    "both generators , furthermore , display a reasonable scale variation in the high @xmath41 regime , while the scale variation at moderate values of transverse momenta ( around 100 gev ) seems to be comparable to that of hqt , rather than being larger .    in mc@nlo",
    ", we have seen that the shape of the transverse momentum spectrum at moderate @xmath41 exhibits only a mild dependence upon scale variation .",
    "this shape is in fact determined by @xmath112 events , and thus depends only upon the shower monte carlo that is being used , which is herwig in the present case",
    ". we may expect significant changes in shape if other monte carlos are used . in figure  [ fig : mcnlopy ] we display    the higgs @xmath41 spectrum using mc@nlo with the virtuality - ordered version of pythia  @xcite .",
    "we do indeed see a considerable difference in the spectrum at small transverse momenta .",
    "the discrepancy with hqt  at small transverse momenta is purely due to the fact that the virtuality - ordered version of pythia does not match well with hqt  at small transverse momenta .",
    "matching tree - level matrix elements and parton shower generators ( me+ps ) allows for the generation of samples where a basic process is accompanied by a fairly large number of associated jets .",
    "the me+ps method was first formulated in ref .",
    "@xcite ( ckkw ) , and several variants have appeared since ( for a summary of the various implementations see refs .",
    "@xcite ) . as a representative example , taking @xmath187 boson production as the basic process , the method allows one to construct a sample of @xmath187 with an arbitrary number of associated jets , where the distributions of the first @xmath32 jets ( @xmath32 being limited by the computing power available ) are computed with tree - level accuracy , and the remaining ones are generated in the collinear approximation .",
    "the me+ps method does not achieve nlo accuracy for any quantity .",
    "however , it can not be claimed that the nlo+ps methods are the nlo extension of the me+ps method . in the example of @xmath187 production",
    ", an nlo+ps implementation of @xmath187 production can be used to produce a sample such that inclusive @xmath187 distributions , such as the @xmath187 rapidity distribution , are accurate at the nlo level . on the other hand ,",
    "@xmath188jet production is described by this sample at order @xmath55 , i.e. with the same level of accuracy as an me+ps implementation .",
    "furthermore , @xmath189 or more jets is generated in the nlo+ps only with shower accuracy , i.e.  in the collinear approximation , while in the me+ps sample it is generated with tree - level accuracy .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , the alpgen me+ps generator was presented and a thorough comparison with mc@nlo was performed for top production .",
    "figure  [ fig : mcatnloalpgen ] shows the    main features of the comparison .",
    "good agreement is found for inclusive quantities like the top quark transverse momentum distribution , provided that alpgen ( which does not include nlo corrections ) is rescaled by a @xmath96 factor .",
    "once the @xmath96 factor is accounted for , the zero- and one - jet cross sections agree reasonably in the two approaches . at larger jet multiplicities",
    "we expect and see discrepancies between the two approaches , alpgen being more reliable in this case as it does not use the collinear approximation for the production of extra jets .",
    "the present nlo+ps implementations leave much room for improvement , and several papers in the literature propose new approaches . first of all , it would be desirable to merge the nlo+ps and me+ps methods , in such a way that higher jet multiplicities are described at tree - level accuracy while inclusive observables maintain nlo accuracy .",
    "a further goal is the full extension of the me+ps method to nlo , and several proposals in this direction have appeared in the literature @xcite .",
    "fixed - order nnlo calculations have become available for some collider processes , and their implementation in a shower framework would be welcome .",
    "finally , a full extension of the shower algorithm to nlo , i.e. including nlo splitting kernels is being pursued @xcite .    besides pursuing new approaches",
    ", one can also investigate to what extent some of these objectives can be approached by simply merging event samples obtained with available tools . in ref .",
    "@xcite , a recipe for merging a powheg together with a madgraph me+ps sample is given for the cases of @xmath187 and @xmath178 production , and in ref .",
    "@xcite a practical recipe is presented for merging the @xmath116 and @xmath190-jet powheg samples .",
    "we are grateful to stefano frixione for helpful comments .",
    "bw acknowledges the support of a leverhulme trust emeritus fellowship , and thanks the cern theory group for hospitality during part of this work .",
    "in this appendix we demonstrate that the smoothing procedure used in mc@nlo to cure an imperfect cancellation of soft divergences between @xmath18 and @xmath108 has only power - suppressed effects on infrared - safe observables .",
    "although this is a technical point , we include it here just as an example of how the method used to prove nlo accuracy in section  [ sec : powheg ] can also be applied to other important issues .",
    "first of all , in section  [ sec : truncated ] we have shown that mc@nlo is equivalent to a powheg generator with @xmath167 , and thus the proof of nlo accuracy given in section  [ sec : powheg ] can also be applied for mc@nlo .",
    "assume that the shower approximation for the real cross section is matched to the exact real cross section at a scale @xmath191 , i.e.  that for transverse momentum of the radiation below @xmath191 , @xmath192 is smoothly matched to @xmath18 .",
    "we write @xmath193 for the matched cross section .",
    "the proof of nlo accuracy in section  [ sec : powheg ] goes more or less as before , and by the time we reach equation  [ eq : nloaccuracy ] , it has the following form @xmath194 o ( \\phi_{{\\mathrm{b } } } ) + \\int    { \\mathrm{d}}\\phi_{\\mathrm{r } } r^{{\\ensuremath{\\operatorname{mc } } } } ( o ( \\phi_r ) - o ( \\phi_{{\\mathrm{b } } } ) )    \\nonumber\\\\    & + & \\int { \\mathrm{d}}\\phi_{\\mathrm{r } } \\left [ r - r^{{\\ensuremath{\\operatorname{mc}}}}_m \\right ] o    ( \\phi_r ) \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we have assumed that @xmath193 replaces @xmath192 in the @xmath109 events cross section @xmath195 , and in @xmath196 , which is the cross section for @xmath110 events .",
    "each term in equation  [ eq : appa1 ] is finite , since @xmath193 matches @xmath18 in the singular region .",
    "we can easily manipulate equation  [ eq : appa1 ] as follows : @xmath197 o ( \\phi_{{\\mathrm{b } } } ) + \\int { \\mathrm{d}}\\phi_{\\mathrm{r } } r^{{\\ensuremath{\\operatorname{mc } } } } ( o ( \\phi_r ) - o ( \\phi_{{\\mathrm{b } } } ) ) \\nonumber\\\\    & + & \\int { \\mathrm{d}}\\phi_{\\mathrm{r } } \\left [ r - r^{{\\ensuremath{\\operatorname{mc}}}}_m \\right ]     \\left [ o ( \\phi_r ) - o ( \\phi_{{\\mathrm{b } } } ) \\right ] , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where , with respect to equation  [ eq : appa1 ] , the term proportional to @xmath198 subtracted from the last term has been added to the first , and finally @xmath199 o ( \\phi_{{\\mathrm{b } } } ) + \\int { \\mathrm{d}}\\phi_{\\mathrm{r } } r ( o ( \\phi_r ) - o ( \\phi_{{\\mathrm{b } } } ) ) \\nonumber\\\\    & + & \\int { \\mathrm{d}}\\phi_{\\mathrm{r } } \\left [ r^{{\\ensuremath{\\operatorname{mc } } } } - r^{{\\ensuremath{\\operatorname{mc}}}}_m    \\right ]   \\left [ o ( \\phi_r ) - o ( \\phi_{{\\mathrm{b } } } ) \\right ] .",
    "\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the first line in equation  [ eq : appa3 ] corresponds to the exact nlo result , and the last line corresponds to the correction due to the smoothing procedure .",
    "now we suppose that @xmath200 $ ] is singular in the singular region .",
    "however , @xmath201 $ ] kills the singularity for infrared - safe observables , so , the integrand in equation  [ eq : appa3 ] is finite",
    ". furthermore it vanishes if the transverse momentum of radiation is above @xmath191 , because @xmath202 in that case .",
    "thus we have a power of @xmath191 suppression , where the exact power depends upon how smoothly @xmath203 approaches @xmath204 near the singular region .",

    "<S> we review the methods developed for combining the parton shower approximation to qcd with fixed - order perturbation theory , in such a way as to achieve next - to - leading - order ( nlo ) accuracy for inclusive observables . </S>",
    "<S> this has made it possible to generate fully - simulated hadronic final states with the precision and stability of nlo calculations . </S>",
    "<S> we explain the underlying theory of the existing methods , mc@nlo  and powheg , together with their similarities , differences , achievements and limitations . for illustration </S>",
    "<S> we mainly compare results on higgs boson production at the lhc , with particular emphasis on the residual uncertainties arising from the different treatment of effects beyond nlo . </S>",
    "<S> we also briefly summarize the difference between these nlo + parton shower methods and matrix - element + parton shower matching , and current efforts to combine the two approaches .    </S>",
