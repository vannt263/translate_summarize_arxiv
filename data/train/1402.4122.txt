    "recently , many theoretical and experimental efforts have been paid to the detection of majorana zero modes for the potential application @xcite . for the @xmath0 sc ,",
    "a single vortex associates a rigorous majorana zero energy bound state .",
    "however , when taking two vortices nearby , the inter - vortex tunneling occurs and leads to a small energy splitting which removes the ground state degeneracy . once the vortex is arranged regularly forming vortex lattice with vortex superlattice constant being the order of superconducting coherent length , the inter - vortex tunneling will modify the low energy band of @xmath0 sc and induce mid - gap states .    in this paper",

    "there exist two distinct phases , the weak pairing sc and the strong pairing sc , which are distinguished topologically .",
    "then , we analyze the bogoliubov - de gennes ( bdg ) equation in the continuum limit and show that the zero energy bound state ( zero mode ) is described by a exponentially localized wave function .      for the sake of completeness",
    ", we now review the basis formalism of the @xmath0 sc .",

    "we have obtained the majorana bound state ( bs ) with zero energy attached to a single @xmath51 superconducting vortex . for the multi - vortex case",
    ", we need to take into account the inter - vortex tunneling .",
    "in last section , we have reviewed that the @xmath0 topological sc supports zero mode around vortices . these vortices with topologically protected zero mode obey non - abelian statistics . in this section ,",
    "we focus on the mid - gap states induced by the vortex superlattice after considering the coupling between majorana fermions on different vortices .    to study the coupling between majorana fermions on different vortices",
    ", we assume that each vortex locally threads into single plaquette .",
    "each vortex can be regarded as the end of a string .",
    "this string is the phase branch - cut of the pairing order parameter .",
    "each ( spinless ) fermion denoting by @xmath52 acquires a minus sign after moving around the vortex by crossing the phase branch - cut as @xmath53 .",
    "so the vortex is a really @xmath54-flux on a plaquette .",
    "this definition provides us an effective method to numerically compute the properties of the quantized vortex in the @xmath0 topological sc .",
    "the inset of fig.1 shows two vortices with two approximate zero modes localized in each core .    because the inter - vortex tunneling effect leads to the energy splitting of the two zero modes",
    ", we must take into account this tunneling effect for two quantized vortices nearby . to see the tunneling effect clearer , we performed numerical simulations and the results are shown in fig.1 .",
    "generally , the energy splitting due to inter - vortex tunneling is determined by the overlap of the wave functions of two vortices .",
    "one can see that the energy splitting between two nearby vortices ( the distance @xmath55 between two vortices nearby is smaller than the coherent length @xmath56 ) exhibits a relatively large value . on the other hand , for two well separated vortices ( the distance @xmath55 between two vortices nearby is larger than the coherent length @xmath56 ) , the energy splitting from the inter - vortex tunneling can be ignored . in fig.1 , we have chosen @xmath57 to do our calculations .",
    "in this part we study the @xmath0 topological sc with a square vortex superlattice .",
    "the lattice constant of the square vortex superlattice is set to be @xmath58 we choose @xmath59 sites to be a unit cell ( @xmath60 along @xmath61 direction and @xmath62 along @xmath63 direction ) . to show the topological properties of the mid - gap states , we put the system on a cylinder ( open boundary condition along x - direction , periodic boundary condition along y - direction ) .",
    "the results are shown in fig.2 . from fig.2",
    ", one can see that the energy bands from the bulk consist of two parts : the energy bands of bogoliubov quasi - particles and the mid - bands induced by vortex superlattice .",
    "both energy bands have energy gaps . except for the energy bands from the bulk",
    ", there exist gapless edge states .",
    "there are two types of edge states : one comes from the parent topological superconductor due to its nontrivial topological properties , the other comes from the vortex superlattice .",
    "that means the mid - gap states induced by the vortex superlattice also have nontrivial topological properties .",
    "see the illustration in fig.2 and fig.3 .",
    "fig.3(a ) shows the particle density distribution of the edge state of the parent topological superconductor and fig.3(b ) shows the particle density distribution of edge states of the mid - gap states induced by the vortex superlattice .",
    "one can see that due to a larger energy gap , the localized length into the bulk of the edges state of the parent topological sc is shorter than that of the edge states of the mid - gap states .      in the last section ,",
    "we have shown the induced mid - gap energy bands induced by vortex superlattice .",
    "because each vortex has a residual zero mode and the inter - vortex tunneling effect leads to the energy splitting of the degenerated zero modes , we can use a tight - binding majorana lattice model to describe the mid - gap states proposed in ref.@xcite .",
    "the hamiltonian of this tight - binding majorana lattice model can be @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the operator of majorana fermion in @xmath66 vortex core obeying the self - conjugate condition and the canonical commutate relation @xmath67 .",
    "the indices @xmath68 denote nearest neighbor couplings , next - next nearest neighbor couplings , respectively , @xmath69 are the corresponding coupling strength along @xmath61 and @xmath63 direction , and @xmath70 is the next nearest neighbor coupling strength .",
    "each @xmath71 connecting bond @xmath72 has @xmath73 gauge degree of freedom which does not affect any physical conclusions .",
    "motivated by the decompose rules that two majorana fermions fuse into a complex fermion , and no net flux through the primitive cell , the condition that there is @xmath74 flux in each triangular plaquette must be satisfied .",
    "fig.4 shows the majorana lattice model .",
    "we then decompose majorana operator as @xmath75 where @xmath76 destroys a dirac fermion on the center of link ( see fig.4 ) .",
    "this formalism reproduces an effective spinless sc state which we model as @xmath77{cc}f_{\\mathbf{k}}^{\\dag } & f_{-\\mathbf{k}}\\end{array } \\right )   \\left ( \\begin{array } [ c]{cc}\\phi_{\\mathbf{k}}^{0}+\\phi_{\\mathbf{k}}^{3 } & \\phi_{\\mathbf{k}}^{1}-i\\phi_{\\mathbf{k}}^{2}\\\\ \\phi_{\\mathbf{k}}^{1}+i\\phi_{\\mathbf{k}}^{2 } & \\phi_{\\mathbf{k}}^{0}-\\phi_{\\mathbf{k}}^{3}\\end{array } \\right )   \\left ( \\begin{array } [ c]{c}f_{\\mathbf{k}}\\\\ f_{-\\mathbf{k}}^{\\dagger}\\end{array } \\right )   .\\ ] ] the energy dispersion has the form as @xmath78 with @xmath79 .",

    "the paired order parameter is equal @xmath85 , and @xmath86 for @xmath87 , respectively .",
