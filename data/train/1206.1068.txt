    "the cross sections for the fusion of light , symmetric systems of nuclei sometimes exhibit structures or oscillations at energies above the coulomb barrier .",
    "this has been observed both in measurements and in coupled - channels calculations .",
    "the best experimental examples of this behavior are the fusion data of @xmath0c+@xmath0c @xcite @xmath0c+@xmath1o @xcite , and @xmath1o+@xmath1o @xcite .",
    "the structures have been associated with resonances but there are also suggestions that they may be caused by the penetration of centrifugal barriers that are well - separated in energy @xcite .",
    "a simple reason the oscillations occur primarily in the fusion of lighter , symmetric systems is that the separation in energy between successive angular momentum barriers is relatively large in these systems .",
    "thus , when the separation of successive barriers becomes larger than twice the width associated with the penetration of the individual barriers , the oscillating pattern may occur .",
    "this feature will be illustrated by applying a simple model that is based on the hill - wheeler barrier penetration formula @xcite .",
    "it was recently shown @xcite that the structures observed in the @xmath1o+@xmath1o fusion data of ref .",
    "@xcite can be explained fairly well by coupled - channels calculations .",
    "the calculations were based on a shallow potential in the entrance channel , whereas calculations based on a conventional woods - saxon potential did not reproduce the data so well @xcite .",
    "thus there appears to be some connection between the oscillations in fusion cross sections at energies above the coulomb barrier and the fusion hindrance phenomenon that occurs at deep subbarrier energies @xcite .",
    "both phenomena can be explained by applying a shallow m3y+repulsion potential in coupled - channels calculations , whereas a conventional woods - saxon potential fails @xcite .    a model of heavy - ion fusion which contains information about the centrifugal barriers at high energies",
    "is introduced in the next section .",
    "it is based on the hill - wheeler formula for barrier penetration @xcite , and it is shown how the first derivative of the energy - weighted fusion cross section can be used as a diagnostic tool to reveal the heights of the centrifugal barriers .",
    "it is also shown why information about centrifugal barriers is lost in the commonly used wong s formula @xcite . in section iii ,",
    "the first derivative of the energy - weighted cross section is applied to analyze the structures that are observed in the fusion data of @xmath0c+@xmath0c , @xmath1o+@xmath1o , and @xmath0c+@xmath1o .",
    "the possibility of observing similar structures in the fusion of heavier systems is discussed in section iv , and section v contains the conclusions .",
    "in order to make a simple interpretation of high - energy fusion data one may resort to the well - known hill - wheeler formula @xcite , which expresses the barrier penetration probability in terms of a simple fermi function , @xmath2 where @xmath3 = @xmath4 . here @xmath5 is the center - of - mass energy , @xmath6 is the barrier height , and @xmath7 is a parameter that determines the exponential falloff at energies far below the barrier .",
    "it can be derived from a parabolic approximation to the barrier potential but it is treated as an adjustable parameter in the following .    the fusion cross section can now be obtained from the expression , @xmath8 where @xmath9 = @xmath10 , and @xmath11 is the reduced mass of the fusing system . for a symmetric system of @xmath12 ground state nuclei ,",

    "they are consistent with the data by gary and volant but the energy steps between the data points are too large to reveal any structures in the data .",
    "the solid curve in fig . [ f1dsi28 ] is derived from the coupled - channels calculation shown in fig .",
    "[ flfsi28he ] with the weak absorption .",
    "it shows a lot of structure and it is remarkable how well the peaks of the calculation correlate with the structures observed in the data .",
    "the good agreement in this respect allows one to assign with some confidence an angular momentum to each of the peaks .",
    "the peak near 35 mev is caused by the @xmath13 = 20 centrifugal barrier .",
    "based on the results discussed here it is suggested that some of the measurements by gary and volant @xcite should be repeated with higher precision and with sufficiently small energy steps so that the structures associated with the individual centrifugal barriers can better be resolved . in order to be able to calibrate the ion - ion potential , it would be very useful not only to perform the measurements at energies above the coulomb barrier , where the structures due to the individual centrifugal barriers may exist , but also at energies far below the coulomb barrier , where the sensitivity to the ion - ion potential for overlapping nuclei also shows up @xcite .",
    "the analysis of the @xmath56si fusion data shows that it is necessary to employ an imaginary potential of varying strength , depending on which data set is analyzed .",
    "the high - energy data require a strong imaginary potential , combined with a maximum angular momentum for fusion , whereas the low energy data can be explained with a weak imaginary potential .",
    "it would be useful in future work to develop an energy dependent imaginary potential .",
    "the structures that have been observed a long time ago in the high - energy data for several light - ion systems can be explained as being caused by the penetration of successive centrifugal barriers that are well separated in energy .",
    "this mechanism is clearly seen in hill - wheeler s expression for the fusion cross section , and it is best illustrated by plotting the first derivative of the energy weighted cross section .",
    "the locations of the peaks in such a plot show the energies of the centrifugal barriers that causes the structures , whereas the width of the peaks can be associated with the quantum mechanical penetration of the centrifugal barrier .",
    "the analytic expression for the fusion cross section derived by wong , on the other hand , does not reveal the energy location of any individual centrifugal barriers , except the location of the s - wave barrier .",
    "this is not surprising because the derivation of wong s formula assumes that sequential barriers are so close in energy that the discrete sum over the orbital angular momentum be replaced by a smooth integration .",
    "some of the fusion data were analyzed by coupled - channels calculations that were based on the m3y+repulsion potential .",
    "the calculations showed that the strength and the location of the peaks observed in the first derivative of the energy - weighted cross section are very sensitive to coupled - channels effects .",
    "this implies that the extracted barriers are effective barriers and not the real barriers of the centrifugal potential in the entrance channel .",
    "the nuclear potentials that were used in the coupled - channels calculations were adjusted in each case to optimize the fit to the data , and when this was achieved , it turned out that the calculations reproduced fairly well the location of the peak structures that are observed in the data",
    ". the good agreement allows one to assign an orbital angular momentum to most of the effective centrifugal barriers that have been extracted from the experiments .",
    "the results of the data analysis suggest that the structures observed in the fusion data at energies above the coulomb barrier are best explained by coupled - channels calculations that are based on a shallow potential in the entrance channel .",
    "thus there appears to be some consistency in the description of the structures at energies above the coulomb barrier and the hindrance of fusion , which is observed at energies far below the coulomb barrier .",
    "both phenomena are sensitive to the ion - ion potential for overlapping nuclei , and both are best described by a shallow potential in the entrance channel .",
    "the amplitude of the structures observed in the fusion data seems to diminish in heavier systems .",
    "this is unfortunate because the structures reveal valuable information about the ion - ion potential , and they provide an excellent test of coupled - channels calculations .",
    "it is very encouraging to see , however , that structures do exist in the fusion of a system as heavy as @xmath56si+@xmath56si .",
    "it is therefore suggested that a new experimental search for structures in high - energy fusion cross sections be pursued , preferably with higher precision than in the past , and with energy steps that are sufficiently small to resolve the structures associated with the individual barriers .",
