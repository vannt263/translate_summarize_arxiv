    "gravitational microlensing , initially developed to search for machos in the galactic halo and near the galactic disc @xcite has become nowadays a powerful tool to investigate several aspects of stellar astrophysics and also to search for extrasolar planets orbiting around lens stars .",
    "indeed , microlensing gives the opportunity to study the star s limb - darkening profile , which is the variation of the intensity from the disc center to the limb , and thus to test stellar atmosphere models . at the same time , microlensing leads to the discovery and the detailed characterization of exoplanetary systems when planetary deviations in the light - curves expected for single - lens events are detected ( see @xcite and @xcite for recent reviews ) .",
    "microlenses can spatially resolve a source star thanks to caustic structures created by a lens system @xcite .",
    "caustics are formed by a set of closed curves , along which the point source magnification is formally infinite , with a steep increase in magnification in their vicinity .",
    "this increase is so steep that the characteristic length scale of the differential magnification effect is of the order of a fraction of the source star radius . in this way different parts of the source star are magnified by substantially different amounts .",
    "the resulting lensing light - curve deviates from the standard form expected for a point source event @xcite and the analysis of the deviations enables to measure the limb - darkening profile of the lensed star .",
    "early works @xcite have pointed out the sensitivity of microlensing light - curves to limb - darkening , with the aim to help to remove the microlensing model parameter degeneracy .",
    "the specific use of microlensing as a tool to study stellar atmospheres was proposed later @xcite , in particular to probe atmospheres of red giants in the galactic bulge @xcite .",
    "the best candidate events for studying stellar atmospheres are highly magnified microlensing events , which also show relevant finite size source effects . for these events",
    "the lens and the background source star are almost aligned and the lens passes over the surface of the source star ( _ transit _ events ) .",
    "although relatively rare , these events potentially contain unique information on the stellar atmosphere properties of the source star as shown by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "indeed , besides the brightness profile of a remote source star disc , highly magnified events with large finite size source effects allow to measure the lens einstein radius @xmath2 ( if the physical radius @xmath3 of the source is known ) and provide a unique chance to study spectroscopically galactic bulge stars .",
    "the light - curve analysis of highly magnified events is also sensitive to the presence of lens planetary companions , in particular when the planet - to star distance is of the order of @xmath2 .",
    "the same opportunity for studying stellar atmospheres is offered by binary microlensing due to caustic crossing as the source passes through fold @xcite and cusp caustics @xcite .    the aim of the present paper is to consider polarization variability of the source star light for real events , taking into account different polarization mechanisms according to the source star type .",
    "indeed , variations in the polarization curves are similar to finite source effects in microlensing when color effects may appear due to limb darkening and color distribution across the disc @xcite .",
    "it is known that the light received from the stellar limb may be significantly ( up to about 12 percent ) polarized due to the so called sobolev ",
    "chandrasekhar effect @xcite .",
    "polarization parallel to the limb of the source is caused by photon ( thomson ) scattering off free electrons , when the light passes through the stellar atmosphere .",
    "this polarization mechanism is effective for hot stars of any luminosity class which , indeed , have a free electron atmosphere .",
    "it is also known that , by a minor extent , the continuum spectrum of the main sequence stars of late type is linearly polarized by coherent ( rayleigh ) scattering on neutral hydrogen in its ground state and , with a minor contribution , by scattering on free electrons @xcite .",
    "the polarization in late type stars has been measured only for the sun ( for which due to the distance the projected disc is spatially resolved ) and also in this case as for hot stars , the polarization gets its maximum value near the solar limb , due to the most favorable geometry there .",
    "however , the light received from the stars is usually unpolarized , since the flux from each stellar disc element is the same .",
    "a net polarization of the stellar light may be introduced by some suitable asymmetry in the stellar disc ( e.g. eclipses , tidal distortions , stellar spots , fast rotation , magnetic fields ) and also in the propagation through the interstellar medium @xcite .    in the microlensing context ,",
    "polarization in the stellar light is induced due to the proper motion of the lens star through the source star disc , during which different parts are magnified by different amounts .",
    "therefore , the gravitational lens scans the disc of the background star giving rise not only to a time dependent gravitational magnification of the source star light but also to a time dependent polarization .    as for the limb - darkening brightness profile",
    ", the polarization degree is maximized when the source trajectory crosses regions with high magnification gradient .",
    "this occurs in _ transit _ events since the magnification of the source star flux increases as the lens approaches closer to the source star , and during binary microlensing events since now there is the opportunity for caustic crossing .",
    "accordingly , we consider the polarization variability for the _ transit _ events ( with lenses passing over source stars ) selected by @xcite and for a subset of exoplanetary events towards the galactic bulge @xcite .",
    "exoplanetary events are binary lens systems characterized by values of the planet - to - star mass ratio @xmath4 and have smaller star - to - planet distance @xmath5 as compared to the separation of the stars in a binary system .",
    "a full treatment of the polarization in binary microlensing events will be the subject of a subsequent paper . here",
    ", selecting a representative sample of exoplanetary events , we show how the polarization works in binary microlensing .",
    "the idea that polarization induced by an electron scattering atmosphere could be enhanced by gravitational microlensing and eventually observed was first raised and investigated in relation to supernovae by @xcite .",
    "in particular , the observation of a variable polarization due to a supernova beam expanding in a self - gravitating system constituted by individual masses ( @xmath6 ) may indicate the presence of dark matter objects .    then , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite pointed out that the polarization of star light induced by an electron scattering atmosphere is enhanced by the microlensing effect and that the relative motion of source and lens causes a time variation of the source polarization degree . @xcite and @xcite also present a numerical calculation of the polarization degree induced by a single - lens ( the schwarzschild lens ) , showing that during a microlensing event the polarization profile has a double peak for _ transit _ events , ( where a part of the source disc is aligned with the lens and observer ) , while it has a single peak in the _ bypass _ events ( where the source trajectory remains outside the lens ) .    assuming that the source star has an electron scattering atmosphere , @xcite calculated the time - dependent polarization of a star being gravitationally lensed by a binary system .",
    "polarization as high as @xmath7 percent can be achieved if the star crosses a caustic or passes near a cusp ; otherwise , the maximum polarization is @xmath8 percent .",
    "polarization by non - compact microlenses @xcite was also analyzed @xcite since a source may cross caustics arising in the model .",
    "the most likely candidates for observing polarization variability during microlensing events would be young , hot giant star sources , because they have electron scattering atmospheres needed for producing limb polarization through thomson scattering @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , the bulge of the galaxy does not contain a large number of hot giant stars .",
    "however , polarization may be also induced by the scattering of star light off atoms , molecules and dust grains in the adsorptive atmospheres of evolved , cool stars as shown by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "these more ubiquitous stars , that do not have levels of polarization as high as those predicted by the chandrasekar model , may display an intrinsic polarization of up to several percent , due to the presence of stellar winds that give rise to extended adsorptive envelopes .",
    "this is the case for many cool giant stars , in particular for the red giants .",
    "such evolved stars constitute a significant fraction of the lensed sources towards the galactic bulge , the lmc @xcite and the m31 galaxy @xcite , making them valuable candidates for observing variable polarization during microlensing events .",
    "polarization measurements on ongoing microlensing events can be useful for further characterizing them , for testing stellar atmosphere models and to complement finite source measurements @xcite . in this respect ,",
    "the detection of a variable polarization leads to an independent measure of the angular einstein radius @xmath2 of the lens , the position angle of the lens and the velocity direction in the sky @xcite .",
    "of course , since accurate polarization measurements can not be obtained with a survey telescope , alert systems are necessary allowing other larger telescopes to take polarimetric measurements during a microlensing event .",
    "for definiteness , we consider the observed sample of highly magnified , single - lens _ transit _ events @xcite and a subset of exoplanetary events observed towards the galactic bulge @xcite .",
    "for these events we calculate the polarization profiles as a function of time taking into account the nature of the source stars . as an illustration",
    ", we also consider the expected polarization signal for the pa-99-n2 event towards m31 @xcite .",
    "let us consider the linear polarization of light scattered in a stellar atmosphere .",
    "following the approach in @xcite we define the intensities @xmath9 and @xmath10 emitted by the scattering atmosphere in the direction making an angle @xmath11 with the normal to the star surface and polarized as follows : @xmath9 is the intensity in the plane containing the line of sight and the normal , @xmath10 is the intensity in the direction perpendicular to this plane ( light propagates in the direction @xmath12 ) . here",
    "@xmath13 and we are assuming that the polarization is a function only of @xmath14 . the center - to - limb variation in the polarization across the stellar disc originates from the contribution of the scattering opacity to the total opacity in the star atmosphere .",
    "the polarization typically increases from the center ( @xmath15 ) to the stellar limb ( @xmath16 ) since we tend to see more scattered , hence polarized , light towards the limb . in the hot stars , electron ( thomson )",
    "scattering is one cause of opacity . in the case of cool stars ,",
    "coherent ( rayleigh ) scattering on atomic and molecular hydrogen and atomic helium , and scattering off dust grains provide the main source of the scattering opacity .",
    "we choose a coordinate system in the lens plane with the origin at the center @xmath17 of the projected position of the source star .",
    "the @xmath18 axis is directed towards the observer , the @xmath19 axis is directed towards the lens ( in single - lens events ) and oriented parallel to the star - to - planet separation ( in binary events ) .",
    "the location of a point @xmath20 on the star surface is determined by the angular distance @xmath21 from the origin of the coordinates and by the angle @xmath22 with the @xmath19 axis ( @xmath23 and @xmath24 ) . in the above coordinate system @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the star angular size . here and in the following all distances",
    "are given in units of the einstein radius @xmath2 of the total lens mass .",
    "to calculate the polarization of a star with center at the position @xmath17 we integrate the unnormalized stokes parameters and the flux over the star @xcite @xmath27 @xmath28 @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the unamplified star flux ,",
    "@xmath31 the point source amplification due to the lens system and @xmath32 @xmath33 as usual , the polarization degree and the polarization angle are @xcite @xmath34 clearly , neglecting other distorting factors , the stellar light will be unpolarized if we observe the source star without any gravitational lens effect since , due to the symmetry of their expressions , the parameters @xmath35 and @xmath36 are equal to zero . the gravitational field produced by",
    "the lensing system breaks the spherical symmetry over the projected stellar disc and thus results in a non - vanishing polarization .    for single - lens events the amplification is @xcite @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the angular distance between the considered surface element on the stellar disc and the lens position .",
    "here @xmath39 ( @xmath21 ) is the angular distance of the lens ( the surface element ) from the star center .",
    "vanishes in the adopted system of coordinates defined by the line joining the lens and the star , and the polarization position angle is always perpendicular to that line . ]    in the case of binary events , we evaluate the amplification map @xmath31 at any point in the source plane by using the inverse ray - shooting method @xcite . in this case",
    "the amplification map depends on the mass ratio @xmath40 between the planet and the star and the star - to - planet separation @xmath5 .",
    "the other quantities entering in the above equations are the coordinates of the source star center .",
    "these are given at any time @xmath41 in terms of the other lens system parameters : the impact parameter @xmath42 ( the minimum distance of the source star center projected on the lens plane from the center of mass of the lens system ) , the maximum amplification time @xmath43 , the eintein time @xmath44 and , for binary events , the angle @xmath45 that the source trajectory makes with the @xmath19 axis .",
    "to derive a quantitative expression of the functions @xmath9 and @xmath10 in the above equations one has to consider the relevant physical mechanism giving rise to the variable polarization degree .      in the case of polarization of stellar light induced by the electron scattering in the atmosphere of hot stars ,",

    "@xmath46 @xmath47      the continuum spectrum of the sun is linearly polarized by coherent scattering on neutral hydrogen in its ground state ( rayleigh scattering ) and , with a minor contribution , by ( thomson ) scattering on free electrons .",
    "the polarization is maximum near the solar limb due to the most favorable geometry there .",
    "@xcite developed a theoretical study for the formation of the continuum polarization , identifying the relevant physical mechanisms and clarifying their relative roles .",
    "the key physical quantities are the scattering coefficients and the temperature gradient in the stellar layer where polarization is formed . with a solar model atmosphere as input ,",
    "the polarization is obtained by numerically solving the transfer equation for polarized radiation .",
    "the results of their numerical calculations are approximated by semi - analytical formulas , as a function of @xmath14 and of wavelength @xmath48",

    "polarization signals in microlensing of stars with extended circumstellar envelopes have been studied by @xcite for a single - lens and in binary lensing by @xcite . as emphasized in these works ,",
    "the model is well suited to describe polarization in evolved , cool stars that exhibit stellar winds significantly stronger than those of the sun .",
    "the scattering opacity responsible for producing the polarization is the photon scattering on atomic and molecular species ( rayleigh ) or on dust grains .",
    "the scattering number density distribution in the stellar envelope was parametrized by a simple power law @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the radial distance from the star center and @xmath61 is the number density at the radius @xmath62 of a central cavity . indeed , since dust grains and molecules can not form at temperatures higher than 3000 k @xmath63 4000 k , a circumstellar cavity was considered between the photosphere radius @xmath26 and the condensation radius @xmath62 , where the temperature drops to 1500 k.    the star envelope was assumed optically thin and the relevant scattering cross - section was evaluated in the dipole approximation .",
    "the relevant expressions for the stokes parameters are given in the paper by @xcite , where one can see that the polarization degree linearly depends on the optical depth @xmath64 .",
    "it has also been found that the polarization degree during microlensing can reaches values up to a few percent , provided that @xmath65    an estimate of the the order of magnitude of @xmath64 was also derived assuming that the gas density profile in the stellar wind follows the law @xmath66 with @xmath67 ( @xmath68 ) , and considering the main contribution to the gas opacity at temperature @xmath69 k. if dust grains are the main source to the stellar opacity , the optical depth is @xcite @xmath70 where @xmath71 is the dust - to - gas mass density ratio and @xmath72 @xmath73 g@xmath74 is the dust opacity at @xmath75 @xcite .",
    "this means that the wind mass - loss rate must be around @xmath76 to obtain @xmath65 .",
    "this level of mass loss can be achieved only in agb stars .",
    "this class of stars constitutes the sources of only a few of the observed microlensing events , while much more common are subgiants and red giant stars . for a realistic estimate of the polarization level for these stars",
    ", one has to relate @xmath64 to the stellar parameters of the magnified star .",
    "indeed , it is well known that from main sequence to agb phases , the mass - loss rate increases by 7 order of magnitude @xcite . by performing simulations of the mass loss of intermediate and low - mass stars",
    ", it was shown that the increase of mass loss is a continuous function ( while the velocity and temperature evolutionary traces show gaps between the subgiant and agb phases ) and that @xmath77 obeys the relation @xcite @xmath78 so , for the more common stars evolving from main sequence to red giant star phases ( see also fig .",
    "15 in @xcite ) , mass loss rates between @xmath79 are expected .",
    "this corresponds to values of @xmath64 in the range @xmath80 and , therefore , to polarization degree that are not always negligible , reaching values up to 0.5 percent .    here",
    ", we adopt the above formalism to derive the polarization profiles for source stars with envelopes . to this aim ,",
    "the stokes parameters are numerically evaluated by using in eqs .",

    "generally , the maximum polarization degree takes place at the time @xmath43 of the maximum amplification .",
    "this happens when @xmath94 ( _ bypass _ events ) for which the source trajectory remains outside the lens . for single - lens events with @xmath95 ( _ transit _ events ) for which some part of the source is directly aligned with the lens center and observer , the polarization curve has two maxima and one minimum , bracketed by the maxima , which coincides with the instant of maximum amplification @xcite . in the case of _ transit",
    "_ events , the polarization signal gets the maximum value when the source disk enters and exits the fold caustic ( two peaks appear at symmetrical position with respect to @xmath43 ) . in this case , the characteristic time scale @xmath96 between the two peaks of the polarization curve is related to the _ transit _ duration of the source disc by @xcite @xmath97    in binary microlensing events , for which there are a central ( stellar ) and one or two planetary caustics depending on the star - to - planet separation @xmath98 or @xmath99 , respectively , significant polarization may be induced when the star trajectory intersects one of the caustics .",
    "then , a polarization peak occurring at @xmath100 implies that a planetary caustic is intersected by the source .",
    "moreover , as for single - lens events , if the star source _ bypasses _ one caustic ( central or planetary ) , a single polarization peak appears in the polarization profile at the time of nearest approach , while a double - peak feature occurs if the stellar disc _ transits _ a caustic .    therefore , detection of polarization signals may allow , in principle , to distinguish between single and binary lens events .",
    "indeed , single and binary events can be separated by the presence of a polarization signal at @xmath100 or by an eventual asymmetry in the polarization curve ( near @xmath43 ) induced by the planetary caustic .",
    "this happens for events with @xmath101 , for which the planetary caustic shifts in a position close to the central one .     in general , the polarization signal in binary microlensing events depends on the projected source trajectory in the lens plane , the size and position of the caustics and the diameter of the source disc . in section 3.2",
    "we consider , as an example , some exoplanetary events well observed towards the galactic center , leaving a detailed study of the polarization in binary microlensing events to a subsequent analysis .    for single - lens events and polarization induced by electron scattering in the atmosphere of hot stars , in fig .",

    "we also note that the polarization peak shows a two subpeak structure caused by the source star disc transiting the planetary caustic .",
    "the size of this caustic , which turns out to be @xmath134 , may be computed by using the eqs .",
    "( 8) and ( 9 ) given by @xcite .",
    "the sharp depolarization following the polarization peak in fig .",
    "[ fig9 ] is due to a deamplification region ( following the planetary caustic ) intersected by the source star disc .",
    "the polarization profile evaluated for the exoplanetary event ogle-2003-blg-235/moa - blg-53 @xcite is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig10 ] , where we follow the approach described in subsection 2.3 for late type main sequence stars . as one can see the polarization degree is almost vanishing , except for two sharp peaks , also present in the light - curve ( see fig . 1 in @xcite ) ,",
    "occurring when the source passes over two folds of the planetary caustic .",
    "the size of this caustic is much larger than the projected source star disk , which enters the caustic at @xmath135 day and exits at @xmath136 day .",
    "a similar behavior occurs for the last considered exoplanetary event moa-2007-blg-368 @xcite as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig11 ] .",
    "the pa-99-n2 event is a pixel lensing event observed in 1999 towards m31 by the point - agape collaboration @xcite .",
    "the light curve shows a deviation from the paczyski law which has been thoroughly analyzed by @xcite .",
    "in particular , @xcite concluded in favor of a binary lens system with the primary lens companion being in the substellar mass range . a further monte carlo study @xcite has evidenced that one of the binary component may even be an exoplanet of a few jupiter masses .",
    "although the analysis of @xcite does not provide a strong evidence for finite size source effect , which is necessary to the enhancement of the polarization signal , to our purposes we consider the lensing parameter for the binary finite source ( fs ) solution provided in table 2 in the paper by @xcite .",
    "in particular , for the source we consider a red giant with @xmath137 and @xmath138 k. accordingly , from eqs .",
    "( [ tau ] ) and ( [ dotm ] ) we estimate @xmath139 and using the formalism in subsection 2.4 we compute has been always calculated by considering only the flux @xmath140 from the lensed source star and neglecting any contribution of non - lensed sources ( blending ) . in this respect ,",
    "our polarization results for the pa-99-n2 event have to be considered as upper limits , since a strong blending component is expected in pixel - lensing observations towards m31 . ] the corresponding polarization profile shown in fig .",
    "[ fig12 ] .",
    "inspection of this figure shows that the amplitude of the polarization degree can reach values up to 0.5 percent ( when the caustic region is crossed by the source star ) . in the same figure , for comparison",
    ", we show the polarization curve ( dotted line ) expected for a point lens ( pl ) model with the same finite source effect .    of course , with a distance modulus to m31 larger by about 10 mag than that of galactic bulge stars , the observability of the polarization for m31 sources remains , at the moment , highly speculative .",
    "the combined effects of large magnification and finite size source effects in some microlensing events may allow to get relatively large values of the polarization of the light from the source stars . in this paper",
    "we calculate the polarization profile as a function of the time for a selected sample of both single and exoplanetary microlensing events observed towards the galactic bulge , by taking into account the nature of the source star : hot , late type main sequence and cool giant stars . indeed ,",
    "different polarization mechanisms take place in the stellar atmospheres , depending on the source star type : photon ( thomson ) scattering on free electrons , coherent ( rayleigh ) scattering off atoms and molecules , and photon scattering on dust grains , for hot , late type and cool giant stars ( with extended atmospheres ) , respectively .",
    "the analysis of the polarization curves for single - lens , highly magnified microlensing events towards the galactic bulge has shown that the polarization degree of the stellar light can reach values as high as 0.04 percent at the peak in the case of late type source stars and up to a few percent in the case of cool giant source stars ( red giants ) with extended envelopes .",
    "for these events the primary lens crosses the source star disc ( _ transit _ events ) and relatively large values of @xmath0 are thereby produced due to large finite source effects and the large magnification gradient throughout the source star disc .",
    "the time duration of the peak of the polarization signal may vary , from 1h to 1day , depending on the source star radius and the lens impact parameter .",
    "similar values of polarization may also be obtained in exoplanetary events when the source star crosses the primary or the planetary caustics .",
    "while in the former case ( as for single - lens events ) the peak of the polarization signal always occurs at symmetrical points with respect to the instant @xmath43 of maximum magnification , in the latter case the polarization signal may occur at any ( and generally unpredictable ) time during the event .",
    "the natural question which arises is whether such polarization signals may be detectable with the present or near future technology .",
    "polarimeters are nowadays available on large telescopes and the best possibility for measuring polarization in the r and i bands is offered at present by the polarimeter in fors2 on eso s vlt telescope . with this instrument",
    "it is possible to measure the polarization for a 12 mag source star with a precision of 0.1 percent in 10 min integration time , and for a 14 mag star in a 1h . indeed , for a few of the events considered in tables [ table2 ] and [ table4 ] the peak @xmath141 magnitude is @xmath142 with the expected maximum polarization degree lasting up to 1 day , thus suggesting that polarization measurements in highly magnified microlensing events constitute a realistic target of opportunity for currently available instruments .",
    "it goes without saying that polarization measurements in microlensing events require an alert system able to predict in advance the instant of the occurrence of the polarization peak .",
    "a alert system is already in operation based on ogle and moa survey data , and it is particularly efficient in the case of highly magnified events , allowing to focus observing resources to make intensive observations around the peak of the event .",
    "we emphasize that polarization measurements in highly magnified microlensing events offer an unique opportunity to probe stellar atmospheres of galactic bulge stars . besides the interest related to stellar astrophysics , the analysis of the polarization profile , which reflects that of the magnification light - curve , given sufficient observational precision , may in principle provide independent constraints on the lensing parameters also for exoplanetary events .",
