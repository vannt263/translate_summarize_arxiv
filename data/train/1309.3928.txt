    "<S> we propose a cpt - even and lorentz - violating dimension - five nonminimal coupling between fermionic and gauge fields , involving the cpt - even and lorentz - violating gauge tensor of the standard - model extension . </S>",
    "<S> this nonminimal coupling modifies the nonrelativistic regime of dirac particles , inducing new effects such as an electric - zeeman - like spectrum splitting and an anomalous - like contribution to the electron magnetic moment . </S>",
    "<S> these new effects allow to constrain the magnitude of this nonminimal coupling in @xmath0 part in @xmath1    the standard - model extension ( sme ) @xcite is the natural framework for studying properties of lorentz violation ( lv ) in all sectors of the standard model @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> some time ago , a lorentz - violating and cpt - odd nonminimal coupling between fermions and the gauge field was proposed @xcite of the form @xmath2 in the context of the dirac equation , where @xmath3v@xmath4 is the carroll - field - jackiw 4-vector and @xmath5 is the coupling constant . </S>",
    "<S> the analysis of the nonrelativistic limit revealed that this coupling provides a magnetic moment @xmath6 for uncharged particles @xcite , and corrections to the hydrogen spectrum @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> contributions to the dynamics of the aharonov - bohm - casher problem @xcite and to the fermion - fermion ultrarelativistic scattering @xcite were also analyzed . in the present work , </S>",
    "<S> we propose a new cpt - even @xcite ,  dimension - five , nonminimal coupling linking the fermionic and gauge fields in the context of the dirac equation . </S>",
    "<S> the starting point is a nonminimal coupling involving fundamental dirac fermions and the electromagnetic field in the context of the dirac equation , @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the electron spinor wave function , and * *  * * the covariant derivative with nonminimal coupling is@xmath9 where @xmath10 is the electron nonminimal coupling constant , and @xmath11 is the cpt - even lv tensor of the photon sector of sme , which can be written in terms of four @xmath12 matrices @xmath13 : @xmath14 @xmath15 @xmath16 the dirac equation can be explicitly written as @xmath17   \\psi^{\\left (   e\\right )   } = 0,\\label{diracm1}\\ ] ] and @xmath18 thus , the relevant  electron lagrangian is * *  * * @xmath19 with @xmath20 being the pauli matrices . in the momentum coordinates , @xmath21 the corresponding dirac equation is @xmath22   \\psi ^{(e)}.\\label{diracm3}\\ ] ] where we have used @xmath23 , @xmath24 @xmath25 @xmath26{cc}0 & \\sigma^{i}\\\\ \\sigma^{i } & 0 \\end{array } \\right )   , \\text { \\ \\ \\ \\ } \\sigma^{k}=\\left ( \\begin{array } [ c]{cc}\\sigma^{k } & 0\\\\ 0 & \\sigma^{k}\\end{array } \\right )   .\\ ] ] and introduced the following definitions:@xmath27    in order to investigate the role played by this nonminimal coupling , we should evaluate the nonrelativistic limit of the dirac equation . at first order in the lorentz violating parameters , </S>",
    "<S> the following hamiltonian is achieved : @xmath28 + ea_{0}+\\lambda^{\\left (   e\\right )   } \\boldsymbol{\\sigma\\cdot}\\left ( \\mathbb{\\tilde{e}}+\\mathbb{\\tilde{b}}\\right ) \\nonumber\\\\ &   -\\frac{\\lambda^{\\left (   e\\right )   } } { m_{e}}\\left (   \\mathbb{e+b}\\right ) \\cdot(\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}\\times\\mathbf{p})+\\frac{e\\lambda^{\\left (   e\\right ) } } { m_{e}}\\left (   \\mathbb{e+b}\\right )   \\mathbb{\\cdot}(\\mathbf{\\sigma}\\times\\mathbf{a } ) , \\label{hnr3}\\ ] ] here written for uniform fields . </S>",
    "<S> this hamiltonian induces new effects to be here discussed . </S>",
    "<S> the term @xmath29 is a generalization of the rashba coupling term , @xmath30 while @xmath31 implies a straightforward tree - level contribution to the anomalous magnetic moment of the electron , and the term @xmath32 leads to a kind of electric zeeman effect . </S>",
    "<S> we begin discussing the correction induced on the atomic spectrum of hydrogen by the term @xmath33 involving the spin operator . in this case , the correction energy is given by @xmath34 now , we adopt a polarized spin configuration , @xmath35  such that@xmath36 with @xmath37  being one of the components of the electric field , and @xmath38  a non - null element of the matrix @xmath39 .  </S>",
    "<S> the positive and negative signs correspond to @xmath40  and @xmath41  respectively . </S>",
    "<S> we also used @xmath42 * * , * * @xmath43 the dependence on @xmath44 leads to a spectrum splitting in @xmath45 lines , representing an electric zeeman - like effect ( due to the presence of an electric field , that can be external or the atomic one ) . </S>",
    "<S> regarding the possibility of measuring spectrum shifts as small as @xmath46 ev , and working with a typical atomic electric field for the hydrogen fundamental level ( @xmath47  ) , whose magnitude is @xmath48 the zeeman - like splitting will be undetectable if @xmath49 ev . </S>",
    "<S> it leads to the following upper bound:@xmath50    another effect associated with the hamiltonian ( [ hnr3 ] ) is concerned with the anomalous magnetic moment of the electron . </S>",
    "<S> the electron magnetic moment is @xmath51 with @xmath52 , and @xmath53 the gyromagnetic factor . </S>",
    "<S> the anomalous magnetic moment of the electron is given by @xmath54 with @xmath55 representing the deviation * * ( * * value in the year 2008 * * ) * * in relation to the usual case . </S>",
    "<S> hence , the magnetic interaction is @xmath56 . </S>",
    "<S> very precise measurements and qed calculations @xcite yield @xmath57 the term @xmath58 provides tree - level lv  contributions to the magnetic interaction , @xmath59   \\left (   \\boldsymbol{\\sigma}_{z}b_{0}\\right )   $ ] , for the magnetic field along the z - axis , @xmath60 and a spin - polarized configuration in the @xmath61-axis . </S>",
    "<S> such correction can not be larger than @xmath62 , so that @xmath63 where we have used @xmath64 ev , @xmath65 it is important to mention that the bounds here found should not be confused with the upper bounds on * * the @xmath11 components already known in the literature , as in the present case the constraint is on the magnitude of the cpt - even parameters as nonminimally coupled . a complete investigation of the corrections on the hydrogen spectrum implied by the hamiltonian ( [ hnr3 ] ) </S>",
    "<S> can be carefully carried out having as counterpart the procedures known in the literature @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the contributions implied by this nonminimal interaction to the photon self energy were already evaluated @xcite . also , the contributions to the fermion self - energy ( searching for possible modifications in the fermionic dispersion relations ) and to the vertex function are under analysis . </S>",
    "<S> these calculations are relevant for establishing the 1-loop consistency of this model . </S>"
