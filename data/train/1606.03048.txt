    "minimum spanning tree is an undirected graph that has no cycles , connects to every vertex , and has the minimal total weighting for its edges .",
    "it is known as a graph which has low complexity and easy to implement @xcite .",
    "mostly , minimum spanning tree is used to represent wires , roads , and water pipes so that the total cost is minimum .",
    "however , recently it has been used in various areas such as geographical information @xcite , radio networks @xcite , eeg @xcite , chip architecture @xcite and stock exchange @xcite .",
    "a similar concept also applied in a movie recommendation system in the form of a dendogram @xcite .    on the other side , japanese animation , which is known as anime ,",
    "has become internationally widespread nowadays .",
    "not only in the eastern countries , american audience also enjoying anime through hayao miyazaki s studio ghibli , which is well - known in western . according to oricon s data , for the past five years ( 2011 - 2015 ) ,",
    "the blu - ray disc and dvd selling of anime were quite stable ; it sold more than 600 thousand discs for each year . with the huge popularity of anime",
    ", a recommendation system is needed to find the similar anime based on particular indicators .",
    "the aim of this work is to represent anime similarities using a minimum spanning tree to be used as a recommendation system .",
    "moreover , the significance of anime will be revealed by extracting the centralities of the minimum spanning tree .",
    "in order to construct the minimum spanning tree , a distance measurement between anime has to be calculated . in this case",
    ", similarity measurement between anime will be used .",
    "many works have been done in similarity measurements of movies in general .",
    "researchers used user reviews @xcite , movie mood @xcite , and movie score @xcite to determine the similarity .",
    "there is also an nlp approach proposed using topic and summary similarity @xcite . in this work , besides using the score and topic , a new measurement is proposed , namely crew similarity .",
    "it is considered that crew similarity is an important characteristic in anime recommendation .",
    "thus , the similarity measurements are described as follows :    1 .",
    "crew similarity + there are two kinds of crew working in the anime industry , _ viz .",
    "_ , production staff and voice actor / actress .",
    "both of them are considered as important factors determining the anime success . here",
    "a similarity measurement by using those factors is proposed , namely crew similarity .",
    "let @xmath0 be a set of crew involved in anime @xmath1 .",
    "the crew similarity between two anime is defined as the number of crew ( both staff and voice actor / actress ) who work for both anime , as calculated as follows : @xmath2 where @xmath3 and @xmath4 means the number of members in set @xmath5 and the total number of anime , respectively . here ,",
    "log transformation is applied since there are some data which are too far away from the others . 2 .",
    "score histogram similarity + score histogram is determined by using user votes .",
    "there are some categories that user can select reflecting anime score .",
    "for instance , in anime news network , anime s votes are classified into 11 categories : masterpiece , excellent , very good , good , decent , so - so , not really good , weak , bad , awful , and worst ever . based on the number of votes for each category , the total score of an anime is calculated .",
    "thus , here the votes for each category are assumed to be a histogram of scores .",
    "the similarity between score histogram would represent the user preference for the particular anime .",
    "let @xmath6 be the score histogram of anime @xmath7 which is defined as @xmath8 where @xmath9 and @xmath10 is the number of votes for category @xmath11 , while n is the number of score categories .",
    "then , the score histogram similarity ( @xmath12 ) is calculated using chi - squared distance as follows : @xmath13 3 .   topic similarity + each anime",
    "is commonly labeled with some genres to make it easier to be classified . in anime news network , besides genre , anime are also classified into themes .",
    "both genre and theme are considered as important parameters for classifying anime .",
    "therefore , topic similarity is used here , employing both genre and theme of anime , to show the similarity with respect to the content .",
    "the topic similarity between two anime is defined as the number of topics ( genres and themes ) that present in both anime .",
    "let @xmath14 be a set of genre and theme terms of anime @xmath1 .",
    "then topic similarity , @xmath15 , is calculated as @xmath16    since the three measurements have different scales , a normalization with respect to size is performed .",
    "the calculation is given by @xmath17 where , @xmath18 from eq .",
    "( [ eq : crew ] ) , ( [ eq : hist ] ) , and ( [ eq : topic ] ) we know that crew and topic similarity results in higher values when the both anime are considered similar , however , for the score histogram similarity , the result is otherwise .",
    "hence , the crew and topic similarities are recalculated so that all similarities are aligned .",
    "let @xmath19 , @xmath20 , and @xmath21 be the normalized version of @xmath22 , @xmath23 , and @xmath24 , respectively .",
    "the calculation is given by @xmath25    afterwards , all three measurements are combined into a similarity vector , defined as @xmath26'$ ] , where @xmath27 means the transposition of @xmath28 .",
    "thus total distance @xmath29 is calculated as @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the euclidean distance .",
    "afterwards , in the next section , the total distance between anime , @xmath32 , will be used as the edge length of a graph .",
    "in order to construct the minimum spanning tree , kruskal s algorithm is employed ( alg .",
    "[ alg : kruskal ] ) .",
    "the algorithm is implemented using disjoint - set data structure .",
    "let @xmath33 , be a set of vertices , @xmath34 be a set of edges connecting a pair of vertices , and @xmath35 be a set of total distances obtained from the previous section .",
    "create new set containing @xmath36 +    a set containing @xmath36 + unites the set that contain @xmath37 and @xmath36 into a new set + @xmath38 makeset(@xmath36 ) arrange @xmath39 in increasing costs , ordered by @xmath40 @xmath41 union(@xmath42 )    a    in graph theory , measuring central vertex has been an active area of research .",
    "many researchers proposed centrality indicators .",
    "some of them are based on walk structure , namely degree @xcite and eigenvector centralities @xcite .",
    "apart from it , there is also some which is based on geodesic distance , such as betweenness @xcite and closeness centrality @xcite . in this work",
    ", central vertices are going to be identified based on the aforementioned indicators .",
    "the centrality measurements are described below :    1 .",
    "degree centrality + degree centrality of vertex @xmath36 is the proportion of other vertices that are adjacent to @xmath36 .",
    "it is defined as @xmath43 where , @xmath44 anime having high degree means that it have many similar anime around it .",
    "2 .   eigenvector centrality + conceptually , eigenvector centrality is similar to degree centrality .",
    "the centrality also measures the number of walks of a vertex .",
    "however , instead of having the length of one , eigenvector measures the number of walks of length infinity .",
    "thus , in eigenvector centrality , a vertex has a high centrality if it is connected to another vertex that also have a high centrality .",
    "the eigenvector centrality is defined as the summed connection of a vertex to others , weighted by their centralities .",
    "let @xmath45 be a matrix of relationship , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath46 .",
    "eigenvector centrality of vertex @xmath36 , denoted as @xmath47 , is calculated as follows @xmath48 where @xmath49 is a constant required so that the equation have a non zero solution .",
    "this problem can be rewritten as an eigenvector equation : @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the eigenvector of @xmath52 and @xmath49 is the corresponding eigenvalue .",
    "betweenness centrality + in the concept of betweenness centrality , a vertex is called in central position when it is located on the shortest path between two vertices . based on it , betweenness centrality of a vertex is defined as the number of times a vertex acts as a bridge between the shortest path of two other vertices .",
    "the betweenness centrality of vertex @xmath36 is defined as + @xmath53 + where @xmath54 is the number of shortest paths between @xmath23 and @xmath55 , @xmath56 is the fraction of those shortest paths that pass through @xmath36 . according to freeman @xcite",
    ", the betweenness can be normalized as @xmath57 4 .",
    "closeness centrality + closeness measures how close a vertex to all other vertices in a graph .",
    "it is defined as the inverse of the total distance from a vertex to other vertices .",
    "since this measurement depends on the number of vertices in the graph , the relative closeness is calculated with a normalization .",
    "the relative closeness is given by + @xmath58 + where @xmath59 is the shortest - path distance between @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "high value of closeness means that a vertex is relatively close to the other vertices .    in order to calculate the total centrality , euclidean distance",
    "are applied so that @xmath60 , where @xmath61 is the total centrality of vertex @xmath36 .",
    "in this work , 4029 anime data were collected randomly from anime news network . for each anime pair",
    ", three similarity measurements are calculated , then used as features to build the minimum spanning tree representation . to visualize the minimum spanning tree , neato program from graphviz",
    "is employed @xcite .",
    "neato program constructs a spring layout by minimizing the global energy function @xcite . the resulting minimum spanning tree",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : mst ] . the sample of a branch of the minimum spanning tree is shown in fig . [ fig : smallbranch ] .",
    "it can be seen that using the minimum spanning tree , we can obtain the nearest anime .",
    "for instance , anime number 3907 has four similar anime , namely anime number 3841 , 3817 , 2936 and 2354 .",
    "this information is useful for recommender systems .",
    "furthermore , the farness between anime also can be retrieved .",
    "if we want to know the distance between anime number 3598 and 2354 , it can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig : smallbranch ] , that the distance is three walks through anime number 3841 and 3907 .",
    "it is considered as a small distance if we take a look at the overall minimum spanning tree in fig .",
    "[ fig : mst ] .",
    "distribution of each centrality measurement is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : centrality ] . the degree distribution is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : centrality](a ) .",
    "it can be seen that most points are located at the bottom - left corner .",
    "this means the majority of vertices are having small numbers of degree . in other words ,",
    "only a small number of anime that have numerous similar anime surround it . in case of eigenvector distribution , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : centrality](b ) , only one value which have centrality and separated quite far from others .",
    "this means that the minimum spanning tree tends towards one direction .",
    "the corresponding anime has such a great importance in the graph .",
    "the distribution of betweenness is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : centrality](c ) .",
    "it can be seen that there are some points having large betweenness but many points are otherwise .",
    "closeness centrality distribution is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : centrality](d ) .",
    "the points are distributed from the small one until the largest closeness .",
    "this kind of distribution is expected for closeness .",
    "vertices that are located on the outer part of the graph are having the small value of closeness , nevertheless large values are obtained as the vertices located near the center of the graph . thus , many of the vertices are located between the outer and the center of the graph .",
    "table [ tab : centrality ] shows the corresponding anime having the largest centrality value for each measurement .",
    "it can be seen that anime one piece and naruto are ranked the first and second respectively in all centrality measurements as well as the total one .",
    "it shows the significance of those anime among others .    [",

    "a new way of representing anime similarity has been proposed by applying the minimum spanning tree . here , we used similarity measurement , called crew similarity , as an addition to the commonly used similarity measurements , namely scores and topics .",
    "the results show that using a minimum spanning tree , a similar anime can be obtained easily by looking at the graph .",
    "moreover , we found that anime such as one piece , naruto , and bleach are considered as the most significant anime based on the centrality calculations .",
