    "recently , bouncing models of the universe were revived in the framework of string cosmology @xcite , since it is possible to generate a scale invariant spectrum of density fluctuations in the pre - bounce phase .",
    "specific realizations are e.g. cyclic / ekpyrotic models of the universe @xcite or the pre - big bang scenario @xcite .",
    "the main problem for such models to succeed lies in the fact that the bounce itself is often singular in the models studied so far @xcite .",
    "this makes matching conditions a necessity @xcite which are , unfortunately , rather ambiguous .",
    "in addition , fluctuations often become non perturbative near a singularity @xcite . in the few toy models of regular bouncing cosmologies known in the literature",
    ", the actual bounce has a strong impact on the evolution of perturbations @xcite .",
    "what is more , the models are often technically challenging at the perturbative level and unfortunately inconsistent methods were proposed in the literature .",
    "consequently , bouncing models have not been taken seriously as alternatives to the inflationary paradigm @xcite .    in this article",
    "we will construct a simple regular toy model , for which one can compute analytically how perturbations evolve through the bounce .",
    "we find a red spectral index for scalar perturbations that is ruled out by observations @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the detailed mechanism providing the bounce has a strong impact on the spectrum .    in order to generate a bounce within pure four dimensional general relativity",
    ", one has to violate various energy conditions .",
    "the usual mechanism in the literature involves the addition of an extra exotic matter field that becomes dominant during the bounce @xcite ( see also @xcite for an @xmath2 regularized bounce , @xcite for a non - singular cosmology achieved by higher derivative modification of general relativity , or @xcite for a bounce induced by a general - covariant , @xmath3-duality - invariant , non - local dilaton potential ) .",
    "the presence of a second matter field , and perturbations in it , is one physical origin for the sensitivity to the type of bounce one is considering .",
    "we will not add an additional matter field , but use an ingredient motivated by string theory : extra dimensions .",
    "if we assume one additional dimension , the effective four dimensional friedmann equation will show corrections proportional to @xmath0 at high energy densities .",
    "if the extra dimension is space - like , we have the usual randall sundrum setup @xcite . in that case ,",
    "@xmath4 and @xmath0 have the same sign , and no bounce will occur",
    ".    however , if we assume the additional dimension to be time - like , this sign will flip and thus it will cause a bounce when @xmath0 becomes dominant @xcite .",
    "we are aware of complexities associated with an extra time - like dimension ; for instance , existence of tachyonic modes and possible violation of causality , or possible appearance of negative norm states ( see @xcite for more discussion regarding these issues ) .",
    "we will not touch on those issues , but take the modification of the friedmann equations as a simple toy model that could also arise by other means .",
    "the outline of the article is as follows : first , we work out the background solution based on the above idea in section [ secbgr ] .",
    "we find a whole class of simple , analytically known , bouncing cosmologies , either big bang avoiding ones , for usual matter content , or big rip avoiding ones , for phantom matter",
    ". we will then focus on one specific big bang avoiding bounce by considering radiation as the matter content  this seems to be the most conservative choice to us .",
    "in section [ secpert ] we discuss scalar perturbations and compute analytically the spectrum of fluctuations in the post bounce era , for bunch - davis vacuum initial condition in the pre - bounce era .",
    "we find a red spectrum with a spectral index of @xmath1 , thus ruling out this model as a realistic one .",
    "we also find that the background cosmology around the bounce dictates the deformation of the spectrum through the transition . in section",
    "[ interpret ] , we conclude that it is challenging for the bounce in cyclic / ekpyrotic models of the universe to leave the spectrum unaffected . the only way to check if this is the case is by finding a regularized version of the proposed scenarios and following the perturbations explicitly through the bounce .    in section [ secvector ] , we discuss vector perturbations and find that they remain perturbative during the bounce . finally in section [ sectensor ] , we derive analytically the evolution of gravitational waves as they pass through the bounce .",
    "we find a blue spectrum of gravitational waves in the post bounce era on large scales , and an amplitude that depends on the details of the bounce .",
    "we use a metric with negative signature , scale factor @xmath5 , cosmic time @xmath6 and , for simplicity , we work with a flat universe , so that @xmath7 considering a modified version of the randall sundrum ( rs ) scenario @xcite , originating e.g. by having an extra time - like dimension @xcite we have the modified einstein equations @xmath8 where @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 is the fundamental 5-dimensional planck mass . for simplicity and",
    "since we are primarily interested in the high energy modifications due to @xmath12 , we fine tuned the model such that the effective four dimensional cosmological constant vanishes and we neglected the projected weyl tensor .",
    "@xmath12 is quadratic in the energy momentum tensor @xmath13 and is given by @xcite @xmath14 \\ , .",

    "this modification will yield a class of non singular bounces we shall examine below . if we consider an ideal fluid with @xmath15 the quadratic term becomes @xmath16 we may rephrase the quadratic corrections in terms of a second ideal fluid with @xmath17 where @xmath18 .",
    "the `` two fluids '' are of course related and represent only one degree of freedom . if we have an equation of state between @xmath19 and @xmath20 , that is @xmath21 , we get @xmath22 with @xmath23 .",
    "it will become useful to write @xmath24 so that @xmath25 . as a consequence of the equations of state we get @xmath26 the friedmann equation reads now @xmath27 and has the solution @xmath28^{1/n}\\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for @xmath29 .",
    "thus for any positive @xmath30 we get a regular bounce at @xmath31 with minimal scale factor @xmath32 e.g. for dust @xmath33 , radiation @xmath34 , stiff ( holographic ) matter ( @xmath35 ) etc .",
    "negative @xmath30 corresponds to matter that violates the null energy condition ( nec ) .",
    "however , there is no big rip , but a bounce at the maximal scale factor @xmath36 .",
    "such a phantom bounce was recently proposed in @xcite , but no analytic solution was given .",
    "if we also introduce the characteristic time scale of the bounce @xmath37 we may write @xmath38    the relation between cosmic time @xmath6 and conformal time @xmath39 is given by @xmath40 where @xmath41 is a generalized hypergeometric function , but we will not make use of this relation in the following analysis .",
    "let us turn our attention to perturbations and examine how they evolve through a big bang avoiding bounce with minimal scale factor .",
    "this is the most interesting case , because it could be seen as a simple toy model for a regularized version of the bounce occurring in the cyclic scenario .",
    "it is a toy model , since we remain at the four dimensional effective description throughout .",
    "we will comment on this issue in section [ interpret ] .    in the following",

    "henceforth , one might expect difficulties in deriving a single second order differential equation for @xmath64 .",
    "a method to deal with this problem , in the case of adiabatic perturbation or @xmath65 , was advocated in @xcite and subsequently used e.g. in @xcite and the previous versions of the article : one splits @xmath64 in two components , each of which satisfies a regular second order differential equation . however ,",
    "this method is inconsistent with other constraint equations , like the fluid conservation equations in the case of true two fluid models , as was explicitly shown in @xcite , or in our model the fact that the density of the second fluid is related to the first fluid .",
    "there , an alternative method was introduced , which we shall employ in the following .",
    "since the universe was radiation dominated before the period of recombination , let us restrict ourselves to @xmath66 such that @xmath67 where , @xmath68 is the rescaled time .",

    "let us have a look at the problematic region around @xmath77 , the boundaries of the region where the _ null energy condition _ is violated .",
    "the nontrivial question is whether @xmath76 remains continuous and smooth near these points or not .",
    "this question has been the object of study in @xcite , which provides analytic solutions and a detailed discussion in the case of adiabatic perturbations .",
    "consequently , we will expand @xmath76 near these points to find the two independent analytic solutions , as proposed in @xcite .",
    "our final goal is to compute the spectrum @xmath78 long after the bounce ( @xmath79 ) , while specifying the initial conditions for each fourier mode @xmath76 well before the bounce ( @xmath80 ) . to achieve that",
    ", we will find approximate analytic solutions within different regions and match them together . in this way",
    ", we will be able to compute analytically the spectral index @xmath81 .",
    "let us start in the limit @xmath82 . in that case one can introduce the gauge invariant variable @xmath83 in terms",
    "of which the action takes the simple form of a scalar field ( see @xcite for a detailed discussion ) so that the equation of motion reads @xmath84 with @xmath85 and @xmath86 since the universe is radiation dominated , @xmath87 vanishes and we can solve ( [ eomv ] ) @xmath88 where we imposed quantum mechanical initial conditions for @xmath83 , that is @xmath89 and the normalization condition @xmath90 .    the variable @xmath83 is related to @xmath76 via @xmath91 in that regime .",
    "if we use the background solution in the limit @xmath80 we get @xmath92 as an approximate analytical solution for @xmath64 .",
    "the overall scale is given by @xmath93 which is a free parameter in our model , subject to mild constraints , e.g. @xmath94 should be larger than the planck time , but smaller than the time of nucleosynthesis . however , we will not need to specify its value if we scale the spectrum appropriately .    similarly , for @xmath79 the general solution of @xmath95",
    "can be written as @xmath96 where the @xmath97 are constants .",
    "for @xmath98 we can neglect the @xmath99-dependence of ( [ maineom ] ) , that is we can use @xmath100 which is solved by @xmath101 where @xmath102\\,,\\\\ d_1&=&1+\\frac{\\sqrt{41}}{4}\\,,\\\\ n_2&=&\\left[\\frac{15-\\sqrt{41}}{8},\\frac{9-\\sqrt{41}}{8}\\right]\\,,\\\\ d_2&=&1-\\frac{\\sqrt{41}}{4}\\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath103 is the generalized hypergeometric function .    close to @xmath104 we can taylor - expand ( [ maineom ] ) so that we get @xmath105 where we introduced @xmath106 we will now follow @xcite to solve this equation near @xmath104 : if @xmath107 remains bounded , we get one independent solution from which we can deduce the other one by means of the wronskian method . in this way , we arrive at @xmath108 note that it would be justified to neglect the @xmath99 dependence in this solution . for the detailed reasoning as to why this solution is appropriate we refer the reader to @xcite .",
    "last but not least , we have to find a solution for the actual bounce , that is for @xmath109 and @xmath110 . the relevant equation of motion in this regime is @xmath111 which is solved by @xmath112 with @xmath113 , @xmath114 and @xmath115 whittakers functions .",
    "note that the solution is well behaved throughout the actual bounce .",
    "all that is left to do is to match all the solutions smoothly . to be specific one has to use ( [ initialphi ] ) for @xmath116 , ( [ solbefore ] ) for @xmath117 , ( [ soltaylor ] ) for @xmath118 , ( [ solbounce ] ) for @xmath119 , ( [ soltaylor ] ) for @xmath120 , ( [ solbefore ] ) for @xmath121 and finally ( [ solaway ] ) for @xmath122 with some small @xmath123",
    "this straightforward but tedious calculation results in a spectral index of @xmath124 which is independent of the choice of @xmath123 .. the reason the index is not effected by the choice of @xmath123 lies in the fact that ( [ soltaylor ] ) becomes independent of @xmath99 if @xmath110 . ]",
    "this index is of course in conflict with the observed nearly scale invariant spectrum .",
    "a few words regarding the validity of the matching procedure might be in order .",
    "lets first consider the matching at @xmath125 : to either consider the term @xmath126 or the term stemming from @xmath127 in ( [ maineom ] ) and match at the point where both are equal is indeed a standard procedure that was employed and tested ( e.g. numerically ) at various instances .",
    "for example , in the framework of a bouncing universe it was used in @xcite and verified numerically in the limit @xmath110 , .",
    "one can simply check the validity of this matching for our case since the solutions of ( [ afternec ] ) as well as equations ( [ initialphi ] ) and ( [ postbouncesol ] ) , around @xmath128 behave as @xmath129 where @xmath130 s and @xmath131 s are constant .",
    "this ensures a smooth matching of these solutions at these points .",
    "also , one could successfully use the same matching procedure in the study of fluctuations in an inflationary universes , even though a more elegant procedure is available ( see e.g. chapter 13 of @xcite for a detailed discussion ) .",
    "the remaining matchings occur close to @xmath132 and do not influence the spectral index as long as we are confident that the solutions are regular ( as is the case for our scenario ) , since all equations dictating the matching conditions are independent of @xmath99 in the limit of @xmath110 .    as a consequence",
    ", we will be able to give a simplified analytical argument in the next section yielding the same spectral index .",
    "thereafter , we compare our result with related studies in the literature like @xcite .",
    "we would like to provide some simple insight into our result of @xmath1 from the previous section .",
    "as we mentioned earlier , it can be shown that the solutions of the corresponding equations around @xmath133 have the following asymptotic @xmath72 dependence @xmath134 this makes an analytic tracking of the calculation very easy : on the one hand , the smooth matching conditions are satisfied by requiring @xmath135 and on the other hand , the proper @xmath99 dependence of @xmath136 and @xmath137 can be enforced through the the appropriate initial conditions leading to ( [ initialphi ] ) .",
    "taylor expanding ( [ initialphi ] ) in the limit @xmath138 results in @xmath139 so that we have @xmath140 next , note that the transfer functions relating @xmath141 and @xmath142 to the post - bounce coefficients @xmath143 and @xmath144 have to be independent of @xmath99 , since the equations governing the regime in between @xmath145 and @xmath146 are independent of @xmath99 .",
    "in fact , our equation have regular solutions throughout this region so that it is reasonable to deduce @xmath147 where @xmath148 and @xmath149 have to be some constant numbers .",
    "consequently the total transfer functions will be @xmath150 finally , making use of the above equations and @xmath151 for small @xmath99 according to ( [ a1b1 ] ) , we can calculate the power spectrum for @xmath152 , the non - decaying mode of ( [ finalmode ] ) @xmath153 henceforth , we conclude a spectral index of @xmath154      in order to provide a quick check of our analytic arguments , we integrated equation ( [ maineom ] ) with a 4/5th - order runge - kutta method , as implemented in maple v9 . starting the numerical treatment at @xmath145 with initial conditions given by ( [ initialphi ] ) and evaluating the final spectrum at @xmath155 yields a spectral index of @xmath1 , fig.[fig1 ] .",
    "the computations in maple were done with 120 digits accuracy ; nevertheless , it should be noted that the amplitude can not be recovered properly by the simple numerical method used , due to the non - trivial nature of the equation of motion near the bounce .",
    "however , this does not effect the spectral index since the actual bounce is @xmath156-independent , as can be seen in ( [ eomforsolbounce ] ) .",
    "the numerical integration of ( [ maineom ] ) yields the spectrum ( [ defspectrum ] ) evaluated at @xmath155 ( dots ) ; the solid line corresponds to a spectral index of @xmath1 , in agreement with the analytic result ( [ analyticresult ] ) .",
    "higher order effects in @xmath99 are accounted for by letting @xmath99 cover a broad range from @xmath157 down to @xmath158 . ]",
    "our result of the previous section clearly shows that for the specific bouncing cosmology considered , both modes ( the initial constant one and the growing one ) will pass through the bounce , but it is the mode with the redder spectrum , i.e. the growing mode for the bunch - davis vacuum , that dictates the final shape of the post - bounce spectrum . henceforth , we observe mode mixing in a model with only one degree of freedom and no spatial curvature .",
    "one has to be more careful to draw such conclusion for more general cases involving two different fluids ( constrained by an adiabatic condition in other backgrounds ) , since the matching procedure at @xmath159 is not that simple in general . to be more specific",
    ", the feature of the bounce which is crucial for determining the approximate behavior of the out coming spectrum , besides knowing the existence and regularity of the solutions throughout the bounce region , is the correction to the equation of motion ( [ afternec ] ) due to the second fluid .",
    "this is the region where modes just turned non oscillatory and corrections due to the bounce have to be considered , because they are crucial for the solution .",
    "recently , a wide class of bouncing cosmologies with two independent fluids was discussed in @xcite by bozza and veneziano .",
    "one might think that , in their notation , our class of bouncing universes corresponds to @xmath160 , @xmath161 , @xmath162 and @xmath66 .",
    "this would put it into region c of @xcite and a spectral index of @xmath163 would result according to @xcite .",
    "however the model of @xcite differs from our bouncing universe , since @xmath160 only enforces the adiabatic condition on each fluid separately and while no intrinsic entropy modes for each fluid are considered , two independent initial conditions for each of these fluids are assumed . in our model",
    "the `` two fluids '' are indeed related , so that the total pressure becomes a function of the total energy ( as a consequence only one initial condition can be specified ) . in other words ,",
    "we have enforced the adiabatic condition in its strong interpretation .",
    "it should also be noted , the approximation scheme employed there , differs considerably from ours , involving an expansion in @xmath156 and a dimensional argument for the contribution of the bounce ( no explicit solution for the bounce was used ) .",
    "henceforth , the results of @xcite can not be applied to our model .",
    "a few words regarding ekpyrotic / cyclic scenarios are needed : in @xcite there is a mechanism present that generates a scale invariant spectrum before the bounce @xcite .",
    "it was shown in @xcite , that this spectrum will not get transferred to the post - bounce era , if perturbations evolve independently of the details of the bouncing phase . furthermore , the main conclusion of @xcite was , that a smooth bounce in four dimensions is not able to generate a scale invariant spectrum via the mode mixing technique . however , all these arguments were specific to bouncing cosmologies in four dimensional gravity .",
    "so far , the effective four dimensional description breaks down for all proposed cyclic models @xcite near the bounce , and the bounce itself is singular @xcite .",
    "thus , it is of prime interest to search for a fully regularized bounce in cyclic / ekpyrotic models of the universe , so that one can compute the spectrum of perturbations explicitly in a full five dimensional setting - see e.g. @xcite for a recent proposal and @xcite for an argument that mode mixing can occur in the full five dimensional setup .",
    "our results confirm that it is challenging for such a model to succeed , but not impossible .",
    "vector perturbations ( vp ) have recently caught attention in the context of bouncing cosmologies , due to their growing nature in a contracting universe @xcite . in the context of a regularized bounce that we are discussing ,",
    "vp remain finite and well behaved , as we shall see now .",
    "the most general perturbed metric including only vp is given by @xcite @xmath164 where the vectors @xmath165 and @xmath166 are divergenceless , that is @xmath167 and @xmath168 .",
    "a gauge invariant vp can be defined as @xcite @xmath169    the most general perturbation of the energy momentum tensor including only vp is given by @xcite @xmath170 where @xmath171 and @xmath172 are divergenceless .",
    "furthermore the perturbation in the 4-velocity is related to @xmath172 via @xmath173 gauge invariant quantities are given by @xmath174 and @xmath171 .    from now on we work in newtonian gauge , where @xmath175 so that @xmath176 coincides with @xmath165 and @xmath177 with @xmath51 .",
    "note that there is no residual gauge freedom after going to newtonian gauge . for simplicity",
    "we assume the absence of anisotropic stress , @xmath178 , so that @xmath179 the resulting equations of motion read @xmath180 equation ( [ eoms ] ) is easily intergrated for each fourier mode , yielding @xmath181 where @xmath182 is time independent . since @xmath183",
    ", there is no divergent mode present .",
    "equation ( [ eomv ] ) is an algebraic equation for each fourier mode of the velocity perturbation @xmath172 .",
    "since @xmath184 becomes zero shortly before and after the bounce , it seems like @xmath172 has to diverge before the bounce ",
    "however , all that this is telling us is that @xmath172 is not the right variable to focus on : we should focus on the combination of @xmath172 and @xmath185 that appears in the perturbation of the effective total energy momentum tensor , that is @xmath186 .",
    "this combination is well behaved , and in fact one can check that it is always smaller than either @xmath187 or @xmath188 if we impose appropriately small initial conditions for @xmath182 .",
    "thus the perturbative treatment of vp is consistent .",
    "in this section we calculate the amplitude and spectral index of gravity waves , corresponding to tensor perturbations of the metric , in a radiation dominated universe .",
    "because the complete five dimensional calculation is very complicated we will continue using the theory of linear perturbations in a four dimensional effective field theory .",
    "we include only the corrections @xmath189 , due to fifth dimension , entering through the evolution of the background .    in the linear theory of cosmological perturbations",
    ", tensor perturbations can be added to the background metric via @xcite @xmath190\\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath191 has to satisfy @xmath192 thus @xmath191 has only two degrees of freedom which correspond to the two polarizations of gravity waves .",
    "one can show ( see @xcite ) that the amplitude @xmath193 for each of these polarizations has to obey @xmath194 where @xmath195 .",
    "note that gravity waves do not couple to energy or pressure and that they are gauge invariant from the start .",
    "if the second term dominates over @xmath196 in the above equation @xmath197 will exhibit oscillatory solutions , and if the gradient term is negligible we will have @xmath198 , or , in other words , @xmath193 is almost constant . using the standard fourier decomposition we get for each fourier mode @xmath199",
    "therefore , @xmath200 sets a scale for the behavior of each mode .",
    "this is very similar to the role of the hubble radius for inflationary scenarios , but rather than being almost constant , @xmath200 is more like a potential barrier in quantum mechanics : @xmath201 as fig .",
    "[ v ] shows , @xmath202 rises up to @xmath203 around the bounce but falls off very quickly as @xmath204 .",
    "@xmath202 sets a scale for the behavior of each mode , it rises up to @xmath203 around the bounce but falls off very quickly as @xmath205 . ]",
    "thus , for @xmath206 , the solutions of equation ( [ eqgrav ] ) are oscillatory .",
    "this implies that we can set our initial conditions according to the bunch - davis vacuum at the initial time @xmath207 .",
    "we get @xmath208 long before the bounce and it will remain basically unchanged throughout the bounce .",
    "we easily compute the spectrum of perturbations and the spectral index for these modes to be @xmath209    implying that , for @xmath206 , we are simply left with vacuum fluctuations with an ever decaying amplitude .      but first , we need to estimate the solutions for @xmath225 ( i.e. @xmath226 ) that is for @xmath227 . unfortunately , unlike the case of most potential barriers in quantum mechanics , we can not use the wkb approximation to calculate the outgoing spectrum , since the condition @xmath228 is not satisfied in this regime .",
    "fortunately we can still approximate the solution of equation ( [ eqgrav ] ) perturbatevely in orders of @xmath229 ) for @xmath230 .",

    "we first note that , to lowest order in @xmath242 , the constant mode in the pre - collapse phase ( growing mode for h ) , matches onto the growing mode in the post - collapse phase ( constant mode for h ) , without any change in the spectral shape . as we mentioned before , for a bunch - davis vacuum one simply takes @xmath223 and @xmath224 .",
    "the resulting power - spectrum for such a case is @xmath243 the above spectrum is oscillatory and , for @xmath244 , it is oscillating so fast that one could conclude an almost flat ( @xmath245 ) effective spectrum , with a decaying amplitude .",
    "however , if @xmath246 or in other words @xmath247 , which is the case for super - hubble wavelengths , the above equation simplifies to @xmath248    thus , we get a non - decaying mode which has a blue spectrum ( @xmath249 ) .",
    "notice , the amplitude of the power spectrum was dictated directly by the scales and details of the bounce .",
    "this result is in agreement with the conclusions of @xcite , where a scale factor somewhat similar to our background scale factor was used .",
    "we constructed a wide class of regular bouncing universes , with a smooth transition from contraction to expansion .",
    "this was motivated by open questions regarding the evolution of perturbations during singular bouncing cosmologies in string cosmology , occurring e.g. in the cyclic scenario .",
    "the bounce is caused by the presence of an extra time - like dimension , which introduces corrections to the effective four dimensional einstein equations at large energy densities .",
    "if matter respecting the null energy condition is present , a big bang avoiding bounce results , and for phantom matter a big rip avoiding bounce emerges .",
    "we find analytic expressions for the scale factor in all cases .      for scalar perturbations",
    "we compute analytically a spectral index of @xmath1 , thus ruling out such a model as a realistic candidate .",
    "we also find the spectrum to be sensitive to the bounce region , in agreement to the majority of regular toy models discussed in the literature .",
    "we conclude that it is challenging , but not impossible , for cyclic / ekpyrotic models to succeed , if one can find a regularized version .",
    "next , we discussed vector perturbations which are known to be problematic in bouncing cosmologies , due to their growing nature .",
    "we checked explicitly that they remain perturbative and small if compared to the background energy density and pressure .",
    "we concluded with a discussion of gravitational waves .",
    "the transfer function was computed analytically and we showed that the shape of the spectrum is unchanged in general . in the special case of vacuum initial conditions ,",
    "the spectral index in post bounce era for super - hubble wavelengths is blue .",
    "however , the amplitude turned out to be sensitive to the details of our model .    to summarize , having an explicit realization of e.g. the cyclic model of the universe that features a regular bounce it might be possible to produce a scale invariant spectrum .",
    "henceforth , the challenge for the cyclic model is twofold :    1 .   to find a convincing mechanism that regularizes the bounce .",
    "2 .   to deal with the perturbations in a full five dimensional setup and to take into account the presence of an inhomogeneous bulk as inevitable by the presence of branes .",
