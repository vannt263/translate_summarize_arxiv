    "in the last years , experimental achievements have given the possibility to study friction at the microscale ( nanofriction ) , which has renewed the interest in a variety of theoretical and applied aspects of tribology .",
    "the prototypical experimental setup is that of the atomic force microscope ( afm ) where a nanometer size tip can be brought into contact with a substrate , and the frictional behavior of the system can be studied in detail @xcite .",
    "other related instruments , like the surface force apparatus@xcite have expanded the possibilities to cover other regions of parameters , allowing for instance to study somewhat larger contact areas , in the range of microns .",
    "the properties of nanofriction differ substantially from those at a macroscopic scale .",
    "one reason for this is that macroscopic friction originates typically in a set of sparse contacts located at different spatial positions , and the observed behavior is a non - trivial combination of these individual contacts .",
    "the now available experimental techniques give the opportunity to study one such individual contact in detail .",
    "one not fully attained goal in the field of friction is precisely to correlate the results of well controlled nanofriction experiments with those of friction at a macroscopic scale .",
    "for instance , in the largest scale realization available , namely that corresponding to seismic phenomena , friction displays features that seem to be typical of this large scale .",
    "one of them is velocity weakening ( vw ) .",
    "this refers to a friction process in which the average friction force is a decreasing function of the relative velocity of the sliding bodies .",
    "it is widely accepted that vw is a necessary condition for seismic phenomena to look the way they do@xcite .",
    "although on a phenomenological perspective velocity weakening is successfully modeled by the so - called rate and state equations@xcite , there is no general agreement on a consistent first principle description of the phenomenon .",
    "it is however agreed upon the fact that vw must be induced by some kind of mechanism that tend to strengthen the contact between the two sliding bodies if they remain in the same relative position for a long time .",
    "probably the most typical feature of friction at the seismic scale is the existence of aftershocks ( ass ) .",
    "they occur as secondary shocks after some large earthquake .",
    "ass occur exclusively due to an internal dynamics of the sliding bodies , and are not directly related to the driving mechanism .",
    "ass have been shown to be compatible with rate and state equations displaying vw@xcite .",
    "in addition , in recently studied numerical models of seismicity , internal relaxation on the plates have shown to give rise at the same time to vw and ass.@xcite    the dependence of friction force on the relative velocity between the two sliding objects is routinely measured in nanofriction experiments . in many cases ,",
    "this dependence follows an increasing dependence on velocity . in a minority of cases , vw is observed .",
    "vw is well established at the scale probed by the surface force apparatus , where it has been directly measured@xcite .",
    "single contact afm measurements have sometimes also found a vw friction law .",
    "the physical mechanisms that have been proposed as generating vw in nanofriction experiments typically include the existence of some internal dynamics in the contact that strengthens the tip - substrate interaction as a function of time .",
    "for instance , in @xcite it was argued that in the afm , capillary condensation of water molecules occur at the contact between tip and substrate .",
    "the vw effect observed in this case is suggested to be due to the reduced ability of the system to maintain a stable capillary neck as the sliding velocity increases . on the other hand , in @xcite ,",
    "vw was associated with surfaces capable of forming hydrogen bond networks , in a process that proceeds according to some internal time scale .",
    "recently , carpick _",
    "et al._@xcite have found evidence that micro - contacts between solids can become chemically stronger as a function of time , an effect that can potentially produce vw . in any case , vw is a manifestation of the existence of some internal dynamics of the contact , with its own time scale .",
    "this time scale will ultimately determine the velocity range for which vw is observed .",
    "to our knowledge ass have not yet been observed in any nanofriction experiment . actually ,",
    "the only context where ass are well characterized is that of seismic phenomena . observation of ass requires first of all of a non - smooth sliding behavior , in such a way that relative displacement of the sliding materials occur discontinuously , and a sufficiently low relative velocity in order to clearly separate the time scales of main shock ( produced directly by the driving ) and ass . in the seismic context",
    "the discontinuous events are the earthquakes . in nanofriction",
    "these are the ` slip ' stages of a stick - slip process.@xcite yet , ass are a very special type of abrupt sliding events .",
    "they are events that are caused by previous slip events , and that are unrelated directly to the driving .",
    "this means for instance , that if driving is stopped at some time @xmath0 , there can still be some events occurring at @xmath1 which are aftershocks of those that occurred at @xmath2 .",
    "note that an unambiguous classification of an event as an aftershock requires a sufficiently slow sliding that does not trigger additional events in the mean time between the original event and its ass .",
    "also , it is clear from this description that ass require the existence of some internal dynamics of the contact , in addition to the dynamics provided by the external driving .    the simplest model that describes a non - uniform , stick - slip dynamics in friction experiments is the prandtl - tomlinson ( pt ) model @xcite , which we briefly review in the next section . in its simplest form",
    ", the pt model does not display vw . in this paper",
    "we analyze two variants of the basic pt model that produce vw , and also ass .",
    "they describe two different implementations of relaxation mechanisms in the system",
    ". one can be applied ( although not exclusively ) to describe a viscous damping in the tip of the afm , and the second models the possibility of aging effects in the contact region of the sliding objects .",
    "we show clearly how ass become progressively more defined as the relative sliding velocity decreases .",
    "in addition to the constant velocity setup , we also study the response to sudden changes in the driving velocity , looking for typical signatures in the transient behavior of the friction force such as a stress peak at sliding initiation , and a gradual relaxation of stress upon sliding stop .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "we briefly review the basic phenomenology of the prandtl - tomlinson model that is relevant to our analysis , and discuss in detail the motivation of the two variants we will study . in section iii we show the results of the numerical simulations in a constant velocity set up , emphasizing the similarities and differences between the two , and showing in particular how ass appear . in section",
    "iv we give the results for some non - constant velocity protocols . finally , in section v , we summarize , and conclude .",
    "a basic understanding of the origin of friction in nanocontacts is provided by the prandtl - tomlinson ( pt ) model@xcite in which the contact is represented by a single variable @xmath3 evolving under the effect of some interaction potential @xmath4 , that can be written as the product of a nominal distance between the two surfaces @xmath5 and the normal force applied to the contact @xmath6 , namely @xmath7 . the variable @xmath3 is externally driven through an elastic coupling by a prescribed evolution @xmath8 . the pt model adapts particularly well to the case of the afm tip - substrate interaction , where it is usually considered that @xmath4 reflects the atomic corrugation potential .",
    "however , it has been used also to describe more general situations by using an appropriate disordered @xmath4 function , and having in mind that the distance between typical minima of the @xmath4 and the overall values of corrugation @xmath5 are now defined by the roughness associated to the substrate .    ,",

    " rapid \" degrees of freedom that are not explicitly taken into account in our description , which concentrates only in the ",
    "slow \" variable @xmath3 .",
    "the effect of stochastic forces is twofold .",
    "on one hand they produce an additional term on the dynamic equation of the form of a white external noise with an intensity that is a function of temperature .",
    "on the other hand they are responsible for the appearance of  friction \" terms , namely additional forces that are proportional to minus the time derivative of the slow variables in the problem . by introducing these terms ,",
    "we arrive at the basic equation describing the prandtl - tomlinson model@xcite : @xmath10 here @xmath8 represents the driving , which for a constant velocity situation is @xmath11 , and @xmath12 is the stochastic force associated to the fluctuating environment .",
    "the instantaneous friction between the surfaces can be considered to be measured by the stretching of the @xmath13 spring , and the average friction force can be evaluated as the temporal average of this quantity , namely @xmath14 we assume that the substrate potential term has some typical distance between minima @xmath15 , and typical height @xmath16 .",
    "we now give a brief overview of the phenomenology associated to this equation , and then discuss some possible variants that generate vw and other associated effects .",
    "we first describe the zero temperature case .",
    "the behavior of the system depends crucially on the ratio between @xmath13 and @xmath17 . for @xmath18",
    ", there is a single equilibrium position of the tip for any value @xmath19 of the driving .",
    "this means that the dynamics is quasi - static for a vanishing driving velocity , and that the friction force vanishes in this limit . in the opposite case @xmath20",
    "there are metastable configurations of the tip , and abrupt transitions among them , as driving proceeds .",
    "this produces a finite friction force in the limit of driving velocity @xmath21 . from now on",
    ", this is the case we consider . at large driving velocities ,",
    "the friction force becomes proportional to velocity , with a pre - factor given by the friction coefficient @xmath22 .",
    "a crossover velocity that is order @xmath23 can thus be defined , separating the high velocity regime of friction proportional to velocity , and a low velocity regime of rather constant friction force .",
    "we can formally describe this low velocity limit by taking @xmath24 in eq .",
    "( [ p - t ] ) .",
    "temperature produces important changes in the velocity dependence of friction at very low velocities .",
    "in fact , at finite temperature , the system has the possibility to overcome the energy barriers before the pulling takes the system at the mechanical instability point .",
    "since close to these instability points the energy barriers are much smaller for forward than for backward movements , the thermal jumps always reduce the stretching of the @xmath13 spring , reducing the friction force .",
    "the effect becomes more important as the velocity is reduced , leading typically to a logarithmic increase of friction force with velocity .",
    "a detailed account of this behavior can be found for instance in @xcite .",
    "temperature effects are typically important in afm measurements , at least at the lowest velocities , because of the small size and mass of the tip .",
    "they are less important when the size of the contact is larger , as in the surface force apparatus . here , in order to describe in the simplest possible form the effect of terms generating vw , we will work in the @xmath25 limit . also , as we are mostly interested in the limit of very small velocities , we will consider from now on the limit @xmath24 of eq .",

    "however , the instability occurs through a hopf bifurcation , and this modifies the velocity dependence , which now is of the form @xmath72 .",

    "<S> we study the frictional behavior of small contacts as those realized in the atomic force microscope and other experimental setups , in the framework of generalized prandtl - tomlinson models . </S>",
    "<S> particular attention is paid to mechanisms that generate velocity weakening , namely a decreasing average friction force with the relative sliding velocity . </S>",
    "<S> the mechanisms studied model the possibility of viscous relaxation , or aging effects in the contact . it is found that , in addition to producing velocity weakening , these mechanisms can also produce aftershocks at sufficiently low sliding velocities . </S>",
    "<S> this provides a remarkable analogy at the microscale , of friction properties at the macroscale , where aftershocks and velocity weakening are two fundamental features of seismic phenomena . </S>"
