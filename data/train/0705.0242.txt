    "the present paper , devoted to the scalar wave equation in a non - commutative schwarzschild space - time , is strongly motivated by three branches of modern gravitational physics : 0.3 cm ( i ) in their investigation of quantum amplitudes in black - hole evaporation @xcite , the authors of @xcite have considered emission of scalar radiation in a black - hole collapse problem , assuming non - spherical perturbations of the scalar field @xmath2 on the final surface @xmath3 , and that the intrinsic three - metric describes an exactly spherically - symmetric spatial gravitational field . 0.3 cm ( ii ) in general relativity , unexpected features of the asymptotic structure",
    "are already found to occur : massless scalar fields which have a bondi - type expansion in powers of @xmath4 near null past infinity do not have such an expansion near future null infinity ; solutions which have physically reasonable cauchy data may fail to have bondi - type expansions near null infinity @xcite .",
    "0.3 cm ( iii ) according to the models studied in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , the non - commutativity of spacetime can be encoded in the commutator of operators corresponding to spacetime coordinates , i.e. ( the integer @xmath5 below being even ) @xmath6={\\rm i } \\ ; \\theta^{\\mu \\nu } , \\ ;   \\mu,\\nu=1,2, ... ,d \\label{(1.1)}\\ ] ] when the antisymmetric matrix @xmath7 is taken to have a block - diagonal form @xmath8 with @xmath9 the parameter @xmath1 having dimension of length squared and being constant .",
    "as shown in @xcite , the constancy of @xmath1 is very important to obtain a consistent treatment of lorentz invariance and unitarity .",
    "the authors of @xcite solve the einstein equations with mass density of a static , spherically symmetric , smeared particle - like gravitational source as ( hereafter , in agreement with our earlier work @xcite , we use @xmath10 units ) @xmath11 which therefore plays the role of matter source .",
    "their resulting spherically symmetric metric is @xmath12 where , in terms of the lower incomplete gamma function @xmath13 we define the mass function @xcite @xmath14    thus , if one tries to study emission of scalar radiation as in @xcite but in the presence of a non - vanishing @xmath1 parameter ( cf @xcite for the pure gravity case ) , one is naturally led to study a scalar wave equation in a spherically symmetric spacetime whose metric is affected by @xmath1 , which is the goal of the present paper .",
    "section 2 builds conformal infinity for the space - time with metric ( 1.4 ) .",
    "section 3 , following @xcite , turns the scalar wave equation into an inhomogeneous euler  poisson  darboux equation .",
    "section 4 solves such an equation and shows under which conditions there is full qualitative agreement with general relativity .",
    "concluding remarks and open problems are presented in section 5 , while the appendices describe relevant mathematical details .",
    "inspired by general relativity , we define a new radial coordinate @xmath15 in such a way that @xmath16 this equation is solved by @xmath17 and the metric ( 1.4 ) can be re - expressed in the form @xmath18 where @xmath19 , \\varphi \\in [ 0,2\\pi]$ ] , and we have defined the ` retarded ' coordinate @xmath20-\\infty,\\infty [ , \\label{(2.4)}\\ ] ] and the ` advanced ' coordinate @xmath21-\\infty,\\infty[. \\label{(2.5)}\\ ] ] the equations ( 2.2 ) , ( 2.4 ) and ( 2.5 ) yield @xmath22}. \\label { ( 2.6)}\\ ] ] to lowest order , eq .",
    "( 2.6 ) is solved by @xmath23 , and on defining @xmath24 one finds , by iterated approximations , the asymptotic expansion @xmath25    the limit @xmath26 with @xmath27 fixed defines future null infinity @xmath28 ; the limit @xmath29 with @xmath30 fixed defines past null infinity @xmath31 , while the limit @xmath32 with @xmath33 fixed defines spacelike infinity , i.e. the point @xmath34 .",
    "the figures below show the behaviour of the denominator @xmath35 in eq .",
    "( 2.1 ) for various values of @xmath1 .",
    "interestingly , the occurrence of @xmath1 does not introduce new singularities with respect to general relativity .",
    "it is actually simpler to introduce the coordinates @xmath36 and @xmath37 separately , which yields the conformally rescaled , `` unphysical '' metrics ( here @xmath38 , and @xmath39 is the metric on a unit two - sphere ) @xmath40 = -(f^{2}-2mf^{3})du^{2}+2du \\ ; df + d\\sigma^{2 } , \\label{(2.9)}\\ ] ] and @xmath41 these metrics are manifestly regular and analytic on their respective hypersurfaces @xmath42 , since their determinants are equal to @xmath43 for all @xmath44 , including @xmath42 .",
    "the physical space - time corresponds to @xmath45 in ( 2.9 ) , and we can extend the manifold to include @xmath28 , given when @xmath42 . similarly , in ( 2.10 ) , the physical space - time corresponds to @xmath45 and can be extended to include @xmath31 , given when @xmath42 .",
    "only the boundary @xmath46 is adjoined to the space - time .    in common with general relativity ,",
    "we note here a difficulty that is encountered if we try to identify @xmath31 with @xmath28 .",
    "if we do extend the region of definition of ( 2.9 ) to include negative values of @xmath44 , and then make the replacement @xmath47 , we see that the metric has the form ( 2.10 ) ( with @xmath36 in place of @xmath37 ) but with a mass function @xmath48 in place of @xmath49 .",
    "thus , the extension across @xmath50 involves a reversal of the sign of the mass function , which is incompatible with eq .",
    "( 1.6 ) unless we advocate a discontinuity in the derivative of the curvature @xcite across @xmath51 .",
    "it is therefore not reasonable to identify @xmath28 with @xmath31 .    to sum up",
    ", we have two disjoint boundary hypersurfaces @xmath28 and @xmath31 , each of which is a cylinder with topology @xmath52 .",
    "it is clear from ( 2.9 ) and ( 2.10 ) that each of @xmath53 is a null hypersurface ( the induced metric at @xmath42 being degenerate ) .",
    "these null hypersurfaces are generated by rays ( given by @xmath54 , @xmath42 ) whose tangents are normals to the hypersurfaces .",
    "these rays may be taken to be the @xmath55 s of the topological product @xmath52 .",
    "the coordinates @xmath56 defined in ( 2.4 ) and ( 2.5 ) are not the most convenient for discussing the limits which define conformal infinity @xcite .",
    "we therefore define ( cf . @xcite ) a function @xmath57 by requiring that @xmath58 should be equal to @xmath15 in ( 2.2 ) , i.e. @xmath59 which implies @xmath60 equation ( 3.1 ) defines a one - parameter family of monotone decreasing @xmath61 functions taking values over the whole real line .",
    "the monotone decreasing character of @xmath62 is proved by imposing that @xmath63 .",
    "this is indeed satisfied for sufficiently small values of @xmath1 , so that @xmath64 , which is positive provided @xmath65 .",
    "a @xmath61 inverse function therefore exists , which makes it possible to define new coordinates @xmath66 according to ( cf @xcite ) @xmath67 @xmath68 where the integrals ( 3.3 ) and ( 3.4 ) involve the mass function @xmath69 . on defining @xmath38 as in section 2",

    "the second derivative @xmath129 , however , diverges near future null infinity , which implies that the presence of a conformal singularity at spacelike infinity affects the behaviour of scalar fields on future null infinity , reducing by a considerable amount their differentiability class .",

    "ever since penrose @xcite developed a geometrical picture of an isolated system in general relativity as a space - time admitting future and past null infinity ( with the associated fall - off of the metric along null geodesics going off to infinity ) , there has been always great interest in this coordinate - free way of bringing infinity to a ` finite distance ' and discussing the asymptotic structure of space - time .",
    "moreover , the conceptual revolution brought about by non - commutative geometry @xcite has led to an assessment of the very concept of space - time manifold @xcite , with ` corrections ' to it evaluated , for example , along the lines of the work in refs .",
