    "generation of mesoscopic entanglement in a bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) @xcite is still a challenge of fundamental research .",
    "a possible system for which entanglement could be achieved is a bec in a double - well potential  @xcite .",
    "while attractive condensates can become unstable  @xcite , for repulsive single species condensates the ground state is not the desired superposition  ( see , e.g. , ref  @xcite ) .",
    "nevertheless , by phase engineering fidelities ( i.e.  the probability to be in an ideal superposition ) of about  @xmath0 have been obtained numerically  @xcite .    in ref .",
    "@xcite we suggested to use a binary condensate to produce bell - like mesoscopic superpositions with fidelities above @xmath1 by using a method of tunneling control which was very recently realized experimentally in an optical lattice  @xcite .",
    "however , to achieve the entanglement generation , the ground state of a two - component condensate of exactly the same number of particles of each kind was followed adiabatically in a perfectly symmetric double well potential  @xcite .",
    "given the fact that even very small asymmetries can destroy entanglement properties of eigen - functions  @xcite , this rises the question if the generation of mesoscopic entanglement proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite would also be possible under more realistic conditions , i.e. , slightly different particle numbers and a small tilt .",
    "the focus of this manuscript is to investigate the scheme of entanglement generation including asymmetries in both the potential and the particle numbers . in sec .",

    "[ sec : e ] outlines the noticeable differences between the ideal case considered in ref .",
    "@xcite and the more realistic ( slightly asymmetric ) situation considered here for which the entanglement generation no longer is entirely adiabatic .",
    "to describe a binary bose - einstein condensate in a double well , we use the hamiltonian in two - mode approximation ( ref .",
    "@xcite cf .  ref .",
    "@xcite ) : @xmath2 where @xmath3 ( @xmath4 ) creates , respectively annihilates , a boson of type a ( b ) in well  @xmath5 , @xmath6 is the tunneling frequency , @xmath7 ( @xmath8 ) is the interaction parameter for atoms of type a ( b ) and @xmath9 models the interaction between distinguishable particles .",
    "such hamiltonians have also been used to describe entanglement generation beyond bec - physics  @xcite . the ( unwanted ) small tilt which might not be avoidable experimentally is represented by  @xmath10 .",
    "the time - dependent potential difference @xmath11 can be used to perform tunneling control via resonant tunneling  @xcite ( cf .  ref .",
    "references  @xcite generate multi - particle entanglement by periodic driving , @xmath12 to effectively renormalize the tunneling frequency  @xmath6 by the @xmath13-bessel function in the high frequency limit to @xmath14 this mechanism for tunneling control ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) , which on the single particle level has been investigated theoretically already for some 16 years  @xcite , has very recently been observed experimentally for a bose - einstein condensate in an optical lattice  @xcite .",
    "another possibility to achieve the entanglement generation of ref .",
    "@xcite is to decrease the tunneling frequency by increasing the distance  @xmath15 between the two wells .",
    "approximating the wave - functions of particles of mass  @xmath16 in the two wells by the ground states of harmonic oscillators of oscillation frequency  @xmath17 and oscillator length  @xmath18 , one obtains  @xcite @xmath19 for the tunneling frequency and @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the s - wave scattering length , for the interaction parameters of eq .",
    "( [ eq : h ] ) as a function of @xmath6 .",
    "a possible realization of such a model could be two hyperfine - states of , e.g , @xmath22rb .",
    "feshbach resonances for interaction between different hyper - fine states have been observed experimentally  @xcite , thus providing a way to slightly increase the interaction between distinguishable particles as compared to identical particles .    to coherently generate entanglement , ref .",
    "@xcite suggests to decrease the ( effective ) tunneling frequency for such a situation , thus adiabatically following the ground state towards highly entangled mesoscopic states . as decoherence - times tend to rapidly decrease with increasing particle numbers , not too large particle numbers should be used to investigate entanglement generation .",
    "experimentally , bose - einstein condensates of the order of 100 particles have been realized  @xcite ; in ref .",
    "@xcite we used a binary bec with exactly @xmath23 particles of each kind . here , deviations @xmath24 , @xmath25 up to @xmath26 will be considered .",
    "for the symmetric conditions of ref .",
    "@xcite the fidelity obtained by projecting the wave - function  @xmath27 on the bell state @xmath28 provides an excellent measure of entanglement generation , @xmath29 if @xmath30 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : oszi ] the tunneling frequency in an asymmetric double well containing a binary bec with @xmath31 is reduced linearly during half the time and during the other half @xmath6 held at zero : @xmath32    for a slightly tilted double well , the ground state can not be one of the two superpositions of eq .",
    "( [ eq : bell ] ) : in the limit @xmath33 the two wave - functions used in the superpositions  ( [ eq : bell ] ) do have different energies .",
    "thus , even if a perfect superposition was reached , the phase would oscillate similar to fig .",
    "[ fig : oszi ] .",
    "the fact that the fidelities stay below  @xmath34 indicates that more fock states then just those included in eq .",
    "( [ eq : bell ] ) . increasing",
    "the tilt by , say , a factor of ten would further increase the oscillation frequency as the energy difference between both wells increases while increasing it by a much larger factor would destroy the generation of mesoscopic superpositions .",
    "periodic driving introduces an additional frequency , thus leading to even larger oscillations frequencies in the fidelities .    for the purpose of identifying mesoscopic superpositions independent of these oscillations ,",
    "we define the modified fidelity : @xmath35 where @xmath36 and @xmath37 as for the usual fidelity , this measure is  @xmath34 for a perfect superposition and already @xmath38 might signify that there is no superposition at all .",
    "the modified fidelity  ( [ eq : fid ] ) can be derived by projecting the wavefunction on the superposition @xmath39 and maximizing the resulting projection @xmath40 as a function of @xmath41 .",
    "in order to understand why generation of mesoscopic superpositions is still possible , fig .  [",
    "fig : fid ] shows the modified fidelity  ( [ eq : fid ] ) for different ramping times  @xmath42 ( see eq .",
    "( [ eq : omega ] ) ) .",
    "if the ramping is done on too short time - scales , the oscillations characteristic for too fast , i.e.  non - adiabatic , ramping occur and high fidelities can not be reached .",
    "if , on the other hand , the ramping is done too slowly , the system does not reach a mesoscopic superpositions either as it adiabatically follows the ground state for too long and thus becomes rather asymmetric . for moderate ramping ,",
    "the system first adiabatically follows the ground state thus leading to a wave - function with a bimodal probability distribution .",
    "then , the symmetry of the wave - function is conserved ( instead of tunneling through energetically higher states with half the particles of at least one kind in both of the wells ) to finally reach a mesoscopic superposition .    if the tunneling control is done via slowly variing the amplitude  @xmath43 of periodic driving as in ref .",
