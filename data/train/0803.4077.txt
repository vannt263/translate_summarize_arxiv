    "cosmological simulations predict that a substantial fraction of stars in galaxies were stripped off during the assembly of a cluster of galaxies .",
    "these stars were dispersed into intracluster space and now recognized as the intracluster stellar population .",
    "this population is a sensitive probe of cluster assembly , and more generally , structure formation of the universe .",
    "the total amount , spatial distribution ( morphology ) , kinematics , and metallicty are among the key parameters which characterize the population .",
    "the intracluster stellar population has been observed as diffuse intracluster light @xcite , or as individual stars , i.e. , planetary nebulae @xcite , or as red giant stars @xcite .",
    "the intracluster planetary nebulae ( icpne ) are the only probe that enables us to investigate the kinematics of the intracluster stellar population .",
    "we launched a program to search for icpne in clusters of galaxies with a range of properties on the advent of subaru telescope and its wide - field camera , suprime - cam .",
    "initial targets of our program are the virgo cluster at the distance of @xmath1 and the coma cluster at @xmath2 .",
    "the virgo cluster is irregular and loose in shape , and dynamically unrelaxed containing a considerable fraction of spiral galaxies , while the coma cluster is regular and rich in shape , and dynamically more relaxed than the virgo cluster .",
    "we applied a conventional narrow band plus broad band imaging technique to the nearby virgo cluster .",
    "unique feature of our search is the use of two narrow band filters for h@xmath0 and [ o iii ] lines tuned for the cluster redshift .",
    "previous planetary nebula searches over the image of virgo ellipticals ( e.g , * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter jcf ) used the strongest [ o iii ] line only .",
    "the pne candidates selected by the [ o iii ] single line technique is contaminated by foreground and background emission line objects .",
    "especially , when the single line technique is used to search for icpne in the blank region free from virgo member galaxies , the contamination could dominate the candidates .",
    "use of the two lines and broad band images enabled us to identify secure icpne candidates .",
    "however , the follow - up spectroscopy is necessary to the final confirmation and kinematic studies .",
    "we used telescopio nazionale galileo ( tng ) 4 m telescope and very large telescope ( vlt ) for the follow - up spectroscopy .",
    "no imaging technique can be successfully applied to the detection of icpne in the distant coma cluster . at the coma distance , even the brightest pn",
    "is buried in the sky noise and undetectable in the narrow band image .",
    "increase of the signal - to - noise ratio of the emission lines by reducing the sky noise is critically important . to achieve this",
    ", we devised a multi - slit imaging spectroscopy ( msis ) technique , which was sucessfully applied to the coma cluster .",
    "observations , selection criteria for secure pne candidates , and initial results were described in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "only the outline is repeated here .",
    "[ okamura_fig1 ]    in 2001 march - april a field in the virgo cluster at ( @xmath0 , @xmath3)(j2000 ) = ( @xmath4 , + 12@xmath543@xmath658@xmath7 ) , just south of m84-m86 , was observed during the commissioning of the suprime - cam @xcite , at the prime focus of the subaru 8.2 m telescope @xcite .",
    "suprime - cam covers an area of 34@xmath8 of the sky , with a resolution of 0.@xmath92 pixel@xmath10 .",
    "the field was imaged through two narrow band and two broadband ( @xmath11 and @xmath12 ) filters .",
    "the two narrow band filters have ( @xmath13 , @xmath14 ) = ( 5021 , 74 ) and ( 6607 , 101 ) , corresponding to the [ o iii ] and h@xmath0 emissions at the redshift of the virgo cluster .",
    "exposure times are 900 , 720 , 3600 , and 8728 seconds for @xmath15 [ o iii ] , and h@xmath0 , respectively .",
    "we use the two - color diagram [ o iii ] - h@xmath0 versus [ o iii ] - ( v+r ) to select our emission - line objects .",
    "simulated populations of pne , single - lined emitters , and continuum sources were constructed and used to outline the regions in the two - color diagram inhabited by the different kinds of objects ( fig . 1 , left panel ) .",
    "on the basis of this simulation , we set selection criteria .",
    "two bright galaxies m86 ( ngc 4406 ) and m84 ( ngc 4374 ) appear in our field .",
    "these two galaxies were surveyed for pne by jcf , and we can evaluate our selection criteria against the jcf photometry of matched samples .",
    "the right panel of fig .",
    "1 shows the comparison for m84 field , where 74 objects are matched .",
    "we found that at least 39% contamination is present in the jcf sample selected by [ oiii ] line only .",
    "we carried out follow - up spectroscopy of the icpn candidates with multifiber flames spectrograph at ut2 on vlt @xcite .",
    "candidates were drawn from the three survey fields , fcj , core , and sub , as shown in the left panel of fig.2 .",
    "spectra covered a wavelength range of 500 , centered on 4797  with a resolution of @xmath16 .",
    "this gives a velocity resolution of 40 km s@xmath10 and a typical velocity error of 12 km s@xmath10 .",
    "a large fraction of the photometric candidates with m(5007)@xmath1727.2 were confirmed and @xmath184959 line of the [ o iii ] doublet was detected for the first time in about a half of confirmed icpne .",
    "a total of 40 icpne candidates ( 15/12/13 for fcj / core / sub fields ) were confirmed , and their radial velocities were measured .",
    "[ okamura_fig2 ]    radial velocity distributions of the icpne in the three fields are shown in the right panel of fig .",
    "2 . they are considerably different from each other .",
    "this confirms the view that virgo is a highly nonuniform and unrelaxed galaxy cluster , consisting of several subunits that have not yet had time to come to equilibrium in a common gravitational potential .",
    "as already mentioned , no imaging technique can be successfully applied to the detection of pne in the coma cluster .",
    "we devised a technique that is similar to the approach used to search for ly@xmath0-emitting galaxies at very high redshift @xcite .",
    "it combines multi - slit grism spectroscopy with a narrow band filter centered around the [ o iii ] @xmath185007 line at the redshift of the coma cluster .",
    "we use the faint object camera and spectrograph ( focas ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) at the cassegrain focus of subaru telescope ( see @xcite @xcite for the method and initial results ) .",
    "a mask of parallel multiple slits is used to obtain spectra of all pne that happen to lie behind the slits .",
    "because the [ o iii ] emission lines from pns are only a few kilometers per second wide , their entire flux still falls into a small number of pixels in the two - dimensional spectrum , determined by the slit width and seeing . on the contrary ,",
    "the sky emission is dispersed in wavelength , allowing a large increase in the signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) .",
    "the narrow band filter limits the length of the spectra on the ccd detector , so that many slits can be exposed .",
    "this technique , which is a blind search , is referred to as the multi - slit imaging spectroscopy ( msis ) technique .",
    "no conventional imaging technique can decrease the sky surface brightness in a similar way .",
    "figure 3 shows the msis field and the slit mask .",
    "the circular focas field of view ( fov ) has @xmath19 in diameter ( 166 kpc at the assumed distance of 95 mpc ) .",
    "the spatial resolution of focas is @xmath20 pixel@xmath10 , so the @xmath19 diameter corresponds to 3600 pixels .",
    "the light passing through the narrow band filter and a @xmath21 wide long slit , and dispersed by the grism , projects down to a spectrum of about 43 pixels .",
    "a mask was therefore manufactured with uniform long slits spaced every 50 pixels and interrupted only by short sections to ensure mechanical stability .",
    "we used 300b grating , which gives a measured dispersion of 1.45  pixel@xmath10 on the two focas ccd chips .",
    "the effective spectral resolution is 7.3 , or 440 km s@xmath10 .",
    "we also used the n512 filter with fwhm 60 , centered at @xmath22 = 5121 , the wavelength of the redshifted [ o iii ] emission from a pn at the mean recession velocity of the coma cluster ( 6853 km s@xmath10 ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the 60  fwhm includes only @xmath23 the velocity dispersion of galaxies . by taking exposures at 8 positions sucessively shifted along the dispersion direction",
    ", we can roughly cover the whole field of view .",
    "observations at three mask positions centered on the field at ( @xmath24 ) ( j2000 ) = ( 12@xmath2559@xmath2641.@xmath278 , + 27@xmath553@xmath625.@xmath74 ) ( see fig .",
    "3 ) were carried out during the nights of 2004 april 21 - 23 .",
    "we detected a total of 60 emission line objects . among them , 35 are icpne candidates with no continuum flux , 5 are pn candidates projected against the extended halos of coma member galaxies , and 20 are background galaxies .",
    "details of the data reduction and a catalog of icpne candidates are given in @xcite .",
    "figure 4 shows the velocity histograms of icpne ( left ) , coma galaxies in the msis field ( middle ) , and background emission - line galaxies ( right ) .",
    "we detect clear velocity substructures of icpne , i.e. , intracluster stellar population , within a 6 arcmin diameter msis field .",
    "a substructure is present at @xmath28 km s@xmath10 , which is probably from infall of a galaxy group , while the main component is centered around @xmath29 km s@xmath10 , @xmath30 km s@xmath10 offset from the nearby cd galaxy ngc 4874 .",
    "the kinematics of icpne found in this study and morphology of the diffuse intracluster light @xcite show that the cluster core is in a highly dynamically evolving state . in combination with galaxy redshift and x - ray data",
    "this argues strongly that the cluster is currently in the midst of a subcluster merger during which the elongated distribution of diffuse light has been created .",
    "the two subcluster cores ( ngc 4874 and ngc 4889 ) are presently just after their second close passage .",
    "the likely orbits of the subcluster cores are illustrated in fig .",
    "@xcite            inspired by the work by @xcite and @xcite , we started a new very deep imaging program to detect the diffuse intracluster light in a wide @xmath31 field centered on the coma cluster using a ccd camera attached to the 105-cm schmidt telescope at kiso observatory , institute of astronomy , university of tokyo .",
    "we hope to obtain some data in spring , 2008 .",
    "this work is based on the collaboration with magda arnaboldi , ortwin gerhard , ken freeman , naoki yasuda , and nobunari kashikawa , and in part with suprime - cam team .",
