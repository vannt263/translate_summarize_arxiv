    "recent global analyses @xcite of neutrino oscillation parameters , including the data released at the neutrino-2012 conference , find that @xmath22 is non - zero at about @xmath23 , and non - maximal atmospheric mixing angle @xmath7 is preferred .",

    "@xcite obtain a preference for @xmath7 in the first octant for both mass hierarchies and exclude maximal mixing at the @xmath27 level , the best fit value is found to be @xmath28 for normal ( inverted ) neutrino spectrum .",
    "alternative recent global fits claim both the first and second @xmath7 octants are possible @xcite . as for the mass - squared difference ,",
    "the best fit values of @xmath29 and @xmath30 are @xmath31 and @xmath32 respectively , which lead to @xmath33 . here",
    "the values shown in parentheses correspond to the inverted neutrino mass hierarchy .",
    "note that the three groups give almost the same @xmath34 ranges for the lepton mixing parameters .",
    "from the theoretical or model - building point of view , one implication of this significant experimental progress is that it excludes the tri - bimaximal mixing ansatz for neutrino mixing @xcite , unless the underlying theory is capable of providing sufficiently large corrections .",
    "so far many suggestions have been advanced to explain the new data , in particular the largish @xmath22 @xcite . instead of seeking for new mass - independent lepton mixing matrices to replace the tri - bimaximal pattern  @xcite , which may be derived from certain discrete flavor symmetries , ref .",
    "@xcite proposed a novel wolfenstein - like _ ansatz _ for the neutrino mixing matrix . in this scheme , all three lepton",
    "mixing angles are assumed to be of the same order to first approximation @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the cabibbo angle , and the symbol ",
    "@xmath37 \" implies that the above relations contain unknown factors of order one , the freedom in these factors can be used to obtain an adequate description of the neutrino mixing . inspecting the global data fitting @xcite",
    ", we see that @xmath38 and @xmath39 , which is proposed in the so - called tri - bimaximal - cabibbo mixing @xcite and also appeared in the context of quark - lepton complementarity @xcite .",
    "such bilarge mixing pattern  @xcite would clearly provide a good leading order approximation for the current neutrino mixing pattern , if the atmospheric neutrino mixing angle @xmath7 turns out to lie in the first octant .",
    "however , the second octant of @xmath7 can not be ruled out and is supported by the analyses in refs .",
    "@xcite . in this case",
    "the texture @xmath40 could be taken as a viable model - building standard .",
    "we shall refer to two mixing patterns as @xmath1 and @xmath5 textures respectively .",
    "the difference between @xmath1 and @xmath5 mixing lies in the order of magnitude of the atmospheric mixing angle @xmath7 ; the @xmath1 mixing pattern would be favored if future experiments establish that @xmath7 belongs to the first octant and the deviation from maximal mixing is somewhat large ; otherwise , @xmath5 mixing is preferred .",
    "it is well - known that the observed hierarchies of masses and flavor mixing in the quarks and charged leptons sectors can be conveniently characterized by the cabibbo angle . as a result the @xmath1 and @xmath5 parametrization may have deep implications for the theoretical formulation of the ultimate unified theory of flavor .",
    "a lot of work in the literature has demonstrated that the smallness and hierarchy of the quark masses and mixing angles can be naturally generated in theories which , at low energy , are described effectively by an abelian horizontal symmetry , which is explicitly broken by a small parameter @xcite .",
    "it certainly follows a natural path to try and apply these ideas on abelian family symmetries developed for the quarks to the lepton sector . in this work",
    ", we shall investigate whether and how the @xmath41 and @xmath5 textures can be reproduced naturally from the abelian horizontal flavor symmetry .",
    "for generality we assume that the light neutrino masses arise from lepton - number - violating effective weinberg - like operators .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "[ sec : th ] , we present the effective low energy theory for the abelian @xmath42 flavor symmetry and its extension to @xmath9 . we find that , in order to produce the @xmath1 texture without fine - tuning , the family symmetry should be @xmath9 with @xmath10 and @xmath11 of opposite parity .",
    "models for the @xmath1 and @xmath5 schemes are constructed in section [ sec : bl1 ] and section [ sec : bl2 ] respectively .",
    "these models are extended to include quarks within the @xmath14 grand unified theory ( gut ) , the observed patterns of both quark and lepton masses and flavor mixings are reproduced , and the general phenomenological predictions of the models are discussed . finally , our conclusions are summarized in section [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "our theoretical framework is defined as follows .",
    "for definiteness we consider a low energy effective theory with the same particle content as the supersymmetric standard model ( sm ) .",
    "in addition to supersymmetry and the sm gauge symmetry , we introduce a horizontal @xmath42 symmetry and a sm singlet chiral superfield @xmath43 which is charged under the @xmath42 family symmetry ; without loss of generality , we normalize its charge to @xmath44 .",
    "the effective yukawa couplings of the quarks and leptons are generated from nonrenormalizable superpotential terms of the form @xmath45 where @xmath46 are higgs doublets , @xmath47 and @xmath48 are the left - handed quark and lepton doublets respectively , @xmath49 , @xmath50 and @xmath51 are the right - handed up - type quark , down - type quark and charged lepton superfields respectively , and @xmath52 , @xmath53 are generation indices .",
    "the parameter @xmath54 is the cutoff scale of the @xmath42 symmetry , and @xmath55 denotes the @xmath42 charge of the field @xmath56 .",
    "note that @xmath57 and @xmath58 do not appear in the exponents since one can always set the horizontal charges of the higgs doublet @xmath59 and @xmath59 to zero by redefinition of the @xmath42 charges .",
    "the last term of eq.([eq : u(1 ) ] ) is the high - dimensional version of the effective lepton - number - violating weinberg operator .    for the froggatt - nielsen flavon field @xmath43",
    ", the supersymmetric action contains a fayet - iliopoulos term and the associated d - term in the scalar potential provides a large vacuum expectation value ( vev ) for the scalar component of @xmath43 .",
    "the d - term in the potential is given by @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the fayet - iliopoulos term .",
    "the vanishing of @xmath62 requires @xmath63 we note that this flavor symmetry breaking mechanism is also frequently exploited in discrete flavor symmetry model building @xcite .",
    "once the horizontal symmetry is broken by the vev @xmath64 , one obtains the quark and lepton mass matrices whose elements are suppressed by powers of the small parameter @xmath65 , which for simplicity is usually assumed to be characterized by the cabibbo angle , i.e. , @xmath66 , then we have @xmath67 where @xmath68 is the electroweak scale vev of the higgs doublet @xmath46 .",
    "the factors @xmath69 , @xmath70 , @xmath71 and @xmath72 are not constrained by the flavor symmetry and are usually assumed to be of order one , the freedom in these factors is used in order to obtain a quantitative description of the fermion masses and flavor mixings .",
    "since the holomorphicity of the superpotential forbids nonrenormalizable terms with a negative power of the superfield @xmath43 , one has @xmath73 if @xmath74 .",
    "similarly @xmath75 if @xmath76 , @xmath77 if @xmath78 , and @xmath79 if @xmath80 .    in our framework , the light neutrino masses are generated by the high - dimensional effective weinberg operators shown in the last term of eq.([eq : u(1 ) ] ) , consequently , the light neutrinos are majorana particles and its mass matrix @xmath81 is symmetric with @xmath82   to generate light neutrino mass via type i seesaw mechanism , the structure of the light neutrino mass matrix @xmath81 is independent of the @xmath83 charge assignments @xcite , unless there are holomorphic zeros in neutrino dirac mass matrix @xmath84 or in majorana mass matrix @xmath85 for the heavy fields @xmath86 . ]",
    "furthermore , if all the horizontal charges are positive , the hierarchial structure of the mass matrices shown in eq.([eq : mass ] ) allows a simple order of magnitude estimate for the various mass ratios and mixing angles : @xmath87},\\quad\\quad \\frac{m_{\\ell_i}}{m_{\\ell_j}}\\sim\\lambda^{f(l_i)-f(l_j)+f(e^c_i)-f(e^c_j)},\\quad\\quad \\sin\\theta_{ij}\\sim\\lambda^{f(l_i)-f(l_j)}\\,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath88 is the light neutrino mass , and @xmath89 denotes the element of the quark cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa quark - mixing matrix ( ckm ) mixing matrix .",
    "we note that the sign @xmath90 implies that there is an unknown order one coefficient in each relation , so that the actual value of the mass ratios and mixing angles may slightly depart from the naive `` power counting '' estimate . moreover ,",
    "if some fields carry negative @xmath91 charges , then holomorphy plays an important role and the estimates ( [ eq : estimate ] ) could be violated as well . for the @xmath41 mixing pattern , both @xmath92 and @xmath93",
    "are of order @xmath94 , then we should require @xmath95 this implies @xmath96 , as a result , we have @xmath97 .",
    "therefore we conclude that the @xmath1 mixing pattern can not be naturally produced from a pure @xmath42 flavor symmetry .",
    "turning to the @xmath5 mixing pattern given by @xmath98 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 , one should choose @xmath99    10.mm    then we have the @xmath100 and @xmath101 @xmath102 entries of the charged lepton mass matrix are of the same order , hence the diagonalization of the charged lepton mass matrix leads to large 2 - 3 mixing .",
    "in addition , we obtain @xmath103[mnuiii ] clearly the ( 2 - 3 ) sector of the light neutrino mass matrix has a democratic structure , thus large mixing in this ( 2 - 3 ) sector is naturally obtained . however , barring the presence of special cancellations , the masses of the second and the third light neutrinos are typically expected to be of the same order in this case . as a result ,",
    "the three light neutrinos are quasi - degenerate and strong parameter fine - tuning is required in order to account for the hierarchy between the measured mass squared differences @xmath104 and @xmath105 .",
    "10.mm    in order to avoid this kind of fine - tuning in obtaining an acceptable pattern of neutrino oscillation parameters , we must go beyond the pure @xmath42 flavor symmetry case considered above .",
    "let us now move to the extended flavor symmetry @xmath106 . this kind of abelian symmetry is somewhat complex and not yet fully discussed , as far as we know , since most of the previous work concentrated on @xmath42 or @xmath107 flavor symmetry .",
    "we now consider  @xcite three sm singlet superfields @xmath108 , @xmath109 and @xmath110 with the horizontal charges @xmath111 in exactly the same way as the single @xmath42 case , the three flavons @xmath108 , @xmath109 and @xmath110 could get non - vanishing vevs determined by corresponding the d - terms . in general the vevs @xmath112 , @xmath113 and @xmath114 are different @xcite . for simplicity , we take in what follows : @xmath115 , @xmath116 and @xmath117 .",

    "10.mm    furthermore , when the flavor symmetry is reduced to @xmath8 by taking @xmath145 , all the above results remain valid .",
    "it is remarkable that we can employ the @xmath8 flavor symmetry to maintain the @xmath5 mixing while achieving very different neutrino masses without fine - tuning .",
    "we shall restrict our attention to the case of a @xmath146 symmetry which is the minimal nontrivial @xmath122 group ( see , for example , the explicit model construction given in sec .",
    "[ sec : bl2 ] below ) . in this case",
    "just the @xmath122 symmetry can reproduce a hierarchy in neutrino masses of order @xmath147 consistent with the observed ratio of solar - to - atmospheric splittings .",
    "in contrast , note that since the reactor neutrino mixing is necessarily of order @xmath148 the @xmath8 flavor symmetry can not produce the @xmath41 mixing pattern . indeed for such @xmath1 texture one has @xmath2 and @xmath4 , which is in conflict with the required linear behavior of the reactor mixing angle @xmath3 .",
    "note parenthetically that the @xmath149 group consists of only the identity element , so the group @xmath150 is isomorphic to @xmath42 , and the @xmath149 charge of field is 0 , hence the flavor symmetry @xmath150 produces a wrong scaling behavior @xmath97 .",
    "we now turn to the realistic case of the @xmath9 flavor symmetry .",
    "if both solar and atmospheric neutrino mixing angles are of order @xmath94 then the reactor angle would be constrained to be of order @xmath151 . as a result",
    ", one can have @xmath3 if the parity of @xmath10 and @xmath11 is opposite .",
    "this is an interesting observation of the present work . in section [ sec : bl1 ] , a concrete model for the @xmath1 mixing pattern is presented based on the flavor symmetry @xmath12 .",
    "since an abelian flavor symmetry can not predict the exact value of the @xmath152 coefficients in front of each invariant operator , we must content ourselves with explaining the orders of magnitude of fermion masses and flavor mixing parameters . to identify the phenomenologically acceptable mass matrices",
    ", we will estimate the various mass ratios and mixing angles as approximate powers of the small parameter @xmath94 .",
    "the hierarchies in the quark mixing angles are clearly displayed in wolfenstein s truncated form  @xcite of the parametrization of the ckm matrix  @xcite : @xmath153 where the quantities @xmath154 , @xmath155 and @xmath156 are experimentally determined to be of order one .",
    "therefore the order of magnitude of the three mixing angles is given in terms of the @xmath94 as @xmath157 the charged fermion mass ratios at the grand unified theory ( gut ) scale should satisfy  @xcite @xmath158 as well as @xmath159 for the intrafamily hierarchy .",
    "the first identity is the well - known @xmath160 unification relation . for the neutrinos",
    ", we required that the lepton mixing is of @xmath1 or @xmath5 type depending on the octant of @xmath7 .",
    "for the quark sector , all the explicit models are properly constructed to meet the requirement @xmath161 and @xmath162",
    "as has been shown in the previous section , one can reproduce the @xmath1 texture within the framework of @xmath163 family symmetry , where @xmath10 and @xmath11 should have different parity . for concreteness , we shall use @xmath164 and @xmath165 for our model . for such symmetry choice the possible model realization of the @xmath1 texture is not unique . as a concrete example , here",
    "the horizontal charges of the lepton fields are taken to be @xmath166 one immediately obtains the charged lepton mass matrix @xmath167 which yields the mass ratios @xmath168 that are consistent with the experimental requirements . for the charged assignments in eq.([eq : ass1 ] ) , the light neutrino mass matrix is given by @xmath169 it predicts the light neutrino mass eigenvalues as follows : @xmath170 the neutrino mass spectrum is normal hierarchy , this is confirmed by subsequent numerical analysis .",
    "it is remarkable that this model gives rise to @xmath171 and @xmath172 , which is in excellent agreement with the experimental data . in conventional @xmath42 or @xmath8 flavor symmetries ,",
    "if any ratio between neutrino masses is an odd power of the small breaking parameter , generally the mixing angle between the two neutrinos will vanish @xcite .",
    "the crucial point is that the element @xmath173 , which would have been @xmath174 under the continuous @xmath143 symmetry , is enhanced to @xmath175 due to the discrete symmetry @xmath176 . diagonalizing the mass matrices in eq.([eq : cmm ] ) and eq.([eq : nmm ] ) by the standard perturbative techniques described in refs .",
    "@xcite , we get the three lepton flavor mixing angles @xmath177 hence the @xmath1 pattern is produced automatically .",
    "note that the solar neutrino mixing @xmath92 arises from order @xmath94 contributions from the diagonalization of both @xmath178 and @xmath81 , while at leading order the reactor and the atmospheric neutrino mixing angles receive contribution only from the neutrino mass matrix @xmath81 .",
    "the off - diagonal elements @xmath179 and @xmath180 are enhanced by @xmath181 and @xmath182 respectively , hence we have @xmath3 and @xmath4 instead of the naive expectations @xmath183 and @xmath184 characteristic of the continuous flavor symmetry case .    in the following , we shall extend the model to encompass also quark sector . since gut relates quarks and leptons , the transformation properties of quark fields can be determined from those of leptons . in order to give a successful description of the observed fermion mass hierarchies and mixings simultaneously under the same flavor symmetry acting on quarks and leptons we work in the framework of @xmath14 , for definiteness .",
    "another motivation of considering @xmath14 unification is the anomaly cancellation .",
    "if the @xmath42 flavor symmetry is gauged then a general assignment of flavor charges to the fields will be anomalous .",
    "one can imagine the anomaly to be canceled via the green - schwarz mechanism  @xcite , however , one must check whether the correct relations are satisfied  @xcite . a convenient way to ensure that the flavor charges are amenable",
    "to cancellation is to have the flavor symmetry to commute with the @xmath14 group  @xcite .",
    "here we propose a model with the quark and lepton matter assignments manifestly compatible with potential unification within @xmath14 .",
    "a complete study of a realistic grand unified model model addressing the well - known problems such as the doublet - triplet splitting , the proton lifetime and gauge coupling unification , is beyond the scope of the present paper and will be studied elsewhere .    in the conventional @xmath14 grand unified theory , the fields @xmath185 and @xmath48 of the same generation",
    "are assigned to a @xmath186 multiplet , the fields @xmath47 , @xmath187 and @xmath188 are unified in the @xmath189 representation .",
    "since the flavor symmetry is required to commute with the gauge symmetry , this means that the fields in each gauge multiplet transform in the same way under the flavor symmetry .",
    "consequently , the quantum numbers of the quark fields under the flavor symmetry @xmath12 are as follows : @xmath190 we note that although there are many possible assignments to produce the @xmath1 texture in the neutrino sector , only a few of them can satisfy the quark sector phenomenological constraints within @xmath14 .",
    "it is well - known that the minimal @xmath14 grand unified theory predicts that the down - type quark mass matrix is the transpose of the charged lepton mass matrix , therefore the down - type quarks and charged lepton masses are closely related : @xmath191 , @xmath192 and @xmath193 , which are in gross disagreement with the measured fermion masses and must be corrected @xcite .",

    "the modulus of the undetermined order one coefficients are taken to be random numbers with flat , gaussian and exponential distributions in turn , the corresponding phases are varied between 0 and @xmath219 . the probability density function @xmath220 of the three distributions is well known @xmath221 for flat distribution , we take @xmath222 and @xmath223 for illustration in the present work . in the case of gaussian distribution , @xmath224 we set the mean @xmath225 and the standard deviation @xmath226 in our numerical calculation .",
    "the probability density function for the exponential distribution is @xmath227 its statistic mean is @xmath228 , and @xmath94 is taken to be 1 as a typical value for numerical simulation . to the extent that our results are independent of the choice of seeding method , they are robust and not simply an artifact of the choice of the seed function .",
    "the coefficients @xmath212 , @xmath213 , @xmath214 and @xmath72 are treated as random complex numbers with arbitrary phases and absolute value in the interval of @xmath229 $ ] .",
    "then we calculate the quark and lepton masses as well as the ckm and lepton mixing matrix entries which are required to lie in the experimentally allowed ranges .",
    "the numerical results are found to be nicely consistent with the above theoretical estimates and qualitative discussions .",
    "since the flavor parameters of the quark sector are precisely measured , here we focus on the neutrino sector . as an example the predicted distributions for the light neutrino masses and atmospheric mixing parameter are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : mixing_parameter_bl1 ] .",
    "the light neutrino masses follow the normal hierarchy pattern and , for all the points produced , though all non - vanishing , they are rather tiny , with most of the expected @xmath230 values below @xmath231 . as to the mixing angles , no specific values of @xmath232 and @xmath22 are favored within @xmath34 , and hence they are not shown in the figure  , @xmath233 and @xmath234 , hence , as before , these are not shown . ] .",
    "in contrast , however , the atmospheric neutrino mixing angle @xmath7 obeys @xmath235 , which means that non - maximal @xmath7 values are preferred , as indicated by current neutrino oscillation global analyses post - neutrino 2012  @xcite , with a preference for the first octant .",
    "this has been one of our motivations for introducing @xmath1 mixing pattern , which leads to @xmath93 of order @xmath94 at leading order .    [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "the recent neutrino oscillation experimental highlights : ( i ) rather large value of reactor mixing angle @xmath22 and ( ii ) indication of significant deviation of the atmospheric neutrino mixing angle @xmath7 from maximality may change our theoretical approach for constructing neutrino mass models . in this paper",
    ", we study the wolfenstein - like mixing schemes : @xmath1 mixing in which @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 , and @xmath5 mixing , in which @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath236 .",
    "the largish @xmath22 can be naturally accommodated in both of them , the two mixing patterns differ in the order of magnitude of @xmath93 , the @xmath1 texture is favored for @xmath7 in the first octant , while @xmath5 is preferred for the second octant @xmath7 . in order to produce the @xmath1 mixing without invoking unnatural cancellation",
    ", the abelian flavor symmetry should be @xmath9 with the parity of @xmath10 and @xmath11 being opposite .",
    "a concrete model based on @xmath12 family symmetry is constructed , where the light neutrino mass hierarchy @xmath171 is realized due to the discrete nature of @xmath176 .",
    "the ratio @xmath237 is expected to be of order @xmath147 in this model , which is in good agreement with experimental data in contrast with conventional @xmath42 or @xmath238 flavor symmetry constructions . furthermore , the model is embedded into the @xmath14 grand unified theory to describe the quark masses and mixing simultaneously . as for the @xmath5 mixing , it can be reproduced within the framework of pure @xmath42 flavor symmetry .",
    "however , the light neutrino mass spectrum is expected to be quasi - degenerate , hence fine - tuning of the neutrino mass parameters is needed in order to achieve the observed mass - squared differences . to improve upon this situation ,",
    "the family symmetry is enlarged to @xmath13 , which gives rise to both large atmospheric neutrino mixing @xmath98 and hierarchical neutrino masses .",
    "the model is extended to @xmath14 grand unified theory as well .",
    "we show that both models can give a successful description of the observed quark and lepton masses and mixing angles , and the numerical results are nicely in agreement with the theoretical estimates and the qualitative discussions .",
    "the light neutrinos are normal mass hierarchy in both models , quasi - degenerate spectrum is strongly disfavored .",
    "if the next generation high precision neutrino oscillation experiments determine that the neutrino mass spectrum is inverted hierarchy , both our constructions will be ruled out .",
    "the present framework can not predict the cp violating phases @xmath239 , @xmath233 and @xmath234 .",
    "the @xmath240-decay effective mass @xmath241 is predicted to be rather small in both constructions , substantial part of the data are below the sensitivity of future experiments except for a region of the @xmath5 model indicated in fig .",
    "[ fig : onu2b_bl2 ] .",
    "therefore future @xmath240-decay experiments such as cuore , majorana and gerda iii will provide another important test of the present models .",
