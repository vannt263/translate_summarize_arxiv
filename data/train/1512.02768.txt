    "dust plays an important role in formation and chemical evolution of galaxies .",
    "dust absorbs and scatters the ultraviolet ( uv ) light associated with star formation activities , and approximately re - emits half of the star light in infrared ( ir ) ( e.g. @xcite ) . the infrared dust emission from individual galaxies",
    ", however , is very difficult to detect in ir generally , except for bright sources .",
    "this is why image stacking analysis is very useful in measuring and characterizing the ir emission from typical galaxies in a statistical fashion .",
    "recently , for instance , @xcite ( hereafter kys13 ) performed the stacking analysis of sdss @xcite photometric galaxies over the galactic extinction map by schlegel , finkbeiner , and davis ( @xcite , hereafter sfd ) .",
    "the sfd extinction map is constructed basically from iras / issa fir emission map at 100@xmath5 with dust temperature correction using the cobe data .",
    "kys13 were originally motivated to explain the anomaly of the sfd extinction map @xcite in terms of the fir emission contamination from galaxies . indeed they are successful in detecting the additional extinction statistically over the sfd map that should be ascribed to sdss galaxies .",
    "any further quantitative interpretation of the result , however , is limited by the poor angular resolution ( fwhm @xmath6 ) of the iras 100@xmath5 map .    in this paper , we perform the similar stacking analysis using the far - infrared surveyor ( fis ; @xcite , @xcite ) onboard the japanese infrared satellite akari @xcite .",
    "fis covers almost @xmath7 of the whole sky with spatial resolution of @xmath8 , approximately four times better than that of iras .",
    "also fis maps at 65 , 90 , 140 and 160@xmath5 are useful in estimating the corresponding dust temperature in a statistical fashion .",
    "indeed the longer wavelength bands correspond to the peak of dust far - infrared emission from sdss photometric galaxies as described below .",
    "the present paper is organized as follows .",
    "section 2 briefly summarizes the akari fis all - sky map and sdss dr7 photometric galaxy catalog that we use throughout the current analysis .",
    "section 3 describes the point spread functions ( psfs ) of fis , and also presents the method of the stacking .",
    "the stacked images at 90@xmath5 are fitted to the model profiles in section 4 , compared with the prediction on the basis of the angular - correlation function of sdss galaxies in section 5 .",
    "we repeat the similar stacking analysis at 65 and 140@xmath5 , and derive the dust temperature of sdss galaxies in section 6 . finally  7 is devoted to summary and conclusion of the paper .",
    "our stacking analysis utilizes the two datasets , akari fis @xcite and sdss dr7 data @xcite , which we describe briefly below .",
    "fis is an instrument on board the akari satellite @xcite .",
    "it has 4 photometric bands at 65 @xmath5 , 90 @xmath5 , 140 @xmath5 and 160 @xmath5 , and covers almost all the sky .",
    "figure [ fig : sdssregion ] shows the 90@xmath5 image of fis map in the ecliptic coordinates .",
    "the absolute calibration of fis map is based on the comparison with the cobe / dirbe data @xcite . while other component and point sources are not removed , smooth cloud components of the zodiacal emission are subtracted from the map following @xcite . indeed , a faint signature of the residual zodiacal light is visible around the equator in figure [ fig : sdssregion ] .",
    "the point - source detection levels of the survey mode at a signal - to - noise ratio of 5@xmath9 are 2.4jy , 0.55jy , and 1.4jy at 65 @xmath5 , 90 @xmath5 and 140 @xmath5 , respectively @xcite .",
    "@xcite directly measure the point spread functions ( psfs ) of fis by stacking infrared standard stars of @xcite .",
    "their catalogue includes 422 giant stars with spectral types of k0 to m0 , and @xcite stack 80@xmath10 of those stars .",
    "table [ table : arimatsu ] summarizes the values of the psfs of fis and the 5@xmath9 detection limits in each wavelength .",
    "the psfs of fis are elongated along the direction of scanning because of the slow response of fis detector .",
    "this is why we show three different values for the fwhm in table [ table : arimatsu ] ; along the scan direction ( in - scan ) , perpendicular to the scan direction ( cross - scan ) , and their circular average .",

    "in the last section , we estimate @xmath96 from the best - fit to the observed profiles of the stacking images .",
    "it is interesting to compare the resulting value to the prediction from equation ( [ eq : sigmac0 ] ) , @xmath97 .",
    "indeed kys13 carried out the comparison and suggested that the fir fluxes for the clustering term obtained from the iras stacking analysis exceed those predicted from the angular - correlation of the sdss galaxies by a factor of a few .",
    "kys13 speculate that this deficit may point to the existence of unknown fir objects other than sdss galaxies .",
    "since this has very important implications , we repeat the same analysis but with the values estimated from akari .",
    "as indicated in figure [ fig : iras - akari ] , the amplitudes of the clustering term derived from the current akari analysis are systematically smaller than those from iras .",
    "thus the deficit discovered by kys13 needs to be examined carefully again .    for this purpose , we first note that equation ( [ eq : sigmac0 ] ) is written down more explicitly as @xmath98 since both kys13 and our work use sdss galaxies with @xmath99-@xmath100 in the image stacking , we can reliably compute the integral in equation ( [ eq : sigmac0-infty ] ) only for @xmath101 : @xmath102 in figure [ fig : sigmac0-rmag ] , we plot the above result for @xmath45 as a black solid line , which should be compared with @xmath103 ( filled circles with error - bars ) .",

    "therefore the conclusion of kys13 that the sdss galaxies explain less than half of the observed fir amplitude for the clustering term is most likely due to the magnitude limit of the sdss galaxies themselves . indeed",

    "another important advantage of akari fis is its multi - band coverage . from the spectrum of the stacked fir emission in different wavelengths",
    ", we can infer the mean dust temperature of sdss galaxies .",
    "@xcite proposed a method to constrain the dust extent through the measurement of dust temperature .",
    "they obtain constraints on the dust temperature by combining the far - infrared emission computed from the stacked images of the iras map with the quasar reddening measurement by @xcite .",
    "the mean spectrum energy distribution of stacked sdss galaxies is a more direct probe of the dust temperature and independent of the method proposed by @xcite .",
    "we repeat the same stacking analysis over akari fis maps at 65 and 140@xmath5 in addition to at 90@xmath5 as described in the previous sections .",
    "in particular , 140@xmath5 band is suited for the determination of the dust temperature because it is closer to the expected peak of the dust emission .",
    "the best - fits of the amplitudes of the single term , @xmath156 , at the different bands are translated to the fluxes @xmath157 , and then fitted to the following grey - body spectrum : @xmath158^{-1 } .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we adopt the dust emissivity of @xmath159 for definiteness .",
    "figure [ fig : sed ] plots the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of galaxies with @xmath99-@xmath160 , @xmath161-@xmath162 , @xmath163-@xmath164 , and @xmath165-@xmath100 in filled circles .",
    "the solid lines are their best - fits to equation ( [ eq : sed ] ) , and fits are quite acceptable .",
    "the corresponding temperatures are @xmath166k for @xmath99-@xmath160 , and @xmath167k for @xmath161-@xmath162 to @xmath165-@xmath100 .",
    "it is also encouraging that the resulting temperature is almost independent of the magnitude as it should be .    since the sdss photometric galaxies are distributed over the range of redshifts , @xmath168 is not identical to the mean of the dust temperature of the sdss galaxies at different redshifts .",
    "if we assume all the sdss galaxies are at their median redshift @xmath169 , the mean dust temperature at @xmath169 is simply given by @xmath170 .",
    "this is not an accurate but reasonably good estimate for the redshift effect .",
    "if we adopt @xmath171 @xcite , the dust temperature from our stacking analysis is close to 40k .",
    "note that we measured the dust temperature statistically , while the dust temperature of individually identified , thus ir luminous , galaxies are estimated with the herschel space observatory ( hso ) @xcite .",
    "our value is marginally consistent with 20 - 40k ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) which are estimated with the hso .",
    "finally black open circles in figure [ fig : sed ] are the fluxes measured by kys13 for iras . as mentioned in  4 ,",
    "the iras fluxes agree well with our akari result , while they are systematically underestimated for @xmath83 .",
    "the consistent feature is clearly exhibited in figure [ fig : sed ] .",
    "in this paper , we present the image stacking analysis of the sdss photometric galaxies over the akari far - infrared surveyor maps at 65 , 90 , and 140@xmath5 .",
    "this enables us to identify the mean fir counterparts of the sdss galaxies down to the @xmath1-band magnitude of @xmath172 in a statistical fashion , corresponding to 3mjy at 90@xmath5 .",
    "a typical fir flux of individually identified galaxies is about 10mjy .",
    "therefore the image stacking analysis is useful in exploring the nature of typical galaxies in fir that is not easily accessible otherwise .",
    "our present result improves the previous analysis using iras at 100 @xmath5 by @xcite mainly thanks to a factor of 6 better angular resolution of akari ( fwhm= at 90@xmath5 ) relative to iras ( fwhm= at @xmath76 ) .",
    "we decompose the stacked image profiles of galaxies with different @xmath2 into the single term and the clustering term .",
    "the single term represents the flux from the central galaxy , while the clustering term is a sum of contribution from near - by galaxies through their angular clustering .",
    "because typical sizes of sdss galaxies are much smaller than that of akari fis psf , the single term follows the psf that is well approximated by the double gaussians .",
    "the clustering term can be written in terms of the angular - correlation function that is directly measured from the sdss galaxies in optical .",
    "thus the fir amplitude of the clustering term fitted from the stacked image profile can be compared with that predicted from the sdss data .",
    "this could be used in turn so as to explore the existence of the possible unknown class of optically faint and fir luminous objects that are not traced by optical galaxies .",
    "indeed @xcite suggested that the fir fluxes inferred from iras data are not fully explained by the sdss galaxies alone .",
    "our present analysis , however , revealed that the extrapolation of the angular - correlation function of sdss galaxies is sufficient to account for the detected fir fluxes .",
    "in other words , the discrepancy does not require any additional class of objects , but can be explained by galaxies outside the sdss magnitude range .",
    "this result may be interpreted as an example that the image stacking analysis can put useful constraints on the angular clustering of galaxies that are not easily probed otherwise .",
    "we also combined the stacking analysis at 65@xmath5 , 90@xmath5 , and 140@xmath5 , and found that the mean dust temperature of the sdss galaxies at @xmath24 is @xmath173k .",
    "this value is slightly higher than the typical dust temperature of galaxies that are fir luminous and individually detected .",
    "our image stacking can be improved and applied for other purposes .",
    "first , the morphological dependence of the fir emission of galaxies needs to be studied as mentioned in  [ sec : sigmac0model ] .",
    "second , the analysis based on spectroscopic , rather than photometric , samples of galaxies is important in separating the redshift evolution and intrinsic luminosity dependence .",
    "third , the current method can be applied to search for the intracluster dust that is not directly associated with individual galaxies , in a complementary fashion to @xcite and @xcite . finally , it is interesting to perform the image stacking of quasars , as has been tentatively attempted by kys13 .",
    "we are currently working on those studies , and plan to present the result elsewhere .",

    "in  [ sec : results ] , we subtracted the foreground emission due to the galactic dust , from the raw stacked images using the empirically constructed templates for the foregrounds .",
    "although this method is successful in removing the foreground contribution fairly nicely , we carefully consider the extent to which the resulting best - fit parameters characterizing the fir emission of galaxies , @xmath55 and @xmath57 , are affected by this procedure .    for that purpose , we repeated the stacking analysis of the sdss galaxies as presented in  [ sec : stack ] , but without subtracting any foreground contribution .",
    "we model the resulting radial profiles of galaxies as @xmath174 where @xmath175 indicates the offset level due to the foreground emission . here",
    "we treat @xmath175 as a free parameter separately for each magnitude bin .",
    "we find that except that the statistical uncertainties become slightly smaller , the best - fit values of @xmath54 and @xmath57 , are almost identical to from those derived without subtracting the foreground templates .",
    "thus , the parameters characterizing the fir emission of galaxies are very insensitive to how we subtract the foreground emission .",
    "on the other hand , the best - fit parameter of @xmath175 systematically decreases against @xmath2 , as shown in figure [ fig : c ] , while the offset level due to the foreground emission is naively expected to be independent of @xmath2 .",
    "the similar trend was also found by kys13 , using the iras data .",
    "kys13 suggested that the unexpected correlation is due to the spatial inhomogeneities of the local universe , in particular , the cfa great wall ( hereafter , cgw ) .",
    "they argued that the cgw is coincidentally located where the iras 100@xmath5 emission is relatively high .",
    "since the nearby structure such as the cgw would consists of bright galaxies , the stacking results for the bright magnitude sample could return relatively large values of the galactic foreground emission .    after the publication of kys13 , however , the authors found that this explanation is not likely to be correct , due to the over - interpretation of the results of the corresponding analysis ; these results are rather subtle and should have been interpreted more carefully , especially since those statistical significances are limited by the number of the galaxies used in these analysis , which is much reduced by avoiding the cgw .    indeed , the best - fit values of @xmath175 for the akari results indicate the strong correlation with @xmath2 , much beyond the quoted error - bars computed from the jackknife resampling . given that the jackknife resampling method takes into account the sample variance over the survey area , the correlation should be interpreted to be present over the entire sky area , and would not be restricted to the specific region of the sky area , such as the cgw .",
    "thus , the origin of the anomalous correlation needs to be further investigated in detail .",
    "we emphasize , however , that our results for the fir emission of galaxies would not be affected by the value of those offset levels , as far as our assumption that the fir emission of galaxies basically traces the spatial distribution of the optical galaxies ."
