    "it is widely believed that the structure formation in our universe is largely driven by the gravity of dark matter .",
    "therefore it is worthwhile to probe dark matter dynamics through measurements of galaxy peculiar velocities and constrain our cosmological model by comparing against numerical simulations .",
    "in fact there has been extensive work along these lines , recovering the local density field from the measured velocity field @xcite .",
    "unfortunately the observations of peculiar velocity fields contain large uncertainties , and accurate determination of the cosmological mass density parameter @xmath16 turned out to be difficult using this method .",
    "more recently , clusters of galaxies have been used to prove the existence of dark matter itself , thanks to accurate measurements of projected dark matter density using weak and strong lensing techniques .",
    "some clusters show signs of a cluster - cluster merger , where the baryonic component and collisionless dark matter show different spatial distributions , strongly supporting the existence of dark matter .",
    "furthermore , using the shock features seen in the gas , one can infer the collision velocity of two galaxy clusters @xcite .",
    "these new observations have brought renewed interest to dark matter dynamics and using it to check the standard @xmath15 cold dark matter ( @xmath15cdm ) cosmological model @xcite .",
    "in particular , the observations of the massive cluster of galaxies 1e0657 - 56 seem to suggest a much higher relative dark matter halo velocity than one would expect in the @xmath0cdm model .",
    "this system includes a massive sub - cluster ( the `` bullet '' ) with @xmath17 that has fallen through the parent cluster of @xmath18 roughly @xmath19 million years ago , and is separated by @xmath20mpc on the sky at an observed redshift of @xmath4=0.296 @xcite .",
    "the uniqueness of this system comes from the collision trajectory being almost perpendicular to our line of sight .",
    "this provides an opportunity to better study the dynamics of large cluster collisions .",
    "the chandra observations revealed that the primary baryonic component had been stripped away in the collision and resided between the two clusters in the form of hot x - ray emitting gas @xcite .",
    "this provides strong evidence for the existence of dark matter ( dm ) ; as the two clusters passed through each other , the baryonic components interacted and slowed down due to ram pressure , while the dark matter component was allowed to move ahead of the gas since it only interacts through gravity without dissipation .",
    "one can infer the velocity of the bow shock preceding the ` bullet ' using the shock mach number and a measurement of the pre - shock temperature . the inferred shock velocity was found to be @xmath21kms@xmath12 @xcite .",
    "@xcite examined the millennium run @xcite in search for such a sub - cluster moving with a velocity relative to its parent cluster of @xmath22 km s@xmath12 @xcite . due to the limited volume of the simulation ( 500 @xmath7mpc)@xmath8",
    ", few halos had masses comparable to 1e0657 - 56 .",
    "still they estimated that about 1 in 100 have velocities comparable to the bullet cluster , and concluded that the event is not impossible within the current @xmath0cdm model .",
    "it is often assumed that the inferred shock velocity is equal to the velocity of the dark matter ` bullet ' itself .",
    "several groups have shown , however , that this is not necessarily true through the use of non - cosmological hydrodynamic simulations .",
    "@xcite used two dimensional simulations to find that the subcluster s velocity differed from the shock velocity by about 16% , bringing the relative velocity of dm halos down to @xmath53980kms@xmath12 .",
    "they assumed a zero relative velocity at a separation distance of 4.6mpc for their initial conditions .",
    "they also emphasized that their conclusion is sensitive to the initial mass and gas density profile of the two clusters .",
    "@xcite was able to reproduce the inferred shock velocity through the use of an idealized three dimensional hydrodynamic simulation with initial conditions that assumed a relative velocity of 2057kms@xmath12 at a separation distance of 3.37mpc , and found that the subcluster was moving with a relative speed of only @xmath52600kms@xmath12 just after the collision .",
    "@xcite argued that @xcite failed to reproduce the observed displacement of x - ray peaks that represent an important indicator of the nature of the interaction . in their simulations they found that in order to reproduce the observational data of 1e0657 - 56 a relative halo infall velocity of @xmath53000kms@xmath12 at an initial separation distance of 5mpc was required .",
    "similar to previous work by @xcite , @xcite quantified the likelihood of finding bullet - like systems in the large cosmological n - body simulation mice @xcite .",
    "they examined dm halos at @xmath4=0.0 & 0.5 , searching for a halo pair matching the initial conditions of @xcite .",
    "they concluded that @xmath0cdm is excluded by more than 99.91% confidence level at @xmath4=0 .",
    "their results at @xmath4=0.5 are inconclusive due to limited statistics . however , by fitting their pairwise velocity probability distribution function to a gaussian distribution , they were able to estimate the probability of finding a pair with @xmath23 km s@xmath12 to be @xmath24 and @xmath25 km s@xmath12 to be @xmath26 at @xmath4=0.5",
    ". they did warn that one must be careful about this approach since they are probing the tail of the distribution where their fits may not be accurate .",
    "most recently @xcite approached the problem from a different perspective .",
    "they studied data from the marenostrum universe @xcite which contains baryonic matter in addition to collisionless dm .",
    "instead of examining the pairwise velocities of dm halo pairs , they concerned themselves with the physical separation between the dominant gas clump and its predominant dm structure .",
    "they argued that their approach provides a more robust comparison to observation ; deriving the relative velocity from the observations includes statistical and systematic uncertainties whereas the separation uncertainty is dominated by statistical errors in the measuring process .",
    "additionally they point out that current simulations do not include the proper prescriptions for cooling , star formation , or feedback which implies that their predictions of the detailed x - ray properties of hot gas in massive halos are not robust .",
    "using their method they found that large displacements between gas & dm are common in @xmath0cdm simulations therefore , 1e0657 - 56 should not be considered a challenge .",
    "in this paper , we take a similar approach to that of @xcite , and examine large @xmath0cdm @xmath1-body simulations to see how common these high relative velocities are among massive dm halos .",
    "one of the things that the earlier works have not performed is an examination of resolution and box size effect .",
    "therefore we first conduct a study to determine the effects of increasing resolution or varying box sizes on the parameters of interest .",
    "we then examine our largest simulation in search for a pair matching the initial conditions required by @xcite to reproduce the observed properties of 1e0657 - 56 .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows : section[sec : simulation ] discusses simulation parameters , section[sec : analysis ] shows the simulation results and examines the distribution of parameters relevant to this study , such as halo masses , pairwise velocity , and pair separation distances .",
    "section[sec : earlyz ] examines the simulation results at earlier redshifts of @xmath4=0.296 & @xmath4=0.489 , and how they relate to the bullet system .",
    "finally , section[sec : discussion ] contains concluding remarks and discussion of future prospects .",
    "for our simulations we use the gadget-3 code ( originally described in * ? ? ? * ) which simulates large @xmath1-body problems by means of calculating gravitational interactions with a hierarchical multipole expansion .",
    "it uses a particle - mesh method @xcite for long - range forces and a tree method @xcite for short - range forces .",
    "cosmological parameters consistent with the cosmological constraints from the wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( wmap ) data and an @xcite transfer function were employed when creating the initial conditions for each simulation with random gaussian phases : ( @xmath16 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30)@xmath31(0.26 , 0.74 , 72 , 0.8 , 1.0 ) @xcite .",
    "we note that we used a value of @xmath32=1.0 although the best - fit value from the wmap data is @xmath32=0.96 .",
    "two additional simulations were ran with @xmath32=0.96 and no differences in their high mass halo pairs were found from the @xmath32=1 simulations , because the tilt in the primordial power spectrum mostly changes the small scale structures .",
