    "in this note we consider three reactions @xmath0 + h + [ lrg ] + p \\,\\ , ; \\label{r1}\\\\ p + p & \\longrightarrow   & x_1 + [ lrg ] + h + [ lrg ] + x_2 \\,\\ , ; \\label{r2}\\\\ p + p & \\longrightarrow & b + \\bar b + x + [ lrg ] + p \\,\\,;\\label{r3}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where lrg denotes the large rapidity gap between produced particles and @xmath1 corresponds to a system of hadrons with masses much smaller than the total energy .",
    "the first two reactions are so called double pomeron production of higgs meson while the third is the single diffraction production of bottom - antibottom pair .    the goals of this note are the following :    1 .   to give the highest from reasonable estimates for the cross sections of reactions and ; 2 .   to summarize all uncertainties which we see in doing these estimates ; 3 .   to show that there is a new mechanism of diffractive heavy quark production ( ) which is suppressed in dis and dominates in hadron - hadron collision at the tevatron ; 4 .   to estimate the value of the cross section of reaction due to this new mechanism and to show that all attempts to compare the diffraction dissociation in hadron - hadron collisions and dis@xcite look unreliable without a detail experimental study of this process at fermilab .",
    "inclusive higgs production has been studied in many details @xcite for the tevatron energies .",
    "the main source for higgs is gluon - gluon fusion which gives @xmath2 for higgs with mass @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "the reference point for our estimates is the cross section of higgs production due to w and z fusion which is equal to @xmath4 @xcite . in this process",
    "we also expect the two lrg @xcite and in some sense this is a competing process for reactions of and .",
    "let us estimate the simplest digram for the dp higgs production , namely , fig.1 without any of s - channel gluons .",
    "this diagram leads tpo the amplitude [ m1 ] m ( q q q h q ) = @xmath5 for reaction of , @xmath6 and therefore , [ m2 ] m ( q + q q + h + q ) .",
    "has an infrared divergency that is regularized by the size of the colliding hadrons . in other words",
    ", one can see that the simplest diagrams shows that dp higgs production is a typical  soft \" process",
    ".      in fig.1 one can see that we have two sets of gluon which play a different role .",
    "the first one is the gluons that connect @xmath7-channel lines .",
    "their contribution increases the value of cross section @xcite [ g1 ] |_y = 0 = @xmath8 can be rewritten in the form [ g2 ] |_y = 0 = @xmath9 which is convenient for numeric estimates .",
    "however , first we need to find the value of @xmath10 . in inclusive production",
    "the value of @xmath11 has been calculated @xcite [ hx ] g^2_h= g_f ^2_s(m^2_h ) n^2/9 ^2 .",
    "however , i think that the scale of @xmath12 for our process is not the mass of higgs but the  soft \" scale ( @xmath13 with @xmath14 ) . indeed ,",
    "using blm procedure @xcite we can include the bubbles with large number of light quarks only in @xmath7-channel gluon line which carry the `` soft '' transverse momenta .",
    "this gives a sizable effect in numbers , since @xmath15 for @xmath16 is equal to 1.16 pb ( @xmath17 ) and to 20 pb ( @xmath18 ) .",
    "taking the last value we have [ n1 ]    to gluon emission suppressed the value of the cross section .",
    "actually , we have to multiply the cross section of by two factors to obtain the estimate for the experimental cross section [ sp1 ] d ( pp pp h)d y|_y = 0 @xmath19 the first factor is the probability that there is no inelastic interaction of the spectators in our process .",
    "i the situation with calculation of this factor has been reported in this workshop @xcite and the conclusion is that this factor @xmath20 at the tevatron energies . the discussion for double pomeron processes you can find in ref .",
    "@xcite    the second factor in describe the probability that there is no parasite emission in fig.1 which leads to a process with hadrons in central rapidity region which do not come from the higgs decay .",
    "the generic formula for @xmath21 is [ sp2 ] s^2_spect = e^- < n_g(y = ln(m^2_h / s_0 ) > where @xmath22 is the mean number of gluon in interval @xmath23 . in pqcd",
    "this number is large @xcite @xmath24 which leads to very small cross section for higgs production . for `` soft '' double pomeron production we can estimate the value of @xmath25 assuming that the hadron production is two stage process : ( i ) production of mini jet with @xmath26 and ( ii ) minijet decay in hadrons which can be taken from @xmath27 process .",
    "finally , [ sp3 ] < n_g(y ) > = 2 3 , which gives @xmath28 .      finally , we have [ god1 ] |_y = 0 = 0.02 pb we can increase the cross section , measuring reaction of . its cross section is equal to [ god2 ]    ( pp \\rightarrow pp h)}{d y}|_{y = 0 } \\left ( \\frac{\\sigma^{sd}\\cdot b_{el}(\\sqrt{s}/m_h)}{4\\,\\sigma_{el}\\cdot b_{dd}(\\sqrt{s}/m_h ) } \\right)^2 = \\ ] ] @xmath29      and are our results .",
    "i firmly believe that they give the maximum values of the cross sections which we could obtain from reasonable estimates .",
    "however , i would like to summarize the most sensitive points in our estimates :    1 .",
    "the scale for running coupling qcd constant in cross section of higgs production .",
    "we took the `` soft '' scale for our estimates .",
    "however , it is a point which needs more discussion and even more it looks in contradiction with our feeling , as i have realised during our last meeting .",
    "my argument is the blm procedure but more discussions are needed ; 2 .",
    "we took @xmath30 for double pomeron processes the same as for  hard \" lrg process .",
    "the justification for this is eikonal type model @xcite , but it could be different opinions as well as direct experimental data ; 3 .",
    "the estimates for @xmath21 is very approximate and we need to work out better theory for this suppression .",
    "we would like also to mention that the new ideas on high energy interaction such as the saturation of the gluon density at high energy@xcite , will give a more optomistic estimates for the process of interest .",
    "the main observation is that there are two contributions for heavy quark diffractive production ( see ): ( i ) the first is so called ingelman - schlein mechanism @xcite which described by fig.2-a and ( ii ) the second one is closely related to coherent diffraction suggested in ref . @xcite and which corresponds to fig .",
    "the estimates of both of them have been discussed in ref .",
    "the main conclusion is that the main contribution for the tevatron energies stems from cd ( see also @xcite while the is mechanism leads to the value of the cross section in one order @xcite less than cd one . on the other hand in dis",
    "the cd contribution belongs to the high twisdt and because of that it is rather small @xcite .",
    "our conclusion is very simple . at the tevatrom",
    "we has a good chance to measure a new contribution to  hard \" diffraction which is small in dis .",
    "the typical values of the cross section is @xmath31 [ hq1 ] 10 ^ -4 10 ^ -10 forp_t , min = 550gev one can find all details in ref .",
    "i am very grateful to a. gotsman and u. maor for encouraging optimism and their permanent discussions on the subject .",
    "my special thanks goes to larry mclerran and his mob at the bnl for very creative atmosphere and fruitful discussions .",
