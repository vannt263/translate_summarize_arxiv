    "igr  j16318 - 4818 was discovered by the isgri detector of the ibis instrument onboard the integral satellite ( corvoisier et al .",
    "2003 ) on january 29 , 2003 , with a 1540  kev flux of 50100  mcrab .",
    "it was initially interpreted as a new `` transient '' x - ray source . however , a reanalysis of archival asca data revealed the presence of a source whose position was coincident with that of igr  j16318 - 4818 ( murakami et al .",
    "2003 ) , and with a 210  kev observed flux of about @xmath5  erg  @xmath1  s@xmath6 .",
    "the integral discovery prompted a target of opportunity observation with xmm - newton ( jansen et al .",
    "2001 ) on february 10 , 2003 .",
    "the epic spectra unveiled a variable and strongly absorbed source , with evidence for strong emission lines ( schartel et al .",
    "this is in agreement with the asca source , in which revnivtsev et al .",
    "( 2003 ) suggested a column density @xmath7  @xmath1 .",
    "preliminary spectral fits ( de plaa et al . 2003 ) indeed suggested that during the xmm - newton observation igr  j16318 - 4818 was obscured by a compton - thick absorber [ @xmath8  @xmath1 ; all errors quoted hereinafter are at the 90% confidence level for one interesting parameter ] .",
    "the emission complex could be resolved in three lines , with centroid energy of @xmath9  kev , @xmath10  kev and @xmath11  kev .    in this paper",
    "we exploit the unprecedented sensitivity of the epic detectors above 5  kev ( where fluorescent transition of fe and ni are concentrated ) to characterize the physical properties of the matter responsible for the obscuration of the x - ray source and the associated reprocessing features . to achieve this goal",
    ", we compare the spectral fit results ( presented and discussed in sect .",
    "3.1 of this letter ) with monte - carlo simulations of the x - ray transmission by neutral matter ( matt et al . 1999 ; matt 2002 ; see sect .  3.2 ) , originally developed in the context of obscured agn .",
    "we demonstrate in this paper that a proper modeling of the scattering effect is crucial to correctly identify the properties of the absorber , as standard fits with approximate model can grossly overestimate the actual absorbing column density and covering factor of the obscuring matter .",
    "study of the spectral variability during the xmm - newton observation allowed us to set stringent constraints on the geometry of the absorbing matter ( see sect .",
    "our findings and conclusions are summarized in sect .",
    "in this paper , we discuss the pn data only ( strder et al . 2001 ) , as this instrument seems to be the best calibrated among the epic cameras ( see , for instance , the discussion in molendi et al .",
    "2003 ) , at least in their highest energy band .",
    "data were retrieved from the xmm - newton target of opportunity public web page as observation data files ( odf ) , and reprocessed with sas v.5.4.1 , using a calibration index file corresponding to the most updated calibration files available at february 21 , 2003 .",
    "spectra were extracted from a circular region around the source centroid ( @xmath12 , @xmath13 ; schartel et al .",
    "2003 ) with a 52@xmath14 radius .",
    "as the extraction region encompassed two ccds , background spectra were extracted from a nearby source - free region , having the same area ratio between the two chips as the source extraction region .",
    "we verified that the results are not substantially different , if the source and background pn spectra are extracted from a smaller region ( 11@xmath14 radius ) , fully comprised in the same ccd .",
    "the spectra were accumulated using single- and double - events .",
    "pile - up is negligible , as well as the contribution of the background , lower than 0.1% in the 515  kev energy band .",
    "nevertheless , a short interval of about 1.25  ks duration , where the background count rate ( calculated on the single - event light curve extracted above 10  kev ) exceeded 1  @xmath15 , was removed from the scientific product accumulation .",
    "the background is otherwise quite stable .",
    "the fits described in this letter were performed with xspec v.11.1 .",
    "as already noted by de plaa et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , the xmm - newton spectra are characterized by a heavily absorbed continuum and 3 emission lines .",
    "the lines are most naturally interpreted as the fe k@xmath2 and k@xmath16 and the ni k@xmath2 .",
    "we therefore fitted the spectrum ( in the 5 - 13 kev energy band , as below 5 kev a small excess emission is present , see below ) with the simplest possible model : an absorbed power law plus three ( unabsorbed ) narrow ( _ i.e. _ intrinsic width , @xmath17 , fixed to 1 ev ) gaussian lines .",
    "the photoelectric absorption model varabs has been used with element abundances from anders & grevesse ( 1989 ) and photoelectric cross sections from balucinska - church & mccammon ( 1992 ) .",
    "we left the iron abundance free to vary independently of the other elements .",
    "as the absorbing matter results to be compton  thick ( see below ) , we included also thompson absorption ( model cabs ) .",
    "it is worth noting that this model , ignoring the scattering of photons , is , strictly speaking , valid only for absorbing matter along the line of sight with a negligible covering factor ( see below for a discussion ) ,    the fit is reasonably good ( @xmath18=99.1/64 d.o.f . ) , but residuals around the iron k@xmath2 line are visible , most likely due to the compton shoulder ( cs ) , as already observed in the reflection spectrum of the circinus galaxy ( bianchi et al .",
    "2002 ; molendi et al .",
    "2003 ) , and expected on theoretical ground ( see matt 2002 and references therein )",
    ". modeling for simplicity the compton shoulder with a gaussian with centroid energy fixed to 6.3 kev , and @xmath17 fixed to 50 ev , a significant improvement is found ( @xmath18=80.9/63 d.o.f .",
    ", corresponding to 99.96% confidence level ) . in the following",
    "we will refer to the complete model ( absorbed power - law plus 4 gaussian emission lines ) as the _ baseline model_. the best fit results are summarized in table  [ bestfit ] .",
    "the observed 2 - 10 kev flux is 6.7@xmath1910@xmath20 erg cm@xmath6 s@xmath6 .",
    "the flux corrected for absorption is instead 1.1@xmath1910@xmath22 erg cm@xmath6 s@xmath6 , corresponding to a luminosity of 1.3@xmath23 erg s@xmath6 , where @xmath24 is the distance to the source in units of 10 kpc .    given the large column density of the line  of  sight absorber ,",
    "if the covering factor of the absorbing matter is large , a significant contribution from photons scattered towards the line of sight is expected , as discussed in matt et al .",
    "we therefore fitted the spectrum with the monte - carlo model described in that paper .",
    "the fit is completely unacceptable .",
    "this may be due to the fact that the model has been calculated adopting the morrison & mccammon ( 1983 ) cross sections , which made use of the anders & ebihara ( 1982 ) element abundances . in this set",
    "the iron abundance is about 0.7 times that given by anders & grevesse ( 1983 ) , while from table  [ bestfit ] it seems that the actual iron abundance ( mainly derived in the fit from the depth of the iron edge ) in the absorbing material is closer to the one given by the latter authors .",
    "moreover , the matt et al .",
    "( 1999 ) model assumed spherical geometry and homogeneous matter , while the covering factor may be significantly smaller than one and the average column density smaller than that on the line  of  sight ( see below ) .",
    "coming back to the results summarized in table  [ bestfit ] , we must first of all remark that the rather small errors on @xmath25 and n@xmath26 are somewhat misleading .",
    "in fact , as it is clear from the contour plot ( fig .  [ gamma_nh ] ) , the @xmath18 distribution is shallow and not very smooth .",
    "the calculated errors correspond to the @xmath27 in the vicinity of the best fit , but other regions with @xmath27 less than 2.71 do exist .",
    "we have verified that n@xmath26 and a@xmath28 are only slightly correlated each other . to avoid problems in the estimate of the errors for the line parameters , we fixed @xmath25 and n@xmath26 to their best fit values .",
    "this does not affect very much the errors on the fe and ni k@xmath2 lines , but stabilizes the values for the fe k@xmath16 , which otherwise would be very difficult to find , due to its proximity to the iron edge .",
    "the energies of the fe and ni k@xmath2 lines correspond to neutral or low ionized atoms ( house 1969 ) . on the contrary ,",
    "the fe k@xmath16 centroid energy is significantly larger than expected .",
    "this can not be due to high ionization , not only because it does not agree with the k@xmath2 energy , but also because for significantly ionized matter the k@xmath16 line becomes much fainter , to disappear completely for fe xvii or more , when no m electrons remain .",
    "instead the observed k@xmath16/k@xmath2 ratio ( @xmath29 ) is slightly larger than expected for neutral iron ( see the discussion in molendi et al . 2003 , where however the matter was seen in reflection , not transmission ; the arguments given there must therefore be taken with caution , until proper calculations will be available ) .",
    "it should however be noted that , given the proximity to the iron edge , the parameters of the k@xmath16 line are necessarily difficult to estimate , and may suffer from a too simple modeling of the edge ( palmeri et al .",
    "2002 ) .",
    "the ni to fe k@xmath2 line ratio is about 6% , suggesting a possible ni overabundance ( see again the discussion in molendi et al .",
    "2003 , with the same caution given above ) . in table",
    "[ bestfit ] , the ew of the lines with respect to the unabsorbed continuum ( to make easier the comparison with the expected value for the iron k@xmath2 presented in matt 2002 ) , are also given .",
    "the value reported in fig .",
    "1 of matt ( 2002 ) are for morrison & mccammon ( 1983 ) abundances , and a power law index of 2 .",
    "we therefore calculated the expected fe k@xmath2 properties using the code described in matt ( 2002 ) , adopting the anders & grevesse abundances and the best fit value for @xmath25 , n@xmath26 , and a@xmath28 .",
    "the expected value of the ratio , @xmath30 , between the compton shoulder and the line core is 0.44 , to be compared with a measured value of @xmath31 .",
    "@xmath30 does not depend much on the geometry , but rather on the column density ( matt 2002 ) .",
    "the observed value would correspond to a column density of a few @xmath3 @xmath1 , for which values around 100 ev of the ew are expected ( a value of about 20 ev is instead expected for 1.9@xmath0 @xmath1 ) .",
    "the observed ew is instead about 13 ev .",
    "it is then possible that the matter is very inhomogeneous , with a denser blob just on the line of sight ( which is what the fit can measure ) but an average optical depth an order of magnitude less , and a covering factor , taking into account the uncertainties on the power law index , of about 0.10.2 .",
    "the lower ( with respect to the line of sight ) average column density , along with the relative small covering factor , would explain the failure of the matt et al .",
    "( 1999 ) model in fitting the data .    because there is evidence that the absorbing material has a covering factor less than 1 , part of the x ",
    "ray illuminated surface should be directly visible , producing a compton reflection component ( george & fabian 1991 ; matt , perola & piro 1991 ) as commonly observed in compton  thick agn ( matt et al . 2000 and references therein ) . as discussed above ,",
    "the average column density is possibly as low as a few @xmath3 @xmath1 ; however , below the iron line energy the reflection component for this column density is very similar to that for compton  thick matter ( matt et al .",
    "this component could therefore account for the excess emission below 5 kev ( see fig .",
    "[ allsp ] , where the whole 0.3 - 13 kev spectrum is shown , after being fitted with the baseline model ) , and down to about 2 kev ( the further excess at lower energies should have a different origin ) . fitting the 2 - 13 kev spectrum with the baseline model gives @xmath18=104.9/68 d.o.f .",
    ", and a very flat ( @xmath25=0.6 ) power law .",
    "the addition of a pure compton reflection component ( with the photon index linked to that of the absorbed power law , and fixed to 1.6 ) improves the fit significantly , giving @xmath18=79.9/68 d.o.f .. the value of @xmath32 , 0.003 , implies that the visible part of the illuminated matter is very small ( @xmath32 is equal to 1 for 2@xmath33 visible solid angle , i.e. a covering factor of 0.5 ) . as the source lies on the galactic plane , absorption from interstellar matter is likely to be significant .",
    "we then added an absorption component , but the fit does not significantly improve ( @xmath18=77.9/68 d.o.f . ) .",
    "the best - fit face value for the column density of this further absorber is about 5@xmath34 @xmath1 , and @xmath32=0.0045 .",
    "( if this is indeed the column density of the interstellar absorption , the emission below 2 kev is likely due to another , nearby confusing source . )",
    "the other parameters are similar to those listed in table  [ bestfit ] .",
    "the iron line ew with respect to the reflection component is very large , @xmath3528 kev , implying that almost all of the line is related to the transmitted component .",
    "of course , part of the excess emission may be due to photons scattered in transmission rather than reflection , i.e. escaping from the far side ( with respect to the x - ray source ) of the obscuring matter .",
    "the small value of @xmath32 may , at the first glance , appears rather surprising , given the value of the covering factor deduced from the iron line ew and the cs ( about 0.1 ) .",
    "it may be explained if , e.g. , the absorber has a flat configuration ( similar to the ` torus ' envisaged in unification models for agn ) , seen at high inclination .",
