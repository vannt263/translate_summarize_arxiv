    "semileptonic decays of the @xmath0 account for a fair fraction of the total width .",
    "the branching ratios for decay into @xmath4 and @xmath5 are both about 2% @xcite and they have been the object of theoretical study .",
    "different semileptonic decays of the @xmath0 have been studied theoretically within the formalism of heavy quark theory @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "semileptonic decays of @xmath6 mesons have got comparatively more attention , both experimentally and theoretically .",
    "quark models are used for @xmath6 and @xmath7 decays in @xcite , heavy quark effective theory is also considered in @xcite , the light - front formalism is used in a relativistic calculation of form factors for semileptonic decays in the constituent quark model in @xcite and lattice qcd calculations have also brought their share to this problem @xcite .",
    "more recently the issue has been retaken .",
    "quark models for semileptonic decays are used in @xcite , heavy meson chiral perturbation theory is found particularly suited in case with small recoil ( when the lepton pair carries much energy ) and is used in @xcite , while for large recoil , an approach that combines both hard - scattering and low - energy interactions has been developed in @xcite .",
    "particular interest is offered by semileptonic decays into a pair of mesons when this pair interacts strongly giving rise to resonances .",
    "the interest then is focused on the region of invariant masses where the resonance appears , looking for different channels .",
    "the fact that one needs only to study a narrow window of invariant masses allows one to use the practically constant hard form factors of these processes in that range and concentrate on the effects of the meson meson interaction , thus learning about details of hadron interactions , and eventually of the nature of the resonances that are formed in the process .",
    "this is the spirit of the works @xcite . in @xcite",
    "the molecular nature of the @xmath8 and @xmath9 resonances is tested using the semileptonic @xmath10 and @xmath6 decays . in @xcite the nature of the light scalar mesons @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath14",
    "is tested with the semileptonic decays of @xmath7 mesons .",
    "the @xmath2 is an emblematic baryon resonance which has captured the attention of hadron physicists for long , because it does not follow the standard pattern of the three quark baryons .",
    "indeed , in @xcite it was already suggested that this resonance should be a molecular state of @xmath15 and @xmath3 .",
    "the advent of chiral unitary theory has allowed to make this idea more precise and consistent with the basic dynamics of qcd encoded in the chiral lagrangians @xcite .",
    "early in the developments of this theory it was found in @xcite that there are two poles in the same riemann sheet and , hence , two states , associated to this resonance .",
    "a detailed study was done in @xcite by looking at the breaking of su(3 ) , which confirmed the existence of these two poles and its dynamical origin .",
    "one of the consequences of the existence of these two states is that the shape of the resonance varies from one reaction to another , depending on the weight given to each one the poles by the reaction mechanisms @xcite .",
    "originally most reactions showed peaks around 1400  mev , from where the nominal mass of the resonance was taken , but the @xmath16 @xcite showed a neat peak around 1420  mev , narrower than the one observed in @xcite .",
    "this feature was interpreted within the chiral unitary approach in @xcite , showing the mechanisms that gave bigger weight to the resonance with higher mass .",
    "another relevant experiment was the one of @xcite which showed a peak around 1420  mev in the @xmath17 reaction , also interpreted theoretically in @xcite along the same lines ( see also the related refs .",
    "similarly , the thorough data on @xmath3 photoproduction at jefferson lab @xcite , and the subsequent analysis in @xcite , has further clarified the situation concerning the two @xmath2 states .",
    "the need to further clarify the existence and nature of these two @xmath2 states has prompted the suggestion of new reactions , using weak decays processes which , due to particular selection rules , act as filters of isospin i=0 and allow the formation of the @xmath2 without contamination of the i=1 .",
    "this is the case of the @xmath18 decay proposed in @xcite , which has partially been measured in @xcite and the @xmath19 proposed in @xcite and currently under study at belle @xcite .",
    "the neutrino induced production of the @xmath2 has also been suggested as a good tool to investigate the properties and nature of this resonance @xcite .    in the present work we study theoretically the semileptonic @xmath0 decay to @xmath1 and @xmath2 , which , as we shall see , is a perfect filter of i=0 and , hence , a very good instrument to isolate the @xmath2 and study its properties .",
    "the work combines the findings of @xmath18 decay in @xcite with those of the semileptonic @xmath7 decay studied in @xcite , and makes absolute predictions for invariant mass distributions of @xmath3 , from where the signal of the @xmath2 should be seen , and @xmath15 , in the reaction @xmath20 , with mb either @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "the @xmath26 process proceeds at the quark level through a first step shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] .",
    ".,height=113 ]    the process involves the @xmath27 weak transition , which is cabibbo favored , and this is the same one as in the @xmath7 decays studied in @xcite .",
    "there is , however , a novelty in the present process . indeed ,",
    "if we want to see the @xmath2 this must be done in the mass distribution of @xmath3 , hence the @xmath28 quark of fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] must hadronize into a meson baryon component .",
    "this is done easily for mesons since one introduces an extra @xmath29 meson with vacuum quantum number , @xmath30 , and then the two quarks after the weak process participate in the formation of the two mesons . with three quarks after the weak vertex , as in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] , the new @xmath29 pair can be placed in between different pairs of the @xmath28 quarks .",
    "however , there is some reason to do that involving the @xmath31 quark , such that the @xmath31 quark goes into the emerging meson .",
    "the reasons are the following :    * the @xmath0 has @xmath32 , and this forces the @xmath33 initial state to be in a @xmath32 state , @xmath34 .",
    "the dominant mechanism that requires just a one body operator involving the @xmath35 and @xmath31 quarks will leave the @xmath33 original quarks as spectators and will still have @xmath32 in the final state .",
    "they are also in @xmath36 in a quark picture of the wave function . since the @xmath2 has negative parity , it is the @xmath31 quark that will convey this parity , hence being in @xmath37 in a quark picture . since in the @xmath38 , or meson baryon states in general ,",
    "all quark are in the ground state , the @xmath31 quark must be deexcited and hence it has to participate in the hadronization .",
    "* even then we have the option to have the @xmath31 quark belonging to the meson or to the baryon .",
    "if the @xmath31 quark goes into the meson , the original @xmath39 quarks are spectators and go into the final baryon , the other needed quark coming from the additional @xmath40 of the hadronization .",
    "if the @xmath31 quark goes into the baryon , the original @xmath41 or @xmath42 quark must go into the meson . in these processes",
    "the baryon is the heaviest particle and the phase space favors the lighter mesons and leptons to carry the momenta and , thus , the energy",
    ". if we have @xmath43 , the pair @xmath44 and the pion would basically carry all the energy and then the @xmath45 ( and the @xmath46 ) has about 550 mev / c . also the @xmath31 quark will carry the same momentum as the @xmath47 pair and go into the @xmath48 , essentially at rest .",
    "one has then form factors from the quark nuclear wave functions , involving twice a fair amount of momentum transfer and the mechanism is suppressed versus the one where the original @xmath39 quarks are spectators . after the former discussion the dominant mechanism for the hadronization is depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] .",
    "this is what was done in the @xmath49  @xcite and the @xmath50  @xcite reactions .",
    "state after the weak process.,height=132 ]      the procedure followed here is inspired in the approach of @xcite where the basic mechanisms at the quark level are investigated , then pairs of hadrons are produced after implementing hadronization , and finally these hadrons are allowed to undergo final state interaction . with the @xmath39 quarks as spectators in @xmath32 the final @xmath51 state also has @xmath32 and we , thus , have a filter of @xmath32 .",
    "then , upon hadronization the final meson baryon is constructed as follows  @xcite , @xmath52 where @xmath53 and @xmath54 . + it is convenient to write the @xmath55 matrix , @xmath56 , in terms of mesons and we have @xmath57 where the standard @xmath58 mixing has been assumed  @xcite . neglecting the @xmath59 terms because of its large mass , as done in @xcite , we have @xmath60 we can see that we have now the mixed antisymmetric representation of the octet of baryons . by taking this wave function for the @xmath61 and @xmath62 states ( see @xcite ) we find @xcite @xmath63 one must recall that the @xmath2 is obtained in coupled channel from the interaction of the @xmath64 states , however , as a first step only the @xmath38 and @xmath65 states are formed , but not the @xmath66 and @xmath67 . since the @xmath2 is seen in the @xmath66 invariant mass spectrum ,",
    "the only way to see @xmath66 is through rescattering of the @xmath38 and @xmath65 states and this involves directly the transition @xmath68 and @xmath69 matrix elements that contain the @xmath2 pole . in other words",
    ", we do not have @xmath66 at the tree level and , thus , one avoids background , hence , stressing more the @xmath2 signal .",
    "we have these two benefits in the reaction : there is an @xmath32 filter , and the @xmath2 is produced with no background .",

    "we must take into account the weak vertex and altogether the matrix element @xmath90 for the semileptonic decay is given by @xcite @xmath91 where @xmath92 by following the steps of @xcite we find for the sum and average over the polarization of the fermions @xmath93 where @xmath94 stands for the final @xmath95 system formed and , thus , @xmath96 .",

    "the real predictions of the work are the shape of the @xmath2 , which is due to the state around 1420 mev , and the relative strength of @xmath38 mass distribution above the @xmath38 threshold and the @xmath66 distribution at the resonance peak . as to the absolute ratio",

    "this means that one is mostly exciting the @xmath2 state at 1420 mev .",
    "the other state is around 1385  mev , but does not play much of a role in this reaction .",
    "this has a dynamical reason . as is well known from the chiral unitary approach , the high mass @xmath2 state couples mostly to @xmath38 , while the one at 1385 mev couples more strongly to @xmath3 .",
    "since in the primary production of @xmath95 we produce @xmath121 , but not @xmath3 , it becomes clear that the resonance excited is the one around 1420 mev .",
    "this is a neat prediction of the chiral unitary approach for these resonances that the experiment could prove or disprove .",
    "we observe some differences in the strength for @xmath22 , @xmath21 and @xmath23 .",
    "this is because , even if we have filtered @xmath32 in this reaction , the scattering matrices induce a bit of isospin breaking became the different masses of mesons and baryons in the same isospin multiplet .",
    "this can also be observed in the bonn model in fig .  3 of @xcite .",
    "the result and the ordering of the strength of the channels is remarkable similar to what is obtained in fig .  5 of @xcite .",
    "the strength for the @xmath24 and @xmath75 production is also similar to what is obtained in  @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the strength of the @xmath38 distribution at its peak is about one fourth of the strength of the @xmath3 distribution at its peak , a feature also shared by these different works , and this is also a prediction of the chiral unitary approach .",
    "the fall down with @xmath89 of this distribution depends somewhat on the reaction and the particular model used .",
    "here we use the lowest order weinberg tomozawa term for the kernel @xmath85 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : bs ] ) , while in @xcite , in the bonn model , higher order terms were considered in the kernel  @xcite .",
    "the values obtained for @xmath122 are of the same order of magnitude as those found in @xcite for the @xmath7 semileptonic decays with two mesons in the final state .",
    "if we integrate the strength below the @xmath2 peak , we find @xmath123 ns@xmath124 and the mean life of the @xmath0 is @xmath125 ns@xmath124 .",
    "thus we are taking about a branching ratio of about @xmath126 , which is within measuring range , since boundaries of @xmath127 for certain branching ratios have been stablished  @xcite .",
    "if we use instead the vale @xmath117 from @xcite , then the branching ratio becomes @xmath128 .",
    "accepting uncertainties in the value of @xmath88 , the message is that the ratios obtained are within present measurable capacities .",
    "we have studied the semileptonic decay of the @xmath129 with mb , a pair of meson baryons , @xmath3 or @xmath15 .",
    "the idea is to look for the @xmath3 mass distribution where the @xmath2 state of higher energy ( around 1420 mev ) should show up .",
    "the reaction was shown to have some welcome features : it filters i=0 and thus one avoids having to separate contributions from i=1 which complicate the analysis of data in other reactions .",
    "next , since the primary production of meson baryon in this process does not produce @xmath3 , this channel will appear through rescattering of the @xmath15 and @xmath130 which are the states primarily produced .",
    "this avoids background originated from tree level terms and the resonance shows up more clearly . finally , the chiral unitary approach predicts two states around the @xmath2 , the one with lower mass coupling mostly to @xmath3 , and the one of higher mass coupling mostly to @xmath15 .",
    "since the reaction is such that the resonance is produced though rescattering of a primary @xmath15 , this guarantees that one will see mostly this latter state and we predict a clean peak around 1420 mev , that the experiment could support or disprove .",
    "in addition we also make predictions for production of @xmath15 pairs , which are tied to the dynamics of the chiral unitary approach and could be investigated at the same time .",
    "the fact that we only need the mass distribution in a narrow region of the invariant mass , allows us to factorize in a constant all elements of the weak transition and the hadronization which are not explicitly considered , and the dependence of the final distributions on the invariant mass is then tied to the final state interaction of the meson baryon pairs , which in particular generate the two @xmath2 states .    while most of the theoretical hadron community would agree on the existence of two states of the @xmath2 and the molecular nature of these states , there are still some differences as to the position of the lower mass state and details on the mass distributions .",
    "also , these ideas are not so broadly accepted in the experimental hadron community .",
    "it is most convenient to carry out these experiments where neat predictions are made which are tied to the concrete chiral dynamics in coupled channels that generates these states .",
    "experimental confirmation of these predictions would be a step forward to consolidate these ideas and make progress in the understanding of the nature of baryons .",
