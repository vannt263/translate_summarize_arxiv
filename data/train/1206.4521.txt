    "<S> a major unresolved question in geometric frustration concerns the fate of the spin ice state , when the strength of the local ising anisotropy is reduced . </S>",

    "<S> moreover , for magnetic fields applied along @xmath18 the specific heat  @xcite and neutron scattering  @xcite suggest field - induced order with spin - ice like properties  @xcite , while the spin order for field along @xmath10 is undetermined  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> magneto - elastic effects are also known to be very pronounced  @xcite , consistent with the observation of pressure induced antiferromagnetic order @xcite .    </S>",

    "<S> however , because the zero - frequency qsi correlations may be masked by strong fluctuations and difficult to detect experimentally , it has been emphasized that magnetization measurements at mk temperatures are ideal to identify a qsi , since they probe the zero frequency ( and zero wave vector ) response .    </S>",

    "<S> our vcm represents a new development previously thought to be prohibitively difficult . as the main advantage of the vcm , the sample does not move during measurements ( the detection system is completely decoupled from the dilution refrigerator ) . </S>",

    "<S> high temperature data were recorded in an oxford instruments vibrating sample magnetometer .    for our study a single crystal was grown at mcmaster university by optical float - zoning . the feed and seed rods were prepared by annealing high - purity tb@xmath22o@xmath2 and tio@xmath0 in air . </S>",
    "<S> the sample was then float - zoned in a high - purity ar atmosphere of 4bar with a rate of 7mmhr@xmath20 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> powder x - ray diffraction of a small piece of the single crystal confirmed that the ingot was phase - pure with the correct crystal structure . </S>",

    "<S> the internal fields were estimated to deviate by a few degrees from the @xmath28 $ ] and @xmath29 $ ] directions , because the plane of the disc was tilted with respect to the applied field . </S>",

    "<S> prior to recording these data the superconducting magnet was demagnetized at @xmath34 to remove any parasitic remanent fields . </S>",
    "<S> after zero - field cooling the field was increased at a rate of @xmath35 to the setpoint of 10mt and data recorded while heating the sample continuously with @xmath36 up to @xmath25 ( zfc - fh ) . following this the sample </S>",
    "<S> was cooled down with the field unchanged and data recorded while heating at the same rate ( fc - fh ) .    </S>",
    "<S> with decreasing temperature the magnetization increases with a positive curvature consistent with the paramagnetic properties at high temperatures . in all field directions , </S>",
    "<S> the curves display a cusp in the zfc - fh and fc - fh data . </S>",
    "<S> we find slightly different values of @xmath37 , @xmath38 and @xmath39 for @xmath29 $ ] , @xmath28 $ ] and @xmath7 $ ] , respectively , not reported previously . for @xmath40 the zfc - fh and fc - fh data agree essentially ( the nature of the tiny difference for @xmath29 $ ] is most likely associated with a small drift of the detection system ) .    the shape of the cusp , the absolute difference of zfc - fh and fc - fh data and the qualitative temperature dependence of the data provide strong evidence of the emergence of intrinsic magnetic glassiness below @xmath41 which is essentially isotropic . </S>",
    "<S> note that magnetic ordering coexisting with persistent low temperature fluctuations has been reported in a variety of geometrically frustrated systems  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it is therefore perfectly consistent with the persistent muon spin relaxation observed in in tb@xmath0ti@xmath1o@xmath2 using @xmath16sr @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the absolute size of the magnetization for @xmath40 , being largest for [ 110 ] and smallest for [ 111 ] , suggests that the tiny variation in @xmath41 and the difference between fc - fh and zfc - fh , which are also largest for [ 110 ] and smallest for [ 111 ] , originate from the magnetic anisotropy . </S>",

    "<S> we find no evidence for a magnetization plateau , predicted for qsi . </S>",
    "<S> this contrasts with classical spin ice systems , where the magnetization plateaux are a prominent feature strictly along @xmath10 on the same scale . </S>",

    "<S> as for the exchange coupling it is important to note that the experimental value was determined in large magnetic fields and may therefore differ from low fields @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , as shown in ref.@xcite for @xmath58 the predicted ground state depends on the model and its implementation  @xcite , where the dipolar spin ice model and a cubic unit cell model with ewald summed dipole - dipole interactions and crystal electric fields predict aiao antiferromagnetism and long - range spin ice with ordering wave vector @xmath59 , lrsi@xmath60 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> note however that the phase diagram is sensitive to the model used  @xcite . in particular , the model of refs . </S>",
    "<S> [ 6 - 8 ] completely ignores the possibility of anisotropic exchange and higher multipolar couplings . </S>",
    "<S> because tb@xmath0ti@xmath1o@xmath2 does not develop spontaneous long - range magnetic order , it seems natural to conclude that the spin liquid in tb@xmath0ti@xmath1o@xmath2 is dominated by strong fluctuations at the border of aiao - antiferromagnetism . </S>",
