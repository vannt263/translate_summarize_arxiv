    "abelianizations of finite group actions on complex manifolds appeared prominently in the work of batyrev  @xcite , and a connection to the wonderful arrangement models of de  concini and procesi was observed by borisov and gunnells  @xcite .",
    "the authors of the present article have previously presented a detailed study of the key example over the reals , the abelianization of the permutation action of the symmetric group @xmath1 on @xmath2 given by the maximal de  concini - procesi model of the braid arrangement , cf .",
    "in particular , it was shown that stabilizers of points on the arrangement model are elementary abelian  @xmath0-groups .",
    "we suggest to call an abelianization with this property a _",
    "digitalization _ of the given action .    in the present article",
    ", we extend our analysis in two steps . first ,",
    "for any linear action of a finite group on a real vector space , we define an arrangement of linear subspaces whose maximal de  concini - procesi model we then show to be a digitalization of the given action .",
    "second , we proceed by analysing differentiable actions of finite groups on smooth real manifolds . we propose a locally finite stratification of the manifold by smooth submanifolds and , observing that this stratification is actually a local subspace arrangement ,",
    "we show that the associated maximal de  concini - procesi model is a digitalization of the given action .",
    "we present examples in the linear and in the non - linear case .",
    "first , we consider the permutation action of the symmetric group  @xmath1 on @xmath2 , and we find that our arrangement construction yields the rank @xmath0  truncation of the braid arrangement .",
    "the resulting digitalization is the one discussed in  @xcite .",
    "it would be interesting to extend this result to the action of an arbitrary reflection group . as a non - linear example , we consider the action of @xmath1 on @xmath3 given by projectivizing the real permutation action on  @xmath2 .",
    "we show that our manifold stratification , in this case , coincides with the rank @xmath0  truncation of the projectivized braid arrangement .",
    "the resulting digitalization thus is the maximal projective de  concini - procesi model for the braid arrangement .",
    "we give a short overview on the material presented in this article : in section  [ sec_review ] we provide a review of de  concini - procesi arrangement models in an attempt to keep this exposition fairly self - contained .",

    "we propose a digitalization for any given linear action of a finite group on a real vector space ; in  [ ssec_mnfds ] we extend our setting to differentiable actions of finite groups on smooth real manifolds .",
    "section  [ sec_appl ] is focused on examples .",
    "we work out the details of the proposed digitalizations for the real permutation action in  [ ssec_maxan ] , and for the permutation action on real projective spaces in  [ ssec_maxpan ] .",
    "we review the construction of de  concini - procesi arrangement models as presented in  @xcite .",
    "moreover , we recall an encoding of points in maximal arrangement models from  @xcite that will be crucial for the technical handling of stabilizers ( cf .",

    "let @xmath4 be a finite family of linear subspaces in some real or complex vector space  @xmath5 .",
    "the combinatorial data of such subspace arrangement is customarily recorded by its _ intersection lattice _ @xmath6 , the partially ordered set of intersections among subspaces in @xmath4 ordered by reversed inclusion .",
    "we agree on the empty intersection to be the full space @xmath5 , represented by the minimal element @xmath7 in the lattice .",
    "we will frequently use @xmath8 to denote @xmath9 .",
    "there is a family of arrangement models each coming from the choice of a certain subset of the intersection lattice , so - called _",
    "building sets_. for the moment we restrict our attention to the maximal model among those , which results from choosing the whole intersection lattice as a building set .",
    "we give two alternative descriptions for the maximal de  concini - procesi model of @xmath4 .",
    "consider the following map on the complement @xmath10 of the arrangement , @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the natural inclusion into the first factor and the natural projection to the other factors restricted to @xmath13 .",
    "formally , @xmath14 where @xmath15 denotes the linear span of subspaces or vectors , respectively , and @xmath16 is interpreted as a point in @xmath17 for any @xmath18 .",
    "the map @xmath12 defines an embedding of @xmath13 into the product on the right hand side of  ( [ eq_modelconstr ] ) .",
    "the closure of its image , @xmath19 , is the _ maximal de concini - procesi model _ of the arrangement  @xmath4 .",
    "if we want to stress the ambient space of the original arrangement , we will use the notation @xmath20 for @xmath21 .",
    "alternatively , one can describe @xmath21 as the result of successive blowups of strata in @xmath5 .",
    "consider the stratification of @xmath5 given by the linear subspaces in @xmath4 and their intersections .",
    "choose some linear extension of the opposite order in @xmath22 .",
    "then , @xmath21 is the result of successive blowups of strata , respectively proper transforms of strata , corresponding to the subspaces in @xmath22 in the chosen linear extension order .",

    "we therefore stay with the affine setting in the following exposition .      the term _ wonderful _ models has been coined for @xmath21 and its generalizations for other choices of building sets .",
    "we summarize the key facts about the maximal model supporting this connotation .",
    "the space @xmath21 is a smooth algebraic variety with a natural projection onto the original ambient space @xmath5 , @xmath24 .",
    "the map @xmath25 is the projection onto the first coordinate of the ambient space of @xmath21 on the right hand side of  ( [ eq_modelconstr ] ) , respectively the concatenation of blowdown maps of the sequence of blowups resulting in  @xmath21 .",
    "this projection is an isomorphism on @xmath13 , while the complement @xmath26 is a divisor with normal crossings with irreducible components indexed by the elements of @xmath8 .",
    "an intersection of several irreducible components is non - empty ( moreover , transversal and irreducible ) if and only if the indexing lattice elements form a totally ordered set , i.e. , a chain , in  @xmath22  @xcite .",
    "the stratification by irreducible components of the divisor and their intersections is called the _ nested set stratification _ of @xmath21 , denoted @xmath27 , for reasons that lie in the more general model construction for arbitrary building sets rather than the maximal building set  @xmath8 .",
    "points in @xmath21 can be described as a sequence of a point and a number of lines in the vector space  @xmath5 according to the form of the ambient space for @xmath21 given on the right hand side of  ( [ eq_modelconstr ] ) .",

    "the lattice element @xmath37 , in turn , is the maximal lattice element that contains both @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "the specification of lines  @xmath32 , i.e. , lines that correspond to coordinates of @xmath28 in @xmath38 , and the construction of lattice elements @xmath39 , continues analogously for @xmath40 until a last line @xmath41 is reached whose span with @xmath42 is not contained in any lattice element other than the full ambient space  @xmath5 . note that , if @xmath42 is a  hyperplane , then the line @xmath41 is uniquely determined .",
