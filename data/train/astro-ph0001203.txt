    "low mass black hole binaries ( lmbhbs ) and low mass neutron stars binaries ( lmnsbs ) are close binary systems in which a roche - lobe filling , low mass ( main sequence or sub - giant ) secondary star transfers mass to a compact primary .",
    "all known lmbhbs and several lmnsbs are transients ( see e.g. tanaka & lewin 1995 , van paradijs & mcclintock 1995 , white , nagase & parmar 1995 ) ; these transient systems are known as soft x - ray transients ( sxts ) , or x - ray novae .",
    "their outbursts last from several weeks to several months during which x  ray luminosities can approach the eddington limit .",
    "the outbursts are separated by long periods of quiescence lasting from one to tens of years ( see e.g. chen , shrader & livio 1997 ; hereafter csl ) .",
    "sxts are in some respects similar to dwarf novae ( dn ) , which exhibit outbursts of 4  6 magnitudes in optical .",
    "these outbursts typically last days and are separated by periods of quiescence of a few weeks .",
    "dn are a subclass of cataclysmic variables ( cvs ; see warner 1995 for a review ) , close binary systems similar to lmbhbs and lmnsbs , except for the compact primary which is a white dwarf .",
    "is is widely believed that dwarf nova outbursts are due to a thermal - viscous instability in the accretion disc of these systems . for effective temperatures between about 5000  k and 8000  k , accretion discs in which viscosity",
    "is described by the `` @xmath6prescription '' ( shakura & sunyaev 1973 ) are thermally and viscously unstable because of large changes in the opacity when hydrogen recombines .",
    "the disc instability model ( dim ; see cannizzo 1993b for a review ; hameury et al .",
    "1998 and menou , hameury & stehle 1999a for the most recent version of the model ) accounts for a number of general properties of dwarf novae .",
    "similarities between the properties of dn and sxts led to the suggestion that their outbursts have the same origin ( van paradijs & verbunt 1984 ; cannizzo , ghosh & wheeler 1982 ; huang & wheeler 1989 ; mineshige & wheeler 1989 ) .",
    "several important features of dn remain unexplained by the standard version of the dim , which assumes that the disc extends down to the white dwarf s surface , that the mass transfer rate from the secondary star is constant , and that effects of disc and secondary irradiation can be neglected ( see e.g. lasota & hameury 1998 ; lasota 1999 ; warner 1998 ; smak 1999 , hameury .",
    "lasota & warner 1999b for a discussion of these effects ) .",
    "this version can not account for the quiescent accretion rates onto the white dwarf ( they exceed the model predictions by more than two orders of magnitude ) , and for the very long recurrence times of wz  sge  type systems ( lasota 1996a , b ) .",
    "the observed delay between the rise in optical and in euv ( e.g. in ss cyg ; mauche 1996 ) was also long considered as a problem , but smak ( 1998 ) recently argued that it can be naturally reproduced by the dim if appropriate outer boundary conditions for the disc are used .",
    "similar difficulties , but more pronounced , appear for sxts , since the standard dim fails to reproduce a number of essential properties of these systems . in particular , an early attempt to explain the properties of bh sxt outbursts with the dim ( mineshige & wheeler 1989 ) was unable to reproduce the observed long recurrence times ( comparable to those of wz  sge systems ) and the high accretion rates required in outburst . in addition , the weak x - ray flux detected from quiescent bh sxts , which was mistakenly thought by some to be an argument in favour of the dim versus the competing mass transfer instability model , is many orders of magnitude larger than any flux predicted by the dim @xcite .    in the dn case ,",
    "the problems can been solved , at least in part , if a `` hole '' is present in the inner regions of the disc .",
    "the `` hole '' can either be caused by evaporation of the disc @xcite , or due to the extended magnetospheric cavity of the wd @xcite .",
    "a model in which a `` hole '' is included can account for both the euv delay and the quiescent x - ray luminosity ( if the hole is filled with a tenuous , x  ray emitting gas ; meyer & meyer - hofmeister 1994 ; hameury , lasota & dubus 1999a ) .",
    "the case of wz sge requires additional modifications of the standard dim .",
    "the very long recurrence time of this system , and the large amount of mass accreted during the outburst , can be reproduced either by using a value of the viscosity parameter @xmath2 several orders of magnitude lower than in other dn ( smak 1993 ; osaki 1995 ) , or by making the `` hole '' sufficiently large for the remaining disc to be globally stable . in the latter case , the outbursts would have to be triggered by enhanced mass transfer ( lasota , hameury & hur 1995 ; hameury , lasota & hur 1997b ) . a marginally stable , truncated disc , as proposed by warner , livio & tout , is equivalent to a globally stable disc from this point of view @xcite .",
    "if the truncated disc is globally stable , and @xmath7 , however , there is not enough mass in the disc to account for the outburst s total energy , so that enhanced mass transfer is also required during the outburst .",
    "hameury et al .",
    "find that if this enhanced mass transfer is due to irradiation of the secondary , the model reproduces the shape of the observed lightcurve .",
    "the presence of `` holes '' in the accretion discs of quiescent sxts seems unavoidable if their outbursts are due to the thermal - viscous instability ( lasota 1996a , b ) . in the bh case",
    ", such holes can only result from the evaporation of the accretion disc since black holes are not magnetized .",
    "narayan , mcclintock & yi ( 1996 ) proposed a model in which , as a result of evaporation , the inner parts of the accretion flow in quiescent bh sxts form an advection - dominated accretion flow ( adaf ; see also lasota , narayan & yi 1996 ; narayan , barret & mcclintock 1997 ) .",
    "the model explains the observed spectra and solves the problem of incompatibility between the accretion rates predicted by the dim and the observed flux .",
    "esin , mcclintock & narayan ( 1997 ; see also narayan 1996 ; esin et al .",
    "1998 ) extended the idea of two - component accretion flows a step further .",
    "they showed that the various spectral states of black hole x - ray binaries can be modeled as a sequence of physical states with varying accretion rates and sizes of the two components of the accretion flow . according to this model , in outburst",
    ", the disc extends down to the black hole , while the inner disc is gradually replaced by an adaf as a system goes to lower luminosity levels .",
    "a gradual evaporation of the inner disc during the decline is also qualitatively consistent with the accretion geometry inferred by ycki , done & smith ( 1999 ) from the x - ray reprocessing properties of several bh x - ray transients .",
    "hameury et al .",
    "( 1997a ) used the two component ( inner adaf + outer disc ) model to describe the quiescent state and the rise to outburst of the bh sxt gro j1655 - 40 .",
    "the model predictions agree with existing constraints on the spectrum of the system in quiescence , the observed 6 day delay between the rise to outburst of the optical and x - ray fluxes , and the rise - times of these two fluxes .",
    "recently , esin , lasota & hynes ( 1999 ) showed that the whole , unusual outburst can be described in the framework of the dim thus validating hameury et al .",
    "( 1997a ) results .    in this paper",
    ", we consider the role of disc evaporation on the predictions of the dim for sxt outbursts .",
    "we shall refer to a dim that includes evaporation as a truncated  disc instability model ( hereafter tdim ) .",
    "cannizzo ( 1998 ) already constructed tdims of the bh sxt a0620 - 00 with a weak evaporation and the prescription @xmath8 for the viscosity parameter .",
    "cannizzo s simulations show that models without evaporation lead to unreasonably short recurrence times , and that evaporation acts to increase the predicted recurrence times to values of several tens of years , as required .",
    "this is expected , since evaporation removes the inner , most unstable parts of the accretion disc .",
    "however , the outburst rise time predicted by cannizzo s model is an order of magnitude longer than the observed one .",
    "this is due to the use of the prescription @xmath8 according to lasota & hameury ( 1998 ) .",
    "there are two additional reasons to go beyond cannizzo s calculations .",
    "first , his calculations do not allow the disc outer radius to vary with time .",
    "smak ( 1984 , 1998 ; see also hameury et al .",
    "1998 ) showed that including this effect is crucial for reliable dim predictions of dn outbursts , and it is likely to be important for sxt models as well .",
    "second , in the models of cannizzo ( 1998 ) , the effect of including evaporation and using a very small value of @xmath5 in the quiescent disc are not clearly separated . in particular , in his work , it is unclear if evaporation alone can be held responsible for the long recurrence times , if values of @xmath5 similar to those inferred from applications of the dim to dn ( typically @xmath9 and @xmath1 ) are used for the discs of sxts . in our view",
    ", this is an important question because the evidence for disc evaporation , even indirect , is stronger than for any specific @xmath6prescription .    in   2 , we recall some important observational properties of bh and ns sxts , later used to constrain our models . in   3 , we first describe the numerical truncated disc instability model used .",
    "we then show that , in the limit where illumination can be neglected , tdims with values of @xmath5 considered as standard for dn discs are unable to reproduce the long recurrence times of sxts , no matter how strong the evaporation is . in   4 , we present other plausible models of sxts .",
    "we find that a tdim with a small value of @xmath2 ( @xmath10 ) and strong evaporation does reproduce the long recurrence times and the high maximum values of the accretion rate in the discs of sxts .",
    "we also present models in which the disc of sxts are globally stable and the outbursts are triggered by a slow variation of the mass transfer rate of the secondary . in   5 , we discuss important consequences , limitations and possible extensions of this work . in   6 , we summarize our main results .",
    "bh and ns x - ray transients show a rather complex behaviour ( see , e.g. , tanaka & shibazaki 1996 and csl for reviews ) . in this section",
    ", we identify several important properties of these systems which may be considered as characteristic of their class and therefore must be explained by a successful model of sxt outbursts .",
    "we will also often compare sxts with dn , since the same underlying thermal - viscous instability is supposed to be responsible for the outbursts in the two classes of systems .    as a guide , we use the observed properties of ss cyg , aql x-1 and a0620 - 00 as indicative of the general properties of u gem - type dn , ns sxts and bh sxts respectively , keeping in mind that significant differences exist even between two outbursts in a same system ( e.g. at least four types of outbursts in ss cyg ; warner 1995 ) .",
    "the timescales of evolution of an unsteady disc are simple and robust predictions of the dim , which provide powerful tests of the model when compared to the observations .",
    "this is because the time evolution of the disc is due to the existence of a well defined limit cycle in the dim , and because the observed variability is ` ready - to - interpret ' ( free of noise , systematic errors , etc .. ) .",
    "most of the properties of bh and ns sxts mentioned in this section are taken from the compilation of csl .",
    "we identify several important timescales for x - ray transients : the recurrence time @xmath11 between two successive outbursts , the e - folding rise timescale @xmath12 and the total rise time @xmath13 of an outburst ( which can be wavelength - dependent ) , the e - folding decay timescale @xmath14 ( which is wavelength dependent ) , and the total duration of the outburst @xmath15 . in our view , a model which fails to reproduce _ all _ these characteristic times is not fully satisfactory .",
    "none of the previous models of sxts passed this test ( e.g. mineshige & wheeler 1989 ; cannizzo 1998 ) .",
    "we focus our discussion on a sample of sxts with clearly identified primaries ( see garcia et al .",
    "1998 ) : the bh systems have firm dynamical lower limits on the mass of the primary , and the ns sxts showed type i x - ray bursts .",
    "we also focus on systems which have exhibited standard fast rise exponential decay ( fred ) lightcurves .",
    "this excludes the long period systems gro   j1655 - 40 and v  404  cyg and reduces the sample to four bh sxts ( a0620 - 00 , gs 2000 + 25 , grs 1124 - 683=nova mus 91 and gro j0422 + 32   best examples of freds \" according to csl ) and two ns sxts ( cen x-4 and aql x-1 ; here we chose only their outbursts of the fred type : it is not clear how the standard dim could account for the other types of lightcurves observed in sxts ) .",
    "aql x-1 experiences an outburst every year approximately , while the recurrence time of cen x-4 is @xmath16 years .",
    "a0620 - 00 experienced two outbursts separated by @xmath17 years ( note that no x - ray data are available for the presumed first outburst ) .",
    "most bh sxts did not experience a second outburst since their discovery by x - ray satellites , so that there is good evidence for the recurrence times of bh sxts generally exceeding @xmath18 years . as mentioned above , sxt recurrence times are similar to those of wz sge - type dn . for comparison ,",
    "the recurrence time of ss cyg is @xmath19 days ( e.g. cannizzo & mattei 1992 ) and the recurrence time of other u gem type dn is generally of the order of one month ( e.g. szkody & mattei 1984 ) .",
    "the characteristic x - ray rise timescales ( @xmath12 ) of fred - type sxts vary from 0.3 to 2 days ( for the period of fastest flux increase  csl ) .",
    "the total rise time @xmath13 from quiescence to outburst peak is difficult to estimate because it is instrument dependent , and because the coverage of the rising phase is , for obvious reasons , rather poor . for sxts , @xmath20 is @xmath21 5 to 10 days in x  rays , or perhaps longer . for comparison ,",
    "the total optical rise time in ss cyg is @xmath22 3 days ( for a ` type b ' outburst - see below ) .",
    "the optical rise time of several u gem - type dn in the sample of szkody & mattei ( 1984 ) is @xmath23 days .    in several",
    "dn , there is evidence for at least two types of outbursts . `",
    "type a ' outbursts correspond to freds and are usually interpreted as ` outside - in ' outbursts , i.e. outbursts triggered in the outer regions of the disc ( smak 1984 ) .",
    "this interpretation seems , in a few cases , consistent with the observed delay between the rise to outburst of optical and euv ( or uv ) fluxes ( warner 1995 ) . `",
    "type b ' outbursts have a more symmetric shape with a slower rise phase , and are usually interpreted as ` inside - out ' outbursts ( smak 1984 ; see also menou et al .",
    "1999a ) .    in the case of sxts , there is no observational evidence for outside - in outbursts .",
    "the delay between the rise of the optical and x - ray fluxes ( observed only during a non - fred outburst of the bh sxt gro j1655 - 40 ) _ is not _",
    "an indication of an outside - in outburst if the disc is truncated . indeed , hameury et al .",
    "( 1997a ) obtain correct rise times and the x - ray / optical delay for an inside - out outburst . in this case",
    "the ` inside ' corresponds to the inner edge of the truncated disc , far from the central object .",
    "the x - ray decay timescales @xmath24 of sxts with fred light - curves are typically 25 - 40 days ( csl ) .",
    "the optical decay timescales of bh sxts are @xmath21 50 to 200 days , while the optical decay timescales of ns sxts are @xmath21 10 to 30 days ( but the available information is poor ) .",
    "we note that long decay timescales are also observed in wz sge  type dn ( kuulkers , howell & van paradijs 1996 ; kuulkers 1998 ) .",
    "the reported duration times for the fred  type outbursts of bh sxts range from 170 to 260 days in x - rays ( and even longer in optical ) , while @xmath25 days in x - rays for fred  type outbursts of ns sxts .",
    "the typical duration time of u  gem  type dn in the sample of szkody & mattei ( 1984 ) is @xmath26 days ( optical ) .",
    "one has to remember , however , that the reported durations for sxts depend on the detection threshold of the instrument and that the coverage of some outbursts is incomplete ; sometimes the reported duration is only a lower limit on the true duration . in some cases , the decay timescale @xmath24 may be more appropriate than the duration time @xmath27 for comparison of the model predictions with the observations .",
    "an estimate of the maximum luminosity reached in outburst by a sxt depends on the distance to the system and , when compared to the eddington luminosity , on the mass of the primary .",
    "according to garcia et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , the ns sxts considered here approximately reached the eddington luminosity at outburst peak , as did some of the bh sxts . according to csl , the maximum luminosities reached are closer to 10% of the eddington luminosity , but their values could be underestimated .",
    "for example , csl obtain for nova muscae 1991 a peak luminosity ( 0.4  10 kev ) of 0.08 in eddington units , whereas according to esin et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , who used the entire available spectral information , the peak luminosity in this system was almost exactly eddington . in our view , this means that models of sxts have to be able to reach the eddington accretion rate .",
    "the eddington accretion rate is defined here as @xmath28 the rate at which an accretion flow around a central object of mass @xmath29 reaches the eddington luminosity for a standard @xmath30 radiative efficiency .",
    "the eddington luminosity , however , seems to be the maximum luminosity for sxts .",
    "combined with outburst durations this implies that the mass accreted during outbursts by the central body is @xmath21 a few @xmath31 g ( roughly the same as accreted onto the white dwarf during wz sge eruptions ) .",
    "this constraint must be satisfied by sxt models as well .",
    "observations of broadened @xmath32 emission lines provide an upper limit on the value of the disc inner radius @xmath33 in quiescence for several bh sxts ( e.g. orosz et al . 1994 ; narayan et al .",
    "1996 ; menou , narayan & lasota 1999b ) .",
    "in most systems , the constraints indicate a value of @xmath33 less than @xmath34 to a few @xmath35 , where @xmath36 cm is the schwarzschild radius of the black hole primary of mass @xmath29 .",
    "the limits provide a useful constraint on the strength of evaporation to be included in the tdims of sxts ( see below )",
    ".    for some systems , other constraints on @xmath33 exist at various stages of the outburst from the modeling of x - ray reflection properties ( ycki et al .",
    "1998 ) , as well as spectral fits which involve @xmath33 as a parameter ( e.g. sobczak et al . 1999 ) . however , these two methods are model dependent and somewhat controversial , because the relevant spectral features can be modeled differently ( m. nowak , private communication ) .",
    "we choose to ignore them here .",
    "in this section , we investigate a `` standard '' version of the tdim for sxts . as mentioned above , by  standard \" ,",
    "we mean a model with values of the viscosity parameter @xmath5 that are usually considered as standard for dn discs : @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "non - standard models , in particular models using significantly smaller values of @xmath2 , are considered in   4 .",
    "we use the numerical code described in hameury et al .",
    "( 1998 ) to simulate the evolution of discs around nss and bhs .",
    "the equations of conservation of mass , angular momentum and energy for a thin keplerian disc are solved on an adaptive grid which resolves narrow structures in the disc ( transition fronts in particular ) .",
    "a fully implicit numerical scheme is used for time evolution , to avoid any courant - type limiting condition on the timestep of integration .",
    "a grid of disc vertical structures , which give the local cooling rate of the disc as a function of its surface density , central temperature and the vertical gravity is precalculated before running the disc evolution .",
    "the effect of changing the mass of the central object ( from a ns sxt to a bh sxt ) enters the time - dependent calculations both through the radial conservation equations solved , and through the grid of vertical structures with different gravities .    the outer radius of the disc is allowed to vary with time under the action of the torque applied by the secondary star on the outermost regions of the disc .",
    "including this proper boundary condition ( as opposed to a rigid boundary condition with a fixed value of the outer radius ) has been found to drastically affect the predictions of the dim for dn discs ( see hameury et al .",
    "1998 for details ) .",
    "the effect of including this proper boundary condition for discs of sxts is discussed in   3.2.1 .      the formation of a hole in the discs of sxts is probably determined by the physics of the evaporation of gas from the disc , possibly into an adaf .",
    "this physics is poorly understood .",
    "several mechanisms have been proposed in the literature to explain the transition ( see , e.g. , meyer & meyer - hofmeister 1994 ; liu , meyer , meyer - hofmeister 1997 ; narayan & yi 1995 ; honma 1996 ; shaviv , wickramasinghe & wehrse 1999 ) , but none of these models has reached a sufficient level of detail to allow robust quantitative predictions .",
    "disc evaporation has already been included in the calculations of hameury et al .",
    "( 1997a ) and hameury et al .",
    "( 1999a ) . in these studies ,",
    "a ` reasonable ' formula was used ( close to the one proposed by meyer & meyer - hofmeister 1994 ) and evaporation was included in the numerical models as a sink of matter in the mass conservation equation ( see also the models with evaporation of cannizzo 1998 ) .    here , we chose a slightly different approach .",
    "we assume an _ ad hoc _",
    "law for the rate of evaporation as a function of radius , as in hameury et al .",
    "( 1997a ; 1999a ) , but in addition we assume that evaporation acts only in a very narrow region at the inner edge of the disc .",
    "this is a good approximation if the rate of evaporation of the disc material is a steep function of radius .    to be more specific",
    ", the inner radius of the disc , @xmath33 , varies according to : @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the time - dependent accretion rate at the inner edge @xmath33 of the disc , and @xmath39 is the evaporation law with an arbitrary functional form .",
    "this evaporation law is chosen so that , in outburst , @xmath39 is much less than the accretion rate in the disc at any radius , and the disc is fully extended .",
    "the radius of truncation of the disc in quiescence depends on the functional form of @xmath39 and the profile of @xmath40 in the disc .",
    "we find that this numerical recipe is much more stable than that used in hameury et al .",
    "( 1997a ) , while it gives very similar results for the evolution of @xmath33 and the outburst cycles in general .    following hameury et al .",
    "( 1997a ) , we could have assumed that the disc is evaporated into an adaf which accretes everywhere at the maximum rate allowed , @xmath41 , and take for the evaporation law @xmath42 .",
    "recently , however , the estimates of @xmath41 have been revised to higher values ( esin et al .",
    "1997 ; menou et al .",
    "using these recent estimates for the evaporation law ( i.e. a stronger evaporation than , e.g. , in hameury et al .",
    "1997a ) would imply that truncated discs are globally stable ( and stationary ) for all mass transfer rates below @xmath43 g s@xmath44 ( this is demonstrated by the fig .  5 of menou et al .",
    "1999b ) , whereas typical sxt mass  transfer rates are much lower : @xmath45 g s@xmath44 ( van paradijs 1996 ; csl ; menou et al .",
    "in addition , for mass transfer rates @xmath46 g s@xmath44 , the stable discs would be truncated at radii @xmath47 @xmath48 , which is inconsistent with the upper limits derived from @xmath32 emission lines (   2.2 ) .    to circumvent these difficulties , and",
    "ensure that discs in our models experience outbursts even at lower mass transfer rates , @xmath39 must be less than @xmath49 .",
    "we use the following evaporation law : @xmath50 where @xmath51 is a constant ensuring that a maximally truncated disc is still unstable .",
    "the power laws and scalings in eq .",
    "( 3 ) are such that the profile of @xmath39 is initially slowly decreasing with radius , and then decreases much more steeply beyond a radius @xmath52 . in all the models with evaporation described below , we take @xmath53 ( except in section 4.1 , in which @xmath54 ) .",
    "this corresponds to a situation where the evaporation rate during quiescence is significantly smaller than the mass transfer rate from the secondary , thus ensuring that the disc is not marginally unstable .",
    "this expression for the evaporation law is _ ad hoc _ but possesses several advantages .",
    "first , it is a continuously decreasing function of radius , which seems quite natural , and is appropriate for the numerical implementation of evaporation described above .",
    "second , the maximum value of @xmath55 , as defined in eq .",
    "( [ eq : defmdotevap ] ) when @xmath56 , is consistent with the high value required in the adaf models of esin et al .",
    "( 1997 ) to fit the high luminosity states of the bh sxt nova muscae 91 .",
    "third , it leads to disc truncation radii in quiescence which are smaller than the upper limits inferred from the broadening of @xmath32 emission lines .",
    "the resulting discs are unsteady and experience limit cycles for reasonable mass transfer rates ( @xmath57 g s@xmath44 ) , as required for the dim to be the explanation of sxt outbursts .",
    "naturally , one could worry that the predictions of the time - dependent models depend on the evaporation law used .",
    "this is true about the strength of evaporation , but we find that our conclusions do not crucially depend on the precise shape of the evaporation law .",
    "we discuss the effects of changing the evaporation law on the model predictions in   5 .",
    "note that in the models presented here , the presence of a tenuous region in the inner accretion flow , presumably an adaf , is only taken into account through disc evaporation ( i.e. as a sink of mass ) : we neglect any other physical effect that this inner region of the accretion flow could have on the disc evolution .",
    "disc irradiation by the central x - ray source during high luminosity states is also neglected , although it is a potentially important effect ( see   5 for a discussion ) . for simplicity",

    ", we will assume for simplicity that the x - ray emission from the system is proportional to the accretion rate @xmath69 at the inner edge of the disc .",
    "the real situation is likely to be more complicated , in particular if some of the x - rays observed are emitted by an adaf whose luminosity is not simply proportional to @xmath70 ( in that case , the timescales could be even shorter because the radiative efficiency increases with @xmath70 ) .",
    "similarly , the v magnitude shown are not supposed to directly represent the v magnitude observable from a system but only the intrinsic optical luminosity variations of the disc . in observed systems ,",
    "the v band magnitude emission has also contributions from the secondary , from reprocessing of x - ray photons by the disc and possibly from an adaf .",

    "the recurrence time in the model of aql x-1 is @xmath76 year , in very good agreement with the know recurrence time .      during quiescence ,",
    "all of the accreted mass is processed through the adaf and is therefore evaporated , so that the mass accretion rate shown in figs . 1 and 5 is the actual evaporation rate except when the disc radius reaches its minimum value during outbursts . as can be seen , the evaporation rate remains significantly smaller than the mass transfer rate from the secondary , varying between 0.15 and 0.60 @xmath77 in the case of the a0620 - 00 model , and between 0.10 and 0.15 @xmath77 in the aql x-1 case .",
    "these are close to the maximum evaporation rate for which the disc is unstable but they do not imply fine tuning .      in the model of a0620 - 00 , once an outburst is triggered , it takes the disc @xmath78 days to reach the compact object ( the time required to go from @xmath79 cm to @xmath80 cm , not included in our simulations , is small because of the short timescales in the inner disc , so that we neglect it ) .",
    "it also takes @xmath81 days for the accretion rate at the disc inner edge to reach its maximum value .",

    "it also takes @xmath87 days for the accretion rate at the disc inner edge to reach its maximum value .",

    "[ fig : a0620outburst ] ( see   5 for a discussion )    one should keep in mind that we did not take into account outer disc x  ray irradiation",

    "the total accreted mass is comparable to what is deduced from the observations in the case of aql x-1 .",
    "again , this is not a surprise since the recurrence time is about right .",
    "a striking feature of the models described here is the possible occurrence of reflares during the decline of an outburst ( fig .",
    "[ [ fig : a0620outburst ] ] ) .",
    "these reflares correspond to multiple reflections of cooling and heating fronts during their propagation in the disc . for the specified set of parameters",
    ", we find that they are present in models with a bh primary , but absent when the primary is a ns .",
    "the number of reflares is reduced when the disc is truncated because increasing the inner disc radius gradually removes the regions of the disc where reflections occur .",
    "reflares are in fact a natural outcome of the dim .",
    "they have been observed in many simulations over the years , in particular in models of dn discs in which a same value @xmath101 was used ( e.g. smak 1984 ) . in that case , a cooling front develops , propagates over some fraction of the disc radial extent , is reflected into a heating front which goes back all the way up to the disc outer edge .",
    "this is repeated indefinitely and leads to small amplitude variations of the disc luminosity .",
    "this failure of the model has been overcome by using a higher value of @xmath5 for the hot ionized disc than for the cold neutral disc , which results in large amplitude outbursts as those observed .",
    "the fundamental reason why a reflare occurs is because the surface density just behind a cooling front reaches the critical value @xmath74 sometime during its propagation .",
    "this happens typically when the front is located at @xmath102  cm in our simulations .",
    "an outward propagating heating front then appears which destroys the inner cooling front as mass starts being accreted efficiently in the cooling region .",
    "later on , this heating front is reflected when the surface density just behind the front reaches the critical value @xmath73 .",
    "a cooling front develops which shuts off the outward transport of angular momentum at the origin of the heating front propagation .",
    "a sequence of heating and cooling front reflections corresponds to the multiple reflares observed in the simulations .",
    "what was probably not previously realized is that the occurrence of reflares depends not only on the values of @xmath5 but also on the mass of the central object , as shown by our simulations .",
    "we note that reflares were also found in the simulations of the decline phase of bh sxt outbursts of cannizzo , chen & livio ( 1995 ) .",
    "cannizzo et al .",
    "interpreted the reflares as numerical artifacts .",
    "this is not the case in our models : reflares are a generic property of the dim and the tdim for some range of masses and viscosity parameters .",

    "therefore , @xmath105 behind the front is constant with time and equal to @xmath106 , where @xmath107 depends on the viscosity parameter @xmath5 and the mass of the accreting object @xmath29 . according to the disc models of menou et al .",

    "the recurrence times are also increased if the mass transfer rate @xmath121 in the model is reduced , since more time is then needed to accumulate mass in the disc up to the critical surface density @xmath74 at which the next outburst is triggered .",
    "an exploration of the parameter space of the models shows that it is not possible , however , to reproduce recurrence times of ten to tens of years in tdims with ` standard ' values of @xmath5 .",
    "this is because to obtain these long recurrence times , the increase in the strength of evaporation or the reduction of @xmath121 required lead to globally stable discs .    to demonstrate this , we computed a series of models of ns and bh sxts with fixed values of @xmath33 .",
    "the various values of @xmath33 are equivalent to various strengths of disc evaporation .",
    "for example , a model with parameters relevant for a0620 - 00 , with a fixed value of @xmath122 cm and @xmath123 g s@xmath44 has a recurrence time @xmath124 years .",

    ", this critical value of @xmath33 corresponds to recurrence times well below ten to tens of years .",
    "it is possible to adjust the inner disc radius so that the recurrence time will be arbitrary long ( see e.g. the two upper points in the lower panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : trec ] ) but the resulting disc is marginally stable . keeping it in this state for the entire quiescence period requires a mass - transfer rate @xmath121 strictly constant , which is clearly unrealistic .",
    "this result on short recurrence times is confirmed by an analytical estimate of the recurrence times of sxts .",
    "an outburst starts when the surface density reaches the critical value @xmath74 . in the case of outside - in (",
    "type a ) outbursts , this happens when enough mass has accumulated at the disc outer edge . if the accumulation time at the outer edge is longer than the viscous time ( as it is the case for low accretion rates ) , matter transferred from the secondary diffuses inwards and accumulates at shorter radii , giving rise to an inside - out ( type b ) outburst .",
    "since , for a given set of parameters , the recurrence time of a type a outburst is shorter than the corresponding time for a type b outburst ( @xmath131 ) , we consider here only type b outbursts ( in any case the only type obtained in our models ) .",
    "following smak ( 1993 ) , the recurrence time of a type b outburst is @xmath132 which is the characteristic growth - time of a surface density contrast . from the standard diffusion equation describing the evolution of @xmath133 ,",

    "it also suggests that one way to obtain long enough recurrence times is to reduce the value of @xmath144 .",
    "interestingly , we expect the maximum accretion rate reached by the disc during outburst to increase as well if @xmath2 is reduced .",

    "the ratio @xmath152 is indeed increased from 7 to @xmath153 when @xmath2 is reduced from 0.02 to @xmath147 ( for the same @xmath4 ) , which makes it more difficult for the post - cooling - front surface density to reach @xmath74 and trigger a reflare .    the total duration of an outburst predicted in the model with @xmath154 is @xmath155 days ( similar in optical and x - rays ) .",

    "bumps and mini - outbursts are more heterogeneous classes of features but it is difficult to find in the csl compilation a light ",
    "curve morphology similar to the one seen in fig .",
    "( [ fig : a0620outburst ] ) .",
    "the reflares are only present in models with @xmath171 , i.e. in models with recurrence times too short to correspond to the observations .",
    "it is , therefore , a success of the model that the set of parameters ensuring both long recurrence times and absence of unobserved reflares are consistent .",
    "some of the observed reflares may be due to disc irradiation ( g. dubus , private comm .",
    "1999 ) , which means that this effect has to be included before any detailed model of sxt with reflares can be constructed .",
    "the fact that , in our simulations , reflares occur only when the mass of the accreting compact object is several @xmath172 ( the boundary being @xmath173 for standard values of @xmath5 ) is interesting because it is apparently consistent with the fact that reflares have been observed only in sxts containing bhs , and not in sxts containing nss ( e.g. csl ) .",
    "however , since our reflares are different from the observed ones and absent in the favoured model , this might be a coincidence .",
    "on the other hand , since a complete , self - consistent model of x  ray transients is still to be constructed it could be useful to keep in mind this property differentiating neutron star from black holes .    by using the strongest evaporation compatible with existing upper limits on the value of @xmath33 in quiescent bh sxts ,",
    "we tested if evaporation alone can be responsible for the long recurrence times of sxts , or if very small values of @xmath2 in their quiescent discs are also required .",
    "our calculations in ",
    "3.2.7 show that a strong evaporation is not sufficient , and that either a viscosity parameter @xmath2 at the level of @xmath174 is required to reach agreement with recurrence times of tens of years , or that disc outbursts must be drastically affected by x - ray illumination of the disc .",
    "the very low values of @xmath2 required to model bh sxts would suggest that more than one viscosity mechanism drives accretion in the disc .",
    "the viscosity in the hot state arises probably from a well developed mhd turbulence with a universal viscosity parameter @xmath175 .",
    "the much lower value of @xmath5 in quiescent discs is consistent with the disappearance of mhd turbulence in quiescent discs proposed by gammie & menou ( 1998 ) ( see also meyer & meyer - hofmeister 1999 ) .",
    "we note that if the relevant mechanisms in quiescence were non - local in nature , the use of a local @xmath6prescription would be questionable and a major revision of the dim might be required .",
    "in this paper , we investigated the effect of disc evaporation on the predictions of the dim for sxts .",
    "as for dn discs , we show that the effect of allowing the disc outer radius @xmath71 to vary with time is crucial to obtain robust predictions for the outburst cycles .",
    "we use the strongest evaporation still compatible with available upper limits on the value of the disc inner radius in quiescent bh sxts to test if evaporation alone can be responsible for the long recurrence times of sxts .",
    "we find that such a strong evaporation does increase the recurrence times predicted ( in agreement with earlier calculations by cannizzo 1998 ) , but is not sufficient to reproduce the longest known recurrence times of sxts when standard values of the viscosity parameter @xmath5 are used in the disc ( @xmath0 , @xmath1 ) .",
    "we show that models with strong evaporation and a significantly smaller value of @xmath2 ( @xmath21 a few @xmath176 ) do reproduce the long recurrence times of tens of years of bh sxts , as well as the high x - ray luminosities reached by these systems in outburst",
    ". the value of @xmath144 needed to reproduce the long recurrence times would be even smaller if evaporation was weaker than what we assumed .",
    "another possibility is of course that x - ray illumination drastically alters the outburst cycle .",
    "we defer the examination of this effect to a future work .",
    "we argue that the requirement for a smaller value of @xmath2 in at least some sxts is consistent with the disappearance of mhd turbulence in quiescent discs ( gammie & menou 1998 ) and suggests that another mechanism , perhaps non - local , could be responsible for accretion in the disc during this low luminosity phase .",
    "finally , since the version of the dim used in this paper fails to reproduce several important properties of sxts ( such as duration and shape of the light - curve ) , future work must include in the model the observed missing ingredient : x  ray irradiation of the disc .",
