    "much work has been done in studying the quantum behavior of low mass ( @xmath3 ) scalar fields in de sitter space ( ds ) . in the inflationary paradigm ,",
    "quantum perturbations of these scalar fields give rise to the large scale structure that we see in the universe today .",
    "comparatively less attention has been paid to massive fields with @xmath4 . clearly in the limit of very large mass or vanishing hubble rate",
    ", one should recover the flat space answer .",
    "recently , however , krotov and polyakov @xcite analyzed the correlation functions of these massive fields and found a surprising result .",
    "they found that in the poincar patch , the keldysh propagator @xmath5 at 1-loop receives a 1-loop logarithmic correction f(k , ) f^0(k , ) ( 1 + k ) , where @xmath6 is the tree level propagator , @xmath7 is the spatial momenta and @xmath8 is the conformal time .",
    "the loop correction naively diverges at late times @xmath9 , which naively suggests a breakdown of perturbation theory .",
    "this 1-loop diagram had been analyzed before by marolf and morrison @xcite working on the sphere and analytically continuing to obtain the result in de sitter space . by resuming all the 1pi diagrams they argued that this logarithmic correction actually corresponds to an imaginary shift to the mass + iwhere @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the hubble constant and @xmath12 is the number of spatial dimensions . in real space ,",
    "the main effect of the resummation is to make the propagator decay faster at large distance g(z ) ( a z^i + b z^-i ) , where @xmath13 is the geodesic distance , @xmath14 are specific coefficients and @xmath15 will turn out to be real and negative .    in this paper",
    "we perform a resummation of the diagrams directly in lorentzian signature .",
    "we find that it is possible to resum all the bubble diagrams to show that the 1-loop answer indeed leads to a ( time independent ) imaginary shift of the mass .",
    "the resummation is performed by consistently solving the schwinger - dyson equations for the system using an ansatz for the full resummed propagators . in the case of the retarded propagator we directly carry out the resummation of all bubble diagrams and",
    "show that the result is in agreement with the solution of the schwinger - dyson equations .",
    "we also argue that the same imaginary contribution can be found for quartic interactions . for low mass fields ,",
    "very similar logs appear and these have already been resummed using a variety of techniques ( for recent work see @xcite ) .",
    "our computations are all done in the poincar patch of de sitter and our resummation agrees with the 1pi resummation on the sphere @xcite confirming that the two computations are equivalent @xcite .",
    "we note that this phenomenon may be related to another fact : interacting massive fields in the principal series ( @xmath16 ) appear to be fundamentally unstable .",
    "since conservation of energy does not hold in ds , it is possible for a particle to duplicate itself or even decay into heavier ones @xcite .",
    "interestingly this is only true when @xmath0 .    to our knowledge the computation of this decay rate",
    "was first done by bros , esptein and moschella in a series of papers @xcite ( see also @xcite ) . in these papers",
    ", they computed the _ tree level _ decay rate for a scalar field of mass @xmath17 with cubic interaction @xmath18 .",
    "in flat space , the decay rate is exactly zero simply because of kinematics . in de sitter space",
    ", however , they found that there is a non - zero but exponentially small decay rate ( for the principal series ) .",
    "this is a reflection of the energy non - conservation which opens up new decay channels . in our case",
    ", we have found an imaginary shift in the mass , and it is plausible to relate this to the decay rate found by @xcite .",
    "we compute explicitly the decay rate ( aka imaginary part to self - energy ) and we show that it goes to zero roughly as @xmath19 in the large mass , low @xmath11 limit where the exponent @xmath20 depends on the number of dimensions .",
    "the decay rate goes to zero very fast in the large @xmath2 limit and the flat space answer is recovered .",
    "the decay of the higgs ( say with @xmath21 ) in our universe today ( with @xmath22 ) is obviously very small .",
    "for @xmath23 the decay rate reaches a finite value of order @xmath24 .",
    "this paper is organised as follows .",
    "we set up the problem in section   [ setup ] and compute the 1-loop contribution in section   [ explicit ] for all propagators .",
    "we then proceed to resum using two different methods in section   [ resum ] .",
    "finally , the decay rate is explicitly evaluated in section   [ decay ] .",
    "in an appendix at the end , we show how a field with quartic interaction will have similar loop corrections .",
    "we are interested in calculating in - in correlation functions .",
    "q(t ) = | u^q u |in where the evolution operators are @xmath25 we take @xmath26 where the sign must be chosen accordingly to select free vacua in the far past and @xmath27 is the hamiltonian in the interaction picture",
    ". one can compute the 1-loop contribution by directly expanding the evolution operator to the desired order .",
    "for the purpose of resummation , we find it useful to use feynman rules that can be obtained by doubling the number of fields in the keldysh - schwinger formalism .",
    "for a scalar field with non - derivative interactions of the form h_i(t ) = d^3x _ n , the feynman rules are well known . in the context of cosmology where the metric depends on time",

    "also we have included the time reversed diagram for @xmath91 which amounts to an extra factor of 2 and there is a symmetry factor of @xmath95 for both diagrams .",
    "now both @xmath91 and @xmath92 are real and they lead to an imaginary shift to the mass .",
    "it is worth pointing out that the sum of the two terms does not contain a divergence of the type @xmath96 due to the identity [ ff ] 4 j^ff - j^gg =(    similar structure .",
    "we expand the keldysh propagator in the last leg as before and the final result is f^(0 + 1 ) ( q,_1,_2 ) = f^0(q,_1,_2 ) , with [ sigma1 ] _ 1 & = & , adding all the contributions together and writing @xmath97 , we get f^(0 + 1 ) ( q,_1,_2 ) = f^0(q,_1,_2 ) , using the properties of the integrals @xmath98 , @xmath99 and @xmath100 in eq .",

    "therefore the full answer is just f^(0 + 1 ) ( q,_1,_2 ) = f^0(q,_1,_2)(1- _ 1 ) and @xmath101 is the imaginary shift to the mass .",
    "it is exactly equal to the shift we found for the retarded propagator in eq .",
    "( [ sigma ] ) .",
    "in the last section we computed the 1-loop contribution to the retarded and to the keldysh propagators in @xmath102 theory .",
    "we found that the result contains a potentially large logarithm that is either a ratio of two times or a ratio of the latest time to the external momenta . in order to obtain this result we had to assume that @xmath103 or that @xmath104 and the logarithmic contributions are then dominant and large .",
    "these large logs cause trouble as they naively signal a breakdown of perturbation theory at late time . to address this problem , we will now resum these 1-loop logarithms by using two different methods , both of which give the same result which is finite and well behaved at late times @xmath105 .",
    "the resummation technique demonstrates that the 1-loop contribution resums to a time independent ( in this case imaginary ) shift to the mass .",
    "indeed , if one performs this computation by wick rotating to the sphere as in @xcite , there is no logarithmic time dependence and the 1-loop simply gives a finite contribution to the self - energy which shifts the mass .",
    "so the results of our resummation shows clearly that the same answer is obtained using the in - in formalism in the poincar patch versus using the sphere . on the other hand , our resummation methods",
    "can easily be extended to non - equilibrium situations that may not be captured by a computation on the sphere ; for example global de sitter space @xcite or an unstable vacuum ( as opposed to the bunch - davies vacuum ) .    in the case of the retarded propagator",
    "we are in a fortunate situation because there is only one diagram at 1-loop and therefore it is a simple matter to resum .",
    "large infrared logarithms have been argued to be well captured by the classical approximation ( see for example @xcite ) or by semi - classical methods such as the stochastic approach @xcite ( see also @xcite ) . here",
    "are two different ways to resum the 1-loop correction to the retarded propagator where the errors are easily quantifiable and the next order correction is in principle calculable .    1 .   in the first method we will set - up a schwinger - dyson like non - perturbative equation and solve it by making an ansatz for the 1-loop exact retarded propagator .",
    "2 .   in the second method",
    "we explicitly compute the @xmath106loop bubble diagrams and we resum them all ( this is for the retarded propagator )",
    ".    it would also be interesting to use dynamical renormalization group methods ( see @xcite and @xcite for some applications in cosmology ) to perform the resummation but we leave this to further work .      considering only the bubble diagram , it is simple to set - up a non - perturbative equation for the fully resummed propagator a la schwinger - dyson ( see fig .",

    "we have shown that one can consistently solve the schwinger - dyson equation by shifting the mass by an imaginary component .",

    "many other resummation techniques could be used and it is worthwhile to explore them . from the schwinger - dyson equations , one can set - up a boltzman kinetic equation .",
    "alternatively , stochastic techniques @xcite or dynamical renormalization group techniques @xcite could also prove to be very useful .",
    "our results give additional support to the statement that interacting massive fields with @xmath0 in de sitter space are fundamentally unstable to decay .",
    "the reader may worry about the interpretation of this imaginary shift to the mass as a decay rate given that in de sitter , there is no well defined notion of particles and the s - matrix is an ill defined quantity ( the jost vacua of @xcite  see also @xcite is the exception to this statement ) .",
    "in fact there is no contradiction as a decay rate is not an in / out quantity .",
    "one can never take a fundamentally unstable particle to @xmath143 to prepare an initial state .",
    "an unstable particle is not really a particle , it is a resonance .",
    "if one take the large mass limit of the resummed propagator in ds one recovers the flat space answer and clearly our imaginary shift to the mass then lead to the usual breit - wigner resonance .",
    "our notion of decay rate differs from the one used in @xcite where they are looking for time dependence in correlation functions ( in particular , they are looking for decay of the vacua to some other state ) .",
    "the case of conformally coupled scalar with cubic interactions was recently examined in @xcite . in that paper , they both found a time dependent anomalous dimensions and a decay rate .",
    "for the quartic potential , they find no such decay rate .",
    "again to contrast , we have examined the case of a massive field in the principal series which is perturbatively stable for cubic or quartic interactions but both cases show an imaginary contribution to the self - energy which we interpret as a decay rate .",
    "the case of global de sitter is very interesting .",
    "krotov and polyakov also computed the 1-loop diagram in global de sitter .",
    "they argued that the euclidean theory does not correctly capture the physics in this case .",
    "as global de sitter can roughly be viewed as two copies of poincar , the result for the 1-loop is very similar [ global ] f(k , ) f(k,)^0 ( 1 + ) where @xmath144 is the time at which one turns on the interaction in the lower ( contracting ) poincar patch .",
    "this result was obtained in the approximation that @xmath145 .",
    "this loop contribution does not seem to simply resum to a shift in the mass and may be a signal of more interesting dynamics .",
    "in fact , krotov and polyakov argue for a decay of vacuum energy along the line of @xcite ( see also@xcite and @xcite for similar claims ) .",
    "we however note that the result of @xcite is only valid for @xmath146 which appears to imply that there is no large logarithm in this case .",
    "recently , marolf and morrison @xcite have examined the question of what happens at late time and they found that the full propagator approaches the euclidean one .",
    "this is in agreement with the proof of ir stability on the sphere to all order by hollands @xcite and marolf and morrison @xcite ( see @xcite for a discussion of the massless case )",
    ". it would be interesting to see if our methods could be applied to this case to find a better result for the propagator .",
    "finally , we gave an explicit formula for the decay rate .",
    "it is suppressed by the boltzman factor at large mass @xmath147 but it reaches a finite value of order @xmath148 when @xmath149 .",
    "this is in agreement with the tree level results of @xcite .",
    "it is tempting to interpret this decay as coming from the  thermal \" nature of de sitter . in this interpretation ,",
    "fields with @xmath150 have a compton wavelength smaller than a hubble patch and one can use the static coordinate to describe them . in this system of coordinates , the bunch - davies vacua looks thermal and one can naively steal energy from the heat bath to open new decay channels .",
    "this intuition is not borne out by analog computation in thermal field theory ( see @xcite ) . while there is in general an imaginary part to the self - energy at finite temperature and energy can be taken from heat bath",
    ", the process of a massive fields with @xmath151 self - duplicating themselves does not occur .",
    "we reiterate that this imaginary part only shows up when the mass goes above the upper bound m^2 < . below this",
    "bound the self - energy is real and there is no decay rate ( see for example @xcite ) .",
    "this bound is of course very similar to the well - known breitenlohner - freedman @xcite bound in anti - de sitter @xmath152 .",
    "the de sitter analog was proposed by skenderis and townsend @xcite using arguments from fake supersymmetry .",
    "when one attempts to define a holographic ds / cft correspondence ( see for example @xcite and references therein ) , fields with mass above this bound are the  harder \" case to interpret .",
    "the conformal weight of these fields living on the boundary are imaginary pointing to a non - unitary cft . here",
    ", we see that when interactions are turned on , the fields now decay even faster at large distances",
    ". it would be interesting to work out the implications of this decay rate for ds / cft .",
    "finally , beside these very theoretical questions , this decay rate could have practical implications for the phenomenology of inflationary theories .",
    "fields with @xmath23 could be present during inflation and they could have an effect on the spectrum of perturbations .",
    "for example , in the model of quasi - single field inflation @xcite , oscillations of a massive field lead to features in the power spectrum . in @xcite ,",
    "the authors restricted themselves to @xmath153 but still less than @xmath154 and it would be interesting to see what changes if the mass is above this bound .",
    "another change to the physics may occur when integrating out massive fields to get the effective action at the inflationary scale .",
    "this is usually done as in flat space , or at the very least neglecting interactions ( see @xcite for a recent analysis ) .",
    "integrating out massive fields with this new modified propagator may affect the quantum corrections in the effective action .",
