    "h ( also known as lb 1727 ) is a radio - quiet ( 8.4 ghz flux @xmath03 mjy ; brissenden 1987 ) seyfert galaxy at a redshift z@xmath00.104 .",
    "optical spectra from the aat ( turner 1999 ) and eso ( guainazzi  1998 ) showed h  to be a typical broad line seyfert 1 with a strong big blue bump ( bbb ) .",
    "it has been widely studied at x - ray energies and found to exhibit an unusual degree of spectral variability .",
    "a short pn - camera observation early in the  programme reported a ` typical ' seyfert 1 x - ray spectrum with a power law of photon index @xmath1@xmath01.9 together with a strong soft excess ( page  2002 ) . using the h@xmath2 line width from grupe  ( 2004 ) and the relationship with black hole mass of kaspi ( 2000 )",
    ", we estimate a supermassive black hole ( smbh ) of @xmath3@xmath4 .",
    "the [ oiii ] 5007  line width measure of the stellar velocity dispersion ( nelson 2000 ) gives a very similar figure .    to improve the x - ray data on h  a new series of 5  observations was carried out , at approximately 3-monthly intervals over the period september 2002 to september 2003 .",
    "the first of those new observations , when h  was found to be in an extremely faint state , has been reported in pounds  ( 2004 ) ; hereafter paper 1 .",
    "three points of particular note resulting from that first new  observation of h  were : ( 1 ) an unusually hard ( flat ) power law fit ( @xmath1@xmath01.0 ) to the epic data over the 210 kev band also exhibited curvature indicative of an extreme relativistic fe k emission line or partial covering of the continuum by a substantial column of ` cold ' gas ; ( 2 ) although the rgs features were faint , the unambiguous detection of emission lines of ovii and oviii provided clear evidence for an extended region of photo - ionised gas in the nucleus of h ; ( 3 ) a comparison of the raw epic data with data obtained in december 2000 , when h  was considerably brighter in the x - ray band , showed that the large - scale spectral variability in could be described by a variable , steep ( @xmath1@xmath02.5 ) power law component .    in the present paper we analyse the remaining 4 observations from the new  campaign ( in december 2002 , march , june and september 2003 ) , which together explore the x - ray spectrum of h  over a range of flux states lying between the extremes of december 2000 and september 2002",
    "the new observations took place on 27 december 2002 ( orbit 558 ) , 30 march ( orbit 605 ) , 25 june ( orbit 649 ) and 16 september ( orbit 690 ) in 2003 , with on - target exposures of @xmath010.2 ksec , @xmath013.9 ksec , @xmath013.1 ksec and @xmath013.9 ksec , respectively .",
    "x - ray data were available throughout each observation from the epic pn ( strder  2001 ) and mos ( turner  2001 ) cameras , and the reflection grating spectrometer / rgs ( den herder  2001 ) . these new data add to the earlier  observations of h  on 4 december 2000 ( orbit 181 ) and 5 september 2002 ( orbit 512 ) when the source was found to be in historically high and low flux states , respectively .",
    "those earlier observations have been reported in page  ( 2002 ) and in paper 1 .",
    "epic data were initially screened with the xmm sas v5.4 software and events corresponding to patterns 0 - 4 ( single and double pixel events ) were selected for the pn data and patterns 0 - 12 for mos1 and mos2 , the latter then being combined .",
    "a low energy cut of 300 ev was applied to all epic data and known hot or bad pixels were removed .",
    "source counts were obtained from a circular region of 45  radius centred on h , with the background being taken from a similar region offset from , but close to , the source .",
    "the x - ray light curve of h  was essentially flat throughout each observation and the background rate was low ( except in orbit 558 , when noisy data were edited out ) .",
    "we therefore integrated each data set for spectral analysis .",
    "individual epic spectra were binned to a minimum of 100 counts per energy bin to facilitate use of the @xmath5 minimalisation technique in spectral fitting and ensure adequate statistics in the 510 kev band .",
    "spectral fitting was based on the xspec package ( arnaud 1996 ) and all fits included absorption due to the line - of - sight galactic column @xmath6 .",
    "errors are quoted at the 90% confidence level ( @xmath7 for one interesting parameter ) .",
    "we were fortunate to observe h  in widely differing flux states , ranging conveniently between the low and high flux state extremes reported previously .",
    "figure 1 shows the background - subtracted ( pn camera ) spectral data for all 6 observations , compared with a mean power law fit ( at 210 kev ) of @xmath1=1.73 .",
    "the plot shows very clearly that the largest flux variation occurs in the soft x - ray band , with all spectra converging above @xmath05 kev .",
    "the only significance we would claim for the mean power law fit is in the spectral index being close to the ` canonical ' value for seyfert 1 galaxies ( for fits excluding reflection , nandra and pounds 1994 ) , suggesting that this unusually variable agn has an @xmath8 x - ray spectrum typical of the class . retaining our previous descriptions of the orbit 181 and 512 data as , respectively , ` high ' and ` low ' flux states , we now define orbit 558 as ` mid - low ' , orbit 605 as ` mid - high ' and group orbits 649 and 690 together to give a well - defined ` intermediate ' flux state spectrum .    in the following analysis spectral parameters are quoted in the rest frame of h , while figures ( except fig.10 ) retain the observed photon energy scale . in general we have fitted the pn and mos data simultaneously , with only the power law parameters untied , reflecting the well - known systematic difference in deduced continuum slopes .",
    "we began the epic spectral analysis in the conventional way by fitting a power law over the hard x - ray ( 210 kev ) band , aiming thereby to minimise the effects of soft x - ray emission and/or low energy absorption .",
    "this fit yielded a photon index of @xmath1=1.60@xmath90.01 ( pn ) and @xmath1=1.55@xmath90.02 ( mos ) .",
    "statistically , the simple power law fit was quite good , with @xmath10 of 393 for 357 degrees of freedom ( dof ) .",
    "the most obvious residual spectral feature is a weak emission line observed just below @xmath06 kev ( figure 2a ) .",
    "the addition of a gaussian emission line improved the fit ( to @xmath10 = 373/353 dof ) , with a line energy ( in the agn rest - frame ) of 6.25@xmath90.12 kev , rms width @xmath11=320@xmath9150 ev , flux = 1.5@xmath90.6@xmath12  ph s@xmath13 @xmath14 , and ew = 100@xmath940 ev .    extending this spectral fit to 0.3 kev revealed the strong excess below @xmath01 kev ( figure 2b ) .",
    "the addition of blackbody components of kt @xmath0110 ev and kt @xmath0250 ev modelled the soft excess quite well , but it was necessary to add ( ad hoc ) absorption edges at @xmath00.62 kev ( @xmath15@xmath00.22 ) , @xmath00.74 kev ( @xmath15@xmath00.26 ) and @xmath00.90 kev ( @xmath15@xmath00.10 ) to achieve a statistically acceptable fit ( @xmath10 = 825/783 dof ) .",
    "figure 3 reproduces this ` conventional ' fit to the intermediate flux level data for h , which we note has model parameters typical for a luminous seyfert 1 galaxy .",
    "the above spectral fitting allowed the mean x - ray fluxes of the intermediate state spectrum of h  to be determined .",
    "these were : @xmath16  erg s@xmath13 @xmath14 ( 0.31 kev ) , @xmath17  erg s@xmath13 @xmath14 ( 12 kev ) , and @xmath18  erg s@xmath13 @xmath14 ( 210 kev ) .",
    "combining these fluxes yields an ` intermediate state ' 0.310 kev luminosity for h  of @xmath19  erg s@xmath13 ( @xmath20  kms@xmath13mpc@xmath13 ) .",
    "our main aim in the present study is to better understand the large scale spectral variability of h  - and thereby of agn more generally . in paper 1",
    "we found that the difference spectrum between high and low state epic pn data ( the high flux difference spectrum ) could be well fitted by a power law of @xmath1@xmath02.5 , steepening to @xmath02.7 above @xmath02 kev .",
    "this simple fit suggested that the low state spectrum ( hard power law plus soft excess ) might represent a non - varying ` core ' emission , leaving the main spectral change to be represented by the variable flux power law component . to further explore that possibility we now re - analyse the new intermediate flux state epic data , after subtracting the september 2002 data , to yield the intermediate state difference spectrum .",
    "we find the resulting intermediate state difference spectrum is similar to the high state difference spectrum , with a mean 0.3 - 10 kev power law index of @xmath1@xmath02.41 ( pn ) , steepening to @xmath02.85 when fitted above @xmath02 kev .",
    "however , the fit is much less good ( @xmath10 = 1174/799 dof ) , due to a broad deficit of flux at @xmath00.51 kev ( figure 4a ) .",
    "if the large - scale spectral variability in h  is indeed well modelled by a steep , variable flux power law , as proposed in our previous analysis of the high state difference spectrum ( paper 1 ) , the new data suggest the variable emission component is modified by absorption in intermediate flux states . to model that possibility",
    "we then compared the intermediate state difference spectrum with a power law plus a photoionised absorber , represented by xstar ( kallman  1996 ) . here",
    ", the absorption is compared with a grid of ionised absorbers , with column density , ionisation parameter @xmath21(= @xmath22 , where n is the gas density at a distance r from the ionising source of luminosity l ) and outflow ( or inflow ) velocity as variable parameters . all abundant elements from c to fe are included , with the relative abundances as further variable parameters .",
    "the resulting fit was good ( @xmath10 of 839/790 ) , with a column density @xmath23@xmath0@xmath24 of low ionisation gas ( log@xmath21=-1.7@xmath90.4 ) .",
    "the relative abundances of the key elements , of c , n , o , ne , mg and fe , were 0.7 , 0.9 , 0.20 , 0.75 , 1.0 and 1.0 , though only o , ne and fe were well constrained in the fit .",
    "this best fit was obtained with a redshift of 0.1@xmath90.005 , implying the substantial column of ` cold ' absorbing gas is local to h. the power law slopes in the fit increased to @xmath1@xmath02.8 ( pn ) and @xmath1@xmath02.7 ( mos ) , while still leaving a further spectral steepening above @xmath03 kev ( figure 4c ) .",
    "figure 4b illustrates the relevant xstar model , where the absorption structure is dominated by continuum absorption , in increasing photon energy , of c , o , fe and ne .      in the above spectral fit we assumed the variable emission component in h  has the form of a power law .",
    "a similar conclusion was proposed from an  study of the seyfert 1 galaxy mcg-6 - 30 - 15 ( shih  2002 ) , and supported by extended  observations of the same source ( fabian and vaughan 2003 ) . however , it is notable that for h  the power law fit including absorption ( figure 4c ) indicates further steepening above @xmath03 kev , and we recall the comptt model ( titarchuk 1994 ) gave an even better fit to the high state difference spectrum reported in paper 1 .",
    "figure 5 reproduces the residuals to the single power law and a comptt fits to the high state difference spectrum .",
    "the thermal comptonisation model has the additional appeal of being more physical than a power law fit . since the intrinsic curvature of the thermal continuum might significantly affect the derived absorption parameters we therefore repeated the analysis of the intermediate state difference spectrum with a model involving the emergence of a cool comptonised emission component modified by absorption in ionised matter .    replacing the power law of section 4 with a comptonised emission component , with an initial temperature of kt@xmath02.7 kev and optical depth @xmath04.4 ,",
    "as found for the high flux difference spectrum , the fit was indeed better than for the power law model , though still poor ( @xmath10 = 1102/796 dof ) , with data : model residuals similar to those for the power law fit in figure 4a .",
    "photoionised absorption represented by xstar was then added to the model .",
    "the outcome was a very good fit ( @xmath10 = 828/784 dof ) for an comptonised emission component of kt=2.3@xmath90.4 kev and optical depth 4.5@xmath90.7 .",
    "the absorption was again well modelled by low ionisation matter , with a column density of @xmath23@xmath0@xmath25 and ionisation parameter of log@xmath21=-1.8@xmath90.3 .",
    "the relative abundances of the key elements , of c , n , o , ne , mg and fe , were 0.2,0.2,0.12,0.4,0.7 and 0.66 , with the lower abundances of c and n ( compared with the power law fit ) adjusting to the low energy curvature in the continuum fit .    figure 6a shows the best - fit comptonised emission component and pn camera data for the intermediate flux difference spectrum , with the xstar absorption component removed . figure 6b reproduces the model spectrum , while figure 6c illustrates the quality of the resulting fit .",
    "taken together with the high state difference spectrum reported in paper 1 , the above analysis of the intermediate state difference spectrum suggests the large scale spectral variability of h  is indeed due to an emerging emission component which - at intermediate flux levels - bears the imprint of absorption by low ionisation matter . to see",
    "if that trend of variable absorption with flux level is continous , we repeated the above analysis for the mid - low flux state observation , but again starting with a ` conventional ' power law plus blackbody fit .    fitting",
    "a power law over the hard x - ray ( 210 kev ) band yielded a photon index of @xmath1=1.41@xmath90.03 ( pn ) and @xmath1=1.35@xmath90.06 ( mos ) for the mid - low flux spectrum . extending this fit to",
    "0.3 kev showed a soft excess rising sharply below @xmath00.7 kev ( figure 7a ) .",
    "the narrower profile of this soft excess ( compared with that in figure 2a ) allowed it to be well - modelled by the addition of a single blackbody component of kt @xmath0102 ev , no hotter blackbody being required . in this case a single absorption edge ( @xmath15@xmath00.8 at 0.76@xmath90.01 kev ) was needed to complete an excellent fit ( @xmath10 = 245/244 dof ) .",
    "figure 7b shows the ratio of data to this power law , blackbody and absorption edge model . in summary ,",
    "a conventional fit to the mid - low flux spectrum of h  shows a hard ( flat ) power law , with a sharply rising ( cool ) soft excess , and a deep absorption edge at @xmath00.76 kev ( in the agn rest frame ) .    the above fit provided a measure of the x - ray fluxes and luminosity of h  in the the mid - low flux state , which were : @xmath26  erg s@xmath13 @xmath14 ( 0.31 kev ) , @xmath27  erg s@xmath13 @xmath14 ( 12 kev ) , and @xmath28  erg s@xmath13 @xmath14 ( 210 kev ) , corresponding to a 0.310 kev luminosity for h  of @xmath29  erg s@xmath13 ( @xmath30  kms@xmath13mpc@xmath13 ) .    proceeding to examine the mid - low state difference spectrum",
    ", we followed the analysis procedure described in section 4 , using comptt to model the emission component .",
    "the relatively poor statistics meant that the comptonisation parameters were not well defined , the best fit having a temperature kt=2.1@xmath91.5 kev and optical depth 2.7@xmath92 .",
    "however , the continuum fit was adequate to show the absorption trough to be noticeably deeper in the mid - low state difference spectrum ( figure 8a ) .",
    "fitting this absorption with xstar , with abundances fixed at the values found in the intermediate state model , again produced an acceptable fit ( @xmath10 = 259/238 dof ) , with a column density of @xmath23@xmath0@xmath31 and ionisation parameter of log@xmath21=-2.3@xmath90.3 .",
    "while the ionisation parameters of the intermediate and mid - low difference spectra are the same within the formal errors , we see below that the lower ionisation in the mid - low flux state spectrum is critical to understanding the different shape of the absorption trough in the two spectra .",
    "figure 8b reproduces the xstar model and figure 8c shows the data : model residuals for the mid - low difference spectrum fit .",
    "the above difference spectrum fits indicate that absorption in low ionisation matter is substantially modifying the variable emission component - and hence the overall observed x - ray spectrum of h ; furthermore , we find the absorbing matter to become more ionised and the column density to fall as the continuum flux rises . to further explore the variable absorber we then computed the ratio of the ` raw ' intermediate and mid - low flux spectra .",
    "the shape of that ratio plot ( figure 9a ) is particularly interesting , the marked drop observed at @xmath00.7 kev coinciding with low ionisation fe absorption edges , with no obvious change in the flux ratio at the corresponding edges of low ionisation oxygen .",
    "the flux ratio plot is thus consistent with the specific xstar models which match the relatively deeper absorption edge near 0.7 kev with the lower ionisation parameter for the lower flux state spectrum ( cf figures 6b and 8b ) . a weaker feature at @xmath00.9 kev in figure 9a , close to the absorption edge structure of ne , is also qualitatively consistent with the individual xstar fits .",
    "figure 9b shows the ratio of the mid - high to high flux state spectra , indicating the same pattern of decreasing absorption continues as the flux level of h  rises towards the high state .",
    "the different profile of the absorption in the intermediate and mid - low state difference spectral fits is determined by the changing ionisation parameter . to better understand that change we replot the key section of each xstar model fit in figure 10 , where for ease of comparison with listed edges the energy axes are adjusted to the rest - frame of h and the principal absorbing ion stages",
    "are noted against the respective absorption features .",
    "reference to the detailed absorption cross - sections for ground states of o and fe ( kallman and bautista 2001 ) then provides a qualitative explanation for the differential absorption we see in h , since whereas the threshold energy cross - section in fe increases by a factor @xmath02.5 from fev - fei , the threshold cross - sections increases by only @xmath040 percent from oiv - oi .    in summary , we find that the emerging emission component responsible for the main spectral change in h  is modified by low energy absorption in a substantial column density of low ionisation matter .",
    "further , while remaining low , the ionisation state of the absorber increases as h  gets brighter , while the absorbing column ( or perhaps the covering factor ) simultaneously decreases , and the increasing ionisation parameter provides a natural explanation of the changing energy profile of the absorption trough .",
    "given the above evidence for substantial absorbing matter modifying the epic spectrum , it is of obvious importance to check whether this is consistent with the higher resolution rgs data . to pursue that question",
    "we examined the simultaneous  grating data of h , initially summing the data from all 5 orbits ( 512 - 690 ) to get the best statistics , for what is a relatively faint source .",
    "figure 11 displays the rgs-1 and rgs-2 fluxed spectrum , binned relatively coarsely at 85 m .",
    "the only spectral lines detected are all in emission , though the broad deficit between @xmath01020   is qualitatively consistent with the absorption trough seen in the epic spectra .",
    "the narrower absorption feature observed near 17.5   is also consistent with the fe 2 - 3 unresolved transition array ( uta , behar  2001 ) indicated in the xstar model fits ( fig .",
    "the zero velocity wavelengths of the principal k - shell emission lines and radiative recombination continua ( rrc ) falling in the 838   waveband are indicated on the figure , and several are clearly detected .    to quantify the individual spectral features we modelled the rgs data with a simple power law , with @xmath1@xmath02.45 yielding a reasonably good continuum fit ( @xmath10 = 4264/4084 ) over the 838   band , and then added gaussians to each candidate emission line , in turn , with wavelength , line width and flux as free parameters .",
    "4 emission lines were formally detected , those of oviii ly@xmath32 , the resonance ( r ) and forbidden ( f ) lines of the ovii 1s-2p triplet , and the forbidden line of nvi , together with the rrc of ovii .",
    "table 1 lists the results .",
    "interestingly , the gaussian line fits support the visible impression from the fluxed spectra that the profiles of the resonance lines of ovii and oviii are resolved , the best fit line widths corresponding to a velocity width of 7000@xmath93000 km s@xmath13 .",
    "figure 12a shows the ovii and viii lines at a higher resolution ( 35 m  bin width ) , and is compared in figure 12b with the same spectral region observed in the low state spectrum . due to the much poorer statistics the latter fluxed spectrum is more coarsely binned , at 175 m , and shows why only the oviii ly@xmath32 and ovii ( f ) lines were identified in the earlier analysis of the low state rgs spectrum ( paper 1 ) .",
    "the improved statistics of the full spectrum now allows the ovii ( r ) line to be resolved , though the total line fluxes remain consistent ( within a factor @xmath01.5 ) with those observed in the low flux state ( paper 1 ) .",
    "that consistency is significant in the context of our identification of a constant ` core ' soft emission ( section 9 ) , since the observed overall @xmath00.3 - 1 kev flux - including the variable continuum component - varies by a factor @xmath04 over the 5 new  observations ( figure 1 ) .",
    "the most important finding from our analysis of the epic spectra is of a substantial column density of low ionisation matter affecting the strongly variable emission component .    at first sight ,",
    "the rgs data seem to be in conflict with the above picture , since no narrow absorption features are observed , even though the epic ratio spectra ( figure 9b ) shows significant broad band absorption remaining up to the mid - high flux state . however , we note the rgs is designed to detect emission and absorption lines , and is much less sensitive than epic to detecting continuum absorption .",
    "it is also possible that the absorbing material , if located close to the continuum emission region , is velocity broadened . in that context",
    "we note that the ovii and oviii resonance emission lines are marginally resolved , suggesting an origin in moderately ionised matter with a velocity width of 7000@xmath93000 km s@xmath13 , while it is conceivable that a still higher velocity/ more turbulent outflow at smaller radii is responsible for the main absorption in the epic difference spectra .",
    "the width of the fe k line in the intermediate state spectrum ( section 3 ) indicates such a higher velocity dispersion , if interpreted as arising from fluorescence in the overlying absorber .    to check for comparable absorption edge structure in the rgs data we subtracted the low state data from the summed spectra for march - june - september 2003 , producing an intermediate state rgs difference spectrum , and plot that in figure 13 against a simple power law model . with coarser binning ( than in fig .",
    "11 ) the plot is consistent with absorption edges similar to those found in the xstar fits to the intermediate state epic difference spectrum ( fig .",
    "6b ) , though the statistics are not good enough to usefully constrain any velocity broadened edges .",
    "modelling the soft excess ( conventionally defined as the excess soft x - ray flux below above an extrapolation of the 210 kev power law ) with one or more blackbodies , as in section 3 , is a common practice in x - ray astronomy .",
    "however , since the implied blackbody temperatures are much higher than appropriate to an agn accretion disc , a common explanation is that the disc photons gain energy by electron scattering in a hotter ` skin ' or a ` corona ' lying above the disc .",
    "nevertheless , such comptonisation models have remained rather ad hoc .",
    "recently , a scaling by black hole mass of ( more robust ) comptonisation models for galactic black hole sources ( done and gierlinski 2003 ) failed to explain the sharp upturn often seen below @xmath01 kev in agn spectra . noting also the similar shape ( or blackbody temperature ) of soft excess in agn over a wide luminosity range",
    ", those authors proposed that the soft excess in agn could be an artefact of ` unseen or ignored ' absorption ( gierlinski and done , 2004 ) .",
    "the idea that absorption could be playing a larger part than normally assumed in shaping the broad band spectra of seyfert 1 galaxies was put forward in an early mini - survey of  observations by pounds and reeves ( 2002 ) . in figure 1 of pounds and reeves ( 2002 )",
    "we showed the similarity in the ` observed ' broad band spectra of agn over a wide luminosity range , while noting that the more luminous sources exhibited a more ` gradual ' onset of the soft excess .",
    "in comparing the present epic spectra of h  we now find the same qualitative trend with flux level .",
    "figure 14 compares the apparent soft excess above a 210 kev power law for the 5 flux states of h , with the higher flux states showing a more ` gradual ' ( or hotter ) soft excess .",
    "our present analysis suggests that the ` conventional ' soft excess is indeed strongly affected by absorption .",
    "the additional point to emphasise here is that the individual difference spectra , for high , intermediate , and mid - low states of h  exhibit _ no soft excess_. instead , we identify a _ core soft x - ray emission _",
    "component in the extreme low flux observation of september 2002 ( paper 1 ) .",
    "thermal emission from the accretion disc modified by scattering in a hotter skin or corona and reflection from a hot inner disc surface are possible contributors to this ` core ' soft component .",
    "however , our present analysis of h , with evidence for a substantial column of cold nuclear gas becoming less opaque as the x - ray flux increases , suggests that recombination emission from associated photoionised ( outflowing ? ) matter is a natural origin of the soft excess .",
    "to test that idea we can compare the ` core ' soft excess observed in the  low state observation of h  with an emission model grid from xstar .    as with the absorption grids ,",
    "the ionising continuum is a power law of energy index -1 .",
    "the key variable parameters in this test were the ionisation state and relative metal abundances , which essentially determine the emission spectrum for comparison with the overall shape of low state soft excess observed in epic , and with the ( few ) strongest features identified in the rgs spectrum .",
    "figure 15a shows the ` soft x - ray emission component ' , illustrated by removal of the black body and gaussian emission line attributed to a blend of the ovii triplet and oviii ly@xmath32 from the broad band fit to the low flux state epic spectrum discussed in paper 1 .",
    "quantitatively , the x - ray flux in that soft excess ( 0.31 kev ) is @xmath01.3@xmath3310@xmath34 ergs s@xmath13 , some 30 percent of the flux removed by the low energy absorption trough in the intermediate flux state ( ` mean ' ? ) spectrum of h. replacing the blackbody and o - k emission components with a grid of photoionised emission models in xstar produced a statistically good fit ( @xmath10=1028/1058 dof ) , ie was able to reproduce the _ shape _ of the core soft emission , with an ionisation parameter log@xmath21@xmath01.3 and element abundances for c , n , o , ne and fe ( relative to solar ) of 0.4,0.4,0.15,0.35 and 0.45 .",
    "we note the ratio of the key elements , o and fe , suggests an over - abundance of fe , similar to that found in the absorption modelling .",
    "figure 15b reproduces the fitted xstar emission spectrum , showing how the emission profile , attenuated by the galactic absorption in the line of sight to h , matches the strongly peaked soft excess in figure 15a .",
    "it may also be understood , qualitatively , how the only lines detected in the full rgs spectrum of h , velocity broadened in the figure by a gaussian width of @xmath11@xmath05ev , are the principal emission lines of ovii , oviii , nvi and cvi .    finally , it is interesting to compare the fe k line in the model of figure 15b with the emission line detected in the intermediate flux state epic data ( figures 2a and 3 ) .",
    "relative to the resonance lines of ovii and viii , the xstar model yields an fe line which is a factor @xmath010 weaker , and centered at @xmath06.42 kev ( corresponding to fexvii ) compared with the epic line energy of 6.25@xmath90.12 kev .",
    "it seems probable , therefore , that the bulk of the observed fe k line arises by fluorescence in low ionisation matter , with the absorbing column being an obvious candidate . in that case",
    "the observed line width and mean energy both indicate the re - processing matter lies within @xmath0100 schwarzschild radii of the smbh , while the equivalent width requires a substantial covering factor .",
    "the above analysis assumes that the underlying hard power law and ` soft excess ' seen in the low flux state of h  in september 2002 remains constant - or , at least , much less strongly variable - over a timescale of 13 years . the similar power law index/ comptt parameters and absence of a soft excess in the mid - low , intermediate and high flux state difference spectra support that assumption and - in turn - suggest the ` core ' and variable x - ray emission components have a separate origin .",
    "our good fortune in observing h  over a wide range of flux levels has yielded three main results .",
    "first , examination of the difference spectra of the intermediate and mid - low state epic data supports the conclusion in paper 1 that the variable emission component has the form of a steep power law , or cool comptonised thermal spectrum .",
    "second , this variable emission continuum shows the imprint at intermediate flux levels of absorption in low ionisation matter , the effect of which decreases as the source flux increases .",
    "third , we note that the x - ray luminosity ` lost ' in the time - averaged absorbed flux is of the same order as that in the soft x - ray emission component seen in the low state spectrum of h , reported in paper 1 , suggesting a possible origin of the ` core ' soft x - ray emission .",
    "thermal comptonisation remains a likely mechanism for the variable continuum emission component , with an excellent match to the high state difference spectrum .",
    "we also have evidence from simultaneous measurements of h  with the optical monitor on  ( mason  2001 ) that the uv ( 2120 , 2910 ) flux increased by @xmath020 percent from the low to the intermediate flux state ( with smaller increases of @xmath010 percent in the u band and @xmath355 percent in v ) , consistent with the larger change in the uv between the high and low flux states ( paper 1 ) .",
    "these data appear to confirm a link between the x - ray spectral change and enhanced thermal emission from the accretion disc .",
    "however , while increased disc emission could drive that change , the similarity in the luminosity increase in the soft x - ray and uv bands leaves open the alternative possibility that the uv flux increase is due to reprocessing of soft x - rays directed towards the ( unobscured ) outer disc . in the latter case the brightening x - ray continuum would primarily be a consequence of an increased optical depth of comptonising electrons .",
    "we note , in passing , that if the scenario we propose for h  is widely applicable to radio quiet agn , then the hard ( disc - corona emission ? ) and softer continuum components must be coupled in some way in order to explain the ` canonical ' power law index ( neglecting reflection ) of @xmath1@xmath01.7 at 210 kev , observed in broad - band fits for seyfert 1 galaxies in general ( nandra and pounds 1994 ) , as well as the long - term average spectrum of h.    given that the peak luminosity of the variable x - ray emission component is @xmath3510 percent of the bolometric ( accretion ) luminosity of h , the kinetic energy in a wind could be sufficient to support a separate emission process .",
    "although we have found no unambiguous evidence for an outflow in h , the resolved emission line profiles of fe k , ovii and oviii imply a large velocity dispersion , while it seems likely that as the cold absorber is photoionised some fraction will be driven away by the strong continuum radiation pressure .",
    "we also note the growing evidence in other recent studies for ionised outflows at velocities of @xmath0520 percent of c ( chartas  2002 ; pounds  2003 , 2004b ; chartas  2003 ; reeves  2003 ) .",
    "any such outflow is likely to have an initial velocity which reflects the gravity of its origin ( as with stellar winds ) , so that a wind emerging from a small radius will have a correspondingly high velocity .",
    "the kinetic energy carried by such a ` black hole wind ' ( king and pounds 2003 ) could then support a separate emission mechanism of order v / c times the bolometric luminosity , with shocks in the outflow ( eg . camenzind and courvoisier 1983 ) perhaps providing the enhanced comptonising electrons .",
    "a timescale for major spectral change in h  being of order several months , one possible cause of an increased outflow may be the co - alignment of magnetic field lines in the inner disc ( livio  2001 ) . alternatively , if the variable x - ray emission arises from the base of a jet ( eg .",
    "markoff  2001 ) , then it is interesting to note that synchrotron radiation could - qualitatively - also explain the spectral form of h.    absorption features in both the difference and flux - ratio spectra of h  provide clear evidence for substantial low ionisation matter overlying - or embedded in - the x - ray continuum emission region . the marked decrease in opacity and/or covering factor of the absorber ,",
    "as the x - ray flux increases , indicates the absorbing matter lies close to the smbh , a conclusion also consistent with the seyfert 1 classification of h. the low ionisation parameter then requires the absorbing matter to be of high density ( @xmath36@xmath37 @xmath38 ) to survive the intense continuum irradiation .",
    "a possible scenario is for the absorbing matter to be in small , dense clouds which partially cover the continuum source ( eg .",
    "ferland and rees , 1988 ) , the covering factor decreasing as the source flux increases , a change modelled by a reducing column density in our spectral fitting .",
    "dense matter at the base of a jet or outflow provide other potential sites .",
    "the recent discussion of ` aborted jets ' , where dense blobs of matter are ejected from the inner accretion disc at sub - escape velocities ( ghisellini  2004 ) , also offers a geometry which might be compatible with the results we report here .",
    "although the spectral variability in h  is extreme , the low flux state spectrum is remarkably similar in appearance to the low state spectra of two other bright seyfert 1 galaxies , ngc4051 ( pounds  2004b , uttley  2004 ) , and mcg-6 - 30 - 15 ( eg reynolds  2004 ) . in each case",
    "a hard power law continuum also exhibits a broad spectral feature at @xmath036 kev that may alternatively be fitted by an extreme relativistic fe k line or by partial covering of the x - ray continuum by low ionisation matter . in the disc - corona model of hard x - ray emission , where uv photons from the accretion disc are up - scattered in an overlying corona ( eg . haardt and maraschi , 1991 ) , an unusually hard spectrum indicates a relatively low uv flux and ` photon - starved ' corona .",
    "the intrinsic hardness of the ` core ' spectrum would be reduced somewhat if continuum reflection is enhanced , for example by light bending in the strong gravity near the black hole , as proposed by miniutti and fabian ( 2004 ) to explain the extreme fe k emission line in the low state spectrum of mcg-6 - 30 - 15 . in that case a simultaneous observation by  supported the enhanced reflection , rather than partial covering models . however , in the light of the new evidence reported here for substantial cold matter close to the black hole in h , it is hard to exclude the possibility that absorption also modifies the strength and profile of the key diagnostic fe k emission line in agn spectra .",
    "the strong forbidden line of ovii is evidence that a substantial part of the ` core ' soft x - ray emission comes from an ionised gas of relatively low density , where the emission measure then yields a radial extent ( paper 1 ) sufficient to maintain the soft x - ray emission essentially constant over the 3 years of our  studies of h. the detection of resolved resonance lines of ovii and oviii , and a strong rrc of ovii in the full rgs spectrum suggests an additional component to the soft x - ray emission from higher density , and perhaps turbulent , recombining gas closer to the continuum source .",
    "the comparable luminosity of the ` core ' soft x - ray emission with that of the absorbed continuum in the intermediate ( average ) flux state then offers a natural explanation of the soft x - ray emission , as an ionised outflow subsequently recombines .",
    "the ` true ' soft excess in seyfert 1 galaxies , as we find for h , may then be more akin to the soft x - ray emission seen in seyfert 2 galaxies , and arising from an extended region of ionised gas .",
    "finally , we point out the detection of cold absorbing matter close to the smbh in a luminous seyfert 1 galaxy implies an additional component to the ` standard model ' by which type 1 and type 2 agn are distinguished in relation to absorption in a distant torus ( antonucci 1993 ) .",
    "a series of  observations of the luminous seyfert 1 galaxy h  has shown the large - scale spectral variability is primarily due to a steep power law or cool comptonised thermal emission component . in seeking an alternative to the disc - corona model for this new emission component",
    "it is interesting to note that mechanical energy in a wind could be sufficient to support such a process , perhaps via shocks in a turbulent or inhomogeneous outflow .",
    "broad absorption features superimposed on the variable emission continuum require substantial cold , dense matter apparently lying close to the central smbh .",
    "as h   brightens from a low to a high flux state the ionisation parameter of this absorbing matter increases and its column density ( or covering factor ) falls .",
    "the existence of cold absorbing matter close to the smbh in a luminous seyfert 1 galaxy adds a new component to the standard model in which type 1 and type 2 agn are distinguished in terms of an obscuring torus .",
    "a primary difference is that this inner absorber is subject to the intense radiation - and perhaps coherent magnetic fields - which will control its opacity and probably drive it outward in the form of a wind .",
    "an underlying assumption in our analysis is that a hard ` core ' spectral component remains essentially unchanged over the 13 year period of the observations .",
    "we note the similarity of this ` core ' x - ray spectrum of h  to high quality ` low state spectra ' of other seyfert 1 galaxies , including ngc 4051 and mcg-6 - 30 - 15 , which also show a flat power law , relativistic fe k emission line or partial covering , and strong ` soft excess ' .    \\4 . in the case of h",
    "we find the variable soft excess is essentially an artefact of continuum absorption , while a ` core ' ` soft x - ray emission ' component has a spectral form and luminosity consistent with re - emission of the absorbed x - ray continuum in an extended region of ionised gas .    \\5 . while the x - ray spectral variability of h  is extreme , its explanation in terms of a variable soft emission component , modified by absorption in low ionisation matter close to the smbh , is unlikely to be unique , suggesting the need for re - appraisal of other high quality agn x - ray spectra .",
    "finally , we note the occurrence of a substantial column density of cold gas overlying the hard x - ray source in a luminous agn has implications both for the diagnostic potential of the fe k emission line and the new source population required to explain the hard ( @xmath365 kev ) cosmic x - ray background spectrum .",
    "the results reported here are based on observations obtained with , an esa science mission with instruments and contributions directly funded by esa member states and the usa ( nasa ) .",
    "the authors wish to thank the soc and ssc teams for organising the  observations and initial data reduction , tim kallman for provision of a new xstar grid , and the referee for constructive comments on the initial text .",
