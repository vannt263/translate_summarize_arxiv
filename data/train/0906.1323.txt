    "advection - dominated accretion flow ( adaf ) is widely regarded as a successful model for explaining the quiescent and hard states of black hole ( bh ) x - ray binaries as well as low - luminosity agns ( narayan 2005 , yuan 2007 , and ho 2008 for reviews ) .",
    "it have been predicted theoretically and confirmed in numerical simulations that strong winds and jets can be driven by the tremendous thermal energy in adaf ( see narayan & mcclintock 2008 and references therein ) .",
    "observational evidence for the association of nonthermal relativistic jets with adafs has been accumulated in recent years with the discovery of radio emission in virtually every bh binaries in the hard state and in low - luminosity agns ( corbel et al .",
    "2000 ; fender 2001 ; fender , belloni & gallo 2004 ; fender & belloni 2004 ) .",
    "it has been pointed out that an outflow emanating from an accretion disk can act as a sink for mass , angular momentum and energy , altering the dissipation rates and effective temperatures across the disk ( donea & biermann 1996 ; knigge 1999 ; kuncic & bicknell 2007 ; li et al .",
    "2008 ; xie & yuan 2008 ) .",
    "thus the jets launched from the adafs should influence the dynamics of adafs due to the mass , angular momentum and energy extracted through outflow .",
    "the currently most favored mechanisms for jet production include the blandford - znajek ( bz ) process ( blandford & znajek 1977 ) and the blandford - payne ( bp ) process ( blandford & payne 1982 , hereafter bp82 ) . in the bz process , energy and angular momentum are extracted from a rotating bh and transferred to a remote astrophysical load by open magnetic field lines . in the bp process , the magnetic fields threading the disk extract energy from the accretion disk itself to power the jet / outflow .",
    "some authors argued that the maximal jet power extracted via the bp process dominates over the power extracted via the bz process , provided that the poloidal field threading the bh is not significantly greater than that threading the inner disk ( e.g. , livio et al .",
    "1999 ; meier 1999 , 2001 ; cao 2002 ; nemmen et al . 2007 ) .",
    "young et al . ( 2007 ) discovered the large rotating wind of the quasar pg 1700 + 518 , providing direct observational evidence that outflows from agns is launched from the disks .",
    "merloni & heinz ( 2007 , hereafter mh07 ) obtained a clear relationship between eddington - scaled kinetic power and bolometric luminosity based on a statistical analysis of a sample of 15 sub - eddington agns .",
    "the measured slope suggests that these objects are in a radiatively inefficient accretion mode . and",
    "they interpreted this fact with a simple coupled accretion - outflow disk model .",
    "however , dynamically important magnetic fields and their role in the jet production mechanisms were not taken into account in mh07 .",
    "fanaroff & riley ( 1974 ) recognized that the majority of radio galaxies can be classified into two types ( fr i and fr ii ) according to their radio morphology , i.e. , edge darkened and edge brightened sources , and that this division rather neatly translates into a separation in radio power being below and above @xmath0 at 178 mhz .",
    "this division has become even clearer and sharper when it has been found by ledlow & owen ( 1994 , 1996 ) that it is clearly shown by a line in the plane of the optical luminosity of the host galaxy and the total radio luminosity . over the years , much work has been done to understand the remarkable fr i / ii dichotomy , which may depend on the fundamental parameters , such as bh spin and accretion mode ( meier , 1999 ; ghisellini & celotti , 2001 , hereafter gc01 ) ; wold , lacy & armus 2007 , hereafter wla07 ; wu & cao 2008 , hereafter wc08 ) .    motivated by the above work , we intend to discuss the outflow / jet driven by the bp process , and investigate the interaction of the outflow / jet with adaf . for simplicity",
    "we treat a schwarzschild bh , and the bz process is not included in this model . following yuan , ma & narayan ( 2008 , hereafter ymn08 ) , we replace the radial momentum equation by a simple algebraic relation between the angular velocity of the gas and the keplerian angular velocity of the disk .",
    "based on the conservation laws of mass , angular momentum and energy we derive the expressions of the bp power and disk luminosity .",
    "we fit the 210 kev luminosity and kinetic power of the 15 samples given in mh07 based on adaf model with jet , and obtain an anti - correlation between the accretion rate and the advection parameter , which could be used to explain the correlation between eddington - scaled kinetic power and bolometric luminosity of the 15 samples .",
    "in addition , we express the dividing line of the ledlow - owen relation for fr i / ii dichotomy in the plane of @xmath1 versus @xmath2 .",
    "we find that the fr i / ii dichotomy is closely related to the accretion rate , but has a weak dependence on the bh mass , which is consistent with the results derived by gc01 and wla07 .",
    "and the dividing accretion rate is less than the critical accretion rate for adafs , suggesting that fr i sources is in the adaf state .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sect .",
    "2 we describe our model , and derive the expressions for the bp power and disk luminosity at the presence of a jet based on the conservation laws of mass , angular momentum and energy . in sect .",
    "3 , we fit the 210 kev luminosity and kinetic power of the 15 sources given in mh07 based on our model . in sect .",
    "4 we present the dividing lines of the ledlow - owen relation for fr",
    "i / ii dichotomy in the plane of @xmath3 . finally , in sect . 5",
    ", we summarize our main conclusions .",
    "we assume that the adaf is stationary and axisymmetric , extending from the outer edge to the bh horizon .",
    "two kinds of magnetic fields are involved in this model , i.e. , the large - scale magnetic field threading the adaf and the small - scale magnetic field tangled in the adaf .",
    "the large - scale and the small - scale magnetic fields are assumed to work independently , contribute to the bp process and viscosity , respectively .",
    "the adaf is assumed to be ideally conducting and force - free .",
    "following bp82 , we assume that the poloidal magnetic field on the disk surface varies with the disk radius as follows ,    @xmath4    where @xmath5 and @xmath6 are",
    "the adaf and horizon radii , respectively , and we have @xmath7 with @xmath8 for a schwarzschild bh .",
    "the quantities @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the magnetic field at adaf and horizon , respectively .    considering the balance between the magnetic pressure on the horizon and the ram pressure of the innermost parts of adaf , moderski , sikora & lasota ( 1997 ) expressed the magnetic field at the horizon as follows ,    @xmath11    where @xmath12 is the accretion rate at the bh horizon , which can be written as a dimensionless one in terms of the eddington accretion rate as follows ,    @xmath13    where    @xmath14    considering that equation ( [ eq2 ] ) is uncertain , we introduce a parameter @xmath15 to adjust the magnetic pressure at the bh horizon relative to the ram pressure of adaf , and equation ( [ eq2 ] ) is rewritten as    @xmath16    as argued by bp82 and spruit ( 1996 ) , the outflow matter could be accelerated centrifugally along the magnetic field lines , overcoming a barrier of gravitational potential to form magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) jets .",
    "the poynting flux dominates over the kinetic flux near the disk surface , and the former is converted into the latter during accelerating matter in the outflow .",
    "thus we express the poynting energy flux @xmath17 extracted electromagnetically from the adaf as ( the derivation of equation ( [ eq6 ] ) is given in appendix a ) ,    @xmath18    the electromagnetic angular momentum flux @xmath19 extracted is related to the poynting energy flux by    @xmath20    the energy flux of the jet can be regarded as the sum of the kinetic and the poynting fluxes ,    @xmath21    where @xmath22 is the mass loss rate in the jet from unit area of the adaf , and @xmath23 is the poloidal velocity of the outflow , and @xmath24 is the kinetic flux .    it is noted that @xmath24 is much less than @xmath17 at the surface of adaf , while the two are comparable at alfven surface due to a considerable fraction of the poynting flux converted into kinetic flux . thus the energy flux of the jet is related to @xmath25 by    @xmath26    where @xmath27 is the bulk lorentz factor of the jet .",
    "considering that @xmath28 is dominated by @xmath17 at the surface of adaf , and combining equations ( [ eq1 ] ) , ( [ eq5 ] ) , ( [ eq6 ] ) , ( [ eq8 ] ) and ( [ eq9 ] ) , we derive the relation between @xmath22 and @xmath12 as follows ,    @xmath29    inspecting equation ( [ eq10 ] ) , we find that the ratio of @xmath22 to @xmath12 is sensitive to and inversely proportional to the value of the parameter @xmath15 .    based on the self - similar solution obtained by narayan & yi ( 1994 ) ymn08 suggested a simple algebraic relation between the angular velocity of adaf and the keplerian angular velocity as follows ,    @xmath30    where the quantity @xmath31 is a function of the radius @xmath5 expressed as follows ,    @xmath32    in equation ( [ eq12 ] ) @xmath33 is an adjustable constant . as argued in ymn08 , @xmath34 gives very good results for all accretion rates as the viscous parameter @xmath35 is large , say @xmath36 , for which an adaf solution is possible .",
    "although the global solutions of adaf with large - scale magnetic field have not been achieved , we think equations ( [ eq11 ] ) and ( [ eq12 ] ) could be applicable to adaf with jet driven by the bp process .",
    "we expect that the values of the function @xmath31 are less than those given by equation ( [ eq12 ] ) , and @xmath34 can be regarded as an upper limit in calculations .",
    "incorporating equations ( [ eq10 ] ) , ( [ eq11 ] ) and ( [ eq12 ] ) , we have the dimensionless mass flux of the jet as follows ,    @xmath37^{2 } \\mbox { , \\ for }   \\xi < 6 , \\\\   \\end{array } } \\right.\\\\   \\end{array}\\ ] ]    where @xmath38 is the radial parameter of the disk defined in terms of the radius @xmath39 .",
    "based on equation ( [ eq13 ] ) we have the curves of the dimensionless jet mass flux",
    "@xmath40 varying with the parameter @xmath41 for the given values of @xmath27 as shown in figure 1 .    as shown in figure 1 , the dimensionless jet mass flux @xmath40 increases with @xmath41 at first , and then it decreases steeply with @xmath41 as @xmath42 , attaining its peak value in the region @xmath43 .",
    "this result implies that the outflow is launched predominantly from the innermost adaf .",
    "inspecting equation ( [ eq13 ] ) and figure 1 , we find that the dimensionless mass flux of the jet at the given radius decreases significantly with the increasing @xmath27 , and we have @xmath44 for @xmath45 .",
    "this result implies that the extracted energy from the disk is almost carried in the form of electromagnetic form , suggesting the presence of a strong mass loss in the case that the bulk lorentz factor is small enough .     versus @xmath41 for different values of @xmath27 with @xmath15=0.5.,width=264 ]",
    "according to the conservation law of mass , the accretion rate of disk matter is related to the mass outflow rate by    @xmath46    incorporating equations ( [ eq13 ] ) and ( [ eq14 ] ) , we have the dimensionless accretion rate as follows ,    @xmath47    by using equation ( [ eq15 ] ) we have the curves of @xmath48 varying with @xmath41 for the given values of @xmath27 as shown in figure 2 .",
    "it is shown that @xmath49 increases steeply with the increasing @xmath41 in the innermost adaf , while it almost keeps constant as @xmath5 is greater than dozens of @xmath39 .     versus @xmath41 for different values of @xmath27 with @xmath15=0.5.,width=264 ]    in the bp process",
    "accreting matter is channeled into the outflow / jet by virtue of the poloidal magnetic field lines frozen in the disk , and the streaming gas is accelerated due to the work done by the magnetic torque .",
    "thus equation of angular momentum at the presence of the jet should be written as    @xmath50,\\ ] ]    where @xmath51and @xmath52 are respectively the vertical scale height and r@xmath53-component of stress tensor , and they read ( manmoto , mineshige & kusunose 1997 )    @xmath54    where @xmath55 and @xmath56 are the isothermal sound speed , total pressure and height - averaged density , respectively . substituting equations ( [ eq14 ] ) and ( [ eq17 ] ) into equation ( [ eq16 ] ) , we have    @xmath57,\\ ] ]    where ` no torque boundary condition ' at the horizon of a schwarzschild bh is used in deriving equation ( [ eq18 ] ) .",

    "the measured slope suggests that these objects are in a radiatively inefficient accretion mode .",
    "based on kuncic & bicknell ( 2004 ) a simple coupled accretion - outflow disk model was presented to explain the main features of the observed sample .",

    "we intend to fit the 210 kev luminosity and kinetic power of the 15 samples based on our model .    inspecting equation ( [ eq21 ] ) , we find that the radiation flux at the presence of the jet could become negative for @xmath15 less than a critical value , and we obtain @xmath72 by setting the minimum radiation flux equal to zero .",

    "<S> we propose a simplified model of outflow / jet driven by the blandford - payne ( bp ) process from advection dominated accretion flows ( adaf ) and derive the expressions of the bp power and disk luminosity based on the conservation laws of mass , angular momentum and energy . </S>",
    "<S> we fit the 210 kev luminosity and kinetic power of 15 active galactic nucleus ( agns ) of sub - eddington luminosity . </S>",
    "<S> it is found that there exists an anti - correlation between the accretion rate and the advection parameter , which could be used to explain the correlation between eddington - scaled kinetic power and bolometric luminosity of the 15 samples . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , the ledlow - owen relation for fr i / ii dichotomy is re - expressed in a parameter space consisting of logarithm of dimensionless accretion rate versus that of the bh mass . </S>",
    "<S> it turns out that the fr i / ii dichotomy is determined mainly by the dimensionless accretion rate , being insensitive to the bh mass . and the dividing accretion rate is less than the critical accretion rate for adafs , suggesting that fr i sources are all in the adaf state .    </S>",
