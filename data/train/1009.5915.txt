    "<S> here we report the results of a comprehensive spectroscopic ellipsometry study of a high - quality crystal of superconducting @xmath0 that challenges this notion . </S>",
    "<S> we observe a superconductivity - induced suppression of an absorption band at an energy of @xmath1 , two orders of magnitude above the superconducting gap energy @xmath2 . based on density - functional calculations , </S>",
    "<S> this band can be assigned to transitions from as - p to fe - d orbitals crossing the fermi surface . </S>",
    "<S> we identify a related effect at the spin - density - wave transition in parent compounds of the 122 family . </S>",
    "<S> this suggests that as - p states deep below the fermi level contribute to the formation of the superconducting and spin - density - wave states in the iron arsenides .    the standard bardeen - cooper - schrieffer ( bcs ) theory of superconductivity based solely on an effective attractive interaction between electrons mediated by phonons does not provide a satisfactory explanation of the properties of strongly - correlated high - temperature superconductors . </S>",
    "<S> theoretical proposals going back many years suggest that electronic excitations might enhance this interaction and thus contribute to the formation of the superconducting condensate  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these proposals appeared to gain some ground with the observation of superconductivity - induced transfer of the optical spectral weight in the cuprate high - temperature superconductors which involves a high - energy scale extending to the visible range of the spectrum  @xcite . in spite of numerous studies ( for a comprehensive list of references </S>",
    "<S> see ref .  ) </S>",
    "<S> no modification of interband optical transitions in the superconducting state has been directly identified in the cuprates . instead , the observed superconductivity - induced anomalies in the optical response of highly conducting @xmath3 planes were found to be confined to the energy range corresponding to transitions within the conduction band below the plasma edge . </S>",
    "<S> these changes are dominated by a narrowing of the broad drude peak caused by superconductivity - induced modification of the scattering rate  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> minute redistribution of the spectral weight between the conducting and high - energy hubbard bands generated by coulomb correlations may also play a role  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> current research on the recently discovered iron - pnictide superconductors  @xcite suggests that electronic correlations are weaker than those in the cuprates . unlike in cuprates , the fermi surface has been reliably determined over the entire phase diagram and shows good agreement with density functional calculations . </S>",
    "<S> the superconducting state of the iron pnictides appears to fit well into a bcs framework in which phonons , which in these compounds interact only weakly with electrons  @xcite , are replaced by spin fluctuations  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the ellipsometric data we present here are consistent with the hypothesis that electronic correlations result in only a modest renormalization of the electronic states . </S>",
    "<S> however , superconductivity - induced optical anomalies involve modification of an absorption band peaked at an energy of @xmath1 , two orders of magnitude larger than the superconducting gap @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast to cuprate superconductors , this high - energy anomaly has a regular lorentzian shape in both the real and imaginary parts of the dielectric function and is confined to energies well above the plasma edge @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> it can be explained as a consequence of non - conservation of the total number of unoccupied states involved in the corresponding optical transitions due to the opening of the superconducting gap . </S>",
    "<S> this implies that unconventional interactions beyond the bcs framework must be considered in models of the superconducting pairing mechanism .    </S>",
    "<S> the measurements were carried out on a single crystal of @xmath6 ( bkfa ) with @xmath7 and superconducting @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> specific - heat measurements on the same sample confirm its high purity and the absence of secondary electronic phases  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we performed direct ellipsometric measurements of the in - plane complex dielectric function @xmath9 over a range of photon energies extending from the far infrared ( @xmath10 ) to the ultraviolet ( @xmath11 ) with subsequent kramers - kronig consistency analysis  ( see supplementary information ) . </S>",
    "<S> the far - infrared optical conductivity , is dominated by the opening of a superconducting gap of magnitude @xmath12 below @xmath13 ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : scinducedcolouring]a ) , in accordance with previous studies of optimally doped bkfa  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the low - energy missing area in the optical conductivity spectrum below @xmath13 , @xmath14 , is contained within @xmath15 and amounts to @xmath16 , equivalent to a london penetration depth of @xmath17   . </S>",
    "<S> the fraction of the missing area below @xmath18 not accessible to the experiment was accurately quantified from the requirement of kramers - kronig consistency of the independently measured real and imaginary parts of the dielectric function .    careful examination of the visible range uncovered superconductivity - induced suppression of an absorption band at @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> figure  [ fig : scinducedcolouring]b shows difference spectra between @xmath19 of the real parts of the optical conductivity and dielectric function . </S>",
    "<S> the suppressed band has a lorentzian lineshape and appears abruptly across the superconducting transition , consistently in both @xmath20 and @xmath21 , as shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : scinducedcolouring]c for @xmath22 . </S>",
    "<S> the temperature dependence of the suppression ( blue open circles ) coincides with that of the far - infrared optical conductivity due to the opening of the superconducting gap ( red filled circles ) . </S>",
    "<S> thus the onset of superconductivity not only modifies the low - energy quasiparticle response , but also affects the overall electronic structure including interband transitions in the visible range of the spectrum . since the spectral - weight ( sw ) loss @xmath23 is not balanced in the vicinity of the absorption band ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : scinducedcolouring]b ) , our data indicate a sw transfer over a wide energy range . </S>",
    "<S> we note that superconductivity - induced modification of the lattice parameters only results in a minute volume change of @xmath24 , which is insufficient to explain the optical anomaly  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a kramers - kronig consistency analysis could not be carried out with sufficient accuracy to show whether or not the sw liberated from the absorption band at the superconducting transition contributes to the response of the superconducting condensate at zero energy . </S>",
    "<S> we did , however , detect a minute rise of the background level of @xmath25 below @xmath13 , which according to the kramers - kronig relation implies that the sw is transferred to energies below @xmath26 . </S>",
    "<S> this effect was identified from a simultaneous fit of @xmath27 and @xmath28  ( horizontal dashed line in the bottom panel of fig .  [ </S>",
    "<S> fig : scinducedcolouring]b ) . </S>",
    "<S> further accurate temperature modulation measurements of @xmath29 and @xmath30 at characteristic energies confirmed a background increase of @xmath31  ( see supplementary information ) .    </S>",
    "<S> since the spectral weight @xmath23 liberated from the absorption band upon cooling below @xmath13 comprises only @xmath32 of the total spectral weight @xmath33 of the superconducting condensate , its contribution to the low - energy charge dynamics might be considered negligible . however , assuming that this additional high - energy sw contributes to the itinerant - carrier response below @xmath13 , a simple estimate in the framework of the tight - binding nearest - neighbour approximation  @xcite shows that this would lead to a reduction of electronic kinetic energy of @xmath34 in the superconducting state  ( see supplementary information ) . </S>",
    "<S> this is close to the condensation energy @xmath35 obtained from specific - heat measurements on the same sample  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it is thus important to establish the origin of this unusual optical anomaly .        </S>",
    "<S> we therefore compared our data to the results of ab - initio electronic structure calculations in the framework of the local density approximation ( lda ) ( figs .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : elstr]a and  [ fig : elstr]b ) . </S>",
    "<S> a dispersion analysis of the the experimental optical conductivity in the range @xmath36 yielded three major interband transitions in @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> comparison to the lda results enabled us to identify the initial and final states of these transitions . </S>",
    "<S> the lowest - energy transition is located at about @xmath37 ( red line ) and stems from intraband @xmath38 and interband @xmath39 to @xmath38 transitions . </S>",
    "<S> the major contribution to the optical response in the visible spectral range comes from transitions starting from @xmath38 or @xmath39 orbitals into strongly hybridized @xmath38 to @xmath39 or @xmath38 orbitals ( green line ) . </S>",
    "<S> finally , the uv absorption comes from higher - energy transitions into @xmath40 states ( blue line ) .    </S>",
    "<S> although the high - energy electronic structure of bkfa is predicted quite well by the lda calculations , the experimental quasiparticle response due to transitions within the conduction band ( or , given the multiorbital structure of iron pnictides , a narrowly - spaced set of conduction bands ) shows a significant deviation . </S>",
    "<S> the discrepancy can be quantified by the squared ratio of the band - structure plasma frequency @xmath41 ( not included in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : elstr]b ) to its experimental counterpart @xmath42 , which can be obtained in practice from the residual optical response , after the interband transitions identified using a dispersion analysis have been subtracted . </S>",
    "<S> this ratio approximates the quasiparticle effective - mass renormalization factor @xmath43 . </S>",
    "<S> such an enhancement is consistent with de  haas - van  alphen and photoemission experiments on other compounds of the 122 family  @xcite and was recently reproduced by combined lda+dmft calculations for both 1111 and 122 compounds  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these calculations do not show evidence of formation of hubbard bands and thus indicate moderate electron - electron correlations . </S>",
    "<S> this explains the good agreement of the lda optical conductivity above @xmath26 with the experimental data .    </S>",
    "<S> now we turn to the physical origin of the superconductivity - suppressed absorption band . </S>",
    "<S> the same lda calculation revealed a set of interband transitions centered at @xmath1 , which originate or terminate in states exhibiting hole dispersion and crossing the fermi level at the @xmath44- and @xmath45-points of the brillouin zone ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : elstr]c ) . </S>",
    "<S> we confidently assign these states to @xmath46 and @xmath47 orbitals . </S>",
    "<S> the other states involved in these transitions belong to @xmath48/@xmath49 hybrid orbitals about @xmath50 below and above the fermi level , giving rise to a bandwidth of @xmath51 , in remarkable agreement with experiment . </S>",
    "<S> suppression of the absorption band over its full width can be explained by redistribution of the occupation of @xmath46 and @xmath47 states under the fermi level below the superconducting transition . </S>",
    "<S> this mechanism is supported by lda calculations in which the density of states within one superconducting gap energy above the fermi level was eliminated  ( see supplementary information ) leading to the observed suppression of the optical transitions shown in cyan in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : elstr]b .    </S>",
    "<S> the required population redistribution is , however , at variance with the conventional theory of superconductivity . in the framework of the standard bcs approach , opening of an energy gap in a single - band superconductor </S>",
    "<S> leads to a bending of the quasiparticle dispersion and an expulsion of the density of states in the vicinity of the fermi surface ( gray and blue areas in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : scinducedcolouring]d )  @xcite and does not lead to population redistribution , i.e. the total number of unoccupied states below the transition is conserved @xmath52 ( blue area is equal to the gray area in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : scinducedcolouring]d ) . </S>",
    "<S> this can only lead to a small corrugation of an optical absorption band on the scale of one superconducting - gap energy superimposed on the overall broad feature without any modification of its spectral weight  @xcite . the experimentally observed suppression of an absorption band _ on the scale of its full width _ necessarily requires population imbalance @xmath53 ( red area unequal to the gray area in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : scinducedcolouring]d ) . </S>",
    "<S> this effect can be clearly identified as a consequence of superconductivity because the temperature dependence of the suppression mimics that of the optical conductivity in the fir region due to the opening of the superconducting gap , as shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : scinducedcolouring]c .    </S>",
    "<S> all of the iron - pnictide superconductors are known to have multiple superconducting gaps  @xcite and theoretical work indicates a dominant contribution of electron pairing between different bands to the formation of the superconducting state  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> redistribution of the occupation of the different bands below @xmath13 could explain the optical anomaly we observed . </S>",
    "<S> it requires a lowering of the material s chemical potential in the superconducting state . </S>",
    "<S> however , even a generalization of the standard bcs theory to the multiband case  @xcite does not take into account this effect . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , self - consistent treatment of a variable chemical potential at the superconducting transition is needed . in the presence of large fe - as bond polarizability  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite it can potentially enhance superconductivity in iron pnictides .        </S>",
    "<S> we have further explored the validity of this scenario by repeating our ellipsometric measurements on parent compounds of the 122 family of iron arsenide superconductors . </S>",
    "<S> since the spin - density - wave ( sdw ) instability exhibited by these compounds is also believed to be induced by nesting of electronic states on different electronic bands , we expect a similar optical anomaly at the sdw transition as the one we observed in the superconductor . </S>",
    "<S> the magnitude of the anomaly is expected to be larger than the one in the superconductor , because the sdw transition occurs at a higher temperature and generates a larger energy gap . in @xmath54 ( sfa ) , we indeed find a strong reduction of optical absorption upon cooling below @xmath55 . </S>",
    "<S> the difference spectra of @xmath56 and @xmath57 between @xmath58 and @xmath59 show a double - peak structure with maxima at @xmath60 and  @xmath61 ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : sfa]a ) . a temperature scan across @xmath62 at the frequency of the second peak ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : sfa]b ) further confirms that this effect is induced by sdw formation . </S>",
    "<S> a direct comparison with the superconducting compound is complicated by a pronounced modification of the electronic structure due to the coincident magnetic and structural transitions . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , certain information can be gained from the critical behavior of the in - plane spectral weight @xmath63 . </S>",
    "<S> figure  [ fig : sfa]c shows difference spectral weight of @xmath54 between @xmath64 and @xmath59 as a function of the upper integration limit @xmath65 . </S>",
    "<S> the change of the sw in the extrapolation region below @xmath18 was accurately determined via a kramers - kronig consistency analysis  ( see supplementary information ) , as illustrated in the inset of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : sfa]c . with @xmath66 across the transition ( </S>",
    "<S> blue filled circle ) the kramers - kronig transformation of the @xmath67 ( blue line ) deviates significantly from experimentally measured @xmath28 . </S>",
    "<S> gradually increasing this sw brings them closer together until they finally coincide ( red line ) thus fixing @xmath68 ( red filled circle ) . the higher - energy redistribution of the sw </S>",
    "<S> is broken down in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : sfa]c into regions of sw gain ( blue areas ) and loss ( red areas ) in the sdw with respect to paramagnetic state . </S>",
    "<S> the sw lost due to the opening of the sdw gap  @xcite ( the first red region ) is partly transferred to the electronic excitations across the gap ( the first blue region ) and fully recovered by @xmath26 . </S>",
    "<S> these processes are then followed by higher - energy redistribution in the region from @xmath69 to @xmath70 involving the sw of the suppressed bands . </S>",
    "<S> it appears unlikely that such high - energy sw transfer could result from modification of the electronic structure due to a magnetic transition because effects of electronic reconstruction at the sdw transition are limited by @xmath26 . </S>",
    "<S> a modification of the matrix elements at the structural transitions of sufficient strength can not account for the observed suppression , because this would be accompanied by an even larger effect at higher energies , clearly absent in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : sfa]c . </S>",
    "<S> a redistribution of charge carriers between the sdw - coupled bands analogous to that in the superconducting compound provides a more natural explanation . </S>",
    "<S> the same physical reasons might explain the orbital polarization that breaks the degeneracy of @xmath71 and @xmath72 orbitals recently observed in the ba - based parent of the same family by photoemission spectroscopy  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> interactions of electrons in different energy bands at the fermi level may provide a common framework for an explanation of the optical anomalies in the spin - density - wave and superconducting compounds . </S>",
    "<S> it is important to note that these anomalies affect only a small fraction of the interband transitions , which involve initial states of as @xmath73-orbital character deep below the fermi level . </S>",
    "<S> this indicates that these orbitals significantly influence electronic instabilities in the iron arsenides , possibly due to the high polarizability of as - fe bonds . </S>",
    "<S> our study points to optical spectral - weight transfer from high energies to below @xmath26 induced by collective electronic instabilities . in the superconductor </S>",
    "<S> , it occurs at energies two orders of magnitude larger than the superconducting gap energy , suggesting that electronic pairing mechanisms contribute to the formation of the superconducting condensate . </S>"
