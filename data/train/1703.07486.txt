    "energy and transferred momentum squared in the collision process , @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "these soft scattering states constitute one of the great challenges for the qcd , because , as a long distance phenomena , its investigation demands a nonperturbative approach and presently , a formal approach from first principles , able to provide @xmath17 , is still absent .    in the forward scattering ,",
    "the elastic amplitude is connected with two important physical observables : the total cross section ( optical theorem ) , @xmath18 and the @xmath1 parameter ( related to the phase of the amplitude ) , @xmath19    a fundamental formal result on the rise of @xmath5 , at asymptotic energies ( @xmath20 ) , is the upper bound by froissart , lukaszuk , martin @xcite @xmath21 where @xmath22 is an unspecified energy scale and the pre - factor on the right - hand side is bounded by @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the pion mass .    beyond specific phenomenological models ,",
    "an important approach in the investigation of @xmath5 and @xmath6 is the forward amplitude analysis , characterized by regge - gribov analytical parametrization for @xmath5 , connected with @xmath6 by means of dispersion relations or asymptotic uniqueness and analytical or numerical methods ( for example , @xcite ) .",
    "a typical behavior emerging from several analyses favors a leading @xmath25 dependence for @xmath5 at the highest energies @xcite . in a nonperturbative qcd approach",
    "this behavior has been also recently predicted under specific conditions @xcite .",
    "some authors have considered a leading @xmath26 dependence , with @xmath4 as a free fit parameter .",
    "different approaches using different datasets indicated @xmath4 = 2.10 @xmath27 0.10 @xcite ( 1977 ) , 2.24@xmath28 @xcite ( 1993 ) and in our more recent analyses , @xmath4 = 2.2 - 2.4 @xcite , with the last updated result @xmath4 = 2.23 @xmath27 0.11 @xcite ( 2013 ) . in the theoretical context ,",
    "the possibility of a rise of @xmath5 faster than @xmath25 , without violating unitarity , is discussed in @xcite .",
    "it should be also noted that eqs .",
    "( 3 - 4 ) are intended for @xmath20 and presently , experimental data from accelerators have been obtained up to @xmath29 8 tev . to a certain extent contrasting with the above @xmath4 values ,",
    "the compas group ( pdg ) has quoted the value 1.98 @xmath27 0.01 @xcite .    in the experimental context , the recent data from lhc7 and lhc8 are expected to provide fundamental information for amplitude analyses .",
    "these new experimental information comprise 11 measurements of @xmath0 , obtained by the totem collaboration ( 4 data at 7 tev , 5 data at 8 tev ) and by the atlas collaboration ( 1 datum at 7 tev and 1 datum at 8 tev ) and one measurement of @xmath1 by the totem collaboration at 8 tev .",
    "all these total cross section data are displayed in table [ t1 ] , where we have expressed as systematic also the uncertainties associated with extrapolations and error propagated from uncertainties in the fit parameters .",
    ".measurements of the @xmath2 total cross section from lhc7 and lhc8 : central value ( @xmath0 ) , statistical uncertainties ( @xmath30 ) , systematic uncertainties ( @xmath31 ) , total uncertainty from quadrature ( @xmath32 ) .",

    "attempting to quantify and investigate the consequences of discrepant measurements of the total cross section by the totem and atlas collaborations , we have developed 6 fits to @xmath0 and @xmath1 data from @xmath2 and @xmath3 scattering in the energy region 5 gev - 8 tev .",
    "we applied the l2 and l@xmath4 models ( section 2 ) to three ensembles : t , a and t+a ( section 3 ) .",
    "the fit results are presented in table [ t2 ] and figures [ f1 ] and [ f2 ] . in what follows",
    "we first refer to the results obtained with ensembles a and t and after that to those obtained with ensemble t+a .",
    "ensembles t and a indicate different scenarios for the rise of @xmath5 , as shown in figures [ f1 ] and [ f2 ] .",
    "these different behaviors can be quantified by two parameters associated with model l@xmath4 ( table [ t2 ] ) : @xmath33 0.10 @xmath27 0.03 mb , @xmath34 2.3 @xmath27 0.1 ( t ) and @xmath33 0.23 @xmath27 0.08 mb , @xmath34 2.0 @xmath27 0.1 ( a ) . from these results",
    "we can infer as extrema bounds for @xmath4 the values 1.9 and 2.4 .",
    "however , with ensembles t or a and models l2 or l@xmath4 , the fits provide @xmath35 1.1 and therefore the results can not be distinguished on statistical grounds .",
    "let us focus now on the experimental data presently available , namely ensemble t+a .",
    "the fit results with models l2 and l@xmath4 are equivalent on statistical grounds : @xmath36 1.15 ( l2 ) and 1.14 ( l@xmath4 ) , or @xmath37 0.06 in both cases . from figures 1 and 2 ( l2 and l@xmath4 )",
    ", the curves within the uncertainty regions lie essencially between the totem and atlas data . at 8 tev",
    ", they reach the lower end of the totem uncertainties and lie above the atlas datum , namely this point is not described by both models .",
    "for example , the results within this ensemble for @xmath0 at 8 tev are 98.58 @xmath27 0.52 mb ( l2 ) and 98.83 @xmath27 0.60",
    "mb ( l@xmath4 ) and the differences between these predictions and the atlas datum , @xmath38 read 2.7 ( l2 ) and 3.0 ( l@xmath4 ) . with model",
    "l2 we obtained @xmath39 0.2451 @xmath27 0.028 mb , which is below the latest pdg value , @xmath40 0.2720 @xmath27 0.048 mb @xcite . with model l@xmath4 , @xmath39 0.151 @xmath27 0.071 mb and @xmath41 2.16 @xmath27 0.16 .",
    "it is interesting to note that this @xmath4-value is in plenty agreement with the result obtained by amaldi et al .",
    ", forty years ago ( data up to 62.5 gev ) , namely @xmath42 2.10 @xmath27 0.10 @xcite .    within each one of the three ensembles ,",
    "all the predictions for @xmath0 at 13 tev with models l2 and l@xmath4 ( tables [ t3 ] and [ t4 ] ) are in agreement within the uncertainties and can not be distinguished . however , the results from distinct ensembles present differences , as illustrated in figure [ f3 ] .    in our l@xmath4 model ( with l2 as a particular case for @xmath4 = 2 ) ,",
    "the _ analytic _ connection between @xmath5 and @xmath6 is obtained through singly subtracted derivative dispersion relations , with the _ effective subtraction constant _ as a free fit parameter .",
    "another analytic way to connect these two quantities is by means of asymptotic uniqueness ( phragmn - lindelff theorems ) @xcite , section 7.1 .",
    "a detailed analysis , confronting these two analytic methods and the corresponding results for @xmath5 and @xmath6 is presented in @xcite .    beyond to provide useful parameters to quantify the different scenarios , the @xmath43 leading term has also an interesting role in what concerns the rate of change of the total cross section . as a function of the variable @xmath44",
    ", the froissart , lukaszuk , martin bound for @xmath45 implies also in two bounds related to the slope ( @xmath46 ) and the curvature ( @xmath47 ) for @xmath20 : linear ( @xmath48 ) and constant ( @xmath49 ) limits , respectively . on the other ,",
    "the leading term predicts : @xmath50 thus allowing detailed investigations on the rate of change of the total cross section at high energies ( not only @xmath20 ) .",
    "for example , at 8 tev and with the l@xmath4 model , the fits with ensembles t and a predict : @xmath51 mb ( t ) and @xmath52 mb ( a ) , indicating a faster rise of @xmath5 from the totem data than from the atlas data .    it is expected that further experimental analyses and the new data from lhc13 might clarify the different points and aspects raised in this work .",
