    "there are two parameters , the cosmological constant @xmath0 and the gravitational constant @xmath1 , present in einstein s field equations . the newtonian constant of gravitation @xmath1 plays the role if a coupling constant between geometry and matter in the einstein s field equations . in an evolving universe , it appears natural to look at this `` constant '' as a function of time .",
    "numerous suggestions based on different arguments have been proposed in the past few decades in which @xmath1 varies with time [ 1 ] .",
    "dirac [ 2 ] proposed a theory with variable @xmath1 motivated by the occurrence of large numbers discovered by weyl , eddington and dirac himself .",
    "+ it is widely believed that the value of @xmath0 was large during the early stages of evolution and strongly influenced its expansion , whereas its present value is incredibly small [ 3 ] .",
    "several authors [ 4 ] have advocated a variable @xmath0 in the framework of einstein s theory to account for this fact .",
    "@xmath0 as a function of time has also been considered in various variable @xmath1 theories in different contexts [ 5 ] .",
    "for these variations , the energy - momentum tensor of matter leaves the form of the einstein s field equations unchanged . + in attempt to modify the general theory of relativity ,",
    "al - rawaf and taha [ 6 ] related the cosmological constant to the ricci scalar @xmath4 .",
    "this is written as a built - in - cosmological constant , i.e. , @xmath5 .",
    "since the ricci scalar contains a term of the form @xmath6 , one adopts this variation for @xmath0 .",
    "we parameterized this as @xmath3 .",
    "similarly , we have chosen another two forms for @xmath7 and @xmath8 ; where @xmath9 is the energy density .",
    "+ recent observations of the luminosity of type ia supernovae indicate [ 7 , 8 ] an accelerated expansion of the universe and lead to the search for a new type of matter which violates the strong energy condition i.e. , @xmath10 .",
    "the matter consent responsible for such a condition to be satisfied at a certain stage of evolution of the universe is referred to as a _",
    "dark energy_. there are different candidates to play the role of the dark energy .",
    "the type of dark energy represented by a scalar field is often called quintessence . the simplest candidate for dark energy",
    "is cosmological constant @xmath0 .",
    "in particular one can try another type of dark energy , the so - called chaplygin gas which obeys an equation of state like [ 9 ] @xmath11 , where @xmath12 and @xmath9 are respectively the pressure and energy density . subsequently the above equation was modified to the form [ 10 ] @xmath13 .",
    "there are some works on modified chapligin gas obeying equation of state [ 11 , 12 ]    @xmath14    in this work we have considered a cosmological model for the cosmological constant of the forms : @xmath3 , @xmath8 and @xmath15 in presence of modified chaplygin gas , with or without the variation of gravitational constant @xmath1 . + in 2003 , v. sahni et al [ 13 ] introduced a pair of parameters @xmath16 , called _ statefinder _ parameters .",
    "the trajectories in the @xmath16 plane corresponding to different cosmological models demonstrate qualitatively different behaviour .",
    "the above statefinder diagnostic pair has the following form :    @xmath17    where @xmath18 and @xmath19 are the hubble parameter and the deceleration parameter respectively .",
    "the new feature of the statefinder is that it involves the third derivative of the cosmological radius .",
    "these parameters are dimensionless and allow us to characterize the properties of dark energy .",
    "trajectories in the @xmath16 plane corresponding to different cosmological models , for example @xmath0cdm model diagrams correspond to the fixed point @xmath20 .",
    "+ the paper is organized as follows : section ii deals with einstein field equations in presence of dynamic cosmological constant @xmath0 . in sections iii and iv we have considered different @xmath0-dependent models without and with variable gravitational constant @xmath1 respectively and shown various stages of the evolution of the universe for these models using statefinder parameters .",
    "we have taken some particular values of the proportionality constants for the graphical representations .",

    "thus we get the value of @xmath208 to be lesser than the previous works [ 5 , 14 ] . again considering @xmath1 to be time - dependent , we get the same values of the parameters as that with @xmath1 constant ,",
