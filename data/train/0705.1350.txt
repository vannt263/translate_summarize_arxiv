    "<S> building on the well - known unruh - davies effect , we examine the effects of projective measurements and quantum communications between accelerated and stationary observers . we find that the projective measurement by a uniformly accelerated observer can excite real particles from the vacuum in the inertial frame , even if no additional particles are created by the measurement process in the accelerating frame . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , we show that the particles created by this accelerating measurement can be highly entangled in the inertial frame , and it is also possible to use this process to generate even maximally entangled two - qubit states by a certain arrangement of measurements . as a byproduct of our analysis </S>",
    "<S> , we also show that a single qubit of information can be perfectly transmitted from the accelerating observer to the inertial one . in principle </S>",
    "<S> , such an effect could be exploited in designing an entangled state generator for quantum communication .    </S>",
    "<S> it has become well - known in the thirty years since the discovery of the unruh - davies effect that the concept of particle is dependent on an observer s state of motion @xcite , somewhat analogous to the way in which distance and time become dependent on an observer s state of motion , with the introduction of special relativity . in the unruh - davies effect , </S>",
    "<S> unitarily evolving particle detectors will respond to the same inertial quantum vacuum state in very different ways , depending on the acceleration of the detectors . following this surprising result , </S>",
    "<S> a great deal has been written regarding its implications for quantum field theory in particular and physics in general @xcite , with the debates sometimes centering on what is meant by the reality of the unruh particles , or invoking different starting assumptions and arguments that lead to similar results @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the unruh - davies effect itself is a statement about the unitary transformation of the quantum vacuum between independent observers , and does not take into account the effects of communication between stationary and accelerated observers , or the effects of non - unitary projective measurements occurring between the reference frames . </S>",
    "<S> these might seem to be important concepts for comparing the different experiences of the different quantum observers . </S>",
    "<S> recently , however , some interesting ideas have begun to emerge in the field of relativistic quantum information and quantum entanglement studying well - known staples such as quantum teleportation in the context of accelerating observers @xcite .    here </S>",
    "<S> we continue to develop this approach , and analyze the effects of projective measurement on unruh particles in an accelerating frame , combined with the communication of the result ( via a purely quantum communication channel ) to an inertial observer . </S>",
    "<S> remarkably , we find that such projective measurements in the accelerating frame can create real particles in the inertial frame  _ even if no additional particles are created by the measurement process in the accelerating frame . </S>",
    "<S> _ by this , we explicitly mean the following : if we have two independent observers in the vacuum , one at rest and the other in uniform acceleration , the projective measurements made by the accelerating observer will create particles detectable by the inertial observer  she effectively gains access to real particles via measurements on what was initially nothing . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , if some certain projective measurements are chosen by the accelerated observer ( e.g. measuring the particle number ) , we have found that the inertial frame particles generated by accelerated measurement are always highly entangled , representing a generator for entanglement resources  all available simply by measuring the vacuum .        in the following analysis , we consider the linear - optical case and neglect the photon polarization , so that we are effectively concentrating our discussion on a massless scalar field . however , all of our discussions and results can be straightforwardly applied to the the case of photons with polarization . before jumping into the details of the calculation </S>",
    "<S> , we first outline the physical process involved :    the processes we propose can be set up by two observers together with their associated detectors . one observer ( alice ) </S>",
    "<S> is inertial while the other one ( bob ) is uniformly accelerating with acceleration @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> the fock spaces associated with each of them are denoted by @xmath1 and @xmath2 respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the initial state is the vacuum state of standard quantum field theory @xmath3 , where alice sits . </S>",
    "<S> then bob makes a standard von - neumann projective measurement on the photon number of any single mode @xmath4 and gets an activation of his detector via the unruh - davies effect . from the collapse of quantum state </S>",
    "<S> , alice will see photon creation in her frame and , we will show that the photons created in the inertial frame are always entangled between certain different modes .    </S>",
    "<S> we analyze the effect in 3 + 1-dimensional minkowski spacetime . </S>",
    "<S> first of all , the world - line of bob in the right wedge ( region i ) is generated by the time - like vector field @xmath5\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath0 is the acceleration and @xmath6 are global inertial coordinates . </S>",
    "<S> hence we can construct a quantum field theory in region i using @xmath7 as the time translation vector , and also in region ii by using @xmath8 since @xmath7 is past - directed in region ii . </S>",
    "<S> then we have the well - known bogoliubov transformation @xcite : @xmath9,\\nonumber\\\\ va^{ii}_{\\omega}v^{-1}&=&(1-e^{-\\frac{2\\pi\\omega}{a}})^{1/2}[b'_{\\omega}+e^{-\\frac{\\pi\\omega}{a}}b^\\dagger_{\\omega}],\\label{bogoliubov}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the operator @xmath10 is the s - matrix connecting the bosonic fock space of bob to the bosonic fock space of alice . </S>",
    "<S> then @xmath11 ( @xmath12 ) operating on @xmath13 is the annihilation operator associated with the solution @xmath14 ( @xmath15 ) to the klein - gordon equation , which vanishes in region ii ( region i ) and oscillates harmonically with frequency @xmath16 with respect to the accelerating time translation . </S>",
    "<S> and @xmath15 are a basis of normalized wavepackets of positive frequency solutions , whose frequencies are peaked sharply about @xmath17 ( see e.g. refs @xcite ) . ] </S>",
    "<S> the annihilation operators @xmath18 and @xmath19 on @xmath20 are associated with the one - photon states @xmath21 , \\nonumber\\\\ \\mathrm{and } \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\psi'_\\omega&=&(1-e^{-\\frac{2\\pi\\omega}{a}})^{1/2}[\\psi^{ii}_{\\omega}+e^{-\\frac{\\pi\\omega}{a}}{\\psi^{i*}_{\\omega}}],\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] respectively .    following the derivation of unruh - davies effect </S>",
    "<S> , we can express the standard minkowski vacuum state @xmath22 as a quantum state in @xmath13 , which can be detected by bob @xcite </S>",
    "<S> @xmath23\\ |0\\rangle_b\\label{unruhstate}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath24 is the overall normalization constant and @xmath25 is the vacuum state in the accelerating frame .    </S>",
    "<S> suppose that bob in region i measures the photon number on an arbitrary frequency @xmath4 and obtains the number @xmath26 . </S>",
    "<S> then the state will be projected to the component which has the photon number distribution @xmath27 on the frequency @xmath4 , since the experimental results in region i and region ii are correlated in the sense of eq.([unruhstate ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> the resultant state after his measurement is denoted by @xmath28 with the expression : @xmath29^{m}\\nonumber\\\\ & & \\prod_{\\omega\\neq\\omega_1}\\bigg[\\sum_{n_\\omega=0}^{\\infty}\\frac{1}{n_\\omega!}\\big(e^{-\\frac{\\pi\\omega}{a } } a^{i\\dagger}_{\\omega}a^{ii\\dagger}_{\\omega}\\big)^{n_\\omega}\\bigg]\\ |0\\rangle_b,\\label{phi'}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we have renormalized the state by the factor @xmath30 </S>",
    "<S> .    then we switch back to the inertial frame to figure out what alice obtains . recall that the s - matrix @xmath31 makes the connection between the fock spaces of bob and alice , </S>",
    "<S> so after bob finishes his work , alice should have the state @xmath32 . </S>",
    "<S> since the terms in eq.([phi ] ) , with respect to the frequency @xmath4 and other frequencies are factorized , one can see from eq.([unruhstate ] ) that all the components with respect to the frequencies @xmath33 will be transformed back to be the vacuum state . </S>",
    "<S> after some calculations for the bogoliubov transformation , we obtain @xmath34 where @xmath35 and the number state @xmath36 means that there are @xmath37 and @xmath38 inertial frame photons in the modes @xmath39 and @xmath40 respectively . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , we can see that alice obtains real photons , since bob s projective measurements have modified the original state . </S>",
    "<S> a simple way to view this effect can be given as follows . </S>",
    "<S> in the standard unruh - davies effect the inertial vacuum is unitarily transformed into a thermal bath eq.([unruhstate ] ) for the accelerating observer . since </S>",
    "<S> any unitary transformation is uniquely invertible  _ only _ a thermal bath in the accelerated frame transforms back to an inertial vacuum . </S>",
    "<S> once the accelerating observer makes a measurement , he destroys the purely thermal nature of the field . </S>",
    "<S> hence , it should not be surprising that when the collapsed thermal field is transformed back , that the inertial observer no longer sees vacuum . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , one can check the non - separability of the state eq.([result1 ] ) via the positive partial transpose ( ppt ) criterion @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the partial transposed density matrix @xmath41 is obtained from @xmath42 by @xmath43 , so it can be expressed as : @xmath44 up to a normalization constant . </S>",
    "<S> it can be checked straightforwardly by definition that the operator @xmath41 is not non - negative , i.e. @xmath45 fails to be non - negative for all @xmath46 in its fock space , so @xmath41 must have a negative eigenvalue . </S>",
    "<S> thus by the ppt criterion , the photon state eq.([result1 ] ) is non - separable between the two modes @xmath39 and @xmath40 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore bell s inequality should be violated since it is a pure state . </S>",
    "<S> so the inertial frame photons generated by the accelerating measurement is in an entangled state . </S>",
    "<S> the entanglement is between the photon numbers in the modes @xmath39 and @xmath40 .    </S>",
    "<S> moreover , if we suitable arrange the projective measurements and properly design a quantum communication protocol , it is even possible for us to obtain an almost maximally entangled two - qubit state ( epr state ) in the inertial frame , which is suitable for use in quantum cryptography @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> first let s recall the accelerating projective measurement made by bob . </S>",
    "<S> however , instead of measuring a single frequency as before , we let bob measure the photon numbers for two different frequencies @xmath4 and @xmath47 and obtain @xmath48 and @xmath49 respectively . </S>",
    "<S> then the corresponding projected state @xmath28 changes to @xmath29^{m_1}\\frac{1}{m_2!}\\big[e^{-\\frac{\\pi\\omega_2}{a } } a^{i\\dagger}_{\\omega_2}a^{ii\\dagger}_{\\omega_2}\\big]^{m_2}\\nonumber\\\\ & & \\prod_{\\omega\\neq\\omega_1,\\omega_2}\\bigg[\\sum_{n_\\omega=0}^{\\infty}\\frac{1}{n_\\omega!}\\big(e^{-\\frac{\\pi\\omega}{a } } a^{i\\dagger}_{\\omega}a^{ii\\dagger}_{\\omega}\\big)^{n_\\omega}\\bigg]\\ |0\\rangle_b.\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] when we switch back to alice s frame , it is also clear that alice s vacuum is excited , and the photons in the inertial frame are created by bob s accelerating measurement . </S>",
    "<S> the expression for the inertial frame photon state is obtained via the bogoliubov transformation in the same way as we did before : @xmath50 since the terms with respect to @xmath4 and @xmath47 are completely factorized , eq.([result2 ] ) essentially is a tensor product of two versions of eq.([result1 ] ) with different modes . </S>",
    "<S> ( obviously , if bob measures photon numbers of @xmath51 frequencies , alice will obtain a @xmath51-fold tensor product of eq.([result1 ] ) . ) </S>",
    "<S> so our previous observation of entanglement is also applied to the photon state , eq.([result2 ] ) , in which the entanglement not only takes place between the modes @xmath39 and @xmath40 , but also between @xmath52 and @xmath53 . on the other hand </S>",
    "<S> , one can rewrite the expression of eq.([result2 ] ) to be a linear combination of the photon number basis : @xmath54 where the number state @xmath55 means that there are @xmath37 photons in the mode @xmath39 , @xmath38 photons in the mode @xmath52 , @xmath56 photons in the mode @xmath40 , and @xmath57 photons in the mode @xmath53 .    </S>",
    "<S> given the initial photon state generated by the accelerating measurement , one may perform some selections on it to obtain some more interesting quantum states . </S>",
    "<S> for example , we let alice make one more projective measurement on the total photon number . </S>",
    "<S> if the result of the measurement is two , eq.([result3 ] ) is projected to its two photon component , which is a two - qubit entangled state : @xmath58(\\omega_2)k^{m_1}_{00}(\\omega_1)|0,1;0,1\\rangle_a,\\label{output}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which are non - separable and entangled as is easily shown from the positive partial transpose criterion . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , one may notice that the coefficients in the above state are different only up to a simple switch of labels between 1 and 2 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , eq.([output ] ) is almost a maximally entangled epr state when the following two conditions are satisfied : ( i ) bob detects the same number @xmath59 for the two different frequencies @xmath4 and @xmath47 may be read from eq.([unruhstate ] ) . ] and ( ii ) the difference between @xmath4 and @xmath47 is sufficiently small , or effectively , bob s acceleration @xmath0 is sufficiently large . however , in the above processes of generating entangled two photonic qubits , alice may need to clarify the degree of entanglement for the resultant state @xmath60 , in order to properly use them </S>",
    "<S> . then she should know from bob his acceleration , the value of the frequencies , and how many photons in each frequency . </S>",
    "<S> so a channel of information flow from bob to alice is necessary in the application . </S>",
    "<S> such a one - way information flow can be realized by the signal photons created from bob in his frame on the background of thermal spectrum , eq.([unruhstate ] ) , because a qubit of information can always be perfectly transfered from bob to alice via a signal photon with frequency @xmath61 , i.e. when bob creates a signal photon in his frame , by the transformation : @xmath62 alice always receives the signal without any degradation due to the thermal spectrum of photons in the accelerating frame @xcite . and </S>",
    "<S> the qubit of information carried by the signal photon is invariant under the bogoliubov transformation between the two reference frames .    at last </S>",
    "<S> , we conclude our discussion by noting a few interesting implications of this effect : + ( i ) since the particle interpretation depends on the observer s state of motion , the above effect suggests that the interpretation of a projective measurement on a particle should also depend on the observer s state of motion . </S>",
    "<S> although it seems counter intuitive that particle creation should be a result of making a projective measurement of particle number , the analysis above is exactly a demonstration of such a phenomenon . </S>",
    "<S> the detector does not create any new particles in its own reference frame ( it simply measures particles already present ) , but it does create particles in another reference frame , and the observers in the other frame are perfectly free to detect and use them in every real sense . since the created inertial frame particles are always highly entangled , our scheme is a generator of entangled resources . </S>",
    "<S> + ( ii ) it should be noted that after the projective measurements made by the accelerating observer , we not only have physical photons in the inertial frame , but we also obtain a non - zero energy - momentum tensor of the quantum field , in contrast to the vanishing energy - momentum tensor of the original vacuum state . </S>",
    "<S> thus one can see that the accelerated projective measurement is really a process of _ emitting _ energy and momentum  and thus the act of measurement acquires an additional input of energy from the accelerating agent . </S>",
    "<S> + ( iii ) it is also remarkable that the proposed quantum - optical - signal communication can perfectly transmit a qubit of information from the accelerating observer to the inertial observer , simply by creating a single - photon qubit over the thermal background of unruh particles , eq.([unruhstate ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> however , the reverse qubit transmission from the inertial observer to the accelerating observer is not a satisfactory means of communication , since the accelerating detector can be activated even when no qubits have been sent by the inertial observer @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this was not a problem for our analysis , of course , because we only consider a one - way flow of information from the accelerating frame to the inertial frame . </S>"
