    "academics , as opposed to researchers , are defined by the requirement to teach .",
    "some take it up as a necessary burden , others as a high calling . in either case , they are faced with pedagogical questions that were ancient long before hippocrates instructed his students beneath a tree . a considerable amount of time and energy",
    "is spent pondering and discussing issues such as learning , concepts , technique , theory , practice , and so on .",
    "but while remaining the subject of intense speculation most of these introspections and discussions revolve around hypotheticals and anecdotes .",
    "it is for this reason that nobel laureate carl wieman , who joined stanford university as both a physicist and an educationist , has been calling attention to the need for scientists to bring the scientific method to bear upon the art of pedagogy.@xcite this involves using data gathering and analysis to come up with better ways to teach physics to students.@xcite    assessment , or examination , forms an integral part of teaching , and consequently is a hotly debated issue in pedagogy .",
    "it is widely accepted that teaching without some means of gauging how much a student has learned is a disservice to both the teacher and the taught",
    ". that still leaves a great deal of room for discussion on how to effectively assess student proficiency in any subject .",
    "it is in this context that this paper focuses on a technique for analyzing the relative efficacy of various assessment techniques with regards to conceptual understanding .",
    "put simply , this paper presents in detail the application of a relatively simple technique which allows a teacher to judge how effective certain common * types * of questions are when it comes to judging the conceptual understanding of students .",
    "the data so collected and analyzed allows a teacher to come up with a more effective means of assessment , and to do so based on hard data rather than hypotheticals and anecdotal evidence .",
    "the technique is presented using a case - study , a carefully constructed three - part question asked in a mid - term examination , which was dissected and the students responses analyzed to gauge the efficacy of three different types of questions .",
    "the case - study consisted of a carefully constructed three - part question which was made part of a mid - term examination taken by 28 students of a third semester undergraduate class majoring in electronics .",
    "the course was titled `` circuit theory '' and the question dealt with the topic of resistor networks consisting exclusively of resistors combined in series and parallel .",
    "series and parallel combinations of resistors is a topic covered in most high - school physics courses and then again in undergraduate courses studied by physics , electronics , and electrical engineering majors , amongst others . despite being a fairly accessible topic it",
    "can be considered significant since it has immediate practical applications ( house - hold appliances can be modeled as resistive networks ) and utilizes several important concepts such as mathematical modeling , and the modular and inductive approach to problem solving .    the question was divided in to three parts .",
    "these parts were each of different * types*. the students responses were graded very carefully and scores were assigned and recorded separately for each part .",
    "these scores were then used in our analysis .",
    "the three different types of questions that we analyzed and compared in this case - study are as follows .",
    "binary questions are of the limited response type , referred to in some locales as `` objective '' questions , of which the most common example is the dreaded mcq .",
    "a binary question consists of a short statement which can be true or false .",
    "the student must simply indicate which it is . although used extensively because of the time - saving it offers to both the student and the grader , it suffers from the short - coming of encouraging , or at least allowing , guessing on the students part .",
    "this type of question asks the student to respond with a few sentences , hence the name `` subjective '' question in certain locales . by asking the students to provide their ( subjective ) justification for coming up with an answer descriptive questions allow for significant access to the conceptual understanding of a student ( the greatest , by far , of the three types of questions ) .",
    "they suffer , however , from being strongly dependent on the students language skills and needing greater effort on the part of the grader .",
    "the most common type of question asked in technical fields , it asks a student to carry out a detailed calculation to arrive at an answer .",
    "it is believed that answering such a question requires a certain level of conceptual understanding as well as a knowledge of problem - solving techniques .",
    "this type requires the most seminal application of diverse skills and is closest to what a practitioner will be required to do in the real - world .",
    "however , the very diversity of skills required makes it a poor test of particular concepts .",
    "designing the question is the most crucial part of this technique and requires the greatest amount of care .",
    "one can extract useful information only if the question is appropriate in nature .",
    "the question asked was :    ' '' ''    @l x@ * q.3 * & consider the following resistor network .",
    "solve the first two parts * without * calculating the equivalent / net resistance @xmath0 of the network .",
    "a.   is @xmath1 ?",
    "justify your answer .",
    "b.   is @xmath2 ?",
    "justify your answer .",
    "c.   calculate @xmath0 .",
    "@xmath3 $ ]    ' '' ''    answering the question requires knowledge of two simple facts , namely , when two resistors are connected in series ( parallel ) they can be reduced to a single equivalent resistor using the formulae : @xmath4    these formulae can be used iteratively ( inductively ) to solve any network , no matter how complex , that consists exclusively of series and parallel combinations of resistors , such as the one provided in the question .",
    "the first two parts of the question are based on a simple concept .",
    "it is clear from eq . that when two resistors are in series the net ( equivalent ) resistance is always * greater * than either while when resistors are in parallel the net resistance is always * less*.    parts ( i ) and ( ii ) require students to make use of this concept .",
    "the question instructs the students to attempt these first two parts without calculating the final answer .",
    "it forces them to pause and think about the circuit before diving head - first in to a familiar computation .",
    "apart from the need to assess students understanding of the concept the question aims to teach students an invaluable lesson : one should use simple logic and an understanding of the underlying concept(s ) to build up an expectation about the answer before one attempts a lengthy computation .    in this case",
    "the entire circuit can first be viewed as the resistor in * series * with the rest of the circuit which can be modeled as an unknown resistor @xmath5 ( fig .",
    "[ fig_series ] ) . then , from eq . , it is immediately clear that the net resistance @xmath6 since @xmath7 is guaranteed ( resistances are always positive , another concept the student should be familiar with ) .    next , one views the circuit as the resistor in series with a * parallel * combination of the resistor and the rest of the circuit ( modeled as @xmath8 , fig .",
    "[ fig_parallel ] ) .",
    "then , from eq . , the parallel combination must have a resistance less than , which in series with the resistor means @xmath9 .     simplified parallel circuit , scaledwidth=90.0% ]     simplified parallel circuit , scaledwidth=90.0% ]    by applying this logic the student should realize before ever calculating it that @xmath10 . consequently ,",
    "if the student should make a mistake in ( the computational ) part ( iii ) that results in an answer outside this range they will immediately become aware of it .",
    "this , the last part of the question , is * computational * in nature and seeks to assess whether students are capable of using the formulae in an iterative fashion to simplify the resistive network to a single equivalent resistance .",
    "the student must use eq .",
    "seven times to successively simplify the circuit by combining two resistors at a time from the right hand side to get the final answer .",
    "points were deducted for mistakes in any of these steps and failure to write units for the final answer .      parts ( i ) and",
    "( ii ) are divided in to two halves when it comes to evaluation .",
    "the first half consists of the simple yes or no questions of the * binary * type .",
    "while evaluating this half , points are awarded ( one per part ) simply based on the result with no regard to the explanation given , just as if no explanation was asked for .",
    "the second half consists of the demand for justification for the answers given .",
    "this makes it a * descriptive * type of question where the response must consist of a few sentences that gives subjective insight in to the students conceptual understanding of the problem and the thought process behind arriving at the result .",
    "this half must be graded carefully , making allowance for the students language skills , or lack thereof .    in this particular case - study although english was officially the medium of instruction it was not the students first language .",
    "a few excerpts will show that this issue can be overcome without significantly comprising the assessment .",
    "28 students sat for the exam .",
    "table [ subset_data ] contains the scores awarded to each of the three parts to a representative selection of 3 students giving a feel for the raw data.@xcite     c * 3c10em & binary & descriptive & computational + & ( max 2 ) & ( max 2 ) & ( max 4 ) + 1 & @xmath11 & @xmath11 & @xmath12 + 2 & @xmath13 & @xmath13 & @xmath11 + 3 & @xmath14 & @xmath15 & @xmath16 +    figure [ bar_plots ] summarizes the scores earned by the students in the three parts of the question as well as their total scores .",
    "while this provides useful data , particularly suited to assessing the distribution of scores across the student population , the relative efficacy of the three types of questions can only be judged by analyzing the correlations between student responses to them .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]      reproduced below are a few representative responses to the descriptive question , presented as the students handed them in , warts and all .",
    "unfortunately , the students hand - writing could not be reproduced digitally .",
    "first , a response that earned full points .",
    "yes @xmath17 because net resistance except is a number which we will add in to calculate equilant resistance of whole circuit that s why when any number is added in it will be greater the .",
    "no @xmath18 bcz net resistance of circuit except and is a number and and are in series when net resistance will be add in + net rest . then the sum is less than and then this sum is added in so it will not reach bcz it is less than .",
    "next we have the response of a student who was successful in both the binary and computational parts but not so in the descriptive portion .",
    "yes @xmath0 is greater than because @xmath0 is equivalent of this whole circuit and there are many resistances in this circuit .",
    "@xmath0 is not greater than because the sum of and is .",
    "so @xmath0 should not be greater than .",
    "this response received 0.5 points out of 2 .",
    "the first statement is nearly incoherent while the second one skates close to the answer without ever arriving at it .",
    "put together they betray significant conceptual weakness .",
    "the final sample response is of a student who fared poorly in all three parts .",
    "the underlined words are the ones added over the struck - out words .",
    "[ line - through]*yes * , @xmath0 is [ line - through]*greater * than because the circuit shows series - parallel resistence and @xmath0 is [ line - through]*greater * than .",
    "no , @xmath0 is not greater than .",
    "this student arrived at an answer of for the computational part ( as compared to the correct answer of ) .",
    "it is obvious by studying the struck out parts that the changes were made after this erroneous result was arrived upon . rather than question the computational result on the basis of the reasoning used for the descriptive response the student chose to overwrite the response to fit with the arrived upon result .",
    "an unfortunate inversion of the expectation - based approach to problem - solving that was the purpose of this question . nonetheless , a fascinating insight in to the thinking process of the student which would have been totally inaccessible if simply the binary and/or computational questions had been asked .",
    "analysis required that the data be transformed in to a manageable and useful form . to that end",
    "we transformed the student data in to boolean , stating for each student whether she succeeded ( true ) or failed ( false ) in answering a certain part .",
    "this was accomplished by thresholding the data .",
    "a careful look at the answers suggested that any response that earned _ greater than or equal to 75% _ of the maximum points be considered as successful .",
    "accordingly , true and false values were assigned to three `` events '' b , d , and c , corresponding to successfully answering the binary , descriptive , and computational parts respectively .",
    "table [ subset_binary_data ] shows the transformation for the subset of data given in table [ subset_data ] .",
    "c * 3c10em * 3c3em & binary & descriptive & computational & b & d & c + 1 & @xmath11 & @xmath11 & @xmath12 & t & t & t + 2 & @xmath13 & @xmath13 & @xmath11 & f & f & f + 3 & @xmath14 & @xmath15 & @xmath16 & t & f & t +",
    "with the data collected and cast in to boolean form corresponding to the events b , d , and c ( defined in section [ boolean_data ] ) the analysis is straight - forward .      by counting one can calculate the frequency of an event being true .",
    "dividing this by the total number of students gives the empirical probability of the event being true.@xcite for instance , @xmath19 ( where @xmath20 is the number of students who successfully answered the binary question ) gives the empirical probability of a randomly selected student having successfully answered the binary question .",
    "this probability gives insight in to how well the students answered the question .    with the raw collected data stored in a csv",
    "file the transformation to boolean form and the calculation of probabilities was carried out using the open - source software r.@xcite the calculations , however , are straight - forward and can be performed in any spreadsheet program ( libreoffice calc or ms excel for example ) or even brute - forced by hand .",
    "the calculated empirical probabilities are given in table [ prob ] .",
    "* 3c3em @xmath21 & @xmath22 & @xmath23 + @xmath24 & @xmath25 & @xmath26 +    the students had the highest rate of success with the binary question , with ( approximately ) 64% of the students answering it successfully . that this success is in part because of guessing on the part of the students is accepted as a rule of thumb .",
    "we will see what the data has to say about it .",
    "57% of the students answered the computational question correctly ( earning @xmath27 75% of the maximum score ) .",
    "this means more than half the class were able to solve problems using a computational / algorithmic approach .",
    "once again the data will reveal how much of this computational ability correlates with conceptual understanding .",
    "finally , only 18% of the students were able to correctly answer the descriptive question .",
    "this revealed an unfortunate lack of true conceptual understanding of series and parallel resistor networks in a vast majority of the students .",
    "given the three events ( b , d , and c ) one can use counting to calculate the empirical probability of the intersection of events , such as the probability , @xmath28 , of a student successfully answering both the binary and the descriptive questions . table [ intersection ] contains the intersection probabilities for the three events .    *",
    "4c7em @xmath28 & @xmath29 & @xmath30 & @xmath31 + @xmath25 & @xmath32 & @xmath25 & @xmath25 +    the interesting detail one can ascertain from this data is that @xmath33 .",
    "the reason for this will become clear in the next section .      the most useful information can be derived by calculating and studying the conditional probabilities between the events . the conditional probability is given by@xcite @xmath34 which gives the probability of the event b occurring * given * that event d has already occurred . in the context of this analysis",
    ", @xmath35 tells us that of all the students who successively answered the descriptive question what fraction * also * answered the binary question correctly .",
    "the conditional probabilities were calculated by plugging the simple and intersection probabilities ( tables [ prob ] and [ intersection ] ) into eq . and are outlined in table [ conditional ] .    *",
    "4c7em @xmath35 & @xmath36 & @xmath37 & @xmath38 + @xmath39 & @xmath39 & @xmath40 & @xmath41 +    @xmath42 means of all the students who successfully answered the descriptive question 100% ( all ) of them also successively answered both the binary and computational questions .",
    "it is for this reason that we observed @xmath33 .",
    "this is a quantitative piece of evidence supporting that most dearly held belief of teachers everywhere , _",
    "if you learn the concept you will be able to answer any question based on the concept_.    @xmath43 means of all the students who correctly answered the binary question only 27% were able to answer the descriptive question .",
    "this indicates that the binary question is * not * a good type of question for ascertaining the conceptual understanding of a student .",
    "the low value can also be attributed to the possibility that binary questions are susceptible to guessing . as such they allow a student with poor conceptual understanding to still answer correctly .",
    "@xmath44 means of all the students who correctly answered the computational question only 31% were able to answer the descriptive question .",
    "it indicates that , like the binary question , the computational question is * not * a good type of question for ascertaining the conceptual understanding of a student ( although it is slightly better at it ) .",
    "this was the most surprising and disturbing result since it revealed that 69% of the students , while lacking proper conceptual understanding of the topic , were nonetheless able to carry out a fairly detailed computation based upon it .",
    "this is indicative of a superficial understanding which while sufficient for some practical purposes severely limits a student s ability to achieve the desired expertise in the subject .",
    "the objective of the analysis was to determine the relative efficacy of different types of questions ( binary , descriptive , and computational ) with regards to assessing students conceptual understanding of any given topic .",
    "the first step was to carefully design three questions ( actually three parts of the same question , hence inextricably linked together ) corresponding to the three types .",
    "these questions were made part of an examination taken by 28 students .",
    "the responses were scored carefully and the data collected for analysis .",
    "each response was evaluated to have been successful if it scored @xmath27 75% of the maximum points .",
    "having transformed the data in to three events b , d , and c ( corresponding to successfully answering the binary , descriptive , and computational question ) we calculated the corresponding empirical probabilities and the conditional probabilities of answering one type of question * given * that the student had already successfully answered another type of question .",
    "the conditional probabilities turned out to be an excellent tool for judging the relative efficacy of various types of questions when it came to assessing students conceptual understanding .",
    "efficacy was judged by comparing the response to the descriptive question with the response to the other two types of questions .",
    "the particular case - study carried out in this instance revealed that all students who successfully answered the descriptive questions ( thereby demonstrating conceptual prowess ) were able to answer the other two types of questions .",
    "conversely , however , ( based on the quantitative analysis - conditional probabilities ) success in answering the binary and computational questions turned out to be an unreliable indicator for judging conceptual competence .",
    "in fact , the data revealed that the majority of students who were able to answer the computational ( and binary ) questions did so without thorough conceptual understanding ."
