    "@xmath57 we observed a linear behaviour leading to a large @xmath42 ( i.e. @xmath58@xmath46 ) , but at low temperatures @xmath56 we found no signature of magnetricity and could not obtain reliable linear fits to the @xmath6 data or physically acceptable values for @xmath42 .",
    "we can draw a number of important conclusions from our work .",
    "our results indicate that at higher temperatures , as suggested previously  @xcite , the dominant contribution to the @xmath31 signal arises from stray fields from the magnetized spin ice that penetrate into the silver sample plate .",
    "the observation of a signal in a sample covered with thick ag foil adds weight to this hypothesis .",
    "the sample coverage of the ag backing plates used in our experiments was always approximately 50%",
    ". it will be interesting to explore how this signal changes as this coverage is varied",
    ". it may also be important to consider the ratio between the surface area and the volume of the spin ice in these and other experiments .",
    "differences between the bulk and surface conductivity of water ice are well documented  @xcite and it is likely that analogous processes operate in spin ice . in reply to the comments on their work , however , bramwell _ et al_.  @xcite make the point that a signal from muons implanted in the sample plate may not negate the important findings of their study .",
    "our data are consistent with the suggestion made in ref .  @xcite that the wien effect signal may arise from inside the sample or from within the ag sample plate but at distances very close to the spin ice sample surface",
    ". we will return to this point later .",
    "first we note that the @xmath31 curve for pure @xmath0  follows closely the form expected for the magnetization of pure spin ice  @xcite supporting the view that @xmath31 reflects the magnetization in all the samples studied .",
    "this then raises an interesting question concerning the low - temperature magnetic dynamics of spin ice .",
    "recently there have been a number of experimental reports on the magnetic dynamics of spin ice ( see for example  @xcite ) .",
    "in addition to the discussion of magnetic monopoles and the wien effect  @xcite authors have also considered the effects of thermal quenching  @xcite .",
    "a key component of the current theories of spin ice , is that the magnetic response at low temperatures and small applied fields is limited to monopole motion .",
    "so as the monopole density decreases the characteristic time scales become longer .",
    "this view has recently been called into question following new low - temperature ac susceptibility measurements that exhibit an activated behaviour with energy barriers that are inconsistent with the present understanding of monopoles in spin ice  @xcite . our results for the @xmath35 material , showing the survival of zfcw - fcc splitting in a sample with",
    "only 15% ho add a further twist to this puzzle . given the large number of non - magnetic  defects \" on the corners of many of the tetrahedra in this diluted material , it is not easy to attribute the slow relaxation to a low monopole density .",
    "at such low concentrations of magnetic ions even the concepts of a spin ice and monopoles are questionable .",
    "it is conceivable that single ion physics plays a more important role in the behaviour of the diluted materials .",
    "our diffuse neutron - scattering studies of single - crystal ho@xmath1y@xmath2ti@xmath3o@xmath4  showed that at low temperature the scattering patterns are characteristic of a dipolar spin ice and appear to be unaffected by y doping up to at least @xmath59  @xcite .",
    "one possible scenario is that effects , such as distortions in the local environment due to the variation in the size of the ho@xmath10/y@xmath10 ions  @xcite , produce energy barriers at low-@xmath32 that exceed the cost of an isolated monopole .",
    "the slow dynamics and the zfcw - fcc hysteresis at low temperatures would thus cross over from a regime where this behaviour is attributed to low monopole density to a regime where it is due to exceedingly slow single ion physics .",
    "alternatively , the long - range nature of the dipolar interactions may give rise to collective effects beyond the monopole description which introduce new energy barriers to spin flipping at very low temperatures that occur in both undiluted and diluted systems .",
    "the same qualitative form for the @xmath31 data for samples with @xmath36 and 1.6 indicate that additional ingredients may be required to explain the low @xmath32 behaviour in spin ice and that further studies on diluted samples are needed to fully understand the role played by factors such as impurities , dislocations , and surface effects on the low - temperature dynamics of spin ice .    returning to the question of magnetricity in spin ice we note that in our @xmath11sr data the low - temperature signal that has previously been interpreted as a signature of magnetricity is seen in the @xmath5 and 0.1 samples and",
    "is not observed in the more dilute ho@xmath1y@xmath2ti@xmath3o@xmath4  materials . within the @xmath32 range indicated by the dashed lines in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , where the theory presented by bramwell _ et al_. is expected to be valid , the value of @xmath42 agrees with expectations . following blundell  @xcite we also plot @xmath60 versus @xmath32 .",
    "we see that the expected @xmath61 only holds for the same narrow @xmath32 range .",
    "our experiments , including two separate runs on pure @xmath0  carried out three months apart , demonstrate the reproducibility of the data ( see fig .",
    "[ fig2]a ) .",
    "a realignment of the @xmath0  disks between runs also shows that the results are not particularly sensitive to the exact details of the sample geometry .",
    "our results for the samples with a higher y content and with the thick ag foil demonstrate that the behaviour can not be attributed to instrumental effects .",
    "the samples were made at warwick  @xcite and are ho rather than dy based pyrochlores , eliminating the possibility of material specific results .    in summary transverse - field",
    "@xmath11sr experiments on ho@xmath1y@xmath2ti@xmath3o@xmath4 , including measurements on non - magnetic @xmath37  and a sample of @xmath0  covered in thick silver foil , suggest that the majority signal in the @xmath31 response comes from stray fields due the sample magnetization penetrating into the silver sample plate  @xcite .",
    "the results for @xmath0  are comparable with those observed for @xmath7 .",
    "the low - temperature ( @xmath62 ) linear field dependence in @xmath6 is only observed in samples with @xmath63 and 0.1 . in this low - temperature regime",
    "the value of @xmath42 agrees quantitatively with the theory presented in ref .",
    "the low - temperature hysteresis in @xmath31 for the magnetically dilute material ( @xmath64 ) appears inconsistent with the current understanding of monopoles in spin ice .",
    "single crystals of ho@xmath1y@xmath2ti@xmath3o@xmath4  ( @xmath5 , 0.1 , 1 , 1.6 and 2 ) were grown in an image furnace using the floating zone technique  @xcite . the single crystal disks were glued on to a silver plate and covered with a thin ( 0.01  mm ) sheet of silver foil to improve thermal conductivity .",
