    "bifurcations of homoclinic orbits in ordinary differential equations have been studied in numerous articles over the past decades .",
    "they also arise as bifurcations of solitons or pulses in partial differential equations ( pdes ) , and have attracted much attention even in the fields of pdes and nonlinear waves ( see , , section  2 of @xcite ) .",
    "many of researches on this topic are related to bifurcations from single - bump homoclinic orbits to multi - bump ones .",
    "see section  5.2.4 of @xcite for a concise and useful review of the references . as an exceptional study",
    ", knobloch @xcite showed that a saddle - node type of bifurcation for homoclinic orbits to hyperbolic saddles can occur in reversible and conservative systems with one parameter when the homoclinic orbits are non - transversal , , the tangent spaces to the stable and unstable manifolds of the saddles along them have two - dimensional intersections , using so - called lin s method @xcite .",
    "we can also use a version of melnikov s method @xcite due to gruendler @xcite , who studied the persistence of homoclinic orbits , to treat such bifurcations in general higher - dimensional systems with two parameters .",
    "we note that only one parameter is enough to treat these bifurcations for reversible and conservative systems but two parameters are needed in general systems .",
    "a pitchfork type of bifurcation for homoclinic orbits to saddle - centers was also detected in reversible systems @xcite , using an idea similar to that of melnikov s method .",
    "here we are interested in the latter , saddle - node and pitchfork types of bifurcations for homoclinic orbits to hyperbolic saddles in systems of the form @xmath0 where @xmath1 is analytic , @xmath2 is a parameter ( vector ) , @xmath3 is a positive integer and @xmath4 or 2 . note that eq .   may be hamiltonian or not .",
    "we consider the case of @xmath5 and make the following assumptions .    1 .",
    "the origin @xmath6 is a hyperbolic saddle equilibrium in at @xmath7 , such that @xmath8 has four real eigenvalues , @xmath9 .",
    "2 .   at @xmath7 the hyperbolic saddle",
    "@xmath6 has a homoclinic orbit @xmath10 .",
    "moreover , there exists a two - dimensional analytic invariant manifold @xmath11 containing @xmath6 and @xmath10 ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : a ] ) .    from ( a1 )",
    "we can also assume that the origin @xmath6 is still a hyperbolic saddle near @xmath7 under some change of coordinates .",
    "assumption ( a2 ) implies that the complexification of the vector field on @xmath11 with @xmath7 has a _ complex _",
    "separatrix @xmath12 whose real part is the _ real _ homoclinic orbit @xmath10 .",
    "in particular , the existence of the invariant manifold @xmath11 is essential in theorem  [ thm : main ] below .",
    "we also remark that as well known @xcite , there exists a center manifold for @xmath10 under a more general condition , but it is not analytic in general .",
    "as seen in @xcite , _ variational equations ( ves ) _ play an important role in persistence and bifurcation problems of homoclinic orbits .",
    "the ve of around the homoclinic orbit at @xmath7 is given by @xmath13 where @xmath14 .",
    "we easily see that @xmath15 is a bounded solution of tending to zero exponentially as @xmath16 .",
    "we consider the following condition .    1",
    ".   the ve   has another independent bounded solution .    in section",
    "2 , using gruendler s version of melnikov s method @xcite instead of lin s method @xcite , we prove the following results for with @xmath17 :    1 .",
    "if condition  ( c ) holds , then a saddle - node or pitchfork bifurcation of homoclinic orbits occurs under some nondegenerate condition ; 2 .",
    "if condition  ( c ) does not hold , then these bifurcations do not occur .",
    "thus , condition  ( c ) provides a criterion for saddle - node and pitchfork bifurcations of homoclinic orbits in .    on the other hand ,",
    "the problem of integrability is especially important in dynamical systems , along with bifurcations and chaos . in particular , it has been extensively studied for two classes of dynamical systems , linear differential equations and hamiltonian systems .",
    "see , , @xcite for the notions of integrability in these two classes .",
    "the former is also briefly described in section  3 .",
    "differential galois theory is one for the former class and provides algorithms to solve integrable linear differential equations .",
    "morales - ruiz and ramis @xcite applied the differential galois theory and uncovered a relation between integrability of both classes : if a hamiltonian system is integrable near its particular solution in the context of complex hamiltonian systems ( , in the sense of liouville with meromorphic first integrals ) , then the related ve is integrable in the context of linear differential equations ( , in the meaning of differential galois theory ) .",
    "their result was further extended to higher - order ves @xcite .",
    "an implication of their result for the occurrence of chaotic dynamics in two - degree - of - freedom hamiltonian systems with saddle - centers was also discussed in @xcite .    in this series of articles ,",
    "we give another application of the differential galois theory and clarify a connection of saddle - node and pitchfork bifurcations of homoclinic orbits in with the integrability of the ve   in the meaning of differential galois theory .",
    "more precisely , we prove the following theorem ( the proof is given in section  4 ) .",
    "[ thm : main ] suppose that condition  ( c ) holds .",
    "then the ve   has a triangularizable differential galois group , when regarded as a complex differential equation with meromorphic coefficients in a desingularized neighborhood @xmath18 of the homoclinic orbit @xmath10 in @xmath19 .",
    "this theorem means that under condition  ( c ) the ve   is integrable in the meaning of differential galois theory .",
    "see sections  3 and 4 for more details on the statement .",
    "such a relation between integrability in the differential galois setting and the existence of bounded solutions for linear differential equations was empirically noticed in the context of exactly solvable potentials in one dimensional schrdinger equations by acosta - humanez  @xcite .",
    "here we concentrate ourselves on the case of general or hamiltonian systems with hyperbolic saddle equilibria .",
    "the case of reversible systems or saddle - center equilibria will be treated in part  ii .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows : in section  2 we extend gruendler s version of melnikov s method @xcite and present bifurcation results for homoclinic orbits not only in hamiltonian systems but also in more general systems .",
    "these results are easily obtained from the result of @xcite but many of them are not found in other references , to the authors knowledge .",
    "we give necessary information on differential galois theory in section  3 and state a proof of theorem  [ thm : main ] in section  4 . in the proof , under assumption  ( a2 ) , we reduce integrability of the ve   to that of a two - dimensional linear system which consists of components normal to the invariant manifold @xmath11 and is called the _ normal variational equation ( nve)_. finally ,",
    "in section  5 , we illustrate our theories with an example which arises as stationary states of coupled real ginzburg - landau pdes .",
    "the theoretical results are also demonstrated by numerical ones using a numerical computation tool called auto97 @xcite .",
    "in this section , we extend gruendler s version of melnikov s method @xcite and discuss the persistence and bifurcations of homoclinic orbits in .",
