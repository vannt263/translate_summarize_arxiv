    "the density matrix @xmath4 corresponding to the vacuum state @xmath5 can be traced over the degrees of freedom located in a subset of the space giving place to a mixed density matrix with non zero entropy .",
    "this is usually called entanglement or geometric entropy .",
    "it was argued that this quantity is deeply related to the entropy of black holes @xcite . in the black hole spacetime",
    "the causal structure provides a natural partition of degrees of freedom , which corresponds to the asymptotic data at infinity and at the horizon respectively .",
    "the quantum state relevant for asymptotic observers is obtained by tracing the complete density matrix over the invisible degrees of freedom on the horizon .",
    "but @xmath5 contains correlations between the field modes inside and outside the black hole , and in consequence , the partial trace leads to a mixed density matrix with non zero entropy . indeed , several different calculations in specific examples have shown that the geometric entropy is proportional to the area in minkowski space @xcite .",
    "more recently the entanglement entropy has been also a subject of much interest in the study of condensed matter systems , specially in relation with the density matrix renormalization group method @xcite .",
    "more generally , the entanglement entropy of the vacuum state can be thought as a special case of a more familiar quantity , the entropy @xmath6 contained inside a volume corresponding to a given region @xmath7 of the space . for gases and other systems",
    "this is usually calculated by defining the system in question in the bounded region , what requires the specification of boundary conditions .",
    "however , these normally kill the correlations that the global state @xmath8 could present between degrees of freedom in @xmath7 and its complement @xmath9 .",
    "to compute @xmath6 without artificially modifying the global state @xmath8 we need a partition of the total hilbert space @xmath10 as a tensor product of hilbert spaces inside and outside @xmath7 , @xmath11 .",
    "then , the local density matrix is defined by @xmath12 and its entropy is @xmath13 .",
    "the local hilbert spaces @xmath14 , density matrices @xmath15 and entropies @xmath6 must satisfy certain compatibility conditions that simply express that they arise from a global state @xmath16 and hilbert space @xmath10 by partial tracing . given two non intersecting sets @xmath1 and @xmath2 we have that @xmath17    these conditions allow us to use a very important mathematical property of the quantum entropy which is called the strong subadditive inequality ( ssa ) and which is usefull to relate the entropies corresponding to the different subsystems involved in a tensor product @xcite . in the present case it acquires the following geometrical form @xcite @xmath18 for any two sets @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "in addition , the purity of the vacuum state gives the duality relation @xmath19    in minkowski space the independent degrees of freedom should be assigned to subsets of general cauchy surfaces and an entanglement entropy must correspond to any of these subsets .",
    "moreover , the causal structure and unitarity imply that this entropy must be the same for different spatial sets having the same causal domain of dependence ( see fig.1(a ) ) .",
    "it has been shown that the combination of the ssa property , the positivity of the entropy , and the poincar invariance of the vacuum state in minkowski space strongly constrain the function @xmath20 in any dimensions @xcite .",
    "the result is that if @xmath20 is finite for at least one arbitrary set then it has to finite and proportional to the boundary area for any other set , plus a constant term : @xmath21 here area@xmath22 means the area of the boundary of the spatial surface @xmath1 and @xmath23 and @xmath24 are positive constants .",
    "thus , the area law for the entanglement entropy has its origin in very basic and fundamental properties of relativity and quantum mechanics . in @xmath3 dimensions",
    "the equation corresponding to ( [ area ] ) reads @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the number of connected components ( or the number of boundary points ) of the one dimensional set @xmath1 .",
    "the ssa relation was originally introduced to show the existence of the mean entropy ( the limit of entropy divided by volume for large sets ) in translational invariant systems @xcite .",
    "we stress that the presence of additional boots symmetries makes the ssa relation a much more powerfull tool . for example , the equation ( [ unouno ] ) tells that the entropy of a single component set in @xmath3 dimensions is a constant ( if it is finite ) , while the ssa relation combined with translational symmetry alone only implies that this is a concave function of the length . for different types of sets or more dimensions",
    "the contrast is much greater .",
    "the equations ( [ area ] ) and ( [ unouno ] ) apply for finite @xmath20 .",
    "however , all specific calculations , numerical and analytical , have shown that the entanglement entropy is ultraviolet divergent , even for free fields .",
    "this divergences can not be softened by adding different matter fields since the entropy is a positive quantity .",
    "this indicates that the entanglement entropy may not have a finite covariant meaning in quantum field theory ( qft ) .",
    "the calculations of @xmath20 present in the literature have shown that the divergent terms are proportional to the area , which is also suggested by the theorem leading to eq .",
    "( [ area ] ) @xcite .",
    "motivated by this fact , we introduce a new quantity constructed out of the function @xmath20 which is however free from divergences .",
    "let @xmath1 and @xmath2 be two spatial sets in minkowski space which belong to the same cauchy surface   ( see fig.1(b ) ) .",
    "the symmetric function @xmath27 is finite , since the divergences cancel due to the relation @xmath28 it is also positive because of strong subadditivity and satisfies the duality @xmath29    besides , @xmath0 has a very suggestive property , not shared by @xmath20 . when @xmath1 and @xmath2 are non intersecting sets @xmath0 is monotonically increasing , @xmath30    from all this , we are lead to propose @xmath31 as a well defined measure of the degree of entanglement in qft .",
    "in fact , for two non intersecting sets @xmath1 and @xmath2 it can be written as @xmath32 where @xmath33 is known as the relative entropy for two states @xmath34 and @xmath35 acting on the same hilbert space .",
    "this later can be thought as a measure of the statistical distance between a pair of states . in the context of quantum information theory , the particular relative entropy in ( [ caso ] )",
    "is called the mutual information between the states @xmath36 and @xmath37 in the composite quantum system , and it is used as a measure of the amount of information they have in common @xcite .",
    "the function @xmath0 for intersecting sets can be defined in terms of the relative entropy for non intersecting ones with the use of additional auxiliary sets .",
    "the connection between @xmath31 and the relative entropy is also satisfying from the mathematical point of view .",
    "the origin for the divergence of the standard entanglement entropy can be traced to the impossibility of expressing the hilbert space @xmath10 as a tensor product of @xmath38 in the relativistic case .",
    "this partition is unambiguous if the system is defined on a lattice , the local hilbert spaces being generated by the local degrees of freedom ( for example the spin - like operators in a given region ) .",
    "however , in a relativistic qft the axiomatic investigations have shown that although there is a well defined notion of local algebras of operators in a volume @xmath7 ( type iii von neumann algebras in general ) there is no lorentz invariant partition of the total hilbert space into a tensor product @xmath11 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "one heuristic reason for this can be seen considering the theory of a free scalar field @xmath39 . in the classical theory the phase space attached to a bounded region @xmath7",
    "is given by initial data @xmath40 and @xmath41 vanishing outside @xmath7 .",
    "in the quantum case however , only positive energy solutions of the wave equation appear in the annihilation part of the operator @xmath40 . in momentum space",
    "the time derivative is then @xmath42 .",
    "now , in real space , the operator given by @xmath43 is antilocal , what means that it transforms any function vanishing outside an open set @xmath7 in a function which does not vanish identically in any open subset outside @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "this implies that one can not have @xmath44 and @xmath45 vanishing simultaneously in the same region of space , where @xmath46 is any one particle state . in general",
    "the moral is that in qft there is no covariant meaning for the localization of states , and what can be unambiguously localized are the field operator algebras . in this sense",
    "it is remarkable that even if a notion of entropy for a state in a given algebra may not exist ( type iii algebras do not contain a trace ) , the relative entropy of two states for the same von neumann algebra has a well defined mathematical meaning @xcite .",
    "the equation ( [ efe ] ) implies the following relation between the finite @xmath31 functions @xmath47 for any @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath48 . in a given regularization scheme , as @xmath20 goes to infinity these relations between finite quantities are maintained .",
    "the most general form of a function that solves ( [ equ1 ] ) in @xmath3 dimensions can be found by a long but straightforward calculation that we are not presenting here .",
    "it follows that @xmath49 evidently , this equation has the same form as ( [ efe ] ) but now the one set function @xmath50 is perfectly finite . since the meaningfull quantity is @xmath31 , the function @xmath51 is defined up to an arbitrary term proportional to the number @xmath26 of connected components in @xmath1 .",
    "thus , for the one component sets there is a `` gauge '' symmetry associated to an additive constant .",
    "the positivity of @xmath31 implies strong subadditivity for @xmath50 , @xmath52 and from ( [ dualf ] ) we also have @xmath53 .",
    "the crucial difference between @xmath50 and an entropy is that it can attain negative values",
    ". this must be so if @xmath50 has some dependence on the size of the sets , because otherwise , as we have already mentioned , eq .",
    "( [ unouno ] ) would apply for @xmath50 .",
    "moreover , it must attain negative values with arbitrarily big modulus .",
    "if not , it could be converted into a positive function by adding a suitable term proportional to @xmath26 .      for the special case of a conformal field theory ( cft ) and when the sets @xmath1 and @xmath2 are one component and intersecting , the eq .",
    "( [ g ] ) allows us to obtain the general form of @xmath0 .",
    "we see from figure 2(a ) that only four points determine the position of the diamonds corresponding to @xmath1 and @xmath2 . as @xmath0",
    "must be invariant under global conformal transformations , general results ensure that it must be a function of the cross ratios @xmath54 with @xmath55 where we have written @xmath56 and @xmath57 and the @xmath58 are the null coordinates of the point @xmath59 .",
    "on the other hand , for one component sets , @xmath50 can be written as a function of the length of the diamond base @xmath60 . using this and equations ( [ g ] ) and ( [ equiv ] ) we get the general form for @xmath50 and @xmath31 @xmath61 where @xmath62 and @xmath63 are constants , with @xmath64 .",
    "the conformal symmetry provides a simple argument in order to explain why @xmath31 is finite while @xmath20 is not .",
    "both quantities are supposed to be invariant under global conformal transformations which leave the vacuum invariant , but while @xmath31 is a function of four points only two points determine the argument of @xmath20 for one component sets , and there is no possibility of forming a cross ratio with two points",
    ". thus @xmath20 must be either infinite or a constant .",
    "several authors have calculated the entanglement entropy @xmath20 in @xmath3 conformal field theories with different regularization prescriptions , both numerically and analytically @xcite .",
    "the result is @xmath65 , where @xmath66 is an ultraviolet cutoff , and @xmath67 and @xmath68 are the holomorphic and antiholomorphic central charges .",
    "this formula can not be used for @xmath69 that gives @xmath70 . according to equation ( [ efe ] ) ,",
    "our results ( [ ga ] ) and ( [ forma ] ) , obtained from very general considerations , are perfectly consistent with this expression for @xmath20 , identifying @xmath62 with @xmath71 .",
    "thus , @xmath50 can be interpreted as a regularized entropy , @xmath72 , with @xmath73 a renormalization scale .",
    "the fact that @xmath50 is negative in some range causes no problem since its physical meaning is only up to a constant term .    from eq .",
    "( [ forma ] ) we see that the divergences appear in @xmath31 reduced to certain special configurations of the diamonds .",
    "this is when @xmath74 goes to zero , which is not surprising , since in that limit the two diamonds separate each other and @xmath31 turns into a different function , the one for non intersecting one component diamonds we discuss below .",
    "now we look for the general form of @xmath75 for one component sets in @xmath76 dimensional theories .",
    "consider two one component sets @xmath1 and @xmath2 of the same size @xmath77 , intersecting in a segment of size @xmath78 with @xmath79 .",
    "it follows from ( [ ssag ] ) applied to @xmath1 and @xmath80 that @xmath81 thus , @xmath82 is increasing and @xmath83 .",
    "the ssa relation for intersecting diamonds disposed as shown in the figure 2(b ) reads @xmath84 it can be shown that all other inequalities coming from ssa for two intersecting one component diamonds are less constraining than this relation .",
    "the meaning of ( [ relativista ] ) becomes more clear defining the function @xmath85 such that the domain of @xmath86 is the whole real line .",
    "equation ( [ relativista ] ) becomes @xmath87 this relation is called weak concavity , and it is known to be a property of the entropy for translational invariant systems in the original length variable .",
    "here we have it in the logarithmic variables . using repeatedly this equation",
    "we can prove concavity for @xmath86 , that is @xmath88 for any @xmath89 $ ] .",
    "the concavity of @xmath86 can be more simply written @xmath90 . introducing a new function",
    "@xmath91 we summarize all the constrains on the original function @xmath50 as @xmath92    according to the equations ( [ c1 ] ) and ( [ c2 ] ) the dimensionless function @xmath48 must be positive and decreasing with @xmath93 .",
    "since it depends on @xmath94 it is also a physically meaningfull quantity independent of the ultraviolet cutoff .",
    "thus , the renormalization group equation for @xmath48 reads @xmath95 where @xmath96 is the substraction point , the @xmath97 are the different dimensionless coupling constants and @xmath98 the corresponding beta functions .",
    "this equation expresses that the total derivative of @xmath48 with respect to @xmath96 is zero , what follows from the fact that @xmath48 is an observable quantity in a renormalizable theory .",
    "note that in consequence , the anomalous dimension term is not present in ( [ rg1 ] ) . by",
    "dimensional analysis @xmath48 has to be a funtion of @xmath99 and the dimensionless coupling constants , then we have @xmath100 as @xmath48 is decreasing with @xmath93 we see from eq .",
    "( [ rg1 ] ) and ( [ ren ] ) that @xmath101 for fixed @xmath102 is a function of the coupling constants which decreases along the renormalization group trajectory .",
    "moreover , at the fixed points , corresponding to conformal field theories , eq .",
    "( [ ga ] ) implies that @xmath101 is a constant @xmath103 , stationary under the renormalization group flow .",
    "this is in fact the statement of the zamolodchikov theorem @xcite .",
    "remarkably , this theorem follows here from the properties of the entropy and the poincar symmetry without resorting to quantum fields .",
    "also , the unitarity and causality of the theory are implicitly used in the fact that the entropy of a given set does not depend on the particular choice of the cauchy surface , what is crucial for the arguments that lead to eq .",
    "( [ relativista ] ) ( see figure 2(b ) ) .",
    "moreover , the ssa property requires a self - adjoint and positive density matrix which is also related to unitarity ( however , it also works for classical probability distributions)@xcite .    the @xmath48 charge in eq .",
    "( [ c1 ] ) has an interesting physical meaning : it measures the variation of the geometric entropy with the size of the set whose degrees of freedom are traced over .",
    "for example , for massive fields , the entropy saturates at a given radius ( see for example @xcite ) , what leads to the vanishing of @xmath48 for large r. this is in accord with the renormalization group flow interpretation of the running of @xmath48 given by eq .",
    "( [ ren ] ) since at the infrared no available degrees of freedom remain in the massive case .    in relation with the massive @xmath48 function",
    "we make the following remark that gives additional support to the connection of the entropy @xmath31 with the algebraic approach to qft .",
    "numerically we find that the @xmath48 function ( [ c1 ] ) for a free scalar field of mass @xmath104 decreases exponentially , @xmath105 , for large @xmath93 , what also happens for the zamolodchikov @xmath67 function .",
    "adding independent scalar fields we have a contribution to @xmath106 due to the sum of the exponential tails which is of the form @xmath107 , where @xmath108 is the density of fields per unit mass .",
    "we can choose an exponentially increasing density @xmath109 in such a way that the theory has a maximal temperature @xmath110 ( hagedorn temperature ) .",
    "in this case the divergence of @xmath50 does not take place at @xmath111 but at a finite distance @xmath112 .",
    "this coincides with the results of @xcite which tell that a consistent tensor product structure can not be given to the states on the algebras of two non intersecting sets when their separation distance is less than some constant times @xmath113 .",
    "some relations between the geometric entropy and the renormalization group flow were already suggested in the literature based on numerical results @xcite .",
    "moreover , interesting entropic c - theorems were introduced in @xcite .",
    "these also rely on the properties of the entropy .",
    "however , they do not involve the entanglement entropy between the degrees of freedom in different regions of the space but the relative entropy between the vacuum states corresponding to different values of the theory couplings .",
    "the renormalization group flow of the zamolodchikov @xmath67 function is given in terms of the energy momentum tensor correlators .",
    "it is likely that the energy momentum tensor is also involved in the running of the entropic function @xmath48 proposed in this paper .",
    "this would be very interesting , specially taking into account that one of the originals aims of the investigations about the geometric entropy was the underestanding of the relation between entropy and gravity .",
    "the equations ( [ c1 ] ) and ( [ c2 ] ) give the most general form of the function @xmath0 in @xmath3 dimensions for intersecting one component sets @xmath1 and @xmath2 . of course , these leave a lot of freedom , but this must be so , since @xmath31 contains information on the mass spectrum of the theory . the analysis can be continued considering the multicomponent set functions , that is , the case in which the sets @xmath1 and @xmath2 are multicomponent or non intersecting . then , the function @xmath31 and the relevant inequalities involve the function @xmath50 evaluated on multicomponent sets .",
    "the general analysis is outside of the scope of this letter .",
    "here we show only some constrains for the simple case of two non intersecting one component sets @xmath1 and @xmath2 lying in a single spatial line in a cft .",
    "these sets are as before determined by the position of their four edge points , what implies due to global conformal invariance that @xmath31 is a function of the cross ratio @xmath114 with @xmath115 where @xmath116 and @xmath117 are the sizes of @xmath1 and @xmath2 and @xmath118 is their separating distance .",
    "we can rewrite eq .",
    "( [ vein ] ) as @xmath119 with @xmath120 .",
    "the duality ( [ dualf ] ) leads to @xmath121 besides , from the ssa relation between @xmath122 and another set @xmath48 with one or two components it follows that @xmath123 these inequalities highly constrain the function @xmath124 , and in particular show that it has to be bounded in its domain @xmath125 $ ] .",
    "thus , the only singular points in @xmath126 come from the first term in the right hand side of ( [ gab ] ) . in particular in the limit @xmath127 , @xmath128 we get @xmath129 .",
    "( [ efe ] ) this gives @xmath130 consistent with previous calculations @xcite .",
    "we have checked numerically the formula ( [ gab ] ) for a majorana and a dirac fermion ( @xmath131 and @xmath132 respectively ) using the methods of @xcite .",
    "the result is @xmath133 and @xmath134 and @xmath135 respectively .",
    "on the other hand , we have also considered the theory of a free massless boson ( @xmath132 ) .",
    "the existence of a zero mode provides an additional infrared divergence to the entanglement entropy which is also present in @xmath31 ( this happens for all theories with non compact global symmetry groups ) .",
    "to regularize it we have introduced a small mass @xmath104 and attached the theory to a cylinder of circumference @xmath136 such that @xmath137 . in this case",
    "the numerical result is @xmath138 where @xmath139 is the expression of @xmath140 in the cylinder . with",
    "@xmath141 one recovers @xmath142 . the formula ( [ for ] ) satisfies the inequalities ( [ ineq1]-[ineq3 ] ) with @xmath135 , except when @xmath143 or @xmath144 where the mass enters into the game and equation ( [ for ] ) and the conformal symmetry do not hold any more .",
    "this is why ( [ for ] ) does not seem to lead to a bounded @xmath124 .",
    "the point we want to make here is that the function @xmath124 has the ability to distinguish between different models with the same central charge ( @xmath145 ) .",
    "one could wonder if the whole set of entanglement entropies are in one to one correspondence with the different qft . in other words , is it possible to uniquely define a qft by the set of its entanglement entropies ? .",
    "this is likely , since the local algebras of all qft are the same mathematical objects , independent of the theory and the space - time dimension @xcite .",
    "thus , the way they are entangled to each other must play a central role .",
    "if one accepts this , a second question naturally appears : is it the only requisite of a consistent set of entropy functions to obey the ssa relations and the space - time symmetries ? .",
    "further interest to these questions is given by the fact that the entanglement entropy @xmath31 has a nice property suited to study dimensional reduction .",
    "take for example the sets of the form @xmath146 $ ] in @xmath147 spacial dimensions , where @xmath148 $ ] is an interval of length @xmath149 and @xmath1 is any @xmath150 dimensional set .",
    "then the function @xmath151,b\\times [ x])}{x}\\ ] ] is well defined and must satisfy all requirements of an @xmath31 function in @xmath150 dimensions @xcite .",
    "generalizations of the results of this paper to higher dimensions using this construction are currently under investigation .",
    "finally , we suggest an interpretation of @xmath31 in the black hole evaporation problem . take @xmath1 as the rindler wedge and let @xmath2 be a diamond outside @xmath1 as shown in fig .",
    "3 . then @xmath0 can be interpreted , at least in certain limit , as the amount of entropy from the unruh thermal radiation that an observer can detect in an experiment running for a finite period of time corresponding to the set @xmath2 ( see related ideas in @xcite ) .",
    "this period measured in the boost parameter @xmath152 is @xmath153 now , the equations ( [ vein ] ) and ( [ gab ] ) for @xmath154 give @xmath155 thus , as @xmath124 is bounded , for big enough @xmath156 this gives @xmath157 .",
    "we also have @xmath158 , where @xmath96 is the proper time meassured by an accelerated observer with constant acceleration @xmath159 .",
    "this formula tells that the entropy is proportional to the diamond time @xmath160 times a constant flux of entropy @xmath161 due to a constant flux of unruh radiation .",
    "indeed , the unruh temperature is @xmath162 and in the high temperature limit ( adequate to the limit taken above ) the flux of entropy per unit time in a cft has a universal expression given by @xmath163 @xcite .",
    "therefore , the identification of @xmath31 with the total entropy flux during the interval @xmath160 lead us again to the equation @xmath164 . in the black hole case @xmath156",
    "should be interpreted as @xmath165 , where @xmath96 is the time as measured by the asymptotic observers and @xmath166 is the black hole mass .",
    "thus , @xmath31 would be proportional to the asymptotic time , corresponding to a constant flux of hawking radiation . for a real black hole",
    "the back - reaction must be included . in four dimensions the black hole lifetime",
    "is @xmath167 , giving place to a maximal observable entropy @xmath168 , which is proportional to the horizon area .",
    "h.c . thanks the invitation to visit the ictp where this work has been done .    _",
    "note added_.- after the submission of this paper to the arxiv data - base , the reference @xcite appeared , showing a calculation of the multi - set cft entropy functions .",
    "their general results are in agreement with the particular cases considered in sections 2.a and 2.c",
    ".    1.- equation ( [ area1 ] ) eliminates the divergences in @xmath0 only in two dimensions . in more dimensions additional",
    "subleading terms are present and @xmath0 does not converge for generic @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "3.- in section 3 the large @xmath156 limit is the low ( rather than high ) temperature limit .",
    "there is a factor two in @xmath171 which should read @xmath172 .",

    "<S> the trace over the degrees of freedom located in a subset of the space transforms the vacuum state into a mixed density matrix with non zero entropy . </S>",
    "<S> this is usually called entanglement entropy , and it is known to be divergent in quantum field theory ( qft ) . however , it is possible to define a finite quantity @xmath0 for two given different subsets @xmath1 and @xmath2 which measures the degree of entanglement between their respective degrees of freedom . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the function @xmath0 is severely constrained by the poincar symmetry and the mathematical properties of the entropy . in particular , for one component sets in two dimensional conformal field theories its general form is completely determined . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , it allows to prove an alternative entropic version of the c - theorem for @xmath3 dimensional qft . </S>",
    "<S> we propose this well defined quantity as the meaningfull entanglement entropy and comment on possible applications in qft and the black hole evaporation problem . </S>"
