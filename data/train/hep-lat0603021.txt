    "when hadronic matter is heated to temperatures of 150200  mev it makes a transition to a quark - gluon plasma .",
    "such temperatures were present in the early universe .",
    "there is also evidence that temperatures this high can be observed in relativistic heavy - ion colliders such as rhic .",
    "indeed , claims that the quark - gluon plasma has been observed have been made at rhic and at cern .",
    "lattice qcd enables one to simulate qcd at finite temperature and to examine the nature of this transition .",
    "when hadronic matter passes through this transition to the quark - gluon plasma , quarks and gluons are no longer confined .",
    "in addition , the approximate chiral symmetry associated with light quarks , which is broken spontaneously in cold hadronic matter , is restored .",
    "if we reduce the quark mass to zero , this transition must necessarily become a phase transition .",
    "we will consider the case of 2 light quarks ( @xmath2 and @xmath3 ) , and take their masses to zero , assuming that the strange quark , which we neglect , is too heavy to induce a first - order transition . for 2 light quark flavours , it is believed that the zero - mass transition is a second - order phase transition , which becomes a crossover with no true phase transition as soon as the quarks gain mass @xcite .",
    "it is argued that the universality class of this phase transition is that of a 3-dimensional @xmath4 spin model @xcite .",
    "( since the symmetry of massless 2-flavour qcd is @xmath5 , which is isomorphic to @xmath4 , the @xmath6@xmath7 multiplet which provides the goldstone pions , expresses @xmath4 symmetry . ) the reduced symmetry of staggered quarks reduces this symmetry to @xmath1 , so we might expect that lattice qcd with 2 staggered quark flavours has a phase transition in the universality class of the 3-dimensional @xmath1 spin model .    in the standard formulations of lattice qcd , the dirac operator becomes singular at zero quark mass , and so zero - mass simulations are impossible and very light quark simulations become very expensive .",
    "we have introduced a modified version of the staggered quark action , which has an additional irrelevant chiral 4-fermion interaction , `` @xmath8qcd '' @xcite .",
    "being irrelevant , this 4-fermion interaction does not affect the continuum limit , but it does render the dirac operator non - singular , even in the chiral limit .",
    "hence we simulate 2-flavour qcd with massless quarks using the @xmath8qcd action .",
    "we present the results of simulations of massless two - flavour @xmath8qcd on @xmath0 ( @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 ) lattices , in the neighbourhood of the finite - temperature transition .",
    "state - of - the - art simulations with conventional and highly improved staggered - quark actions have been run at masses which are too large to accurately determine the universality class of the transition @xcite . as a consequence ,",
    "attempts to determine the universality class of this transition , or to fit its scaling properties under the assumption that they are those for @xmath4 or @xmath1 have produced confusing results @xcite .",
    "our earlier work on @xmath12 @xcite and @xmath13 @xcite lattices had produced results which appeared to preclude either @xmath1 or @xmath4 universality .",
    "we had hoped that running at @xmath0 would broaden the transition sufficiently to allow a better determination of its nature .",
    "however , preliminary analysis of our measurements indicated that the chiral condensate decreases too fast for an @xmath1 or @xmath4 interpretation .",
    "the major problem appears to be that our ` data ' needs to be extrapolated to infinite volume , and all such extrapolations became unreliable close to the transition . for this reason we abandoned our attempts to extrapolate to infinite volume , and",
    "instead fit our chiral condensates to the magnetization curves for the 3-dimensional @xmath1 spin model , also on finite volumes . by choosing the lattice volumes for best fits , we are able to find good fits to our chiral condensates over most of the range of our measurements .",
    "we are also able to use our spin model fits to make acceptable predictions for the correlation lengths and chiral susceptibilities .",
    "once we establish that the behaviour of lattice qcd appears to be consistent with that of the @xmath1 spin model , we are able to use the properties of this simple model obtained both from our own simulations and the extensive literature on this model @xcite to understand why naive attempts to establish @xmath1 universality failed",
    ". the sizes of the @xmath1 lattices that give good fits to our @xmath8qcd ` data ' are too small ( @xmath14@xmath15 ) to be anywhere close to the infinite volume limit .",
    "in addition , the region over which the leading term suffices to describe the critical scaling of the magnetization of the @xmath1 spin model in the infinite volume limit is very narrow @xcite .",
    "a finite size scaling analysis of the @xmath1 spin model s magnetization reveals how easy it is to misidentify the universality class of the transition , when only small - lattice data is available .    in section",
    "2 we introduce @xmath8qcd .",
    "section  3 introduces the @xmath1 spin model and its critical behaviour .",
    "we describe our @xmath0 @xmath8qcd simulations and present some of our results in section  4 . in section  5",
    "we present our analysis of the @xmath8qcd ` data ' using the @xmath1 spin model .",

    "in @xmath8qcd , the lattice dirac operator is @xmath16 where the first 2 terms are the standard staggered quark dirac operator for quarks in the fundamental representation of colour @xmath17 , in interaction with the gauge fields on the links of the lattice .",
    "the auxiliary fields @xmath7 and @xmath6 are defined on the sites of the dual lattice and the sum is over the 16 sites of the dual lattice closest to the site on which the quark field resides .",

    "since this action is completely local , these auxiliary fields can be integrated out introducing a 4-fermion interaction with coupling inversely proportional to @xmath20 .",
    "@xmath8qcd preserves the remnant @xmath21 chiral symmetry of the standard staggered quark action for massless quarks .",

    "now let us define those critical exponents and amplitudes which describe the critical behaviour of this model and which are relevant to what we might hope to measure .",

    "the smoothness of the transition suggests strongly that it is second order .",
    "the curvature of the chiral condensate for the larger lattice ( before finite volume rounding sets in ) indicates that @xmath90 , something that the best finite mass simulations to date have difficulty in observing .",

    "[ fig : time ] we show the time history of the chiral condensate on the @xmath11 lattice for @xmath91 which is close to the transition , and @xmath92 which is just below the transition .",
    "because of critical slowing down , the system shows fluctuations which last for thousands of trajectories close to the critical point .    with the standard staggered action at zero quark mass , the chiral condensate vanishes identically on each configuration , so even if we could simulate at @xmath93 we could not observe a chiral condensate , even on a configuration by configuration basis .",
    "this has to be true because the remnant @xmath21 chiral symmetry is manifest at any fixed value of the gauge fields , i.e. on each configuration , which precludes the existence of a chiral condensate . with the @xmath8qcd action ,",

    "close to the transition , the ring structure is no longer clear , although a peak away from the origin still shows up on a radial density profile . finally , for @xmath102 , above the transition , the maximum density is at the origin indicating that the condensate has vanished , and chiral symmetry is restored .",

    "close to the transition ( @xmath41 close to zero ) , for large enough lattices , the data for all lattice sizes should follow the same universal curve . figure  [ fig : fss]a shows this curve using @xmath1 critical indices @xmath76 and @xmath182 . near @xmath183",
    "the curves for different lattice sizes coincide . as one moves away from @xmath183",
    "the curves start to diverge .",
    "as the lattice sizes increase the curves follow one another for larger ranges of @xmath181 , and it appears that they are approaching a universal curve . as can be seen , the small lattices do not follow the universal curve very far at all . while investigating such scaling , it is interesting to try other values for @xmath76 and @xmath182 .",
    "our earlier , but now suspect , identification of the @xmath13 transitions as being tricritical , suggests we try the critical indices for a tricritical point , @xmath184 and @xmath185 . the result is plotted in figure  [ fig : fss]b .",
    "the initial impression is that this plot shows much better evidence for finite size scaling than that with the correct critical exponents .",
    "a closer look reveals that it is the larger lattices that show significant departures from the ` scaling curve ' .",
    "this departure is small but significant for the @xmath116 lattice , larger for the @xmath117 lattice and embarrassingly large for the @xmath118 lattice .",
    "however , it is clear that if we only had the smaller lattices , we would have concluded that the critical point was a tricritical point , not an @xmath1 critical point .",
    "unfortunately this is essentially the situation for the current round of lattice qcd simulations , so we need to be very careful .",
    "we have simulated the finite temperature behaviour of lattice qcd with 2 flavours of staggered quarks using the @xmath8qcd action which allows us to run at zero quark mass .",
    "running with zero quark mass gives us direct access to the second - order phase transition from hadronic matter to a quark - gluon plasma , and allows us to to study its universality class .",
    "attempts at determining the nature of this transition for staggered quark actions from runs at finite mass had led to a state of confusion , since the scaling behaviour near the transition often appeared inconsistent with both the @xmath4 universality class expected for the continuum theory and the @xmath1 universality class which one would predict from considerations of the reduced symmetry of the staggered fermions .",
    "the fermion masses that one is forced to use with standard staggered actions are too large to clarify what is happening and some of the most ambitious simulations of staggered fermion lattice qcd thermodynamics do not even try to study the nature of the critical point .",
    "notable exceptions include a recent study of this transition at infinite coupling which shows clear evidence for @xmath1 universality @xcite , and a study of lattice qcd with 2 light adjoint quark flavours , where the chiral and deconfinement transitions are distinct @xcite , which also shows evidence for @xmath1 universality of the chiral transition .",
    "we present results for the finite temperature behaviour of 2-flavour lattice qcd with the @xmath8qcd action on @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 lattices .",
    "the decrease of the chiral condensate as the critical point was approached from below appeared to be too abrupt for @xmath1 or @xmath4 universality .",
    "however , we found that it was possible to fit the chiral condensates to the magnetization curves for an @xmath1 spin model on relatively small lattices @xmath14@xmath15 .",
    "this indicates that the transition is consistent with @xmath1 universality .",
    "the problems with more naive approaches to measuring the details of the critical behaviour of this transition is that they do not adequately account for finite volume effects close to the transition , and that for @xmath1 , the non - leading contributions to critical scaling are important except so close to the transition as to be inaccessible on the sizes of lattice we use .",
    "the spin model predictions for the correlation lengths and chiral susceptibilities for lattice qcd are similar enough to our measurements to add further support to this @xmath1 interpretation .",
    "we also made fits to the condensates from our @xmath147 simulations , which we had earlier interpreted as indicating tricritical behaviour , to the @xmath1 spin model magnetizations on an @xmath115 lattice .",
    "these fits were good enough to convince us that @xmath13 simulations also yield results consistent with @xmath1 universality .",
    "a finite size scaling analysis of our @xmath1 spin model magnetizations gave further clues as to why the behaviour of our lattice qcd measurements hinted at a tricritical explanation .",
    "the approach of the @xmath1 spin model magnetizations to the universal finite size scaling curve with increasing lattice size is slow .",
    "however , if we perform a finite size scaling analysis using the critical exponents of the tricritical point , rather than those appropriate for @xmath1 , we find a rapid approach to an apparently universal curve with increasing lattice size .",
    "it is only by going to larger lattices , where the measurements start to diverge from this false scaling curve , that the tricritical interpretation is invalidated . for lattice",
    "qcd we do not at present have the luxury of being able to perform simulations on much larger lattices .",
    "the results we presented in this paper are for a single small fixed value ( in lattice units ) of the 4-fermion coupling",
    ". it would be helpful if we could perform simulations at another ( even smaller ) value of this coupling , since the critical value of @xmath88 , @xmath186 is significantly above that for the standard staggered action at @xmath0 , where reference  @xcite estimates @xmath187 .",
    "we should also extend our analyses to finite quark masses to study critical scaling involving the critical exponent @xmath188 .",
    "we note that we could extend our current measurements to finite quark masses using ferrenberg - swendsen extrapolation .",
    "however , our attempts to do such an extrapolation indicated that this is only reliable for a range of masses where the condensate vanishes linearly with decreasing quark mass . for finite mass studies one needs quark masses large enough to get beyond this linear regime .    so far , we have only compared the critical behaviour of lattice qcd with the @xmath1 spin model .",
    "we need to extend our studies to spin models in other universality classes as for example the @xmath4 or the mean - field universality classes , before we can say with any certainty whether the evidence for @xmath1 universality is compelling .",
    "such studies are planned for the near future , since the spin - model simulations they involve are relatively inexpensive .",
    "finally , we need to address finite @xmath189 effects .",
    "we have found that finite @xmath189 effects can change the apparent nature of the phase transition in our studies of qcd at finite isospin chemical potential @xcite ( see also @xcite ) . there",
    "the problem was that the difference between the effective @xmath88 , calculated by the equipartition theorem from the molecular - dynamics kinetic energies and the input @xmath88 , a finite @xmath189 effect , was much larger below the transition than above , which distorted the transition .",
    "we have measured such @xmath88 shifts in our @xmath8qcd simulations , and while they are as large as those measured in our qcd at finite isospin simulations , they do not significantly change as we cross the transition , and are therefore unlikely to distort this transition .",
    "nevertheless we intend to convert our simulations from hybrid molecular - dynamics to exact rhmc simulations @xcite .",
    "because the lower bound of the spectrum of the @xmath8qcd dirac operator is unknown , this is not an entirely trivial conversion .",
    "however , our experience with using the rhmc method to simulate qcd at finite isospin density , where the lower bound on the dirac operator is also unknown , indicates that rhmc simulations _ can _ be applied in such cases @xcite .",
    "these @xmath8qcd simulations were performed on the ibm sp  seaborg at nersc , the ibm sp  blue horizon at sdsc / npaci and the tungsten cluster at ncsa .",
    "access to the nsf machines was through an nrac allocation .",
