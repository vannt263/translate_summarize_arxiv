    "the toda lattice equation was derived by toda as a model of one - dimensional chain of masses connected by springs with nonlinear interaction force @xcite .",
    "the toda lattice is one of the completely integrable systems with multi - soliton solutions .",
    "the equation of motion of the toda lattice is @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the position of the @xmath3-th particle .",
    "the time - discretization of the toda lattice was obtained by hirota @xcite as a bilinear form : @xmath4 the two - dimensional toda lattice ( 2d - toda ) equation was introduced by leznov and saveliev @xcite : @xmath5 its time - discretization ( 2d - dtoda ) was found by hirota , tsujimoto and imai @xcite as @xmath6 where the dependent variable @xmath7 is defined on the three - dimensional lattice @xmath8 .",
    "there are several integrability criteria of discrete equations . particularly important",
    "two of them are ` the singularity confinement test ' @xcite , and ` the algebraic entropy test ' @xcite .",
    "a singularity of a discrete equation is said to be confined , if it is eliminated after a finite number of iteration steps , and at that stage , the dependence on the initial data is recovered .",
    "the discrete equation passes the singularity confinement test ( sc test ) , if all the singularities of the equation are confined .",
    "the sc test was extremely effective in distinguishing ` integrable ' discrete systems , and also in constructing non - autonomous integrable equations .",
    "for example , discrete analogs of the painlev equations were discovered by searching for non - autonomous extensions to the qrt mappings that conserve their singularity patterns @xcite .",
    "however , a ` counter example ' to sc test has been proposed @xcite .",
    "the equation they have proposed , which is now called the hietarinta - viallet equation , passes the sc test , although it is considered to be non - integrable in the sense that it has chaotic orbits of iterates and has no conserved quantities .",
    "they have proposed to use the algebraic entropy to deal with this type of equations .",
    "algebraic entropy is a quantity to measure the degree growth of the iterates of the equations .",
    "the criterion is that the equation is integrable if and only if its algebraic entropy is zero .",
    "this criterion is quite strong : the hietarinta - viallet equation has positive ( @xmath9 ) algebraic entropy .",
    "recently , with the aim of refining these integrability criteria , the authors and others have proposed the ` irreducibility ' and the ` co - primeness ' properties to distinguish integrable mappings @xcite .",
    "let us study a discrete mapping whose iterates are always laurent polynomials of the initial variables .",
    "if the equation has this property , it is said to have the laurent property @xcite .",
    "the mapping has the irreducibility , if every iterate is an irreducible laurent polynomial of the initial variables .",
    "here we assume that the equation is well - defined under a suitable boundary condition .",
    "the equation satisfies the co - primeness condition , if every pair of two iterates is co - prime as laurent polynomials .",
    "we can also define the co - primeness condition , even if the iterates are not necessarily laurent polynomials .",
    "moreover , it is also possible to relax the co - primeness condition as follows : the equation passes the co - primeness condition if every pair of two iterates ` which is separated by a fixed finite distance ' is always co - prime .",
    "the irreducibility and co - primeness are found out to be useful in formulating the integrability of discrete equations defined over the lattice of dimension more than one .",
    "for example , we have proved that these two properties can also be formulated for the discrete toda equation ( both the @xmath7-function form and the nonlinear form ) with various boundary conditions : i.e. , open , the dirichlet , and the periodic boundaries @xcite .",
    "a discrete equation is called ` quasi - integrable ' , if it passes the singularity confinement test , and at the same time , has exponential growth of the degrees of the iterates .",
    "note that , in one - dimensional systems , the latter statement is equivalent to saying that the algebraic entropy of the equation is positive , however , for higher - dimensional case we can not define the entropy in its usual sense . to construct quasi - integrable extensions to known discrete equations , we introduce parameters on the powers of the terms . some of the equation we study are already introduced by fomin and zelevinsky as examples of equations whose iterates are always laurent polynomials @xcite . in this manuscript ,",
    "in addition to the laurent property , we prove the irreducibility and the co - primeness properties for these equations . before starting ,",

    "@xmath14 )   since @xmath12 is irreducible , the common factor of @xmath12 and @xmath13 should be either a unit or @xmath12 itself .",
    "however , from the assumption , there exists a variable that is in @xmath12 but not in @xmath13 , thus @xmath12 can not be a factor of @xmath13 . thus @xmath12 and @xmath13 are co - prime .",
