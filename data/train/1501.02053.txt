    "<S> we predict the spontaneous modulated emission from a pair of exciton - polariton condensates due to coherent ( josephson ) and dissipative coupling . </S>",

    "<S> the exciton - polariton condensates exhibit self - induced oscillations and emit an equidistant frequency comb light spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> a plethora of possible emission spectra with asymmetric peak distributions appears due to spontaneously broken time - reversal symmetry . </S>",
    "<S> the lasing dynamics is affected by the shot noise arising from the influx of polaritons . </S>",
    "<S> that results in a complex inhomogeneous line broadening .    </S>",
    "<S> condensation of exciton - polaritons ( ep s ) in semiconductor microcavities formed by two distributed bragg mirrors with quantum wells between them has been experimentally observed @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> being incoherently excited in the microcavity , ep condensates are in general out of thermodynamic equilibrium . </S>",
    "<S> ep condensates refuel their particle depot through absorption of cavity photons and emit coherent light due to tunneling of the composite ep states through distributed bragg mirrors . </S>",
    "<S> sample inhomogeneity , either accidental or intentional , can induce several condensation centers ( cc s ) @xcite . at low enough pumping </S>",
    "<S> , one expects a system of disconnected bec droplets emitting light at different uncorrelated frequencies . </S>",
    "<S> as the pumping increases the condensates tend to establish mutual coherence and emit in a laser mode @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> already two ccs can synchronize and emit at a single joint frequency @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this is possible because the condensates exchange particles due to josephson coupling and adjust their emission frequencies , which in turn depend on the number of condensed particles due to the polariton - polariton repulsion . </S>",
    "<S> in addition to the coherent josephson coupling , there can be a dissipative ( radiative ) coupling between cc s , which reflects the dependence of the losses in the system on the symmetry of singe - particle states . that new stationary regime called weak lasing takes place when pumping rates reside between some minimal and maximal rates of losses @xcite . in the weak lasing regime , </S>",
    "<S> the system is stabilized by the formation of specific many - particle states which adjust the balance between gain and loss in the system .    in this letter </S>",
    "<S> we show that in the weak lasing regime two ccs can emit not only at a _ single _ frequency , but also at a whole _ </S>",
    "<S> frequency comb _ which in principle contains an infinite number of equidistant lines of coherent lase - like radiation . </S>",
    "<S> this emission reflects the fact of formation of spontaneous selfsustained anharmonic oscillations of both the occupation numbers and the relative phase between the condensates , in sharp contrast to previously reported damped josephson oscillations @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we study possible emission spectra and the way they are affected by noise . </S>",
    "<S> while the emission frequency of single - line ep lasers resides in the ev range @xcite , the modulation frequency of comb emission can be adjusted to be in the terahertz and sub - terahertz range . </S>",
    "<S> filtering out of the high - frequency component through optical demodulation yields the low - frequency coherent signal as a new promising type of coherent terahertz emitters . </S>",
    "<S> the ep self - induced oscillation is also a novel mechanism of optical frequency comb generation as compared to mode - locked lasers @xcite and optical microresonators @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> consider two coupled ep condensates with order parameters @xmath0 where @xmath1 are the occupations of the two condensates , @xmath2 is the total phase and @xmath3 is the phase difference . </S>",
    "<S> the time evolution of @xmath4 is governed by the langevin equations ( @xmath5 ) @xcite @xmath6 where @xmath7 label the condensates . </S>",
    "<S> the parameter @xmath8 describes the difference between the rates of losses @xmath9 and pumping @xmath10 , @xmath11 denote the singe - particle energies of the condensates , the parameters @xmath12 and @xmath13 define dissipative and coherent coupling between the condensates , respectively , and @xmath14 is the polariton - polariton interaction constant . </S>",
    "<S> the last term in eq .   is the gaussian white noise satisfying @xmath15 and @xmath16 . due to gauge invariance , </S>",
    "<S> only the frequency detuning @xmath17 is relevant and in what follows we will count the frequency from @xmath18 . </S>",
    "<S> rescaling time we can fix @xmath19 and , since rescaling the condensate amplitudes is equivalent to a change of @xmath14 , we can set @xmath20 without loss of generality .    </S>",
    "<S> the dissipative coupling induces a relative phase @xmath21 dependent dissipation in the system . </S>",
    "<S> this can be observed from the eigenvalues @xmath22 which control the condensate evolution @xmath23 in the absence of interaction @xcite . for sufficiently large </S>",
    "<S> @xmath24 one of the eigenmodes turns unstable . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the dissipative coupling acts as a phase - selective pump which depends on the relative phase @xmath21 : it pumps one eigenmode while keeping the other one lossy . in this regime </S>",
    "<S> nontrivial weak lasing states are formed ( see ref.@xcite for a complete account ) . </S>",
    "<S> first we consider the noise - free case ( @xmath25 ) in order to determine the attractors of the system . </S>",
    "<S> two nontrivial solutions f@xmath26 to eqs .   </S>",

    "<S> the total phase @xmath2 of the condensates satisfies @xmath33 and the rhs in ( [ eq : totalphase ] ) gives a time - independent frequency @xmath34 for these solutions . </S>",
    "<S> the two centers evolve in a coherent fashion @xmath35 and @xmath36 defines the blue - shift of the emission line with respect to the average single - particle frequency . in the subspace </S>",
    "<S> @xmath37 these states correspond to fixed points @xcite . in parts of the control parameter space </S>",
    "<S> these states are stable , and should manifest themselves as weak lasing states . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath38 states loose stability at @xmath39 @xcite @xmath40\\ ] ] we plot the two instability curves in the @xmath41 space at fixed @xmath42 in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1 ] ( solid lines ) . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath38 states are unstable in the shaded areas lc@xmath26 . </S>",
    "<S> in particular they are both unstable in the joint area lc@xmath43 and lc@xmath44 , where the trivial solution @xmath45 is unstable as well . </S>",
    "<S> what are then the stable stationary states of the system , if any ?    </S>",
    "<S> the answer is obtained by linearizing the phase space flow around @xmath38 in the subspace @xmath46 . at @xmath47 two corresponding eigenvalues </S>",
    "<S> are purely imaginary @xmath48 , with their real parts changing sign . as a result , </S>",
    "<S> a supercritical hopf bifurcation occurs , where stable limit cycles lc@xmath49 with frequency @xmath50 are born around the respective unstable fixed points f@xmath49 @xcite .     </S>",
    "<S> appear in the shaded areas in the @xmath51-parameter space . </S>",
    "<S> stable lc@xmath49 are born through hopf bifurcations at the solid @xmath52 line and turn unstable at the dashed @xmath53 lines where they undergo period doubling bifurcations . </S>",
    "<S> they are the only stable attractors to coexist in the central ( yellow ) region . here @xmath54 . ]    away from the bifurcation line the lcs increase the oscillation amplitudes , deform , and change their frequency . </S>",
    "<S> the coexistence region of lc@xmath43 and lc@xmath44 grows in size as the josephson tunneling is reduced . at the hopf bifurcation , where a lc emerges , @xmath55 and also @xmath56 become periodic functions of time with period @xmath57 </S>",
    "<S> . then they may be expanded in a fourier series with frequency harmonics @xmath58 and @xmath59 the integration of the constant term @xmath60 in the fourier series of @xmath56 results in a linear time dependence , @xmath61 , similar to @xmath38 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore @xmath62 where the functions @xmath63 are periodic in time . </S>",
    "<S> the fourier spectrum of @xmath64 is equidistant with frequency harmonics positioned at @xmath65 .    </S>",
    "<S> approaching the dashed lines @xmath66 in fig.[fig1 ] , the corresponding lc turns unstable and undergoes a period doubling bifurcation . </S>",
    "<S> this gives rise to a new stable period - doubled lc , which however again quickly undergoes a period doubling bifurcation . </S>",
    "<S> a period doubling route to chaos along a feigenbaum scenario leads to chaotic attractors @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> therefore just two coupled exciton - polariton condensates suffice to produce an extremely rich and complex synchronized dynamics . </S>",
    "<S> experimentally the polariton order parameter is detected by analyzing the emitted light from the microcavity . in near - field measurements , </S>",
    "<S> only small parts of the sample , like one condensation center , can be probed . </S>",
    "<S> our aim is to calculate the spectral density @xmath67 of the radiation corresponding to different nontrivial attractors . applying a fourier transformation ( ft ) we have @xmath68    in the fixed points @xmath38 @xmath69 , and the time dependence comes from the evolution of the total phase @xmath70 , @xmath71 with constants @xmath72 . </S>",
    "<S> thus the condensates emit light at frequency @xmath36 fully synchronized . </S>",
    "<S> the emission spectrum consists of only one peak , in contrast to the case of noninteracting polaritons , where two separated peaks are expected .     </S>",

    "<S> ( c ) @xmath74 for @xmath78 ( upper panel ) and @xmath79 ( lower panel , period doubled lc spectrum ) . for visualization </S>",
    "<S> , a small artificial lorentzian line width was added to all emission lines . </S>",
    "<S> , title=\"fig : \" ]    since the limit cycles lc@xmath26 are characterized by an equidistant spectrum , we first numerically compute the corresponding frequency positions , and then calculate the intensity of each frequency harmonics using a fourier series expansion . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting spectra are shown in fig.[fig2](a , b ) . </S>",
    "<S> close to the hopf bifurcation , there is only one considerable emission peak originating from the @xmath80 spectral line ( fig.[fig2](a , b ) upper panels ) . </S>",
    "<S> further away from the hopf bifurcation , the satellite peaks grow to form a frequency comb with asymmetric tails ( fig.[fig2](a , b ) lower panels ) . </S>",
    "<S> the comb also acquires several peak maxima , with the highest peak originating from a satellite with nonzero @xmath81 ( fig.[fig2](a , b ) lower panels ) . </S>",
    "<S> when the lc undergoes a period doubling bifurcation , the comb becomes twice as dense ( fig.[fig2](c ) ) .    </S>",
    "<S> the typical modulation frequency is independent of the polariton - polariton interaction constant @xmath14 and is of the order of the coupling constant @xmath82 . for typical dissipative rates in semiconductor microcavities @xmath83 </S>",
    "<S> one expects condensate pairs with dissipative coupling @xmath84 and below . </S>",
    "<S> this would permit to generate frequency combs with terahertz separation between the individual peaks . </S>",
    "<S> additional reduction of this separation by period doubling can shift the modulation frequency into the millimeter range .    </S>",
    "<S> finally , we consider the influence of noise in eq .. in general , it will broaden the peaks discussed so far , and can lead to a merging of peaks with small enough spacing . </S>",
    "<S> the emission spectrum can be obtained using the wiener - khinchin theorem , @xmath85 where @xmath86 is the auto - correlation of the , now , random process @xmath64 .    </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath38 states are periodic orbits in the full four - dimensional phase space , and the dynamics along these periodic orbits is parameterized by the total phase @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> while fluctuations off the periodic orbit will relax back , fluctuations along the orbit do not , and will enforce diffusion of @xmath2 on the orbit . </S>",
    "<S> the latter fluctuations can be shown to form a lorentzian line with the full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) given by @xmath87 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> note that the fwhm is inversely proportional to the number of particles in the condensate , as it should be for a laser .    </S>",
    "<S> in contrast to the @xmath38 states , the lc@xmath49 states are formed by the motion on a torus in the full phase space . </S>",
    "<S> the stability of the attractor demands that fluctuations off the torus relax back . </S>",
    "<S> fluctuations along the torus surface enforce a diffusion on it . </S>",
    "<S> the two nontrivial phases which diffuse , are the total phase @xmath2 and the second phase angle , which characterizes the position on the limit cycle .    </S>",
    "<S> close to the hopf bifurcation , and in the presence of only a few satellite peaks , we can obtain a closed formula for the line width . </S>",
    "<S> to parameterize the lc we introduce two time arguments : one originating from the total phase and the other from the lc phase . </S>",
    "<S> noise in these time arguments , according to eq .  </S>",
    "<S> , leads to @xmath88 where the periodic function @xmath89 has been expanded in a fourier series with coefficients @xmath90 and @xmath91 is the velocity of the noise - free trajectory along the lc in the three - dimensional space @xmath92 . </S>",
    "<S> the noise term @xmath93 is the projected noise along the lc , while @xmath94 $ ] is the noise added to the rhs of eq . for @xmath95 </S>",
    "<S> note that perturbing the time argument of @xmath89 already accounts for a part of the noise @xmath96 , because @xmath97 is time periodic . </S>",
    "<S> however close to the hopf bifurcation this periodic part is negligible compared to the dc part of @xmath97 , so that the above separation of noise in the time arguments is justified .    </S>",
    "<S> the choice of the two time arguments is convenient when characterizing the dynamics of the noise - free lc . in the presence of noise </S>",
    "<S> however it leads to nonzero correlations @xmath98 denoting @xmath99 , @xmath100 , @xmath101 , we have @xmath102 with an asymmetric dependence of @xmath103 on @xmath104 .    </S>",
    "<S> the intensity of the noise @xmath105 is periodic in time , which originates from the oscillation of occupation numbers and relative phase for evolution along the lc . </S>",
    "<S> experimentally , the measurement time spans many lc periods and one can use the average value @xmath106 . </S>",
    "<S> then @xmath107 we obtain a lorentzian for every emission line , with an @xmath104-dependent width @xmath108 according to eq .  . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath104-dependence of the line broadening @xmath108 follows from eq.([asymmetry ] ) and shows two remarkable features . </S>",
    "<S> first , there is an @xmath104-symmetric line broadening with increasing @xmath104 which is very strong and proportional to @xmath109 . </S>",
    "<S> second , there is an asymmetric contribution @xmath110 which originates form nonzero correlations @xmath111 . </S>",
    "<S> it may lead to a satellite peak becoming more narrow than the main peak @xmath112 , and can further enhance the asymmetry of the spectrum , as compared to the noise - free case .     at @xmath113 , for ( a ) condensation center 1 and ( b ) condensation center 2 . </S>",
    "<S> the arrows indicate the central peak . here </S>",
    "<S> @xmath114 . ]    </S>",
    "<S> to calculate the line width @xmath115 numerically , we denote by @xmath116 the normalized tangent vector along the lc in the coordinates @xmath117 . </S>",
    "<S> then @xmath118 is the noise in @xmath119 projected onto this tangent and we can evaluate from eq .   </S>",
    "<S> @xmath120 we show the spectrum with inhomogeneous line broadening compared to the noise - free case in fig.[fig3 ] . due to noise , the asymmetry of the spectrum is enhanced and the strict equidistance of emission lines is relaxed for strong enough line broadening . </S>",
    "<S> we note that this shape together with the equidistance of emission peaks is very reminiscent of experimentally obtained spectra in @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> dissipative coupling between coexisting exciton - polariton condensates in semiconductor microcavities together with strong polariton - polariton repulsion leads to a rich dissipative nonlinear dynamics already for two coupled condensates . </S>",
    "<S> we showed that , in addition to full synchronization @xcite , formation of limit cycles gives rise to frequency combs of equidistant asymmetric spectral lines . </S>",
    "<S> the frequency offset and line spacing of the combs are tunable through the control parameters . through period doubling , the line spacing can be additionally reduced by an order of magnitude . </S>",
    "<S> this modulated emission can be useful for terahertz and sub - terahertz applications . shot noise from the pump results in a complex diffusion in phase space and has strong impact on higher order satellite peaks .    _ </S>",
