    "this is much larger than the ratio found in elementary collisions  @xcite .",
    "it has also been shown that at higher @xmath3 , particle production does not scale with the number of binary collisions in the most central au+au collisions , but rather is suppressed  @xcite . the particle dependence of this quantity , @xmath6 ( the ratio between the yields in central and peripheral collisions as a function of @xmath3 ) , exhibits a difference between the lighter ( @xmath9 ) and the heavier particles ( @xmath10 ) .    in this paper",

    "in this analysis , 1.6 x 10@xmath16 minimum - bias triggers and 1.5 x 10@xmath16 central triggers in the star detector system were used  @xcite . the charged hadrons ( @xmath17 )",
    "were identified using a small acceptance ( @xmath180.3 , @xmath19 = 20@xmath20 ) csi based ring imaging cherenkov detector ( rich ) , located at mid - rapidity in the star setup  @xcite , extending the @xmath3 coverage of the particle identification of the @xmath0 and @xmath21 up to 3 gev / c , and the @xmath22 to 5 gev / c , well beyond the range achieved through specific ionisation in the time projection chamber ( tpc )  @xcite .",
    "meanwhile , the strange hadrons ( @xmath1 and @xmath23 ) are identified at mid - rapidity ( @xmath24 1.0 ) in the tpc through their charged decay channels : @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath27  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath8 and @xmath11 ratios are presented as a function of @xmath3 for the most central collisions ( 0 - 10@xmath28 ) in figure [ fig : bbarb ] .",
    "along with the data , predictions are also plotted for the @xmath8 ratio from the ` soft+quench ' ( solid ) model ( and pqcd ( dashed ) model from the same authors ) at 130 gev  @xcite , and a recombination ( dash - dot ) model at 200 gev  @xcite .",

    "the baryon / meson ratios can also be studied in both the non - strange and strange sector via the @xmath29 and @xmath13 ratios and are presented in figure [ fig : baryontomeson_data ] . for",
    "the @xmath29 ratio , which is in agreement with earlier measurements  @xcite , the @xmath3 range is limited to 3 gev / c due to the need for unambiguous identification of the @xmath30 , whilst the @xmath3 coverage of the @xmath13 ratio is governed by ( lack of ) statistics .",

    "the @xmath13 ratio shows a smooth increase with the number of participating nucleons , from minimum bias p+p collisions ( at 200 gev / c ) , up to the most central au+au collisions .",
    "for all centralities , there appears to be a constant increase of the ratio at low @xmath3 , whereupon the ratio in that collision system plateaus and then falls off .",
    "the @xmath13 ( and hence the baryon / meson ) ratio is greater than unity in the most central data for the range 2 @xmath31 6 gev / c .",
    "the data appears to tend to the same value for all centralities in the range @xmath3 @xmath32 5 - 6 gev / c , but is not yet down to the level exhibited in p+p collisions .",
    "this feature is also present in the @xmath6 ratios in figure [ fig : rcp ] . with the addition of the @xmath15 and @xmath14 data , it is evident that baryons and mesons are suppressed at different transverse momenta , and the differences previously reported between the @xmath0 and @xmath22  @xcite and @xmath33 and @xmath1  @xcite are not due to a mass effect .",
    "we note that the @xmath6 for the @xmath1 and @xmath33 come together at approximately the same @xmath3 as the @xmath13 ratios come together , perhaps indicating the onset of particle production from string fragmentation .",

    "the two different coalescence comparisons are for with ( coal ) and without ( coal-2 ) the coalescence mechanism from within the same model .",
    "this is strongly dependent upon the wavefunction used for the @xmath1 in the analysis  @xcite .",
    "the recombination and coalescence models require a large parton density and though they appear to be more natural than the gluon junction mechanism , all the models are in quite good agreement with the central data . in order to understand the data further and",
    "differentiate between the models , we require realistic calculations as a function of centrality .",
    "in summary , we have shown that both the @xmath8 and @xmath11 ratios are independent of @xmath3 up to 4.5 and 6 gev / c respectively .",
    "this finding is inconsistent with the pqcd model presented in the @xmath3 range considered .",
    "we have also found that the @xmath13 ratio increases smoothly as a function of increasing centrality in the intermediate @xmath3 region , to a plateau value of approximately 1.8 in the most central collisions .",
    "this ratio then falls again , reducing to below unity at a @xmath3 of approximately 5 gev / c , though the ratio is still above the value from p+p collisions at the same energy .",
    "we also presented the @xmath6 values for the @xmath34 and the @xmath14 , which showed that the observed suppression does not originate from the hadrons mass , but rather that the suppression is different for baryons and mesons .",
