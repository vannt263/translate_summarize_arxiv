    "while the half - metallic character of the pristine z - sicnr is maintained in the presence of a single @xmath1 , we found that a single @xmath0 leads to a transition from half - metallic to metallic behavior in z - sicnrs , and double @xmath2 and @xmath3 can transform half - metallic z - sicnrs into semiconducting systems .",

    "single @xmath1 induced the largest magnetic moment among the defects investigated , but this defect has higher formation energy and is energetically unfavorable when compared with the single @xmath0 and double @xmath3 .",
    "the ferromagnetic ground state was shown to be more stable than the antiferromagnetic state ; therefore , room - temperature ferromagnetism was also speculated in defected z - sicnrs . to reduce the defect formation energy of single @xmath1 and realize it experimentally , the interactions of substitutional b and n impurities with this native defect were also studied .",
    "we found that a b atom substituting a si atom , as well as a n atom substituting a c atom in the presence of vacancies , leads to a considerable reduction of the defect formation energy of @xmath1 .",
