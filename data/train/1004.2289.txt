    "a novel quantum gravity model , which claims power - counting renormalizability , has been formulated recently by horava   @xcite .",
    "this scenario is based on an anisotropy between space and time coordinates , which is expressed via the scalings @xmath11 and @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is a dynamical critical exponent . for @xmath14 the uv behaviour of the model",
    "is governed by a non - standard lifshitz fixed point , while for @xmath15 we recover the well - known free gaussian fixed point . in the horava model , for three spatial dimensions , the suitable choice is @xmath16 .",
    "it is worth noting that in the horava - lifshitz ( hl ) gravity the four - dimensional diffeomorphism invariance of general relativity is sacrificed in order to achieve power - counting renormalizability .",
    "the action of the model can be split into a kinetic plus a potential term , which both respect a restricted @xmath17 diffeomorphism invariance .",
    "the interesting feature is that the kinetic term contains only second order time derivatives , while the potential term consists of higher order spatial derivatives of the metric components .",
    "this particular structure improves significantly the uv properties of the graviton propagator , and renders the model power - counting renormalizable .",
    "moreover , in this way we avoid ghost modes which are usual in conventional higher order gravity models .    for the construction of the potential term , there has been proposed @xcite the so called `` detailed balance principle '' , which is inspired by condensed matter physics .",
    "the main advantage of this approach is the restriction of the large number of arbitrary couplings that appear in the bare action of the model .",
    "however , the physical motivation for a consideration such as the `` detailed balance '' is not clear @xcite .",
    "an alternative way for constructing an action is to include all possible operators which are compatible with the renormalizability of the model ; this implies that all operators with dimension less or equal to six are allowed in the action ( for the exact form of the action see @xcite ) .",
    "as it has been already mentioned , the hl gravity violates local lorentz invariance in the uv , however it is expected that general relativity is recovered in the ir limit .",
    "this implies a very special renormalization group flow for the couplings of the model .",
    "in particular , the parameter @xmath18 in the kinetic term of the action ( which measures the departure from the lorentz invariance ) should flow to unity , while the higher order couplings should vanish , or they should become appropriately small , in the ir .",
    "note that , even though phenomenology suggests a particular ir limit there is no theoretical study supporting this behaviour .",
    "in addition , there are several other possible inconsistencies in hl gravity which have been discussed in several works .",
    "in particular , the absence of full diffeomorphism invariance introduces an additional scalar mode which can lead to strong coupling problems or instabilities ( see for example @xcite-@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "however , these problems will not be addressed in the present paper .",
    "apart from these problems , the hl gravity is an interesting quantum gravity theory , which has stimulated an extended research on cosmology and black hole solutions @xcite , @xcite-@xcite .",
    "in addition to general relativity studies , quantum field theory models in flat space - time with anisotropy have also been considered @xcite-@xcite . before proceeding it is important to mention that the hl gravity can be separated into two versions which are known as projectable and non - projectable . in the projectable version",
    "the lapse function @xmath19 depends only on the time coordinate , while in the non  projectable version @xmath19 is a function of both the space and time coordinates .",
    "although in general relativity the projectable and non - projectable ansatz for the metric are equivalent , since they are connected via a diffeomorphism transformation , in the hl gravity the full diffeomorphism invariance is broken and they lead to two distinct theories .    issues connected with broken lorentz invariance were studied in the spherically symmetric solutions of 4d hl gravity . in the case of detailed balance ,",
    "such spherically symmetric solutions were found @xcite , but they exhibited an unconventional large distance asymptotic behaviour .",
    "the correct schwarzchild - flat asymptotic behaviour can be recovered if the detailed balance action is modified in the ir by a term proportional to ricci scalar , and the cosmological constant term is considered to be zero @xcite .",
    "a similar study , in the case of non - vanishing cosmological constant , has also been carried out @xcite .",
    "a generalization to topological black holes was obtained in @xcite .",
    "finally , a systematic study of static spherically symmetric solutions of 4d hl gravity was presented in @xcite where the most general spherically symmetric solution for @xmath20 and general coupling parameters was obtained .    in this work we present a full study of spherically symmetric solutions in the non - projectable version of the five - dimensional horava - lifshitz gravity , for @xmath21 .",
    "for the construction of the 5d action we do not use the `` detailed balance principle '' , but we include all the terms which are compatible with the renormalizability of the model",
    ". in particular , we can include all spatial curvature terms with dimension less than or equal to eight .",
    "however , the large number of possible terms , which are allowed in the action , leads to equation of motion of great complexity .",
    "for this reason we restrict our study only to terms of up to second order in the curvature . also , we suppose that in the ir limit 5d the hl gravity reduces to the 5d general relativity plus a bulk cosmological constant . a class of spherically symmetric solutions of the 5d hl gravity has been considered previously @xcite , but only for a very specific choice of the couplings .",
    "our main motivation in considering static solutions in 5d hl gravity is to investigate whether the rich spectrum of black hole solutions found in 4d ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) also persists in 5d .",
    "it seems that the known static solutions of the hl gravity in 4d with @xmath22 do not have any obvious relation with the corresponding static solutions of the relativistic 4d gravity .",
    "in 5d however we found that there is a class of spherically symmetric solutions which after a proper identification of coupling parameters coincide with the known black hole solutions of conventional relativistic 5d gauss - bonnet gravity .",
    "static solutions of 5d gauss - bonnet theory are well known @xcite . among them",
    "there is a black hole solution which has two branches ( for a review see @xcite ) .",
    "the first branch is referred to as the einstein branch while the second as the gauss - bonnet branch .",
    "both branches coincide in the chern - simons limit .",
    "as we will discuss in the following , we find both branches of solutions and in addition these solutions can also be obtained for a different combination of coupling parameters of the quadratic curvature terms than the usual combination that appears in the relativistic gauss - bonnet theory .",
    "we also find the black hole solution corresponding to the chern - simons limit with a particular choice of coupling parameters .",
    "this solution has also been found in @xcite using the `` detailed balance principle '' .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we write down the action of 5d hl gravity . in section 3",
    "we derive the equations of motion . in section 4",
    "we analyze the static spherically symmetric solutions for a special choice of coupling parameters . in section 5",
    "we study the most general static spherically symmetric solutions of 5d horava - lifshitz gravity and finally section 6 contains our conclusions .",
    "in this section we introduce the notation for the so - called horava gravity models in the case of four spatial dimensions ( @xmath23 ) .",

    "@xmath30 and @xmath31 are the `` lapse '' and `` shift '' functions which are used in general relativity in order to split the space - time dimensions , and @xmath32 is the spatial metric of signature ( + , + , + , + ) . for the dimensions of `` lapse '' and `` shift '' functions we obtain @xmath33=0 , ~~[n_i]=z-1~.\\ ] ] in this paper the dynamical exponent @xmath13 is set equal to @xmath34 the 5d action of the model is constructed from a kinetic plus a potential term according to the equation [ action ] s = dt d^d x n \\ { l_k+l_v } in which @xmath35 ( @xmath36 ) is the spatial dimension and @xmath37 is the five dimensional newton constant .",
    "we stress that the main motivation for considering models of this type is the construction of a power - counting renormalizable gravity model .",
    "however , in order to achieve renormalizibility , and simultaneously keep the time derivatives up to second order , we have to sacrifice the standard 5d diffeomorphism invariance of general relativity , which is now restricted to the transformation [ diffeo ] ^i=(x^j , t ) ,   = ( t )  . the kinetic part in the above lagrangian of eq .",

    "( [ diffeo ] ) .",
    "for the construction of the potential term we will not follow the standard detailed balance principle , but we will use the more general approach @xcite , according to which the potential term is constructed by including all possible renormalizable operators , that have dimension smaller or equal to eight , hence we write _ v= l_r+l_r^2+l_r^3+l_r^2+l_r^4+l_r^3 + l_^2r^2  . where the symbol @xmath38 is defined as @xmath39 ( @xmath40 ) .",

    "note that in the case of three spatial dimensions the term @xmath47 is absent , as the weyl tensor in three dimensions automatically vanishes .",
    "however , in four spatial dimensions this term can not be omitted from the action .",
    "the first term @xmath41 is necessary in order to recover 5d general relativity with a cosmological constant in the ir limit .",
    "the second term @xmath42 , includes all possible quadratic terms in curvature , and becomes important in the short distance regime of the theory .",
    "moreover , @xmath48 plays the role of the cosmological constant , while @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 , and @xmath52 are dimensionful coupling constants with dimensions = 6 ,   [ _ 2a]=[_2b]=[_2c]=4  . in the present analysis",
    "we ignore higher order lagrangian terms , of dimension six and eight .",

    "where @xmath53 .",
    "the short distance effects of these terms may be important , but this topic is left for a future investigation .",
    "if this model is to make sense , it is necessary that the 5d general relativity ( with a cosmological constant in our case ) is recovered in the ir limit .",
    "although there is no theoretical proof for this difficult question , we will assume that the renormalization group flow towards the ir leads the parameter @xmath18 to the value one ( @xmath54 ) , hence 5d general relativity is recovered .",
