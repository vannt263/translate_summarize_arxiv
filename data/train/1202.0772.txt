    "the physics of three - level quantum systems ( atoms ) interacting with quantized modes of electromagnetic field is very rich , and many special cases were studied in numerous papers ( see , e.g. , knightmil80,yooeb , chum88,buz90,gereb90,shum91,alex95,wu97,xu99,klim00,luk02,mess03 and references therein ) . in the majority of studies ,",
    "the coefficients of the hamiltonians describing such systems were assumed time - independent .",
    "time - dependent couplings were considered , e.g. , in @xcite , but under the restriction of adiabatic variations . here",
    "we consider the light - matter dynamics when a three - level atom interacts with a single cavity mode , whose frequency is rapidly modulated according to the harmonical law @xmath0 $ ] with a small modulation depth , @xmath1 .",
    "we shall use dimensionless variables , setting @xmath2 .",
    "such a situation can arise , in particular , if the selected mode describes the evolution of electromagnetic field in a cavity with vibrating walls , and one of the most impressive manifestations can be the so called dynamical casimir effect ( dce ) , i.e. , the photon generation from the initial vacuum state induced by the motion of boundaries revdce , revdal . the simplest model describing this effect is based on the hamiltonian @xmath3 where @xmath4 and @xmath5 are the cavity annihilation and creation operators , and @xmath6 is the photon number operator .",
    "the specific feature of the dce is that two functions @xmath7 and @xmath8 are related as follows @xcite : @xmath9if the modulation frequency @xmath10 is close to the parametric resonance frequency , @xmath11 with @xmath12 , then one can expect an exponential growth of the mean number of photons inside the _ empty ideal _",
    "cavity @xcite .",
    "in particular , the mean number of photons created from the initial vacuum state for @xmath13 equals @xmath14    however , the situation can be very different if the field mode interacts with a detector while the cavity walls oscillate .",
    "for example , it was shown in @xcite that no more than _ two photons _ can be created in the cavity if the field - atom coupling is much stronger than the modulation depth @xmath15 . in view of the recent progress in experiments on simulating dce @xcite ,",
    "the detailed study of different detection schemes becomes a timely and important task .",
    "recently , various regimes of the _ two - level _ detectors were analyzed in @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , _ three - level _ detectors can be more realistic @xcite , besides , they have several advantages @xcite .",
    "therefore we consider the evolution of the single - mode cavity field interacting with a three - level atom , whose free hamiltonian is @xmath16 ( where @xmath17 is the @xmath18th energy level , @xmath19 is the atomic energy eigenstate and @xmath20 ) .",
    "we are interested in the cases where the atom - field interaction modifies severely the atomless dce .",
    "therefore we assume that the @xmath21 transition is resonant with the unperturbed cavity frequency , @xmath22 .",
    "[ f1 ] depicts two atomic level structures we consider here : the ladder ( or @xmath23 ) configuration and the v configuration , where @xmath24 and @xmath25 @xmath26 are the transition frequencies .",
    "we also define the detunings between the cavity unperturbed frequency and the other atomic transition frequency as @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "the set of constants @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 quantifies the atom - field dipolar coupling strengths between the energy levels as shown in fig .",
    "we assume these constants to be real and @xmath32 ( although this is not the most general case , such a choice describes the main phenomena in the most simple way ) and much smaller than unity .",
    "the corresponding light - matter interaction hamiltonians are chosen in the standard jaynes ",
    "cummings form ( i.e. , we neglect the counter - rotating terms ) : @xmath33 @xmath34 where @xmath35 stands for the hermitian conjugate .    the questions we try to answer are : 1 ) how the presence of the third level can influence the number of created photons and the photon number distribution and 2 ) how big can the occupation probabilities of different levels be ( this is important from the point of view of the detection of dce ) . for this purpose",
    "we solved numerically the schrdinger equation @xmath36 for the wavefunction of the total system , expanding this function over the atomic and fock bases .",
    "exact equations for the coefficients of this expansion were solved numerically using the runge - kutta - verner fifth - order and sixth - order method , truncating the photon number space at the value @xmath37 . in this paper",
    "we focus on the amplification of the vacuum fluctuations , so we consider only the zero - excitation initial state , @xmath38 .    to be closer to realistic experimental conditions , we took into account in some cases ( where the mean number of created photons was limited ) a possibility of damping in the atomic degrees of freedom ( but neglecting the dissipation in the field mode , assuming that the cavity quality factor is high enough ) , using the lindblad - type markovian master equation for the total statistical operator @xmath39 of the atom - field system ( in the ladder configuration ) @xmath40 + \\lambda \\mathfrak{d}\\left [ \\sigma _ { 12}% \\right ] \\rho + \\lambda _ { 2}\\mathfrak{d}[\\sigma _ { 23}]\\rho ,   \\label{meq}\\]]where @xmath41 and @xmath42 are the damping rates for the transitions @xmath43 and @xmath44 , respectively , and the lindblad kernel is @xmath45\\rho \\equiv ( 2o\\rho o^{\\dagger } -o^{\\dagger } o\\rho -\\rho o^{\\dagger } o)/2~.\\]]the maximal number of photons taken into account in such cases was @xmath46 due to the necessity to calculate off - diagonal matrix elements not only in the atomic basis but also in the fock one .",
    "we checked that the normalization conditions were fulfilled with an accuracy better than @xmath47 in all the cases .",
    "the results of numerical calculations are exposed in the next two sections together with some approximate analytical solutions clarifying them .",

    "<S> we consider the scenario in which a damped three - level atom in the ladder or v configurations is coupled to a single cavity mode whose vacuum state is amplified by dint of the dynamical casimir effect . </S>",
    "<S> we obtain approximate analytical expressions and exact numerical results for the time - dependent probabilities , demonstrating that the presence of the third level modifies the photon statistics and its population can serve as a witness of photon generation from vacuum . </S>"
