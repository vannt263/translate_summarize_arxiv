( 3 ) phase iii or h - a phase : at @xmath1 above 150 gpa , a third phase is observed , expected to be another kind of orientationally ordered phase .    in 1996 ,",
    "weir and coworkers gave one of the exciting results .",
    "they observed high electrical conductivity in the shock compressed h@xmath0 and d@xmath0 liquids and interpreted it as a transition from a semiconducting to a metallic diatomic fluid at 140 gpa and 3000k .",
    "@xcite this experiment clearly demonstrates the importance of temperature effects in the search of metallization . for @xmath2 larger than 5000k , the effects are studied theoretically in the molecular , the dissociated , and the plasma regime of dense h@xmath0 .",
    "@xcite it is , however , still largely unclear how @xmath2 influences the state of solid h@xmath0 at @xmath2 higher than the room temperature .",
    "we need to know the phase diagram at this temperature region to connect the liquid state with the low - temperature phases for a comprehensive understanding of dense h@xmath0 .",

    "several methods have been adopted at various levels of approximations to the _ ab initio _",
    "hamiltonian representing the coupled system of @xmath7 protons and @xmath7 electrons .",
    "these include the calculation of electronic energies in the local density approximation ( lda ) or its refinements to the density functional theory for a variety of crystal structures with molecular orientations fixed to some particular configuration , @xcite and the implementation of _ ab initio _ molecular dynamics treating protons as classical particles.@xcite we should note , however , that the strong quantum nature of light protons requires a more careful quantum - mechanical description of their zero - point motion .",
    "in fact , using either the first - principle path - integral molecular dynamics @xcite or the quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) simulations , @xcite the calculation treating protons as dynamic quantum particles has already been performed . although desirable , this approach demands the computer resources very much .",

    "the system is reduced to a quantum - mechanical problem of @xmath9 ( = 2@xmath7 ) molecules interacting to each other through an effective intermolecular pair potential @xmath10 .",

    "within the temperature and pressure range that a molecule can be regarded as a basic ingredient , a quantum molecular solid can be described by the hamiltonian @xmath11 as the sum of @xmath12 and @xmath13 , where @xmath14 and @xmath15 here @xmath16 is the center - of - mass position vector of the @xmath17th molecule , @xmath18 its orientation vector , @xmath19 its angular momentum operator , and the intermolecular separation vector @xmath20 .",

    "@xcite among the the nuclear degrees of freedom , we include both translation and rotation modes of molecules in the kinetic energy @xmath12 , but we consider implicitly the intramolecular vibration mode along with the electronic degrees of freedom by judiciously choosing @xmath10 the pair - wise sum of which gives the potential energy @xmath13 .",
    "we have enough evidence to support the present approach in our research range ( @xmath26gpa and @xmath27k ) .",
    "first , we can neglect the molecular dissociation , because its fraction is less than 0.01% from the same analysis as the one leading to about 5% at 140gpa and 3000k .",
    "@xcite secondly , _ ab initio _ quantum - chemistry calculations at @xmath9=2 lead us to the conclusion that the dependence of @xmath10 on the bond length @xmath28 is weak , even though @xmath28 shrinks by more than 10% from 1.4 bohr ( 0.74 ) as two h@xmath5 molecules come closer .",

    "the notion of @xmath10 is relevant if @xmath29 the intermolecular distance is larger than about 2.3 bohr ( 1.2 ) , because each molecule is estimated to possess a repulsive core of the radius of 0.6 .",

    "@xcite in general , the multi - dimensional function @xmath30 can be expressed as the sum of the isotropic pair potential @xmath31 and the anisotropic potential @xmath32 .",
    "a variety of analytic forms have been proposed for @xmath33 and their relevance has been tested in the past .",
    "four of them are illustrated in fig .",

    "although they have almost the same analytic form , @xmath34 is fitted to the gas - phase data , while @xmath35 to the solid - phase data . in order to include the three - body interactions effectively in the solid environment ,",
    "a further refinement is introduced to the original form of @xmath35 by incorporating an additional repulsive term , leading to the final form of sg potential .",
    "compared to @xmath34 , the net effects contributed from the three - body interaction are a hardening of @xmath35 at small @xmath36 and a slight raising of the well depth .",
    "their concrete forms can be found in refs .  , and .",
    "this @xmath37 works well for the solid h@xmath5 and d@xmath5 under ambient pressures . under high pressures , however , an additional softening effect found by hemley _",
    "et al_. is needed to correctly describe the enhanced many - body contributions in the short - range region caused by the dense solid environment .",
    "this effect can be incorporated by an _",
    "ad hoc _ short - range correction @xmath38 to @xmath37 , @xcite leading to the definition of the hemley - corrected sg potential @xmath39 ( the solid curve in fig .",

    "in fact , @xmath39 gives results in excellent agreement with the experimental data , @xcite while @xmath37 does not .",
    "the same conclusion is also drawn at @xmath43k from a similar test ; for @xmath1 up to 200gpa , @xmath39 provides the results for the eos in line with the experimentally obtained fitting formula .",

    "<S> we study the effect of temperature up to 1000k on the structure of dense molecular _ para_-hydrogen ( _ p_-h@xmath0 ) and _ ortho_-deuterium ( _ o_-d@xmath0 ) , using the path - integral monte carlo method . </S>",
    "<S> we find a structural phase transition from orientationally disordered hexagonal close packed ( hcp ) to an orthorhombic structure of _ cmca _ symmetry before melting . </S>",
    "<S> the transition is basically induced by thermal fluctuations , but quantum fluctuations of protons ( deuterons ) are important in determining the transition temperature through effectively hardening the intermolecular interaction . </S>",
    "<S> we estimate the phase line between hcp and _ cmca _ phases as well as the melting line of the _ cmca _ solid . </S>",
