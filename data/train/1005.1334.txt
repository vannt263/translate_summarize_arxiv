    "it is a fact , well established by plenty of experiments and theoretical works , that the large - scale physics of systems at critical points can be described by scale - invariant continuum field theories @xcite . in many cases the associated probability distributions are besides scale invariant also translation and rotation invariant when expressed in appropriate variables . during the past 25 years",
    "it has become widely appreciated that in those cases where long - range interactions are absent or may be ignored , such invariance under translations , rotations , and scale transformations usually entails the invariance under a larger symmetry group  that of conformal transformations @xcite .",
    "the application of conformal invariance to critical phenomena started long ago with a short note by polyakov @xcite .",
    "more detailed investigations @xcite followed soon , but the issue did not receive much attention until the seminal work of belavin et al @xcite on two - dimensional conformal field theories .",
    "this revealed the enormous potential of conformal invariance , triggering an outburst of research activities , which in turn led to impressive success in many other fields , such as bulk , finite - size @xcite , and boundary critical behavior @xcite , polymer physics @xcite , quantum impurity problems @xcite , and string theories @xcite .",
    "conformal transformations locally correspond to combinations of translations , rotations , and scale transformations with a position - dependent scale factor @xmath6 that involve no shear .",
    "thus , conformal invariance may be viewed as the generalization of a global symmetry to a local one .",
    "there exists a wealth of systems in nature that exhibit global scale invariance of a distinct and more general kind , called _ anisotropic scale invariance _ ( asi ) .",
    "its characteristic feature is that an anisotropic rescaling of the space separations ( or spacetime separations in time - dependent phenomena ) along various axes by at least two ( or more ) distinct powers of a scale factor @xmath7 is required to make such systems statistically self - similar .",
    "familiar examples are uniaxial dipolar ferro- and antiferromagnets at their critical points ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite ) , systems at lifshitz points @xcite , and dynamical critical phenomena near and away from thermal equilibrium @xcite , among them driven diffusive systems @xcite , stochastic surface - growth processes @xcite , directed percolation , and spreading processes @xcite .    in the case of static critical behavior at an @xmath0-axial lifshitz point ( lp ) in @xmath1 space dimensions , the position vector @xmath8 of cartesian coordinates @xmath9 can be decomposed as @xmath10 into the @xmath0- and ( @xmath11)-dimensional components @xmath12 and @xmath13 with @xmath14 and @xmath15 , respectively .",
    "asi is encoded in the transformation property @xmath16 of local scaling operators @xmath17 with scaling dimensions @xmath18 , where @xmath19 , the anisotropy exponent , differs from @xmath20 .",
    "the obvious analog for time - dependent phenomena involving an isotropic rescaling of distances but distinct rescaling of time reads @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the so - called dynamic critical exponent . as a consequence of these properties ,",
    "the multi - point correlation functions of such operators take scaling forms .",
    "consider , for example , the case of eq .",
    "( [ eq : asiost ] ) , and assume that the systems are translation invariant in both time and space , as well as rotation invariant . together with the presumed asi , these properties imply that the two - point cumulant function of two such operators @xmath23 and @xmath24 can be written as @xmath25    given the enormous success the use of conformal invariance has had in the study of isotropic critical behavior , a natural question to ask is whether global asi , in conjunction with appropriate other global symmetries , such as translation and rotation invariance , would again entail more powerful local symmetries that impose useful constraints on the scaling functions or even determine them completely .    this idea has been pursued for many years , in particular , by henkel who proposed a phenomenological approach termed `` local scale invariance ( lsi ) '' in a series of papers @xcite and applied it to a variety of systems exhibiting asi .",
    "postulating a set of `` axioms of local scale invariance '' , he suggested that the two - point scaling functions @xmath26 of various systems exhibiting asi should satisfy differential equations .",
    "according to him there should be two classes of local generalizations of asi : the first , denoted type i , should apply to anisotropic scale - invariant equilibrium systems ; the second , type ii , to time - dependent scale - invariant phenomena . as a nontrivial example of type ii , the relaxational behavior of systems representing the dynamic universality class of the so - called stochastic model a @xcite , following a quench from an initial disordered state to the critical point ,",
    "was suggested .",
    "subsequent analytical calculations based on the @xmath27 expansion for model a @xcite yielded definite , albeit small , violations of henkel s predictions at two - loop order .    as nontrivial realizations of his type i of generalized asi ,",
    "henkel suggested equilibrium systems at @xmath0-axial lp . to check the predictions of his theory , pleimling and him performed extensive monte carlo simulations @xcite for the two - point correlation function of the @xmath5 dimensional axial next - nearest - neighbor ising ( annni ) model @xcite at its uniaxial lp . in their original application of the phenomenological lsi approach to this problem , they assumed that the anisotropy exponent @xmath19 takes its classical value @xmath28 .",
    "their theory then predicted the scaling function to be a linear combination of two linearly independent solutions of a differential equation , involving a single free parameter which they determined from monte carlo data for moments .",
    "the so - obtained scaling function appeared to be in perfect agreement with their monte carlo data .",
    "however , the @xmath29 expansion about the upper critical dimension @xmath30 yields deviations of @xmath19 from its classical value @xmath31 at order @xmath32 @xcite .",

    "@xcite generalized their lsi predictions for the scaling function by expanding in @xmath37 .",
    "they found that the resulting predictions remained in agreement with their monte carlo data provided a value for @xmath19 sufficiently close to @xmath31 ( @xmath38 ) was chosen .    unlike the case of type ii ,",
    "henkel s predictions obtained via his phenomenological lsi approach have not yet been checked in a systematic fashion by mathematically well controlled analytical calculations .",
    "the only exceptions we are aware of are mean spherical models .",
    "their propagators at the lp are those of massless free field theories .",
    "lsi does not lead to new nontrivial consequences for them .",
    "hence they are unsuitable for critical checks of the predictive power and viability of this approach . in view of the apparent excellent agreement of the monte carlo data of ref .",
    "@xcite with the scaling function obtained by the lsi approach we feel that nontrivial checks of this approach through analytical calculations for nontrivial models of type - i systems are urgently needed .",
    "the aim of this paper is to perform such checks . to this end",
    "we shall investigate standard @xmath33-component @xmath39 models for the description of critical behavior at @xmath0-axial lp , use the @xmath40 expansion to compute appropriate two - point scaling functions , and compare the results with the predictions of henkel s lsi approach .",
    "for the sake of simplicity , we shall focus our attention in most of our work on the uniaxial case @xmath4 .",
    "we begin in section  [ sec : revlsi ] with a brief review of the main predictions of this theory for the scaling functions of such type - i systems . in section  [ sec : rv ] we first discuss the region of validity of the suggested invariance equations of the two - point correlation function in position space .",
    "we then transform these equations to momentum space , and discuss the consequences for the scaling forms of the fourier transformed two - point functions . in section [ sec : model ] we introduce the standard continuum model representing the universality class of critical behavior at @xmath0-axial lp in @xmath1 dimensions .",
    "we then investigate the @xmath29 expansion for the energy - density correlation function , using dimensional regularization in conjunction with minimal subtraction of ultraviolet ( uv ) poles . in section [ sec : corrfctdm3 ]",
    "we focus on the analytically tractable cases @xmath41 and @xmath42 . the former has the simplifying feature that the scaling function of the free propagator in position space reduces at the lp to a gaussian .",
    "this allows us to obtain explicit expressions for the energy - density and order - parameter correlation functions to order @xmath32 and cast them in scaling form . in section",
    "[ sec : endens ] we determine the two - point correlation function of the energy density for the uniaxial case @xmath4 to two - loop order",
    ". a detailed comparison of our results for this and the previously mentioned correlation functions at the lp with the predictions of henkel s phenomenological theory follows in section [ sec : concl ] .",
    "it shows that these predictions do not hold except in the trivial case of a gaussian lp .",
    "whenever loop corrections to the correlation functions can not be neglected in the interacting case , the predicted scaling functions are inconsistent with our findings .",
    "finally , there are four appendices to which we have relegated various computational details .",
    "our objective is to check the predictions of the lsi theory proposed in refs .",
    "@xcite for strongly anisotropic critical systems of type i. we begin by recalling the basic postulates on which this theory is based and its conjectured properties of scaling functions .    to this end , we consider the pair correlation functions of two quasiprimary scaling operators @xmath43 , @xmath44 , with zero averages @xmath45 and the behavior   under global scale transformations .",
    "for the sake of notational simplicity , we focus on the uniaxial case @xmath4 . in order to facilitate comparisons with henkel s work",

    "this he generalizes by allowing for values of @xmath57 and anomalous dimensions of scalar quasiprimary fields .",
    "he then imposed the requirement that the generators yield a finite number of independent conditions when applied to the two - point functions of quasiprimary fields . exploiting the consequences",
    ", he was able to identify two distinct classes of systems , called type i and type ii , respectively .",
    "for the type - i systems with which we are concerned here , the anisotropy exponent @xmath19 is constrained to the fractional values @xmath58 so that eq .",
    "simplifies to @xmath59    the other assumptions of henkel are that the @xmath60 are also annihilated by generators denoted as @xmath61 and @xmath62 defined via @xmath63 and @xmath64 where @xmath65 is a nonzero parameter .    note that when @xmath66 is taken to be an arbitrary real number so that the condition   is not satisfied , the generators @xmath67 and @xmath62 involve fractional derivatives .",

    "background on this matter and henkel s choice of their definition can be found in reference ( * ? ? ?",
    "* appendix a ) .",
    "we shall exclusively have to deal with the above equations in those cases where condition   is satisfied .",
    "all derivatives then reduce to conventional partial derivatives of first and higher orders . clearly , any acceptable definition of fractional derivatives @xmath68 must reduce to such standard derivatives for nonnegative integer values of @xmath70 , i.e. , when @xmath66 becomes a natural number .",
    "henkel s choice indeed fulfills this condition . we therefore do not have to worry about potential differences resulting from distinct definitions of fractional derivatives here and in the following .",
