    "the discovery of the higgs boson at the lhc finally completes the standard model .",
    "the next step is the discovery of physics beyond the standard model .",
    "this can be done directly by searching for new particles , or indirectly by searching for new interactions of the standard model particles .",
    "indirect searches for new physics can be done model - independently by means of effective field theory @xcite .",
    "an effective field theory is a low - energy approximation of a higher - energy theory . by integrating out high - energy degrees of freedom ,",
    "one obtains a low - energy theory that includes additional effective interactions which involve only low - energy fields .",
    "one obtains a perturbative expansion in which effective interactions , or operators , are suppressed by inverse powers of the mass scale of the physics which has been integrated out .",
    "if , as in our case , one does not know the high - energy theory , a complete operator basis can be written down at each order .",
    "the standard model operators have mass dimension four or less .",
    "the only possible operator of dimension five generates majorana neutrino masses and does not concern us here @xcite .",
    "thus , the lowest - dimension effective operators are of dimension six . we can write down an effective field theory which extends the standard model in the following form @xmath3 where the @xmath4 are dimension - six operators , @xmath5 is the mass scale of new physics , and the @xmath6 are dimensionless coefficients that reflect our ignorance of the high - energy theory .",
    "this expansion reduces to the standard model in the limit @xmath7 .",
    "a complete basis of operators @xmath4 comprises operators which are independent with respect to equations of motion and which are @xmath8 gauge - invariant @xcite . aside from reducing the number of independent operators",
    ", this latter condition guarantees a consistent framework for performing loop calculations .",
    "that is , divergences produced by an operator at a given order in @xmath9 can always be absorbed by other operators at the same order in @xmath9 .",
    "thus the renormalization program can be carried out , order - by - order , in any complete effective field theory .    in this paper",
    "we use the precision electroweak data in table  [ tab : observables ] to calculate bounds on nine dimension - six operators containing only gauge boson fields and higgs doublets .",
    "all contributions from the nine operators can be represented as gauge boson self - energies , also called oblique corrections @xcite .",

    "the renormalized tree - level coefficients , in the @xmath39 scheme , are @xmath40 where the superscript `` 0 '' indicates the bare coefficient .",
    "we now take all of the self - energy corrections from appendix  [ apdx : se ] and compute oblique corrections to the precision electroweak observables listed in table  [ tab : observables ] .",
    "we use the following values for input parameters @xmath41 the masses of all other fermions are neglected .",

    "@xmath44 where @xmath45 is the error matrix , and @xmath46 where the sum on @xmath47 runs over all loop- and tree - level operators .",
    "we begin by writing @xmath43 in the following way @xmath48 where the @xmath49 sum is over all nine operators .",
    "the @xmath50 are best - fit values .",
    "we then arrive at @xmath51 bounds by solving the equation @xmath52 it is cleanest to diagonalize the matrix @xmath53 and present bounds on the nine linearly independent combinations of operators .",
    "those bounds appear below @xmath54 we find that the tree - level and loop - level bounds are essentially decoupled from each other , as evidenced by the nearly block - diagonal form of the above matrix .",
    "the first four bounds represent bounds on linear combinations of tree - level operators and are very tightly constrained .",
    "the final five are bounds on linear combinations of loop - level operators .",
    "these bounds are weaker than the tree - level bounds by 2 to 3 orders of magnitude or more .",
    "all of the coefficients are consistent with zero at @xmath55 .",
    "we can also calculate bounds on the loop - level coefficients by first setting the tree - level coefficients to the values ( as a function of the loop - level coefficients ) that minimize @xmath43 .",
    "we again write this new @xmath43 in matrix form @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the set of all tree - level operators , and the sum on @xmath49 runs over all loop - level operators .",
    "we then follow the same procedure as before to arrive at bounds on the loop - level operators @xmath58 these bounds are identical to the bounds of eq .",
    ", highlighting the fact that the two sets of operators are decoupled in the eigenvector matrix .    we can also find bounds on each loop - level operator separately , by setting all other loop - level operators to zero and letting the relevant tree - level operators float .",
    "this gives us the following bounds @xmath59",
    "the bounds we have obtained on the loop - level operators are much weaker than the bounds obtained in similar previous analyses @xcite .",
    "these analyses set the renormalized tree - level coefficients to zero rather than letting them float .",
    "this is an unjustified assumption , as these coefficients are renormalized by the one - loop coefficients , as discussed in section  [ sec : tree_renorm ] .",
    "thus the results of these previous analyses are specious , as we discussed in ref .",
    "we discuss this further in appendix  [ apdx : ep ] .",
    "we found in ref .",
    "@xcite that the bounds on the loop - level operators @xmath60 and @xmath61 from precision electroweak physics are much weaker than the bounds from tree - level processes involving the higgs boson .",
    "the analogous result holds for the other three loop - level operators , @xmath62 , @xmath63 , and @xmath64 ; they are much more strongly constrained by tree - level processes involving the triple gauge boson vertex @xcite .",
    "thus the bounds on the bosonic operators from a one - loop analysis of precision electroweak data can not compete with the bounds obtained from tree - level processes at high - energy colliders .",
