    "the existence of an almost scale - invariant spectrum of primordial curvature perturbations on large scales , with an approximately gaussian distribution , is one of the most important observations that any model of the early universe should explain .",
    "the inflationary scenario offers a possible explanation in terms of vacuum fluctuations of scalar fields during an accelerated expansion preceding the standard hot big bang , though attempts to embed such a scenario within a fundamental theory such as superstring / m - theory may require some degree of fine - tuning ( see @xcite for a recent review ) .",
    "the ekpyrotic scenario @xcite ( see also @xcite ) is one alternative approach where the large - scale perturbations are generated from vacuum fluctuations during a collapse phase driven by a scalar field with a steep , negative exponential potential .",
    "it was shown , however , that even though the bardeen potential acquires a scale - invariant spectrum during ekpyrotic collapse , the comoving curvature perturbation has a steep blue spectrum in the original ekpyrotic scenario driven by a single scalar field @xcite .",
    "if the contracting pre - big bang phase is connected to the expanding hot big bang phase through a regular four - dimensional bounce , then we expect the comoving curvature perturbation to remain constant for adiabatic perturbations on large scales @xcite , which means that the growing mode of curvature perturbations in the expanding phase also acquires a steep blue spectrum .",
    "one way to avoid this is to consider non - adiabatic perturbations , which require two or more fields @xcite .",
    "recently , there has been progress in generating a scale - invariant spectrum for curvature perturbations in the ekpyrotic scenario with more than one field , which we will refer to as the new ekpyrotic scenario @xcite .",
    "if these fields have steep negative exponential potentials , there exists a scaling solution where the energy densities of the fields grow at the same rate during the collapse @xcite . in this multi - field",
    "scaling solution background , the isocurvature field perturbations have an almost scale - invariant spectrum @xcite , owing to a tachyonic instability in the isocurvature field .",
    "the multi - field scaling solution in the new ekpyrotic scenario can be shown to be an unstable saddle point in the phase space and the stable late - time attractor is the old ekpyrotic collapse dominated by a single field @xcite .",
    "the existence of a tachyonic instability raises questions about initial conditions in the new ekpyrotic scenario @xcite , but the transition from the multi - field scaling solution to the single - field - dominated solution also provides a mechanism to automatically convert the initial isocurvature field perturbations about the multi - field scaling solution into comoving curvature perturbations about the late - time attractor @xcite . in this case , the final amplitude of the comoving curvature perturbation is determined by the hubble scale at the transition and if this parameter and the initial conditions are set appropriately , the prediction for the primordial curvature perturbations from this scenario is compatible with an almost scale - invariant spectrum ( see @xcite for other mechanisms to convert the initial scale - invariant isocurvature perturbations into curvature perturbations ) .",
    "recently , the non - gaussianity of the distribution of primordial curvature perturbations in the inflationary scenario has been extensively studied by many authors ( see e.g.  @xcite for a review ) .",
    "measurements of the non - gaussianity already provide important constraints on specific models of the early universe and such measurements will continue to improve in the near future , for instance with the planck satellite @xcite . since the non - gaussian signal from single - field , slow - roll inflation is suppressed by slow - roll parameters to an undetectable level @xcite ,",
    "if non - gaussianities are detected then this would rule out many models of inflation .",
    "thus , as a natural extension of the study performed in @xcite , in this paper we compute the non - gaussianity of the primordial curvature perturbations generated from the contracting phase of the multi - field new ekpyrotic cosmology .",
    "we adopt the same specific model as the previous analysis of refs .",
    "@xcite where the scale - invariant curvature perturbation is generated by the transition from a scaling solution , with two fields driving the collapse , to a single - field dominated regime .",
    "we assume that the ekpyrotic collapse is subsequently converted to expansion by a regular bounce , during which the comoving curvature perturbation is conserved on large scales and the curvature perturbation generated during the collapse is thus directly related to the amplitude of the observed primordial density perturbation .",
