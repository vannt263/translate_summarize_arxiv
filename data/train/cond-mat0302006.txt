    "the ubiquity and importance of membrane realizations in nature , as cellular walls , and in laboratories , as self - assembled bilayers of lipid amphiphils , has fueled considerable scientific activities@xcite .",
    "these nearly tensionless@xcite lipid sheets are highly flexible , with elastic moduli often comparable to thermal energies .",
    "consequently , on long length scales , their conformational properties are strongly affected by thermal fluctuations .",
    "this , together with early successes in understanding a variety of puzzling phenomena ( such as for example red blood cells flicker@xcite , biconcave shape of eurythrocites@xcite , and period of lyotropics ) in terms of continuum models of fluctuating elastic sheets , has attracted the attention of the physics community .",
    "consequently , significant progress has been made in understanding the statistical mechanics of fluctuating membranes@xcite    it is by now well - appreciated that the nature of a membrane s in - plane order , with three ( heretofore studied ) universality classes , the isotropic , hexatic and solid ( i.e. , tethered or polymerized ) , crucially affects its conformational properties .",
    "the most striking effect of in - plane orders is the stabilization in solid membranes of a",
    " flat \" phase@xcite , with long - range orientational order in the local membrane normals@xcite , that is favored at low - temperature over the entropically preferred high - temperature crumpled state .",
    "therefore , in marked contrast to liquid membranes and one - dimensional polymer analogs , which are always crumpled ( beyond a persistence length)@xcite , tethered membranes , despite of being two - dimensional@xcite are predicted@xcite to undergo a thermodynamically sharp crumpled - to - flat phase transition@xcite .",
    "the ordering is made possible by a subtle interplay of thermal fluctuations with nonlinear membrane elasticity , which , at long scales infinitely enhances a membrane s bending rigidity , thereby stabilizing the orientational order against these very fluctuations .",
    "this novel `` order from disorder '' phenomenon , and the universal `` anomalous elasticity '' , namely , length - scale dependent elastic moduli , non - hookean stress - strain relation , and a universal negative poisson ratio@xcite , are now known to be quite commonly exhibited by many other `` soft '' systems subjected to fluctuations . in this paper we introduce and explore a new universality class of _ solid _ membranes , that _ spontaneously _ develop an _ in - plane _ orientational nematic order .",
    "our motivation is two - fold .",
    "firstly , our interest is driven by experimental progress in the synthesis of nematic liquid crystal elastomers@xcite , statistically isotropic and homogeneous gels of crosslinked polymers ( rubber ) , with main- or side - chain mesogens , that can _ spontaneously _ develop nematic orientational order . even in the absence of fluctuations",
    ", they were predicted@xcite and later observed to display an array of fascinating phenomena@xcite , the most striking of which is the vanishing of stress for a range of strain , applied transversely to the nematic direction .",
    "this striking softness is generic , stemming from the spontaneous orientational symmetry breaking by the nematic state@xcite that ensures the presence of a zero - energy goldstone mode , corresponding to the observed@xcite soft distortion and strain - induced director reorientation .",
    "the hidden rotational symmetry also guarantees a vanishing of one of the five elastic constants@xcite that usually characterize harmonic deformations of a three - dimensional uniaxial solid@xcite .",
    "thermal fluctuations lead to grinstein - pelcovits - like@xcite renormalization of elastic constants@xcite in bulk systems with dimensions below @xmath5 in pure systems@xcite and below @xmath6 when effects of the random network heterogeneity is taken into account@xcite .",
    "it is , therefore , likely , and indeed we find , that the elastic properties of a two - dimensional fluctuating tensionless sheet of such nematic elastomer differ _",
    "qualitatively _ from those of previously studied crystalline membranes@xcite . our aim here is to explore the effects of thermal fluctuations on this new universality class of solid membranes .",
    "our other motivation for exploring the physics of nematic elastomer membranes comes from earlier discovery by toner and one of us@xcite , that any amount of any kind of in - plane anisotropy , a seemingly innocuous generalization , significantly enriches the phase diagram of polymerized membranes .",
    "most dramatically , it was predicted@xcite that an entire new phase of membranes , called the `` tubule '' phase , always intervenes between the high - temperature crumpled and low - temperature `` flat '' phases .",
    "the defining property of the tubule phase is that it is crumpled in one of the two membranes directions but `` flat '' ( i.e. , extended ) in the other , with its thickness , roughness , and anomalous elasticity displaying universal behaviors controlled by a nontrivial , infrared stable fixed point@xcite .",
    "the tubule phase has since been observed in monte carlo simulations@xcite of non - self - avoiding ( i.e. , phantom ) anisotropic membranes with properties ( the thickness , roughness , and poisson ratio ) in close qualitative and quantitative accord with the predictions of radzihovsky and toner@xcite .    although it was an _",
    "explicit _ rotational symmetry breaking ( anisotropy ) that was considered by the authors of ref .",
    ", we expect a similar , but qualitatively distinct tubule phase to be also displayed by the _",
    "spontaneously _ anisotropic elastomer membranes considered in this paper .",
    "however , we leave the subject of the global phase diagram , the elastomer tubule phase , and the phase transitions between it and the flat and crumpled phases for a future publication@xcite . here",
    "we instead focus on the formulation of models of nematically - ordered elastomer membranes and the study of long - length - scale properties of its flat phase .",
    "past extensive investigations , both in the context of defected crystalline membranes@xcite and liquid crystals confined in rigid gels ( e.g. , aerogels and aerosils)@xcite , demonstrated that arbitrarily weak heterogeneity qualitatively modifies the long - scale nature of liquid - crystal orders , membranes morphologies and elasticities .",
    "we , therefore , expect that local heterogeneity in an elastomer network will also become qualitatively important on sufficiently long scales and will likely dominate over the thermal fluctuation effects that are the subject of this paper .",
    "however , here we consider the idealized limit of elastomer membranes in which the effective quenched disorder is sufficiently weak that its effects are unimportant on scales shorter than some very long disorder - determined length scale .",
    "we leave the study of these heterogeneity effects for a future investigation@xcite .",

    "[ sec:2dmem ] , we investigate mean - field theory and harmonic fluctuations in physically realizable two - dimensional membranes embedded in a three - dimensional space .",
    "we find that harmonic fluctuations in these membranes do not destroy long - range in - plane nematic order in spite of enhanced fluctuations relative to an isotropic system arising from the soft goldstone mode . in sec .",

    "although physical membranes are two - dimensional manifolds in a three - dimensional space , it is often useful to consider generalizations to @xmath0-dimensional manifolds embedded in a @xmath1-dimensional space with @xmath7 . our interest is in solid membranes , which , unlike fluid membranes , have a non - vanishing shear modulus at least in their isotropic state .    to describe the geometry and fluctuations of these membranes , we need to introduce a certain amount of notation .",
    "first , we define the reference space @xmath16 .",
    "this is the @xmath0-dimensional space occupied by the membrane in its quiescent _ flat _ reference state .",
    "we denote @xmath0-dimensional vectors in this space in bold and their components with roman subscripts @xmath17 . in particular ,",
    "we denote intrinsic coordinates on the membrane by the vector @xmath18 with components @xmath19 .",

    "the reference space @xmath16 is identified as a subspace of @xmath21 .",
    "the use of orthonormal basis vectors will simplify some of our discussion , and we introduce @xmath1 vectors @xmath25 in @xmath21 with components @xmath26 satisfying @xmath27 any vector in @xmath21 can be decomposed into its components along these vectors .",
    "for example @xmath28 , where the summation convention on repeated indices is understood .",
    "we choose the set @xmath29 so that the subset of vectors @xmath30 , @xmath31 lie in @xmath16 , which we represent as a subspace of @xmath21 .",
    "thus @xmath32 we choose length scales such that the position in @xmath21 of the point @xmath20 in the reference membrane is @xmath33 describing a perfectly flat membrane configuration .",

    "earlier studies of non - liquid crystalline polymerized membranes@xcite have demonstrated that thermal fluctuations produce wild undulations about the flat state @xmath68 that make elastic nonlinearities in the height field @xmath69 ( but not in the in - plane phonon fields @xmath70 ) in @xmath71 eq .  ( [ uij ] ) important on long length scales and lead to universal length - scale - dependent elastic moduli : @xmath72 , @xmath73 , and @xmath74 .",

    "( [ h_i ] ) provides a correct description of elastic and height fluctuations of a membrane so long as the equilibrium phase is truly an isotropic flat phase .",

    "we found that undulation nonlinearities are relevant @xmath303 and dominate over the in - plane nonlinearities that only become important @xmath491 .",
    "focusing on the dominant undulation nonlinearities ( and neglecting in - plane nonlinearities ) we performed an rg calculation combined with an expansion about @xmath2 and found that for @xmath318 , bending rigidities are only finitely renormalized , while in - plane elastic moduli become singular functions of a wavevector ( i.e. , exhibit anomalous elasticity ) , vanishing with a universal power - law .",
    "this power - law is controlled by an infrared stable fixed point whose stability we analyzed in detail for the uniaxial and @xmath0-axial analytic continuations , finding agreement in fixed point structure .",
    "this analysis also allowed us to make contact and recover some of the results previously obtained in the studies of ( crystalline ) polymerized membranes .",
    "in particular we found that the so - called connected fluid is realized as a fixed point of a nematically - ordered elastomer membrane that is unstable to the globally stable nematic - elastomer fixed point .    despite of some of the success in our understanding of the behavior of nematic elastomer membranes ,",
    "there are obvious limitations of our analysis , most notably in the application of our work to the physical case of @xmath8 elastomer membranes .",
    "this shortcoming primarily has to do with the neglect of in - plane elastic nonlinearities , which , near the gaussian fixed point become relevant for @xmath491 . while it is very likely that the subdominance of these in - plane nonlinearities relative to the undulation ones will persist some amount _ below _",
    "@xcite , we expect that in the physical case of @xmath8 all three nonlinearities need to be treated on equal footing . doing this remains an open and challenging problem .",
    "we conclude with a discussion of the global conformational phase behavior of nematic elastomer membranes . as with ordinary polymerized membranes we expect , upon cooling , isotropic elastomer membranes to undergo a crumpling ( flattening ) transition from the crumpled to flat - isotropic phase . upon further cooling ,",
    "an in - plane ( flat ) isotropic to ( flat ) nematic transition can take place . as shown by toner and one of us@xcite , polymerized membranes with arbitrary small amount of in - plane anisotropy inevitably exhibit the so - called tubule phase whose properties and location in the phase diagram are intermediate between the high - temperature crumpled and low - temperature flat phases .",
    "thus we expect that for nematically - ordered elastomer membranes there is a similar nematically - ordered tubule phase .",
    "since in such a state the in - plane rotation symmetry is _ spontaneously _ ( as opposed to explicitly ) broken , we expect qualitatively distinct in - plane elasticity distinguished by the presence of a new in - plane soft phonon mode .",
    "consequently a nematic tubule should be qualitatively distinct phase of elastic membranes .",
    "this discussion is summarized by a schematic phase diagram for a nematic elastomer membranes , illustrated in fig.[tubule ]",
    ". a detailed analysis of the nematic tubule phase and phase transitions between it and other phases will appear in a separate publication@xcite .",
