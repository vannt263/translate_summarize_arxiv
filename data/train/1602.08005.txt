    "the former process is described by the fraction of energy , @xmath4 in fig .",

    "traditionally , only a ) has been considered when developing an ionization efficiency model  @xcite to compare with neutron calibration data in which the ionization efficiency is relative to the calibration from gamma - ray sources .",
    "this type of calibration is a relative energy calibration since the energy scale is determined using well - known gamma - ray energies on the assumption that the entire energy is detectable .    however , due to the additional energy loss process b ) mentioned above , the real detectable ionization energy ( @xmath3 ) is only a small fraction , @xmath6 ( @xmath7 is the band gap energy and @xmath0 is the average energy required to produce an e - h pair ) , of the energy measured ( @xmath8 ) using the relative energy calibration for a given recoil event  @xcite .",

    "[ eq19 ] , we can see that @xmath21 and @xmath22 can be measured through electronic recoils .",
    "since for a given known gamma ray , @xmath112 is the known recoil energy .",
    "@xmath113 can then be obtained through the database  @xcite with known @xmath112 .",

    "gamma tech with model rg11b / c  @xcite was used in our experiment .",
    "a national instruments pxi-1031 system  @xcite and igor pro 4.07 software  @xcite were used for our data acquisition . with this experimental setup , @xmath115 for each gamma ray",

    "the average path length , @xmath117 , for a given gamma ray energy , is determined through @xmath117=@xmath122 , where @xmath123 is the @xmath124th pulse in an event .",
    "since @xmath114 is known , @xmath21 and @xmath22 can be determined by fitting those five data points in the plot of @xmath114 as a function of @xmath113 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ab ] .",
    "the best - fit function with reduced @xmath77 = 21.5 for the data points in fig .  [ fig : ab ] is : @xmath125 by comparing eq .",

    "note that @xmath21 has temperature dependence since @xmath21 = @xmath6 from eq .",
    "[ eq17 ] and both @xmath7 and and @xmath0 have temperature dependence as discussed in section  [ s : aver ] .",
    "however , @xmath22 has no temperature dependence because @xmath22 is only related to the stopping power @xmath129 , which has nothing to do with temperature .      the comparison between our absolute energy calibration model and all other existing data and models with a relative energy calibration at @xmath49 = 77 kelvin is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : com1 ] . fig .",
    "[ fig : com1 ] indicates that , for the same recoil energy , the eventual detectable ionization energy using absolute calibration is smaller than that of using a relative calibration .",
    "this means that the absolute ionization efficiency is smaller than the relative ionization efficiency for a given recoil energy .",
    "note that the uncertainty of @xmath22 was taken into account in our absolute calibration model in fig .",
    "[ fig : com1 ] .",
    "in addition to the difference in ionization efficiency , another important difference is that the absolute energy calibration possesses the prediction power for the entire energy region beyond the data points covered the region from energy source calibration , while the relative energy calibration is only valid for the region that is fully calibrated using energy sources .",
    "any extrapolation beyond the region of the calibration will result in uncertainty in the energy scale due to the lack of considering all energy deposition processes in any data - driven model .",
    "this difference is because the absolute energy calibration has considered all possible energy deposition processes for a given electronic or nuclear recoil event in the detector .",
    "therefore , the absolute energy calibration is more accurate and reliable than the relative energy calibration .",
    "one can apply the absolute calibration model to all existing experimental data and theoretical models to see if there is an agreement between them for recoil energy from 1 to 100 kev . since all existing data and models adopt the relative calibration , we multiplied their measured visible energy by an additional factor , @xmath130 ( @xmath0 = 3.0 ev for 77 kelvin and @xmath0 = 3.32 ev for 50 milli - kelvin ) , which takes into account the missing energy through the emission of phonons , to apply the absolute calibration model and get the real detectable ionization energy .",
    "as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : com2 ] , our model agrees well with other data and models at @xmath49 = 50 milli - kelvin for supercdms  @xcite , shutt  @xcite and simon  @xcite , and @xmath49 = 77 kelvin for the rest .",
    "this verifies that birks law can be applied to ge detectors .",
    "traditionally , the product of @xmath131 is measured using the energy resolution function for a given detector . to determine the value of fano factor or the value of @xmath0",
    ", one has to assume either fano factor or @xmath0 is a constant . in this paper , we develop a method that allows the average energy expended per e - h pair , @xmath0 , and the fano factor to be measured separately . using the measured energy resolution functions reported by supercdms experiment , the values of @xmath0 and fano factor are determined for a detector operated at 50 milli - kelvin .",
    "we demonstrate that our method depends strongly on the energy resolution function in which the statistical term is well defined . using the existing data",
    ", we illustrate the best fit function that predicts the range of @xmath0 , which is within the range from the supercdms measurements at 50 milli - kelvin . according to the best fit of data and the best agreement with the model prediction ,",
    "the value of @xmath0 is 3.32 ev",
    ". the energy threshold of a bolometer - type detector will be about 7.5% different if the value of @xmath0 varies from 3.0 ev to 3.32 ev .",
    "we demonstrate an absolute energy calibration model for the ge detector response to low energy recoils .",
    "two energy loss processes have been considered in the absolute calibration method compared to the traditional relative calibration , which only takes into account one energy loss process .",
    "two energy loss processes a ) and b ) described above resulted in less ionization efficiency in the case of absolute calibration . once all existing data were correctly scaled in the absolute energy response function , a good agreement between the theoretical prediction using the absolute energy response function and the data points was achieved .",
    "the difference between the absolute energy response function and the relative calibration energy scale in the visible energy is about a factor of @xmath14 , which will not result in a difference in the threshold of recoil energy within the calibration range because there are correspondences between the measured visible energy points and the incident recoil energy points .",
    "however , beyond the calibration range , the extrapolation of the energy scale using a relative calibration will posses large uncertainty up to a factor of 4 according to the absolute energy response function .",
    "the authors would like to thank christina keller for her careful reading of this manuscript .",
    "we are also immensely grateful to lauren hsu and her collaborators in supercdms for their comments on an earlier version of the manuscript and provide several references .",
