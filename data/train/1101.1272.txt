    "rare b decays induced by the flavor - changing neutral current  ( fcnc ) occur at loop level in the standard model  ( sm ) and thus proceed at a low rate .",
    "they can provide useful information on the parameters of the sm and test its predictions .",
    "meanwhile , they offer a valuable possibility of an indirect search of new physics  ( np ) for their sensitivity to the gauge structure and new contributions .",
    "experimentally , the fruitful running of babar , belle and tevatron in the past decade provides a very fertile ground for testing sm and probing possible np effects .",
    "as particle physics is entering the era of lhc , @xmath10 physics has attracted much more attention .",
    "recently , cdf collaboration has reported the first observation of the rare semileptonic @xmath2 decay and measured its branching fraction to be  @xcite @xmath11\\times10^{-6}\\,\\quad { \\rm cdf\\,.}\\ ] ] theoretically , many evaluations for @xmath2 decay have been done within both sm and various np scenarios ( for example , refs .",
    "the sm prediction for @xmath12  ( @xmath13(qcdsr )  @xcite , for example ) agrees well with cdf measurement@xmath14 for large experimental error .",
    "if more exact measurement on @xmath2 is gotten by the running lhc - b and future super - b , the possible np space will be strongly constrained or excluded .",
    "so , it is worth evaluating the effects of the possible np , such as a family non - universal @xmath1 boson , on @xmath2 decay .    a new family non - universal @xmath15 boson could be naturally derived in certain string constructions  @xcite , @xmath16 models  @xcite and so on .",
    "searching for such an extra @xmath1 boson is an important mission in the experimental programs of tevatron  @xcite and lhc  @xcite .",
    "the general framework for non - universal @xmath1 model has been developed in ref .",
    "@xcite . within such model ,",
    "fcnc in @xmath17 and @xmath18 transitions could be induced by family non - universal @xmath19 gauge symmetries at tree level .",
    "its effects on @xmath17 transition have attracted much more attention and been widely studied .",
    "interestingly , the behavior of a family non - universal @xmath15 boson is helpful to resolve many puzzles in @xmath20 decays , such as `` @xmath21 puzzle ''  @xcite , anomalous @xmath3 mixing phase  @xcite and mismatch in @xmath22 spectrum at low @xmath23 region  @xcite .    within a family non - universal @xmath15 model ,",
    "@xmath2 decay involves @xmath24 and @xmath25 couplings , which have been strictly bounded by the constraints from @xmath3 mixing , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 decays and so on  @xcite .",
    "so , it is worth evaluating the effects of a non - universal @xmath15 boson on @xmath30 decay and checking whether such settled values of @xmath15 couplings are permitted by cdf measurement on @xmath31 .",
    "our paper is organized as follows . in section  2 ,",
    "we briefly review the theoretical framework for @xmath32 decay within both sm and a family non - universal @xmath1 model . in section  3 , the effects of a non - universal @xmath1 boson on @xmath2 decay are investigated in detail .",
    "our conclusions are summarized in section  4 .",
    "appendix  a and b include all of the theoretical input parameters .",
    "in the sm , neglecting the doubly cabibbo - suppressed contributions , the effective hamiltonian governing semileptonic @xmath33 transition is given by  @xcite @xmath34 here we choose the operator basis given by ref .",
    "@xcite , in which @xmath35 wilson coefficients @xmath36 can be calculated perturbatively  @xcite , with the numerical results listed in table  [ wc ] .",
    "the effective coefficients @xmath37 , which are particular combinations of @xmath38 with the other @xmath36 , are defined as  @xcite @xmath39 in which @xmath40 denotes the matrix element of four - quark operators and given by @xmath41 we have neglected the long - distance contribution mainly due to @xmath42 and @xmath43 in the decay chain @xmath44 , which could be vetoed experimentally  @xcite . for the recent detailed discussion of such resonance effects , we refer to ref .  @xcite .",
    "these transition form factors have been updated recently within the light - cone qcd sum rule approach  @xcite . for the @xmath23 dependence of the form factors , they can be parameterized in terms of simple formulae with two or three parameters .",
    "the form factors @xmath46 , @xmath47 and @xmath48 are parameterized by @xmath49 for the form factors @xmath50 and @xmath51 , it is more appropriate to expand to the second order around the pole , yielding @xmath52 where @xmath53 for @xmath50 and @xmath51 .",
