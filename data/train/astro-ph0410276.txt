    "in astrophysical objects , large scale magnetic fields are thought to be generated by helical turbulence ( the so - called @xmath0-effect ) and differential rotation ( the @xmath1-effect ) ( see @xcite ) .",
    "however , note that a large scale magnetic field can in some cases be generated without fully helical turbulence or a net @xmath0-effect . within the mean field approximation , there are physical effects which contribute to the mean electromotive force even when the @xmath0 coefficient is zero . a shear turbulent flow",
    "@xcite , the @xmath2 term @xcite , or magnetic instabilities in a stably stratified atmosphere @xcite , are some of the examples reported in the literature .",
    "helicity is naturally imparted to a rotating fluid by the coriolis force @xcite .",
    "however , at sufficiently small scales , where the rossby number @xmath3 is larger than unity ( @xmath4 and @xmath5 are characteristic velocities and lengths , and @xmath6 is the rotation rate ) , the coriolis force and the resulting induced helicity might become negligibly small .",
    "nonetheless , it is worth noting that in helical turbulent flows , the kinetic helicity develops a direct cascade along with the energy @xcite .",
    "therefore , some small scale turbulent flows can still be helical , even though the source of helicity remains at much larger spatial scales .",
    "the hall effect introduces a definite handedness or helicity on small scale fluid motions ( @xcite , @xcite ) , since the mirror symmetry in the induction equation is broken ( see eqn  ( [ induc ] ) below ) .",
    "therefore , one should expect a net @xmath0-effect in a hall plasma .",
    "the hall effect becomes relevant whenever the hall length scale @xmath7 is larger than the dissipation scale , a category to which several objects of astrophysical interest belong @xcite . here , @xmath8 is the characteristic alfvnic speed , @xmath9 is the speed of light , and @xmath10 is the ion plasma frequency .    in  2 we write down the hall mhd equations .",

    "4 we briefly summarize the role of normal mode fluctuations on mhd dynamos , and in  5 this concept is extended to hall mhd . in  6 we show the effect of rotation on the @xmath0-effect .",
    "the main results of the present work are summarized in  7 .",

    "note that equation ( [ lhall ] ) is valid for a fully ionized plasma .",
    "we will study waves in the ideal and incompressible hall - mhd system in a rotating frame . to linearize the hall - mhd equations around a static and uniform magnetic field @xmath20 , we write @xmath21 where @xmath22 .",

    "without loss of generality we choose @xmath29 in the @xmath30-direction , i.e. @xmath31 , while @xmath32 and @xmath33 can be oriented arbitrarily .",
    "equations ( [ lininduc ] ) and ( [ linns ] ) , then , reduce to @xmath34 @xmath35 here , @xmath36 and @xmath37    note that only the @xmath30-components of @xmath38 and @xmath20 are relevant ( i.e. the components in the direction of the vector @xmath29 ) .",
    "the orthonormal base for the antisymmetric operator @xmath39 is given by @xmath40 and satisfies @xmath41",
    ".    the dispersion relation can be obtained from equations ( [ lininduc2 ] ) and ( [ linns2 ] ) ,    @xmath42    where @xmath43 and the eigenvectors can be written as @xmath44 .",
    "this dispersion relationship is quite general and includes several well known waves of a magnetized plasma in the corresponding asymptotic limits .",
    "when both @xmath45 ( no rotation ) and @xmath46 ( negligible hall current , i.e. the mhd limit ) we obtain  @xmath47 which corresponds to alfvn waves . in the incompressible limit , the shear and the compressional waves are degenerate and indistinguishable .",
    "when @xmath46 , equation ( [ disprel ] ) reduces to @xmath48 , and we obtain the inertial waves first described in the absence of an external magnetic field @xmath49 by @xcite . finally , when @xmath45 we obtain two branches of circularly polarized waves",
    "the right hand polarized branch , corresponds to whistlers , with a frequency growing like @xmath50 at large wavenumbers .",
    "these waves are the high k limit of the compressional branch .",
    "the left handed branch is the standard shear wave whose frequency approaches the ion - cyclotron frequency asymptotically .",
    "figure  [ dispfig ] shows these asymptotic cases in detail .",
    "the general dispersion relationship given in equation ( [ disprel ] ) , can be cast in dimensionless units using @xmath51 and @xmath52 as typical longitude and velocity , @xmath53 where @xmath54 can be interpreted as the inverse of the rossby number given in eq .",
    "( [ rossby ] ) .",
    "the mhd limit in figure [ dispfig ] corresponds to a small neighborhood around the origin , where there is only a transition between inertial waves and alfvn waves .",
    "figure [ v_phase ] shows the phase speed as a function of wavenumber for the two positive branches given by equation ( [ displess ] ) .",
    "there are also two other identical branches with negative frequencies ( not shown ) .",
    "these waves behave approximately as alfvn waves only in the wavenumber regions where they are non - dispersive , i.e. when the curves become horizontal .",
    "before embarking on the hall - mhd case , it is instructive to recall some previous results relating to the dynamo process induced by mhd waves ( readily obtained from our expressions ) . in the limit @xmath55 and @xmath56 ,",
    "alfvn waves are known to quench the @xmath57-effect @xcite .",
    "the mhd @xmath0-coefficient @xcite is given by @xmath58 where @xmath59 and @xmath60 are respectively small scale velocity and magnetic fields , unaffected by the presence of a large scale magnetic field ( see details in @xcite ) , and the coefficient @xmath61 is a typical correlation time for the turbulent small scale motions . a pure alfvenic state satisfies @xmath62 and therefore @xmath63 .",
    "this is to be expected , since all nonlinear terms cancel exactly for alvenic states , and therefore no transportation coefficients can arise in that case . on the other hand , when @xmath64 the coriolis force is expected to inject helicity to the fluid , and",
    "therefore a net @xmath57-effect arises @xcite .",
    "a detailed discussion can also be found in @xcite",
    "the first studies on the impact of hall currents on dynamo action @xcite were carried out using mean field theory and the first - order smoothing approximation @xcite .",
    "helmis obtained decreasing dynamo action as the strength of the hall terms increased .",
    "recently , the relevance of the hall effect on dynamo activity was confirmed experimentally by @xcite .    in @xcite",
    "it was shown that the expression for the @xmath57-effect in the presence of the hall effect is modified according to @xmath65 where @xmath66 is the small scale electron flow velocity .",
    "this general expression differs from the mhd result ( equation ( [ alphamhd ] ) ) in two ways : it replaces the kinetic helicity by the helicity of the electron flow , and it contains an extra term due to the hall current in the microscale .",
    "a nontrivial consequence of the latter is that , while the original @xmath57 coefficient of @xcite is zero for a pure alfvnic state @xmath67 @xcite , the one corresponding to equation ( [ alpha ] ) is not . in @xcite",
    "the impact of the hall effect in helical turbulent dynamos was studied in direct numerical simulations .",
    "as mentioned in the previous section , the required helicity is naturally introduced in a fluid in a rotating body by the coriolis force .",
    "two questions arise .",
    "the first one is better posed and answered for a non - rotating plasma .",
    "we just showed that the @xmath0 derived in mhd goes to zero for the pure alfvnic state , which is an eigen - state of mhd .",
    "we also claimed that for the same pure eigen - state of mhd , the @xmath0 derived in hall mhd does not vanish .",
    "surely that is an unwarranted mixing of different worlds . what we should , instead , calculate is the value of @xmath0 derived in hall mhd for the corresponding normal modes of hall mhd .",
    "this task is performed at the end of this section .    the second question concerns rotation and the coriolis force which is known to inject helicity at large scales ( see equation [ [ rossby ] ] and figure [ dispfig ] ) .",
    "at small scales ( large @xmath68 ) , however , the coriolis force is not considered to be relevant ( motions are expected to be essentially non - helical ) posing a serious restriction on the generation of magnetic fields in astrophysics .",
    "can we find a source of helicity acting at small scales , and will this source have much to do with rotation ?    we show that the hall effect naturally introduces helicity at small scales , which is precisely the region where this effect is stronger ( in agreement with @xcite and also @xcite ) .",
    "however , no net @xmath0-effect is generated by these microscale motions , unless there is also a net rotation of the system ; a combination of rotation and hall effect is needed for dynamo action .    as is shown in equation ( [ ket ] ) , the general solutions of the linearized hall - mhd equations in a rotating frame are right - handed or left - handed polarized waves . to investigate the effect of hall currents at small scales , we first concentrate on a non - rotating plasma , @xmath45 . for large k",
    ", the dispersion relationship ( [ disprel ] ) reduces to @xmath69 which coupled to eq.([lininduc ] ) , yields @xmath70 inserting eq .",
    "( [ ueandb ] ) into equation ( [ alpha ] ) , and invoking that the electron vorticity is @xmath71 , we obtain @xmath72 which , according to the dispersion relation eq .",
    "( [ dispnorot ] ) , corresponds to @xmath73 .",
    "this result of a zero @xmath0-effect for hall mhd normal modes is an expected and natural extension of the similar result obtained for alfvenic states in mhd .",
    "however , we must bear in mind that these results are derived for non - rotating systems .",
    "in rotating objects , the closure calculation leading to either equation ( [ alpha ] ) ( in the mhd limit ) or equation ( [ alphamhd ] ) needs to be revised , since the coriolis force ( see equation ( [ ns ] ) ) was not included in those calculations .",
    "the starting point is the so - called  _ reduced smoothing approximation _ \" ( rsa ) proposed by @xcite ( see also @xcite for a derivation which includes the hall effect ) . following rsa , we decompose the magnetic and velocity fields as    @xmath74    @xmath75    where the overbar denotes spatially or statistically averaged large - scale perturbations .",
    "the small scale fields @xmath76 , @xmath77 are solutions of eqs .",
    "( [ induc])-([ns ] ) in the absence of large scale fields , and @xmath78 , @xmath79 are anisotropic corrections to the small scale fields , caused by the presence of @xmath80 , @xmath81 .",
    "the net effect of small scale fluctuations on the large scale dynamics , is given by an electromotive force @xmath82 acting on equation ( [ ns ] ) , where @xmath83 and @xmath84 .    from equations ( [ induc])-([ns ] ) for the evolution of small scale fields ( assuming that @xmath85 in an appropriate frame of reference , and under the reduced smoothing approximation @xcite ) ,",
    "we obtain @xmath86 @xmath87{\\mbox{\\boldmath $ u $ } } \\simeq \\left ( { \\overline{{\\mbox{\\boldmath $ b $ } } } } \\cdot \\nabla \\right )    { { \\mbox{\\boldmath $ b $ } } ^0}\\ ; . \\label{umicro}\\ ] ]    the time derivative indicated in equations ( [ bmicro])-([umicro ] ) is usually approximated by @xmath88 , where @xmath61 is a correlation time for the microscale motions .",
    "the operator on the left - hand side of equation ( [ umicro ] ) becomes , @xmath89 whose inverse is @xmath90    replacing equations ( [ bmicro])-([umicro ] ) on equation ( [ emf ] ) and using equation ( [ tau ] ) , we obtain @xmath91    the expression for the electromotive force given in equation ( [ emf2 ] ) corresponds to an anisotropic tensor @xmath92 \\frac{k_i k_j}{k^2 } \\label{alphatensor}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which for small scale fluctuations given by a pure mode of wavenumber @xmath29 , produce an electromotive force @xmath93 parallel to @xmath29 , regardless of the orientation of @xmath80 and @xmath38 .",
    "it seems reasonable to assume that the correlation time @xmath61 is much smaller than the rotation period .",
    "therefore , in the asymptotic limit @xmath94 , @xmath95 \\frac{k_i k_j}{k^2 } .",
    "\\label{alphatensor2}\\ ] ] note that when a rotation field is present , @xmath96 is in general non - zero .",
    "the rotation field therefore provides a source of energy that is responsible for the net @xmath0-effect .",
    "equation ( [ alphatensor2 ] ) confirms that for non - rotating objects , the net alpha effect generated by a background of small scale normal modes is exactly zero .",
    "notwithstanding , sources of kinetic helicity other than rotation have been considered @xcite , to assess their efficiency in driving large scale dynamos .    for large wavenumbers ,",
    "the dispersion relationship given by equation ( [ disprel ] ) has two limits : one is the so called compressional / whistler branch @xmath97 , while the other is the shear / cyclotron branch with @xmath98 . for the former ,",
    "the @xmath0-effect is asymptotically small .",
    "for the shear / cyclotron branch , however , @xmath99 at large wavenumbers implying strong dynamo action .",
    "therefore , once the rotation breaks the mirror symmetry , the shear / ion - cyclotron modes ( which failed to produce dynamo action without rotation ) are , indeed , able to provide a net @xmath0-effect at microscopic scales .",
    "we believe that this is a very important result for turbulent dynamo theories . in figure 3",
    "we show the trace of the tensor @xmath96 as a function of @xmath68 , for different values of @xmath100 and @xmath101 .",
    "note that in the mhd case @xmath102 drops to zero at small scales ( large @xmath68 ) , while in the hall - mhd case it does not .",
    "we have shown that the hall effect in conjunction with fluid rotation can generate helicity at small scales ( i.e. produce small scale helical motions ) leading to a net @xmath0-effect through the agency of the shear / ion - cyclotron normal mode of the plasma .",
    "this finding can be of considerable importance to the existence of large scale dynamo action in a variety of astrophysical objects .",
    "our results are quite consistent with previous results obtained in the study of instabilities in accretion disks .",
    "@xcite , @xcite , and @xcite showed that the magneto - rotational instability can be either enhanced or quenched by the hall effect depending on the orientation of @xmath32 and @xmath33 , which is just a manifestation of the handedness introduced by the hall effect . in a future work the detailed investigation of this mode of dynamo action will be carried out through direct numerical simulations .",
