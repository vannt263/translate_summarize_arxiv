    "with the advent of radioactive ion beam facilities , new experimental data concerning exotic nuclei are becoming available . some of the exotic nuclei show halo structures which has generated a lot of interest , in recent times , among various theoretical and experimental groups .",
    "experimental investigations have shown the enhancement of sub - barrier fusion cross - section in reactions involving exotic nuclei @xcite , which is thought to be related to the sizes and structure of such nuclei .",
    "thus the understanding of the structure of such nuclei is of utmost importance to the study of various phenomena involving these nuclei .",
    "it is well known that the very low binding energy of the last unpaired nucleon is responsible for the large matter radii of one - nucleon halo nuclei .",
    "a number of one - neutron halo nuclei have been identified and studied in recent times . in a similar way , one - proton halo nuclei ought to exist except for the fact that the proton wave function , unlike the neutron wave function , is squeezed due to the coulomb barrier .",
    "the nucleus @xmath1f may be a good candidate for a proton halo nucleus since the binding energy of the last proton is only 0.60 mev .",
    "experimental studies @xcite have revealed that the spin - parity of the ground state of @xmath1f is @xmath5 and has spectroscopic strength equal to 0.93 .",
    "the first excited state is known to be @xmath6 , with a dominant @xmath7 single particle ( s.p . ) configuration having binding energy equal to 0.1 mev .",
    "however , the root mean square ( rms ) radius of the ground state is 3.78 fm whereas that of the first excited state , at 500 kev excitation , is observed to be 5.33 fm @xcite . considering the ground state and the first excited state to be pure single particle configurations of 1d@xmath8 and 2s@xmath9 , respectively",
    ", the rms radii of the last proton , using harmonic oscillator wave functions , turn out to be the same , which is contrary to the experimental findings .",
    "this indicates that coupling of the odd proton motion and that of the core may modify the wave function of @xmath1f sufficiently to affect the rms radius of the ground state and that of the first excited state .",
    "the neighbouring even - even cores for this nucleus are @xmath10o and @xmath2ne .",
    "the first , @xmath10o , is a doubly closed shell nucleus without any vibrational structure , whereas the second , @xmath2ne , shows a well developed vibrational structure with the first 2@xmath11 state at 1.88 mev @xcite . as such",
    ", the behaviour of the core changes abruptly if one goes from o to ne .",
    "therefore , the nature of the @xmath1f nucleus is in between the two extremes and the structure of this nucleus needs to be explored .",
    "furnstahl and price @xcite , through a relativistic hartree calculation , found the rms charge radius to be 2.76 fm and the magnetic dipole moment to be 4.87 @xmath12 . on the other hand ,",
    "the density functional method of lombard @xcite provided the total binding energy ( b.e .",
    "= 126.6 mev )",
    ". however , the detailed structure information regarding the excitation mechanism is lacking at present .",
    "we have shown earlier @xcite that the structures of the one - neutron halo nuclei @xmath13be and @xmath14o could be explained satisfactorily through the coupling of collective vibrations of the respective even - even cores with the motion of the odd valence neutron . in the present work , we have shown that similar idea can be applied in explaining the important features of the excitation spectrum of the proton rich exotic nucleus @xmath1f by coupling single proton qusiparticle motion to the collective vibrational motion of the even - even @xmath2ne core . in this paper",
    ", we present the results of our calculations for the studies of the low lying excitation spectrum and the electromagnetic ( em ) properties of the @xmath1f nucleus .",

    "similar are the structures of the @xmath104 and @xmath105 states . however , no experimental data are available for the spectroscopic strengths for the odd parity states of @xmath1f to compare with .",
    "the stringent test of the wave functions obtained by diagonalising the hamiltonian is to see whether they are able to reproduce the electromagnetic moments and the multipole electromagnetic transition probabilities .",
    "however , in the case of the exotic nuclei an important aspect of structure study is the reproduction of the experimentally observed rms radius of proton or neutron distribution which provides a measure of the proton or neutron halo .",
    "the rms radii of the ground state and the excited states of @xmath1f contains two parts - ( i ) from the core and ( ii ) from the extra quasiparticle . in order to evaluate the proton rms radii of these two states , initially",
    ", we performed our calculation with the harmonic oscillator ( h.o . ) wave functions to extract the contribution from the quasiparticle part .",
    "the calculated values of the proton rms radius for the @xmath106 ground state and the @xmath107 first excited state were found to be 4.01 fm and 4.15 fm , respectively .",
    "though the experimental trend for the rms radii for these two states is reproduced , the calculated values are not in agreement with the experimentally observed values of 3.78 fm and 5.33 fm , respectively @xcite .",

    "this behaviour of the h.o .",
    "wave functions , through the radial integrals , consequently affects the calculated values of the electric quadrupole moment and the electromagnetic transition rates ( eq.[qm ] ) .    to overcome this difficulty , we have used a generalised average one - body potential of woods - saxon type @xcite to generate the s.p",

    "the parameters of the single particle potential are given in table [ wspot ] .",
    "these w - s wave functions could be used for calculating the rms radius and the electromagnetic properties of the states of @xmath1f but for the wave function of the @xmath93 state , which is unbound .    in order to circumvent this problem to get the wave function of the unbound @xmath93 s.p .",

    "however , for the ground state the calculated value of the rms radius overestimates the corresponding experimental value .    the same quasiparticle wave functions , as used in the calculation of the rms radii , have been used to calculate the electric quadrupole moment of the ground state and the em transition probabilities among the various states of @xmath1f obtained earlier .",
    "effective proton charge , @xmath116 and effective charge of the core , @xmath117 have been used in the present calculation ( @xmath118 being the charge of proton ) .",

    "the calculated values of the electric quadrupole moment and the magnetic dipole moment are 0.108 eb and 4.708 @xmath12 , respectively and they compare very well with the experimental values of 0.10 @xmath1270.02 eb and 4.72130 @xmath127 0.00025 @xmath12 , respectively ( see table [ qmr ] ) . the calculation is able to reproduce well the observed reduced transition probabilities , @xmath4 and @xmath3 ( table [ be ] ) .",
    "however , the calculated @xmath3 value between the @xmath128 and @xmath129 states underestimate the experimental value by an order of magnitude .",
    "the low lying excitation spectrum of the proton drip line nucleus @xmath1f has been studied in the quasiparticle - core coupling model in which the motion of the odd quasiparticle is coupled with the neighbouring even - even vibrating core .",
    "the core excitation energies , which take into account all the correlations arising out of the many particle core system , were taken from the experiment .",
    "the relative single particle energies and the quadrupole interaction strength were treated as parameters .",
    "the calculated energies and the spectroscopic factors for both the even and the odd parity states agree quite well with the corresponding experimental results .",
    "the calculated values of the rms radii of the ground state and the first excited state using single particle h.o .",
    "wave functions follow the experimental trend but are grossly underestimated ( particularly the rms radius of the first excited state ) .",
    "however , the value of the rms radius of the first excited state is well reproduced by using the wsho single particle wave functions .",
    "the calculated values of the electric quadrupole moment of the ground state and the reduced transition probabilities using the wsho wave functions compare quite well with the corresponding experimental values .",
    "the calculated value of the ground state magnetic dipole moment agrees very well with that of the experimental one .    in conclusion",
    ", it may be inferred that within a simple quasiparticle - vibration coupling model , one can very well reproduce the experimental observables associated with the structure of the light proton drip line nucleus @xmath1f without going into sophisticated calculations .",
