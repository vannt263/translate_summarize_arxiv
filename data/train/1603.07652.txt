    "effective interactions between magnetic moments in solid materials as well as in chemical compounds where dipolar interactions can be ignored derive from local exchange interactions between the magnetic moment ( @xmath13 ) and the nearby electronic spin structure ( @xmath14 ) @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the exchange integral between delocalized and localized spin @xmath14 and @xmath13 , respectively . from this basic concept",
    "it can be deduced that the effective spin - spin interaction can be mapped onto the spin interaction hamiltonian @xcite @xmath17      \\biggr )      , \\label{eq - hs}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath18 , @xmath19 , and @xmath20 denote the heisenberg , dzyaloshinski - moriya , and ising interaction parameters , respectively .",
    "the interaction parameter depends on the properties of the electronic structure surrounding the localized spin moments .",
    "considering the interaction between different spins , @xmath21 , it can be shown that the heisenberg interaction , which is of isotropic nature , essentially depends on the charge density available to mediate the coupling between the spins and is generally finite in metallic materials as well as in the types of molecular compounds considered in a spintronics context . in terms of eq .",
    "( [ eq - hs ] ) , the spins tend to align ferromagnetically whenever @xmath22 while an anti - ferromagnetic alignment is favored for @xmath23 .",
    "the ising interaction is anisotropic which is a property that stems from a spin - polarized electronic structure , without which it vanishes .",
    "analogously to the heisenberg interaction , negative ( positive ) ising interaction leads to ferromagnetic ( anti - ferromagnetic ) spins along the spin quantization axis of the electronic structure . finally , the dzyaloshinski - moriya interaction , which is a source for spin non - collinearity , is finite only whenever both time - reversal and inversion symmetries are broken .",
    "materials with finite spin - orbit coupling fulfill this requirement , however , in molecular compounds these two symmetries can be broken by using ferromagnetic electrodes under non - equilibrium conditions @xcite . among the self - interactions , @xmath24 ,",
    "the ising interaction provides an anisotropic dipolar @xcite field to the local spins provided that the surrounding electronic structure is spin - polarized .",
    "the heisenberg interaction adds a constant shift of the total energy , since @xmath25 , while the contribution from the dzyaloshinski - moriya interaction vanishes since @xmath26 .",
    "hence , both these two self - interactions are uninteresting for variations in the spin excitation spectrum .        here , we consider a dimer of equivalent paramagnetic molecules inserted in the junction between metallic leads , see fig .",
    "[ fig - fig1 ] ( a ) .",
    "we model this set - up using the hamiltonian @xmath27 . here , @xmath28 $ ] , where @xmath29 ( @xmath30 ) creates ( annihilates ) an electron in the @xmath31th molecule at the energy @xmath32 and spin @xmath33 , whereas @xmath0 defines the tunneling rate between the molecules . internally in molecule @xmath31 , the localized spin moment @xmath13 interacts with the electron spin @xmath34 via exchange @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is the exchange integral , and we assume that @xmath37 .",
    "we focus on the case with non - magnetic leads , @xmath38 , where @xmath39 creates an electron in the left ( @xmath40 ; @xmath41 ) or right ( @xmath42 ; @xmath43 ) lead at the energy @xmath44 and spin @xmath45 .",
    "tunneling between the leads and molecules is described by @xmath46 .",
    "hence , @xmath47 provides a spin - degenerate electronic structure which mediates the exchange interactions , which implies that both the dzyaloshinski - moriya and ising interactions vanish ( @xmath48 , @xmath49 ) and we retain the isotropic heisenberg interaction only . in this way we treat the spin dimer as an equilibrium system , i.e. , conserved number of particles for which the occupations of the states is given by the gibbs distribution , which is influenced by the tunneling current that flows through the molecular complex",
    ". this set - up pertains to , e.g. , mpc and mp where m denotes a magnetic transition metal atom , e.g. , cr , mn , fe , co , ni , cu , and can be realized in , for example , mechanically controlled break - junctions @xcite and scanning tunneling microscope @xcite .",
    "having such systems in mind , also justifies that we neglect spin - orbit coupling in the molecular orbitals , since such coupling essentially pertains to the @xmath50-electrons constituting the paramagnetic moment , and also that we consider the molecular levels in a single particle form , relevant for @xmath51- and @xmath52-electrons . in such set - ups ,",
    "the effective magnetic interaction parameter @xmath53 between the two spins can be calculated using the expression , see the supporting information , @xmath54 where @xmath55 , with @xmath56 , is the coupling to the leads , and @xmath57 is the fermi function at the chemical potential @xmath5 of the left / right lead such that the voltage bias applied across the junction can be defined as @xmath58 .",
    "the voltage bias dependence of @xmath53 is plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig - fig1 ] ( b ) for the case with @xmath9 ( for other parameters , see the figure caption ) .",
    "near equilibrium ( @xmath59 ) , @xmath60 , this integral gives a negative ( ferromagnetic ) value for @xmath53 whenever @xmath61 lies between the upper and lower effective orbital energies @xmath6 of the molecular dimer , indicated by the red arrow in fig .",
    "[ fig - fig1 ] ( b ) . in this regime",
    "the ground state of the spin dimer is a spin triplet , labelled by @xmath62 where @xmath63 denotes the triplet and @xmath31 its projection .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig - fig1 ] ( c ) , which shows the occupation number for the four possible states in the spin dimer corresponding to the evolution of @xmath53 in panel ( b ) .",
    "the red arrow indicates that the three projections of the spin triplet are equally occupied ( @xmath64 ) . with increasing voltage bias ,",
    "@xmath65 and @xmath66 approach the orbital energies @xmath6 , which leads to a peaked positive ( anti - ferromagnetic ) @xmath53 as @xmath5 sweeps through the orbital energies ( indicated by the black arrow in fig .",
    "[ fig - fig1 ] ( b ) ) .",
    "hence , the spin dimer acquires a spin singlet ground state , @xmath67 , with nearly unit occupation as is indicated by the black arrow in fig .",
    "[ fig - fig1 ] ( c ) . by further increasing the voltage bias , eventually both energies @xmath6 lie between @xmath65 and @xmath66 and @xmath53 remains positive but approaching zero , which leads to that the ground state of the spin dimer becomes a superposition of the spin triplet and spin singlet states . in this regime ,",
    "where @xmath68 , the four states are equally occupied ( @xmath69 ) which can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig - fig1 ] ( c )",
    ". it should be emphasized , however , that the total magnetic moment of the spin dimer vanishes for all voltages due to the absence of magnetic anisotropies .",
    "an advantage with the present set - up , where we use non - spin polarized leads , compared to designs based on ferromagnetic leads is that the dipolar and quadrupolar fields considered in ref . here becomes vanishingly small .",
    "therefore the effective electron mediated spin - spin interactions dominates the properties and control of the molecular dimer .",
    "by tuning between the regimes with ferromagnetic and anti - ferromagnetic @xmath53 , the state of the spin dimer is dynamically switched between spin triplet and singlet configurations . due to the local interaction between the spin moment and the electrons ,",
    "this switching directly affects the conductance through the molecular dimer .",
    "in fact , the state of the spin dimer influences the conducting orbitals and splits the molecular energy levels @xmath6 into @xmath70 , where @xmath71 is the mean field splitting induced by the local spin moments , and @xmath72 is the molecule , or site , projected expectation value of the spin within the eigenbasis of the spin dimer . in the present case these expectation values take the values @xmath73 and @xmath74 in the anti - ferromagnetic and ferromagnetic regimes , respectively , where @xmath75 denotes the spin moment .",
    "this anti - parallel alignment of the spins agrees with the very definition of the spin singlet state , as well as for the paramagnetic configuration @xmath76 among the triplet states .",
    "the contributions to the expectation values from the ferromagnetic triplet states @xmath77 cancel each other , however .",
    "therefore , the ratio between the expectation values @xmath78 for the ferromagnetic and anti - ferromagnetic regimes is 1/3 , which corresponds to the different distributions of the occupation numbers among the triplet and singlet states within the respective regime .",
    "hence , the splitting of the molecular energy levels in the ferromagnetic regime is smaller than in the anti - ferromagnetic regime .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig - fig2 ] ( c ) , where we plot the total density of electron states ( dos ) in the two molecules . in comparison ,",
    "conventional spintronics crucially depend on magnetic fields . in order to obtain the splitting between the conducting states @xmath79 and @xmath80 , which here is induced by @xmath81 with @xmath82 ",
    "@xmath83 mev,@xcite one would have to apply a field strength of the order of @xmath84  @xmath85 t. the main importance of the induced orbital splitting , however , is the distribution of the spectral weight of the molecular orbitals onto the individual molecules .",
    "this can be seen by analyzing the @xmath86 matrix green function ( gf ) for , e.g. , molecule 1 , @xmath87 , which can be written @xmath88 where @xmath89 is a pauli matrix whereas @xmath90 is the identity . in the limit of small @xmath0 , the spectral weights of the component @xmath91 around the energies @xmath79 and @xmath80 are @xmath92 and @xmath93 . here , the former spectral weight is finite in both the anti - ferromagnetic and ferromagnetic regimes while the latter is finite only in the ferromagnetic regime and negligible in the anti - ferromagnetic .",
    "the distribution of the spectral weights for the component @xmath94 is the opposite .",
    "schematically , this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig - fig2 ] ( a),(b ) , while in fig .",
    "[ fig - fig2 ] ( d ) we plot the computed molecule and spin - projected dos @xmath95 for positive ( negative ) voltage biases . repeating the analysis for molecule 2 , which gf is obtained from eq .",
    "( [ eq - gf1 ] ) by the replacements @xmath96 , @xmath97 and @xmath98 , shows that the distribution of the spectral weights is opposite to that of molecule 1 , see fig .",
    "[ fig - fig2 ] ( e ) , which shows the corresponding dos for molecule 2 .",
    "in particular this means that @xmath99 and @xmath100 have a negligible ( finite ) overlap , or in other words , the spin - projections of the electronic density are localized ( delocalized ) , in the anti - ferromagnetic ( ferromagnetic ) regime , which has a large influence on the transport properties as we shall see next .    in the ferromagnetic regime , where the spin - projected dos is delocalized in the molecular dimer , there are channels open for conduction which leads to a finite current flow .",
    "this is indicated by the red arrows in fig .",
    "[ fig - fig2 ] ( f ) , where we plot the current @xmath101 for different gating conditions ( @xmath102 mv ) , see the supporting information for details concerning the current .",
    "the corresponding exchange interactions @xmath53 are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig - fig2 ] ( g ) . in the anti - ferromagnetic regime , on the other hand",
    ", the spin - projected dos is localized and since we assume spin conservative tunneling between the molecules this leads to that an electron with spin @xmath45 residing in molecule 1 has only a small probability to tunnel into molecule 2 .",
    "hence , the resulting current becomes severely suppressed , see fig .",
    "[ fig - fig2 ] ( f ) ( black arrows ) .",
    "the qualitative behavior of the current is the same in all four current traces , showing a high conductance in the ferromagnetic regime ( red arrows ) and a low conductance in the anti - ferromagnetic regime ( black arrows ) and we refer to the latter regime as a spin - singlet blockade .",
    "we stress the fact that since the dimer is constructed from paramagnetic molecules , this characteristics is independent of the spin quantization axis .",
    "the sharp current peaks separating the ferromagnetic and anti - ferromagnetic regimes result from a complete de - localization of the dos when the exchange interaction parameter crosses between negative and positive values , which leads to a four fold degeneracy of the spin states .    with increasing voltage bias",
    ", the system evolves through regimes with different transport characteristics .",
    "first in the non - gated case ( @xmath103 ) , for small voltage biases the high conductance ferromagnetic regime ( fig .",
    "[ fig - fig2 ] ( g ) ) is , when increasing the voltage bias , subsequently followed by a low conductance state in the anti - ferromagnetic regime .",
    "as we saw above , the effective exchange interaction tends to become small by further increasing the voltage bias ( fig .",
    "[ fig - fig2 ] ( g ) ) such that the spin dimer evolves into a new regime with four - fold degenerate spin states . in this phase ,",
    "the molecular orbitals are completely delocalized ( fig .",
    "[ fig - fig2 ] ( c ) , ( d ) ) which permits an open flow of electrons through the molecular complex , yielding a significantly increased current , as can be seen in the current in the high bias regime ( fig .",
    "[ fig - fig2 ] ( f ) ) .",
    "application of a gate voltage that shifts the energy levels with respect to @xmath61 leads to that the ferro- and anti - ferromagnetic regimes move to higher voltage biases ( fig .",
    "[ fig - fig2 ] ( f ) , ( g ) ) , since the molecular orbital energies may not lie on either side of @xmath61 in equilibrium but require a finite voltage bias to fulfill this condition .",
    "therefore , for sufficiently large gating conditions , e.g. , @xmath104 , which is fulfilled for @xmath105 mev , the system is anti - ferromagnetic in the low bias regime and only enter into the ferromagnetic regime for finite voltage biases ( fig .",
    "[ fig - fig2 ] ( f ) , ( g ) ) , which is followed by an another anti - ferromagnetic regime for a further increase of the voltage bias .",
    "this illustrates a generic property of the system , namely , that the ferromagnetic regime is surrounded by anti - ferromagnetic regimes which allows for switching between high and low conductance properties by shifting to either smaller or larger voltage biases  a dual switching functionality . for even larger gating conditions , @xmath106 mev ( fig .",
    "[ fig - fig2 ] ( f ) , ( g ) ) , the system is initially in the highly conducting four - fold degenerate regime at low voltage biases and only thereafter evolves through the anti - ferromagnetic , ferromagnetic , and anti - ferromagnetic regimes , respectively , with increasing voltage bias .",
    "this behavior illustrates the systematic shift of the ferromagnetic and anti - ferromagnetic regimes away from equilibrium to higher voltage biases with gating .    .",
    "( b ) , spatial distribution of the dos for one spin - projection , illustrating the spatial asymmetry between the two molecules .",
    "( c ) , effective exchange interaction as function of the voltage bias for different asymmetric configurations of the molecular levels , @xmath107 , @xmath2 , and @xmath108 mev , for @xmath105 mev .",
    "( d ) , corresponding charge currents . plots",
    "( c ) , ( d ) are off - set for clarity .",
    "parameters are as in fig .",
    "[ fig - fig2 ] . ]",
    "in the anti - ferromagnetic regime , the spin - projected dos are strongly localized to either molecule ( fig .",
    "[ fig - fig3 ] ( b )  upper panel ) , as discussed above .",
    "the degree of localization can be further enhanced by replacing the molecular dimer with non - equivalent molecules in which the local electronic structure in each molecule is slightly different to one another ( fig . [ fig - fig3 ] ( a ) ) .",
    "the imposed asymmetry can be used to amplify the singlet blockade and in this way to achieve current rectification . by introducing a finite level off - set between the orbital energies in the two molecules ,",
    "the asymmetry of the spin - projected dos can be fine tuned into almost complete localization ( fig .",
    "[ fig - fig3 ] ( b )  lower panel ) .",
    "the strongly asymmetric orbital configuration allows for fine tuning the effective exchange such that it becomes ferromagnetic for , e.g. , negative voltage biases and anti - ferromagnetic for positive .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig - fig3 ] ( c ) , which shows the effective exchange as function of the voltage bias for increasing level off - set @xmath109 between the molecular orbital energies . by this separation of the ferromagnetic and anti - ferromagnetic regimes to negative and positive voltage biases ,",
    "respectively , the system becomes an effective rectification device , which can be seen in the plots of the corresponding total currents @xmath101 shown in fig .",
    "[ fig - fig3 ] ( d ) , also see the supporting information .",
    "here , for small level off - sets @xmath110 mev , the spin dimer has ferromagnetic regimes on both sides of zero voltage bias ( fig .",
    "[ fig - fig3 ] ( c ) ) , such that the molecular system has a highly conducting range for negative and positive voltages .",
    "moderately increasing the level off - set , @xmath111 mev completely removes the ferromagnetic regime for positive voltages which leads to an effective suppression of the current , hence , the system is strongly rectifying . we notice that rectification was recently robustly realized in molecular dimers @xcite , however , arising from a completely different physical origin .",
    "in conclusion we predict that electrical control of the effective exchange interaction in molecular spin dimer complexes can be utilized to provide switching function of the system by tuning the system between ferromagnetic and anti - ferromagnetic regimes , a tuning that can be provided by the voltage bias and gate voltage . in effect , the triplet and singlet spin states in the molecular dimer leads to a either delocalized or localized spin - projected dos such that the ferromagnetic regime becomes highly conducting whereas the conductance is suppressed in the anti - ferromagnetic .",
    "this property opens up possibilities for electrical switching between different states associated with dramatic changes in the differential conductance . for molecular complexes with individual gating or non - equivalent paramagnetic molecules ,",
    "it is predicted that the properties can be fine tuned for specific functional characteristics .",
    "finite level off - set between the molecular orbitals can , for instance , be used to create effective current rectification where the high and low conductance phases are controlled by spin triplet and spin singlet states of the molecular spin dimer .",

    "hence , its influence on the electronic structure is essentially unaltered , i.e. , the strong localization of the spectral weight is preserved . in the ferromagnetic regime ,",
    "on the other hand , the zeeman splitting of the spin triplet actually has a tendency to increase the delocalization of the spectral weight of the molecular electronic structure , something which then leads to an increased differential conductance .",
    "it should be noticed , however , that a more thorough investigation of the expected effects under external magnetic fields have to include the dipolar and quadrupolar fields discussed in ref . @xcite .",
