    "type ia supernovae ( sne ia ) have been extensively studied because they provide accurate relative distances on cosmological scales .",
    "measurements of sne ia have indicated that the expansion of the universe is currently accelerating , leading to the introduction of a  dark energy \" component in our model of the universe .",
    "sne ia are thought to arise from carbon - oxygen white dwarfs that accrete mass from a companion star and approach the chandrasekhar mass limit , resulting in a thermonuclear explosion @xcite .",
    "however , there is still significant debate on the details ; e.g. the explosion mechanism , the accretion process , and the progenitor companion star , which may be a giant star , a main sequence star , or a secondary white dwarf @xcite . a measurement of the delay time ( _ i.e. _ , the time between the formation of the binary system and its thermonuclear explosion ) , constrains the possible progenitor systems .",
    "the delay time distribution can be determined observationally by comparing the observed sne ia rates in galaxies with different star - formation histories @xcite .",
    "it has been observationally determined that sne ia are distinctly more common in galaxy hosts with recent star - formation activity @xcite .",
    "recent work has determined that the sne ia rate per unit stellar mass depends on host galaxy morphology and ( b - k ) color and that the sn ia rate in late - type galaxies is a factor @xmath11 higher than in e / s0 galaxies .",
    "sne ia are seen locally to be rarer in galaxy bulges than spiral arms @xcite and more common in blue galaxies than red .",
    "the population associated with star - formation suggests that the sn ia rate contains a population with a cosmologically short time delay , while the observation of sne ia in very old systems indicates the existence of a population with large time delay .",
    "@xcite and later @xcite and @xcite proposed a  two - component \" sn ia rate , consisting of a prompt component , dependent on recent host galaxy star - formation , and a delayed component dependent on galaxy stellar mass .",
    "the overall sn ia rate is thus the sum of these two components , and can be further generalised as a function of the galaxy star - formation rate and stellar mass .",
    "observations strongly favor a two - component model over a single component model @xcite and since the cosmic star - formation rate increases with redshift , we expect that the prompt component will become a larger fraction of the sn ia population with increasing redshift .",
    "@xcite , using cluster rate measurements , suggest a universal delay time distribution , independent of environment and parameterized by @xmath12 .",
    "several attempts have been made to constrain the functional form of the sne ia rate .",
    "@xcite , using 124 sne ia from the snls survey , found that , for passive galaxies , the sne ia rate is consistent with a linear relationship with host galaxy stellar mass .",
    "recently , @xcite , used a sample of 274 sne ia from the loss survey , to consider how the size and morphology of the host galaxy affects the sne ia rate .",
    "they favor a power - law relationship between galaxy stellar mass and the sne ia rate ( snum ) with exponent approximately one half independent of both galaxy morphology and color .",
    "@xcite find evidence for both a  prompt \" ( age @xmath13 ) and `` delayed '' component ranging between @xmath14 and @xmath15.@xcite also show that sn ia rate in young stellar populations may be strongly correlated with the rate of core - collapse sn .",
    "a sn ia rate composed of two components may have ramifications when sne ia are used to determine cosmological parameters . since the two components are likely to have two different progenitor systems , the common assumption that all sne ia can be normalized in the same way is in question .",
    "it is likely that two distinct progenitor systems would contribute to the observed intrinsic scatter in the distances measured with sne ia .",
    "the relation between light - curve decline rate and peak luminosity for sne ia has been well tested @xcite , but the physics behind this relation and the details of the explosion mechanism are only partially understood @xcite .",
    "better understanding of the nature of sne ia explosions and progenitor systems will aid in improving the accuracy of sn ia distance measurements @xcite .",
    "the total sn ia rate has been well studied . @xcite and @xcite have constrained on the sn ia rate at high redshift , using the snls dataset to @xmath16 and sne ia from the subaru deep field ( sdf ) to @xmath17 , respectively .",
    "@xcite determined the most accurate sne ia rate at intermediate redshift using the first year sdss - ii sn dataset to @xmath18 and extended the analysis to @xmath19 in @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we investigate the characteristics of the host galaxies of sne ia at intermediate redshift using the sdss - ii sn dataset following the methodology described in @xcite .",
    "the sdss - ii sn survey is ideally suited to this task because it provides the largest , unbiased dataset currently available , with well understood efficiency corrections , in a redshift range fully in the hubble flow , but with high signal - to - noise observations .",
    "our host galaxies are well measured in several filter bands , allowing us to accurately estimate the galaxy s properties .",
    "the aim of this work is to measure the rate of sne ia explosions as a function of the host galaxy stellar mass and star - formation rate .",

    "we also describe the sample of field galaxies used for comparison , and how it is corrected for incompleteness . in  [ sec : hostrate ] we investigate how the sn ia rate is dependent on the properties of the host galaxy , studying how it is dependent on the stellar mass of the galaxy (  [ sec : massrate ] ) , the star - formation rate of the host galaxy (  [ sec : sfrrate ] ) , and the specific star - formation rate of the host (  [ sec : ssfr ] ) . finally , ",

    "this provides one of the largest samples of sne ia currently available .",
    "the sdss - ii sn survey was a three year rolling search that produced a sample of spectroscopically confirmed sne ia with well - measured multi - color light - curves at intermediate redshift ( @xmath20 ) using the sdss 2.5 m telescope @xcite at apache point observatory with a wide field ccd camera @xcite .",
    "observations were made in the sdss _ ugriz _ filters @xcite , alternating between the northern and southern  strips \" of the field designated as  stripe 82 \" @xcite , bounded by @xmath21 , and @xmath22 .",

    "the scene modelling photometry ( smp ) technique of @xcite was used to produce accurate photometric data for each sn event .",
    "the sdss - ii sn survey identified many thousands of transient events , of which @xmath26 were spectroscopically confirmed as sne ia and @xmath27 were other sn types @xcite .",
    "spectroscopic redshifts for the host galaxies of @xmath28 probable sne ia , based on their light - curves , were also obtained , and are discussed further in ",

    "@xcite measured the sne ia volumetric rate , @xcite and @xcite analyzed the effect of host galaxies on light - curve parameters , both from the photometric properties of the host galaxies and studying their spectral features .",
    "the sdss - ii sn survey is approximately magnitude limited , producing an otherwise unbiased sample .",
    "this analysis uses a sample of 342 sne ia in the redshift range @xmath0 , where the efficiency of the survey is high @xcite .",
    "this homogenous sample is comprised of 197 spectroscopically confirmed sne ia , with a further 87 having a host galaxy spectroscopic redshift .",
    "all objects are selected using a well defined selection criteria , and have well - measured light - curves that are consistent with a sne ia template , based on the bayesian light - curve fitting method of @xcite .",
    "the selection criteria used to create this sample is discussed in  [ sec : incompleteness ] .",
    "there are two major sources of inefficiency in the sdss - ii sn pipeline that lead to potential biases in the spectroscopically confirmed sn sample : detection efficiency and spectroscopic incompleteness .",
    "the detection efficiency was primarily magnitude limited and is amenable to calculation by simulation .",
    "the spectroscopic selection and analysis depends on many factors that are difficult to quantify .",
    "we adopt a strategy of augmenting the sample of spectroscopically confirmed sne ia with a sample of photometrically classified sne ia , identified by their light - curve shape and color and correcting for detection efficiency .",
    "the sdss - ii sn survey prioritized spectroscopic follow - up observations of sn candidates using a bayesian classification method @xcite .",
    "however , the final ranking and decisions on spectroscopic follow - up priorities were based on the telescope s capabilities , local weather conditions and the sn position on the sky , thus leading to a spectroscopic sample whose selection criteria are difficult to describe quantitatively . to produce a homogeneous sample of sn ia candidates",
    ", we therefore seek a sample selection that avoids the uncertain and time - varying spectroscopic target selection process .",
    "we also seek a sample with high quality light - curves and low levels of contamination .",
    "however , we must also ensure that the majority of detected sne ia pass this criteria , so that our results are not dominated by the efficiency corrections .",
    "we adopt a two - stage process . in the first stage ,",
    "we use photometry obtained during the sn ia search and the bayesian classification method , to apply very loose cuts that are intended to reduce the large number of non - sn ia transient objects that are classified as candidates by the sdss - ii search pipeline , while retaining any sn ia that could possibly survive our subsequent quality cuts . this sample",
    "is then analyzed by the more accurate smp photometry and fit by the mlcs2k2 light - curve fitter to obtain a sample of probable sn ia .",
    "the criteria used for our two - stage process is described as follows .",
    "firstly , as part of the sdss - ii sn operations , every transient object with more than two epochs was selected to be a candidate , after known agns , variable stars and pipeline artifacts were removed .",
    "there are @xmath29 such candidates .",
    "the bayesian classification technique , used in the sdss - ii sn search operations , fits sne ia , ib / c and ii template light - curves to each candidate , producing a probability , @xmath30 , for a candidate to belong to each class ( @xmath31 ) of sne .",
    "this method assumes that each candidate is a sn of some particular type , but has been shown , nevertheless , to be accurate in differentiating between different sn types @xcite .",
    "this bayesian classification technique was applied to each candidate , and the following criteria was used to select viable sn ia candidates :    * at least 3 search discovery epochs , * @xmath32 , * if the candidate has more than 5 search photometry epochs , the best - fit ia model is not sn 2005gj .",
    "additional cuts were considered , including using the photometric redshift from the nearest host galaxy to constrain the light - curve , but were rejected , as it is significantly harder to model the sdss - ii sn survey selection function with those cuts .",
    "our criteria select @xmath33 candidates , including @xmath34 of the spectroscopically confirmed sne ia . of the @xmath35 of confirmed sne ia",
    "that fail this selection criteria , @xmath36 ( 17 ) were only observed on one or two occasions , @xmath37 ( 45 ) do not satisfy the @xmath38 criteria , and @xmath39 ( 2 ) are best - fit by a 2005gj - like template ( including sn 2005gj itself ) .",
    "the selection criteria described above , uses photometry obtained during the sn ia search to produce a sample of candidates containing the vast majority of the spectroscopically confirmed sne ia , whilst removing the vast majority of non - sn ia transient objects . in the second stage of our selection criteria , this sample",
    "was then analyzed using the more complete and more accurate smp photometry and fit using the mlcs2k2 light - curve fitter @xcite to ensure each candidate has a well covered light - curve and is well fit by an sn ia event .",
    "the selection criteria are the same as were used by @xcite and @xcite , namely ,    1 .   at least 5 photometric observations ( all at different epochs ) between @xmath40 and @xmath41 days relative to peak light in the rest - frame of the sn , 2 .   at least one epoch with signal - to - noise ratio @xmath42 in each of _ g _ , _ r _ , and _",

    "the snana version @xcite of mlcs is able to estimate a photometric redshift for sn candidates in addition to determining a distance modulus .",
    "most of our 843 candidates lack spectroscopic redshift measurements , so we adopt a cosmological model of @xmath52 and @xmath53 , to reduce the number of fit parameters , and to determine a photometric redshift for each candidate . to construct a sample that is unbiased with respect to spectroscopic follow - up , and has a well determined selection function , we fit for a photometric redshift for all candidates , regardless of whether a spectroscopic redshift is known .",
    "an analysis of the accuracy of these photometric redshift estimates is given in @xcite , who find that the photometric redshifts are negligibly biased and are accurate to @xmath54 at low redshift @xmath55    these selection criteria ensure that each candidate has a well covered light - curve that is well fit by a normal sn ia event ( peculiar sne ia will generally not pass the selection criteria ) .",
    "while we have relied on photometric redshifts for the initial sample selection , we use spectroscopic redshift information , when available , for redshift selection and all subsequent analysis . to construct a sample that is primarily comprised of spectroscopically confirmed sne ia and not dominated by photometrically classified sne ia , and to avoid low detection efficiency ( see  [ sec : efficiency ] ) , we restrict our sn sample to the redshift range @xmath56 .",

    "the fact that the efficiency is less than @xmath84 at low redshift is caused by sn explosions that occur late or early in the observing season and fail to allow the required number of observations .",

    "this additional correction produces results that are consistent with our nominal result , with differences of much less than @xmath85 .",
    "we thus consider the survey efficiency to be a function solely of redshift , but note that other analyses have not considered the effect of this assumption on their results .    we have now defined a uniformly selected sample of 379 sne ia candidates with @xmath56 from the three years of the sdss - ii sn survey , and calculated the efficiency of the survey in this redshift range , which we shall invert to weight the galaxies in our sample .",

    "this magnitude cut is conservative , but applied to ensure that the sdss - ii sn pipeline is able to accurately distinguish between stars and galaxies in the deep stacks .",
    "the magnitude limits remove @xmath88 of our sne with either unobserved or too faint hosts .",
    "we then visually scan each host galaxy , using images with and without the supernova present to ensure that our host galaxy association is accurate . in six cases , at low redshift , where the host is extended or resolved into multiple objects , we select by hand a more likely object as the host galaxy . of the 379 sne ia candidates identified in  [ sec : incompleteness ] , 342 have a valid host galaxy identification , of which 197 ( @xmath89 ) are spectroscopically confirmed to be sne ia , and 87 ( @xmath58 ) are spectroscopically unconfirmed but have a host galaxy spectroscopic redshift .",

    "@xcite find the slope is independent of host galaxy type , with a value of @xmath138 providing a good fit in all cases .",

    "[ sec : hostgalprop ] , ssfr is a way of distinguishing between galaxy types , with galaxies with low values of ssfr being primarily large galaxies that are using a small fraction of their total stellar mass to form new stars , while those with larger levels of ssfr are starburst galaxies , or galaxies that are using a significant fraction of their stellar mass to form new stellar systems .",

    "the offset between the photometric redshifts produced by the pgase.2 seds and the spectroscopic redshifts for the host galaxy sample implies that the distribution of galaxies in the comparison field sample used in this analysis do not accurately reflect the distribution of galaxies in our redshift range .",

    "this is still in good agreement with other measurements .    when considering the effect that the offset in redshift and stellar mass has on the exponents considered for the sn ia rate , we see that the value of the slope determined in  [ sec : massrate ] decreases , although only by @xmath469 . in both cases ,",
    "a linear relationship between the sn ia rate per galaxy per year and stellar mass in passive galaxies is strongly disfavored , confirming the results of  [ sec : massrate ] .",
    "there is a corresponding decrease in the relationship between sn ia rate and stellar mass for star - forming galaxies ( at the @xmath470 level ) , although as in the main result , there is a clear difference between the rate in passive galaxies when compared to that in star - forming galaxies , indicating the need for a sn ia rate that is dependent on more than stellar mass .",

    "we thus conclude that the main results of this work , namely that the sn ia in passive galaxies is not linearly related to the stellar mass , and that the sn ia rate in star - forming galaxies is dominated by any recent burst of star - formation , are not dependent on issues surrounding the ability of pgase.2 to accurately determine the photometric redshifts for our comparison field sample .",

    "several spectral measurements are available ; we use the dust - corrected stellar mass ( median value ) and total star - formation rate ( median of the likelihood distribution ) , and determine estimates from the pgase.2 seds using the spectroscopic redshifts and model magnitudes .",
    "figure  [ fig : app : brinc_test ] shows the relationship between the spectroscopic and photometric estimates of stellar mass and star - formation rate .",

    "we find a mean difference of @xmath476 and variance @xmath477 , with estimates from pgase.2 being larger .",
    "this is not surprising , primarily as pgase.2 estimates the mean star - formation rate averaged over the last @xmath478 , while @xcite attempts to determine the instantaneous star - formation rate .",
    "nevertheless , the pgase.2 and @xcite values agree to within @xmath479 while the star - forming rates span over two orders of magnitude .",
    "no variation is seen as a function of redshift or apparent magnitude .",

    "throughout this analysis we have compared our observations at @xmath480 to those at higher redshift @xcite . while our methodology is identical to that used by @xcite , both analyses use filter sets that cover the same observed wavelength range , and thus the pgase.2 sed fits are carried out over different rest - wavelength ranges . to test how this difference may affect our conclusions , specifically the comparison to @xcite ,",

    "<S> using data from the sloan digital sky supernova survey - ii ( sdss - ii sn survey ) , we measure the rate of type ia supernovae ( sne ia ) as a function of galaxy properties at intermediate redshift . a sample of 342 sne ia with @xmath0 is constructed . using broad - band photometry and redshifts we use the pgase.2 spectral energy distributions ( seds ) to estimate host galaxy stellar masses and recent star - formation rates . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the rate of sne ia per unit stellar mass is significantly higher ( by a factor of @xmath1 ) in highly star - forming galaxies compared to passive galaxies . when parameterizing the sn ia rate ( @xmath2 ) based on host galaxy properties , we find that the rate of sne ia in passive galaxies is not linearly proportional to the stellar mass , instead a @xmath3 is favored . </S>",
    "<S> however , such a parameterization does not describe the observed sn ia rate in star - forming galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> the sn ia rate in star - forming galaxies is well fit by @xmath4 ( statistical errors only ) , where @xmath5 is the host galaxy mass ( in @xmath6 ) and @xmath7 is the star - formation rate ( in @xmath8 ) . </S>",
    "<S> these results are insensitive to the selection criteria used , redshift limit considered and the inclusion of non - spectroscopically confirmed sne ia . </S>",
    "<S> we also show there is a dependence between the distribution of the mlcs light - curve decline rate parameter , @xmath9 , and host galaxy type . </S>",
    "<S> passive galaxies host less luminous sne ia than seen in moderately and highly star - forming galaxies , although a population of luminous sne is observed in passive galaxies , contradicting previous assertions that these sne ia are only observed in younger stellar systems . </S>",
    "<S> the mlcs extinction parameter , @xmath10 , is similar in passive and moderately star - forming galaxies , but we find indications that it is smaller , on average , in highly star - forming galaxies . </S>",
