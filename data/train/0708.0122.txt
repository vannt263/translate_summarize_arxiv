    "in recent years , the interest in extra dimension models has been revived by string / m theory , in which the spacetime has to be multidimensional for the theory to be consistent @xcite .",
    "if large extra dimensions exist , the weakness of gravity may be `` explained '' by the large extra dimensional volume @xcite . among the extra dimension models in the literature , the brane world ( see @xcite for a review ) model seems the most popular , where the standard model ( sm ) fields are trapped in a ( 3 + 1)-dimensional hypersurface , whereas gravity can freely propagate in the bulk . yet another class of extra dimension models where all the sm fields can propagate in the extra simensions has also been seriously considered . in this type of model , so called universal extra dimension ( ued ) model , each sm particle is associated with a tower of kaluza - klein ( kk ) particles , with the mass difference between states equal to the inverse of the size of the extra dimensions .",
    "this type of model is phenomenologically interesting because it can be investigated in present and future collider experiments @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the ued may explain the proton stability @xcite , the number of generations @xcite , neutrino masses @xcite and fermion chirality @xcite .",
    "a cosmologically attractive feature of ued is that its lightest kk partner is stable and so it is a natural candidate for dark matter @xcite .",
    "it is quite unnatural to think that the extra dimensional volume , called the radion , remains fixed per se , and so some mechanism must be initiated to stabilize the radion @xcite .",
    "however , in @xcite , it was shown that a broad range of standard stabilization mechanisms fail to admit a static solution in the ued model in the matter dominated regime . besides",
    ", the redshifting of matter can also serve as a source to drive the evolution of the radion @xcite .",
    "thus , we may envision that the radion does not sit at the minimum of the potential quietly at the epochs of cmb formation and sne ia explosions . in the ued scenario ,",
    "the evolution of the radion will naturally induce the variation of various fundamental constants .",
    "we shall see that , in the einstein frame , the fermion masses , the gauge conplings and the qcd scale parameter @xmath10 will acquire radion dependence .",
    "effects of variations of extra dimensional volume on the fundamental constants have also been discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite .    by constraining the variation of constants at different redshifts",
    ", we can map out the allowed ranges of radion evolution at different epochs of the universe .",
    "constraint on radion evolution in the ued scenario by big bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) has been obtained in @xcite . in this paper , we seek complementary constraints from the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) and type ia supernovae ( sne ia ) data .",
    "since the cmb anisotropies are measured quite accurately by wmap @xcite and are sensitively dependent on various constants , we shall use the three - year wmap data to constrain the radion evolution in ued models .",
    "indeed , variations of several different fundamental constants have been constrained using cmb in the literature . among the fundamental constants ,",
    "the variation of the fine structure constant @xmath11 receives the most attention @xcite .",
    "other constants constrained by cmb include the electron mass @xmath12 @xcite and the gravitational constant @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "however , unification theories @xcite and string theory @xcite suggest that the fundamental constants vary in a correlated way and should be constrained simultaneously .",
    "for the ued model at the epoch of cmb formation , the relevant constants @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath10 all depend on the radion .    in the literature @xcite , sne ia data have been used to constrain the variation of the gravitational constant because the underlying physics of sne ia is dictated by the chandrasekhar mass @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the proton mass .",
    "a similar method can be applied to constraining radion evolution because @xmath15 depends on the @xmath10 and hence the radion .",
    "however , when the radion is light enough to evolve cosmologically , its mass should be comparable to the hubble parameter @xmath16 .",
    "furthermore , the coupling of the radion to matter is not expected to be much weaker than that of gravity to the matter .",
    "this means this field is highly constrained by tests of relativity and fifth force experiments @xcite . in particular , the solar system tests have ruled out such light scalar fields in the simplest models . a possible way out of this constraint is that the radion may be an environment - dependent chameleon field @xcite . in this scenario ,",
    "the effective potential of the scalar field depends on the density of the matter . on earth ,",
    "the density is large and the the field is massive , and it can be as light as @xmath17 in the cosmological scale . because of the `` thin - shell effect '' of the chameleon field , the effective coupling is much reduced , and the solar system constraints can be easily satisfied .",
    "the current constraints on such a light scalar field can be satisfied if the field is lighter than @xmath18 ev @xcite .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : dr ]",
    ", we carry out the conventional dimensional reduction to get the radion dependence of various constants in the context of ued .",
    "we then present the radion dependence of various constants relevant for cmb and sne ia , and their effects on the cmb power spectrum and sne ia in section  [ sec : effectcmbsne ] .",

    ", there is another class of models , called higgsless models , in which the zero modes of the kk tower of the fermions are removed by choosing suitable conditions at the extra dimensions rather than by the higgs mechanism . for the higgsless model considered in @xcite ,",

    "using the fact that @xmath111 scales with @xmath113 and the ionization cross - section varies as @xmath114 @xcite , we can derive @xcite @xmath115 which enable us to get the radion dependence of @xmath106 using the empirical fitting formula for @xmath106 .    among these effects",
    ", the change in the binding energy of hydrogen , @xmath111 , is the most significant , and so the qualitive changes in the power spectrum can be understood based on the change in @xmath111 .",
    "the variation of @xmath100 causes the hadron masses to vary .",
    "this will cause the energy density of the universe to change , and hence the expansion rate .",

    "it may arise from interaction of the sm particles with the radion . but without being too model - dependent , we simply ignore the soure / sink of the baryon energy density due to the variation of @xmath10 . a marked effect of the variation of the baryon energy density is the change in the ratio of baryon to photon energy density , usually defined as @xmath116 which is related to the sound speed @xmath117 as @xmath118 the effects of baryon on the power spectrum through @xmath119 are as follows @xcite .",

    "later recombination implies that the visibility function is broadened , and so the recombination takes a longer time to finish and the damping effect becomes more significant in the large @xmath125 scales .",
    "we also expect the early integrated sachs - wolfe effect to be reduced for having less residual radiation during a later recombination .    because of the exponential factor in eq .",
    "[ eq : lambda_cmb_0 ] , a large change in @xmath10 results , which means that the effect on the cmb power spectrum is appreciable .",

    "first , a decrease in baryon density reduces the hubble rate , and this implies that photon decoupling takes place later .",
    "the consequences of later recombination are that the sound horizon is larger , which corresponds to shifting of the peaks to smaller @xmath125 scales , and the damping in high @xmath125 scales is reduced .",
    "second , a decrease in baryon mass causes the sound speed to increase , which not only results in a larger sound horizon , but also shifts the equilibrium point less .",
    "the latter helps to restore the symmetry between the odd and even peaks ; in particular , the power of the first peak is reduced whereas the power of the second peak is boosted .",
    "indeed , we see that peaks shift to smaller @xmath125 scales due to the larger sound horizon caused by these two effects .",
    "the formation of cmb is basically determined by the values of @xmath75 , @xmath12 and @xmath15 at the last scattering surface , and so the cmb constraint limits the variation of these constants during the cmb recombination epoch , @xmath0 .",
