    "since the discovery of @xmath8 in 1974  @xcite , a lot of charmonium states had been found in the last century . among them , the vector states @xmath2 , @xmath9 , and @xmath3 , which are commonly assigned as @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 respectively , can be directly produced through @xmath7 annihilation into one photon , and thus can be readily detected at @xmath7 colliders like bepcii / besiii  @xcite and cesr / cleo .    aside from these vector resonances themselves , it is also interesting to detect the products via e1 transitions of these vector resonances into lower charmonium states .",
    "especially , the decay channels @xmath13 can be used to detect the 2p charmonia @xmath14 and to study the properties of these missing states .",
    "the importance of experimental establishment of these 2p charmonia consists in at least two aspects .",
    "on one side , the properties of @xmath14 are important to clarify the calculations in various potential models and coupled - channel models ( see , e.g.  @xcite and references therein ) . on the other side",
    ", the @xmath14 could be the candidates of some of the recently observed charmonium - like states , the so - called `` x , y , z '' states ( for a review see e.g.  @xcite ) .    according to potential model estimates ,",
    "the spin - triplet 2p states lie between 3.9 and 4.0 gev in the charmonium family  @xcite .",
    "experimentally , five charmonium(like ) resonances around 3940 mev have been found recently . the z(3930 )",
    "@xcite observed by the belle collaboration in 2006 in the @xmath15 fusion experiment with a mass @xmath16 mev is identified with the @xmath17 .",
    "the x(3915 ) , which was also produced in the @xmath15 fusion experiment@xcite and detected in the @xmath18 channel with a mass about 3915 mev , is possibly the @xmath19  @xcite . the y(3940 ) and y(3915 ) , which were detected in the @xmath20 process by the belle collaboration  @xcite and the babar collaboration  @xcite",
    "separately are another candidates for @xmath21 .",
    "the x(3940 ) , which was found by the belle collaboration  @xcite in the recoiling spectrum of @xmath8 in the @xmath7 annihilation process @xmath22 and @xmath23 , seems not to be a 2p state  .",
    "another well known state , the x(3872 ) , which was first found in the @xmath24 invariant mass distribution in the b meson decay around 3872 mev  @xcite with @xmath25 , might be interpreted as the @xmath26 molecule due to the closeness of its mass to the @xmath27 threshold .",
    "but its large production rate in @xmath28 collisions at the tevatron and some properties seem to support that it could be a compact bound state , such as the 2p charmonium @xmath29 , or a mixture of the @xmath29 with the @xmath26 molecule , despite of its lower mass .",
    "in fact , the mass of @xmath30 can be lowered to below 3.9 gev if the color screening effects and coupled channel effects are considered  @xcite .",
    "so it is interesting to examine in the e1 transitions of higher charmonia if the x(3872 ) can be seen by having the @xmath31 component in its wave function .",
    "because of the phenomenological importance of the @xmath32 states mentioned above , we will study the production of these states in the e1 transitions of higher vector charmonia , say , @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath9",
    ". the e1 transition width can be estimated by potential models .",
    "various potential models predict various transition widths",
    ". however , the transition widths of @xmath33 are usually small because of the smallness of the overlap integral between the wave functions of 4s and 2p states .",
    "on the other hand , the transition widths of @xmath34 , are relatively large ( tens to hundreds of kev as those shown in table  [ e1rad0 ] and table  [ e1rad1 ] ) and the corresponding branching ratios are about @xmath35 .",
    "so the @xmath36 may be detected at the upgraded bepcii / besiii through these channels .",
    "note that the e1 transition width depends on the phase space which is determined by the mass of @xmath36 . since the @xmath17 has been identified with z(3930 )",
    ", we can compare various potential model predictions with the experimental data of @xmath17 to see if it can be detected in the e1 transitions of higher charmonium states .",
    "this comparison may provide some hints in searching for the other two @xmath36 states .",
    "we introduce three typical potential models in section ii , and calculate in section iii the e1 transition widths of @xmath37 with both lowest- and first - order wave functions in the non - relativistic expansion within these models .",
    "we discuss the possibility for producing @xmath36 from e1 transitions of higher excited charmonium states and compare them with those `` x , y , z '' states in section iv , where the effects of s - d mixing of @xmath2 and @xmath3 on the e1 transition widths are also considered .",
    "a summary is given in section v.",
    "there are many phenomenologically successful potential models in the literature . among them the cornell model  @xcite(here we mark it by model ii ) is well known , which describes the charmonium system quite well .",
    "however , the predicted masses of higher charmonium states seem to be larger than their experimental values  @xcite .",
    "a distinct example is the mass of @xmath17 which is about 40 mev larger than the experimental value .",
    "the screened potential model ( see ref  @xcite and references therein)(here we mark it by model i ) was proposed to lower the masses of higher charmonia .",
    "so we take it here to estimate the e1 transition production of @xmath36 . the third model",
    "we take was proposed by ding et al .",
    "@xcite(here we mark it by model iii ) , in which the coulomb potential has a running coupling constant .",
    "the hamiltonian in these models have the form of @xmath38 , where @xmath39 is vector potential and @xmath40 is scalar potential and @xmath41 is the mass of charm quark .",
    "the potentials in model i  @xcite are : @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the screening factor which makes the long range scalar part @xmath44 become flat when @xmath45 and still linearly rising when @xmath46 , @xmath47 is the linear potential slope , and @xmath48 is the coefficient of the coulomb potential .",
    "the model parameters are chosen following ref  @xcite : @xmath49 where @xmath50 is essentially the strong coupling constant at the scale @xmath51 . here",
    "@xmath43 is the characteristic scale for color screening , and @xmath52 is about 2 @xmath53 , implying that at distances larger than @xmath52 the static color source in the @xmath54 system gradually becomes neutralized by the produced light quark pair , and string breaking emerges .",
    "the potentials in model ii  @xcite are : @xmath55 with model parameters taken similar to ref .",
    "@xcite : @xmath56    the potentials in model iii  @xcite are @xmath57 with parameters @xmath58    the potentials above are used to calculate the lowest - order and the first - order non - relativistic wave functions . for the first - order relativistic corrections to the wave functions , we include the spin - dependent part of @xmath59 , @xmath60 , @xmath61 and the spin - independent part @xmath62 as perturbations .",
    "the spin - spin contact hyperfine interaction is @xmath63 for coulombic vector potential , @xmath64 which gives too large a mass splitting of @xmath65 , so we make a substitution as in ref .",
    "@xcite for model i and model ii : @xmath66 where @xmath67 and @xmath68 in model i and @xmath69 in model ii .",
    "the spin - orbit term is @xmath70 and the tensor force term is @xmath71 where @xmath72 .    the spin - independent part is a bit complicated .",
    "we take the form as ref .",
    "@xcite : @xmath73 where @xmath74 and @xmath75 are momenta of c and @xmath76 quarks in the rest frame of charmonium , respectively , which satisfy @xmath77 , @xmath78 is the unit second - order tensor , and @xmath79 is the gromes s notation @xmath80 where @xmath81 is a second - order tensor .",
    "note that we do not include the contributions from the scalar potential in @xmath62 since it is still unclear how to deal with the spin - independent corrections arising from the scalar potential theoretically .",
    "e1 transitions of higher excited s- and d - wave charmonium states are of interest here because they can be used to produce and identify p - wave states . for the e1 transition width for charmonium",
    ", we use the formula of ref .",
    "@xcite : @xmath82 is the emitted photon energy .",
    "the spatial matrix element @xmath83 involves the initial and final state radial wave functions , and the angular matrix element @xmath84 is @xmath85    we are only interested in initial states with @xmath86 , i.e. , @xmath2 , @xmath9 and @xmath3 , since they can be easily produced in @xmath7 annihilation and can transit into spin - triplet 2p states by emitting a photon .    for the masses of initial and final states used to calculate @xmath87 in above three models , we take the central values from pdg(2010 )  @xcite if the states are well established experimentally .",
    "the mass of @xmath19 is supposed to be 3915 mev , while for the mass of @xmath31 we choose two different values : 3872 mev and 3915 mev .",
    "the calculated results with lowest - order wave functions are listed in table  [ e1rad0 ] .",
    "the results of barnes , et al .",
    "@xcite , which are similar to the model ii and the results of godfrey , et al .",
    "@xcite , with a relativized cornell model , are also listed in table  [ e1rad0 ] for comparison . from table",
    "[ e1rad0 ] , one can see that the widths @xmath88 , are very small due to large cancelation in the overlap integral between wave functions of 4s and 2p states , and therefore are very sensitive to the model details . on the other hand ,",
    "the predictions for the widths @xmath89 are large and insensitive to model details , resulting in quite steady values in different models .",
    "the results obtained with first - order wave functions are listed in table  [ e1rad1 ] . from (",
    "7 - 10 ) , one can see that the corrections to the non - relativistic potential involve some derivative terms , which make the potential to be more attractive towards the origin . as a result",
    ", the wave functions with relativistic corrections will be thinner than those without relativistic corrections .",
    "this effect usually reduces the spatial matrix elements @xmath90 defined in ( [ matrix ] ) , which can be seen directly by comparison between the results of @xmath89 listed in table  [ e1rad0 ] and in table  [ e1rad1 ] .",
    "however , the relativistic corrections can also change the node structures of the wave functions of higher exited states , such as @xmath9 , and make the cancelation in the overlap integral between the wave functions of 4s and 2p states more modest , and this can be seen in table  [ e1rad1 ] . on the other hand ,",
    "the transition width is proportional to the factor @xmath91 , which favors initial states with higher masses .",
    "thus , the decay widths @xmath88 listed in table  [ e1rad1 ] become larger .",
    "but we should mention that these results are not very reliable and are more sensitive to the model details than those of @xmath89 .",
    "we calculate the e1 transition branching ratios of @xmath2 , @xmath3 , and @xmath9 with their total width taken from pdg(2010 )  @xcite .",
    "since the errors of the total widths are relatively small for these states , we only take the central values of the total widths in calculating the branching ratios and do not consider the errors .    0.3 cm    [ cols= \" < ,",

    "in this paper , we calculate the e1 transition widths and branching ratios of @xmath92 in three typical potential models with both lowest- and first - order relativistically corrected wave functions .",
    "we find the transition widths of @xmath93 are model - insensitive and relatively large ( tens to hundreds of kev ) and the corresponding branching ratios are of order @xmath35 , which make the search for @xmath14 possible at @xmath7 colliders such as bepcii / besiii and cesr / cleo .",
    "this may help us identify some of the recently discovered x , y , z particles , especially the @xmath94 , @xmath95 , @xmath96 and @xmath97 .",
    "the possible 3s-2d mixing of @xmath2 and @xmath3 and its effect on the transition widths of @xmath98 are considered and found to be important .",
    "we find the transitions @xmath99 can be used to examine whether the mixing exists and to further possibly constrain the mixing angle ; and the transitions @xmath100 and @xmath101 can be used to estimate how far is the mixing angle from @xmath102 and @xmath103 , which are determined in a simple 3s-2d mixing model by the observed leptonic decay widths of @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "the transitions of @xmath104 are also discussed , and the @xmath105 transition is found to have a branching ratio of order of @xmath106 , which may be relatively easier to be detected .",
