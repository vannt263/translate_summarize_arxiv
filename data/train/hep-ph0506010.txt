    "during the last decades the tests of the perturbative qcd are focused on the experimental [ 1 - 15 ] and theoretical study [ 16 - 26 ] of hard processes like direct photon and @xmath0-production with large transverse momentum in @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 collisions . these processes",
    "offer a unique possibility to determine the parton distribution functions ( pdf ) inside the proton as well as the parton fragmentation functions ( pff ) .",
    "in particular the good understanding of the @xmath2 data is the prerequisite for any attempt to extract new physics , related to the formation of a quark - gluon plasma phase , from the @xmath3 and @xmath4 data .",
    "extensive studies of the @xmath5 ( or @xmath6 ) production in @xmath2 collisions have shown that the transverse momentum distribution @xmath7 of the partons inside the proton has to be taken into account for a succesfull description of the observed @xmath8 spectrum [ 20 - 23 ] . in all these investigations",
    "one assumes a gaussian form for @xmath7 .",
    "a new nonperturbative parameter is introduced through this approach : the mean instrinsic transverse momentum @xmath9 of the partons .",
    "although the data of some experiments concerning hadron production at large @xmath8 @xcite could be explained with relative small @xmath9 values ( @xmath10 ) , compatible with the heisenberg uncertainty relation for partons inside the proton , there are a number of other processes leading to a large mean transverse momentum ( @xmath11 ) , depending on @xmath12 , for a description of the corresponding experimental data .",
    "such a value of @xmath9 is too high and can not be explained as an internal structure of the proton @xcite .",
    "however , as mentioned by several authors @xcite the form of @xmath7 can influence significantly the value of @xmath9 as well as its @xmath8 dependence . in the present work we derive a transverse momentum distribution for the partons inside the proton using a potential quark model which has succesfully been used to describe the spectra of mesonic @xcite and baryonic @xcite bound states in the past .",
    "following @xcite we investigate the three - body quantum mechanical bound state problem solving numerically the schrdinger equation and obtaining the single particle transverse momentum distribution for the consistuent parton .",
    "our main assumption is that intrinsic transverse momentum effects are not influenced by the lorenz boost along the beam axis and therefore could be treated within a nonrelativistic approach .",
    "we use the derived distribution to fit experimental data for the @xmath13 process .",
    "in particular we investigate the measurements for the @xmath8-spectrum of the outcoming @xmath0 in three experiments performed at different center of mass energies .",
    "it turns out that a relatively low mean transverse momentum @xmath9 ( @xmath14 ) , compatible with intrinsic dynamics inside the proton , for the initial partons is sufficient in order to fit perfectly the experimental data .",
    "a smooth dependence of @xmath9 on @xmath8 , which within our approach is induced by a corresponding variation of the string tension in the quark - quark potential , is required .",
    "our analysis shows that the @xmath15 distribution of the consistuent partons can be strongly influenced by three - body effects and the form of the confining potential which have to be taken into account in order to describe correctly the experimental data concerning the pion production in @xmath2 collisions .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section 2 we present the parton model differential cross section as well as the corresponding kinematics for the @xmath0-production in @xmath2-collisions . in section 3 we derive the intrinsic transverse momentum disrtibution for the partons inside the proton using the quark potential model of @xcite . in section 4",
    "we present our numerical results concerning the description of the data of three different experiments @xcite as well as the corresponding dependence @xmath16 . finally in section 5",
    "we summarize our study and we discuss possible extensions of the present analysis .",
    "in the lowest - order perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) , the differential cross section for the direct pion production in @xmath2 collisions is given by : @xmath18 where @xmath19 ( @xmath20 ) are the longitudinal parton distribution functions ( pdf ) for the colliding partons @xmath21 and @xmath22 while @xmath23 is the parton fragmentation function ( pff ) for the pion .",
    "for the scale @xmath24 we use the relation @xmath25 proposed in @xcite with @xmath26 the usual mandelstam variables .",
    "the variable @xmath27 indicates the momentum fraction carried by the final hadron .",
    "the higher order corrections are taken into account by choosing @xmath28 for the corresponding coefficient in ( [ eq : eq1 ] ) in the @xmath8 region of interest .",
    "it is straightforward to include partonic transverse degrees of freedom using the following replacement @xcite in the pdfs of eq.([eq : eq1 ] ) : @xmath29 with @xmath20 . in order to avoid singularities in the differential cross sections describing the partonic subprocesses we introduce a regularizing parton mass @xmath30 , as in @xcite , in the mandelstam variables occuring in the denominator of the coresponding matrix elements",
    ". the explicit formulas of the relevant partonic cross sections can be found in @xcite .",
    "taking into account the transverse degrees of freedom we get the following expressions for the variables @xmath26 : @xmath31 due to energy - momentum conservation the momentum fraction of the final hadron @xmath27 is given by : @xmath32 for a consistent description of the kinematics in the partonic subprocesses we imply the cuts : @xmath33 to calculate the cross section given in eq.([eq : eq1 ] ) we have first to determine the distribution @xmath34 and then perform the corresponding phase space integrations .",
    "contrary to the usual treatment assuming a gaussian form for @xmath34 we will here derive an alternative expression based on a widely applied quark potential model .",
    "since the early days of quantum chromodynamics the main and almost unique tool used for the description of the hadronic bound states ( mesons , baryons ) remain potential models for the quark - quark and quark - antiquark pair interaction .",
    "one of the most succesfull models was proposed by a. martin used first to describe mesonic states @xcite and later to describe baryons @xcite .",
    "the quark - quark interaction within this model is given as : @xmath35 and a similar expression with adapted coefficients @xmath36 , @xmath37 holds for the quark - antiquark interaction . in the following",
    "we will consider a baryon consisting of 3 valence quarks interacting pairwise with the potential ( [ eq : eq6 ] ) .",
    "the hamiltonian operator of the system is given as : @xmath38 the baryonic ground state can then be obtained by solving the corresponding schrdinger equation .",
    "following @xcite it is convenient to introduce jacobi coordinates @xmath39 : @xmath40 getting the equation : @xmath41   \\psi_g(\\vec{\\xi}_1,\\vec{\\xi}_2,\\vec{\\xi}_3)=e_g \\psi_g(\\vec{\\xi}_1,\\vec{\\xi}_2,\\vec{\\xi}_3 )    \\label{eq : eq9}\\ ] ] with @xmath42 and @xmath43 is the constituent quark mass . eliminating the translational mode ( @xmath44 ) we obtain a partial differential equation ( pde ) depending solely on the variables @xmath45 , @xmath46 .",
    "the potential energy @xmath47 in eq.([eq : eq9 ] ) is given as : @xmath48 introducing the radial variable @xmath49 and the angular variables @xmath50 we rewrite eq.([eq : eq9 ] ) as follows : @xmath51 \\",

    "therefore the radial part of the ground state wavefunction obeys , within the above approximation , the equation : @xmath59 where : @xmath60 with @xmath61 and @xmath62 .",
    "the constant @xmath63 is given by : @xmath64 .",
    "it is straightforward to show that the ground state wavefunction in the momentum space ( conjugate to the space of @xmath65 ) is given by : @xmath66 where @xmath67 is the bessel function of order @xmath68 and @xmath69 is a normalization constant .",
    "it is useful to determine the transformation of the momenta @xmath70 to the cartesian momenta @xmath71 : @xmath72 the above expressions simplify in the center of mass frame @xmath73 of the baryonic system where the following relation is valid : @xmath74 the two - particle density @xmath75 in this case is given by : @xmath76 from eq.([eq : eq17 ] ) we obtain the one - particle transverse momentum density @xmath34 as : @xmath77 where @xmath78 is the cosine of the angle between the vectors @xmath79 and @xmath80 .",
    "in fact the function @xmath81 can be obtained only numerically by solving equation ( [ eq : eq14 ] ) using the numerov algorithm . therefore also the transverse momentum distribution ( [ eq : eq18 ] ) is known only numerically .",
    "the integrations in eqs.([eq : eq15],[eq : eq18 ] ) can be performed to a great accuracy ( relative error @xmath82 ) using a mixture of gauss - kronrod quadrature and the vegas monte - carlo integration routine @xcite . in fig",
    ".  1 we present the density in transverse momentum space of a parton inside the proton obtained by our approach .",
    "the values of the constants @xmath83 and @xmath84 are choosen according to @xcite in order to fit the size and the binding energy of the proton .",
    "the characteristic structure dominating the form of @xmath34 within our model is the second maximum at relative high transverse momenta .",
    "this leads , as we will see in the next section , to a reduction , relative to the gaussian case , of the mean intrinsic transverse momentum of the partons needed to describe the experimental data for the @xmath0-production at various energies .",
    "in the following we will use the derived distribution @xmath34 in order to calculate within the parton model the differential cross section for the @xmath0-production in @xmath2 collisions according to eq.([eq : eq1 ] ) . for the longitudinal parton distribution functions we use the recent martin , roberts , stirling and thorne ( mrst ) scheme @xcite while for the parton fragmentation functions we use the kniehl , kramer , potter @xcite parametrization .",
    "the additional nonperturbative parameter in our treatment is the mean value of the intrinsic transverse momentum @xmath9 which is related to the string tension @xmath84 in eq.([eq : eq6 ] ) .",
    "although the distribution @xmath34 is derived for the valence quarks inside the proton here we will use the same distribution also for the initial gluons assuming universality at the level of consistuent partons . in any case for longitudinal momentum fraction @xmath85 ( @xmath20 ) the contribution of valence quarks is dominant and our description is accurate .",
    "the phase space integrations are performed using the vegas monte - carlo routine . in order to fit the experimental data we allow @xmath9 to vary as a function of the beam energy and the transverse momentum ( @xmath8 ) of the finally produced hadron .",
    "we will analyse here the results of three experiments concerning @xmath0-production at different energies .",
    "the first set of data are taken from the fixed target experiment performed in fermilab ( protons incident on @xmath86 target ) @xcite .",
    "the cross section for the @xmath0-production with transverse momentum @xmath8 at midrapidity and for three different proton beam energies @xmath87 and @xmath88 is measured . in fig .  2 we present the various datasets using symbols while with solid lines we show the results of our calculation and with dashed lines the corresponding results using a gaussian @xmath34 .",
    "as we can see the two descriptions differ only in the region @xmath89 . within our approach",
    "we need an intrinsic transverse momentum @xmath9 of the order of at most @xmath90 in order to reproduce all the experimental data .",
    "it must be noted that in this case one can perfectly fit the data also for @xmath89 which , as we see in fig .  2 , is not possible using a gaussian distribution @xmath34 . in fig .",
    "3 we show the functions @xmath91 obtained using the quark model inspired function @xmath34 as well as a gaussian form .",
    "it is evident that the gaussian model leads to much higher values of @xmath9 .",
    "in particular this difference is large even for large values of @xmath8 where our approach is more precise as the valence quark contribution is dominant . as already discussed in the previous section this difference relies on the fact that the non - gaussian @xmath34 derived here posseses a second small local maximum at high transverse momenta ( see fig .",
    "1 ) attributed to the form of the quark - quark potential and the many - body character of the system .",
    "= 3.9 in    = 3.9 in    the second experiment we consider is the wa70 at cern sps @xcite .",
    "it is also a fixed target experiment with @xmath92 .",
    "we are interested in @xmath0-production . in fig .",
    "4 we show the experimental data ( full stars ) and the corresponding pqcd calculation using the quark model inspired @xmath34 ( solid line ) as well as a gaussian form ( dashed line ) . both distributions reproduce perfectly the experimental data and can not be distinguished graphically . however our approach leads to significantly lower values of @xmath9 than in the gaussian case .",
    "this can be clearly seen in fig .  5 where we show the function @xmath16 both for the quark potential model inspired @xmath34 ( full circles ) as well as the gaussian intrinsic transverse momentum distribution ( full stars ) . also in this case the difference in @xmath9 between the two approaches is large in a @xmath8-region where the main contribution is attributed to the valence quarks .",

    "= 3.9 in    = 3.9 in    finally we have analysed the @xmath94 data of the most recent phenix experiment at the relativistic heavy ion collider with @xmath95 @xcite . the corresponding cross section can be described to a good accuracy without inclusion of any @xmath15-smearing , a fact which is compatible with expectations for the perturbative character of the subprocesses involved in this case .",
    "here we have fitted the experimental data using non - gaussian @xmath15-smearing effects . in this way",
    "we get a perfect description of the measured cross section .",
    "the obtained mean intrinsic transverse momentum is almost constant : @xmath96 . based on heisenberg uncertainty relation one",
    "could explain this value of the mean transverse momentum as an effect of the internal partonic structure of the incident proton .",
    "our results are presented in figs .",
    "6,7 . the phenix data ( open cirlces ) for @xmath97",
    "together with the parton model calculations ( crosses ) using non - gaussian @xmath34 are shown in fig .",
    "the corresponding function @xmath91 is presented in fig",
    "= 3.9 in    = 3.9 in",
    "using a quark potential model capable to describe consistently baryonic systems as three quark bound states we have derived an intrinsic transverse momentum distribution @xmath34 of partons inside the proton .",
    "this , clearly non - gaussian , distribution is characterized by the presence of a smooth local maximum at relatively high transverse momenta .",
    "our approach is based on the idea that transverse momentum effects may be described nonrelativisticaly as they are not influenced by the lorenz boost along the beam axis . describing the @xmath15-smearing effects in the parton model for @xmath2 collisions through this non - gaussian distribution we calculated the differential cross section for @xmath0-production at midrapidity for different beam energies .",
    "assuming that the corresponding nonperturbative parameter @xmath9 , related to @xmath34 , depends on @xmath8 of the finally produced hadron as well as the incident energy , we obtain a perfect description of the experimental data measured in @xmath2 collisions at three different experiments .",
    "the corresponding values of @xmath9 as a function of @xmath8 could originate , according to heisenberg uncertainty relation , from the internal partonic structure of the proton .",
    "our approach is expected to be valid also in single photon production as well as @xmath3 and @xmath4 processes @xcite .",
    "therefore the performed analysis shows that many - body effects through a confining potential , reflected at the level of one - particle distributions , may influence strongly the @xmath15-smearing phenomena observed in hadronic collisions and therefore should be taken into account for a correct description of the experimental data ."
