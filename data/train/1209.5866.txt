    "note also that the bubbling and fredholm results are more naturally stated for equivalence classes of vortices .",

    "this group naturally corresponds to the gauge group @xmath290 , and its action to the action @xmath291 since every @xmath2-bundle over @xmath1 is trivializable , it follows that the quotient of @xmath286 by the action of @xmath285 bijectively corresponds to the quotient @xmath292 , consisting of gauge equivalence classes of triples @xmath101 of solutions of ( [ eq : bar dd j a u],[eq : f a mu ] ) .",
