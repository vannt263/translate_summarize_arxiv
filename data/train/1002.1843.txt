    "consider a set of data points in a bounded region @xmath5of @xmath6 , stored on disk . a standard operation on such point sets is to retrieve all points that lie inside a certain query range , for example a circle or a square . to prevent large delays because of disk head movements while answering such queries , it is desirable that the points are stored on disk in a clustered way  @xcite .",
    "similar considerations arise when storing spatial data in certain types of distributed networks  @xcite or when scanning spatial objects to render them as a raster image ; in the latter case it is desirable that the pixels that cover any particular object are scanned in a clustered way , so that the object does not have to be brought into cache too often  @xcite . for ease of explanation , we focus on the application of clustering to storing points on disks",
    ".        we could try to achieve a good clustering in the following way .",
    "we divide @xmath5into _ tiles_. the tiles could , for example , form a regular grid of hexagons ( see figure  [ fig : queries ] ) .",
    "now we store the points in each tile as a contiguous block on disk . to answer a query , say with a region @xmath1 bounded by a circle , we compute which tiles intersect  @xmath1 . for each intersecting tile , we move the disk read head to the position where the first point in that tile is stored , and then we retrieve all points in the tile by just scanning them sequentially without further delays from disk head movements . since some of the tiles that intersect @xmath1 may lie partially outside  @xmath1 ,",
    "some of the points thus retrieved may be _ false answers _ : they are no answers to our query and need to be filtered out in post - processing .",
    "the approach sketched above may work pretty well , provided the following conditions are met :    1 .",
    "we can compute efficiently which tiles intersect  @xmath1 .",
    "2 .   we can figure out efficiently where the contents of these tiles are stored on disk ( for example , using a small index to be kept in main memory ) .",
    "3 .   a couple of tiles suffice to cover @xmath1 ( so that we do not have to move the disk read head to the starting point of another tile too often ) ; 4 .   the tiles that cover @xmath1 are not much larger than @xmath1 ( so that they do not contain too many false answers ) .",
    "these conditions are subject to a trade - off .",
    "on one extreme , we could use only one tile that covers all of @xmath5(making the first three conditions trivial ) , bring the disk head into position only once , and scan all data points  including lots of false answers . on the other extreme",
    ", we could make the tiles so small that each of them contains very few points and we get very few false answers , but then we may get large delays because of disk head movements when going from tile to tile ; the first and second condition may also be harder to satisfy in this case .",
    "the best balance is to be found somewhere between these extremes , but where ?    if the data points are not uniformly distributed in @xmath5and we choose any fixed tile size , then some of the tiles may contain many more data points than others .",
    "when the query range @xmath1 is a small region inside such a crowded tile , we would need to retrieve all points in the tile , including many false answers ( see figure  [ fig : queries ] ) . at the same time",
    ", there may be regions with many tiles with very few data points each .",
    "queries that cover many such tiles ( see figure  [ fig : queries ] ) may incur an overhead for retrieving many separate tiles that is disproportionally large relative to the number of data points found .",
    "this brings us to the topic of this paper : _ recursive _ tilings .",
    "a recursive tiling is a subdivision of @xmath5into tiles , that are each subdivided into tiles recursively .",
    "for example , figure  [ fig : trapezoids ] shows a recursive tiling based on trapezoids , expanded down to the level where each tile contains at most one data point .",
    "we store the data points in such a way that for each tile , on any level of recursion , the data points within that tile are stored as a contiguous sequence on the disk .",
    "hopefully , if we get it right , we can now cover the region within any circle @xmath1 with a small set of tiles from the level of recursion where the tiles have size proportional to @xmath1 .",
    "thus we would satisfy condition three and four at the same time , and because we need to retrieve only few tiles , we could also hope to satisfy condition one and two . considering that moving the disk head once may easily cost as much time as scanning ten thousands of points from disk",
    ", it is really important to keep the number of tiles small .",
    "hence the topic of this study : what recursive tilings make it possible to cover any disk - shaped query region @xmath1 with the smallest possible number of tiles , while still making sure that the total size of the tiles is at most some constant times the size of  @xmath1 ?    in this paper , we study this question for two- and three - dimensional settings , and we give some basic results for higher dimensions .",
    "we also study what can be achieved by controlling the order in which tiles are stored .",
    "note that until now , we only required that the data points within each tile are stored contiguously , but we did not assume anything about the order in which the subtiles of any tile are stored with respect to each other . a well - chosen order may have the result that some of the tiles used to cover the query range are stored consecutively on disk , thus eliminating the need to move the disk head when going from one tile to the next .      to be able to make our problem statement more precise , we define the arrwwid number of a recursive tiling of a region @xmath5as follows :    _ _",

    "their work considers scanning orders that follow square grid tilings in such a way that each tile touches the previous tile in the scanning order .",
    "note that all curves mentioned so far , except z - order , are like that .",
    "in such tilings , consecutive tiles may be _ horizontally connected _ ( sharing a vertical edge ) , _ vertically _ connected ( sharing a horizontal edge ) or they may be _ diagonally connected _ ( touching only in a vertex ) .",

    "their results suggest that diagonal connections ( as in the @xmath13curve ) are harmful for random walks , regardless of the cost of jumping relative to scanning .      in this paper , we extend the scope of our knowledge on arrwwid numbers to different tilings , which do not necessarily have four squares per square , and to higher dimensions .",
    "the results are the following : in two dimensions , no recursive tiling and no recursive space - filling curve has arrwwid number better than three if the tiles are simply connected regions in the plane .",

    "any given ( recursive or non - recursive ) tiling , the _ degree _ of a point @xmath19 in @xmath5is the maximum number of interior - disjoint tiles that meet in @xmath19 .",
    "the _ vertex degree _ of a ( recursive or non - recursive ) tiling is the maximum degree of @xmath19 over all points @xmath20 .",
    "the results in this paper apply to simple as well as composite tilings , and uniform as well as non - uniform tilings .",
    "we only require that the number of recursion rules is finite , that each rule that defines the tiling starts with a finite region , and that the transformations that may be applied to the rules preserve similarity .",
    "[ ob : squaretiling ] the uniform square tiling of figure  [ fig : tilings](a ) has arrwwid number four .",
    "we first prove that the arrwwid number of the uniform square tiling is at most four .",
    "let @xmath21 be the radius of any disk @xmath1 . since the tiles differ in width by a factor two from one level of recursion to the next , there is a level of recursion where the tiles have side lengths between @xmath22 and @xmath23 , and hence , area between @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "the distance between any pair of horizontal lines of the grid formed by these tiles is at least @xmath22 , so @xmath1 is crossed by at most one horizontal grid line . by the same argument ,",
    "@xmath1 is crossed by at most one vertical grid line .",
    "it follows that at most four tiles of this grid intersect @xmath1 , so @xmath1 can always be covered by at most four tiles with total area at most @xmath26 .",
    "hence the arrwwid number of the square tiling is at most four ( with cover ratio at most @xmath27 ) .",
    "it remains to show that the arrwwid number of the uniform square tiling can not be three or less .",
    "suppose the arrwwid number would be at most three , so there is a constant @xmath7 such that any disk of radius @xmath21 can be covered by at most three tiles with total area at most @xmath28 .",
    "consider a fixed value @xmath21 , a tile @xmath29 with area more than @xmath30 , and a disk @xmath1 of radius @xmath21 placed in the middle of this tile  @xmath29 , that is , centered on the spot where the four subtiles of @xmath29 meet .",
    "thus @xmath1 intersects each of the four subtiles of @xmath29 , and the only way to cover it with less than four tiles is by covering it with @xmath29 itself  but the area of @xmath29 is larger than @xmath30 .",
    "this contradicts our assumptions and thus proves that the arrwwid number of the uniform square tiling is at least four .",
    "the above arguments illustrate that there is a relation between the vertex degree of a tiling and its arrwwid number :    the arrwwid number of a recursive tiling can not be lower than its vertex degree .",
    "this is because any sufficiently small circle centered on a point of maximum degree would yield a contradiction to the assumption that the arrwwid number is lower .",
    "the subdivision of the unit tile @xmath5into its subtiles creates at least one curve @xmath7 in the interior of  @xmath5 .",
    "since tile sizes decrease by at least a constant factor with each level of recursion , further down in the recursion @xmath7 must eventually be subdivided by crossings or t - junctions with curves that divide the tiles on each side of @xmath7 .",
    "thus we get points on @xmath7 of degree at least three .",
    "hence we get the following :    [ th:2dtilinglb ] each recursive tiling of a two - dimensional region @xmath5has arrwwid number at least three .",
    "we now ask : are there actually any recursive tilings with arrwwid number three ? in the next subsections , we answer this question with `` yes '' .",
    "as observed above , the arrwwid number of a tiling is at least the vertex degree of the tiling .",
    "therefore , to find a tiling with arrwwid number three , we need to find a tiling with vertex degree at most three .",
    "a regular hexagonal tiling has this property , but that tiling is not recursive : a hexagon can not be subdivided into similar hexagons .",
    "we will now see how a recursive tiling can be obtained by recursively approximating a hexagon by smaller hexagons ; this procedure will turn the boundaries of the hexagons into fractals .",
    "the technique itself is not new ; however , i am currently not aware of any published general description such as the one given below .",
    "the procedure is as follows .",
    "we start with a _",
    "coarse tiling _ which is a regular tiling of large hexagonal tiles .",
    "we overlay this with a _ fine tiling _ of small hexagonal tiles , such that the fine tiling looks the same around each large tile ( figure  [ fig : recursification](a ) ) .",
    "now we assign each small tile to a large tile , in such a way that the union of the small tiles assigned to each large tile approximates the shape of the large tile well .",
    "to accomplish this we assign each small tile that is completely contained in a single large tile @xmath29 to @xmath29 .",
    "the remaining small tiles are assigned according to a tie - breaking rule that ensures that for each large tile the union of the small tiles assigned to it has the same size and shape . in figure",
    "[ fig : recursification](b ) we do this as follows : when going clockwise around a large tile @xmath29 , starting at three oclock , we alternate between giving a small tile to a neighbour of @xmath29 and assigning a small tile to @xmath29 .",
    "all large tiles of the coarse grid are now replaced by the union of the small tiles assigned to them ( figure  [ fig : recursification](c ) ) , thus adding detail to the boundaries of the large tiles .",
    "we now replace the small tiles by scaled copies of the large tiles ( which are no longer hexagons ) , and again replace the large tiles by the unions of the small tiles assigned to them .",
    "this adds even more detail to the boundaries of the large tiles ( figure  [ fig : recursification](d ) ) . when we repeat this process ad infinitum , the boundaries of the tiles will converge to fractal shapes such that each large tile is tiled by nine scaled - down copies of itself ( figure  [ fig : recursification](e ) ) .    to    the transformation described above changed the shape of the tiles in the coarse tiling , but it did not change its topological structure . the vertex degree of the resulting tiling is still three , but unlike the original hexagonal tiling , our fractal tiling is recursive .",
    "in fact , we have produced a fractal tiling with arrwwid number three ( we will see how to prove such things below ) .",
    "to    to    to    the technique described above requires some care : it matters how well the small hexagonal tiles approximate the large hexagonal tiles .",
    "figure  [ fig : gosper ] shows a recursification with seven small tiles per large tile , resulting in a tiling with shapes called gosper islands  @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig : rhombus ] shows an attempt with four small tiles per large tile",
    ". however , it fails to produce a fractal tiling with arrwwid number three : the approximation of large tiles by small tiles is so bad that the hexagonal tiling morphs into a regular grid of rhombuses with vertex degree four .",
    "figure  [ fig : disconnected ] shows another failed attempt : here the result is a tiling whose tiles have disconnected interiors , and it contains vertices where three different tiles meet the three largest connected components of a fourth tile .",
    "[ th : gosper ] a recursive tiling with gosper islands has arrwwid number three .",
    "assume that in the course tiling neighbouring vertices are at a distance @xmath31 from each other .",
    "in the first stage of refinement , each segment @xmath32 of a large tile boundary is replaced by three segments of length  @xmath33 , the first and last of which make an angle of @xmath34 with @xmath32 .",
    "the new boundary of the large tile thus stays within a distance @xmath35 of the old boundary .",
    "refining the tiles @xmath36 times recursively thus keeps the boundary within a distance @xmath37 that satisfies @xmath38 ; for @xmath39 this converges to @xmath40 .",
    "let @xmath41 and @xmath42 be the radius of the smallest disk that intersects more than three large tiles in the original and in the recursified large tiling , respectively .",
    "we have @xmath43 , and since the tile boundaries in the recursified tiling are within a distance of @xmath44 from the tile boundaries in the original tiling , we have @xmath45 .",
    "now consider any disk @xmath1 of radius @xmath21 .",
    "there is a level of recursion in the recursified tiling where @xmath31 , the distance between neighbouring vertices in the underlying hexagonal tiling , is between @xmath46 and @xmath47 . since @xmath48 , the disk @xmath1 intersects at most three of the tiles on this level of the recursified tiling , and each of these tiles has area @xmath49 ( equal to the hexagon whose position they are taking ) .",
    "it follows that @xmath1 can always be covered by three tiles of total area at most @xmath50 ; hence the arrwwid number of the gosper tiling is three .",
    "to    in a similar way one could prove that the tiling of figure  [ fig : recursification](e ) has arrwwid number three .",
    "the recursification technique can also be applied to non - hexagonal tilings . a recursified grid of squares with five small tiles per large tile results in a tiling of cross - like shapes  ( see @xcite plate 49 , or @xcite ) .",
    "other examples with hexagons can be seen to underly the `` generalised gosper curves '' of akiyama et al .",
    "figure  [ fig : shiftedsquares ] shows a recursified tiling based on a grid of squares of which each column is shifted by half a square s height with respect to the next column ; it has arrwwid number three .",
    "the fractal tilings are beautiful , but have one big practical disadvantage : for any given point it is hard to figure out in which tiles it lies",
    ". it would be quite challenging to sort any given set of data points into fractal tiles , so it would be hard to use such tilings to build a data structure .",
    "therefore it may be interesting to look for a tiling with arrwwid number three that uses simpler tiles , namely rectangles .    in a uniform rectangular tiling , each rule defines a subdivision of a large rectangle into , say , @xmath51 similar , smaller rectangles which are scaled by a factor @xmath52 with respect to the large rectangle .",
    "let @xmath53 be the width / height ratio of the large rectangle ; without loss of generality , assume @xmath54 .",
    "for any horizontal line through the large rectangle , the smaller rectangles along that line must fill the full width of the large rectangle .",
    "this implies that for fixed @xmath53 and @xmath51 , the equation@xmath55 has at least one non - negative integer solution for the variables @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "similarly , considering vertical lines we find that@xmath58 must have a non - negative integer solution .",
    "in fact , to get an arrwwid number of three , for each of the variables @xmath56 , @xmath57 , @xmath59 and @xmath60 there must be a solution to the above equations where this variable is at least one .",
