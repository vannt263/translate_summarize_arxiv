    "multi - wavelength observations of galaxy clusters have provided substantial evidences for supermassive black holes ( smbh ) residing in the nuclei of giant elliptical galaxies which are found near the cluster centres and dense galactic environments .",
    "the extremely large mass of these black holes ( @xmath1 ) raises several questions : what processes regulate the growth of these smbh ? why and how only some of them turn - on their radio jets ? what is the source of fuel for the central - engine ? and what environmental impact could a massive black hole and its energetic outflows may have on the host galaxy and the surrounding gaseous intra - cluster medium ( icm ) ? some important clues to these questions are provided by radio and x - ray observations of galaxy clusters which show that majority ( as many as @xmath070 - 100 percent ) of these central giant elliptical galaxies ( cd galaxies ) may become radio - loud - ejecting plasma and magnetic fields in the form of powerful radio - jets - when they are located at the focus of a ` cooling - flow ' @xcite .",
    "the probability of finding a central radio source increases in direct proportion to decrease in cooling time of the inner icm @xcite .",
    "a cooling - flow is established when the central radiative cooling time ( @xmath2 ) of the icm of a galaxy cluster is quite short ( @xmath2 1 gyr @xmath3 , the hubble time ) . in the absence of a central heating mechanism",
    ", the pressure balance is disturbed and to restore the hydrostatic equilibrium , a steady convergent flow of cooling gas towards the cluster centre is setup , in which the gas cools below the x - ray temperature and accretes onto the central elliptical galaxy @xcite .",
    "strongest spectral signatures of this cooling gas are low energy x - ray lines below 1  kev from various ionization states of iron ( mainly fe  l complex ) . early _ einstein",
    "_ observations of nearby radio - loud cd galaxies in cooling - flow clusters such as m87 ( virgo - a ) and ngc  1275 ( 3c84 ,",
    "perseus - a ) did find the expected fe  l lines , thus supporting the cooling model @xcite .",
    "evidence for cooling gas was also seen in other wavelengths , although at rates lower than expected ; @xmath4 emitting filaments of ionized , warm gas @xcite , star formation activity @xcite and radio observations of co molecular lines @xcite .    in recent years more detailed x - ray observations with _",
    "chandra _ and _ xmm - newton _ telescopes have revealed a surprising and somewhat puzzling aspect of cooling flows ; they showed far less cooling below x - ray emitting temperatures than expected , altering the previously accepted picture of cooling flows ( cf .",
    "review by @xcite ) .",
    "unless gas is thermally supported , radiative cooling leads to a ` cooling catastrophe ' , i.e. , an inexorable inflow of cold gas onto the central galaxy . to prevent this",
    ", some heating mechanism was required to raise gas temperature above @xmath5 kev , suppressing the cooling flow .",
    "although several such mechanisms were discussed , the most promising heating process turned out to be the energy injected into the icm by powerful radio jets emanating from agns in central galaxies of clusters and groups ( e.g. , @xcite , and see @xcite for a review ) .",
    "this agn - heating mechanism is also found to be particularly effective in suppressing the star formation activity , that one expects to be prolific around the brightest cluster galaxies ( bcgs ) due to their preferential location in clusters .",
    "these bcgs should be accompanied by intense star formation activity and have blue colours , neither of which is observed and energy input from agn outbursts in clusters may be especially needed to explain the observations .",
    "one of the canonical models of agn posits accretion of gaseous medium as fuel for the nuclear black hole , such that agn outflows are powered by gravitational binding energy released by the infalling matter @xcite .",
    "the observed strong association of an agn in the central galaxy and the surrounding cooling - core lends good support to this model , which suggests that the black hole ` central engine ' is possibly fueled by accretion of cooling gas @xcite , with the flow rate self - regulated by agn - heating @xcite , indicating a complex feedback loop with tight coupling between a central black hole and the surrounding gas of cooling core .",
    "although this model is plausible and widely used , many details of how this feedback process works remain far from clear .",
    "when the radio jets emerging from the central black hole ( agn ) interact with the dense thermal plasma of the icm , two bubble - like lobes of non - thermal plasma are inflated , which are filled with relativistic particles and magnetic field and thus become visible in radio observations .",
    "such bubbles were first proposed by @xcite and later identified in several clusters using radio and x - ray observations ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the most clear example of this phenomenon are the non - thermal bubbles in clusters ms0735.6 + 7421 , hydra - a , abell 2052 , perseus and others , showing an unusually large and energetic pair of radio emitting , x - ray dark cavities ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "episodic ( on - off ) activity of radio jets injects non - thermal radio bubbles which may heat the icm via weak shocks , and additionally these plasma bubbles are responsible for the mechanical ( pdv ) work done on the icm for heating it , which is one of the favored mechanism of agn - icm feedback .",
    "several examples of these bubble and cavities , with diameter ranging from 1 - 100 kpc , have been found in the hot atmosphere surrounding galaxies in groups and clusters ( e.g. , @xcite ) . in few sources",
    "the energy involved is @xmath6 erg , the most powerful radio outbursts known ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the energy involved is large enough to strongly affect or even quench any cooling flow , and to drive large - scale outflows that redistribute and heat the gas on cluster - wide scales .",
    "the radio lobe plasma fill the cavities , which shows that expanding jets have displaced the icm thermal gas , excavating x - ray dark cavities and possibly shock heating the surrounding gaseous medium ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "this heat input into the icm may be large enough to counter - balance the cooling loss , and may even stop the accretion flow of matter onto the smbh , thus starving the central engine of its fuel .",
    "therefore , bubble - like diffuse radio sources residing near cluster centres are extremely effective probes of the poorly understood physics of the radio galaxy - icm feedback process .",
    "also directly related to these issues is the detection of diffuse non - thermal synchrotron radio plasma and magnetic fields mixed with the icm of clusters .",
    "approximately 30 galaxy clusters show _ giant radio haloes _  centrally located synchrotron radiation extended on mega - parsec scales with a regular morphology , similar to that observed in x - rays .",
    "a few galaxy clusters also show peripherally located",
    "_ radio relics _ which have elongated morphology and that may extend over 100 kpc  1 mpc scales . the radio emission from giant radio haloes and radio relics",
    "is not directly connected to the galaxies in clusters and both are mainly observed in merging clusters , which indicates that radio emitting relativistic electrons may have been accelerated in - situ in merger induced shocks and/or turbulence ( cf .",
    "review @xcite and references therein ) . in the case of relics ,",
    "an alternative model has been proposed , which invokes adiabatic compression of relic radio lobes by cluster merger shocks @xcite .    a third remarkable category of large scale diffuse radio sources are the _ radio mini - haloes_. unlike the mega - parsec scale giant radio haloes and relics ( which are found to be associated with cluster merger phenomenon and hence rarely found in cooling core clusters ) , radio mini - haloes are not only a few times smaller in size ( @xmath0100 - 500 kpc , comparable to size of the cooling core ) but they are seen to surround the central radio galaxies of some cooling core clusters ( see reviews : @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "radio mini - haloes are rare objects , have low surface brightness and a steep spectral index ( @xmath7 - 1 ) @xmath8 frequency@xmath9 .",
    "the fact that mini - haloes are mostly observed at the centres of cooling - core clusters indicates that their origin and evolution are connected to the energy feedback from the central agn into the icm via radio jets and cooling / heating processes .",
    "thus , while mini - haloes share with gaint - haloes and relics the properties of a steep radio spectrum and very low surface brightness , their physical origins are probably different .",
    "this is corroborated by the finding that unlike the mini - haloes , giant haloes have remarkably similar synchrotron emissivities , albeit the two are similar morphologically @xcite .",
    "radio mini - haloes",
    "are still a very poorly understood phenomenon and in observational terms , they being roughly centred at the dominant cluster radio galaxy makes their detection particularly challenging .",
    "three early examples of radio mini - haloes are associated with the cooling flow clusters : perseus - a @xcite , a  2142 @xcite and rx  j1347.5 - 1145 @xcite .",
    "continued searches have so far revealed no more than 10 mini - haloes ( see @xcite ; @xcite and references therein ) . due to their very steep spectrum ,",
    "radio - haloes in clusters are difficult to detect at higher frequencies , and therefore a low frequency radio telescope such as the gmrt is well suited for their study ( e.g. , @xcite;@xcite ) .",
    "the focus of present paper is on a diffuse halo - like radio source   and its radio and optical properties , as revealed in our detailed observations , their astrophysical implications and impact on the above topics .",
    "earlier a brief report on this radio source matching the characteristics of a mini - halo , was presented by some of us , based on vla and gmrt observations @xcite .",
    "these radio observations revealed an amorphous source of an ultra - steep radio spectrum @xmath10 and size @xmath0 1.5 .",
    "molonglo reference catalogue _ source mrc  0116 + 111 , had been resolved on arc - minute scale in the _ ooty lunar occultation survey _ at 327  mhz @xcite .",
    "an r - band image taken with the eso _ new technology telescope _ ( ntt ) showed that this amorphous radio source is centred at the dominant member of a galaxy group having at least 3 - 4 members for which ntt / emmi spectroscopy yielded redshifts close to 0.131 @xcite .",
    "more recently , this system has been listed in a catalogue of distant clusters of galaxies @xcite . in order to clarify the nature of this peculiar radio source and its relation to the brightest cluster galaxies , we have imaged it freshly with gmrt at 240 mhz , 621 mhz and 1.28 ghz with high sensitivity and resolution , and",

    "we note that the radio luminosity of   at 1.4 ghz , @xmath35 = @xmath36 w  hz@xmath21 , is quite large , comparable to the luminous radio - haloes in perseus and a2390 clusters .",
    "also , its bolometric radio luminosity ( over 10 mhz - 10 ghz range ) , @xmath37 = @xmath38 w , close to the divide between fri and frii class radio sources , would place it amongst the most luminous radio haloes known .",
    "gmrt 621 mhz radio map of   ( fig .",
    "[ gmrt_2 ] ) and its other radio maps ( fig.[gmrt_1 ] , [ gmrt_3 ] ) clearly show that on larger scales ( @xmath0100 kpc ) the radio - halo emission comprises of two diffuse ` lobe'-like structures surrounding the central group of galaxies , which we suggest are actually a pair of giant , radio emitting plasma bubbles , filled with relativistic particles ( cosmic rays ) and magnetic field . in figure  [ gmrt_2 ]",
    "the dotted lines delineate this pair of radio bubbles , having the projected dimensions @xmath027.5@xmath3017.5(= 64.4 kpc @xmath3041 kpc ) - the semi - major and minor axes of ellipse for the smaller elliptical north - west bubble , and @xmath035(= 82 kpc ) radius for the larger spherical bubble to south - east of the cluster centre .",
    "the total spatial extent of radio emission is @xmath0240 kpc which apparently surrounds the dominant brightest cd - like elliptical galaxy of the cluster ( fig .",
    "[ igo_bvr ] ) .",
    "however , based on the detection sensitivities achieved in our present gmrt and vla observations ( see table  1 ) , there is no strong evidence that the extended radio emission emanates from this or any other galaxy enclosed within the radio contours .",
    "the highest resolution gmrt 1.28 ghz map ( fig .",
    "[ gmrt_1 ] ) and other radio maps have not detected a compact active radio nucleus ( agn ) and radio - jets directly feeding into the 100-kpc scale twin plasma lobes / bubbles of . in this respect",
    "is very unusual and it differs from other well known mini haloes , including canonical m87 and perseus - a @xcite , which have detectable powerful agn cores and jets .",
    "the high resolution gmrt 1.28 ghz image of   also do not show any other compact agn - related background sources blended with the radio - halo emission , which clearly rules out its origin from such a contamination ( fig .",
    "[ gmrt_1 ] ) .    therefore , this suggests to us a physical picture in which the relativistic particles and magnetic fields of   halo were initially seeded by a pair of radio - jets originating in agn activity in the past , most likely from the nuclear smbh of the central cd galaxy , as revealed by the pair of plasma bubbles straddling this galaxy .",
    "however , at present  resembles a quiescent or ` fossil ' source  in the sense that its twin extended lobes / bubbles of radio plasma not energized by active jets from an agn  as observed in classical radio galaxies .",
    "this suggests that the smbh embedded in the nucleus of the cd galaxy , which was once active , probably has turned - off its radio jets sometimes back in the past .",
    "only a handful of such ` fossil ' or ` dying ' radio galaxies are known so far , which are more easily detected at low radio frequencies due to their very steep spectra ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "it is possible that we have caught the central massive black hole , which created , during a low or even quiescent state of its activity cycle .",
    "if the heat input into the icm by these expanding radio bubbles is large enough to significantly offset the cooling loss , the flow of accreting matter onto the smbh may stop , thus starving the ` central engine ' of its fuel .",
    "so we expect that this radio bubble - fed energy exchange should give rise to an episodic triggering of the agn itself , establishing a self - regulated activity pattern between cooling flow and agn activity .",
    "we point out that this cyclic process , even if in operation , does not imply that some form of _ in situ _ re - acceleration of particles in shocks or turbulence does not take place in the central cooling core and the extended lobes of    a scenario , in fact supported by both the integrated radio spectrum and the spectral index maps discussed below .",
    "according to our present understanding of the origin and evolution of mini - haloes , their diffuse , steep - spectrum halo or bubble like morpholgy results from strong interaction of radio jets with the surrounding dense and cool gaseous medium of the cluster core . at present",
    "there are no available good x - ray data for this system and therefore we lack information about the physical state of icm in the core of cluster hosting .",
    "such data are required for quantifying accurately the energy input rate by the agn jets into the plasma bubbles of mini - halo as well as their dynamics and interaction with the icm .",
    "the x - ray luminosity is also a good indicator of the optical richness and mass of the host system .",
    "we find that the mini radio - halo   is located in an under - exposed region of _",
    "rosat all sky survey _ ( rass ) , which only allows us to determine an upper limit of @xmath391.4@xmath30 10@xmath40 erg s@xmath21 for its x - ray luminosity in 0.5  2 kev band .",
    "however , based on the mass - x - ray luminosity relation , the upper limit on the x - ray luminosity of  translates to an upper limit for the gravitational mass of its host cluster / group of about @xmath41 @xmath42 ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "this suggests that  is possibly located at the centre of a poor - cluster or a rich - group environment , which is also corroborated by the ( photographically estimated ) low galaxy density reported by @xcite for the galaxy cluster nscs  j011904 + 112133 , which hosts .",
    "this is a rather surprising result which makes  special because in general , all other known mini radio - haloes are found within x - ray bright cooling cores ( table  3 ) with x - ray luminosity @xmath43 erg s@xmath21 , and some of the most powerful systems may have luminosity @xmath010@xmath44 erg s@xmath21 .",
    "as these 100  kpc scale giant radio - emitting magnetized bubbles in   suggest their origin in intermittent agn activity , we can estimate the timescale of such outbursts from the shape of total radio spectrum and the spectral index maps .",
    "spectral index represents a powerful tool to study the properties of the relativistic electrons and the magnetic field in which they radiate , and to investigate the connection between the electron energy and the icm . from our multi - frequency radio imaging and",
    "published data , we have derived the integrated spectrum ( fig .",
    "[ rad_spectr ] ) and spatially resolved spectral index maps ( fig .",
    "[ maps_spectindx ] ) . low frequency ( @xmath0100 - 400 mhz ) spectra are important to determine the slope of electron energy distribution and preserve a record of past agn activity , while the high frequency spectra ( @xmath01 - 10 ghz ) give information on the diffusion and ageing of relativistic particles , and any particle ( re)acceleration mechanism that may be in operation .    the integrated radio spectrum between 74  mhz and 4.9  ghz frequencies shows a strong downward curvature ( fig .",
    "[ rad_spectr ] ) .",
    "piecewise linear least - squares fit shows an onset of spectral steepening beyond the critical ( also known as ` break ' ) frequency @xmath45400 mhz .",
    "the low - frequency spectral index is @xmath46 , while the high - frequency spectral index attains a slope @xmath47 .",
    "the steep spectral index of   is consistent with the mini radio - halo morphology which usually have steep radio spectrum ( @xmath48 -1 , @xcite ) .",
    "if the relativistic electrons are all injected in a single energetic outburst with a power - law energy distribution , @xmath49 ( here @xmath50 is amplitude and @xmath51 the differential number density within energy @xmath52 to @xmath53 , and @xmath54 the power law index ) , subject to strong radiation losses in synchrotron and inverse compton processes , the radio spectrum would cut - off rapidly to zero for frequencies above a critical frequency @xmath55 , which shifts to lower values with time .",
    "in contrast , if episodic injection of fresh particles , or re - acceleration of existing particles takes place in the source , only a spectral steepening by @xmath00.5 beyond the critical frequency occurs . in   beyond the critical frequency @xmath56",
    "the radio spectrum steepens due to radiative losses , but no rapid cut - off is seen ( fig .",
    "[ rad_spectr ] ) , which suggests an episodic or multiple particle injection process rather than a single energetic outburst event .",
    "the spectral age @xmath57 derived from the synchrotron radio spectrum is given by @xcite :    @xmath58    where the magnetic field b is in @xmath20 g , the critical frequency @xmath56 in ghz and @xmath59 g is the equivalent ` magnetic field ' of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) radiation at redshift z. this formula assumes isotropic pitch - angle distribution , no expansion losses and a uniform magnetic field which remained unchanged over the radiative age . for @xmath60 mhz and magnetic field range b@xmath61 @xmath20 g , the electron spectral age is @xmath62 y , which can be taken as the elapsed time since last injection of relativistic particles in the source .",
    "the largest uncertainty in estimation of spectral age is imposed by magnetic field b. presently we do not have x - ray observation of this source , but from the observed mini radio - halo morphology , it is likely that , in common with other known mini radio - haloes , would be located at the centre of a cluster cooling - core , which in general have stronger icm magnetic fields of order b@xmath63 @xmath20 g compared to non cooling - core clusters @xcite . therefore @xmath64few@xmath65 y is a more likely ( globally averaged ) radiative time - scale for .",
    "the injection of relativistic particles in the medium can take place via an episodic on - off mechanism of the radio - jets driven by the central agn ( even though no radio core or jets are visible down to @xmath01 mjy / beam level ) , or via a fermi - type shock / turbulent re - acceleration mechanism .",

    "the spectral slope of radiation emitted from different parts of the source is indicative of radiative ageing ( or lack of it ) of emitting particles .",
    "the low and high frequency spectral index maps are presented in fig .  [ maps_spectindx ] .",
    "these maps show that between 240 and 621 mhz the spectral index distribution is fairly uniform with no strong steepening or gradients across the source ( @xmath95 for south - western bubble and @xmath96 for the north - eastern bubble , which are marked in fig .",
    "[ gmrt_2 ] ) , implying a lack of strong radiative losses between these frequencies ( fig .",
    "[ maps_spectindx ] , left panel ) .",
    "however , the high frequency spectral index map between 1.4 and 4.8 ghz presents a strikingly different picture ( fig .",
    "[ maps_spectindx ] right panel ) . on this map , while the south - eastern bubble still has the same average spectral index value around -1 ( @xmath97 ) - implying a straight synchrotron spectrum between low and high radio frequencies - the north - west bubble , in contrast has developed an extremely steep spectrum ( @xmath98 ) , most likely due to strong radiative energy losses in this part of the source .",
    "such a situation might be explained if we assume that the north - western bubble showing the very steep spectrum is buoyantly rising away and then detaching itself from a centrally located mechanism of energy injection , while this source or mechanism is still active and possibly injecting relativistic particles into the relatively flatter spectrum south - eastern bubble .",
    "one possibility is agn related activity connected to a super - massive nuclear black hole , which is suggested by the large bolometric radio luminosity of  ( @xmath37 = @xmath38 w , see table  2 ) , though we fail to detect a nuclear core or active jets ( fig .  [ gmrt_1 ] ) .",
    "it is plausible that these bubbles are tracers of a previous cycle of agn activity .",
    "thus , a possible scenario is that these bubbles were inflated by the pressure of radio - jets in a previous very energetic episode of agn activity which has either stopped now or has become too feeble to be detectable . during the later stages of evolution",
    "the dynamics of the remnants of the radio - jets will be dominated by buoyancy forces and drag ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite ) , as they interact with the cluster atmosphere in the inner core region .",
    "our detection of a possibly buoyantly rising plasma bubble is also significant from theoretical point of view , as one of the most appealing and widely applied models in literature for heating of icm involves buoyant gas bubbles , inflated by agn source , that subsequently rise through the icm and heat it up ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "we further discuss the physics of these radio bubbles in the sections below .",
    "our radio observations presented above clearly show that   is a striking example of a radio - halo source consisting of twin plasma bubbles , possibly inflated in a previous episode of agn outburst from a super - massive black hole .",
    "we wish to point out that , in this respect , it closely resembles the radio emitting bubbles observed around m87 , the dominant central radio galaxy of the virgo cluster @xcite , 3c84 , the central cd in perseus cluster @xcite and 3c218 the central radio source in hydra cluster @xcite .",
    "however , as we have pointed out above , a notable major difference is that while these ( and other cluster centre radio mini - haloes , see table  3 ) exhibit the central galaxy s active nucleus ( central core ) and visible jet structure ,   in contrast is probably a quiescent source , lacking an active agn and ongoing radio - jet activity . therefore ,   is quite unusual and presents a unique opportunity to understand the dynamical evolution and impact of radio jet inflated plasma bubbles on the icm , when the central agn activity approaches cessation ( probably when the fuel supply to the smbh is exhausted ) , or when the non thermal bubbles start rising buoyantly and detaching themselves from the flow .    for a closer comparison , in fig .  [ gmrt_2 ] we show the 621 mhz radio image of   and a deep vla 90  cm image of m87 published by @xcite ( the original image has been reflected and rotated for better comparison with ) .",
    "the morphological similarity between the two radio sources is striking .",
    "@xcite found that in m87 , beyond the well known inner - jet and lobe region ( which appears as the 2  kpc scale red - orange patch near the centre of m87 , fig .",
    "[ gmrt_2 ] ) , there is diffuse outer structure extending upto @xmath040 kpc from the nucleus , which is known to host a central supermassive black hole with a mass of @xmath99 @xcite .",
    "two large scale collimated flows emerge from the inner - jet region , one directed north - eastward and the other oppositely directed to south - westward ( orientations refer to the rotated image ) .",
    "particularly intriguing is a well - defined pair of edge - brightened , ` ear - shaped ' torus - like structure at the end of south - west flow , which is reminiscent of a subsonic vortex ring .",
    "the north - eastern flow develops a gradual but well - defined s - shaped southward twist , starting only a few kiloparsecs beyond the inner lobes .",
    "finally , both flows are embedded in a giant diffuse radio structure that might be described as two overlapping ` bubbles ' , each extending about 40 kpc from the nucleus . after reaching the halo , the flows gradually disperse , particularly the north - eastward flow , and",
    "appear to be filling the entire halo with radio - loud , filamented plasma .",
    "we observe similar flow pattern in the central region of , despite the limited spatial resolution available . as shown in fig .",
    "[ gmrt_2 ] , an edge brightened torus - like ` mushroom ' structure is observed about 40  kpc west of centre of the larger south - eastern bubble , which might well be analogous to the peculiar ` ear - shaped ' vortex structure of m87 . here",
    "the flow pattern sharply turns northward and appear to be flowing into the smaller radio bubble to the north - west .",
    "we observe an s - shaped flow pattern to north - east of centre , which further bends to south , and clearly resembles the filamentary structure found in the southern bubble of m87 . in order to better visualize a possible filamentary structure of synchrotron plasma bubbles , we have digitally image processed the 621 mhz map of   with the aips task niner for a gradient filter operation , which enhances sharp intensity gradients and suppresses diffuse emission .",
    "the resulting image reveals ( fig .  [ gmrt_filter ] ) , akin to m87 , a highly complex filamentary structure of plasma embedded in the radio - halo .",
    "however , with the available angular resolution ( 6 fwmh beam size ) far less details are visible in   as compared to m87 , mainly because it is much farther away from us than m87 .",
    "of course , as mentioned above , in our radio observations of   we find no evidence for a strong agn core , inner - jets and lobe structures , which clearly are present in m87 .",
    "one feature which makes the case of especially interesting is that the inner plasma outflow structures in both these radio sources are surrounded by a pair of diffuse radio emitting ` bubble ' shaped giant lobes .",
    "we note that large misalignment seen in these two cases , between the inner outflow structure and the surrounding mini - halo may in fact be fairly common , exhibited by several other mini - haloes .",
    "examples include a2626 and the prototypical mini - halo in perseus - a @xcite .",
    "all this hints towards a common mechanism , namely the radio - jets from agn , strongly interacting with the confining environment of a cooling core , forming an amorphous mini - halo structure .    moreover , it is also interesting to note that although   closely resembles m87 in its radio morphology , at @xmath0240 kpc its total linear size is about three times larger than m87 , which spans a scale of just @xmath080 kpc ( @xcite and table  2 ) .",
    "the bolometric radio luminosity of both is about the same ; @xmath37 = @xmath38 w for   and @xmath37 = @xmath100 w for m87 @xcite .",
    "this in turn implies that the average volume emissivity of   is almost 30 times smaller than that of m87 .",
    "the similarity of large scale radio plasma outflow structures observed in and m87 suggest that both sources might have originated in , and their evolution governed by , similar physical process and conditions prevailing in the central regions of their host clusters .",
    "the origin of extremely complex diffuse radio structures observed in the outer radio bubbles of m87 and other similar radio mini - halo objects is not yet fully understood . from hydrodynamic simulation @xcite suggested that the twin bubbles in m87 are buoyant bubbles of cosmic rays and magnetic fields , inflated by jets launched during an earlier nuclear active phase of the central galaxy , which rise through the cooling gas at roughly half its sound speed . on the contrary , @xcite",
    "favor a scenario in which the radio halo of m87 is not simply a relic of previous episode of agn activity but presently it is ` alive ' , such that it is being supplied with relativistic particles coming from the central agn and the innermost radio jets .",
    "as revealed in our radio observations , non - detection of a strong agn core , inner - jets and lobe / hotspot structure in , coupled with the detection of a @xmath0100 kpc scale radio bubble of very steep spectrum north - west of the cluster centre supports the ` buoyantly - rising bubble ' model of @xcite .",
    "the flattened ` mushroom ' shape of this plasma bubble indeed resembles a rapidly rising vortex - ring ( fig .",
    "[ gmrt_2 ] ) , into which an initially spherical bubble will naturally transform due to viscosity and drag forces @xcite .",
    "the present quiescent / low state of the central engine suggests an on - off activity cycle of the super massive black hole . that such activity is intermittent and the central agn is periodically rejuvenated is suggested by the high incidence of bubbles found in cluster cores that require heating to counter balance the cooling flow @xcite , and by the train of ghost - bubbles and pressure - ripples observed in perseus and hydra clusters @xcite .",
    "also , the distant cooling core cluster rbs797 shows an inner radio - jet pair oriented perpendicular to that of the extended radio - halo structure and x - ray cavities , suggesting re - starting activity of agn @xcite .",
    "an important question raised by our observations is : what energizes the relativistic particles in the central region of which apparently counter balances the strong radiation losses and prevents severe steepening of radio spectrum ?",
    "the properties and physical processes governing the origin and evolution of radio mini - halo sources are poorly understood due to their rather small numbers known till now ( less than 10 ) . based on a sample of 5 - 6 mini haloes ,",
    "@xcite have reported a positive correlation between the radio power of mini - halo and the cooling flow radiative power . from this , and because of their estimate of the lifetimes of the radiating electrons falling considerably short of the diffusion time - scale , they have argued that in mini - haloes the cooling flow ( through the compressional work done on the icm and amplification of frozen - in magnetic field ) energizes the particle acceleration process through magneto - plasma turbulence acting on relic electron population probably left behind by the past episodes of agn activity .",
    "this suggests a direct connection between cooling flows and radio mini - haloes . with a detailed spectral fitting of the radio spectrum and emission profile with the parameters derived from the turbulent re - acceleration model",
    ", it will be possible to test the viability of this mechanism for the present source .",
    "an alternative proposal is that the radiating electrons in the mini - haloes are of secondary hadronic origin ( via the pion decay route ) , created in proton - proton ( @xmath101-@xmath102 ) collisions @xcite of high energy cosmic ray ( cr ) protons ( @xmath101 ) with target thermal protons ( @xmath102 ) .",
    "the cr protons may originate in several ways : in large - scale structure formation shock waves @xcite , or through supernovae and galactic winds from central galaxies @xcite , or via powerful agns injecting crs into the icm @xcite . a clear signature of this process is emission of @xmath103-ray photons of broad energy range @xmath104 @xmath0 100 mev - 10 tev , accompanying decay of neutral pions ( @xmath105 ) produced in inelastic proton - proton collisions .",
    "therefore , the hadronic model should be testable in near future with sensitive @xmath103-ray observations .",
    "recently , @xcite applied the hadronic cr injection model to three galaxy clusters ( hydra - a , ms 0735.6 + 7421 and hercules - a ) harboring the most energetic agn outbursts known ( with mechanical energy input of agn at least @xmath106 erg ) .",
    "they concluded that the @xmath103-ray observability of these objects is at the threshold of detectability with current ( fermi , hess ) , and near future @xmath103-ray instruments , if the observed radio bubbles are dominated by the pressure of relativistic particles .",
    "therefore , such observations are obviously of great importance for deciphering the connection between the energetic cr and thermal energy content of clusters harboring the radio - haloes .",
    "we have estimated the volume of the two radio bubbles from their projected dimensions on the gmrt 621  mhz image ( fig .",
    "[ gmrt_2 ] ; table  2 ) .",
    "the volumes are : @xmath107 @xmath108 for the spherical south - west bubble of radius @xmath109 kpc , and @xmath110 @xmath108 for the ellipsoidal north - west bubble ( we model it as an oblate spheroid with semi - major axis @xmath111 kpc and semi - minor axis @xmath112 kpc ) .",
    "the volume @xmath113 @xmath108 is the total volume occupied by relativistic particles and magnetic fields , which we assume to be mainly supplied by the radio jets and not produced in local shocks .",
    "the linear dimension of the present radio bubbles is @xmath114 100  kpc , which is much larger compared to the typical dimensions of x - ray cavities ( @xmath115 1 - 20  kpc ; @xcite ) , and they are comparable to the @xmath0100  200 kpc size super cavities found in ms0735.6 + 7421 and hydra clusters ( @xcite ) .",
    "the large radio luminosity and linear size of the radio bubbles in suggest that radio jets from agn must have done large amount of mechanical work ( @xmath116 ) in inflating them against the external pressure of thermal icm gas , as well as injected enormous non - thermal plasma energy ( magnetic field and relativistic particles ) , which has remained stored inside the bubbles , as they rose buoyantly under pressure equilibrium with the external medium .",
    "future x - ray observations of   would reveal if the relativistic fluid filling these bubbles has pushed aside the thermal gas , excavating giant cavities in the x - ray emitting icm .",
    "we have detected a buoyantly rising radio bubble @xmath0 100  kpc from the centre of radio - halo ( fig .",

    ", we estimated the total enthalpy ( free energy ) of bubbles in , @xmath173 erg and the mechanical luminosity of radio jets which inflated them , to be @xmath174 erg s@xmath21 . energy input from a central agn into the cluster atmosphere at this rate is sufficient to heat it up , drive a massive outflow from the agn , which may counter balance a possible cooling loss , and may even halt ( or reduce drastically ) the accretion flow of matter onto the supemassive black hole , thus cutting off the fuel supply powering the central engine and completing the feedback loop .",
    "this agn mediated feedback process in , could explain its relaxed , quiescent looking appearance . if confirmed with future x - ray observations , such large enthalpy of the bubble system in   and its possible agn - feedback cycle would make it host one of the most energetic radio outbursts known , comparable to the energetics of the super cavities in ms0735.6 + 7421 and hydra clusters .",

    "<S> the extremely steep high - frequency radio spectrum of the north - western bubble , located @xmath0100 kpc from cluster centre , indicates radiation losses , possibly because having detached , it is rising buoyantly and moving away into the putative hot intra - cluster medium . </S>",
