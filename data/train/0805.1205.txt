    "star formation in galaxies occurs in two modes  `` quiescent '' , in which stars form at a relatively modest rate over a long period of time across the entire galaxy disk , and `` starburst '' , in which gas is turned into stars extremely rapidly , confined to compact regions of the galaxy , often its circumnuclear volume @xcite .",
    "starbursts are often triggered by external dynamical disturbances such as galaxy mergers .",
    "the dust heating associated with these intense bursts of star formation within giant molecular clouds can produce hugely increased ir luminosity and conditions favorable for maser emission .",
    "the strong 18-cm oh megamaser emission in some of these galaxies is many orders of magnitude more luminous than its counterparts in our galaxy @xcite .",
    "ultra luminous infrared galaxies ( ulirgs ) are thought to be systems where all of these processes are occurring simultaneously @xcite .",
    "the existence of obscured agns in these objects are also considered as an alternative ( or additional ) energy source where these are fueled by molecular gas falling into the central regions of the merging systems @xcite .",
    "molecular gas is thus one of the most important constituents of the ism and plays a critical role in the evolution of galaxies .    to date",
    ", over 140  molecules have been identified in space , mostly in the ism of our milky way galaxy .",
    "some of these are rather complex , containing as many as 8  to 13  atoms .",
    "interstellar organic molecules are thought to form mostly on the surface of dust grains .",
    "heating events , such as the formation of a protostar , release the icy grain mantles into the gas phase @xcite .",
    "once released , these molecules may form amino acids by the combination of organic species known as `` pre - biotic '' molecules @xcite .",
    "( we note that non - gas phase reaction pathways for the formation of extraterrestrial amino acids have been described in * ? ? ?",
    "methanimine is one such molecule ( ch@xmath0nh ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) which can form the simplest amino acid , glycine ( nh@xmath0ch@xmath0cooh ) , either by ( i ) first combining with hydrogen cyanide ( hcn ) to form aminoacetonitrile ( nh@xmath0ch@xmath0cn ) , with subsequent hydrolysis , or ( ii ) directly combining with formic acid ( hcooh ) @xcite .",
    "methanimine has been previously detected in the interstellar medium of our own galaxy @xcite and tentatively in the nearby galaxy , ngc  253 @xcite , but never beyond the neighborhood of our galaxy ( i.e. beyond @xmath45  mpc ) .    the majority of interstellar molecules ( both galactic and extragalactic ) have been discovered at millimetric wavelengths , as molecules with small moments of inertia are the most abundant cosmically , with their rotational lines occurring at mm or shorter wavelengths .",
    "however , although less abundant , many complex molecules have spectral lines in the radio regime for @xmath5  cm , where `` line confusion '' does not set a limit to their detectability .",
    "many transitions of small polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( pahs ) , pre - biotic molecules , and even a number of transitions of the simplest amino acid , glycine , fall within the relatively unexplored spectral range between 1  and 10  ghz .",
    "in addition , observations in this frequency range are complementary to mm spectral - line surveys which probe colder , lower density gas .    at arecibo",
    ", we are conducting a spectral line census of arp  220 between 1.1  and 10  ghz , for which the initial observations took place between 31 march and 22 april , 2007 .",
    "it is planned that the remaining observations will be made in 2008 . here",
    "we report the discovery of methanimine emission in this galaxy , plus the detection of three @xmath1 direct l - type absorption lines of hcn @xcite from the j=4 , 5 and 6 vibrational levels .",
    "also reported is the possible detection of another pre - biotic molecule , formic acid , albeit not unambiguously due to the presence of a nearby @xmath2oh line .",
    "in addition , we present the first detections of two , possibly three , @xmath34-cm transitions of the oh radical in absorption , high signal - to - noise ratio detections of the @xmath36- and 5-cm transitions of oh , and the possible detection of the 6.7-ghz methanol ( ch@xmath6oh ) transition in absorption .",
    "at a distance of @xmath477mpc ( redshift , z=0.018126 ) , arp  220 is the nearest ultra - luminous infra - red galaxy .",
    "much of its ir luminosity arises from a powerful , dust - enshrouded starburst , triggered by the merger of two gas - rich galaxies @xcite .",
    "evidence for this is provided by high resolution optical and radio images revealing a double nucleus with tidal tails and dust lanes .",
    "a high supernova rate has been found from recent high resolution vlbi studies @xcite .",
    "molecules such as the oh radical @xcite , co @xcite , formaldehyde @xcite , ammonia @xcite , and mm - transitions of hcn @xcite have been detected in arp  220 .",
    "in fact , @xcite have recently used high resolution imaging of the co(21 ) line and the @xmath31.3  mm dust radiation to provide strong evidence for the existence of a `` buried '' agn in the western nucleus of the galaxy , a conclusion heavily affecting interpretation of the situation within arp  220 .",
    "arp  220 is also known as the prototype oh megamaser galaxy .",
    "its oh @xmath318-cm maser emission was first reported by @xcite .",
    "high - resolution maps of the oh maser revealed complex structures which could be interpreted either as a dual - component distribution @xcite or , by clumpy unsaturated masers within a single - component medium @xcite .",
    "using several of the complement of receivers on the arecibo 305-m telescope , we are in the process of making an almost - complete spectral scan of arp  220 between 1.1  and 10  ghz . to do this , we have employed the wapp ( wideband arecibo pulsar processor ) spectrometer in its recently - commissioned  dual - board \" mode . in this mode , eight independent boards , each of 100-mhz bandwidth with 3-level quantization ,",
    "can be used to cover a spectral band of up to 800  mhz at a single time .",
    "compared to the earlier wapp capacity , this doubles the total bandwidth covered .",
    "the present project serves both for the scientific commissioning of this new option , and as a demonstration of its capabilities .    in practice ,",
    "we have overlapped the eight boards for each observation such that their centers are separated by 85  mhz .",
    "as the final 5-or - so mhz are affected by filter roll - off , this allows high quality data to be acquired for an instantaneous bandwidth of 680  mhz , meaning that those arecibo receivers which have total bandwidths of 2  ghz can be fully covered via three separate frequency settings .",
    "the basic spectral resolution is 24.4  khz , and both orthogonal polarizations of the celestial signal are recorded .",
    "the observations are being made via a modified version of the double position switching ( dps ) technique @xcite .",
    "an on / off position - switched observation with 5-min component phases is made on arp  220 , followed by an on / off with 1-min phases on the strong , angularly - nearby , continuum source , j1531 + 2402 , which is used as a band - pass calibrator . in the presence of band - pass ripples or trapped - modes in the orthomode transducer of the feed ,",
    "this strategy is necessary at all frequencies to produce acceptable spectral baselines .",
    "in addition , apparent features observed in the data can often be recognized as astronomical , and not due to the presence of radio frequency interference ( rfi ) , via a comparison of the spectra for arp  220 and j1531 + 2402 .",
    "data for a total on - source observing time of about 60  min for arp  220 will eventually be acquired for each frequency setting .",
    "data reduction has been performed using the arecibo idl analysis package written by phil perillat .",
    "the individual on / off scans on arp  220 were processed to yield ( on - off)/off spectra , and these were `` bandpass corrected '' using similar spectra for j1531 + 2402 .",
    "each individual arp  220 and j1531 + 2402 scan was inspected for quality , and all rfi present was noted .",
    "a number of scans were rejected either due to technical problems or because of excessive rfi .",
    "all acceptable scans for a particular frequency setting were then co - added to produce the final spectra .",
    "these spectra were smoothed in frequency to a number of resolutions , and the resultant spectra inspected visually to identify the presence of possible emission or absorption lines .",
    "considerable cross - checking was performed to ensure that candidate lines were real , and not the effect of rfi or equipment problems .",
    "a complete cm - wavelength line census for arp  220 , and its full implications for the physical and chemical properties of the interstellar medium of this galaxy , are deferred until completion of the observations . here",
    "we present the detection of methanimine in emission , and of the @xmath1 direct l - type transitions of hcn , excited - oh transitions , a line that could be either @xmath2oh or hcooh , and possibly methanol in absorption for this prototypical nearby ulirg .",

    "[ f1]b is for the transition expected to be the strongest in the methanimine multiplet , that at a rest frequency of 5289.813  mhz @xcite .",
    "the total velocity width ( fwhm ) of this emission line is 270  kms@xmath7 ; we note that a large velocity width is observed for almost all molecular spectra in arp  220 . using the angular size of @xmath11 measured for the strongest component of the formaldehyde ( h@xmath0co ) emission @xcite as an upper limit for the angular size of the methanimine emission region ,",
    "we derive a lower limit to the brightness temperature of @xmath42800  k. taking into account the six lines in the multiplet and their relative intensities , we calculate a reduced value of this lower limit to be @xmath41000  k for the strongest component .",
    "this is similar to the methanimine decomposition temperature of 1300  k @xcite .",
    "if the solid angle of the emission is smaller than the above , for instance if the emission comes from a number of very compact components , then the brightness temperature could be much higher .",
    "we conclude that , as for formaldehyde @xcite , methanimine in arp  220 is likely to be showing weak maser emission for this transition . we have been awarded time with the merlin array to observe this source at higher spatial resolution in order to determine the brightness temperature more accurately and to discover",

    "[ hcn - engdia ] shows the energy diagram for the @xmath12=1 direct l - type transitions of hydrogen cyanide ( hcn ) in the j=1 to j=6 vibrational levels .",
    "our spectra of the j=2 , 4 , 5 and 6 hcn transitions are presented in fig .",
    "the j=4 , 5 and 6 transitions are detected in absorption against the continuum emission of arp  220 , and we place an upper limit at the 3-@xmath13 level of 0.0025 for the optical depth of the j=2 line .",
    "the first detailed study of this type of hcn transition was carried out for the galactic proto - planetary nebula , crl618 , by @xcite .",
    "these observers detected a number of the higher vibrational levels in this hcn ladder ( j=814 ) .",
    "however we note that the lower energy transitions presented here seem not to have been previously detected in any celestial source .",
    "we also note that these lines represent a high excitation energy above the hcn ground state , ( e.g. 1067  k for the j=4 line . )",
    "hcn is a well known indicator of high gas density .",
    "@xcite demonstrated that a very strong linear correlation exists between the luminosities l@xmath14 and l@xmath15 for mm - wave transitions of hcn , extending over a wide range of l@xmath14 from normal galaxies to ulirgs .",
    "they found the similar l@xmath14 ",
    "l@xmath16 correlation to have a less linear form , marking out l@xmath17 as the best tracer of dense molecular gas mass in galaxies , and hence of active star - formation . however , @xcite present evidence that l@xmath14/l@xmath15 is systematically higher in ( u)lirgs than in normal star forming galaxies .",
    "the relative line integrals from the j=4 and 6 lines suggest an approximate excitation temperature of @xmath18  k. these transitions represent high excitation , and given the complicated scenarios now emerging for the central region of arp  220 , it would be of great interest to ascertain the precise circumstances in which these absorptions arise . unlike the relatively `` smooth '' line profiles seen for the excited - oh lines ( e.g.  fig .",
    "[ f3 ] ) , the hcn lines each show evidence for the presence of a number of discrete components .",
    "in fact , the central , strongest hcn component becomes increasingly dominant from j=4 to 6 .",
    "the absence of the j=2 line requires explanation , as the predicted absorption line is expected to be an order of magnitude stronger than the 3-@xmath13 limit we place above .",
    "it is highly improbable that the fraction of the continuum emission `` covered '' by the clouds producing the hcn absorption could have decreased by such a large amount between 4488 and 1347  mhz that the j=2 line is rendered unobservable .",
    "much more likely is that free - free absorption in the foreground ionized screen of this starburst galaxy is greatly attenuating the j=2 line . for this to be the case , an opacity of @xmath19 at 1347  mhz ( in the rest frame of arp  220 ) would be required .",
    "this would imply an optical depth of @xmath20 at 1630  mhz in the galaxy , as found for the spectra of a number of the snrs near the twin nuclei of arp  220 by @xcite .",
    "these authors attributed this high opacity to the combined presence of `` a patchy ffa [ free - free absorption ] ism with a median opacity of less than 1 '' , plus absorption in the regions of ionized circumstellar mass - loss envelopes surrounding the sn progenitors .",
    "the hcn lines we see are expected to arise from star - forming regions of high gas density , and a detailed study of all possible lines in the @xmath1 direct l - type transitions of the hcn ladder would provide useful evidence concerning the properties of the foreground gas screen to these regions .",
    "clearly , the spectrum of the hcn j=3 line ( with a rest frequency of 2693.3  mhz ) will be crucial to such a study , and we will be observing this line during our 2008 campaign to complete the present observations . it should be noted that for the implied optical depths at 1347  mhz , even the j=4 line will be reduced through ffa by @xmath21  20% , which would reduce the above derived excitation temperature to @xmath4120  k.      the energy levels for the various oh transitions are shown in fig .",

    "the relevant quantum numbers , rest frequencies and other measured line parameters are presented in table  2 .",
    "the @xmath36- and 5-cm lines have been previously detected by @xcite and @xcite respectively .",
    "contrary to the findings of @xcite , we find that the 4660- , 4751- & 4766-mhz lines have intensity ratios closely in agreement with their expected local thermodynamic equilibrium ( lte ) values of 1:2:1 .",
    "the @xmath35-cm main lines presented here have considerably higher signal - to - noise ratio than the measurements of @xcite but show similar form .",
    "the expected lte intensity ratios for the 6017- , 6031- , 6035- & 6049-mhz lines are 1:14:20:1 .",
    "however , we measure ratios of 1:13:13:@xmath230.4 .",
    "the two main lines of the @xmath35-cm transition ( 6031  and 6035  mhz ) are blended due to their large velocity widths and give the appearance of being `` saturated '' , as suggested by their similar optical depths .",
    "this may be due to their having high optical depths , resulting in saturation of the lines against a continuum component containing of order 10% of the total flux density of arp  220 .",
    "however , we note that there is a low - velocity component to ( presumably ) the 6031-mhz absorption line , seen in fig .  6 at 6026  mhz , which if also present for the 6035-mhz line would contribute significantly at the frequency of the 6031-mhz line .",
    "the satellite lines are seen at much lower signal - to - noise level .",
    "however , the greater strength of the 6017-mhz line relative to that at 6049  mhz is interesting .",
    "a similar effect was also found by @xcite for four compact hii regions in our own galaxy . while they saw the 6017-mhz lines enhanced above the lte ratio to the main lines , the 6049-mhz line was weaker than predicted , and",
    "may even sometimes have appeared in weak emission .",
    "the two @xmath34-cm oh lines at 7761  and 7820  mhz ( fig .",
    "[ f5 ] ) are detected for the first time in arp  220 , and show similar velocity widths to most other molecular species in the galaxy .",
    "the expected ratio for these @xmath24 main lines ( 7761:7820  mhz ) is 1:1.8 in thermal equilibrium , very close to the derived ratio of the peak and integrated brightnesses for the lines of 1:1.89 ( see table  2 ) .",
    "the satellite lines in this multiplet are expected to be present only at the 1-@xmath13 level , and indeed are not detected .",
    "considering the absorption lines in the @xmath25 ladder of fig .",
    "[ oh_energy_diag ] at 4750  and 7820  mhz , in thermal equilibrium the ratio of their integrated optical depths would imply an excitation temperature of about 88  k. in a detailed large velocity gradient ( lvg ) study of their co observations , @xcite find that in arp  220 , the spectra of low density tracers such as co ( and oh ) can only be fitted with a two - phase molecular ism with the kinetic temperature of one being @xmath26  k , while their mm - wave spectra for the high - density tracer molecules , hcn and cs , indicate kinetic temperatures of @xmath450 - 70  k.    a very tentative detection of the @xmath27 22 line of oh at 8135  mhz is shown in fig .  [ f6 ] .",
    "if confirmed by the addition of the remaining data to be acquired in this project , this would be at least twice as strong as expected for an excitation temperature of 88  k. further , this line is expected to be only 0.7 times as strong as for the other @xmath28 main line at 8189  mhz . while the 8189  mhz line is also possibly detected , contrary to expectations this would be at an even lower signal - to - noise level than for the 8135  mhz transition .      in fig .",
    "[ f7 ] , we present a high signal - to - noise detection of an absorption line from our l - band spectrum . despite the presence of nearby rfi caused by glonass emissions ( at @xmath41605  mhz ) , the reality of this absorption line has been verified by its presence with similar optical depth in each of 13 individual spectra of arp  220 , but in none of the spectra of the bandpass calibrator . as demonstrated by the horizontal lines in fig .",
    "[ f7 ] , there is an ambiguity as to the species responsible for this absorption , which could be either the 1639.5-mhz main line of @xmath2oh or the 1638.8-mhz line of formic acid ( hcooh ) .",
    "given the prevalence of oh in arp  220 , it would perhaps not be unreasonable to detect the presence of @xmath2oh as well .",
    "however , since formic acid is relevant to the chemical origin of life , it would be most interesting to resolve this ambiguity .    as is seen in fig .",
    "[ f7 ] , as well as the strong absorption line detected near 1611  mhz , an apparently weaker absorption is also seen near 1609  mhz , close to where the second , 1637.6-mhz , main line of @xmath2oh should be found .",
    "if this feature were indeed to be real , the ratio of the peak intensity of the higher frequency absorption to this would be 3.1:1 .",
    "this is higher than the expected ratio of 1.8:1 were the pair to be the main lines of @xmath2oh @xcite and in local thermal equilibrium .",
    "the frequencies of the peak depths of the two features are separated by an amount that would correspond to a rest frequency separation of about 2.05  mhz were they both to be due to absorption in arp  220 .",
    "the laboratory separation of the @xmath2oh main lines is @xmath30  mhz @xcite , and hence given the weakness of the feature near 1609  mhz , the agreement is considered to be satisfactory .",
    "if the absorption near 1611  mhz is indeed the higher frequency component of the @xmath2oh main lines , then its radial velocity is closer to that of the peak velocity found for other molecules in arp  220 than would be the case were the detection to be of formic acid ( see table  2 and the horizontal bars displayed in fig .",

    "in addition , its width of about 190  kms@xmath7 is narrower than for any other species that we detect . were this absorbing gas to represent @xmath2oh , we note that a velocity of 5265  kms@xmath7 is `` allowed '' in arp  220 from the hi absorption study of @xcite",
    ". however , a peak velocity of 5135  kms@xmath7 , appropriate for the formic acid transition , has little associated hi absorption .",
    "nevertheless , if the absorption were to be due to @xmath2oh at 5265  kms@xmath7 this would imply a remarkably high isotopic ratio of @xmath2oh:@xmath31oh for a cloud at this velocity , especially so as this is well away from the peak velocity range of the oh megamaser line as seen at low angular resolution @xcite .",
    "given the proximity of the glonass rfi , it is difficult to establish the origins of this absorption feature .",
    "however , @xmath2oh would seem a more likely identification than formic acid .",
    "confirmation of the reality of the second , weaker , absorption component near 1609  mhz would effectively establish this identification .",
    "the possibility that the feature represents absorption in our galaxy from the 1612.231  mhz satellite oh line has to be very small given the high galactic latitude of the line - of - sight ( @xmath32 ) , the implied large radial velocity ( @xmath4 + 185  kms@xmath7 ) , and large line width ( @xmath4190  kms@xmath7 ) .      in fig .",

    "although this line is apparently detected with a signal - to - noise ratio of almost 6:1 , and the entire 100-mhz band in which it is observed is basically rfi - free , the quality of the baseline in this case is rather poor .",
    "we await our remaining observations for confirming the reality of this line .",
    "we note that while the excited - oh absorption line at 7761.7  mhz ( fig .",
    "[ f5 ] : upper ) has a somewhat lower signal - to - noise ratio than this possible methanol detection , the combination of a better overall baseline , and the 10.5-@xmath13 level detection of the associated line at 7820.1 mhz ( fig .",
    "[ f5 ] : lower ) yielding the expected lte intensity ratio ( see section  [ oh_lines ] ) , makes for a more solid detection in that case .",
    "we can certainly conclude that at the 1  mjy level ( 5@xmath13 ) no methanol maser emission , such as is commonly detected for this transition from regions of massive - star formation in our own galaxy , is seen in arp  220 .    assuming the reality of the methanol absorption line , an excitation temperature for the transition of t@xmath36k , and an einstein coefficient of @xmath37  s@xmath7 @xcite , and a covering factor of unity , in lte the column density of the lower energy level , @xmath38 is ;    @xmath39    where the integral @xmath40 is expressed in units of kms@xmath7 .",

    "the discovery of high abundances of `` pre - biotic '' molecules , such as methanimine , hcn and possibly formic acid in arp  220 raises the possibility that other ulirgs might contain similarly high abundances of such molecules , which could be detectable with the arecibo 305-m telescope .",

    "<S> an on - going arecibo line search between 1.1  and 10  ghz of the prototypical starburst / megamaser galaxy , arp  220 , has revealed a spectrum rich in molecular transitions . </S>",
    "<S> these include the `` pre - biotic '' molecules : methanimine ( ch@xmath0nh ) in emission , three @xmath1 direct l - type absorption lines of hcn , and an absorption feature likely to be from either @xmath2oh or formic acid ( hcooh ) . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , we report the detection of two , possibly three , transitions of @xmath34-cm excited oh not previously detected in arp  220 which are seen in absorption , and a possible absorption feature from the 6.668-ghz line of methanol . </S>",
    "<S> this marks the first distant extragalactic detection of methanimine , a pre - biotic molecule . </S>",
    "<S> also , if confirmed , the possible methanol absorption line presented here would represent the first extragalactic detection of methanol at a distance further than 10  mpc . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , the strong , previously undetected , cm - wave hcn @xmath1 direct l - type lines will aid the study of dense molecular gas and active star - forming regions in this starburst galaxy . </S>"
