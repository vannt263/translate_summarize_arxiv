    "the high slope lines on the left panels indicate the uncompensated @xmath162 data .",
    "data obtained by numerical reflection , if only a half of the hysteresis cycle has been measured , are shown by open symbols.,width=340 ]    additionally , any experimental flaws , short - cut procedures or negligences in the sample handling have severe adverse effects on the reliability of the final results , as they get strongly magnified by the high degree of compensation analysis required to determine the signal from these layers . to preserve the credibility of the measurement , tight constrains on the whole measurement process",
    "are imposed and can be generalized as : contamination - free handling of the samples , magnetically - clean mounting in the squid magnetometer , and credibility in the determination of the magnetic moment by the magnetometer software .",
    "we perform all the manual operations , including the sample mounting on the magnetometer sample holder , in a laminar flow cabinet equipped with an absolute filter .",
    "also , we avoid to bring the samples into contact with any ferrous materials , including metal tweezers,@xcite since ( stainless ) steel tweezers are a well recognized source of contamination@xcite of , @xmath163 , silicon wafers and their magnetic signature can be comparable with the magnetic response expected in our studies.@xcite however , contrary to si , where the contamination can occur either by contact chemical reaction or by mechanical scratching , we believe that in our case mostly a mechanical grinding of the softer metal by the much harder sapphire / gan is the major source of magnetic contamination . therefore , we employ only titanium-/plastic - based tweezers .",
    "another potential source of specimen contamination is related to the dicing of the sapphire wafer , as it requires a diamond saw . for the preparation of our samples",
    ", we employ only plastic - based cutting wheels on the wafer coated with photoresist for additional protection . after dicing ,",
    "the samples are rinsed with organic solvents in an ultrasonic cleaner .",
    "we verified that none of these substances carries any detectable amounts of ferrous metals .      in the present study",
    "we utilize a home - made squid magnetometer built into a standard cryostat operating from 5 to 325  k in continuous flow mode .",
    "although equipped with a 1  t superconducting coil , the set - up has been optimized for very weak field operation and the noise level , increasing with the field , limits our experimental abilities to @xmath164  t. we use a commercially available squid sensor and the matched electronics , connected to a computer based acquisition system running under an home developed code .",
    "the sensing end of the set - up , like most modern similar systems , utilizes the controlled tripping of the sample ( with the sample holder ) through sensing coils arranged in the 2nd order gradiometer configuration . ideally , only the sample to be measured produces the signal .",
    "its position - related voltages generated by the squid electronics during this movement form the base for the numerical procedures necessary for extraction of the magnetic moment . in general , a gradiometer configuration allows the use of any uniform extended object ",
    "rod - like shaped  as a sample holder , since if its length is much larger than the extent of the pick - up coils , the sample holder produces no output according to symmetry considerations . in reality",
    ", the limited length of the sample chamber does not allow sufficiently long sample holders , resulting in a non - linear position - dependent voltage disturbing the signal from the sample , particularly in the most sensitive ranges .",
    "this parasitic contribution can be largely reduced by employing magnetically weak substances , preferably diamagnets , shaped in the form of small tubes or rods .",
    "nothing , however , will compensate for the shape variations and for the distribution of inhomogeneous magnetic impurity inside the rod material .",
    "the former result from all sort of mechanical imperfections ( e.g. variable cross section area , scratches , etc . )",
    ", the latter may be an inherent property of the chosen material .",
    "both generate position - dependent voltages that modulate or distort the signal from the sample in an unknown and a - priori unpredictable @xmath165- and @xmath166- dependent way , corrupting , in this way , the results of the measurements in an unrecoverable way .",
    "therefore , the testing of the sample holder and the selection against the parasitic magnetic signal turns out to be of a great importance for this study .    currently , the most popular choice for magnetometer sample holders are drinking straws , not only because of their low magnetic signature , but also due to the flexibility allowed in a glue - free mounting of samples with dimensions comparable with the diameter of the straw .",
    "for the purposes of our studies , we have undertaken an accurate testing of the available materials , focusing in particular on those directly provided by quantum design.@xcite some 30 straws were scanned along their length at 3000 , 1000  oe , and at remanence , usually at low @xmath165 ( 10  k ) , and occasionally at 200  k. all tested straws have been thoroughly cleaned in organic solvent prior to the tests . the collected position dependent signals are processed according to the same numerical steps employed to establish the magnetic moment in the magnetometer , so that the spatial distribution of the magnetic moment along the straws could be established .",
    "we have found that although on average the straws have a small magnetic signature suitable for general magnetic investigations ( exhibiting moment variations below @xmath16710@xmath168 emu on a one inch span near their central part ) , only two went below @xmath16910@xmath170 emu , reaching in this way the upper limit required for our studies . instead of using potentially problematic straws , we opted for @xmath143  20  cm long and 1 or 2  mm wide si strips cut from 8 \" commercial wafers.@xcite after a thorough testing , we have found that all the strips conform to our stringent requirements concerning the magnetic uniformity .",
    "additionally , the si strips ensure an excellent rigidity and allow for an easy sample mounting in various in - plane orientations .",
    "the major drawback of switching to si strips is the necessity of using a glue to fix the sample onto the strip . after testing many substances for a possible contribution to the measurement as well as for mechanical reliability and low temperature behavior we settled for the heavily diluted ge varnish , which best fulfills all requirements .",
    "we found that only the recently available orange version,@xcite as opposed to the dark red one , shows no magnetic signature down to 5  k and up to 3000  oe even when examining @xmath14310 times the amount normally needed for mounting .",
    "it must be noted , that the usage of narrow strips may lead to larger sample off centering than in the case of wider straws . in our case however , owing to the relatively large diameter of our pick - up coils we determined this effect to be below 0.5%,@xcite i.e. within the typical run - to - run non - reproducibility of our system .",
    "typically the investigated magnetic moment is established by a numerical fitting ( least square regression ) of an ideal , point dipole response function of the gradiometer pickup coils into the set of voltages collected during the tripping of the sample through the coils . in the case of",
    "macroscopically large samples of rectangular shape the form of the real response function starts to differ noticeably if the specimens occupy more than a few percent of the volume of the pickup coils.@xcite as a consequence , even the best possible fitting routine will not establish the accurate sample moment , unless the response function gets adequately modified .",
    "it is relatively easy to extend the point dipole response function to account for uniformly magnetized body of a given length@xcite and this length parameterized function is routinely used in our system to extract a length - independent magnetic moment .",
    "this however seems to be the only one feasible to compensate sample size effects .",
    "the account of other detrimental effects like non uniform sample extension in the plane perpendicular to the magnetometer axis or displacement of the whole sample aside from the axis is too complex to get generalized in any sort of universally parameterized function .",
    "so , in order to minimize their adverse influence on the experimental results , we confined ourselves to one sample size for magnetic measurement and additional care is taken to mount the samples on si sticks in a reproducible way . for completeness",
    ", we note that from the results of numerical modelling@xcite a maximum 1% of moment distortion is expected for the samples used in the experiment .",
    "therefore , we can safely conclude that although potentially large , the sample - size - related effects should not systematically alter the magnetometer results before and after the compensation ."
