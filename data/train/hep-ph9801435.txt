    "one of the ultimate goals in investigating central heavy - ion collisions at very high energies is to analyze the properties of highly excited and deconfined matter .",
    "direct probes , like electromagnetic signals @xcite , are considered as useful carriers of nearly undisturbed information from the transient hot reaction stages .",
    "pairs of electrons and muons are experimentally accessible , and will be measured also in forthcoming heavy - ion experiments @xcite . these types of probes have proven useful at super proton synchrotron ( sps ) energies at cern in the resonance region below the @xmath1 , @xmath2 @xcite , and in the @xmath3 region @xcite ; also in the so - called continuum region in between a yet unexplained excess seems to be found @xcite .",
    "however , recent estimates @xcite of dileptons stemming from semileptonic decays of open charm and bottom mesons produced in the same central collisions of heavy ions show that these represent the dominating dilepton source at energies envisaged at the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) in brookhaven and at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) in cern . in particular , the dilepton signal from thermalized , strongly interacting matter in the intermediate reaction stages is estimated to be up to two orders of magnitude below the background of correlated decays of open charm or bottom meson pairs in a wide invariant mass region .",
    "even strong energy loss effects of the heavy quarks in the hot and dense medium @xcite do not basically change this situation : the decay dileptons might be suppressed down to the drell - yan background , but it is questionable whether such strong energy loss effects can happen in reality @xcite . in this situation at least two issues can be seen .",
    "first , it is necessary to extend the traditional strategy for searching a thermal dilepton signal from deconfined matter .",
    "the usual approach relies on the analysis of the invariant mass ( @xmath4 ) spectra .",
    "one can expect , however , that the double differential dilepton spectrum as a function of the transverse pair momentum @xmath5 and transverse pair mass @xmath6 contains much more information which can be used to impose special kinematical gates for finding a window to observe the thermal dileptons in the continuum region in spite of the large decay background .",
    "second , one can try to employ the initial hard production of open charm and bottom followed by semileptonic decays to probe deconfined matter by energy loss effects .",
    "a similar idea for hard jet production is widely under discussion now @xcite .    in the present paper we focus on both of the above issues .",
    "we compare the so - called @xmath0 scaling property of the dielectrons stemming from deconfined matter with pairs resulting from correlated open charm and bottom decays . as well - known , under certain conditions the dilepton yield from a thermalized quark - gluon plasma depends only on the transverse mass , i.e. , there is no dependence on the variable @xmath5 at fixed @xmath0 in a given rapidity interval @xmath7 . at the same time the corresponding @xmath5 dependence of dileptons from heavy quark decays has qualitatively a different behavior : it is peaked at small values of @xmath5 and drops rapidly at increasing values of the transverse momentum . to get realistic estimates of the @xmath0 scaling we perform monte carlo simulations for both the correlated heavy quark decays and the thermal production including the acceptance of the detectors phenix at rhic and alice at lhc . to strengthen the @xmath0 scaling violation for dileptons from decays we select only such leptons with individual transverse momentum @xmath8 with appropriate value of @xmath9 .",
    "we find that , while the thermal dilepton yield from the plasma is less affected by the kinematical restriction , the contributions from decays at large transverse pair momentum is reduced drastically . actually this leads to a threshold like behavior of the transverse momentum spectrum at fixed value of @xmath0 for dileptons from heavy quark decays in contrast to the approximate plateau of the thermal yield which extends up to the kinematical limit at @xmath10 . as a result ,",
    "an opportunity is found which allows to separate the thermal dilepton signal from the background of heavy quark decays on the basis of the @xmath0 scaling property .",
    "we also study to what extent the single electron and dilepton spectra are modified by the energy loss effects of heavy quarks when traversing deconfined matter . in doing",
    "so we concentrate on calculable processes in the first few fm / c of the collision course .",
    "there are , of course , other processes in the later reaction stages that might considerably affect the momenta of the charm and bottom mesons @xcite , and also thermal radiation of semihard probes can stem from later stages .",
    "for instance , in ref .",
    "@xcite the hypothesis has been formulated , resting on an analysis of present pb + pb data at sps energy , that all hadron spectra can be parametrized by a common flow velocity and freeze - out temperature .",
    "this , if correct for higher energies too , would imply that charm and bottom spectra are much stronger modified than assumed in the following , and as a consequence the chances to identify a thermal dilepton source would be better .    our paper is organized as follows . in section 2 we present our calculation procedure of charm and bottom spectra and the resulting single electron and dielectron spectra .",
    "section 3 is devoted to the thermal dileptons at midrapidity and the @xmath0 scaling properties .",
    "our conclusions can be found in section 4 .",
    "in our approach we utilize the leading order qcd processes @xmath11 and @xmath12 for heavy quark - antiquark ( @xmath13 ) production and simulate higher order corrections by an appropriate @xmath14 factor .",
    "we have checked that such a procedure reproduces within the needed accuracy the more involved next - to - leading order calculations @xcite .",
    "the number of @xmath13 pairs , produced initially with transverse momenta @xmath15 at rapidities @xmath16 in central @xmath17 collisions can be calculated by @xmath18 \\frac{d \\hat \\sigma_q^q}{d \\hat t } \\right\\},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath19 are elementary cross sections ( see for details @xcite ) , @xmath20 with @xmath21 denote the parton structure functions , @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "as heavy quark masses we take @xmath24 1.5 gev and @xmath25 4.5 gev .",
    "we employ the hera supported structure function set mrs d- @xcite from the pdflib at cern .",
    "nuclear shadowing effects are not included since they will be considered separately .",
    "in addition , for our present goals we expect no significant modification by shadowing in the large transverse momentum region according to results of ref .",
    "the overlap function for central collisions is @xmath26 with @xmath27 fm and @xmath28 . from a comparison with results of ref .",
    "@xcite we find the scale @xmath29 and @xmath30 2 as most appropriate .",
    "energy loss effects ( cf . @xcite and further references therein ) have been found important @xcite since the momenta of back - to - back moving heavy quarks are degraded and the resulting dileptons in correlated semileptonic decays get less invariant mass .",
    "this process causes a considerable reduction of the number of high invariant mass dileptons from correlated @xmath31 and @xmath32 decays .    to model the energy loss effects of heavy quarks in expanding matter we assume that a heavy quark has the same rapidity as the longitudinal flow at the space - time point of the initial quark production .",
    "therefore , with respect to the fluid s local rest frame the heavy quark has essentially only a transverse momentum @xmath33 which may depend on the proper local time @xmath34 in accordance with the energy loss @xmath35 in transverse direction .",
    "this picture implies a very fast thermalization of gluons and light quarks .",
    "unfortunately a sufficiently general treatment of the energy loss rate @xmath35 for heavy quarks passing through expanding qcd matter has not been developed so far .",
    "recently the total energy loss of a high - energy parton propagating transversely through expanding deconfined matter has been derived as @xmath36 @xcite , supposed the medium cools according to a power law and the initial time is short .",
    "the numerical factor @xmath37 is @xmath38 for a parton created inside the medium .",
    "within such a scenario the stopping power depends only on the final temperature at which the deconfined medium is left , as indicated by the subscript @xmath39 . we denote this stopping scenario as model i and take @xmath40 from @xcite .",
    "this model is appropriate for lhc conditions , where the initial temperature is very high and where the life time of deconfined matter is large enough that most energetic heavy quarks can leave this stage before @xmath41 is reached . for rhic conditions we adopt the results of ref .",
    "@xcite for @xmath35 in a static medium but apply them in the simplest generalization to a medium with time dependent density .",
    "this gives evolution equations for the transverse momentum @xmath42 of quarks propagating the distance @xmath43 in the transverse direction .",
    "the scenario is denoted as model ii , which is described in more detail in refs .",
    "@xcite . strictly speaking , due to the finite size of the medium , the large mass of the heavy quarks and other approximations inherent in such approaches , the models i and ii provide at best semi - quantitative estimates .",
    "nevertheless one can hope to cover various limiting cases to get some insight in the importance of the energy loss effects .    to get the spectra of charm and bottom quarks after energy loss we use a monte carlo simulation with a uniform distribution of the random initial position and random orientation of @xmath13 pairs in the transverse plane . in model",
    "i the total energy loss is determined by the transverse distance @xmath44 of a created heavy quark to the boundary of the system , the quark initial energy and the temperature when leaving the system .",
    "most quarks experience an energy loss @xmath45 and only a few ones @xmath46 .",
    "( the transverse expansion at early times can be neglected , and we take as averaged transverse radius of parton matter @xmath47 fm . ) in model ii we integrate the evolution equations for the heavy quark momentum @xmath48 and position @xmath43 together with the time evolution of the temperature @xmath49 and fugacities @xmath50 ( see below ) as described in refs .",
    "the quantity @xmath43 is used to check whether the considered heavy quark propagates still within deconfined matter ; if it leaves the deconfined medium it does not longer experience an energy loss .",
    "( the energy loss in a mixed and hadron phase might be incorporated in line with the approach of @xcite . )",
    "we consider a heavy quark to be thermalized if its transverse mass @xmath51 during energy loss becomes less than the averaged transverse mass of thermalized light partons at given temperature .",
    "these heavy quarks are redistributed according to the transverse mass distribution @xmath52 with an effective temperature @xmath53 mev @xcite .",
    "we employ a delta function like fragmentation scheme for the heavy quark conversion into @xmath54 and @xmath55 mesons .",
    "it results in the same transverse momentum of the heavy meson as the heavy parent quark has had previously .",
    "inclusive single transverse momentum spectra of electrons / positrons from semileptonic open charm and bottom decays , i.e. , @xmath56 , and dilepton spectra from correlated decays as well , i.e. , @xmath57 , are obtained from a monte carlo code which utilizes the inclusive primary electron energy distribution as delivered by jetset  7.4 .",
    "the heavy mesons are randomly decayed in their rest system and the resulting electrons then boosted appropriately .",
    "the average branching ratio of @xmath56 is taken as 12 ( 10)% @xcite .",
    "the neglect of secondary electrons is justified since we consider here single electron spectra with @xmath58 1 gev and dilepton spectra with @xmath59 2 gev .",
    "the average energies of the secondary electrons , in particular from @xmath55 decays , are too small to affect the spectra in these kinematical regions noticeable .",
    "the following acceptance cuts are utilized in our monte carlo calculations .",
    "phenix @xcite can register electrons in the pseudorapidity window @xmath60 with azimuthal coverage 0 - 90 and 135 - 225 degrees , while alice @xcite is azimuthally symmetric and covers @xmath61 . as minimum transverse electron momentum we use @xmath62 1 gev .",
    "a maximum transverse momentum cut is not imposed , even at alice there is probably one .",
    "we consider here only the electron and @xmath63 channels and the midrapidity region since the energy loss effects are strongest there @xcite .",
    "the results of our calculations of the transverse momentum spectra of inclusive single electrons at rhic conditions are depicted in figs .",
    "1a and b. as already pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite , a measurement of single electrons with @xmath58 1.5 gev at rhic can give a clean and background - free charm signal in heavy - ion collisions .",
    "energy loss effects of the heavy quarks modify this signal . as seen in figs .",
    "1a and b such modifications , according to the energy loss described above , are measurable .",
    "for both the charm and the bottom decay the transverse single electron spectra become softer .",
    "this leads to a noticeable change of the slope of the spectra .",
    "one can fit the distributions by @xmath64 in the interval 2.5 gev @xmath65 4.5 gev and finds @xmath66 646 ( 512 ) mev in case of no stopping ( stopping according to model ii ) for charm , and @xmath66 851 ( 640 ) mev for bottom .",
    "the superposition of charm and bottom decay spectra can be parametrized by @xmath66 711 ( 574 ) mev . therefore , in comparing the @xmath33 spectra of single electrons in pp and aa collisions at the same beam energies one can reveal the stopping effect .",
    "( a direct measurement of the @xmath67 @xmath33 distributions would be more useful , but it is unclear whether the @xmath67 mesons can be identified via their hadronic decay modes in such high - multiplicity environments . ) in extreme case , when the stopping is so large that thermalization with the surrounding matter happens , then a pronounced  thermal bump  at @xmath68 2.5",
    "gev appears .",
    "all of these considerable modifications of the transverse electron spectra in aa collisions in comparison with pp collisions can be helpful for identifying the creation of a hot and dense parton system .",
    "it should be noted that the energy loss effects affect the single - electron @xmath33 spectra much stronger than another fragmentation scheme ( e.g. the below described peterson scheme ) would do .",
    "the invariant mass dilepton spectra resulting from both correlated charm and bottom",
    "decays are displayed in figs .",
    "2a and b for rhic and lhc energies . also shown is the distribution of thermal dileptons according to eq .  ( 9 ) below .",
    "as pointed out earlier @xcite the @xmath4 spectra are by far dominated by the dileptons from correlated open charm and bottom decays .",
    "a strong energy loss according to the above models reduces the decay contributions , so that ( i ) at rhic charm and bottom decay dileptons are in the same order of magnitude as the drell - yan background @xcite , and ( ii ) at lhc still bottom will dominate the drell - yan background , and charm is slightly below bottom @xcite . while without any detector acceptances usually the predictions of the thermal yield ( dealt with in the next section ) is in the same order of magnitude as the drell - yan background @xcite , it turns out that both the acceptances of phenix and alice suppress the thermal signal stronger than the drell - yan background .",
    "at the first sight such a situation looks quite unfavorable for a measurement of the thermal signal even at such high energies as achieved at rhic and lhc .",
    "nevertheless we show below that one can select special kinematical conditions superimposed to the detector cuts to analyze the more informative double differential dilepton spectrum with the aim to find a window for the thermal signal .",
    "in order to estimate the thermal dilepton yield from deconfined matter we restrict ourselves to the lowest order processes @xmath69 , i.e. , the electromagnetic annihilation of quarks and antiquarks .",
    "contributions from qcd processes like @xmath70 and @xmath71 have been considered @xcite and appear to be not very significant ( typically they increase the yield by a factor less than 2.5 ) .",
    "the rate of dilepton production per space - time volume can be obtained within a kinetic theory approach as @xmath72 & & \\times    ( 2\\pi)^4 \\ , \\delta^{(4 ) } ( p_1 + p_2 - p_+ - p_-),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath73 are the four momenta of incoming quarks ( @xmath74 1 , 2 ) and outgoing leptons ( @xmath75 ) .",

    "the quantities @xmath77 stand for the distribution functions of quarks and antiquarks . integrating eq .",
    "( 3 ) over the momenta of the leptons one gets a widely used expression @xcite for the dilepton rate per four - momentum of the pair , @xmath78 , @xmath79 the pair s four momentum can be expressed as @xmath80 with @xmath6 as transverse mass , @xmath4 as invariant mass , and @xmath7 as rapidity of the pair .",
    "the relative quark velocity reads @xmath81 , while the total cross section is @xmath82 with quark charge factor @xmath83 for u , d quarks , and @xmath84 is the fine structure constant .    for the calculation of dilepton spectra in the region of large invariant mass one can utilize the boltzmann approximation for the incoming partons @xmath85 where @xmath86 is the four - velocity of the medium .",
    "the above parton distributions are assumed to be in thermal equilibrium in momentum space , but not necessarily in chemical equilibrium . only for chemical equilibrium",
    "the fugacities @xmath87 become unity .",
    "the space - time evolution of the produced deconfined matter is governed in our approach by the longitudinal scaling - invariant expansion accompanied by quark and gluon chemical equilibration processes @xcite .",
    "within such a model the space - time volume reads @xmath88 with @xmath34 as proper time and flow rapidity @xmath89 . integrating the rate eq .",
    "( 4 ) over the parton momenta and space - time evolution results in the dilepton spectrum @xmath90 the physical information encoded in the spectrum eq .",
    "( [ m_perp ] ) can be inferred from the following approximation . for large values of @xmath0",
    "the main contribution to the time integral stems from early , hot stages at @xmath91 . under the assumption that the equation of state behaves like @xmath92 ( here @xmath93 and @xmath94 stand for the pressure and energy density , respectively )",

    "afterwards , the combination @xmath108 can be extracted . if one could constrain by other means the initial time of the thermalized era , @xmath98 , then even eq .",
    "( [ m_perp_a ] ) allows to estimate the initial fugacity @xmath109 . due to",
    "particle production processes the comoving entropy density does not longer serve as a link between initial and final states in the evolution dynamics .",
    "our choice of initial conditions for produced deconfined matter is based on the estimates of refs .",
    "@xcite for the minijet plasma with a suitable parametrization of the soft component @xcite which are similar to the self - screened parton cascade model @xcite .",
    "we take as main set of parameters for the initial temperature @xmath110 550 ( 1000 ) mev , for gluon fugacity @xmath111 0.5 , and for light quark fugacity @xmath112 of the parton plasma formed at rhic ( lhc ) at initial time @xmath113 0.2 fm / c . to achieve an upper  optimistic  limit of the thermal dilepton yield we consider below also higher values of the initial quark and gluon fugacities ( @xmath114 0.5 , 1 , and @xmath111 1 ) which lead to different final states . for the sake of definiteness",
    "we assume full saturation at confinement temperature @xmath115 170 mev and a quadratic time dependence of @xmath116 @xcite .",
    "to get realistic dilepton spectra which can be measured in relativistic heavy - ion collisions one should take into account the experimental conditions related to the acceptance of detectors . to do",
    "so we employ monte carlo simulations with proper distributions of created leptons with respect to individual rapidities @xmath117 and transverse momenta @xmath118 . in case of the thermal emission of leptons from deconfined matter the needed distribution can be obtained directly from eq .",
    "( 3 ) . due to the energy - momentum conservation",
    "the exponential function , originating from the boltzmann distribution , can be rewritten as @xmath119 . since also @xmath120 the integration in eq .",
    "( 3 ) over the parton momenta yields @xmath121 where @xmath122 and the flux factor becomes @xmath123 .",
    "then the space - time integrated distribution of thermal leptons reads @xmath124 with dilepton transverse mass @xmath125 . to get the invariant mass spectra we also use the kinematical relationship",
    "@xmath126 $ ] , where @xmath127 denote the azimuthal angles of the leptons in the transverse plane .",
    "as pointed out above , due to the dominant contribution of correlated open charm and bottom decays via @xmath128 into the high invariant mass dilepton spectra it is very unlikely that the thermal dilepton production from quark fusion can be observed by using the distribution @xmath129 alone even when imposing tricky cuts .",
    "in this situation the more detailed information of the full spectrum @xmath130 is expected to allow for better chances to extract the wanted thermal signal .    as known since some time @xcite and as directly seen in eq .",
    "( 6 ) the dilepton yield from an equilibrium quark - gluon plasma depends only on the transverse mass , i.e. , @xmath131 ; that is , it scales with @xmath0 .",
    "the main conditions for this famous @xmath0 scaling are @xcite ( i ) local thermalization of the source of the dileptons , ( ii ) no scale other then the temperature , and ( iii ) predominant boost - invariant flow of matter . the most convincing way to see the validity of the @xmath0 scaling is to consider the @xmath5 dependence of the dilepton spectrum at fixed value of @xmath0 . in case of the boost - invariantly expanding quark - gluon plasma one gets for @xmath132 indeed a straight line between @xmath133 0 and @xmath0",
    ". a detailed analysis of the transverse momentum dependence of the dilepton spectra is performed in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the possible origins of a @xmath0 scaling violation related to transverse flow and contributions from the hadron gas are studied .",
    "the transverse expansion of deconfined matter affects hardly the @xmath0 scaling , while for hadron matter the life time is strongly reduced , so that its contribution to the total spectrum is moderate . in fact , our previous studies @xcite show that the conditions for the @xmath0 scaling are satisfied for radiation from thermalized matter expected to be created in central collisions at rhic and lhc . at the same time",
    "the dileptons from correlated open charm and bottom decay should strongly violate the @xmath0 scaling if the @xmath134 and @xmath135 pairs are dominantly produced by hard initial parton collisions .",
    "the qualitative argument is as follows : similar to the drell - yan process the hard charm and bottom pairs are created mainly back - to - back ( unless hard gluon radiation spoils this correlation ) , i.e. , the pair momentum is preferential @xmath136 , and consequently also the @xmath137 spectrum at fixed @xmath138 is strongly peaked at 0 .",
    "the subsequent semileptonic decays cause a partial randomization of the lepton directions but , due to the lorentz boost effect , both the leptons still are concentrated at small values of @xmath5 . as a result one can expect that in the large @xmath5 region the thermal signal sticks out , while the semileptonic decay products are sharply dropping .      to quantify this effect we perform monte carlo calculations generating thermal dielectrons in accordance with the distribution eq .",
    "( 9 ) . as above",
    "we take into account the acceptances of phenix at rhic and alice at lhc .",
    "first we consider the simplified case without any momentum degradation of heavy quarks , i.e. , energy loss effects are not included and the @xmath139 function fragmentation scheme is employed .",
    "this is obviously the most favorable case for the relative contribution from decay dileptons to the full dilepton yield .    in order to get some threshold effect for the decay dileptons in dependence of @xmath5 at",
    "fixed @xmath0 one needs to select leptons with individual transverse momenta greater than the maximum electron energy in the rest system of the decaying open charm or bottom meson .",
    "typically such a threshold value is given by 1 ( 2 ) gev for charm ( bottom ) .",
    "the results of our calculations of the @xmath5 spectra for rhic conditions are displayed in fig .",

    "the value of the minimum transverse momentum of leptons is chosen as @xmath141 1 gev .",
    "the detector acceptance destroys the ideal @xmath0 scaling , i.e. , the thermal yield gets some structure reflecting the @xmath33 cut and the geometry .",
    "one can see the threshold like behavior of the dilepton spectrum from charm decays : there is a rapid dropping of the yield at @xmath142 1.3 gev .",
    "on the contrary the thermal dilepton spectrum sticks out up to the kinematical boundary @xmath10 .",
    "unfortunately such a value of @xmath141 1 gev is not large enough to cause a similar suppression effect for leptons from bottom decays .",
    "nevertheless as pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite and as seen in fig .",
    "3a the contribution from bottom decays is suppressed ( this is due to the narrow rapidity gap covered by phenix ) but it is clearly above the thermal yield for the initial quark fugacity @xmath143 0.1 . to estimate the chances to see a thermal dilepton signal over the background from bottom",
    "decays we perform variations of the initial quark fugacity . due to the factor @xmath144 in the thermal rate eq .",
    "( 9 ) , even a comparatively small increase of the initial quark phase space saturation can result in a noticeable enhancement of thermal dileptons compared to the decay background .",
    "this can be seen in fig .",
    "3a for the initial quark fugacities @xmath143 0.5 and 1 . for the latter value",
    "the thermal signal is above the bottom decay contribution .    for lhc conditions one can obtain the threshold like effect in the @xmath5 spectrum even for the dielectrons from the massive bottom decays . in fig .",
    "3b we show our results for dileptons within the transverse mass interval 5.25 @xmath140 5.75 gev .",
    "the electron transverse momentum cut @xmath141 2 gev causes a sufficiently strong threshold effect both for charm and bottom , while the dielectrons from thermalized matter exhibit the approximate @xmath0 scaling even for such a value of @xmath9 .",
    "it gives therefore the opportunity to measure the thermal dilepton signal on the basis of the @xmath0 scaling at lhc conditions .",
    "actually such measurements could be performed for lepton pairs with high enough transverse momentum but smaller invariant mass .",
    "in particular , as follows from fig .",

    "independently we also study the influence of energy loss of heavy quarks in the deconfined medium .",
    "both these effects cause a suppression of the dilepton yield from open charm and bottom , in particular in the small-@xmath5 ( large-@xmath4 ) region . since the suppression effect due to peterson s fragmentation is quite small ( typically within factor 2 )",
    "we do not display it separately . on the contrary ,",
    "the degradation of the heavy quark momenta due to energy loss in the deconfined medium causes a considerably suppression of the contribution of decay leptons in the @xmath5 spectrum at fixed value of @xmath0 . in fig .",
    "4 we show the results of our calculations for lhc conditions with the same kinematical cuts as in fig .  3b . as seen in this plot ,",
    "both charm and bottom are considerably suppressed due to energy loss effects , in particular in the region of smaller values of @xmath5 .",
    "these calculations exploit the model i. in case of model ii the suppression effect is much stronger . with respect to",
    "the wanted thermal dilepton signal the suppression of the @xmath5 spectra from bottom decays appears most important .",
    "the proper @xmath5 window to extract thermal dileptons becomes greater , e.g. , 3 gev @xmath146 5.5 gev for initial quark fugacity @xmath143 0.5 .",
    "therefore , the energy loss effect obviously helps to measure thermal dielectrons with alice at lhc on the basis of the @xmath0 scaling behavior . to clarify whether the proposed signal is experimentally feasible we estimate the background from @xmath152 decays within the same kinematical gates . for this background study",
    "we also perform monte carlo simulations of @xmath153 decays utilizing the distribution @xmath154 with @xmath155 200 mev in accordance with present sps results for central pb + pb collisions at 158 agev beam energies @xcite .",
    "the slope parameter @xmath156 is a convolution of local freeze - out temperature and transverse flow .",

    "the fictitious values @xmath157 2500 ( 500 ) for lhc ( rhic ) .",
    "each @xmath152 is three - body decayed in its rest frame with the branching ratio of 1.2% @xcite and then the resulting @xmath63 pair is boosted and filtered .",
    "we find the individual @xmath152 decay dileptons with 5.25 gev @xmath140 5.75 gev three orders of magnitude below the thermal dilepton signal and only at @xmath142 5.2 gev .",
    "the flattening of the pion spectrum at large values of @xmath33 , due the cronin effect and hard scatterings , is not covered by our parametrization of the @xmath158 spectrum ; it will enhance the pion decay contribution .",
    "otherwise some quenching @xcite at large values of @xmath158 can counteract and balance such effects .",
    "the finite experimental momentum resolution will cause a decay contribution also at somewhat smaller values of @xmath5 .",
    "however , these effects will hardly close the window for the thermal signal .",
    "the next - to - leading order drell - yan contribution is also estimated to be strongly suppressed at larger values of @xmath5 ( say , for @xmath142 1 gev ) because of the chosen large @xmath33 cut .",
    "the most prominent danger however comes from the combinatorical background from uncorrelated hadron decays : only after experimentally removing this background together with the background from the conversion dileptons , emerging from energetic photons in the detector material , one has a chance to see the interesting signal .",
    "fully analog considerations also apply at rhic .",
    "however , selecting electron pairs with such large values of @xmath159 5.5 gev and choosing @xmath141 2 gev results in prohibitory small counting rates which seem to make such a strategy not feasible . for",
    "the above choice of @xmath159 2.5 gev and choosing @xmath141 1 gev the dileptons from @xmath152 decays produce here a contribution which is three orders of magnitude above the thermal signal , however only in the interval @xmath142 1.95 gev .",
    "therefore , one remains in a situation as depicted in fig .",
    "3a and discussed above .",
    "in summary we analyze the chances of observing a thermal dilepton signal in high - energy heavy - ion collisions . exploiting currently estimated energy loss effects of heavy quarks passing through deconfined matter we find that the invariant mass spectra of dileptons , as measurable in the detector facilities phenix and alice , offer hardly a chance to find thermal dileptons with @xmath59 2 gev .",
    "even if in optimistic energy loss scenarios the dileptons from correlated charm and bottom decays compete with the drell - yan background , the thermal signal is significantly smaller . since the energy loss is a poorly quantified effect we stress the need to make attempts to verify it , for instance via the single electron @xmath33 spectra which should reflect the transverse momentum degradation of parent charm and bottom mesons .",
    "the double differential rate @xmath160 with @xmath0 in a narrow interval and with a suitable @xmath9 cut on the individual leptons , however , seems to allow for a window at large values of the pair transverse momentum where the thermal yield shines out . at rhic",
    "this is probably not feasible , while at lhc the estimated high initial temperature of the parton matter causes a stronger thermal signal .",
    "the basic issue is here whether the combinatorical background of many other strong sources can be subtracted with sufficient accuracy .      stimulating discussions with r. baier , e.v .",
