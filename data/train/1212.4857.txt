    "the yee finite - difference time - domain ( fdtd ) algorithm @xcite simulates electromagnetic waves in uniform , isotropic media with second - order error : i.e. , the yee algorithm simulates the frequency of a plane wave with an error that scales as @xmath1 with grid cell size @xmath2 .",
    "this paper presents a generalization of the yee algorithm for non - uniform , anisotropic dielectric media , with particular attention to sharp transitions between different dielectrics .",
    "( this generalization is also suitable for the intermediate cases , such as continuously - varying dielectrics , whether isotropic or not . )",
    "when different dielectric materials meet at a sharp interface , the discontinuity in the fields introduces greater error into the simulation .",
    "if the discontinuity is disregarded , operations such as field - interpolation typically have local @xmath3 error at the interface ( the error remains constant as @xmath4 because the field discontinuity remains constant ) .",
    "however , because the ratio of the cells cut by the interface to the total number of cells is @xmath5 , the local error @xmath3 is watered down by a factor of @xmath5 , leading to a `` global error '' of @xmath5 .",
    "( by global error , we refer to the error in a mode frequency or the average field error over an entire eigenmode , whereas local error is field error in a single cell .",
    "this relationship between global error and relatively high local error on a subset of cells has been proven rigorously for 1d waves @xcite , and demonstrated empirically for 2d and 3d electromagnetic problems , e.g. , with curved metal boundaries @xcite and curved dielectric interfaces @xcite . )    when the dielectric constant varies continuously , the variation across a cell vanishes as @xmath4 , so it is not difficult to obtain local @xmath5 error , hence global @xmath1 error @xcite .",
    "of course we would like the same @xmath1 error even with sharp dielectric boundaries ; to the best of our knowledge , the first finite - difference approach to accomplish this was @xcite , which obtained global second - order error with local first - order error at the interface . instead of considering the error of the discretized system for fixed frequency or wavelength @xmath6 and vanishing @xmath2 , accuracy was demanded for fixed @xmath2 and infinite @xmath6 . ref .",
    "@xcite showed how to convert @xmath7 to @xmath8 _ exactly _ in the limit of @xmath9 .",
    "this led to global @xmath1 error .",
    "unfortunately , the accurate method of @xcite is unstable in the time - domain , because it uses an asymmetric _ inverse dielectric matrix _ ( the linear operator that transforms the @xmath7 field to the @xmath8 field on the yee mesh ) , which has complex eigenvalues , hence complex mode frequencies . while the imaginary parts of the frequencies are within the error [ i.e. , @xmath10 , they lead to unphysical growth that becomes significant after sufficient time .",
    "moreover , while well - resolved modes ( @xmath11 ) may have slow growth , there are always modes with @xmath12 which may grow quickly ; thus machine - precision - level noise eventually grows to overwhelm the desired signal .",
    "a _ symmetric _ inverse dielectric matrix was given by @xcite , yielding an algorithm with @xmath5 global error ( we will refer to this algorithm as `` wc07 '' ) . this algorithm is stable at the low dielectric contrasts studied in @xcite ( where `` dielectric contrast '' is the ratio of dielectric constants between neighboring media in a simulation ) .",
    "however , we have recently found that wc07 is unstable for high dielectric contrast ( see sec .",
    "[ sec : oldalg ] ) , because the dielectric matrix is not always positive definite .",
    "in this paper we use the `` triplets '' concept of @xcite to obtain stable algorithms in the time domain .",
    "if one can find symmetric and positive - definite ( spd ) effective dielectric tensors acting on triplets of field components , then the tensors can be combined into an inverse dielectric matrix that is also spd , which ensures stability in the time domain .",
    "we show that a small change to the wc07 algorithm @xcite yields a new algorithm ( `` wc07mod '' ) with an spd inverse dielectric matrix ; wc07mod is therefore stable for arbitrary dielectric contrast . using the same framework for stability ,",
    "we provide yet another algorithm that is stable for arbitrary dielectric contrast ; this algorithm simply uses the symmetrized matrix of @xcite .",
    "the act of symmetrizing increases the error from @xmath1 to @xmath5 , but we find that this algorithm still has smaller error than the other effective - dielectric methods @xcite .    for example , for a dielectric contrast around 10 , the new method reduces the frequency error by a factor of 23 at high resolutions , and it reduces the error of fields by a factor of 210 . reducing the error by a factor of 2 can reduce computation by a factor of @xmath13 , because the error scales as @xmath5 while the computation time typically scales as @xmath14 ( for a 3d problem ) .    while examining the error",
    ", we show that _ for low dielectric contrast _ ( less than 10 or so ) , the new algorithm yields very similar results to other effective dielectrics ( @xcite ) , and the error is very nearly second - order up to high resolution . in other words , for low dielectric contrast , the error is dominated not by the field discontinuities , but by the bulk yee algorithm . at sufficiently high resolution , however , we believe all these algorithms transition to first - order . as the dielectric contrast increases , the transition point moves to lower resolutions .",
    "we also examine the error in fields : the error at ( or within a fixed number of cells of ) the dielectric surface is @xmath3 .",
    "however , the field error is @xmath5 at a fixed physical distance from the surface ( n.b .",
    ", that distance spans more cells as @xmath2 diminishes ) .",
    "this supports the application of @xcite to this problem ; in other words , the local surface error is @xmath3 , but only @xmath5 cells are cut by the surface , so the global error is @xmath5",
    ".    the latter point may be very important for applications attempting to characterize surface fields with effective dielectric algorithms .",
    "such attempts should be wary of errors in the surface fields , because the error does not decrease with cell size . however , the error is probably small enough in many cases that it will not be a problem . and , the fields a fixed distance from the surface do become more accurate as the cell size is reduced .    after a brief outline of algorithms discussed in this paper , we will present the discretization of maxwell s equations , reducing the problem of introducing dielectric to the problem of finding an inverse dielectric matrix @xmath15 .",
    "section  [ sec : stability ] then describes how to create @xmath15 to guarantee stability , assuming the ability to create local @xmath16 effective dielectric tensors that are spd ( but otherwise unrestricted ) , thus reducing the problem to finding the local effective dielectric .",
    "sections  [ sec : oldalg ] , [ sec : simplestable ] , and [ sec : symacc ] present three different methods for calculating local effective dielectric tensors .",
    "first we describe the effective dielectric that reproduces the wc07 algorithm  this effective dielectric is not ( always ) positive definite , so it does nt guarantee stability .",
    "second , we modify wc07 slightly to guarantee stability .",
    "third , we present an effective dielectric that guarantees stability , and has similar or better accuracy than the second option .",
    "all these methods require the same amount of computation for every time step .",
    "subsequent sections present the error , in both frequency and field , of the different algorithms for different problems : 2d and 3d , isotropic and anisotropic , over a range of dielectric contrast from 5100 .",
    "the following algorithms will be discussed in this paper :    * wc07 : the algorithm recommended by @xcite [ therewithin called variant ( c)@xmath17(e)]it is unstable for high dielectric contrast ; ( ref .  @xcite used wc07 , with the improved dielectric averaging of @xcite instead of @xcite .",
    "these two averaging methods are identical for isotropic dielectrics ; accuracy for anisotropic dielectrics may improve , but the error still converges as @xmath5 . ) * wc07mod : a stable algorithm , almost the same as wc07 ; * the `` new '' method : a stable and more accurate algorithm , but still with @xmath5 error ( sections [ sec : stability ] and [ sec : symacc ] ) ; * the second - order method of @xcite : the only finite - difference algorithm with second - order error is unfortunately asymmetric , rendering it unstable for time - domain use ( but still good for frequency - domain eigensolvers ) .",
    "rr    we want to simulate the dynamic maxwell equations with dielectric : @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the inverse dielectric tensor ( which can vary in space ) .    to discretize maxwell s equations for computational work , we follow yee @xcite . to analyze the discretization",
    ", we treat the fields as large vectors , with each component representing a field at one point of the yee mesh , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : yeemesh ] .",
    "( discretization in time is irrelevant to this paper , so we retain continuous time derivatives . )    for convenience , we label each component of a field vector with 4 sub - indices : e.g. , the component @xmath20 represents the electric field in the @xmath21 direction at its yee location in cell @xmath22 .",
    "the differential operators become matrices , with rows and columns each indexed by 4 sub - indices : e.g. , one element of a matrix @xmath23 is @xmath24 .",
    "we will not review the yee discretization , since @xcite details the relevant aspects , instead taking it for granted that the matrices @xmath25 and @xmath26 represent the curl operators ( the matrix representation of the curl of @xmath27 is the transpose of the curl of @xmath28 ) .",
    "we depart from yee when we introduce the matrix @xmath15 to discretize the linear relationship between @xmath27 and @xmath29 , yielding : @xmath30_{ijk\\mu }      \\\\",
    "\\frac{\\partial } { \\partial t } d_{ijk\\mu } & = & [ c^t b]_{ijk\\mu }      \\\\",

    "simulating dielectrics therefore reduces to the determination of @xmath15 such that    1 .",
    "@xmath15 accurately represents the inverse dielectric tensor , @xmath36 , and 2 .",
    "@xmath35 is diagonalizable with only real , non - negative eigenvalues .",
    "the first point addresses accuracy .",
    "the second addresses robustness / stability : if @xmath35 has negative or complex eigenvalues , some frequencies @xmath37 will be complex , and some fields will grow exponentially ( unphysically ) , ultimately overwhelming the simulation with noise .",
    "if @xmath15 is symmetric and positive definite ( spd ) , then the second point above will be guaranteed : all modes will oscillate ( with real frequency ) without growing ( cf .",
    ", @xcite , or a standard linear algebra text such as @xcite)at least for a sufficiently small time step .",
    "( as stated , temporal discretization is outside the focus of this paper ) .",
    "this paper is devoted to finding an spd matrix @xmath15 that accurately represents dielectric media .",
    "our approach to dielectric simulation falls under the `` effective dielectric '' category , specifying the matrix @xmath15 to find @xmath31 , while advancing @xmath29 ( and @xmath28 ) in time according to the unaltered yee algorithm @xcite .    as in ref .",
    "@xcite , we demand that @xmath15 have the following properties .    1 .   in case of uniform ( anisotropic )",
    "dielectric , @xmath15 involves only centered interpolations of fields ( i.e. , interpolations with @xmath1 error for continuous fields ) .",
    "2 .   within uniform , _ isotropic _ dielectric",
    ", @xmath15 reduces to a multiple of the identity .",
    "3 .   @xmath15 must be symmetric .",
    "@xmath15 must be positive definite .",
    "the first property yields a local @xmath1 error within uniform dielectric ( or even continuously - varying dielectric @xcite ) .",
    "the second is for convenience and minimalism  we can still use the plain yee algorithm for fields within any bulk isotropic region .",
    "together , the third and fourth properties guarantee stability . ( for comparison : wc07 satisfies 1 , 2 , and 3 . )    before defining the @xmath15 matrix , we need to introduce notation for an effective dielectric tensor involving field components of a single yee cell . for example",
    ", we consider the `` triplet '' of three @xmath38 values labeled in fig .",
    "[ fig : yeemesh ] and the three @xmath39 values at the same locations , along edges that touch a common node ( corner ) of the cell .",
    "if the node index is @xmath40 , then this triplet comprises @xmath41 , and similarly @xmath42 .",
    "( we call these components a triplet , instead of a 3-vector , because they are not collocated . )",
    "the triplets for @xmath27 and @xmath29 can be related by a @xmath16 tensor , @xmath43 : @xmath44 ( the meaning of the @xmath45 superscript will be explained shortly ) . defined",
    "thus , @xmath43 is an effective ( inverse ) dielectric tensor for this particular triplet of @xmath27 and @xmath29 values .",
    "touching the same cell node are seven other ( eight , in all ) geometrically - identical triplets .",
    "above , we chose a triplet with edges extending positively in each direction from their common node , but ( due to the symmetries of the yee mesh ) we could equally well have chosen , e.g. , the @xmath21-edge extending in the _ negative _ @xmath21 direction , namely @xmath46 , and @xmath47 . with this triplet",
    ", we associate a different effective dielectric , @xmath48 , with the minus sign indicating that the @xmath49 and @xmath50 edges extend in the negative @xmath21 direction from node @xmath40",
    ".    we will construct ( the large matrix ) @xmath15 from the ( small ) @xmath51 tensors , through an intermediate stage involving ( large , block - diagonal matrices ) @xmath52 . symmetry and positive definiteness transfer easily from one stage to the next : we will show that @xmath15 is spd if all the @xmath51 are spd ; since the latter are mere @xmath16 matrices , evaluating their positive definiteness is easy , numerically if not analytically .",
    "we start by creating block - diagonal matrices @xmath53 , @xmath54 ,  , @xmath55 , where the blocks are the @xmath51 ; for example , each block of @xmath54 is @xmath48 for some node @xmath40 . precisely we define @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the kronecker delta , equal to one when @xmath58 , @xmath59 , and @xmath60 , and otherwise equal to zero .",
    "a block - diagonal matrix is spd if and only if each block is spd ; therefore , if each @xmath43 is spd , then @xmath53 is spd , and likewise for all @xmath52 .",
    "we finish by taking the @xmath15 matrix to be the average , @xmath61 since the sum of spd matrices is again spd , @xmath15 is spd .",
    "figure  [ fig : algorithm ] illustrates how this scheme determines @xmath20 from neighboring @xmath29 values .",
    "0 where @xmath62 is the kronecker delta , and @xmath63 is the @xmath64 component of a symmetric , positive - definite inverse dielectric tensor representing the effective dielectric in the region of the triplet associated with the indices @xmath40 and @xmath65 .",
    "for example : @xmath66    thus we can create a stable algorithm independent of the details of the @xmath51 , which can be chosen to improve accuracy at the dielectric interface , within broad constraints : the @xmath51 must be spd .",
    "in addition , when node @xmath40 is within uniform dielectric and far from a dielectric interface , @xmath51 must equal @xmath36 , where @xmath67 is the position of node @xmath22 .",
    "this guarantees that , within isotropic dielectric , each @xmath68 is a multiple of the identity , and so @xmath15 satisfies requirement 2 , above .",
    "furthermore , within uniform dielectric , the algorithm becomes identical to wc07 ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : oldalgorithm ] ) , which uses centered interpolation to yield @xmath1 error ( within uniform dielectric @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , @xmath15 satisfies requirements 1 and 2 ( as well as 3 and 4 ) .",
    "it is easy to forget , when viewing the algorithm as a way to find a single @xmath49 ( as in fig .",
    "[ fig : algorithm ] ) , that @xmath69 , @xmath70 , and @xmath71 must come from the same ( spd ) tensor @xmath72 .",
    "indeed , it was forgetting which @xmath73 had to be mathematically related to each other that led to the instability of wc07 .    to reiterate : each @xmath52 matrix is block - diagonal , with @xmath16 blocks ( @xmath74 ) , each of which represents the effective dielectric tensor around node @xmath40 . as long as the @xmath51 are spd , the @xmath52 are spd .",
    "this further implies that the average , eq .",
    "[ eq : stablescheme ] , is spd .",
    "we have thus shown how to find a stable matrix @xmath15 , given the ability to find @xmath16 effective inverse dielectric tensors that map a triplet of neighboring components @xmath75 to the @xmath76 at the same locations . moreover , within uniform ( isotropic or anisotropic ) dielectric , this algorithm is identical to wc07 ( hence it satisfies requirements 1 and 2 ) .",
    "it remains to find the effective dielectric tensors @xmath74 that will accurately represent the real dielectric .",
    "reference  @xcite showed how to find @xmath74 with local @xmath5 error , yielding global @xmath1 error ; unfortunately , those @xmath74 are asymmetric .    in the next section",
    ", we will describe the effective dielectric tensors that yield the wc07 algorithm ; some of those tensors may not be positive definite , so that algorithm can be unstable .",
    "we then describe a modification to make it stable .",
    "however , another effective dielectric turns out to yield lower error ( sec .",
    "[ sec : symacc ] ) .",
    "we have tried several other effective dielectrics , and found them less accurate , but always yielding ultimate @xmath5 global error ( even stairstepped dielectrics have @xmath5 error ) .",
    "experiment tells us that wc07 ( the algorithm of @xcite ) can be unstable ; therefore , we need concern ourselves no more with that algorithm .",
    "however , it is interesting to see exactly how these algorithms differ , so in this section we describe wc07 within the framework of this paper , and show why it does not meet the previously - described ( sufficient , but not necessary ) conditions for a stable algorithm .",
    "figure  [ fig : oldalgorithm ] depicts the wc07 method recommended in @xcite [ where it is called ( c)@xmath17(e ) ] . to find @xmath49 from its nearest - neighbor @xmath39 values :    1 .",
    "perform a centered interpolation of @xmath77 and @xmath78 to the nearest cell node ; 2 .   find @xmath79 , using the effective dielectric @xmath80 at the @xmath21-edge center ; 3 .   find @xmath81 at each node , using the effective dielectric @xmath82 at that node ; similarly , find @xmath83 at each node ; 4 .",
    "interpolate the two @xmath84 from each node to the center of the @xmath21-edge where @xmath49 and @xmath50 are located ; interpolate @xmath85 similarly .    finally , @xmath49 is the sum of parts coming from @xmath86 , @xmath84 , and @xmath85 .    in the framework of the previous section ,",
    "wc07 is a choice of effective @xmath87 : @xmath88 the tensors @xmath89 , @xmath90 , @xmath91 , and @xmath92 are all to be found from the averaging method of @xcite , where @xmath89 is the `` average '' of @xmath36 over a cell volume centered at the node ( lowest corner ) of cell @xmath22 , and @xmath90 is the `` average '' over a cell volume centered at the location of @xmath20 ( the @xmath21-edge - center ) , etc .",
    "these @xmath51 do not satisfy the conditions for the effective dielectric required by the previous section .",
    "e.g. , @xmath93 is symmetric , but it is not necessarily positive definite .",
    "the reason is that the diagonal and off - diagonal elements of @xmath93 come from different tensors : @xmath89 , @xmath90 , @xmath91 , and @xmath92 .",
    "each of these four tensors is spd ( using the averaging method of @xcite , cf .",
    "[ sec : posdefeffdiel ] ) , but there s no guarantee that a tensor with a mixture of elements from those tensors is positive definite .",
    "indeed , we have found experimentally that the wc07 algorithm can yield an instability when the dielectric contrast is high enough .",
    "we hasten to point out that we have used that algorithm successfully on a wide range of problems without noticing any instability .",
    "an instability seems to be more likely for higher contrast , and for larger and more complicated dielectric shapes .    by using the gershgorin circle theorem to place a lower bound on the eigenvalues of the @xmath15 matrix (",
    "if the lower eigenvalue bound is positive , then @xmath15 is positive definite , assuming @xmath15 is symmetric ) , we can prove for many particular simulations that the algorithm is in fact stable .",
    "for example , we usually find that simulations with @xmath94 are provably stable ( on an individual basis , by examining @xmath15 with the gershgorin circle theorem ) .",
    "many simulations appear stable for long times even when not provably stable .",
    "of course , it s hard to know whether there might be unstably - growing modes that would dominate the simulation if run 100 times longer ; and such unstable modes might interfere with precision measurements well before they become obviously apparent .    for a 2d simulation of photonic crystal modes of a square lattice of isotropic dielectric discs in vacuum ( radius @xmath95 , where @xmath96 is the lattice constant ) , we have seen that at @xmath97 we can run simulations with @xmath98 cells for a time 3000@xmath99 ( where @xmath100 is the speed of light ) _ without _ seeing an instability ( which rules out instabilities growing faster than @xmath101 , which corresponds to growth of 16 orders of magnitude in 3000@xmath99 ) . for @xmath102 cells , however , an instability grows as @xmath103 , where @xmath104 .",

    ", an instability grows with @xmath107 , and for @xmath102 cells , @xmath108 .",
    "in this section we make a small change to the wc07 algorithm that renders it stable .",
    "although this algorithm , which we will call `` wc07mod , '' is not the most accurate , we present it because it is a relatively trivial modification of wc07 , and the resulting degradation of accuracy is interesting , in light of the small modification , which still uses the same averaging method to find the effective dielectric within a given cell - sized volume .    in the language of this paper ,",

    "however , at coarse resolutions ( large @xmath2 ) , the error often falls as @xmath1 for low dielectric contrast .",
    "this may explain why previous studies have concluded that methods such as wc07 have second - order error  they did not explore high - enough resolution or contrast ( of course , in practice , one may often reach a tolerable error level within the second - order regime , in which case the ultimate order of error may be irrelevant ) .",
    "the error convergence in surface fields was the same as in frequencies when we considered the surface fields a fixed distance ( e.g. , @xmath139 ) away from the dielectric boundary .",

    ".    we will show that the other fdtd algorithms , wc07 and wc07mod generally have similar or greater error compared to the new algorithm ; and the other examples ( 3d and isotropic ) show qualitatively similar convergence .    for comparison ,",
    "we also show frequency convergence for the second - order ( but unstable in the time - domain ) method of @xcite in [ sec : secondorderconvergence ] .",
    "we simulated te modes ( with @xmath144 , @xmath145 , and no variation in @xmath146 ) in a square lattice ( lattice constant @xmath96 ) of dielectric discs of radius @xmath147 in vacuum ; the discs were of dielectric @xmath148 where we vary the scalar @xmath149 to vary the dielectric contrast .",
    "for @xmath150 , the above is the diagonal matrix @xmath151 rotated by 30 degrees around the @xmath146-axis .",
    "figure  [ fig : anisodiscfreqconv ] shows the relative error in the frequency of the lowest several modes vs. the number of cells per vacuum wavelength ( or @xmath100 divided by the mode frequency ) , for dielectric contrast of @xmath152 .",
    "low contrast simulations , @xmath153 , yield second - order error to rather high resolutions . at sufficiently high resolution ,",
    "the error becomes first - order ; this is more clearly seen in the mid - contrasts . for high contrast ,",
    "@xmath154 , the second - order region is too small to notice , and first - order convergence is clear .    there is a problem in examining the convergence of the fields .",
    "the fields are discontinuous at the dielectric interface , and it is not obvious how best to interpolate the fields near the interface . there is a danger , when choosing an interpolation method , that it might not be the best interpolation method .",
    "therefore , we avoid the interface . staying at least @xmath140 ( where @xmath2 is the cell size ) away from the surface , there is no serious ambiguity in interpolation : a simple bilinear ( or , in 3d , trilinear ) interpolation should be sufficient for errors of at least @xmath1 .",
    "we examine field - convergence in two ways .",
    "first , we generate a set of ( evenly - distributed ) points on a circle at a radius @xmath139 larger than the interface , and , at each resolution , interpolate the mode fields to those points , comparing against our normative values ( from the algorithm of @xcite ) using the @xmath155-norm over the set of points ( after normalizing the entire eigenmodes ) .",
    "we then graph the relative error vs. resolution .",
    "we find ( not surprisingly ) that it converges at the same rate ( ultimately @xmath5 ) as the mode frequencies ( fig .",
    "[ fig : symaccsurfe ] ) .    for @xmath156 ,",
    "modes 4 and 5 have relatively large errors in the surface field ; qualitatively , however , the modes look more accurate than the @xmath155 norm suggests .",
    "these modes place most of the field energy inside the dielectric ; they resemble a pair of quadrupole ( e.g. , @xmath157 ) modes in a circular waveguide : that is , the field patterns have nearly ( but not exactly , due to the square lattice ) an azimuthal dependence @xmath158 and @xmath159 for some angle @xmath160 .",
    "if the dielectric were isotropic , these modes would be degenerate , and @xmath160 could be chosen arbitrarily ( since there is a linear combination of the above two terms that yields @xmath161 for any @xmath162 ) . with the anisotropic dielectric ,",
    "the mode frequencies differ by about 0.3% , and so @xmath160 is determined .",
    "it appears that the error is so high because the eigenmodes have a large error in @xmath160 . in other words ,",
    "the field patterns look very similar to the correct fields , except they are rotated slightly .",
    "this is a consequence of the difficulty of eigensolving for nearly - degenerate modes ; as two modes approach degeneracy it becomes impossible to separate them correctly ( without recourse to some other operator ) . in this light",
    ", it is not surprising that when the error in frequency is larger than the actual separation between the two modes , the resulting eigenmodes may be the wrong linear combinations of the exact eigenmodes .",
    "indeed the surface error starts diminishing for modes 4 and 5 approximately when the frequency errors approach 0.3% ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : anisodiscfreqconv ] ) .",
    "second , we generate a set of points on a circle that is a radius @xmath140 outside the interface ; thus each different resolution has a different set of points ; as simulation resolution increases , the points move closer to the actual interface . for each resolution",
    ", the fields are compared to our normative high - resolution simulation . in this case , the error does not vanish with @xmath2 ; in other words , it is @xmath3 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : symacccsurfe ] ) .",
    "this latter conclusion is disquieting for those who want particularly to measure fields at the interface .",
    "however , we point at that the error , although @xmath3 , can be quite low , especially for low dielectric contrast . for dielectric contrast @xmath163 , the relative error in field is less than one percent .",
    "the error drops significantly as one moves away from the interface , and we believe it might be possible to extrapolate the fields from several cells away to find surface fields with vanishing error as @xmath4 .    the wc07 method @xcite , and indeed all the effective fdtd dielectric methods we ve tried , have very similar error convergence , transitioning from second- to first - order at a resolution that decreases as the dielectric contrast increases .",
    "we believe this may explain a discrepancy that has puzzled us : this work and @xcite see first - order error ( in mode frequencies ) for this effective dielectric , while the results of @xcite show second - order error .",
    "the latter uses two anisotropic dielectrics , one with eigenvalues ( 1.45 , 2.81 , 4.98 ) , and another with ( 8.49 , 8.78 , 11.52 ) , both rotated by random orthogonal matrices . at contrast @xmath164 , we do in fact see second - order behavior up to hundreds of cells per wavelength , and for contrasts between other pairs ( e.g. , @xmath165 ) , second - order behavior persists up to higher resolutions than we have explored .",
    "in fact , practically , it must be said that the effective dielectric in @xcite does yield second - order behavior for low - contrast dielectric up to nearly the highest resolutions that one might practically use .",
    "ultimately , however , it has first - order error .    for low contrasts , the local error associated with the dielectric interface does nt see to have much effect , and so the results are similar for different algorithms .      to show that using isotropic dielectric ( instead of anisotropic ) does not change the order of error",
    ", we present frequency convergence results for the same problem in the previous section , except that the dielectric is replaced with an isotropic dielectric @xmath166 .",
    "figure  [ fig : symaccisodiscfreqs ] shows frequency error convergence for @xmath167 and @xmath168 .",
    "the former shows a gradual transition from second - order to first - order error , while the the higher contrast shows just first - order error .",
    "figure [ fig : isospheresconv ] shows frequency convergence for a 3d cubic lattice of isotropic spheres ( @xmath169 ) with @xmath170 and @xmath171 . although the computational requirements prevent exploration over the wide range of resolutions of the 2d simulations , the @xmath170 case shows mostly second - order behavior starting to transition to first - order , while @xmath171 shows nearly first - order behavior .",
    "this is very similar to fig .",
    "[ fig : anisodiscfreqconv ] , considering the resolutions where they overlap .",
    "there is no reason to suspect that error convergence in 3d is any different from 2d .      in this section",
    "we compare the `` new '' method recommended in this paper ( sec .",

    "the main advantage of the new method is that it is always stable ; since wc07 is usually stable for contrasts less than @xmath171 , and can be used practically , we wanted to compare their accuracies .",

    "occasionally , for a problem of low contrast , one sees the error of wc07 plunge at some low resolution ; the same sometimes happens for other methods as well . in this case",
    ", it appears that the frequency error has first- and second - order contributions : @xmath174 .",
    "when @xmath175 and @xmath176 have opposite signs , there is a narrow range of @xmath2 for which the error is nearly zero .",

    "a similar advantage for the new method is also apparent in 3d , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : spheres ] , for sapphire ( anisotropic , @xmath178 ) and isotropic , @xmath167 spheres .",

    "the advantage of the new method remains when the concavity of the dielectric interface changes : figure  [ fig : inversediscs ] shows the advantage of the new method for vacuum discs in a background of @xmath149 .",

    "figure  [ fig : newvssimpleanisodisc ] shows the ratio in frequency errors . for low contrast , we see that the error for wc07mod plunges within a narrow range of resolutions , due to fortuitous cancellation of first- and second - order error ; we note that one can not depend on this cancellation ( it does not occur for all shapes , nor is the range of resolutions predictable ) .",
    "this is illustrated by the convergence of field , where such fortuitous cancellation is much less likely ; there , wc07mod has no less error .",
    "figure  [ fig : newvssimpleanisodiscsurfoute ] shows the ratio of the surface field error of the wc07mod algorithm to that of the new algorithm on a circle at @xmath177 .",
    "this shows that the wc07mod algorithm generally has higher error , and that the factor by which it is worse increases with the number of cells per vacuum wavelength .",
    "we have demonstrated a new fdtd algorithm for simulating electromagnetics in the presence of sharp dielectric transitions ; the new algorithm is generally as accurate or more accurate than previous fdtd algorithms , and it is stable at high dielectric contrast ( unlike the algorithm of @xcite ) .",
    "we showed how to create a stable algorithm , given the ability to form an `` effective '' ( or `` average '' ) @xmath16 dielectric tensor relating any three neighboring components of the @xmath29-field and the @xmath27-field .",
    "as long as each @xmath16 tensor is symmetric and positive definite ( spd ) , the algorithm will be stable .",
    "one can then try to construct spd effective dielectric tensors to achieve the highest accuracy .",
    "we compared three different ways to compute the effective dielectric : a sometimes unstable method , wc07 , described in @xcite ; a small alteration of that method to achieve stability , wc07mod , but still using the dielectric averaging of @xcite ; and a new method based on symmetrizing the asymmetric effective dielectric of @xcite .",
    "all these algorithms ( except @xcite , which is unstable in the time domain ) have first - order error in the grid - cell - size @xmath2 ; that is , the error in mode frequencies and fields at given points decreases ultimately as @xmath5 .",
    "however , at coarse resolutions the error decreases as @xmath1 , before transitioning to @xmath5 . for low dielectric contrast ( less than about 10 )",
    ", the transition point occurs at fairly high resolution , so that for many simulations , these methods may be practically considered to have second - order error .    by examining the convergence of mode fields",
    ", we showed that the fields at fixed points ( fixed as @xmath2 varies ) converge at the same rate as the mode frequencies .",
    "however , when we look at the fields at a fixed cell - distance away from a dielectric interface ( so that the points move closer to the interface as @xmath2 decreases ) , we find that the error is @xmath3it does not decrease with @xmath2 .",
    "this demonstrates two important points .",
    "first , the global error is @xmath5 : the local error in the bulk material is @xmath1 ( due to centered differencing ) , is ( eventually ) eclipsed by the @xmath3 local error at the interface ( due to the discontinuity in fields )",
    ". however , the interface cuts a fraction of cells scaling as @xmath5 , so the ultimate global error ( e.g. , in mode frequency ) in @xmath5 .",
    "heuristically , we can write `` @xmath185 , '' where @xmath96 comes from the interface , and @xmath186 from the bulk ( as well higher order terms from the interface ) .",
    "our results show that @xmath96 can be relatively small for low dielectric contrast , and therefore the error at low resolutions ( large @xmath2 ) appears second - order for a while .",
    "sometimes @xmath96 and @xmath186 may be of opposite signs , in which case the error may plunge briefly for a small range of @xmath2 at the transition between second- and first - order ( but only for frequency error ; field error is not a one - dimensional quantity like frequency , and so the first- and second - order parts can not fortuitously cancel ) .",
    "although we can not prove that the symmetric effective dielectrics used in fdtd simulations must yield ( ultimate ) first - order error , the logic of @xcite strongly hints that should be the case .",
    "reference  @xcite achieved second - order error by demanding local first - order , or @xmath5 , error at the dielectric interface  accomplished by finding an effective dielectric that exactly maps @xmath7 to @xmath8 in the limit of infinite wavelength ( and planar interface ) .",
    "unfortunately , that effective dielectric is asymmetric , and unusable in fdtd codes due to the instability it creates . equally unfortunate",
    ", the symmetric effective dielectrics do not appear to be able to satisfy this property of mapping @xmath7 to @xmath8 exactly in the infinite wavelength limit .",
    "the @xmath3 convergence of error at a fixed cell - distance from the surface could be a problem for finding surface fields with arbitrary accuracy .",
    "however , the error drops rapidly by several cells away from the surface , and we believe that it will be possible to obtain surface fields with arbitrary accuracy by extrapolating from the fields several cells away from the surface .",
    "of course , that extrapolation introduces some error , but we currently believe that the field error plus the extrapolation error can be made to vanish as @xmath4 .",
    "however , a much more thorough study will be needed in the future to determine this issue .",
    "it would be great if we could somehow form a symmetric effective dielectric with the accuracy of the asymmetric effective dielectric of @xcite .",
    "indeed , there are some degrees of freedom one could exploit . for example",
    ", we used a symmetric average of the @xmath52 matrices is sec .",
    "[ sec : stability ] to form @xmath15 .",
    "we could have have used different non - negative coefficients ( not @xmath187 ) that add up to one , without affecting stability ; however , the accuracy within uniform , anisotropic dielectric would be degraded . in principle",
    ", one can vary those coefficients in space ; however , varying them can destroy the symmetry of @xmath15 , so one would need some sort of global solution to attain accuracy and symmetry ( not to mention positive definiteness ) .",
