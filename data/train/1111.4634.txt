    "<S> we obtain the first exact solution for the stationary one - dimensional kardar - parisi - zhang equation . </S>",
    "<S> a formula for the distribution of the height is given in terms of a fredholm determinant , which is valid for any finite time @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> the expression is explicit and compact enough so that it can be evaluated numerically . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , by extending the same scheme , we find an exact formula for the stationary two - point correlation function .    </S>",
    "<S> the dynamics of a growing surface has long been a subject of intense study because of its wide appearance in nature and relevance to material science ; it is also of great theoretical interest as an important example of nonlinear nonequilibrium phenomena @xcite . for a surface </S>",
    "<S> growing only through local interaction , a prototypical equation was proposed by kardar , parisi and zhang ( kpz ) in 1986  @xcite . in this letter </S>",
    "<S> , we focus on its one - dimensional version , @xmath1 here @xmath2 represents the height of the surface at position @xmath3 and time @xmath4 . the last term @xmath5 </S>",
    "<S> is taken to be the gaussian white noise with covariance @xmath6 .    this kpz equation has been well known and has already been studied extensively  @xcite , but interest in this equation has revived  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> first , the efforts to have a better understanding of the equation , which are from various perspectives and have lasted for more than two decades , finally culminated in the achievement of an exact solution for its height distribution @xcite ; second it has turned out that such fine information as the height distribution can be measured experimentally . in @xcite , </S>",
    "<S> takeuchi and sano employed a turbulent liquid crystal as a material and found a clear agreement with theoretical predictions .    in the studies of growing surface , the fluctuations of the height are of primary importance . in many examples </S>",
    "<S> one observes the  kinetic roughening . \" as time goes on the surface becomes rougher and rougher , even if it starts from a completely flat substrate . </S>",
    "<S> this concerns the transient behaviors which are certainly interesting , but even more natural and important is the stationary situation . </S>",
    "<S> most systems eventually reach their own steady states after relaxation times and our understanding of the nonequilibrium steady state ( ness ) is in general so limited that concrete results for a simple system should give us valuable information . </S>",
    "<S> many papers on the kpz equation have addressed its stationary properties with various methods but all attempts to treat this case exactly have so far failed .    in this article </S>",
    "<S> , we provide the first exact results for the kpz equation in the stationary situation . for the kpz equation , </S>",
    "<S> the stationary state is given by the two - sided brownian motion ( bm ) with respect to @xmath7 @xcite : @xmath8 where @xmath9 and @xmath10 are two independent standard bms , as seen in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 1 . </S>",
    "<S> since the system is translationally invariant , one can set without loss of generality the initial height at the origin to be zero , i.e. , @xmath11 . in the following </S>",
    "<S> , we will show the explicit formulas for the height distribution @xmath12 $ ] and the two - point space - time correlation functions of the slope @xmath13 ( fig .  1 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the obtained expressions are explicit enough so that they can be evaluated numerically . </S>",
    "<S> we would say that the main achievements in our paper are that we could draw their figures as given in figs . 2 and 3 below .        </S>",
    "<S> let us briefly recall the theoretical developments so far . </S>",
    "<S> early works using renormalization group ideas and other analytic methods have identified the critical exponents . </S>",
    "<S> it was established that when @xmath0 is large , the fluctuations of the height grow like @xmath14 and the nontrivial equal - time correlations in space are observed on the @xmath15 scale . about a decade ago , it was realized that a few growth models admit a mapping to a combinatorial problem , which allowed us to study their height distributions and their universal scaling limits . in these models </S>",
    "<S> some of the space , time , and height are discrete ; there is a natural ultraviolet cutoff , which makes their analysis somewhat easier . </S>",
    "<S> the most surprising at the time was that the universal height distribution is the same as that of the largest eigenvalue of gaussian ensembles from random matrix theory@xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> but it was only very recently that these developments finally led to the identification of the exact height distributions for the kpz equation itself @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it contains valuable information about finite time behaviors , which has significant relevance to real physical systems because a slow approach to the limiting values for the moments has been observed in experiments as well . for more recent developments , </S>",
    "<S> see , for instance , @xcite .    a most important finding from the exact solution </S>",
    "<S> is that the kpz equation represents the universal crossover between the linear ( @xmath16 ) edwards - wilkinson ( ew ) @xcite and the nonlinear kpz universality classes . </S>",
    "<S> this is realized , for instance , in the fact that the kpz equation is obtained as a weakly asymmetric limit of the asymmetric simple exclusion process ( asep ) . in other words , </S>",
    "<S> the kpz equation describes the behaviors of the asep in a certain time regime  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the asep is a stochastic system of many particles , each of which performs an asymmetric random walk under the constraint of volume exclusion with other particles and is one of the most well - studied nonequilibrium discrete models . </S>",
    "<S> the kpz equation also captures appropriately low temperature behaviors of some discrete random directed polymer models in  @xcite , demonstrating the universality of the equation .    </S>",
    "<S> the first exact solution of the kpz equation was obtained for the narrow wedge initial condition , for which the shape of the surface at finite time is a parabola @xcite . on the other side from the previous studies </S>",
    "<S> , it has been well established that the height distribution depends strongly on the geometry of the system and its initial conditions @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in particular it is crucial whether the macroscopic shape of the surface is curved or flat . </S>",
    "<S> this was confirmed in an experiment as well @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> hence , it is obviously important to extend the exact results to other cases , which is not at all trivial . </S>",
    "<S> the analysis in @xcite was based on a previous exact result of the asep  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the asep has been extensively studied , but the studies of its fluctuation properties are fairly involved , and there are not so many generalizations obtained so far .    in the meantime the same expression for the narrow wedge initial condition was rederived by using a replica method @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the replica method is well known to be powerful for studying systems with randomness but is also known to possess a serious difficulty related to the analytic continuation for the replica number . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly enough , for the kpz equation , though there appear divergent sums during the computations one finally arrives at the correct finite expression . </S>",
    "<S> hence , a replica analysis of the kpz problem should be useful for clearer understanding of replica method in general . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , this approach has turned out to be more suited for various generalizations . </S>",
    "<S> in fact multipoint distributions were studied in @xcite and , more recently , the flat initial condition was treated in @xcite . in the present letter , we study the stationary case by a nontrivial extension of this replica approach . by a set of scalings of space , time , and height , @xmath17 , we can and will do set @xmath18 .    </S>",
    "<S> now , we start to explain our solutions . the main object in this letter is the height distribution function defined by @xmath19 where @xmath20 . </S>",
    "<S> note that this reflects previous studies : the average is given by @xmath21 , and the fluctuation scales like @xmath14 from the kpz scaling . </S>",
    "<S> it has not been clear how one can take the average over the bm initial condition directly , or if it is possible at all . </S>",
    "<S> the novel strategy here in studying the stationary state is that we first consider a generalized initial condition and then retrieve the desired information from the results for it . </S>",
    "<S> the initial condition we consider is @xmath22 where @xmath23 are the strength of the drifts . </S>",
    "<S> once this generalized case is solved , then the stationary case can be accessed by taking the @xmath24 limit . applying the cole - hopf transformation , @xmath25 , </S>",
    "<S> the kpz equation ( [ kpz ] ) is linearized as @xmath26 this can be interpreted as a problem of a directed polymer in random media ; @xmath27 is its partition function . </S>",
    "<S> we consider the @xmath28th replica partition function @xmath29 and compute their generating function @xmath30 defined as @xmath31 using the feynman path integral representation of @xmath27 and taking the average with respect to the random potential @xmath32 , the replica partition function can be written in a form , @xmath33 . </S>",
    "<S> here @xmath34 represents the state with all @xmath28 particles being at the position @xmath7 and @xmath35 , the initial state . for the kpz equation , </S>",
    "<S> the hamiltonian @xmath36 turns out to be that of the delta - function bose gas with attractive interaction @xcite , @xmath37 the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions can be constructed by using the bethe ansatz  @xcite . for a set of quasimomenta @xmath38 s , the eigenvalue @xmath39 is given by @xmath40 and the eigenfunction by @xmath41 + @xmath42 , where @xmath43 is the set of permutations with @xmath28 elements and @xmath44 is the normalization constant . for the @xmath45-bose gas with attractive interaction , </S>",
    "<S> the quasimomenta @xmath46 are in general complex numbers and are aligned in the form of  strings \"  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the completeness of these bethe states was proved very recently @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we will compute this moment by expanding as @xmath47 .    because the brownian motion is a gaussian process </S>",
    "<S> , one can perform the average over the initial distribution ( [ init_drift ] ) and the inner product of @xmath48 can also be explicitly calculated under the condition @xmath49 . </S>",
    "<S> it includes the summation over @xmath43 coming from the bethe eigenstate , which looks highly nontrivial but we have found that there is a combinatorial formula which factorizes it  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we obtain @xmath50 now we can follow the arguments in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we further modify the expression of the replica partition function and write it in terms of a determinant by using the cauchy s determinant formula . </S>",
    "<S> after some computation , one arrives at an expression for the generating function . for the narrow wedge @xcite and the half bm initial condition @xcite , this generating function itself is written as a fredholm determinant , but this time it is not because of the novel factor @xmath51 . </S>",
    "<S> the difficulty can be avoided by considering a further generalized initial condition for the kpz equation in which the initial overall height @xmath52 obeys a certain probability distribution . </S>",
    "<S> a similar argument was already used for other discrete models @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> if we denote the height with this initial distribution by @xmath53 , we have @xmath54 , where @xmath55 is the original height for which @xmath11 . </S>",
    "<S> the random variable @xmath52 is taken to be independent of @xmath55 and hence the @xmath28th moment of @xmath56 factorizes as @xmath57 . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the probability distribution functions @xmath58 $ ] and @xmath59 $ ] are related as @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the laplace transform of the pdf of @xmath52 , and we assume @xmath62 can be taylor expanded around @xmath63 . here </S>",
    "<S> it should be noticed that if @xmath64 obeys the inverse gamma distribution with parameter @xmath65 , i.e. , if @xmath66 obeys the gamma distribution with the same parameter , its @xmath28th moment is given by @xmath67 , which exactly compensates for the extra factor above . </S>",
    "<S> hence the generating function @xmath68 corresponding to @xmath53 can be written as a fredholm determinant . </S>",
    "<S> following the arguments in @xcite , one can recover the information of the distribution for @xmath53 from the generating function @xmath69 . combining this and a fact @xmath70 for the case where @xmath64 is the inverse gamma random variable with parameter @xmath71 , we find that the height distribution for the initial condition ( [ init_drift ] ) is given by @xmath72 .   </S>",
    "<S> \\label{result}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath73 is expressed as a difference of two fredholm determinants , @xmath74 where @xmath75 represents the projection onto @xmath76 , @xmath77 and @xmath78 where @xmath79 represents the contour from @xmath80 to @xmath81 which , along the way , passes below the pole at @xmath82 .    with this expression </S>",
    "<S> it is not hard to do analytic continuation for @xmath23 to their negative regions and then take the @xmath24 limit to study the stationary situation . </S>",
    "<S> our result for the height distribution for the stationary kpz equation is written as @xmath83 % = % f_{0,t}(s ) = \\frac{1}{\\gamma(1+\\gamma_t^{-1}d / ds ) } \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty } du \\gamma_t   e^{\\gamma_t(s - u ) + e^{-\\gamma_t(s - u)}}\\nu_{0,t}(u ) . </S>",
    "<S> \\label{result}\\ ] ] here @xmath84 is obtained from @xmath73 by taking @xmath24 limit as in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> details will be given elsewhere @xcite . by using this formula </S>",
    "<S> , one can numerically evaluate the distribution . in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2 , we plot this distribution ( [ result ] ) for @xmath85 . </S>",
    "<S> once we have the formula for finite @xmath0 , it is not difficult to consider the scaling limit . in our setting </S>",
    "<S> , it can be studied simply by taking @xmath86 . </S>",
    "<S> one can confirm that it tends to @xmath87 as given in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this function already appeared in the studies of lattice growth models and describes the stationary height distribution in the scaling limit @xcite .    . </S>",
    "<S> the dashed curve is @xmath87 . </S>",
    "<S> the dots ( @xmath88 ) indicate the monte carlo simulation for wasep . </S>",
    "<S> we set the difference between left and right hopping rates 0.15 with their sum normalized to be unity , @xmath89 monte carlo steps ( corresponding to @xmath85 ) , and 10000 samples . ]    </S>",
    "<S> it is not hard to generalize our analysis to the height near the origin . from the kpz </S>",
    "<S> scaling , the nontrivial correlation is expected on @xmath15 scale , and we can see that the height distribution at @xmath90 with @xmath91 finite is written as the same form as in ( [ result ] ) with its kernel slightly modified to include @xmath91 . </S>",
    "<S> this can be readily used to obtain the exact formula for the stationary two - point correlations . </S>",
    "<S> let us set @xmath92 . </S>",
    "<S> one can check that the second derivative of this function with respect to @xmath7 is , in fact , twice the two - point correlation : @xmath93 . from the kpz </S>",
    "<S> scaling , we also introduce the scaled version , @xmath94 . plotted in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3 is the second derivative of this function @xmath95 . in the scaling limit </S>",
    "<S> , it tends to the function @xmath96 , which was studied before in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> more discussions will be given in @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> here we remark that in statistical mechanics , computing the dynamical correlation functions is one of the most important objectives of the theory . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , in the kubo formula , one needs the dynamical current - current correlation function in equilibrium . </S>",
    "<S> this is already known to be very difficult in general and it is even more interesting and challenging to compute the dynamical correlation for nonequilibrium systems , in particular in its stationary state . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , the fourier transform of the two - point function is known as the structure function , which can be measured directly using ( e.g. , neutron ) scattering experiments .     for the kpz equation for @xmath85 . </S>",
    "<S> the dashed curve represents the one in the scaling limit @xmath97 . </S>",
    "<S> the dots indicates the monte carlo result of the wasep , where parameters are the same as those in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2 . ]    </S>",
    "<S> our exact results represent the universal crossover for the kpz equation with @xmath0 being a parameter . </S>",
    "<S> as explained above , in a certain time regime , the fluctuation properties of the weakly asep ( wasep ) are described by the kpz equation . </S>",
    "<S> we confirmed this by comparing our theoretical predictions with monte carlo simulations of the wasep ( figs . 2 and 3 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the dots in figs . </S>",
    "<S> 2 and 3 represent the monte carlo results for the current distribution and density - density correlation in the wasep respectively .    to summarize </S>",
    "<S> , we have found the first explicit formulas for the height distribution and the two - point correlation functions for the kpz equation in its stationary regime . </S>",
    "<S> they are explicit enough to allow numerical evaluations as depicted in figs . 2 and 3 . </S>",
    "<S> one observes nontrivial deviations from the scaling limit . </S>",
    "<S> they contain valuable information about the finite @xmath0 corrections which should be observed in real experiments . </S>",
    "<S> one possibility to realize the stationary situation in an experiment is to use again the liquid crystal turbulence because the system is fairy flexible for setting a desired initial condition by adjusting a shape of the laser pulse . </S>",
    "<S> it might also be possible to observe our prediction by performing a careful experiment of paper combustion for which the stationary situation was already studied in a previous publication @xcite . </S>"
