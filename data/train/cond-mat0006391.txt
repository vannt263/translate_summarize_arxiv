    "recently , the problems of information science were investigated from statistical mechanical point of view . among them , the image restoration is one of the most suitable subjects . in the standard approach to the image restoration ,",
    "an estimate of the original image is given by maximizing a posterior probability distribution ( the map estimate ) @xcite .",
    "in the context of statistical mechanics , this approach corresponds to finding the ground state configuration of the effective hamiltonian for some spin system under the random fields . on the other hand , it is possible to construct another strategy to infer the original image using the thermal equilibrium state of the hamiltonian . from the bayesian statistical point of view , the _ finite temperature restoration _ coincides with maximizing a posterior marginal distribution ( the mpm estimate @xcite ) and using this strategy , the error for each pixel may become smaller than that of the map estimate . as we use the average of each pixel ( spin ) over the boltzmann - gibbs distribution at a specific temperature , the thermal fluctuation should play an important role in the mpm estimate .",
    "then , the temperature controls the shape of the distribution and if we choose the temperature appropriately , the sampling from the distribution generates the important configurations for a fine restoration . besides this hill - climbing mechanism by the thermal fluctuation , we may use another type of fluctuation , namely , the quantum fluctuation which leads to quantum tunneling between the states . if we use the sampling from the boltzmann - gibbs distribution based on the quantum fluctuation , it may be possible to obtain much more effective configurations for a good restoration .",
    "the idea of the mrf s model using the quantum fluctuation was recently proposed by tanaka and horiguchi @xcite , however , they investigated the quantum fluctuation in the context of the optimization ( the map estimate by the quantum fluctuation ) and they used the ground state as the estimate of the original image .",
    "we would like to stress that we use the distribution based on the quantum fluctuation itself and the expectation value is used to infer the original image .",
    "it is highly non - trivial problem to investigate whether the mpm estimate based on the quantum fluctuation becomes better than the map estimate or the thermal fluctuation based mpm estimate .",
    "this is a basic concept of this paper .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in the next sec .",
    "ii , we explain our model system and the basic idea of our method in detail . in sec .",
    "ii , we also introduce the criterion of the restoration , that is , the overlap between the original image and the result of the restoration . in sec .",
    "iii , we introduce the infinite range model in order to obtain analytical results on the performance of the restoration , and calculate the overlap explicitly . in sec .",
    "iv , we show that quantum monte carlo simulations in 2-dimension support our analytical results . in sec .",
    "v , we introduce the iterative algorithm which is derived by mean - field approximation and apply this algorithm to image restoration for standard pictures . the last sec .",
    "vi is devoted to discussion about all results we obtain . in this section",
    ", we also mention the inequality which gives the upper bound of the overlap .",
    "let us suppose that the original image is represented by a configuration of ising spins @xmath0 with probability @xmath1 .",
    "these images are sent through the noisy channel by the form of sequence @xmath2 .",
    "then , we regard the output of the sequence @xmath2 through the noisy channel as @xmath3 .",
    "the output probability for the case of the binary symmetric channel ( bsc ) is specified by the following form ; @xmath4 we easily understand the relevance of this expression for the bsc ; lets suppose that each pixel @xmath5 changes its sign with probability @xmath6 and remains with @xmath7 during the transmission , that is , @xmath8 we easily see that there is a simple relation between flip probability @xmath6 and inverse temperature @xmath9 as @xmath10 .",
    "this is reason why we refer to this type of noise as _ binary symmetric _ channel . using the assumption that each pixel @xmath11 in the original image @xmath12 is corrupted independently ( so - called _ memory - less channel _ ) ,",

    "this bsc is simply extended to the following gaussian channel ( gc ) @xmath14 where @xmath15 is a standard deviation of observable ( corrupted pixel ) @xmath16 from scaled original pixel @xmath17 .",
    "then , the posterior probability @xmath18 , which is the probability that the source sequence is @xmath19 provided that the output is @xmath3 , leads to @xmath20 by the bayes theorem . as we treat the bw image and the bsc ( [ poutbc ] ) , a likelihood @xmath21 is appropriately written by @xmath22 @xmath23 appearing in the bayesian formula ( [ pcond ] ) is a model of the prior distribution @xmath24 and we usually use the following type ; @xmath25 where @xmath26 means the sum with respect to the nearest neighboring pixels and @xmath27 controls the smoothness of the picture according to our assumption . substituting eqs .",
