    "polytopes whose vertices have coordinates in @xmath14 ( _ 0/1-polytopes _ ) are the objects of study in large parts of polyhedral combinatorics ( see  @xcite ) . since that theory has started to grow , people have been interested in the _ graphs _ ( defined by the vertices and the one - dimensional faces ) of the polytopes under investigation .",
    "the main reason for this interest was , of course , the role played by polytope graphs with respect to linear programming and , in particular , the simplex algorithm .",
    "later it was recognized that the graphs of the 0/1-polytopes associated with certain combinatorial objects ( such as matchings in a graph or bases of a matroid ) might also yield good candidates for neighborhood structures with respect to the construction of random walks for random generation of the respective objects .",
    "a quite important ( yet unsolved ) problem arising in this context is the question whether the graphs of 0/1-polytopes have good expansion properties ( see @xcite ) .",
    "we are short of knowledge on the graphs of _ general _ 0/1-polytopes  @xcite . among the few exceptions are results about their diameters @xcite and their cycle structures @xcite .",
    "particularly striking is the fact that several _ special _",
    "0/1-polytopes associated with combinatorial problems have quite dense graphs .",
    "the most prominent example for this is probably the _ cut polytope _ @xmath15 , i.e. , the convex hull of the characteristic vectors of those subsets of edges of the complete graph @xmath16 that form cuts in @xmath16 .",
    "barahona and mahjoub  @xcite proved that the graph of @xmath15 is complete , i.e. , its density equals one ( where the _ density _ of a graph @xmath17 is @xmath18 ) .",
    "since the dimension of @xmath15 is @xmath19 and there are @xmath20 cuts in @xmath16 , the cut polytopes yield an infinite series of @xmath12-dimensional 0/1-polytopes with ( roughly ) @xmath21 vertices ( for some constant @xmath22 ) and graph - density one .    in this paper",
    ", we investigate the question for the graph - density of a typical ( i.e. , random ) 0/1-polytope .",
    "the ( perhaps surprising ) result is that in fact the high density of the graphs of several 0/1-polytopes important in polyhedral combinatorics ( such as the cut polytopes ) is not atypical at all .",
    "our main result is the following theorem , where @xmath23}$ ] denotes the expected value .",
    "[ thm : dens ] let @xmath24 be a function , and let @xmath25 with an @xmath7-element subset @xmath26 of @xmath2 that is chosen uniformly at random . denote by @xmath8 the density of the graph of @xmath27 .    1 .",

    "2 .   if there is some @xmath10 such that @xmath30 for all sufficiently large @xmath12 , then @xmath29}=0      $ ] .",
    "there is a similar threshold phenomenon for the volumes of random 0/1-polytopes .",
    "let @xmath31 be the convex hull of @xmath7 points in @xmath2 that are chosen independently uniformly at random ( possibly with repetitions ) .",
    "dyer , fredi , and mcdiarmid  @xcite proved that the limit ( for @xmath9 ) of the expected value of the @xmath12-dimensional volume of @xmath31 is zero if , for some @xmath10 , @xmath32 holds for all sufficiently large @xmath12 , and it is one if , for some @xmath10 , @xmath33 holds for all sufficiently large  @xmath12 . due to @xmath34 and @xmath35 , one can deduce ( we omit the details ) the following result from this and theorem  [ thm : dens ] .",
    "it may be a bit surprising due to the fact that the only @xmath12-dimensional 0/1-polytope with @xmath12-dimensional volume equal to one is the 0/1-cube @xmath36 , which has only graph - density @xmath37 .    for every @xmath38",
    "there are ( infinitely many ) 0/1-polytopes with both graph density and volume at least @xmath39 .",
    "another threshold result that is related to our work is due to fredi  @xcite .",
    "he showed that , in the setting of theorem  [ thm : dens ] , the limit ( for @xmath9 ) of the probability that @xmath27 contains the center of the 0/1-cube is zero if , for some @xmath10 , @xmath40 holds for all sufficiently large @xmath12 , and it is one if , for some @xmath10 , @xmath41 holds for all sufficiently large @xmath12 . the material in sections  [ subsec : hyperplane ] , [ subsec : bounds ] , and  [ subsec : thresh ] of our paper is very much inspired by fredi s work .    the aim of sections  [ sec : tau ] and  [ sec : p ] is to prove theorem  [ thm : dens ] . since it is a bit more convenient , we switch from 0/1-polytopes to polytopes whose vertices have coordinates in @xmath42 ( _ @xmath43-polytopes _ ) . recalling that the density of a graph equals the probability of a randomly chosen pair of its nodes to be adjacent , propositions  [ prop : pthrlow ] and  [ prop : pthrup ] ( section  [ sec : p ] ) , together with proposition  [ prop : pmonotone ] , imply theorem  [ thm : dens ] ( with the @xmath44 s in propositions  [ prop : pthrlow ] and  [ prop : pthrup ] replaced by @xmath45 and @xmath46 , respectively ) .",
    "we close with a few remarks in section  [ sec : rem ] .",
    "we define @xmath47 and @xmath48 ( where @xmath49 is the all - one vector ) . for @xmath50 , denote by @xmath51 the subset of all points in @xmath52 that agree with  @xmath53 and  @xmath54 in all components , where  @xmath53 and  @xmath54 agree .",
    "thus , @xmath51 is the vertex set of the smallest face of @xmath55 containing  @xmath53 and  @xmath54 .",

    "in fact , we will basically compute ( or estimate ) the probability @xmath77 ( see section  [ sec : p ] ) that two randomly chosen vertices of a @xmath12-dimensional random @xmath43-polytope with  @xmath1 vertices are adjacent by partitioning the probability space into the events `` @xmath78 and @xmath79 '' for all @xmath74 and @xmath75 .    for the study of @xmath69 , it is convenient to consider the conditional probability @xmath80}\\ , \\ ] ] which is related to @xmath69 in the following way .",
    "[ lem : tau2 ] for @xmath81 we have @xmath82    clearly , @xmath83 implies @xmath84 .",

    "we will first show that @xmath88 can be interpreted as a conditional probability that a random @xmath66-element subset of a certain vector configuration in @xmath89 does not contain the origin in its convex hull ( section  [ subsec : vecconfig ] ) .",
