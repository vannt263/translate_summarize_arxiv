    "zheng conducted different numerical experiments which led to estimates of exponents @xmath8 , @xmath9 ( where @xmath10 is the so - called fisher - huse exponent ) , and @xmath11 . from all direct measurements of @xmath8",
    "he concluded that @xmath3 . using this value",
    ", he found an estimate of @xmath10 in agreement with the ncop value ( @xmath12 whereas @xmath13 ) .",
    "thus , the only strong departure from the ncop values is for exponent @xmath8 .",
    "therefore , in the following , we focus on growth law of @xmath5 in large systems at late times ( as opposed to the early - time approach favored by zheng ) .    in order to reach late times satisfactorily , we need a better control of the conservation of energy than with the simple second - order scheme used by zheng . the following results were obtained with a third - order bilateral symplectic algorithm @xcite with a timestep @xmath14 .",
    "the conservation of initial energy is better than @xmath15 in relative value in all runs presented . to investigate phase - ordering",
    ", we use the same initial conditions as zheng ( @xmath16 where the sign is random and @xmath17 calculated to yield the desired energy density @xmath18 ) .",
    "we present results for two sets of parameter values , @xmath19 ( set a , used by zheng ) , and @xmath20 ( set b , used in @xcite ) .",
    "the initial energy density ( @xmath21 for set a , and @xmath22 for set b ) , was chosen very close to its minimum value allowed by the random - sign initial conditions ( @xmath23 for set a , and @xmath24 for set b ) .",
    "this ensures that `` thermal '' fluctuations are minimized , since the energy density is then as far as possible from the critical energy density @xmath25 ( @xmath26 for set a , and @xmath27 for set b ) .",
    "the typical domain size @xmath5 was determined by the mid - height value of @xmath28 , the normalized two - point correlation function calculated for simplicity along the principal axes of the lattice using the continuous field @xmath29 or the reduced `` spin '' variable @xmath30 : @xmath31 .",
    "( no significant difference was found between the two cases , and only results using @xmath32 are shown below . )",
    "we first checked that dynamical scaling holds by observing the collapse of @xmath33 curves at different times after some transient ( not shown ) @xcite .",
    "for both sets of parameters , the expected ncop law ( @xmath34 , i.e. @xmath35 ) is reached at late times , but a rather long transient is observed , especially for set  a ( fig .",
    "[ f1]ab ) .",
    "the same data plotted in logarithmic scales is thus misleading . if the data for set b reach the `` normal '' scaling ( see fig .",
    "[ f1]d and its inset ) at late times , the corresponding plot for parameter set a ( fig .",
    "[ f1]c ) seems to indicate a value of @xmath4 between @xmath36 and @xmath37 ( typical of the value estimated by zheng ) if one ignores the systematic trend upward of the local exponent ( see inset of fig .  [",
    "f1]c ) @xcite .      following zheng , we also measured the decay of the autocorrelation function @xmath38 , but , again , for rather large systems and late times , choosing , in particular , initial reference times @xmath39 larger than the `` microscopic '' transient time . in the usual ncop phase ordering framework , we expect @xmath40^{\\lambda } \\sim   \\left(\\frac{t_0}{t}\\right)^{\\lambda / z}\\ ] ] where the fisher - huse exponent @xmath41 . again , plotting @xmath42 vs @xmath43 for parameter set a may yields an `` effective '' exponent @xmath9 smaller than its ncop value ( and close to the value given by zheng ) , but a closer look reveals a systematic increase of the instantaneous exponent ( fig .",
    "[ f2]a and inset ) .",
    "however , plotting @xmath44 vs @xmath5 , the expected scaling is observed ( fig .",
    "considering now parameter set b , the expected scaling laws are observed rather easily ( fig .",
    "[ f2]b , d ) .",
    "this confirms further that for the parameter values chosen by zheng , the onset of the asymptotic scaling regime is delayed .      for the sake of completeness , and in order to probe the validity of the early - time scaling approach taken by zheng",
    ", we also performed numerical simulations to measure the short - time growth of the squared magnetization @xmath45 ( @xmath46 being defined as the spatial average of either @xmath47 or @xmath48 ) for samples with zero initial magnetization . in this case , for ncop scaling , we expect @xmath49 .",
    "our data on logarithmic scales barely reaches the expected behavior at @xmath50 ( fig .",
    "[ f3]a , b ) .",
    "note that the corrections have different sign for the two parameter sets . on linear scales , however , our data reveals the expected proportionality of @xmath51 and @xmath52 ( fig .",
    "[ f3]c , d ) .",
    "the above results show that domain growth in the microcanonical @xmath0 model eventually falls into the ncop universality class ( @xmath35 , @xmath41 ) after some possibly long transient behavior . in this section",
    ", we suggest that there are two main factors at the origin of these corrections to scaling : space discretization and energy conservation .      for the sets of parameters studied by zheng ( notably parameter set a )",
    ", domain growth initially appears to be slower than the expected ncop law ( the effective value of @xmath8 measured at short times is larger than two ) .",
    "this is similar to earlier observations on coupled map lattices , both for the ncop and cop cases .",
    "first measurements of domain growth seemed to indicate slower growth in those discrete - space , discrete - time chaotic models @xcite , but it was shown later that this non - trivial scaling is only transient and that , for late - enough times , normal scaling is recovered @xcite .",
    "it was also argued that these long transients gradually disappear in the continuous - space limit which is well - defined in these systems @xcite .    here ,",
    "it is easy to observe that , increasing @xmath53 ( and @xmath54 , since there is only one free parameter ) , the slowing - down of domain growth due to lattice effects diminishes , as suggested by the difference between parameter sets a and b. for parameter set b , the transient actually presents faster growth than asymptotically : corrections to scaling are dominated by another phenomenon , stronger than lattice effects .      the ( conserved ) total energy in the system can be partitioned into three components , kinetic , potential , and interaction energy : @xmath55 as domain growth proceeds following random initial conditions , the interaction energy decreases with time as a large part of it is contained in the interfaces separating domains , the density of which decreases like @xmath56 .",
    "potential decreases and kinetic energy increases ( fig .",
    "[ f4 ] ) .",
    "starting from `` ordered '' initial conditions ( all sites in the same phase , e.g. @xmath57 ) , the three components of the total energy are almost constant , except for a slight ( quasi logarithmic in time ) increase of interaction energy and decrease of potential energy due to the nucleation of `` thermal '' droplets and to relaxation further into potential wells .",
    "this effect is indeed larger for parameter set a for which the minimal possible energy density @xmath58 is further away from the critical energy density , leading to stronger thermal fluctuations than for parameter set b.      kinetic energy can be interpreted as a temperature in the microcanonical context @xcite .",
    "we can thus see the observed increase of kinetic energy as an increase of the temperature of the system .",
    "for the ( canonical ) ising model , it is well known @xcite that the prefactor of the growth law of @xmath59 decreases to zero as the temperature approaches its critical value .",
    "we suggest to see the growth law observed here for the @xmath0 model as including a `` temperature - dependent '' prefactor : @xmath60 quantitatively ( fig .",
    "[ f4 ] ) , the kinetic energy seems to reach its asymptotic value like : @xmath61    assuming its analyticity , we can write the prefactor @xmath62 : @xmath63 where @xmath64 is the asymptotic ( @xmath65 ) prefactor of the domain growth law . injecting ( [ deltae ] ) and ( [ expand ] ) into ( [ growth ] ) , we finally expect the following ansatz to hold for the domain growth law : @xmath66    equation  ( [ ansatz ] ) provides excellent fits to our data for the growth of @xmath59 .",
    "we find @xmath67 , @xmath68 , and @xmath69 for parameter set a ( with @xmath70 and correlation coefficient 0.99996 ) , and @xmath71 , @xmath72 , and @xmath73 ( with @xmath74 and correlation coefficient 0.9997 ) for parameter set b.    the corrective terms have opposite signs in both cases : this indicates that eq .",
    "( [ ansatz ] ) is only relevant for parameter set b , because , in analogy with the ising model , only negative values of @xmath75 are allowed ( the prefactor of the growth law decreases with increasing temperature ) .",
    "a first conclusion is thus that the main corrections to scaling for parameter set a ( typical of those used by zheng ) are due to lattice effects and are _ not _ consequences of the conservation of global energy .",
    "we note that , similarly , a fit of domain growth in coupled map lattices also yields positive values of @xmath75 , indicating that this sign is a signature of lattice effects @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , the above framework does provide the relevant explanation for the corrections to scaling observed for parameter set b , which can thus be traced back to the fluxes between the various components of the energy induced by the decrease of interfaces between domains as phase - ordering proceeds .",
    "in this comment , we have shown that zheng reached erroneous conclusions when studying phase ordering in the microcanonical lattice @xmath0 model .",
    "this system , like other chaotic , deterministic , dynamical systems presenting phase ordering , does display the expected domain growth scaling laws , i.e. those of the non - conserved order parameter case ( model  a , @xmath35 , @xmath41 ) .",
    "we have shown further that the main influence of the conservation of energy is to introduce corrections to scaling , but that the long transients which plagued zheng s approach are due to lattice effects .",
    "zheng offered , as an explanation for his non - conventional results , that the system considered falls into the class of model  c , where a conserved density is coupled to the order parameter @xcite .",
    "studies of phase - ordering in model  c @xcite show that model  b - like , but also model  a - like behavior can be observed . in this context , the microcanonical @xmath0 lattice can be considered as a model  c system quenched into its `` bistable region '' ( where @xmath35 is observed @xcite ) .",
    "since @xmath5 is precisely defined as the midheight value of @xmath76 , it is in our opinion not so surprising that we obtain already a good collapse before the scaling regime sets in . in this sense",
    "our appoach is different from that of zheng who tried to collapse @xmath77 .    of course",
    ", plotting the quantity of interest against @xmath78 and looking for a straight line is not the most accurate way of determining @xmath8 ( here we use this only because the log - log plots do not exhibit a constant asymptotic slope ) .",
    "nevertheless , the value @xmath79 measured by zheng can safely be rejected since the local slope of @xmath5 against @xmath80 increases with time ( not shown here ) ."

    "<S> the ising model is prototypical of the non - conserved case , and so should be the lattice @xmath0 model , at least in the usual canonical ensemble point of view . </S>",

    "<S> , the question is whether the phase ordering of model c @xcite is in the same universality class as model  a.    using numerical simulations in the so - called `` early - time '' regime , zheng confirmed that the usual dynamical scaling laws seem to hold , but with exponents at odds with those both the non - conserved order parameter ( ncop ) and the conserved order parameter ( cop ) class @xcite . </S>",
