    "constraints on the character and occurrence of precursor emission from gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) offer insight into the nature of the explosions . on timescales of hours to seconds before a burst , precursor emission could occur from the central engines themselves , by , for example , blackbody emission from the early fireball @xcite or a pre - fireball created in the merger of neutron stars @xcite . if grbs were to occur from stellar disruption around a massive black hole",
    "@xcite , then thermal precursors ( @xmath5 ev ) which decay as power - laws ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) might be expected if other stars are disrupted by the same black hole .",
    "if grbs arise from the death of massive stars , the progenitor star ( or its companion , if the progenitor is in a binary system ) could produce precursor emission in the form of novae or supernovae ( sne ) .",
    "a precursor sn is a generic prediction of the so - called `` supranova '' scenario @xcite . in the supranova scenario ,",
    "a massive stellar progenitor explodes to produce an sn , leaving behind a supermassive spinning neutron star .",
    "the neutron star eventually collapses to form a black hole and a grb .",
    "@xcite posited the supranova picture as a means to pre - evacuate the space around the grb explosion and avoid baryonic contamination to the relativistic blastwave . aside from this theoretical consideration , the supranova scenario is attractive for two observational reasons .",
    "first , the sequence of events in this scenario is a natural means to explain transient x - ray features attributed to dense sub - relativistic matter streaming away at distance of @xmath610@xmath7 cm from the explosion site ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "second , the gas behind the sn shock can be thermalized by the time the grb fireball sweeps through , leading to an apparent constant density medium in afterglow modeling @xcite .",
    "this would then explain why grbs from massive stars would typically not show evidence for a wind - blown medium surrounding most bursts ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . while the significance of some of the x - ray features has been questioned ( e.g. , *",
    "* ) and winds are generally not ruled out statistically through afterglow modeling @xcite , the possibility of a precursor sn on timescales of days @xcite to years is a prime motivation to search for precursor emission from grbs .    as summarized in @xcite , archival photographic plate searches ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) for optical precursors ( in the context of recurrence of counterpart emission ) revealed only a few genuine astrophysical sources , with no definitive establishment of a physically - associated precursor to any grb .",
    "using pre - images of the fields of seven _ burst and transient source experiment _",
    "( batse ) grbs from the explosive transient camera , @xcite found no precursors to @xmath8mag .",
    "@xcite presented eight upper limits to precursor emission , at @xmath9mag , within 12 hrs preceding batse bursts . had a genuine transient",
    "been found before a grb , the large grb error boxes ( typically much larger than tens of sq .",
    "arcminutes ) would have required an association based upon probabilistic arguments . since the chance for unrelated transients to occur in grb error boxes is non - negligible , the large batse error boxes all but prevented an unambiguous association with the grbs themselves .    since 1997 , over forty grbs have been localized to the sub - arcsecond level by way of transient afterglow emission .",
    "this , coupled with the growing number of large - area survey projects ( @xmath10 steradian ) , dramatically increases the likelihood of deep pre - imaging of grb positions .",
    "pre - imaging from near - earth asteroid surveys allowed @xcite to show that the transient optical source sdss j124602.54 + 011318.8 was not an orphan afterglow @xcite , but instead was a rare class of agn .",
    "recently , @xcite suggested that with an increased frequency of grb localizations from _ swift _ @xcite and very deep large - field optical imaging surveys such as the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; @xcite ) and panstarrs @xcite , constraints could routinely be placed on sn ( or , more generally , sn - like ) precursors to grbs .",
    "other than progenitor scenarios where a sn precedes a grb , we stress that few models exist that make specific predictions ( e.g. , of light curves , spectra , start times relative the grb ) for precursor emission . to this end",
    ", we have undertaken an exploratory study of public pre - imaging to search for any optical precursor transients at grb positions .",
    "here , we present pre - imaging observations of 11 grbs . by focusing on those bursts with known redshift",
    "we can translate the derived upper limits into absolute magnitudes in co - moving time . in most bursts , the upper limit to optical precursor emission is @xmath335 magnitudes brighter than the brightest supernovae known , but comparable to afterglow brightnesses .",
    "these derived upper limits are consistent with the known ( fainter ) brightnesses of the respective grb host galaxies , later found at the transient positions .",
    "most of the pre - imaging data presented herein were obtained by the neat program @xcite . from december 1995 to february 1999 , the neat camera was mounted on the 1-m geodss telescope in haleakala , maui , hawaii . from february 2000 onward , the camera was then mounted on the maui space surveillance site ( msss ) 1.2-m telescope .",
    "another neat camera began operation on the oschin 48 inch schmidt telescope at palomar observatory .",
    "briefly , the neat imager on palomar consists of three 4080 @xmath11 4080",
    "1.0/pixel ccd arrays covering approximately 1.13 @xmath11 1.13 deg@xmath12 .",
    "typical exposure times are 2060 seconds and the images are unfiltered , giving a broad spectral response from 40009000  .",
    "a 60 second exposure reaches @xmath13mag ( 3 @xmath4 ) , depending on sky brightness .",
    "we also examined the digital sky survey ii ( dss - ii ) scans of the photographic palomar sky survey @xcite .",
    "for the 30 grbs with a known redshift , we queried the public neat data archive , retrieving all data which predated the respective burst trigger date .",
    "imaging data for 11 grbs were found in the neat archive , all with at least one epoch of high enough quality to produce good photometry .",
    "the amount of available data for each grb ranged from 3 to 80 individual 8@xmath11 8  images with exposure times between 20 sec and 150 sec .",
    "the data for each grb were first aligned with sub - pixel accuracy to the same astrometric grid using bi - linear interpolation .",
    "a triangle matching algorithm was used to determine a transformation between each frame and a common reference image by taking into account translation , rotation , and magnification .",
    "a wcs astrometric solution was fit to the aligned images using reference stars from the usno - a2.0 astrometric catalog starting from the approximate center - of - field and plate scale .",
    "the photometric zeropoint for each image was estimated in the @xmath14- and @xmath1-band by comparison with the magnitudes given in the usno - a2.0 . while the photometric errors on individual catalog magnitudes is large ( @xmath15mag ) , a number of stars typically larger than 100 was utilized in order to accurately derive the photometric zeropoint for each frame .",
    "the individual images were photometered at the known position of the ot using apertures of radius @xmath16fwhm of the seeing @xcite and local sky subtraction based on an annulus of radii 15 and 30 pixels .",
    "photometric limits were estimated for each image by analyzing the histogram of flux in 1500 apertures of radius @xmath16fwhm of the seeing placed randomly within the image .",
    "iterative sigma clipping was used to reject flux values contaminated by stars in order to determine the errors due to the sky background .",
    "the standard deviation of the gaussian distribution of the sky background aperture flux values was used with the previously determined photometric zeropoint to estimate the photometric upper limits for each image .",
    "the aperture fluxes were measured at the ot position in both the individual epoch images and the stacked images .",
    "tables [ tab : photom ] and [ tab : limits ] summarize the upper limits for all the neat imaging .",
    "a subset of the neat data on four of these bursts have been presented previously @xcite .",
    "our photometric measurements of the same data agree with those reports to within 0.5mag .",
    "figure [ fig : ims ] shows the stacked preimages of the individual fields surrounding all 11 grbs . before making a stacked image of a given field ,",
    "individual exposures are visually inspected for the presence of defects near the known position of the burst and excluded if defects or cosmic - rays are found .",
    "we photometered the 11 stacked images at the position of the grb and find the @xmath14-band upper limits presented in table [ tab : limits ] and for individual epochs in table [ tab : photom ] .",
    "we report @xmath17 upper limits on the photometry of the individual epoch images and @xmath18 upper limits for the stacked images . at this level",
    "we statistically expect to have no false positive detections for the stacked images and at most a few false - positives in the individual epoch photometry .",
    "the histogram of the rms - normalized individual epoch flux measurements is shown in figure [ fig : hist ] .",
    "the expected distribution from purely gaussian errors is also plotted .",
    "this figure indicates that our estimations of the photometric errors are reasonably accurate , with a tendency to over estimate local sky values , leading to a greater number of negative flux values .",
    "a single epoch detection at the @xmath19 level shown in figure [ fig : hist ] is attributed to an observation in very poor seeing of grb 020813 .",
    "the ot position for this grb is in a crowded region with several bright stars within a few neat pixels making accurate photometry very difficult in poor seeing .",
    "we find upper limits consistent with the known fainter brightness of the grb host galaxies .",
    "as seen in table [ tab : limits ] , there are no significant detections of precursor emission at the positions of the 11 grbs for which a search was conducted .",
    "to place this in the context of physically meaningful quantities , we translate the upper limits to an approximate absolute magnitude in the restframe @xmath1-band using a cosmological @xmath20-correction .",
    "this @xmath20-correction is derived assuming an intrinsic source spectrum of @xmath21 , which approximates the typical median @xmath1-@xmath14 colors of the photometric calibration objects in the grb fields ( in  [ sec : sne ] , we vary this assumed precursor spectrum ) .",
    "we use the zeropoints , zp@xmath22 , and effective wavelengths , @xmath23 , of the photometric bandpasses from @xcite .",
    "we convert the extinction corrected upper limit , @xmath24 , in the @xmath14-band to absolute magnitude in the @xmath1-band , as @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the distance modulus to the burst at redshift @xmath27 , computed assuming @xmath28 kms@xmath29mpc@xmath29 , @xmath30 , and @xmath31 = 0.7 .",
    "the third term accounts for the assumed spectrum of the precursor and the last term accounts for the intrinsically smaller bandpass in the restframe .",
    "we also find @xmath32 by using the equivalent @xmath1-band upper limits and average the two results .",
    "since the neat spectral response is broad and the intrinsic precursor spectrum is unconstrained , we expect the systematic uncertainty in the subsequent @xmath33 measurements to be at least @xmath34 0.3mag , and probably greater for the higher redshift bursts",
    ". if the precursor spectra are significantly more red ( blue ) than @xmath35 , then the quoted upper limits will be systematically too deep ( shallow ) , especially for bursts at high redshift .",
    "figure [ fig : ups ] shows the aggregate absolute magnitude upper limits from the 11 bursts with pre - imaging from neat and the dss - ii .",
    "the observation time before the burst is given in the co - moving frame of the host galaxies , i.e. , the time - dilation has been removed by dividing the observed time by ( 1 + @xmath27 ) .",
    "our limits are supplemented with a few others from the literature ( shown as unfilled symbols ) .",
    "the early upper limit on grb030329 ( 5.6 hours before the burst ) is from the raptor experiment @xcite .",
    "the other limits are 030329 @xcite , 030226 @xcite , and 021211 @xcite . the deepest limit on grb030329 was reported by @xcite from neat imaging , but we were unfortunately unable to find such images in the archive to confirm the result .",
    "in addition , a 3 minute exposure at the position of grb030226 was obtained by @xcite using the bootes experiment @xcite starting 1.5 minutes before the burst trigger .",
    "the upper limit of @xmath36mag ( not shown in figure [ fig : ups ] ) implies any precursor would have been @xmath37mag at the redshift of that grb .        at a redshift of @xmath38 @xcite ,",
    "corresponding to a distance modulus of @xmath39 = 39.70mag , grb030329 is the nearest known `` cosmological '' grb .",
    "its proximity allowed several groups to study the photometric and spectral properties of the associated supernova with unprecedented detail @xcite . though this firm detection of a nearly contemporaneous sn suggests a single event destroyed the progenitor ",
    "rendering unlikely the possibility of a similar precursor event  it is still of interest to know what limits can be placed on the occurrence of a similar precursor .    at this redshift ,",
    "a bright supernova - like precursor [ @xmath33(peak ) = @xmath40mag ] would have peaked at @xmath41mag and could have remained above our nominal single epoch magnitude limit of @xmath42mag for @xmath323 weeks . since there are temporal gaps in the data , particularly between 30300 days before the grb , it is certainly possible that a bright precursor could have been missed by the pre - imaging . however , three upper limits less than 30 days before the burst exclude such a bright sn - like precursor preceding the grb by @xmath34510 days .      to estimate how restrictive the entire data set is",
    "to sn - like precursors , we created a monte carlo test by assuming that every grb in the sample had the same precursor at some random explosion date less than 1000 days before the burst .",
    "the working hypothesis is that a grb with a sn - like precursor would be of type ib / ic and so we use sn 1998bw as a template .",
    "owing to the extreme deficit of flux blueward of @xmath33000   of ib / ic sne , we only use precursor photometry from bursts that originated from @xmath43 .",
    "since sne generally appear red in @xmath44 , especially after the peak , we recalculated the apparent absolute magnitude limits in table [ tab : photom ] using a source spectrum with @xmath45 .",
    "synthetic sn light curves were created from the @xmath1-band data of sn 1998bw published in @xcite and @xcite . for a given peak brightness ( allowed to vary from @xmath46 to @xmath47mag )",
    "we randomly selected 1000 explosion dates before the grb and then constructed a set of synthetic light curves , noting the frequency of synthetic precursors brighter than at least one of the detection limits .",
    "for simplicity we assumed no correlation in peak brightness with light curve shape .",
    "for two different distributions of starting times , we computed the probability that the precursor would have been found in the neat data , taking the ratio of the number of `` detected '' sources in the monte carlo to the total number in the simulation .",
    "the result is seen in figure [ fig : sne ] . for uniformly random explosion dates before the grb , almost all sn - like precursors brighter than ( peak ) @xmath48mag would have been detected at some point during the 3 years before the grbs in the sample . for both preburst sn explosion date distributions ,",
    "the limits on sne with 1998bw - like peak magnitudes ( @xmath49mag ; @xcite ) is not very strong .",
    "following figure [ fig : sne ] , there is only about 1030% chance that such sne would have been detected .",
    "therefore , though there are specific time windows when sne could not have occurred before the grbs in the sample , we can not rule out the possibility that a sn with brightness comparable to 1998bw ( or 2003dh ) occurred _ for all grbs _ but was missed due to the sparse sampling of the data .",
    "grb precursors could , of course , be of a different physical nature than supernovae .",
    "we have also tested the detection sensitivity to decaying power - law precursors .",
    "we used a model for the flux of the precursor as @xmath50 ( for @xmath51 day ) , with the magnitude of the source at one day since @xmath52 of @xmath33(1 day ) .",
    "as above , we simulated 1000 precursors with a characteristic start time @xmath52 less than 1000 days before the grb set .",
    "the spectral index of the precursor was assumed to be @xmath53 , for consistency with the conversion of apparent magnitude to absolute @xmath1-band magnitude . for a range of decay indices , @xmath54 , and @xmath33(1 day ) , we found the probability of detection using the results in table [ tab : photom ] .",
    "figure [ fig : f4 ] shows the results for two different probability distributions of @xmath52 .",
    "the lines of 0.95 and 0.99 show the equivalent windows for detection of most such transients . for example , if all precursors have @xmath55 and @xmath33(1 day ) @xmath56mag , then there is greater than a 99% chance that the neat set would have detected at least one such precursor if it occurred less than 1000 days before the grb .",
    "precursors that fade more quickly easily evade detection in the sample .",
    "for example , only about 5% of precursors with @xmath33(1 day ) @xmath57mag and @xmath58 would be detected in the current sample .",
    "thus , there is little constraint on the existence of faint precursors generated from tidal disruption around a massive black hole ( @xmath59 ; @xcite ) .",
    "it is of interest to compare the brightness sensitivity of power - law precursors to known afterglow brightnesses .",
    "following from the grb030329 afterglow measurement of @xcite and the extinction measurement in @xcite , the restframe extinction corrected @xmath1-band magnitude of the afterglow was @xmath33(1 day ) @xmath60 , fairly typical of other long - duration grbs .",
    "though there were deviations from a power - law , the secular decay after 0.5 days was approximately @xmath61 @xcite .",
    "following from figure [ fig : f4 ] , had a precursor  perhaps of a similar physical origin as grb afterglows ( a `` foreglow '' )  with the same parameters occurred for all bursts at some time less than 1000 days before the grb , there is only a 50% chance that such precursors would be seen in the neat imaging .",
    "the non - detection of at least some power - law precursors  at magnitudes comparable to afterglow brightnesses  supports the notion that grbs are due to explosive catastrophic events rather than due to recurrent activity ( e.g. , from an agn , @xcite ) . for consistency with all the limits presented herein",
    ", precursor theories must now posit optical precursor emission fainter than @xmath62mag ( @xmath63 day ) . from the analysis in",
    " 3 , we can also rule out the possibility that sn - like precursors with @xmath33(peak ) @xmath64 and explosion dates less than 1000 days after the bursts occurred for all grbs in the sample .",
    "likewise , we exclude the possibility that all grbs in the sample had a precursor with @xmath33(1 day ) @xmath64 and a slowly fading ( @xmath65 ) power - law light curve .",
    "it is possible that a subset of grbs had precursors at least this bright . while providing the strongest comprehensive precursor limits thus far , despite the nearly 200 photometric pre - imaging measurements of 11 grbs , the neat data are not very sensitive to realistic precursor brightnesses . even if all grbs had extremely bright [ @xmath33(peak ) @xmath57 ] sn - like precursors , these would have been missed with an @xmath380% probability .",
    "similarly , more than half of precursors with similar power - laws and brightnesses as grb afterglows would have been missed .",
    "figure [ fig : f5 ] shows how various precursors could have been detected or could have evaded detection .",
    "since grb hosts are known to be forming stars vigorously , novae and sne should not be uncommon in such hosts . if the star - formation rate in a grb host is 40 @xmath67 yr@xmath29 then the canonical sn rate is about 1 yr@xmath29 from somewhere within the host . at spatial resolutions of @xmath68 arcseconds ( such as from neat )",
    ", the best astrometric localizations of a precursor should be @xmath69 milliarcseconds ( @xmath53-@xmath4 ) .",
    "this corresponds to a 3-@xmath4 localization uncertainty 4kpc in projection at a redshift of @xmath70 , larger than the exponential scale lengths of all grb hosts measured to - date @xcite .",
    "therefore , any precursor emission could be easily confused with an unrelated sn somewhere in the host ( this essentially extends the confusion problem encountered by plate archive studies from the arcminute to the sub - arcsecond level ) .",
    "this disturbing possibility motivates the additional need for high spatial resolution in pre - imaging surveys . to this end , future deep wide - field imaging surveys , such as panstarrs , should be sufficient : a precursor detected with a signal  to  noise of 30 at the nyquist - sample resolution of panstarrs ( 0.6 ) will result in a positional confusion about 100 times smaller than with neat .",
    "this means that if panstarrs detects an apparent precursor to a grb within the host galaxy ( say one year before the burst ) , a significant association with the grb itself should be possible for even the most vigorously star forming host galaxies .",
    "the quality and quantity of `` pre - observations '' of transient locations will dramatically improve with the increasing size of the national virtual observatory .",
    "digital imaging surveys , such as raptor @xcite and bootes @xcite , have already presented limits acquired a few hours before bursts to the @xmath71 1215mag level ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "deeper surveys such as sdss should be searched systematically for pre - imaging observations of grb locations .",
    "identification of precursors with sdss will have the added benefit of color information , yielding important clues about the physical nature of precursors , should any be detected .",
    "the higher localization rates of _ swift _ will increase the likelihood of deeper pre - imaging with the next generation of large - area surveys @xcite . with the advent of large synoptic imaging programs ( lss and panstarrs )",
    ", with the primary science goals to detect near - earth asteroids , the deepest and most frequent imaging will be at low ecliptic latitudes .",
    "this observing strategy will be well - matched to satellite missions like hete - ii @xcite which preferentially localize grbs anti - solar .",
    "thus , the rates of deep pre - imaging may be higher than those predicted by @xcite . if some sub - population of bursts originate from within the galaxy or in the local group ( such as , potentially , short bursts and supernovae - grbs ) , then , as has been demonstrated with a handful of sne ( see @xcite ) , space - based pre - imaging might someday retroactively resolve the progenitors directly .",
    "we are exceedingly gratefully to the neat team ( s.  pravdo , d.  r.  rabinowitz , e.  f.  helin , k.  lawrence , t.  mcglynn , l.  angelini , and n.  white ) for making images public and so readily accessible . without their dedication to this wonderful experiment and user - friendly archive , none of this work would be possible .",
    "we thank s.  kulkarni for bringing to our attention a concern from p.  kumar about the possibility of misidentifying the origin of an sn bump _",
    "after _ a grb , due to confusion with unrelated supernovae in the host galaxies ; our discussion of precursor confusion follows from that concern .",

    "<S> making use of virtual observatory data , we present the first comprehensive sample of optical observations conducted before the explosion times of all gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) with known redshifts . in total , the fields of 11 such grbs were observed by the near - earth asteroid tracking ( neat ) program from years to hours before the bursts . </S>",
    "<S> though the typical limiting magnitudes from these observations are @xmath0mag , we find no evidence for a significant detection of a precursor . </S>",
    "<S> the deepest non - detection of precursor emission is from grb030329 , reaching down to an absolute @xmath1-band magnitude of @xmath2mag from 61500 days ( restframe ) before the burst . </S>",
    "<S> this is of comparable brightness to supernovae , which , in some scenarios for grb progenitors , are predicted to pre - date a grb on similar timescales . </S>",
    "<S> since sources can not be localized to better than @xmath3500 milliarcsecond ( 3 @xmath4 ) with current large - area surveys , unrelated supernovae or agn activity in grb hosts could be mistaken for genuine precursor emission . </S>",
    "<S> this possibility motivates the need for not only deep wide - field imaging , but imaging at high spatial resolution . </S>"
