    "the galaxy central region can not be observed in the optical and uv range because of strong extinction ( erickson et al 1991 ) , but in recent years , infrared observations allowed a detailed investigation of the gas and dust structures .",
    "1 shows a radio image of this region ( yusef - zadeh & morris 1987 ) .",
    "the sgr a west hii region contains a quiescent black hole @xmath0 4 10@xmath5 ( ghez et al .",
    "2005 ; eisenhauer et al .",
    "2005 ) which is coincident with the radio source sgr a * and is located at the center of the galaxy .",
    "it also contains a cluster of massive stars .",
    "a distance of 8 kpc is assumed by simpson et al ( 2007 ) .",
    "two other clusters of young massive stars and massive molecular clouds ( schdel et al .",
    "2006 ) appear in the galactic center ( gc ) .",
    "the arches cluster and the quintuplet cluster are located @xmath0 25 pc away in the plane of the sky . the arches cluster ( nagata et al 1995 and cotera et al .",
    "1996 ) is a very massive and dense cluster of young stars heating and ionizing the region of the arched filaments and the sickle .",
    "these are thermal radio emitters ( e.g. yusef - zadeh & morris 1987 , morris & yusef - zadeh 1989 , lang et al .",
    "1997 , 2001 ) , while the radio arc ( yusef - zadeh et al 1984 ) consists of non - thermally emitting linear filaments perpendicular to the galactic plane .",
    "the stars of the quintuplet cluster ionize the clouds in the extended region including the bubble .",
    "a detailed description of the gc is given by simpson et al ( 2007 ) .",
    "excitation of the gas is ascribed to photoionization because it was found that the excitation variations depend on the projected distances from the clusters ( erickson 1991 ) .",
    "the radial velocity field is very complicated .",
    "the gas velocity range in the sickle is @xmath0 40 - 140 ( yusef - zadeh et al 1997 , lang et al .",
    "1997 ) , and seems lower closest to sgr a. interestingly , in both the arched filaments and the sickle the velocity of the molecular clouds is similar to that of the gas .    according to the morphology in fig .",
    "1 , it appears that the cloud structures characterised by a system of semicircular arcs , arise from stellar winds or supernova explosions .",
    "this can be noticed for instance , in the bubble region ( levine et al . 1999 ) and in the `` radio arc bubble '' ( rodrguez - fernndez et al . 2001 ) .",
    "at the same position on the plane of the sky as the bubble , there is a dense molecular cloud , g0.0110.011 ( tsuboi et al .",
    "1997 ) or g0.0130.013 ( oka et al .",
    "2001 ) .",
    "stellar winds and supernova explosions suggest that the shocks have a non - negligible role in heating and ionizing both the gas and the dust .",
    "the fragmented filamentary structures characteristic of the gc strengthens this hypothesis .",
    "the arches cluster has also been investigated in the light of dynamical evolution of compact young clusters ( e.g. kim , morris , & lee 1999 , kim et al . 2000 ) .    in the x - ray domain , using the chandra telescope , yusef - zadeh et al .",
    "( 2002 ) detected three x - ray components associated with the arches cluster .",
    "they claim that hot ( 10@xmath6k ) x - ray emitting gas is produced by an interaction of material expelled by the massive stellar winds with the local interstellar medium .",
    "one of the sources has roughly the characteristics expected from shock - heated gas created by the collision of a number of 1000 stellar winds emanating from the stars in the rich dense cluster .",
    "however , the x - ray sources are extended and hardly related to single x - ray binary systems .    far - infrared ( fir ) lines were observed using the kuiper airborne observatory ( kao : colgan et al . 1996 ; simpson et al . 1997 ) and the infrared space observatory ( iso : rodrguez - fernndez et al . 2001 ; cotera et al . 2005 ) .",
    "for both the arched filaments ( colgan et al .",
    "1996 ; cotera et al . 2005 ) and the sickle ( simpson et al . 1997 ; rodrguez - fernndez et al .",
    "2001 ) , the excitation decreases with distance from the arches cluster and quintuplet cluster , respectively , as expected for photoionization .",
    "spitzer observations of mir spectra in 38 positions along a line approximately perpendicular to the galactic plane in the gc are presented by simpson et al ( 2007 ) , who analyse the sources of excitation of the arched filaments and of the other thermal arcs .",
    "they are particularly interested in the bubble physical conditions relatively to the clusters and the other filament structures .",
    "the observed positions are shown in fig .",
    "1 . their spectra contain high and low ionization level lines ( e.g. [ oiv ] , [ siv ] , [ neiii ] , [ neii ] , [ siii ] , [ feiii ] , [ feii ] , and [ siii ] ) .    in their paper , simpson et al .",
    "( 2007 ) use the new observations to determine the stellar properties of the most massive stars in the arches cluster . however , the modelling of the spectral line ratios by pure photoionization codes , ( e.g. cloudy etc . ) was successful only to explain some line ratios in a few positions .",
    "simpson et al . ( 2007 ) conclude that the models accounting for the shocks by contini & viegas ( 2001 ) could explain the relatively strong [ oiv ] lines .",
    "this induced us to revisit simpson et al .",
    "observations of the galactic central region , by a detailed modelling of the line and continuum spectra , constraining the results by the interpretation of the spectra previously observed by erickson et al .",
    "( 1991 ) and colgan et al.(1996 ) .",
    "we adopt for the calculations the code suma which accounts for both photoionization and shocks .",
    "in particular , all the lines available in each spectrum and the continuum spectral energy distribution ( sed ) will be modelled in a consistent way .",
    "the results will explain the excitation mechanisms of the gas near the gc as well as some particular features , e.g. the distribution of dust .",
    "the calculation details are described in sect .",
    "2 . in sect .",
    "3 the spectra presented by simpson et al .",
    "are modelled and discussed . in sect .",
    "4 , line and continuum spectra are modelled for position c - g0.095 + 0.012 and the e2 thermal radio filament which were observed by erickson et al ( 1991 ) . in sect .",
    "5 we examine the observations of colgan et al ( 1996 ) in the different positions crossing the e2-w1 arched radio filament . concluding remarks follow in sect . 6 .",
    "the physical parameters are combined throughout the calculation of forbidden and permitted lines ( see osterbrock 1988 ) emitted from a shocked nebula . besides the element abundances ,",
    "the main parameters are known to be : the electron density , the electron temperature , the component of the magnetic field perpendicular to the flow direction @xmath7 , the flux from the external source , which is characterised by its spectral type ( e.g. a black body ) and intensity ( e.g. the ionization parameter u ) , and the fractional abundance of the ions .",
    "they follow the recombination trend of the gas downstream .",
    "therefore , the precision of the calculations requires to divide the downstream region in many different slabs corresponding to the different physical conditions .",
    "the line and continuum intensities in the x - ray - radio range , are calculated in each slab and integrated throughout the nebula geometrical thickness .",
    "in pure photoionization models the density n is constant throughout the nebula , while in a shock wave regime , n is calculated downstream by the compression equation in each of the single slabs .",
    "compression depends on n , @xmath7 , and the shock velocity v.    the ranges of the physical conditions in the nebula are deduced , as a first guess , from the observed lines ( e.g. the shock velocity from the fwhm ) and from the characteristic line ratios ( e.g. and ) .",
    "the observations indicate that a steady state situation can be applied ( cox 1972 ) . in this case",
    ", the time t required for a parcel of gas to cross the cooling region from the shock front to the recombination zone , for shock waves with v=100 , is found to be about 1000/years ( calculated by the recombination coefficients ) so , for an electron density = 100 3 , t = 10 years .",
    "shock velocities within the gc are not likely to change appreciably in that short a time , so the steady state calculation should be adequate .    in this paper ,",
    "the line and continuum spectra emitted by the gas downstream of the shock front , are calculated by suma ( see http://wise-obs.tau.ac.il/@xmath0marcel/suma/index.htm for a detailed description ) .",
    "the code simulates the physical conditions in an emitting gaseous cloud under the coupled effect of photoionisation from an external radiation source and shocks .",
    "the line and continuum emission from the gas is calculated consistently with dust reprocessed radiation in a plane - parallel geometry .    in a composite ( shock and photoionization ) code such as suma ,",
    "the input parameters are : the shock velocity , the preshock density 0 , the preshock magnetic field 0 which refer to the shock , while , the colour temperature of the hot star and the ionization parameter @xmath8 ( the number of photons per number of electrons at the nebula ) refer to the flux .",
    "the geometrical thickness of the emitting nebula @xmath9 , the dust - to - gas ratio @xmath10 , and the abundances of he , c , n , o , ne , mg , si , s , a , and fe relative to h are also considered . the distribution of the grain radius ( ) downstream is determined by sputtering , beginning with an initial radius .",
    "the calculations start at the shock front where the gas is compressed and thermalized adiabatically , reaching the maximum temperature in the immediate post - shock region ( t@xmath0 1.5 10@xmath11 ( @xmath12/100 ) @xmath13 ) .",
    "t decreases downstream following recombination .",
    "the cooling rate is calculated in each slab .",
    "the downstream region is cut up into a maximum of 300 plane - parallel slabs with different geometrical widths calculated automatically , in order to account for the temperature gradient ( contini 1997 and references therein ) .    in each slab",
    ", compression is calculated by the rankine - hugoniot equations for the conservation of mass , momentum and energy throughout the shock front .",
    "compression ( n/0 ) downstream ranges between 4 ( the adiabatic jump ) and @xmath14 10 , depending on and 0 . the stronger the magnetic field the lower is compression downstream , while a higher shock velocity corresponds to a higher compression .",
    "the ionizing radiation from an external source is characterized by its spectrum depending on , and by the ionization parameter .",
    "the flux is calculated at 440 energies , from a few ev to kev . due to radiative transfer",
    ", the spectrum changes throughout the downstream slabs , each of them contributing to the optical depth .",
    "in addition to the radiation from the primary source , the effect of the diffuse radiation created by the gas line and continuum emission is also taken into account , using 240 energies to calculate the spectrum .    for each slab of gas , the fractional abundance of the ions of each chemical element are obtained by solving the ionization equations .",
    "these equations account for the ionization mechanisms ( photoionization by the primary and diffuse radiation , and collisional ionization ) and recombination mechanisms ( radiative , dielectronic recombinations ) , as well as charge transfer effects .",
    "the ionization equations are coupled to the energy equation when collision processes dominate , and to the thermal balance if radiative processes dominate .",
    "this latter balances the heating of the gas due to the primary and diffuse radiations reaching the slab , and the cooling , due to recombinations and collisional excitation of the ions followed by line emission , dust collisional ionization , and thermal bremsstrahlung .",
    "the coupled equations are solved for each slab , providing the physical conditions necessary for calculating the slab optical depth , as well as its line and continuum emissions .",
    "the slab contributions are integrated throughout the cloud .",
    "in particular , the absolute line fluxes referring to the ionization level i of element k are calculated by the term n@xmath15(i ) which represents the density of the ion i. we consider that n@xmath15(i)= x(i ) [ k / h ] n@xmath16 , where x(i ) is the fractional abundance of the ion i calculated by the ionization equations , [ k / h ] is the relative abundance of the element k to h , and n@xmath16 is the density of h ( by number 3 ) . in models including shock ,",
    "n@xmath16 is calculated by the compression equation ( cox 1972 ) in each slab downstream ( sect .",
    "so the abundances of the elements are given relative to h as input parameters .",
    "dust grains are coupled to the gas across the shock front by the magnetic field , and are heated by radiation from the stars and collisionally by the gas to a maximum temperature which is a function of the shock velocity , of the chemical composition , and the radius of the grains , up to the evaporation temperature ( t@xmath17 1500 k ) .",
    "the grain radius distribution downstream is determined by sputtering , which depends on the shock velocity and on the density . throughout shock fronts and downstream",
    ", the grains might be destroyed by sputtering .",
    "summarizing , very schematically :    \\1 ) we adopt an initial te ( @xmath0 10@xmath18 k ) and the input parameters ;    \\2 ) calculate the density from the compression equation ;    \\3 ) calculate the fractional abundances of the ions from each level for each element ;    \\4 ) calculate line emission , free - free and free - bound emission ;    \\5 ) recalculate te by thermal balancing or the enthalpy equation ;    \\6 ) calculate the optical depth of the slab and the primary and secondary fluxes ;    \\7 ) adopt the parameters found in slab i as initial conditions for slab i+1 ;    integrating the contribution of the line intensities calculated in each slab , we obtain the absolute fluxes of each of the lines , calculated at the nebula ( the same for bremsstrahlung ) .",
    "\\8 ) we then calculate the line ratios to a certain line ( in the present case [ siii ] , because we do not have values of or other h lines )    \\9 ) and compare them with the observed line ratios .",
    "the observed data have errors , both random and systematic .",
    "models are generally allowed to reproduce the data within a factor of 2 .",
    "this leads to input parameter ranges of a few percent .",
    "the uncertainty in the calculation results , on the other hand , derives from the use of many atomic parameters , such as recombination coefficients , collision strengths , etc .",
    ", which are continuously updated . moreover , the precision of the integrations depends on the computer efficiency .",
    "simpson et al .",
    "present the spectra observed in close regions throughout the slit .",
    "actually , we are interested in the trend of the physical conditions , as well as in the parameter ranges . therefore , to avoid the accumulation of errors which leads to inconsistent results , we try to reproduce the data as close as possible .",
    "if the calculated lines are compatible with the observed ones within the error of each line , we adopt the input parameters as the result in this observed position .",
    "if there are discrepancies , we change consistently the input parameters and we restart the whole calculation process . as explained in the text , the alterations are done on the basis that affects [ neiii]/[neii ] , u affects [ feiii]/[feii ] , [ oiv ] depends on , etc . we also change the relative abundances to obtain a good fit for all the line ratios , however , they affect the cooling rate , so it is important to restart the calculation process each time .    as a matter of fact",
    ", a degeneracy can arise e.g. from the density and the magnetic field which are directly correlated .",
    "there can be a doubt in the values of 0 and 0 leading to the best fit of the observations in a certain position @xmath19 .",
    "our method is to adopt as a first guess , the input parameters of position @xmath19 - 1 , and then modify them , little by little , calculating a grid of models , until all the observed line ratios in position @xmath19 are satisfactorily reproduced within the least error .",
    "the number of ionizing photons @xmath20 s@xmath21 produced by the hot source is @xmath22= @xmath23 , where @xmath240=3.29 10@xmath25 s@xmath21 and b@xmath26 is the planck function .",
    "the flux from the star is combined with u and n by : @xmath22 ( r / r)@xmath13 = u n c , where r is the radius of the hot source ( the stars ) , r is the radius of the nebula ( in terms of the distance from the stars ) , n is the density of the nebula , and c the speed of light .",
    "therefore , and u compensate each other , but only in a qualitative way , because determines the frequency distribution of the primary flux , while u represents the number of photons per number of electrons reaching the nebula .",
    "the choice of and u in each position is made by the fit of the line ratios .",
    "affects strongly the [ neiii ] line , while [ feiii]/[feii ] is more affected by u.    the velocity v and the density n are linked by the continuity equation : v0 n0 = v1 n1 .",
    "moreover , 0 , 0 , and , are combined in the compression equation ( cox , 1972 ) . in conclusion",
    ", all the parameters are combined together in the calculations .",
    "therefore , for each position a large grid of models are run .",
    "the models are selected on the basis of the minimum deviation from the observation data for all the line ratios .",
    "spitzer mir spectra ( program 3295 , all aors ) were observed by simpson et al .",
    "( 2007 , hereafter s07 ) in 38 positions along a line approximately perpendicular to the galactic plane in the gc ( fig .",
    "the line intensities were corrected by the @xmath27/@xmath28 optical depth ratios , using the optical depth at 9.6 @xmath28 , as given by s07 in their table 2 and table 1 respectively .    in some positions , in particular between 1 and 16 , the observed [ siii]18.7/[siii]33.5 ratios , corrected for extinction by the @xmath28 presented in s07 , were lower than the calculated [ siii]18.7/[siii]33.5 lower limit ( @xmath0 0.5 ) , even adopting a very low density model .",
    "consequently , the @xmath28 values were incremented in each position in order to lead to a reasonable spectrum . .",
    "in fact , the @xmath28 values were calculated by simpson et al ( 2007 ) assuming = 6000 k , while in our models the temperatures downstream , depending on the shock velocity , show higher values in the region close to the shock front ( sect .",
    "3.2.1 ) .",
    "in table 1 , we compare the spectra corrected for extinction with model calculations . in the last column",
    "the extinction is given .",
    "the spectra are numerated from 1 to 38 referring to s07 .",
    "each observed ( corrected ) spectrum is followed in the next row by the calculated one , which is numerated from m1 to m38 .",
    "model m@xmath29 which appears in the last row of tables 1 and 2 is explained in sect .",
    "the models adopt a black body photo - ionizing radiation flux corresponding to the colour temperature of the stars .",
    "the model parameters are given in table 2 , where columns 2 - 4 list the shock parameters .",
    "columns 5 and 6 give the photoionizing flux : the temperature of the stars and the ionization parameter , respectively .",
    "the relative abundances si / h , s / h , and fe / h follow in columns 7 - 9 .",
    "the o / h and ne / h ratios were found nearly constant in all s07 positions , by a first modelling .",
    "in fact , depletion into dust grains is not important since o is not the main constituent of dust grains and ne can not be adsorbed due to its atomic structure .",
    "the last column shows the geometrical thickness of the emitting filaments .",
    "indeed , a high fragmentation of matter appears in the observed region and in each position , many different conditions could coexist . in our modelling",
    "we refer to the data as to single ( average ) spectra .    in table 1",
    ", we show the line ratios normalized to [ siii ] 33.5 = 10 -the strongest line - to avoid very small values .",
    "the line sequence is ordered by wavelength .",
    "a grid of models was run for each position and the best fitting spectrum was selected on the basis of the [ siv]/[siii ] , [ neiii]/[neii ] , and [ feiii]/[feii ] flux ratios which do not depend on the relative abundances , and of [ oiv]/[siii ] which depends strongly on the shock velocity .    to understand the results , we recall that the radiative ionization rates depend on the intensity of the primary and secondary ( diffuse ) radiation flux ; radiation can not heat the gas to @xmath4 2 - 3 10@xmath18 k. the shocks heat the gas to temperatures which depend on the shock velocity and the collisional ionization rates increase with increasing temperatures .",
    "we derive and u by the best fit of [ neiii]/[neii ] and [ feiii]/[feii ] , respectively .",
    "however , these parameters also affect [ siv]/[siii ] .",

    "the [ oiv ] line corresponds to a relatively high ionization level that can be reached collisionally by a relatively high temperature gas , depending on .",
    "it was found that the [ oiv ] line is hardly detected for shock velocities @xmath3 64 . only shocks with @xmath4 64",
    "can lead to results suitable to the observations .",
    "the ionization potential of s@xmath30 is lower than those of o@xmath31 and ne@xmath31 .",
    "therefore , the [ siv ] line intensity depends on u and more than on",
    ". moreover , [ siv]/[siii ] decreases with distance from the shock front downstream following recombination , because the s@xmath30 region is totally included within the nebula , while the s@xmath31 region can be cut off at a certain distance from the shock front in matter - bound nebulae .",
    "the geometrical thickness of the emitting cloud is determined when the calculated [ siv]/[siii ] line ratio reproduces the observed one .",
    "the relative abundance of s is determined by all the line ratios because they are given as ratios to [ siii ] .",
    "when the line ratios are either all overestimated or all underestimated by the same factor , s / h is modified in order to reproduce the data .",
    "s and si are not strong coolant , therefore si / h and s / h result directly , without re - starting the whole modelling process .",
    "the results of modelling are presented in the three diagrams of fig .",
    "a , b , c .",
    "we define as _ results _ the sets of input parameters ( , 0 , 0 , , u , d , and the relative abundances ) which lead to the best fit of the data in each position .",
    "when a cloud moves toward the photoionization source , the shock front edge is reached directly by the photons .",
    "when the cloud propagates outwards , the photoionising flux reaches the cloud on the edge opposite to the shock front .",
    "therefore , the calculations need some iterations . in the present modelling ,",
    "the best fit is obtained considering that the shock front is reached by radiation from the hot stars .",
    "this indicates that the clouds move towards the photoionization source . the case of an outward motion",
    "was discarded because we could not reach a consistent fit of all the lines in the different positions .",
    "comparing our results with those generally derived from specific line ratios ( e.g. simpson et al .",

    "2c , after modelling the continuum sed in the next section .",
    "the results in the extreme positions 1 - 2 , 36 - 38 , showing a relatively high , are unusual in the ism , suggesting that perhaps we should try models which account for a power - law ( pl ) flux from the center of the galaxy , as for agns ( e.g. contini & viegas 2001 ) , instead of a black body ( bb ) .",
    "in fact , in the galaxy center there is a `` quiescent '' bh ( ghez et al . 2005 ) , which is likely not far from the observed positions .",
    "we have run a grid of models ( m@xmath29 ) with a pl ionization flux and the other parameters similar to those found by modelling with a bb .",
    "the selected model appears in the last row of tables 1 and 2 .",
    "actually , we could not find a fit to the observed line ratios as good as that found by the bb models .",
    "in addition , a small contribution of this spectrum would not change the results .",
    "the flux f@xmath26 is lower by at least a factor of 100 than the lowest flux found for liners ( contini 1997 ) and for low luminosity agn ( contini 2004 ) .",
    "moreover , we found o / h=8 10@xmath33 and ne / h= 10@xmath33 .",
    "the best fitting pl model was run with photoionization and shocks acting on the same edge of the cloud , which means that the cloud is propagating towards the ( supposed active ) center .",
    "inflow is characteristic of regions close to the agn active center .    [",
    "cols=\"<,<,<,<,<,<,<,<,<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     for all models = 2.7 10@xmath18 k is adopted    the modelling is constrained by the [ oiii]/[oi ] line ratio , which depends strongly on the ionization parameter , while the [ oiii]52/[oiii]88 ratio depends on the density .",
    "the shock velocity is not strongly affecting the line ratios , because lines from relatively high ionization levels were not reported .",
    "so we have chosen , as a first guess , in the range of the shock velocities explaining the spectra observed by s07 ( table 2 ) in the region between e2 and w1 .",
    "the ranges of the other parameters , 0 , 0 , and u , were suggested by the preliminary investigation ( sect .",
    "5.1 ) which also leads to relatively low .",
    "all the results presented in table 6 were consistently calculated . in position 5 the density adopted to explain the very low [ oiii]52/[oiii]88 line ratio is exceptionally low .",
    "this was already realized by c96 . even by 0=10 3 ,",
    "the calculated value is lower than the observed one .",
    "notice , however , that the error given by c96 in their table 1 for the [ oiii]52 observed line flux is @xmath0 80 % .",
    "the results are shown in fig . 13 . in fig .",
    "13a the parameters depending on the shock are given as a function of position .",
    "the preshock density shows two deep minima , at positions 5 and 9 .",
    "as expected , the shock velocity has a maximum in position 5 denoting that the shock velocity range is relatively large .",
    "the pre - shock magnetic field shows a decreasing trend in agreement with the results for 0 obtained by explaining s07 observations between positions 31 and 34 . in fig .",
    "11a the [ oiii]88/[oiii]52 ratio shows a profile similar to that of the density , while the radio distribution taken from c96 and shown in the top panel , is not well correlated with the density .",
    "this can be explained by recalling that radio and line emissions occur from different regions of the gas downstream in each cloud .",
    "interestingly , the distribution of both the radio fluxes at 43 and 1.4 ghz shows that the two maxima do not correspond exactly to the maxima in d ( table 6 ) of 2.7 10@xmath34 cm in position 5 and 7.3 10@xmath35 cm in position 9 .    in fig .",
    "13b , the profile of u is shown and compared with the observed [ oiii]52/[oi]63 and [ siii]/[cii ] line ratios ( top panel ) .",
    "the oxygen line ratio follows the trend of u. the two u minima in positions 5 and 9 correspond to the minima in 0 .",
    "the opposite would be expected because the ionization parameter is reduced by crossing regions of dense gas .",
    "this indicates that the origin of the u minima in both positions 5 and 9 , is different .    in fig .",
    "13b ( bottom panel ) the relative abundances are shown for si , s , and c , showing that carbon is depleted from the gaseous phase at positions 5 and 9 . then , carbon grains , most probably pah , screen the flux from the hot source and the radiation flux does not lead to full evaporation of the grains .",
    "also , si is trapped into dust grains because it shows depletion from the gaseous phase along all the strip .",
    "the other relative abundances adopted by the models are n / h = 10@xmath33 , o / h = 6 10@xmath33 , and ne / h = 10@xmath33 .        in fig .",
    "14a we present the continuum sed in position 2 .",
    "the diagram on the left shows the modelling of the data .",
    "the short - dashed lines show the bremsstrahlung and dust reradiation calculated by model mc2 which best fit the line ratios .",
    "the data in the ir ( c96 , table 1 ) are not well reproduced by the model and indicate that dust grains are heated to a higher temperature , because the dust reradiation maximum is shifted towards higher frequencies .",
    "this result was found previously modelling the data by s07 and e91 .",
    "the best fit is obtained increasing u by a factor of 2000 and reducing to 0.01 .",
    "this leads to a maximum dust grain temperature of 88 k. in order to reduce the contribution of such a dusty cloud to the line spectra , a @xmath10 = 0.4 by mass is adopted .",
    "grains are neither destroyed by evaporation nor sputtered because the stars are not hot enough and the shock velocities are relatively low , respectively .",
    "it seems that these grains are not explained by pahs because c is not depleted from the gaseous phase in position 2 .",
    "they could be explained by eroded silicates and/or iron species .",
    "the slope of the radio continuum is an interesting issue .",
    "in fact , the non - thermal or thermal character of the emitting clouds is determined on the basis of radio observations .",
    "the non - thermal character of the radio emission should confirm the presence of shocks .",
    "synchrotron radiation , created by the fermi mechanism at the shock front , is observed in the radio range from nebulae ionised and heated by radiation from both the stars and shocks .",
    "the relative importance of synchrotron radiation to bremsstrahlung determines the non - thermal or thermal character .",
    "14a shows that the radio datum at 43 ghz can be explained by thermal bremsstrahlung as well as by dust reradiation .",
    "if it corresponds to dust reradiation , the synchrotron radiation flux created could also contribute .",
    "we do not have enough data in the radio range to confirm this . on the other hand , if the radio flux which refers to the data from sofue et al .",
    "( 1987 ) follows the bremsstrahlung trend , it can indicate some free - free self - absorption towards lower frequencies . for comparison",
    ", we have added in fig .",
    "12a and b the synchrotron power - law radiation flux ( long - dashed line ) which clearly follows a different trend .    to investigate the continuum for the other positions , we show in fig .",
    "14b the data in both the ir and radio frequency ranges for all the positions .",
    "the results found for position 2 are valid on a large scale also for the other positions .",
    "the dust temperatures are now constrained by radio data at 43 ghz .",
    "we have thus added the black body flux corresponding to 200 k ( black dotted line ) .",
    "such a dust temperature is easily reached by small grains .    in fig .",
    "14c , a zoom on the dust reradiation maximum is shown .",
    "we can conclude that dust can not reach temperatures higher than 200 k. in most positions there is an absorption feature at wavelengths @xmath36 30 . even if the data are insufficient to determine the absorption and emission bands of typical grains , we suggest that the feature at @xmath0 30 is not so rare , since it was discovered from ground based observations in 63 galactic objects : 36 evolved carbon stars , 14 ppne , and 13 pne ( hony et al . 2002 ) . in our galaxy , this feature , whose carrier seems to be mgs species , occurs from extreme agb stars on to later stages ( jiang et al .",
    "we have modelled the ir spectra observed in the region near the galactic center with the aim of determining the physical conditions in the different observed positions .",
    "we have obtained the results by comparing the calculated with the observed line ratios and of the continuum sed data .",
    "our models account for the coupled effect of the shocks and the photoionizing flux .",
    "the models are matter - bound , indicating a high degree of fragmentation of matter , that is characteristic of turbulent regimes .",
    "we have found that the shocks propagate towards the photoionizing source , i.e. the star clusters , suggesting that gravitation may prevail over eventual wind effects .",
    "the shock velocities range between @xmath0 65 and 80 .",
    "indeed , they are not high enough to produce x - ray emission by bremsstrahlung ( e.g. fig . 5 ) and to collisionally heat the dust grains to the observed temperatures of @xmath0 150 k in some positions of the arched filament region and of @xmath0 88 k in the e2-w1 crossing strip . in the downstream regions ,",
    "the characteristic electron temperature and density profiles lead to a good agreement of calculated line ratios from different ionization levels , with the observed ones .",
    "the results obtained with pure photoionization models which account on the [ oiii ] and [ siii ] line ratios ( e.g. rodrguez - fernndez et al .",
    "2001 , simpson et al .",
    "2007 , etc ) demonstrate that photoionization from the clusters affects the intermediate ionization level line ratios . however , adopting the composite models , detailed results can be found also for the shock velocities , pre - shock densities , and pre - shock magnetic fields , by modelling different level lines .",
    "the pre - shock densities range between @xmath36 1 3 in the ism and @xmath36 200 3 in the filamentary structures .",
    "high densities ( 0 = 100 - 80 3 ) are found in the arched filaments , the maximum values ( 0=200 3 ) in e91 position c , and in c96 positions 7 and 11 ( 280 and 200 3 , respectively ) .",
    "the magnetic field ranges from 5 .",

    "this indicates that the observed positions 30 - 35 are closer to the stars . in the e2-w1 strip ,",
    "u is rather low , diluted by the distance from the ionization source , most probably the arches cluster .",
