    "at the moment more than 60 x - ray pulsars have been found to be members of binary systems .",

    "we investigated 15 x - ray pulsars  persistent , transient , be - systems etc .",
    ", observed in different parts of the integral observational programs .    here",
    "we present preliminary results of the analysis of the integral data for several sources from this group .",
    "the international gamma - ray observatory integral was launched by the russian launcher proton from the baikonur cosmodrome on october 17 , 2002 ( eismont et al .",
    "the payload includes four principal instruments to carry out simultaneous observations of sources in the x - ray , gamma - ray and optical energy bands ( winkler et al . 2003 ) .",
    "the observational program of the observatory consists of core and general programs .",
    "the main part of core program consist in regular scans of the galactic plane and deep observations of the galactic central radian .",
    "general program is formed from the proposals of scientists . in this work we used the data collected by the detector isgri ( lebrun et al .",
    "2003 ) of the ibis telescope ( ubertini et al . 2003 ) and jem - x telescope ( lund et al .",
    "2003 ) in frames of both programs as well as during calibration observations .",
    "for imaging and spectral analysis of ibis / isgri data we followed the methods described in revnivtsev et al ( 2004 ) . for spectral analysis we used a simple ratio of the flux measured from the source to the fluxes of the crab nebula in the same energy bands and assumed that the crab nebula spectrum has the form @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the number of photons at energy @xmath3 .",
    "our analysis of an extensive set of crab calibration observations has shown that the source absolute flux can be recovered with an accuracy of 10% and the systematic uncertainty of relative flux measurement in different energy channels is less than 5% .",
    "last value was added to the following spectral analysis as a systematic uncertainty .",
    "the analysis of the jem - x data and the timing analysis of the isgri data were performed with the standard package osa 3.0 ..",
    "x - ray pulsar lmc x-4 ( @xmath013.5s ) is a member of a massive binary system with 1.408 day orbital period .",
    "in addition , lmc x-4 shows a modulation of x - ray flux with 30.5 day cycle . during approximately 60% of this cycle",
    "it is observed in a high intensity state , while during the remaining 40% of the cycle its x - ray flux drops to @xmath4 times lower level ( lang et al .",
    "this periodicity can be attributed to precessing tilted or warped accretion disk , which periodically eclipses x - ray emitting regions .",
    "lmc x-4 was observed with integral in january 2003 during observations of the large magellanic cloud in the frame of the general program .",
    "more than 1 million seconds of total useful exposure were collected .",
    "the x - ray map of the region containing lmc x-4 obtained in the 18 - 60 kev energy band is shown in fig.[fig : lmc_ima ] .    ]",
    "these integral observations covered almost whole 30.5 day cycle and allowed us to investigate the source behavior in hard x - rays on different time scales . in the upper panel of fig.[fig : lmc_30d ] the light curve obtained with ibis / integral in the 20 - 50 kev energy band is presented . the observed turn - on moment",
    "does not coincide with those predicted from the previous determinations of the 30.5 day cycle parameters ( lang et al .",
    "1981 , levine et al .",
    "2000 , paul et al .",
    "the average epoch - folded light curve obtained from about 8 years of asm / rxte observations is shown in the bottom panel of fig.[fig : lmc_30d ] .",
    "it is clearly seen that the average turn - on moment does not coincide with the integral one .",
    "such discrepancy is the evidence that the period of the 30.5 day cycle is not stable .",
    "it seems that this instability of the precessing period is typical for all binary systems where it is observed ( see clarkson et al .",
    "the orbital light curve of lmc x-4 obtained with ibis / integral during two orbital cycles in the high - state is shown in fig.[fig : lmc_orb ] .",

    ". if this is the case , cyclotron spectral feature is expected at energies @xmath8 kev @xmath9 kev ( here we take into account gravitational redshift of the neutron star assuming its radius @xmath10 km and mass @xmath11 ) . before integral there were several discrepant indications of possible cyclotron line feature in the spectrum of lmc x-4 .",
    "different authors ( levine et al . 1991 , mihara 1995 , woo et al .",
    "1996 , la barbera et al .",
    "2001 ) claimed the detection of a cyclotron absorption line in 19100 kev energy range .",
    "we performed analysis of the lmc x-4 broadband spectrum obtained with jem - x and ibis telescopes of the integral observatory during  @xmath0   300 kseconds of the source in the high state ( fig.[fig : lmc_spec ] ) .",
    "this analysis shows that the lmc x-4 average spectrum can be well fitted by a `` canonical '' pulsar model ( white et al .",
    "1983 ) , which consist of a simple powerlaw with the photon index of @xmath12   and a high energy cutoff at @xmath13   kev with @xmath14   kev ( @xmath15 per d.o.f . ) .    to search for a possible cyclotron resonance absorption line in the source spectrum it was included into the model .",
    "a centroid energy of the line was varied from 5 to 100 kev and other parameters were fitted . in this analysis",
    "we have not found any indications of the cyclotron resonance absorption in the source spectrum at the level more than @xmath16 .",
    "thus at the moment we can not confirm any results obtained earlier and make a final conclusion about the magnetic field value in the source .",
    "more detailed analysis of the integral data is now in progress .",
    "the x - ray pulsar exo1722 - 36 was regularly observed by integral observatory during the core program scans of the galactic plane and during the ultra deep observations of the galactic center .",
    "the source was clearly detected with a high statistical significance at the energies up to @xmath060 kev .",
    "angular resolution , available with the integral telescopes allowed us to improve the localization of the source ( see lutovinov et al .",
    "2003 for the preliminary results ) in comparison with that measured by the exosat observatory ( warwick et al .",

    "is shown with the black circle .    ]    ]    the long term observations of the source during the ultra deep exposure of the galactic center revealed variability of the source x - ray flux on time scales of several days .",
    "this variability observed with integral / ibis ( 1860kev ) was also detected by rxte in the 320kev energy band ( markwardt , swank 2003 ) .",
    "the rxte / pca observations allowed to detect the modulations of exo1722 - 363 x - ray flux with a period of @xmath19 days which was interpreted as an orbital period .",
    "our measurements of the orbital period from hard x - ray light curve ( fig.[fig : exo_lc ] ) gives the value of @xmath20 days , in good agreement with rxte result .    in order to construct the broadband energy spectrum of the source with highest possible significance we combined the data of the integral and rxte observatories .",
    "rxte observatory performed a number of observations in 1998 - 2003 covering different orbital phases of the binary .",
    "the analysis of the integral / ibis data showed that the shape of the hard x - ray part of the spectrum did not change inspite of the strong flux variability ( with possible exception of the eclipse period ) , therefore in fig.[fig : exo_spec ] we present the hard x - ray part of the spectrum of exo 1722 - 363 averaged over all available data ( integral / ibis and rxte / hexte ) .",
    "however , low energy part of the spectrum ( 320 kev ) strongly depends on the orbital phase .",
    "the value of photoabsorption column strongly varies with the orbital phase and can reach value of the order of @xmath21 @xmath22 ( see also tawara et al .",
    "examples of the source spectrum during different orbital phases are presented in fig.[fig : exo_spec ] .",
    "it should be noted that the spectrum of the source detected by the rxte / pca is strongly contaminated by a contribution of the galactic ridge emission .",
    "the spectra presented in fig.[fig : exo_spec ] were corrected for this contribution ( using the method similar to that used in revnivtsev 2003 ) . in this proceedings",
