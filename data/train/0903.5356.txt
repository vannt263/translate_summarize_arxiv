    "( [ schwinger ] ) is that the fermion sector is not modified in @xmath4 spacetime at one loop order .",
    "this means that different from the gauge boson , a two dimensional fermion does not know whether the spacetime is commutative or not and will respond in the same way in either case . since there is an exact mapping between the fermionic and bosonic theories in two dimensional spacetime , the same is true for a scalar . from this one",

    "it is straightforward to derive from eqn .",
    "( [ schwinger ] ) the three - photon vertex and it reads : @xmath59 where photon momenta @xmath60 , @xmath61 and @xmath62 satisfy @xmath63 .        [ loop ]    there are two one - loop diagrams for the self - energy of the gauge boson , as shown in fig .",
    "1 . we do not include the tadpole diagrams since they are identically zero . in the commutative schwinger model it is the well - known fact that the fermion - loop diagram dynamically generates a mass for the photon field ; the result is @xmath64 @xcite .",
    "the mass generation is due to the ir behavior of the intermediate state formed by a fermion - antifermion pair .",
    "recall that the lagrangian defined by ( [ schwinger ] ) has another lorentz invariant dimensionful constant , the noncommutativity parameter @xmath0 .",
    "it is natural at this point to expect that the photon mass is going to be changed by the photon - loop diagram .",
    "however , as we shall show by explicit calculation , this is not the case .",
    "the photon - loop diagram gives @xmath65 where @xmath66 and @xmath67 are photon propagators and @xmath68 is a symmetry factor .",
    "note that this integral is gauge independent . by naive power counting , the photon - loop diagram is quadratically divergent .",
    "we use the dimensional regularization scheme and evaluate the integrals in @xmath69 dimensional spacetime to extract possible singularities . as a matter of fact , explicit calculation shows that all spurious poles cancel each other and the diagram is well - defined and finite . remarkably , the degree of divergence is lower than expected because of the gauge symmetry .",
    "the same striking phenomenon happens for the fermion - loop diagram , whose superficial degree of divergence is 0 .",
    "the calculation is straightforward and we report here the final result for the photon - loop diagram : @xmath70 this result shows that instead of contributing to the photon mass , the radiative correction due to the photon loop generates a new type of operator .",
    "the independence of the schwinger mass on the noncommutativity of spacetime makes sense since the mechanism for the photon mass generation is purely an ir effect .",
    "in fact , one can show that the term @xmath71 corresponds to the dimension four operator @xmath72 .",
    "therefore , a higher derivative term is dynamically generated due to the noncommutativity of spacetime .",
    "note that at quadratic order in the fields the @xmath0-expanded action of a noncommutative theory is the same as in the commutative theory .",
    "this means that the @xmath73 part of the classical noncommutative schwinger model contains only interaction terms .",
    "the higher derivative kinetic terms will not show up in the classical action .",
    "thus the appearance of the operator @xmath74 is a pure quantum effect .",
    "higher derivative terms are also discovered in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the quantization of noncommutative qed via the seiberg - witten map is investigated .",
    "it is argued that because of the existence of nonrenormalizable vertices in the @xmath0-expanded action , higher derivative terms allowed by symmetries should be added to extend the action in order to absorb the divergences .",
    "it is realized later @xcite that higher derivative terms are in fact a part of the seiberg - witten map .",
    "a remarkable difference here is that while the term @xmath75 is of order @xmath0 in the noncommutative qed action , it appears in second order in @xmath0 in the noncommutative schwinger model .",
    "this is due to the fact that the coupling constant @xmath24 is dimensionful in two dimensional spaccetime .",
    "besides , our calculation shows that while the radiative corrections to the photon self - energy are divergent in noncommutative qed , they are finite in the noncommutative schwinger model . hence , like the generation of the photon mass , the appearance of the operator @xmath74 is a dynamical effect .",
    "we next consider the issue of unitarity . including the higher derivative term generated by the photon loop into the lagrangian ( [ schwinger ] ) , the extended gauge sector becomes generated by the fermion loop since the following discussion on unitarity does not depend on the pole of the photon propagator . ]",
    "@xmath76 where @xmath77 .",
    "the positive sign of the higher derivative term assures the vacuum stability . @xmath78 and",
    "the photon mass @xmath79 are related by the relation @xmath80    theories with the lowest - order higher derivative operators contain states with negative norm , that is , ghost states .",
    "in fact , defining @xcite @xmath81,\\\\ \\bar { a}_{\\mu } & = & { 1 \\over m_{\\theta}^{2 } } \\left [ \\box   a_{\\mu } - \\partial_{\\mu } \\left ( \\partial \\cdot a \\right ) \\right],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] eqn .",
    "( [ gauge ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath82 the unusual positive sign of the kinetic term of the field @xmath83 means that @xmath83 particles are massive ghosts .",
    "the last two terms in eqn .",
    "( [ gauge2 ] ) connect the two hilbert spaces where @xmath84 and @xmath83 particles live respectively and cause the nonconservation of the ghost number .",
    "this would result in the loss of unitarity .",
    "note that different from the photon mass , which is independent of the noncommutativity parameter @xmath0 , the mass of ghost fields @xmath83 depends on both dimensionful parameters in the theory . since states with @xmath83 particles decouple from the theory in the limit @xmath85 , unitarity violation is caused by noncommutativity of spacetime .",
    "this is consistent with the well - known fact that @xmath5 leads to unitarity violation @xcite .    however , as was argued in ref .",
    "@xcite , a physical @xmath86 matrix defined between stable states is still well - behaved as long as ghost particles can decay and do not show up as asymptotic states . in the noncommutative schwinger model this requires @xmath87 as a result , an interacting field theory with higher derivative operators can still make sense even though unitary is lost at a high energy scale of order @xmath78 , the ghost mass . in that sense , even though interaction terms between massive ghost fields and physical fields cause a flaw in the theory , they provide a cure in the meantime .    as a final point ,",
    "let us observe the higher loop effects .",
    "because of the existence of the three - photon interaction term , which is non - renormalizable by naive power counting , higher - order 1pi vacuum polarization diagrams will in principle generate an infinite number of higher derivative operators . however , it is not a difficult exercise to show that a theory with higher derivative kinetic terms can always be rewritten as another equivalent theory which involves more fields ( at least one of them is a ghost if the lowest - order higher derivative kinetic terms exist in the original theory ) and contains terms with at most two derivatives in it .",
    "therefore , the above argument still holds .",
    "even though we have only done calculations for the noncommutative schwinger model , we have reasons to believe the emergence of higher derivative operators is a feature for other theories with space - time noncommutativity .",
    "this is because for any theory expansions in @xmath0 absolutely contain nonrenormalizable vertices . as a result , by power - counting analysis higher derivative operators obeying symmetries",
    "will be generated in loop diagrams .",
    "since higher derivative kinetic terms obey the same symmetries as the classical two - derivative kinetic terms , they shall naturally be generated by the polarization diagrams .",
    "thus , from the above discussion we conclude that in the framework of the seiberg - witten map the feature of non - unitarity for a noncommutative field theory with @xmath88 is characterized by the presence of higher derivative kinetic terms .",
    "that is , the @xmath0-expanded version of a unitary theory will not generate the lowest - order higher derivative kinetic terms .",
    "the purpose of this paper has been to show via a study of the noncommutative schwinger model that the noncommutativity of space - time , though still waiting for the experimental proof , provides an explanation for the emergence of higher derivative kinetic terms in a field theory .",
    "our focus on the noncommutative schwinger model bypasses unrelevant complexities as can be seen by comparing eqn .",
    "( [ 1staction ] ) and eqn .",
    "( [ schwinger ] ) .",
    "this simplicity is mainly because a two dimensional fermion is insensitive to the noncommutativity of spacetime up to order @xmath31 .",
    "in addition , issues related to the breakdown of lorentz invariance are avoided in two dimensional spacetime .",
