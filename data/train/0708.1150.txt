    "new publications are added to the scholarly record at an accelerating pace .",
    "this point is realized by observing the evolution of the amount of publications indexed in thomson scientific s citation database over the last fifteen years : 875,310 in 1990 ; 1,067,292 in 1995 ; 1,164,015 in 2000 , and 1,511,067 in 2005 .",
    "however , the extent of the scholarly record reaches far beyond what is indexed by thompson scientific . while thompson scientific focuses primarily on quality - driven journals ( roughly 8,700 in 2005 ) , they do not index more novel scholarly artifacts such as preprints deposited in institutional or discipline - oriented repositories , datasets , software , and simulations that are increasingly being considered scholarly communication units in their own right .    while the size ( and growth ) of the scholarly record is impressive , the extent of its use is even more staggering .",
    "for instance , in november 2006 , elsevier s science direct , which provides access to articles from approximately 2,000 journals , celebrated its 1 billionth full - text download since counting started in april of 1999 . and",
    ", again , the extent of scholarly usage clearly reaches far beyond elsevier s repository .",
    "furthermore , usage events include not only full - text downloads , but also events such as requesting services from linking servers , downloading bibliographic citations , emailing abstracts , etc .    to a large extent ,",
    "the effect of usage behavior on the scholarly process is a horizon that is only beginning to be understood and , if properly studied , will offer clues to the evolutionary trends of science @xcite , quantitative models of the value of scholarly artifacts @xcite , and services to support scholars @xcite .",
    "the andrew w. mellon funded mesur project at the research library of the los alamos national laboratory aims at developing metrics for assessing scholarly communication artifacts ( e.g.  articles , journals , conference proceedings , etc . ) and agents ( e.g.  authors , institutions , publishers , repositories , etc . ) on the basis of scholarly usage . in order to do this ,",
    "the mesur project makes use of a representative collection of bibliographic , citation and usage data .",
    "this data is collected from a wide variety of sources including academic publishers , secondary publishers , institutional linking servers , etc .",
    "expectations are that the collected data will eventually encompass tens of millions of bibliographic records , hundreds of millions of citations , and billions of usage events .",
    "mining such a vast data set in an efficient , performing , and flexible manner presents significant challenges regarding data representation and data access .",
    "this article presents , the owl ontology @xcite used by mesur to represent bibliographic , citation and usage data in an integrated manner .",
    "the proposed mesur ontology is practical , as opposed to all encompassing , in that it represents those artifacts and properties that , as previously shown in @xcite , are realistically available from modern scholarly information systems .",
    "this includes bibliographic data such as author , title , identifier , publication date and usage data such as the ip address of the accessing agent , the date and time of access , type of usage , etc .",
    "finally , another novel contribution of this work is the hybrid storage and access architecture in which relational database and triple store technology are combined .",
    "this is achieved by storing core data and relationships in the triple store and auxiliary data in a relational database .",
    "this design choice is driven by the need to keep the size of the triple store to a level that can realistically be handled by current technologies .",
    "the combination of the data architecture and scholarly ontology presented in this article provide the foundation for the large - scale modeling and analysis of scholarly artifacts and their usage .",
    "a semantic network ( sometimes called a multi - relational network or multi - graph ) is composed of a set of nodes ( representing heterogeneous artifacts ) connected to one another by a set of qualified , or labeled , edges @xcite . in a graph",
    "theoretic sense , a semantic network is a directed labeled graph .",
    "because an edge is labeled , two nodes can be connected to one another by an infinite number of edges . however , in most cases , the possible interconnections between node types is constrained to a predetermined set .",
    "this predetermined set is made explicit in the semantic network s associated ontology .",
    "an ontology is generally defined as a set of abstract classes , their relationship to one another , and a collection of inference rules for deriving implicit relationships @xcite .",
    "an ontology makes no explicit reference to the actual instances of the defined abstract classes ; this is the role of the semantic network .",
    "an ontology is related to the developer s api in object oriented programming languages such as c++ and java ( minus the explicit representation of class methods / functions ) .",
    "for example , the set of relationships of an ontological class are known as the class properties and , in the object oriented lexicon , can be understood as class fields .",
    "also , a taxonomy is usually expressed in a semantic network ontology .",
    "a taxonomy of sub- and super - classes support the inheritance of class properties .",
    "for instance , if all mammals are warm blooded , then all humans are warm blooded because all humans are mammals . in an inheritance hierarchy , the warm blooded property of mammals is inherited by all sub - classes of mammal ( e.g.  human ) .",
    "figure [ fig : ont - inst - demo ] diagrams the relationship between an ontology and its semantic network instantiation .",
    "the circles represents objects that are instances of the dash - dot pointed to abstract classes ( the squares ) .",
    "the three lower squares are subclasses of a more general top - level class ( denoted by the dashed edges ) .",
    "the horizontal edges in the ontology denote permissible property types in the instantiation and thus , corresponding horizontal labeled edges in the semantic network may exist .",
    "figure [ fig : ont - inst - demo ] does not expose the range of conceptual nuances that can be expressed by modern ontology languages and thus , only provides a rudimentary representation of the relationship between an ontology and its semantic network instantiation .",
    ", scaledwidth=30.0% ]      the most popular semantic network representational framework is the resource description framework and schema , or rdf(s ) @xcite .",
    "rdf(s ) represents all nodes and edges by universal resource identifiers ( uri ) @xcite .",
    "the uri approach supports the use of namespacing such that the uri ` http://www.science.org#article ` has a different meaning , or connotation , than what may be understood by the uri ` http://www.newspaper.net#article ` .",
    "the web ontology language ( owl ) is an extension of rdf(s ) that supports a richer vocabulary ( e.g.  promotes many set theoretical concepts ) @xcite .",
    "protg is perhaps the most popular application for designing owl ontologies @xcite .",
    "while owl is primarily a machine readable language , an owl ontology can be diagrammed using the unified modeling language s ( uml ) class diagrams ( i.e.  entity relationship diagrams ) .",
    "modern semantic network data stores represent the relationship between two nodes by a _",
    "triple_. for instance , the triple @xmath0    , scaledwidth=40.0% ]    states that the resource identified by @xmath1 knows the resource identified by @xmath2 , where @xmath1 and @xmath2 are nodes and ` http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/#knows ` is a directed labeled edge ( see figure [ fig : foaf - mini ] ) .",
    "the meaning of ` knows ` is fully defined by the uri ` http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/ ` .",
    "the union of instantiated foaf triples is a foaf semantic network .",
    "current platforms for storing and querying such semantic networks are called _",
    "triple stores_. many open source and proprietary triple stores currently exist .",
    "various querying languages exist as well @xcite .",
    "the role of the query language is to provide the interface to access the data contained in the triple store .",
    "this is analogous to the relationships between sql and relational databases .",
    "perhaps the most popular triple store query language is sparql @xcite .",
    "an example sparql query is    .... select   ?",
    "x where    ( ?",
    "x foaf : knows vub : cgershen ) . ....    in the above query , the ` ?",
    "x ` variable is bound to any node that is the domain of a triple with an associated predicate of ` http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/#knows ` and a range of ` http://homepages.vub.ac.be/#cgershen ` .",
    "thus , the above query returns all people who know ` vub : cgershen ` ( i.e.  carlos gershenson ) .",
    "the ontology plays a significant role in many aspects of a semantic network .",
    "figure [ fig : full - system ] demonstrates the role of the ontology in determining which real world data is harvested , how that data is represented inside of the triple store ( semantic network ) , and finally , what queries and inferences are possible to execute .    , scaledwidth=37.5% ]",
    "in general , an ontology s classes , their relationships , and inferences are determined according to what is being modeled , for what problems that model is trying to solve , and how that model s classes can be instantiated according to real world data .",
    "thus , there were three primary requirements to the development of the mesur ontology :    1 .",
    "realistically available real world data 2 .",
    "ability to study usage behavior 3 .",
    "scalability of the triple store instantiation .    without real - world data ,",
    "an ontology serves only as a conceptual tool for understanding a particular domain and , in such cases , ontologies of this nature may be very detailed in what they represent .",
    "however , for ontologies that are designed to be instantiated by real world data , the ontology is ultimately constrained by data availability .",
    "thus , the mesur ontology is constrained to bibliographic and usage data since these are the primary sources of scholarly data . in the scholarly community , while articles , journals , conference proceedings , and the like are well documented and represented in formats that lend themselves to analysis , other information , such as usage data , tends to be less explicit due to the inherent privacy issues surrounding individual usage behavior .",
    "therefore , a primary objective of the mesur project is the acquisition of large - scale usage data sets from providers world - wide .",
    "the purpose of the mesur project is to study usage behavior in the scholarly process and therefore , usage modeling is a necessary component of the mesur ontology . given both usage and bibliographic data , it will be possible to generate and validate metrics for understanding the ` value ' of all types of scholarly artifacts .",
    "currently , the scholarly community has one primary means of understanding the value of a journal and thus its authors : the isi impact factor @xcite . with a semantic network data structure that includes not only article ( and thus , journal ) citation , but also authorship , usage , and institutional relationships , new metrics that not only rank journals , but also conferences , authors , and institutions will be created and validated .",
    "finally , the proposed ontology was engineered to handle an extremely large semantic network instantiation ( on the order of 50 million articles with a corresponding 1 billion usage events ) .",
    "the mesur ontology was engineered to make a distinction between required base - relationships and those , that if needed , can be inferred from the base - relations .",
    "futhermore , due to the fact that the mesur ontology was developed to support the large - scale analysis of usage , many of the metadata properties such as article title or author name are not explicitly represented in the ontology and thus , as will be demonstrated , such data can be accessed outside the triple store by reference to a relational database .",
    "other efforts have produced and exploited scholarly ontologies , but they do not cover the needs of the mesur project for two primary reasons .",
    "first , they generally lack the integration of publication , citation and usage data , which mesur requires in order to represent and analyze these crucial stages of the public scholarly communication process .",
    "second , scalability appears to not have been a major concern when designing the ontologies and thus , instantiating them at the order of what mesur will be representing is unfeasible . sometimes , the ontology is too elaborate , adding complexity that rarely pays off for the simple reason that it is hard to realistically come by data to populate defined properties ( e.g.  detailed author or affiliation information ) .",
    "other times , the ontology requires the storage of information that can not realistically be represented for vast data collections using current triple store technologies .",
    "several scholarly ontologies are available in the daml ontology library .",
    "while they focus on bibliographic constructs , they do not model usage events .",
    "the same is true of the semantic community web portal ontology @xcite , which , in addition maintains many detailed classes whose instantiation is unrealistic given what is recorded by modern scholarly information systems .",
    "the scholonto ontology was developed as part of an effort aimed at enabling researchers to describe and debate , via a semantic network , the contributions of a document , and its relationship to the literature @xcite .",
    "while this ontology supports the concept of a scholarly document and a scholarly agent , it focuses on formally summarizing and interactively debating claims made in documents , not on expressing the actual use of documents .",
    "moreover , support for bibliographic data is minimal whereas support for discourse constructs , not required for mesur , is very detailed .",
    "the abc ontology @xcite was primarily engineered as a common conceptual model for the interoperability of a variety of metadata ontologies from different domains .",
    "although the abc ontology is able to represent bibliographic and usage concepts by means of constructs such as artifact ( e.g. article ) , agent ( e.g. author ) , and action ( e.g. use ) , it is designed at a level of generality that does not directly support the granularity required by the mesur project .",
    "an interesting ontology - based approach was developed by the ingenta metastore project @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , again , the ingenta ontology does not support expressing usage of scholarly documents , which is a primary concern in mesur .",
    "nevertheless , the approach is inspiring because ingenta faces significant challenges regarding scalability of the ontology - based representation , storage and access of their bibliographic metadata collection , which covers approximately 17 million journal articles .",
    "however , the scale of the mesur data set is several orders of magnitude larger , calling for optimizations wherever possible .",
    "for example , given the mesur project s focus on usage , storing bibliographic properties ( author names , abstract , titles , etc . ) in the triple store , as done by ingenta , is not essential . as a result , in order to improve triple store query efficiency , mesur stores such data in a relational database , and the mesur ontology does not explicitly represent these literals .",
    "the principles espoused by the ontologyx ontology are inspiring .",
    "ontologyx uses _ context _ classes as the  glue \" for relating other classes , an approach that was adopted for the mesur ontology .",
    "for instance , the mesur ontology does not have a direct relationship between an article and its publishing journal .",
    "instead , there exists a publishing context that serves as an n - ary operator uniting a journal , the article , its publication date , its authors , and auxiliary information such as the source of the bibliographic data .",
    "the context construct is intuitive and allows for future extensions to the ontology .",
    "ontologyx also helped to determine the primary abstract classes for the mesur ontology .",
    "unfortunately , ontologyx is a proprietary ontology for which very limited public information is available , making direct adoption unfeasible for mesur . as a matter of fact",
    ", all inspiration was derived from a single powerpoint presentation from the 2005 fbrb workshop @xcite .    finally , in the realm of usage data",
    "representation , no ontology - based efforts were found .",
    "nevertheless , the following existing schema - driven approaches were explored and served as inspiration : the openurl contextobject approach to facilitate oai - pmh - based harvesting of scholarly usage events @xcite , the xml log standard to represent digital library logs @xcite , and the counter schema to express journal level usage statistics @xcite .",
    "the mesur project makes use of a triple store to represent and access its collected data .",
    "while the triple store is still a maturing technology , it provides many advantages over the relational database model . for one ,",
    "the network - based representation supports the use of network analysis algorithms . for the purposes of the mesur project , a network - based approach to data analysis will play a major role in quantifying the value of the scholarly artifacts contained within it .",
    "other benefits that are found with triple store technologies that are not easily reproducible within the relational database framework include ease of schema extension and ontological inferencing .",
    "a novel contribution of the presented ontology is its solution to the problem of scalability found in modern triple store technologies @xcite .",
    "while semantic networks provide a flexible medium for representing and searching knowledge , current triple store applications do not support the amount of data that can be represented at the upper limit of what is possible with modern relational database technologies .",
    "therefore , it was necessary to be selective of what information is actually modeled by the mesur ontology . for the mesur project , much of the data associated with each scholarly artifact is maintained outside the triple store in a relational database .",
    "the typical bibliographic record contains , for example , an article s identifiers ( e.g.  doi , sici , etc . ) , authors , title , journal / conference / book , volume , issue , number , and page numbers .",
    "typical usage information contains , for example , the users identifier ( e.g.  ip address ) , the time of the usage event , and a session identifier .",
    "an example of the various bibliographic and usage properties are outlined in the table [ tab : docprop ] and table [ tab : useprop ] , respectively .",
    "note that the connection between the bibliographic record and the usage event occurs through the doc_id ( bolded properties ) .",
    "the doc_id is a internally generated identifier created during the mesur project s ingestion process .",
    ".example bibliographic properties [ tab : docprop ] [ cols=\"<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     the two tables demonstrate how bibliographic and usage data can be easily represented in a relational database . from the relational database representation , a rdf n - triple data file can be generated .",
    "one such solution for this relational database to triple store mapping is the d2r mapper @xcite .",
    "however , note that not all data in the relational database is exported to this intermediate format . instead",
    ", only those properties that promote triple store scalability and usage research were included .",
    "thus , article titles , journal issues and volumes , names of authors , to name a few , are not explicitly represented within the triple store and thus , are not modeled by the ontology . if a particular artifact property that is not in the ontology is required for a computation , the computing algorithm references the relational database holding the complete representation the acquired data .",
    "for example , bi - directional resolution of the artifact with doc_id @xmath3 is depicted in figure [ fig : query - model ] where the resolving identifier is specific to the artifact ( for the sake of diagram readability , assume that @xmath3 is b5e1ab73 - 26b5 - 41f0-a83f - b47b4d737 from table [ tab : docprop ] and [ tab : useprop ] ) .",
    "this model is counter to what is seen in other scholarly ontologies such as the ingenta ontology @xcite .",
