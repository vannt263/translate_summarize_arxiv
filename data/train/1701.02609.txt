    "according to the most updated version of the open cluster catalogue compiled by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* as of 2016 january ) , a very limited number of objects have been studied with some detail .",
    "indeed , many of the catalogue s entries correspond to stellar overdensities ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) which deserve further analyses in order to confirm their physical nature .",
    "hence , we have recently made use of available multi - band imaging with the aim of improving the statistics of well studied open clusters .",
    "we assessed the reality of the observed catalogued objects as real open clusters and , for those confirmed , estimated their structural and fundamental parameters , studied their dynamical evolution , etc ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .    in this paper",
    "we complete the analysis of every open cluster observed through the johnson @xmath6 , kron - counsins @xmath7 and washington @xmath1 photometric passbands during the observing campaign carried out at the cerro tololo inter - american observatory ( ctio ) , chile , in 2011 january 31february 4 ( ctio programme # 2011a-0114 , pi : clari ) .",
    "the objects had been originally selected to examine how the abundance gradient in the galactic disc evolved in time and along different galactic longitudes by comparing the abundance gradients corresponding to various groups of open clusters of different ages and positions .",
    "the greater the number of open clusters with well determined parameters , the more precise and detailed the analysis of the metal abundance gradient in the galactic disc as well as its evolution over time .",
    "the present sample comprises unstudied or poorly studied catalogued open clusters that are relatively bright , are composed by a small number of stars and have a relatively compact appearance . in section 2 we describe the collection and reduction of the available photometric data in order to build extensive and reliable data sets .",
    "we carefully evaluated the physical reality of the cluster sample from colour - magnitude and colour - colour diagrams in section 3 , while in section 4 we estimate the fundamental parameters of the confirmed stellar aggregates and discuss the results .",
    "finally , section 7 summarizes the main conclusions of this work .",
    "the national optical astronomy observatory ( noao ) science data management ( sdm ) archives interface were used to download the whole set of publicly available calibration and programme images .",
    "the data processing , the calibration to the standard photometric systems and the point spread function photometry for the programme fields were carried out altogether with some peviously studied objects , as described in @xcite .",
    "we included here two catalogued open clusters ( eso371 - 25 and 561 - 5 ) for which washington @xmath8 images are publicly available and had not paid particular attention to them until now .",
    "the data reduction and photometry for these two objects were performed as described in @xcite .",
    "the log of the observations for the presently studied objects with the main astrometric and observational information is summarized in table  [ tab : table1 ] .    [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "with the aim of improving the statistics of well studied open clusters , we present a multi - band photometric analysis of 15 catalogued open clusters .",
    "the selected sample was chosen on the basis of the relative high brightness and compact appearance of the candidates and because they had not been studied or poorly studied at the time of designing the observational campaign .",
    "we used publicly available johnson @xmath6 , kron - cousins @xmath7 and washington @xmath9 images obtained at ctio to produce photometric data sets from which we built six cmds and three different cc diagrams per object covering wavelengths from the blue up to the near - infrared .",
    "this unprecedented multi - band coverage allowed us to thoroughly judged their reality as stellar aggregates .    in order to reliably assess on their physical nature we statistically assigned to each observed star in a given field a probability of being a fiducial feature of that field in terms of its local luminosity function , colour distribution and stellar density .",
    "this was accomplished by using a powerful technique that makes use of cells varying in position and size in the cmds to disentangle the fiducial from the contaminating field stars . to that purpuse",
    "we first traced the cluster stellar radial profiles and estimated their radii that were used to delimit the region to examine .",
    "likewise , we took advantage of accurate parallaxes and proper motions measured by the _",
    "gaia _ satellite to help our decision on the open cluster reality .",
    "contrarily to what could be expected , as judged from the objects brightness and compactness , 10 catalogued aggregates did not show any hint of being real physical systems .",
    "three of them ( eso383 - 10 , eso437 - 61 and hogg9 ) had been treated as open clusters in previous photometric studies .",
    "thus , this result points to the need of a thorough examination of any group of stars believed to be a physical entity by its only appearance in the sky . on the other hand",
    ", we estimated reliable fundamental parameters for the remaining 5 studied objects , which were confirmed as real open clusters . by exploiting the wealth of photometric data sets in combination with theoretical isochrones , we found out that the clusters in our sample are in wide age range , 8.0 @xmath2 @xmath3(@xmath4 yr@xmath5 ) @xmath2 9.4 , of solar metal content and placed between 2.0 and 5.5 kpc from the sun .",
    "they resulting astrophysical properties are in agreement with the updated known picture of the spatial distribution of ages / metallicities of open clusters in the galactic disc .",
    "this work has made use of data from the european space agency ( esa ) mission _ gaia _ ( http://www.cosmos.esa.int/gaia ) , processed by the _",
    "gaia _ data processing and analysis consortium ( dpac , http://www.cosmos.esa.int/web/gaia/dpac/consortium ) .",
    "funding for the dpac has been provided by national institutions , in particular the institutions participating in the _ gaia _ multilateral agreement .",
    "we thank the anonymous referee whose thorough comments and suggestions allowed us to improve the manuscript ."
