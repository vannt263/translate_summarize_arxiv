    "if there is no action of  @xmath1 on  @xmath8 , then  @xcite suggests non - associative algebras that may play the role of the t - dual .",
    "another situation where non - associative algebras appear naturally are fell bundles over crossed modules or , equivalently , actions of crossed modules on @xmath9-algebras ( see @xcite ) .",
    "we relate these two appearances of non - associativity : the action of  @xmath0 always lifts to an action of a certain crossed module on  @xmath8 .",
    "its actions are equivalent to a certain type of non - associative fell bundle over  @xmath1 .",
    "such a fell bundle may be viewed as a continuous spectral decomposition for the dual @xmath1-action on a non - associative algebra of the type studied in  @xcite .",

    "t - duality is most often formulated for principal circle bundles .",
    "the case of non - free circle actions with finite stabilizers has been studied by bunke and schick in  @xcite .",

    "an action @xmath35 as above is determined uniquely by @xmath36 for @xmath37 and @xmath38 for @xmath39 because @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "the unitaries @xmath42 are such that @xmath43 .",

    "the assumptions above imply that  @xmath48 acts through a map to central , @xmath1-invariant unitaries in  @xmath8 , that is , by a map to @xmath49 .",
    "a homomorphism @xmath50 lifts uniquely to @xmath51 , and such a homomorphism appears as the obstruction to finding an action of  @xmath1 on  @xmath8 that lifts the given @xmath0-action on  @xmath7 .",
    "actions of the crossed module  @xmath52 may contain such a lifting obstruction , so that there is no longer any obstruction to lifting the action to one of  @xmath52 .",
    "besides proving the existence of liftings , we also classify them up to equivalence ; that is , we compute the equivariant brauer group with respect to the crossed module  @xmath52 : there is an exact sequence of abelian groups @xmath53 the surjection @xmath54 says that any continuous trace @xmath9-algebra over  @xmath7 carries an action of  @xmath52 lifting the given action of  @xmath0 on the spectrum .",
    "the description of the kernel is the same as for the @xmath1-equivariant brauer group , so our result says that whenever we may lift the action on  @xmath7 to an @xmath1-action on  @xmath8 , then there is a bijection between actions of @xmath52 and  @xmath1 on  @xmath8 .",
    "we also compute the analogue of the equivariant picard group for our crossed module actions , and get the same result as in the case of @xmath1-actions .",
    "thus the only effect of replacing  @xmath1 by the crossed module  @xmath52 is to remove the obstruction to the existence of actions .",

    "it consists of the abelian groups @xmath57 and @xmath58 , which are linked by the non - trivial associator @xmath59 we describe morphisms that give an equivalence between @xmath56 and the weak @xmath55-group associated to  @xmath52 .",
    "the crossed module actions above are strict , but there is a more flexible notion of weak action that makes sense for weak @xmath55-groups and @xmath55-groupoids as well , see  @xcite . the packer ",
    "raeburn stabilisation trick extends to crossed modules and shows that any weak action of a crossed module is equivalent to a strict action .",

    "thus we get the desired strict action of  @xmath52 once we construct a weak action of  @xmath56 .",
    "the weak actions we have in mind are equivalent to saturated fell bundles in the case of a group action . for actions of a weak @xmath55-group such as  @xmath56 , they are non - associative fell bundles over @xmath60 where the associator is given by unitaries coming from the action of @xmath61 . allowing weak actions",
    "simplifies the study of equivariant brauer groups , already in the group case .",
    "we reprove the obstruction theory for @xmath1-actions on continuous trace @xmath9-algebras along the way .",
    "the bigroup version of the result is only notationally more difficult .",
    "the crossed module  @xmath52 described above can be made slightly smaller : we may divide out the lattice  @xmath62 inside  @xmath48 , resulting in a compact group .",
    "this is so because the lifting obstructions that appear for @xmath0-actions on continuous trace algebras always vanish on the lattice  @xmath62 , and hence so do all the actions of  @xmath52 that appear .",
    "this feature , however , is special to actions of  @xmath1 that factor through the standard torus  @xmath63 . the existence result for actions of  @xmath52 still works for actions of  @xmath1 if the stabiliser lattices are allowed to vary continuously for different orbits .    to compute the lifting obstruction of a given continuous trace @xmath9-algebra",
    ", it suffices to consider a single free @xmath0-orbit , that is , the case of the standard translation action of  @xmath0 on itself .",
    "since  @xmath1 acts transitively on  @xmath0 , the transformation crossed module @xmath64 is equivalent in a suitable sense to the `` stabiliser '' of a point in  @xmath0 ; this gives the subcrossed module  @xmath65 of  @xmath52 with @xmath66 we do not develop the full theory of induction for crossed modules because the relevant special case is easy to do by hand .",
    "it turns out that actions of  @xmath52 on continuous trace @xmath9-algebras over  @xmath0 are equivalent to actions of  @xmath65 on continuous trace @xmath9-algebras over the point .",
    "since our whole theory is up to equivalence , this is the same as weak actions of  @xmath65 on the complex numbers  @xmath67 . replacing  @xmath65 by the corresponding sub-@xmath55-group @xmath68",
    ", it is straightforward to classify these .",
    "this also gives the equivariant brauer group for a single @xmath0-orbit , and then allows to identify the lifting obstruction , up to a sign maybe , with the family of dixmier  douady invariants of the restrictions of  @xmath8 to the orbits of the @xmath1-action .",
