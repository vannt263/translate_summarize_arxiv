    "the bottom panel reports the light curve in the optical  uv filters of uvot .",

    "li ( 2007 ) modeled numerically the corresponding transient emission specifically for type - ibc snae produced by the core collapse of wr stars surrounded by dense winds . however , for the case of grb  060218/sn2006aj such a model required an unrealistically large core radius of a wr progenitor star ( but see w07 ) .",
    "the interpretation of the observational properties of grb 060218 appeared therefore puzzling .",
    "ghisellini et al .",
    "( 2007 , hereafter paper i ) discussed the alternative possibility that the optical  to  x  ray radiation is non  thermal emission produced in a fireball moving with a moderate bulk lorentz factor ( @xmath27 ) , and the thermal x  ray component is due to some dissipation occurring within the jet ( possibly just below its photosphere ) .",
    "recently w07 fiercely argued against alternative interpretations by presenting the details of the shock break out hypothesis in as anisotropic sn explosion .",

    "3 ) that the rather slow increase of the surface emitting the x  ray  is not a natural consequence of the anisotropic shock breakout scenario , but rather favors an alternative interpretation , where the emitting surface is associated with the transparency radius of a relatively long lived , mildly relativistic ( @xmath28 a few ) jet . indeed , if the x ",
    "ray  is produced following a funnel / jet shear instability ( according to the ideas put forward by thompson 2006 and thompson , meszaros & rees 2007 ) , then the presence of the  component requires a small value of @xmath29 , of order @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the jet opening angle .",

    "we assume that the optical  uv emission up to @xmath0 s corresponds to the rayleigh ",

    "it is then possible to estimate the time dependence of the emitting surface . also the optical ",

    "thus it is possible to infer the bolometric luminosity and energetics .",
    "consider the surface emitting as a  expanding with a velocity @xmath32 , starting from an initial radius @xmath33 .",
    "in general , the expansion velocity of the photosphere will decrease with time .",

    "adopting the same dependence , the eq .",

    "[ r ] gives @xmath38 km s@xmath16 after 3 days , in agreement with the measurements reported by pian et al .",

    "we then assume that for @xmath39 s the optical  uv spectrum corresponds to the rayleigh ",
    "jeans part of a  spectrum : @xmath40 where the distance @xmath41 mpc .",
    "this in turn defines the temporal dependence of the  temperature : @xmath42 as the temperature decreases with time , the assumption that the emission is in the rayleigh  jeans regime of the  spectrum is appropriate , especially for the early data which set the most severe constraints to the total energetics . within the w07 s scenario ,",
    "the  peak is entering into the uvot band at @xmath43 s , and this implies that the temperature estimates at 1880   is slightly less than that estimated at all other wavelengths ( see fig .  2 ) .",

    "@xmath45 thus provides a proxy of the implied  energetics .",
    "the implied  luminosities are very large in the early phases , being of the order of @xmath46@xmath47 erg s@xmath16 , implying energetics @xmath1 erg ( bottom panel ) .",
    "this is comparable to the entire kinetic energy of sn2006aj , estimated to be @xmath48 erg by mazzali et al .",
    "( 2006 ) .",
    "we have considered different expansion laws , clearly bound by the condition @xmath49 , and other ( reasonable ) values for @xmath33 .",
    "the result does not change : at early times , i.e. for the smallest photospheric radii , the observed flux requires high temperatures , and thus large  luminosities .    _ the resulting energetics are too large to originate as emission from the heated sn envelope .",
    "_ therefore the observed flux is not  radiation , though it might correspond to the absorbed ( rayleigh  jeans ) portion of a spectrum becoming transparent below the shortest observed wavelengths .",
    "note that the @xmath4 dependence somehow relies on the assumed host extinction : less extinction implies a softer slope .",
    "indeed , sollerman et al .",
    "( 2006 ) argued for values @xmath50 and @xmath51 , significantly smaller than those adopted by c06 ( who required that the de  reddened optical ",
    "uv data follow a @xmath52 law ) . assuming the @xmath53 proposed by sollerman et al .",
    "( 2006 ) we showed ( in paper i ) that the optical  uv emission can still be part of a synchrotron spectrum , partially self  absorbed , connecting the optical - uv to the non  thermal x  ray flux .",
    "alternatively the optical  uv and x  ray fluxes could belong to two unrelated components : in this case the optical  uv and x  ray spectra should cut  off below 1880   and @xmath54 kev , respectively .",
    "both interpretations minimize the required energetics",
    ".    -1 true cm -0.5 true cm",
    "the fluxes corresponding to the x  ray  component reported in c06 and w07 increase until @xmath22 3000 s. such a component , albeit fainter , is still detected at about @xmath22 7000 s. in fig .  1 we report the x  ray light curve as presented in c06 and w07 together with the light curve inferred for the bolometric  flux to show that they follow the same trend , namely @xmath55 .",
    "the radius @xmath56 of the ( projected ) emitting surface can be derived directly from the fitting of the x  ray data , since the temperature of the x ",
    "ray  is determined and the distance of grb 060218 is known .",

    "( 2007 ) numerically examined the relevant characteristics of shock breakouts in wolf ",
    "rayet stars with strong winds , finding that although the presence of the wind allows to radiate more efficiently , the resulting luminosities are still insufficient to account for that observed from grb  060218 .",
    "also the predicted total duration of the event ( @xmath835 s ) is much shorter than observed ( @xmath8 30007000 s ) : indeed it is argued that possible anisotropies  although can partially increase the power generated  can not change the duration .",
    "w07 instead claimed that the wind opacity , by leading to a photospheric radius significantly exceeding the star radius , is the key ingredient to explain the large luminosity .",
    "furthermore , they state that the long event duration is evidence for anisotropy , whose origin however is different from that considered by li ( 2007 ) . according to w07 , because of the asymmetry the sn shock surface reaches transparency at different times , depending on the direction , thus accounting for the long lasting emission .",
    "since the luminosity increases with time , in this scenario the shock should radiate more sideways than along the polar axis .",
    "although this interpretation is certainly possible , its realization requires some fine tuning , as illustrated by the following simple example .",
    "assume for simplicity that the anisotropy concerns only the dependence of the shock velocity on the angle @xmath62 from the polar axis and that the whole emitting surface reaches transparency at the same radius @xmath56 from the stellar center .",
    "the projected area at time @xmath63 is given by @xmath64 the time derivative of eq .",
    "[ sobs ] leads to @xmath65 whose solution for @xmath62 is : @xmath66 .",
    "\\label{tsin}\\ ] ] for @xmath67 cm and @xmath68 cm s@xmath16 the condition @xmath69 at 7000 s implies @xmath70 cm . since the  emission lasts much longer than the characteristic light crossing time @xmath71 , light travel time effects can be neglected .",
    "thus the elapsed time @xmath63 since the beginning of the  emission is @xmath72 where @xmath73 . substituting eq .",
    "[ tsin ] in eq .",
    "[ v ] results in an almost constant velocity at small angles , decreasing as @xmath74 for larger @xmath62 .",
    "different velocity profiles ( or a dependence of the transparency radius on @xmath62 ) would produce a different behavior of the measured emitting surface .",
    "also , the observed increase of the  luminosity with time requires a specific profile in @xmath62 for the energy released by the shock .",
    "we propose that the nearly constancy of the  emitting surface supports an alternative scenario , in which most of the emission is produced at the transparency radius of a  grb \" jet . models along these lines",
    "have already been proposed by thompson ( 2006 ) and thompson , meszaros & rees ( 2007 ) in a different context : they suggest that the   component originates following shear instabilities between the jet and the funnel of the progenitor star and is of course released when the fireball becomes transparent . according to daigne & mochkovitch ( 2002 )",
    "this occurs at a radius @xmath75 where @xmath76 is the fireball kinetic power .",
    "the relevant radius for the  emission is then @xmath77 r_{\\rm ph}$ ] , which is comparable to the radii inferred from observations if the jet is not highly collimated and/or the bulk lorentz factor is small .",
    "the resulting isotropic  luminosity @xmath78 accounts for the observed one .",
    "following these lines , in paper i we estimated the energy requirements posed by assuming that either the  represents the  fossil \" radiation that accelerated the fireball in the first place , or it is produced at larger radii , following some dissipation event .",
    "the latter option was clearly favored : indeed in this case the photon energies do not degrade significantly due to expansion between the dissipation and the transparency radii , lowering the required energetics .    one possible origin of late dissipation is the process quoted above , proposed by thompson ( 2006 ) and thompson , meszaros & rees ( 2007 ) , namely shear instability between the fireball and the star funnel .",
    "the resulting energy peak of the  spectrum was then associated with the peak of the ( time integrated ) spectrum of the prompt emission , and this allowed them to account for the amati relation in terms of emission .",
    "note that grb 060218 obeys the amati relation , but only if the peak energy of the overall x  ray spectrum is considered ( i.e. not the  peak energy )    recently , by analyzing the sample of grbs observed both by batse onboard cgro and by the wide field camera onboard @xmath79sax , ghirlanda et al .",
    "( 2007 ) found that the presence of a dominating  component faces severe problems .",
    "note that all of the grbs considered follow the amati relation .",
    "therefore the fireball / funnel instability , if occurs , may not be responsible for the peak of the prompt spectrum , i.e. the bulk of the emission .",
    "we clearly can not exclude that it is responsible for  emission with lower temperature and luminosity , as observed in grb  060218 .    in all of the scenarios proposed to explain the peculiar properties of grb 060218 , it is assumed a bulk lorentz factor of order unity , i.e. a factor @xmath8100 smaller than the ` canonical ' value .",
    "the detection of the x ",
    "ray  might thus be associated with a small @xmath29 factor . indeed , a key point in the scenario by thompson et al .",
    "( 2007 ) concerns the value of @xmath29 required for efficient dissipation : this has to be of the order of @xmath80",
    ". this may be the clue to understand why  emission has been detected only in the spectrum of grb 060218 : for small@xmath29 fireballs the shear instability may be efficient enough to reveal itself through the presence of a  component , while for grb fireballs with @xmath81 this should not be detectable .",
    "grb 980425 is another event possibly characterized by a small @xmath29 fireball .",
    "thus it is a likely candidate to show observable emission in the soft x ",
    "rays , although it would have been impossible to reveal it with the detectors in 1998 .",
    "we have re  examined the possibility that the thermal components detected in the early phases of the optical and x  ray emission of grb 060218 are due to the shock breakout of the associated sn 2006aj .",
    "we have found that if the optical  uv radiation corresponds to the rayleigh ",
    "jeans part of a  spectrum , the data imply very large luminosities , especially at early times ( i.e. the first few thousands seconds after the trigger ) .",
    "the derived values can not be accounted for as emission by material in the envelope / wind of the star heated by the shock crossing .    instead",
    ", the proposed interpretation that the optical  uv  to  x  ray spectrum originates as non  thermal synchrotron emission appears tenable and has two major advantages : ( i ) the optical  uv spectrum can be softer than @xmath82 ( allowing a smaller optical extinction , as indicated by sollerman et al .",
    "2006 ) and ( ii ) the energy requirement is significantly reduced with respect to the shock breakout scenario .    the  spectrum detected in the x ",
    "ray band constrains the emitting surface to depend only weakly on time .",
    "the long total duration , which largely exceeds the light crossing time , led w07 to propose that the persistence of the  component is due to anisotropy , namely the fact that transparency is reached at different times by different parts of the shock surface , because either the shock velocity or the photospheric radius are functions of the polar angle .",
    "although this is a viable possibility , we have pointed out that only a specific dependence on the polar angle give rise to the observed behavior : in general , anisotropy implies that the resulting observed ( projected ) surface changes with time .",
    "instead , the almost constant x  ray emitting surface supports a scenario in which the x ",
    "ray  emission is produced inside a jet , before transparency is reached .",
    "the transparency radius corresponds to that inferred from observations if the bulk lorentz factor is small , of the order of a few .",
    "this is also the condition to develop efficient shear instability modes between the jet and the funnel , and explains why the x  ray  component can be rarely observable ( i.e. only when the bulk lorentz factor is of the order of the inverse of the jet opening angle ) .",
    "we noted that grb 060218 obeys the @xmath11@xmath10 ( amati ) relation only if the entire ( non  thermal ? ) x and @xmath3ray emission component , which peaks at @xmath83 kev , is considered ( the x  ray thermal emission peaks at too low energies ) .",
    "if this is not a coincidence , it implies that the physical process underlying the amati relation is robust and independent of the bulk lorentz factor .",
    "similar considerations hold for the lag  luminosity relation , which grb 060218 obeys as well .",
    "the bottom line of this re  analysis is that we are still puzzled about the self ",
    "consistency of the sn shock breakout interpretation of the optical , uv and thermal x  ray emission of grb  060218 .",
    "on the other hand , this bursts @xmath84 associated with sn 2006aj , and therefore some signs of the associated shock breakout should be present .",
    "why should we not observe it ?",
    "the simplest answer is that the emission associated with the shock break out is weaker than other spectral components .",
