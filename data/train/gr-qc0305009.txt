    "the theory we consider is einstein s gravity with the addition of a non - minimally coupled ( nmc ) real scalar field : [ l_cc ] = \\ { - 12 f ( ) r + 12 g^ _ , _ , - v ( ) } , where @xmath0 is the coupling function of the scalar @xmath1 to spacetime curvature , @xmath2 is an arbitrary scalar self - interaction and @xmath3 in our units .",
    "it is convenient to change variables into the `` einstein frame '' , in which the action ( [ l_cc ] ) reduces to the einstein - hilbert term plus a minimally coupled scalar field @xcite : [ lt ] l = \\ { - + 12 ^ _ , _ , - } .",
    "we will show that classical solutions @xmath4 $ ] of the system ( [ l_cc ] ) are dual to some other solutions @xmath5 $ ] .",
    "these dualities follow because for each einstein - frame solution @xmath6 $ ] of system ( [ lt ] ) , there are in general many corresponding physical solutions @xmath7 $ ] .",
    "because the factor @xmath8 multiplies the scalar curvature in the lagrangian ( [ l_cc ] ) , it is clear that the physical ( helicity two ) degrees of freedom of the gravitational field appear mixed with the scalar field .",
    "diagonalization of the physical ( or `` jordan - frame '' ) action ( [ l_cc ] ) can be achieved by means of a conformal transformation of the metric @xcite : [ cg ] _",
    "^2 g _ , under which the ricci scalar ( in four dimensions ) transforms as : [ cr ] r = ^-2 , where @xmath9 $ ] are covariant derivatives . using this expression in eq .",
    "( [ l_cc ] ) one obtains , after neglecting total derivatives : [ l2 ] \\ { - + ^ - } .    we want to rewrite this lagrangian in such a way that it resembles as much as possible the einstein - hilbert action plus a minimally coupled scalar field .",
    "hence , we take @xmath10 , where the upper choice of sign applies when @xmath11 , while the minus sign applies in the case @xmath12 .",
    "this substitution leads to : [ l3 ] \\ { 12 12 ^ _ , _ , ( + 32 ) - } . introducing a conformally transformed field and potential : @xmath13 and substituting into eq .",
    "( [ l3 ] ) we obtain : [ lf ] = \\ { - 12 + 12 ^ _ , _ , - ( ) } , which is , up to the global sign , simply the action for gravity with a minimally coupled scalar field and the choices of sign are the usual ones . ]    on account of eqs .",
    "( [ cg ] ) , ( [ tpsi ] ) and ( [ tv ] ) , the transformation is evidently singular if @xmath14 . at that point",
    "there is in fact a spacetime singularity which splits the theory into disconnected sectors @xcite . for transformation ( [ tpsi ] ) to make sense the terms inside the square root should be positive , that is : [ ineq ] + 32 0 .",
    "if this condition is violated , then the `` effective '' gravitons and scalars have energies with opposite signs and the theory is unstable@xcite .",
    "suppose that @xmath15 defined in eq .",
    "( [ tpsi ] ) is degenerate in @xmath1 , that is , there are @xmath16 ( @xmath17 ) values @xmath18 of the physical field @xmath1 which correspond to the same value of the einstein - frame field @xmath15",
    ". if this is true , then there are at least two physical solutions which are related by the conformal transformation defined by eqs .",
    "( [ cg ] ) , ( [ tpsi ] ) and ( [ tv ] ) : [ dual ] ( , , )    lllll ( _ 1 , g_1 , v_1 ) +   +   +   + ( _ 2 , g_2 , v_2 ) .    the up - down arrow is a _ duality _ relation that is found by using the conformal transformation and its inverse .",
    "the group formed by these transformations can be discrete ( e.g. , parity ) , continuous ( e.g. , scaling ) , or a combination of the two .",
    "consider the conformal function @xmath20 , where @xmath21 .",
    "we can integrate eq .",
    "( [ tpsi ] ) immediately , with the result : [ tp2 ] ( ) = , where @xmath22 is a positive integration constant , and the choice of sign is arbitrary .",
    "the simplest type of degeneracy is the one related to the choice of @xmath22 , which shifts @xmath15 up or down by a constant factor .",
    "the dualities associated with this degeneracy are rescalings of the scalar field by a constant , @xmath23 .",
    "a more profound type of duality arises from the arbitrary choice of the sign in eq .",
    "( [ tp2 ] ) .",
    "let s assume , without loss of generality , that @xmath24 .",
    "if @xmath25 , then a differing choice of signs in each case means that the solutions @xmath26 and @xmath27 are dual to each other ( see fig .",
    "1 ) : for each @xmath15 there are two associated physical fields , @xmath28 and @xmath29 . given a solution of the einstein and klein - gordon equations @xmath30 for the theory with potential @xmath31",
    ", there is a dual solution to those equations , @xmath32 , but with a different potential @xmath33 , which follows from eqs .",
    "( [ cg ] ) , ( [ tpsi ] ) and ( [ tv ] ) .",
    "defining @xmath34 , the dual theory is expressed in terms of the original one by : @xmath35    the relation between the `` effective newton s constant '' in the dual theory compared with the original one is : @xmath36 while the effective planck masses are related by : [ mpeff_2 ] m_p , eff^(b ) = m_p , eff^(a ) = m_p , eff^(a ) . if @xmath37 , then @xmath38 , which means that while in the original theory theory @xmath39 , in the dual theory @xmath40  i.e. , gravity is `` weak '' in the original , and `` strong '' in the dual theory .",
    "in fact , under duality all effective masses scale in the same way as the effective planck mass .",
    "take the theory with scalar potential : [ v_a ] v_a=_a m_a^4 ( ) ^n_a , where the coupling @xmath41 is a dimensionless constant , @xmath42 has dimensions of mass and @xmath43 is some integer .",
    "the potential in a dual theory with @xmath44 is given by eq .",
    "( [ du_pot ] ) : @xmath45 therefore , we can say that duality transforms all effective mass scales as : [ m_res ] m m_b = m_a .",
    "however , notice that since @xmath29 is in fact a dynamical variable , the dual theories are fundamentally different from each other . from inspection of eqs .",
    "( [ v_a ] ) and ( [ v_b ] ) , the exact statement is that duality transforms the parameters of the potential as follows : @xmath46 the dual of the case @xmath47 with mass @xmath48 , for instance , is an @xmath49 theory with coupling @xmath50 and mass scale @xmath51 .    in the present example with @xmath52 ,",
    "our duality takes @xmath53 .",
    "we now show that this duality is nothing but `` s - duality '' , a symmetry of the low - energy effective action of string theory which switches the sign of the dilaton field , @xmath54 . with a conformal factor @xmath55 ,",
    "consider the field redefinition : [ dil ] = 2 e^-/2 , leading to the action : [ l_st ] = e^- \\ { - 12 r + 12 g^ _ , _ , - e^ v ( ) } , which is just the low - energy effective action of string theory restricted to gravity and the dilaton .",
    "it is well known that the transformation @xmath56 , together with an accompanying weyl transformation of the metric , @xmath57 , leaves the action invariant  this is the so - called s - duality of low - energy string theory @xcite . by eq .",
    "( [ dil ] ) , this duality takes @xmath58 , which is exactly the type of duality that we have discussed . notice",
    "that choices of @xmath59 other than @xmath60 are obtained simply by shifting the dilaton by a constant .",
    "generalizing the previous results , consider a conformal factor @xmath62 , where @xmath59 and @xmath63 are positive real numbers . in this case",
    "the einstein - frame field is : @xmath64   \\ ; .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] it is easy to show that this expression reduces to eq .",
    "( [ tp2 ] ) when @xmath65 .",
    "the qualitative behavior of @xmath66 is the same as that of fig .",
    "1 .    in the example with @xmath67 , because of the purely logarithmic dependence , the arbitrary integration constant of @xmath15 translates into scaling invariance of the physical theory . in the present case ,",
    "the constant factor inside square brackets prevents the integration constant from being absorbed into the arcsinh .",
    "therefore , the case @xmath68 does not exhibit scaling invariance  duality now involves some transcendental relation between different values of the scalar field .",
    "it might still be worth noting that for @xmath69 the theory regains asymptotic scaling invariance in the limit @xmath70 .",
    "this is the usual case when one considers nmc scalar fields . for @xmath72 the coupling",
    "is said to be `` minimal '' , while @xmath73 corresponds to the so - called `` conformal coupling '' .",
    "this theory admits three stable sectors @xcite :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ ( @xmath26 ) @xmath74 ,    ( @xmath27 ) @xmath75 with @xmath76 , and    ( @xmath77 ) @xmath75 with @xmath78 . _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _    direct integration of eq .",

    "we have plotted @xmath81 in fig . 2 for the cases @xmath82 , @xmath73 and @xmath83 , with the choice @xmath84 to make the argument of the log positive ( a different choice with the same sign would only shift @xmath15 by a constant . )    the case @xmath82 , representing sector @xmath26 ( @xmath74 ) , is the simplest : @xmath15 is monotonic in @xmath1 . in this case",
    "there is no degeneracy and , hence , no duality .    the case @xmath73 ( the middle line at the sides of fig .",
    "2 ) is a threshold case : here , the einstein - frame field @xmath15 goes to zero when @xmath85 , so for each value of @xmath15 there are two associated values of the physical field @xmath1  one in sector @xmath27 , @xmath86 and @xmath87 , and one in sector @xmath77 , @xmath88 and @xmath89 . in this case expression ( [ tp ] ) simplifies considerably : [ tp_c ] ( ) = \\ {    lll ^-1[_b/ ] , _ b^2",

    "( [ cg ] ) and ( [ tv ] ) : @xmath94 it can be easily seen from eq .",
    "( [ du_c_p ] ) that this particular duality relates physical solutions @xmath29 and @xmath95 such that , for @xmath96 , @xmath97 , and for @xmath98 , @xmath99 .",

    ", the region @xmath101 ( between the poles ) corresponds to our sector @xmath27 , while region @xmath102 corresponds to our sector @xmath77 .",
    "as before , the choice of the integration constant was @xmath103 to make the argument of the @xmath104 in eq .",
    "( [ tp ] ) positive .",

    "2 , when @xmath105 , for each value of @xmath15 there are now _ three _ associated values of @xmath1  one in sector @xmath27 and one in each of the two independent branches of sector @xmath77 .",
    "explicit relations between the dual solutions are found by solving for the threefold degeneracy of eq .",
    "( [ tp ] ) . unfortunately ,",
    "it has not been possible to solve these equations exactly , except in the case @xmath73 explained above .",
    "nevertheless , it suffices for our purposes to inspect the asymptotic limits @xmath106 and @xmath107 .",

    "the dualities relate inequivalent theories for which the effective couplings scale by the conformal factor @xmath0 . in particular , the dualities relate theories for which gravity is weak with theories for which it is strong . in the simplest case , @xmath115 , these dualities reduce to the s - duality of low - energy effective string theory .",
