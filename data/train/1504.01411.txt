    "this illustrates the need for a direct experimental probe for the spin states of size - selected free molecular ions @xcite .",
    "one interesting aspect of the interplay of magnetism and chemical bonding in manganese is that large magnetic moments could in principle be obtained if the atomic mn @xmath7 high - spin state could be preserved in larger manganese entities and if parallel spin alignment could be achieved by long range ferromagnetic interaction .",

[ fig : xspectra ] the experimental @xmath26 x - ray absorption and xmcd spectra of mn@xmath42 and mn@xmath1 are shown along with the corresponding theoretical spectra of mn@xmath32 in its [ ar]@xmath33  @xmath34s ground state configuration . all spectra were normalized to the integrated signal of resonant @xmath43 transitions , i.e. , to the number of unoccupied @xmath6 states .",

    "[ fig : xspectra ] are identical in shape to the calculated spectrum @xcite of atomic mn@xmath32 in its ground state configuration .",
    "this immediately shows that the experimental spectra originate from an unperturbed atomic @xmath44 @xmath45 electronic configuration of the @xmath6 subshell , i.e. , the @xmath6 electrons form local high - spin states but do not or only very weakly participate in bonding @xcite in mn@xmath0 and mn@xmath1 .",
    "the fact that the @xmath6 orbitals remain atomically localized @xcite has implications for the geometric structure . for unperturbed @xmath6 orbitals",
    ", the overlap of @xmath6 electrons at different nuclei must be very weak .",
    "a rough estimate of the interatomic distance @xcite in mn@xmath0 and mn@xmath1 can therefore be made with the atomic manganese @xmath6 radial distribution function , from which it can be seen that the radial @xmath6 electron density decreases to less than 1 % of its maximum at @xmath46  , leading to a corresponding equilibrium distance for pure @xmath47 bonding @xmath48  .",
    "this estimate is in good agreement with calculated values @xcite of @xmath49  for mn@xmath0 and mn@xmath1 high - spin states .",
    "thus the equilibrium distance in mn@xmath0 is significantly larger than the nearest neighbor distance in bulk manganese @xcite of 2.24  but also larger than the typical bond distances of diatomic transition metal cations , e.g. ,  the experimental values @xcite of @xmath50  and @xmath51  , where @xmath6 orbitals participate in molecular bonding .",
    "for the lowest energy dissociation limit of mn@xmath0 into mn @xmath52s and mn@xmath32 @xmath53s , the localized @xmath7 high - spin states at the manganese cores and the delocalized single @xmath5 derived spin could couple to states with a total spin @xcite @xmath54 of @xmath55 in mn@xmath0 . in the following treatment",
    "we will assume for simplicity that the localized @xmath7 states first couple to a total @xmath6 spin @xmath56 and then with the single unpaired @xmath5 derived spin to give a total spin @xmath54 .",

    "the strong overshoot at 639.5 ev that is observed in the experimental spectra agrees better with the overshoot that is obtained in the calculated spectrum for the initial [ ar]@xmath57 configuration in the @xmath34s term ( solid line ) than in the @xmath35s term ( dashed line ) of mn@xmath32 .",
    "this indicates parallel @xmath58 coupling . ]",
    "applied to the experimental spectrum , the orbital angular momentum sum rule of xmcd @xcite yields a molecular orbital magnetic moment of @xmath59 @xmath3 for mn@xmath0 and clearly indicates a @xmath60 ground state .",
    "the total angular momentum @xmath61 of mn@xmath0 thus is exclusively spin .",
    "because of the identical atomic @xmath44 signature in the x - ray absorption and xmcd spectra , the experimental @xmath6 spin magnetization can be obtained by fitting the calculated mn@xmath32 xmcd signal to the experimental mn@xmath0 spectrum @xcite after normalization .",
    "this circumvents the empiric correction @xcite that would be required to the xmcd spin sum rule @xcite for manganese . from the fit of the calculated xmcd of mn@xmath32 to the experimental spectrum of mn@xmath0 in fig .",
    "[ fig : xspectra ] , a total @xmath6 spin magnetization of @xmath62 is determined .",
    "this rules out all states with @xmath63 and leaves only six possible states with @xmath64 , @xmath65 , and @xmath66 .",
    "the temperature at which @xmath56 of these states would reach a magnetization of @xmath67 at @xmath68 t is given by the brillouin function for the total spin @xmath54 .",
    "an ion temperature of @xmath69 k that would be necessary for the @xmath70 states can be ruled out because the experiment was performed at a temperature of the ion trap of @xmath71 k and radio - frequency heating of the ions is inevitable at our conditions @xcite . for a @xmath6 magnetization of @xmath67 in the two @xmath65 states , an ion temperature of @xmath72 k and @xmath73 k would be required , which would correspond to a radio - frequency heating of @xmath74 k and @xmath75 k , respectively . as will be shown below ,",
    "radio - frequency heating at the conditions of our experiment is @xmath76 k for mn@xmath0 , which rules out both states .",
    "the remaining @xmath66 states with fully parallel alignment of the @xmath6 states but antiparallel @xmath77 or parallel @xmath78 alignment of the @xmath5 spin would correspond to ion temperatures of @xmath79 k and @xmath80 k , respectively , and can not be distinguished by consideration of the very similar radio frequency heating of @xmath81 k and @xmath82 k. however , the @xmath83 state with antiparallel coupling of the @xmath5 derived electron spin should be about 1 ev higher in energy than the @xmath84 state because of the strong intra - atomic @xmath58 exchange coupling in manganese that leads to parallel spin coupling and favors the @xmath53s term over the @xmath85s term in the ground state of free mn@xmath32 ions @xcite by 1.17 ev .",
    "this argument is very similar to the case of the maximum spin ground state @xcite of cr@xmath0 .",
    "parallel @xmath86 spin alignment is also indicated at the onset of the @xmath38 line of the experimental xmcd spectrum as shown in detail as an inset to fig .",
    "[ fig : xspectra ] . here",
    "the experimental spectra of mn@xmath0 and mn@xmath1 are compared to calculated spectra for @xmath34s and @xmath35s terms , i.e. , for parallel and antiparallel alignment of the @xmath5 derived spin . as can be seen ,",
    "the calculated xmcd spectra differ significantly in the intensity of the overshoot at 639.25 ev , and by the sign of the signal at 638.5 ev .",
    "the strong overshoot at 639.5 ev and the dip at 638.75 ev in the experiment agree better with the calculated spectrum for parallel than for antiparallel alignment .",
    "in addition to the energy consideration above , this is an experimental indication of parallel alignment of the @xmath5 derived spin and leaves only @xmath84 for the spin in the ground state of mn@xmath0 .",
    "a similar signature of parallel @xmath86 spin coupling has also been observed in the case of cr@xmath0 where it appears not only in xmcd but also in the x - ray absorption spectrum as a well separated line at photon energies below the @xmath38 main line @xcite .",
    "this prepeak at the onset of @xmath2 excitation of the free molecular ion is a sensitive measure of parallel @xmath58 spin alignment that vanishes upon cluster deposition @xcite . in conclusion ,",
    "our results from xmcd spectroscopy provide the first direct experimental evidence for the @xmath87 ground state of free @xmath88 ions , in agreement with electron spin resonance spectroscopy of @xmath88 isolated in inert gas matrices  @xcite and in agreement with indirect evidence from photodissociation spectroscopy of free @xmath88 ions  @xcite .",
    "the analysis of the spin and orbital angular momentum in the ground state of mn@xmath1 follows the same reasoning as for mn@xmath0 above . in mn@xmath1 ,",
    "the localized @xmath7 configurations of the @xmath6 subshells can couple with the @xmath5 derived spin to a total spin @xmath54 of @xmath89 as given by the 2 mn ( @xmath52s ) + mn@xmath32 ( @xmath53s ) lowest energy dissociation limit .",
    "we will again assume for simplicity that the localized @xmath7 states in mn@xmath1 first couple to a total @xmath6 spin @xmath56 and then with the single unpaired @xmath5 derived spin to give a total spin @xmath54 .",
    "again , the orbital angular momentum sum rule of xmcd @xcite returns a molecular orbital magnetic moment of @xmath90 @xmath3 for mn@xmath1 , i.e. , no orbit contribution to the total angular momentum @xmath61 in agreement with half - filled @xmath44 subshells localized at each of the three manganese cores . as for mn@xmath0",
    ", the total magnetization of the @xmath6 spins in mn@xmath1 is determined from a fit of the calculated mn@xmath32 xmcd signal to the experimental xmcd spectrum as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : xspectra ] .",
    "this procedure gives @xmath91 as the total @xmath6 magnetization and excludes all states with @xmath92 .",
    "out of the remaining states , those with @xmath93 and @xmath94 can be ruled out because these would reach a @xmath6 magnetization of @xmath95 at @xmath68 t only at ion temperatures of @xmath69 k and @xmath81 k , respectively , according to the brillouin function .",
    "these ion temperatures are incompatible with an ion trap temperature of @xmath96 k and radio - frequency heating that is inevitably present in the experiment .",
    "this result indicates fully parallel spin coupling of the localized @xmath44 subshells to the maximum possible value of @xmath97 in mn@xmath1 . in principle , two states with a total spin of @xmath98 and @xmath99 could be formed by antiparallel or parallel coupling of the @xmath5 derived spin with the @xmath6 spin @xmath56 .",
    "analogous to the case of mn@xmath0 , antiparallel coupling can be ruled out from energy considerations and from the experimental xmcd spectrum , shown in detail as an inset to fig .",
    "[ fig : xspectra ] .",
    "again , the state with antiparallel coupling of the @xmath5 derived spin to @xmath56 should be @xmath100 ev higher in energy @xcite because of the strong intra - atomic @xmath58 exchange interaction that the @xmath5 derived electron experiences with the localized @xmath6 electrons .",
    "furthermore , the calculated spectrum for the @xmath34s ground state of mn@xmath32 with parallel coupling fits the details of the experimental spectrum at the onset of @xmath2 excitation better than the @xmath35s excited state with antiparallel @xmath101 coupling .",
    "the case is is even clearer than for mn@xmath0 because of the better signal - to - noise ratio . in summary",
    ", the total magnetic moment of mn@xmath1 is equal to @xmath102 and is purely determined by the electron spin of the molecule .",
    "this is in agreement with results from photodissociation spectroscopy @xcite of mn@xmath1 .",
    "a total @xmath6 magnetization of @xmath95 at @xmath68 t for the @xmath103 state of mn@xmath1 corresponds to an ion temperature of @xmath79 k and thus to a radio - frequency heating of @xmath104 k at our experimental conditions . since radio - frequency heating is more pronounced for mn@xmath0 than for mn@xmath1 because of the lighter mass at otherwise identical conditions , this result serves as an _ ex post _ justification of the anticipated strong radio frequency heating of mn@xmath0 that was made above .",
    "our experimental results show that mn@xmath0 and mn@xmath1 , similar to cr@xmath0 ( ref . ) , possess electronic ground states with maximum @xmath6 spin magnetic moments of 5 @xmath3 per atom and fully occupied @xmath5 and @xmath6 majority spin states .",
    "this confirms previous experimental results @xcite on free and matrix - isolated mn@xmath0 and mn@xmath1 but contradicts the theoretical predictions of a @xmath18 ground state @xcite for mn@xmath1 and a @xmath17 ground state @xcite for mn@xmath0 . the mechanism that mediates parallel spin alignment of the @xmath7 high spin configurations located at the individual nuclei in mn@xmath0 and mn@xmath1 is indirect ( double ) exchange coupling @xcite via the spin of a single unpaired",
    "@xmath5 derived electron .",
    "this is identical in both molecular ions .",
    "the reason for this indirect exchange coupling is the strong intra - atomic @xmath58 exchange interaction in manganese that leads to an energy difference of 1.17 ev between the @xmath105s ground state of mn@xmath32 with parallel alignment of the unpaired @xmath6 and @xmath5 spins , and the @xmath85s first excited state where the alignment is antiparallel @xcite .",
    "this intra - atomic exchange interaction favors a ferromagnetic coupling of the localized @xmath6 shells in mn@xmath0 and mn@xmath1 because the unpaired @xmath5 derived electron can only delocalize over the entire molecular ion with its spin aligned parallel to the @xmath6 spins at the atomic sites .",
    "this is analogous to spin coupling @xcite in the ground state of cr@xmath0 .",
    "indirect exchange coupling @xcite was first proposed for mn@xmath0 by @xcite who discussed how competing effects of intra - atomic @xmath58 and interatomic @xmath106 exchange coupling in mn@xmath42 would result in parallel coupling of the spins of the unpaired @xmath107 electron and both localized @xmath6 subshells in the ground state . a similar approach by @xcite regards mn@xmath0 as a mixed valence system and leads to identical results .",
    "one important requirement for indirect or double exchange @xcite is atomic - like spin correlation in the open @xmath6 shell , which is not shown easily in general . here ,",
    "our experimental results demonstrate that this atomic - like spin correlation is clearly valid for mn@xmath0 and mn@xmath1 as for the case of cr@xmath0 from the atomic - like x - ray absorption and xmcd spectra @xcite that are very sensitive to spin correlations in the initial and final states .",
    "finally , it is known that the xmcd spin sum rule @xcite can not be applied without empiric correction to manganese @xcite because @xmath38 and @xmath39 edges are not strictly separable as required .",
    "this leads to an underestimation of the spin magnetization .",
    "a comparison of the magnetization of mn@xmath0 and mn@xmath1 as obtained above to the result that would be given by application of the xmcd spin sum rule to the experimental spectra yields experimental correction factors to the spin sum rule of @xmath108 for mn@xmath0 and @xmath109 for mn@xmath1 .",
    "these values agree well with results of 1.5 and 1.47 that are obtained by hartree - fock or charge - transfer multiplet calculations @xcite .",
    "in conclusion , x - ray absorption and x - ray magnetic circular dichroism spectroscopy of free mn@xmath0 and mn@xmath1 give direct experimental evidence of molecular high spin states .",
    "for both molecular ions we find a maximum @xmath6 spin ground state with atomically localized @xmath6 electrons and fully parallel alignment of all @xmath6 electron spins , which leads to the largest possible magnetic spin moments of 11 @xmath3 and 16 @xmath3 , respectively .",
    "we do not see any evidence for noncollinear or canted spin arrangements in mn@xmath0 and mn@xmath1 .",
    "we find that the same mechanism is responsible for the electronic structure and chemical bonding in mn@xmath0 and mn@xmath1 .",
    "these molecular ions are characterized by localized @xmath7 high - spin configurations of half - filled @xmath6 subshells , and a single delocalized @xmath5 derived electron that mediates a strong and ferromagnetic indirect exchange coupling , analogous to the case of cr@xmath0 . from the observed localized atomic magnetic moment and @xmath44",
    "configuration we deduce an experimental lower limit on the interatomic distances of @xmath110  in agreement with theoretical predictions for the high spin states .",
    "there is no orbital contribution to the total angular momentum and thus no coupling of the spin to the molecular axis or frame to first order .",

    "<S> the electronic structure and magnetic moments of free mn@xmath0 and mn@xmath1 are characterized by @xmath2 x - ray absorption and x - ray magnetic circular dichroism spectroscopy in a cryogenic ion trap that is coupled to a synchrotron radiation beamline . </S>",
    "<S> our results show directly that localized magnetic moments of 5 @xmath3 are created by @xmath4 states at each ionic core , which are coupled in parallel to form molecular high - spin states via indirect exchange that is mediated in both cases by a delocalized valence electron in a singly - occupied @xmath5 derived orbital with an unpaired spin . </S>",
    "<S> this leads to total magnetic moments of 11 @xmath3 for mn@xmath0 and 16 @xmath3 for mn@xmath1 , with no contribution of orbital angular momentum . </S>"
