    "nuclear spin polarization and dynamics @xcite in semiconductor nanostructures such as quantum wells and quantum dots have attracted increasing attention in recent years . for example , electrical transport experiments have demonstrated dynamical nuclear spin polarization near tunnel junctions , quantum point contacts , and coupled quantum dots.@xcite optical pumping nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) technique has been used to explore the local electronic state in 2d electron gas in the quantum hall regime by measuring the knight shift and the relaxation time @xmath0.@xcite nuclear spin diffusion has been found to play an important role in the heat capacity anomaly@xcite at filling factor @xmath1 , which may have originated from a skyrme solid - liquid phase transition .",
    "time - resolved optical measurements in magnetic and non - magnetic semiconductor heterostructures also clearly demonstrate strong influences of nuclear spins on the confined electron spin dynamics.@xcite    both nuclear@xcite and electron spin@xcite in semiconductors have been proposed as the potential quantum bit for quantum computing architectures , and nuclear spins also are suggested as quantum memory.@xcite at low temperatures , the hyperfine interaction between electron and nuclear spins could be the dominant decoherence mechanism for both types of spins.@xcite because of the confined nature of electrons in such devices , the hyperfine coupling acquires a strongly local characteristics . to achieve detailed understanding of electron and nuclear spin coherence ,",
    "a careful study of nuclear spin dynamics in these semiconductor heterostructures is imperative .",
    "one of the nuclear spin relaxation channels is spin diffusion , which reduces local nuclear polarization through direct or mediated spin - spin interaction .",
    "nuclear spin diffusion ( nsd ) was first introduced by bloembergen to explain the measurements of spin - lattice relaxation time @xmath0 in ionic crystals in the presence of paramagnetic impurities.@xcite he suggested that nsd could be induced by the mutual nuclear spin flip - flops through magnetic dipole - dipole interaction among nuclear spins . since",
    "then many calculations@xcite have been made for the nsd coefficients .",
    "similar results were obtained via a variety of approaches , as these calculations all deal with pure dipole - dipole interactions .    in this paper",
    "we present detailed calculations of nsd coefficients in semiconductor quantum dots .",
    "although the formulation is general , we will concentrate on gaas based dots and wells which are of great experimental interests .",
    "direct measurements of the nsd coefficients has been done using optically pumped nmr for bulk gaas and algaas .",
    "it was estimated that the nsd coefficient in bulk gaas is in the order of @xmath2 for the arsenic nuclei@xcite and @xmath3 for nuclei in the algaas barrier.@xcite our objective in the present study is not to accurately predict the numerical values of the nsd coefficients in the nanostructures .",
    "instead , we would like to assess how they are modified compared to the bulk materials . specifically ,",
    "our present focus is on how the hyperfine interactions affect the diffusion coefficients , since the confined electrons in these materials have nonuniform wavefunctions , which lead to nonuniform coupling to the nuclear spins through the fermi contact interaction .",
    "since the hyperfine interaction is much stronger than nuclear dipole - dipole interaction wherever the electron wavefunction is not negligible , we expect that nuclear spin diffusion could be strongly affected .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we introduce the moment method@xcite and the density matrix method,@xcite which we use to calculate the nuclear spin diffusion coefficients .",
    "we then discuss how to adapt these methods to the inhomogeneous situations of quantum dots .",
    "in section iii , we give numerical results from both methods and compare the two approximations .",
    "we also explore the experimental relevance of our results .",
    "finally some further discussion and conclusion are presented in section iv .",
    "in our calculation , we assume a finite static magnetic field @xmath4 along the @xmath5 direction.@xcite under this condition non - secular terms of dipolar hamiltonian can be dropped due to consideration of energy conservation , so that the direct magnetic dipolar hamiltonian can be written as@xcite @xmath6 here @xmath7 is the gyromagnetic ratio of nuclear spin @xmath8 , @xmath9 is the distance between two nuclei located at positions @xmath10 and @xmath11 , @xmath12 is the angle between @xmath13 and @xmath5 direction , and @xmath14 stands for the summation over all the spin pairs except @xmath15 .",
    "we will only consider the dipolar coupling among the same nuclear species .",
    "effects of different spin species will be briefly discussed in section iv .",
    "the moment method was designed to study linear response of the spin system@xcite , such as the susceptibility of the nuclear spin system , by applying a small space- and time - dependent magnetic field : @xmath16 so that the response of the spin system can be evaluated . to study spin diffusion ,",
    "the perturbing field is along the same direction as the static magnetic field .",
    "the perturbing hamiltonian then takes the form @xmath17 the @xmath18th moment is defined as@xcite @xmath19 where @xmath20 and @xmath21 are the eigenstates of the unperturbed nuclear spin hamiltonian and @xmath22 and @xmath23 are the associated eigenvalues .",
    "the moments contain information on the shape of the resonance absorption curve for the whole ensemble of nuclear spins .",
    "a common practice is to assume a particular line shape with some unknown parameters , then calculate the first few moments to determine these parameters.@xcite in general , the calculation of @xmath24 is rather complicated . however , knowing the first two moments is usually enough to determine the line shape approximately . in the present situation , after substituting eq .",

    "the spin diffusion coefficient @xmath35 is now @xmath40 since both @xmath36 and @xmath37 are proportional to @xmath41 , the diffusion coefficients in expressions ( [ eq : diff - g ] ) and ( [ eq : diff - l ] ) are independent of @xmath42 .",
    "notice that the two approximations of line shape lead to almost the same numerical results for nuclear spin diffusion coefficients , thus we adopt the gaussian line shape ( eq .  [ eq : diff - g ] ) throughout this study .    in the present study",

    "furthermore , the electrons in a quantum dot has discrete energy spectrum .",
    "there is no small change of electron kinetic energy that could facilitate spin - dependent scattering .",

    "( [ eq : m2 ] ) and ( [ eq : m4 ] ) is trivial because it means calculating the average over the whole homogeneous sample . for the inhomogeneous system considered in the current study ,",
    "we approximate the sum over @xmath53 with the method of coarse graining where the sum is evaluated over a few neighboring lattice points .",

    "we now include electron - nuclear spin hyperfine interaction in our calculation of the nsd coefficients . to study the effects of hyperfine interaction , we need knowledge of the electronic wavefunctions .",

    ". the suppression of spin diffusion due to hyperfine interaction at or near the center of the quantum dot could be so significant that @xmath112 and @xmath113 is only a few percent of @xmath123 and @xmath124 .",
    "figures  [ fig1 ] and [ fig2 ] also show that with both methods the suppression of spin diffusion decreases as the dot size becomes larger , which can be explained by noting that hyperfine interaction strength decreases for larger dots . to further illustrate this point , in fig .",

    ". similar results ( which are not shown in fig .",

    "an additional feature of fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] is that , at the boundary of the dot along @xmath5 direction , the nsd coefficients increase to @xmath125 rapidly .",
    "this behavior is due to our assumption that the electron wavefunction outside the dot is zero .",
    "it is also noticed that @xmath112 has a stronger suppression than @xmath113 , which is illustrated in both fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] and fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] using both calculation methods .",
    "there are several interesting differing features in the results of the two methods in addition to the different magnitudes of the diffusion coefficients given by the two methods as we have discussed previously for homogeneous systems .",
    "firstly , moment method typically leads to stronger suppressions at the center of the dot .",
    "secondly , fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , particularly panel ( b ) , indicates that the suppression of nsd is not the strongest at the center of the quantum dot .",
    "instead it decreases from the center ( albeit only slightly in some cases ) , reaches its minimum at an intermediate position , then starts to rise again near the edge of the dot .",
    "this feature is stronger in the results obtained through the density matrix method than those from the moment method , and is stronger for the @xmath5-direction diffusion ( fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) than in - plane directions ( fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) .",
    "in fact the characteristic exists , although only weakly , in fig .",
    "[ fig2](b ) for @xmath113 while it is not present in fig .",
    "[ fig2](a ) .",
    "the presence of off - center local minimum in nuclear spin diffusion in a quantum dot is physical .",
    "the suppression of spin diffusion is determined by the difference of the inhomogeneous hyperfine coupling at two nuclear sites @xmath126 instead of the coupling constant alone ( see eq .",
    "( [ eq : m4-mh ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ eq : wik ] ) ) .",
    "in essence , in the flip - flop processes that account for nuclear spin diffusion , energy must be conserved . if the hyperfine coupling strengths are not the same at the two lattice sites , the effective zeeman energies of the two nuclear spins are different , so that extra energy must be absorbed or emitted ( from the overall dipolar energy reservoir , for example ) to compensate for the difference .",
    "apparently small energy differences should result in greater flip - flop rates , hence faster diffusion .",
    "this is the basic reason why spin diffusion is suppressed in an inhomogeneous system .",
    "since the energy difference is proportional to both the magnitude and the gradient of the electron wavefunction , the strongest suppression of nsd coefficient could occur either at the center of a quantum dot or its `` waist '' , where the gradient is the largest ( notice that the nuclear spins are on discrete sites , thus near the center of the quantum dot the hyperfine energy difference is generally nonvanishing , for a very small dot it could even be a maximum depending on the form of the electron wavefunction ) .",
    "for an electron confined in a quantum dot geometry , the envelope wavefunction is highly non - uniform and can be approximated with eq .",
    "(  [ eq : psi ] ) . along the @xmath5 direction",
    "the changes of this hyperfine coupling between neighboring nuclear sites are quite large .",
    "this is the reason that there is a sharp minimum of the diffusion coefficient as a function of @xmath5 at a nonzero @xmath5 . on the other hand",
    "the confinement is not that strong in the @xmath122 direction especially for larger dots , so the feature is not as obvious .    to illustrate the previous discussion in more detail we consider a small quantum dot with @xmath127 nm and @xmath128 nm .",
    "figure  [ fig4](a ) clearly shows a sharp off - center local minimum of the nsd coefficient @xmath113 , corresponding to a strong suppression of diffusion , which is weak in fig .",
    "quite interestingly a ring structure of nuclear spin polarization has been observed in ferromagnet / semiconductor heterostructures by spatially modulating the excitation intensity.@xcite the experiment uses a laser pulse with a gaussian cross section , which we believe is key to the ring structure .",
    "the inhomogeneous power input induces non - uniform carrier polarization strength at the interface which in turn leads to inhomogeneous hyperfine couplings .",
    "as we have discussed , the suppression of diffusion would be the strongest at some position between the center and the boundary . in fig .",
    "[ fig4](b ) , we show the suppressions of nsd coefficient @xmath113 for two different polarization magnitudes in the micrometer size . the results are quite similar to the strongly confined quantum dots . at low temperatures an important spin relaxation mechanism is spin diffusion .",
    "the existence of the local minimum of diffusion coefficients contributes to a maximum of nuclear spin polarization since the diffusion is slowest at the point . in other words",
    "a ring structure could very well be present , as what was observed experimentally .",
    "in the present study we have investigated the dipole - dipole interaction among like nuclear species ( eq .",
    "( [ eq : h - nuclear ] ) ) .",
    "interaction between unlike nuclear spins have been neglected . under the assumption that the magnetic field is not weak",
    ", this should be a good approximation .",
    "however there is the so - called indirect interaction ( rkky)@xcite in highly disordered samples where spin - flip scattering has measurable physical effects . in this regard , the coupling between different nuclear species may have non - negligible effects .",
    "it should be mentioned that @xmath36 and @xmath37 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : m2-qd ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ eq : m4-qd ] ) do not change without direct spin interaction .",
    "however , the evaluation of @xmath37 becomes extremely complicated if the indirect coupling between unlike spin species is included .",
    "we did not study this aspect of spin diffusion in the current paper .",
    "we have calculated nsd coefficients for arsenic nuclei in this paper .",
    "gaas has a zinc blende structure with 50% @xmath96as ( which is the only stable arsenic isotope ) . in natural gaas samples , there are two isotopes of gallium , @xmath129ga ( 19.8% , @xmath130 ) and @xmath131ga ( 30.2% , @xmath132 ) . in the barrier region ,",
    "the ga concentration is even lower with the introduction of 10% to 15% of al in place of ga .",
    "an evaluation of the nsd coefficients for ga would have to account for the random distribution of different ga isotopes on the fcc lattice . here",
    "our emphasis is the effect of inhomogeneous hyperfine interaction on nsd .",
    "furthermore , this nonuniform hyperfine coupling , in the form of eq .",
    "( [ eq : h - hfz ] ) , can not compensate for the difference in zeeman energy of different nuclear species , so that the inter - species nsd is unlikely .",
    "for example , the effective hyperfine magnetic field seen by nuclei at the center of a quantum dot is only a few tens gauss , which is usually much less than the external field . thus the inter - species nsd is basically impossible in a finite magnetic field , and we do not have to consider the ga nuclei when studying nsd of the as nuclei .",
    "recently spin diffusion suppression by nonuniform field has been found@xcite in silica samples where an inhomogeneous magnetic field was generated by a ferromagnetic tip of a magnetic resonance force microscope .",
    "it was found that spin relaxation rates @xmath133 are significantly reduced due to the suppression of nuclear spin flip - flop processes . in solids with paramagnetic impurities,@xcite inhomogeneous internal field",
    "could also be generated by dipole - dipole interaction between the impurity and its neighboring nuclear spins , in which case a barrier to nsd can also be formed .    in this study",
    "we have presented two methods to study the suppression of spin diffusion . in the moment method originally developed for homogeneous bulk material,@xcite a small spatially and temporally varying perturbation",
    "is added to the total hamiltonian to generate linear response .",
    "the spatial variation of the perturbation is assumed to be smooth compared to electron wavefunction variation ( long wavelength approximation ) . to apply it to nanostructures like quantum dots , we combine it with a coarse - graining approximation . in this method",
    "we have to assume the sizes of quantum dots being considered are relatively large . in principle",
    "the moment method is not designed for the calculation of strong spatial variation of diffusion .",
    "this partly explains the less prominent local minimum of diffusion coefficients as a function of spatial coordinates . on the other hand",
    "the density matrix method is more straightforward and keeps more local features in the evaluations . with our density matrix calculation",
    "no assumption of any particular line - shape is necessary .",
    "we simply start from the full hamiltonian , and then use the second - order perturbation to find the evolution of the local nuclear magnetization .",
    "nevertheless the strong suppressions of nsd coefficients for small dots appear in both calculations .",
    "to conclude we have presented detailed study of nuclear spin diffusion under the influence of inhomogeneous contact hyperfine interactions in gaas based nanostructures .",
