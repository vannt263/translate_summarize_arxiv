    "recently , the pamela collaboration has observed an anomalous positron abundance in cosmic radiation  @xcite .",
    "the positron over electron fraction turns over and appears to rise at energies from 10  gev to 100  gev .",
    "however , from the same detector , no obvious antiproton excess is seen for the same energy range  @xcite .",
    "many suggestions have been made to explain the positron excess at pamela . among different approaches ,",
    "dark matter annihilation is especially interesting and could imply future signals in dark matter direct detection experiments and/or at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) .    in recent model - independent studies ,",
    "dark matter particles are required both to annihilate dominantly to leptons and to have a much larger annihilation rate in the galactic halo than would be implied by a traditional thermal relic estimate  @xcite  @xcite .",
    "the lack of antiproton excess in the pamela experiment  @xcite can be explained if dark matter particles first annihilate into some intermediate particles , which are so light that their decays to hadrons are kinematically forbidden  @xcite , or couple dominantly to standard model ( sm ) leptons  @xcite . to explain the large dark matter annihilation cross section in the galactic halo while remaining consistent with a thermal dark matter relic abundance",
    ", one can introduce an attractive force between two dark matter particles and use the sommerfeld enhancement to boost the annihilation cross section in the galactic halo  @xcite .",
    "this scenario suggests interesting signatures  @xcite and can be tested at the lhc  @xcite .",
    "a second approach is to consider non - thermal relics .",
    "other long - lived particles can decay to the dark matter particles and increase the dark matter relic abundance in the galactic halo  @xcite .",
    "instead of constructing a dark matter model _ ad hoc _ to explain the cosmic ray observations , in this paper we ask whether there is an existing well - motivated model that naturally contains the necessary ingredients to explain the positron excess of pamela .",
    "the most developed framework to address the naturalness problem of the sm is the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) , which provides the lightest superpartner ( lsp ) protected by r - parity as the dark matter candidate . in general , the annihilation products in the mssm contain not only leptons but also a large fraction of hadrons .",
    "this makes it difficult for the mssm to explain the positron excess at pamela , and at the same time be consistent with the antiproton spectrum at pamela  @xcite . from the theoretic side ,",
    "the mssm suffers the @xmath5-problem , which can be solved elegantly by introducing a new gauge singlet chiral supermultiplet , as proposed in the next - to - minimal supersymmetric standard model  @xcite .",
    "a recent exploration of the nmssm parameter space shows that the lightest @xmath0-odd particle @xmath2 ( mainly from the singlet component ) can be naturally lighter than @xmath6 and mainly decay into two @xmath7 s  @xcite .",
    "one should notice that the mass of @xmath2 in the nmssm is protected by the @xmath8 symmetry and can even be lighter than @xmath9  gev if the soft terms associated with the singlet are small .",
    "in this case the @xmath2 will decay mainly into two muons for a mass of a few hundred mev .",
    "therefore , if the dark matter candidate in the nmssm can annihilate mostly into @xmath2 s , we can have a leptonic final state in the annihilation products simply from kinematics .",
    "the nmssm provides the necessary ingredients to make this happen . notice that the dark matter candidate in the nmssm is the lsp neutralino ( for existing studies for light neutralino dark matter in the nmssm , see  @xcite ) .",
    "if its mass happens to be around half that of the heavier @xmath0-odd scalar @xmath4 mass , a large dark matter annihilation cross section is obtained through the @xmath3-channel resonance effects with @xmath4 . to have leptons dominant in the final state",
    ", we should have a large branching ratio of @xmath4 to @xmath2 plus @xmath1 .",
    "this will naturally happen , provided that the dark matter lsp mass is less than the top quark mass , and thus that the decay of @xmath4 to @xmath10 is kinematically forbidden . since the @xmath0-odd scalar coupling to other fermions is proportional to their yukawa couplings , the final state can dominantly be @xmath11 with the former decaying to leptons .",
    "the kinematics helps us to obtain hard leptons in the final state of the dark matter annihilations .    in section  [ sec :",
    "model ] , we develop the notation by deriving the spectrum and interactions in the nmssm , and show two sets of representative model points allowed by current experimental constraints .",

    "our analysis shows that the most stringent constraints are from exclusive @xmath237 decays at babar and light pseudoscalar searches at d0 .",
    "compared to the mssm , the constraints from lep and other searches are less severe , due to non - standard decays of the mssm - like higgs boson and a new suppression factor @xmath238 beyond the mssm .      the heavier bosons in the nmssm , typically above 250  gev , were unaccessible at lep .",
    "therefore , we only consider the two lightest scalar particles @xmath2 and @xmath1 at lep .",
    "there are three main production mechanisms for those two neutral higgs bosons .",
    "one is through the higgsstrahlung process @xmath239 ; another one is the pair production process @xmath240 ; the third one is through the radiation off a massive fermion : @xmath241 .    for the higgsstrahlung process @xmath239 and for an @xmath1 mass within the lep reach ,",
    "the @xmath1 mainly decays to @xmath176 and @xmath242 for the @xmath5-favored and @xmath7-favored cases , respectively . for the @xmath7-favored model point",
    ", there are many different final states like @xmath243 , @xmath244 and so on .",
    "although the lep bounds on each of those channels are weak , the decay mode independent limits impose a bound on the mass of @xmath1 as @xmath245  gev  @xcite , which is satisfied in the model points we have considered in this paper . for the @xmath5-favored case ,",
    "the lower bound on the @xmath1 mass is around 114  gev , which is also satisfied for the model point reported in table  [ tab : case1para ] .",
    "the cross section of the pair production process @xmath240 is proportional to @xmath246 from eq .",

    "the cross section is calculated to be @xmath250  fb for the model parameters in table  [ tab : case1para ] .",
    "considering the integrated luminosity of lep is below 1  fb@xmath167 , there are no constraints on the model parameters from this channel .    finally , for the associated production with bottom quarks , the cross section is also suppressed due to a moderate @xmath73 and three - body final state phase space .",
    "the cross section for @xmath241 at @xmath249  gev is calculated to be @xmath251  fb for the model parameters in table  [ tab : case1para ] , which also indicates no constraints from lep .",
    "the lightest @xmath0-even higgs boson @xmath1 has approximately the same couplings to fermions as in the standard model .",
    "the ongoing searches at cdf and d0 do not yet constrain an @xmath1 with a mass around 115  gev at the tevatron  @xcite .    for the lightest @xmath0-odd higgs boson @xmath2",
    ", the main production process at the tevatron is through associated production with @xmath176 and has a cross section proportional to @xmath252 , where @xmath199 has the same coupling to @xmath176 as the sm higgs boson .",
    "although the production cross section can be large for the model parameters that we consider , the existing searches at d0 for the @xmath2 decays to two taus only constrain an @xmath2 with a mass above 90  gev  @xcite .    however , the recent searches for @xmath2 in the channel @xmath253 at d0 can impose a stringent bound on the muon - favored model parameter space in the nmssm .",
    "the sm background for two pairs of collinear muons is very small ( below 0.02 events for @xmath254  fb@xmath167 integrated luminosity ) , and the null result imposes a constraint @xmath255  fb  @xcite .",
    "this bound is roughly independent of the @xmath2 mass .",
    "the production cross section for a sm higgs at the tevatron is around 0.8  pb , so we need to have @xmath256 for @xmath257 . therefore , the muon - favored model point in table  [ tab : case1para ] is allowed by this constraint , although it selects a specific region of the nmssm parameter space .",
    "this experimental result points to small values of @xmath17 and @xmath19 to decrease the @xmath1 branching ratio into @xmath258 .",
    "however , small values of @xmath17 and @xmath19 also increase the branching ratio of @xmath4 into @xmath176 .",
    "since the dominant annihilation is mediated by the resonance effect with @xmath4 , this leads to a non - neglegible hadronic final state from the dark matter annihilation .",
    "there is a new radiative contribution to the magnetic moment of the muon by exchanging @xmath2 in the loop diagram . using the one - loop result from ref .",
    "@xcite , the new physics correction to @xmath259 is a_&=&()^2 + & & ^1_0 , and is negative .",
    "the two - loop calculation will not change the sign of @xmath260 for a mass of @xmath2 below 1  gev  @xcite .",
    "the measured value of @xmath259 has a 3.4 @xmath261 deviation ( @xmath262 data only ) above the prediction of the standard model  @xcite . requiring the new physics to be less than the experimental error",
    ", we arrive at the following constraints on the model parameters : 2.5(bnl ( g-2)_/2 ) . here",
    "@xmath77 is chosen to be 800  mev , while the constraints are less stringent as one increases @xmath77 .",
    "notice that the @xmath260 may also receive significant contributions from other particles like smuons , that we chose to be heavy here to isolate the dark matter discussions .",
    "another stringent bound on the nmssm parameter space with a light @xmath2 below 10 gev is from upsilon decays into a photon plus @xmath2 , which decays into a pair of taus or muons .    for the mass range",
    "@xmath263  gev , the strongest bound is from the recent cleo - iii limits  @xcite on @xmath264 .",
    "the radiative decay to @xmath265 is calculated as  @xcite & = & ( ) ^2 + & & ( 1-)f , where @xmath266 incorporates qcd and relativistic corrections  @xcite  @xcite .",
    "the data from cleo have the limit @xmath267 at 90% c.l . for a wide range of @xmath77 between @xmath268  gev to @xmath269  gev . using @xmath270 and @xmath271 from the model prediction",
    ", this limit is translated into a bound on @xmath272 as 0.9 .",
    "a similar result is obtained in  @xcite . for the mass range @xmath273  gev ,",
    "the strongest current bound is coming from the light scalar searches in the channel @xmath274 at babar . at 90% c.l .",
    ", babar imposes an upper limit @xmath275",
    "@xcite for @xmath77 below 1  gev . using @xmath276 and @xmath277 from the model prediction",
    ", this limit is translated into a bound on @xmath272 as 0.4 .",
    "[ eq : babar ]    for the range of @xmath278 , the decay mode @xmath279 is open",
    ". the branching ratio of this decay channel is given by  @xcite & & b(k^+^+a_1)=(-^-1)^2 + & & ^2_a + & = & 310 ^ -6(-^-1)^2 ^ 2_a , which should be compared to the experimental values from the hypercp collaboration  @xcite : @xmath280 .",
    "therefore , the following constraint on the model parameter space is derived |-^-1|0.06 , so , other than when @xmath73 is very close to 1 or @xmath238 is extremely close to zero , the mass of @xmath2 is constrained to be above @xmath281  mev .",
    "finally , there are also other constraints from b - physics like @xmath282 or @xmath283 . since the @xmath2 pseudoscalar does not mediate tree - level flavor - changing processes , one can use the minimal flavor violation assumption to suppress many kinds of flavor changing processes .",
    "we have used the nmhdecay program to check those constraints and to justify the validity of our model points . in short , the most stringent constraint for @xmath284  gev is the radiative decays of upsilon into photons from babar .",
    "the bound is @xmath285 .",
    "one can see that the model point in table  [ tab : case1para ] satisfies this bound .",
    "the dark matter candidate neutralino in the nmssm from table  [ tab : case1para ] is a combination of the bino , wino and higgsino .",
    "therefore , it has a good chance to be detected in dark matter direct detection experiments , especially from the spin - dependent elastic scattering with nucleons .",
    "here we just report the values calculated using the micromegas program  @xcite .",
    "the spin - independent dm - proton and dm - neutron cross sections are @xmath286  cm@xmath141 and @xmath287  cm@xmath141 , which are two orders of magnitude below the current bounds from xenon10  @xcite . for the spin - dependent one ,",
    "the dm - proton and dm - neutron cross sections are @xmath288  cm@xmath141 and @xmath289  cm@xmath141 .",
    "the later one is only one order of magnitude below the current bound  @xcite and is in the accessible region of the upgraded experiments .",
    "the nmssm explanation of the pamela positron excess can be tested by future experiments at colliders and new results from cosmic ray experiments . on the collider side , it is important to measure the masses of the neutralino and the heavier @xmath0-odd particle . if their masses satisfy the relation @xmath290 , the large dark matter annihilation cross section can be confirmed . another important quantity",
    "to measure is the mass of the lighter @xmath0-odd particle , because the pamela positron excess prefers to have its mass below 1  gev .",
    "it is also crucial to know the branching ratio of @xmath4 to @xmath176 , since the dominant antiproton contributions are from this channel .    on the cosmic ray side",
    ", we make a well - motivated unambiguous prediction that pamela will observe a turnover of the rising positron spectrum at around 70 gev .",
    "the additional contributions to the electron+positron spectrum from dark matter annihilations are within current uncertainties but could be resolved in the future by fermi lat .",
    "the associated gamma - ray flux from dark matter annihilation could also be resolved by fermi lat , but again due to astrophysical uncertainties one should be cautious when making a concrete prediction .    in this paper",
    "we have explored the possibility of using neutralino annihilations in the nmssm to explain the positron excess observed at pamela .",
    "kinematics plays an essential role for having a viable model with a large fraction of leptons and a small fraction of hadrons in the annihilation final state .",
    "the lighter @xmath0-odd particle @xmath2 has a mass below 1  gev and mainly decays into two muons .",
    "the dark matter neutralino mass is less than the top quark mass to forbid the otherwise dominant @xmath10 final state . the @xmath3-channel resonance effect with the heavier @xmath0-odd particle @xmath4 increases the dark matter annihilation cross section to match the necessary one for the pamela positron fraction spectrum .",
    "this also requires that the neutralino mass is less than the top quark mass , to avoid smearing the resonance effect from a large @xmath10 contribution to the @xmath4 width .",
    "we have also shown that there is discrepancy between the nmssm predictions and the preliminary gamma ray fluxes from fermi lat . to alleviate this descrepancy",
    ", one could evoke the existence of an astrophysical boost factor from a nearby clump of dark matter .",
    "such boost factor would also improve the agreement between the nmssm prediction for the antiproton spectrum and the pamela results .",
    "in particular , given the fact that positrons / electrons are only coming from nearby sources , a clump of dark matter can affect positron / electron , antiproton / proton and gamma ray fluxes differently , and would relatively increase the positron ratio spectrum more than the antiproton ratio spectrum and the gamma ray flux spectrum .",
    "we have not utilized this astrophysical boost factor in our analysis .",
    "an nmssm explanation of pamela makes three striking and uniquely correlated predictions : the rise in the pamela positron spectrum will turn over at around 70  gev , the dark matter particle mass is less than the top quark mass , and a light sub - gev pseudoscalar will be discovered at colliders .",
