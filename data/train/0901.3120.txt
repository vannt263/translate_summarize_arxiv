    "a very general question in the theory of complex manifolds is the following : let @xmath0 be a compact , differentiable manifold and let @xmath1 be the space of all complex structures on @xmath0 .",
    "what can we say about @xmath2 and its connected components ?",
    "if @xmath2 is non - empty consider a compact , complex manifold @xmath3 . the theory developed by kodaira and spencer in the 50 s @xcite and culminating in the theorem of kuranishi",
    "@xcite succeeds in giving a rather precise description of a slice of @xmath2 containing @xmath4 which is transversal to the orbit of the natural action of @xmath5 , called the kuranishi slice .      from another point of view",
    "we say that two compact , complex manifolds @xmath6 and @xmath7 are directly deformation equivalent @xmath8 if there exists an irreducible , flat family @xmath9 of compact , complex manifolds over a complex analytic space @xmath10 such that @xmath11 and @xmath12 for some points @xmath13 .",
    "the manifold @xmath6 is said to be a deformation in the large of @xmath7 if both are in the same equivalence class with respect to the equivalence relation generated by @xmath14 , which is the case if and only if both are in the same connected component of @xmath2 .    even the seemingly natural fact that any deformation in the large of a complex torus is again a complex torus has been fully proved only in 2002 by catanese @xcite .",
    "in @xcite he studies more in general deformations in the large of principal holomorphic torus bundles , especially bundles of elliptic curves .",
    "this was the starting point for our research .",
    "it turns out ( see @xcite ) that the right context to generalise catanese s results is the theory of left - invariant complex structures on nilmanifolds , i.e. , compact quotients of nilpotent real lie - groups by discrete subgroups .",
    "nilmanifolds with left - invariant complex structure provide an important source for examples in complex differential geometry . among these are the so - called kodaira - thurston manifolds , historically the first examples known to admit both a complex structure and a symplectic structure but no khler structure .",
    "in fact , a nilmanifold @xmath0 admits a khler structure if and only if it is a complex torus @xcite and the author showed @xcite that nilmanifolds can be arbitrarily far from khler manifolds in the sense that the frlicher spectral sequence may be arbitrarily non - degenerate .",
    "but unfortunately , even if every ( iterated ) principal holomorphic torus bundle can be regarded as a nilmanifold , the converse is far from true .",
    "moreover it turns out that even a small deformation of a principal holomorphic torus bundle may not admit such a structure ( see example [ badex ] ) .",
    "small deformations of nilmanifolds were already studied for so - called abelian complex structures in @xcite and for general left - invariant complex structure on nilmanifolds in @xcite .",
    "thus we are concerned with these two problems :    * give conditions under which a left - invariant complex structure on a nilmanifold gives rise to a structure of iterated ( principal ) holomorphic torus bundle.a * study deformations in the large of iterated ( principal ) holomorphic torus bundles .",
    "there is already a vast literature concerning nilpotent lie - algebras and left - invariant complex structures on nilmanifolds ( see e.g. the articles of console , cordero , fernandez , fino , grantcharov , gray , mclaughlin , pedersen , poon , salamon , ugarte , et al . cited in the bibliography )",
    "and we recapitulate the basic results in section [ lics ] , emphasising the complex geometric structure . in section [ smalldefo ]",
    "we will also recall the results on dolbeault - cohomology and small deformations .",
    "a nilmanifold @xmath0 can be characterised by a triple @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the nilpotent lie - algebra associated to a simply connected nilpotent lie - group @xmath17 , @xmath4 is an integrable complex structure on @xmath16 and @xmath18 is a ( cocompact ) lattice .",
    "the datum of either @xmath16 or @xmath19 ( considered as an abstract group ) determines @xmath17 up to unique isomorphism .",
    "the general philosophy is that the geometry of the compact , complex manifold @xmath20 should be completely determined by the linear algebra of @xmath16 , @xmath4 and the @xmath21-subalgebra generated by @xmath22 . by abuse of notation we will sometimes write @xmath23 .    the real geometry of nilmanifolds is well understood but only the existence of what we call a stable torus bundle series in the lie - algebra @xmath16 ( definition [ stableseries ] ) gives us sufficient control over the complex geometry of @xmath24 . geometrically",
    "this notion means the following :    on any real nilpotent lie - group @xmath17 there is a filtration by normal subgroups , e.g. , the ascending central series , @xmath25 such that @xmath26 is abelian and @xmath27 is a lattice in @xmath28 for any lattice @xmath18 .    in other words ,",
    "any compact nilmanifold @xmath29 can be represented as a tower of differentiable torus bundles @xmath30 @xmath31 & m_1=m \\ar[d]^{\\pi_1}\\\\ t_2 \\ar@{^(->}[r ] & m_2\\ar[d]^{\\pi_2}\\\\ & \\vdots\\ar[d]\\\\ t_{s-1}\\ar@{^(->}[r ] & m_{s-1}\\ar[d]^{\\pi_{s-1}}\\\\ & m_s = t_s}\\ ] ] where the compact torus @xmath32 is the quotient of @xmath26 by the lattice and @xmath33 is the compact nilmanifold obtained from the lie - group @xmath34 by taking the quotient with respect to the image of @xmath19 .",
    "this phenomenon is not as uncommon as it may seem at first sight ; for example every principal holomorphic torus bundle over an elliptic curve which is not a product has this property ( example [ torusovercurvedescription ] ) .",
    "section [ structureclass ] will be devoted to giving a fairly complete picture of the occurring cases if @xmath37\\leq 3 $ ] .",
    "a large part of the classification of complex structures on real 6-dimension nilpotent lie - algebras @xcite can be recovered from our more general results .",
    "it turns out that finding a stable torus bundle series ( stbs ) for some nilmanifold @xmath38 is a good step on the way to prove that every deformation in the large of @xmath38 is again such a nilmanifold .",
    "indeed , in this case the holomorphic fibration over a torus @xmath39 can be realised as a ( topologically ) fixed quotient of the albanese variety and this will enable us in section [ albanesequotients ] to determine all deformations in the large if the fibres of @xmath40 have sufficiently nice properties :      1 .",
    "@xmath16 admits a stable torus bundle series @xmath41 ( cf .",
    "definition [ stableseries ] ) .",
    "nilmanifolds with lie algebra @xmath42 and fundamental group @xmath43 constitute a good fibre class ( cf .",
    "definition [ goodfibreclass ] ) .",
    "in section [ applications ] we apply our results on the deformation of complex structures to the classification obtained in section [ structureclass ] and thus give several series of examples ( in arbitrary dimension ) for which left - invariant complex structures yield a union of connected components of the space of complex structures @xmath2 .",
    "this holds for example if @xmath37 \\leq 1 $ ] or if @xmath16 is 3-step nilpotent and @xmath37=2 $ ] .",
    "we refer to theorem [ apptheosmall ] and theorem [ apptheo ] for a complete list of cases .    there are only finitely many real 6-dimensional , nilpotent lie - algebras that admit a complex structure @xcite and we obtain a quite complete picture of their geometry and deformations in section [ dim3 ] :      1 .",
    "if @xmath16 is not in @xmath46 , then @xmath16 admits a sptbs and hence @xmath38 has the structure of an iterated principal holomorphic torus bundle .",
    "we list the possibilities in the following table : + [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      the lie - algebras @xmath48 and @xmath49 do not admit any nilpotent complex structure ( see @xcite or note that the centre has real dimension 1 ) and therefore a corresponding nilmanifold can never admit an iterated principal holomorphic torus bundle structure . thus it remains to exhibit a stbs in both cases .",
    "the case @xmath49 : :    we claim that    @xmath50    is a stable torus bundle series .",
    "since the commutator is always a    rational subspace with respect to every rational structure , we only    need prove that for every complex structure @xmath4 on    @xmath49 the subspace    @xmath51 is @xmath4-invariant .",
    "+    let @xmath52 ,    @xmath53 and , as    in lemma [ keylem ] , @xmath54 . by lemma [ dim6nn ]",
    "we know that @xmath55 and , applying    @xmath56 to @xmath57 and @xmath58 , we    see that @xmath59 . as    @xmath60 ,    @xmath61 and their    intersection is @xmath62 so    @xmath63 is    @xmath4-invariant .",
    "the case @xmath48 : :    we claim that    @xmath64    is a stable torus bundle series . with the same proof as in the first    case ( replacing @xmath65 by @xmath66 ) we see that    @xmath67 is @xmath4-invariant for every complex    structure in @xmath48 .",
    "+    it is straightforward to check that    @xmath68 which    implies that @xmath67 is rational with respect to every    rational structure .",
    "it remains to prove .",
    "a nilmanifold of type @xmath69 admits a structure of iterated principal holomorphic torus bundle if and only if the subspaces @xmath70 and @xmath71 are @xmath19-rational .",
    "this is clearly the case if the complex structure is rational but not always as seen in example [ badex ] .",
    "a quotient of @xmath72 by a 2-dimensional subspace of the centre can not be abelian , so @xmath73 and , if there is any iterated bundle structure , we have a bundle of elliptic curves over a kodaira surface .",
    "the real lie - algebra underlying the iwasawa manifold is isomorphic to @xmath74 and hence we have in particular proved that every deformation in the large of the iwasawa manifold is a nilmanifold with left - invariant complex structure",
