    "negative ions ( anions ) were first discovered in the interstellar medium ( ism ) by @xcite , who detected the linear hydrocarbon anion c@xmath0h@xmath1 in .",
    "this was followed by c@xmath0h@xmath1 and c@xmath3h@xmath1 detections in the protostellar core l1527 by @xcite and @xcite , respectively , which hinted of a role for anions in the chemistry of star - formation .",
    "@xcite performed the first dedicated survey for c@xmath0h@xmath1 in twenty - four molecular sources , but detected the anion in only two star - forming clouds , with anion - to - neutral ratios on the order of a few percent , similar to previously - observed values .",
    "interstellar anion detections were confined to the taurus molecular cloud complex until the recent discoveries of c@xmath0h@xmath1 in the lupus , cepheus and auriga star - forming regions @xcite , which proved that anions are widespread in the local ism , and not an artifact of any particular physical or chemical conditions in the taurus region .",
    "the possible importance of anions in interstellar chemistry was first discussed by @xcite , and prospects for the detection of molecular anions using radio astronomy were examined by @xcite .",
    "@xcite argued that large interstellar molecules ( including carbon - chain - bearing species ) can undergo rapid radiative electron attachment  as exemplified by the laboratory experiments of @xcite  potentially resulting in significant anion abundances in dense molecular clouds .",
    "based on this idea , models for anion chemistry have been successful in reproducing the observed abundances of c@xmath0h@xmath1 and c@xmath8h@xmath1 in tmc-1 , irc+10216 , l1527 and l1512 @xcite .",
    "however , there is a major discrepancy between the modeled and observed c@xmath3h@xmath1 anion - to - neutral ratio ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and the lack of anions in pdrs @xcite is at variance with the model predictions of @xcite .",
    "clearly , our understanding of molecular anion chemistry is incomplete .",
    "nevertheless , as demonstrated by @xcite , anion measurements have the potential to offer insight into interstellar cloud properties due to their reactivity @xcite , and consequently , their sensitivity to the abundances of gas - phase electrons and atomic c , h and o , and to physical conditions such as cloud density and molecular depletion .",
    "observations of anions in a variety of interstellar environments will be key to a complete understanding of their chemistry . given the relatively small number of molecular anion detections in the ism to date , we set out to address the question of just how widespread anions are in interstellar clouds , and to ascertain the behavior of the anion - to - neutral ratio over a range of cloud types and ages .    in this article ,",

    "there is a clear division in the anion - to - neutral ratio between young , ` quiescent ' and older , ` star - forming ' cores : for the quiescent , chemically - young cores l1495b and tmc-1 ( cp ) , c@xmath0h@xmath1/c@xmath0h  @xmath100% , and for the star - forming cores / protostars , c@xmath0h@xmath1/c@xmath0h  @xmath101% .",
    "l1495b is the most chemically - young and quiescent of our sources @xcite , with no evidence for nearby star - formation , and has the lowest c@xmath0h@xmath1/c@xmath0h ratio in our sample ( @xmath102% ) .",
    "the very low - luminosity , low - mass protostar ( vello ) l1389",
    "smm1 , on the other hand , evidently contains among the most evolved matter in our sample ( having passed through the quiescent and star - forming stages ) , and has the highest anion - to - neutral ratio ( c@xmath0h@xmath1/c@xmath0h  =  @xmath103% ) .",
    "this value is similar to the value of @xmath104% found in l1521f by @xcite , which also contains a vello @xcite . comparing our results with other sources from the literature ,",
    "l1527 @xcite contains a somewhat more - evolved class 0/i protostar , and this source has a significantly larger c@xmath0h@xmath1/c@xmath0h ratio of @xmath105% .",
    "thus , we confirm the apparent relationship identified by @xcite between the evolutionary state of interstellar matter and its c@xmath0h@xmath1 anion - to - neutral ratio .",
    "the quiescent cloud lupus-1a observed by @xcite also fits the trend ( with c@xmath0h@xmath1/c@xmath0h  =  @xmath106% ) , as does the very low - luminosity protostar chameleon mms1 ( with its upper limit of c@xmath0h@xmath1/c@xmath0h  @xmath107% ; @xcite ) .",
    "the dense prestellar core l1544 may deviate , however , with a relatively low ratio of @xmath108% @xcite .",
    "the observed c@xmath0h@xmath1/c@xmath0h trend and its correlation with @xmath89 shown in figure  [ fig : anr ] can be understood in the context of the theoretical study of @xcite , who identified the effects of depletion on the c@xmath0h@xmath1 anion - to - neutral ratio , the degree of which is related to both the density and chemical age of the cloud .",
    "depletion occurs as atoms and molecules collide with and stick to dust grains , and thus proceeds faster in denser media .",
    "increased depletion affects the anion - to - neutral ratio in two ways : ( 1 ) the free electron abundance goes up so that more c@xmath0h@xmath1 is produced by radiative electron attachment and ( 2 ) the atomic o and h abundances go down , thus reducing the anion destruction rate .",
    "our c@xmath0h@xmath1 observations agree with this theory , particularly for the quiescent cores and the protostars , which are believed to lie at opposite ends of the interstellar chemical / dynamic evolutionary path .",
    "measured anion - to - neutral ratios , however , are not sufficiently accurate to draw a clear distinction among the ( moderately evolved ) prestellar cores and star - forming gas clouds of l1172 , l1251a , l1512 and tmc-1c .",
    "these clouds likely contain gas that spans a range of densities and degrees of chemical evolution .",
    "more accurate measurements of density , depletion and the c@xmath0h@xmath1/c@xmath0h ratio at high spatial resolution will be required in order to confirm the utility of the anion - to - neutral ratio as a measure of the evolutionary state of interstellar clouds .",
    "our detection of c@xmath3h@xmath1 constitutes the smallest reported column density for this molecule in any source to - date .",
    "consistent with the trend described above for c@xmath0h@xmath1 , the c@xmath3h@xmath1 anion - to - neutral ratio of @xmath77 in tmc-1 ( cp ) is about nine times smaller than observed in l1527 by @xcite .",
    "theory regarding c@xmath3h@xmath1 chemistry is less well understood than for c@xmath0h@xmath1 , but it seems plausible to again ascribe the lower value in tmc-1 ( and the moderately low value of @xmath109 in lupus-1a ; @xcite ) , to chemical effects resulting from the lower densities and younger evolutionary states of these sources compared with l1527 .",
    "the very low observed c@xmath3h@xmath1 anion - to - neutral ratios compared with c@xmath0h@xmath1 are at variance with chemical models that consider the formation of c@xmath3h@xmath1 to be by radiative electron attachment to c@xmath3h at the rate calculated by @xcite .",
    "recent ab - initio calculations by v. kokoouline and colleagues ( private communication , 2012 ) show that the c@xmath3h radiative attachment rate may be several orders of magnitude less than previously thought , and based on observations of the c@xmath3h@xmath1/c@xmath3h ratio in l1527 , @xcite calculated a c@xmath3h radiative attachment rate a factor of 122 less than the theoretical value of @xcite . however , using the laboratory data of @xcite , @xcite identified that a significant pathway to smaller hydrocarbon anions is _ via _ reactions of larger anions with atomic oxygen .",
    "thus , an important source of c@xmath3h@xmath1 is the reaction    @xmath110    as a consequence of this ( and the analogous reaction that forms c@xmath7h@xmath1 from c@xmath0h@xmath1 + o ) , using the model of @xcite at @xmath111  @xmath18 ( applicable to tmc-1 ) , it is possible to set the radiative attachment rates for both c@xmath3h and c@xmath7h to zero and still produce an absolute c@xmath3h@xmath1 abundance and c@xmath3h@xmath1/c@xmath3h ratio that are within a factor of a few of the observed values .",
    "it is therefore plausible that radiative electron attachment is not the dominant route to the formation of c@xmath3h@xmath1 in molecular clouds .",
    "we conducted a search for the carbon - chain anion c@xmath0h@xmath1 in seven nearby molecular clouds selected based on their strong hc@xmath9n emission .",
    "c@xmath0h@xmath1 and c@xmath0h were detected in all sources , with a mean anion - to - neutral ratio of 3.0% ( standard deviation 0.92% ) .",
    "combined with the four previous c@xmath0h@xmath1 detections in other sources , we deduce that anions are ubiquitous in the ism wherever sufficient c@xmath0h is present to be easily detectable .    from the combined sample of eleven known interstellar sources with c@xmath0h@xmath1 detections , we confirm the trend identified by @xcite for anion - to - neutral ratios to be smaller in younger , less dense environments and larger in older , denser environments .",
    "this is consistent with the theory of @xcite that anion - to - neutral ratios are sensitive to the depletion of atomic o and h , and to the electron density , both of which become larger in denser , more chemically - evolved cores .",
    "molecular hydrogen number densities were derived for each source based on radiative transfer fits to observed hc@xmath9n spectra ; a positive correlation is observed between c@xmath0h@xmath1/c@xmath0h and @xmath89 .",
    "we report the first detection of c@xmath3h@xmath1 in tmc-1 , and derive an anion - to - neutral ratio c@xmath3h@xmath1/c@xmath3h  @xmath112 ( @xmath6% ) .",
    "this is the smallest anion - to - neutral ratio yet observed and confirms a problem with the theoretical value for the c@xmath3h electron attachment rate , which is apparently several orders of magnitude too large .",
    "the observed c@xmath3h@xmath1 may instead be formed by reactions of the larger hydrocarbon anions ( c@xmath0h@xmath1 and c@xmath7h@xmath1 ) with atomic oxygen .",
    "given the widespread presence of anions in space , a combination of further dedicated laboratory , observational and theoretical studies will be required in order to better understand their behavior and thus their full importance in astrochemistry .",
    "measurements of radiative electron attachment rates for hydrocarbons , and branching ratios for reactions of anions with atomic oxygen will be of particular importance in this regard .",
