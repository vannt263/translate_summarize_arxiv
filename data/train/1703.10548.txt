    "recent interest in complex social systems , such as social networks , the world - wide - web , email networks and mobile phone networks @xcite , has led researchers to investigate the processes that could explain the dynamics of human behaviour within these networks .",
    "human dynamics is not limited to the study of behaviour in communication networks , and has a broader remit similar to the aims of _ sociophysics _",
    "@xcite , which uses concepts and methods from statistical physics to investigate social phenomena , opinion formation and political behaviour .",
    "a central idea here is that , in the context of statistical physics , individual humans can be thought of as `` social atoms '' , each exhibiting simple individual behaviour and possessing very limited intelligence , but nevertheless collectively yielding complex social patterns @xcite . in sociophysics ,",
    "critical phenomena are important in demonstrating how the transition to global behaviour can emerge from the interactions of many individual social atoms , for example , as described in @xcite , where the popularity of movies emerges as collective choice behaviour .",
    "the employed methodology often involves the empirical investigation of collective choice dynamics , resulting in the postulation of statistical laws governing , for example , universal properties of election results @xcite .",
    "the existence of such universal patterns , which are consistent across different countries and over a considerable time span , may suggest a fundamental underlying social pattern that could provide insight into the processes that determine human decision making @xcite .",
    "a crucial issue in the process of statistical model building is that the model must be tested against experimental data and superseded by a newer model that better explains the data when such a model is found @xcite .    in the context of human dynamics , we have been particularly interested in formulating _ generative models _ in the form of stochastic processes by which complex systems evolve and give rise to power laws or other distributions @xcite .",
    "this type of research builds on the early work of simon @xcite , and the more recent work of barabsi s group @xcite and other researchers @xcite . in the bigger picture",
    ", one can view the goal of such research as being similar to that of _ social mechanisms _",
    "@xcite , which looks into the processes , or mechanisms , that can explain observed social phenomena .",
    "using an example given in @xcite , the growth in the sales of a book can be explained by the well - known logistic growth model @xcite , and more recently we have shown that the process of conference registration with an early bird deadline can be modelled by bi - logistic growth @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we employ the multiplicative process @xcite introduced in @xcite , which is described by the same underlying equations as the generative model proposed in @xcite .",
    "this was designed to capture the essential dynamics of survival analysis applications @xcite . as in @xcite",
    ", we introduce rank - ordering into the model as a natural mechanism in situations where there is no intrinsic ordering of the data , such as constituency - based election results @xcite or , as in this paper , regional referendum results .",
    "rank - ordering @xcite is a technique in which we rank the data objects according to some numerically described feature .",
    "we then plot this feature against rank , and finally analyse the resulting distribution .",
    "examples of rank - order distributions are : the distribution of large earthquakes @xcite , the distribution of oil reserve sizes @xcite , zipf s rank - frequency distribution ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section  1.4.3 ) , the size distribution of cities @xcite , and the distribution of historical extreme events @xcite .    in many real - world situations ,",
    "zipf s distribution , or more generally a power - law distribution , may only manifest itself for small and intermediate ranks , while for larger ranks a more pronounced cutoff is observed @xcite .",
    "this has led researchers to combine these two regimes into a single distribution , called _ the beta - like function _",
    "@xcite , which appears to exhibit universal behaviour for rank - order distributions and is asymptotically a beta distribution ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter 25 ) .",
    "whereas , in @xcite , the beta - like function is shown to be indirectly linked to a multinomial multiplicative process , here we introduce the _ beta - like survival function _ as a direct and intuitive consequence of a multiplicative decrease process , where an _ attrition function _ controls the rate of decrease of the survival function at each stage of the process . in section  [ sec : beta ] we will show that the beta - like function can be approximated by our beta - like survival function .",
    "in particular , the attrition function is a mixture of preferential ( cf .",
    "preferential attachment @xcite ) and uniform attrition mechanisms , where the former is inversely proportional to the rank of the voting district and the latter is uniform over the voting districts .",
    "the main contribution of the paper is to demonstrate the suitability of the beta - like survival function @xmath0 a rank - ordered distribution generated from a multiplicative process @xmath0 for modelling the uk 2016 eu regional referendum results .",
    "the eu referendum involved a binary choice , where voters had to choose between remaining or leaving the eu .",
    "voting behaviour in referenda often exhibits greater volatility than that found in general elections @xcite . in a referendum",
    ", parties are often internally divided over the issues , so party ideology is less of an issue than in a general election .",
    "moreover , uncertainties can introduce shifts in opinion when doubts are raised on important issues during the course of a campaign .",
    "the uk eu referendum , also known as the `` brexit '' referendum , will be analysed for many years to come , as it is considered a momentous event in the history of europe .    since robinson s seminal paper on the ecological fallacy @xcite",
    ", the use of aggregate data in political science has fallen into abeyance , superseded by survey methodology @xcite .",
    "most election analyses therefore focus on individual - level data . however , the fact that different districts in a country vote differently is also important .",
    "first , election results represent a complete sample , unaffected by survey sampling bias .",
    "second , electoral geography is an intrinsically interesting phenomenon , viz . the popular use of generalisations such as ` red ' and ` blue ' states or counties in america .",
    "third , where individual - level data is unavailable , as is the case in historical analysis , for small parties , or for many elections , ecological inference is required @xcite .",
    "finally , political scientists and practitioners pragmatically wish to know how the vote is dispersed across electoral districts as this can radically affect the number of seats a party wins in a majoritarian system . in the 2015 british general election , for instance ,",
    "ukip s dispersed 12.6% vote gave it just one seat , while the scottish nationalist party ( snp ) won 56 seats with their concentrated 4.7% . likewise , in the 1994 elections for the house of representatives in iowa , the democrats dispersed 42% of the vote failed to earn it a single one of the state s five house seats .",
    "aggregate models are also important for predicting election results in majoritarian systems . compared to polls or surveys which include attitudinal predictors , socioeconomic specifications predict little of the variation in individual - level voting .",
    "yet there is a quandary . at the aggregate level ,",
    "census - based socioeconomic models account for much of the variation in seat - level outcomes . while scholars of voting downplay socio - demographics ,",
    "these are enjoying a renaissance among election forecasters , who have augmented polls with census data to refine seat - level predictions @xcite ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter 2 ) .",
    "these outperform blanket vote - to - seat conversion rules such as the _ cube law _ @xcite .",
    "panel studies deploying aggregate data , which consider the effects of variables such as economic change , ` homegrown ' candidacy and incumbency on election results , perform extremely well in predicting seat - level changes over time @xcite . in this paper , we show how the use of a rank - ordered distribution can improve the accuracy of aggregate - level models . in particular , we focus on britain s referendum on whether to leave the european union .",
    "held on 23 june 2016 , the leave side won an unexpected 52 - 48 percent victory .    the rest of the paper is organised as follows . in section  [ sec : urn ]",
    "we present a multiplicative process that provides us with a mechanism to model the essential dynamics of ranked - ordered models , and we derive a well - known differential equation to describe the process . in section  [ sec : eu - ref ] we show how referendum results can be modelled using the multiplicative process presented in section  [ sec : urn ] , via the rank - ordering method . in section  [",
    "sec : beta ] we introduce the beta - like survival function , which is then used in section  [ sec : uk ] to model the results of the uk 2016 eu referendum .",
    "finally , in section  [ sec : conc ] we give our concluding remarks .",
    "we next present a generative model in the form of a _ multiplicative process _ @xcite that can also be viewed as a survival model similar to the one introduced in @xcite , in the context of human dynamics ; this model was first introduced in @xcite but we repeat it in the context of a referendum for completeness . in its simplest form ,",
    "a multiplicative process generates a log - normal distribution ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter 14 ) , @xcite , and has applications in many fields , such as economics , biology and ecology @xcite .",
    "the solution to the multiplicative process we propose will be utilised in section  [ sec : eu - ref ] , in the context of a rank - ordered model of the proportion of votes attained for a particular answer in a multiple - choice question referendum .",
    "we assume a countable number of indices where , for a given answer , the @xmath1th index represents the @xmath1th district ranked in descending order of the number of votes for that answer . for any stage @xmath2 , @xmath3 , we let @xmath4 , @xmath5 , be the probability that a potential vote is lost in the @xmath1th district at that stage . usually @xmath4 is known as the _ mortality rate function _ , but here we prefer to call it the _ attrition function _ , which is more descriptive in the context of voting .",
    "we always require that @xmath6 for all @xmath2 .",
    "we now let @xmath7 , @xmath8 , be a discrete function representing , for a given answer , the expected proportion of the popular vote potentially attainable for that answer in district @xmath1 at stage @xmath2 .",
    "initially , we set @xmath9 for a dummy district @xmath10 , and @xmath11 for all @xmath12 .",
    "the dynamics of the multiplicative process can be captured by the following two equations : @xmath13 and @xmath14    equations ( [ eq : init ] ) and ( [ eq : diff ] ) define the expected behaviour of a stochastic process @xcite describing how , as @xmath1 increases , the vote decreases in districts where the given answer is less popular . for any particular vote ,",
    "the attrition function is the probabilistic mechanism that decides whether the vote will be lost or not .",
    "the process obeys gibrat s law @xcite , which in its original form states that the proportional rate of growth of a firm is independent of its absolute size . in our context , gibrat s law states that the proportional rate of decrease in the popular vote is independent of the actual number of votes cast for the answer in the district .    as in @xcite , we approximate the discrete function @xmath7 by a continuous function @xmath15 , and @xmath4 is now also a continuous function ; @xmath15 is known as the _ survival function_. initially , we have @xmath16 for all @xmath2 , and @xmath17 for all @xmath12 .",
    "the dynamics of the model is now captured by the first - order hyperbolic partial differential equation @xcite , @xmath18 which is the same as that encountered in age - structured models of population dynamics @xcite .",
    "equation ( [ eq : partial ] ) is the well - known _ transport equation _ in fluid dynamics @xcite , and the _ renewal equation _ in population dynamics @xcite .",
    "following equation @xmath19 in @xcite , the solution of ( [ eq : partial ] ) , when @xmath20 , is given by @xmath21",
    "we consider a multiple - choice question referendum with several options , where the votes are counted over the whole electorate @xcite .",
    "often , as in the case of the uk eu referendum , only two choices are presented to the public : accepting or rejecting a proposal . in a referendum , unlike in an election , voters are not choosing among political parties or political candidates , and thus campaigns are often cross - party , as in the uk eu referendum .",
    "the voting takes place across the country in a designated number of local authority districts , and the votes are aggregated country - wide .",
    "we make use of the rank - ordering technique @xcite in the context of a _ voter model _ @xcite as follows . focusing on one particular answer to the referendum question , we model the proportion of votes",
    "@xmath22 attained for that answer in district @xmath1 , where @xmath1 represents the _ rank _ of the district and @xmath23 .",
    "thus , ordering the districts in descending order of the proportion of votes , we obtain the _ votes vector _ @xmath24 , where : @xmath25    dsitrict @xmath10 is a `` dummy '' district with @xmath26 . in the unlikely event that two districts have exactly the same proportion of votes , their order is chosen randomly .",
    "the votes vector is analogous to the empirical survival function @xmath27 @xcite , where @xmath22 , which corresponds to @xmath28 , can be viewed as an estimate of the expected proportion of the popular vote in district @xmath1 , given that @xmath29 was the proportion in district @xmath30 ; cf .",
    "the _ kaplan - meier estimator _ @xcite in the context of survival models . in the context of the voter model",
    ", we see that @xmath31 , where @xmath32 , the final stage , is equal to the number of voting districts .",
    "the rank - ordering of the districts , as in ( [ eq : votes ] ) , can be simulated by the multiplicative process described in section  [ sec : urn ] , where @xmath1 corresponds to the @xmath1th highest ranked district .",
    "an appropriate attrition function @xmath4 is used , which is often decreasing in @xmath1 . in terms of the voter model , as we consider less popular districts for the given answer , i.e. those of lower `` rank '' ( remembering that a lower rank is represented by a higher seat number ) , more votes are lost .    thus , given a suitable attrition function , as presented in the next section , we can generate the votes vector using the process described in section  [ sec : urn ] . in the next section ,",
    "we propose the beta - like survival function as a possible distribution for the votes vector , and in section  [ sec : uk ] we demonstrate its suitability for modeling the 2016 uk eu referendum .",
    "the _ beta - like function _",
    "@xcite , see ( [ eq : beta - like ] ) below , is a discrete version of the beta distribution ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter 25 ) , which has been shown to be a very good fit for a variety of rank - ordered data distributions .",
    "here we propose the similar _ beta - like survival function _ , which is derived from ( [ eq : renewal ] ) with the specific attrition function introduced in ( [ eq : mixture ] ) below . in @xcite",
    ", an argument is given that relates the beta - like function to a multinomial multiplicative process , while here we show that it can be derived as a direct consequence of the multiplicative process introduced in section  [ sec : urn ] with the attrition function in ( [ eq : mixture ] ) .",
    "we now derive the beta - like survival function from ( [ eq : renewal ] ) by introducing the following attrition function , which is the mixture of rank - dependent and rank - independent attrition , @xmath33 where @xmath34 and @xmath35 are positive constants , and @xmath20 .    in the context of the generative model introduced in section  [ sec : urn ] , the rank - dependent component @xmath36 in ( [ eq : mixture ] ) models _ preferential attrition _ , i.e. the potential loss of a vote is dependent on the rank @xmath1 of the district , where @xmath20 . on the other hand , the rank - independent component @xmath37 models _ uniform attrition _ at stage @xmath2 , where we note that @xmath2 is bounded below by the number of voting districts .",
    "preferential attrition might occur , for instance , because a district s rank ( i.e brexit vote share ) may exert a contextual effect on the voting decisions of its constituent individuals ; or may attract movers from other districts with similar political characteristics ; or may produce an increased supply of local election volunteers .",
    "all produce positive feedbacks .",
    "thus , from ( [ eq : renewal ] ) , it follows that the survival function is given by @xmath38    we call @xmath15 the _ beta - like survival function _ , motivated by the following argument .",
    "letting @xmath39 and assuming that @xmath35 is much smaller than @xmath1 , equation  ( [ eq : beta - like - weibull ] ) can be approximated by @xmath40 which is the beta - like function proposed in @xcite ; we note that we obtain the _ lavalette function _ in the special case when @xmath41 @xcite .",
    "therefore , the multiplicative process presented in section  [ sec : urn ] provides a direct and intuitive generative model for the beta - like function .",
    "in contrast , the multinomial multiplicative process described in @xcite is indirectly linked to the beta - like function via a stretched exponential @xcite derived by ranking the components of a multinomial distribution , and only afterwards fitting a beta - like function .",
    "we crystalise ( [ eq : beta - like - weibull ] ) by fixing @xmath42 and including a scaling constant @xmath43 for normalisation purposes , so that @xmath44    the justification for fixing @xmath35 is that its sole purpose in ( [ eq : mixture ] ) is to prevent the first term being undefined when @xmath45 ; setting @xmath46 seems sensible since , when @xmath1 is large , the precise value of @xmath35 is rather unimportant .",
    "it can be seen that the beta - like survival function in ( [ eq : beta - like - kappa ] ) combines two regimes .",
    "when @xmath1 is close to @xmath2 , the second term dominates exhibiting a polynomial decay , otherwise the first term dominates exhibiting power - law behaviour . in terms of ( [ eq : mixture ] ) , the preferential attrition component gives rise to the power - law regime , while the uniform attrition component gives rise to the polynomial decay regime .",
    "we define a linear transformation @xmath47 of @xmath15 as follows : @xmath48 where the scaling constant @xmath43 from ( [ eq : beta - like - kappa ] ) is absorbed into the _ slope _",
    "parameter @xmath49 , and @xmath50 is the _ shift _ parameter .",
    "we now make use of the beta - like survival function , derived in section  [ sec : beta ] , to analyse the remain and leave votes of the 2016 eu referendum for the 382 local authority districts in the uk ( we will often refer to these simply as districts ) ; the full set of electoral results is available online at @xcite .",
    "all the computations were carried out using the matlab software package .",
    "as noted earlier , britain voted to leave the european union on 23 june 2016 .",
    "this result surprised pollsters and commentators .",
    "aggregate analysis subsequently showed that education was the strongest socio - demographic predictor of the vote @xcite .",
    "multi - level analysis of individual data revealed that this was mainly due to the compositional effect of less - educated people voting leave , but also because of a contextual effect , whereby those with a degree living in areas with lower average education tended to have their opinions shaped by their community and vice - versa .",
    "as goodwin and heath write , those with low qualifications were 16 points less likely to vote to leave the eu if they lived in an area with the highest as opposed to lowest average education in the country .",
    "those with a - levels or a degree living in these high - skill areas were 30 points less likely to have voted to leave than their similarly qualified compatriots living in the lowest - educated areas @xcite .",
    "the latter process introduces a positive feedback between aggregate and individual voting : aggregates shape individuals , who in turn comprise aggregates .",
    "these positive feedbacks help explain electoral extremes , such as the 78.6% of the london borough of lambeth who voted remain or the 75.6% in boston , lincolnshire who opted to leave .",
    "this nonlinear clustering distorts linear regression results , producing the inflated model fits noted in robinson s @xcite article . in many elections ,",
    "local campaign effects are likewise important : areas with particular social characteristics tend to be targeted or avoided by parties , and tend to produce a larger or smaller supply of local volunteers .",
    "populist right parties , for example , focus their resources on whiter , less educated districts , which also produce more volunteers . we know from the british election study that , when people are contacted by a party , they are more likely - all other things being equal - to have voted for that party @xcite .",
    "thus contextual effects enhance political supply , which contributes to further positive feedbacks and nonlinear vote distributions over location .",
    "taking account of this clustering within the geographic distribution of both independent and dependent variables helps improve model fit in aggregate election analyses .",
    "in subsection  [ subsec : referendum ] , using nonlinear least squares regression , we fit beta - like survival functions @xmath15 to the referendum results vectors @xmath51 for both the entire uk and scotland , and in subsection  [ subsec : covariates ] we investigate how the beta - like survival function can be used to associate regional covariates with the referendum data .",
    "we use subscripts @xmath52 and @xmath53 to denote the uk and scotland , respectively , for example , @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
    "the overall result for the entire uk electorate was 48.11% for remain and 51.89% for leave .",
    "the fitted parameters @xmath56 , @xmath57 and @xmath43 for the uk regional referendum results as a whole , together with the coefficient of determination @xmath58 @xcite are shown in table  [ table : ref1 ] . as can be seen , the power - law exponent @xmath56 for leave is significantly lower than that for remain , while the decay exponent @xmath57 for leave is somewhat higher than that for remain .",
    "this may indicate that the proportions of votes for leave were more `` stable '' across the country than those for remain .",
    "in other words , it is feasible that positive feedbacks driven by contextual effects on individual vote choice mattered more in remain than leave areas",
    ". both @xmath58 values are very high , indicating very good fits of the beta - like survival function to the data .",
    ".[table : ref1 ] nonlinear least - squares regression fitting the beta - like survival function @xmath54 to the empirical results vector @xmath59 of the regional results for the uk eu referendum . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     future research could examine how the deployment of beta - like survival functions of the form we have outlined might be used to generate nonlinear predictive models that could yield superior election predictions to the linear regression models currently used by election forecasters @xcite ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter 2 ) .",
    "most phenomena in the social sciences are not normally distributed across geographical units because individuals and contexts influence each other .",
    "contextual and selection effects lead to positive feedback loops which produce extreme geographic concentrations of both social characteristics and political opinions / behaviour .",
    "we have proposed a multiplicative process that generates the rank - order distribution of the uk eu regional referendum results . in our model , the proportion of votes attained for a given party decreases according to a specified function , leading to a rank - order distribution represented by the votes vector . a solution to the continuous approximation of the equation specifying the model",
    "was given in ( [ eq : renewal ] ) , and is consequently identical to that of the renewal equation in population dynamics @xcite .",
    "we suggest that nonlinear social models of aggregate voting behaviour can outperform linear models .",
    "the beta - like survival function , obtained using an attrition function that is a mixture of preferential and uniform attrition mechanisms - thus generates an improved model for the uk eu referendum results .",
    "our results fit in well with the results in @xcite , where the beta - like function was shown to exhibit universal behaviour for rank - order distributions in several apparently unrelated disciplines .",
    "we have also shown that the beta - like survival function could be instrumental in building a predictive model of the referendum results through a judicious choice of covariates .",
    "the methodology we presented in subsection  [ subsec : covariates ] may be used in tandem with traditional regression methods @xcite , and may in fact have some advantages as rank - order distributions are very good at smoothing the data .",
    "more research needs to be done on the methodology for working with rank - order distributions , and in particular with the beta - like survival function , due to its hypothesised universality .",
    "in particular , devising principled regression methods that combine the covariates through multiple regression @xcite would be useful .",
    "it is also worth considering other transformations , apart from the linear transformation in ( [ eq : beta - like - linear ] ) , which could potentially improve the predictive power of the model .",
    "aggregate models of voting are important for understanding electoral geography , inferring individual - level relationships in the absence of individual data and for predicting election results in majoritarian systems .",
    "our nonlinear modelling technique , based on rank - ordering outcome and predictor variables , helps advance scholarship in these areas of political science .",
