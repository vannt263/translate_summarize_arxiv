    "quantum memory is considered as one of the major challenge for quantum communication and a key element for quantum computing / simulation schemes based on linear optics during a past decade @xcite .",
    "the main objective of quantum memory is to write , store and read out on demand a light pulse without destroying its quantum state . to implement the quantum memory ,",
    "many different protocols were proposed ( see reviews @xcite ) , based on these a number of key experimental advances have been achieved ( see for instance @xcite ) .",
    "recently the interests of community shift to the protocols ensured not only high efficiency of quantum state storage and retrieval , but also fit for storage of the signals with many degrees of freedom @xcite .",
    "broadband or spatially multimode schemes provide this multiplexing . addressing to quantum protocols of long - distant communication , for which memory cells are the key tool ,",
    "it is clear that the information capacity of the channel strongly depends on its spectral bandwidth , so that the cell memory as a spectral filter should satisfy some requirements . on the other hand ,",
    "the involvement of transverse spatial degrees of freedom of the cell and `` parallelization '' of information stream is also an important resource of spatial multiplexing . assessing the benefits of quantum memories for production of multiphoton states",
    ", authors @xcite have introduced an parameter @xmath2 , where @xmath3 and @xmath4 are the efficiency and time - bandwidth product of the memories , respectively ( and @xmath4 is the product of the acceptance bandwidth of the memories and their coherence lifetime ) .",
    "thus , in addition to the high efficiency , we have to be concerned about the spectral properties of the proposed memory protocols . here",
    "we analyze and compare in details the efficiency along with the spectral bandwidths of two memory protocols .",
    "well known that if you consider off - resonant interaction between atomic ensemble ( prepared in the ground state ) and two fields - signal and driving , than the interaction hamiltonian for such a system , after elimination of the excited state , can be cast in the form @xmath5 in quantum optics this hamiltonian is well - known as the beamsplitter hamiltonian .",
    "the interface mixes the input atom and light states as a `` beamsplitter '' and the `` reflection coefficient '' of unity corresponds to a perfect state swapping between light and atoms .",
    "however , this ideology not always may be applicable .",
    "if for some reason the upper excited state can not be excluded from consideration , such schemes are not beamsplitter - like , and therefore results proved for beamsplitter - like schemes can not be used to them without further justification . moreover , even for the off - resonant models of memory , when one takes into account the spatial aspects of light - matter interaction and considers the propagation of the fields in thick atomic layer , the direct beamsplitter analogy is also inapplicable .",
    "we consider here two quantum memory protocols based on the resonant interaction between an atomic ensemble and fields - signal and driving .",
    "the schemes differ in duration of interaction that leads to differences in formation of the atomic coherence , on which state of the signal field is mapped .",
    "one of our main issues here is to analyze the quantum efficiency .",
    "we want to find out whether this characteristic of memory is as universal for non beamsplitter - like protocols as for beamsplitter - like ones , i.e. could we predict how well a certain quantum state will be survived in the memory , if we know only the efficiency of this memory . to demonstrate our arguments",
    ", we consider the storage of squeezing in the schemes of adiabatic and high - speed quantum memory .",
    "thereto we analyze how the squeezed light from a particular source with the desired properties is mapped on the atomic ensemble and then read out . squeezing storage",
    "was analyzed in @xcite , but as opposed to our consideration the authors there do not touch any spatial aspects of interaction and solved the problem for the flat input spectrum . we will also solve the eigenfunction problem for two considered memory protocols .",
    "a similar problem was solved for raman - type protocols ( @xcite ) , when the transformation is unitary .",
    "based on the analysis of eigenfunctions , we compare the spectral bandwidth of the memories .",
    "bs an ideal quantum memory ( qm ) maps the quantum state of a light pulse into a long lived coherence in the atomic ground state using a 2-photon transition , with the help of a strong classical control field .",
    "the signal retrieval , obtained through the interaction of the atomic coherence with the control field should provide a light pulse with the same classical and quantum properties as the input pulse .",
    "several criteria have been proposed to measure the quality of this quantum memory .",
    "the first one is the efficiency , which measures the ratio of the input and output field intensities and uses classical quantities .",
    "the second one is the fidelity , @xmath6 , with @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the initial wave vector ( pure state ) of the light , and @xmath9 is the density matrix describing the state of light after retrieval .",
    "the fidelity is a measure of the conservation of the quantum features of the signal , and allows characterizing the memory as compared to a classical memory , for which the fidelity is limited to some maximal value .",
    "however , the fidelity depends on the stored state and can not be considered as a characterization of the memory device itself .",
    "a third benchmark the `` tv criterion '' was introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite and involves a classical feature , the transmission ( efficiency ) but also quantum characterization with the conditional variance v , and allows to establish quantum bounds , while evaluating the classical characteristics . in this paper",
    ", we will be interested in both the classical and the quantum benchmarks and we will consider the specific example of squeezed light storage , where several factors can impact the retrieved field . an intuitive understanding of the connection between the storage of squeezing and the efficiency can be gained from the `` beamsplitter '' model of a quantum memory , where the a full writing and reading cycle can be modelled by the transmission through a beamsplitter . indeed , let us write the relation between input signal @xmath10 and output signal @xmath11 in the form of the beamsplitter transformation : & & a_out ( t)= a_in ( t)- a_vac ( t).eff1 here , the `` transmission '' coefficient @xmath12 models the efficiency of the quantum memory process .",
    "let us rewrite this in the fourier domain : & & a_out,= a_in,- a_vac , .",
    "eff2 going from the field amplitudes @xmath13 to the fluctuations of the quadrature components @xmath14 and @xmath15 we get    & & x_out , x_out,-= t x_in , x_in,-+ ( 1-t ) x_vac , x_vac,- .",
    "eff3 introducing the squeezing parameters for the input field @xmath16 and for the output field @xmath17 , we obtain & & x_out , x_out,-=e^-r_out(),x_in , x_in,-=e^-r_in().eff4 for the vacuum field amplitude & & x_vac , x_vac,-=.eff5 as a result we get the equation & & 1-e^-r_out()=t@xmath18.eff6 we can conclude that the efficiency allows a full characterization of the quantum memory for squeezing transfer if the beamsplitter model is applicable . if the efficiency is close to unity , then the light squeezing is well preserved in the read - out pulse .    in this article , we will consider two cases of resonant quantum memory , namely the adiabatic qm @xcite and high - speed qm @xcite .",

    "nca in this paper , we consider an ensemble of three - level atoms in a @xmath21-configuration ( fig .",
    "1 ) that will be used to store temporal and spatial multimode quantum fields .",
    "the atoms resonantly interact with two electromagnetic fields , a signal field @xmath22 and a driving field @xmath23 , that connect the two atomic ground states to the excited state .",
    "the driving field is a strong classical field propagating as a plane wave , while the signal field is a weak quantum field with a transverse structure . during the writing process",
    "both fields interact with the medium simultaneously .",
    "the dynamics of such a system is described by a set of equations for connecting the signal field amplitude @xmath24 that is going to be recorded in the atomic medium , operator @xmath25 , associated with the atomic coherence on the transition @xmath26 , which arises in the writing process , and operator @xmath27 , associated with an atomic coherence on the transition @xmath28 @xcite : & & a(z , t;q)=- gn c(z , t;q), 1 + & & c(z , t;q)=-c(z ,",

    "could it be ?",
    "a clue to this paradox lies in the multimode nature of the interaction . in the next section",

    "we will carry out the numerical calculations at the same values of parameters as before ( in fig .",

    ", dimensionless frequency is @xmath129.,height=377 ]    , dimensionless frequency is @xmath130.,height=377 ]    the distinguishing feature of the high - speed qm model is not only the filtering in this scheme of only two modes , but also the localization of these modes in different intervals of the timeline ( the first mode is actually localized in the range of @xmath131 $ ] , and the second one - in @xmath132 $ ] ) .",
    "draw attention that the boundaries of intervals coincide with the locations of two peaks in the curve in fig .",
    "[ fig4]a . for the adiabatic memory such a mode `` separation ''",
    "is not observed .",
    "now let us see how squeezing is distributed over the modes , that means we want to follow whether all eigenmodes of the cell are squeezed .",
    "for this aim we plotted the spectra of the first three modes ( see the third row in figs .",
    "[ fig5 ] and [ fig6 ] ) .",
    "recall that the input field has the wide spectrum of squeezing ( see fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) .",
    "one can see that all of our spectra of eigenmodes are concentrated in the area of good squeezing , that means , they are well squeezed . however , not all of them contribute to the squeezing of pulse as whole ( squeezing at the zero frequency ) .",
    "going back to the curves in fig .",
    "[ fig4]a , we see that at time @xmath133 the first mode of the field is mostly read - out , the second mode is localized on the other time interval , and the rest is filtered out by the cell .",
    "the zero spectral component of the first mode is high and squeezed well ( that is the first mode as whole is squeezed well ) .",
    "thus , although the half part of the photons still is not read - out - they will be retrieved from the second mode , one can obtain a high squeezing in the retrieved pulse .",
    "it should be noted that the two qm models are very different spectrally . to estimate the typical spectral widths for eigenmodes in both cases",
    ", we should revert from the dimensionless variables to dimensional ones . recall that the dimensionless procedures for the models are different . for time we got the relations ( [ hs29 ] ) and ( [ ad4 ] ) , respectively : _",
    "hs t t_hs , t t_ad , where we now added the below indexes _ `` hs '' _ and _ `` ad '' _ to indicate the high - speed or adiabatic model , respectively .",
    "besides , the requirements imposed on the rabi frequency , are opposite : _",
    "hs,_ad , whence it follows @xmath134 , and the ratio of this frequencies has to be at least 2 orders . based on these inequalities and noting that the ratio of dimensionless spectral widths in figs .",
    "[ fig5 ] and [ fig6 ] is @xmath135 , we find that the width of eigenmodes in the adiabatic model is at least 4 orders of magnitude smaller than the corresponding width in the high - speed model . at the same time , one can see that although the dimensionless values of @xmath136 are different , we can assume that both calculations were carried out at the same optical depth @xmath137 ( supposing the relation @xmath138 to be fulfilled ) .",
    "let us note that the relation between the parameters typical for the high - speed qm , can be easily reached in experiments with resonant @xmath21-atoms , especially for cold atomic ensemble , than for the adiabatic condition .",
    "figures [ fig5 ] and [ fig6 ] shows that the spectral bandwidths of memories are much less than the chosen spectral width of the input signal .",
    "we can say that this choice was not optimal , and it is necessary to match the input signal to the memory capacity . in this sense , the model of high - speed qm looks more attractive because it provides a much wider spectral bandwidth of the signal as mentioned above .",
    "the decrease in the value of the spectral width @xmath109 , while maintaining the duration of the input pulse results in a loss of input pulse squeezing ( see fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] ) .",
    "however , it is seen that for @xmath139 for the high - speed qm and for @xmath140 for the adiabatic qm these losses are relatively small ( about 10% ) , and the ratio @xmath141 is still satisfied .    in fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] the input and retrieval spectra of squeezing are plotted for the case when spectral bandwidth of squeezing of the input signal is matched to the memory bandwidth .",
    "since considered memory cells are the mode filters , i.e. they are sensitive to only a few the first modes of input signal , then the presence of other modes at the input does not affect to the pulse squeezing . from the fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] one can see that the zero spectral component is large enough only in the spectra of the first and second eigenmodes .",
    "at the same time , the square input pulse is well approximated by the superposition of the first two modes .",
    "that is why the comparison of the two mental experiments ( estimation of the efficiency and of the storage of squeezing ) with the different input signals seems to us justified .",
    "for example , in the scheme of high - speed qm if knowing the properties of our cell as a mode filter , we form an input signal as a superposition of the first two modes , then the curves in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] remain almost unchanged .",
    "in raman memory models based on three - level atoms , two quantum sub - systems ( the signal field and atomic coherence ) are interacted with each other .",
    "the writing and read - out processes are formally realized by means of the interaction hamiltonian of the kind of @xmath142 .",
    "this hamiltonian ensures the beamsplitter - like interaction for the thin atomic layer and as a result one can derive the input - output equation ( [ eff1 ] ) and conclude that squeezing and efficiency are coupled by the formula ( [ eff6 ] ) .",
    "this means that the efficiency turns out to be sufficient to assess the quality of memory @xcite .    in this article",
    "we consider more complicated situation , which takes place in the cases of adiabatical and high - speed memories in the strongly resonant limit . in each of these models",
    "there are three quantum sub - systems : the signal field and two atomic coherences for the high - speed memory and the signal field , atomic coherence , and the vacuum reservoir , forming the langevine source , for the adiabatic memory .",
    "the presence of more than two active subsystems makes impossible direct interpretation of interaction as a beamsplitter - like one .",
    "however maybe we still can apply such an interpretation in some sense ?",
    "let s consider again the equation ( [ ad22 ] ) coupling the signal field at the output of the memory cell after the read - out with the signal at the front of the cell before the writing process .",

    "( [ 6.15 ] ) can be used for comparison of the degree of squeezing in the input and output modes .",

    "such a generalization can be a subject for further study .",
    "addressing once again to the comparison of two memory models presented in this paper , we note that different factors lead to a vanishing of the role of the langevin noises in this cases . in high - speed qm model",
    "the noises can be excluded from consideration in very beginning , when we construct equations , since on the typical interaction time the spontaneous decay of the excited state is negligible , and hence the noise associated with this decay is also small .",
    "the situation is different in adiabatic qm model . here , the rate of the spontaneous relaxation is large that yields to the presence of langevin noise sources , which associated with population decay of the excited state as well as with decay of the coherences on the transitions coupled with the excited state .",
    "however , due to the initial assumption that the population of level @xmath166 is small ( and almost all atoms remain on the level @xmath167 ) the additional noise terms turn out to be small .    in this study , we demonstrated that both memory models considered here allow us to achieve high efficiency for writing and restore of the light pulse , and are suitable for storage of the squeezed states .",
    "we have shown that the quantum efficiency of whole writing - reading cycle for a pulse with arbitrary time profile is not a universal characteristic of the memory , through which the other properties of the memory ( for example , the ability to store a squeezing ) can be expressed .",
    "only the efficiency defined in relation to a single eigenmode of the memory is such a comprehensive parameter .",
    "thus for a pulse with an arbitrary shape it is not enough to provide the high efficiency of the memory to conclude about preserving the quantum state of light .",

    "<S> in this article the ability to record , store , and read out the quantum properties of light is studied . </S>",
    "<S> the discussion is based on high - speed and adiabatic models of quantum memory in lambda - configuration and in the limit of strong resonance . </S>",
    "<S> we show that in this case the equality between efficiency and squeezing ratio , predicted by the simple beamsplitter model , is broken . </S>",
    "<S> the requirement of the maximum squeezing in the output pulse should not be accompanied by the requirement of maximum efficiency of memory , as in the beamsplitter model . we have demonstrated a high output pulse squeezing , when the efficiency reached only about 50% .    </S>",
    "<S> comprehension of this `` paradox '' is achieved on the basis of mode analysis . </S>",
    "<S> the memories eigenmodes , which have an impact on the memory process , are found numerically . </S>",
    "<S> also , the spectral analysis of modes was performed to match the spectral width of the input signal to the capacities of the memories .    </S>",
