    "integrable quantum field theories ( qfts ) in two dimensions have the remarkable property that their s - matrix factorizes and the bootstrap programme becomes manageable .",
    "the particle spectrum and s - matrix of several integrable qfts have been found by applying the axioms of general s - matrix theory and factorized scattering theory .",
    "studying supersymmetric field theories it is an interesting problem to determine the s - matrix and particle spectrum of integrable supersymmetrized qfts .    a formalism for constructing @xmath8 supersymmetric factorizable scattering theory is developed in @xcite .",
    "the particles of the non - supersymmetric theory are assumed to become supermultiplets @xmath9 , where @xmath10 are the one - particle states of the non - supersymmetric theory , and it is also assumed that all the particles of the supersymmetric theory are obtained in this way .",
    "the index @xmath11 specifies ( not necessarily all ) poincare - invariant conserved quantum numbers of the non - supersymmetric theory and @xmath12 specifies the supersymmetric quantum numbers .",
    "those conserved quantum numbers which are specified by @xmath11 must not change their value under charge conjugation , and supersymmetry ( except for boosts ) acts trivially on the @xmath10 part of the states . as the simplest ansatz",
    "the product form @xmath13 was proposed for the two - particle s - matrix @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the two - particle s - matrix of the non - supersymmetric theory subject to supersymmetrization , and the supersymmetric factor @xmath16 describes the mixing of supersymmetric indices ( see also the first paragraph of section 2 for conventions ) .",
    "the requirement that the particle spectrum can be obtained as described above is consistent with the ansatz for the s - matrix if `` minimal '' supersymmetric s - matrix factors having no poles and overall zeroes on the imaginary axis in the physical strip are used .",
    "we restrict ourselves to such s - matrix factors ( see section [ sec bshg ] for an exception ) .",
    "as the notation indicates , it is required that the susy representations associated to the particles depend on conserved poincare- and charge conjugation invariant quantum numbers only , what guarantees that the complete s - matrix ( including amplitudes of multi - particle scatterings ) of the supersymmetric theory also takes a product form .",
    "the complete two - particle s - matrix @xmath14 and so the supersymmetric factor @xmath4 commute with the action of supersymmetry .",
    "the yang - baxter , fusing , and bootstrap equations , the crossing equation , the unitarity and analyticity conditions are satisfied by @xmath14 and take a factorized form . since @xmath2 satisfies them , the supersymmetric factor @xmath4 must also satisfy them separately .",
    "the fusing angles occurring in the fusing and bootstrap equations for @xmath4 are determined by the non - supersymmetric theory , and since the bound state poles are already present in @xmath2 , the supersymmetric factor @xmath4 satisfies the bootstrap equations passively , i.e. @xmath4 does not have poles at the fusing rapidities .    an essential step in this construction",
    "is the choice of susy representations in which the particles transform .",
    "having made this choice the supersymmetric factor @xmath4 of the two - particle s - matrix is obtained by solving the supersymmetry condition , the yang - baxter and crossing equations , the unitarity , analyticity and minimality conditions .",
    "these equations depend on the conserved quantum numbers , so they impose restrictions on the choice of representations .",
    "further highly nontrivial restrictions come from the bootstrap and especially from the fusing equations for @xmath4 , which contain the fusing data of the non - supersymmetric model .",
    "let @xmath17 be a fusion process of the non - supersymmetric theory with fusing rapidity @xmath18 , and assume that the representations in which @xmath19 , @xmath20 , and @xmath21 transform are @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 ; in this case the fusing equation is equivalent to the statement that the supersymmetric two - particle s - matrix block at rapidity @xmath18 is an equivariant projection from the product of @xmath22 and @xmath23 on @xmath24 .",
    "this can be very restrictive for the value of @xmath25 , as in the most common case , for example , when @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 are boson / fermion representations @xcite .",
    "we remark that the fusing equation can be forced to hold in certain cases by factoring out unwanted states from the hilbert - space .",
    "the previous considerations indicate that it is nontrivial that the construction above can be applied to supersymmetrize a given factorized scattering theory .",
    "the knowledge of the lagrangian density or other data of the ( supersymmetric ) theory often suggests preferred susy representations for the particle multiplets .",
    "if the possible representations in which the particles can transform are fixed , then by solving the axioms above one can derive necessary and sufficient conditions that have to be satisfied by the particle spectrum and fusing rules of a non - supersymmetric theory which is supersymmetrized using these representations .",
    "these conditions have been obtained in the case when the possible representations are the kink and the boson / fermion representation , and several factorizable scattering theories the @xmath26 , @xmath27 @xmath28 and @xmath29 affine toda theories , the @xmath30 principal chiral model , the sine - gordon model , the supersymmetric @xmath31 sigma model @xcite , and the multicomponent yang - lee ( or fkm ) minimal models @xcite have been found to satisfy these conditions , i.e. these theories have been supersymmetrized by applying the construction described above .",
    "the lagrangian field theories underlying these supersymmetric scattering theories are not all known ( if they exist ) .    it is a natural step after the study of bulk factorized scattering theories to study them in the presence of a boundary .",
    "if the boundary conditions and interactions preserve integrability , then the bootstrap programme remains manageable .",
    "a set of boundary bound states are added to the bulk spectrum , and scattering processes involving boundary states are described by reflections amplitudes which can be written as products of one - particle reflection amplitudes and two - particle s - matrices .",
    "the boundary versions of the unitarity condition , crossing equation , yang - baxter , fusing , and bootstrap equations can be introduced @xcite .",
    "the ansatz above for constructing supersymmetric scattering theories can also be extended to the situation when an integrable boundary is present .",
    "a nontrivial problem of this extension that we discuss in this paper is the definition of the concept of supersymmetry in the presence of boundary .",
    "results in the classical lagrangian field theory framework @xcite indicate clearly that such a concept is possible .",
    "our construction is based on the results in @xcite and it can be regarded as an application of the construction described in @xcite for quantum group symmetry .",
    "let us assume that a factorizable scattering theory with boundary is given and the supersymmetric version of the bulk part of this theory is also constructed using the ansatz above , the bulk particles transforming either in the kink or in the boson / fermion representation .",
    "we study in this paper the problem of completing the supersymmetrization in this case using the boundary version of the ansatz above .",
    "the first step is to choose a representation of the boundary supersymmetry algebra for the ground state .",
    "next the minimal supersymmetric factors of the ground state one - particle reflection amplitudes are to be determined using the boundary yang - baxter , unitarity and crossing equations and the supersymmetry condition for these factors .",
    "finally the boundary bootstrap and fusing equations for supersymmetric factors can be used to obtain the representations in which the excited boundary bound states transform together with the supersymmetric factors of the one - particle reflection amplitudes on these states .",
    "we remark that if there were preferred representations for the excited boundary states , then the boundary fusing equation would constrain the boundary fusing angles . the first and especially the second steps",
    "have been considered in the literature @xcite , whereas there are fewer results concerning the last step @xcite .",
    "there are few known solutions to the boundary bootstrap programme for non - supersymmetric theories either .    for the ground state",
    "we take the singlet representations with rsos label @xmath32 , this being the simplest case and also because we expect @xcite that other cases can be obtained by boundary bootstrap from this one .",
    "the general minimal supersymmetric one - particle ground state reflection factors have been determined for this case in @xcite but without imposing the supersymmetry condition .",
    "this condition is imposed on the kink reflection amplitude in @xcite . in the present paper",
    "we consider the boson / fermion ground state reflection factors in some detail .",
    "we derive these reflection factors by imposing the supersymmetry condition and solving the boundary yang - baxter equation afterwards .    as the main result of the paper",
    "we determine the representations and supersymmetric one - particle reflection factors for excited boundary bound states using the bootstrap and fusing equations , for arbitrary boundary fusing rules .",
    "this is a nontrivial problem because the one - particle reflection amplitudes and so the fusing tensors can be degenerate at particular rapidities .",
    "although these rapidities are special , they usually play an essential role in boundary theories .",
    "we also present the conditions on the fusing angles resulting from the requirement of minimality .",
    "this requirement is nontrivial even if the ground state reflection factors are minimal , and restricts the boundary fusing angles .",
    "our work is motivated by the results of @xcite for bulk supersymmetric bootstrap , and by @xcite , where the scattering theory of the boundary sine - gordon model ( bsg ) is supersymmetrized . in the bsg theory",
    "the whole boundary spectrum can be generated by kinks , and in this case it is not difficult to determine the representations and supersymmetric reflection factors for the boundary states .",
    "however , there are other ways to generate the boundary states , and it is nontrivial though plausible that the same representations and reflection factors are obtained in each way .",
    "the correctness of this proposition for the bsg model was conjectured and partially verified in @xcite . using our results",
    "we can complete the verification and confirm that the proposition is correct .",
    "only few integrable boundary scattering theories are known explicitely . beyond the bsg model non - trivial scattering theories for boundary @xmath6 and @xmath7 affine toda field theories",
    "@xcite , for the free boson on the half line , and for the boundary sinh - gordon model @xcite are known .",
    "the bulk part of these theories can be supersymmetrized in the framework described above , so we apply our results to them .",
    "the layout of the paper is as follows . in section 2",
    "we review the formalism for supersymmetric factorized scattering theory in the bulk as described in @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "this review is not a mere copy of results as we found the thorough understanding of this formalism necessary for studying the boundary case .",
    "we hope that we make certain points clearer , and we also supply certain details ( concerning representation theory for instance ) that can not be found in @xcite .",
    "( the first part of section [ 4.3 ] is also relevant for the bulk formalism . ) in section 3 we discuss the boundary supersymmetry algebra and its action on the ground state and multi - particle states , the boundary version of the ansatz for supersymmetric scattering theory , and the supersymmetric one - particle ground state reflection factors for kinks and boson / fermion doublets .",
    "section 4 contains a description of the boundary supersymmetric bootstrap structure and fusing rules under the condition that the bulk particles transform in the kink and boson / fermion representations and the ground state is a singlet with rsos label @xmath32 .",
    "this section and especially subsection [ 4.3 ] contains the main results of the paper also mentioned above .",

    "we present our conclusions in section 6 .",

    "the description above is modified in this case as follows : it is not allowed to change the sign of all the rapidities @xmath587 in a set in the @xmath208 case .    in the @xmath209 case , if @xmath575 contains @xmath587 , then the state @xmath544 is equivalent to the state @xmath588 , where @xmath589 are the elements of @xmath575 ( they are not necessarily different ) , @xmath590 , and @xmath591 .",
    "it is allowed that @xmath592 for several integers @xmath593 .",

    "@xmath602 is a singlet state .",
    "the rules and statements of the present subsection are sufficient to determine the transformation and scattering properties of the boundary bound states in concretely given models without the use of the results described in [ sec 4.1.4 ] and [ sec 4.2 ] .",
    "further supersymmetric boundary theories may be obtained from known ones by projection , i.e. by factoring out certain boundary bound states .",
    "we do not discuss this possibility in detail .",
    "it is important to note that we have not taken into consideration the `` statistics '' of the various bulk particles at all , i.e. we have assumed `` free '' statistics .",
    "the correct statistical properties can be achieved by projection .",
    "an example of this can be found in section [ sec free part ] .",
    "let us consider now the situation that a boundary state in the non - supersymmetric theory can be created in more than one way , i.e. the states @xmath544 and @xmath547 are equivalent ( and so regarded to be the same ) in the non - supersymmetric theory .",
    "such an equivalence is usually established by transforming certain diagrams representing amplitudes into each other , where the allowed transformations include shifting lines using bootstrap and yang - baxter equations and splitting or fusing vertices .",
    "these transformations are similar to those done above , and we expect that they can usually be used to establish the equivalence of the corresponding supersymmetric states as well . therefore we expect that the supersymmetric states @xmath603 and @xmath604 corresponding to @xmath544 and @xmath547 are also equivalent , i.e. @xmath605 ( or @xmath606 ) . the equivalence of such states should be checked in specific models , but we expect that the requirement that such states should be equivalent is usually satisfied and does dot place constraints on the boundary fusing rules of the non - supersymmetric theory",
    ". the only really restrictive condition on the applicability of the ansatz described in the previous sections is thus ( [ feltetel 4 ] ) .",
    "the following statement illustrates the phenomenon also encountered in the bulk scattering theory @xcite that prescribing the representations in which the boundary states transform places very restrictive conditions on the boundary fusing rules .",
    "let @xmath45 be a supersymmetric particle with parameters @xmath607 ( where @xmath173 , @xmath175 ) .",
    "let the boundary state @xmath608 be generated by this particle in @xmath190 steps and assume that the ground state particle reflection factor is nondegenerate at @xmath609 , @xmath460 .",

    "the particle spectrum of the bulk sine - gordon theory ( sg ) contains a soliton ( @xmath612 ) and an antisoliton ( @xmath613 ) of mass @xmath101 and the breathers @xmath614 of mass @xmath615 , where @xmath616 , @xmath617 $ ] , @xmath618 and @xmath101 are parameters of the model .",
    "the breathers are self - conjugate , and the conjugate of @xmath612 is @xmath613 .",
    "the fusing rules ( given in the form process , ( fusing angle ) ) are the following : @xmath619 , @xmath620 ; @xmath621 , @xmath622 provided @xmath623 $ ] ; and the crossed versions of these rules .",
    "they are consistent with associating kink representations to @xmath612 and @xmath613 and particle or `` two - kink - state '' representations with @xmath146 to the breathers .",
    "the sets corresponding to the supersymmetric parts of @xmath612 , @xmath613 , and @xmath614 are @xmath624 , @xmath625 , @xmath626 .",

    "the fusing rules @xcite are listed in the following table :    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     using our rules we get    @xmath633    @xmath634 if @xmath635 ,    @xmath636    @xmath637 if @xmath638 ,    @xmath639 is similar to @xmath640 ,    @xmath641 ,    @xmath642    @xmath643 if @xmath644 , @xmath645 ,    the remaining two cases when @xmath646 , @xmath647 and @xmath648 are similar .",

    "condition ( [ feltetel 4 ] ) is satisfied in this case , so the supersymmetric factors of the reflection amplitudes have no poles on the imaginary axis in the physical strip .",
    "we considered the boundary supersymmetric bootstrap programme in the case when the ground state is a singlet with rsos label @xmath32 and the bulk particles transform in the kink and boson / fermion representations .",
    "we presented a review of the relevant analogous results for bulk bootstrap .",
    "we introduced the boundary supersymmetry algebra and its action in the framework proposed by @xcite , which requires that the boundary supersymmetry algebra has to be a coideal of the bulk susy algebra . in accordance with the literature",
    ", we found that there are two possible boundary supersymmetry algebras .",
    "the corresponding two cases denoted by @xmath208 and @xmath209 lead to different supersymmetric ground state reflection factors .",
    "we found that these factors are essentially the same as those given in @xcite .",
    "although the algebras of the @xmath208 and @xmath209 cases appear to play symmetric role , the corresponding kink reflection factors turn out to be significantly different .",
    "a further important difference between the two cases is that in the @xmath208 case the boson / fermion reflection factor can be obtained by bootstrap from the kink reflection factor only at special values of its parameters @xcite .",
    "we also found that the kink and boson / fermion reflection factors can be degenerate at particular rapidities depending on a parameter @xmath230 of the ground state representation .",
    "we presented supersymmetric boundary fusing rules by which the representations and reflection factors for excited boundary bound states can be easily determined in specific models .",
    "the main difficulty of the problem is to handle the degeneracies of the boundary fusing tensors that occur at particular rapidities ( resulting from the degeneracies of the one - particle reflection factors ) .",
    "these degeneracies are closely related to the degeneracies of the bulk two - particle scattering factors and of the ground state one - particle reflection factors .",
    "we found that the boundary fusing rules are analogous to the bulk rules @xcite , and that it is useful to characterize the boson / fermion multiplets by their constituent kinks .",
    "we considered the simplest case , when the two - particle scattering factors and ground state reflection factors are minimal and have no poles and overall zeroes on the imaginary axis in the physical strip , and there is no interplay between the poles and zeroes of the supersymmetric and non - supersymmetric factors of the s - matrix and reflection amplitude .",
    "we found that the main restriction on the applicability of the described construction follows from this condition and from the condition that the ground state is a singlet with rsos label @xmath32 ( whereas in the bulk the main restriction arises because the supersymmetry representations are prescribed ) .",
    "we applied our results to the boundary sine - gordon model @xcite , to the @xmath6 and @xmath7 affine toda field theories @xcite and to the free particle .",
    "we found that the boundary @xmath6 affine toda model admits a tensor product type supersymmetrization , whereas the minimal supersymmetrization of the @xmath7 model with first class boundary condition is not possible : the supersymmetric reflection factors on some excited boundary states introduce poles that can not be explained by coleman - thun mechanism .",
    "it is an open problem whether the supersymmetrized @xmath6 and @xmath7 reflection amplitudes describe any lagrangian field theory .",
    "we also considered the sinh - gordon model briefly .",
    "it is likely that representations beyond the kink and boson / fermion for the bulk particles and other ( possibly non - singlet ) ground state representations can also be relevant to some models .",
