    "in this paper , we consider the problem of designing incentive compatible auctions for multiple homogeneous units of a good . this problem has received significant attention in the non - bayesian setting starting with the work of goldberg _ et al",
    "_  @xcite .",
    "we focus on the scenario where bidders not only have a private valuation per unit of the good , but also a private budget , that is the total amount of money they are able to pay .",
    "the budget constraint is _ hard _ ; a bidder gets a utility of negative infinity if she has to pay a total price larger than her budget . in this model ,",
    "the natural problems to consider are maximizing social welfare and the auctioneer s revenue .",
    "both these aspects have been considered in previous work  @xcite in an adversarial setting .",
    "the key difficulty with budget constraints is that the utilities are no longer quasi - linear .",
    "this makes mechanisms such as vcg no longer applicable .",
    "based on the random partitioning framework of goldberg _ et al _",
    "@xcite , borgs _ et al _",
    "@xcite present a truthful auction whose revenue is asymptotically optimal compared to that of the optimal single - price mechanism . using the same framework , abrams  @xcite gives a different auction that improves this result for a range of parameters ( but is not asymptotically optimal ) .",
    "more recently , dobzinski _",
    "@xcite presented the _ adaptive clinching auction _ based on the clinching auction of ausubel  @xcite .",
    "this is an ascending price auction where each bidder maintains a demand , which is the amount of item she is willing to buy given the current price and her residual budget .",
    "initially , the demand is larger than supply . if the total demand of the remaining bidders is less than the supply of items , the bidder _ clinches _ the difference at the current price .",
    "the bidder drops out of the auction if the price exceeds her valuation , and the auction stops when the total demand falls below total supply .",
    "though the auction rules seem simple , it still defines a differential process for auctioning an infinitely divisible good with no closed form solution , except in special cases .",
    "it is not difficult to show that this auction is incentive compatible when the budget constraints are public knowledge .",
    "@xcite show that in the public budget setting , it is the _ only _ such auction that is pareto - optimal ( po ) , meaning that no pair of agents ( including the auctioneer ) can simultaneously improve their utilities by trading with each other .",
    "they further show that with public budgets , this auction has better revenue properties than the auctions in  @xcite and  @xcite : it improves the former by a factor of @xmath0 , and like the latter , is asymptotically optimal",
    ". however , their main result is negative : this auction is not truthful when the budgets are private knowledge , so that there is no pareto - optimal truthful auction in this case .    * our results . *",
    "the negative result in  @xcite holds for any auction with private budgets that needs to satisfy three properties ex - post : voluntary participation ( vp ) , incentive compatibility ( ic ) , and no positive transfers ( npt ) .",
    "these properties are standard , and defined in section  [ sec_intro ] .",
    "the main result in this paper is to show that there is indeed a pareto - optimal _ randomized _ mechanism with private budgets . here ,",
    "the prices and quantities are random variables ; the ( ic ) and ( vp ) properties are satisfied in _ expectation _ over these random variables ; and ( npt ) and ( po ) are satisfied ex - post .",
    "the key to showing this result is to develop a novel structural characterization of the adaptive clinching auction in the case of one infinitely divisible good .",
    "* budget monotonicity and randomization . *",
    "we show an intuitive property of the adaptive clinching auction in the case of divisible goods : a bidder can not gain utility by reporting budget lower than the truth .",
    "we term this property budget monotonicity . though this property seems simple",
    ", there is no reason to assume it holds : _ in fact , this property is false for the adaptive clinching auction in the case of indivisible units _ ( theorem  [ thm : eg]).the",
    "major difficulty in the proof is that the adaptive clinching auction continuously makes allocations at different prices , so that the utility is a complicated function of all the budgets and valuations . in fact",
    ", an analysis of this auction is left as an open question in  @xcite .",
    "we show this result by carefully coupling the behavior of two auctions that differ only in the reported budget of one bidder .",
    "the proof also establishes several structural results about this auction that are of independent interest .",
    "budget monotonicity for an infinitely divisible good implies pareto - optimality fairly directly , since all we need to prevent is a bidder over - reporting her budget .",
    "we can do this in several ways , the simplest being randomization .",
    "in the randomized extraction scheme ( see section  [ sec_intro ] ) , the mechanism simply extracts the whole budget or zero price so that the expected price extracted is equal to the price charged by the deterministic auction . therefore",
    ", if a bidder gets nonzero allocation by over - reporting her budget , then with non - zero probability , she pays her reported budget and her expected utility is @xmath2 .",
    "this scheme can be applied to any deterministic auction to prevent reporting larger budgets than the truth .",
    "we show in section  [ sec_intro ] that the randomized version preserves pareto - optimality ex - post , and maintains ( ic ) and ( vp ) in expectation if the deterministic auction was monotone ( and charges non - zero price for non - zero allocations ) .",
    "the monotonicity result for the adaptive clinching auction holds only for one infinitely divisible good . in the case of finitely many indivisible units",
    ", we simply run the adaptive clinching auction assuming one infinitely divisible good , and perform a randomized allocation in the end ( corollary  [ cor : manygoods ] ; also see  @xcite ) .",
    "the resulting auction is ( vp ) and ( ic ) in expectation , and is also pareto - optimal .",
    "though our mechanism is randomized , the randomness introduced in the price is quite small : _ it affects the price charged to only one bidder _ ( lemma  [ lem : onlyone ] ) .",
    "however , for the randomization to be ( ic ) , we crucially need the assumption that the utility of a bidder for paying more than her true budget is @xmath2 . for smoother utility functions ,",
    "the budget monotonicity property can be used in other ways to make the deterministic auction itself truthful and pareto - optimal : for instance , a standard assumption in spectrum auctions  @xcite is that the bidder can be forced to show  proof of funds \" for her reported budget ( for instance , a bank statement ) , and this prevents her from over - reporting her budget regardless of her utility function .    * revenue properties . * as another consequence of budget monotonicity , the improved revenue properties of the adaptive clinching auction over the auctions in  @xcite in the case of public budgets ( shown in  @xcite ) carry over to the randomized version of the auction even with private budgets , and hence , this auction improves the competitive ratio in  @xcite by a factor of @xmath0 , and like the auction in  @xcite , is asymptotically optimal .    * bayesian setting . * in this setting , the auctioneer maintains independent discrete distributions on the possible valuations and budgets for each bidder , and is interested in designing a poly - time computable mechanism for optimizing expected revenue ( resp .",
    "social welfare ) . in this",
    "setting , we allow the bidders to have a public size constraint on the amount of item they can buy in addition to a private valuation and private budget .    variants of this model have been considered before  @xcite , and the optimal solution can indeed be encoded as an ( exponential size ) linear program .",
    "the key challenge now becomes designing polynomial time computable mechanisms .",
    "it is well - known  @xcite that the optimal mechanism has a simple structure related to the vcg mechanism in the case of _ i.i.d .",
    "_ distributions and no size constraints .",
    "it is unlikely that such a structure holds in the general setting , and we instead consider designing approximately optimal mechanisms .",
    "the budget constraints however make a poly - time relaxation of the problem non - linear .",
    "however , if we only encode that utility decreases for under - reporting budgets , the program becomes linear ; we again use randomization to prevent over - reporting budgets . using this , we show a poly - size linear program relaxation with a rounding scheme that yields a @xmath1 approximation to the optimal bayesian ic mechanism when the type space is discrete ; this mechanism is implementable in dominant strategies .",
    "this rounding technique may be applicable in other related scenarios .",
    "* organization of the paper . * in section  [ sec_intro ]",
    ", we define the notions of truthfulness and budget monotonicity . in section  [ sec : clinch ] , we describe the adaptive clinching auction and show some basic properties in the infinitely divisible good case . in section  [ sec_proof ] ,",
    "we sketch the proof of budget monotonicity of this auction , which implies that the randomized version satisfies pareto - optimality with private budgets .",
    "the proof of this claim very technical , and is hence presented in its entirety in appendix  [ app : monotone ] . in section  [ app :",
    "size ] , we consider the bayesian setting and show an lp rounding scheme that achieves a @xmath1 approximation to the expected revenue ( resp . social welfare ) even when bidders have public size constraints .",
    "we will mainly consider the case when there is one unit of infinitely divisible good and @xmath3 bidders .",
    "bidder @xmath4 has a private valuation @xmath5 per unit quantity , and private budget @xmath6 .",
    "suppose bidder @xmath4 reports valuation and budget @xmath7 .",
    "the auction is a ( randomized ) mechanism that ( probabilistically ) maps the @xmath8 into a quantity @xmath9 the bidder obtains and a total price @xmath10 the bidder pays ; note that these quantities are allowed to be random variables in this paper .",
    "since there is one unit of the good , we have @xmath11 .",
    "the only difference in the case of auctioning @xmath12 indivisible copies of the good is that in this case , @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "( the infinitely divisible good case is the limit when @xmath15 . ) in the subsequent discussion we will assume one infinitely divisible good unless otherwise stated .    let @xmath16 denote the reported valuations and budgets of bidders other than @xmath4 .",

    "if @xmath18 , then his utility is @xmath19 .    the goal is to design a randomized auction that satisfies the following four properties .",
    "note that in the ( vp ) and ( ic ) conditions , the expectation is over the randomness introduced by the mechanism .",

    "pareto - optimality ( po ) : : :    we must have ( i ) @xmath25 , _",
    "i.e. _ , the good is    completely sold ; and ( ii ) if @xmath26 and    @xmath27 , then @xmath28 , _",
    "i.e. _ , if a bidder gets    non - zero quantity then all bidders with higher valuations have    exhausted their budgets .",
    "this property holds ex - post ( regardless of    randomization ) .    in the case of @xmath12 indivisible units ,",
    "the only difference is in the ( po ) condition .",
    "this gets modified as : @xmath14 ; further , if @xmath26 and @xmath29 , then @xmath30 . in both cases , this corresponds to the fact that no pair of agents can improve their utility by trading .",
    "the main focus of this paper is to understand the behavior of the adaptive clinching auction , which is described in section  [ sec : clinch ] . for a more detailed description ( especially for the indivisible units case )",
    ", please see dobzinski _ et al _",
    "their main result is the following :    [ thm : nisan ] the adaptive clinching auction satisfies ( vp ) , ( npt ) , and ( po ) with private budgets and valuations .",
    "when the budgets are public knowledge , the auction also satisfies ( ic ) , and it is the unique auction satisfying ( vp ) , ( npt ) , ( po ) , and ( ic ) ex - post .",
    "furthermore , there is no auction satisfying these four properties ex - post when the budgets are private .",
    "our main goal is to show several structural results about this auction , which will culminate in showing that there is indeed a _",
    "randomized _ mechanism that is ( vp ) and ( ic ) _ in expectation _ , and also satisfies ( npt ) and pareto - optimality ex - post ( regardless of the outcome of randomization ) , even with private budgets .",
    "we will show that the adaptive clincing auction with one infinitely divisible good satsifies budget monotonicity , which states that a bidder can not gain by reporting a lower budget .",
    "a deterministic auction is budget monotone if the following conditions hold for every bidder @xmath4 regardless of @xmath31 . for reported budget",
    "@xmath32 $ ] , where @xmath6 is the true budget :    1 .",
    "the bidder always maximizes utility by reporting @xmath20 , where @xmath5 is the true valuation .",
    "when @xmath20 , the utility of the bidder is _ monotonically non - decreasing _ in @xmath32 $ ] .",
    "the more interesting condition in the above definition is the second one ( the first one following from  @xcite ) .",
    "though budget monotonicity is an intuitive property , there is no guarantee that it is satisfied even by reasonable auctions .",
    "in fact , quite surprisingly , it does not always hold for the adaptive clinching auction !    [ thm : eg ] in the case of @xmath33 indivisible units of a good and @xmath34 bidders , the adaptive clinching auction described in  @xcite does not satisfy budget monotonicity .",
    "consider @xmath34 bidders with the following @xmath35 values : @xmath36 , @xmath37 , and @xmath38 , and suppose these are the true budgets and valuations .",
    "it is easy to show that bidders @xmath39 and @xmath40 clinch one unit each at price @xmath40 .",
    "bidder @xmath41 obtains zero utility since she can only clinch when price is @xmath41 .",
    "however , if bidder @xmath41 reports @xmath42 , she clinches one unit at price @xmath43 and obtains strictly positive utility .",
    "therefore , the auction is not monotone .",
    "the details are easy to fill in using the description in  @xcite .    in sharp contrast ,",
    "our main result is to show that the adaptive clinching auction indeed satisfies the budget monotonicity property when there is one infinitely divisible good ( which is the limiting case of @xmath12 indivisible goods ) . in particular ,",
    "our main theorem is the following :    [ thm : main ] the adaptive clinching auction satisfies budget monotonicity for one infinitely divisible good .",
    "the key intuitive difference between the divisible and indivisible cases is that in the former case , there is a nice characterization of bidders receiving non - zero allocations as those with highest remaining budgets ( refer lemma  [ lem : clinch ] ) .",
    "budget monotonicity is equivalent to saying that a bidder can not gain by under - reporting her budget , _",
    "i.e. _ , reporting @xmath44 .",
    "we now show a simple way to remove the incentive to report @xmath45 .",
    "* randomized extraction : * we run the deterministic adaptive clinching auction as in  @xcite .",
    "the allocation remains the same .",
    "however , the price extraction scheme is randomized as follows .",
    "if a bidder reports budget @xmath46 and is supposed to pay @xmath47 $ ] according to the deterministic mechanism , then with probability @xmath48 , we extract her reported budget @xmath46 , and with probability @xmath49 , we charge her _ zero _ price . note that this randomization can be applied to any deterministic auction where @xmath26 implies @xmath50 ; the adaptive clinching auction  @xcite does satisfy this property .",
    "it is now easy to show :    [ lem : up ] for the case of one infinitely divisible good , the randomized adaptive clinching auction satisfies ( npt ) always , ( vp ) and ( ic ) in expectation , and is pareto - optimal ex - post .",
    "clearly , ( npt ) is always satisfied .",
    "the expected payment after randomization is precisely @xmath10 , which preserves ( vp ) . to see ( po ) , observe that if @xmath28 before the randomization , the same is true after the randomization . to show ( ic ) , note that the auction satisfies budget monotonicity by theorem  [ thm : main ] , so that for any bidder @xmath4 , we have @xmath20 and @xmath51 .",
    "furthermore , if bidder @xmath4 reports a budget @xmath52 and recevies nonzero allocation , then the deterministic adaptive clinching auction charges her a price @xmath50 .",
    "the randomized auction extracts @xmath46 w.p .",
    "@xmath53 and in this scenario , the utility of the bidder is @xmath2 .",
    "therefore , the bidder will not report @xmath45 .",
    "if the allocations generated by the auction for the infinitely divisible case are treated as probabilities of allocation instead ( similar to  @xcite ) , the same auction works for the case of indivisible units of the good .",
    "[ cor : manygoods ] there is a randomized auction satisfying ( npt ) always , ( vp ) and ( ic ) in expectation , and is pareto - optimal ex - post for @xmath12 indivisible units of the good .",
    "run the randomized adaptive clinching auction assuming one infinitely divisible good , with the valuations scaled up by factor of @xmath12 .",
    "modify the allocation step as follows .",
    "suppose the auction should allocate @xmath54 $ ] to bidder @xmath4 .",
    "choose bidder @xmath4 with probability @xmath55 and allocate all @xmath12 units to this bidder .",
    "the resulting auction always satisfies ( npt ) .",
    "also note that the expected utility of a bidder is the same as the utility in the indivisible auction ; further , the auction is ( ic ) by theorem  [ lem : up ] . to show ( po ) , note that the items are completely allocated by the auction .",
    "next , since the infinitely divisible auction satisfies ( po ) , if the @xmath12 units are allocated to bidder @xmath4 , this bidder must have had @xmath26 in the infinitely divisible auction , so that for all @xmath56 with @xmath29 , we must have @xmath28 , so that @xmath57 .",
    "therefore , the auction satisfies ( po ) regardless of the outcome of randomization .",
    "we now describe the adaptive clinching auction in  @xcite in the context of one infinitely divisible good , and show in the next section that it satisfies budget monotonicity ( theorem  [ thm : main ] ) .",
    "intuitively , the auction is an ascending price auction . as the price per unit quantity",
    "is raised , bidders become inactive because the price has exceeded their valuation . for the remaining ( active ) bidders ,",
    "the _ demand _ is the amount they are willing to buy given their remaining budget and the current price .",
    "similarly , the _ supply _ is the amount of item remaining . for an active bidder , when the supply exceeds the total demand of the other bidders , this bidder _ clinches _ the difference at the current price .",
    "since the price is increased continuously and the good is infinitely divisible , the auction defines a differential process .",
    "we describe the clinching auction as a differential process indexed by time @xmath58 , where the price charged per unit quantity increases as time progresses , and the auction continuously allocates ( part of ) the item and extracts budget .",
    "we note that the traditional method is to describe it as a process indexed by the price ; however , indexing by time lends itself to an easier analysis . after describing the auction",

    "this statement is critically used in the next stage of our proof , where we compare the utilities gained by alice in the two auctions , and show that her utility from low is at most her utility from high .      since @xmath331 ,",

    "i.e. _ , alice joins the clinching set no later in high than in low .",
    "let bidder @xmath39 have the largest budget among all active bidders excluding alice at the time when auction low starts clinching .",
    "we first present a high - level idea of the proof . at any point in time , the set of clinching bidders , if non - empty , is the set of active bidders @xmath4 with @xmath118 ; furthermore , once the auction starts clinching , @xmath123 decreases continuously .",
    "we therefore relate the evolution of @xmath123 in the two auctions , and show the time @xmath58 at which @xmath333 in auction low is at least the time @xmath58 at which @xmath334 in auction high .",
    "we use the following observations about the curves @xmath200 and @xmath335 in auctions low and high respectively :    1 .",

    "auction high starts clinching at most @xmath336 time after low starts clinching , where @xmath337 .",

    "i.e _ , whether or not alice has the highest budget in auction high .",
    "we now present the proof in the following sequence of claims .",
    "as time @xmath58 increases gradually from @xmath346 , as long as no bidder is clinching in either auction ( _ i.e. _ , @xmath347 ) , the current budget @xmath63 of every active bidder @xmath4 equals her original budget @xmath46 .",
    "furthermore , step ( iii ) reduces the budgets of exiting bidders in a fixed order .",

    "if auction high stops at time @xmath301 because some bidder in @xmath420 drops out , then low will also stop at @xmath301 , a contradiction .",
    "thus , assume none of the bidders with valuation equal to @xmath324 is in the set @xmath420 .",
    "all those bidders will retain their initial budgets in both the auctions till time @xmath421 .",
    "therefore the _ excess - demand _ ( that is , @xmath422 ) will reduce by the same quantity in both the auctions at time @xmath423 .",
    "now , by the clinching invariant , the difference between the excess demands between auctions high and low at time @xmath421 is precisely @xmath424 , so that since @xmath425 , the excess - demand in low is less than that of high . since the excess demand in high becomes non - positive at @xmath426 ( stopping condition ) ,",
