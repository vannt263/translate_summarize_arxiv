    "analysis of recent cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) data suggests an approximately flat universe with the total energy density parameter @xmath7 almost surely lying in the range @xmath8.@xcite the near flatness of the observable universe does not preclude a multiconnected spatial topology , but may push the topology to a scale larger than the horizon radius , making it difficult or impossible to detect .",
    "recent studies have examined the extent to which a nontrivial topology may or may not be observable in a locally spherical universe@xcite or a locally hyperbolic one.@xcite in a locally flat universe there is no _ a priori _ relationship between the topology scale and the horizon scale , so a great deal of luck would be required for the two to coincide .    in their most recent study of multiconnected hyperbolic universes,@xcite gomero , rebouas , and",

    "et al._@xcite with @xmath9 , all seven would be potentially detectable .    a topology is considered potentially detectable by an observer at a point @xmath10 in the space if the observer s horizon radius for the absolute horizon at @xmath11 with little effect on the horizon radius . ]",
    "@xmath12 exceeds the injectivity radius in a multiconnected space , the _ injectivity radius _ at @xmath10 is defined to be the radius of the largest ball centered at @xmath10 whose interior does not overlap itself .",
    "equivalently , twice the injectivity radius is the length of the shortest topologically nontrivial path from @xmath10 to itself . ]",
    "@xmath13 at @xmath10 . in a 3-torus and in many spherical topologies ,",
    "the injectivity radius @xmath14 is constant throughout the whole space , so if the topology is potentially detectable by an observer at point @xmath10 , it is detectable by any other observer at any other point @xmath15 in the same space . in hyperbolic topologies , by contrast , the injectivity radius varies from point to point , so a hyperbolic topology might be detectable by an observer at point @xmath10 ( where the injectivity radius @xmath13 is small ) , but undetectable by a different observer at some other point @xmath15 ( where the injectivity radius @xmath16 is large ) .    in their most recent work,@xcite gomero , rebouas , and tavakol",
    "consider the question of detectability from the most favorable point in the space , that is , from a point of minimal injectivity radius .",
    "the present article extends their work by considering the detectability of the topology at arbitrary locations in the space .",
    "the variation of the injectivity radius across the space will be summarized in an _ injectivity profile _ showing what fraction of the space s volume has a given injectivity radius . combining the injectivity profile ( section  [ sectioninjectivityprofiles ] ) with an estimate for the horizon radius ( section  [ sectionhorizonradius ] ) reveals the probability that a randomly placed observer could potentially detect the topology ,",
    "that is , it tells the fraction of the manifold s volume in which @xmath17 ( section  [ sectionresults ] ) .",
    "an _ injectivity profile _ is a histogram showing how much of a manifold s volume has a given injectivity radius .",
    "for example , in the simple histogram in fig .",
    "1 the first bar shows that the injectivity radius lies in the range [ 0.2 , 0.3 ] for 10% of the manifold s volume ; the second bar shows that the injectivity radius lies in the range [ 0.3 , 0.4 ] for 20% of the manifold s volume ; and so on . in the studies presented below",
    ", each histogram will have 240 bins of width 0.0025 , spanning the range of injectivity radii from 0 to 0.6 . in the limit , as the bin width goes to zero , the assignment of a finite volume percentage @xmath18 to each bin of finite width @xmath19 is replaced by a limiting density distribution @xmath20 as shown in fig .  2 .",
    "the density distribution s discontinuities reflect a preferred set of short closed geodesics and may be the subject of a future paper , but nevertheless hold no importance for the present study .      to construct an injectivity profile , begin with a fundamental domain for the manifold .",
    "the present study used a dirichlet domain computed by the computer program snappea.@xcite snappea presents the dirichlet domain in the klein model of hyperbolic space , where it looks just like an ordinary euclidean polyhedron . cover the klein model with a grid of points .",
    "the grid is rectangular relative to the euclidean geometry of the model , although of course it s nonrectangular relative to the intrinsic hyperbolic geometry .",
    "the present study used a @xmath21 grid .",
    "the program scanned the grid , first rejecting grid points lying on or beyond the sphere - at - infinity in the klein model , and then rejecting points lying outside the dirichlet domain .",
    "for each grid point lying within the dirichlet domain , the program computed the injectivity radius at that point ( subsection  [ subsectioninjectivityradius ] ) to determine the correct bin in the histogram , then computed the true hyperbolic volume of the surrounding grid cell ( subsection  [ subsectiongridcellvolume ] ) and added that volume to the correct bin . after all grid points were processed , the program printed the volume in each bin to a file .      at first glance ,",
    "computing the injectivity radius at a point @xmath10 is trivially easy : just apply elements @xmath22 of the holonomy group @xmath23 to @xmath10 and see what the minimum translation distance @xmath24 is .",
    "is also known as the group of covering transformations .",
    "we follow the convention of saying _ holonomy group _ when thinking of @xmath23 geometrically as a group of isometries , but saying _ group of covering transformations _ when thinking of @xmath23 topologically as a group of homeomorphisms . ]",
    "the injectivity radius will be half that minimum : @xmath25 .",
    "the only problem is that @xmath23 is an infinite group , so we must decide ahead of time how many elements  and which elements  of @xmath23 to apply .",
    "our selection criterion for choosing a finite subset of @xmath23 depends on the concept of an isometry @xmath22 s _ basepoint translation distance _ , defined to be the distance @xmath26 that @xmath22 translates the origin @xmath27 .",
    "say we want to find all @xmath28 that translate a given point @xmath10 a distance at most @xmath29 .",
    "any such isometry @xmath22 has basepoint translation distance @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the outradius of the dirichlet domain @xmath32 . in other words ,",
    "if we consider all isometries @xmath22 with basepoint translation distance at most @xmath33 , we are sure to find all translates of @xmath10 closer than the distance @xmath29 .",
    "how large must @xmath29 be ?",
    "a simple argument be the face pairing isometry taking one of the dirichlet domain s faces closest to the origin @xmath27 to its mate . because the chosen face is maximally close to the origin , @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is the inradius of the dirichlet domain @xmath32 .",
    "thus for any point @xmath10 in the dirichlet domain , @xmath36 . ] shows that every point @xmath10 has a translate @xmath37 lying at a distance less than @xmath38 .",
    "so if we were to choose @xmath29 in the preceding paragraph to be @xmath38 , we would be guaranteed to find the nearest translate of every point @xmath10 , and would therefore know the injectivity radius @xmath13 .",
    "this method , while rigorous , is inefficient : the number of isometries @xmath22 with basepoint translation distance at most @xmath29 grows exponentially in @xmath29 , and the majority of those isometries are unneeded .",
    "a more efficient algorithm is simply to guess a plausible value of @xmath29 , find all isometries @xmath22 with basepoint translation distance at most @xmath33 , and verify afterwards that for each point @xmath10 we found a translate @xmath37 at a distance @xmath24 less than @xmath29 .",
    "there is no guarantee that such a translate will always be found , but if one is found then we rigorously know the minimum value of @xmath24 and hence the injectivity radius @xmath39 . in the present",
    "study a value of @xmath40 worked in all cases .",
    "given a dirichlet domain @xmath32 and its face pairings , how do we find all isometries @xmath28 with basepoint translation distance @xmath41 at most @xmath29 ?",
    "a simple recursion does the job : start with the the original dirichlet domain @xmath32 ; add its immediate neighbors in the universal covering space , which we think of as the translates @xmath42 for each of @xmath32 s face pairing isometries @xmath22 ; then add the neighbors neighbors , which correspond to products @xmath43 of pairs of face pairing isometries ; and so on .",
    "continue recursively , keeping those images @xmath42 with @xmath44 and discarding those with @xmath45 .",
    "proposition 3.1 of @xcite shows that this algorithm finds all isometries with @xmath46 ; that is , we need nt worry that the recursion will terminate when it encounters only unwanted translates with @xmath47 , while some wanted translate with @xmath44 remains hidden beyond them",
    ".      inscribe the klein model of hyperbolic space in a cube with corners at @xmath48 , and cover the cube with a @xmath49 grid .",
    "each grid cell is then a small cube of side length @xmath50 and euclidean volume @xmath51 .",
    "the hyperbolic volume represented by each grid cell differs from the apparent euclidean volume , and varies from cell to cell .",
    "it s easy to compute the ratio of the true hyperbolic volume to the apparent euclidean volume .",
    "the grid cells are small enough that the volume ratio does nt vary much within a given cell , so pick any point @xmath52 within the cell , and let @xmath53 be its distance from the origin . by symmetry",
    "the volume ratio depends only on @xmath54 , not on the particular point @xmath52 .",
    "so take a spherical shell of radius @xmath54 and thickness @xmath55 , and compare its true hyperbolic volume to its apparent euclidean volume .",
    "the apparent euclidean volume is @xmath56 to compute the shell s true hyperbolic volume , project from the klein model onto the hyperboloid model of hyperbolic space ( fig .",
    "similar triangles show that the hyperbolic radius @xmath57 has @xmath58 and @xmath59 .",
    "thus the area of the sphere is @xmath60 . to find its thickness , note that @xmath61 so @xmath62 .",
    "hence the hyperbolic volume of the spherical shell is @xmath63 and the required ratio is @xmath64",
    "the variable @xmath12 represents the horizon radius _ in comoving coordinates _ , that is , in units of the curvature radius of the ambient hyperbolic space . in a standard friedmann - lematre model with matter density today @xmath1 and cosmological constant @xmath2",
    ", one may compute @xmath12 by integrating the path of a photon backwards from @xmath65 to @xmath11 , obtaining @xmath66 replacing the upper limit of @xmath67 with the redshift @xmath68 of last scatter would have little effect on the result .    for comparison with gomero _",
    "et al._,@xcite the remainder of the present article will consider two sets of plausible choices for the density parameters :    @xmath69 and @xmath70 , for which @xmath71 and @xmath72 , and    @xmath69 and @xmath73 , for which @xmath74 and @xmath75 .",
    "a computer program , written in the c programming language and freely available from ftp://ftp.northnet.org/weeks/nearlyflathyperbolic , computes injectivity profiles using the algorithm outlined in subsection  [ subsectioninjectivityprofilecomputation ] along with the details explained in subsections  [ subsectioninjectivityradius ] and [ subsectiongridcellvolume ] .",
    "for the first ten low - volume hyperbolic manifolds from the hodgson - weeks census,@xcite which include the seven manifolds considered by gomero _",
    "et al._,@xcite the program obtains the injectivity profiles shown in fig .",
    "shaded backgrounds mark the cutoffs @xmath72 and @xmath76 , corresponding to @xmath71 and @xmath74 , respectively . only in the fraction of the manifold to left of each cutoff",
    "would the topology be detectable .",
    "table  1 summarizes the results .",
    "the manifolds in table  1 contain no closed geodesics shorter than 0.36 .",
    "however , there exist families of hyperbolic 3-manifolds containing arbitrarily short closed geodesics .",
    "the manifolds within each family approach a limiting _ cusped manifold _ which is , in effect , a manifold with a geodesic of length zero .",
    "furthermore , the injectivity profiles of the manifolds in each family approach the injectivity profile of the limiting cusped manifold .",
    "5 shows the injectivity profiles for the two smallest limiting cusped manifolds , _",
    "m003 _ and _ m004 _ , while table  2 shows the fraction of each in which an observer could potentially detect the topology .",
    "note that for @xmath77 close to one , the fraction of the manifold in which the topology is detectable is roughly proportional to @xmath78 .",
    "the dirichlet domains for these cusped manifolds have infinite outradius , so in the algorithm of subsection  [ subsectioninjectivityradius ] we considered all isometries of basepoint translation distance less than the plausible but arbitrary value of 2.5 ; thus these results for cusped manifolds are not rigorous , but they are most likely correct nonetheless .",
    "the beginning of each profile is noisy because at most a few grid points fall into each bin ; refining the grid diminishes this effect at the expense of a slower computation .",
    "in the case @xmath71 , the horizon radius @xmath79 is large enough that an observer at a random location in a small hyperbolic universe would have a reasonable chance of detecting the topology .",
    "however , in the case @xmath80 , the horizon radius @xmath12 drops to @xmath81 and a random observer would have little or no chance of detecting the topology .",
    "there exist closed hyperbolic 3-manifolds with arbitrarily short closed geodesics , so no matter how close @xmath77 is to one , there will always be infinitely many hyperbolic manifolds in which well - placed observers could detect the topology .",
    "however , the probability that an observer could detect the topology from a random point in such a manifold decreases in proportion to @xmath82 .",
