    "with widespread use of portable devices such as smart phones and tablets , cellular networks are facing an exponential growth of mobile data traffic @xcite .",
    "meanwhile , real - time applications such as video chat and online gaming become more and more popular , which imposes stringent delay requirements on the network . to deal with this ever - growing demand and high service requirement , micro base stations ( bss ) such as pico and femto bss",
    "are deployed to undertake the traffic pressure of macro bss .",
    "the network architecture is thus evolving to more dense and irregular heterogeneous networks ( hetnets ) @xcite .",
    "among all the techniques used in hetnets , load balancing plays a key role to determine the network performance .",
    "for example , if the traditional maximum downlink received power association scheme is adopted , users would tend to connect to macro bss with a high transmission power .",
    "macro bss may thus easily become overloaded . to purposely push users to micro bss ,",
    "a simple and efficient approach called the biased association scheme was proposed in @xcite , with which each user assigns a biased value to the measured received power from bss of each tier , and associates with the bs that has the largest mean biased received power .",
    "et al . _ demonstrated in @xcite that the user s long - term rate can be greatly improved by carefully tuning the biasing factor . with fixed locations of bss and users , no tractable expression of a performance metric such as the signal - to - interference - plus - noise ratio ( sinr ) or rate coverage can be derived , and the optimal biasing factor could only be found empirically .",
    "stochastic geometry was then adopted in @xcite to characterize the spatial distributions of bss and users , and to quantify the average performance metric of the network .",
    "for example , a poisson point process ( ppp ) was adopted in @xcite to represent the irregular deployment of the bss . the optimal biasing factor for bss of each tier",
    "was obtained therein to maximize the rate coverage . with a similar ppp model ,",
    "the biasing factor was optimized in @xcite by maximizing the logarithm of the mean user rate .",
    "previous studies @xcite assumed that the bss always have packets to transmit , which presents a worst case for the sinr and rate coverage . in practice",
    ", the bs load could vary significantly over a day .",
    "in particular , the amount of user service requests can drop dramatically during non - peak traffic hours .",
    "the bss are thus more likely to be idle during such periods , but still consume energy @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , due to a high deployment density , one micro bs would cover a small area .",
    "the void cell problem @xcite then emerges , where some micro bss do nt have any associated users .",
    "such bs thus solely acts as an interfering source . to improve energy efficiency and reduce the interference ,",
    "the techniques to selectively switch off a fraction of bss according to the traffic load have attracted extensive attention @xcite .",
    "for example , the authors in @xcite proposed a distributed on / off switching based algorithm in cellular networks to decide the minimum set of active bss . by arguing that a cellular bs could operate in normal mode , sleep mode , or expansion mode , guo _ et al . _",
    "@xcite proposed a scheme that determines which mode the bs should choose based on the load condition , such that the energy consumption is minimized .",
    "@xcite adopted a thinned - ppp model by assigning an active probability to bss of each tier and thus characterized the network signal - to - interference ratio ( sir ) coverage . with the same model , cao _ et al . _",
    "@xcite derived the optimal bs density of each tier to minimize the network energy consumption under a certain rate constraint .",
    "the aforementioned studies @xcite focused on the traffic load variance over a large time scale , i.e. , peak and non - peak hours , and did not consider queuing in each bs .",
    "most of them aimed to improve the network energy efficiency .",
    "one bs , nevertheless , can vary between busy and idle states over a small time scale due to the dynamic packet arrivals of its associated users , in which case the packet delay could be taken into account . in practice , with the proliferation of real - time multimedia applications , the packet delay is becoming an important quality - of - service ( qos ) metric .",
    "for example , an end - to - end latency over 250 ms for real - time multimedia is generally considered to be unacceptable @xcite . in the literature",
    ", there has been limited studies on the queuing analysis .",
    "the queuing performance of a single cell was evaluated in @xcite and @xcite in cdma systems for the first time , based on which the packet blocking probability and the packet queuing delay were characterized .",
    "these studies focused on only one independent queue by assuming constant interference over the entire cell . in hetnets , nevertheless , bss of various types are deployed with higher densities , and the queuing behavior of one bs is closely related with others , leading to the coupled - queue problem @xcite .",
    "specifically , whether a bs transmits or not will affect the interference level experienced by other bss that occupy the same spectrum resources , and will consequently determine the service rates of these co - channel bss .",
    "the service rate in turn affects the chance that one bs has packets to transmit or not .",
    "the analysis of coupled queues is a long - standing open problem , and even solving a special case of two interacting queues is challenging @xcite .",
    "@xcite modeled multiple interacting queues as a continuous - time markov chain ( ctmc ) with fixed bs locations in the network . by minimizing the average packet queuing delay ,",
    "the optimal spectrum allocation pattern was obtained for each bs .",
    "similarly , cheng _",
    "@xcite optimized the average queuing delay of network subjected to the bs power constraints .",
    "they formulated a markov decision process ( mdp ) problem based on the instantaneous channel state information and queue state information , and proposed an adaptive user scheduling and power control policy .",
    "however , the state space of the markov process may become huge as the network scales up , and the analysis would become intractable . hence , this motivates us to deal with the coupled queue problem with the tool of stochastic geometry to account for the random bs deployment , and derive the mean performance metrics analytically such that some insights can be gained for system design .      in this paper",
    ", we consider a @xmath0-tier hetnet where users and bss of all tiers are randomly distributed , i.e. , follow a ppp distribution .",
    "similar to previous studies @xcite , it is assumed that each user adopts a biased association scheme to choose one bs with the maximum biased received power .",
    "in contrast to previous studies @xcite , we consider that the packet requests from the users form a queue in their associated bss .",
    "the traffic intensity of one bs thus varies with the aggregate packet requests of all its associated users . to simplify the analysis , frequency partitioning across tiers",
    "is assumed in this paper .",
    "although the queues of bss from different tiers are not correlated , the queuing performance of one bs would affect the experienced interference of other co - channel bss in the same tier . to decouple the queuing behavior of bss in the same tier , we resort to the approximation of replacing each bs s individual traffic intensity with the average traffic intensity of its tier .",
    "the spatial distribution of bss in the busy state can thus be approximately characterized by a thinned - ppp model @xcite .",
    "the sir coverage of each tier is then obtained , based on which an explicit expression of the average traffic intensity of each tier is further derived , and is shown to be an increasing function of the biasing factor of each tier .    in order to find the delay limit that the network can achieve ,",
    "an optimization problem is formulated to minimize a lower bound of the network mean queuing delay by optimizing over the biasing factor of each tier based on the derived average traffic intensity .",
    "it is shown that the optimization problem is convex , and the optimal biasing factor can be numerically obtained .",
    "when the mean packet arrival rate of each user is small , an explicit expression of the optimal biasing factor of each tier is obtained . with equal bandwidth allocation across tiers",
    ", it is further shown that each user should associate with its nearest bs .",
    "a case study of a 2-tier hetnet shows that the optimal biasing factor is sensitive to the bandwidth allocation of each tier . to characterize the network capacity to support non - real - time services ,",
    "the network sir coverage is further derived .",
    "the contributions of this paper are summarized as follows .    * by assuming queuing in each bs , an explicit expression of the average traffic intensity of each tier is derived , which is shown to be an increasing function of the biasing factor of each tier . *",
    "an optimization problem of a lower bound of the network mean queuing delay is formulated , and is shown to be convex with respect to the biasing factor of each tier .",
    "when the mean packet arrival rate of each user is small , an explicit solution is obtained .",
    "* simulation results of a 2-tier case demonstrate that the network mean queuing delay can be significantly reduced by properly tuning the biasing factor of each tier . in the meanwhile , a tradeoff is revealed between the network mean queuing delay and the network sir coverage , which indicates that the service provider should strike a balance between the performance of real - time and non - real - time services .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows .",
    "the system model is presented in section [ ii ] .",
    "an optimization problem to minimize a lower bound of the network mean queuing delay is formulated and studied in section [ iii ] . a case study of a 2-tier hetnet",

    "consider a @xmath0-tier heterogeneous network where bss in the @xmath1th tier form an independent ppp @xmath2 with an intensity of @xmath3 , @xmath4 .",
    "users , on the other hand , form another independent homogeneous ppp @xmath5 with an intensity of @xmath6 over the whole network .",
    "frequency partitioning across tiers is assumed in this paper . in particular , bss of the same tier",
    "share the spectrum with a bandwidth of @xmath7 , @xmath4 , and bss of different tiers occupy non - overlapping frequency bands .",
    "therefore , for each user in the downlink , the associated bs acts as a desired signal transmitter , and other bss of the same tier are interfering sources .",

    ", assume that its packet requests follow an independent poisson process with a mean arrival rate @xmath19 , and the packet length is exponentially distributed with mean @xmath20 .",
    "the incoming packets for all users form a queue in the associated bs , and the bs will transmit these packets in a first - in - first - serve ( fifs ) fashion . to avoid users in poor channel conditions occupying the bs , we consider a fixed rate modulation and coding format . in particular , a bs will serve a user only when its instantaneous sir exceeds a threshold @xmath21 , and will drop its packet request otherwise .",
    "note that due to a high bs deployment intensity , the background noise is dominated by the interference , and is therefore ignored in this paper . according to shannon s formula , the service rate for each user that is associated to a tier-@xmath1 bs can be obtained as @xmath22 for a randomly selected tier-@xmath1 bs , @xmath23 , its traffic intensity , @xmath24 , can be obtained as @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the mean aggregate packet arrival rate of all its associated users .",
