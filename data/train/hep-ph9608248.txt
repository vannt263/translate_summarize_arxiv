    "@xcite to define a reduced nuclear form factor by removing the nucleon compositeness , @xmath13 the argument for each of the nucleon form factors , @xmath14 , is @xmath15 since , in the limit of zero binding energy , each nucleon must change its momentum from @xmath16 to @xmath17 .    for the reduced form factor of the deuteron one finds the asymptotic scaling behavior @xcite @xmath18 which can be compared with the available data in the large @xmath0 region , although this prediction is only for asymptotic momentum transfer .",

    "brodsky and ji @xcite suggested a simple covariant model to incorporate the quark structure of the nucleon .",
    "the hard kernel at large @xmath0 was assumed to be the perturbative amplitude for the six quarks to scatter from collinear to the initial two - nucleon configuration to collinear to the final two - nucleon configuration , where each nucleon has roughly equal momentum .",

    "equation  ( [ fd ] ) shows that the reduced form factor @xmath19 is determined by the body distribution amplitude @xmath42 and the kernel which can be obtained from the quark - interchange plus one - gluon - exchange diagrams between two nucleons . to represent these diagrams ,",

    "the picture of this model is described by eq .",
    "( [ fd ] ) , which implies that the formulation is similar to that of meson form factor and @xmath71 can be computed in the one - boson exchange approximation , replacing the gluon by a massive vector boson and coupling constant @xmath72 by effective coupling constant @xmath73 .",
    "we suggest that the effective mass @xmath70 can be determined by the empirical scaling law @xcite : @xmath74 with @xmath75 gev@xmath1 .",
    "the hard scattering amplitude can be obtained by calculating the diagrams shown in fig .  2 : @xmath76 where m is the deuteron mass , and we have taken the nucleon mass to be half of m. the kinematic factor d is @xmath77",

    "( [ fd ] ) , numerical analysis can be done with several parameters , @xmath78 , @xmath70 and @xmath79 , in the expression . from the empirical scaling law",
    ", @xmath70 is around 0.5 gev . instead of inputting the parameter @xmath80 , we normalize the amplitude at @xmath81 gev@xmath1 data point .",
    "the variation of the reduced form factor @xmath82 vs @xmath0 , with different values of @xmath70 , is displayed in fig .",
    "the effective coupling constant @xmath83 increases as @xmath70 become larger . by varying the parameter @xmath78 in the wave function we can get different behaviors of @xmath82 in the intermediate energy region , @xmath84 gev@xmath1 .",
    "the corresponding effective coupling constant , which decreases as @xmath78 become larger , is shown in fig .",
    "it is shown from fitting the data that @xmath85 gev , @xmath86 gev and @xmath87 .",
    "the result , comparing with the calculations with the paris potential and the experimental data @xcite , is shown in fig .  1 .",
    "our results reveal that our model with the above parameters can explain the deuteron form factor well for @xmath84 gev@xmath1 .",
    "the scaling law of the reduced from factor suggest @xcite that the dominance of @xmath59 begins at @xmath88 gev@xmath1",
    ". thus one can calculate @xmath59 to predict the reduced form factor in the intermediate energy region .    however , it is a very complicated problem to directly calculate @xmath59 , since there are over 300,000 diagrams and the evolution of the deuteron wave function leads to the dominance of hidden - color state contributions in the very large @xmath0 region due to the gluon exchange in the kernel .",
    "in fact , farrar , huleihel and zhang @xcite found that hidden - color degrees of freedom in the deuteron wave function might be important in order to fit the data . in this paper",
    "we have tried to build a model to calculate the reduced form factor in the intermediate energy region , instead of doing a full qcd analysis .",
    "the point of this model is that the reduced form factor @xmath19 can be evaluated in a way similar to the meson form factor .",
    "it is determined by the body wave function @xmath89 and a kernel with a massive boson exchange .",
    "our results show that our prediction can fit the data well for @xmath90 gev@xmath1 . to fit the data we have chosen : ( i ) the effective gluon mass @xmath91 gev , which is consistent with the empirical law , ( ii ) the parameter in the deuteron wave function @xmath92 gev , and ( iii ) the normalization at @xmath81 gev@xmath1 data point , which corresponds to an effective coupling constant @xmath93 .",
    "in addition , we restrict ourselves to calculate the reduced form factor only in the intermediate energy region",
    ". one ca nt expect that @xmath59 dominates the helicity amplitude in the low @xmath0 region , say , @xmath94 gev@xmath1 . on the other hand this picture ca nt apply to the form factor at very large @xmath0 since the hidden - color state contributions may be important in that region , where the full evolution of the six - quark wave function is involved",
    ".    this model could be improved by taking into account the contributions of @xmath66 and @xmath67 in the low @xmath0 region and the hidden - color contributions in the very large @xmath0 region .",
    "we believe this model can be generalized to other light nuclei .",
