    "the longer dissolution times _ l - rg18 _ and _ m - rg18 _ plotted in fig .  [ fig : tdissol ] show that , as the initial degree of mass segregation decreases , so does the disruptive effect of the early mass loss due to sn ejecta .",
    "the long - lived globular clusters we observe today might have had very low degrees of initial mass segregation which allowed them to survive .",
    "alternatively , a cluster with a higher degree of initial mass segregation can survive if its initial size is significantly smaller than its tidal radius . in this case , most cluster stars remain within the tidal boundary during the early expansion , and the number of stars lost during this phase is smaller .    to illustrate this point ,",
    "we have repeated the _ s - rg18 _ and _ u - rg18 _ runs , but setting the ratio of the initial cluster size , @xmath21 , to the tidal radius @xmath22 equal to 0.75 ( _ s - rg18r075 _ and _ u - rg18r075 _ ) and 0.5 ( _ s - rg18r05 _ and _ u - rg18r05 _ ) . the dissolution times for these systems are plotted in fig .",

    "in particular , the lifetimes of _ s - rg18r05 _ and _ u - rg18r05 _ are very similar , as the early mass loss disruptive effects for the initially mass - segregated system are strongly suppressed by the fact that the cluster is expanding well within its tidal radius and not immediately losing stars as it expands . since the system is initially denser and",
    "has a shorter dynamical time , the amount of impulsive mass loss is smaller than for the tidally truncated system ; this effect also contributes , although to a lesser extent , to the extension of the cluster lifetime .    the evolution of the 10 , 25 , 50 , 75 , 90 percent lagrangian radii for _ s - rg18r05 _ and _ u - rg18r05 _ are shown in fig .",

    "[ fig : lagrrg18r05 ] clearly shows important differences in the structural evolution of the two clusters : the mass - segregated cluster undergoes a stronger initial expansion which , although it does not lead to its prompt dissolution , significantly delays the cluster core collapse and keeps the cluster concentration lower than that of the unsegregated cluster .",
    "this is further illustrated by fig .",
    "[ fig : conc ] which shows the time evolution of the cluster concentration as measured by the ratio of the core and half - mass radii , @xmath44 , for _ s - rg18r05 _ and _ u - rg18r05_.      an important issue related to a cluster mass loss is the evolution of the stellar mf . it has been shown in a number of investigations of initially unsegregated clusters ( see e.g. vesperini & heggie 1997 , baumgardt & makino 2003 ) that mass loss due to two - body relaxation leads to the preferential escape of low - mass stars and to the flattening of the stellar mf .    in particular , for long - lived clusters losing mass due to two - body relaxation the extent of the flattening of the slope of the stellar mf is strictly correlated to the fraction of the initial cluster mass left ( see e.g.  fig .  16 in vesperini & heggie 1997 and eq .  14 in baumgardt & makino 2003 ) .    for long - lived initially unsegregated clusters , the dynamical mass loss timescale is closely related to the two - body relaxation timescale and is , in general , much longer than the stellar evolution timescale of the most massive stars . in this case",
    ", the range of stellar masses involved in segregation and evaporation processes after a few billion years includes the most massive dark remnants ( 1.2 - 1.4 @xmath23 ) , the more numerous white dwarfs , and the remaining main sequence stars ( @xmath45 ) .",
    "the most massive main sequence stars usually included in the calculation of the slope of the mass function fall in the high - mass end of this range , and hence tend to sink to the cluster center , while low - mass main sequence stars ( e.g. @xmath46 ) preferentially escape from the cluster , flattening the mf .    for an initially mass - segregated cluster ,",

    "[ fig : radmass ] shows that the initial degree of segregation for stars with masses in the range @xmath48 ( hereafter we focus on the evolution of the mf of main sequence stars with initial masses in this range ) is negligible and similar in clusters with and without primordial segregation .",

    "[ fig : radmass ] clearly illustrates the differences with the initial segregation profile of a cluster with primordial segregation .",
    "this is an important point in understanding the implications of primordial mass segregation for the evolution of the mf .",
    "as the results presented in the previous sections show , the fate of initially mass - segregated clusters and the processes driving their dissolution depend on the degree of initial mass segregation and on a cluster s initial size relative to its tidal radius .",
    "hereafter we focus on the _ s - rg18 _ , _ s - rg18r05 _ , _ u - rg18 _ , _ u - rg18r05 _ runs , to explore the difference between the mf evolution in systems with and without primordial mass segregation .",

    "as the system quickly loses mass , the mf slope also rapidly flattens ; the evolution , mass loss , and mf flattening occur on a much longer timescale for the unsegregated system .",
    "+    the lower panel in fig.[fig : alpha ] shows the mf slope versus the fraction of the initial mass left in the cluster , clearly illustrating an important difference between mass - segregated and unsegregated clusters : for a given amount of mass loss , the degree of mf flattening is significantly larger for the initially unsegregated cluster .",
    "this is due to the differences in the range spanned by stellar masses during the cluster evolution . for the slowly evolving initially unsegregated cluster , the narrower range of star masses present in the cluster during much of its evolution results in greater preferential loss of stars at the low - mass end of the range @xmath48 , while stars at the high - mass end of this range sink to the cluster center",
    "this is not the case for the initially mass - segregated system , in which rapid dissolution ensures that stars much more massive than @xmath51 are present during most of the evolution , preventing the development of strong differences in the mass loss rate and the spatial segregation of stars with masses in the range @xmath48 .    the time evolution of @xmath50 and the dependence of @xmath50 on the fraction of mass remaining in the cluster for the long - lived _ s - rg18r05 _ and _ u - rg18r05 _ systems are also shown in fig .

    "[ fig : radmass ] clearly show that the degree of mass segregation for stars with masses in the range @xmath48 is very similar in these two systems .",
    "if a mass - segregated cluster survives its early expansion , as in the case of _ s - rg18r05 _ , it will enter the evolutionary phase driven by two - body relaxation ( after the most massive stars have evolved off the main sequence ) with a segregation profile similar to that of an initially unsegregated cluster ( see the mass segregation profiles of _ s - rg18r05 _ and _ u - rg18r05 _ at @xmath52 gyr in fig.[fig : radmass ] ) , and the mfs of both systems will evolve similarly .    for clusters initially underfilling their roche lobes ,",
    "our simulations show that a given amount of mass loss leads to a stronger mf flattening than for tidally truncated unsegregated clusters .",
    "this is a consequence of the slower mass loss rate of clusters initially lying inside their tidal radii ; it takes longer for these clusters to lose a given amount of mass , and during this additional time a higher degree of mass segregation for stars with masses @xmath48 is reached .",
    "the results of our study show that initial mass segregation can significantly affect the dynamical evolution of star clusters .    for clusters initially filling their roche lobes ,",
    "our simulations show that mass - segregated clusters can quickly dissolve as a result of the early expansion triggered by mass loss due to stellar evolution , unless the initial degree of mass segregation is low .",
    "we have studied the evolution of mass - segregated and unsegregated clusters undergoing the same amount of early impulsive mass loss and find that , for segregated clusters , the preferential removal of this mass from the innermost regions strongly augments the strength of the early expansion and leads to rapid cluster dissolution .",
    "we have also explored the evolution of clusters initially underfilling their roche lobes , showing that in this case mass - segregated clusters can survive the early expansion phase ; a mass - segregated cluster still undergoes a strong expansion in this case , but much of this expansion occurs within its tidal radius without significant loss of stars . the subsequent cluster evolution , lifetime , and mass loss rate",
    "do not differ significantly from those of an initially unsegregated cluster .    the stronger expansion of the segregated cluster , while not leading to rapid dissolution , does drive the cluster toward a less concentrated structure , significantly delaying core collapse .",
    "the less concentrated structure of an initially segregated cluster throughout most of the evolution is the main difference between long - lived segregated and unsegregated clusters .",
    "if clusters still surviving today were initially segregated , this is one of the possible evolutionary routes they might have followed .",
    "another possible scenario has been studied by dercole et al .",
    "( 2008 ) , who demonstrate the role of primordial segregation in the evolution of clusters which form a second generation of stars in the innermost regions of a first - generation population .",
    "the early expansion in this case plays a key role in causing the loss of a large fraction of the first - generation stars , while most of the centrally concentrated second generation remains in the cluster , resulting in a system containing a mix of first and second generation stars that eventually survives until the present day .",
    "we have also studied the differences in the evolution of the stellar mf for segregated and unsegregated clusters , focusing on the evolution of the mf of low - mass ( @xmath48 ) main sequence stars .",
    "our simulations show that the mf of a rapidly dissolving segregated cluster flattens quickly as the system loses stars .",
    "however the extent of the mf flattening induced by a given amount of mass loss for a tidally truncated segregated cluster ( our _ s _ runs ) is smaller than for an initially unsegregated system ( our _ u _ runs ) .",
    "the difference is a consequence of the rapid dissolution of segregated clusters .",
    "we have shown that the initial degree of segregation adopted in our simulations mostly affects massive stars with @xmath53 , while low - mass stars with @xmath54 , initially have a similar spatial distribution to stars in unsegregated clusters .",
    "segregated clusters initially filling their roche lobe quickly lose mass before two - body relaxation can produce a significant difference in the spatial distribution ( and in the mass loss rate ) of stars with masses @xmath54 .",
    "unsegregated clusters , on the other hand , lose stars more slowly and a large fraction of their initial mass is lost late in the evolution , when the most massive stars in the range @xmath48 are significantly more concentrated than stars of lower masses .",
    "the differences between the _ s _ and _ u _ systems in the degree of mf flattening for a given amount of mass loss result from differences in the processes driving the cluster dissolution and , more importantly , from differences in the dissolution timescales associated with these processes .",
    "segregated clusters initially well confined within their roche lobe may survive their early expansion and , in this case , we have shown that both segregated and unsegregated clusters display very similar mf evolution .",
    "as pointed out above , the main fingerprint of initial segregation might be looser cluster structure during a larger fraction of the cluster lifetime .",
    "however , we emphasize that , unless some other mechanism continues to drive the cluster expansion , long - lived segregated clusters also eventually undergo core collapse ; therefore it can not be ruled out that high - concentration and post - core collapse clusters might have been initially segregated .",
    "it has recently been suggested by baumgardt _",
    "et al . _  ( 2008 ) that the low - concentration clusters with strongly flattened mfs found in the observational study by de marchi _ et al . _  ( 2007 ) can result only from the dynamical evolution of initially segregated clusters ( see also marks _",

    "<S> in this paper we use @xmath0-body simulations to study the effects of primordial mass segregation on the early and long - term evolution of star clusters . </S>",
    "<S> our simulations show that in segregated clusters early mass loss due to stellar evolution triggers a stronger expansion than for unsegregated clusters . </S>",
    "<S> tidally limited , strongly segregated clusters may dissolve rapidly as a consequence of this early expansion , while segregated clusters initially underfilling their roche lobe can survive the early expansion and have a lifetime similar to that of unsegregated clusters . </S>",
    "<S> long - lived initially segregated clusters tend to have looser structure and reach core collapse later in their evolution than initially unsegregated clusters . </S>",
    "<S> we have also compared the effects of dynamical evolution on the global stellar mass function ( mf ) of low - mass main sequence stars . in all cases </S>",
    "<S> the mf flattens as the cluster loses stars . </S>",
    "<S> the amount of mf flattening induced by a given amount of mass loss in a rapidly dissolving initially segregated cluster is less than for an unsegregated cluster . </S>",
    "<S> the evolution of the mf of a long - lived segregated cluster , on the other hand , is very similar to that of an initially unsegregated cluster . </S>"
