    "in the envelope - function approximation , the excitonic states in semiconductors and semiconductor quantum dots can be classified by referring to the orbital shape of the exciton envelope function ( @xmath1- , @xmath0- , @xmath2-like ) and the character of the electron and hole bloch functions ( bright and dark states ) .",
    "for example , the state @xmath3 means a bright @xmath4-shell exciton with the electron - hole dipole moment directed along the @xmath5 axis .",
    "theoretically , the fine structure of excited states of zero - dimensional ( 0d ) excitons has been studied for excitons localized , respectively , by rectangular islands in a quantum - well structure @xcite , quantum disks with a gaussian lateral potential @xcite and lens - shaped quantum dots @xcite . however , up to now the splitting of excited - exciton levels has been analyzed for a fixed orbital shell , e.g. , the @xmath4 shell , which is valid in the case of strongly anisotropic confinement so that the orbital splitting of the @xmath0-like shells @xmath4 and @xmath6 exceeds by far the exchange - interaction energy . here",
    "we show that , for axially symmetric or square quantum dots , one has , in addition , to take into account the exchange - interaction - induced mixing between the excitonic states @xmath3 and @xmath7 .",
    "moreover , for the first time we focus on the interplay between the exchange interaction and anisotropic shape of the dot and develop an analytic theory in the particular case where the orbital and exchange splittings are comparable .",
    "the two - particle excitonic wave function can be written as a linear combination of products @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is a product of the electron and hole bloch functions , @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the electron and hole spin indices , @xmath12 is the envelope function , and @xmath13 is the electron ( hole ) 3d radius - vector . in the following , for the sake of simplicity , we concentrate on heavy - hole excitons with @xmath14 and the long - range mechanism of electron - hole exchange interaction which allows to discuss only the bright excitonic states @xmath15 with @xmath16 or their linear combinations @xmath17 with the dipole moment @xmath18 .",
    "the short - range mechanism may be taken into consideration similarly to @xcite if one includes an admixture of light - hole states into the heavy - hole exciton wave function .",
    "we consider a quantum disk formed by a 2d harmonic potential @xmath19 in a quantum well grown along the @xmath20-axis . here",
    "the 2d vector @xmath21 determines the in - plane position of an electron or a hole , and @xmath22 are positive constants . assuming that the confinement along the growth direction is stronger than both the quantum - disk and coulomb potentials the envelope for the electron - hole pair wavefunction can be written as @xmath23 where @xmath24 are the respective @xmath20-envelopes of electron and hole , and @xmath25 is an in - plane wavefunction of exciton calculated with allowance for both coulomb interaction and quantum disk potential .",
    "the form of the function @xmath25 depends on the relationship between the potential radius and 2d - exciton bohr radius , @xmath26 . in",
    "the _ weak _ confinement regime , i.e. in a quantum disk with the diameter exceeding @xmath26 , the two - particle envelope probe function @xmath27 is a product @xmath28 of two functions describing , respectively , the in - plane motion of the exciton center of mass @xmath29 and the relative electron - hole motion , @xmath30 . on the other hand , in small quantum disks with _",
    "strong _ confinement where single - particle lateral confinement dominates over the coulomb interaction , the pair envelope can also be presented as a product of two functions , @xmath31 , but here they describe the independent in - plane localization of an electron and a hole .    for the exciton envelope functions presented in the form ( [ psieh ] ) , the matrix element @xmath32 of long - range exchange interaction taken between the exciton states @xmath33 and @xmath34 is written as follows @xmath35 where the exciton - state index @xmath34 includes the dipole moment @xmath36 , @xmath37 is the high - frequency dielectric constant , @xmath38 is the free electron mass , @xmath39 is the band gap , @xmath40 is the interband matrix element of the momentum operator , and we introduced the 2d fourier - transform @xmath41 of the function @xmath25 at the coinciding coordinates , @xmath42 .",
    "we start with an axially - symmetric quantum disk and calculate the fine structure of the @xmath0-orbital exciton level and then proceed to a slightly anisotropic disk .",
    "the straightforward calculation shows that the long - range exchange hamiltonian ( [ work ] ) has the following non - zero matrix elements @xmath43 @xmath44 @xmath45 where @xmath46 . according to eq .",
    "( [ psplitting ] ) and in agreement with the angular - momentum considerations , the @xmath0-shell of the bright exciton in an axisymmetric quantum disk is split into three sublevels , see fig .  1 .",
    "the outermost sublevels labelled @xmath47 , @xmath48 are nondegenerate and characterized by a zero total angular - momentum @xmath20-component .",
    "the central doubly - degenerate sublevel corresponds to the angular - momentum component @xmath49 .",
    "the intersublevel energy spacing , @xmath50 , equals to @xmath51 .",
    "the splitting @xmath50 depends on the character of exciton confinement in a disk .",
    "let us assume @xmath52 , where @xmath53 is the disk effective radius , @xmath54 are the electron and hole effective masses .",
    "it follows then that in the strong confinement regime , @xmath55 , one has @xmath56 where the exciton is quantized as a whole we obtain @xmath57 with @xmath58 being the radius of exciton in - plane confinement , @xmath59 and @xmath60 .",
    "we introduce a slightly elliptical lateral potential replacing the disk radius @xmath53 by the effective radii @xmath61 , @xmath62 along the @xmath63 and @xmath5 axes , respectively , and assuming @xmath64 . at zero @xmath65",
    "the exciton @xmath0-states are partially split by the exchange interaction .",
    "the anisotropy of a quantum disk results in a full removal of the degeneracy and formation of four sublevels .",
    "it is convenient to introduce , as a parameter describing the anisotropy , a half of the @xmath4-@xmath6 splitting , @xmath66 , calculated neglecting the exchange interaction .",
    "its value depends on the model of exciton quantization .",
    "if an electron and a hole are quantized independently ( @xmath55 ) then , for the @xmath67 excited state , we have @xmath68 and , for the @xmath69 state , @xmath66 differs from eq .",
    "( [ omega ] ) by the replacement @xmath70 . here",
    "@xmath69 means an exciton formed by a @xmath71-shell electron and a @xmath72-shell hole .",
    "if exciton is quantized as a whole then in eq .",
    "( [ omega ] ) one should replace @xmath73 by the exciton translational mass @xmath59 and @xmath53 by @xmath74 .",
    "figure 1 shows splitting of the @xmath0-shell bright - exciton level as a function the ratio @xmath75 . for small values of @xmath76",
    "the splitting of the doublet @xmath49 is proportional to @xmath77 . in the limit of strong anisotropy , @xmath78 , the @xmath0-shell",
    "exciton states form two doublets , @xmath79 and @xmath80 @xmath81 , separated by @xmath82 and each split by @xmath50 .",
    "= 2.6 in [ fig : psplt ]",
    "finally , we briefly discuss the @xmath0-@xmath1 excitonic polaron which is formed as a result of the resonant coupling of the @xmath0- and @xmath1-like levels by a longitudinal optical ( lo ) phonon @xcite .",
    "we use an approach developed in ref .",

    "is given by @xmath83 here @xmath84 is the lo - phonon frequency , @xmath85 is the 3d normalization volume , @xmath86 , and @xmath87    depolarization of the linearly - polarized @xmath0-@xmath1 excitonic polaron excited via the @xmath0-shell is determined by the ratio of @xmath88 and the exchange splitting @xmath50 . if @xmath89 the initial linear polarization is being rapidly lost and the exciton photoluminescence is practically depolarized . on the contrary , if @xmath90 then the polarization relaxes on a much longer time scale and can be well preserved .",
