    "the search for distant galaxy clusters began decades ago with @xcite original identification of a large sample of ( then ) distant clusters in the palomar optical sky survey plates .",
    "a major goal of many surveys since has been to push the redshift limits of searches to as high as possible",
    ". currently , the most distant clusters known are at @xmath6 @xcite . a wide variety of techniques , both blank field ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and targeted ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) have been used as viable methods for pushing cluster searches to high redshifts , with the blank - field methods being the most promising for cosmologically motivated studies .",
    "broadly , these methods either search for visible effects from the intra - cluster gas via x - ray surveys ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) or proposed sunyaev - zeldovich ( sz ) effect surveys , or the effects of the cluster galaxies themselves , via extragalactic background light fluctuations @xcite , or matched - filter ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) or cluster red - sequence @xcite analyses of resolved images",
    ". direct detection of massive clusters via weak - lensing has also been suggested @xcite .    a significant , and at this point unresolved ,",
    "issue is whether or not the clusters discovered by various methods will in fact sample the same fundamental population .",
    "this is particularly relevant at high redshifts since various observables are likely to be more divergent and less closely tied to mass during the process of cluster assembly . addressing these issues",
    "fully requires surveys using multiple techniques over the same areas . in this letter",
    "we present detailed observations of one of the first and richest clusters found in the rcs at @xmath5 .",
    "we use @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 km  s@xmath10  mpc@xmath10 throughout .",
    "the red - sequence cluster survey ( rcs ) searches for clusters by exploring over - densities in position and color space , detecting the unambiguous signal from the early - type galaxy color sequence seen in local and high redshift clusters @xcite .",
    "the survey has been conducted using the large format mosaic cameras at cfht and the ctio 4 m in @xmath11 and @xmath12 to a @xmath13 point source detection limit of 25.1 and 23.7 mag , respectively . the first data and cluster catalogs for the northern patches are presented in @xcite and for the southern patches in @xcite .",
    "this letter presents detailed optical and ir observations of rcs043938 - 2904.9at @xmath14 ( j2000 ) , one of the most massive and distant rcs clusters for which ancillary data have been acquired .",
    "we have detected this cluster with a peak significance of 4.98 @xmath15 , and estimated its photometric redshift to be @xmath16 .",
    "ir imaging was taken using isaac on the vlt during the nights of the 26 - 27 october 2001 , under photometric and excellent seeing conditions ( @xmath17).the exposure time was 3240 s and 5184 s in the @xmath18  and @xmath3  bands , respectively .",
    "the reduction of the images was carried out in the usual manner , masking out the objects to properly subtract the sky in the images .",
    "the final individual registered images were scaled to correct for airmass differences and then combined to produce the final @xmath18  and @xmath3  images .",
    "the images were calibrated using the ir standard stars of @xcite to a 0.04 mag uncertainty in @xmath18  and 0.05 mag in @xmath3 .",
    "the @xmath19-band image was taken at the baade 6.5 m telescope at the las campanas observatory the night of the 11th of january of 2002 , under photometric conditions and 0.6 arcsec seeing .",
    "the @xmath19-band data are calibrated to @xcite standards , with an uncertainty of 0.04 mag .",
    "the total exposure time was 2400 s. a color composite image using the optical and ir imaging of this cluster is shown in figure 1 .",
    "photometry on the field was performed using sextractor @xcite v2.2.1 , using the @xmath3-band image for object detection .",
    "the total magnitude is determined using the _ best _ magnitude given by sextractor while colors are measured in a fixed @xmath20 circular diameter aperture .",
    "the ir images were convolved with a gaussian kernel to match the seeing of the optical image in order to determine accurate colors . in the @xmath21 arcmin area imaged in @xmath3 we find 228 galaxies down to @xmath3(ab)=23 , while for a blank field we expect to find only 126 @xcite . in @xmath3",
    "the cluster is an over - density of @xmath4 , assuming poisson statistics for the background counts . using the @xmath22-band data from the survey itself",
    ", we measure a red - sequence richness parameter @xmath23 ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) of @xmath24 mpc@xmath25 @xmath26 , indicating a richness between abell richness 1 and 2 ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , comparable to the coma cluster .",
    "multi - object spectroscopy was carried out first on the baade 6.5 m telescope using ldss2 under exceptional seeing conditions .",
    "these observations confirmed several members .",
    "further spectroscopy was carried out on the vlt in service mode the nights of the 1st , 8th and 29th of january 2003 .",
    "the spectra were taken using fors2 with the gris_300i+21 grism and the og590 filter , with a total integration time of 9510 s ( split into six observations ) .",
    "galaxies were selected by their colors in the central regions where deep ir imaging was available , and by having similar magnitudes in the outer regions .",
    "one aperture mask was made for the field consisting of 37 slits with variable lengths , typically @xmath27 and widths of @xmath28 .",
    "the spectra were reduced with iraf in the usual manner . for typical",
    "spectra the wavelength range spans from @xmath29   to @xmath30  with a dispersion of @xmath31   pix@xmath10 , and an rms uncertainty in the wavelength solution of 0.12  .",
    "redshifts were determined using two methods .",
    "one was a line by line absorption and emission identification and the other via cross - correlation .",
    "for the template spectrum we used ngc 1426 , ngc 1407 and a synthetic spectrum @xcite . prior to cross - correlation",
    ", all real emission and residual night sky emission line features were removed through interpolation , and a high order polynomial was fit to the spectra for continuum removal .",
    "a simple parabola was fit to the correlation peak .",
    "for spectra whose @xcite _ r _ value was below 3.0 , a comparison was made with absorption line identifications . if no absorption lines could be identified in the spectra to confirm the rv result , the velocity was discarded .",
    "a total of 29 spectra yielded reliable redshifts , of which 11 are consistent with being at the cluster redshift .",
    "we find that rcs043938 - 2904.9is at @xmath1@xmath2 , while we had estimated @xmath32 from the photometry alone .",
    "the spectra for one of the brightest central galaxies is shown in figure 2 .",
    "further details on the spectroscopy for this and other clusters at similar redshifts will be presented in @xcite .",
    "the high quality vlt images enable morphological studies of the galaxies in the field of rcs043938 - 2904.9 . for this purpose",
    "we used a 2-d galaxy light profile fitting technique @xcite .",
    "the morphology and effective radius , for e / s0s , is determined by inspecting the 2-d residual images from subtraction of a psf - convolved model .",
    "the model can be a bulge ( i.e. , an r@xmath33-law ) , an exponential disk , or a linear combination of both .",
    "figure 3 shows @xmath34 vs. @xmath35 for the morphologically selected e / s0s in the field of rcs043938 - 2904.9 . these galaxies follow a size - magnitude relation similar to that for local cluster e / s0s .",
    "the difference between these two populations is best interpreted as an offset in magnitude for the galaxies in rcs043938 - 2904.9 , explained as the expected luminosity change for these galaxies due to passive evolution .",
    "figure 4 shows the ir and ir - optical color magnitude diagrams for the objects in the field of rcs043938 - 2904.9 , within a diameter of 500 proper kpc .",
    "this diagram shows an excess of galaxies at @xmath36 and @xmath37 over a wide range of magnitude .",
    "this excess is enhanced when only the morphologically selected e / s0 galaxies ( see  4 above ) are included ( solid squares ) .",
    "the broken line shows the color - magnitude relation for the e / s0 galaxies in coma , @xmath38-corrected to @xmath1 .",
    "the galaxies in rcs043938 - 2904.9  are bluer than the galaxies in coma by @xmath39 mag in @xmath40 and about 0.25 in @xmath41 .",
    "a more detailed analysis using population synthesis models @xcite suggest we should expects a color difference of @xmath42 and @xmath43 if most of the stars in these galaxies were formed by @xmath44 , and to @xmath45 and @xmath46 if these were formed by @xmath47 , assuming solar metallicity .",
    "these data are consistent with a simple stellar population formed at @xmath48 , consistent with studies of other clusters at similar redshifts .",
    "we use an iterated linear fit with 3-@xmath15 clipping to fit the red - sequence and estimate the slope and color scatter for all galaxies with an elliptical morphology in figure 4 , in a manner akin to @xcite .",
    "errors were estimated using bootstrap re - sampling of the input catalogs .",
    "the measured slopes are -0.052@xmath49 and -0.038@xmath50 in @xmath51 and @xmath52 respectively , and the measured scatters in the color - magnitude relations for the e / s0 galaxies in rcs043938 - 2904.9  amount to @xmath53 mag and @xmath54 .",
    "fitting using other techniques such as the biweight estimator of @xcite yields similar values .",
    "neither method makes an explicit background correction , nor have we subtracted the effects of photometric errors , and so formally the reported scatter in the red - sequence should be treated as an upper limit .",
    "the rcs search technique relies on the presence of a population of e / s0 galaxies with similar colors , and as such it is not surprising to find a well defined color - magnitude sequence for rcs043938 - 2904.9 .",
    "this relation is also found in the optical / ir selected z=1.273 cluster clg j0848 + 4453 @xcite with a scatter and slope similar to that found in rcs043938 - 2904.9 .",
    "studies of the x - ray selected clusters rdcs j0910 + 5422 at z=1.106 @xcite and rdcs j1252.9 - 2927 at z=1.237@xcite also show a similar color - magnitude relation , with a small intrinsic scatter .",
    "the red - sequence properties seen in rcs043938 - 2904.9  are also consistent with those seen in the heterogeneous and mostly lower - redshift cluster sample of @xcite .",
    "similarly , the luminosity evolution observed in rcs043938 - 2904.9  has been observed in other cluster samples up to @xmath55 .",
    "the brightening of @xmath56 found here is consistent with that found by a number of other studies of both the fundamental plane ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * and references therein ) and its projection as the kormendy relation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . from both the red - sequence color , slope and scatter , and the apparent luminosity evolution of these galaxies ,",
    "we thus conclude that there is no evidence that the red galaxy population in rcs043938 - 2904.9  is any different than that seen in clusters at similar redshifts but found by other means .",
    "@xmath3  imaging of rcs043938 - 2904.9  shows and excess of 102 galaxies ( @xmath57 ) over the expected background counts within the imaging field , and confirms expectations from our initial rcs survey imaging that rcs043938 - 2904.9  is extremely rich .",
    "spectroscopy of rcs043938 - 2904.9  shows it to be a true cluster at @xmath1@xmath2 , making it one of the more distant rich cluster systems known to date .",
    "a detailed analysis of our imaging data shows that rcs043938 - 2904.9  has an early - type galaxy population consistent with that seen in the few other clusters studied at a similar redshift , in that the color - magnitude and size - magnitude relations of these galaxies is as for other @xmath58 systems .",
    "this is despite the fact that these various clusters were selected by rather different means .",
    "though this result is expected since the rcs is thought to be complete for massive systems at @xmath59 , the apparent uniformity of the galaxy populations between clusters selected at different means implies that the rcs selection method does not introduce significant biases .",
    "this will be confirmed by on - going and future follow - up observations in both multi - wavelength imaging and spectroscopy of a much larger sample of @xmath59 rcs clusters .",
    "we thank the staff at lco , ctio and vlt for the excellent support in the observations .",
