    "depending on the geometrical size and shape of such inhomogeneities , there can be annihilation or reflection of an incident nonlinear wave .",
    "these disturbances on the propagation regime may have important consequences for the behavior of the system @xcite .",
    "for instance , propagation of fluxons in josephson junctions ( jj s ) may be affected by spatial heterogeneities in the junction created by a current dipole device @xcite",
    ". however , transmission , reflection , and annihilation are far from being the only possible phenomena that may occur when solitary waves collide with localized spatial inhomogeneities .",

    "the study is based on an analytical model of solitons externally excited by a family of topologically equivalent forces in one dimension @xcite .",

    "the perturbed sg equation has the exact solutions @xmath6 @xcite . here",
    ", @xmath7 and @xmath8 reads for the kink and antikink , respectively .",
    "@xmath9 is an antisymmetric spatial function that vanishes exponentially for @xmath10 and has a single zero at @xmath11 .",
    "it is known that the zeros of the external force act as equilibrium positions for the soliton motion @xcite .",
    "thus , @xmath12 is an equilibrium position . in particular ,",
    "if @xmath9 possesses only one zero ( @xmath13 ) and @xmath14 , then the point @xmath15 is a stable ( unstable ) equilibrium position for the kink ( antikink ) .",
    "otherwise , if @xmath16 , the equilibrium position @xmath15 is unstable ( stable ) for the kink ( antikink ) .",
    "thus , @xmath17 is a parameter that controls the extension of the force , its maximum amplitude , and the sign of its derivative at @xmath12 .    for the following discussion",
    "we consider the case @xmath18 and @xmath19 . for this force function",
    ", the stability analysis for kink internal modes can be solved exactly @xcite . for @xmath20",
    ", @xmath9 has a positive slope around @xmath12 , the translational mode is stable and there are no internal shape modes . in this regime , the soliton is trapped at the stable equilibrium position @xmath21 . if @xmath22 , @xmath9 has a negative slope around @xmath12 .",
    "the translational mode of the kink is unstable .",
    "still , no internal modes are present .",
    "the soliton moves from its equilibrium position without shape deformations .",
    "for @xmath23 , the first stable internal shape mode arises , while for @xmath24 many other internal modes can appear . for @xmath25 $ ] , where @xmath26 , the first internal mode becomes unstable , leading to a soliton breakup and shape instabilities @xcite .",
    "following up the one - dimensional case , we will consider only line soliton solutions for the two - dimensional system , eq .. to control the spreading of the inhomogeneous force in the y - direction we introduce a smooth decaying function .",
    "consequently , the internal modes of the soliton will be activated locally , i.e. , in a certain region of the kink front .",
    "any rapidly decaying function can be used for this purpose , e.g. a gaussian function , a superposition of heaviside functions , or some spline polynomial . in our model , we have used a gaussian function , since it is a physically realizable force . therefore , the inhomogeneous force @xmath27 is given by @xmath28 where @xmath17 and @xmath29 acts as control parameters .",
    "given that @xmath29 is a measure of the gaussian width , it plays a controlling role of the local stability of the front .",
    "force is displayed in figure [ fig01 ] .",
    "the perturbation of fluxons by dipole current devices in jj s is a typical example of a strong and local external influence with the same topological form as expression @xcite",
    ". this forcing term may be also relevant for 1d models of biological molecules , like dna chains , where 1d sg systems have been considered as a suitable model to explain the formation of open states or _",
    "bubbles _ in the double helix @xcite .",
    "thus , results obtained in this work can be generalized to other topologically equivalent systems @xcite .        in the present paper , all numerical simulations",
    "are performed using a kink as the initial condition , and the perturbation @xmath30 . however , recall that the coefficient @xmath31 becomes negative for @xmath32 .",
    "this change will lead to the instabilities that we have discussed above .",
    "we have used finite differences of second order of accuracy to numerically solve equation with no - flux boundary conditions . for the explicit difference schemes",
    ", we have used a regular mesh of size @xmath33 , with @xmath34 .",
    "the space intervals are @xmath35 , and the time increment is .",
    "the initial conditions are given by @xmath36 and @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is an arbitrary parameter .",
    "this represents a stationary kink located at the equilibrium point @xmath12 ( see inset fig.[fig01 ] ) . under these conditions ,",
    "we avoid any scattering effect , focusing our attention on the dynamics of the soliton internal structure .",
    "notwithstanding , any stationary soliton located near the stable equilibrium point @xmath12 can be attracted and trapped by the inhomogeneity , setting up an initial condition as well . the damping term in equation is introduced to dissipate the phononic excitations emitted by the mesh .",
    "in this section , we summarize the main results obtained from numerical simulations",
    ". as previously stated , @xmath17 and @xmath29 act as control parameters .",
    "thus , our parameter space is @xmath39 .",
    "it is expected that for a value of @xmath29 large enough , we recover the one - dimensional results by varying @xmath17 . for smaller values of @xmath29 , however , activation of internal modes will be only local .      to check the numerical method , we started our simulations setting the following parameter values , @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "this value reproduces an extended enough force in comparison with the mesh size @xmath42 and it represents our @xmath29 upper limit . according to the one - dimensional theory , for @xmath20 , it is expected that the translational mode to be stable , whereas no shape internal modes are present .",
    "indeed , the line soliton translational mode is stable for @xmath40 .",
    "no front motion is observed .",
    "next , we decrease the value of @xmath17 . according to the 1d theory , for @xmath43",
    "the translational mode is locally unstable .",
    "two - dimensional numerical simulations show that for @xmath43 , the localized force _ always _ destabilizes the translational mode of the soliton , despite the value of @xmath29 .",
    "this is a surprising result since one would expect that a sufficiently localized perturbation could not destabilize an extended object .",
    "the lattice coupling would prevent the kink front motion if the perturbation is sufficiently local .",
    "however , this is not the case .",
    "+     in figure [ fig02 ] we show the results obtained for @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "the soliton translational mode is locally unstable around the origin , as expected from the one - dimensional theory .",
    "since the force is localized in space , the kink front turns unstable locally . in figure",
    "[ fig02](a ) we see that this local instability travels in the @xmath46-direction with a certain velocity , destabilizing the whole kink front progressively .",
    "the perturbation eventually reflects on the boundaries , and travels backward . in figure [ fig02](b )",
    ", we display the @xmath47-profile for @xmath48 .",
    "we can observe that the line soliton core experiences a small oscillation before the whole front begins to move .",
    "such oscillation , which amplitude is decaying in time , is produced by an interaction between the local destabilization and the lattice .",
    "eventually , the local instability overcomes the lattice coupling coefficient and the front starts to move after around @xmath49 time iterations .",
    "figure [ fig02](b ) also reveals a curvature effect , exhibited by the small return of the front to the origin .",
    "such effect will be described more extensively in the subsequent section .",
    "the last bursting is produced by the reflection of the perturbation in the walls .",
    "+    for @xmath23 , the stable first internal shape mode arises , which becomes unstable for @xmath25 $ ] , where @xmath26 .",
    "consequently , for @xmath50 , the line soliton will exhibit more complex phenomena due to the local destabilization of an internal shape mode .",
    "effectively , the local instability of the shape mode leads to a local break - up of the front .",
    "this initial breaking travels through the lattice , developing finally a stable _ bubble - like structure_. in figure [ fig03](a ) , we can observe the formation of a stable bubble - like structure for @xmath51 and @xmath45 .",
    "initially , we observe the formation of an elliptic - like structure that grows around the inhomogeneity .",
    "the initial small oscillation is not present because the instability is strong enough to overcome rapidly the lattice coupling coefficient . in this scenario ,",
    "the curvature of the structure plays an important role in the dynamics .",
    "the radial velocity decreases such that a maximum size of the elliptic structure is reached , and then the structure collapses backward .",
    "this effect is known in the literature as the _ return - effect _",
    "@xcite , and is produced entirely by the curvature of the elliptic front . during this collapse ,",
    "the elliptic structure separates from the front in two breaking points ( bp ) showed in figure [ fig03](a ) .",
    "+     formation and time - evolution of the bubble - like structure can also be seen in figure [ fig03](b ) .",
    "we show the @xmath47-profile of the soliton at @xmath48 as a function of time .",
    "we can see that around the first @xmath52 time iterations , the elliptical - type form grows and collapses , following by the formation of the bubble .",
    "the bubble - like structure is formed in the positive region of @xmath47 and its size is initially oscillating due to reminiscent perturbations produced during its formation .",
    "these oscillations decrease in time , and the structure remains stable with a fixed size and shape ( fig .",
    "[ fig03](c ) ) .",
    "the oscillating process is depicted in fig.[fig04 ] .    to evaluate the role of parameter @xmath29 and @xmath17 over the formation of bubble - like structures , we proceed to vary both parameters separately .",
    "figure  [ fig04 ] shows the temporal evolution of the major @xmath53 and minor @xmath54 semi - axis of the elliptical structure .",
    "we observe that the bubble formation process is the same in all cases but not the bubble final size . in fig .",
    "[ fig04](a ) we have varied parameter @xmath17 leaving @xmath55 fixed . we can observe that both @xmath54 and @xmath53 oscillate on time . however , after this initial transient state , the system evolves to a determined size .",
    "it is clear that as we increase @xmath17 , @xmath54 and @xmath53 decrease , reducing the final bubble area . on the contrary ,",
    "when we vary @xmath29 , leaving @xmath17 fixed , the opposite occurs .",
    "figure  [ fig04](b ) shows the temporal evolution of @xmath54 and @xmath53 of the bubble structure for @xmath56 fixed .",
    "as @xmath29 gets smaller , we can see that the final bubble area also decreases .",
    "however , if we continue diminishing @xmath29 , leaving @xmath17 in the range where the first internal mode is unstable , the preferred structure is one with the reverse polarity  in terms of the topological charge  a _ drop - like structure_. figure [ fig05](a ) shows the formation of a stable drop - like structure for @xmath57 and @xmath58 . as we can observe , the mechanism of drop formation is similar to that of the bubble - like structure . after the collapse of the elliptical form",
    ", a stable drop - like structure is formed in the negative region of @xmath47 , in contrast with the bubble formation ( see fig .",
    "[ fig05](b ) ) . from inset in fig .",
    "[ fig05](b ) is clear that the drop - like formation is produced after the total collapse of the initial bubble , suggesting a kink - antikink collision between the bubble walls .",
    "subsequently , the kink - antikink merge with the same velocity but a phase shift , enhancing a drop - like structure . in fig .  [ fig05](c ) , we depicted the final stage of the drop - like structure .    from this result",
    ", we can infer that the final bubble area , and therefore @xmath29 and @xmath17 , are playing an important role in determining which kind of structure will be formed , either bubble or drop - like .",
    "this will be further discussed in section [ sec : discussion ] .",
    "+      until now we have observed the formation of isolated drops or bubbles in a certain range of the parameter space @xmath59 .",
    "still , further diminishing the value of @xmath17 , with fixed @xmath29 , we have found a coexistence region where a bubble and a drop merge in a stable structure_a bubble - drop bound state . _ in figure [ fig06](a ) we display the bubble - drop bound state formation for @xmath60 and @xmath61 . from the one - dimensional theory , it is known that below @xmath62 , the formation of two - kink solitons occurs . as expected , the typical elliptic - like structure grows to exhibit a two - kink profile .",
    "one two - kink connects the states @xmath63 and @xmath64 , and also the states @xmath64 and @xmath65 , as it can be seen in figure [ fig06](b ) .",
    "meanwhile , an additional two - kink connects the states @xmath66 and @xmath64 , passing through @xmath63 .",
    "however , after a transient , this last state breaks , the @xmath67 kink moves along the negative x - direction while the @xmath68 kink forms a drop .",
    "conversely , both kinks in the positive x - direction remain oscillating around their positions until reach a stable state_a two - kink bubble . _",
    "finally , we get a two - kink bubble and a single drop forming a stable bound state ( see fig.[fig06](c ) ) .",
    "we have observed also multi - structures , like a _ multi - kink bubble _ , for smaller values of @xmath17 .",
    "we can understand the formation of bubbles and drops by considering the following mechanism .",
    "the initial condition used in our simulations is a @xmath63-kink connecting two stable states in phase space , namely @xmath69 and @xmath70 .",
    "since the inhomogeneous force is localized around the origin , the internal modes of the soliton become unstable only in a neighborhood of the origin .",
    "the instability of the internal shape mode leads to a kink - antikink pair formation .",
    "the local antikink remains steady in the origin and it will constitute part of the bubble .",
    "this kink zone will propagate until the localized forced is weak enough to the return effect and kink - interaction come to play . at this stage ,",
    "the ellipse walls start to move backward .",
    "if @xmath29 is large enough or @xmath17 small , the walls will reach a steady position , forming a stable bubble .",
    "the final area of this bubble will depend on both parameters , @xmath29 and @xmath17 . under a critical value of the elliptical area ,",
    "the kink - antikink interaction is strong enough to produce the bubble collapse . as we have mentioned before , this enables the formation of a drop - like structure due to a phase shift during the kink - antikink collision .",
    "therefore , the value of parameters @xmath17 and @xmath29 will determine which kind of structure will be formed .",
    "the external force @xmath27 sustains the bubble and it acts as an opposite force of the kink - antikink interaction .",
    "the interplay between both forces : one pulling inwards ",
    "kink - antinkink interaction  and the other pulling outwards  external force",
    " create a stable equilibrium - the bubble state .",
    "in fact , @xmath27 is predominant in the bubble final shape .",
    "based on this , we can infer that @xmath54 is controlled by the force for @xmath71 .",
    "thus , the semi - minor axis @xmath54 will be proportional to the decaying coefficient of @xmath72 , @xmath73 , therefore @xmath74 .",
    "meanwhile , @xmath53 is controlled by the gaussian function .",
    "the maximum of @xmath27 is located at @xmath75 .",
    "this represents the point where the gaussian function has its maximum extension .",
    "the decaying coefficient of @xmath76 is @xmath77 .",
    "thus , @xmath78 . as we can see , @xmath79 possesses a slower decaying tail than @xmath80 , hence , the elliptical form of the bubble .",
    "figures  [ fig04](a ) and  [ fig04](b ) , respectively , corroborate these statements .",
    "we also notice that the shrinking force due to return effect , along with the external inhomogeneous force , produce an oscillation of the two - kink pairs in the two - bubble structures .",
    "however , they finally stabilize forming _ two - kink bubbles _ ( see figure  [ fig07 ] ) .",
    "we performed numerical simulations for several combinations of values of @xmath17 and @xmath29 and obtained the qualitative parameter space map showed in figure [ fig08 ] .",
    "all different kind of structures has been depicted .",
    "we notice that for large @xmath29 , the results are in good agreement with the predictions of the one - dimensional theory .",
    "this is an expected result since the system behaves as a quasi - one - dimensional system in this region of parameter space .",
    "we notice in figure [ fig08 ] that there are no stable structures below a certain value of @xmath29 . we have calculated this minimum value @xmath81 by considering the kink - antikink interaction energy , @xmath82 , where @xmath83 is the distance between cores @xcite .",
    "the kink - antikink interaction tends to collapse the bubbles , while @xmath84 tends to sustain them .",
    "thus , we expect that stable structures can be formed when one equilibrates the other . indeed , the function @xmath84 intersect @xmath85 only in a certain interval @xmath86 . by a careful analysis of the intersection interval",
    ", we obtained that @xmath87 , which is in agreement with the results depicted in figure [ fig08 ] . under this minimum value ,",
    "any structure will eventually collapse , since the inhomogeneity @xmath4 never equilibrates the kink - antikink attractive force .",
    "it is noteworthy that the formation of bubbles and drops in our system is a robust phenomenon .",
    "results similar to the ones presented in this article can be obtained in other systems using other external perturbations with the same topological properties of force . in the following ,",
    "we briefly discuss some theoretical studies that corroborate these findings .",
    "the sg equation is a particular case of the more general nonlinear kg equation @xmath88 where @xmath89 , and the nonlinear potential @xmath90 possesses at least two minima separated by a barrier .",
    "these two minima are fixed points of the associated dynamical system , and it is well known that kink solutions are heteroclinic trajectories joining such fixed points @xcite .",
    "therefore , a complete investigation of equations of type can be performed using the so - called qualitative theory of dynamical systems @xcite . knowing the behavior of kink solutions in the neighborhood of fixed points and separatrices , it is possible to construct other functions with the same general properties of the exact solutions of equation .",
    "thus , it is possible to generalize the results to other equations that are topologically equivalent to those with the exact solutions @xcite .",
    "therefore , we conclude that the same structure formation reported in this article can be observed qualitatively using more general forces expressed as follows : @xmath91 where @xmath92 is an exponentially decaying function such that @xmath93 .",
    "thus , the general topological properties of @xmath94 are the following : ( a ) @xmath94 should have a zero accompanied by a local minimum and a local maximum .",
    "( b ) must be localized , i.e. @xmath95 .",
    "note that the function given by equation is a particular case of this class of functions .",
    "the relevant parameters are the slope of the function at the equilibrium point @xmath96 and the values of the maximum and the minimum .    to give a particular example of the above discussion , let us briefly consider in the force the functions @xmath97}+\\frac{1}{\\cosh^p\\left[b(x - d)\\right]}\\right],\\\\   & g(y)=\\mbox{sech}\\left(\\frac{y}{s}\\right).\\label{eq09b}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]",
    "notice that with these functional profiles , force fulfills all required properties .",
    "parameters @xmath98 and @xmath99 control the value of the local maximum of @xmath27 and its @xmath47-coordinate position , respectively .",
    "the spread of the force in the @xmath47 direction is controlled by parameters @xmath100 and @xmath101 , while in the @xmath46-direction is controlled by @xmath102 . in figure [ fig09 ]",
    "we reproduce qualitatively the same results discussed in this work for the reported values of parameters .    giving that the discussed phenomena can occur for more general forces ,",
    "we conclude that @xmath94 does not have to be exactly @xmath103 .",
    "for example , the @xmath27 discussed in this work is a very good approximate model of the current dipole device created by ustinov and collaborators @xcite , which can be implemented in jj s experiments .",
    "the technique of insertion of fluxons into annular jj s proposed in @xcite can be theoretically understood as the creation of a fluxon - antifluxon pair due to internal modes instabilities .",
    "the development of methods that allow for the construction of exact solutions to the equation for a general @xmath104 and the investigation of the topological influence of the actual shape of the experimental forcing is an open problem that requires more research work in the future .",
    "( a)(b ) + ( c)(d ) +      equation also appears in the description of structural phase transitions , where a central question is whether the system can be driven to a new phase by some instability @xcite .    in the vicinity of a first order phase transition , a metastable state of matter",
    "can be obtained by means of nonlinear excitations .",
    "the main phenomenon is that of _ nucleation _ , where bubbles and drops can grow or disappear . a _",
    "critical germ _ is commonly considered for the development of a given instability that is energetically above a _ nucleation barrier _ , in order to produce a transition from one phase to another .",
    "if the field configuration @xmath105 has a radius larger than the critical germ , the instability will grow and a phase transition will occur @xcite .    in the case of the sg system ,",
    "the potential is given by @xmath106 @xcite , and we have several barriers , i. e. , unstable states , that separate stable states .",
    "unstable stationary solutions that connect any two of these stable states are , indeed , kink - antikink pairs with a drop - like or bubble - like structure .",
    "these solutions play the role of a critical germ for the transition from one state to the other @xcite .",
    "unstable regions in parameter space can be interpreted as intervals for parameters @xmath29 and @xmath17 where the force produces drops and bubbles with a smaller size than the critical germ , so they collapse . in the case",
    "where these structures are larger than the critical germ , the attractive force between kinks and antikinks are balanced by the external force , so the structure is sustained by the inhomogeneity .",
    "this property has been used in real experiments of controlled transport of bubbles using laser beams in weak absorbing liquids @xcite , where a first - order liquid - vapour phase transitions are induced .",
    "we expect that a time - dependent force with a spatial profile similar to equation would be useful to transport the bubble - like and drop - like structures reported in this work .",
    "by means of numerical simulations , we have shown that the internal structure of two - dimensional sine - gordon solitons affects the dynamics of the wave when interacting with localized inhomogeneities .",
    "we have observed the formation of bubble and drop - like structures that are sustained by the force , being unstable otherwise .",
    "the formation of these structures are entirely due to internal mode instabilities of the solitary wave , and it has no relation with any scattering effect .",
    "we have given a qualitative explanation of the formation of such structures using an analytical model of the breaking of solitons by topologically equivalent inhomogeneities . from our simulations , we have demonstrated that the two - kink solutions can be also stable in two - dimensional systems . for the observed phenomena , we have given an interpretation in the context of the phase transitions theory .",
    "we expect to observe the formation of bubbles and drops in related solitonic systems , like the @xmath0 model . of course",
    ", the existence of multi - structures will depend on the existence of many stable states in phase space .",
    "thus , we do not expect to find a two - kink bubble structure in a two - dimensional @xmath0 model , as well as it is not expected to find multikinks in the one - dimensional model @xcite .    as a final remark",
    ", the phenomena observed in this work may have important implications in two - dimensional jj s devices .",
    "the formation of bubbles in the junction due to a dipole current and the trapping and breaking of such structures by such localized inhomogeneities may produce important effects on the functioning of the device .",
    "moreover , the study of the stability and transport of such bubbles can shed light on the design of built - in heterogeneities and control of perturbations in the junction .",
    "fluxon transmission in jj s devices can also be regulated by the application of this kind of external perturbations .",
