    "online social networks provide organizations and public figures with a range of tools to seamlessly reach out to , as well as broaden , their audience . among these , _",
    "facebook pages _ make it easy to broadcast updates , publicize products and events , and get in touch with customers and fans .",
    "facebook allows page owners to promote their pages via targeted advertisement .",
    "this constitutes one of the primary sources of revenue for facebook , as its advertising platform is reportedly used by 2 million small businesses , out of the 40 million which have active pages  @xcite .",
    "at the same time , as the number of likes on a facebook page is considered a measure of its popularity  @xcite , an ecosystem of so - called _ `` like farms '' _ has emerged that offer paid services to artificially inflate the number of likes on facebook pages .",
    "these farms often rely on networks of fake and compromised accounts , as well as incentivized collusion networks where users are paid for actions from their account  @xcite . in prior work",
    "@xcite , we showed that some like farms follow a nave approach with a large number of accounts liking target pages within a short timespan .",
    "whereas , others exhibit a _ stealthier _ behavior , gradually spreading likes over longer timespans , aiming to evade fraud detection algorithms .",
    "we found that only a handful of like farm accounts were detected by facebook @xcite .",
    "facebook discourages users to buy fake likes , warning that they _",
    "`` can be harmful to your page '' _ and routinely launches clean - up campaigns to remove fake accounts , including those engaged in like farms .",
    "aiming to counter like farms , researchers as well as facebook have been working on tools to detect fake likes ( see section  [ sec : related work ] ) .",
    "one currently deployed tool is copycatch , which detects lockstep page like patterns by analyzing the social graph between users and pages , and the times at which the edges in the graph are created  @xcite .",
    "another one , synchrotrap , relies on the fact that malicious accounts usually perform loosely synchronized actions in a variety of social network context , and can cluster malicious accounts that act similarly at around the same time for a sustained period of time  @xcite .",
    "the issue with these methods , however , is that stealthier ( and more expensive ) like farms can successfully circumvent them by spreading likes over longer timespans and liking popular pages to mimic normal users .    as a consequence , in this paper",
    ", we set to characterize the liking patterns of accounts associated with like farms and systematically evaluate the effectiveness of graph co - clustering fraud detection algorithms  @xcite in correctly identifying like farm accounts .",
    "we show that these tools incur significantly high false positives rates for stealthy farms , as their accounts mimic normal users .",
    "next , we investigate the use of timeline information , including lexical and non - lexical characteristics of user posts , to improve the detection of like farm accounts .",
    "we crawl and analyze timelines of user accounts associated with like farms as well as a baseline of normal user accounts .",
    "our analysis of timeline information highlights several differences in both lexical and non - lexical features of baseline and like farm users .",
    "in particular , we find that timeline posts by like farm accounts have 43% fewer words , a more limited vocabulary , and lower readability than normal users posts . moreover , like farm posts generate significantly more comments and likes , and a large fraction of their posts consists of non - original and often redundant `` shared activity '' ( i.e. , repeatedly sharing posts from other users , articles , videos , and external urls ) .    based on these timeline - based features , we train three classifiers using supervised two - class support vector machines ( svm )  @xcite and evaluate them using our ground - truth dataset .",
    "our first and second classifiers use , respectively , lexical and non - lexical features extracted from timeline posts , while the third one uses both .",
    "our evaluation shows that the latter can accurately detect like farms accounts , achieving up to 99100% precision and 9397% recall .",
    "finally , we generalize our approach using other state - of - the - art classifier algorithms , namely , decision tree  @xcite , adaboost  @xcite , knn  @xcite , random forest  @xcite , and nave bayes  @xcite , and empirically confirm that the svm classifier achieves higher accuracy across the board .    *",

    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "next section introduces the datasets used in our experiments , while section  [ sec : coclustering ] evaluates the accuracy of state - of - the - art co - clustering techniques to detect like farm accounts in our datasets .",
    "next , we study timeline based features ( both non - lexical and lexical ) in section  [ sec : characterizing ] , and evaluate classifiers built using these features in section  [ sec : detection ] . after reviewing related work in section  [ sec : related work ]",
    ", the paper concludes in section  [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "* previous campaigns . * our starting point are the facebook accounts gathered as part of our prior work @xcite , which presented an exploratory analysis of facebook like farms using honeypots .",
    "specifically , we created 13 facebook pages called _  virtual electricity \" _ and , while keeping them empty ( i.e. , no posts / pictures ) , promoted eight of them using popular like farms and five using facebook `` page like '' ads .",
    "the eight like farm campaigns employed boostlikes.com ( bl ) , socialformula.com ( sf ) , authenticlikes.com ( al ) , and mammothsocials.com ( ms ) , each with one campaign targeting worldwide users and one targeting users in the usa , while the five facebook campaigns respectively targeted users in the usa , france , india , egypt , and worldwide . in the rest of the paper",
    ", we use the campaign acronyms followed by the target audience , e.g. , sf - all denotes the socialformula.com campaign targeting worldwide users .",
    "note that bl - all and ms - all did not actually deliver any likes , even though they were paid .",
    "overall , our campaigns @xcite garnered 5,918 likes from 5,616 unique users : 1,437 unique accounts from facebook ad campaigns and 4,179 unique accounts from the like farm campaigns .",
    "note that some users liked more than one honeypot pages .",
    "after a few months , we checked how many accounts had been closed or terminated and found that 624/5,616 accounts ( 11% ) were no longer active .    * new data collection . * in august 2015",
    ", we began to crawl the pages liked by each of the 4,179 like farm users from  @xcite , using the selenium web driver .",
    "we also collected basic information associated with each page , such as the total number of likes , category , and location , using the page identifier .",
    "unlike in our previous study , we now also crawled the timelines of the like farm accounts . specifically , we collected timeline posts ( up to a maximum of 500 recent posts ) , the comments on each post , as well as the associated number of likes and comments on each post .    besides some accounts having become inactive ( 376 )",
    ", we also could not crawl the timeline of 24 users who had restricted the visibility of their timeline .",
    "moreover , facebook blocked all the accounts we used for crawling , so we stopped our data collection before we could completely finish our data collection , hence , we missed further 109 users . in summary ,",
    "our new data consists of 3,670 users out of the initial 4,179 users ( 88% ) gathered in  @xcite .",
    "we collected more than 234k posts ( messages , shared content , check - ins , etc ) for these accounts , noticing that 72% of them had at least 10 publicly visible posts .",
    "we also rely on a sample of 1,408 random accounts previously gathered by chen et al .",
    "@xcite , which we use to form a baseline of `` normal '' accounts . for each of these accounts , we again collected posts from their timeline , their page likes , and information from these pages .",
    "53% of the accounts had at least 10 visible posts on the timeline , and in total we collected about 35k posts .",

    "the training and testing of all these classifiers follow the same set - up as the svm approach .",
    "we again use 80% and 20% of the combined lexical and non - lexical features to build the training and testing sets , respectively .",
    "we summarize the performance of the classifiers in table  [ tab : classifiers_on_all_features ] .",
    "our results show that the svm classifier achieves the highest f1-scores across the board . due to overfitting on our dataset",
    ", random forest and nave bayes show poor results and require mechanism such as pruning , detailed analysis of parameters , as well as selection of the optimal set of prominent features to improve classification performance  @xcite  @xcite .    * analysis .",
    "* we now analyze in more details the classification performance ( in terms of f1-score ) to identify the most distinctive features .",
    "specifically , we incrementally add lexical and non - lexical features to train and test our classifier for all campaigns .",
    "we observe that the average word length ( cf .",
    "figure  [ fig : lexical_fa ] ) and average number of words per post ( cf .",
    "figure  [ fig : nonlexical_fa ] ) provide the most improvement in the f1-score for all campaigns .",
    "this finding suggests that like farm users use shorter words and fewer number of words in their timeline posts as compared to baseline users .",
    "while these features provide the largest improvement in detecting a like farm account , an attempt to circumvent detection by increasing the word length or number of words per post will also effect the ari , flesch score , and richness .",
    "that is , increasing word length and number of words on posts in a way that is not readable nor understandable , will not improve the overall outlook of the account to appear real .",
    "therefore , combining several features increases the workload required to appear real on like farm accounts .",
    "the overall classification accuracy with both lexical and non - lexical features is reported in figure  [ fig : combined_fa ]",
    ".     +    * remarks . *",
    "our results demonstrate that it is possible to accurately detect like farm users from both sophisticated and nave farms by incorporating additional account information  specifically , timeline activities .",
    "we also argue that the use of a variety of lexical and non - lexical features will make it difficult for like farm operators to circumvent detection . like",
    "farms typically rely on pre - defined lists of comments , resulting in word repetition and lower lexical richness . as a result ,",
    "we argue that , should our proposed techniques be deployed by facebook , it will be challenging , as well as costly , for fraudsters to modify their behavior and evade detection , since this would require instructing automated scripts and/or cheap human labor to match the diversity and richness of real users timeline posts .",
    "prior work has focused quite extensively on the analysis and the detection of fake accounts in online social networks @xcite . by contrast",
    ", we focus on detecting accounts that are employed by like farms to boost the number of facebook page likes , whether they are operated by a bot or a human .    our classifier is trained using accounts obtained from honeypots , somewhat similar to previous work in the context of spam in myspace and twitter  @xcite .",
    "our work uses accounts attracted by facebook pages actively engaging like farms and , unlike  @xcite , leverages timeline - based features for the detection .",
    "wang et al .",
    "@xcite study the human involvement in weibo s reputation manipulation services , showing that simple evasion attacks ( e.g. , workers modifying their behavior ) as well as poisoning attacks ( e.g. , administrators tampering with the training set ) can severely affect the effectiveness of machine learning algorithms to detect malicious crowd - sourcing workers . partially informed by their work , we do not only cluster like activity performed by users but also build on lexical and non - lexical features .",
    "other studies have analyzed services that sell _ twitter followers _",
    "@xcite , fake and compromised twitter accounts  @xcite , as well as _",
    "crowdturfing _ in social networks  @xcite .",
    "specific to facebook fraud is copycatch  @xcite , a technique currently deployed by facebook to detect fraudulent accounts by identifying groups of connected users liking a set of pages within a short time frame .",
    "synchrotrap  @xcite extends copycatch by clustering accounts that perform similar , possibly malicious , synchronized actions , using tunable parameters such as time - window and similarity thresholds in order to improve detection accuracy .",
    "however , as highlighted in our prior work  @xcite , while some farms seem to be operated by bots ( producing large bursts of likes and having limited numbers of friends ) that do not really trying to hide their activities , others , _ stealthier _ farms exhibit behavior that may be challenging to detect with tools like copycatch and synchrotrap .",
    "in fact , our evaluation of graph co - clustering techniques shows that these farms successfully evade detection by avoiding lockstep behavior and liking sets of seemingly random pages . as a result",
    ", we decide to use timeline features , relying on both lexical and non - lexical features to build a classifier detecting stealthy like farm users with high accuracy .",
    "our work can complement other methods used in prior work to detect fake and compromised accounts , such as using unsupervised anomaly detection techniques  @xcite , temporal features  @xcite , or ip addresses  @xcite .",
    "finally , we stress that our prior work  @xcite only presents an exploratory measurement study of like farms , based on the characteristics of the accounts that liked a few honeypot pages .",
    "specifically ,  @xcite analyzes the geographic and demographic distribution of garnered likes , the temporal patterns observed for each campaign , as well as the social graph induced by the likers . whereas , in this paper , we take a significant step further : although we re - use the honeypot campaigns to build a corpus of like farm users , ( i ) we demonstrate that temporal and social graph analysis can only be used to detect naive farms , and ( ii ) we introduce a timeline - based classifier that achieves a remarkably high degree of accuracy .",
    "the detection of fraudulent accounts in online social networks is crucial to maintain confidence among legitimate users and investors . in this paper , we focused on detecting accounts used by facebook like farms , i.e. , paid services artificially boosting the number of likes on a given facebook page .",
    "we crawled liking patterns and timeline activities from like farms accounts and from a baseline of normal users .",
    "we evaluated the effectiveness of existing graph based fraud detection algorithms , such as copycatch  @xcite and synchrotrap  @xcite , and demonstrated that sophisticated like farms can successfully evade detection .    aiming to address this problem , we set to incorporate additional profile information from accounts timelines to train machine learning classifiers geared to distinguish between like farm users from normal ones .",
    "we first experimented with term frequency - inverse document frequency ( tf - idf ) but achieve relatively poor performance .",
    "we then turned to lexical and non - lexical features from user timelines .",
    "we found that posts made by like farm accounts have 43% fewer words , a more limited vocabulary , and lower readability than normal users posts .",
    "moreover , like farm posts generated significantly more comments and likes , and a large fraction of their posts consists of non original and often redundant `` shared activity '' ( i.e. , repeatedly sharing posts made by other users , articles , videos , and external urls ) . by leveraging both lexical and non - lexical features , we experimented with several machine learning classifiers , with the best of our classifiers ( svm ) achieving as high as 100% precision and 97% of recall , and at least 99% and 93% respectively across all campaigns  significantly higher than graph co - clustering techniques .    in theory , fraudsters could try to modify their behavior in order to evade our proposed timeline - based detection .",
    "however , like farms either heavily automate mechanisms or rely on manual input of cheap human labor . therefore , since non - lexical features are extracted from users interactions with timeline posts , imitating normal users behaviors will likely incur an remarkably higher cost .",
    "even higher would be the cost to interfere with lexical features , since this would entail modifying or imitating normal users writing style ."
