    "<S> the effect of the correlations in the ground state properties of the nuclear matter is studied .    in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we introduce short range correlations in a relativistic approach to the description of nuclear matter for the first time . </S>",

    "<S> there are several advantages in using an unitary model operator . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , one automatically guarantees that the correlated state is normalized . </S>",
    "<S> the general idea of introducing short range correlations in systems with short range interactions exists for a long time @xcite but has not been pursued for the relativistic case .    </S>",
    "<S> nonrelativistic calculations based on realistic nn potentials predict equilibrium points that are not able to describe simultaneously the correct binding energy and saturation density ; either the saturation density is correct but the binding energy is too small , or the correct binding energy is obtained at a too high density @xcite . in order to solve this problem a repulsive potential or density - dependent repulsive mechanism @xcite </S>",

    "<S> due to lorentz covariance and self - consistency , relativistic mean field theories @xcite include automatically contributions which are equivalent to @xmath0-body repulsive potentials in non - relativistic approaches .    in non - relativistic models </S>",
    "<S> the interaction arises from the interplay between a long range attraction and a very strong short range repulsion and it is indispensable to take short range correlations into account . in relativistic mean field models , </S>",
    "<S> the parameters are phenomenological , fitted to the saturation properties of nuclear matter . </S>",
    "<S> short range correlation effects are may be included to some extent in the model parameters . </S>",
    "<S> however , we want to study the consequences of taking these effects into account explicitly @xcite .    </S>",

    "<S> let us denote the two - body correlated wave function by @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the short range correlation factor , the so - called jastrow factor @xcite . for simplicity , we consider @xmath34 , @xmath35 , and @xmath36 where @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath37 are parameters </S>",
    "<S> . the important effect of the short range correlations is the replacement , in the expression for the ground - state energy , of the interaction matrix element @xmath38 by @xmath39 , where @xmath40 is the kinetic energy operator of particle @xmath41 . </S>",

    "<S> the inclusion of correlations introduces an extra node in the ground - state wave - function contrary to what generally happens in non - relativistic calculations with a hard core . in this case </S>",

    "<S> the quantities cos@xmath77 and sin@xmath77 are plotted in figure 2 . </S>",
    "<S> they show how the interaction and correlations make the wave - function deviate from the free wave - function , represented by a dotted line . </S>",
    "<S> the correlated angle @xmath76 lies between the hartree - fock(hf ) and the free wavefunction angles . as a consequence </S>",
    "<S> , we will see that the correlated effective mass will not decrease so fast with density as the hf effective mass .    in table </S>",
    "<S> [ tab ] , we have tabulated the parameters used in our calculation together with the compressibility @xmath78 , the relative effective mass @xmath79 , the kinetic energy @xmath80 , the direct and exchange parts of the potential energy ( @xmath81 and @xmath82 respectively ) with correlation and the correlation contribution to the kinetic energy @xmath83 , all calculated at the saturation point . notice that a hf calculation produces an eos which is stiffer than the one obtained at the hartree level . </S>",
    "<S> however , the inclusion of correlations gives a larger effective mass than both hartree and hf calculations and a softer eos . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , the contribution of direct and exchange correlation terms are of the same order of magnitude of the other terms in the energy per particle . </S>",
    "<S> hence , they can not be disregarded .    </S>",
    "<S> we have computed the binding energies as function of the density for the hartree , hf and hf+corr and compared with the quark - meson - coupling model ( qmc ) @xcite and a non - linear walecka model nl3 @xcite , as can be seen from fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3 . the inclusion of correlations make the equation of state ( eos ) softer than hartree or hf calculations . </S>",
    "<S> nl3 and qmc also provide softer eos around nuclear matter saturation density but around two times saturation density , the eos with correlations is softer than nl3 . in figure 4 </S>",
    "<S> we plot the effective mass as a function of density . </S>",
    "<S> if correlations are included the effective mass does not decrease so fast with the increase of density as in a hartree or , even worse , hf calculation . </S>",
    "<S> this explains the softer behavior of the eos with correlations .    </S>",
    "<S> we conclude referring that , although correlation effects in the hartree and hf calculations are may be taken partially into account by a correct choice of the coupling constants , the explicit introduction of correlations has other effects such as softening the eos .    </S>",
