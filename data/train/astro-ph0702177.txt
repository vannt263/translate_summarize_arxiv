    "pulasr radio signals probe fluctuations in the local interstellar medium @xcite .",
    "the broad electron density fluctuation spectrum @xcite is commonly interpreted as a turbulent inertial range .",
    "the pulsar signal width yields information about fluctuation statistics @xcite .",
    "the width scales as @xmath1 ( @xmath2 is the distance to source ) , a result that is incompatible with gaussian statistics @xcite .",
    "the latter would produce a scaling of @xmath3 , while @xmath1 is recovered for levy statistics @xcite .",
    "a levy - distributed random walk typically consists of a series of small random steps , punctuated by occasional levy flights in which there is a single large jump to a new locale . in the context of a pulsar radio signal propagating through a levy distribution of electron density fluctuations , a sea of low intensity density fluctuations would scatter the signal through a series of small angles . intermittently , as the signal traversed an intense , localized density fluctuation , it would scatter through a much larger angle .",
    "the assertion that pulsar signals are dispersed by levy - distributed fluctuations is a statistical ansatz validated to some degree by observation .",
    "this ansatz does not address the difficult and important question of what processes or conditions produce the statistics .",
    "it has been suggested that levy statistics can emerge from radio signal trajectories grazing the surface of molecular clouds @xcite .",
    "here we examine a different mechanism rooted in the turbulent cascade implied by the broad fluctuation spectrum .",
    "the mechanism is intrinsic spatial intermittency , a process known to create non gaussian tails in the probability distribution function ( pdf ) . in navier - stokes turbulence , intrinsic intermittency takes the form of randomly dispersed , localized vortex strands , surrounded by regions of relative inactivity @xcite .",
    "intermittency is most pronounced at small scales .",
    "intermittency also occurs in mhd turbulence @xcite .",
    "however the statistical properties of electron density fluctuations in magnetic turbulence are not known . in this paper",
    "we address the fundamental and nontrivial question of whether electron density can become intermittent in the magnetic turbulence of the interstellar medium . the effect on pulse - width scaling",
    "requires that additional issues be addressed , and will be taken up later .",
    "the question of intermittency in pulsar scintillation is twofold .",
    "first , can intermittent electron density fluctuations in interstellar turbulence achieve the requisite intensity to change the pdf ?",
    "to some extent this question has been answered by studies that show that passive advection and the limitations it places on electron density excitation ( as indicated , for example , by mixing length arguments ) applies only to scales larger than tens of gyroradii . at smaller scales",
    "the electron density becomes active through kinetic alfvn wave ( kaw ) interactions with magnetic fluctuations , exciting the internal energy to equipartition with the magnetic energy @xcite .",
    "evidence for a transition to kaw dynamics near the gyroradius scale has recently been inferred from solar wind observations @xcite .",
    "since scintillation is dominated by small scales , the regime of kinetic alfvn interactions is appropriate for studying the intermittency potentially associated with the scaling of the pulsar signal width .",
    "the second aspect of intermittency in the context of pulsar signals deals with how isolated structures can form against the homogenizing influence of turbulent mixing in a type of turbulence that does not involve flow . virtually all mechanisms proposed for intermittency involve flow or momentum , yet , the flow of ions in magnetic turbulence decouples from small - scale kinetic alfvn waves , with the interaction of magnetic field and density taking place against a background of unresponsive ions .",
    "while intermittency has been widely studied in hydrodynamic turbulence @xcite and mhd @xcite , historically the emphasis has been on structure and statistics , not mechanisms .",
    "structure studies have included efforts to visualize intermittent structures @xcite .",
    "quantitatively , measurements of structure function scalings have been made to gauge how intermittency changes with scale @xcite .",
    "statistical characterizations of intermittency generally postulate a non gaussian statistical ansatz , and the resultant properties are compared with measurements to determine if the ansatz is reasonable .",
    "these approaches do not address the mechanisms that endow certain fluctuation structures either with individual longevity or collective prominence , in a statistical sense , relative to other regions in which such structures are not present @xcite .",
    "the mechanistic approach is nascent but has already yielded significant insights into the long - standing problem of subcritical instability in plane pouseille flow @xcite .    a starting point for our considerations",
    "are simulations of decaying kaw turbulence that showed the emergence of coherent , longlived current filaments under collisional dissipation of density @xcite . in these simulations",
    "finite amplitude fluctuations in density and magnetic field decayed from initial gaussian distributions .",
    "( the current , as curl of the magnetic field , was also gaussian initially . )",
    "the distribution of current became highly non gaussian as certain current fluctuations persisted in the decay long past the nominal turbulent correlation time .",
    "the longevity of these filaments enhanced the tail of the pdf , steadily increasing the value of the fourth order moment ( kurtosis ) significantly above its gaussian value .",
    "while the pdf was affected by mutual interactions of filaments later in the simulation , initially the tail enhancement was dominated by the interaction of filaments with surrounding turbulence , and the lack of mixing of those filaments relative to the rapidly - decaying surrounding turbulence .",
    "intermittency was not reported when resistivity dominated the dissipation .",
    "while these simulations showed intermittency in kaw turbulence , non gaussian statistics was demonstrated for current fluctuations , not density .",
    "the turbulence decayed via collisional dissipation of density ; the current had no direct damping .",
    "it is not clear what effect this had on density structure formation within the constraints of the resolution of the simulations .",
    "the question of intermittency in density therefore remains open .",
    "no mechanism for the intermittency was proposed .    in this paper",
    "we will examine analytically the dynamics of structures in density and current and determine how one relates to the other .",
    "we will use analysis tools and results developed to understand the emergence of long lived vortices in decaying 2d navier - stokes turbulence @xcite . for that problem",
    ", two time - scale analysis showed that the vortices are coherent and long lived because strong shear flow in the outer part of the vortex suppresses ambient mixing by turbulence @xcite .",
    "the ambient mixing would otherwise destroy the vortex in a turnover time .",
    "this mechanism for maintaining the coherent vortex in decaying turbulence correctly predicts the observed distribution of gaussian curvature of the flow field @xcite .",
    "we use two - time - scale analysis to describe coherent structure formation in decaying kaw turbulence .",
    "the following are obtained .",
    "1 ) we identify the mechanism that allows certain current filaments to escape the turbulent mixing that otherwise typifies the turbulence .",
    "current and density are mixed by the random interaction of kinetic alfvn waves .",
    "this process is disrupted in current filaments whose azimuthal field has an unusually large amount of transverse shear .",
    "this creates a strong refraction of turbulent kinetic alfvn waves that localizes them to the periphery of the filament and restricts their ability to mix current and density .",
    "2 ) we derive a shear threshold criterion based on this mechanism .",
    "it identifies which current filaments escape mixing and become coherent , or long lived .",
    "the criterion relates to the gaussian curvature of the magnetic field , providing a topological construct that maps the intermittency in a way analogous to the flow gaussian curvature of decaying 2d navier - stokes turbulence .",
    "3 ) we trace the relative effects of the refractive shear mechanism on current , magnetic field , density , and flux .",
    "the magnetic field and density have long - lived , localized fluctuation structures that coexist spatially with localized current filaments .",
    "however , the magnetic field extends beyond the localized current . like the magnetic field of a line",
    "current , it falls off as @xmath4 . because the density is equipartitioned with the magnetic field in kaw turbulence a similar mantle is expected for the density .",
    "this mantle tends to prevent the density kurtosis from rising to values greatly above 3 ; however , it is responsible for giving the pdf of density gradient a levy distribution .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section ii presents the kinetic alfvn wave model used in this paper .",
    "the two - time - scale analysis is introduced in sec .",
    "section iv derives the condition for strong refraction , and the resultant refractive boundary - layer structure for turbulent kaw activity in and around the coherent filament .",
    "the turbulent mixing stresses are determined in sec .",
    "v , from which the filament and density lifetimes can be derived .",
    "section vi discusses the gaussian curvature and spatial properties of the current and density structures .",
    "the latter are used to infer heuristic pdfs .",
    "conclusions are given in sec .",
    "the shear - alfvn and kinetic - alfvn physics described in the introduction is intrinsic to models of mhd augmented by electron continuity .",
    "when there is a strong mean field , the nonlinear mhd dynamics can be represented by a reduced description @xcite , given by    @xmath5    @xmath6    @xmath7    where @xmath8    and @xmath9 . in the reduced description the perturbed magnetic field is perpendicular to the mean field and can be written as @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the direction of the mean field , and @xmath12 is the normalized parallel component of the vector potential .",
    "the flow has zero mean and is also perpendicular to the mean field @xmath13 .",
    "it can be expressed in terms of the electrostatic potential as @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the normalized electrostatic potential .",
    "the normalized density fluctuation is @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the mean density , and @xmath18 is the normalized resistivity , where @xmath19 is the spitzer resistivity .",
    "spatial scales are normalized to @xmath20 , time is normalized to the alfvn time @xmath21 , @xmath22 is the ion acoustic velocity , @xmath23 is the alfvn velocity , and @xmath24 is the ion gyrofrequency . within their limitations ( isothermal , incompressible fluctuations ) , eqs .",
    "( 1)-(4 ) are valid for scales both large and small compared to the gyroradius , as well as the intermediate region .",
    "equation ( 3 ) is the electron continuity equation .",
    "the advective nonlinearity , @xmath25 , couples electron density fluctuations to the flow .",
    "if there is a nonuniform mean density , advection drives weak density fluctuations of amplitude @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the scale of density fluctuations and @xmath28 is the mean density scale length .",
    "the continuity equation also contains a compressible nonlinearity , @xmath29 , whereby compressible electron motion along magnetic field perturbations provides coupling to the magnetic field .",
    "electrons act on the magnetic field through parallel electron pressure in ohm s law , expressed as @xmath30 in eq .",
    ". the couplings of magnetic field and density are weak at scales appreciably larger than the ion gyroradius . on those scales",
    "the advection of electron density is passive to a good approximation , and governs electron density evolution . in the region around @xmath31 , the two nonlinearities in each of eqs .",
    "( 1)-(3 ) become comparable @xcite . for @xmath32",
    ", @xmath30 begins to dominate @xmath33 in eq .",
    "( 1 ) , and @xmath29 begins to dominate @xmath25 in eq .",
    "this is a very different regime from incompressible mhd , where the magnetic field and flow actively exchange energy through shear alfvn waves . in a turbulent cascade",
    "approaching the ion gyroradius scale from larger scales , the energy exchanged between flow and magnetic field in shear alfvn interactions diminishes relative to the energy exchanged between the electron density and the magnetic field through the compressible coupling .",
    "consequently flow decouples from the magnetic field , increasingly evolving as a go - it - alone kolmogorov cascade , while electron density and magnetic field , interacting compressively through kinetic alfvn waves , supplant the shear alfvn waves .",
    "once the kinetic alfvn wave coupling reaches prominence , the internal and magnetic energies become equipartitioned , @xmath34 , even if the internal energy is only a fraction of the magnetic energy at larger scales .",
    "if there is no significant damping at the ion gyroradius scale , the large - scale shear alfvn cascade continues to gyroradius scales and beyond though kinetic alfvn waves .",
    "the gyroradius scale at which kaw dynamics is active is order @xmath35 cm in the warm ism .",
    "this is small relative to the scale of intermittent flow structures in molecular gas clouds , recently reported to be order @xmath36 cm @xcite .",
    "this scale difference is crudely consistent with the high magnetic prandtl number of the warm ism .",
    "the value pr @xmath37 allows very small scales in the ionized medium , before dissipation becomes important , relative to scales of viscous dissipation in the clouds .",
    "the gyroradius scale of intermittent kaw structures makes direct visualization in the ism difficult .    in the kaw regime",
    ", the model can be further simplified by dropping the flow evolution .",
    "this leaves a kaw model in which electron density and magnetic field interact against a neutralizing background of unresponsive ions ,    @xmath38    @xmath39    solutions of this model closely approximate those of eqs .",
    "( 1)-(3 ) when the scales are near the gyroradius or smaller @xcite .",
    "this model assumes isothermal fluctuations , consistent with strong parallel thermal conductivity .",
    "equations ( 5 ) and ( 6 ) are fluid equations , hence landau - resonant @xcite and gyro - resonant dissipation , which may be important in the ism , are not modeled .",
    "ohm s law has resistive dissipation , and density evolution has collisional diffusion .",
    "depending on the ratio @xmath40 , either of these dissipation mechanisms can damp the energy in decaying turbulence , however , the damping occurs at small dissipative scales .",
    "we will focus on inertial behavior at larger scales .",
    "we assume that mean density is nearly uniform , and neglect the last term of eq .",
    "the dispersion relation for ideal kinetic alfvn waves is determined by linearizing eqs .",
    "( 5 ) and ( 6 ) , neglecting resistive dissipation @xmath41 , and introducing a fourier transform in space and time .",
    "the result is @xmath42 , where @xmath43 , or @xmath44 .",
    "if dimensional frequency and wavenumbers @xmath45 , @xmath46 , and @xmath47 are reintroduced , the dispersion relation is @xmath48 . the wave is seen to combine alfvnic propagation with perpendicular motion associated with the gyroradius scale .",
    "the kaw eigenvector yields equal amplitudes of magnetic field and the density , @xmath49 , with a phase difference of @xmath50 .    in magnetic turbulence with its hierarchy of scales ,",
    "kinetic alfvn waves also propagate along components of the turbulent magnetic field . in the reduced description",
    "the turbulent field is perpendicular to the mean field , hence the dispersion relation of these kinetic alfvn waves carries no @xmath51 dependence .",
    "to illustrate , we isolate such a fluctuation from the mean - field kinetic alfvn wave by setting @xmath52 ; with this wavenumber zero , we drop the subscript from @xmath53 ; we consider a turbulent magnetic field component @xmath54 at wavenumber @xmath55 that dominates the low-@xmath56 fluctuation spectrum ; and we look at the dispersion for smaller scale fluctuations satisfying @xmath57 .",
    "the latter conditions linearize the problem , yielding a dispersion relation for kinetic alfvn waves propagating along the turbulent field @xmath58 according to @xmath59\\textrm { } k$ ] . reintroducing dimensions , @xmath60 .",
    "we see that the dispersion is alfvnic , but with respect to a perturbed field component that is perpendicular to the mean field .",
    "hence the frequency goes like @xmath61 instead of @xmath62 .",
    "to understand and quantify the conditions under which a coherent current fluctuation persists for long times relative to typical fluctuations , we examine the interaction of the coherent structure with surrounding turbulence and derive its lifetime under turbulent mixing .",
    "the interaction is described using a two - time - scale analysis , allowing evolution on disparate time scales to be tracked @xcite . the coherent structure , a current filament with accompanying magnetic field and electron density fluctuations , evolves on the slow time scale under the rapid - scale - averaged effect of turbulence . on the rapid scale",
    "the filament is essentially stationary , creating an inhomogeneous background for the rapidly evolving turbulence .",
    "identifying conditions that support longevity justifies the two time scale approximation a posteriori .",
    "simulations suggest the filament is roughly circular .",
    "if coordinates are chosen with the origin at the center of the filament , a circular filament is azimuthally symmetric , while the turbulence breaks that symmetry .",
    "the filament current is localized , hence its current density becomes zero at some distance from the origin .",
    "the localized current profile necessarily creates a magnetic field that is strongly inhomogeneous . on the rapid time scale over which the turbulence evolves",
    ", this field , which is part of the coherent structure , is essentially stationary .",
    "it acts as a secondary equilibrium field in addition to the primary equilibrium field ( which is homogeneous and directed along the @xmath11-axis ) .",
    "turbulence , in the form of random kinetic alfvn waves , propagates along both the primary and secondary fields . because the primary field is homogeneous its effect on the turbulence is uninteresting .",
    "however , the secondary field is strongly sheared because of the local inhomogeneity created by the structure .",
    "strong shear refracts the turbulent kinetic alfvn waves . in the subsequent analysis",
    "we will ignore the primary kaw propagation , which we can do by setting @xmath52 , and focus on the refraction of kaw propagation by the secondary magnetic field shear .",
    "strong refraction will be shown to localize kinetic alfvn waves away from the heart of the filament , allowing it to escape mixing and thereby acquire the longevity to make it coherent .",
    "with @xmath63 , we apply the separation of long and short time scales to fluctuations in @xmath64 and @xmath65 as follows : @xmath66 where the symbol @xmath67 represents either @xmath68 or @xmath69 , with @xmath70 and @xmath17 the flux function and density of the coherent structure , and @xmath71 and @xmath72 the turbulent fields of flux and density . the variables for slowly and rapidly evolving time are @xmath73 and @xmath74 .",
    "the origin of a polar coordinate system with radial and angle variables @xmath75 and @xmath76 is placed at the center of the structure .",
    "the structure is assumed to be azimuthally symmetric .",
    "the turbulence evolves in the presence of the structure , hence it is necessary to specify the radial profile of @xmath70 , or more explicitly , the profile of the secondary , structure field @xmath77 . as a generic profile for localized current",
    "we adopt a reference profile that peaks at the origin and falls monotonically to zero over a finite radius @xmath78 . for simplicity",
    "we take the variation as quadratic , giving @xmath79    where @xmath80 . integrating the current we obtain @xmath81 b_{\\theta}(r)=\\frac{j_0(0)a^2}{4r } & & ( r\\geq a ) .",

    "shortly we will introduce a more general description for a filament whose current peaks at the origin and decays monotonically .",
    "the current of the coherent filament is wholly localized within @xmath82 .",
    "however , the magnetic field is not localized , but slowly decays as @xmath4 outside the filament .",
    "the quantities in eqs .",

    "the dependence on @xmath73 is not notated because when @xmath83 appears in the turbulence equations , it is a quasi equilibrium quantity on the rapid time scale .    to describe the rapid time scale evolution and its azimuthal variations we introduce a fourier - laplace transform , @xmath84\\exp[\\gamma t],\\ ] ]    where @xmath85 is the shift of the complex integration path of the inverse laplace transform .",
    "the radial variation of @xmath86 creates an inhomogeneous background field for the turbulence , making fourier transformation unsuitable for the radial variable .",

    "we have examined the formation of coherent structures in decaying kinetic alfvn wave turbulence to determine if there is a dynamical mechanism in interstellar turbulence that leads to a non gaussian pdf in the electron density . such a pdf has been inferred from scalings in pulsar scintillation measurements .",
    "we use a model for kinetic alfvn wave turbulence that is applicable when there is a strong mean magnetic field . the nonlinearities couple density and magnetic field in the plane",
    "perpendicular the mean field in a way that is analogous to the coupling of flow and magnetic field in reduced mhd .",
    "the model applies at scales on the order of the ion gyroradius and smaller .",
    "we show that the coherent current filaments previously observed to emerge from a gaussian distribution in simulations of this model @xcite result from strong refraction of turbulent kinetic alfvn waves .",
    "the refraction occurs in the edge of intense , localized current fluctuations , and is caused by the strongly sheared magnetic field associated with the current .",
    "this refraction localizes turbulent wave activity to the extreme edge of the filament , and impedes mixing ( turbulent diffusion ) of the filament current by the turbulence . from this analysis",
    "we conclude that the turbulence suppression by sheared flows common in fusion plasmas @xcite has a magnetic analog in situations where there is no flow .",
    "this leads to a further conclusion that intermittent turbulence , which is generally associated with flows , can occur in situations where there is no flow .",
    "( by flow we mean ion motion .",
    "electron motion is incorporated in the current . )",
    "we have derived a condition for the strength of magnetic shear required to produce the strong refraction and suppress mixing .",
    "we show that this condition yields a prediction for the gaussian curvature of the magnetic field .",
    "this quantity is predicted to have large values inside the coherent current filaments , and small values everywhere else . inside filaments",
    "the gaussian curvature is negative at the center , and positive at the edge .",
    "the analysis shows that long - lived fluctuation structures form in the density and magnetic field , provided damping is negligible . like the current filaments , these structures",
    "avoid mixing because of the refraction of turbulent kinetic alfvn wave activity .",
    "hence they occur in the same physical location as the current filaments .",
    "however the localized nature of the current filaments give the long - lived magnetic field an extended region external to the current . in this region",
    "the field falls off as @xmath4 , where @xmath75 is distance from the center of the filament .",
    "because kinetic alfvn wave dynamics yields an equipartition of density and magnetic field fluctuations , we posit that the long - lived density has a similar extended structure . as a result",
    ", the connection between coherent structure and localization that is true for the current , and makes it highly intermittent , does not apply to the density .",
    "while there is coherent long - lived density , it need not be localized .",
    "a similar situation holds for vorticity and flow in 2d navier stokes turbulence @xcite . to explore this matter",
    "we have used the physics of the coherent structure formation to derive heuristic probability distribution functions for the current and density . as the turbulence decays , leaving intense current fluctuations as coherent current filaments , the kurtosis of current increases to a value proportional to the packing fraction .",
    "the kurtosis of density does not become as large , and could , under appropriate circumstances , remain close to the gaussian value of 3 .",
    "however mergers of structures in a situation with very weak dissipation could increase the kurtosis well above 3 .",
    "more importantly , however , the density pdf is non gaussian even when its kurtosis is not greatly different from 3 .",
    "the @xmath4 structure external to the current gives the pdf a tail that goes as @xmath299 .",
    "mapping the @xmath4 structure to a pdf in density gradient , the density - gradient pdf decays as @xmath318 , a levy distribution .",
    "this suggests that the mechanism described here may play a role in the scaling of pulsar _ rf _ signals .",
    "several aspects of this problem need additional study .",
    "it is important to adapt these results to a steady state . generally speaking",
    ", there is a dynamical link between decaying turbulence and turbulence in a stationary dissipation range .",
    "hence these results , at least qualitatively , are relevant to the dissipation range .",
    "dissipation begins to affect the spectrum at a scale that is somewhat larger ( order of magnitude ) than the nominal dissipation scale @xcite .",
    "structures such as these would correspond to active , filamentary regions of dissipation analogous to those observed in neutral gas clouds , albeit at a much smaller scale and with no accompanying flow shear signature .",
    "intermittent structures can extend into the stationary inertial range , but the analysis presented here must be modified . in the inertial range ,",
    "turbulence is replenished , allowing the slow mixing of a coherent structure to continue until it is gone .",
    "structures are also regenerated by the turbulence , and the statistics is ultimately set by a balance of mixing and regeneration rates .",
    "the mixing rates calculated here are sufficiently slow in strong filaments , that coherent structure formation is expected even in a steady state .",
    "there is also a possible link between structures in the larger scale range of shear alvn excitations and kaw excitations .",
    "these questions will be explored in future work .",
    "while gyroradius - scale kaw turbulence may arise in astrophysical contexts other than the ism , the small scales make it unlikely that astrophysical observations will be available for testing this theory .",
    "therefore , simulations should be used to check key conclusions from the theoretical work presented here .",
    "these include the formation of density structures , which was not reported in @xcite , the structure of the gaussian curvature , which validates the refraction hypothesis , and the existence of the @xmath4 structure in the density and its effect on the pdf",
    ". the effect of this type of density field on _ rf _ scattering remains the underlying question , and modeling of the scattering with simulated fields should be pursued .",
    "the authors acknowledge useful conversations with stanislav boldyrev , including his observation that the density pdf derived herein immediately leads to a levy distribution in the density gradient .",
    "pwt also acknowledges the aspen center for physics , where part of this work was performed .",
    "this work was supported by the national science foundation .",
    "closures truncate the moment hierarchy that is generated when averages are taken of nonlinear equations .",
