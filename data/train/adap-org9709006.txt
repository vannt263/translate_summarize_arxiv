    "however , the sequence of counts depicted in fig .  [ basics](c ) also contains much information about the process . here the time axis is divided into equally spaced contiguous counting windows of duration @xmath6 sec to produce a sequence of counts @xmath7 , where @xmath8 - n[kt]$ ] denotes the number of events in the @xmath9th window . as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ basics](d ) , this sequence forms a discrete - time random process of nonnegative integers .",
    "in general , information is lost in forming the sequence of counts , although for a regular point process the amount lost can be made arbitrarily small by reducing the size of the counting window @xmath6 .",
    "an attractive feature of this representation is that it preserves the correspondence between the discrete time axis of the counting process @xmath7 and the absolute `` real '' time axis of the underlying point process . within the process of counts @xmath7 , the elements @xmath10 and",

    "these processes therefore have integral generalized dimensions ( see sec .  [ othermeas ] ) and are consequently not true fractals .",

    "a multiple trapping model has been used to show how traps that are exponentially distributed over a large range of energies lead to a power - law decay of current in an amorphous semiconductor @xcite .",
    "if a pulse of light strikes such a semiconductor , the many carriers excited out of their traps will be available to carry current until they are recaptured , which happens relatively quickly . at some point each carrier will be released from its trap by thermal excitation and become mobile for a time , and then be recaptured by another trap . for exponentially distributed energy states with identical capture cross sections , the electrons tend to be trapped in shallow states at first , but the probability of being caught in a deep trap increases as time progresses .",
    "this leads to a current that decreases as a power - law function of time .",
    "the multiple trapping model may be usefully recast in terms of a standard fractal renewal process ( see sec .",
    "[ frp_def ] ) @xcite .",
    "consider an amorphous semiconductor with localized states ( traps ) with energies which are exponentially distributed with parameter @xmath31 between a minimum energy @xmath32 of the order of @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is boltzmann s constant and @xmath35 is the temperature in degrees kelvin ; and a maximum energy @xmath36 determined by the bandgap of the material .",
    "for a particular trap with energy @xmath37 , the corresponding mean waiting time to release is @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the average vibrational period of the atoms in the semiconductor .",
    "if we define characteristic time cutoffs @xmath40 and @xmath41 , and the power - law exponent @xmath42 , then the mean waiting time @xmath43 has a density which decays as a power law with this exponent between those two cutoffs .",
    "each trap holds carriers for times that are exponentially distributed given the conditional parameter @xmath43 , and averaging this exponential density over all possible values of @xmath43 yields the unconditional trapping time density , which is itself approximately power law : @xmath44 for @xmath45 .",
    "thus each carrier will be trapped for a period that is essentially power - law distributed .    upon escaping from a trap ,",
    "the carrier can conduct current for a short time until it is again captured by another trap .",
    "thus each carrier executes a series of current - carrying jumps well described by a standard frp . assuming that each carrier acts independently of the others , the action of the carriers as a whole can be modeled as the superposition of a collection of such component processes , which converges to the fractal - gaussian - noise driven poisson process ( fgndp ; see secs .  [ fgn ] and [ fdspp ] ) in the limit of a large number of carriers .",
    "again , both experimental @xcite and theoretical @xcite results point to a power - law or fractal decay in the power spectral density , while several other statistics also show scaling behavior .",
    "burst noise occurs in many communications systems and is characterized by relatively brief noise events which cluster together , separated by relatively longer periods of quiet .",
    "berger and mandelbrot @xcite long ago showed that burst errors in communication systems are well modeled by a version of a fractal renewal process ( see sec .",
    "[ frp_def ] ) , and in particular that the interevent times were essentially independent of each other for time scales determined by the resolution and the duration of the observation .",
    "moreover , the rate of traffic flow itself displays fractal fluctuations on a variety of high - speed packet - switching networks conducting different types of traffic @xcite .",
    "this has been demonstrated for time scales greater than about one sec in both the power spectral density and the fano factor ( see secs .",

    "ion channels reside in biological cell membranes , permitting ions to diffuse in or out @xcite .",
    "these channels are usually specific to a particular ion , or group of related ions , and block the passage of other kinds of ions .",
    "further , most channels have gates , and thus the channels may be either open or closed . in many instances ,",
    "intermediate conduction states are not observed .",
    "some ion channels may be modeled by a two - state markov process @xcite , with one state representing the open channel , and the other representing the closed channel .",
    "this model generates exponentially distributed dwell times in both states , which are , in fact , sometimes observed .",

    "communication in the nervous system is usually mediated by the exocytosis of multiple vesicular packets ( quanta ) of neurotransmitter molecules at the synapse between two cells , triggered by an action potential ( information - bearing signal ) at the presynaptic cell @xcite . even in the absence of an action potential ,",
    "however , many neurons spontaneously release individual packets of neurotransmitter @xcite .",
    "on arrival at the postsynaptic membrane , each neurotransmitter packet induces a miniature endplate current ( mepc ) ; superpositions of mepc - like events comprise the postsynaptic endplate currents elicited by nerve impulses arriving at the presynaptic cell @xcite .",
    "analysis of the sequence of mepc and mepc - like events in a variety of preparations reveals the presence of memory over a range of times and frequencies @xcite .",
    "the fractal - lognormal - noise driven poisson process model ( flndp ; see secs .",
    "[ fln ] and [ fdspp ] ) provides an excellent model for this process , for a variety of statistical measures @xcite .",
    "many biological neurons carry information in the form of sequences of action potentials , which are localized regions of depolarization traveling down the length of an axon .",
    "action potentials or neural spikes are brief and largely identical events and are well represented by a point process .",
    "the firing patterns of an isolated neuron and an isolated axons have been shown to have fractal characteristics .",
    "musha and colleagues generated a synthetic spike train consisting of electrical impulses separated by independent intervals drawn from the same gaussian distribution @xcite .",
    "this nonfractal stimulus as applied to one end of an excised squid giant axon ; the membrane voltage at the far end was considered to be the response spike train . the resulting power spectral density followed a @xmath46-type decay .",
    "spontaneous firing from an excised giant snail neuron yielded similar results @xcite , although for this preparation the data was selected to reduce fluctuations , and analyzed by interevent number rather than in real time .",
    "more recently , fractal behavior has been observed in the sequence of action potentials recorded from several _ in vivo _ vertebrate preparations .",
    "real - time recordings were made under both spontaneous and driven firing conditions . over short time",
    "scales , nonfractal stochastic point processes prove adequate for representing such nerve spikes , but over long time scales ( typically greater than one sec ) the fractal nature becomes evident @xcite .",
    "estimators of the rate of the process converge more slowly than for nonfractal processes , displaying fluctuations which decrease as a power - law function of the time used to estimate the rate @xcite . with the inclusion of the refractory effects of nerve fibers , frspp models have been shown to properly characterize the statistical properties of certain potentials in peripheral primary auditory fibers in several species , over all time scales and for a broad variety of statistical measures @xcite ; only four parameters are required .",
    "this process possibly arises from superpositions of fractal ion - channel transitions @xcite or by fractal vesicular exocytosis in inner - ear sensory cells , as described briefly in secs .",
    "[ ionch ] and  [ exocytosis ] , respectively .      many neurons in the mammalian visual system",
    "transmit information by means of action potentials as well , and frspps also provide suitable models for describing the behavior of these neurons @xcite .",
    "the gamma renewal process , which is nonfractal , has proven to be a useful model for some of these processes over short time scales @xcite . however , nerve spike trains recorded from both cat retinal - ganglion - cell and lateral - geniculate - nucleus neurons , like those recorded from primary auditory neurons , exhibit fractal behavior over time scales greater than about @xmath47 sec , thus necessitating the use of an frspp description @xcite .",
    "long - duration temporal correlation has also been observed in spike trains from cat striate - cortex neurons @xcite and from an insect visual interneuron @xcite .",
    "action - potential data collected from rabbit somatosensory cortical neurons and cat respiratory control neurons show experimental iih plots which decay as power laws @xcite .",
    "in addition , for the data lengths considered , serial correlation coefficients among interevent intervals from these data sets do not differ from zero in a statistically significant way .",
    "( however , differences may well emerge for longer data sets , as has been seen , for example , in auditory - nerve - fiber recordings @xcite . ) these two interevent - interval characteristics  independence and a power - law distribution  define the fractal renewal point process ( see sec .",

    "the cluster poisson point process ( see sec .  [ cluster ] ) has been used successfully to model mrf neural activity @xcite .",
    "furthermore , there is some evidence that these neurons have iihs whose tails decay in power - law fashion @xcite , so that a type of fspp may prove suitable for describing these spike trains .",
    "the sequence of human heartbeats exhibits considerable variability over time , both in the short - term and in the long - term patterns of the times between beats @xcite .",
    "a point process of the heartbeats is formed by focusing on the times between maximum contractions ( r - r intervals ) .",
    "a particular frspp with an integrate - and - fire substrate has been constructed and shown to successfully describe these events @xcite . as with auditory and visual - system spike trains , over short time scales nonfractal point processes provide suitable models for the pattern of times between contractions ; for times longer than roughly @xmath48 sec , only fractal models suffice .",
    "interestingly , parameters of the frspp used to model the data indicate promise for the diagnosis of various disease states of the heart @xcite .",
    "as the examples described above illustrate , many phenomena are amenable to modeling by frspps .",
    "the value of the fractal exponent @xmath0 can often provide important information regarding the nature of an underlying process , and can also serve as a useful classification tool in some cases , as with human heartbeat data as mentioned in section  [ heartbeat ] .",
    "accordingly , it is desirable to estimate @xmath0 reliably , although this task is often confounded by a variety of issues @xcite .",
    "here we briefly review some of the techniques used for estimating @xmath0 . by way of illustration",
    ", we apply these methods to a train of action potentials recorded from a lateral - geniculate - nucleus ( lgn ) relay neuron in the cat visual system .",
    "there are 24285 events in this particular spike train , with an average interevent interval of 0.133 sec , comprising a total duration of 3225 sec @xcite .",
    "the interevent - interval histogram ( iih ) , an estimate of the interval probability function , and the generalized dimension ( gd ) @xcite , are useful measures for fractal stochastic point processes , and in particular for the fractal renewal process ( see sec .",
    "[ frp_def ] ) .",
    "the iih is simply the relative frequency of interevent - interval occurrence in the data set , ignoring all correlations among the intervals .    since realizations of fspps form true fractals , all measures considered in this paper , including the iih , exhibit scaling for these processes .",
    "thus the iih proves useful in elucidating the fractal nature of fspps . for frspps ,",
    "on the other hand , the fractal structure is not manifested in first - order interevent - time statistics , so that the iih does not scale over a significant range of interevent times .",
    "rather , the fractal character of these processes lie in the dependencies among the interevent intervals , which are captured by the measures considered in secs .",
    "[ crsec][afest ] .",
    "the generalized dimension is of interest for fractal stochastic point processes . if a data segment of length @xmath49 is divided into intervals of length @xmath6 , with @xmath50 representing the number of points in the @xmath9th interval ( see fig .",

    "particular cases are the capacity or box - counting dimension @xmath53 , the information dimension @xmath54 , and the correlation dimension @xmath55 .",
    "the sum is a form of time averaging ; for a stochastic point process , it is convenient to replace the sum by the product of @xmath56 and the expected value of @xmath57 . for a fractal - rate point process , however , analytical values of the @xmath51 will not in general equal analytical values of the dimensions obtained from the pg or af , and in fact the @xmath51 will often assume integer values ( see sec .",

    "a stationary , regular point process with a cr following this form for _ all _ delay times @xmath43 exhibits infinite mean .",
    "further , statistics of fractal data sets collected from experiments exhibit scaling only over a finite range of times and frequencies , as determined by the resolution of the experimental apparatus and the duration of the experiment . nevertheless , in much of the following we employ eq .",
    "( [ fractalcr ] ) without cutoffs since we find that the cutoffs do not significantly affect the mathematical results in many cases .",
    "we employ similar ideal forms for other second - order measures defined later in this paper for the same reasons .",
    "the coincidence rate can be directly estimated from its definition . however , in practice the cr is a noisy measure , since its definition essentially involves a double derivative .",
    "furthermore , for fspps and frspps typical of physical and biological systems , the cr exceeds its asymptotic value @xmath66 by only a small fraction at any large but practical value of @xmath43 , so that determining the fractal exponent with this small excess presents serious difficulties .",
    "therefore we do not specifically apply this measure to the lgn data , although the formal definition of coincidence rate plays a useful role in developing other , more reliable measures .",
    "the power spectral density ( psd ) is a familiar and well - established measure for continuous - time processes . for point",
    "processes the psd and the cr introduced above form a fourier transform pair , much like the psd and the autocorrelation function do for continuous - time processes .",

    "this method introduces a bias at higher frequencies , since the fine time resolution information is lost as a result of the minimum count - window size . nevertheless ,",
    "since estimating the fractal exponent principally involves lower frequencies where this bias is negligible , and employing the sequence of counts permits the use of vastly more efficient fast fourier transform methods , we prefer this technique . alternate definitions of the psd for point processes ( and thus for the pg used to estimate them ) exist ; for example , a different psd may be obtained from the real - valued discrete - time sequence of the interevent intervals .",
    "however , features in this psd can not be interpreted in terms of temporal frequency @xcite .",
    "figure  [ vispp ] displays the pg for the visual system lgn data calculated using the count - based approach . throughout the text of this paper",
    "we employ radian frequency @xmath70 ( radians per unit time ) to simplify the analysis , while figures are plotted in common frequency @xmath71 ( cycles per unit time ) in accordance with common usage . for low frequencies ,",

    "another measure of correlation over different time scales is provided by the fano factor ( ff ) , which is the variance of the number of events in a specified counting time @xmath6 divided by the mean number of events in that counting time .",
    "this measure is sometimes called the index of dispersion of counts @xcite . in terms of the sequence of counts illustrated in fig .",

    "having considered various possible theoretical sources of error in simulating frspps with a desired fractal exponent , we now proceed to investigate their effects upon fractal exponent estimates based on the power spectral density and allan factor measures . to this end",
    "we employ simulations of three of the frspps outlined above : fgn driving a deterministic integrate - and - fire process ( fgnif ) , fgn driving an if process followed by gaussian jitter of the interevent intervals ( fgnjif ) , and fgn driving a poisson process ( fgndp ) .",
    "we choose these three processes from the collection presented in sec .",
    "[ mathform ] for a number of reasons .",
    "first , the fgnif , fgnjif , and fgndp derive from a common continuous - time rate process , fractal gaussian noise ( fgn ) , and thus differences among these point processes must lie in the point - process generation mechanism rather than in the fractal rate processes .",

    "third , of all the frspps examined in sec .",
    "[ mathform ] , those based on the fgn appear to suffer the least from the effects of cutoffs , so that expected values of the pg and the af most closely follow the pure power - law forms of eqs .",
    "( [ fractalpsd ] ) and  ( [ fractalaf ] ) respectively .    to generate the rate function with @xmath174 spectral properties , we computed discrete - time approximations to fractal gaussian noise ( fgn ) by forming a conjugate - symmetric sequence @xmath175 $ ] of @xmath176 samples which satisfies @xmath177\\right|=\\left\\ { \\begin{array}{ll } m \\rho & \\mbox{for $ k=0$}\\\\ c k^{-\\alpha/2 } & \\mbox{for $ 1\\leq k \\leq m/2 $ } , \\end{array } \\right.\\ ] ] where",
    "@xmath178 $ ] is the desired average value of the fgn process , and @xmath20 is a constant determining the relative strength of the fgn .",
    "the phases of @xmath175 $ ] were independent and uniformly distributed in the interval @xmath179 for @xmath180 , while both @xmath181 $ ] and @xmath182 $ ] were strictly real .",
    "a discrete - time sequence @xmath183 $ ] was obtained by taking the inverse discrete fourier transform of @xmath175 $ ] .",
    "the resulting fgn process is periodic with period @xmath176 , so to reduce the effects of this periodicity we employ only the first half of the sequence .",
    "specifically , we used an original sequence @xmath183 $ ] of length @xmath184 points and kept the first @xmath185 samples as @xmath186 $ ] . further , since rate functions must not attain negative values , we chose the mean value of the fgn , @xmath187 , sufficiently large compared to the relative strength of the fgn @xmath20 to ensure that @xmath186 $ ] remained positive for all @xmath188 different values of @xmath186 $ ] in all simulations .",
    "in particular for @xmath29 this was adjusted by choosing the ff intercept time @xmath80 to be 10 times the average interevent time , while for @xmath102 the psd fractal onset frequency @xmath68 was chosen to be @xmath189 times the average rate @xmath187 .",
    "the resultant sequence @xmath186 $ ] was taken to represent equally spaced samples of a continuous - time process ; to simplify subsequent analysis , we chose the duration of each sample to be one sec , without loss of generality .",
    "varying the mean event production rate @xmath187 while keeping all other parameters fixed ( or in fixed relation to @xmath187 , as with the ff intercept time and psd corner frequency ) resulted in point processes which contained varying expected numbers of events .",
    "in particular , we employed values of @xmath190 and @xmath191 events per sample of @xmath186 $ ] , leading to a range of roughly @xmath192 to @xmath193 events in the resulting point process .",
    "the following procedures were employed to compute the estimates described in sec .",
    "[ analysis ] . for the pg ,",
    "the absolute event times were quantized into @xmath194 bins , which therefore formed a rate estimate of the process with counting windows having a duration of @xmath195 sec .",
    "then a discrete fourier transform was performed , followed by replacing the fourier components with their square magnitudes .",
    "finally , a least - squares fit was performed on the logarithm of these quantities vs.  the logarithm of the frequencies @xmath13 for various selected ranges of frequencies .",
    "these slopes form pg - based estimates of the fractal exponent .",
    "estimates of the af were calculated over a range of counting times @xmath6 in a geometric sequence with ten counting times per decade .",
    "the slopes of the af estimate were again obtained from linear least - squares fits to the logarithm of the af values vs.  the logarithm of the size of the counting time @xmath6 ; these slopes became the af - based estimates of the fractal exponent .",
    "as indicated in sec .",
    "[ af : bias ] , finite data lengths do not impart extraneous bias to the af - based estimates .",
    "for each type of frspp and value of @xmath187 employed , 100 simulations were performed for each of three different design values of the fractal exponent : @xmath196 , 0.8 , and 1.5 ; af and pg curves were computed for each simulation .",
    "estimates of the fractal exponent were obtained by two methods for each of these two measures . in the first",
    ", all 100 af or pg curves were averaged together , after which the doubly logarithmic slope of this average curve was computed , yielding a single estimate of the fractal exponent . the second method consisted of first obtaining the doubly logarithmic slopes of the individual af or pg curves , and then averaging these slopes .",
    "this second method yields the mean fractal exponent as well as the standard deviation ( and other possible statistics of the fractal exponent ) .    as shown in sec .",

    "this rate function is integrated until the result attains a value of unity , whereupon an output point is generated and the integrator is reset to zero . the generation of the continuous rate function from the piecewise - constant fgn does not significantly change the observed fractal structure of the resulting point process . for frequencies less than the inverse of the sampling time @xmath6 ( 1 hz in this example ) , the psds of the piecewise - constant and exact versions of fgn differ by a factor of @xmath197 ; fractal behavior depends on low frequencies ( @xmath198 ) where the above factor is essentially unity . since the fgnif process has just one source of randomness , namely the underlying fgn , the estimators for the fractal exponent should therefore display only the ( fractal ) behavior of the fgn itself , along with finite - size effects .",
    "bias or variance due to a second source of randomness , such as the poisson transform in the fgndp , will not be present .",
    "thus for our purposes the fgnif process serves as a benchmark for the accuracy of fractal exponent estimators , with a bias and variance depending only on finite data size effects and not on the rate @xmath187 .",
    "the results for the fgnif process with a rate @xmath199 and three different fractal exponents ( @xmath0=0.2 , 0.8 and 1.5 ) are summarized for the af in table  [ tabgau01 ] and for the pg in table  [ tabgau02 ] .    .",

    "the estimated fractal exponents were obtained from straight - line fits on doubly logarithmic coordinates to an average curve of 100 independent simulations ( fit of avg . ) and from averages of the slopes of the individual curves ( avg .  of fits ) .",

    "@xmath203 and @xmath141 , the result is essentially white noise and the estimated fractal exponent will be zero .",
    "best results for the fgnif were obtained with the af - based fractal - exponent estimator using counting times in the range @xmath204 ; this yielded root - mean - square error results which were accurate to within @xmath205 for all design values of @xmath0 ( tables [ tabgau01 ] and [ rmse ] ) .",
    "for both the af- and pg - based estimators , performance degraded at longer times and smaller frequencies ( tables [ tabgau01 ] , [ tabgau02 ] , and [ rmse ] ) .",
    "finite - duration effects in the pg and relatively few counting windows in the af produce significant error over these scales .",
    "the rms error remained near @xmath206 for both estimators , over all design values of the fractal exponent , and over all time and frequency ranges examined .",
    "the fgnjif and fgndp processes impose a second source of randomness on the fractal behavior of the fgn kernel .",
    "this additional randomness is essentially uncorrelated , and thus may be modeled as the linear superposition of white noise on the original fractal signal ; this affects the shapes of both the af and the pg . as this white - noise level increases",
    ", it dilutes the fractal structure present in the fgn process , beginning at the shortest time scales and moving progressively towards longer ones .",
    "this effect reduces the range of times and frequencies over which fractal behavior appears , resulting in a decreased estimated fractal exponent .",
    "this proved most significant for larger design values of @xmath0 , and for the estimator based on the pg .",
    "indeed , magnitudes of the bias exceeded @xmath201 in one case .",
    "the af - based estimator fared significantly better , although in this case it employed counting times which were five times the inverse of the frequencies used for the pg .",
    "these results compare favorably to earlier studies using the same number of events @xcite , for which inaccuracies of @xmath206 or larger were obtained for a variety of fractal stochastic point processes , all of which included a second source of randomness .",
    "this study considered data sets with an average of @xmath207 points ; experimental data may contain far fewer points , and thus yield poorer fractal - exponent estimation statistics .",
    "in particular , finite - size effects , which lead to increased bias for the pg - based estimator and increased variance for the af - based estimator will reduce the ranges of times and frequencies over which reliable estimation can be achieved .",
    "similarly , data sets with larger numbers of points ( computer network traffic , for example ) would yield superior performance .",
    "in addition , if several independent data sets are available , known to be from identical experiments , then the af plots or the resulting estimates could be averaged , reducing the effective variance . in this case , the reduced bias in the af - based estimator would render it far superior to that based on the pg .",
    "finally we mention that there exist several methods for reducing the bias of the fractal exponent estimates if one has some _ a priori _ knowledge of the process of interest .",
    "such an approach however does not follow the philosophy of estimating a completely unknown signal and we therefore did not attempt to compensate for the bias by the use of such methods .",
    "we have investigated the properties of fractal and fractal - rate stochastic point processes ( fspps and frspps ) , focusing on the estimation of measures that reveal their fractal exponents .",
    "the fractal - gaussian - noise driven integrate - and - fire process ( fgnif ) is unique as a point process in that it exhibits no short - term randomness ; we have developed a generalization which includes jitter , the fgnjif , for which the short - term randomness is fully adjustable .",
    "in addition to the randomness contributed by the fractal nature of the rate , all other frspps appear to exhibit additional randomness associated with point generation , which confounds the accuracy of fractal - exponent estimation .",
    "the fgnjif proved crucial in elucidating the role that such randomness plays in the estimation of fractal exponents in other frspps .",
    "we presented analytical results for the expected biases of the pg- and af - based fractional exponent estimators due to finite data length .",
    "we followed this theoretical work with a series of simulations of frspps for three representative fractal exponents : @xmath196 , @xmath201 , and @xmath202 . using these simulations together with the analytical predictions , we delineated the sources of error involved in estimating fractal exponents . in particular",
    ", using the fgnjif we were able to separate those factors intrinsic to estimation over finite frspp data sets from those due to the particular form of frspp involved .",
    "we conclude that the af - based estimate proves more reliable in estimating the fractal exponent than the pg - based method , yielding rms errors of @xmath205 for data segments of frspps with @xmath207 points over all values of @xmath0 examined .",

    "<S> fractal and fractal - rate stochastic point processes ( fspps and frspps ) provide useful models for describing a broad range of diverse phenomena , including electron transport in amorphous semiconductors , computer - network traffic , and sequences of neuronal action potentials . </S>",
    "<S> a particularly useful statistic of these processes is the fractal exponent @xmath0 , which may be estimated for any fspp or frspp by using a variety of statistical methods . </S>",
    "<S> simulated fspps and frspps consistently exhibit bias in this fractal exponent , however , rendering the study and analysis of these processes non - trivial . in this paper , we examine the synthesis and estimation of frspps by carrying out a systematic series of simulations for several different types of frspp over a range of design values for @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> the discrepancy between the desired and achieved values of @xmath0 is shown to arise from finite data size and from the character of the point - process generation mechanism . in the context of point - process simulation , </S>",
    "<S> reduction of this discrepancy requires generating data sets with either a large number of points , or with low jitter in the generation of the points . in the context of fractal data analysis , the results presented here suggest caution when interpreting fractal exponents estimated from experimental data sets </S>"
