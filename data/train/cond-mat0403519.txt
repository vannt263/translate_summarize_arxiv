    "then the conditions should be carried out @xmath313 for a twofold polaron existence .",
    "it is easy to see that to @xmath40 one twofold polaron ( designated by the letter @xmath102 ) corresponds .",
    "two twofold polarons @xmath314 and @xmath309 correspond to @xmath315 ( i.e. @xmath316 ) , three double polarons @xmath317 and @xmath318 correspond to @xmath319 ( i.e. @xmath320 ) , et cetera .    in fig.1 polarons , located to the left of @xmath321 are not designated . above of twofold polarons threefold polarons are located , appropriate to crossing of three terms , more higher fourfold polarons are located and so on .",
    "number of polarons of each sort is equal @xmath311 at given @xmath322 .",
    "threefold polarons in bulk crystals are considered for the first time in [ 28 ] , in qws - in [ 29 - 31 ] .",
    "let us note that for crossing three and more terms in one point the equidistance of landau levels is necessary . in order the theory",
    "[ 31 ] of threefold polarons should be applicable , it is necessary that the amendments to energy , caused by non - parabolicity of bands or by excitonic effect , should be less than splitting of terms .",
    "but in case of twofold polarons infringement of parabolisity is not an obstacle , since crossing of two terms all the same exists .",
    "all above mentioned polarons correspond to the integer @xmath311 .",
    "besides in fig.1 there are other crossings of lines with quantum number @xmath306 ( continuous lines ) , designated by empty circles .",
    "they correspond to fractional @xmath311 .",
    "as the terms crossed in these points are characterized by @xmath323 , real direct transitions between them with emitting of one phonon are impossible .",
    "let us name such polarons as weak polarons . as the terms are crossed , their splitting is inevitable , but for calculation of splitting we need to take into account transitions between crossing terms through virtual intermediate states or to take into account the small two - phonon contributions in the operator of electron - phonon interaction . in result",
    "splittings @xmath324 of terms in case of weak polarons should be much less , than in a case of integer @xmath311 .",
    "the contributions of transitions through intermediate states in @xmath325 are of more high order than @xmath326 on the frhlich dimensionless coupling constant @xmath327 .    at the account of two or more values of size",
    "quantization quantum number @xmath306 the picture of crossing of terms becomes considerably complicated . besides usual polarons , appropriate to a level @xmath328 ( for example polaron @xmath329 ) , occur `` combined '' polarons for which the electron - phonon interaction connects two electronic levels with different numbers @xmath306",
    ". the landau quantum numbers may coincide or be different [ 32,33 ] .",
    "in fig.1 for an example three terms concerning to quantum number @xmath330 ( dot - and - dash lines ) and a position of two combined polarons @xmath331 and @xmath332 are shown . in fig.1",
    "it would be necessary to carry out more dot - and - dash lines and to obtain the greater number of combined polarons .",
    "however , it would strongly complicate figure . for an example in fig.1 the polaron @xmath333",
    "is designated , which is combined and weak .",
    "interesting feature of combined polarons is that that the appropriate resonant values of magnetic fields depend on distance @xmath334 between size quantized levels @xmath306 and @xmath328 and hence on qw depth and width .",
    "really , with the help of fig.1 it is easily to obtain @xmath335 one more kind of combined polarons [ 32 ] is not represented in fig.1 , as it exists only under the condition @xmath336 when , for example , terms @xmath337 and @xmath338 coincide at any magnitudes of a magnetic field . for performance of the resonant condition ( 109 )",
    "a certain distance between levels @xmath306 and @xmath328 is required , what may be reached only by selection of the qw width and depth .    in order the picture of fig.1 should be applicable",
    "it is necessary that the distances between the neighbour levels @xmath339 should be much more , than @xmath92 of polaron splittings .",
    "since the distances between levels decrease with growth of the qw width @xmath12 , the restriction from above on @xmath12 is imposed ( numerical estimations see in [ 34 ] ( fig.2 and 3 ) . ) .",
    "it follows from above mentioned classification of magnetopolarons that the technique of calculation of light reflection and absorption stated in section 7 is inapplicable only to combined polarons in a qw , since in case of twofold combined polarons in each of polaron states @xmath340 or @xmath341 the states with different numbers @xmath306 and @xmath328 of size quantization `` are mixed '' and as a result the expression ( 8) is inapplicable . to all other twofold polarons - usual ( black circles ) and weakened ( empty circles ) basic formulas ( 84 ) and ( 85 ) are applicable .    as excitation 1 a pair consisting from a hole and a state @xmath340 of polaron appears , as excitation 2 a pair of a hole and state @xmath341 appears .",
    "in narrow qws characterized by an inequality @xmath253 , light interacts only with those pairs for which the size quantization numbers coincide , i.e. @xmath342 . let us name a creation of such ehps by permitted transitions . for wider qws ( when @xmath343 ) forbidden transitions , for which @xmath344 , appear .    since energies @xmath345 and @xmath346 , determined in ( 21 ) , depend on numbers @xmath306 , permitted transitions with indexes @xmath347 and @xmath348 are separated on frequency on the value @xmath349 for example , for @xmath36 , using parameters [ 26 ] @xmath350 and qw width @xmath351 , we obtain @xmath352    for wide qws in an interval between the permitted transitions @xmath353 and @xmath354 there are two forbidden transitions at @xmath355 on distance @xmath356 from transition @xmath347 and at @xmath355 on distance @xmath357 from transition @xmath347 . to each of transitions at resonant value @xmath358",

    "comparative intensity of reflection and absorption for cases permitted and forbidden transitions is shown in fig.3 - 5 .",
    "same that in fig.3 under condition @xmath359 . ]",
    "let us show still numerical estimations . in [ 34 ] the values @xmath360 of polaron splittings are calculated for some sorts of ordinary double polarons ( see fig.1 ) and some substances of qws and barriers .",
    "dependencies @xmath92 on a qw width @xmath12 are constructed .    at @xmath12 from @xmath361",
    "up to @xmath362 @xmath363 for @xmath347 and @xmath348 .",

    "two forbidden transitions @xmath368 and @xmath369 is represented ; results for two forbidden transitions precisely coincide , since according to ( 9 ) and ( 10 ) the function @xmath370 does not vary at replacement of an index @xmath74 by @xmath75 and vice verse . at @xmath371",
    "the non - radiative damping @xmath372 , but their values are unknown , in [ 21 ] an attempt is made only to estimate these values from below .",
    "same that in fig.4 under condition @xmath359 . ]",
    "fig.3 corresponds approximately to above mentioned numerical estimations @xmath92 and @xmath373 at @xmath371 .",
    "two arbitrary values @xmath374 are used : @xmath375 and @xmath376 , both of them exceed @xmath377 .",
    "so fig.3 corresponds to a case @xmath378 .",
    "it is visible that @xmath379 and @xmath380 for permitted and for forbidden transitions .    comparing the used polaron splittings @xmath381 and @xmath382 for fig.3 we find that @xmath188 is two orders less than @xmath381 .",
    "but it is right only for usual twofold polarons ( black circles in fig.1 ) . in case of weak polarons ( the empty circles ) polaron splittings",
    "are much smaller .",

    "in both cases @xmath389 and @xmath390 for a permitted transition on figs.7 , 8 we obtain results appropriate to ( 99 ) , i.e. equal to zero reflection in a point @xmath391 and total reflection @xmath392 in points @xmath288 and @xmath393 , which position depends on a qw width .    to the forbidden transition in figs.7 , 8 at @xmath394",

    "results are compared with what were obtained earlier in [ 21 ] for narrow qws ( which width is much less than a light waves length ) .",
    "firstly , it is shown that if a light wave length is comparable to a qw width , height and form of peaks of reflection @xmath402 and absorption @xmath403 begin to depend on a qw width .",

    "exist two points @xmath288 and @xmath407 of total reflection ( @xmath408 ) and one point @xmath409 between them of total transmission ( @xmath410 ) .",
