    "<S> while we have a concept of temperature for energy conservation , there is no equivalent chemical potential for particle number conservation . </S>",
    "<S> however , the notion of a chemical potential is crucial in understanding a wide variety of single- and many - body effects , from transport in conductors and semiconductors to phase transitions in electronic and atomic systems . </S>",
    "<S> here we show how a direct modification of the system - bath coupling via parametric oscillation creates an effective chemical potential for photons even in the thermodynamic limit . </S>",
    "<S> specific implementations , using circuit - qed or optomechanics , are feasible using current technologies , and we show a detailed example demonstrating the emergence of mott insulator - superfluid transition in a lattice of nonlinear oscillators . </S>",
    "<S> our approach paves the way for quantum simulation , quantum sources , and even electron - like circuits with light . </S>"
