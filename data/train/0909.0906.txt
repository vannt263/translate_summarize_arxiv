    "a major achievement of the theory of probability are the limit theorems @xcite , which provide the basis to explain statistical regularities observed in large classes of natural , economical and social mass - scale phenomena .",
    "these theorems describe the mechanisms leading to universal forms of scaling for the probability density functions ( pdf s ) of sums of many independent random variables",
    ". the scaling can be normal , or anomalous , depending on whether the pdf s of the individual variables possess finite second moment , or not . however , independence is not guaranteed in general , and a large number of collective phenomena in nature exhibit anomalous scaling @xcite as a consequence of correlations . in such cases ,",
    "if the pdf of the sum of the elementary variables and its argument are simultaneously rescaled by a power @xmath0 of the number of summands , it asymptotically converges to a scaling function @xmath1 which is not necessarily gaussian nor lvy , and the scaling exponent @xmath0 is in general not equal to @xmath2 .",
    "thus , an open challenge remains that of establishing limit theorems able to justify the existence and the universality of the anomalous scaling forms occurring in the case of strongly correlated variables .",
    "the renormalization group approach to critical phenomena in statistical physics @xcite has led to developments in probability theory which point towards a solution of this problem .",
    "indeed , the fixed - point condition for block - spin transformations can be regarded @xcite as a substitute of the stability condition at the basis of the limit theorems for the independent case @xcite .",
    "for instance , in the context of hierarchical equilibrium spin models the fixed - points of these block - spin transformations are expected to attract whole domains of strongly correlated critical systems displaying asymptotically the same universal form of anomalous scaling @xcite .",
    "however , unlike in the case of the limit theorems for independent variables , classes of admissible universal scaling forms and their universality domains are not easily identified .",
    "since the standard limit theorems hold in force of the multiplicative structure of the joint pdf s of independent variables , an attempt has been recently made by the present authors @xcite to establish theorems on the basis of a generalization of the multiplication operation , leading to dependent joint probability densities . yet ,",
    "due to mathematical difficulties , the problem of constructing consistent joint pdf s for correlated variables whose sum asymptotically satisfies scaling was not addressed @xcite .",
    "correlated random variables often considered in probability theory are those in exchangeable sequences @xcite .",
    "the joint pdf s of an arbitrary number of variables in an exchangeable sequence have the property of being invariant under permutations of their arguments .",
    "exchangeability was introduced by de finetti @xcite , and is of paramount importance in the bayesian approach to probability and statistics @xcite .",
    "it is already known that , thanks to the simplifying feature of exchangeability , central limit theorems can be established @xcite .",
    "the scalings foreseen by these theorems for the pdf of the sum of the random variables involve scaling functions which are convex combinations ( mixtures ) of gaussians . for @xmath0",
    "only two values could be considered .",
    "if the variables are linearly uncorrelated , i.e. , correlations are nonzero only for nonlinear functions of the variables , the scaling exponent is the ordinary @xmath3 @xcite . alternatively ,",
    "if the variables are correlated also at linear level , limit theorems have been proved for @xmath4 @xcite .    inspired by ideas from the modern theory of critical phenomena , in the present article we establish limit theorems for sums of @xmath5 dependent random variables",
    "whose joint pdf s , upon increasing @xmath5 , do not define sequences of random variables , in general . with those defining exchangeable variable sequences , our joint pdf s only share the property of being invariant under permutations of their arguments . to illustrate how pdf s with such properties can arise in physics , we discuss the example of a permutationally invariant description of a magnetic system .",
    "the novel theorems apply to anomalous scalings with general exponent @xmath0 .",
    "they also enable the explicit construction of universality domains , i.e. of whole classes of sequences of joint pdf s sharing asymptotically the same scaling form for the sum of the variables .    the limit theorems proved here have implications also outside the context of variables with permutationally invariant joint pdf s .",
    "indeed , they were inspired by a recent proposal for the description of the time evolutions of financial indexes as stochastic processes @xcite .",
    "when dealing with such processes , one often considers time series in which each term represents the increment of an additive collective variable in an elementary time interval .",
    "examples are the displacement in diffusion , or the logarithmic return of a financial asset . in these cases , causality imposes that the successive increments must constitute a sequence of random variables , in which the statistical properties of each variable are independent of the successive ones . when the increments are correlated and the processes have the property of self - similarity , i.e. when the collective variable distribution obeys scaling not just asymptotically , but for any finite number of summands , there are some requirements whose satisfaction has to be imposed to the joint pdf s of the successive increments .",
    "an heuristic way of satisfying these requirements was recently proposed as a basis for a stochastic model of the dynamics of financial indexes @xcite . as we show in this work , the heuristic proposal in @xcite",
    "is fully justified on the basis of the novel notion of stability implied by our theorems .    in general our stochastic processes",
    "are non - stationary and the scaling has a time - inhomogeneous nature @xcite . when they become stationary , their increments also constitute sequences of exchangeable random variables . in such cases",
    "it is not possible to reproduce the statistics of these variables by empirical time - averages along infinitely long , single realizations of the processes .",
    "this is due to a mechanism of _ ergodicity breaking _ implied by de finetti s representation theorem @xcite . a way out of this difficulty",
    "is found when considering self - similarity as a property of the process valid within a limited , although possibly large , range of time - scales .",
    "this attitude is fully legitimate in many applications @xcite .",
    "we show here , by a dynamical simulation strategy of wide use in finance @xcite , how ergodicity can be restored in the process , by requiring scale - invariance to hold only up to a finite upper cutoff in time .",
    "this article is organized as follows . in the next three sections ,",
    "we introduce the formalism and present our main results about the limit theorems .",
    "we enunciate these theorems and give full details of their derivations in the appendix . after stressing the applicability of our approach to the forms of anomalous scaling emerging , e.g. , in the context of critical phenomena , in sections [ section_nm_ss_processes ] and [ section_restoring ] we discuss implications of our results for the theory of stochastic processes .",
    "in particular , we present a class of non - markovian self - similar processes possessing the requisites recently postulated @xcite for the case of finance and allowing explicit analytical calculations and efficient simulation strategies . the last section is devoted to conclusions .",
    "let us consider , for any given @xmath6 , a set of random variables , @xmath7 , with @xmath8 , taking values @xmath9 on the real axis .",
    "we call @xmath10 the joint pdf of @xmath5-th set of variables and , to start with , assume that for any @xmath5 this function is invariant under arbitrary permutations of its arguments .",
    "it should be stressed that , e.g. , the random variable @xmath11 belonging to a set with @xmath5 variables and the @xmath11 belonging to another set with @xmath12 variables are not identical , in general .",
    "thus , in principle we should denote the variables in the @xmath5-th set by @xmath13 , @xmath8 , and their values by @xmath14 .",
    "however , in order to keep formulas simple , we will not adopt this notation .",
    "ultimately the identity of each variable @xmath7 will be specified by the joint pdf @xmath15 used in order to evaluate its statistical properties . in this way",
    ", our formulas will conform to the standards of the statistical mechanics literature @xcite . to further simplify the formalism we can require , without loss of generality , that for any @xmath5 all the variables have zero average , @xmath16 @xmath17 , where @xmath18 . for the sum @xmath19 , whose pdf is @xmath20 this also implies @xmath21 .",
    "we are interested in cases in which the sequence @xmath22 , @xmath23 is such that @xmath24 satisfies anomalous scaling for @xmath25 , i.e. @xmath26 where @xmath1 is a scaling function , and @xmath0 is a scaling dimension . we want to identify whole domains of @xmath27 s such that the @xmath24 satisfies eq .",
    "( [ eq_scaling ] ) with a given @xmath1 and a given @xmath0 . besides the kind of convergence , the class of admissible @xmath1 s and the range of @xmath0 s needs to be specified .",
    "as we discuss below , examples of @xmath24 s such that eq.([eq_scaling ] ) holds are easily found in statistical physics .",
    "we first clarify why the exponent values @xmath3 and @xmath4 naturally arise for sequences of exchangeable variables .",
    "let us suppose that @xmath28 is finite for any @xmath5 . since permutational invariance implies @xmath29 @xmath17 , and @xmath30 @xmath31 , one has @xmath32 on the other hand , if , as appropriate for sequences of random variables , the sequence of joint pdf s @xmath33 is constructed consistently with the condition @xmath34 where @xmath35 , it is clear that @xmath36 and @xmath37 do not depend on @xmath5 .",
    "since according to the scaling condition in eq .",
    "( [ eq_scaling ] ) @xmath38 , eq .",
    "( [ eq_2nd_mom ] ) implies that either @xmath3 and @xmath39 , or @xmath4 and @xmath40 . in the former case ,",
    "further restrictions on the averages of products of @xmath41 s apply if higher moments of @xmath42 are assumed to exist .",
    "we should stress that if eq.([eq_reduced ] ) is satisfied by the sequence of permutation - invariant joint pdf s , then these pdf s in turn define a sequence of exchangeable variables .",
    "indeed , eq.([eq_reduced ] ) guarantees that a given variable , say @xmath11 , is strictly the same random variable , independent of the set of @xmath5 variables within which it is considered .    as discussed in section [ section_permutation ] , there are cases , for example in statistical mechanics , where one considers a system in equilibrium at a given temperature , so that @xmath33 represents the canonical joint pdf of @xmath5 variables describing the degrees of freedom of the system . since @xmath33 is expressed as a ratio between the gibbsian weight and the partition sum , upon integrating @xmath33 over one of the @xmath5 variables , as a rule we do not obtain the joint pdf of a system in equilibrium at the same temperature and with just @xmath43 variables .",
    "indeed , tracing over one of the variables leads to effective interactions which are not present in the hamiltonian for @xmath43 variables .",
    "the modern theory of critical phenomena shows that the renormalization effects determining this difference lead to anomalous scaling at the critical point @xcite .",
    "this circumstance , which is expected to occur in many cooperative phenomena , will allow us to derive limit theorems for sums of exchangeable variables with general values of @xmath0 .",
    "on the other hand , in problems where @xmath5 represents the number of increments over successive time intervals of a stochastic process and @xmath44 and @xmath33 are respectively the joint pdf s of the first @xmath43 and @xmath5 increments , causality imposes to consider sequences of @xmath33 s satisfying eq .",
    "( [ eq_reduced ] ) .",
    "below we will also show how the stability conditions implied by our limit theorems allow to define sequences of random variables whose joint pdf s satisfy eq.([eq_reduced ] ) and whose aggregated increment @xmath42 satisfies anomalous scaling exactly for any @xmath5 .",
    "we report our main statements and their mathematical proofs in the appendix . here",
    "we rather choose to illustrate the meaning and some implications of our results .",
    "let us first consider @xmath33 of the form @xmath45 where @xmath46 and @xmath47 are single - variable pdf s . with no loss of generality we require @xmath48 , whereas we assume @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "the higher integer moments of @xmath47 , are left arbitrary . clearly , the @xmath33 in eq .",
    "( [ eq_joint_1 ] ) is a positive density normalized to @xmath51 , and invariant under permutations of its arguments .",
    "the @xmath7 s are dependent , since @xmath33 does not simply factorize into a product of single variable pdf s .",
    "the choice of considering @xmath33 s which are convex combinations of products of single - variable pdf s is motivated by the fact that in this way it is possible to demonstrate the existence of asymptotic scalings with very general scaling functions .",
    "indeed , in the appendix we show that with the joint pdf in eq .",
    "( [ eq_joint_1 ] ) , @xmath24 satisfies eq .",
    "( [ eq_scaling ] ) with a scaling exponent @xmath52 .",
    "the scaling function @xmath1 is determined by @xmath46 . for @xmath3 @xmath1",
    "is given by @xmath53}{\\sqrt{2\\pi } } , \\label{eq_g_lambda}\\ ] ] whereas @xmath1 coincides with @xmath46 itself if @xmath54 .",
    "in both cases , upon varying @xmath46 the scaling function @xmath1 assumes general shapes .",
    "for instance , it may have several local and global maxima and power law decays to zero at large positive @xmath55 , and/or @xmath56 , as required in many applications .    as anticipated above ,",
    "when the variables @xmath7 s are dependent and do not constitute a sequence , it is legitimate to introduce in the definition of @xmath33 the @xmath5-dependence arising from the fact that @xmath57 enters divided by @xmath58 . in particular",
    ", precisely this dependence implies that the joint pdf of a system with @xmath43 variables , @xmath44 , rather than satisfying eq .",
    "( [ eq_reduced ] ) , is linked to @xmath33 by the relation : @xmath59    consistently with the fact that the @xmath7 s are not constituting a sequence of random variables , the marginal pdf of each individual @xmath7 , @xmath60 depends clearly on @xmath5 ( @xmath61 ) .",
    "so , if the second moment of @xmath46 is finite , one realizes that @xmath62 has a finite width for @xmath63 when @xmath64 .",
    "if @xmath65 , this width diverges in the large @xmath5 limit .",
    "such a divergence makes full sense in a correlated context . indeed , in relation to the anomalous character of the scaling , the marginal single - variable pdf s play here a role analogous to that of single - variable pdf s in the independent case .",
    "for example , with independent variables one allows the single variable pdf s to be of infinite width for any @xmath5 , in order to have an anomalous , lvy scaling limit @xcite of @xmath24 . here , with correlated variables , the dependence on @xmath5 entering in @xmath62 and the consequent divergence of width for @xmath63 and @xmath65 play a qualitatively similar role in producing anomalous scaling .",
    "it is natural to ask what are the correlations of the variables @xmath7 s according to the joint pdf s defined in eq .",
    "( [ eq_joint_1 ] ) .",
    "if @xmath66 exists , an easy calculation gives for example @xmath67 for @xmath68 .",
    "in particular , the variables with permutation - invariant joint pdf s as in eq .",
    "( [ eq_joint_1 ] ) are linearly correlated for finite @xmath5 .",
    "when @xmath69 their linear correlators approach zero only asymptotically .",
    "next , we consider more general scaling functions which can be expressed as convex combinations of gaussians with varying centers @xmath57 and widths @xmath70 .",

    "the scaling exponent can be now any @xmath74 .",
    "again , for the sake of simplicity we require @xmath75 , while @xmath73 must be strictly equal to zero in a whole neighborhood of @xmath76 , for any @xmath57 . in the appendix",
    "we prove that with the @xmath27 s constructed as follows : @xmath77 with @xmath49 and @xmath50 as before , @xmath24 satisfies the asymptotic scaling ( [ eq_scaling ] ) with @xmath1 given by eq .",
    "( [ eq_g_psi ] ) and the chosen @xmath74 .",
    "one easily verifies that if @xmath78 the @xmath41 variables are linearly uncorrelated for any @xmath5 .",
    "in this case , with @xmath3 the scaling limit of our theorem recovers known results valid for sums of random variables in exchangeable sequences @xcite .",
    "it should also be noticed that if we put @xmath79 and @xmath3 , one recovers the case discussed at the beginning of this section .",
    "all the cases discussed in the previous sections concern correlated variables whose joint pdf s for any @xmath5 are permutationally invariant . at first sight",
    ", such feature may appear a too restrictive condition to be satisfied by realistic models , and applications may often require to release it . however , in the study of anomalous scaling variables of this kind may still play an important role . to illustrate this point , we consider the example of an ising - like spin model , of the type often studied in the renormalization group approach to critical phenomena @xcite .",
    "let us consider a system of @xmath5 spins @xmath80 , @xmath81 , where the index @xmath82 labels the sites of a finite box of square or cubic lattice .",
    "the spins are supposed to take values @xmath83 on the real axis .",
    "equilibrium statistical mechanics allows in principle to construct the joint pdf of the @xmath5 spin variables once given the spin hamiltonian @xmath84 and the temperature @xmath85 .",
    "since the spin variables are associated to the lattice sites , their joint pdf is not invariant under permutations . indeed , for any configuration @xmath86 , one has in general @xmath87 if @xmath88 is a permutation of the @xmath5 labels .",
    "this inequality holds because @xmath89 is a sum of local interactions .",
    "thus , also the canonical joint pdf @xmath90 } { \\int \\prod_{i=1}^n d s_i^\\prime \\exp[-h(\\{s^\\prime\\})/k_b\\,t]}\\ ] ] where @xmath91 is the boltzmann constant , is not invariant under permutations of its arguments . on the other hand , when , e.g. , discussing the critical behavior of the model , a key collective random quantity to be considered is the sum of all the spins @xmath92 @xcite , which , in contrast , is invariant under any permutation of the spin labels , and is expected to have a pdf satisfying anomalous scaling in the thermodynamic limit @xcite .",
    "this suggests to define what we call here a `` permutation invariant representation '' of the statistics of the model .",
    "consider , for instance , the following definition of the joint pdf of new exchangeable variables @xmath7 s : @xmath93 where the sum is extended to all the @xmath94 permutations @xmath88 of the set @xmath95 .",
    "the @xmath33 s defined by the projection operation in eq . ( [ eq_ising_ex ] )",
    "are indeed invariant under permutations , while their sum @xmath96 has a pdf identical to that of the total magnetization @xmath97 of the original system . on the basis of the same projection",
    ", one can also define an effective boltzmann factor for the variables @xmath7 s in such a way that the partition function , and thus the free energy of the original problem , are preserved , too .",
    "even if the computation of the effective hamiltonian in terms of the @xmath7 s is non - trivial , the above equations show that the asymptotic scaling of the pdf of @xmath97 for a critical ising - like model and that of @xmath98 for its permutation invariant representation , coincide .",
    "it is also easy to see that one may construct different such representations of a given statistical model , all sharing the same free energy and the same pdf for @xmath42 .    for a critical ising system one",
    "expects an anomalous scaling for the pdf of @xmath92 with scaling dimensions @xmath99 and @xmath100 for square and cubic lattices , respectively @xcite .",
    "taking into account that finite size scaling for the critical ising model implies @xmath101 , one also concludes that for the permutation invariant representation defined by eq .",
    "( [ eq_ising_ex ] ) one must have @xmath102 for @xmath63 and @xmath68 . as a matter of fact , the limit theorem in eq . ( [ eq_joint_1 ] ) implies a scaling function for the pdf of @xmath42 and linear correlations for the @xmath7 s ( eq . ( [ eq_lin_corr_1 ] ) ) which are compatible with the asymptotic forms expected for the permutation invariant representation of the ising model constructed here .",
    "the above discussion clarifies that correlated variables with permutation - invariant pdf s can be relevant in the statistical approach to anomalous scaling .",
    "this relevance stems from the fact that for these variables the constructive limit theorems presented here are valid . at the same time",
    ", additive collective variables like the total magnetization of a critical ising model are considered in many studies of complex systems , also outside equilibrium statistical mechanics @xcite .",
    "in many phenomena , anomalous scaling is a statistical symmetry obeyed to a good approximation for more or less broad ranges of finite @xmath5 s .",
    "the validity of limit theorems of the kind proved in the previous sections opens the possibility of defining joint pdf s consistent with an exact anomalous scaling of @xmath24 for any finite @xmath5 , i.e. such that @xmath103 .    to illustrate how self - similarity for arbitrary finite @xmath5 arises ,",
    "let us consider the case of the central limit theorem for sums of independent random variables whose pdf has finite second moment .",
    "the asymptotic scaling is normal and turns out to be an attractor in virtue of the stability property of the gaussian pdf . in particular",
    ", this stability implies that if we consider a finite number of independent increments , @xmath11 , @xmath104 , ... , @xmath105 , each one weighted by the same gaussian pdf , the total increment @xmath106 has also precisely a gaussian pdf , having a width @xmath107 times the width of the individual increments .",
    "thus , this pdf strictly satisfies normal scaling for any @xmath5 .    in an analogous way ,",
