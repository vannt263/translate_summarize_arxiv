    "the recent financial crisis has been marked with series of sharp falls in asset prices triggered by , for example , the s&p downgrade of us debt , and default speculations of european countries .",
    "many individual and institutional investors are wary of large market drawdowns as they not only lead to portfolio losses and liquidity shocks , but also indicate potential imminent recessions .",
    "as is well known , hedge fund managers are typically compensated based on the fund s outperformance over the last record maximum , or the high - water mark ( see @xcite , among others ) . as such",
    ", drawdown events can directly affect the manager s income . also , a major drawdown may also trigger a surge in fund redemption by investors , and lead to the manger s job termination .",
    "hence , fund managers have strong incentive to seek insurance against drawdowns .",
    "these market phenomena have motivated the application of drawdowns as path - dependent risk measures , as discussed in @xcite , @xcite , among others . on the other hand",
    ", vecer @xcite argues that some market - traded contracts , such as vanilla and lookback puts ,  have only limited ability to insure the market drawdowns . \"",
    "he studies through simulation the returns of calls and puts written on the underlying asset s maximum drawdown , and discusses dynamic trading strategies to hedge against a drawdown associated with a single asset or index . the recent work @xcite provides non - trivial static strategies using market - traded barrier digital options to approximately synthesize a european - style digital option on a drawdown event .",
    "these observations suggest that drawdown protection can be useful for both institutional and individual investors , and there is an interest in synthesizing drawdown insurance .    in the current paper",
    ", we discuss the stochastic modeling of drawdowns and study the valuation of a number of insurance contracts against drawdown events .",
    "more precisely , the drawdown process is defined as the current relative drop of an asset value from its historical maximum . in its simplest form ,",
    "the drawdown insurance involves a continuous premium payment by the investor ( protection buyer ) to insure a drawdown of an underlying asset value to a pre - specified level .    in order to provide the investor with more flexibility in managing the path - dependent drawdown risk",
    ", we incorporate the right to terminate the contract early .",
    "this early cancellation feature is similar to the surrender right that arises in many common insurance products such as equity - indexed annuities ( see e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) . due to the timing flexibility , the investor may stop the premium payment if he / she finds that a drawdown is unlikely to occur ( e.g. when the underlying price continues to rise ) . in our analysis , we rigorously show that the investor s optimal cancellation timing is based on a non - trivial first passage time of the underlying drawdown process . in other words",
    ", the investor s cancellation strategy and valuation of the contract will depend not only on current value of the underlying asset , but also its distance from the historical maximum .",
    "applying the theory of optimal stopping as well as analytical properties of drawdown processes , we derive the optimal cancellation threshold and illustrate it through numerical examples .",
    "moreover , we consider a related insurance contract that protects the investor from a drawdown preceding a drawup .",
    "in other words , the insurance contract expires early if a drawup event occurs prior to a drawdown . from the investor s perspective , when a drawup is realized ,",
    "there is little need to insure against a drawdown .",
    "therefore , this drawup contingency automatically stops the premium payment and is an attractive feature that will potentially reduce the cost of drawdown insurance .",
    "our model can also readily extended to incorporate the default risk associated with the underlying asset . to this end",
    ", we observe that a drawdown can be triggered by a continuous price movement as well as a jump - to - default event . among other results ,",
    "we provide the formulas for the fair premium of the drawdown insurance , and analyze the impact of default risk on the valuation of drawdown insurance .    in existing literature",
    ", drawdowns also arise in a number of financial applications .",
    "pospisil and vecer @xcite apply pde methods to investigate the sensitivities of portfolio values and hedging strategies with respect to drawdowns and drawups .",
    "drawdown processes have also been incorporated into trading constraints for portfolio optimization ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "meilijson @xcite discusses the role of drawdown in the exercise time for a certain look - back american put option .",
    "several studies focus on some related concepts of drawdowns , such as maximum drawdowns @xcite , and speed of market crash @xcite . on the other hand , the statistical modeling of drawdowns and drawups is also of practical importance , and we refer to the recent studies @xcite , among others .    for our valuation problems , we often work with the joint law of drawdowns and drawups . to this end , some related formulas from @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite are useful . compared to the existing literature and our prior work ,",
    "the current paper s contributions are threefold .",
    "first , we derive the fair premium for insuring a number of drawdown events , with both finite and infinite maturities , as well as new provisions like drawup contingency and early termination .",
    "in particular , the early termination option leads to the analysis of a new optimal stopping problem ( see section [ sect - cancellableinsurance ] ) .",
    "we rigorously solve for the optimal termination strategy , which can be expressed in terms of first passage time of a drawdown process .",
    "furthermore , we incorporate the underlying s default risk  a feature absent in other related studies on drawdown  into our analysis , and study its impact on the drawdown insurance premium .",
    "the paper is structured as follows . in section [ sect - formulation ] , we describe a stochastic model for drawdowns and drawups , and formulate the valuation of a vanilla drawdown insurance . in sections [ sect - cancellableinsurance ] and [ sect - drawuptoo ] , we study , respectively , the cancellable drawdown insurance and drawdown insurance with drawup contingency . as extension , we discuss the valuation of drawdown insurance on a defaultable stock in section [ sect - def ] .",

    "in order to prepare for our subsequent proofs on the cancellable drawdown insurance in section [ sect - cancellableinsurance ] , we now summarize a number properties of the conditional laplace transform of @xmath34 ( see ) .      1 .",
    "@xmath39 is positive and increasing on @xmath247 .",
    "@xmath39 satisfies differential equation @xmath248 with the neumann condition @xmath249 3 .",
    "@xmath39 is strictly convex , i.e. , @xmath250 for @xmath251 .",
    "property ( i ) follows directly from the definition of @xmath252 and strong markov property .",
    "property ( ii ) follows directly from differentiation of . for property ( iii ) , the proof is as follows .",
    "if @xmath253 , then ( [ ode ] ) implies that @xmath254 if @xmath255 , then ( [ zd ] ) and ( [ ode ] ) imply that for @xmath251 , @xmath256the last inequality follows from the fact that @xmath255 and @xmath257 .",
    "hence , strict convexity follows .      in view of",
    ", we seek the root @xmath112 of the equation : @xmath258 to this end , we compute @xmath259 since @xmath260 is monotonically decreasing from @xmath116 to @xmath261 , there exists a unique @xmath262 such that @xmath263 .",
    "we have @xmath264 by and @xmath265 , which implies that @xmath266 has at least one solution @xmath267 .",
    "moreover , for @xmath268 , @xmath269 and hence @xmath270 by , there is no root in @xmath271 .",
    "next , we show the root is unique by proving that @xmath272 for all @xmath273 . to this end",
    ", we first observe from that @xmath121 can be expressed as @xmath274 , for @xmath275 , where @xmath276 and @xmath277 .",
    "putting these into , we express @xmath278 in terms @xmath37 instead of @xmath121 . in turn , verifying @xmath272 is reduced to :      we begin by using ( [ ode ] ) to rewrite the statement in the lemma as @xmath281 by the strong markov property of process @xmath282 , the function @xmath37 satisfies a more general version of .",
    "specifically , for @xmath283 , @xmath284 define for @xmath83 , @xmath285 then function @xmath286 satisfies ( see ( [ xy ] ) ) @xmath287 from which we can easily obtain that @xmath288 straightforward computation shows that @xmath289 thus , @xmath290    using ( [ zeta2lambda ] ) , the above inequality is equivalent to @xmath291 let us denote by @xmath292 we will show that @xmath293 notice that for @xmath294 $ ] , @xmath295 therefore @xmath296 moreover , @xmath297 as a result , @xmath298 this completes the proof of lemma [ lem1 ] .    since our problem concerns @xmath299 , lemma [ lem1 ] says @xmath272 for @xmath300 , which confirms that there is at most one solution to equation @xmath266 .",
    "this concludes the uniqueness of smooth pasting point @xmath267 .",
    "using probabilistic nature of function @xmath304 we know that it is positive and decreasing .",
    "therefore , if @xmath305 , we have @xmath306 on the other hand , if @xmath307 , from ( [ xi ] ) we have @xmath308 so in either case ( @xmath305 or @xmath307 ) , @xmath309 is an increasing function , and @xmath310 which implies that @xmath311 this completes the proof ."
