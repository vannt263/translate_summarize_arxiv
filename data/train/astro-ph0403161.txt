    "observational study of the redshift range @xmath13 is crucial for understanding the reionization of intergalactic hydrogen , which was the most recent major phase transition for most of the baryonic matter in the universe . while polarization of the microwave background measured by the wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( wmap ) satellite indicates that substantial ionization had begun as early as @xmath14 ( spergel et al .",
    "2003 ) , both the opaque gunn - peterson troughs observed in the spectra of @xmath15 quasars ( becker et al . 2001 ; fan et al . 2002 ) and the high temperature of the intergalactic medium at @xmath16 ( theuns et al . 2002 ; hui & haiman 2003 ) imply that a large part of the reionization was relatively recent , with substantial neutral gas lasting up to @xmath17 .",
    "lyman-@xmath1  emission has proven the most effective tool so far for identifying star forming galaxies at redshifts @xmath18 ; indeed , all but two of the @xmath19 galaxies that have been spectroscopically confirmed at @xmath18 were found through their lyman-@xmath1  line emission in either narrowband or spectroscopic searches ( hu et al 2002 [ h02 ] ; kodaira et al 2003 [ k03 ] ; cuby et al 2003 ; this work ; kneib et al 2004 ) , and at least one of the continuum - selected sources is also a lyman-@xmath1  emitter ( cuby et al 2003 ) .",
    "we present the extension of the large area lyman alpha ( lala ) survey to the @xmath20 window .",
    "we have obtained spectra for each of the three @xmath20 candidates that pass all photometric selection criteria .",
    "two of these show strong emission lines in the narrowband filter bandpass . in one case ,",
    "the line is identified as lyman-@xmath1  at @xmath21 based on its asymmetric profile and the absence of other detected lines down to faint flux levels .",
    "the second object is identified as an  source at @xmath22 based on a probable ( @xmath23 ) detection of the  line .",
    "the lala survey s @xmath20 search is based on a deep 9180narrowband image of our botes field , which is @xmath24 with center at 14:25:57 + 35:32 ( j2000.0 ) .",
    "the image was obtained using the ccd mosaic-1 camera at the 4 m mayall telescope of the kitt peak national observatory together with a custom narrowband filter , whose central wavelength of @xmath25  and full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) of @xmath26  place it in a gap between the night sky airglow lines .",
    "narrowband imaging data were obtained on ut 2001 june 1517 and 2425 and 2002 april 5 and 1819 .",
    "the total exposure time was 28 hours .",
    "data reduction followed the same procedures used in the @xmath27 and @xmath28 lala images ( rhoads et al .",
    "2000 ; rhoads & malhotra 2001 ) . to summarize",
    ", we remove electronic crosstalk between mosaic chip pairs sharing readout electronics ; subtract overscan and bias frame corrections ; and flatfield with dome flats .",
    "next , we subtract a pupil ghost image caused by internal reflections in the kpno 4 m corrector .",
    "we remove residual , large scale imperfections in the sky flatness using a smoothed supersky flat derived from the science data , followed by subtraction of a polynomial surface fit to the sky flux .",
    "a fringe frame was constructed from the data , fitted to the blank sky regions of each exposure , and subtracted .",
    "cosmic rays were rejected in each exposure using the algorithm of rhoads ( 2000 ) .",
    "the world coordinate systems of individual frames were adjusted to the usno - a2 star catalog ( monet et al 1998 ) .",
    "satellite trails were flagged by hand for exclusion from the final stacks .",
    "the eight - chip mosaic-1 images were then mapped onto a rectified , common coordinate grid using the `` mscimage '' task from the iraf mscred package ( valdes & tody 1998 ; valdes 1998 ) .",
    "the seeing , throughput , and sky brightness in each exposure were measured and used to compute a set of weights for image stacking using the `` attweight '' algorithm ( fischer & kochanski 1994 ) . finally , the exposures were stacked , with an additional sigma clipping applied to reject discrepant data not previously flagged .",
    "the majority of the weight comes from the final two nights imaging data , and only @xmath29 of the total weight is from the 2001 observing season .",
    "the final stack has seeing @xmath30 and a @xmath31 sensitivity limit of @xmath32 ( measured within a 9 pixel [ @xmath33 diameter aperture ) , corresponding to @xmath34 for a pure line source at these wavelengths or to an ab magnitude of @xmath35 for a pure continuum source .",
    "the magnitude zero point was determined by comparison with a deep @xmath36 filter image obtained earlier ( see rhoads & malhotra 2001 ) , which was in turn calibrated to @xmath36 filter standard stars from sdss standard star lists .",
    "lyman-@xmath1  galaxy candidates were selected following the criteria used successfully in lower redshift lala searches ( rhoads & malhotra 2001 ; dawson et al .",
    "2004 ) . in summary ,",
    "these include : 1 ) significance of the narrowband detection @xmath37 ; 2 ) a narrowband excess of at least @xmath38 magnitude , so that @xmath39 of the narrowband flux comes from an emission line ; 3 ) significance of the narrowband excess @xmath40 ; and 4 ) no detection in filters blueward of the expected lyman break location at the @xmath41 level .",
    "to implement the blue flux `` veto '' criterion , we used a weighted sum of six noao deep wide - field survey ( ndwfs ; jannuzi & dey 1999 ) and lala survey filters blueward of @xmath42 , where the lyman break would fall for galaxies whose lyman-@xmath1  line falls within the @xmath43  narrowband .",
    "the weights were chosen to achieve optimal depth for objects of approximately median color .",
    "most of the weight in this combined `` veto image '' comes from the ndwfs b@xmath44 filter , with additional contributions from ndwfs r band data and the lala survey s v band , and three of the redshifted h@xmath1 narrowband filter observations .",
    "this stack reaches a final @xmath4 limiting ab magnitude of @xmath45 at an effective central wavelength near @xmath46 .",
    "formally , some flux may be expected in the r band filter for @xmath20 sources , but in practice , intergalactic hydrogen absorption attenuates this flux so severely that it is quite safe to include r band data in the veto stack as we have done .",
    "photometry for candidate selection was done using sextractor ( bertin & arnouts 1996 ) .",
    "all color tests were applied using a 9 pixel diameter aperture , corresponding to @xmath47 , and using sextractor s two - image mode to ensure photometry from the same regions in all filters .",
    "in addition to high redshift lyman-@xmath1  sources , three types of contaminants may enter the sample .",
    "the first is noise spikes in the narrowband image .",
    "assuming gaussian statistics , we should expect @xmath48 noise peak above our @xmath31 detection threshold among the @xmath49 independent resolution elements in the narrowband image , and more may be found if the noise properties of the image are not perfectly gaussian .",
    "the second is time variable sources ( either transient or moving objects ) .",
    "these may mimic emission line objects in our catalog because different filters were observed at widely varying times . for typical lala",
    "survey depths , the expected rate of high redshift supernovae will be @xmath48 per filter per field ( riess , personal communication ; see also strolger et al 2004 ) .",
    "the third is low - redshift emission line galaxies of extremely high equivalent width .",
    "the expected numbers of such foreground objects are difficult to estimate from either theory or present data the lala data themselves are likely to considerably refine the statistics of such contaminating sources .",
    "these criteria yielded a total of three high quality candidate @xmath20",
    "lyman-@xmath1  galaxies . formally , six objects passed selection using an old veto filter stack from 2001 , but two of these were ruled out completely and a third strongly disfavored by detections in a new ndwfs r band image from 10 april 2002 .",
    "one of these excluded candidates is almost certainly a supernova at moderate redshift ; such an event would not be surprising given the area and depth of our survey .",

    "this conversion follows from a widely used set of assumptions : a kennicutt ( 1983 ) initial mass function ( imf ) and corresponding conversion between h@xmath1 luminosity and star formation rate , plus the lyman-@xmath1  to h@xmath1 ratio for dust - free case  b recombination . these are probably not valid in detail for high redshift lyman-@xmath1  galaxies , but as we do not yet have a well justified model , it is convenient to at least use a standard one",
    ". combined with our survey volume of @xmath208 ( comoving ) , we obtain a lower bound on the star formation rate density ( sfrd ) of @xmath209 from  alone .",
    "of course , given that  is much brighter than @xmath204 , its contribution to the star formation rate density is only a small fraction of the total . for comparison ,",
    "k03 probe further down the luminosity function and find a lower limit to the sfrd of @xmath210 , while the lyman-@xmath1  line found in the h02 survey would imply a @xmath211 range from @xmath212 to @xmath213 .",
    "all of these rates are subject to incompleteness corrections for sources falling below survey detection limits in either lyman-@xmath1  flux or equivalent width , and to additional systematic uncertainties associated with the stellar population model assumed and with the radiative transfer of the resonantly scattered lyman-@xmath1  line . in particular , the model used here and elsewhere to convert between lyman-@xmath1luminosity and star formation rate can not actually reproduce the observed lyman-@xmath1  equivalent width distribution at @xmath214 ( malhotra & rhoads 2002 ) . still , relative comparisons among lyman-@xmath1  samples remain valid , and show that sources like  are rare , luminous , and constitute a fraction @xmath215 of the global lyman-@xmath1  production and star formation rate at @xmath20 .    for , we have flux measurements or limits on the , , and h@xmath161 transitions .",
    "these allow us to place general constraints on the metallicity of this galaxy using @xmath216 / f(h\\beta))$ ] .",
    "we find @xmath217 / f(h\\beta ) ) = 1.1 \\pm 0.12 $ ] .",
    "the additional contribution to the oxygen flux from  is either negligible ( using the deimos measurement , for which @xmath218/f(3727 ) \\approx 20 $ ] ) or small ( using the gmos measurement , for which @xmath219 ) . from kewley & dopita ( 2002 ) ,",
    "the theoretical maximum for @xmath220 is @xmath221 , achieved only for a modestly sub - solar metallicity near @xmath222 and a high ionization parameter @xmath223 .",
    "( here the ionization parameter is defined as the ratio of ionizing photon flux to number density of hydrogen ; see kewley and dopita 2002 . )",
    "our observation is consistent with this theoretical maximum , but not with @xmath224 substantially below this maximum , and we thus conclude that  has @xmath225 . for comparison , estimates of the solar value for @xmath226 range from @xmath227 ( mcgaugh 1991 ) to @xmath228 ( allende prieto , lambert , & asplund 2001 ) .",
    "this places  in the lowest quartile of metallicity for galaxies at @xmath229 from the canada - france redshift survey sample ( lilly , carollo , & stockton 2003 ) , but around the midpoint of the metallicity range for lyman break galaxies at @xmath230 ( pettini et al 2001 ) .",
    "the ratio @xmath231 also shows a closer physical resemblance to lbgs than to continuum - bright galaxies at @xmath229 : ratios @xmath232 are observed in only one of 66 galaxies reported by lilly et al ( 2003 ) but in four of five lbgs in the pettini et al ( 2001 ) sample .",
    "however , the apparent discrepancy with other @xmath233 galaxies is likely due to the larger characteristic luminosity of the lilly et al sample , which has @xmath234 .",
    "our i band limiting magnitude ( @xmath235 ) corresponds to johnson @xmath236 . using a metallicity - luminosity relation derived by melbourne & salzer ( 2002 ) for local emission line selected galaxies",
    ", we would expect @xmath237 where the error bar is the empirically determined scatter for the local sample .",
    "thus ,  actually has a slightly _ high _ metallicity for its luminosity .",
    "this is broadly consistent with the finding of lilly et al ( 2003 ) , that most galaxies at @xmath229 have metallicity comparable to local galaxies of similar luminosity .",
    "photoionization models show that equivalent widths of @xmath238correspond to starburst ages of @xmath239 to @xmath240 for metallicity @xmath241 ( stasiska & leitherer 1996 ) , implying that the emission from  is dominated by a very young stellar population . combining this age with the gas metallicity",
    "implies that this is not the first generation of stars formed in this high - redshift dwarf galaxy .",
    "the current star formation rate can be estimated from the emission line fluxes .",
    "the conversion between line flux and star formation rate is better established for @xmath242 ( using a ratio @xmath243 and the kennicutt ( 1983 ) conversion factor ) than for .",
    "the observed @xmath242 flux thereby implies a star formation rate is @xmath244 , though the combined uncertainty in the line flux and conversion factor is at least a factor of two .",
    "because lyman-@xmath1  photons are resonantly scattered by neutral hydrogen , lyman-@xmath1  emitting galaxies may suffer considerable attenuation of their line flux when embedded in an intergalactic medium ( igm ) with a substantial neutral fraction .",
    "thus , a decrease in lyman-@xmath1  galaxy counts may be expected at redshifts substantially before the end of reionization ( rhoads & malhotra 2001 , hu et al .",
    "2002 , rhoads et al .",
    "typical high redshift lyman-@xmath1  galaxies have small continuum fluxes , and upper limits can be placed on their expected stromgren sphere radius @xmath245 by combining their observed fluxes and equivalent widths with stellar population models ( rhoads & malhotra 2001 ) . a radius of @xmath246 is typically inferred . for comparison , @xmath247 is required to avoid a scattering optical depth @xmath248 at the systemic velocity due to the neutral igm outside the stromgren sphere .",
    "haiman ( 2002 ) has argued that the first reported @xmath20 galaxy ( hu et al .",
    "2002 ) could still be embedded in a neutral igm , because ( a ) emission from the red wing of the emitted line will be less strongly scattered than line center , reducing the effective attenuation of the line , and ( b ) the observed lyman-@xmath1  equivalent width in this object is substantially below the theoretical maximum from stellar population models , so that the observed line could in fact be substantially attenuated . santos ( 2003 ) considers additional physical effects , including gas motions and overdensity associated with the formation of lyman-@xmath1  galaxies , which generally increase the lyman-@xmath1  attenuation over that in haiman s model .",
    "for example , in the case of infall to a forming galaxy , scattering by residual neutrals within the stromgren sphere can produce large optical depths ( @xmath249 ) on the blue side of the lyman-@xmath1  line , between the systemic velocity and the gas infall velocity .",
    "however , santos also suggests that the velocity differences observed between lyman-@xmath1  lines and other emission lines in lyman break galaxies could be intrinsic to the source , so that the entire lyman-@xmath1  line is emitted with an effective redshift of a few hundred @xmath6 . in this case , the effective lyman-@xmath1  attenuation for @xmath250 is a factor of @xmath251 , and is not very sensitive to model parameters besides the ionization state of the igm .",
    "constrains reionization better than most other @xmath20 galaxies because of its relatively large equivalent width ( @xmath66rest frame , @xmath4 , before corrections for igm opacity ; or @xmath113with corrections suitable for an ionized igm ; see section  [ gwin_obs ] ) .",
    "the source sdf  j132415.7 + 273058 ( k03 ) has a similar line luminosity , a continuum detection near the upper limit for , and hence an equivalent width measurement quite similar to s @xmath4 limit .    in a neutral universe",
    ", these sources would require an intrinsic equivalent width @xmath252  even if the lyman-@xmath1  line is redshifted as suggested by santos , and @xmath253  in the absence of such a redshift .",
    "the former is consistent with the observed lyman-@xmath1  equivalent width distribution at @xmath214 ( malhotra & rhoads 2002 ) .",
    "the latter is high even for the @xmath214 sample .",
    "thus , the properties of these objects are most easily understood if the universe is mostly ionized at @xmath20 .",
    "more robust constraints on reionization from _ individual _ lyman-@xmath1  galaxies will be difficult , because the expected suppression of the lyman-@xmath1  line depends strongly on the velocity offset between emitted lyman-@xmath1  and the galaxy s systemic velocity , and measuring the latter would in general require spectroscopy in the thermally dominated mid - infrared ( santos 2003 ) .",
    "stronger constraints on reionization from lyman-@xmath1  galaxies will be possible using statistical samples",
    ". suppression of lyman-@xmath1  by the igm will have a strong effect on the lyman-@xmath1  luminosity function : even a factor of @xmath251 reduction in lyman-@xmath1  flux will reduce the observed lyman-@xmath1  number counts dramatically .",
    "the accessible portion of the lyman-@xmath1  luminosity function is very steep ( see malhotra et al .",
    "2004 ) , and a factor of @xmath239 in luminosity threshold corresponds to a factor of @xmath254 in expected lyman-@xmath1  source counts at fixed sensitivity .",
    "moreover , the effect on the equivalent width distribution will be identical to that on the luminosity function , which would not be generically expected for other factors that could modify the lyman-@xmath1  luminosity function ( such as evolution ) .",
    "we have performed a narrowband search for lyman-@xmath1  emitting galaxies at @xmath20 in the botes field of the large area lyman alpha survey , and have obtained spectra for all of our viable candidates .",
    "one source , , is confirmed as lyman-@xmath1  at @xmath255 , based on an isolated , asymmetric emission line .",
    "the lyman-@xmath1  luminosity of this source is large , @xmath256 .",
    "objects this bright in the line are rare , occurring at a rate @xmath48 per @xmath257 ( this work and k03 ) .",
    "it is therefore likely to correspond to a high peak in the density distribution at redshift @xmath0 .",
    "the equivalent width is also larger than most other @xmath20 galaxies , with a @xmath4 lower bound of @xmath113  ( rest frame , corrected for igm absorption ) .",
    "this is difficult to reconcile with a neutral intergalactic medium unless the lyman-@xmath1  line is intrinsically strong _ and _ is emitted from its host galaxy with an intrinsic doppler shift of several hundred @xmath6 .",
