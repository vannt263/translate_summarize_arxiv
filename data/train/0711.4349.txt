    "how do dust grains , known to permeate disks surrounding young stars , assemble into planets ?",
    "one proposed stage of growth involves gravitational instability of a dust - rich layer at the disk midplane ( safronov 1969 ; goldreich & ward 1973 ) .",
    "if dust grains are free to settle vertically out of gas , midplane dust densities eventually exceed roche densities , and dust particles can begin to aggregate by self - gravity .",
    "an objection to this means of forming planetesimals is that vertical velocities of gas may be too high for dust to settle ( weidenschilling 1980 ) . even apart from turbulence intrinsic to gas ( e.g. ,",
    "turbulence driven by the magneto - rotational instability ) , dust layers that are too vertically thin can suffer from the kelvin - helmholtz instability ( khi ) .",
    "the khi threatens to manifest because dust - rich gas at the midplane rotates at a rate different from that of dust - poor gas at higher altitude .",
    "dust - poor gas experiences greater acceleration from a background radial pressure gradient , and so its rotation velocity in centrifugal balance must deviate more strongly from the keplerian value .",
    "the deviation is smaller for gas laden with dust , since dust adds inertia but contributes no pressure .",
    "usually it is assumed that the background radial pressure gradient @xmath3 so that the vertical shear in the rotation velocity @xmath4 .    whether the disk is kh - unstable is commonly assessed using the richardson number ( chandrasekhar 1961 , page 491 ) :    @xmath5    where @xmath6 is the vertical gravitational acceleration and @xmath7 is the total mass density . in the limit that perturbations",
    "are incompressible , the numerator is the square of the brunt - visl frequency of buoyant oscillations , while the denominator is the square of the vertical shearing rate .",
    "the richardson number measures the amount of work required to overturn fluid elements that are originally in hydrostatic equilibrium , against the amount of free kinetic energy available in the background shear .",
    "for purely cartesian flow ( no rotational forces ) ,    @xmath8    ( miles 1961 ; howard 1961 ; chandrasekhar 1961 ; drazin & reid 1981 ; li et al .",
    "despite the fact that ( [ onequarter ] ) is formally not a sufficient criterion , laboratory experiments bear out its usefulness ( tritton 1988 ) .    in the case of our disk , close to the midplane , @xmath9 arises from the tidal gravity of the star , @xmath10 measures distance from the midplane , @xmath11 is the keplerian angular frequency , and @xmath12 , where @xmath6 and @xmath13 denote gas and dust , respectively .",
    "moreover , @xmath14 within the thin dust layers of interest to us ( see  [ init ] ) .",
    "thus throughout this paper    @xmath15 as dust settles vertically , @xmath16 increases ; the dust surface density @xmath17 is assumed constant while the characteristic scale height @xmath18 of dust decreases . in the limit that @xmath19 , @xmath20 .",
    "criterion ( [ onequarter ] ) for instability therefore places a lower bound on @xmath18 and a corresponding upper bound on @xmath21 .",
    "unfortunately , for conventional solar nebular parameters  in particular for a height - integrated solar metallicity of @xmath22the maximum of @xmath21 falls short of the roche density by 12 orders of magnitude ( e.g. , sekiya 1998 ; youdin & shu 2002 ) .",
    "but is it appropriate to apply criterion ( [ onequarter ] ) to a circumstellar disk where the flow is not cartesian ?",
    "one might guess that rotational forces merely modify @xmath23 by a factor of order unity , since the coriolis force and the radial shear ( @xmath24 ) operate on a timescale @xmath25the same timescale characterizing vertical brunt - visl oscillations and the vertical shear at @xmath26 .",
    "yet when coriolis forces are introduced , as in the analysis of gmez & ostriker ( 2005 , hereafter go ) , the stability properties of the flow change dramatically . numerical simulations by go , performed under the assumption that dust is perfectly entrained in gas , reveal no well - defined threshold for instability .",
    "unstable modes are detected for @xmath0 as high as 4 , with growth rates that diminish with increasing @xmath0 but that show no sign of vanishing ( see their figures 9 and 10 ) .",
    "similar results obtain in numerical simulations by johansen , henning , & klahr ( 2006 , hereafter jhk ) , who relax the assumption of perfect coupling between dust and gas but who , like go , retain only coriolis forces and ignore radial shear . for their `` rocks '' and `` pebbles '' with momentum stopping times 1050 @xmath27 shorter than @xmath25",
    ", the dust distribution evolves to one where @xmath0 increases from @xmath21 at the midplane to @xmath28 at higher altitude ( jhk , their figures 4 and 5 ) .",
    "here we conduct numerical simulations that account for the full complement of disk - related forces .",
    "we include not only the coriolis force but also the centrifugal force and radial tidal gravity . the latter two forces combine to produce radial shear in rotational equilibrium .",
    "thus we investigate the stability of doubly shearing flows : vertically shearing dust layers in near - keplerian differential rotation .",
    "we expect our results to differ from those of go and jhk .",
    "the modes emphasized by go have growth rates @xmath29 at @xmath30 .",
    "keplerian differential rotation , characterized by a strain rate of @xmath31 , should shear such modes apart before they have time to amplify .",
    "indeed this is the conclusion of ishitsu & sekiya ( 2003 , hereafter is ) , who numerically integrate the linearized equations of motion , including the full suite of disk - related forces , to compute the factors by which modes amplify .",
    "they find that amplification factors are sufficiently limited by radial shear that midplane dust - to - gas density ratios might reach values as high as @xmath22 ( still too low for gravitational instability , unfortunately ) .",
    "they restrict , however , their linear analysis to odd - parity modes for which the vertical velocity @xmath32 .",
    "gmez & ostriker ( 2005 ) establish that even - parity modes grow faster and overturn the dust layer more effectively .",
    "our simulations do not pre - select for either type of mode .",
    "another difference between our work and is is that we concentrate on @xmath33 flows , whereas is employ a simple , analytically tractable dust distribution . of course , @xmath34 is merely a plausible condition to which the dust - gas mixture might relax .",
    "one of the goals of this study is to assess whether the richardson number is a good predictor of stability even when all disk - related forces are accounted for . finally , the analysis of is is linear , while our numerical simulations enable access to nonlinear phenomena .",
    "our numerical simulations , like those of go , assume that dust particles are perfectly entrained in gas , i.e. , we assume that grain momentum stopping times @xmath35 .",
    "this approximation is valid for small particles , e.g. , having sizes @xmath36 m at disk radius @xmath37 au in a minimum - mass nebula ( e.g. , weidenschilling 1977 ) .",
    "the hydrodynamics code and initial conditions are described in  [ method ] .",
    "results are presented in  [ res ] ; there we determine @xmath23 for our doubly shearing flows .",
    "a summary is provided in ",
    "[ sum ] .",
    "while our entire study is rooted in the literature on the kelvin - helmholtz instability and its impact on planetesimal formation , and as such revolves around the richardson criterion , it was brought to our attention by the referee that the khi may not be the only instability afflicting the dusty midplane .",
    "baroclinic instabilities , studied in disks by cabot ( 1984 ) , knobloch & spruit ( 1986 ) , and arlt & urpin ( 2004 ) may also be relevant .",
    "these authors study baroclinity specifically in the context of a non - zero vertical shear .",
    "more generally , a baroclinic flow is one whose isobaric surfaces do not coincide with its isodensity surfaces .",
    "our flows are baroclinic because of molecular weight gradients : dust adds to the density but not to the pressure .",
    "baroclinic instability can strike even when the richardson number is large .",
    "we will connect our findings to the baroclinic instability when appropriate ; indeed , in ",
    "[ cori ] we propose that the instability discovered by go in their simulations of non - radially - shearing disks is , in fact , the baroclinic instability discovered by cabot ( 1984 ) . and we will see in  [ varsig ] that the richardson criterion alone does not determine stability under arbitrary conditions .",
    "gas and pressureless dust are two fluids obeying separate momentum equations . in an inertial frame ,    @xmath38    where @xmath39 is velocity , @xmath40 is time , and @xmath41 is the background potential .",
    "terms containing @xmath42 , the momentum stopping time for dust in gas , account for how the two fluids interact frictionally .    in this paper , we work exclusively in the tight coupling limit where particles and gas have negligible relative velocity , @xmath43 .",
    "this corresponds to the case where dust particles are so small  i.e .",
    ", their surface area to mass ratios are so large  that they become entrained in the gas flow over short times . by computing the difference and appropriately weighted sum of ( [ one ] ) and ( [ two ] ) ( see youdin & goodman 2005 ) , and taking the limit @xmath44 , we find    @xmath45    where @xmath46 .",
    "furthermore ,    @xmath47    where @xmath48 is the gravitational constant , @xmath49 is the central stellar mass at the origin , @xmath50 is the internal energy density of gas , and @xmath51 and @xmath10 are the cylindrical radius and height .",
    "the gas obeys a polytropic equation of state @xmath52 with constant @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "finally , dust and gas obey separate continuity relations    @xmath55    equations ( [ four])([nine ] ) are the ones we solve in this paper , in the shearing box approximation ( goldreich & lynden - bell 1965 ; hawley , gammie , & balbus 1995 ;  [ init ] ) .",
    "they contain the same content as equations ( 2)(6 ) of go .    in the tightly coupled limit ,",
    "a fluid parcel does not change its dust - to - gas ratio in a lagrangian sense : @xmath56 , where @xmath57 is the convective derivative .",
    "particles can not slip away from gas , and so we can not expect our simulated flows to relax , from arbitrary initial conditions , into a unique , steady state of marginal stability ( if such a state actually exists ) . in reality , such relaxation occurs over the time it takes dust to settle vertically relative to gas .",
    "vertical settling times are measured in myrs for micron - sized particles ( or @xmath2@xmath58 yr for centimeter - sized particles ) in a minimum - mass nebula .",
    "nevertheless , our equations do permit dust - rich parcels to settle toward the midplane if their weight can not be supported in vertical hydrostatic equilibrium .",
    "we are able to evolve dust - gas mixtures over dynamical times , measured in orbital periods , provided @xmath42 is still shorter .",
    "our simulations can thus determine whether a given set of equilibrium conditions is dynamically stable .",
    "we now specify these equilibrium initial conditions .",
    "call @xmath59 and @xmath60 the radius and azimuth of a test particle moving on a circular orbit , where @xmath61 .",
    "shifting to axes centered on the test particle and rotating at @xmath62 , we trade the usual cylindrical coordinates @xmath63 for their shearing sheet counterparts @xmath64 : @xmath65 , @xmath66 , @xmath67 , @xmath68 , and @xmath69 . in this rotating frame , the momentum equation ( [ four ] ) reads    [ abc ] @xmath70    where @xmath71 , @xmath72 , @xmath73 , and curvature terms of order @xmath74 are dropped , following the shearing sheet approximation .",
    "we introduce the variable @xmath75 in ( [ a ] ) because in our simulations we experiment with @xmath76 ( zero radial shear ) to connect to go . for the full problem with a point - mass potential , @xmath77 .    in rotational equilibrium ,",
    "equation ( [ a ] ) for radial momentum balance gives    @xmath78    initially , @xmath79 reflects how the background nebular pressure changes radially on scales of @xmath51 .",
    "we express @xmath80 in terms of a model input parameter , @xmath81 :    @xmath82    the velocity @xmath81 represents the difference between the keplerian rotation rate and the sub - keplerian rotation rate of pressure - supported gas ; it measures the maximum possible difference in rotational velocity between the dust - rich midplane and dust - free gas at higher altitude . for typical nebular parameters ,",
    "it is approximately @xmath83 m / s and nearly constant with @xmath51 .    further defining the local dust - to - gas ratio @xmath84 , we rewrite ( [ shear ] ) as    @xmath85    in each of our simulations , we hold @xmath81 fixed for simplicity . then the vertical shear , @xmath86 , is non - zero only when @xmath87 is non - zero . because @xmath88 varies rapidly with @xmath10 for the vertically thin dust layers of interest to us , approximating @xmath81 as constant introduces negligible error .",
    "all our simulations investigate the stability of constant @xmath0 flows .",

    "the second modification is to the pressure gradient source term : @xmath129 , in accordance with ( [ abc ] ) .",
    "the final change is to introduce an extra source term for the `` large - scale '' radial pressure gradient , distinct from the just mentioned `` local '' pressure gradient .",

    "they find that radial shear tends to stabilize the flow to non - axisymmetric disturbances . for their particular choice for the form of @xmath171 , the linear baroclinic instability is defeated when baroclinity is small ( @xmath172 ) and when the disk is strongly stable to thermal convection in the vertical direction .",
    "these stability requirements are usually satisfied in disks without gradients in mean molecular weight ( such disks are their main concern ) .",

    ", we find that @xmath0 must fall below a critical value , @xmath184 , for the layer to overturn when @xmath77 and when @xmath120 ( see  [ varsig ] for experiments that vary @xmath1 ) .",
    "figures [ f6 ] and [ f7 ] demonstrate this point : the flow for @xmath185 eventually mixes whereas that for @xmath118 keeps the dust layer intact for as long as @xmath186 .",

    "run at higher resolution@xmath187confirms these results ( run s2a ) .      naturally , reducing the initial velocity perturbations increases the time required for the layer to overturn .",
    "the dependence is very slight ; lowering the maximum perturbation velocity from @xmath131 to @xmath188 increases the time to overturn by @xmath189@xmath190 ( runs s3a and s4a ) .",
    "( nonetheless , eliminating the initial perturbations altogether produces no evolution in the shearing box whatsoever . )",
    "the instability grows fastest at `` co - rotation , '' where @xmath191 , and spreads radially inward and outward from that location .",
    "this behavior is evident in figure [ f8 ] , and we observe it in all our unstable runs . upon removing all initial velocity perturbations in a narrow annulus surrounding co - rotation , and leaving the perturbations in place everywhere else , we find that the flow outside co - rotation still overturns , though more slowly",
    ". eventually the instability spreads to co - rotation and mixes dust uniformly throughout the entire box .",
    "this experiment assures us that the instability is not an artifact of @xmath192 . at present",
    "we attribute all this behavior to the fact that our fixed - amplitude initial velocity perturbations are fractionally larger near co - rotation ; i.e. , the initial perturbation @xmath193 is a greater fraction of @xmath123 near co - rotation than elsewhere .",
    "it would therefore be natural to expect the instability to manifest itself most quickly at co - rotation .      for solar or super - solar values of @xmath1940.05 ,",
    "the value of @xmath23 changes little from 0.1 , as runs s5s8 of table [ tab_shear ] attest .",
    "however , @xmath23 changes substantially for sub - solar metallicities  it decreases to @xmath20.02 for @xmath195 ( runs s9s12 ) .",
    "this result indicates that the richardson number alone is an inadequate predictor of instability under general circumstances .",
    "still , because sub - solar metallicities seem less relevant for planet formation , we have not pursued the question of what should replace the richardson criterion , and we content ourselves with citing @xmath196 with the understanding that this result applies only for solar and moderately super - solar metallicities .",
    "values of @xmath114 and @xmath1 at fixed @xmath197 are displayed in figure [ f9 ] . in a minimum - mass nebula",
    "for which @xmath22 , @xmath198 corresponds to a toomre @xmath199 \\approx 25 $ ] , independent of disk radius if @xmath200 , as is approximately the case in standard nebular models . under these conditions ,",
    "our neglect of the dust layer s self - gravity is well justified . only when @xmath201 ( @xmath202 ; see run s8 ) does dust self - gravity become important ( sekiya 1998 ) .",
    "we can not say whether the observed turnover of the dust layer in a fully shearing disk is better ascribed to the kelvin - helmholtz instability ( as studied by , e.g. , chandrasekhar 1961 ) or to the baroclinic instability ( as studied by cabot 1984 , knobloch & spruit 1986 , and arlt & urpin 2004 ) .",
    "both instabilities rely on the vertical shear . for @xmath203 , the maximum vertical shearing frequency @xmath2@xmath204",
    "exceeds , by factors of a few , both the maximum brunt - visl frequency @xmath2@xmath11 ( thereby satisfying the traditional criterion for the khi ) and the rotation frequency @xmath11 ( thereby satisfying the criterion for `` large baroclinity , '' as defined by knobloch & spruit 1986 ) .",
    "an analytic criterion for the baroclinic instability , relevant for non - axisymmetric perturbations , that is valid near the midplane of a radially shearing disk and for arbitrary values of the vertical shear , is not known ( knobloch & spruit 1986 ) .",
    "we have performed numerical simulations of flows near the dust - rich midplanes of protoplanetary disks .",
    "dust particles are assumed small enough that they are perfectly entrained in gas , and disk self - gravity is neglected .",
    "the midplane flow is doubly shearing ; the rotational velocity varies with height according to the vertical gradient in dust density , and it also varies with radius according to the usual keplerian shear .",
    "the simulations are necessarily three - dimensional and performed in a shearing box .    despite the complications introduced by rotation and tidal gravity",
    ", the richardson criterion for the onset of the kelvin - helmholtz instability still proves useful for solar to moderately super - solar height - integrated metallicities .",
    "dust layers characterized by constant richardson number and @xmath2050.05 overturn and mix if @xmath206 , but remain intact at larger @xmath0 .",
    "this result contrasts with the situation when only the coriolis force is accounted for and the radial shear is suppressed : in that case , unstable modes persist for @xmath0 as large as 16 .",
    "but because these `` coriolis - only '' ( and likely baroclinic ; cabot 1984 ) modes at large @xmath0 grow at rates that are substantially slower than the kepler strain rate of @xmath31 , they are stabilized and rendered impotent by the kepler shear .    in hindsight ,",
    "our guess (  [ intro ] ) that the critical @xmath0 dividing stability from instability might only change by a factor of order unity proved correct , though only for solar to moderately super - solar metallicities : we find that @xmath23 for our doubly shearing flows is about half that of the traditional value of 1/4 , if @xmath2050.05 .",
    "this is sensible insofar as @xmath196 gives a vertical shearing frequency @xmath86 that is a few times faster than any of the other frequencies of the problem : the brunt - visl frequency for vertical oscillations ( this reaches a maximum of @xmath2@xmath11 at @xmath26 ) , the kepler strain rate ( @xmath31 ) , and the coriolis turning frequency ( @xmath207 ) .",
    "deeper insights , including an understanding of why @xmath208 for @xmath209 , might be gained by study of the geophysical literature , where doubly shearing , rotating flows are commonplace ( see , e.g. , chapter 7 of pedlosky 1979 , which discusses baroclinic instabilities ) .",
    "we conclude that for a standard , height - integrated , solar metallicity of @xmath194 , the dust density at the midplane can be at most @xmath2@xmath210 greater than the gas density . if we assume a gas density appropriate to a minimum - mass disk , then the maximum total density of gas and dust is still too low , by a factor of @xmath225 , for the marginally stable layer to become gravitationally unstable .",
    "the literature discusses two remedies .",
    "the first is to find ways of enhancing @xmath1 by factors of 310 , thereby increasing the dust - to - gas ratio at the midplane by factors of @xmath230 at fixed @xmath198 ( sekiya 1998 ; youdin & shu 2002 ; see also our figures [ dens_sigma05 ] and [ f9 ] , and run s8 in table 2 ) .",
    "possible means of increasing the height - integrated metallicity include ( i ) decreasing @xmath211 through photoevaporation of gas , ( ii ) increasing @xmath17 by radial drift and pile - up of particles ( youdin & shu 2002 ; youdin & chiang 2004 ) or ( iii ) increasing @xmath17 by radiation blow - back of grains into the rim of a transitional disk ( chiang & murray - clay 2007 ) .",
    "gas giants that form in such a metal - rich environment might be expected to have metallicities enhanced above the solar value by similar factors of 310 .",
    "indeed some hot jupiters have remarkably metal - rich interiors ( sato et al .",
    "alternatively , one can relax the assumption of perfect coupling between dust and gas , and exploit drag instabilities that result from finite momentum stopping times and the backreaction of dust on gas ( youdin & goodman 2005 ; johansen et al .",
    "2007 ) .",
    "we thank anders johansen , bryan johnson , eve ostriker , jack wisdom , and andrew youdin for helpful discussions .",
    "we owe to jeremy goodman an insightful referee s report that brought to light the baroclinic instability .",
