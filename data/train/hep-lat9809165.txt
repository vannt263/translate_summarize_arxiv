    "we consider wilson fermions with or without @xmath0 improvement .",
    "the fermionic action reads @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the wilson - dirac operator : @xmath3 with @xmath4 @xmath5 @xmath6 ( @xmath7 ) being the forward ( backward ) lattice derivative , and where @xmath8 is the wilson mass term : @xmath9 the critical value of the hopping parameter , @xmath10 , is taken to be the limiting value at which the ensemble averaged pion mass vanishes .",
    "we call this limit the chiral limit .    in quenched lattice calculations with wilson fermions",
    "one encounters exceptional configurations  @xcite which give rise to poles in fermionic observables , such as hadron correlators , at small quark masses .",
    "the origin of these poles are real eigenvalues @xmath11 of the wilson - dirac operator @xmath2 at @xmath12 exceptional configurations are particularly aggravating for improved fermions , and they have limited calculations to larger quark masses and larger values of @xmath13 . we expect to find such poles also in the full theory , i.e. with dynamical fermions , at hopping parameters @xmath14 , where @xmath15 refers to the sea quark mass .    in fig .",
    "1 we give an example of an exceptional configuration which we encountered in a recent simulation with improved fermions  @xcite .",
    "we see a dramatic deflection from the anticipated ensemble average .",
    "similar peaks are observed in the @xmath16 and nucleon correlators .",
    "it is quite clear from this figure that the problem of exceptional configurations can not be solved by accumulating larger statistical samples .",
    "bardeen et al .",
    "@xcite identify the eigenvalues ( [ eig ] ) with the zero modes of the continuum theory , and they propose to shift each such @xmath11 to @xmath17 . there are doubts , however , that this identification is correct in general  @xcite . an elegant solution would be to employ neuberger s action  @xcite . but whether this is numerically feasible has still to be seen .",
    "the solution we propose makes use of a freedom in regularizing lattice fermions .",
    "it has the advantage that it is easy to implement numerically , and that it does not change the physics in the chiral limit so that the improvement program  la sheikholeslami and wohlert  @xcite remains unaltered .",
    "we rewrite @xmath18 in ( [ action ] ) as @xmath19 where @xmath20 and @xmath21 are the critical wilson - dirac operator and the physical bare mass , respectively : @xmath22 @xmath23 we then apply a chiral rotation to @xmath20 , @xmath24 and take @xmath25 to be the new fermion matrix .",
    "the resulting action is equally well founded as ( [ action ] ) and ( [ caction ] )  , though , in general , it breaks parity invariance . in fig .",
    "2 we show the effect of the transformation on the eigenvalue spectrum of the wilson - dirac operator for @xmath26 . in this case @xmath20",
    "is anti - hermitian , and all eigenvalues are mapped onto the imaginary axis , as is the case for staggered fermions .",
    "the rotation ( [ transf ] ) is mathematically equivalent to the transformation of the mass : @xmath27 in the following we shall use this transformation .",
    "furthermore we take @xmath26 .",
    "but we found that the method works equally well for angles as small as @xmath28 .",
    "to test the idea , we have looked at exceptional configurations which we encountered in our runs with improved fermions  @xcite on the @xmath29 lattice at @xmath30 .",
    "if the method works at this coupling , we expect that it will work also at larger values of @xmath13 . in fig .",
    "3 we show the pion correlator for a single exceptional configuration before and after the rotation . before the rotation we find a similar peak in the pion correlator as seen in fig .  1 .",
    "after the rotation we find a correlator which is perfectly well behaved .",
    "it turns out to be in good agreement with the ensemble average  @xcite .",
    "note that in first approximation the physical quark mass is left unchanged by the rotation . for comparison",
    "we have computed the pion correlator also for wilson fermions .",
    "the hopping parameter was chosen so as to give roughly the same pion mass .",
    "we find good agreement with the rotated action .",
    "from both , figs .  1 and 3",
    "it follows that the ( suspected ) near - zero eigenmode of @xmath18 acts as a source term , and that the excitation it induces decays exponentially with roughly the mass of the pion . we would not expect to find such a behavior for an instanton configuration",
    "there is also no sign of an abnormal fluctuation found in the case of wilson fermions .",
    "we conclude that the problem of exceptional configurations may be resolved by a chiral rotation of the critical wilson - dirac operator .",
    "the method allows calculations at any quark mass . on top of that ,",
    "the results of the improvement program remain valid .",
