    "discovering high - redshift ( @xmath12 ) galaxies , and understanding their physical nature is of great importance in studying the early universe because these objects are likely sources for reionization of the intergalactic medium ( igm : ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , as the rest - frame uv light from these galaxies shifts to @xmath151  @xmath16 m .",
    "there are two main techniques for finding high - redshift ( @xmath17 ) galaxies : ( 1 ) the lyman - break or dropout method ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , selected based on strong absorption in their spectral energy distribution ( sed ) at wavelengths shortward of redshifted lyman-@xmath9due to igm hi absorption , and ( 2 ) the narrow - band imaging technique , which identifies galaxies with a strong , redshifted lyman-@xmath9emission line using narrow - band filters ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "a unique advantage of narrow - band selected galaxies is that these galaxies are more likely to be confirmed via spectroscopic followup because they are pre - selected based on the strong lyman-@xmath9emission line .",
    "on the other hand , lbgs selected via the broad - band dropout method are unbiased in their selection ( unlike lyman-@xmath9selected galaxies ) , and lbg surveys probe larger cosmological volumes due to broader filters .",
    "currently there are many candidate lbgs ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) at redshifts much greater than @xmath5   ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    with growing samples of @xmath5  galaxies , we are able to calculate the rest - frame uv luminosity function ( lf ) , which is a simple yet powerful probe of the early universe .",
    "the luminosity function allows us to constrain the observed number density of star - forming galaxies from which we can estimate ( with some assumptions ) the number of hydrogen - ionizing photons available to reionize the igm .",
    "in addition , the observed luminosity function allows us to study the galaxy evolution by comparing the number density of galaxies at different redshifts .",
    "several studies have focused on understanding the evolution of the uv luminosity function from @xmath18 to 6 and find that there is a significant decrease in the number density of uv bright galaxies from low to high redshifts ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "if this trend continues , we expect even a greater decline in the number density of galaxies at redshift @xmath12 .",
    "current observations at @xmath12 suggest a strong evolution in the characteristic magnitude @xmath19 -19.8 mag @xcite compared with @xmath19 - 20.9 mag at @xmath20 @xcite .",
    "most of these studies , especially at @xmath5 , rely on _ hst _",
    "observations which have the advantage of probing fainter galaxies , however with smaller survey areas .",
    "recently , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite found several candidates using ground - based observations , which have the advantage of surveying larger areas and thus probing brighter , rarer galaxies .",
    "while it is relatively easy to construct the luminosity function , its accuracy depends on a number of systematics , including the degree of contamination of the @xmath5   galaxy sample .",
    "it is affected by contaminants that mimic the colors of high - redshift galaxies .",
    "the main contaminants of @xmath5  lbgs are galactic brown dwarfs , low - redshift ( @xmath21 ) dust obscured galaxies with very faint continuum in the visible bands , and transient objects .",
    "the brown dwarf stars may be separated from ( resolved ) galaxies using high angular - resolution imaging .",
    "however , the ability to resolve galaxies can become unreliable at the faint magnitudes and compact sizes typical of @xmath5  galaxies , even with the _ hst _  observations .",
    "for example , the rejection of point sources from @xmath5  samples precludes the possibility that some @xmath5  galaxies have morphologies that are unresolved even at _ hst _  resolution ( fwhm @xmath2202 which corresponds to 1 kpc at @xmath23 ) , leading to sample incompleteness .",
    "these uncertainties need to be accounted for when constructing the luminosity function .",
    "in addition to studying the uv luminosity function , understanding the physical properties of high - redshift galaxies is important to link their evolution during the early stages of galaxy formation to galaxies at other epochs . as we probe redshifts @xmath24 ,",
    "galaxies on average have smaller stellar masses @xmath25 m@xmath26 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "photometric redshifts derived using medium - band filters have much narrower probability distributions compared to the broad - band derived photometric redshifts owing to the higher spectral resolution ( r@xmath1010 ) of the medium - band filters .",

    "we observed a 155 arcmin@xmath3 area in the candels / cosmos field @xcite centered at ra : 10:00:31 and dec:+02:17:21 , using the fourstar instrument , as part of the ongoing fourstar galaxy evolution survey ( zfourge ) during 2011 - 2012 . the fourstar instrument ( persson et al .",

    "we processed all raw images using a custom designed idl - based pipeline ( described in more detail in labb et al in preparation ) adapted from the newfirm medium band survey data reduction pipeline ( nmbs : @xcite ) .",
    "the data quality of the fourstar images is excellent and the point - spread function ( psf ) fwhm for the stacked fourstar images correspond to 0.55 , 0.52 , 0.51 , 0.51 , 0.57 , & 0.48 arcsec in the _ j@xmath36 _  through _ k@xmath39 _  filters , respectively .",
    "in addition to this data set , we used publicly available data in the optical ( subaru @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath42 , & acs @xmath49 ) , deep near - ir   _ hst_wfc3 _ j@xmath44 _   & _ h@xmath45 _  from the candels survey @xcite , and infrared irac @xcite data .",
    "we also used deep 3.6 and 4.5@xmath50 m images ( ashby et al 2013 submitted ) from the spitzer extended deep survey ( @xmath51 ) ; 5.8 and 8.0@xmath50 m data from the spitzer space telescope @xcite .",
    "table  1 presents the central wavelengths and limiting magnitudes for the zfourge data as well as information for the ancillary data .",
    "the psf among different bands varies due to differing central wavelengths , different instruments used for imaging , and in the case of ground - based observations , due to different seeing conditions .",
    "we convolved all images to a reference image having the broadest psf - fwhm ( in our case the subaru @xmath52 image with psf fwhm=08 ) . in each band , we first constructed an empirical psf by identifying stars and stacking them with their centers aligned .",
    "we then used an idl routine , deconv@xmath53tool @xcite , to construct a kernel to convolve the image psf to match the stellar psf .",
    "figure  2 shows the curve - of - growth of point sources in the images following the convolution process .",
    "as shown in the figure ( left panel ) , the relative flux for point sources in each band is matched to better than 2% for all apertures with radii larger than @xmath54 .",
    "the photometry in circular apertures was optimized for faint , compact sources .",
    "figure  2 ( right panel ) shows the s / n for point sources measured in circular apertures as a function of aperture radius .",
    "the s / n is maximized for point sources with apertures of radii @xmath55 .",
    "therefore we use circular apertures with diameter of @xmath56 for the photometry in our analysis .      as mentioned earlier , to extend the wavelength coverage of our candidates and to derive the physical properties as accurately as possible , we used recent deep spitzer irac data ( ashby et al 2013 submitted ) in two bands ( 3.6 @xmath57 , 4.5 @xmath57 ) obtained from the seds survey .",
    "however , due to its low resolution , neighboring objects tend to blend resulting in incorrect flux measurements . to circumvent this issue , we used galfit @xcite code to measure the object fluxes , as described below",
    ". first , we fit the two dimensional surface brightness profiles of all objects within 7  of the @xmath5  candidate ( excluding the @xmath5  galaxy ) and subtracted these fits to obtain a residual image .",
    "we then measured photometry of the @xmath5  candidates from the irac data using the idl procedure aper , measuring the flux in a fixed 2   diameter aperture and correcting to the total flux using the aperture corrections derived by taking the ratio between 2  and 15   diameter aperture fluxes of isolated sources .",
    "finally , we derived the uncertainties by measuring the @xmath58 in apertures of the same size as above , randomly placed in regions devoid of objects in the irac images .",
    "we identified sources in each of the images using source extractor software ( sextractor : @xcite ) in dual image mode . in this mode",
    ", a detection image is used to identify the pixels associated with each object , while the fluxes are measured from a distinct photometry image .",
    "for the detection image , we used a @xmath59 image , which optimally sums multiple images ( accounting for varying s / n ) for source detection @xcite . the @xmath59 image ( @xmath60 )",

    "images using swarp @xcite .",
    "we measured object photometry from the psf - matched images in a fixed aperture size of 1.1  diameter .",
    "while sextractor estimates the noise for each object , this estimate is incorrect in the convolved images as it does not account for correlated noise , which results from the image reduction and convolution processes . to estimate the flux uncertainty for each object in the convolved images we followed an empirical approach described in @xcite . to estimate the pixel - to - pixel noise we measured the rms background variation as a function of linear size @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the area of an aperture .",
    "first , we measured the sky flux in increasingly larger apertures that are randomly placed in the psf - matched - convovled image , taking care to avoid detected objects . from the distribution of fluxes measured in a given aperture size , we measured the standard deviation , @xmath63 .",
    "the 1@xmath63 error on the flux was then calculated using equation 5 from @xcite .",

    "the eazy code ( v2.1 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) contains seven different templates spanning a large range of galaxy colors and incorporates nebular emission lines .",
    "while our @xmath5  candidate selection is based primarily on a color - color selection , to increase the reliability of our candidates , we also require that each of the candidates have photometric redshifts @xmath12 .",

    "it can be seen that the star - forming galaxies occupy a specific region of the color - color space .",
    "we identified 9 objects in total satisfying the selection criteria from equation 1 .",
    "based on several tests described in the following sections , out of the 9 objects in the initial sample ( hereafter initial source list ) , four objects are identified as @xmath5  lbg candidates , four objects are identified as brown dwarf stars and the remaining object is identified as a likely foreground dust - obscured galaxy at @xmath67 . to minimize the contamination from stars and foreground galaxies , we further refine the color - color selection ( section 3.3 ) that include only the robust @xmath5  lbg candidates ( figure  3 ; shaded region ) .",
    "figure 4 shows postage stamps of these @xmath5  lbg candidates , as well as one likely t - dwarf star for comparison .",
    "the color - color selection of @xmath5   lbg candidates suffers from several possible sources of contamination including image artifacts ( or spurious detections ) , nearby cool brown dwarf stars which mimic high - redshift galaxy colors , intermediate redshift galaxies with faint continuum in the visible bands , and transient sources including supernovae or asteroids . in this and the following sections we discuss in detail the likelihood of any of these contaminating sources entering the initial source list .",
    "in the @xmath5   lbg selection , we require that each of the objects is detected with s / n @xmath68 in more than one band redward of the @xmath42   filter .",
    "this requirement makes spurious detections due to either background or electronic noise extremely unlikely .",
    "it is possible that transient objects including asteroids , and supernovae can be detected in more than one band .",
    "however , with the availability of two epoch data , separated by about one year , we can eliminate any transients by comparing their positional shift between the two epochs .",

    "the remaining compact source , zf25035 has a stellarity index of 0.6 , suggesting that it might be a compact galaxy rather than a point source . in the following sections , we discuss additional tests to distinguish between the possibility that this object is a point source , or a very compact @xmath5   galaxy candidate .",
    "due to the availability of medium - band photometry , in addition to using stellarity indices and fwhm , we can use a spectral fitting technique whereby observed spectral templates are fitted to the medium - band photometry .",
    "this method works very well especially in identifying t - dwarf stars because the central wavelengths of the fourstar medium - band filters trace the strong absorption features of t - dwarf stars ; this would not be possible using broad - band photometry .",

    "figure 7 shows the surface brightness ( _ j@xmath44 _ ) profiles of five objects : two t - dwarf candidates ( with medium - band colors indicative of brown dwarfs and high stellarity ) ; two @xmath5   candidate galaxies including the compact zf25035 , and a random object selected from the subsample of all objects with stellarity @xmath95 .",
    "the two t - dwarf stars both have stellarity indices @xmath300.9 and have fwhm nearly equivalent to the expected wfc3 psf fwhm ( 02 ) .",
    "their surface brightness profiles are also indistinguishable from each other . while the compact @xmath5   galaxy has a fwhm equal to that of the point sources , its surface brightness profile resembles the other @xmath5   candidate galaxy",
    "this is also supported by its lower stellarity index of 0.6 and thus strengthens our earlier conclusion that this object ( zf25035 ) is a compact @xmath5   lbg candidate .",
    "moreover , it shows that at @xmath5 , there is a population of very compact ( fwhm @xmath961 kpc ) star - forming galaxies that are unresolved in typical image quality of ground - based imaging .",
    "note however , that the fwhm or surface brightness profile can become unreliable at fainter magnitudes .    to demonstrate this ,",
    "we have chosen a random star - like object with stellarity @xmath95 and fwhm similar to those of the compact galaxy , but with slightly fainter magnitude . as illustrated in figure  7 ( grey dashed line ) , the surface brightness profile of the random object is indistinguishable from galaxies despite its stellar - like fwhm .",
    "this comparison demonstrates that the star versus compact galaxy classification based on either fwhm , stellarity index , or even surface brightness profile would lead to mis - identification , especially at fainter magnitudes ( @xmath97  mag ) , even with _ hst_-like image quality . in such cases ,",
    "the near - ir medium - band photometry will allow us to cleanly distinguish between the spectral features of brown dwarf stars and @xmath5   galaxy candidates .    in summary , out of five compact objects",
    ", four objects are classified as brown dwarf stars , and the remaining object zf25035 is classified as a compact galaxy .",
    "eliminating such objects due to their misidentification could affect the bright end of the uv luminosity function where objects are rare .",
    "this may especially be of concern for the case of ground - based data when such compact galaxies are unresolved .",
    "using the initial color selection criteria defined in equation 1 , out of the 9 objects in the initial source list , four objects are identified as nearby dwarf stars based on their fwhm and spectral template fitting test , one object is likely a foreground galaxy based on the s / n(@xmath89 ) in the visible @xmath59 image , and the remaining four objects are identified as @xmath5   lbg candidates . to select the most robust @xmath5   lbg candidates , we revise the @xmath5   candidate selection criteria using medium - band filters as follows .",
    "@xmath98    this color - color selection is indicated in figure  3 as the shaded region within the dotted polygon .",
    "as can be seen , this color - color selection isolates @xmath5   galaxy candidates from both low - redshift red galaxies and brown dwarf stars .",
    "therefore , our new color selection criteria using the fourstar medium - band filters appears to provide a @xmath5   lbg sample that is free of contaminants , although future surveys ( including spectroscopic confirmations ) are needed to confirm this .",
    "the photometry of all three @xmath5   candidate galaxies is shown in table 1 , while figure  4 and figure  6 show postage stamps and best - fit seds obtained from eazy , respectively .",
    "while this refined selection yields three robust @xmath5   lbg candidates , one of the candidates ( zf26343 in figure  3 ) is excluded by this selection ( which would have been selected if we had used the selection criteria from equation 1 ) , and will lead to sample incompleteness thereby affecting the uv luminosity function .",
    "we prevent this incompleteness by simulating the effective survey volume that is enclosed within the shaded region in figure  3 .",

    "the lyman-@xmath9  fluxes obtained from the @xmath173 method are similar to the recent observations of spectroscopically confirmed lbgs at @xmath110=7.008 and @xmath1767.109 , with line fluxes 1.62 @xmath177 and 1.21 @xmath178 @xmath166 , respectively @xcite .",
    "these line fluxes are accessible to deep spectroscopy with @xmath308 m telescopes , and thus these two candidates provide good targets for future spectroscopic followup .      the specific star formation rate , ssfr ( sfr/@xmath179 ) provides a way to quantify the evolution of mass build - up given a certain sfr .",
    "many observations suggest that the ssfr is nearly constant from @xmath5 to @xmath20 @xcite .",

    "however , recent studies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) suggest that there is a stronger evolution in the ssfr from low - redshift to high - redshifts , than suggested by previous studies .",
    "thus , to resolve this uncertainty among different studies , large samples of high - redshift galaxies are needed .    here",
    "we estimate the ssfr for the two brightest galaxies in our @xmath5   sample using the more accurate physical parameters derived from the fits to the fourstar medium - band + hst + irac data .",
    "we derived the sfrs using the best - fit seds : for the brightest lbg ( zf13965 ) , the median sfr=77.6@xmath180 @xmath157 yr@xmath11 , much smaller compared with the 2nd brightest lbg ( zf25035 ) with median sfr=285.7@xmath181 @xmath157 yr@xmath11(table 5 ) .",
    "our derived ssfr @xmath10 13  gyr@xmath11 for the two brightest @xmath5   lbg candidate is slightly higher compared with the values derived for lower luminosity ( and lower mass ) galaxies at @xmath5 , which implies a nearly constant ssfr from @xmath5 to @xmath20 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) for galaxies over approximately a decade in stellar mass ( @xmath182  @xmath157  to @xmath183  @xmath157 ) .",
    "these ssfrs favors the idea that galaxies at these epochs have rising star - formation histories such that the ssfr is nearly independent of mass at a fixed redshift ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "models with constant or declining sfhs would imply decreasing ssfr with increasing mass at fixed redshift , which is disfavored .      to compare the effect of different extinction laws on the derived physical properties of @xmath5   lbgs , we derived the best - fit seds ( see section 5.1.2 ) and physical properties of the two brightest @xmath5   lbg candidates using calzetti and smc dust extinction laws .    for the brightest lbg ( zf13965 ) , all derived parameters ( stellar mass , age , and @xmath59 ) using smc dust extinction law decrease except for the dust extinction ( see table 5 ) . for the 2nd brightest lbg ( zf25035 ) , stellar mass , extinction and @xmath59 either decrease or remain unchanged except for the stellar age .",
    "a major difference among these two lbgs is that the dust extinction for zf25035 is significantly reduced ( @xmath184=0.9 ) when using the smc extinction law ( see fig .",
    "this smaller extinction value also gives rise to the lower sfr compared with the calzetti dust extinction - derived sfr .",
    "this demonstrates that the assumption of the extinction law affects the interpretation of the dust content in high - redshift galaxies .",
    "in particular , the smc - type law - which may be more applicable in these distant galaxies @xcite - reduces the implied dust content compared to a calzetti - type law for low - redshift luminous starburst galaxies .",
    "we have obtained a sample of @xmath5   galaxies from a deep near - ir survey ( zfourge ) using medium - band filters for the first time .",
    "we define a color - color selection criteria for the near - ir medium - band filters , which cleanly isolate @xmath5   lbg candidates from brown dwarf stars and low - redshift galaxies . using our criteria",
    "we have identified three robust @xmath5   candidate lbgs in a survey area of about 155 arcmin@xmath3 in the cosmos field , which has very deep publically available data .",

    "our principal findings are summarized below .",
    "_ stars vs compact galaxies@xmath2 _ while the contamination from nearby t - dwarf stars is a serious concern for dropout - selected galaxies , especially when using the ground - based broad - band photometry , the fourstar medium - band filters allow us to cleanly distinguish between nearby dwarf stars and high - redshift galaxies that are relatively compact .",
    "one of the three @xmath5   lbgs in our sample ( zf25035 ) is very compact and indistinguishable from a point source at ground - based resolution ( and possibly unresolved even by hst ) .",
    "our ability to distinguish this object from cool stars is possible only due to the availability of multiwavelength medium - band photometry .",
    "moreover , this demonstrates that there exists a population of very compact galaxies at @xmath5 .",
    "_ bright end of the @xmath5   uv luminosty function@xmath2 _ using the number density of @xmath5   galaxies obtained using dropout technique and corrected for incompleteness , the rest - frame stepwise uv luminosity function at @xmath5   shows a moderate evolution from @xmath8 .",
    "the number density of bright lbgs ( @xmath120@xmath10 - 21.5 ) increases by a factor of 4 from @xmath5   to @xmath135 albeit with large error bars .",
    "this is consistent with other ground - based studies but implies lesser evolution compared to the factor of 10 increase implied by some _ hst_-based studies .",

    "the best - fit sed model with broad - band + medium - band photometry yields lower photometric redshifts , and much tighter redshift probability distribution compared to the @xmath139@xmath108 derived using only broad - band photometry ( figure   10 ) .",
    "this is also true for our 2nd brightest object .",

    ", @xmath114 changes from -1.88 to -2.08 when fourstar medium - band photometry is included .",
    "3 .   the sed modeling prefers a lower dust attenuation with median e(b - v)=@xmath185 for broad - band photometry , while it increases to median e(b - v)=@xmath186 when including medium - band photometry .",
    "the fourstar bands allow for redder uv colors which increases the range of permitted values for e(b - v ) . comparing the above values , derived using the calzetti dust law , with the e(b - v ) derived using smc - like dust law , we find that the probability distribution from the latter case is much narrower and shifts towards lower values ( figure 15 ) .",
    "4 .   including the fourstar medium - band filters , the sed modeling yields narrower probability distribution for stellar mass for the two most luminous objects in our sample .",
    "we argue that adding additional bands shifts the allowed regions of the stellar - population parameter space , improving our physical understanding of the galaxies .",
    "we find that the presence of irac photometry is also important to better constrain the best - fit stellar masses .",
    "we predict the lyman-@xmath9  equivalent widths and line fluxes of the two brightest candidates and find that the presence of lyman-@xmath9  line influences the derived physical properties of @xmath5   candidates .",

    "the ssfrs for the two most luminous galaxies are slightly larger compared with other _ lower mass _ galaxies at @xmath5 .",
    "this favors the ideal that the sfr increases with increasing stellar mass at this redshift .",
    "while it is early to reach robust conclusions about the effect of medium - band photometry on the derived properties of @xmath5   galaxies , medium - band filters will likely provide better constraints on the physical properties , due to their narrower redshift probability distributions , compared to the broad - band photometry .",
