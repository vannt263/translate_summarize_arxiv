    "@xcite ) concerned with the microscopic study of bose system s properties a good description of the heat capacity of liquid helium-4 in the whole temperature range has not yet been created .",
    "the first attempts were made by brout @xcite where it was shown in the first order of perturbation theory for the free energy of non - ideal bose system that the presence of interaction does change the order of the phase transition . in @xcite the thermodynamic functions of liquid helium-4 at all temperatures were obtained using the two - time temperature green s function formalism .",
    "a good agreement of the specific heat at low temperatures with experimental data was obtained and the temperature of phase transition was calculated as @xmath1 @xmath2 .",
    "the success of such an approach lies in the application of the experimentally measured structure factor of liquid helium-4 extrapolated to zero temperature @xcite instead of the interparticle interaction potential .",
    "a good agreement of the heat capacity curve with relevant experimental data for the temperatures below the temperature of the @xmath3-transition was obtained in ref .",

    "@xcite the density matrix formalism with the functional optimization of the jastrow wave - function parameters was used to describe the properties of liquid helium .",
    "the results for internal energy agree well with experimental data for the temperatures below the critical one .",
    "it was shown that by taking into account the dynamic two - particle correlations only one can obtain the value of the critical temperature 3.4  k. thus for good agreement with experiments one needs to take into account higher - order approximations , which are specifically related to the concept of effective mass of the helium atom in a liquid .    in recent years",
    "much attention has been paid to the study of the atom s effective mass in liquid helium because in this way part of the interaction could be taken into account accordingly to feynman s idea @xcite . however , there is no satisfactory formula for the effective mass of the helium atom in the liquid at arbitrary temperatures .",
    "various scholars were mostly concerned with the value of the effective mass at @xmath4 .",
    "isihara and samulski @xcite have used the value of @xmath5 to agree the theoretically calculated sound branch of the excitation spectrum with the corresponding experimental data . in ref .",
    "@xcite the effective mass @xmath6 was obtained on the basis of the liquid helium-4 structure factor measurements . in ref .",
    "@xcite the interatomic potential was preserved as the input information , but in part the contribution of higher correlations was `` transferred '' to the kinetic energy term . in this way",
    "the mass of particles was renormalized that is somehow in correlation with the approach of ref . @xcite . as a result of such a renormalization the value of @xmath7",
    "was obtained using green s function method .",
    "it was shown in refs .",
    "@xcite that the above - mentioned mass renormalization leads to the expressions obtained for the effective mass of the @xmath8he impurity atom in liquid @xmath0he but with the replacement of the `` pure '' @xmath8he atom mass by the @xmath0he atom mass .",
    "the aim of this paper is to calculate the heat capacity of liquid helium above the temperature of phase transition .",

    "@xcite ( where the effective mass is a free parameter of the theory ) , forms the basis of these calculations . thus , further we calculate step by step with the help of thermodynamic perturbation theory the quasi - particle spectrum of the bose system at the temperatures higher than the critical one , then we obtain the effective mass and numerically analyze the behavior of the heat capacity .",

    "the most interesting features of these calculations occur at the region in a close vicinity of the temperature of bose condensation . in the statistical operator ,",
    "let us pass to the interaction representation and write down the partition function in the following way : @xmath25 where the quantity @xmath26 and the braces stand for statistical averaging with the hamiltonian @xmath27 .",
    "the first multiplier @xmath28 is the partition function of the ideal bose gas .",
    "the second one and the third one take into account the inter - particle interaction completely .",
    "next , we rewrite , with the help of the hubbard - stratonovich transformation , the @xmath22-exponent in terms of the functional integral and we also average it by the states of the ideal bose gas @xmath29 where we use the notations @xmath30 and @xmath31 is the matsubara frequency and @xmath32 here the symbol @xmath33 denotes the integration over real and imaginary parts of the @xmath34 variables from the half space of all possible values of @xmath35 due to the symmetry @xmath36 . the polarization operator @xmath37 here and thereafter @xmath38 is the filling factor of the ideal bose gas",

    "( [ z_int ] ) when the partition function is written in terms of functional integrals was used successfully in the theory of fermi systems with coulombic interaction in ref .",
    "the fact that in the gaussian approximation of the calculation of the functional integral we recover random phase approximation ( rpa ) correctly is a great advantage of our method .",

    "the structure of expressions ( [ omega_1 ] ) , ( [ omega_2 ] ) clearly shows that they are `` in correlation '' with the formulae obtained in ref .",

    "we use rpa . notwithstanding the simplicity of this approximation it `` catches '' certain important features of the behavior of the system .",
    "it is not surprising because rpa effectively sums up an infinite set of terms of the perturbation theory divergent near phase transition point .",

    "admittedly , the ideal gas dispersion relation should be replaced by the exact one - particle spectrum , but further analysis will not be influenced by this replacement qualitatively .",
    "let us consider the value of the integral in eq .",
    "( [ delta_d ] ) at a small @xmath79 and assume for definiteness that the temperature is higher than the critical one .",
    "then substituting @xmath80 , and @xmath81 we obtain @xmath82.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] it turns out that this integral equals zero identically .",
    "moreover even after the substitution of @xmath83 ( [ pi - simpl ] ) , the integral in eq .",
    "( [ delta_d ] ) equals zero too .",
    "thus it is shown , with a realistic restriction on the fourier transform of the potential energy , i.e. the absence of linear and quadratic terms in the expansion of @xmath17 at a small @xmath84 , that @xmath85 .",
    "the situation is quite different in the critical region . here",
    "the leading order asymptote is @xmath86 ( it is not hard to ascertain taking into account the properties of @xmath87 in this region ) , which obviously is a hint at the following behavior of the one - particle spectrum @xmath88 ( @xmath89 ) at the critical temperature .",
    "clearly one can not obtain this result using a simple perturbative approach .",
    "hence , having separated the non - analytic problematic part of the spectrum ( the second term in eq .",
    "( [ delta_xi_2 ] ) ) we can consider the `` non - universal '' one , i.e. the remainder of eq .",
    "( [ delta_xi_2 ] ) .",
    "precisely this expression will determine the observed non - universal properties of the bose liquid .",
    "the latter calculations are linked to the summation over the matsubara frequency in the last term of eq .",

    "the leading - order non - vanishing term of the quasi - particle dispersion relation is quadratic over the wave - vector .",
    "we recall that @xmath85 and hence its contribution is not significant .",
    "so , for reasons of simplification we assume the spectrum to be a quadratic free - particle one , but with the normalized mass .    as we single out the `` problematic '' contribution to the quasi - particle spectrum expanding second and third sums of eq .",

    "@xcite where a different method was used for the calculations .    at the end of this section",
    "one more remark on the applicability of the formula for @xmath96 has to be made .",
    "the approximation of the exact spectrum of collective modes by the bogoliubov spectrum on the one hand made it possible to obtain the analytical expression ( [ delt ] ) , on the other hand it brought us beyond the limits of rpa .",
    "it is hard to assess the accuracy of such a trick , but it can be justified only considering that the fourier transform of a two - particle potential is a rapidly decreasing function .",
    "then the main contribution to the integral over the wave - vector comes from a lower limit of integration where the bogoliubov spectrum completely coincides with the exact one .",
    "the expression for the grand canonical potential derived in the second section of this paper is applicable only for the temperatures higher than the critical one . to describe the @xmath3-transition phenomenon , in particular thermodynamic functions ,",
    "let us use an approach based on the density matrix of the bose liquid @xcite . using this approach",

    "1 quite well up to the critical temperature .    now we are in position to calculate the renormalized temperature of the bose condensation .",

    "@xmath140 the inconsistency occurs : the behavior of the calculated heat capacity is very similar to the behavior of the experimental curve , but shifted upward almost in a parallel way .",

    "the circles show experimental data from refs . @xcite . ]",
    "further , let us calculate the heat capacity of liquid helium-4 with taking into account the effective mass of the helium atom in the liquid ( curve 2 )",
    ". at low temperatures the heat capacity with taking into account the effective mass of the bose particles practically coincides with curve 1 , which agrees well with experimental data .",
    "this shows a weak dependence of the heat capacity on the effective mass below the temperature of phase transition . as is seen from fig .",
    "2 , the calculated curve 2 ( unlike curve 1 ) agrees quite well with the experimental one .",
    "it is related to the fact that by using the effective mass we partially take into account a contribution from three- and four - particle correlations .",
    "it is not surprising that in close vicinity of the bose condensation point the theoretically calculated heat capacity deviates most significantly from the experimental curve .",
    "it is solely related to the inconsistency of our description near the critical point because the non - analytical part ( [ delta_d ] ) of the one - particle spectrum , which makes a significant contribution in the thermodynamic functions at @xmath141 , is disregarded in our approach .",
    "one has to use renormalization group methods @xcite for the correct description of the heat capacity in this temperature region .",
    "in this paper we succeed in deriving quite well an agreement of the heat capacity curve of liquid helium with experimental data practically for all temperatures .",
    "the application of the thermodynamic functions of the bose liquid obtained with the help of the hamiltonian averaging combined with a one - particle spectrum derivation were the key moments of the calculations .",
    "notwithstanding the simplicity of the spectrum calculation we obtained quite interesting results .",
    "in particular , we can decompose the part of the quasiparticle spectrum that is responsible for the non - analyticity in the bose condensation point and show that this term of spectrum has no effect on the physical observables in the undercritical temperature region .",
    "so , an attempt is made to justify microscopically the idea that the @xmath3-transition in a real quantum liquid is very similar to the bose - einstein condensation phenomena of the ideal gas `` slightly '' deformed by the interaction between the particles ( keeping in mind the non - universal properties of the system ) .",
    "the calculation found that the long wave - length limit of the `` non - universal '' part of the one - particle spectrum is quadratic over the wave - vector , i.e. very similar to the dispersion relation of the ideal gas but with a new mass . in the general case",
    "it is shown that this new mass at low temperatures is always greater than the mass of particles , and thus , the presence of the interaction at least in our approximation always lowers the critical temperature .",
    "another feature of the developed theory , perhaps a bit unexpected , is that even this simple temperature dependence of the effective mass improves the behavior of the heat capacity curve in the undercritical region and does not affect it in the condensate phase . hence , the quantum - statistical approach based on the density matrix is suitable for describing thermodynamic properties of such a strongly - interacting bose liquid as the helium-4 liquid not only in the limits of low and high temperatures , but for the entire temperature range ."
