    "<S> with the goal of measuring localization in disordered interacting systems , we examine the finite - size scaling of the geometrically - averaged density of states calculated from the local green s function with finite energy resolution . </S>",

    "<S> dmft 71.30.+h,71.23.-k , 71.23.an , 71.27.+a    significant disorder , for example due to non - stoichiometric doping , is a feature of many materials , and may in fact play a key role in many interesting behaviors , especially when combined with electronic correlations . </S>",
    "<S> the study of systems with both disorder and interactions has a long history,@xcite but it has been difficult to access the regime in which both are strong , where the physics of both anderson localization and the mott gap are significant . </S>",
    "<S> the technique of dynamical mean field theory@xcite ( dmft ) has been very successful in the study of systems with strong interactions , and there has recently been interest in applying it to disordered systems.@xcite dmft calculates the local green s function , @xmath0 </S>",
    "<S> . how can information on localization be drawn from this ?    </S>",
    "<S> the geometrically - averaged density of states ( gados ) appears to be ideally suited to the task . </S>",
    "<S> this is the geometric average over sites of the local density of states ( ldos ) which is obtained directly from the local green s function : @xmath1^{1/n } , \\\\ </S>",
    "<S> \\rho ( { \\bf r}_i,\\omega ) & = & -{1 \\over \\pi } { \\rm i m } g({\\bf r}_i,{\\bf r}_i , \\omega+i\\gamma)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which is exact in the limit @xmath2 . in an infinite system , @xmath3 at the fermi level is an order parameter for the anderson transition , being nonzero when states at the fermi level are extended and zero when they become localized . </S>",
    "<S> this is because when wavefunctions at a given energy become localized in real space , the ldos at that energy becomes discrete : localized wavefunctions at the same energy are well separated in position so the ldos at that energy goes to zero far from the wavefunction centers .    to consider specific disorder configurations , it is necessary to work with finite size systems , and in this case finite - size scaling analysis of the gados </S>",
    "<S> must be performed . </S>",
    "<S> this procedure is well studied in non - interacting systems for which single - particle wavefunctions can be calculated , providing perfect energy resolution . in a numerical calculation on an interacting system , however , the green s function is obtained for finite @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> we have explored the impact this has on the scaling of the gados in the context of a noninteracting model @xmath5 with site energies , @xmath6 , distributed with probability @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> the width of the potential distribution , @xmath8 , parameterizes the strength of the disorder . </S>",
    "<S> the model is solved exactly by numerical diagonalization using the lapack libraries . in earlier </S>",
    "<S> work,@xcite we calculated the local density of states within a finite energy resolution @xmath4 using a simple binning procedure : @xmath9 each state which falls in the energy window is assigned equal weight . in this case , we demonstrated that the gados scales as a function of an effective length scale : @xmath10 where @xmath11 acts as an effective inelastic mean free path , limiting the relevant system size . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath11 can also be seen as the system size divided by the average number of states in a bin : @xmath12 where in one dimension @xmath13 is the average energy spacing between states and @xmath14 is the density of states .    </S>",
    "<S> here we model more accurately the way the green s function introduces finite energy resolution : @xmath15}. \\label{lor}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] all results shown are at the band center on one - dimensional systems with disorder strength @xmath16 , for which all states are localized .    . </S>",
    "<S> all points represent averages over at least 1000 disorder configurations . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath17 is the system size , and @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the density of states . </S>",
    "<S> ( a ) square energy bin ( eqn .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ box ] ) ) with constant width @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> ( b ) lorentzian energy bin ( eqn .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ lor ] ) ) with constant @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> ( c ) and ( d ) lorentzian energy bin with @xmath20.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 1(a ) shows the gados as a function of system size for three non - zero values of @xmath4 using the square binning in eqn .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ box ] ) reported earlier.@xcite fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 1(b ) shows the gados as a function of system size for the same @xmath4 values using the lorentzian binning in eqn .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ lor ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> two features are immediately apparent : the lack of exponential decay and the overall inflation of the gados . with the lorentzian bin , _ all _ states contribute to the sum in eqn .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ lor ] ) with rapidly decreasing weight away from @xmath21 . despite the small weight assigned to them , </S>",
    "<S> the many states outside the peak of the lorentzian have a dramatic impact on the gados . </S>",
    "<S> this is because when these states are centered , in real space , at positions with otherwise small ldos they can significantly increase the ldos . even a modest increase in the _ minimum _ values of the ldos causes a dramatic increase in the gados .    </S>",
    "<S> a second important distinction between the two binning schemes arises in the limit @xmath22 . in this limit , for each @xmath21 there will be disorder configurations for which ( i ) in the square bin case there are no states in a bin and ( ii ) for the lorentzian bin case no state has significant weight . in the case of the square bin </S>",
    "<S> , we removed these bins from the average . however , there is no systematic way to do this in the lorentzian case . </S>",
    "<S> the inclusion of these states dramatically lowers the configuration averaged ldos and hence the gados even below the @xmath23 value .    </S>",
    "<S> it appears to be possible to account for the behavior of @xmath24 with lorentzian binning within the framework of an effective length ; however , a different form of @xmath25 is required . in the square bin case , in the limit of small @xmath4 , @xmath26 , because by construction there is always at least one state in each bin . in the lorentzian bin case , </S>",
    "<S> the average number of states in a bin may be less than one . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath25 is now simply equal to @xmath27 . </S>",
    "<S> this is consistent with the nearly size independent results when a fixed value of gamma is used . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 1(c ) shows the gados as a function of system size using bin widths @xmath28 . </S>",
    "<S> fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 1(d ) presents the same data plotted versus @xmath29 showing scaling . </S>",
    "<S> the key point is that there is no limit in which the finite energy resolution is irrelevant .    in conclusion </S>",
    "<S> , there appears to be no finite - size scaling of the gados calculated from the local green s function with fixed energy resolution , and the scaling which occurs when @xmath30 arises at least in part from physics unrelated to localization . </S>",
    "<S> we suggest that other measures of localization , such as the inverse participation ratio , which do not share the extreme sensitivity to small values of the ldos may be more effective than the gados in interacting systems , although changes to the scaling due to finite energy resolution will still need to be addressed . </S>"
