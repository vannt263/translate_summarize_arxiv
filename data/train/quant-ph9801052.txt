    "when an optical cavity containing a nonlinear medium approaches a bistability turning point @xcite , the fluctuations of the incoming beam are squeezed @xcite .",
    "nearly perfect squeezing is expected when the nonlinear medium is a lossless kerr medium @xcite . squeezing was experimentally demonstrated at the output of a bistable cavity containing an atomic beam @xcite or a cloud of cold atoms released from a magneto - optical trap @xcite . a lot of theoretical work has been devoted to the case where the nonlinear medium consists in two - level atoms @xcite .",
    "most theoretical treatments have simplified the description of the field - matter interaction by modelizing the laser beam as a plane - wave .",
    "it is however clear that the description of the bistable behaviour of the cavity has to be modified to account for the transverse gaussian profile of the laser beam @xcite .",
    "this is also true for the predictions concerning field fluctuations at the output of the cavity , as shown in references @xcite .",
    "these papers contain a derivation of squeezing spectra in optical bistability accounting for the transverse gaussian structure of the laser beam .",
    "for particular sets of parameters , the spectra obtained in gaussian - wave calculations are compared by the authors with the predictions of the plane - wave model . in the good - cavity limit where the atomic damping occurs on a much shorter time than the intracavity field damping and where the atomic variables can be adiabatically eliminated",
    ", xiao et al @xcite conclude that the plane - wave calculations may be trusted in either the weak - field or dispersive limits . in a complete treatment without adiabatic elimination @xcite ,",
    "hope et al relate squeezing degradation due to transverse structure to the ratio of atomic and cavity damping times .    in the present paper ,",
    "we quantitatively delineate the regions in the parameter space where the predictions of the plane - wave and gaussian - wave calculations coincide , and therefore estimate the reliability of plane - wave model .",
    "we obtain criteria for reliability of plane - wave model which are quite different from those of references @xcite .",
    "we will use the linear input - output formalism generalized to incorporate the treatment of atomic fluctuations @xcite .",
    "this formalism is based upon a linearisation of the fluctuations around the working point of the bistable cavity , as the quantum stochastic methods @xcite , and it provides the same spectra as the latter when the same system is studied with the same simplifying assumptions @xcite .",
    "in contrast with the quantum stochastic methods , it provides an intuitive understanding of the noise processing occuring in the bistable cavity .",
    "the squeezing process through the parametric transformation of vacuum fluctuations going into the intracavity mode is described in terms of atomic susceptibility functions , while the squeezing degradation through the addition of fluctuations by the atoms is characterized by atomic noise functions .",
    "we will show in the following that the effect of gaussian profile upon noise processing appears quite naturally as a spatial averaging of these susceptibility and noise functions .",
    "this will allow us to obtain simple techniques for describing the influence of transverse structure .",
    "it is worth stressing that the property of averaging of the susceptibility and noise functions is not postulated a priori , but is rather a consequence of the simple assumptions made in the treatment of gaussian profile : we assume that the higher - order transverse modes are either far from resonance with the cavity , or of such a high order that they are not efficiently coupled to the fundamental mode .",
    "it is thus possible to project any field radiated by the atoms upon this mode , and to obtain the averaging property as a consequence of this projection .",
    "using this technique , we will first recover the well - known result @xcite that the mean fields evaluated with the plane - wave and gaussian - wave calculations coincide in the low - saturation limit where the population of the atomic excited state remains small .",
    "this implies that the bistability curves relating the input and intracavity intensities also coincide provided that these intensities are properly defined .",
    "we will then evaluate the atomic susceptibility and noise functions , and deduce that the conditions for coincidence of plane - wave and gaussian - wave calculations are much more restrictive in this case : the limit of a small population in the excited state is not sufficient for ensuring the coincidence for atomic noise functions . in particular , we will conclude that the noise functions evaluated in the plane - wave model are not reliable when large squeezing is predicted with parameters lying outside the kerr domain",
    ". we will finally give a quantitative estimate for the degradation of squeezing due to transverse structure .",
    "we consider a single ended ring cavity containing a nonlinear medium . a probe beam is entering the cavity through the coupling mirror , interacting with the medium and leaving the cavity through the same mirror .",
    "to study the influence of this device on the quantum fluctuations of the probe beam , we use a semi - classical input - output formalism , in which the field fluctuations are considered as classical stochastic variables , which are driven by the quantum fluctuations of the incoming fields at the laser frequency @xmath0 .",
    "the linear input - output relations give the quantum fluctuations of the output field as a function of those of the input field , in cases when they are small compared to the mean field - values , an assumption which is particularly well adapted for high photon numbers , i.e. laser beams in a resonator .",
    "the method is described in detail in @xcite .",
    "the intracavity field is defined as heisenberg operator in the frame rotating with respect to the laser frequency @xmath1 :    @xmath2    in order to account for the spatial beam structure , the components @xmath3 and @xmath4 are written as products of a gaussian mode function by a time - dependent mode amplitude ( @xmath5 stands for the three - dimensional position @xmath6 ) :    @xmath7    this definition is such that @xmath8 is the number of photons going through a beam section in the unit time .",
    "the normalized gaussian mode functions are written for a propagation along the @xmath9 direction :    @xmath10   \\label{gaussianmode}\\ ] ]    @xmath11 is the gaussian intensity normalized to unity on the beam axis , @xmath12 the effective beam section and @xmath13 the phase :    @xmath14 \\\\ s\\left ( x\\right ) & = & \\frac{\\pi w^2\\left ( x\\right ) } 2 \\\\ \\varphi \\left ( { \\bf r}\\right ) & = & -\\frac{2\\pi x}\\lambda + \\arctan \\left ( \\frac x{l_r}\\right ) -\\frac",

    "this structure is modified for the output field however , through the non linear interaction with the atoms on one hand , and through spontaneous emission of light in all possible directions by the atoms on the other hand . both effects couple the fundamental gaussian mode to all the other cavity modes .",
    "we will suppose here that the field radiated by the atoms into the other modes has an effect on intracavity fields much smaller than the field radiated into the fundamental gaussian mode .",
    "this may be due either to the fact that the fundamental gaussian mode is close to a cavity resonance while the other modes at the same frequency are far from any cavity resonance , or that they have such a high order that their coupling with the fundamental mode is negligeable .",
    "we will also consider that the detection setup is perfectly matched to the gaussian mode .    as a consequence",
    ", we can write the input and output fields @xmath20 and @xmath21 in the same manner as the intracavity field @xmath22 :    @xmath23    clearly the reflection - transmission equations for the fields on the coupling mirror will be the same for the field amplitudes as for the plane - wave fields in @xcite .",
    "in contrast , the effect of the atoms on these field amplitudes will be modified , due to the non - linearity of the interaction and to the gaussian variation of laser intensity . in order to evaluate the modification of the mode amplitudes due to the atomic medium",
    ", we will disregard the fields radiated by the atoms into the higher - order modes and obtain these modifications by projecting the radiated field onto the fundamental mode .",
    "this will be the key simplifying assumption in the forthcoming calculations concerning the mean fields as well as the field fluctuations .",
    "we will also use two simplifying hypothesis .",
    "first , we will consider that the transverse size @xmath24 of the probe beam is much smaller than the size of the atomic medium , so that the dependence of the atomic density versus the transverse variables @xmath25 and @xmath26 may be disregarded .",
    "this density @xmath27 will therefore be replaced by the on - axis atomic density @xmath28 :    @xmath29    note that the longitudinal dependence of the atomic density will have to be accounted for , since we consider that the length of the interaction zone is limited by the size of the atomic medium .",
    "second , we will assume that the rayleigh divergence length @xmath17 is much larger than this size , so that the @xmath30-dependence of the laser beam size @xmath24 can be ignored .",
    "however , we will not suppose that the atomic medium is centered on the cavity waist .",
    "the atomic medium is considered to be a homogeneously broadened system of two - level atoms with a resonance frequency @xmath31 , which is placed inside an optical cavity and driven by a coherent mean field of frequency @xmath32 close to a cavity mode @xmath33 .",
    "atom - laser detuning @xmath34 and cavity - laser detuning @xmath35 are respectively normalised by the atomic dipole decay rate @xmath36 and the cavity field decay rate @xmath37 :    @xmath38    it follows from the discussions of the previous section that the evolution of the intracavity gaussian mode amplitude during one cavity round trip time is described by the same differential equation as in the plane - wave model :    @xmath39    however , the modification @xmath40 of the intracavity gaussian mode amplitude due to one passage through the atomic medium has not the same expression as in the plane - wave model , as a consequence of the nonlinearity of atoms - field interaction . in the present section ,",
    "we evaluate its mean value and then deduce the bistability curve .",
    "the effect of an optically thin atomic layer of length @xmath41 may be described by a local modification @xmath42 of the field :    @xmath43    with @xcite :    @xmath44    @xmath45 is the atomic polarizability derived from the solution of the optical bloch equations @xcite and measured as a dimensionless number :    @xmath46    @xmath47 is the dimensionless linear polarizability of the atomic dipole :    @xmath48    @xmath49 is the dimensionless saturation parameter proportional to the local laser intensity :    @xmath50    @xmath51 is the dimensionless field parameter , that is precisely the rabi frequency normalized to the decay rate of the dipole :    @xmath52    where @xmath53 is the matrix element of the atomic dipole . these relations may also be written in terms of the saturation parameter @xmath54 and of the field parameter @xmath55 evaluated on the beam axis :    @xmath56    note that we may forget the @xmath9-dependence of the on - axis saturation parameter @xmath54 as a consequence of the assumption of a large rayleigh divergence length . the more general case of an arbitrary rayleigh divergence length might as well be studied @xcite . using the transverse monomode approximation discussed above",
    ", we project @xmath57 onto the gaussian mode , and write the following equation for the modification @xmath40 of the mode amplitude , summing up over the layers inside the atomic medium :    @xmath58    @xmath59 is the effective number of atoms in the probe beam , taking into account the effect of the saturation :    @xmath60    in order to evaluate @xmath59 , we expand it in powers of the saturation parameter :    @xmath61    @xmath62 , that we will denote simply @xmath63 , is the effective number of atoms in the probe beam , defined in the unsaturated regime :    @xmath64    the next term @xmath65 corresponds to the lowest - order saturation effect , that is precisely the kerr nonlinearity of the atomic medium .",
    "the other terms represent higher - order saturation effects . due to the gaussian shape of the function @xmath66",
    ", the function @xmath67 has the same expression as @xmath68 with a modified value of the beam size parameter , precisely with @xmath69 replaced by @xmath70 ; @xmath71 has therefore the same expression as @xmath63 with @xmath72 replaced by @xmath70 .",
    "we now use the assumption that the transverse size @xmath24 of the probe beam is much smaller than the size of the atomic medium .",
    "the unsaturated effective number @xmath63 has thus a simple expression in terms of the on - axis atomic density :    @xmath73    the higher - order integrals @xmath71 may therefore be written as :    @xmath74    the saturated effective number @xmath59 can then be related to the unsaturated effective number @xmath63 through an analytical expression :    @xmath75    @xmath76    this may be compared with the corresponding equation in the plane - wave model :    @xmath77    @xmath78    the two expressions nearly coincide in the low saturation regime , where only the linear index and the kerr term are appreciable , provided that an effective value @xmath79 of the saturation parameter is chosen in the plane - wave model such that :    @xmath80    in more physical terms , this condition means that , in the kerr limit , the plane - wave and gaussian results have to be compared for equal mean intensities , i.e. equal intensities after averaging over the gaussian profile . as soon as the saturation parameter is appreciable in contrast ( @xmath81 or @xmath82 ) , the two expressions differ .",
    "more strikingly , the expression ( [ fgauss ] ) which accounts for transverse mode profile does not tend towards the plane - wave expression ( [ fpw ] ) when the beam size parameter grows . in this regime also , valid conclusions about the effect of gaussian beam structure may be reached only after a criterium has been chosen to compare plane - wave and gaussian - beam spectra . in the following , we will always compare spectra with equation ( [ compgausspw ] ) obeyed .",
    "the modification @xmath40 of the intracavity gaussian mode amplitude due to one passage in the atomic medium may now be written :    @xmath83    we easily obtain the steady state solution of the differential equation ( [ equadiff ] ) for the intracavity amplitude @xmath84 :    @xmath85    which may be written as :    @xmath86\\ ] ]    @xmath55 denotes the dimensionless parameter for the on - axis intracavity field ( cf .",
    "equation([betam ] ) ) and @xmath87 a dimensionless parameter for the input field defined in an analogous manner :    @xmath88    @xmath89 is the cooperativity parameter , which is proportional to the effective number @xmath63 of atoms present in the probe beam :    @xmath90    @xmath91 is the intensity transmission of the coupling mirror :    @xmath92    we then derive the relation between the input intensity and the intracavity intensity :    @xmath93    or :    @xmath94   \\label{bistab}\\ ] ]    where we have replaced the field parameters by normalized intensities @xmath95 and @xmath96 defined from the intensities averaged over the gaussian profile :    @xmath97    @xmath98    @xmath99    equation ( [ bistab ] ) is identical with results of @xcite .",
    "it must be compared with the corresponding equation in the plane - wave model :    @xmath100 \\label{bistabpw}\\ ] ]    where the normalized intensities @xmath95 and @xmath96 are now defined from the position - independent intensities in the plane - wave model :    @xmath101    @xmath102    @xmath103    as long as the saturation parameter remains small ( @xmath104 ) , the bistability curves ( [ bistab ] ) and ( [ bistabpw ] ) are identical . note that this regime corresponds to a low - saturation limit where the mean population of the atomic excited state defined in the plane - wave model remains small :    @xmath105    in the following , we will focus the attention on this regime where the predictions of the plane - wave and gaussian - wave theories coincide for the mean fields . as already emphasized in the introduction ,",
    "this does not imply that the predictions will also coincide for the fluctuations .    before coming to the study of fluctuations ,",
    "we want to give conditions for obtaining a large squeezing .",
    "a first condition is that a bistability turning point is approached ( @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "this condition can be formulated in more quantitative terms by writing the slope of the bistability curve :    @xmath106    where :    @xmath107    the coefficient @xmath108 describes the damping of intracavity field due to atomic absorption , normalized to the damping due to the coupling mirror while the coefficient @xmath109 represents the normalized strength of the kerr coupling due to atomic non - linearity .",
    "the presence of a turning point ( @xmath110 ) requires that the kerr coupling is large enough so that third term in the right - hand side of equation ( [ slope ] ) is larger than the first one :    @xmath111    and then that the detuning @xmath35 of empty cavity is chosen such as to reach one of the two turning points :    @xmath112    the second condition for getting a large squeezing is that bistability is mainly in the dispersive regime , which means that the effect of atomic absorption on the field remains small :    @xmath113    if this condition is not satisfied , atoms efficiently couple vacuum fluctuations coming from the empty modes responsible for spontaneous emission into the intracavity field fluctuations , leading to a degradation of the expected squeezing .    in the low - saturation regime ( @xmath104 )",
    ", conditions ( [ condalpha],[condzeta ] ) imply a large atom - laser detuning ( @xmath114 ) and they may be rewritten :    @xmath115    @xmath116    in the following , we will consider that these conditions delineate the region where a large squeezing may be obtained .",
    "it is in particular worth noting that the intensity parameter @xmath95 lies in the domain @xmath117 .",
    "we are now going to study the quantum fluctuations of the field .",
    "we will closely follow the reference @xcite where quantum fluctuations were derived from a linear input - output theory with a plane - wave model . as in the previous analysis of mean values ,",
    "the reflection - transmission equations for the field fluctuations on the coupling mirror are the same as in the plane - wave model .",
    "in contrast , the effect of the atoms on these fluctuations is modified , due to the non - linearity of the interaction and to the gaussian profile of laser intensity .    in order to discuss the transformation of field fluctuations",
    ", we now introduce a new notation for the positive - frequency and negative - frequency components @xmath118 and @xmath119 of the field operator ( see equation ( [ fieldoperators ] ) ) which are coupled by the nonlinear interaction .",
    "they will be considered as the components @xmath120 of a two - fold column matrix @xmath121 :    @xmath122\\ ] ]    we will also denote @xmath123 the components of the adjoint line matrix @xmath124 .    the field components are written in terms of mode amplitudes and gaussian mode functions :    @xmath125    the two components @xmath126 coincide with the functions @xmath127 and @xmath128 defined previously in equation ( [ e]-[gaussianmode ] ) :    @xmath129    the same notation will be used also for the positive - frequency and negative - frequency mode amplitudes :    @xmath130\\ ] ]    as well as for the components of the atomic dipole measured as a dimensionless number :    @xmath131\\ ] ]    ( @xmath132 and @xmath133 have the same definition as in @xcite ; they will be denoted @xmath134 in the following ) .    as for the mean values ,",

    "we now evaluate these two terms .",
    "the first term may be written in terms of linear susceptibility functions @xmath143 :    @xmath144    the susceptibility function @xmath145 is deduced from commutators of the atomic dipoles evaluated at different times :    @xmath146 \\right\\rangle _ { { \\bf r } }   \\label{khit}\\ ] ]    @xmath147 is the heaviside function .",
