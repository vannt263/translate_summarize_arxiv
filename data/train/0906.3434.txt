    "it is the energy needed to add a lepton of a certain flavour to a thermalised state at fixed volume and entropy .",
    "the cheapest way to add a lepton of some flavour is to add a corresponding neutrino , see ( [ mulfhigh ] ) and ( [ mulflow ] ) . while for the case of three light quarks and two charged leptons at temperatures just above the qcd transition , @xmath160 from ( [ muesimp ] ) and ( [ ltauana ] ) , including the charm and tau at higher temperatures leads to ( [ munu1gev ] ) @xmath161 for all three lepton flavours .",
    "again , taking the finite masses of quarks and charged leptons into account shows that @xmath162 .",
    "after the annihilation of the tau and muon , the flavour asymmetries survives in the neutrino sector . only the asymmetry in the electron flavour can be divided into electron and electron neutrino asymmetry .",

    "the flavours oscillate and the three neutrino sectors become linked via @xmath163 and lepton flavour is no longer a conserved quantum number .",

    "our findings question some of the established results about the dynamics of the cosmic qcd transition . it was concluded from lattice qcd simulations , that the cosmic qcd transition is a crossover @xcite .",
    "these simulations included three dynamical quarks and implicitly assumed @xmath164 .",
    "however , @xmath13 and @xmath150 vanish only in the case of @xmath165 .",
    "there also exist first lattice studies for tiny baryon and charge chemical potentials @xcite .",
    "it seems to us , that tiny , non - vanishing @xmath78 and @xmath0 should not change this story . while @xmath78 is certainly tiny in nature , this is not necessarily true for @xmath0 . a large lepton asymmetry results in a large @xmath166 and @xmath167 at @xmath168 .",
    "thus , we have to revisit the question of the order of the cosmic qcd transition .    at any thermodynamic transition",
    ", the chemical potentials of conserved quantum numbers must evolve continuously .",
    "for the scenario @xmath169 we found for the baryochemical potential a crossing of the quark and hadron phase trajectories at @xmath170 mev ( figure [ fig : figure10 ] ) .",
    "this seems to be consistent with the transition temperature found by lattice simulations .",
    "increasing the lepton asymmetry seems to lead to a decrease of the critical temperature .",
    "the opposite effect occurs at the electroweak transition , shown in @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the trajectory of the baryochemical potential , the trajectories for the charge and leptochemical potentials do not cross at @xmath171 mev . taken seriously",
    ", this would require a jump from the quark- to the hadron trajectory , which would lead to a non - thermal transition .",
    "however , as we have neglected interactions in our analysis , the trajectories are modified close to @xmath172 and our findings just tell us , that the situation of @xmath173 and @xmath174 has to be studied carefully , i.e. by means of lattice simulations .",
    "the sign of a possible lepton asymmetry is important for the dynamics of the transition , see figures [ fig : figure9 ] , [ fig : figure11 ] and [ fig : figure13 ] .",
    "a negative lepton asymmetry leads to negative charge- and leptochemical potential and a positive @xmath13 .",
    "if the asymmetry is positive , the signs of the chemical potentials change . for large @xmath148 or for positive @xmath0",
    ", the trajectories of the quark and hadron phases do not cross in the @xmath3 plane ( at least not at @xmath175 mev ) .",
    "lepton asymmetries of the order of @xmath176 might put the early universe in the vicinity of the critical end point @xmath177 , see figure 1 .",
    "to go into more details is beyond the scope of this work , but it is clear , that the phase diagram for the cosmic phase transition lives in 5 dimensions for a charge neutral universe ( 3 lepton flavour asymmetries , the baryon asymmetry and temperature ) . so far",
    "just a two dimensional slice of it has been studied in greater detail .",
    "we know very little about the actual lepton asymmetry of the universe .",
    "a large lepton asymmetry @xmath136 is compatible with constraints form primordial nucleosynthesis and the cmb , if @xmath178 @xcite .",
    "we have shown that such an asymmetry may significantly affect the dynamics of the cosmic qcd transition .",
    "the cosmic trajectory in the @xmath13-@xmath20 plane depends on the lepton flavour asymmetries @xmath48 , besides the baryon asymmetry @xmath78 .",
    "we explicitly discussed the dependence of the baryochemical potential on the lepton asymmetry , @xmath179 . while in systems , where only strong interactions matter ( relativistic heavy - ion collisions , lattice qcd ) a large @xmath13 implies large baryon densities ,",
    "the early universe can support large @xmath13 via a large lepton asymmetry .",
    "depending on the , yet unknown , structure of the qcd phase diagram and especially on the position of a hypothetical critical end point , a large lepton asymmetry might result in a first - order qcd transition in the early universe .",
    "this seems possible for @xmath180 .",
    "many formerly suggested cosmological consequences of a first - order qcd transition would be possible ( formation of relics , effects on nucleosynthesis , generation of magnetic fields , generation of gravitational waves , etc .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "the conclusions from lattice qcd simulations at @xmath181 and @xmath182 have been used to conclude that the cosmic qcd transition is a crossover @xcite .",
    "we have shown , that the cosmic trajectory has @xmath173 . in the case of efficient sphaleron processes",
    ", @xmath150 is tiny . in the case of a large lepton asymmetry",
    ", @xmath150 can be large and it is unclear if the conclusion that the cosmic qcd transition is a crossover remains true . for @xmath183 , the charge chemical potential differs between the quark and the hadron phase by more than 100 mev at temperatures around the qcd scale",
    "( see figure [ fig : figure12]).but note , that we neglected all interactions in our analysis .    a detailed understanding of the consequences of @xmath136 on",
    "the qcd transition could allow us to rule out or find evidences for leptogenesis scenarios that lead to a large lepton asymmetry .",
    "this is of interest to all scenarios in which the lepton number is changed after the sphaleron processes stop to be efficient ( late leptogenesis e.g. @xcite ) .    in this work we assumed that all globally conserved quantum numbers are also conserved locally and we have put the focus on the case of equal lepton flavour asymmetries . dropping",
    "the latter , obviously leads to a somewhat richer phenomenology , which is beyond the scope of this work . while the local conservation of electric charge and baryon number are probably excellent approximations , the local conservation of lepton number is not correct , if distance scales below the neutrino mean free path are considered .",
    "consequently , as soon as inhomogeneities become important ( and they will in the case of a first - order phase transition , as cold spots are more likely to nucleate bubbles of the new phase @xcite ) it would be more realistic to describe an inhomogeneous universe with regions of different @xmath48 .",
    "these different regions would be equilibrated via neutrinos , so that possible bubbles of different @xmath48 at the qcd phase transition would have a minimal radius , given by the mean free path , @xmath184 m @xcite .",
    "this has to be compared to the size of the universe at this time , @xmath185 km @xcite .",
    "although giving rise to small effects only , precise measurements of the abundance of primordial light elements might be sensitive to inhomogeneities produced during the qcd transition , as they might lead to inhomogeneous nucleosynthesis .",
    "some consequences of a large lepton asymmetry on the physics of the early universe in the qcd epoch have been overlooked so far .",
    "this calls for a reinvestigation of many of the suggested effects of the cosmic qcd transition and might allow us to improve the limits on the universal lepton flavour asymmetries ( before neutrino oscillations start ) .",
