    "gluonic mesons are in the broadest sense a @xmath0 system in which the gluonic field contributes directly to the quantum numbers of the meson . in terms of the simple quark model ,",
    "all quantum numbers of mesons are determined by the @xmath0 alone .",
    "however , quantum chromo dynamics , ( qcd ) indicates that this picture is not complete .",
    "lattice qcd calculations predict that both purely gluonic states , ( glueballs ) , and states with the gluonic field carrying angular momentum , ( hybrids ) should exist . beyond the lattice ,",
    "most models which explain observed phenomena also predict such gluonic mesons to be present .",
    "a number of the hybrid states are predicted to have @xmath1 quantum numbers which are not accessible to simple @xmath0 systems , the so - called _ _ exotic__s .",
    "this article will review the experimental situation for gluonic excitations . of particular interest",
    "are states with exotic quantum numbers where two candidates exist .",
    "hybrids with normal quantum numbers are more difficult to discern , as they are likely to mix with nearby normal mesons .",
    "it is only through detailed studies of decay and production that they can be identified .",
    "finally , evidence exists for a @xmath2 glueball that is strongly mixed with the nearby scalar mesons .",
    "within the picture of the quark model , mesons are @xmath0 pairs which have been combined with spin , * s * , orbital angular momentum , * l * , and a possible radial excitation . * s * can be either @xmath3 or @xmath4 , while * l * can be any non - negative integer .",
    "the quantum numbers of the allowed states which are conserved by the strong interaction can be built up from these as given as follows : @xmath5 the light - quark mesons are built up from @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 and their antiquarks .",
    "this yields nine possible @xmath0 combinations for each set of quantum numbers , ( nonets ) . for the allowed values of * l * and * s * , table  [ tab : mesons ] lists the nonets of mesons that can be formed .",
    "the first listed is the @xmath9 member , the second and third are the two @xmath10 members , and the last is the @xmath11 member which contains non - zero strangeness .",
    "the mass in the last column is the approximate experimental mass of the lightest @xmath10 member of the nonet . if one looks at the @xmath1 quantum numbers listed in table  [ tab : mesons ] , the following values are missing : @xmath12 .",
    "anything identified with one of these quantum numbers falls outside of the normal @xmath0 picture of the quark model .",
    ".[tab : mesons ] the quantum numbers of the nonets built up from the allowed * l * and * s * quantum numbers .",
    "the quoted mass is that for the lightest isoscalar state in the nonet . [ cols=\"^,^,^,<,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     while there appears to be solid evidence for a scalar glueball mixed into the scalar nonet , the evidence for the @xmath13 and @xmath14 glueballs is significantly weaker .",
    "the tensor state is supposed to be next lightest with a predicted mass of about @xmath15 .",
    "a possible candidate , the @xmath16 has been observed in central production in a similar fashion to the scalar glueball candidates  @xcite , although there is little other information about this state .",
    "a second state , the @xmath17 was originally reported in @xmath18 radiative decays .",
    "this very narrow object ( @xmath19 ) was originally seen by one experiment  @xcite , but not confirmed by several others .",
    "no spin parity analysis is available , but @xmath13 is favored .",
    "it was later seen in the bes experiment  @xcite with approximately equal strength in @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 annihilations .",
    "later careful searches in @xmath22 annihilation  @xcite showed no evidence of this state .",
    "these data lead to a lower limit of @xmath23 of @xmath24  @xcite .",
    "if this state really exists , it has one of the largest radiative branching fractions in @xmath18 decays .",
    "the existence of this state is still an open question .",
    "evidence for the @xmath14 glueball is even weaker , and full exploration of the glueball sector awaits new data .",
    "clear experimental evidence exists for both mesons with non-@xmath0 quantum numbers and for a scalar glueball which is mixed with the nearby scalar mesons .",
    "unfortunately , the exact nature of the exotic states remain unclear .",
    "their observed mass and decay modes do not completely agree with theoretical expectations , which may well indicate that there are problems with the theory . in order to resolve these issues",
    ", it will be necessary to observe and measure both the partners of the existing states as well as states with other exotic quantum numbers .",
    "this will be studied in the light quark sector with the gluex experiment at jefferson lab  @xcite and in the charmonium sector with the panda experiment at gsi  @xcite .",
    "while there is a good explanation of the scalar glueball , a full understanding of the glueballs will require the discovery and study of at least one additional state .",
    "there is a very good chance that this will be accomplished with the cleo - c experiment in the near future  @xcite .",
