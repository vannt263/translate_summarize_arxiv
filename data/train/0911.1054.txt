    "such systems are able to achieve downlink data rates that scale linearly with the number of antennas at the transmitter , as is possible with simpler point - to - point mimo communications , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "an optimal sum rate achieving transmission method for the multiuser mimo downlink is dirty - paper coding ( dpc ) @xcite .",
    "as this scheme requires computationally infeasible random coding and binning operations , it remains a theoretical construction .",
    "linear precoders such as channel inversion @xcite and zero - forcing beamforming @xcite can be used for lower complexity implementations .",
    "a promising practical transmission method with better performance than linear precoders is vector perturbation ( vp ) precoding @xcite . with vp precoding",
    ", the data vector to be transmitted is constrained to lie within a 2@xmath0-dimensional hypercube of side length one , and is modified by the addition of a _ perturbation vector _ consisting of complex integers , before being passed through a channel inverting linear precoder .",
    "the addition of the perturbation vector significantly reduces the required transmit power , and can be removed completely by independent modulo operations at each receiver .",
    "the choice of the perturbation vector is an instance of the well - studied np - hard problem of finding the closest lattice point , whereas here the lattice is determined by the channel . a common method to perform",
    "the search is the sphere - decoding algorithm @xcite , as well as suboptimal lattice reduction methods .    due to the perturbation process",
    ", the sum rate performance of vector perturbation systems is more difficult to analyze than linear precoding systems , and exact expressions for performance measures remain an outstanding problem .",
    "this is primarily due to the fact that the performance is a function of the average power of the precoded signal , @xmath1 , as this determines the effective noise power at the output of each user s demodulator .",
    "it is hard to calculate @xmath1 since it is determined by a closest lattice point search .",
    "closed - form representations of @xmath1 are not available , however some useful closed - form bounds have been derived in @xcite . in @xcite",
    "an expression that gave insight into the choice of perturbation vector is derived , but still required numerical simulation to evaluate @xmath1 . a statistical physics based approach was used in @xcite to derive @xmath1 in the limit as @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the number of antennas at the bs .",
    "the approach in @xcite requires a number of assumptions , and also the results are in terms of a fixed - point integral equation , which requires numerical evaluation .",

    "the sum rate of vector perturbation systems has not been analyzed .",
    "other practical issues also remain open , such as how to select a subset of users from a set of available users , or how to allocate different rates to users in order to maximize the sum rate . various user selection and rate allocation algorithms",
    "have been suggested for linear precoders such as zero - forcing @xcite and zero - forcing dirty paper coding @xcite but not for vector perturbation systems .",
    "these three problems are the subject of this work .    in this paper",
    ", we provide an expression for the sum rate of vector perturbation systems based on the assumptions that @xmath1 is known exactly and the data to be transmitted is uniformly distributed .",
    "then we show that in high - snr regime , the effect of modulo operation diminishes hence it has no bearing on the sum rate performance of the system . using this high - snr property",
    ", we derive a lower bound to this sum rate , as well as an asymptotic closed - form high - snr upper bound .",
    "simulation results suggest that this upper bound is tight for transmit snrs greater than 10 db .",
    "we then propose a modification to vector perturbation precoding so that different rates may be allocated to different users .",
    "we examine the problem of optimizing the rate allocation and propose a sub - optimal rate allocation algorithm , which uses the simple @xmath1 approximation derived in @xcite .",
    "we see that the rate allocation improves the performance in the low - snr regime .",
    "however , for the vector perturbation precoding system the sum rate may be well approximated by an on - off function .",
    "we numerically determine that this on - off function has mutual information of at most 0.2992 bits less than the actual mutual information . using this knowledge , we propose that the rate allocation problem can be reduced to one of user selection .    therefore , we next turn our attention to the practical user selection algorithms .",
    "we propose a low - complexity algorithm for user selection for the vector perturbation precoding systems .",
    "specifically , we propose a greedy algorithm which chooses users successively in order to maximize the new sum rate upper bound at high snr .",
    "we show that the selection criterion becomes equivalent to the selection criterion used in algorithms proposed in @xcite , but differs in the user shedding criterion .",
    "we provide simulation results that show that the sum rate of our system is very close to that achieved by an exhaustive search through all possible combinations of users , and our proposed algorithm outperforms other low - complexity algorithms @xcite .",
    "simulation results also show that the user selection outperforms our proposed rate allocation algorithm , and that the rate allocation algorithm provides negligible improvement if used in conjunction with user selection .",

    "first , recall from our discussion of ( [ eq : rvp ] ) in theorem [ th : vpcapexact ] that @xmath85 as @xmath51 .",
    "then , we substitute the lower bound on @xmath50 from @xcite , namely @xmath86 into ( [ eq : rvp ] ) . by noting that @xmath34 and therefore @xmath87 , completes the result .",
    "in this section we will extend the system model by taking into account the rate allocation in an attempt to further optimize the sum rates . using a rate allocation matrix @xmath88",

    "we note that the choice of the optimal @xmath88 is difficult as the rate is a function of @xmath50 , which is an np - hard problem to evaluate . in order to find a simple sub - optimal approach to the rate allocation problem",

    "while for low snr , it can be seen as a zero mutual information channel . also note that expressions of the logarithmic form , as in ( [ eq : iawgn ] ) , are obtained when linear precoding schemes are used with gaussian inputs , as the received signal is also gaussian .",
    "we see that @xmath114 is much tighter for the modulo vector perturbation channel than @xmath115 .",
    "the maximum difference with the piece - wise approximation is at most @xmath116 bit for the awgn channel and only @xmath117 bit for the modulo vector perturbation channel .",
    "note also that the range of @xmath109 where the difference is non - negligible is much less for the piecewise approximation , which also explains why such an approximation is of less interest for linear precoding systems .",
    "we propose to take advantage of the tightness of the piecewise lower bound to simplify the method of rate allocation .",
    "specifically , we propose to maximize the rate allocation function @xmath118 from the above we know that the maximum difference between the actual sum rate and this piece - wise approximation is at most @xmath119 bits . to remove the difficulty in optimization imposed by the dependence on the @xmath1 function we again use the lower bound in @xmath120 , assuming now that the precoding matrix has @xmath121 as @xmath122 and @xmath123 . by inserting ( [ eq : eselb2 ] ) into ( [ eq : approxrvp ] ) we get @xmath124 the value of using ( [ eq : eselb2 ] ) as an approximation has been examined in @xcite .",
    "we now examine how the rate allocation proceeds from here . to simplify ( [ eq : rvpub ] ) we set @xmath125 and @xmath126 .",
    "substituting this into ( [ eq : rvpub ] ) we obtain @xmath127 where @xmath128 .",
    "now , if we place the restriction that @xmath0 users must be used then the sum rate is at most @xmath129 note that if @xmath130 is chosen so that @xmath131 and @xmath132 are equal , that would imply that either all or none of the users are in the non - zero rate regime .",
    "this choice of @xmath130 corresponds to standard vector perturbation as outlined in section [ sec : systemmodel ] .",
    "we see that by making this piece - wise linear approximation to the mutual information , and the use of the @xmath1 approximation , the best sum - rate obtainable due to rate allocation is approached by simply selecting users so as to maximize @xmath133 . to summarize , as a consequence of the modulo vector perturbation channel for a particular user being effectively a high snr awgn channel in the high snr regime , and a zero mutual information channel in the low snr regime ,",
    "the difference between an on - off assumption and the modulo vector perturbation channel ( 0.2992 bit ) is much less than the difference between the on - off assumption and the awgn assumption ( @xmath134 bit , and for a much greater range of gains ) .",
    "consequently , we would expect that , to approach the maximum sum rate it is sufficient to select the users that will maximize the high - snr sum rate upper bound given by corollary [ cor : cvp - ubhighex ] .",
    "moreover , it is sufficient to use the standard channel inverse precoding matrix to achieve this rate .",
    "we now turn to the user selection , both as a rate allocation algorithm , and for use in scenarios when the number of potential users @xmath12 is greater than the number of transmit antennas .",
    "we propose an algorithm which we refer to as greedy rate maximization ( grm ) for user scheduling for vector perturbation precoding .",
    "grm is a low - complexity scheme , which can be considered a _",
    "greedy _ algorithm to maximize the capacity upper bound of corollary [ cor : cvp - ubhighex ] .",
    "it turns out that the criteria for selecting users is similar to that used for zero - forcing dirty - paper coding in @xcite , and modified for zero - forcing beamforming in @xcite .",
    "we discuss the differences in the algorithms , in terms of shedding users and terminating the user selection process .",
    "it is to be noted that our proposed greedy algorithm focus on maximizing the sum rate but in doing so fairness among the users is not guaranteed .",
    "the user selection algorithm we propose is as follows .",
    "denote @xmath135 as the set of users that have been selected , the cardinality of @xmath135 is @xmath136 , and @xmath137 as the set of users who have not been selected or removed from consideration . for the selected users",
    "@xmath135 we denote @xmath138 as the channel matrix constructed from these users , and @xmath139 .",
    "the algorithm we propose here maximize the high - snr upper bound of corollary [ cor : cvp - ubhighex ] by maximizing @xmath140 . from ( [ eq : eshlb ] ) we note that maximizing @xmath140 is actually equivalent of minimizing @xmath50 .",
    "the algorithm is as follows :    1 .",
    "initialize the set of selected vectors @xmath141 , and set @xmath137 to the set of all users .",
    "2 .   calculate @xmath142 for all users @xmath143 .",
    "determine @xmath144 , the user that maximizes @xmath142 .",
    "3 .   remove from @xmath137 all those users such that @xmath56 would be reduced if they were to be added to @xmath135 . precisely , remove user @xmath145 if @xmath146 and @xmath147 .",
    "( we will provide a low complexity way for calculating the left hand side of this equation . )",
    "if @xmath137 is non - empty , add user @xmath144 to @xmath135 and remove it from @xmath137 , and return to step 2 .",
    "if @xmath137 is empty or @xmath148 , terminate the algorithm .",
    "we now compare the operations performed by grm with greedy - zf @xcite and semi - orthogonal user selection ( sus ) @xcite .",
    "first , we show that the metric @xmath142 in step 2 above that determines the users to be picked , is equivalent to that used in greedy - zf and sus .",
    "thus , we show that greedy - zf and sus algorithms can essentially be viewed as greedy determinant maximization algorithms . therefore , the difference between the algorithms boils down to how the users are removed from @xmath137 to improve the complexity .    to show the equivalence of the choice of the next user to add to @xmath135",
    ", we note that if we append a user @xmath145 with channel vector @xmath149 to a set @xmath135 , and employ the block matrix determinant formula to @xmath150 we obtain @xmath151 where @xmath152 is a projection matrix for the subspace spanned by @xmath138 , which we denote @xmath153 .",
    "the matrix @xmath154 is the projection matrix for the nullspace of @xmath155 .",
    "it follows from ( [ eq : detupdate ] ) that the choice of user in @xmath137 that maximizes the determinant given @xmath138 , is the user with channel vector @xmath149 that has the largest component in the nullspace of @xmath155 .",
    "it is worthwhile to note that the condition given above is same as that specified by the greedy - zf and sus algorithms .",
    "however , the motivations behind these other algorithms are slightly different , as the users are chosen to maximize the individual user gains in order to maximize the sum rate . in grm",
    "we attempt to maximize the sum rate by minimizing the transmit power scaling @xmath1 via maximizing @xmath156 .",
    "however , by noting this similarity , we are able to take advantage of the lower complexity method in @xcite to calculate the component of channel vectors orthogonal to @xmath155 . that is , instead of calculating @xmath157 , we calculate @xmath158 where @xmath159 is the value of @xmath160 calculated in the previous iterations of the algorithm .",
    "note that this makes @xmath159 an orthogonal set of vectors , and that each @xmath160 is also orthogonal to these vectors .",
    "therefore , we propose that step 2 of the algorithm is performed by choosing the user with the greatest value of @xmath161 , thus avoiding the calculation of determinants .",
    "we see that @xmath161 can also be used for user shedding in step 3 of the algorithm , as @xmath162 .",
    "note here that as @xmath0 increases , @xmath163 is non - increasing , and the right - hand side of ( [ eq : step3 ] ) is increasing .",
    "it follows that we can remove user @xmath145 from @xmath137 , as it will always decrease the rate upper bound . as we will see in the next section",
    ", this user shedding reduces the complexity of the algorithm , and results in a better sum rate performance than other algorithms .",
    "note that greedy - zf does not perform user shedding , while the sus algorithm performs user shedding based on only keeping those vectors that are semi - orthogonal to the most recent vector added to @xmath135 .",
    "specifically , all users satisfying @xmath164 are removed , where @xmath165 is a parameter in the interval @xmath166 $ ] .",
    "note that the optimal value of @xmath165 for a specific antenna / user configuration and channel distribution / snr can only be determined via simulation .",
    "this in contrast to our proposed grm scheme , which only requires knowledge of @xmath40 , rather than the full channel statistics .",
    "as demonstrated in the next section , the run - time complexity of grm , greedy - zf and sus is similar .",
    "note that sus requires further calculation of ( [ eq : cos2 ] ) as part of its user shedding calculations , thus making it more complex for the same size @xmath137 than our proposed grm algorithm .",
    "in this section we present simulation results for sum rate performance of vp with and without user scheduling . in figs .",
    "[ fig : fig2 ] and [ fig : fig3 ] , we consider a system with @xmath167 = @xmath12 = @xmath0 = 4 and 8 respectively .",

    "the plot shows that vp - exact is outperforming zf - wf , although at low snr zf - wf is better due to waterfilling .",

    "we see that vp - grm performs better than vp - sus in the low to medium snr region .",
    "clearly , in this region , the grm algorithm s sum rate based criterion is particularly effective at shedding users , compared with the sus algorithm s orthogonality criterion . at high snr ,",
    "the two curves meet . in this region ,",
    "the grm algorithm s sum - rate based criterion is dominated by the factor @xmath172 and thus @xmath173 users will always be chosen .",

    "we show the sum rate results for snr= 0 , 5 and 10 db .",
    "we again used optimal values of @xmath165 for vp - sus .",
    "we see that vp - grm is performing better than vp - sus for the whole range of @xmath12 for snr = 0 and 5 db .",
    "but for snr = 10 db , vp - sus matches the vp - grm performance for higher values of @xmath12 as both algorithms , as was discussed above , select users which are effectively in the high snr regime hence @xmath0 is close to @xmath10 .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig6 ] , we examine the rate allocation scheme proposed in appendix ii and the grm based user selection algorithm .",
    "we plot the performance of the algorithms when used independently , and also for the case when the rate allocation is performed after the users are selected .",
    "we examine the scenario where @xmath10 = @xmath12 = 8 .",
    "we see that both algorithms improve the sum rate when used independently , especially for lower snrs .",
    "moreover , the sum rate is barely increased when the rate allocation algorithm is applied after the user selection .",
    "this is expected from the analysis of section [ sec : powerallocation ] , where we see that in order to maximize the sum rate it is more important to select the users , rather than allocate ( non - zero ) rates to the users directly .",
    "in addition , after the user selection , all the selected users will be operating in the high - snr regime , and therefore there is little to be gained by performing an additional rate allocation .",
    "in this work , we examined the sum rate of vector perturbation schemes , based on the assumptions of a uniformly distributed channel input and the tightness of the spherical voronoi region approximation to @xmath1 .",
    "we derived expressions in terms of the determinant of the channel hermitian , and simulation results demonstrate the tightness of the bounds .",
    "we then proceeded to the problem of individual rate allocation , as is commonly applied to other multiuser schemes to optimise the sum rate .",
    "however , we discovered that the modulo operation at the demodulator for vector perturbation precoding implies that the channel may as well be turned off when the gain is too low .",
    "therefore only channels with high gains should be used where the energy can be applied more efficiently . moreover",
    ", the following choice of rate allocation corresponds to standard vector perturbation precoding employing the channel inversion precoding matrix .",
    "nevertheless , there may be a value in reconsidering the rate allocation problem with respect to scheduling fairness , different channel models , or variations of vector perturbation precoding .",
    "it follows that user selection is the most important step to maximize the sum rate , regardless of whether the number of users exceeds that of the number of transmit antennas .",
    "based on our high - snr upper bound , we saw that this corresponds to determinant maximization .",
    "we proposed a greedy algorithm for this , which is essentially the same algorithm as semi - orthogonal user selection proposed in the context of zfbf @xcite , but with more appropriate user shedding criteria , resulting in a lower - complexity and better performing algorithm which does not require optimization over the channel statistics .",
    "naturally , the design and analysis of limited feedback techniques @xcite for the efficient collection of csi at the transmitter with respect to the user selection process is required . as said before ,",
    "scheduling fairness among users is another important issue to consider which become all more important when all users are assumed to have same received snr ( heterogeneous system model )",
    ". a full treatment of this issue will be an important extension of this work in future .",
    "also in this work , we have only considered single antenna users hence the impact of having multiple antenna receivers on the sum rate performance and scheduling complexity for vector perturbation precoding system remains an outstanding future work .",
    "first , note that for each @xmath176 we have @xmath177 since @xmath53 is restricted to @xmath178 , it follows that @xmath179 is maximized if @xmath53 is uniformly distributed .",
    "this is achieved if @xmath54 is uniformly distributed .",
    "@xmath180    in order to calculate @xmath181 , we first define few terms here .",
    "as we discussed above , @xmath54 is uniformly distributed where we use @xmath182 to denote the of @xmath54 .",
    "now for all @xmath18 , we denote @xmath183 where the of @xmath184 is given by @xmath185 where @xmath186 is the of @xmath53 conditioned on @xmath54 .    noting that @xmath187 is same for all @xmath18 , and that @xmath184 is i.i.d . for the real and imaginary dimensions , we can define @xmath188 .",
    "now , @xmath189 has a modulo - gaussian distribution given by @xmath190 and @xmath191    now , to calculate @xmath181 we have @xmath192 where the second equality follows from the fact that the inner integral is the same for all @xmath193 and that @xmath181 is uniform . using the definitions above , we write @xmath194    now ,",
    "using @xmath195 , and inserting ( [ eq : fxi ] ) into ( [ eq : hnu ] ) we get @xmath196    where we recall the definition of @xmath60 in ( [ eq : omegadef ] )",
    ". therefore @xmath197    which gives the theorem .",
    "as we discussed in section [ sec : powerallocation ] , exactly solving the optimization problem of finding rate allocation matrix @xmath88 is difficult as it involve finding @xmath50 which is np - hard .",
    "hence , we resort to a simpler sub - optimal iterative algorithm for the choice of @xmath88 .",
    "1 .   initialize with lower bound on @xmath50 calculated by using ( [ eq : eshlb ] ) with @xmath200 2 .",
    "update @xmath88 by using standard waterfilling @xmath201 where the water level @xmath202 is chosen as @xmath203 3 .",
    "update @xmath50 with new precoding matrix @xmath55 .",
    "4 .   repeat 2 ) and 3 ) until @xmath88 converges .",
    "we then use this @xmath88 to calculate the sum - rate using corollary [ cor:3 ] .",
    "the algorithm is suboptimal because the approximation to @xmath1 is used , the received signal is assumed to be subject to gaussian rather than modulo - gaussian noise , and the algorithm converges to a local minimum which may not be the global minimum .",
