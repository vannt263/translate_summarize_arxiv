    "cooperative behavior , as exemplified by multicellular life , seems to have evolved at least 25 times independently - once for plants , once or twice for animals , once for brown algae , and possibly several times for fungi , slime molds , and red algae @xcite . on shorter time - scales , the social composition of eukaryotes such as _ s. cerevisiae _ , and biofilm forming bacteria such as _ p. aeruginosa _ can dramatically change in a brief period @xcite . in a related context ,",
    "tumor formation is a rare example of the transition , taking place in the reverse direction , from a multicellular to an essentially unicellular lifestyle .",
    "interestingly , cancer cells end up cooperating by collectively secreting angiogenic factors , and it seems possible , at least in principle , that there may even be cheaters ( i.e. those who do not secrete the growth factors ) among this collection of cooperating cheaters @xcite .",
    "evolutionary game theory provides excellent insight into how altruistic and cooperative behavior can emerge to maximize the fitness of the group despite the apparent fitness advantage of cheating individuals @xcite . in the context of evolution of cooperation",
    ", these models typically investigate the outcome of repeated runs of the prisoner s dilemma between pairs of agents that have two strategies , cheating and cooperating .",
    "variants of the model include structured interactions , coupled populations , coevolution , stored reputation , punishment , and preferential or random partner choosing @xcite .    however , real life is more complicated in a number of ways .",
    "first , many actual games are massively multiplayer @xcite .",
    "the fitness of an organism may depend on its simultaneous relationship with multiple players .",
    "second , biology allows for a much larger variety of internal states beyond cooperating or defecting .",
    "for example , the genetic makeup of an organism may be suitable for cooperation with only an exclusive few , while some organisms may be incapable of defecting or cooperating all together .",
    "third , real social evolution leads to highly organized dependence structures beyond the homogeneous mixtures or aggregates of cooperator - defector states that we often see in the majority of evolutionary game models . from biochemical to societal scales",
    ", life organizes itself in highly complex arrangements of cliques , communities , cycles and hierarchies .    without compromising the simplicity and tractability offered by traditional evolutionary game theory ,",
    "here we propose an evolutionary model in which the fitness of an agent is determined , not by the outcome of a two - player two - state game , but instead a multi - player multi - state one .",
    "thus , our focus is not the cooperator / defector ratio in the population , but rather the large - scale structure of all exchanges ; i.e. the _ interdependence _ between agents or groups of agents within a genetically heterogeneous population .",
    "we ask how independent agents become interdependent through the simple laws of evolution , whether positive selection is a necessary or a sufficient condition for the formation of interdependence , what kinds of interdependent structures are stable / unstable , and how these structures and processes depend on evolutionary parameters .",
    "is a monotonically increasing function of edge influx @xmath0 , where @xmath1 and @xmath2 are the number of in and out edges for node @xmath3 .",
    "( 2 ) reproduction preserves all in - out relationships with @xmath4 fittest nodes replacing the least fittest nodes , and ( 3 ) a small number of edges are randomly added / removed every generation , with probability @xmath5 . ]    accordingly , the present model offers a clear framework for classifying and categorizing different regimes of interdependence , as well as allowing for careful control of evolutionary parameters that may be influencing recent non - intuitive empirical outcomes @xcite .",
    "we determine which kinds of external perturbations promote anti - sociality ( e.g. in order to eradicate biofilms ) and which other kinds can inhibit anti - sociality ( e.g. as to suppress or reverse tumor growth ) by simulating the introduction of selfish / altruistic strains into a population or the administration of anti - sociality / sociality promoting drugs .",
    "we evaluate the success rate of these evolutionary interventions as a function of the original population structure , drug dose , fraction of drug - resistant agents , and reproduction speed of the target species .",
    "our multi - state multi - player game can be best visualized as a network of @xmath6 agents , connected by directional edges .",
    "an edge from @xmath7 to @xmath8 indicates that @xmath7 contributes to the fitness of @xmath8 at the cost of its own . unlike the typical evolutionary game theoretic models where the state of a player @xmath3 is binary ( cooperator / cheater ) , here the player states @xmath9 are characterized by high - dimensional vectors , i.e. @xmath10 with @xmath11 indicating whether @xmath3 provides a fitness benefit to @xmath12 .",
    "the evolutionary dynamics is governed by the following assumptions ( fig[1 ] ) :    * ( 1 ) * the fitness @xmath13 of a node @xmath3 is assumed to be a monotonically increasing function of received net benefit @xmath0 , where @xmath1 and @xmath2 are the number of in and out edges for node @xmath3 .",
    "the parameter @xmath14 quantifies the benefit of an edge ( to the receiver ) relative to its cost ( to the provider ) .    * ( 2 ) * every generation , the @xmath4 most fit nodes produce offspring that replace the @xmath4 least fit nodes .",
    "reproduction preserves all edge relationships of the parent , i.e. parents and offspring connect to the same agents .    *",
    "( 3 ) * there is a small mutation probability @xmath15 per generation with which edges are added / removed randomly .    in other words",
    ", we have a fitness - based selection rule keeping the number of agents @xmath16 constant .",
    "our simulation code is available as an electronic supplement .",
    "our model has four parameters , kept constant throughout the course of evolution : population size @xmath16 , mutation probability @xmath15 , number selected for replacement @xmath4 , and the relative benefit @xmath17 . for every run we keep track of the total number of edges @xmath18 as a function of generation number @xmath19 .",
    "@xmath18 is a measure of the interdependence of the population as well as the average fitness ( the latter follows from @xmath20 , which can be positive or negative depending on the value of @xmath17 ) .",
    "in addition , we study the community structures and genetic composition within the population , which are defined in terms of the connectivity matrix @xmath21 of the network .",
    "we use the convention that @xmath22 if @xmath12 depends on @xmath3 , and @xmath23 otherwise , and represent these by black and white pixels in array plots .",
    "our simulations were run for @xmath24 , partly due to computational constraints .",
    "although this might appear small , we note that the relevant degree of freedom here is the number of edge slots @xmath25 , ensuring that the evolutionary transitions we report are not accidental fluctuations .",
    "the evolutionary dynamics and final interdependence states depend on the values of @xmath17 and relative selection pressure @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the expected number of mutations per generation ( which is equal to the number of mutants if @xmath28 ) .",
    "we can divide the parameter space into four regimes : neutral constructive ( @xmath29 ) , selective constructive ( @xmath30\\sim\\mathcal{o}[m ] , \\beta>1 $ ] ) ) , neutral destructive ( @xmath31 ) and selective destructive ( @xmath30\\sim\\mathcal{o}[m],\\beta<1 $ ] ) . in all cases ,",
    "the formation of an edge is beneficial for one of the nodes and deleterious for the other .",
    "however the value of @xmath17 determines the change in average fitness per edge , @xmath32 , and therefore one intuitively expects @xmath18 to decrease for @xmath33 and increase for @xmath34 as long as selection strength is finite .",
    "we will see that this expectation will not always be satisfied , particularly when @xmath34 .",
    "let us start with the straightforward case of @xmath33 . here",
    "the formation of an edge is more deleterious to its originator than beneficial to its target , and the fitness of the population changes by @xmath35 per edge .",
    "thus , in the long run , only if the selection is weak ( @xmath36 ) can such deleterious edges accumulate , and we get a random interdependence network with @xmath37 . as expected , increasing @xmath26 causes the network to become sparse and fragmented , and all structure vanishes as @xmath30\\sim\\mathcal{o}[m]$ ] .",
    "we now overview the constructive regime @xmath34 , which produces distinct phases of complexity ( fig[2 ] , panels 1 - 6 ) .",
    "the long term behavior of @xmath18 , which can be viewed as a proxy for average fitness as well as interdependence and complexity , depends non - monotonically on selective pressure @xmath26 : for small values of @xmath26 , the asymptotic value @xmath38 decreases with @xmath26 ( fig[2 ] , panels 1 - 3 ) .",
    "however if @xmath26 exceeds a critical point we see sudden transitions between well - defined discrete levels ( fig[2 ] , panels 4 - 6 ) . as selective pressure",
    "is increased further , we see increasingly larger fluctuations around these levels .",
    "we describe these asymptotic states in more detail by connectivity matrices ( fig[3 ] , top row ) and phylogenetic trees ( fig[3 ] bottom row ) for varying levels of @xmath26 .",
    "the phylogenetic trees are obtained by quantifying the similarity distance @xmath39 between all pairs of nodes @xmath3 and @xmath12 . in other words , if @xmath3 and @xmath12 receive from and provide to the same nodes , they are considered to be genetically related , consistent with our reproduction rule ( cf .",
    "fig[1 ] ) .",
    "while the destructive @xmath33 regime produces either random or sparse networks , the constructive regime @xmath34 can be summarized in terms of a sequence of complex phases governed by the value of @xmath26 ( fig[4 ] ) : a transition from cooperation to competition between individuals ( fig[2 ] panels 1 - 3 ) is followed by unstable interactions between individuals and `` bunches '' ( fig[2 ] panel 4 ) , followed by a transition from cooperation to competition between `` bunches '' ( fig[2 ] panels 5 - 6 ) .",
    "we define a _ bunch _ to be the opposite of a graph theoretical community ; a group of nodes that form denser connections towards other groups , than they do within ( cf .",
    "latter two panels in fig[3 ] ) .",
    "dense outwards connections and sparse intra - connections are the key qualitative characteristic of a highly specialized system .",
    "for example , nearly all energy spent by a heart muscle cell is directed at serving other tissues .",
    "the same holds true in a specialized society , e.g. a lawyer dedicates most of her effort defending non - lawyers .",
    "the interdependence structures we report in the latter two panels of fig[3 ] , conform to these biological and social examples of specialization .",
    "we now move towards an understanding of the _ control and manipulation _ of the evolution of interdependence , which is now experimentally possible ( albeit with mixed success ) in biomedical and ecological settings .",
    "for example , the sociality of _",
    "p. aeruginosa _ can be manipulated by drugs that suppress the microbe s production of a common good ( iron scavenging siderophores ) . since the microbes that are resistant to the drug will altruistically continue to produce the expensive siderophores , they are taken over by their selfish counterparts affected by the drug @xcite . as a result",
    ", the iron - deficient population can be easily annihilated by the host s immune system @xcite .",
    "note that the evolutionary fate of the drug - resistant group would have been the opposite , had the drug been an antibiotic instead of a quorum blocker . on the other hand ,",
    "there have also been experiments yielding the _ exact opposite _ outcome , where the drug aggravates the infection instead of impairing it , presumably by leveling the relative advantage of cheaters @xcite .",
    "we will use our model to quantify these mixed outcomes .",
    "social evolution is complex , and its manipulation and control requires a detailed quantitative understanding of the evolutionary outcomes of varying initial states and system parameters .    to manipulate the sociality of a highly interdependent , @xmath34 population , we start with an initial network that has a given community structure , select a fraction @xmath40 of the population , and block a fraction @xmath41 of their outgoing connections of those that are selected . following this perturbation",
    ", we track the evolution of the network and check if our perturbation causes the entire population to lose all connections ( which , for @xmath34 , amounts to minimal fitness ) .",
    "if @xmath18 drops to and remains at zero we count it as a success and we determine the fraction of successes for every parameter value . if @xmath42 , the perturbation can be interpreted as an external introduction of a new strain / species , or a novel mutation which introduces a very small number of selfish individuals in the population . if @xmath43 the perturbation can be interpreted as a drug or event that inflicts nearly everyone , such as the quorum blocker discussed earlier .",
    "accordingly , the quantity @xmath41 can be interpreted as the _ dose _ of the drug , or the degree of `` selfishness '' of the newly introduced species / strain .",
    "fig[5 ] displays the dependence of success as a function of @xmath40 ( empty vs. closed plot markers correspond to @xmath44 and @xmath45 ) , initial population structure @xmath46 ( quantifying the number of bunches ) and @xmath41 .",
    "we consider fast reproducing and slow reproducing species separately , shown in the left and right panels respectively .",
    "it is important to distinguish between two very different mechanisms that bring the population back to its pre - perturbed state .",
    "the first is determined by the time required for interdependence to evolve anew from @xmath47 .",
    "the original factors causing the establishment of cooperation in the first place is present regardless of our perturbation , and the effect of even the strongest drug ( @xmath48 ) is to simply reset the evolutionary clock .",
    "the second mechanism is evolution through the repopulation of the drug - resistant fraction , which happens much faster , on reproductive time - scales . to clearly distinguish between these two mechanisms , we set @xmath49 in fig[5 ] ; using a finite @xmath15 scales down all the success rates , but does not otherwise change the qualitative dependence on @xmath40 , @xmath41 and @xmath46 .",
    "we observe a number of interesting features in the response of the population to external perturbations . for @xmath50",
    "we find a non - monotonic dependence of success rate to @xmath17 for populations with few bunches : for slow reproducing populations a moderate dose works as well as , or better than , a strong one . for larger number of bunches , and faster reproduction rates the non - monotonicity vanishes",
    ": the stronger the dose , the better the outcome .",
    "a second remarkable outcome is the degree to which a few individuals can make a difference : targeting @xmath44 of the population is as effective as targeting @xmath51 of the population provided the drug has a high enough dose .",
    "this is because few selfish individuals , as is the case in tumors or invasive species , can devastate an entire population .",
    "finally , we observe a very strong dependence of the success rate on the initial community structure . with increasing @xmath46 and @xmath4",
    "this difference vanishes .",
    "( left ) or the bunch modularity ( right ) as a function of relevant system parameters . traversing both phase diagrams ( bottom row ) in the horizontal direction",
    "clarifies the phase profile .",
    "since the some of the phases are highly dynamic , the @xmath52 ( left - top ) is taken to be the minimum number of dependences in a large time - window in the long - time limit . ]",
    "the phase diagram for the evolution of interdependence is shown in fig[4 ] and compactly summarizes our results .",
    "panel 1 shows the number of dependences , while panel 2 quantifies their structure through `` bunch modularity '' .",
    "we define the latter by exchanging @xmath53 in the connectivity matrix and determining the community modularity . throughout",
    ", we will discuss and label separate phases of interdependence by letters a - d .      in the neutral regime ( @xmath36 ) additions and deletions of edges are equally likely .",
    "thus , if the population starts fully independent , @xmath18 increases until the network is fully randomized with @xmath54 edges .",
    "this increase is statistically irreversible , and is the analogue of the scenario described in @xcite . in the neutral regime individuals",
    "have high fitness due to the benefits of indirect reciprocity ; interdependence emerges not due to higher fitness but simply due to higher likelihood .",
    "fig[1a ] shows the dynamics and final outcome of nearly - neutral evolution . despite following a similar trajectory to fully - neutral evolution ( @xmath55 , indicated by the dashed curve in all panels of fig[2 ] )",
    ", the connectivity matrix shows the onset of community formation ; the interdependence structure and genetic composition of the population is far from random ( compare fig[3a , 3b ] ) .    as the selection strength",
    "is increased ( @xmath56 but not @xmath36 ) the fluctuations in @xmath18 are amplified .",
    "this is caused by the random formation of nodes for which the number of in - edges are different than out - edges .",
    "however the system is self stabilizing ( fig[2 ] , panels 1,2 ) ; e.g. when the fit defectors reproduce , they typically replace their unfit providers , which in turn reduces their own fitness .",
    "consequently they are taken over by the fair and fit nodes that dominate the @xmath36 population . in fig[3 ] panel 3 , two large reciprocating groups can be distinguished .",
    "they are taken advantage by smaller scale opportunistic sub - populations .",
    "it is also possible to see a smaller sub - cooperative group sustaining itself within a larger cooperative group .      as @xmath4 approaches @xmath57 from below",
    ", the fluctuations in @xmath18 become comparable to @xmath18 itself . here",
    "the selective competition is just high enough to allow for small cooperative communities to form and grow at a rate much higher than random chance , but also high enough for cheaters to spread over their providers in one step , beyond recovery ( fig[1 ] , panel 3 ) .",
    "although regime a and b have similar destabilizing factors , their re - stabilization is very different .",
    "the drops in @xmath18 in regime a can recover through _ re - population _",
    ", over time scales @xmath58 .",
    "in contrast regime b exhibits system - size losses from which the only way to recover is _ re - mutation _",
    ", over longer time scales determined by @xmath59 , as the smallest cooperative group requires two mutations .    comparing a to b reveals that higher selection strength in this case leads to lower fitness ;",
    "had one mixed the stronger - selected population b with the weaker - selected one a , the former would be driven to extinction .",
    "the behavior of b is similar to that expected in a classical prisoner s dilemma , which emerges from our model as a special case - survival of the fittest produces the globally least fit outcome .      as @xmath4",
    "is increased above the critical point @xmath60 higher structures start to form . while the connectivity matrix @xmath21 is sparse and random for @xmath4 just below @xmath61 , we start seeing metastable bunches at @xmath62 , the number and stability of which increases with @xmath4 . the sudden jump in the edge number",
    "we see in fig[3 ] , panels 4 - 5 is analogous to that found in @xcite .    for a very large window of selective strength @xmath63\\sim r<\\mathcal{o}[n]$ ] , we see that the system can only maintain certain discrete values of @xmath52 .",
    "these are the stable configurations corresponding to an integer number of equal sized bunches ( @xmath46 ) given by the relation @xmath64 , @xmath65 ( fig[2 ] panel 4 ) .",
    "the maximum number of bunches @xmath66 is determined by the mutation rate , @xmath67 ( i.e. so that in steady state there is one mutation per bunch per time step ) .",
    "however , we have observed @xmath46 transiently increasing to @xmath68 higher than this value .",
    "note that the degree of interdependence ( and hence the average fitness ) in the strong selection limit well exceeds that in the weak selection limit .",
    "it is interesting that in the limit @xmath69 , we see structures more complex than bunches . these include hierarchies ( smaller bunches within a bunch ) , cycles ( 3 or more groups providing to one other ) , and hierarchies of cycles ( cycles within a cycle ) . in this limit",
    "the dynamics of @xmath18 still exhibits discrete steps similar to fig[2 ] panel 5 , however with more possible metastable plateaus corresponding to unequal sized matrix blocks .      with increasing @xmath4 the fluctuation in the number of edges around the stable @xmath46 starts increasing , and we see destructive competition similar to that near the phase boundary of b ; however , now the competition is between the bunches rather than the individuals , which creates significant size differences between them .",
    "these fluctuations can lead to one bunch replacing another , causing @xmath70 to make large transitions between different values of @xmath46 . despite the apparent noise ( fig[2 ] panel 6 )",
    "the dependence structure remains in a highly ordered state with high reciprocity .",
    "as @xmath4 is increased further we see that competition between bunches cause fluctuations comparable to the size of bunches . i.e. a small bunch can increase in size by spreading over others until another metastable structure re - evolves .",
    "( empty markers ) and @xmath51 ( filled markers ) of the nodes as susceptible to our perturbation .",
    "we then block @xmath41 ( horizontal axis ) of the out edges of the susceptible population , and determine the probability that the strong cooperating population collapses into a weak non - cooperating one ( i.e to @xmath47 ) .",
    "to clearly distinguish between the spread of the resistant subpopulation @xmath40 , and novel mutations that occur after our perturbation , we set @xmath49 ( finite @xmath15 merely adds noise to the curves ) .",
    "we observe that the effect of the drug strongly depends on the community structure for slow reproducing species ( left , @xmath71 ) but not for fast reproducing ones ( right , @xmath72 ) .",
    "the dashed curve shows how devastating even a small number of antisocial individuals be for the whole population , and suggests treatments where individual cells are targeted .",
    "the strong dependence of annihilation probability on @xmath46 for small @xmath46 ( left panel ) might explain why quorum blockers are effective against some biofilms forming bacteria but not others .",
    "interestingly , for @xmath73 , @xmath74 is significantly higher than @xmath75 , suggesting that for small number of cooperative bunches smaller perturbations may be more effective than larger ones . ]",
    "we have constructed a simple model that allows us to study the co - evolution of self - replicating interdependent structures , and reported multiple evolutionary transitions as @xmath17 and @xmath4 are varied .",
    "this model is quite general and has very few assumptions - the fitness function is only assumed to be an arbitrary increasing function of @xmath76 and there are only two relevant parameters governing the dynamics ( selection strength @xmath26 and relative benefit @xmath77 ) since the population size @xmath16 does not make a qualitative difference as long as both @xmath78 and @xmath4 are much smaller than @xmath16 .",
    "furthermore , the value @xmath17 does not make a qualitative difference apart from whether it is larger or smaller than unity , and no _ quantitative _ difference if @xmath79 is smaller than @xmath80 . unlike the typical simplified models of evolutionary game theory we do not assume that an individual s behavior is the same towards all others ( although some individuals can end up in a state where they give to all and receive from all )",
    ". in this respect the states allowed in this work is a generalization of the two - state models common in the literature .",
    "thus , we hope that our model can serve as a guiding framework for understanding the emergence of sociality .    even in this simple case ,",
    "we observe a number of surprising and important phenomena .",
    "first , we report that even the weakest selection strengths ( @xmath81 ) can produce interdependence structures that are far from random .",
    "thus , assumptions regarding `` random interdependence '' invoked by neutral evolutionary arguments may be too strong @xcite .",
    "our second observation is the natural emergence of specialized bunches and multi scale structures from the simple laws of evolutionary dynamics .",
    "as we probe the response of the system to various selection strengths , we see regimes of random interdependence , competition between nodes , cooperation between nodes ( bunches ) and competition between bunches .",
    "thirdly we report that the regime @xmath82 does not ensure complex interdependence .",
    "there exists a `` dead zone '' within the constructive regime ( fig[2c ] ) due to the competition between agents .",
    "this non - monotonic dependence of @xmath52 on selection strength can have important implications in medicine .",
    "for example , biofilm populations may be induced into a less virulent non - cooperative state by decreasing the selective pressure , so that a cooperative film behaving as fig[2e ] evolves into an intermediate non - cooperative state behaving as fig[2c ] .",
    "this may be experimentally verified in _",
    "p. aeruginosa _ by increasing the available iron while keeping their population constant by limiting their carbon source .",
    "another remarkable result is the non - monotonic connection between anti - social drug dose and the successful annihilation of cooperativeness .",
    "indeed , the model exhibits a a `` contagion '' effect which allows the manipulation of a few individuals to have population - wide effects .",
    "it has been noted that introducing several selfish mutants ( or using an anti - social drug effective on a few individuals ) may be far more effective than manipulating an entire population @xcite and is consistent with experimental observations @xcite .",
    "finally , when mutation rate is set to zero we observe that the behavior of @xmath18 resembles that of classical population dynamics .",
    "the dynamics between providers and receivers becomes qualitatively similar to that between the predators and prey of a lotka - volterra type system .",
    "starting from a randomized connectivity matrix and setting @xmath49 , it is common for @xmath18 to reach a fixed value and oscillate around it .    due to its generality and applicability , our model has room for many natural extensions .",
    "for example , the distribution of parameters and fitness functions in a more realistic model could include spatial , temporal and individual heterogeneity .",
    "further , the quantities @xmath15 , @xmath83 and @xmath84 can be dynamic as they are themselves , to an extent , subject to evolutionary forces .",
    "this can lead to a very interesting set of potential future studies exploring connections between interdependence and evolvability / efficiency .",
    "another factor not taken into account here is the possibility of the change in population size due to statistical fluctuations ( e.g. due to a time dependent energy input , or infection / predation )",
    ". such extensions would be appropriate to address systems in ecology , structured biological population , and provide insight into complicated social trends .",
