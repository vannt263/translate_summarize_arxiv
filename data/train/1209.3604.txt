    "cross polarization ( cp ) , developed by hartmann and hahn  @xcite in 1962 and later modified by pines et al  @xcite , is one of the most important techniques in nmr .",
    "mediated by heteronuclear dipolar interaction , polarization is often transferred from abundant i spins to a rare s spin with a polarization enhancement up to @xmath4 . because the overall delay time is just only subject to the spin - lattice relaxation time of i spins , considerable nmr time",
    "is saved compared with a single pulse experiment .",
    "cp dynamics for a single crystal was first derived by mller et al  @xcite . for a stationary sample , the hamiltonian is time independent , it can also be solved by diagonalization of the hamiltonians . under fast magic angle spinning(mas ) ( @xmath5 ) , the hartman - hahn match condition shift to @xmath6(@xmath7 )  @xcite and the effective heteronuclear dipolar interaction becomes time independent  @xcite .",
    "consequently the cp dynamics under fast mas can be derived without many problems  @xcite , in particular under lee - goldburg ( lg )  @xcite condition as demonstrated by ladizhansky et al  @xcite . however",
    ", under conventional mas speed , the heteronuclear dipolar interaction becomes time dependent , as many other quantum systems , searching for an analytic solution is usually not conceivable .",
    "so far , cp dynamics under conventional mas speed is usually calculated with a spin temperature hypothesis  @xcite .",
    "it inevitably leads to an empirical solution  @xcite . in the zero- and double - quantum spaces  @xcite , which commutes with each other",
    ", the evolution of density matrix can be done separately in the two spaces , simplifying the calculation considerably . by means of this method",
    ", a number of intriguing phenomena in cp has been understood thoroughly .",
    "they include cp dynamics of phase - shifted cp under mismatch conditions  @xcite , w - moist  @xcite , double - quantum matched cp  @xcite , and adiabatic polarization transfer  @xcite .    up to now",

    "we show that this problem can be resolved in the zero- and double - quantum spaces together with average hamiltionian theory  @xcite .",
    "the experiment and simulated results match well with the theoretical predictions .",
    "for a heteronuclear dipolar coupled @xmath8 spin pair under cross polarization and magic angle spinning ( cpmas ) , the hamiltonian can be described by @xmath9 where @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the strengths of the i and s spin - locking fields , respectively , and @xmath12 \\end{split}\\ ] ] is a time dependent heteronuclear dipolar coupling constant with two euler angles in the rotor - fixed frame . in the zero- and double - quantum spaces ,",

    "the hamiltonian in the zero - quantum space becomes @xmath22 which is time dependent .",
    "for every particular time , it can be represented by a zero - order average hamiltonian @xmath23 \\\\ & -sin^{2}(\\beta)[sin(2\\omega_{r}t+2\\gamma)-sin(2\\gamma)]\\}\\sigma_{z}^{\\delta}. \\end{split}\\ ] ] since @xmath24=0 $ ] for any @xmath25 and @xmath26 , all the higher order hamiltonians vanish .",

    "the cp dynamics provides valuable molecular structural information .",
    "similar to redo experiment  @xcite , this analytic solution also provides a measure of dipolar coupling constant(or distance ) for a strongly coupled system that is surrounded by a moderately coupled network . unlike many other others  @xcite",
    ", this method does not required high mas speed .",
    "if lg spin locking is applied to proton channel , the result of least - square fitting in fig.[figure2 ] will be better because all homonuclear coupling is decoupled .",
    "for a time dependent system , it is unlikely to find a systematic way for analytic solutions .",
    "this may explain why cp dynamics discussed in this article was delayed for so long a time .",
    "for an inhomogeneously broaden system ( @xmath50=0 $ ] )  @xcite , all high order average hamiltonians become zero except for the zero order average hamiltonian that can be calculate conveniently .",
