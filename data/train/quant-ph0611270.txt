    "the quantum heisenberg xy model , which was first intensively studied by lieb et al in the early 1960s @xcite , has aroused new interests in recent years .",
    "it was taken to be a potential candidate model in the practical applications in quantum computation @xcite and quantum information @xcite .",
    "the heisenberg model is not only a theoretical model with many interesting physics in it , but also realized in recent years in laboratory in physical systems such as quantum dots @xcite , nuclear spins @xcite and electronic spins @xcite .",
    "many theoretical researchs @xcite had been devoted into the model to explore the important quantum properties , especially the correlation function @xcite , the entanglement @xcite and quantum phase transition @xcite in one dimensional systems .",
    "the studies show that the amount of the spatial correlation and entanglement between two spins in a spin chain ( with open end ) or a spin ring ( with periodical boundary condition ) can be modified by changing the magnitude of the external magnetic field and/or the interaction strength . and these two quantities shows singularity and obeys the scaling law in the vicinity of the quantum phase transition point of the system . + the quantum phase transition , which can take place at @xmath0 , is an interesting subject and intensively studied in the last decades @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we studied the quantum phase transitions of the xy model through the calculation of the correlation and the concurrence @xcite between two nearest - neighbor spins . by changing the magnetic field or coupling coefficient , we find that both of the two quantities have finite jumps at some critical points .",
    "the states of the system are carefully studied , the jumps are related to the level crossing @xcite of the ground state to the excited state .",
    "the change of the symmetry of the ground state @xcite is the course of the quantum phase transition .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "[ sec : hamiltonian ] , we introduce the hamiltonian for the heisenberg xy model in an external field and describe the computation procedures for the correlation and the concurrence of the subsystem ; detailed results and discussions are given in section [ sec : discussion ] ; the conclusion of our study is given in section [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "the model studied here is a one dimensional spin-1/2 chain with periodical boundary condition ( pbc ) @xcite under a transverse isotropic magnetic field .",
    "the hamiltonian is : @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the number of spins , @xmath3 and @xmath4 from the pbc . @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the coupling strength between nearest - neighbor spins along the direction of @xmath7 and @xmath8 , respectively , @xmath9 is the amplitude of the magnetic field along @xmath10 direction .",
    "@xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the well - known pauli matrix : @xmath14 the parameters @xmath5 and @xmath6 may be represented by their average value @xmath15 and anisotropic parameter @xmath16 as : @xmath17 and the hamiltonian may be written as : @xmath18 + \\sum_{i=1}^{n}b_z\\sigma_z^{(i)},\\ ] ] where @xmath19 ) : @xmath20    the spatial correlation @xcite between two spins , 1 and 2 , is defined by @xmath21 where @xmath22 can be represented explicitly in a matrix form in the product eigenspace of @xmath23 : @xmath24 and @xmath25 is the reduced density matrix of the spin 1 and 2 derived from the density matrix @xmath26 of the whole system .",
    "@xmath27 means to trace out all the spin degrees of freedom except spins 1 and 2 . in this study , we are interested in the ground state of the whole system , which is the lowest energy eigenstate @xmath28 of @xmath29 , so @xmath30 .",
    "+ the concurrence of spins 1 and 2 is defined as @xcite : @xmath31 where @xmath32 are the square roots of the eigenvalues of the product matrix @xmath33 in decreasing order . where @xmath25 is the reduced density matrix of the two spins subsystem , and @xmath34 is constructed as @xmath35 .",
    "equation ( [ concurrence ] ) applies to both of the mixed state and pure state .",
    "the reduced density matrix may be write down implicitly as : @xmath36 then we get @xmath34 as the matrix below : @xmath37 if the bipartite quantum state @xmath25 is pure , it can always be written as : @xmath38 ) could be simplified to @xmath39",
    ".the discontinuities in fig . [ fig : ssaf4 - 10 ] [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tal : disbz ]    the effect of the magnitude of magnetic field on the phase transition was shown in figure [ fig : cor6jr0 ] , in which we plot the case of a @xmath40 spins system with three different magnetic fields , @xmath41 , @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "the corresponding transition points of @xmath15 are listed in table [ tal : disbz ] . by simple calculation and comparison",
    ", we found that the transition values of @xmath15 for each transition is approximately proportional to the magnitude of the external field .",
    "+ figure [ fig : cor6b ] plots the variation of correlation @xmath44 with the applied field @xmath9 for fixed coupling coefficient @xmath45 and different values of anisotropic parameter @xmath16 .",
    "the system sizes are @xmath46 . when @xmath47 , there are @xmath48 jumps for a 6 spins system as in the case of isotropic case . however , with the increase of anisotropy @xmath16 , the magnitude of the jumps becomes smaller and the transition points moves slightly to the direction @xmath49 , till finally disappears in the completely anisotropic case @xmath50 . since the @xmath50 corresponding to the ising case , where the internal number of freedom is 1 , the phase transition is different to the xy case where the internal number of freedom is 2 .",
    "our calculation shows that the cross over from @xmath51 to @xmath52 is continuous .",
    "it is also verified that there is no quantum phase transition in the quantum ising case .",
    "+ now we turn to the concurrence between two spins , @xmath53 .",
    "the following results were obtained for a system of @xmath46 .",
    "figures [ fig : con6jr0 ] plot the variation of concurrence @xmath53 with the coupling strength @xmath15 in the isotropic case ( @xmath54 ) , the applied magnetic field fixed to three values , @xmath55 , @xmath56 and @xmath57 . from the figures we see the same phase transition behavior as that of the correlation functions .",
    "jumps are found at exactly the same places , which can also be checked in table [ tal : disbz ] , as for the correlation functions .",
    "figures [ fig : con6b ] gave the variation of @xmath53 with the magnitude of external field @xmath9 for @xmath58 different anisotropy @xmath16 .",
    "when @xmath59 , the jumps in concurrence are clearly observed while for larger @xmath60 s the magnitude of the jumps becomes smaller and smaller and turn to the smooth curve in the case of @xmath61 .",
    "+ it is interesting to note that the physics behind the above phase transitions turns out to be very simple and clear , it is the result of level crossing of the ground state . to clarify this point , we turn to a detailed analysis of the ground states of the system under different sets of parameters .",
    "to be specific , we use @xmath62 and @xmath63 to represent the `` spin down '' and `` spin up '' state for each spin in the eigenspace of @xmath23 respectively .",
    "the state of the whole system of @xmath2 spins @xmath64 can be written as a linear combination of @xmath65 states and @xmath65 normalized coefficients : @xmath66 where @xmath67 stands for the direct product state @xmath68 .",
    "we diagonalized the hamiltonian and calculated the eigen function and the corresponding eigen energy .",
    "we take the coupling strength @xmath69 and anisotropy @xmath70 for simplicity .",
    "figure [ fig : esbz ] shows the variation of several states energy ( someone of them will be the ground state in some interval of @xmath71 ) with the magnitude of external field @xmath9 .",
    "it is clear from the figure that level crossing occurs at the positions where abrupt changes of the correlation function and the concurrence were observed .",
    "concretely , when @xmath72 , the ground state ( which has been normalized ) of the whole system is @xmath73 which is basically the combination of the states with antiferromagnetic order , that is , the states with half of the spins `` up '' and half of the spins `` down '' .",
    "when @xmath74 , the ground state changed to @xmath75 this is the state that 2 spins `` up '' and 4 spins `` down '' .",
    "in the course of increasing the applied field @xmath9 , the energy level corresponding to the state ( [ first ] ) increases and the energy level corresponding to the state ( [ second ] ) decreases . at the critical field , @xmath76 , the two levels meet and then crossed ,",
    "then the ground state of the spin chain is a combination of the two level states . beyond the critical field",
    "the ground state becomes the state ( [ second ] ) .",
    "the cross of the ground state changed the symmetry of the ground state abruptly so that a quantum phase transition occurs . at about @xmath77 ,",
    "another level cross take place and over that point , the ground state of the system becomes , @xmath78 this is a combination of states with 1 spins `` up '' and 5 spins `` down '' . and finally , when @xmath79 , the ground state is simply as @xmath80 which is the state with ferromagnetic order .",
    "we see from the above analysis that the quantum phase transition is a result of the level crossing of the ground state , and the level crossing is simply the result of the competition between the coupling strength @xmath15 , which favors antiferromagnetic order , and the applied field , which favors the ferromagnetic order . by increasing the applied field",
    "while keeping the coupling strength constant , the ground state changed from antiferromagnetic order to the ferromagnetic order in several steps , turns a spin from `` up '' to `` down '' at each step .",
    "so we observed that @xmath81 .",
    "this also explains the number of jumps in the correlation function and concurrence , which must be half of the whole number of spins .",
    "in this paper , we studied the spatial correlation @xmath82 and the degree of entanglement @xmath53 between two nearest - neighbor spins along a one - dimension spin ring in heisenberg xy model .",
    "we found that in the isotropic case with fixed external field @xmath9 , quantum phase transitions of both @xmath82 and @xmath53 were observed with the increment of coupling strength @xmath15 , the phase transitions will smoothed out as the anisotropy @xmath16 increased and disappears at the extremum value of @xmath50 .",
    "the transition is a direct result of the level crossing of the ground state of the whole system , in which the symmetry of the ground state changed abruptly at the crossing point .    100    e.  lieb , t.  schultz , and d.  mattis , ann . phys.n.y . * 16 * , 407 ( 1961 )    s.b .",
