    "dwarf galaxies are the most dominant population of the present  day universe @xcite . in the standard cold dark matter model low",
    " mass galaxies are considered to be the first luminous objects .",
    "if the present dwarfs are dark matter dominated , they could account for a significant fraction of the mass of galaxy clusters .",
    "besides their numerosity , dwarfs seem to be the simplest galactic system available for reliable observational study and theoretical modelling .",
    "the hydrodynamical simulations are based on our own variant of the chemo ",
    "dynamical smoothed particle hydrodynamics ( * cd  sph * ) approach , including feedback through star formation phenomena .",
    "the dynamics of the dark matter component are treated within a standard n  body approach .",
    "thus , the satellite galaxy consists of dark matter , gas and `` star '' particles . for a detailed description of the * cd  sph * code ( the star formation algorithm ,",
    "the snii , snia and pn production , and the chemical enrichment ) the reader is referred to @xcite .",
    "it is to be noted that the code was slightly modified for the present problem so as to include the photometric evolution of each `` star '' particle , based on the idea of the single stellar population ( ssp ) @xcite . at each time - step ,",
    "absolute magnitudes : m@xmath0 , m@xmath1 , m@xmath2 , m@xmath3 , m@xmath4 , m@xmath5 , m@xmath6 and m@xmath7 are defined separately for each `` star '' particle . the ssp integrated colours ( ubvrikm )",
    "are taken from @xcite ( table 2 ) . the spectro  photometric evolution of the overall ensemble of the `` star '' particles forms the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of the satellite .",
    "the central host galaxy is assumed to be a milky - way  like system .",
    "it is modelled as a disk + bulge + halo system according to @xcite .",
    "the initial satellite proto - galaxy is taken to be a gas  rich and dark matter dominated proto  dwarf with a total mass @xmath8 and an initial radius @xmath9 .",
    "the baryonic ( i.e. initial `` gas '' ) mass of the proto  dwarf is @xmath10 , and the initial dark - matter ( dm ) mass is @xmath11 .",
    "initially the centre of the proto  dwarf is located at galactocentric coordinates ( 0 , 0 , 150 kpc ) .",
    "the initial velocity field of this object is defined as the sum of the orbital motion in the host galaxy in the polar plane ( yz ) and the rotation around its own rotational axis ( parallel to the x axis of host galaxy ) .",
    "the initial velocity of orbital motion is : @xmath12 .",
    "the dimensionless angular velocity vector of the rotation is @xmath13 . as the system unit for this physical parameter",
    "we use the value : @xmath14 .",
    "extensive numerical simulation show that model evolution results in the formation of a baryon - dominated satellite galaxy .",
    "the basic process keeping this scenario is the dissipative nature of the baryonic component of the proto  dwarf , which easily forms a compact structure with a radius smaller than the tidal radius .",
    "the practically dissipationless dark - matter component forms an extended structure which is effectively destroyed via tidal influence of the massive galaxy .",
    "this mechanism is very interesting in the context of the possible existence of of dsph galaxies with a low dark - matter content .",
