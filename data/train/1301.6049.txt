    "in the study of the structure and evolution of low - mass stars , there are a variety of different methods capable of yielding reasonably accurate age estimates ; for a thorough discussion of the different methods , and their strengths and weaknesses , see the review by @xcite .",
    "one such method uses detached eclipsing binaries ( debs ) to assign an age .",
    "debs are fantastic systems for studying stellar evolution .",
    "observations can provide precise masses and radii for the component stars that are nearly model independent ( see reviews by * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "tight constraints on the stellar masses and radii allow for stringent tests of stellar evolution models .",
    "furthermore , the age of a deb system can be derived if stellar models can predict the radius of each star in the binary at a common age and with a single chemical composition .",
    "deriving an age estimate from a deb is straightforward once precise masses and radii are extracted from the data .",
    "however , the reliability of the age estimate is contingent upon the accuracy of the stellar models .",
    "recently , pre - main sequence ( pre - ms ) and ms models of low - mass stars ( @xmath1 ) have received substantial criticism for not accurately predicting the radii of stars in debs .",
    "as the number of debs with precisely measured masses and radii has increased , it has become clear that stellar models under - predict the radii of stars in debs by upward of 10% ( see , for example , * ? ? ?",

    "the discrepancies between model and observed radii have been largely attributed to the effects of magnetic fields and magnetic activity @xcite .",
    "when present , the discrepancy between observations and model predictions severely limits the use of stellar evolution models to derive the age of individual deb systems .",
    "we propose a novel method to use low - mass , pre - ms debs to estimate the ages of young stellar systems . instead of comparing individual stellar surface properties to stellar evolution models , we propose to use the dynamics of the deb system . that is , comparing the observed rate of apsidal motion to stellar model predictions computed using the interior structure constants .",
    "this technique is less sensitive to the surface effects of magnetic fields than are methods that only invoke the stellar radius or effective temperature .",
    "our method has the potential to provide a more reliable age estimate .",
    "below , we outline the model calculations ( section  [ sec : model ] ) , including the computation of the interior structure constants ( section  [ sec : isc ] ) .",
    "results pertaining to the time evolution of the interior structure constants as a function of stellar mass are given in section  [ sec : res ] .",
    "we conclude with a discussion of the usefulness of this method in section  [ sec : disc ] .",
    "model evolutionary tracks used in this study were computed with the dartmouth stellar evolution program ( dsep ) . the physics incorporated in the models",
    "have been described extensively in the literature @xcite , but we will provide a brief overview of the physics pertinent to the present study .    arguably the most critical component of low - mass stellar evolution models is the equation of state ( eos ) . for masses considered in this study dsep",
    "uses the freeeos in the eos4 configuration .",
    "we selected the freeeos for three primary reasons .",
    "first , it includes non - ideal contributions to the eos , such as coulomb interactions and pressure ionization , that become important in the dense plasma of low - mass stars .",
    "second , the freeeos calculates the eos for hydrogen , helium , and eighteen heavier elements as opposed to only calculating the eos for hydrogen and helium . finally , the freeeos may be called directly from within the stellar evolution code .",
    "this feature avoids the need to interpolate within eos tables , thereby minimizing numerical errors .",
    "conditions near the outer , optically thin layers of low - mass stars preclude the use of gray atmosphere approximations ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "therefore , we use the phoenix ames - cond model atmospheres @xcite to define the surface boundary conditions for our interior models .",
    "the atmosphere models are attached at the photosphere , is reasonable for @xmath2 ; for lower masses it is necessary to attach the model atmosphere deeper into the interior . ] taken to be the point where @xmath3 .",
    "the radiative opacities we adopt are the opal opacities above @xmath4 k @xcite in combination with the @xcite opacities below @xmath4 k. for models that are not fully - convective , helium and heavy element diffusion are treated according to the formulation of @xcite .",
    "fully - convective models are assumed to be completely and homogeneously mixed because the convective timescale is considerably faster than the diffusion timescale @xcite .",
    "the primary input variables of stellar evolution models are defined relative to the sun .",
    "these input variables include the stellar mass , the initial mass fractions of helium ( @xmath5 ) and heavy elements ( @xmath6 ) , and the convective mixing - length ( @xmath7 ) .",
    "therefore , we must first define what constitutes the sun for our model setup .",
    "we require that a 1 @xmath8 model accurately predict the solar radius , the solar luminosity , the radius to the base of the solar convection zone , and the solar photospheric ( @xmath9 ) at the solar age ( 4.57 gyr ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) by iterating over different combinations of @xmath5 , @xmath6 , and @xmath7 we are able to converge upon a solution for the sun .",
    "the final set of variables that satisfies the above criteria for the solar heavy element composition of @xcite was @xmath10 , @xmath11 , and @xmath12 .",
    "the distribution of mass within a star in a close binary system is influenced by the star s rotation and by tidal interaction with its companion .",
    "imagine two stars , a and b. the rotation of star a and the tidal interaction of star b with star a distorts the shape of star a. instead of remaining spherically symmetric , the equilibrium configuration of star a will become ellipsoidal . subsequently , the gravitational potential of star a will also become ellipsoidal .",
    "the same can be said from the perspective of star b.    if the binary orbit is elliptical , the distorted gravitational potential will cause the orbit to precess .",
    "this precession may be likened to the precession of mercury s orbit about the sun ",
    "although , mercury s precession is due to general relativity .",
    "the precession of the binary orbit is known as apsidal motion .    the rate of apsidal motion ( @xmath13 ; measured in degrees per cycle ) , or the rate at which the orbit precesses , is governed by the shape of the gravitational potential , which may be deformed as discussed above .",

    "additionally , @xmath21 is the semi - major axis of the orbit , @xmath22 and @xmath23 with @xmath24 being the eccentricity of the orbit . finally , the last term in equation ( [ eq : ap ] ) , @xmath25 , is the weighted interior structure constant observed for the two binary stars . in general , @xmath26 here , @xmath27 and @xmath28 are the interior structure constants for each star",
    ".    equations ( [ eq : ap])([eq : k2w ] ) are derived from a @xmath29-th order solid harmonic expansion of the gravitational potential ( see , for example , * ? ? ?",
    "the interior structure constant for a given star , @xmath30 , is the second - order term from a more general set of expansion coefficients , @xmath31 .",
    "these second - order coefficients quantify the central concentration  or radial distribution  of mass within a star @xcite .",
    "lower values of @xmath30 correspond to a higher level of central mass concentration .",
    "point sources , for example , have @xmath32 .",
    "observationally , we can not solve for the individual @xmath33 values .",
    "however , in the above equations , every variable is a direct observable , except for @xmath25 .",
    "the latter must be inferred from observational determinations of @xmath13 and the @xmath34 coefficients .",
    "since the individual @xmath35 values depend on the stellar density distribution , they can provide deep insight into the validity of stellar evolution models . to bypass the restriction that only @xmath25 can be inferred from observations , we use @xmath30 values from stellar evolution models in combination with the observed @xmath34 coefficients to derive a theoretical @xmath25 .",
    "dsep is equipped to calculate the general interior structure constants , @xmath36 , for a star at every evolutionary time step .",
    "this is achieved by solving radau s equation after each model iteration .",
    "following the formalism outlined by @xcite , @xmath37 with @xmath38 being the order of the solid harmonic , @xmath39 is the radius of an equipotential surface ( @xmath40 when the surfaces are spherically symmetric ) , and @xmath41 in the above equation , @xmath42 is the stellar deviation from sphericity .",
    "we also introduced @xmath43 , the density of the stellar plasma at radius @xmath39 , and @xmath44 , the volume averaged density at each radius , @xmath45    if we assume that tides and rotation do not significantly alter the shape of a star , we are permitted to use a spherically symmetric model to compute the interior structure constant .",
    "our code employs a @xmath46-order runge - kutta integration scheme to obtain a particular solution of radau s equation at the stellar photosphere .",
    "interior structure constants are then directly related to the particular solutions at the surface , @xmath47 , through @xmath48}.\\ ] ] but , is it reasonable to assume that the stellar mass is not significantly redistributed due to rotation and tides ?    the effect of rotation on the central mass concentration of stars with a total mass greater than @xmath49 was investigated in several previous studies @xcite . for stars less massive than @xmath49 ,",
    "the effect of rotation should be negligible because they have a higher mean density compared to solar - type stars .",
    "to test this assumption , we used chandrasekhar s analysis of slowly rotating polytropes to estimate the amount of oblateness  or deviation from spherical symmetry  rotating low - mass stars may be expected to have .",
    "@xcite derived an analytical expression for the stellar oblateness for slowly rotating polytropes .",
    "the oblateness was defined to be the relative difference between the equatorial radius and the polar radius , @xmath50 with @xmath51 and @xmath52 being the equatorial and polar radius , respectively .",
    "polytropes were considered slowly rotating when @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the stellar angular velocity , @xmath55 is the gravitational constant , and @xmath56 is the mass density in the stellar core .",
    "does this criterion apply to real low - mass stars ? if we assume a rotation period of 1.0 day and a core density of 10 g  @xmath57 ( realistic for pre - ms low - mass stars ) , then @xmath58 .",
    "the result of chandrasekhar s analysis was a relation between the stellar oblateness and @xmath59 for different values of the polytropic index , @xmath60 , @xmath61 stars with masses below 0.65  @xmath62 are best represented by a polytrope with @xmath63 . assuming @xmath64",
    ", a low - mass star will have @xmath65 .",
    "this treatment indicates that the effect of rotation on the sphericity of low - mass stars is a 1% effect ; rotation will not be addressed in this study .",
    "assessing the influence of tides is difficult .",
    "we expect spherically symmetric models to provide accurate estimates of the mass distribution if @xmath66 , where @xmath67 is the roche lobe radius .",
    "we also caution that the configuration of the binary must be considered .",
    "if the rotational axes are not aligned , as found with @xcite , then the validity of the assumptions required to derive of @xmath30 no longer hold .",
    "see section [ sec : disc ] for a further discussion .",
    "general relativistic distortion of the gravitational potential also plays a role in determining the rate of apsidal motion @xcite .",
    "this contribution to the apsidal motion rate can be added to the classical contribution ( i.e. , equation  ( [ eq : ap ] ) ) @xmath68 where @xmath69 , @xmath70 , and @xmath71 are the total apsidal motion rate , classical apsidal motion rate , and the rate predicted from general relativity .",
    "the general relativistic contribution does not depend on the mass distribution of the stars .",
    "thus , general relativity does not affect the theoretical derivation of the interior structure constants , but must be accounted for prior to comparing the theoretical and observational determinations of @xmath25 .",
    "individual , solar - metallicity evolutionary tracks were computed for several masses ranging from the fully - convective regime ( @xmath72 ) up to masses where stars have thin convective envelopes ( @xmath73 ) . near the boundary where the transition from a radiative core to a fully - convective interior is expected ( @xmath74 ) , a finer grid of mass tracks was generated to allow for further exploration .",
    "the evolution of @xmath30 with age for each mass track is presented in figure  [ fig : k2age ] .",
    "the full collection of mass tracks ( including analysis routines ) used hereafter have been made available on online .",
    "stellar models that develop a radiative core have a rapidly - changing interior structure constant between the age of 10 and 100  myr .",
    "this can be observed in figure  [ fig : k2age](a ) .",
    "as the convection zone recedes , the central regions of the collapsing pre - ms star create a more centrally - concentrated mass profile , lowering the derived value of @xmath30 .",
    "the result is that the value of @xmath30 decreases by about 5% ",
    "10% every 10  myr for masses above 0.45  @xmath62 .",
    "masses below approximately 0.45  @xmath62 undergo variations up to about 5% .",
    "this period of rapid contraction continues until a small convective core develops , producing a star with three energy transfer zones : a convective core , a radiative shell , and a convective outer envelope .",
    "the star settles onto the ms once the small convective core subsides with the equilibration of @xmath75he burning . in figure",
    "[ fig : k2age ] , this process is manifested by the upward turn of the mass tracks near 100  myr , followed by a flattening of @xmath30 as the star enters the ms .    after first developing a small radiative core on the pre - ms , stars with masses between 0.29  @xmath62 and 0.35  @xmath62 eventually maintain a fully - convective interior ( see figure  [ fig : k2age](b ) ) .",
    "these small radiative cores manifest themselves as small dips in the evolution of @xmath30 , just as for stars that maintain a radiative core on the ms . while the rate of change in @xmath30 is rapid during the core contraction , the relative change in @xmath30 with stellar age is small ( @xmath76 ) .",
    "it is evident from figure  [ fig : k2age](b ) that near the fully - convective transition , stars that eventually end up with fully - convective interiors exhibit a degeneracy in the age-@xmath30 plane .",
    "there is no differentiating between their pre - ms core contraction and the eventual reduction of the radiative shell using @xmath30 alone .",
    "below 0.29  @xmath62 , a radiative core does not develop on the pre - ms .",
    "additional models were generated to investigate the effect of specific stellar properties on the predicted values of @xmath30 . in figures  [ fig : k2prop](a)(f )",
    "we illustrate the results of changing the scaled - solar stellar metallicity , helium abundance ( @xmath77 ) , and the effects of artificially inflating and deflating the stellar radius . for this exercise ,",
    "two masses were selected to study the effects on the two broad categories of low - mass stars : fully - convective stars and stars with radiative cores .",
    "it is apparent from figure  [ fig : k2prop ] that changes to the chemical composition have the largest effect on the value of the interior structure constant on the pre - ms .",
    "variations in metallicity of 0.2  dex translate into a 5% difference in the calculated @xmath30 for a 0.55 @xmath62 star at a given pre - ms age .",
    "similarly , large variations in the helium abundance have the ability to produce changes in @xmath30 at the 5% level .    without some prior knowledge of the stellar composition , the effects of such variations",
    "may be confused with a difference in stellar age .",
    "the effects on @xmath30 are lessened as mass decreases , until variations nearly vanish in the fully - convective regime ( panels ( d ) and ( e ) of figure  [ fig : k2prop ] ) .",
    "note that a change in @xmath77 pushes @xmath30 in the same direction in both mass regimes , whereas a change in metallicity produces a change in one direction for the radiative core case but the opposite direction in the fully - convective case . while this behavior does not lift the age - composition degeneracy entirely",
    ", it could prove a useful diagnostic in deb systems whose components straddle the fully - convective boundary .",
    "we attempted to mimic the possible effects of magnetic fields on the structure of our models by computing models at solar - metallicity with @xmath7 = 0.5 , 1 , and 3 .",
    "the modified mixing - length represents magnetic suppression of convection in the deep interior .",
    "additionally , models were run where we artificially changed the surface pressure by @xmath78% .",
    "the altered surface pressure represents the possible influence of star spots on the stellar photosphere .",
    "the magnetic dartmouth models @xcite were not used as they have yet to be evaluated for stars on the pre - ms .",
    "figures  [ fig : k2prop](c ) and [ fig : k2prop](f ) show how @xmath30 varies with changes to @xmath7 and the surface pressure . during the pre - ms contraction , a 20% change in the surface pressure results in a @xmath79% change to the stellar radius .",
    "the accompanying change in @xmath30 was found to be 0.2% and 1.0% , for a positive and negative change to the surface pressure , respectively . in the @xmath80 models , increasing @xmath7 to 3 yielded a stellar radius that was 2% smaller than our solar - calibrated model with @xmath30 variations under 1% throughout the star s pre - ms contraction .",
    "decreasing @xmath7 , however , produced larger variations in @xmath30 . at an age of 60",
    "myr the model radii appeared inflated by 5% and 15% for @xmath7 = 1.0 and 0.5 , respectively .",
    "the corresponding changes in @xmath30 were , respectively , 4% and 12% .",
    "panel ( f ) of figure  [ fig : k2prop ] indicates that the @xmath72 , fully - convective models experience the greatest differences at the youngest age and that these differences diminish until the different tracks converge on the ms .",
    "these changes to @xmath7 and surface pressure are for illustrative purposes only .",
    "it is not at all clear that simply reducing @xmath7 is a suitable approximation for the presence of an interior magnetic field nor that altering the surface pressure is a good approximation for star spots at the surface .      the rapid evolution of @xmath30 for a single star can provide an accurate age estimate for that star , but what about for a binary system ?",
    "we stated in section [ sec : isc ] that observations are only able to provide the weighted mean value of @xmath30 for two stars in a binary . to derive an age estimate for a binary system",
    ", we must find the theoretical @xmath81 .",
    "temporal evolution of the theoretical @xmath81 values can be obtained by combining two @xmath30 mass tracks using equation ( [ eq : k2w ] ) .",
    "computation of the @xmath34 coefficients requires precise knowledge of the stellar masses , radii , and the orbital eccentricity ( see equation ( [ eq : cs ] ) and note that @xmath21 becomes irrelevant ) .",
    "the angular velocity term in equation ( [ eq : cs ] ) can either be measured or approximated using the orbital eccentricity , assuming pseudo - synchronization @xcite , @xmath82 hence our reason for focusing on debs : they can yield precise estimates of the stellar and orbital properties .",
    "the evolution of @xmath81 is simplest for an equal mass binary . in this case , both stars contribute equally to @xmath81 , meaning the @xmath81 track is exactly equal to the two individual @xmath30 tracks .",
    "the discussion from section  [ sec : res_1 ] on single star tracks would then apply to the binary system .",
    "a binary with unequal mass components is not so simple .",
    "two mass tracks are required  one computed for the mass of each star  and must be combined as a single track using equation  ( [ eq : k2w ] ) . how does this effect our ability to extract an age estimate ?",
    "we have provided an example of a weighted @xmath30 evolutionary track in figure  [ fig : binary ] .",
    "the masses selected are those of the two stars presented in figure  [ fig : k2prop ] , @xmath83 and @xmath84 .",
    "for this example , we arbitrarily adopted an orbit with an eccentricity @xmath85 .",
    "weighting of the theoretical @xmath30 values is insensitive to the semi - major axis .",
    "the stellar radii ( @xmath86 and @xmath87 ) were selected from a solar metallicity mass track at an age of 40 myr . to simulate the type of data available to an observer",
    ", we elected to fix the radius , and thus , fix the @xmath88 coefficients ( used to weight the value of @xmath30 ) at each age in figure  [ fig : binary ] .",
    "the rapid evolution of @xmath30 that is taking place in the @xmath89 star largely dominates the relatively slow @xmath30 evolution of the @xmath90 star . while the weighted @xmath30 value for the binary does not evolve as rapidly as for a single @xmath89 star , the weighted value still changes by about 5% every 10 myr",
    "this is comparable to models of single stars and should not significantly hinder any age analysis .",
    "debs provide an excellent laboratory for testing stellar structure and evolution theory in different mass and evolutionary regimes .",
    "the mass - radius plane is the strictest test of stellar models because these two quantities are best constrained by the observations @xcite .",
    "results from studies performing such comparisons have led to the consensus that standard stellar evolution models are unable to accurately reproduce the observed stellar radii for masses below @xmath91 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the model inaccuracies are particularly evident among pre - ms binaries @xcite .",
    "radius discrepancies of approximately 10  15% are routinely quoted between pre - ms debs and models .",
    "this makes it difficult to derive an age with less than 50% uncertainty from stellar positions in the mass - radius plane .",
    "magnetic effects , particularly surface spots , are thought to belie the observed radius deviations .",
    "canonical stellar evolution models are non - magnetic and are therefore unable to properly account for magnetic modifications to convective energy transport and for the presence of magnetic spots on the stellar photosphere .",
    "we therefore advocate the inclusion of the interior structure constant , @xmath81 , to overcome these age determination inaccuracies whenever possible .",
    "while this study does not lead to us to conclude that individual @xmath30 values ( and thus @xmath81 ) are entirely insensitive to magnetic activity in low - mass stars , it is evident that @xmath81 has the potential to be a better diagnostic of the pre - ms evolutionary state than the stellar radius when surface magnetic activity is present .",
    "for instance , setting @xmath92 increases the radius and @xmath30 of a single star by 15% and 12% , respectively .",
    "fixing the radius to determine an age leads to an age that is upward of 180% greater than if we assume a solar calibrated @xmath7 . on the other hand , fixing @xmath30 leads to only a 20% greater age .",
    "the age errors are then compounded when we consider both stars in the binary .",
    "the decreased sensitivity of the individual @xmath30 values makes the mean @xmath81 a superior choice compared to surface quantities like the radius and effective temperature .",
    "the age precision returned from observational determinations of @xmath81 is dependent on the precision with which the observational @xmath81 and the system s metallicity are known .",
    "for example , given an equal mass binary with 0.5  @xmath93 stars , knowing @xmath81 with 5% uncertainty and the metallicity to @xmath94  dex yields a pre - ms age with an uncertainty of approximately 33% .",
    "constraining the metallicity uncertainty to @xmath950.1  dex improves this age uncertainty to 20% .",
    "furthermore , to obtain an age with 5% precision would require @xmath81 to be measured with near 1% precision for a metallicity known to within 0.1  dex .",
    "the results presented and discussed above show that it is possible to precisely derive the age of a binary system from measurements of apsidal motion .",
    "however , obtaining precise observations of apsidal motion and measuring @xmath81 with 5% precision is a painstaking task .",
    "the binary system must meet several criteria and the data must be of high quality .",
    "foremost is that the binary _ must _ be a double - lined , eclipsing system .",
    "while this has been alluded to , we have yet to illuminate precisely why this is so .",
    "the reason for requiring a deb stems from the need for extremely accurate and precise stellar and orbital properties .",
    "equations ( [ eq : ap ] ) and ( [ eq : cs ] ) reveal that derivation of @xmath81 requires exquisite knowledge of the stellar mass ratio , the stellar radii , and the orbital properties ( eccentricity and semi - major axis ) . only data from debs",
    "can provide these quantities in a ( nearly ) model - independent fashion @xcite .",
    "a meticulous examination of the binary light curve and radial velocity curve is of the utmost importance .",
    "the light curve must be assembled from multi - epoch , time - series differential photometry and must provide nearly complete phase coverage .",
    "this latter feature is essential .",
    "not only must the primary and secondary eclipses be captured , but also the behavior of the light curve out of eclipse .",
    "such data is becoming increasingly available with the latest generation of photometric surveys ( e.g. , _ kepler _ , corot , superwasp ) and those to come ( e.g. , lsst , brite constellation mission ) .",
    "similar to the photometry , a large number of high dispersion , high signal - to - noise spectra are needed to construct a detailed radial velocity curve .",
    "attempts must be made to provide adequate phase coverage ( see * ? ? ? * ) and uncover deviations due to the rossiter - mclaughlin effect @xcite for reasons we shall discuss momentarily .",
    "@xcite points out that the spectroscopy is still the limiting factor of quality in deb analyses .    only with the quality of data described above and within @xcite and @xcite",
    "can a truly adequate analysis of a deb be performed .",
    "however , acquisition of data of such quality is very rewarding and allows for a rigorous examination and characterization of the stellar system .",
    "it would permit the measurement of the stellar masses and radii with extreme precision ( below 2% ) .",
    "this is imperative considering that equation ( [ eq : cs ] ) depends upon the fractional radii @xmath96 to the 5@xmath97 power .",
    "additionally , actual measurement of @xmath98 requires careful monitoring of eclipse times of minimum .",
    "this can only be performed if one has a densely populated light curve .",
    "the data would also permit measurement of the binary eccentricity and semi - major axis with high precision .",
    "these properties affect both equation ( [ eq : cs ] ) and the general relativistic contribution discussed in section  [ sec : isc ] @xcite . recall that the contribution from the latter must be removed from the total apsidal motion rate to derive the classical contribution given in equation ( [ eq : ap ] ) .",
    "detailed radial velocity curves not only provide accurate mass and eccentricity estimates , but may also be used to investigate the inclination of the system .",
    "the theory presented in section [ sec : isc ] relies on the assumption that the rotational axes of the two stars be parallel to one another and perpendicular to the orbital plane .",
    "it is possible to evaluate this restriction by using the rossiter - mclaughlin effect in a manner similar to that presented for di her @xcite .",
    "a detailed radial velocity curve may , additionally , betray the presence of a third body .",
    "the presence of a tertiary may affect the binary orbit , altering the derived apsidal motion .",
    "one added benefit is that lengthy observations may help to identify  and thus correct for  the impact of star spots and magnetic activity on the eclipse profiles .",
    "star spots have the ability to distort the light curve , which can diminish the accuracy of the derived stellar properties @xcite .",
    "removing the effects of spots is critical to obtain not only precise but also accurate stellar properties .",
    "the easiest means of obtaining detailed time - series photometry is through space - based satellites , such as corot and _",
    "kepler_. however , long - term ground - based observational efforts are beginning to produce apsidal motion detections ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , demonstrating that it is feasible to carry out the necessary observations using ground - based telescopes .",
    "finally , by acquiring a large number of quality spectra , it may be possible to extract the projected rotational velocities ( @xmath99 ) and a modest estimate of the chemical composition .",
    "spectroscopic determinations of cool star metallicities is notoriously complicated , but most pre - ms debs will likely reside near or in a cluster from which metallicity estimates can be extracted using the higher mass stellar population . in the event there is no known association from which to draw a metallicity , techniques based on low- and medium - resolution spectra are encouraging ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) . while the validity of such techniques along the pre - ms is unclear",
    ", they provide a viable starting point and typically produce metallicities with uncertainties below @xmath100 dex , the limit we recommend .",
    "the usefulness of @xmath81 as an age estimator is limited to the pre - ms , in particular , during the evolutionary phase where the radiative core is rapidly contracting .",
    "this typically corresponds to an age between 10  myr and 100  myr ( see figure  [ fig : k2age ] ) . at the 5  10 % measurement level , this technique is also restricted to binaries where one of the stars has a mass above @xmath1010.40  @xmath62 .",
    "this restriction ensures the radiative core contraction and relative change in @xmath30 for the more massive star is rapid enough to dominate the theoretical @xmath81 evolution .",
    "reducing the observational uncertainty in @xmath81 below 5% enables a more accurate age estimate and would allow for debs with lower mass components to be reliably analyzed .",
    "precise measures of apsidal motion and metallicity are challenging to obtain , but are already feasible and should only improve over time . instead of observational limitations , the greatest limiting factor for using @xmath81 as",
    "an age indicator is the circularization of the deb orbit .",
    "mutual tidal interactions will circularize binary orbits over time @xcite .",
    "apsidal motion requires an elliptical orbit .",
    "if an equal - mass binary is to maintain an elliptical orbit for the duration of its pre - ms contraction , the orbital period must be at least 2.4 days @xcite .",
    "the probability of discovering an elliptical binary decreases with time , but this provides an additional consistency check .",
    "the age suggested by @xmath81 should not be significantly older than the orbital circularization timescale .",
    "finally , the age estimate is only as accurate as the stellar models . verifying that a given stellar model produces the proper mass distribution , hence @xmath30 , may at first seem rather unreasonable . however , at least one known system , with the possibility of a second (; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , is capable of providing validation of the physics incorporated in low - mass stellar evolution models . @xcite",
    "have indicated that by the end of the nominal _ kepler _ mission , they will know the interior structure constants of b and c with about 1% precision .",
    "interior structure constants known with this precision can place stringent constraints on the equation of state of the stellar plasma @xcite .",
    "the veracity of low - mass models , and therefore the validity of their predicted interior structure constants , may be assessed according to the results from koi-126 and similar systems .",
