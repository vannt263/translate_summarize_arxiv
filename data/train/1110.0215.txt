    "the information theoretic way of approaching a communication network design is usually guided by the assumption that users data buffers are always full .",
    "this assumption greatly simplifies the problem and hence enables a rigorous systematic way to study networks .",
    "however , this assumption ignores the bursty nature of real sources and delay considerations , leading to the so - called unconsummated union between information theory and communication networks @xcite .    in @xcite for multi - access channel ( mac ) , we considered a periodic source arrival model , where a new block of data of fixed size arrives every @xmath0 channel uses .",
    "therefore , during each channel block , user s data buffer is not to be replenished by an infinite data reservoir and hence the usual full - buffer assumption is no longer valid .",
    "the actual number of channel uses that each user takes to finish its transmission is termed as _ completion time_. an information theoretic framework of studying completion time was proposed in @xcite for mac . in this paper , we extend the framework to incorporate two important classes of multi - user channels , the broadcast channel ( bc ) and interference channel ( ic ) and study the completion time .",
    "consider the following live video streaming communication scenario as a motivating example . in a multi - user channel , suppose each user wants to either transmit or receive a video stream that is compressed at fixed , but possibly different , rate .",
    "specifically , in the bc setup a common transmitter streams two video sequences to their respective users . in the ic setup , two users stream videos to their respective receivers .",
    "the data arrives periodically . in the beginning of each period",
    ", there will be a certain number of bits to be received at or transmitted by each user .",
    "however due to the casuality constraint , after the completion of the current transmission , new data will not be immediately available until the next period .",
    "we model this as the follows : user @xmath1 , @xmath2 , has @xmath3 bits , with @xmath4 corresponding to the compression rate and @xmath5 corresponding to the number of source samples , to be transmitted in at most @xmath0 channel uses , where @xmath0 is assumed to be large enough to allow both transmissions to complete .",
    "let @xmath6 be the actual number of channel uses that user @xmath1 spends on communication .",
    "the performance metric is _ normalized completion time _",
    "( referred as completion time hereafter ) within a single channel block , which is defined as @xmath7 in the limit of large @xmath8 and @xmath5 .",
    "note that in the streaming example , @xmath5 corresponds to the number of source samples , which is assumed to be the same for both users .",
    "in general we can view @xmath5 as a scaling factor to ensure information theoretic arguments with large block lengths can be invoked .",
    "the exact value of @xmath5 is not important since it will not appear in the characterization of completion time .",
    "the main contributions of this paper are the extension of the information theoretic formulation of completion time , originally proposed in @xcite for mac , to bc and ic and , for the gaussian case , the explicit characterization of the completion time region or inner and outer bounds .",
    "specifically , for gic in the very strong interference regime , the ctr can be derived directly since gic reduces into two point - to - point links . for gic in the strong interference regime , because the capacity region is in the form of gaussian mac ( gmac ) , the derivation of the ctr parallels that in @xcite . for gic in the weak and mixed interference regimes , an achievable ctr based on the etkin - tse - wang scheme @xcite and",
    "an outer - bound are obtained . toward this end , we adopt the approach used in @xcite , but generalize the techniques for an arbitrary convex rate region whose boundaries are given by piece - wise linear functions . as for gbc , we adopt a different approach to establish the converse , where the ctr outer - bound is directly obtained by defining a mapping between rate pairs and completion time pairs .",
    "we then proceed further to prove the non - convexity of the ctr of gbc by making use of the solution of the weighted sum completion time minimization problem",
    ".    note that in @xcite , the sum completion time minimization problem for a @xmath9-user symmetric gmac was studied . compared to @xcite",
    ", our result provides a more general formulation for the two - user case , allowing us to consider a variety of utility functions over the ctr , e.g. weighted sum completion time . for gic",
    ", the authors in @xcite studied the problem of minimizing some convex cost function over the ctr obtained by treating interference as noise , whereas in this paper we adopt an information theoretic approach without restricting decoding strategies to treating interference as noise .",
    "this paper is organized as the follows . in section",
    "ii , we define constrained rates for discrete memoryless bc and ic respectively , based on which an information theoretic formulation of completion time is then given . in section iii , we derive the ctr for gbc . in section iv , we discuss the ctr for gic case by case . the paper is concluded in section v.    _ notation",
