    "from the mathematical point of view there is a very interesting canonically defined neighborhood @xmath22 of the 0-section of the cotangent bundle @xmath23 of the associated symmetric space @xmath24 . in the terminology of @xcite , to which we refer for background",
    ", it is called the _ universal domain _ associated to @xmath2 . its importance in representation theory , where it is most often called the _ crown of the symmetric space _ , has been underlined in numerous works . in the case at hand , where @xmath2 is of hermitian type ,",
    "this is @xmath2-equivariantly and holomorphically isomorphic to the product @xmath25 of the associated hermitian bounded domain and its complex conjugate @xmath26 ( @xcite ) .",
    "it should be noted that @xmath27 and @xmath28 are biholomorphically equivalent as complex manifolds , but are not @xmath2-equivariantly biholomorphic .      in order to emphasize the concrete nature of this situation",
    "let us provide a sketch of some basic information about the hermitian symmetric space @xmath27 ( see , e.g. , @xcite for details ) .",
    "a symmetric space is simply a ( finite - dimensional ) riemannian manifold @xmath29 with the additional property that at every @xmath30 there exists an isometry @xmath31 which is a symmetry at @xmath32 in the sense that @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "one shows that the connected component of the identity of the isometry group is a lie group @xmath2 which acts transitively on @xmath35 and that the isotropy subgroup at a neutral point under consideration is a compact subgroup @xmath17 .",
    "based on curvature conditions and canonical decompositions of lie groups , symmetric spaces break up into products of symmetric spaces of three irreducible types .",
    "one such type is @xmath24 where @xmath2 is a simple ( real ) noncompact lie group and @xmath17 is a ( unique up to conjugation ) maximal compact subgroup . in some cases these symmetric spaces @xmath35 have the structure of a complex manifold such that the group @xmath2 acts as a group of holomorphic transformations",
    ". this situation can be group - theorectically characterized by the condition that @xmath17 has a positive - dimensional center which in fact turns out to be @xmath36 . in this case",
    "the metric can be chosen to be hermitian and therefore one refers to @xmath35 as a hermitian symmetric space and @xmath2 being of hermitian type .",
    "note that the maximal compact subgroup @xmath20 of @xmath37 satifies this condition .",
    "noncompact hermitian symmetric spaces of the type discussed above are naturally realized as distinguished open @xmath2-orbits in compact hermitian symmetric spaces @xmath38 which are referred to as the compact duals of the noncompact hermitian symmetric spaces .",
    "a simple example is the case where @xmath39 acts on the space @xmath40 of lines in @xmath41 . here",
    "an associated symmetric space is the open @xmath2-orbit of negative lines . in general",
    "there are always exactly two @xmath2-invariant complex structures on a hermitian symmetric space . in this case",
    "the `` other '' structure is space of positive @xmath21-planes in @xmath42 .    using a precise description of the action of the complex lie group @xmath43 on @xmath38 ,",
    "one observes that the noncompact hermitian symmetric space is contained as a bounded domain in a canonically determined ( dense ) open subset of @xmath38 which is biholomorphically equivalent to @xmath44 where @xmath45 .",
    "conversely , every ( irreducible ) bounded domain @xmath46 in @xmath44 which is symmetric with respect to holomorphic symmetries arises in this way . in our case",
    "we may view the hermitian symmetric spaces @xmath27 and @xmath26 as open @xmath2-orbits in the space @xmath38 of lagrangian subspaces of @xmath47 , where @xmath48 is the standard ( holomorphic ) symplectic structure .    as a complex manifold @xmath49",
    "can also be @xmath2-equivariantly realized as a @xmath2-invariant open neighborhood of the ( totally real ) orbit @xmath50 of the neutral point in the affine symmetric space @xmath51 . as mentioned above",
    ", it is @xmath2-equivariantly identifiable with a neighborhood of the 0-section in @xmath23 .",
    "these identifications allow us to consider natural @xmath2-invariant symplectic structures on @xmath5 and the resulting moment maps @xmath52 .",
    "the most obvious of these are the restriction to @xmath5 of the canonical symplectic structure on @xmath23 and structures of the type @xmath53 , where @xmath54 is a strictly plurisubharmonic @xmath2-exhaustion of @xmath5 defined , e.g. , by representation theory .",
    "one can show that with respect to any of these structures the generic @xmath2-orbits are coisotropic , i.e. , that the @xmath55-fibers are contained in the @xmath2-orbits .",
    "thus an associated moment map @xmath56 transports a setting of geometric and representation importance to its image @xmath57 in an optimally controllable way .",
    "our goal is to construct bosonic ensembles by equipping such an image with @xmath56-direct image measures .",
    "however , for the symplectic structures mentioned above , @xmath57 is never contained in @xmath3 .",
    "the fact that this happens , which was initially surprising to us , should be further investigated . here , however , we move to a slightly different complex geometric situation by implementing the @xmath2-equivariant complex conjugation @xmath58 and thereby redefining @xmath59 .",
    "thus we still have the advantage of the symplectic geometry and representation theory of the original setup .",
    "in addition , in this new situation the moment map @xmath56 associated to any @xmath2-invariant khlerian structure on @xmath5 satisfies @xmath60 .",
    "furthermore , @xmath56 is generically an open map and consequently its image is not pathological .",
    "the discussion of the @xmath56-images , both before and after complex conjugation , is contained in @xmath61 .    in the following section we compute @xmath56 for a particularly beautiful symplectic structure on the product @xmath62 , where @xmath63 is the unit disk in the complex plane .",
    "here we use the identification of @xmath2 with @xmath64 .",
    "this is certainly a toy model .",
    "however , the bounded domain @xmath27 contains a ( flat ) r - dimensional complex polydisk @xmath65 defined by a choice of a maximal ( abelian ) subalgebra @xmath66 in the @xmath67-part of a cartan decomposition @xmath68 such that @xmath69 . therefore certain results can be immediately carried over to @xmath27 by arguing one variable at a time in @xmath65 . on the other hand ,",
    "our goal of understanding asymptotic information concerning spectral invariants is of course not touched here .",
    "nevertheless we do indicate how to compute the distribution function of the eigenvalue @xmath70 with @xmath71 , and we compute this explicitly in the concrete case of the direct image of the uniform measure .",
    "define the mixed signature hermitian form @xmath73 on @xmath74 by @xmath75 and denote by @xmath76 its group of complex linear isometries . as usual @xmath77 .",
    "the group has exactly three orbits on the projective space @xmath78 : @xmath79 $ ] , @xmath80 $ ] and the real projective space @xmath81 $ ] .",
    "note that the involution @xmath82 , @xmath83\\mapsto [ \\bar{z}_2:\\bar { z}_1]$ ] defines a @xmath2-equivariant , antiholomorphic isomorphism @xmath84 .    for moment - map considerations it is convenient to define the symmetric bilinear form @xmath85 by @xmath86 which is invariant under the adjoint representation of @xmath2 .",
    "using the duality defined by @xmath87 we will regard the moment map as having image in @xmath88 .",
    "we will use the following @xmath87-orthogonal basis of @xmath88 : @xmath89 if a moment map with values in @xmath90 is given by @xmath91 , then the corresponding map with values in @xmath88 is given by @xmath92 .      here",
    "we make two observations which make a case for considering the @xmath93 instead of @xmath25 as the appropriate phase space .    [ negative ] the image of a moment map @xmath94 which is defined either by the restricted coadjoint structure or by a khler form @xmath95 of a @xmath2-invariant potential is contained in the complement of the cone @xmath3 of elliptic elements .    for a complementary statement for @xmath62",
    "we denote by @xmath96 the augmentation of either the positive or negative cone of elliptic elements by adding @xmath97 .",
    "[ positive ] the image of a moment map @xmath98 which is defined by a khler form @xmath95 of a @xmath2-invariant potential is contained in an augmented cone @xmath99 with the diagonal being mapped to @xmath100 and the complement of the diagonal being mapped to the component of @xmath3 which is contained in @xmath96 .",
    "it should be noted that these observations can be translated to the higher dimensional setting by using strongly orthogonal roots and the polydisk slice mentioned above .    turning to the proofs of these remarks",
    ", we first note that in the case where the khler form is defined by an invariant potential , an associated moment map is given by @xmath101 here @xmath102 is the complex structure and @xmath103 denotes the vector field on the manifold which is associated to @xmath104 .",
    "recall that since @xmath2 is semisimple , the moment map is the unique equivariant map to @xmath90 with the hamiltonian property @xmath105 .",
    "of course @xmath106 is tangent to the level sets of the invariant function @xmath54 and the moment map is measuring how @xmath54 is growing along @xmath107 .",
    "in this situation it is therefore important to determine the complex tangent spaces @xmath108 of the @xmath54-level sets .",
    "assuming @xmath109 , this cauchy - riemann tangent space is the 1-codimensional maximal complex subspace of the ( real ) tangent space @xmath110 .",
    "_ proof of proposition [ negative]_. let @xmath111 be the base point so that @xmath112 is the unique symmetric space orbit in @xmath113 . in the standard",
    "homogeneous coordinates this is defined by @xmath114 .",
    "choose @xmath115 to be spanned by the matrix @xmath116 above .",
    "let @xmath117 be the image of the half - open interval @xmath118 by the map @xmath119 .",
    "then @xmath117 is an exact slice for the @xmath2-action on @xmath120 ( see @xcite for this and other background used here . ) .",
    "this means that every @xmath2-orbit intersects @xmath117 in exactly one point .",
    "the orbits @xmath121 for @xmath122 are real hypersurfaces .",
    "the complex tangent spaces @xmath123 are calculated in a general setting in @xcite ( see p. 103 ) . applying this to the case at hand ,",
    "we observe that these spaces are spanned by @xmath124 and @xmath125 where @xmath126 spans the @xmath127 root - space defined by @xmath116 and @xmath128 is the cartan involution . in concrete terms @xmath129 and @xmath130 .",
    "as we have seen above , it follows that @xmath131 .",
    "it follows that @xmath132 is contained in the @xmath116-axis where all isotropy groups are noncompact .",
    "in particular , the image of @xmath56 is contained in the complement of @xmath117 .",
    "it remains to prove the same result for the restriction of the canonical symplectic structure on @xmath23 .",
    "recall that in this case @xmath56 is defined by the liouville form @xmath133 ; in particular , @xmath134 . however , if @xmath135 is the canonical projection , then @xmath136 and consequently @xmath137 for all @xmath138 .",
    "thus again we observe that @xmath139 has empty intersection with @xmath3 .",
    "_ proof of proposition [ positive]_. here we use the slice @xmath117 which is defined as the image of the half - open interval @xmath140 by the mapping @xmath141 in the affine coordinates @xmath142 corresponding to @xmath143 , [ 1:w])$ ] in @xmath144 .",
    "the base point for these considerations is @xmath145 .",
    "just as above we compute the complex tangent space @xmath123 of an orbit @xmath146 for @xmath147 . for this",
    "observe that in this case @xmath32 is in the open @xmath148-orbit in @xmath38 .",
    "therefore the complex tangent space @xmath149 can be represented as the quotient space @xmath150 , where @xmath151 is the ( complex ) lie algebra of the @xmath148-isotropy group at @xmath32 .",
    "we note that this is conjugate to the subgroup of diagonal matrices in @xmath152 .",
    "a direct calculation ( see @xcite p. 74 ) shows that @xmath151 consists of those matrices of the form @xmath153 it is then immediate that @xmath116 and @xmath154 are linearly dependent modulo @xmath151 when regarded as elements of @xmath155 .",
    "thus the real subspace of @xmath149 which is generated by @xmath156 and @xmath157 is a complex line which by dimension arguments _ is _ the complex tangent space @xmath123 .    finally , by exactly the same argument as in the proof of the previous theorem it follows that @xmath158 for all @xmath159 .",
    "since @xmath160 , it follows that @xmath161 .",
    "since @xmath100 is necessarily a critical point of @xmath54 , it follows that @xmath162 .",
    "standard computations of @xmath163 show that @xmath164 for @xmath147 and the desired result follows .",
    "actually we proved more than was stated in the above proposition . for future reference we state this here .",
    "* zusatz*. _ the image @xmath165 is contained in the @xmath166-axis @xmath167 . _",
    "here we let @xmath168 be the distance function defined by the poincar metric on @xmath63 .",
    "we temporarily remove the diagonal from @xmath5 where @xmath169 is no longer smooth , show that @xmath169 is strictly plurisubharmonic so that @xmath170 is a @xmath2-invariant khler form and compute the restriction to the slice @xmath117 of the resulting moment map .",
    "as would be expected this map can be ( continuously ) extended to @xmath5 with the diagonal being mapped to @xmath100 .",
    "it is convenient to change coordinates on @xmath5 , letting @xmath172 and @xmath173 where @xmath142 are the affine coordinates which are used above .",
    "thus the complex disk @xmath174 contains the slice @xmath117 as a radius .",
    "in particular @xmath175 is transversal to the @xmath2-orbit of any point @xmath147 . note that @xmath175 is invariant by the diagonal @xmath176-action defined by the element @xmath104 .",
    "it therefore follows that a function @xmath177 on @xmath175 is strictly plurisubharmonic if and only if @xmath178 is strictly convex .",
    "let us begin with this step which of course requires an explicit computation with @xmath179 .",
    "if @xmath180 is the schwarz distance function , then @xmath181 since @xmath182 is strictly convex , in order to prove the following it is enough to show that @xmath178 is strictly convex where @xmath177 is the restriction of @xmath183 to @xmath175 .",
    "the restriction of @xmath179 to @xmath175 is strongly subharmonic .    using the obvious coordinates , @xmath184    now we turn to the `` other '' direction , namely the coordinate @xmath185 . for this at each point of @xmath175",
    "we consider the complex curve @xmath186 defined by @xmath187 .    near @xmath188",
    "the pullback @xmath189 is nonnegative with @xmath190 and @xmath191 otherwise .",
    "furthermore , @xmath192    as above it is enough to prove the positivity for @xmath179 replaced by @xmath183 .",
    "this is equivalent to @xmath193 for @xmath194 sufficiently small and nonzero .",
    "this is done by elementary manipulations ( see @xcite , p.66 - 7 ) .",
    "one can also prove ( [ positivity ] ) by making several estimates ( also see @xcite , p. 67 ) , but this can be proved in a more conceptual way : since the curve @xmath186 touches the @xmath179 level set from outside , it is immediate that @xmath195 .",
    "if this derivative vanished at @xmath32 , then the levi - form restricted to the complex tangent bundle of the orbit @xmath196 would vanish identically .",
    "it would then follow that @xmath196 would be foliated by complex curves .",
    "this is for numerous reasons impossible , e.g. , continuously moving the leaf through @xmath32 away from @xmath32 so that it no longer intersects the curve @xmath186 yields a contradiction to hurwitz s theorem .",
    "the poincar distance function is plurisubharmonic on @xmath5 and is strictly plurisubharmonic outside of the diagonal .",
    "the above two lemmas show that @xmath197 at every point of @xmath198 .",
    "the fact that the curves @xmath186 are tangent to the @xmath179-level sets at every point of @xmath198 implies that @xmath199 vanishes along @xmath175 and therefore the mixed derivatives @xmath200 vanish identically there as well . in other words",
    "the full complex hessian is diagonalized along @xmath198 with positive entries along the diagonal .",
    "since @xmath179 is only continuous along the diagonal of @xmath5 , to show that it is plurisubharmonic there , we must prove that if @xmath201 is holomorphic with @xmath202 , then @xmath203 is subharmonic .",
    "if the image of @xmath204 is contained in the diagonal , then this is just the identically zero function .",
    "otherwise we may assume that @xmath100 is the only point of the diagonal in the image and the result follows from the plurisubharmonicity of @xmath179 outside the diagonal and that , since @xmath205 , the mean value property is fulfilled at @xmath100 .      to keep the notation straight",
    "let @xmath206 denote the slice @xmath117 in @xmath5 .",
    "the sign of the moment map chosen so that its image is contained in the augmented cone @xmath96 , where @xmath3 is the positive cone defined as @xmath207 where @xmath208 . by the above _ zusatz _ we know that @xmath209 . since @xmath210 and @xmath211 are slices for the respective @xmath2-actions , for our purposes here it is enough to have an explicit description of the _ restricted moment map _ @xmath212 .",
    "this amounts to a description of the function @xmath213 along @xmath206 .",
    "if @xmath175 is parameterized by @xmath214 and the ordered basis @xmath215 is used for @xmath88 , then @xmath216    in this parameterization the restriction of the poincar distance funtion to @xmath175 is given by @xmath217 by definition @xmath218 and the desired result follows by a direct computation of the derivative .",
    "the moment map @xmath219 is surjective .",
    "the diagonal in @xmath5 is the @xmath55-preimage of the vertex and the restriction of @xmath56 to the complement of the diagonal is a proper @xmath176-bundle .",
    "furthermore , @xmath56 has the coisotropic property that @xmath220 for all @xmath221 .",
    "let us conclude this note by explicitly computing the spectral density for the direct image measure @xmath4 on @xmath222 defined by the uniform measure @xmath126 on @xmath5 .",
    "it appears that other natural densities , e.g. , those related to gaussian type distributions will only be numerically computable . closed form descriptions of the behaviour of these at the vertex of the cone should be possible .",
    "note here that the matrices on the slice @xmath211 are of the form @xmath223 with @xmath224 .",
    "the relevant distribution is therefore @xmath225 .",
    "we will sketch the explicit computation of @xmath226 here , referring to @xcite for details .",
    "the mapping @xmath227 is given by @xmath228 .",
    "let @xmath229 be the corresponding inverse value .",
    "thus @xmath230 is the euclidean volume of the region @xmath231 .",
    "we compute this via fiber integration using the projection @xmath232 on the first coordinate . for @xmath233 let @xmath234 be the euclidean area of the fiber @xmath235 so that up to a constant @xmath236 let us begin by computing @xmath237 .      since the projection @xmath242 is @xmath2-equivariant , @xmath238 is a region in the @xmath240-fiber which is bounded by an orbit of the @xmath2-isotropy group at @xmath100 in the @xmath240-image space . since this isotropy group is acting on the fiber by rotations ,",
    "this is a disk . now",
    "the region @xmath243 in @xmath175 has the point @xmath244 on its boundary .",
    "thus if we apply the tranformation @xmath245 with @xmath246 then @xmath247 is mapped to the point @xmath248 which is on the boundary of the disk in question and the desired result follows .",
    "since we are only dealing with the uniform measure on @xmath5 , it follows that @xmath249 now @xmath250 is the image of the disk @xmath251 by the transformation @xmath252 . since @xmath252 preserves the poincar metric , this is a hyperbolic disk , i.e. , a disk with respect to @xmath179 .",
    "but hyperbolic disks are euclidean disks .",
    "thus , @xmath253 where @xmath254 is the euclidean radius of @xmath250 which we now compute .    by rotational invariance",
    "it is enough to compute @xmath255 for @xmath256 on the positive real axis of @xmath63 .",
    "thus the transformation @xmath257 stabilizes the interval @xmath258 of real points of @xmath63 .",
    "since @xmath258 is orthogonal to the boundary of @xmath251 and @xmath257 is conformal , it follows that @xmath258 is orthogonal to the boundary of @xmath259 .",
    "consequently , the length of @xmath260 is the diameter of @xmath259 .",
    "this leads to the following fact .      introducing polar coordinates and using rotational symmetry",
    ", one shows that @xmath263 for @xmath264 as above .",
    "this integral can actually be computed in closed form : @xmath265 using the simple dilation @xmath266 to clean up the numbers , one computes that @xmath267 thus one has a rather simple closed form description of the distribution function @xmath226 and the associated density @xmath177 .    in the variable",
    "@xmath266 the eigenvalue distribution function @xmath226 and its density @xmath177 associated to the direct image of the uniform measure by the poincar moment map @xmath219 are given by @xmath268 and @xmath269        near @xmath100 one has the power series representation @xmath270 in particular @xmath271 near @xmath100 .",
    "for @xmath272 the expression in the above proposition implies that @xmath273 .",
    "the expected value @xmath274 can actually be explicitly computed as @xmath275 . however , as one observes from the estimate of @xmath177 near @xmath276 the second moment @xmath277 is infinite .",
    "this phenomena does occur in nature , but here it is probably due to the fact that the original uniform measure on the phase space @xmath5 is physically unrealistic .",
    "gaussian densities , e.g. , of the type @xmath278 would perhaps be of greater interest , but the resulting integrals are more complicated .",

    "<S> calculations are carried out in what might seem to be a toy model , i.e. , the case of @xmath6 . due to the fact that we are dealing with a group of hermitian type , where the poincar disk plays a fundamental role in understanding the associated symmetric space , this is an important special case in our future work . </S>"
