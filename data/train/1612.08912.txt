    "massive gravity , in which a graviton is assumed to have tiny but non - vanishing mass , has a rich and long story since a seminal paper by fierz and pauli ( fp )  @xcite . in particular , it was shown by van dam and veltman @xcite and zakharov  @xcite that the fp theory can not recover the general relativity by einstein in the massless limit . however , vainshtein showed in @xcite that non - linear extensions of fp theory might resolve the so - called van dam - veltman - zakharov ( vdvz ) discontinuity problem . unfortunately , boulware and deser ( bd ) claimed , shortly after the paper of vainshtein , in @xcite that a unexpected ghost might arise from the sixth mode of graviton in non - linear fp theory .",
    "therefore , building a non - linear but ghost - free massive gravity has been a great challenge to physicists for quite a long time . indeed , many attempts to build up a ghost - free non - linear massive gravity have been proposed , e.g. , in @xcite . however , most of them have not turned out to be successful approaches except a non - linear massive gravity constructed by de rham , gabadadze , and tolley ( drgt )  @xcite as a generalization of fp massive gravity . as a result",
    ", the most important property of the drgt theory is that it has been proved to be free of the bd ghost by different approaches whatever the form of reference ( or fiducial ) metric @xcite .",
    "consequently , many cosmological and physical aspects of the drgt theory have been investigated extensively .",
    "for example , the drgt theory has been expected to provide us an alternative solution to the cosmological constant problem associated with the expanding of our universe .",
    "black holes such as the schwarzschild , kerr , and charged black holes along with anisotropic metrics such as the bianchi type i metric have also been investigated in the context of drgt theory .",
    "more interestingly , the massive gravity and condensed matter theories have met each other in the so - called holographic massive gravity . for more detailed information",
    ", one can read a recent interesting review paper by de rham @xcite .",
    "along with the above investigations , many extensions of the non - linear massive gravity have also been carried out  @xcite .",
    "one of them is the massive bi - gravity ( or bi - metric gravity ) proposed by hassan and rosen  @xcite , which seems to be one of the most interesting generalizations of drgt theory due to the change that the reference metric is introduced to be fully dynamical as the physical one .",
    "note that the reference metric in the drgt theory has been fixed as a non - dynamical metric .",
    "along with the original ( nonlinear ) massive gravity , the massive bi - gravity has also been discussed extensively , see , for example , a recent interesting review paper  @xcite for more details .",
    "theoretically , inspired by the well - known higher dimensional theories , e.g. , the string and super - gravity theories , one could think of higher dimensional scenarios of both massive gravity and bi - gravity .",
    "however , we have observed that many published papers on massive ( bi-)gravity have focused only on four - dimensional spacetimes , in which only the first three graviton terms @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 exist . besides , there are a few papers discussing higher dimensional massive gravity and bi - gravity  @xcite .",
    "however , they have not studied particular metrics such as the well - known friedmann - lemaitre - robertson - walker  @xcite , bianchi type i  @xcite , and schwarzschild - tangherlini  @xcite metrics for higher dimensional scenarios of massive ( bi-)gravity . hence",
    ", we would like to investigate cosmological implications of both five - dimensional massive gravity and bi - gravity in @xcite .",
    "in particular , we are interested in examining whether the metrics mentioned above act as cosmological solutions of both five - dimensional massive gravity and bi - gravity . to do this , we first construct the graviton term @xmath3 , which vanishes in all four - dimensional spacetimes but does survive in any five- ( or higher ) dimensional one , by using the consequence of the cayley - hamilton theorem in algebra  @xcite . then , we derive and solve constraints equations associated with the existence of reference metric to calculate the value(s ) of massive graviton terms @xmath4 . finally , we solve the corresponding field equations of physical metric to get the desired cosmological solutions",
    ".    the present article will be regarded as a summary of investigations on both five - dimensional massive gravity and bi - gravity .",
    "it will be organized as follows .",
    "a short introduction of our study has been written in the section  [ sec1 ] .",
    "basic setup and simple cosmological solutions of five - dimensional massive ( bi-)gravity will be shown in the sections  [ sec2 ] and [ sec3 ] , respectively .",
    "finally , conclusions will be given in the section  [ sec4 ] .",

    "it is noted that unlike the physical metric the fiducial metric in the drgt massive gravity is non - dynamical .",
    "therefore , its field equations will be algebraic rather than differential",
    ". for detailed investigations on physical and cosmological aspects of the drgt theory , see an interesting review paper by de rham  @xcite .",
    "however , if we introduce the fiducial metric to be fully dynamical as the physical metric , we will have the corresponding extension of the drgt theory called a massive bi - gravity ( or bi - metric gravity ) , whose action is defined as follows  @xcite @xmath18 where @xmath19 , while @xmath20 and @xmath21 denote the corresponding ricci scalar of the physical metric @xmath14 and reference metric @xmath22 , respectively . additionally , @xmath23 is an effective planck mass defined as follows @xcite @xmath24 with @xmath25 and @xmath26 are two other planck masses of @xmath14 and @xmath22 , respectively .",
