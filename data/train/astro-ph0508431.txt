    "x - ray emission from spiral galaxies consists of several components including an active nucleus ( if present ) , extra - nuclear point x - ray sources , hot gas , supernova etc .",
    "many spiral galaxies contain a mildly or non - active nucleus and , in this case , the luminosity in the x - ray band is dominated by the emission from a few luminous off - nuclear point sources ( roberts & warwick 2000 ) .",
    "the brightest of these x - ray sources , with luminosities exceeding the eddington luminosity for a @xmath0 black hole , are defined as the ultra - luminous x - ray sources ( ulxs ) .",
    "these objects , which may sometimes individually outshine the rest of the galaxy , were first discovered in _ einstein _ observations ( fabbiano & trincheri 1987 ; fabbiano 1989 ) .",
    "later they were detected in large numbers by _ rosat _",
    "( colbert & mushotzky 1999 ; roberts & warwick 2000 ; colbert & ptak 2002 ) .",
    "the first detailed x - ray spectral characteristics of ulxs were revealed by _",
    "asca _ and demonstrated that most ulxs exhibit multicolor disk blackbody spectra with a ` high temperature ' similar to that observed from galactic x - ray binaries in their high state .",
    "some ulxs were also found to vary and make a transition , at lower luminosities , to power - law spectra , similar to the spectral transitions seen in many galactic xrbs . however , the observed x - ray flux of many ulxs implies ( assuming isotropic emission and eddington - luminosity limited systems ) black holes of @xmath16 .",
    "these masses are much larger than the measured masses of known galactic x - ray binaries or black holes ( gxrbs or gbhs ) and much lower than the measured masses of active galactic nuclei , thus making them candidates for intermediate - mass black holes ( imbhs ) .",
    "several models have been proposed to explain the high luminosities of ulxs .",
    "these include ( @xmath17 ) accreting imbhs with sub - eddington rates ( e.g. , colbert & mushotzky 1999 ) , ( @xmath18 ) xrbs with anisotropic emission ( king et al .",
    "2001 ) , ( @xmath19 ) beamed xrbs with relativistic jets directly pointing towards us i. e. , scaled down versions of blazars ( mirabel & rodriguez 1999 ) , and ( @xmath20 ) xrbs with super - eddington accretion rates ( begelman 2002 ) .",
    "a few ulxs have been found to be young supernova ( e.g. , sn  1979 , immler , pietsch & aschenbach 1998 ) with x - ray emission powered by the interactions of shock waves and the surrounding dense inter stellar medium .",
    "some of the accretion - powered ulxs are also observed to be associated with older supernova remnant - like structures ( e.g. , ic  342-x1 , roberts et al . 2003 ) .",
    "the recent observation of a break at a frequency of @xmath21 in the power density spectrum of the ulx ngc  4559 x-7 suggests a mass of a few thousands solar masses , consistent with the measured thermal temperature of @xmath22 .",
    "this observation clearly supports the imbh scenario for ulxs .",
    "it has become increasingly clear that there are two separate populations of ulxs . a large number of ulxs",
    "are located in regions of current star formation in star - burst and spiral galaxies ( the antennae , zezas et al .",

    "m  51 , also known as the whirlpool galaxy , is a face - on spiral galaxy and is located at a distance of 8.4 mpc ( feldmeier et al .",

    "the x - ray image revealed the nucleus , 113 x - ray sources and extended emission which resembled the morphology of both the radio and optical emission line images ( terashima & wilson 2001 ) .",
    "the x - ray image of the nucleus is well represented by a model consisting of soft thermal plasma ( @xmath35 ) , a very hard continuum and an fe  k@xmath10 emission line at 6.45  kev with an equivalent width of greater than 2  kev .",
    "the x - ray spectra of the extra - nuclear clouds are well fitted by a thermal plasma model with @xmath35 .",
    "the spectral shape and morphology strongly suggest that the clouds are shock - heated by a bipolar outflow from the nucleus .",

    "the number of extra - nuclear sources in m  51 is much higher than in most other normal spiral and elliptical galaxies and is similar to galaxies experiencing star - burst activity .",
    "the x - ray spectra of most of the detected sources are consistent with a power - law spectral form with a photon index between 1 and 2 , while one source has an extremely hard spectrum and two sources have particularly soft spectra .",

    "the galaxy m  51 was observed by _ xmm - newton _ observatory @xcite on 2003 january 15 for a duration of @xmath37 . the epic pn @xcite and mos @xcite cameras were operated in full - frame mode using the thin filter .",
    "the optical monitor ( om ) instrument and the reflection grating spectrometers operated simultaneously with the epic cameras .",

    "however , for the temporal analysis , we used all events with pattern 012 for both the pn and mos cameras .",
    "we extracted pn images in the full ( @xmath38 ) , @xmath39 , @xmath40 , and @xmath1 bands .",

    "the brighter source is an ulx , which is clearly resolved in _",

    "there is also a well isolated ulx in the companion galaxy ngc  5195 .",
    "however , the central region of ngc  5195 consists of multiple bright point sources and extended soft emission as seen in the _ chandra _ acis - s image ( terashima & wilson 2004 ) . due to lower angular resolution of _ xmm - newton _ , it is not possible to extract counts for individual sources in the central region of ngc  5195 .",
    "therefore we exclude the bright sources in the central region of ngc  5195 from our analysis .",
    "chandra _ source ngc  5194#63 had an x - ray luminosity @xmath46 during the two previous _ chandra _ observations . in this observation",
    "this source has a luminosity of @xmath47 in the @xmath48 band and we now include this source in our sample .",
    "we extracted @xmath49 x - ray light curves for the llagn and ulxs in m  51 from the epic pn data .",
    "the extraction regions had radii in the range of @xmath50 and enclosed @xmath51 of the x - ray emission from each source .",
    "the smallest circular regions were chosen to avoid contamination from nearby sources .",
    "we used time bins of @xmath52 and required that the bins be at least @xmath53 exposed in order to minimize the errors due to the low number of counts from the weak sources .",
    "we also extracted individual background light curves for each of the sources using circular regions lying approximately at the same readout distance as that for the source .",
    "the source light curves were then corrected for the background contribution using the background light curves and appropriate scaling factors to take into account the different extraction areas .",
    "we fit a constant count rate model to each of the light curves to investigate the possibility of rapid variability .",

    "the results for each light curve are listed in table  2 .",

    "the light curves of these two sources are plotted in figure  [ f3 ] .",
    "source 69 shows the most significant rapid variability .",
    "the light curve shows three tentative peaks at regular intervals .",
    "the first _",
    "observation of this ulx in june 2000 showed two peaks separated by @xmath57 .",
    "these features were interpreted by liu et al .",
    "( 2002 ) as a signal with a period of @xmath58 .",
    "we have searched for a similar periodic signal in the _ xmm - newton _ light curves . for this purpose , we combined the pn and mos light curves , binned to @xmath52 .",
    "the initial search for periodicity in the source , as well as the folding of the light curve with respect to the final period obtained was performed with the xronos 5.19 package , which is a part of ftools 5.2 .",
    "the periodogram was obtained using the algorithm of scargle ( 1982 ) , following the recipe of normalizing the periodogram power using the total variance of the complete light curve as prescribed by horne & baliunas ( 1986 ) .",
    "this algorithm is very robust for detecting periodic signals in light curves with few data points as well as non - uniformly distributed observational data , while providing a ` false alarm probability ' of the periodicity arising in the light curve from random noise .",
    "this probability is obtained using the signal to noise ratio , where the variance of the noise is obtained under the basic assumption that it is a normally distributed random variable .",
    "the periodogram is shown in figure [ f4 ] ( _ left _ ) .",
    "the period obtained was @xmath59 s , with a false alarm probability of @xmath60 , suggesting that the observed modulation is not generated by the statistical fluctuation of the noise , to a confidence level of @xmath61 .",
    "the main source of the noise in the power in the fourier frequency domain are the inherent statistical fluctuations at scales @xmath62 ks ( figure [ f4 ] ) .",
    "we have tested for the periodicity on top of a constant count rate . however , in reality , the source probably has a red - noise power spectrum , similar to xrbs .",
    "therefore , the @xmath63 or @xmath61 detection of the period is an upper limit , and the periodicity may or may not be a true signal .",
    "future long baseline x - ray observations will be crucial for the robust detection of the periodicity from this ulx . in figure [ f4 ] ( _ right _ ) we provide the light curve folded with respect to the period of 5925 s , with a bin size of @xmath52 . evidently , the modulation fraction is in excess of @xmath64 , similar to the estimate of liu et al .",

    "( terashima & wilson 2004 ) in june 2000 and june 2001 .",
    "figure  [ f5 ] shows the comparison of the fluxes .",
    "cross - calibration results suggest that the fluxes measured with _",
    "chandra _ and _ xmm - newton _ agree at a level better than @xmath66 ( snowden 2002 ) .",
    "thus , all the ulxs , except ngc  5194#41 and ngc  5195#12 , show long - term significant variability over a baseline of @xmath67 .",
    "for each ulx and the llagn , we extracted source and background spectra from the final filtered pn event list using the same extraction regions that we used for the pn light curves .",
    "we also extracted the source spectra from the mos data using source regions similar to that used for the pn .",
    "the background mos spectra for the individual ulxs were extracted using circles in the nearby source - free regions .",
    "appropriate pn and mos responses and effective area files were created for each source using the sas tasks _ rmfgen _ and _ arfgen_. a grouping of 20 counts per spectral channel resulted in significant degradation in the spectral resolution of the ulx spectra above @xmath68 .",
    "therefore , all the source spectra were grouped to a minimum of 10 counts per spectral channel so that discrete spectral features are not missed .",
    "the spectra were analyzed with the xspec 11.3 spectral analysis package ( arnaud 1996 ) , and using the c - statistics instead of @xmath54-statistic which is not useful in the case of low ( @xmath69 ) counts per bin . unlike the @xmath54-statistic",
    ", the c - statistic does not provide a goodness - of - fit ( gof ) criterion .",
    "therefore we simulate 5000 spectra based on the best - fit model derived using the c - statistic , and calculate the percentage of these spectra with the c - statistic less than that for the data .",
    "this number provides the gof , and if this number is @xmath70 , then the model is a good fit to the observed spectrum ( similar to the reduced @xmath71 criterion ) , though obviously we can not statistically exclude fits for which gof@xmath72 .",
    "the confidence intervals are calculated in the same way as in the case of @xmath54-statistic .",
    "all the errors quoted below were calculated at @xmath73 confidence level for one interesting parameter i.e. , @xmath74 .    at first the mos and pn spectra of a few bright sources",
    "were fitted separately to check for the possible uncertainties due to cross - calibration problems .",
    "we found generally good agreement between mos and pn cameras in the @xmath48 bands .",
    "therefore we present the spectral results obtained by fitting the same model jointly to the pn and mos data while leaving the relative normalizations to vary .",
    "an absorbed power - law model is a poor fit to the pn and mos spectra of the nucleus of ngc  5194 ( @xmath75 for 409 degrees of freedom ( dof ) , gof=@xmath76 ) . to show the significant spectral features , we fitted the absorbed power - law model in the @xmath77 and @xmath78 bands and plotted the ratio of the observed data in the @xmath48 band and the best - fit power - law in figure  [ f6 ] .",
    "a strong soft x - ray excess below @xmath79 and a narrow iron k@xmath10 line at @xmath14 are evident in the spectrum . the x - ray image , shown in fig .",
    "[ f1 ] , clearly shows presence of extended emission which we interpret as originating from optically thin thermal plasma .",
    "accordingly , we added a _ mekal _ component to describe the soft component and a gaussian line model at @xmath14 .",
    "the fit improves significantly ( @xmath80 for 404 dof , @xmath81 ) , however , the soft x - ray emission is not well described .",
    "there are still line - like residuals below @xmath82 , suggesting either the hot gas responsible for the soft excess emission has a temperature structure and/or its abundance ratio is non - solar .",
    "including an additional _ mekal _ component ( model 1 ) further improves the fit ( @xmath83 for 401 dof ; @xmath84 ) , and removes the soft residuals seen earlier .",
    "the best - fit temperatures are @xmath85 and @xmath86 , and the best - fit abundances , relative to solar , are @xmath87 and @xmath88 for the two _ mekal _ components . the observed data , the best - fit model and their ratio are plotted in figure  [ f7 ] .",
    "we also tested the possibility of the non - solar abundance ratio by replacing the two _ mekal _ component by a _",
    "vmekal _ component ( model 2 ) which allows the abundance ratios of individual elements to vary .",
    "this model also improved the fit over that involving a single _ mekal _ component .",
    "the best - fit parameters for both models are listed in table  [ t3 ] .",
    "model 1 and 2 describe the data statistically equally well ( @xmath89 , and @xmath90 for model 1 and 2 , respectively ) .",
    "both models result in an extremely flat hard x - ray slope ( @xmath91 ) , and strong iron k@xmath10 line ( ew @xmath92 ) from neutral material .",
    "the flat spectrum and strong iron line strongly suggest that the hard x - ray emission from the llagn in ngc  5194 is dominated by reflection from a cold material .",
    "previous _ bepposax _",
    "observations of m  51 showed the llagn is obviously thomson thick ( @xmath93 ; fukazawa et al .",
    "therefore , we replaced the simple power - law model with the compton reflection model _ pexrav _ ( magdziarz & zdziarski 1995 ) .",
    "this model calculates the reflected spectrum from a neutral disk exposed to an exponentially cutoff power - law spectrum . since _",
    "xmm - newton _ does not cover the expected peak ( 2040 kev ) of the reflection component , it is not possible to tightly constrain all the parameters of the reflection model using this data alone .",
    "instead , we fix the power - law photon index at @xmath94 , cutoff energy of the primary power law at 200 kev , disk inclination at 70 degrees and the abundance of heavy elements at @xmath95 relative to solar value .",
    "we also fixed the relative amount of reflection , @xmath96 , corresponding to an isotropic source above a reflecting plane .",
    "the only variable parameter of the pexriv model was the normalization of the incident power law .",
    "we chose a high inclination angle due to the thomson - thick nature of the llagn .",
    "we also set the reflection model to produce the reflection component alone .",
    "this corresponds to a situation in which the primary x - ray emission is completely absorbed by a column density in excess of @xmath97 along the line of sight and we observe the x - ray emission scattered by the matter near the nucleus .",

    "fitting the above model ( model 3 ) resulted in no strong apparent residuals .",
    "model 3 consisting of two _ mekal _ components , compton reflection , and a narrow gaussian resulted in @xmath98 for 400 dof and @xmath99 .",

    "liu et al . ( 2002 ) discussed the possibility that the observed periodicity is due to orbital variations and as noted by liu et al .",
    "( 2002 ) , only low mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ) can have orbital periods as small as @xmath255 with high luminosities . in this case",
    "liu et al . ( 2002 ) estimate the mass of the donor to be @xmath256 .",
    "the spectrum of source 69 derived from the first _",
    "observation was found to be consistent with an absorbed multicolor disk model with inner disk temperature of @xmath257 and showed marginal improvement in the fit after including a single temperature blackbody component .",
    "based on these results , liu et al .",
    "( 2002 ) do not rule out the possibility that source 69 is a neutron star .",
    "our _ xmm - newton _ spectra require three components - a power - law ( @xmath212 ) , a _",
    "mekal _ ( @xmath258 ) and another _ mekal _ ( @xmath259 ) or a cool accretion disk ( @xmath260 ) .",
    "the stellar mass black hole systems and high luminosity neutron star binary systems , both have high disk temperatures ( @xmath261 ) . the possible variation in the period , due to a qpo and the x - ray spectrum both are inconsistent with the lmxb picture .",
    "moreover , source 69 resides in a region that is likely to be undergoing active star formation , making it likely that the ulx is a high mass x - ray binary ( hmxb ) .",
    "the spectral transition of source 69 from a high - hard to low - soft state also is in disagreement with the behavior of most galactic lmxbs ( terashima & wilson 2004 ) .",
    "if we interpret the variation of the apparent periodicity as resulting from qpos , then qpo frequency of @xmath262 is much lower than @xmath263 qpo observed with _",
    "rxte _ from the galactic black hole candidate grs  1915 + 105 , which has a dynamically measured mass of @xmath264 ( morgan , remillard & grener 1997 ) .",
    "the only ulx known to show qpo is m  82 x-1 ( strohmayer & mushotzky 2003 ) .",
    "its qpo frequency of @xmath265 is also lower than that of grs  1915 + 105 but much larger than the implied frequency for source 69 .",
    "it is not necessary the case that qpo frequency scales with the mass of the black hole , only twin peak qpos with a frequency ratio of 3:2 have been established to scale with black hole mass ( mcclintock & remillard 2003 ) .",
    "the micro - quasar grs  1915 + 105 is known to show qpos at khz as well as mhz frequencies , the lowest frequency of qpo observed from grs 1915 + 105 is @xmath266 ( morgan et al .",
    "therefore it is not entirely unlikely the possibility of a @xmath267 qpo from source 69 .",
    "long observations are required to clarify the presence of periodicity or qpo in this ulx .",
    "we have analyzed _ xmm - newton _ epic observation of m  51 performed in january 2003 .",
    "our main findings are as follows :    * we detected 9 ulxs , an llagn and extended soft thermal emission from m  51 .",
    "one of the sources ( source 63 ) is a new ulx , not identified earlier due to its previously faint flux levels . *",
    "all eight ulxs in ngc  5194 are located in or near spiral arms .",
    "four ulxs are located in the regions of strong uv emission in the spiral arms , suggesting association of these ulxs with current star formation . *",
    "two ulxs ( sources 26 and 69 ) show evidence for short - term variability .",
    "source 69 is the most rapidly variable ulx in m  51 and shows a possible period of @xmath268 .",
    "all the ulxs except ngc  5194#12 , show long - term variability by a factors of few to several . *",
    "most ulxs in m  51 show soft x - ray excess emission , above a hard power law , that is modeled by a _",
    "mekal _ plasma and/or an mcd component .",
    "however the strength of the soft excess emission inferred from an ulx is comparable to the diffuse emission around individual ulxs excluding source 69 .",
    "thus the soft excess emission is unlikely to be physically associated with any of the ulxs except source 69 .",
    "the soft excess emission from source 69 is about a factor four stronger than the surrounding diffuse emission and is likely intrinsic to the ulx .",
    "* there is an indication of either a moderately broad ( @xmath269 ) iron k@xmath10 line or an iron k absorption edge both due to neutral iron in the spectrum of source 26 . *",
    "the x - ray spectrum of llagn in ngc  5194 is extremely flat ( @xmath13 ) and shows a strong ( ew@xmath270 ) , narrow , iron line from neutral material .",
    "the x - ray emission from the llagn in ngc  5194 is dominated by reflection from cold material .",
    "we are grateful to an anonymous referee for the valuable comments and suggestions that improved the paper .",
