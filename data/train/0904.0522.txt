    "the occurrence of rogue waves , i.e waves that are at least twice the size of the significant wave height of the surrounding waves , has long been a well known and much feared subject among professionals in the off - shore and sea faring business  @xcite .",
    "the first truly scientific measurement of such a rogue wave was done at the draupner oil platform in the north sea off the coast of norway on january 1 , 1995 @xcite , where the so - called draupner wave or new years wave was observed . since then , a large number of measurements , using different techniques , have been made in areas prone to such rogue waves , and the concept of rogue or freak waves is now scientifically well established  @xcite .",
    "the findings show clearly that the rogue wave phenomenon is far more common than predicted by linear wave models .",
    "both shallow and deep water wave behavior can to some degree be captured by simple nonlinear models , e.g.  the korteweg - de vries or nonlinear schrdinger equations ( nlse ) @xcite . for deep water waves , modified nlse models , such as the dysthe equation  @xcite ,",
    "have been proposed to more accurately characterize such waves .",
    "simulations of the exact dynamical equations have shown the formation of freak waves in the nonlinear stage of the stokes wave modulational instability @xcite .",
    "some of the main features of rogue waves are nevertheless still elusive in the simplified model descriptions .",
    "hammack et al .",
    "@xcite studied the nonlinear interaction between large amplitude water waves in the laboratory and observed a dependence of the modulational instability on the angle between two large amplitude water waves .",
    "recently , onorato _ et al _",
    "@xcite showed that interesting behavior arose if freak waves were modeled using nonlinearly interacting water waves .",
    "this model was later shown to give rise to wave pattern close to present rogue wave observations  @xcite .",
    "in this paper we present properties of a model of nonlinearly interacting water waves and investigate to which degree the interaction promotes extreme waves , both in terms of the frequency at which waves of different height are occurring , and of the wave system s short and long term behavior .",
    "we will focus on a model for rogue waves based on two coupled nlse  @xcite , which permits large - scale simulations needed to bridge the gap to real - world wave statistics .",
    "the model system consists of two interacting waves @xmath1 and @xmath2 , both traveling into a region of interaction .",
    "the wave system and its time evolution is illustrated in fig .",
    "we analyze the statistical and spectral properties of a system of two nonlinearly interacting water waves by performing extensive numerical simulations .",
    "all measured quantities are obtained from multiple realizations , each starting with different initial wave envelopes @xmath1 and @xmath2 by giving them a small amplitude , noise term .",
    "the evolution of the wave system is calculated from the slowly varying wave envelopes @xmath1 and @xmath2 , which are related to the actual wave surface @xmath3 as @xmath4 with @xmath5 c.c , and @xmath6 c.c . , where c.c .",
    "denotes the complex conjugate , @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the @xmath9 and @xmath10 components of the wave vector , and @xmath11 is the wave frequency .",
    "the latter is related to the wave vector via the water wave dispersion relation @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the gravitational acceleration and @xmath14 is the magnitude of the wave vector .",
    "the time evolution of the wave envelopes are given by the coupled nlses , displayed in fig .",
    "as we can see the last term dictates the coupling between the two waves with the coupling constant @xmath15 which ultimately is given from the angle @xmath16 . by setting @xmath17",
    "we obtain an uncoupled wave system .    in short",
    "we have @xcite : the group velocity components @xmath18 , the group dispersion coefficients @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 , the nonlinear coefficient @xmath22 , and finally , the coupling coefficient @xmath23 @xmath24 . the vector components @xmath7 and @xmath8 can be expressed from the angle between the wave vectors and the dichotome as @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "we have normalized the spatial coordinates and wave envelopes as @xmath27 , @xmath28 , and @xmath29 , and time as @xmath30 to obtain dimensionless coupled nlses in terms of the dimensionless , primed variables , and where @xmath31 and @xmath11 are eliminated . for convenience",
    ", we have omitted the primes below .",
    "we simulate the dynamics of the two interacting waves by using a pseudo - spectral routine  calculating the spatial derivatives in the spectral domain with periodic boundary conditions , and the fourth - order runge - kutta algorithm as time integrator .",
    "we use the grid sizes @xmath32 and the time step @xmath33 .",
    "the number of grid points are @xmath34 in fig . 1 and @xmath35 in fig",
    ". 2 . as initial conditions",
    ", we set the @xmath1 and @xmath2 to constant amplitudes @xmath36 and @xmath37 , with @xmath38 having values in the range 0.050.12 . to seed the instability and generate multiple realizations for each parameter setting we add a small amplitude noise to @xmath1 and @xmath2 of the order @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "the total energy @xmath41 is a conserved quantity .",
    "locally the energy fluctuates , and the wave energy fluctuations of the system can be quantified by the variance @xmath42 , where @xmath43 is the average energy density .    in fig .",
    "1b we display the fluctuations @xmath44 for a system of two interacting waves @xmath1 and @xmath2 measured at different times @xmath45 and with different energies @xmath46 using the angle @xmath47 .",
    "we see that @xmath44 initially increases with time for all @xmath46 and reaches a maximal value , then decreases and eventually stabilizes at a value that is larger for larger values of @xmath46",
    ". moreover , fig .",
    "1b also indicates that @xmath44 can be described by a function of only one variable .",
    "specifically , we assume that the shape of @xmath44 can be expressed in terms of a dimensionless scaling function of only one variable , @xmath48 .",
    "we write this as @xmath49 . for dimensional reasons",
    "we then expect @xmath50 , as @xmath51 is dimensionless , but leave this for the collapse plot .",
    "1c shows a collapse plot of @xmath52 and an uncoupled ( u - cpl ) system ( one collapsed curve for each case ) , with the values @xmath50 , @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "hence , we can read out a scaling law of the form @xmath55 , since @xmath56  the nonlinear coefficient .",
    "we also see that as @xmath57 , @xmath48 approaches the constant value @xmath58 , which yields the property @xmath59 as @xmath60 .",
    "the scaling function tells us that the time evolution of the wave system display the same behaviour and is only scaled by the wave energy ( and the nonlinear coefficient ) .",
    "the right - hand vertical axis in fig  1c show the positive values of the excess kurtosis of the wave surface @xmath61 , as this can be mapped onto our dimensionless scaling function since the variance of @xmath46 is proportional to the fourth moment of the wave surface and @xmath46 is proportional to the variance of the wave surface .",
    "this only holds when the fluctuations of the envelopes are large , and therefore we only display the the mapping for @xmath62 , which are obtained from processes with a wider - than - normal - distribution .",
    "we see that the coupled wave system reaches a maximum kurtosis of 3 and that all wave systems finally approach zero , the kurtosis of a normal distribution .",
    "similar results has been obtained for simulations of shallow water waves in crossing seas @xcite .",
    "note that for larger angles @xmath63 and uncoupled wave systems the curves fall on top of each other , in contrast to @xmath64 and @xmath65 which are shifted .",
    "it was noted in refs .",
    "@xcite that there is a critical angle @xmath66 at which the interaction changes character , making systems with @xmath67 more unstable due to overlapping instability regions and forming rogue waves at shorter time scales .",
    "this may explain the difference between @xmath68 where the waves interact strongly , and @xmath69 where the waves behave as uncoupled ( or single ) wave systems .",
    "the space - independent harmonic solution is given as  @xcite , @xmath70 $ ] and @xmath70 $ ] , where @xmath36 and @xmath37 are the initial , average , values of the wave envelopes .",
    "since @xmath38 , the average energy density is @xmath71 , and we see that @xmath72=a_0\\exp[(i/2)(\\xi+2\\zeta){\\cal e}t]$ ] . so in the region of overlapping instabilities of the two waves , the time evolution might be scaled by @xmath73 rather than just @xmath74 .",
    "we test this as before by performing a collapse for @xmath64 and @xmath65 . in fig .",
    "2d we see that all three curves fall onto one and we can read out a new scaling as @xmath75 $ ] .    the coupled wave systems with @xmath64 and @xmath65",
    "have two local maxima , with the second maxima close to @xmath76 .",
    "for systems of waves with no region of overlapping instability , when @xmath77 , there is only one peak of @xmath51 , indicating that overlapping instability regions are needed to form the first peak . for @xmath78 , @xmath79 and uncoupled waves , the only maximum of @xmath80 is found at @xmath81 .",
    "our assumption is that the second maxima for @xmath64 and @xmath65 and the only maximum for @xmath78 and @xmath79 are evolved by additional instabilities seen in both systems and represent the same point in their development , but is reached at different times du to a different scaling .    by plotting the time it takes to reach the second maxima for systems of overlapping instabilities and the only maximum for systems of no overlapping instabilities for different @xmath16s , the two curves",
    "should then if our assumption holds intersect at @xmath0 and demonstrate that that the different scaling behaviour is separated by @xmath0 . in fig .",
    "2e we plot @xmath45 for the two different scaling behaviors and additionally show the measured values for the different @xmath16s .",
    "we indeed see that the two curves intersect at the critical angle @xmath82 as anticipated .",
    "this , together with fig .",
    "1c and fig .",
    "1d tells us that @xmath83 \\mbox{if $ \\theta \\geq \\theta_c$}\\\\            & { \\cal e}^2\\,f_{\\sigma}\\left[(\\xi+2\\zeta(\\theta)){\\cal e}t\\right ] \\mbox{if $ \\theta<\\theta_c$}\\end{array}\\right .. \\ ] ] it was also noted in refs .",
    "@xcite that counter - propagating waves and waves propagating at large angles , @xmath84 give rise to a new instability perpendicular to their direction of propagation . however , this large angle regime is outside the scope of the present article and is left for future studies .",
    "typical data from ocean waves give  @xcite , the wave frequency 0.09 hz , @xmath85 , and @xmath86 .",
    "we set @xmath87 . in fig .",
    "2a we display the wave surface @xmath3 , the power spectrum @xmath88 , and the surface elevation probability density function @xmath89 of an interacting wave system with @xmath47 .",
    "note that only the positive part of the surface elevation probability density is displayed , as the distribution is symmetric around zero .",
    "the snapshots are taken where the largest kurtosis is found ( see fig .",
    "this is exactly at the end of the exponential growth regime , with the wave envelopes @xmath1 and @xmath2 forming waves fronts extending in the @xmath10 direction , traveling in the @xmath9 direction . in fig .",
    "2b we look at the second peak of @xmath80 , @xmath90 , of the coupled wave ( upper ) , and compare it with the @xmath80-maxima , @xmath91 , of an uncoupled wave system ( middle ) , also with @xmath47 .",
    "this is where the two systems are showing the largest waves , despite the fact that the coupled system has a larger kurtosis in fig  2a .",
    "the largest wave found in the coupled system is 21.24 m , significantly larger than in the uncoupled case , 15.75 m .",
    "the distribution @xmath89 ( bottom panel of fig .",
    "2b ) is significantly wider in the coupled case , showing a tenfold , or higher , probability of generating waves of 15 m or larger .",
    "the coupling re - distributes the wave energy and introduce additional wave modes in the power spectra @xmath88 , as a result of the coupling to the @xmath2-wave .",
    "asymptotically ( fig .",
    "2c ) , measured at @xmath92 for the coupled system and @xmath93 for the uncoupled system , the differences are diminished , which also was indicated from the kurtosis in fig  1c .",
    "2d illustrates where the snapshots of fig .",
    "2a - c are taken .",
    "an increasing amount of data is currently being accumulated to improve rogue waves statistics and to map out areas prone to rogue waves  @xcite .",
    "it is clear that such waves must be generated through a nonlinear mechanism .",
    "however , the treatment of coupled wave systems using a fully three - dimensional fluid dynamic setting is out of computational bounds .",
    "therefore , although the model presented here does not take into account the full complexity of such wave interactions  @xcite , it leaves the most essential nonlinear parts intact , and renders a statistical interpretation possible by performing large scale simulations .",
    "another interesting aspect of the model presented here is its suitability for optical experiments .",
    "recently , the occurrence of optical rogue waves in white light propagation has been observed  @xcite .",
    "such direct optical experimental studies of extreme waves can be used as a means for discriminating between different waves models . indeed , also here",
    "the propagation of light in optical fibers gives an simplified picture of extreme water surface wave dynamics , but in essence retain the important properties of such rogue wave formation . measuring rouge wave statistics of different wave guides could thus be performed to experimentally investigate the effect of the wave coupling more closely .",
    "the simplest example would be to investigate the difference between reflective and absorbing boundaries in an optical fibre .    in conclusion ,",
    "we observe two different dynamical scaling behaviors separated by a critical angle @xmath0the direction of the wave systems relative to the dichotome .",
    "we also observe an increased probability of rogue wave occurrence in a coupled two - wave system compared with an uncoupled wave system .",
    "the increase is twofold ; the interaction increases the nonlinear focusing of wave energy into larger waves , and additionally , the time needed to evolve large waves is decreased .",
    "the second part is particularly important when considering rogue waves at sea as wind speeds and directions vary significantly with time @xcite",
    ". the local wind will align the waves in the wind direction , while turning winds are often associated with an inhomogeneous wind field making waves generated in different regions being radiated into neighboring regions .",
