    "new - generation spectrographs , at the major ground - based telescopes , have begun to pour in the hard - disks of astronomers computers an increasing mass of high - quality spectroscopic data .",
    "inverse resolutions as high as @xmath3 can now be easily attained , at least for the brightest ( @xmath4 mag ) objects in the sky , and this is pushing the observation of local and extragalactic stellar systems to an ever unimagined resolution level .",
    "the outstanding performance of instruments like uves and virmos at the eso very large telescope , or hires and sarg at the keck observatory and telescopio nazionale galileo , respectively , urges therefore theoretical tools of comparable accuracy level in order to consistently match and analyse such a huge amount of observational data .    in this framework , and to help filling the gap , we undertook a long - term project aimed at providing the community with a systematic theoretical library of high - resolution stellar spectra ( virtually the largest sample currently available in the literature ) in the optical range ( @xmath5   ) and at an inverse resolution of @xmath6 .",
    "this first set of spectral energy distributions relied on the synthe code of kurucz ( 1993 ) , using atlas9 model atmospheres ( kurucz 1995 ) as input .",
    "computations have been carried out at the brera observatory in milan ( italy ) .",
    "the input models follow the classical approximations of steady - state , homogeneous , lte , plane - parallel layers , with a microturbulence velocity of 2 km / s and a mixing - length value @xmath7 . they make use of an improved treatment of convective overshooting in the calculation of the transfer equations ( castelli , gratton , & kurucz 1997 ) .",
    "over 46 million absorption lines are accounted for in the code , including all atomic elements at different ionization states and the most important diatomic molecules .",
    "all line data were extracted from the kurucz ( 1992 ) original database , with the major improvement of the tio contribution , for which we adopted the new list of lines computed by schwenke ( 1998 ) .",
    "the wavelength interval spans the whole optical range , from the balmer break to h@xmath8 .",
    "all the passbands of the lick / ids spectrophotometric indices ( worthey et al .",
    "1994 ) are included , as well as the high - resolution index set defined by rose ( 1994 ) .",
    "spectra are sampled at variable wavelength step maintaining a constant resolution ( @xmath9 ) .",
    "the library extends to effective temperatures as hot as @xmath10  k , and provides a suitable match to o  @xmath11  k spectral types .",
    "m stars , cooler than @xmath12  k , are however still lacking in our dataset given the missing contribution of tri - atomic molecular opacity in the input model atmospheres ( kurucz 1992 ) .",
    "gravity spans a wide range across the h - r diagram ( @xmath13 ) , namely from dwarf ( mk class v ) to supergiant stars ( mk class i ) , while metallicity accounts for stars at the two extreme edges of the galaxy [ fe / h ] distribution with @xmath14 }",

    "the figure is made up by a dense sequence of positive and negative spikes , which mainly track the residual flux differences in the absorption line profiles .",
    "while positive spikes mainly originate from observed lines that are not present in the synthetic model , the negative peaks come from theoretical absorption lines that are too weak or undetected in the observed spectrum .",
    "note , as a stricking feature in the plot , that both positive and negative spikes tend to decrease at longer wavelength , and no systematic drift is present in the data distribution .",
