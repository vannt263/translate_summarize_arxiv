    "gas loss , caused by supernova wind , occurs earlier in less massive galaxies .",
    "therefore , a smaller fraction of gas is processed before being expelled from the less massive galaxy @xcite , resulting in lower average metallicities @xcite .",
    "@xcite found a very small intrinsic scatter in the @xmath5@xmath6 cmr ( @xmath20.05 mag ) and , due to the sensitivity of the @xmath5 band to the presence of young stars , interpreted this as a small age dispersion .",
    "age and metallicity are observed to have the same effect on broadband optical colours , whereas spectral line indices can be used to break the degeneracy @xcite .",

    "the ultraviolet  optical cmr for non - star - forming galaxies has an intrinsic scatter an order of magnitude larger than its optical counterpart ; @xmath20.5 mag compared to 0.05 mag ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "hot young stellar populations dominate the ultraviolet ( uv ) flux for @xmath2100 myr after an episode of star formation ( ten times longer than h@xmath4 emission after star formation ; @xcite ) .",
    "the large intrinsic scatter in the uv cmr is therefore often interpreted as differing quantities of very recent , albeit low level , star formation @xcite .    in intermediate age populations ( @xmath213 gyr )",
    ", the near - uv ( nuv ; 20003000 ) flux is dominated by hot stars on the main sequence turn - off ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the sensitivity of the turn - off to the epoch of formation emphasises the importance of the uv bands for age determination @xcite .",
    "old ( @xmath210 gyr ) metal - poor populations have a significant uv flux contribution from very hot ( @xmath7 @xmath2 10000k ) blue horizontal branch ( bhb ) stars @xcite .",
    "however these tend to reside in globular clusters or galactic haloes ( where fe / h @xmath8 ) , where they are useful age indicators @xcite , rather than in relatively metal - rich elliptical galaxies .",
    "the uv picture is further complicated by the presence of the ultraviolet upturn ( or uv excess , uvx ) phenomenon .",
    "first observed by @xcite , this unanticipated upturn dominates the far - uv ( fuv ; @xmath9 2000 ) in uvx galaxies . in contrast",
    ", the nuv can be decomposed into two separate components : the blue end of the main sequence / subgiant branch , and the uvx contribution @xcite .",
    "@xcite found that the uvx can sometimes be appreciable at wavelengths as long as 2700 : for example , in ngc 4649 @xmath275 per cent of the nuv flux can be attributed to the uvx component .",
    "however , the uvx can not be explained by the bhb population , as the temperature required to fit the upturn would be @xmath7 @xmath10 20000k , whereas bhbs are usually no hotter than @xmath7 @xmath2 12000k @xcite .",
    "@xcite further reported that fuv flux ( assumed to trace the uvx ) is strongly correlated with the mg@xmath11 line strength ( @xmath2metallicity ) and also with the velocity dispersion , which is a proxy for galaxy mass .",
    "however , more recent studies ( e.g. @xcite ) have weakened the case for a strong uvx vs metallicity relation . from analysis of internal colour gradients",
    ", @xcite concluded that the fuv flux in most early - types originates from old stellar components .",
    "drawing on these results , the source of the uvx is tentatively identified as hot , low mass , helium burning stars , such as extreme horizontal branch ( ehb ) or ` failed ' agb ( agb - manqu ) stars and their progeny ( see @xcite , or the review @xcite ) .    the _ galaxy evolution explorer _ ( _ galex _ ; launched in 2003 ; @xcite , @xcite ) is revolutionising uv astronomy , with high resolution imaging in two bands : near - ultraviolet ( @xmath0 ; @xmath12  ) and far - ultraviolet ( @xmath13 ; @xmath14  ) . using analysis of both @xmath0@xmath6 and @xmath13@xmath6 vs @xmath15@xmath6 relations",

    "we select galaxies using strict emission criteria to avoid contamination from galaxies with very recent star formation .",
    "we analyse the @xmath0 colour  magnitude relation ( cmr ) for our two samples of quiescent galaxies ( 920 in nfps ; 156 in ssc ) , and find rms dispersions of 0.37 and 0.30 mag ( intrinsic scatter of 0.36 and 0.29 mag ) respectively .",
    "this is similar to previously reported values of @xmath20.5 mag and is an order of magnitude larger than the scatter in the optical cmr ( @xmath20.05 mag ) .",
    "we compared the @xmath0@xmath1 colour to the spectroscopic stellar population parameters for 87 galaxies in the ssc sample and found the following :    * there is a significant @xmath0@xmath1 vs metallicity trend , with a slope of @xmath38 and an rms dispersion of 0.32 mag .",
    "* there is only a weak @xmath0@xmath1 vs age trend after the metallicity effect has been removed , and no correlation with @xmath4-abundance .",
    "* there is a large intrinsic scatter ( @xmath20.25 mag ) in the @xmath0@xmath1 colour at fixed age and metallicity which can not be easily accounted for with simple stellar populations .",
    "the unexpected blue colours of at least some objects , including an influential outlier , can not be attributed to large radius contamination from other objects , and aperture bias can not account for the large scatter .",
    "corrections for the uv upturn ( uvx ) phenomenon are relatively small ( @xmath20.2 mag ) and are similar galaxy - to - galaxy , so do not reduce the intrinsic scatter .",
    "we find that the large @xmath0@xmath1 intrinsic scatter could be attributed to galaxy ` frosting ' by small ( @xmath9 5 per cent ) populations of either young stars or a low metallicity blue horizontal branch .",
