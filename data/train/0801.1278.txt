    "diffusion problems on tree structures pop up in a wide range of scientific domains , such as theoretical physics  @xcite , computer science  @xcite , phylogenetic analysis  @xcite and cognitive science  @xcite .",
    "moreover , dynamics in tree structures have gained a renewed interest in the physics community as a spin - off of the attention devoted to the structural properties of complex networks  @xcite and dynamical processes taking place on top of them  @xcite .",
    "thus , along with the widely explored scale - free ( sf ) networks  @xcite , also sf trees have started to be used as underlying topologies for dynamical processes .",
    "interestingly , the absence of loops in trees turns out to have a strong impact on the considered dynamics , and relevant differences between looped networks and tree topologies have been recently reported in several dynamical models , such as the voter model  @xcite , the naming game  @xcite , the random walk and the pair - annihilation processes  @xcite , and a model for norm spreading  @xcite .",
    "the properties of most dynamical processes on looped network can be reasonably accounted for by annealed mean - field theories @xcite , which rely only on information about the degree distribution and degree correlations @xcite , and consider the network as maximally random at all other respects .",
    "the behavior observed in trees , different from the annealed mean - field predictions , must thus be explained in terms of the non - local constrain of absence of loops imposed in this kind of graphs , which is hard to implement in theoretical approaches .    in this paper",
    "we explore the peculiarities induced in dynamical processes by the absence of loops by considering the simplest possible example , namely the uncorrelated random walk  @xcite .",
    "several works have been devoted in the past to the study of random walks on complex networks , showing in general a good agreement between theory and simulations on looped networks , while differences were reported in tree networks in ref .",
    "@xcite . here",
    ", we find that the global constraint of lack of loops induces a general slowing down of diffusion , as measured by the network coverage and the mean topological displacement from the origin .",
    "as well , it profoundly alters the degree dependence of the mean - first passage time .",
    "this is due to the fact that the source - target distance is dominating in trees . in order to account for this features",
    ", we study the mean round trip time versus distance and find an analytic expression of its dependence on degree .",
    "we consider random walks on general networks defined by a walker that , located on a given vertex of degree @xmath0 at time @xmath1 , hops with probability @xmath2 to one of the @xmath0 neighbors of that vertex at time @xmath3 .",
    "we have measured the properties of random walks on growing sf trees created with the linear preferential attachment ( lpa ) algorithm  @xcite : at each time step @xmath4 , a new vertex with @xmath5 edges is added to the network and connected to an existing vertex @xmath6 of degree @xmath7 with probability @xmath8 .",
    "this process is iterated until reaching the desired size @xmath9 .",
    "the resulting network has degree distribution @xmath10 with tunable exponent @xmath11 , with @xmath12 for @xmath13 . for @xmath14",
    "the lpa model yields a strict tree topology .",
    "degree correlations , measured by the average degree of the nearest neighbors of the vertices of degree @xmath0 @xcite , are given by @xmath15  @xcite .",
    "therefore , only for @xmath16 ( @xmath17 ) we expect to obtain uncorrelated networks .    in order to explore the intrinsic properties of a tree topology , disregarding sf effects , we have also considered homogeneous networks . in the growing exponential network model ( em )",
    "@xcite , at each time step @xmath4 a new vertex with @xmath5 edges is added to the network , and it is connected to @xmath5 randomly chosen other vertices . in the continuous degree approximation ( i.e. , considering the degree as a continuous variable and substituting sums by integrals ) , this models leads to networks with an exponential degree distribution , @xmath18 .",
    "again , homogeneous trees are generated by selecting @xmath14 .",
    "the random cayley tree ( rc ) , on the other hand , is generated by adding @xmath19 neighbors to a randomly selected leaf ( i.e. a vertex whose degree is @xmath20 ) at each time step @xmath4 ( @xmath21 neighbors are added to the first vertex ) .",
    "the resulting tree contains only vertices with degree @xmath22 , and leaves with @xmath20 .    to check our results against looped structures ,",
    "we have considered the uncorrelated configuration model ( ucm )  @xcite , yielding uncorrelated networks with any prescribed sf degree distribution .",
    "the model is defined as follows : ( 1 ) assign to each vertex @xmath23 in a set of @xmath9 initially disconnected vertices a degree @xmath24 , extracted from the probability distribution @xmath10 , and subject to the constraints @xmath25 and @xmath26 even .",
    "( 2 ) construct the network by randomly connecting the vertices with @xmath27 edges , respecting the preassigned degrees and avoiding multiple and self - connections . using this algorithm ,",
    "it is possible to create sf networks which are completely uncorrelated .",
    "additionally , by selecting the minimum degree @xmath28 , we generate connected networks with probability almost @xmath29 . the effect of correlations in looped structures can be checked by means of the configuration model ( cm )  @xcite , which is analogous to the ucm , but allows degrees to range in the interval @xmath30 @xcite .",
    "in all present simulations , we set for looped neworks @xmath31 , tree networks corresponding to @xmath14 ( @xmath32 for the rc tree ) .",
    "we start by studying two properties of a random walk that quantify the speed at which it explores its neighborhood in the network .",
    "the first one is the coverage @xmath33 , defined as the number of different vertices visited by a walker at time @xmath1 , averaged for different random walks starting from different sources . for looped networks ,",
    "the coverage reaches after a short transient the functional form @xcite @xmath34 , and @xmath35 will indicate looped and tree networks , respectively . ] in accordance with theoretical calculations for the bethe lattice @xcite , and eventually saturates to @xmath36 , due to finite size effects .",
    "a scaling form for the coverage has been proposed @xcite to be @xmath37 , with @xmath38 for @xmath39 and @xmath40 for @xmath41 .     in looped complex networks as a function of @xmath42 .",

    "bottom : curves for different degrees and fixed network size.,scaledwidth=40.0% ]    the origin of the scaling of the coverage with system size can be understood by means of a simple dynamic mean - field argument .",
    "let us define @xmath43 as the probability that a vertex of degree @xmath0 hosts the random walker at time @xmath1 . during the evolution of the random",

    "the spectrum @xmath49 increases in time as the random walk arrives to vertices that have never been visited .",

    "therefore it is more costly to find new vertices during the walk .",

    ", this distribution shows instead long tails , that can be fitted to a lognormal form , indicating that , in some events ( i.e. when the walker is trapped in one leaf in a subtree ) the discovery of a new vertex can take an unusually large time .",
