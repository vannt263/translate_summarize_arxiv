    "driving a nonlinear hamiltonian system with a fixed form of drive is never effective over long times .",
    "the local intrinsic frequency of the system changes with increasing energy , or more generally , with the increasing action of the system .",
    "this is the very definition of nonlinearity @xcite .",
    "consequently , to keep the driving in resonance with the system the external frequencies must be gradually adapted .    in this paper",
    "we show that a nonlinear system can nevertheless be pumped with energy from an external drive even if the latter is fixed .",
    "the condition for our approach to work is that the driven system allows for global transport in phase space .",
    "a very rough , yet effective criterion for the onset of chaos in that sense has been introduced by chirikov and is by now known as chirikov ( or also resonance overlap ) criterion @xcite .",
    "the overlapping of nonlinear resonances in phase space is the origin of dynamical stochasticity in classical hamiltonian systems @xcite . in section [ sec:2 ]",
    "we introduce a model system which was studied before in reference @xcite , where the effectiveness of the overlap criterion was theoretically predicted .",
    "the following section [ sec:3 ] reports major results from ample numerical investigations of the model , which verify the predictions of @xcite .",
    "section [ sec:4 ] concludes the paper .",

    "throughout we will stick to the following model for a classical hamiltonian system , given by an harmonic oscillator @xmath4 , a quartic nonlinear potential @xmath5 , and a periodic driving @xmath6 : @xmath7 with the following parts @xmath8 similar models ( also known as lorentz models ) have been studied over many decades , in particular in the context of nonlinear optics @xcite . instead of integrating directly newton s equation corresponding to the hamiltonian ( [ eq:1 ] ) in the variables @xmath9 , we follow reference @xcite and rewrite the problem in action - angle variables of the harmonic oscillator @xmath10 which are connected to the previous ones by the canonical transformation @xmath11 the advantage of using the action - angle variables lies not only in their use in perturbation theory as exercised in @xcite , but for us , first and foremost , in the fact that we are interested in transport in phase space .",
    "the latter is characterized best by the temporal evolution of the action @xmath12 of the `` unperturbed system '' . in the new variables we obtain the new hamiltonian @xmath13 the corresponding equations of motion for @xmath10",
    "are then simply given by hamilton s equations : @xmath14 in the next section we present results obtained by integrating these equations of motion over time . before we motivate our choice of the driving signal given by @xmath6 .",
    "it essentially contains two frequency scales , one given by the sinusoidal part oscillating with frequency @xmath15 and a second one determined by a period @xmath1 .",
    "the detailed form of the drive is best seen pictorially in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] .",
    "now we fix this form of the external driving and try to investigate the behavior of the time - averaged action @xmath16 for different parameters of the model .",
    "for the following computations , we fix the initial conditions @xmath17 and the parameters @xmath18 units have been suppressed throughout ( and maybe easily reintroduced in case having in mind the meaning of all parameters ) .",
    "this leaves us only one control parameter , the effective nonlinearity @xmath19 , which characterizes the nonlinear response of the system with respect to the external drive .",
    "we do not repeat the analytical estimates for the widths of corresponding nonlinear resonances in the phase space spanned by the variables @xmath20 .",
    "reference @xcite derives from them a critical parameter @xmath21 which separates motion without overlapping resonances , for @xmath22 , from the one with overlapping resonances , implying chaotic transport for @xmath23 .",
    "written in our parameters , we obtain from @xcite @xmath24 @xmath21 is time - dependent through the dependence on the action variable @xmath12 .",
    "its initial value at time @xmath25 indeed determines the increase of the mean action as the following figures show .    figs .",
