    "the nuclear shell model @xcite was introduced in the mid-20@xmath4 century and its major success was the description of the magic numbers .",
    "recently , it was suggested that for extremely neutron - rich nuclei the ordering of the orbits , and hence the magic numbers as we know them from nuclei close to the line of @xmath5 stability , may change due to diffuseness of the nuclear surface @xcite .",
    "further , it was pointed out that an experimental fingerprint of the changing structure may be found in the @xmath6 ratio systematics for the neutron - rich even - even nuclei , because in the case of weakening of the @xmath7 term in the shell model potential , the @xmath6 ratio would strongly depend on the occupation of the @xmath8 single - particle orbits @xcite .",
    "the shell quenching was also suggested to be the origin of the poor theoretical description of the @xmath9-process abundance in the region below the @xmath10 peak @xcite .",
    "however , recent studies performed at gsi show no need of shell quenching to explain the structure of @xmath11cd@xmath12 @xcite .",
    "it was pointed out that if a neutron shell erosion is present in the @xmath13 isotonic chain , it should take place deep below @xmath14sn in the @xmath15 proton shell . among the candidates for strongly pronounced shell quenching effects are the neutron - rich zirconium nuclei @xcite .",
    "of particular interest is @xmath16zr@xmath12 which would be a magic nucleus in terms of the `` classic '' magic numbers .",
    "this nucleus is far from being accessible experimentally , but given that the degree of collectivity depends on the number of valence particles , a change in the neutron magic numbers would also affect the structure of the neutron mid - shell zirconium nuclei . to search for deviations from the mid - shell behavior , ibm-1 calculations were performed @xcite assuming the persistence of the @xmath17=50 and 82 magic numbers .",
    "the spectroscopic observables , level energies and transition strengths in @xmath18zr@xmath19 were predicted using a hamiltonian parametrized with respect to nuclei lying close to the line of @xmath5-stability .",
    "further , the excited states in @xmath20zr were experimentally observed from @xmath5-decay studies performed at riken @xcite .",
    "the experimental level energies are in good agreement with the model predictions suggesting that @xmath20zr@xmath19 is indeed a mid - shell nucleus . in @xmath21zr @xcite ,",
    "an isomeric decay was also experimentally observed , revealing the energy of the first excited state .",
    "it was shown , that in the zirconium isotopic chain the @xmath22 state gradually increases in energy from the mid - shell nucleus towards the next neutron magic number .",
    "even though the evolution of the @xmath22 states in the neutron - rich zirconium isotopes hints at the preservation of the `` classical '' magic numbers when departing from the neutron mid - shell @xmath20zr nucleus , more experimental data are needed to draw firm conclusions .",
    "a different approach to the problem is the systematic analysis of the states in the odd - mass and odd - odd nuclei and in particular the positioning of the unique - parity states relative to the normal - parity states .",
    "these high-@xmath23 intruder states appear at the upper part of the shells , where low-@xmath23 normal parity states are present , and are often responsible for the islands of isomerism emerging in the vicinity of the magic numbers .",
    "also , in the odd - odd nuclei at the top of the shells , long - lived isomers emerge from the structure of the split proton - neutron multiplets @xcite .",
    "thus , the islands of isomerism in specific mass regions are directly related to the existence of the magic numbers and the identification of the opposite parity states in the odd - a and odd - odd nuclei can give a direct measure of whether the shells are quenched or not .    in the region below @xmath14sn ,",
    "the unique - parity orbits are @xmath24 and @xmath25 arising from the fourth proton and fifth neutron oscillator shell , respectively , leading to the appearance of positive - parity states in the odd - a ( z=47 ) silver isotopes and states of opposite parities in the even - mass ag nuclei .",
    "the interplay between these unique - parity and the normal - parity orbits often gives rise to isomers close to the ground state .",
    "a well - known example is @xmath26ag@xmath12 , which has a @xmath5-decaying isomer with a half - life of @xmath27160 ms and a 46-ms ground state @xcite , leading to a @xmath26ag@xmath12 stellar half - life of the order of 80 ms .",
    "such long - lived isomerism can shed light on the observed @xmath9-process overabundance in the @xmath28 mass region .",
    "therefore , of particular interest is the search for isomeric states in the most neutron - rich odd - mass and odd - odd nuclei , just below the doubly magic @xmath14sn nucleus .    prior to this study ,",
    "the shell structure in nuclei around @xmath14sn was studied in a number of experiments on isomeric decays .",
    "the @xmath29sn nuclei were studied at lohengrin @xcite and during the @xmath30-rising campaign @xcite .",
    "isomeric decay studies were performed for @xmath31sn @xcite , @xmath32cd @xcite and @xmath33 in @xcite nuclei in the rising stopped beam campaign @xcite and for @xmath34 in at lohengrin @xcite .",
    "the present work extends these studies towards the most neutron - rich silver nuclei .",
    "the neutron - rich ag nuclei were produced during two experiments performed at gsi , darmstadt , using the fragmentation of a @xmath0xe beam @xcite and the fission of a @xmath1u beam @xcite at relativistic energies . in these experiments ,",
    "the beams were accelerated to 750 mev / a by the sis-18 synchrotron and impinged on be targets of 1 and 4 g/@xmath35 thickness , respectively .",
    "the cocktail of fragments , produced in the fragmentation or fission , was analyzed with the gsi fragment separator ( frs ) @xcite .",
    "the ions were separated by means of their magnetic rigidities , times of flight , energy losses and their positions in the middle and final focal plane of the separator .",
    "the nuclei were slowed by an aluminum wedge shaped degrader and implanted into a copper or plastic stopper , placed at the final focal plane .",
    "delayed @xmath36-rays were detected by the rising multidetector array @xcite , comprising 105 hpge detectors , mounted as 15 cluster detectors .",

    "the biggest discrepancy between the theoretical calculations and the @xmath37ag data is in the @xmath76 level energy , which appears 635 kev above the ground state . in @xmath39ag , the theoretical level energy for the @xmath77",
    "is also overestimated by approximately 300 kev .",
    "further qualitative analysis was made in the framework of the cluster - vibration model .      even though the phenomenological approaches used in the present work give a satisfactory description of particular levels , more realistic calculations using a larger valence space fail in reproducing the level energy sequence in several cases .",
