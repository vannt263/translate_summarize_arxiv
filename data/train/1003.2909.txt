    "the self - avoiding walk ( saw ) is the prototypical lattice model for polymer behavior @xcite .",
    "it is defined as the uniform distribution over the set of all fixed - length nearest - neighbor walks on some lattice , such that no site is visited more than once .",
    "self - avoidance reflects what are known as _ excluded volume _ effects in polymer science @xcite .",
    "the universal aspects of the saw have been the subject of study for decades in the physical and mathematical literature .",
    "while some of its properties are well understood and rigorously established ( a thorough account can be found in @xcite ) , it still poses some difficult ( and some seemingly impossible ) problems .",
    "mathematical and theoretical advances in the study of the saw have always been paralleled by constant efforts for devising new algorithms and numerical strategies @xcite , and since it is one of the simplest non - trivial models it can serve as a test ground for novel algorithms in polymer science .",
    "a connection has been studied in two dimensions  both numerically and analytically  between the critical saw ( in the limit where the number of steps goes to infinity ) and a continuum model , called schramm - loewner evolution ( sle ) .",
    "sle is a one - parameter family of stochastic processes in the complex plane producing random curves ( traces ) with conformal invariance `` built in '' .",
    "it has been conjectured that when the parameter is equal to @xmath0 the scaling limit of self - avoiding walks is obtained @xcite ( this is the case we will be focusing on in this paper ) . later",
    ", numerical evidence has been given in favor of this correspondence , both in the half - plane @xcite and in the whole - plane @xcite geometries .",
    "what we propose here is an algorithm for sampling self - avoiding paths in the plane , based on a discretized version of sle .",
    "essentially , discrete paths are built by iterative composition of rotations together with one simple conformal map that takes a small circle and pulls a slit out of it .",
    "thanks to the way sle works , it is possible to efficiently produce _ independent samples _ , since the algorithm is based on simple brownian motion , which is very easy to sample .",
    "self - avoiding walks on the lattice have a natural parametrization , which corresponds to counting the number of steps along the walk .",
    "as long as one considers observables that depend only on the support of the walk , the correspondence with sle curves is well - understood .",
    "but most of the quantities of interest in polymer physics do depend on the labeling of points along the chain and can not be matched with their sle analogues , since sle curves come with their own uncorrelated parametrization .",
    "actually , the problem of finding a sensible definition of _ natural parametrization _ for sle curves is still debated in the mathematical literature @xcite . from a numerical point of view",
    ", one needs an affordable way of generating sle samples with the parametrization corresponding to the proper time of lattice models .",
    "one such method was introduced and studied by kennedy @xcite and will be briefly reviewed in section [ section : thechoiceofparametrization ] .",
    "we hereby introduce a new method , based on the observation that the saw  even when both the number of steps goes to infinity and the lattice spacing goes to zero  is such that the euclidean distance between two consecutive points on the chain is constant throughout the chain itself .",
    "we require the same property for the sle discrete trace @xmath1 , trying to attain an approximately constant _ step length _ @xmath2 discrete sle chains are constructed by iterative composition of conformal maps , each one being responsible for producing a step @xmath3 .",
    "the method we propose for keeping an approximately constant step length does so by rescaling each step according to the jacobian of the conformal map that acts on the corresponding segment .",
    "we focus on whole - plane sle , so that our algorithm explicitly concerns the saw in the plane , but the same reasoning and methods could be easily translated to other geometries , such as the chordal one . for instance , minimal modification is needed in order to treat ensembles of self - avoiding walks with fixed endpoints lying on the boundary of the domain .",
    "section [ section : discretewholeplanesle ] is a brief introduction to the discrete process that we refer to as _ discrete whole - plane sle _ , which is the central object of interest lying at the heart of the algorithm ; section [ section : thechoiceofparametrization ] introduces the issues about the choice of parametrization ; section [ section : thenumericalstrategy ] describes the numerical strategy used to reproduce the natural parametrization of lattice models in the framework of discrete sle ; numerical results for the saw are presented in section [ section : results ] : we measure the _ asphericity _ of an inner portion of saw  which is a highly parametrization - dependent quantity  and we discuss the first correction - to - scaling exponent .",
    "we are not going to describe sle here ( the interested reader can find all the details in many excellent reviews , such as @xcite ) .",
    "the aim of this section is to present a discrete process approximating radial sle growing to infinity , i.e. a measure on curves with one end - point in @xmath4 and the other at @xmath5 , living on the complex plane minus the unit disc , @xmath6 .",
    "a more in - depth presentation can be found in @xcite .",
    "an analogous discrete process in the chordal geometry was introduced in @xcite , where its convergence to sle was also studied .",
    "let us consider an ordered set of points @xmath7 we will call such a set _ trace _ or _",
    "chain_. we are going to describe a stochastic process whose outcomes are such traces .",
    "let @xmath8 and @xmath9 be two sequences of real numbers with @xmath10 .",
    "consider the maps @xmath11 these are conformal maps of @xmath12 onto @xmath13 , whose action can be described as growing a _ slit _ @xmath14 inside @xmath12 along the real axis , of length @xmath15 @xmath16 is the inverse map of the solution at time @xmath17 to the _ loewner equation _ in the disc @xmath18 in the special case where the _ driving function _ is a constant @xmath19 .",
    "notice that @xmath16 is well - defined also on the boundary of @xmath12 .    by complex inversion",
    "we can then define a family of maps growing slits in the complement of @xmath12 in @xmath20 : @xmath21 the conformal maps @xmath22",
    "send @xmath6 onto @xmath6 minus a slit on the real line , whose length is controlled by @xmath17 for the relation between @xmath17 and the length of the slit . ] .",
    "let us construct a trace by intertwining such maps with rotations of the complex plane .",
    "we will consider the images of the point @xmath4 under the chain of maps obtained by alternately composing rotations and slit mappings , as follows : @xmath23 where @xmath24 are rotations whose angles are the parameters @xmath25 .",
    "let us call @xmath26 the @xmath27-th composed map , for use in the next sections : @xmath28 so that @xmath29 . in words ,",
    "we traverse the sequences @xmath9 and @xmath8 backwards from @xmath27 to @xmath30 and for each @xmath31 we compose a slit mapping of parameter @xmath17 with a rotation of angle @xmath25 .",
    "refer to figure [ figure : composition ] .    ,",
    "the second one ( clockwise ) to the rotation @xmath32 , the third one to @xmath33 , the fourth one to @xmath34 and so on .",
    "the last black arrow corresponds to the last rotation @xmath35 .",
    "the dashed blue arrow is the complete map @xmath26 .",
    "blue crosses in the last picture identify the points @xmath1 that constitute the trace . ]    at first a single slit is grown , and the point @xmath4 gets mapped onto the real axis , some distance away from the disc , namely at @xmath36 . then the universe is rotated and another slit is grown by application of @xmath33 , so that the base of the previous slit  which still lies on the unit circle after the rotation  will be sent somewhere on the new slit . ] .",
    "notice that in general the shape of the old slit gets distorted because of the action of @xmath33 .",
    "the process goes on until the first map is reached ; at that time , a chain of @xmath27 points has been produced .",
    "notice that , since the composition in ( [ eq : tip ] ) goes backwards from @xmath27 to @xmath30 , adding a step on the tip of the trace without changing the rest of the trace itself means inserting @xmath37 at the rightmost place in ( [ eq : tip ] ) and then recomputing the whole chain to denote an index running from @xmath30 to @xmath38 ( labeling the points on the chain ) and letter @xmath31 to denote an index running from @xmath27 to @xmath30 ( labeling the incremental maps that build up the @xmath27-th composed map ) , but this is not a strict distinction , since they actually label the same sequences . ] .",
    "the trace obtained of course depends on the two sequences @xmath8 and @xmath9 , so that a measure on the latter induces a measure on the former .",
    "we will draw @xmath25 and @xmath17 in such a way that their relation be that of space versus time for the one - dimensional rescaled brownian motion .",
    "the easiest way of doing so is to draw the @xmath25 s as bernoulli variables in the set @xmath39  where @xmath40 is a positive real number  and we shall do so in the following .",
    "we still have the freedom to choose the  time steps \" @xmath17 .",
    "a careful choice of the latter is what allows us to reproduce the parametrization of the lattice models .",
    "the discrete process we have introduced here is expected to correspond to whole - plane sle with parameter @xmath40 in the appropriate limit ( essentially , @xmath41 ) , and in particular to the saw when @xmath42 .",
    "notice that the presence of the unit disc as a forbidden region is expected to become irrelevant if one looks at the trace sufficiently far away from the origin , so it is not surprising that the lattice counterpart is _ full - plane _ saw .",
    "the parameters @xmath9 defined in the previous section are the time steps of the discretization .",
    "they represent the time at which the loewner evolution with constant driving function is to be evaluated in order to produce the slit maps defined in ( [ eq : slitmap ] ) , which are the building blocks of the discrete evolution .",
    "if one is interested in reproducing the actual sle , where time is indeed a continuous variable , one will want to have these parameters scale to zero . the choice of _ how _ they do so entails a choice of parametrization on the resulting object . for instance , taking a constant @xmath43 and then sending @xmath44 to zero yields sle parametrized _ by capacity _ , which means that the curves have linearly increasing capacity in the expansion around @xmath5 of @xmath45 . ] .",
    "different definitions can give rise to different parametrizations .",
    "this is not an issue when one is interested only in parametrization - independent features of the curves , such as the fractal dimension , the multifractal spectrum , the distance of the curve from some given point , or the probability of passing on the left or right of an obstacle , to name a few .",
    "but it becomes crucial when one focuses on parametrization - dependent observables of the lattice models .",
    "such are for instance the distribution of a given point inside a saw , the gyration tensor , properties related to the detailed shape of the walks and the universal quantities that describe the approach of an @xmath38-step chain to @xmath46 , such as the correction - to - scaling exponents ( see section [ section : results ] ) .",
    "our goal is to find a choice of @xmath9 capable of reproducing the natural parametrization of the lattice walk models .",
    "the first thing one notices when producing discrete chains with the algorithm described in section [ section : discretewholeplanesle ] is that the parametrization by capacity yields points that get further and further away from each other as the process goes on . the _ step size _",
    "@xmath47 diverges when @xmath48 .",
    "one can then choose to scale the time steps in such a way as to compensate for this .",
    "it turns out ( see @xcite for more details ) that choosing @xmath49 at least definitively in @xmath31 , cancels out the drift in the distance between consecutive points .",
    "notice that this choice is _ non - random _ , meaning that the reparametrization scheme does not depend on the realization of the stochastic process . instead",
    ", the values of @xmath9 are chosen _ before _ the actual simulation takes place .",
    "unfortunately , this strategy does not give the correct parametrization ( see also @xcite , where the same reasoning is applied to the half - plane case ) .",
    "for instance , as far as the spatial distribution of the @xmath50-th point ( for a given @xmath50 ) along the chain is concerned , it gives exactly the same results as the parametrization by capacity .",
    "what happens is that the scaling form ( [ eq : naivescaling ] ) only ensures that the _ average _ distance @xmath51 between consecutive points be constant ( the average is over the realizations of the stochastic process ) . but fluctuations around this average still retain all their correlations , since we are reparametrizing in a naive , non - random fashion .",
    "one solution to this problem was proposed and studied by kennedy @xcite , and is particularly adapted to the case when one is interested in the position of just a single point along the curve .",
    "the idea is to grow the trace with its parametrization by capacity and stop the growth when a fixed `` length '' has been reached .",
    "a definition of length for a discretized fractal object can be introduced , which turns out to be naturally dependent on a fixed length @xmath52 , that is the scale the fractal length ( or _ variation _ ) is measured at .",
    "some care must be taken when using this method , because of the dependence of the results on the choice of the scale @xmath52 .",
    "one would like to send @xmath52 to zero , in order to measure the variation at a finer and finer mesh , but at the same time @xmath52 can not become too small as compared to the step size of the discretized trace , otherwise wilder and wilder rounding problems would completely spoil the computation .",
    "moreover , one wants to send the total length of the curve to infinity , which by scale invariance amounts to shrinking the unit disc down to a point , so as to approach the truly whole - plane geometry .",
    "one is therefore confronted with a tricky double limit , which increases the effort to be put into the analysis of the numerical data , and can blur the estimation of the errors .    the method based on fractal variation is especially suited for producing a _ single _ point on the chain at a given value of the parametrization .",
    "the strategy we shall adopt here is different .",
    "we aim at producing a discrete trace where the step sizes @xmath53 are strictly constant throughout the chain",
    ". stopping the discrete growth after a fixed number of steps will then be automatically equivalent to choosing the stopping time when a fixed value of the fractal variation is reached .",
    "the advantages of this strategy are manifold : one obtains an essentially arbitrary number of points equally spaced in the natural parametrization at the same cost as producing only the last one , and no computationally - delicate double limit is present , so that no additional scaling analysis must be performed . moreover , no prior knowledge of the fractal dimension @xmath54 is needed .",
    "a close relative to the slit mapping in ( [ eq : slitmap ] ) first appeared in the literature about _ diffusion - limited aggregation _ , or dla .",
    "dla  introduced by witten and sander @xcite  is a kinetic model where finite - sized particles perform random walks ( one at a time ) from infinity until they stick irreversibly to a cluster , which grows from a seed placed at the origin .",
    "hastings and levitov @xcite took advantage of the conformal symmetry inherent to this model and proposed an algorithm which turns out to be similar to what we use for simulating schramm - loewner evolutions .",
    "the algorithm works as follows .",
    "the seed of the growth is the unit disc . at each time - step ,",
    "an angle @xmath55 is chosen with the uniform distribution in @xmath56 .",
    "a conformal map @xmath57 is applied , that creates a bump of fixed area @xmath58 centered at @xmath59 .",
    "then , another @xmath60 is chosen , the maps are composed , and so forth .",
    "note that  as is the case for equation ( [ eq : nthmap ] )  if @xmath61 is the map that grows the cluster up to the @xmath62-th deposed grain , then the map that grows the cluster up to the @xmath27-th grain is obtained by _",
    "first _ applying the incremental map @xmath63 and _ then _ @xmath61 , which is to say that the incremental maps are composed in the opposite order than usual .",
    "this growth process satisfies an even stronger version of the domain markov property , which is one of the crucial characteristics of sle @xcite , since now the growth of the cluster at a specific time does not even depend on where it last grew , so not only does the future not depend on the past , but  modulo a conformal transformation  it does not depend on the present either .",
    "an important technical aspect of this algorithm is that one wants to grow bumps of approximately equal size .",
    "but peripheral bumps have undergone several conformal maps and have thus changed their shape and size to a great amount . in general , by the time the whole cluster has been built , the @xmath27-th bump created ( by @xmath63 ) has been subject to the action of @xmath61 . to compensate for this rescaling ,",
    "one wants to create bumps of different sizes , depending on the whole history of maps they will be subject to in the remainder of the growth process . as a first approximation ,",
    "as long as the new ( @xmath27-th ) bump is sufficiently small , it is natural to try and correct only for the jacobian factor @xmath64 of the previous composed map , calculated at the place where the new bump is to be created , because this is the rescaling factor that will affect the shape of the bump at first order in its size .",
    "the @xmath27-th bump size should then be @xmath65 since this strategy seems to give satisfactory results , it is very natural to try and apply it to the numerical reparametrization of sle : rescaling the step sizes of the approximated sle trace by the dilatation factor given by the jacobian ( very similar ideas were also fruitfully exploited in @xcite , where multifractal spectra for laplacian walks are computed ) .    the size @xmath66 of the @xmath27-th slit grown is a function of the time - like parameter @xmath67 which controls the capacity of the incremental map at step @xmath27 : @xmath68 as can be seen by inverting ( [ eq : slitlength ] ) .",
    "one wants to rescale @xmath67 so that @xmath66 gets rescaled by a factor given by the jacobian @xmath69 in analogy with ( [ eq : dlafirstderivative ] ) .",
    "unfortunately , there happens to be a great obstruction to this program , due to the fact that sle satisfies `` only '' domain markov property , instead of the complete independence of dla steps that we discussed above .",
    "if we look at equation ( [ eq : dlafirstderivative ] ) we see that rescaling the step - sizes is possible because of the independence of @xmath70 ( the space - like variable ) from @xmath71 ( the time - like variable ) .",
    "this independence in dla stems from the fact that the distribution of the @xmath70 s is flat on @xmath56 and does not change , so that one can operatively choose every step @xmath72 _ before _ performing the composition of the corresponding maps . in sle , on the contrary , despite the fact that the steps satisfy the domain markov property , the increments @xmath73 are drawn with a bernoulli distribution from the set @xmath74 , which does depend on time ,",
    "since it depends explicitly on the time - like parameter @xmath67 ; on the other hand the jacobian needed to rescale @xmath67 is to be evaluated at @xmath75 .",
    "therefore , the problem is that we do not really know where to compute the jacobian , until we have actually computed it !",
    "this is ultimately related to the fact that sle is driven by a non - trivial stochastic process , so that @xmath67 and @xmath73 are intertwined .",
    "( dashed blue lines ) , as @xmath73 and @xmath67 take on their allowed values .",
    "the red circle is the unit disc ; the red arrows are examples of the possible slits grown . ]",
    "the reader can find a depiction of how the length of the slit @xmath66 and the angle @xmath25 are related in figure [ figure : hearts ] , which is a polar graph ( for @xmath76 ) for the position of the tip of the slit as a function of the angle  as can be found by inverting ( [ eq : steplengthdelta ] ) : @xmath77    thus , the main problem with the foregoing approach is that @xmath73 and @xmath67 depend on one another , so that one does not know where to compute the derivative .",
    "one way to overcome this problem is the following .",
    "expand the derivative of @xmath61 ( the map that grows the hull at step @xmath78 ) around its zero , which occurs at @xmath4 , and evaluate it at the point @xmath75 , which is the point where the @xmath27-th slit is going to be placed : @xmath79 this expression is accurate when @xmath73 is small .",
    "on the other hand , we also want to approximate the change in length of the slit by the value of the derivative at the base , silently assuming that it does not change much along the slit .",
    "this approximation is justified by the fact that , by ( [ eq : ldelta ] ) , @xmath80 is proportional to @xmath73 for @xmath73 small .    by expanding the exponential , taking the modulus , and remembering that @xmath81 for every @xmath27  as can be seen by taking the derivative of ( [ eq : nthmap ] ) with @xmath82 given by ( [ eq : wholeplanemap ] ) and ( [ eq : slitmap ] )  one obtains the jacobian ( [ eq : jacobian ] ) at order @xmath83 @xmath84 we want to rescale the length @xmath66 of the @xmath27-th slit by @xmath85 , so we rewrite the equation relating @xmath67 and @xmath66 ( [ eq : steplengthdelta ] ) by substituting @xmath86 where @xmath87 is the desired step length ( as in ( [ eq : constantsteplength ] ) , which represents our goal ) , and by making use of the brownian relation @xmath88 we obtain an equation which ( if solved ) gives the time - step @xmath67 producing both the correct rescaling , at first order in @xmath73 , and the right relation with the space - step @xmath73 : @xmath89 the actual sign of @xmath90 is to be chosen at random , according to the bernoulli nature of @xmath73 .    unfortunately , equation ( [ eq : transcendental ] ) is transcendental , and can not be solved explicitly .",
    "a little thinking shows that for @xmath91 large one expects a small @xmath67 .",
    "in fact , ( [ eq : transcendental ] ) implies that the combination @xmath92 be divergent when @xmath93 . a crude approximation",
    "is then obtained by expanding the left hand side in powers of @xmath67 around @xmath94 , the right hand side in @xmath92 around @xmath5 and matching the two behaviors at first order .",
    "this is the best one can do , since higher orders would require solving algebraic equations of order greater than @xmath95 in @xmath96 . among the solutions we choose",
    "the positive one : @xmath97 numerical solution to ( [ eq : transcendental ] ) shows that ( [ eq : deltaj ] ) is off by @xmath98 when @xmath99 and by @xmath100 when @xmath101 , for @xmath102 and @xmath42 . the approximation works ( see section [ section : results ] ) because the typical values of @xmath91 involved are large .    of course , the foregoing method can be used only if one has an effective means of computing the main ingredient : @xmath91 .",
    "it turns out that there is such a way .",
    "straightforward calculations show ( the details are in the appendix ) that @xmath103 where @xmath104 is defined as @xmath105 equation ( [ eq : secondderivativeexpression ] ) is a closed formula for the hessian , in terms of @xmath106  which only depends on @xmath67 , see ( [ eq : phisecond ] )  and the function @xmath107  see ( [ eq : phiprime1 ] ) and ( [ eq : phiprime2 ] ) . notice that the points @xmath108 must already be computed by the routine that produces the @xmath27-th point on the trace @xmath109  as was explained in section [ section : discretewholeplanesle ]  so that computing @xmath110 adds very little computational load . at the @xmath27-th step of the algorithm",

    "the evaluation of @xmath170 for saws has been the subject of debate in the past decades .",
    "in fact , the rich structure of corrections in ( [ eq : correctionstoscaling ] ) makes it difficult to extract precise values from numerical data .",
    "there is now strong evidence for the absence of a leading term with exponent @xmath172 on the square lattice , the first non - null confluent contribution having exponent @xmath173 @xcite .",
    "notice that this does not configure a violation of universality , since the amplitudes of the corrections are model - dependent . by including the first analytical correction ( at next - to - leading order ) and fixing @xmath170 to its theoretical value",

    "the purpose was to build an algorithm for exactly sampling self - avoiding paths , by correctly reproducing the parametrization induced by the scaling limit of lattice models , namely self - avoiding walks .",
    "the method is based on iterative composition of conformal maps , where each map acts by building a radial slit out of the unit circle , which will eventually become one of the steps of the discrete path .",
    "each step has to be rescaled according to the jacobian of the map that evolves it .",
    "this program encounters some technical hindrances  essentially due to the fact that rescaling a step actually changes the jacobian .",
    "we showed that an alternative approach is possible , by keeping track of the second derivative of the map .",
    "it turns out that the hessian can be effectively computed in the framework of iterated conformal maps , since it can be expressed as a simple function of quantities already computed by the algorithm .    by exploiting the powerful correspondence existing between sle and saws",
    ", the algorithm presented here produces completely independent samples of self - avoiding paths from the origin to infinity in the plane , whose parametrization is the desired one  that corresponding to saws  , and does so in an affordable way , with a complexity @xmath116 for @xmath38-step chains .",
    "this allows us to study parametrization - dependent observables of the saw such as the internal asphericity and the leading correction - to - scaling exponent , whose determination is considered a challenging problem in the numerical study of polymers .",
    "the results we obtain are very accurate .",
    "the analysis has been carried out in the whole - plane radial geometry , but very little should be changed in order to adapt it to the half - plane chordal case , or to other restricted geometries of interest in polymer science .",
    "interesting questions remain open .",
    "it is still not clear whether there exists a way of reproducing finite - chain effects by the foregoing techniques",
    ". it would be useful for instance to produce the correct distribution of the _ end - point _ of a saw , which is fixed to infinity in the present study .",
    "on the other hand , a great advance would be to translate this method to other classes of critical polymers , such as the @xmath60 point where the collapsing transition poses even more difficult problems to monte carlo methods due to the attractive interactions and the consequently entangled shapes .",
    "the author wishes to thank sergio caracciolo and andrea pelissetto for suggestions and encouragement .",
    "in this appendix we give a formula for the modulus of the second derivative of @xmath26 , which is needed in a crucial step of the algorithm .",
    "the @xmath27-th composed map ( [ eq : nthmap ] ) can be written as @xmath178 in terms of the @xmath62-th map @xmath61 , for @xmath179 .",
