    "the earliest generations of stars are thought to have transformed the universe from darkness to light and to have reionized and heated the intergalactic medium . knowing how the reionization process happened is a primary goal of cosmologists , because this would tell us when the early stars formed and in what kinds of galaxies .",
    "the strong fluctuations in the number density of galaxies , driven by large - scale density fluctuations in the dark matter , imply that the dense regions reionize first , producing on large scales an inside - out reionization topology @xcite .",
    "this basic picture has been studied and confirmed with detailed analytical models @xcite , semi - numerical methods @xcite , and by a variety of large numerical simulations @xcite that solve gravity plus radiative transfer .",
    "the distribution of neutral hydrogen during reionization can in principle be measured from maps of 21-cm emission by neutral hydrogen @xcite , although upcoming experiments such as the murchison widefield array ( mwa ) and the low frequency array ( lofar ) are expected to be able to detect ionization fluctuations only statistically ( for reviews see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the infancy of cosmic reionization , when only a small fraction of the volume of the universe was ionized , is of interest for a number of reasons .",
    "first , when ionizing sources were rare at early times , they are expected to have formed separate h  ii bubbles which if observed can be used to study directly the properties of individual sources and their surroundings @xcite , without the complications of later times , when overlapping bubbles imply that galaxy clustering dominates the ionization distribution and the 21-cm power spectrum .",
    "second , when ionization fluctuations disappear over much of the universe , it becomes possible to use the 21-cm technique for other applications including those of fundamental cosmology , without the complications of ionization fluctuations which are intrinsically non - linear ( since the ionization fraction varies from 0 to 1 ) .",
    "major such applications include measurements of the density power spectrum @xcite , of fluctuations in the radiation emitted by the first galaxies @xcite , and of fluctuations in the rate of heating from early x - rays @xcite .",
    "if ionization fluctuations are negligible then the angular anisotropy of the 21-cm power spectrum makes it possible to measure separately various fluctuation sources , including in particular the cosmologically - interesting baryonic density power spectrum @xcite . on small scales ,",
    "the existence of h  ii bubbles ( even when rare ) affects the fluctuations in and x - ray radiation , producing a small - scale cutoff in the 21-cm power spectrum that can be used to detect and study the population of galaxies that formed just 200 million years after the big bang @xcite .",
    "while analytical models and numerical simulations exist that can be used to study the later epochs of reionization , the early times are very difficult to investigate . simulations , which in general must overcome the huge disparity between the large characteristic scales of galaxy clustering at high redshift and the small scales of individual galaxies @xcite , are stretched even further at early times , when ionizing sources become very rare and even larger cosmological volumes are required in order to assemble a reasonable statistical sample . as discussed in detail below , current analytical models based on the model of @xcite account for galaxy clustering but are based on continuous variables and can not account for the fact that galaxies are discrete sources .",
    "this discreteness becomes a crucial factor in the early stages of reionization , when the number of ionizing sources per bubble is small . in this limit ,",
    "poisson fluctuations also become substantial , weakening the correlation between the galaxy distribution and the underlying large - scale density fluctuations in the dark matter .",
    "discreteness can also play a significant role during the central stages of reionization , particularly in the case of he reionization by quasars , which are rare sources believed to form only in massive halos that correspond to many-@xmath5 density fluctuations at high redshift .",
    "these various aspects of discrete sources are not accounted for in current analytical models .",
    "@xcite considered helium reionization and showed that the continuous models break down when discreteness is important .",
    "they suggested to instead use a pure stochastic poisson model , without halo correlations , when he is less than @xmath6 ionized globally .    in this paper",
    "we develop a model that accounts for discrete sources as well as density correlations .",
    "we solve the model with a monte carlo method and use it to show that galaxy correlations play a major role even in the infancy of cosmic reionization .",
    "isolated one - source bubbles do dominate at sufficiently high redshifts , but the pure stochastic poisson model is essentially never a good description of the bubble size distribution . in the next section we first review previous models ( section  [ s : prev ] ) , then develop ours ( section  [ s : full ] ) and summarize all the various models whose results we later compare ( section  [ s : sum ] ) .",
    "we illustrate our results during the infancy of reionization ( section  [ s:1perc ] ) and then develop an approximate calculation that allows us to scan through a wide parameter space of possible reionization scenarios ( section  [ s : aprx ] ) .",
    "finally , we illustrate our results during later stages of reionization ( section  [ s : late ] ) and summarize our conclusions ( section  [ s : conc ] ) .",
    "we assume a standard @xmath7cdm universe with cosmological parameters that match the five - year wmap data and other large scale structure observations @xcite , namely @xmath8 ( dark matter plus baryons ) , @xmath9 ( cosmological constant ) , @xmath10 ( baryons ) , @xmath11 ( hubble constant ) , @xmath12 ( power spectrum index ) and @xmath13 ( power spectrum normalization ) .",
    "analytical approaches to galaxy formation and reionization are based on the mathematical problem of random walks with barriers .",
    "the statistics of a random walk with a barrier can be used to calculate various one - point distributions , including the distribution of ionized bubble sizes during reionization @xcite .",
    "this distribution indicates how likely it is for each scale to determine whether a given point is ionized . as such",
    ", it indicates the relative importance of various scales in reionization , yielding important intuition about the internal dynamics of reionization . if bubbles of a given radius @xmath14 are common , this produces a strong correlation in the neutral fraction ( and thus 21-cm emission ) on a scale @xmath15 , since the ionization states of two points separated by up to @xmath14 are then often coupled .",
    "calculations of the 21-cm correlation function using two - point extensions of the model yield reasonable agreement with numerical simulations @xcite and indicate that the main feature of the power spectrum during reionization , i.e. , enhanced large - scale power , indeed appears on scales corresponding to the most likely bubble sizes .",
    "in this section we first review the basic setup of the random walk problem in the context of reionization .",
    "we then show how the standard approach can be generalized to solve for the bubble size distribution including poisson fluctuations .",
    "the basic approach for using random walks with barriers in cosmology follows @xcite , who used it to rederive and extend the halo formation model of @xcite . in this approach we work with the linear overdensity field @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is a comoving position in space",
    ", @xmath18 is the cosmological redshift and @xmath19 is the mean value of the mass density @xmath20 . in the linear regime",
    ", the overdensity grows in proportion to the linear growth factor @xmath21 ( defined relative to @xmath22 ) , making it possible to extrapolate the initial density field at high redshift to the present by multiplication by the relative growth factor .",
    "thus , in this paper the density @xmath23 and related quantities refer to their values linearly - extrapolated to the present . in each application there",
    "is in addition a barrier that signifies the critical value ( as a function of scale ) which the linearly - extrapolated @xmath24 must reach in order to achieve some physical milestone , which here corresponds to having a sufficient number of galaxies within some region in order to fully reionize it .    considering an arbitrary point @xmath25 in space ( at a given @xmath18 ) , we calculate as follows its probability of being inside h  ii bubbles of various sizes @xcite .",
    "we consider the smoothed density around this point , first averaging over a large scale or , equivalently , including only small comoving wavenumbers @xmath26 .",
    "we then average over smaller scales ( i.e. , include larger @xmath26 ) until we find the largest scale on which the averaged overdensity is higher than the barrier ; in the application to reionization , we then assume that the point @xmath25 belongs to an h  ii bubble of this size .",
    "mathematically , if the initial density field is a gaussian random field and the smoothing is done using sharp @xmath26-space filters , then the value of the smoothed @xmath23 undergoes a random walk as the cutoff value of @xmath26 is increased . instead of using @xmath26 , we adopt the ( linearly - extrapolated ) variance @xmath27 of density fluctuations as the independent variable .",
    "while the solutions are derived in reference to sharp @xmath26-space smoothing , we follow the traditional extended press - schechter approach and substitute real - space quantities in the final formulas . in particular , @xmath27 is calculated as the variance of the mass @xmath28 enclosed in a spatial sphere of comoving radius @xmath29 .    the appropriate barrier for reionization",
    "was derived by @xcite , who noted that the ionized fraction in a region is given by @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the collapse fraction ( i.e. , the gas fraction in galactic halos ) and @xmath32 is the overall efficiency factor , which is the number of ionizing photons that escape from galactic halos per hydrogen atom ( or ion ) contained in these halos , divided by the number of times each hydrogen atom in the intergalactic medium must be reionized ( where this number is assumed to be spatially uniform ) . in the extended press - schechter model @xcite , in a region containing a mass corresponding to variance @xmath33 , f_coll = erfc ( )  , [ eq : exps ] where @xmath34 is the variance corresponding to the minimum mass @xmath35 of a halo that hosts a galaxy",
    ", @xmath23 is the mean density fluctuation in the given region , and @xmath36 is the critical density for halo collapse at @xmath18 . in reality , the cosmic mean halo distribution in simulations is better described by the halo mass function of @xcite ( with the updated parameters suggested by @xcite ) .",
    "however , an exact analytical generalization is not known for the biased @xmath31 in regions of various sizes ( corresponding to @xmath33 ) and mean density fluctuations @xmath23 .    @xcite suggested a hybrid prescription that adjusts the abundance in various regions based on the extended press - schechter formula @xcite , and showed that it fits a broad range of simulation results . in general ,",
    "we denote by @xmath37 the mass fraction contained at @xmath18 within halos with mass in the range corresponding to variance @xmath27 to @xmath38 , where @xmath36 is the critical density for halo collapse at @xmath18 .",
    "then the biased mass function in a region of size @xmath14 ( corresponding to density variance @xmath33 ) and mean density fluctuation @xmath23 is @xcite + & & [ eq : bias ] where @xmath39 and @xmath40 are , respectively , the press - schechter and sheth - tormen halo mass functions .",
    "the value of @xmath41 is the integral of @xmath42 over @xmath27 , from 0 up to the value @xmath34 that corresponds to the minimum halo mass @xmath35 or circular velocity @xmath43 ( where @xmath44 is the virial radius of a halo of mass @xmath35 at @xmath18 ) .",
    "we then numerically find the value of @xmath24 that gives @xmath45 at each @xmath33 , yielding the exact barrier .",
    "also , in order to compare with a simpler , analytically - solvable model , we derive a linear approximation to the barrier , @xmath46 , by numerically finding the value of the barrier at @xmath47 and its derivative with respect to @xmath33 . in general",
    ", photon conservation implies that the mean global ionized fraction should equal @xmath48 in terms of the cosmic mean collapse fraction .",
    "@xcite and @xcite used an approximation in which effectively each factor on the right - hand side of equation  ( [ eq : bias ] ) was integrated separately over @xmath27 , yielding a simple analytical formula for the effective linear barrier .",
    "this approximation was also assumed by @xcite when they stated that this hybrid prescription does not change the bubble size distribution from the pure press - schechter case ( for a fixed redshift , minimum halo mass , and cosmic mean ionized fraction ) .",
    "here we solve numerically for the barrier using the exact formulas .",
    "we show that the previously - used approximation is not too accurate , especially at the early stages of reionization that are our focus in this paper .",
    "the standard approach presented above treats the random walks as functions of a continuous variable @xmath33 , and assumes a one - to - one correspondence between the value of @xmath23 and the ionized fraction @xmath49 at each scale .",
    "the statistical distribution of first barrier crossing , which physically corresponds to the bubble size distribution , can be derived analytically for the approximate linear barrier @xcite , and for the exact barrier can be solved with monte carlo simulations of random walks or by solving an integral equation @xcite .    in reality",
    ", there are two additional physical constraints that are neglected in the standard approach : the ionizing sources are discrete , and the ionized fraction ( for a given value of @xmath23 in a region ) fluctuates due to poisson fluctuations in the number of galaxies .",
    "the discreteness of ionizing sources means that the possible volume of bubbles has a minimum value @xmath50 corresponding to the bubble due to a single galaxy hosted by a halo of mass @xmath35 .",
    "also , the expected ionized fraction @xmath49 given by the continuous model is subject to poisson fluctuations , as the actual ionized fraction depends on the number of galaxies . unlike the standard random walk approach , in which the statistics of the walk depend only on the barrier expressed as a function @xmath51 , poisson fluctuations introduce an explicit dependence on the mapping between @xmath33 and scale @xmath14 .    in order to include these discrete aspects in the bubble distribution ,",
    "we begin with the standard analytical approach , which considers the statistics of spherical volumes of various sizes @xmath14 , all about a point @xmath25 . given a value @xmath23 on a scale @xmath14 ( with corresponding variance @xmath33 )",
    ", we now treat the continuous ionized fraction @xmath49 of the previous subsection only as an average expectation value . to find its real distribution ,",
    "we first calculate the mean expected value @xmath52 of the number of ionizing sources within the sphere of radius @xmath14 .",
    "this ( non - integer ) value can be calculated from the integral of @xmath53 weighted by @xmath54 ( which yields halos weighted by number rather than mass ) ; it depends on @xmath18 , @xmath55 , @xmath23 , and @xmath33 .",
    "the actual value of @xmath56 is given by a poisson distribution with mean equal to @xmath52 .",
    "to find the actual @xmath49 , we find the mass of each of the @xmath56 halos according to the halo mass distribution given by @xmath57 ; note that this procedure does not involve a single , fixed mass distribution since @xmath57 is a function of @xmath23 and @xmath33 .",
    "the complicating factor in this procedure is that we can not treat each scale @xmath14 independently , since the ionizing sources are correlated among the various volumes .",
    "this is the case first because the densities @xmath23 are correlated , and second because the poisson fluctuations are correlated , since each sphere contains all the galaxies that lie within all smaller enclosed spheres .",
    "the correlation of the densities is dealt with in the standard way reviewed above , where small - scale power is added gradually as smaller spheres are considered .",
    "this makes @xmath58 dependent on @xmath59 if @xmath60 , forcing us to start on large scales @xmath47 and go to smaller ones .",
    "however , the poisson fluctuations are correlated in the other direction , since a region @xmath61 contains a region @xmath62 if @xmath63 .",
    "the solution is a two - step monte carlo method : first , we generate the random walk @xmath64 , going from @xmath47 to its maximum value ( corresponding to the minimum bubble volume @xmath50 ) in equal steps . at each @xmath33 step , we find the mean expected number of galactic halos @xmath65 and the mean expected total mass of these halos , @xmath66 .",
    "note that the mean expected ionized fraction is @xmath67 , where @xmath68 is the total mass contained within the spherical volume of radius @xmath14 . in the second step ,",
    "we generate the actual ionized fractions starting from the smallest scale , @xmath50 , and working outwards . at @xmath50 ,",
    "we generate an instance of a poisson distribution with mean @xmath69 , yielding an actual integer number @xmath56 of halos , for each of which we find its mass from the appropriate distribution of halo number versus mass , derived from @xmath57 .",
    "then , for each larger scale ( i.e. , smaller @xmath33 value ) , the additional number of galaxies from the last step is on average expected to be the difference @xmath70 , where @xmath71 are two consecutive steps in @xmath33 .",
    "we find the actual difference @xmath72 from a poisson distribution with a mean of @xmath73 .",
    "however , while an actual number of galaxies can not be negative , sometimes the random walk in @xmath23 gives a value @xmath74 . in this case",
    "we assume that @xmath75 , since the number of galaxies already enclosed in a smaller volume ( corresponding to @xmath61 ) must also be found in the larger , enclosing volume ( @xmath62 ) .",
    "we do not discard the negative value of @xmath73 but add it in the next step to the next value of @xmath73 , continuing until we reach a positive expected mean value on which we can operate a poisson distribution . in each step",
    ", we also keep track of the expected total mass difference , @xmath76 .",
    "we slightly modify value of the cumulative distribution of halo mass @xmath28 ( so that the total probability of having @xmath77 remains unity ) , with the scaling factor ( typically close to unity ) chosen to yield the correct mean halo mass . ]",
    "each distribution @xmath57 that we use to generate the individual halo masses so as to give the correct expected @xmath78 .",
    "this procedure ensures that on each scale we obtain the correct average number of galaxies and correct average galaxy mass , both to high accuracy .",
    "we note also that in each step in @xmath33 , even if @xmath23 at the end of the step is below the barrier , there is a chance that the random walk hit the barrier during the step .",
    "we estimate this probability using a linear barrier approximation applied separately to each step , and if the walk hit the barrier then we raise @xmath23 at the end of the step to the barrier .",
    "this procedure greatly accelerates the convergence of the results as a function of the total number of steps adopted in @xmath33 .",
    "we summarize here the various models for the bubble size distribution that we consider and compare below .    1 .",
    "model a : the correct distribution as given by our full model .",
    "the bubble size distribution is calculated with our monte carlo method with discrete sources and poisson fluctuations , as detailed in section  [ s : full ] .",
    "we also keep track of how many sources are contained in each generated bubble , which allows us to find the cumulative volume fraction contained in bubbles with at least @xmath79 sources , as a function of @xmath79 .",
    "model b : the exact , continuous barrier ( without poisson fluctuations or discreteness ) .",
    "we calculate the non - linear barrier @xmath64 numerically , as detailed in section  [ s : prev ] .",
    "we then derive the bubble size distribution with a monte carlo method that generates random walks and tracks where they first cross the barrier .",
    "model c : a continuous linear barrier approximation .",
    "we calculate a linear barrier approximation @xmath80 numerically , as detailed in section  [ s : prev ] .",
    "we then derive the bubble size distribution analytically as in @xcite .",
    "model d : the previously - used continuous linear barrier approximation . here",
    "we apply the additional approximation mentioned at the end of section  [ s : prev ] , where we noted that it gives the same bubble size distribution as in the linear barrier approximation of the pure press - schechter ( rather than sheth - tormen ) model . in this case",
    "we calculate analytically a linear barrier approximation @xmath81 and then derive the resulting bubble size distribution analytically as in @xcite .",
    "model e : the pure stochastic poisson model suggested by @xcite .",
    "this model , which neglects halo correlations and assumes randomly placed , equal - intensity sources , yields an analytical result @xcite for the cumulative volume fraction contained in bubbles with at least @xmath79 sources .",
    "note that the minimum bubble scale is @xmath82 for models a and e , and @xmath83 ( corresponding to the scale of the minimum halo mass @xmath35 ) for models b  d .",
    "also note that we have tested our barrier - crossing monte - carlo code by comparing it to the analytical solution of a continuous linear barrier ( models c and d ) .",
    "we have confirmed precise convergence , to within a relative error below @xmath84 in the total ionization probability , i.e. , the total probability of crossing the barrier .",
    "we illustrate our results for a wide range of possible parameters for either hydrogen reionization or helium ( full ) reionization . in the latter case",
    ", @xmath32 is simply interpreted as the overall efficiency factor of producing helium - ionizing photons in halos . for hydrogen ,",
    "minimum halo masses @xmath35 that are often considered are the minimum mass for atomic cooling ( corresponding to a circular velocity @xmath85 km / s , where @xmath86 in terms of the halo virial mass and radius ) , or ( at very high redshift ) the minimum mass for molecular hydrogen cooling ( @xmath87 km / s ) .",
    "also , much larger minimum masses are possible , @xmath88 km / s due to photoionization feedback ( which should affect most of the universe by the time reionization is well advanced ) , or even larger values if internal supernova feedback strongly decreases the star formation efficiency of low - mass halos at high redshift . for helium reionization , assuming it occurs much later , photoionization feedback affects the source halos from an early stage when the density of the assembling matter is still low , resulting in a larger @xmath89 km / s ( i.e. , of order the jeans mass ) . furthermore ,",
    "if the observed super - linear local relation between halo and black hole mass holds at high redshift , then quasars are relatively much brighter in more massive halos , increasing the typical halos of helium - ionizing sources to @xmath90 km / s . for a given @xmath91 ,",
    "the efficiency @xmath32 can be chosen to give complete reionization through @xmath92 . ]",
    "@xmath93 at various redshifts @xmath92 . for a fixed @xmath92",
    ", a larger @xmath35 implies that rarer halos caused reionization , resulting in larger poisson fluctuations .",
    "we begin by considering examples corresponding to an early stage ( mean ionized fraction @xmath94 ) of hydrogen or helium reionization . for hydrogen ,",
    "we assume atomic cooling ( @xmath95 km / s ) , with efficiency set to complete reionization ( i.e. , @xmath96 ) at @xmath97 ( implying @xmath98 ) . for helium",
    "we assume @xmath99 and @xmath100 km / s ( implying @xmath101 ) , which gives the bubbles a minimum size at @xmath102 of @xmath103 mpc , about the expected size for the quasars that are observed to dominate the ionizing photon production at that redshift @xcite .",
    "figure  [ f:1perc ] shows that the bubble size distribution obtained from our full model is substantially different from the predictions of previous models that are based either on a continuous barrier or on a purely stochastic poisson distribution .    , or of the number @xmath79 of ionizing sources in the bubble .",
    "assuming @xmath97 and @xmath95 km / s for h , and @xmath99 and @xmath100 km / s for he , we consider @xmath94 ( @xmath104 for h , 6.3 for he ) .",
    "we compare @xmath105 , the fraction of the ionized volume contained in bubbles with volume @xmath106 , from our full monte carlo method with discrete sources ( model a ; solid curves ) to @xmath107 from a continuous barrier ( model b ; short - dashed curves ) , a continuous linear barrier approximation ( model c ; dotted curves ) , and a continuous linear press - schechter barrier ( model d ; dot - dashed curves ) .",
    "we also show @xmath108 , the fraction of the ionized volume contained in bubbles containing @xmath109 sources , from our full model ( model a ; h : squares , he : stars ; long - dashed curves for @xmath110 ) , and from a pure poisson model ( model e ; circles).,width=317 ]    in general these models , based as they are on spherical statistics , do not precisely conserve photons , and thus do not yield precisely the desired @xmath111 which we have set to @xmath84 .",
    "indeed , the raw total ionization probability yielded by the models is @xmath112 ( h ) and @xmath113 ( he ) for model d , @xmath114 ( h ) and @xmath115 ( he ) for model c , and @xmath116 ( h ) and @xmath115 ( he ) for model a. thus , in the figure we compare the relative distributions , expressed in terms of the fraction @xmath117 of the ionized volume contained in various bubbles .",
    "note that model e is defined according to the desired @xmath118 , and model b ( the exact continuous barrier ) is mathematically consistent in the sense that it yields the correct total @xmath118 if the probability is integrated down to @xmath119 ( we have numerically verified this mathematical consistency to a relative error of @xmath120 ) .",
    "discreteness strongly fails for the continuous barrier models ( both linear and non - linear ) , in the sense that much of the ionized volume in these models is predicted to occur inside bubbles below the minimum volume @xmath50 , especially in the case of helium reionization .",
    "indeed , @xmath121 is only @xmath122 ( h ) and @xmath123 ( he ) for model d , @xmath124 ( h ) and @xmath125 ( he ) for model c , and @xmath126 ( h ) and @xmath127 ( he ) for model b. thus , the continuous barrier models fail since they assign a substantial probability to the unphysical case of fractional bubbles that are produced by less than one source . expressed differently",
    ", the continuous barrier models underpredict @xmath121 since they do not include the poisson fluctuations that allow large regions to sometimes reach @xmath128 even when their mean expected ionized fraction @xmath129 is below unity .    figure  [ f:1perc ] also illustrates the continuous model with a linearly approximated barrier , a model used very commonly because it yields analytical predictions @xcite .",
    "the error of the linear barrier approximation grows at small scales , and becomes a @xmath130 error in the barrier height at @xmath131 ( h ) or @xmath132 ( he ) .",
    "however , the linear barrier approximation becomes relatively accurate on scales larger than the scale @xmath50 corresponding to a one - source bubble . on that scale ,",
    "the height of the linear barrier in the examples shown here is only slightly below the height of the real barrier ( by @xmath133 for h and just @xmath134 for he ) , though when @xmath135 the barrier corresponds to a rare @xmath136@xmath5 fluctuation on this scale ( and rarer still at larger scales ) , and thus small differences in barrier height translate to larger differences in @xmath117 .",
    "the figure also shows that the pure press - schechter model ( model d ) is a rather poor approximation to model c. the sheth - tormen hybrid model yields more large bubbles than the press - schechter model , which agrees with the expectation based on the sheth - tormen mean halo mass function , which yields more rare , massive halos than does the press - schechter mass function .",
    "while the continuous barrier model extends unphysically to @xmath137 , it does indicate correctly the fact that @xmath105 declines much more rapidly with @xmath138 for the he case we consider than for h reionization .",
    "in fact , we find that if we simply cut off the @xmath137 portion and renormalize the continuous models relative to @xmath139 ( which is not a standard way of interpreting these models ) , then the exact and linear barrier models yield nearly identical results , and they both yield a reasonable rough estimate to the true bubble size distribution in the full model .",
    "this is illustrated in figure  [ f:1perc2 ] , which shows the same quantities as in figure  [ f:1perc ] except that all the continuous models have been renormalized and are plotted only for @xmath140 .",
    "for instance , the ratio @xmath141 is 1.18 ( h ) and 2.33 ( he ) in the full model ( model a ) , 1.14 ( h ) and 2.54 ( he ) for the continuous exact barrier ( model b ) , and 1.15 ( h ) and 2.58 ( he ) for the continuous linear barrier ( model c ) .",
    "this approach to the continuous models provides a reasonable estimate of the full bubble size distribution in the case of h reionization ; e.g. , @xmath142 for h is 6.73 in model a , 6.46 in model b , and 6.21 in model c , so that here the linear model c , calculated analytically ( i.e. , without using monte carlo random walks or poisson fluctuations ) , yields an estimate of @xmath143 that is within @xmath144 of the true answer according to model a. however , for he reionization this approach is much less successful in predicting ratios involving large volumes ; e.g. , @xmath145 for he is 9.9 in model a , 16.0 in model b , and 17.6 in model c , and these differences increase with @xmath138 ( figure  [ f:1perc2 ] ) .    , or of the number @xmath79 of ionizing sources in the bubble .",
    "same as figure  [ f:1perc ] , except that the continuous models ( models b  d ) have been cut off below @xmath139 and renormalized at that point .",
    "note that the curves for models b and c nearly overlap.,width=317 ]    with our full model ( model a ) , we can also separately predict the distribution by number @xmath108 .",
    "this drops more rapidly with @xmath79 than the distribution by volume @xmath105 does with @xmath138 , since large - volume bubbles can be produced either by having many sources of mass @xmath146 or with a smaller number of individually massive halos taken from the high - mass end of the halo mass function . still , @xmath108 declines with @xmath79 much more slowly than a pure poisson model would predict .",
    "indeed , a purely stochastic model as suggested by @xcite for the early stages of he ionization ( or even as late as @xmath147 ) , where poisson fluctuations are assumed that are uncorrelated with the underlying density distribution , completely fails to describe the results .",
    "the analytical predictions of this model @xcite yield , for @xmath148 ( for either h or he ) , @xmath149 and @xmath150 ( with the latter already outside the range of figures  [ f:1perc ] and [ f:1perc2 ] ) . in particular , the ratio from the previous paragraph ( but applied to the number of sources ) , @xmath151 , is 1.32 ( h ) or 3.8 ( he ) in the full model , compared to @xmath152 for model e. clearly , density correlations play a substantial role in determining the abundance of multi - source bubbles , even early on in reionization and even when the process is driven by large , rare ionizing sources ( such as quasars ) .",
    "to help understand the relation of the full model to the pure poisson and to the continuous barrier models , we show in figure  [ f : del ] the relation between ionization in bubbles and the underlying linear density @xmath23 .",
    "density fluctuations are strongly correlated with ionization , so that the density of ionized regions is strongly biased high , and the distribution is very different from the standard gaussian that would be expected in a pure poisson model .",
    "however , poisson fluctuations allow regions to fully ionize themselves even if their density is significantly lower than the barrier , which in a continuous model would set the minimum needed @xmath23 for ionization by internal sources . in particular , the median @xmath23 for regions ionized by exactly @xmath79 sources ( where exactly means not contained in any larger h  ii region ) represents a fluctuation of 2.4-@xmath5 , 2.57-@xmath5 , and 2.61-@xmath5 ( for h ) or 1.9-@xmath5 , 2.4-@xmath5 , and 2.7-@xmath5 ( for he ) , for @xmath153 , 2 , and 3 , respectively .",
    "the corresponding ( median ) barriers , on the other hand , are 2.907-@xmath5 , 2.909-@xmath5 , and 2.922-@xmath5 ( for h ) , or 3.2-@xmath5 , 3.5-@xmath5 , and 3.7-@xmath5 ( for he ) .",
    "thus , the barriers do give a good rough indication in each case of whether the @xmath23 distributions for various @xmath79 are spaced out or squeezed together .",
    "this in turn determines whether one - source bubbles are dominant and @xmath154 is rare , or if multi - source bubbles are at least as common as @xmath153 .     in units of its standard deviation @xmath155 on the relevant scale . for either h ( dashed curves ) or he ( solid curves ) reionization with the same parameters as in figure  [ f:1perc ]",
    ", we show @xmath156 for regions ionized by exactly one , two , or three sources ( from left to right in each set of curves ) . in each case",
    ", a circle on the one - bubble curve shows the median barrier height on the corresponding scale .",
    "also shown for comparison is the cumulative distribution of the normal distribution for unconstrained regions ( dotted curve).,width=317 ]    the continuous model indicates that the main parameters controlling the relative dominance of single - source bubbles are the effective efficiency @xmath32 and the effective slope of the power spectrum on the scale @xmath157 of a one - source bubble .",
    "the efficiency sets the ratio between the scale @xmath157 of a one - source bubble and the scale @xmath158 from which a galactic halo of mass @xmath159 was assembled ( this ratio equals @xmath160 ) .",
    "now , the key issue is the relative difficulty of each scale achieving self - ionization , when we consider different scales . to self - ionize",
    ", a region must reach a high enough collapse fraction , which according to the extended press - schechter formula in equation  ( [ eq : exps ] ) , requires a value of @xmath24 that depends on the variance @xmath161 available for density fluctuations inside the region . in order to reach this required value ( i.e. , the barrier ) ,",
    "the density has the variance @xmath33 to work with .",
    "thus , when we increase the scale ( e.g. , going from a typical one - source bubble to one with two sources ) , if the fractional decline in @xmath33 is more rapid than in @xmath162 , then self - ionized regions become rarer quickly with increasing scale , leading to the dominance of one - source bubbles .",
    "this is the case when @xmath163 , i.e. , it requires first that the bubble and halo scales differ by a large factor ( which requires large values of @xmath32 ) , and also that the variance depend significantly on scale ( otherwise , @xmath33 and @xmath34 will be about the same even if the corresponding scales are very different ) .",
    "more quantitatively , the fractional decline in @xmath33 , over the fractional decline in @xmath162 , is ( for small changes in @xmath33 ) equal to @xmath164 .",
    "if the power spectrum of density fluctuations is approximated as a power law with an effective index @xmath165 over the relevant range of scales , then this ratio , which indicates how much harder ( in terms of number of @xmath5 of the fluctuation ) it is to ionize larger scales , is approximately @xmath166 . on small scales ,",
    "@xmath165 approaches the asymptotic value of @xmath167 , making all scales behave roughly equally even when @xmath32 is relatively large .",
    "note , though , that increasing @xmath32 increases @xmath157 and thus brings larger scales into play , making the effective @xmath165 less negative and thus boosting the effect of the increased @xmath32 on making few - source bubbles dominant .",
    "this puts a quantitative face on the intuition that rare sources tend to create bubbles with small numbers of sources .",
    "to illustrate , in our h example @xmath168 kpc and @xmath169 kpc , giving @xmath170 , while in the he example @xmath171 mpc and @xmath172 mpc , giving @xmath173 .",
    "thus , he reionization by quasars has both a high efficiency and corresponds to a relatively large scale , both of which contribute to making small bubbles more dominant , in particular the smallest bubbles created by single sources .",
    "the current lack of observations at high redshifts leaves basic parameters of the galaxy population unconstrained at early times .",
    "while our model can be used to calculate the bubble distribution in any particular case , the need to run monte carlo trials makes it difficult to explore a large parameter space .",
    "thus , an approximate but quick calculation is useful for this purpose . in developing such an approximation ,",
    "we focus on determining when one - source bubbles dominate the ionizing volume .",
    "this can be investigated with the ratio @xmath174 , which is close to unity when multi - source bubbles dominate , and is @xmath175 when one - source bubbles do .",
    "specifically , this ratio is related to the fraction @xmath176 of the ionized volume that is contained in one - source bubbles through @xmath177 $ ] .    to construct an approximate calculation of this ratio we first adopt the approximation of having equal intensity sources , all corresponding to halos having a mass equal to the mean expected mass @xmath178 . while this approximation does not work well for obtaining information on the bubble size distribution",
    ", we find that it works reasonably for our desired ratio involving the distribution of number of sources per bubble .",
    "we first consider in general the self - ionization probability on the scale of a bubble containing @xmath56 sources ( with a variance @xmath27 that we approximate as that corresponding to a volume @xmath179 ) , i.e. , the probability that a region of this size contains at least @xmath56 sources ( regardless of whether or not it is contained in some larger bubble ) . a first attempt to calculate this quantity",
    "@xmath180 is to calculate the poisson probability of having at least @xmath56 sources , averaged over the normal distribution of @xmath23 on the scale @xmath27 : p_self(j ) = d e^-^2/(2 s ) p_pois(j ^i(,s ) ; j )  , [ eq : self ] where @xmath181 denotes the probability of having at least @xmath56 sources in a poisson distribution with mean @xmath182 , and @xmath183 ( which also depends on @xmath18 and @xmath34 ) is an approximate estimate of @xmath184 where we use the same approximation as in model d in order to obtain a simple formula . for large bubbles ,",
    "equation  [ eq : self ] for @xmath185 underestimates the self - ionization probability , since for a given mean @xmath23 in the region , internal density fluctuations increase the variance of the number of sources beyond a pure poisson distribution . for @xmath186 we can instead calculate a more accurate self - ionization probability by calculating a double integral over the joint normal distribution of @xmath187 and @xmath188 , the mean densities inside a one - source volume @xmath50 and inside the surrounding two - source volume , respectively .",
    "given @xmath187 and @xmath188 , the mean expected number of sources in the two regions is @xmath189 and @xmath190 , respectively , where @xmath62 and @xmath61 are the corresponding variances .",
    "the probability of self - ionization of the two - source volume is then the probability of having at least 2 total sources from the sum of a poisson distribution of mean @xmath191 plus a poisson distribution of mean @xmath192 ( except that the latter quantity is restricted to be non - negative , a key point which allows the larger fluctuations in @xmath191 to contribute ) .    calculating @xmath180 exactly for @xmath193 would require at least a triple integration , but",
    "since @xmath194 and @xmath186 are most important for estimating @xmath174 , we simply estimate the self - ionization probability for all @xmath193 with equation  ( [ eq : self ] ) .",
    "now , @xmath185 for any @xmath56 is itself only a lower limit for the ionization probability @xmath195 , since the region may be part of a larger h  ii bubble even if it can not fully ionize on its own .",
    "actually , when one - source bubbles dominate and @xmath195 drops rapidly with @xmath56 , regions are much more likely to self - ionize than to get ionization help from larger scales , and then @xmath180 becomes an accurate estimate of @xmath195 .",
    "however , in order to achieve reasonable accuracy also when multi - source bubbles are important , we add a correction to each @xmath180 based on the values of @xmath196 for @xmath197 .",
    "indeed , instead of just calculating @xmath196 , which is the probability of having at least @xmath26 sources in a region of size corresponding to @xmath26 sources , we can separately estimate @xmath198 , the probability of having exactly @xmath199 sources in that region , using a formula just like equation  ( [ eq : self ] ) but using the poisson probability of finding @xmath199 sources .",
    "then , for any number @xmath200 sources , we calculate the additional ionization probability that was not previously included in @xmath195 ( for each internal volume @xmath201 ) using the approximation that the @xmath199 sources are uniformly distributed within the volume @xmath26 . in this way",
    ", we estimate the probabilities @xmath202 and @xmath203 including the contributions of larger volumes with @xmath193 .",
    "when one - source bubbles dominate , higher-@xmath56 volumes have a small effect , but when multi - source bubbles dominate the effect adds up , and we cut off @xmath56 so that @xmath202 does not rise above the global ionization fraction @xmath204 . actually , we find that while the correction from higher-@xmath56 volumes can change each of @xmath202 and @xmath203 by up to a factor of a few ( giving results much closer to the full model a ) , the relative effect on their ratio is @xmath205 at most .    our estimate for @xmath174 is simply @xmath206 .",
    "the approximate calculation becomes exact in the limit @xmath207 , where our estimated probabilities @xmath185 become very small for all @xmath208 , while in the opposite limit , when @xmath209 all quantities become nearly independent of @xmath56 and thus our estimate for the ratio approaches unity , also correctly .",
    "in practice , from direct comparison with the monte carlo method at @xmath118 ranging from @xmath210 to 1 , and at ratios @xmath174 ranging from 1 to 200 , we find that our approximation for this ratio is accurate to @xmath211 ( though below we extrapolate it beyond the tested range ) .",
    "having developed a quick , relatively accurate calculation method , we can use it to explore which areas of parameter space will be dominated by one - source bubbles and which will form many multi - source bubbles .",
    "figures  [ f : scan1 ] and [ f : scan2 ] show the ratio @xmath174 in the approximate calculation , for @xmath118 ranging from 1 down to @xmath212 , over the whole relevant range of source masses , i.e. , assuming a minimum @xmath213 , 16.5 , 35 , 80 , or 285 km / s , and for four values of the efficiency @xmath32 , 19 , 95 , 580 , and 5800 .",
    "it is interesting to consider the whole parameter space , without normalizing to a particular reionization redshift , since the dominant population of ionizing sources at any given redshift may not have similar properties to that near the end of reionization , due to the evolution in time of chemical , radiative , and hydrodynamical feedbacks .    .",
    "for @xmath98 or 95 , as indicated , we consider galactic halos with minimum @xmath213 , 16.5 , 35 , 80 , or 285 km / s ( solid curves , from bottom to top ) . we compare to the case of a pure stochastic poisson distribution ( model e ; dotted curves ) . also shown",

    "note also that the various curves are not continued below @xmath214 ( for @xmath100 km / s ) or @xmath215 ( for the other cases).,width=317 ]     but for @xmath216 or 5800 , as indicated.,width=317 ]    the above values of @xmath32 are chosen to be particular interesting , where @xmath98 corresponds to @xmath97 for @xmath95 km / s , and @xmath101 corresponds to @xmath99 for @xmath100 km / s , which are the h and he reionization examples considered in the previous subsection . more generally for star - forming halos , population ii stars ( assumed similar to low - metallicity stars forming today ) produce @xmath217 ionizing photons per hydrogen atom in stars , while population iii stars ( assumed to consist of @xmath218 , zero - metallicity stars ) produce around 10 times more .",
    "thus , if we assume a maximum star formation efficiency of @xmath130 ( i.e. , that this fraction of the baryons in a halo are contained in stars ) , then if all ionizing photons escape out of the dense surroundings of the stars and the halo , we get a maximum possible @xmath219 , with pop iii stars .",
    "a value of @xmath216 can then represent several possibilities : perhaps only @xmath130 of photons escape , or @xmath220 escape but we assume pop ii stars , or we assume pop iii stars but with a star formation efficiency of only @xmath84 .",
    "the latter value is indeed the efficiency expected for the very first , primordial pop iii stars in molecular cooling halos .",
    "numerical simulations suggest that in each @xmath221 halo ( containing , therefore , @xmath222 in baryons ) , it is likely that only a single @xmath218 star forms @xcite before its feedback disrupts the rest of the halo gas and prevents the formation of additional stars , at least for some time .",
    "note also that these values of @xmath32 neglect recombinations , which can only lower the effective @xmath32 further .",
    "figures  [ f : scan1 ] and [ f : scan2 ] imply the general conclusion that ionizing sources produce isolated , single - source bubbles only quite early in reionization , when @xmath135 .",
    "this is a result of the fact that while poisson fluctuations are large when we consider just one or two sources , they are strongly modulated by halo bias due to the underlying density fluctuations .",
    "thus , sources are usually found in high - density regions , which makes it relatively likely to find other sources nearby .",
    "as sources become rarer at high redshift , the increasing correlation strength between halos partially compensates for the overall low number density of sources , though eventually the sheer rarity of sources does come to dominate . as discussed above",

    "<S> we consider the early stages of cosmic hydrogen or helium reionization , when ionizing sources were still rare . we show that poisson fluctuations in the galaxy distribution substantially affected the early bubble size distribution , although galaxy clustering was also an essential factor even at the earliest times . </S>",
    "<S> we find that even at high redshifts , a significant fraction of the ionized volume resided in bubbles containing multiple sources , regardless of the ionizing efficiency of sources or of the reionization redshift . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , for helium reionization by quasars , one - source bubbles last dominated ( i.e. , contained @xmath0 of the ionized volume ) at some redshift above @xmath1 , and hydrogen reionization by stars achieved this milestone at @xmath2 . for the early generations of atomic - cooling halos or molecular - hydrogen - cooling halos , one - source ionized regions dominated the ionized volume only at @xmath3 and @xmath4 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> to arrive at these results we develop a statistical model for the effect of density correlations and discrete sources on reionization and solve it with a monte carlo method .    [ firstpage ]    galaxies : high - redshift  cosmology : theory  galaxies : formation </S>"
