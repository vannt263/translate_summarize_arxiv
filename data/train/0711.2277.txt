    "is often described by fitting a band function @xcite .",
    "high energy neutrino emission by grbs in coincidence with the prompt @xmath0-ray photons has been proposed as a consequence of grbs being a candidate to produce ( uhe ) ultra high energy ( up to @xmath1  10@xmath5  ev ) cosmic rays @xcite .",
    "@xcite have calculated the diffuse flux due to grbs .",
    "their work has been further improved by calculating neutrino emission for individual bursts @xcite and by performing detailed geant4 simulations of proton - photon interactions in the internal shocks @xcite .",
    "this body of work supports the hypothesis that neutrino detection by km@xmath2 cherenkov detectors will probably be in coincidence with a handful of bright grbs .",
    "previous studies have correlated photon emission with neutrino emission by approximating the photon spectra with a broken power law .",
    "we will show that this approximation overestimates the contribution of high energy photons ( and conversely underestimates the contribution from low energy photons ) .",
    "this has consequences in the number of events expected by neutrino telescopes such as icecube @xcite and km3net @xcite and in the characteristic energy of the neutrinos detected .    in section ",

    "it is customary to approximate the band function fit to the average photon spectra as a broken power law ( which we label approximation _ a _ ) : @xmath26    supposing that protons have a power law spectrum @xmath27 , the neutrino spectrum traces eq.[eqn : bandapprox ] : @xmath28 where @xmath29 , @xmath30 and the neutrino break energy @xmath31 is taken from the minimum energy in eq.[eqn : nuphotoncorr ] : @xmath32 the spectrum is steeper above @xmath33 because of synchrotron energy losses by charged pions .",

    "muons also suffer from synchrotron losses , but following usual approximations we ignore this effect .",

    "depending on the spectral indices @xmath42 and @xmath43 , the neutrino normalization @xmath35 is independent or a very weak function of @xmath39 .",

    "the normalization of approximation a has been chosen so that the bolometric fluence matches that of the band function .",
    "this is a natural choice for setting the normalization , because the photon fluence is used in eq.[eqn : nunorm ] .",
    "it is quite clear that approximation a overestimates the contribution from high energy photons and underestimates the contribution from low energy photons .",
    "the reason why this occurs is because the break energy of the broken power law has been forced to match that of the band function",
    ".    it may be desirable ( e.g. to simplify calculations ) to have an alternative broken power law approximation .",
    "also we will use this new approximation , _ b _ , to illustrate the deficiencies of approximation a. a better choice for approximating the band function is to require that the asymptotic behavior ( for very large and very small @xmath49 ) of the broken power law matches the band function , while leaving the break energy for the broken power law a free parameter : @xmath50^{\\alpha_\\gamma-\\beta_\\gamma } e^{\\beta_\\gamma-\\alpha_\\gamma }    & e_\\gamma \\ge \\bar{\\epsilon}_\\gamma    \\end{array } \\right . .\\ ] ] the value of the _ effective _ break energy @xmath51 is given by the energy at which the two branches of the broken power law are equal to each other : @xmath52^{\\alpha_\\gamma -    \\beta_\\gamma } e^{\\beta_\\gamma - \\alpha_\\gamma}\\ ] ] which results in an effective break energy that is independent of the spectral indices : @xmath53 where @xmath54 is euler s number .",

    "for all grb locations in the sky we see that approximation a overestimates the expected number of events . for steeper angles",
    "the ratio is larger , because for approximation b the characteristic neutrino energy is higher and therefore earth s attenuation is higher .",
    "we have shown that the usual choice to describe the photon spectra in the calculation of neutrino fluxes from grbs overestimates the contribution of high energy photons ( and therefore contribution of low energy neutrinos is overestimated ) .",
    "this results in a higher exepected event rate by a factor of @xmath1  2 for all models that make this assumption .",
    "the actual value of the overestimation of the expected number of events depends on the matter column depth that neutrinos must cross through earth in the direction of the grb .",
    "also we have shown that the typical neutrino energy is @xmath1  10@xmath78  ev . the characteristic energy of neutrinos is a factor of @xmath54 larger than the values obtained by @xcite and a factor of 10 than the average value used by @xcite . for back of the envelope calculations we provide a new approximation to the band function that is adequate for the computation of neutrino spectra .",
    "@xcite have discussed the effects of muon and pion energy losses leading to neutrino flavor flux ratios ( at earth ) different than 1:1:1 .",
    "previous amanda searches for neutrinos @xcite , based on waxman - bahcall - like assumptions have argued that this effect is not important experimentally because the typical energy of the neutrinos detected is close to the neutrino break energy . because , as we have shown , the _ effective _ neutrino break energy is close to the typical syncrhotron energy break",
