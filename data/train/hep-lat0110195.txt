    "nearly all lattice studies with dynamical fermions rely on pseudofermion techniques .",
    "this includes the standard hybrid monte carlo method for non - local boson actions @xcite and more recently multiboson methods proposed by lscher @xcite and extended to odd flavors by borii and de forcrand @xcite . while these methods are presently the most efficient available for dynamical fermion calculations ,",
    "much improvement is still needed to combat algorithmic slowdown at light quark masses and large volumes .  on the more theoretical side",
    ", one would also like to understand the microscopic dynamics of quarks in lattice simulations .",
    "ideally one hopes to see the effects of confinement on quark - antiquark pair separation and the effects of chiral symmetry breaking on light quark mobility .",
    "these questions are most easily answered in a framework which does not integrate out the fermionic degrees of freedom .  with these goals in mind",
    "we investigate the possibility of simulating dynamical fermions in a confining gauge theory with explicit fermion dynamics .    in this proceedings article",
    "we describe the beginning of a research program at nc state to understand dynamical fermions within a hamiltonian framework .  as a testing ground we study compact qed@xmath0 , which exhibits confinement , glueballs , mesons , and chiral symmetry breaking .",
    "we discuss the methods that are being used and show preliminary data for the chiral condensate  and compare with strong and weak coupling results .",
    "we follow the notation used in @xcite and @xcite .  the hamiltonian is @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the lattice spacing and @xmath4 the dimensionless strong coupling constant",
    ", @xmath5 @xmath6 has three pieces , @xmath7 where @xmath8 \\nonumber\\\\ w_{2 }   & = -\\sum_{p}\\left (   u_{p}+u_{p}^{\\dagger}\\right )   \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath9 , @xmath10 .",
    "we use four component staggered fermions , which in the three - dimensional hamiltonian formalism gives one flavor of fermion .  the dimensionless mass parameter @xmath11 is given by @xmath12",
    "we start with a set of trial states @xmath13 and evaulate the quantities @xmath14   \\left| \\psi_{j}\\right\\rangle , \\\\ m_{ij}^{\\delta }   & = \\left\\langle \\psi_{i}\\right|   \\exp\\left [   -h(t+\\delta t)\\right ]   \\left|   \\psi_{j}\\right\\rangle .\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] improved trial states are given by @xmath15\\left|   \\psi _ { j}\\right\\rangle .\\ ] ] it is easy to see that @xmath16",

    "are generated a classical background field , @xmath26",
    "in our calculations we keep the lowest few energy fermionic states in computer memory and calculate their dynamics exactly by matrix multiplication .",
    "we use a simple heat bath algorithm to propose new gauge updates .",
    "these updates are performed by sweeps through the spatial lattice , taking each time slice in succession .",
    "we use a metropolis accept / reject decision based upon an estimator that includes the contribution of the low energy fermion states .  in comparison with quenched simulations ,",
    "the use of this estimator is slower by a constant factor proportional to the number of low energy fermion states .  after each sweep through all time slices , the contribution of other fermionic states are calculated using diffusion monte carlo sampling .    in our initial studies of small to mid - sized lattices we store in memory the nine lowest energy fermion states in memory , the strong coupling ground state and the eight translationally invariant states connected to the ground state by a single hop .  in figure 1",
    "we show results for @xmath27 .  the data is extrapolated from spatial lattice sizes @xmath28 , @xmath29 , and @xmath30 , and number of time slices @xmath31 , @xmath32 , and @xmath33 .",
    "the curves @xmath34 give the first few orders in the strong coupling expansion , and @xmath35 is the leading behavior in the weak coupling expansion .",
    "we find behavior consistent with strong coupling estimates at small @xmath4 and weak coupling estimate at large @xmath4 .",
    "we have described a first attempt to treat dynamical fermions within a hamiltonian framework .",
    "we considered compact qed@xmath0 , which shares some important features of qcd@xmath1 .  at this time it is too early to say whether this approach would be viable for qcd@xmath1 with relatively light quarks .",
    "we are currently making accuracy and efficiency comparisons with pseudofermion methods in qed@xmath0 @xcite for exactly massless fermions .    on the theoretical side",
    "there is clearly much potential in this approach to better understand the microscopic dynamics of quarks in lattice simulations .  in future work",
    "we plan to study the effects of confinement and chiral symmetry breaking on quark dynamics ."
