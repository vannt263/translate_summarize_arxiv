    "the x - ray spectra of many `` middle - aged '' and isolated neutron stars are dominated by a thermal component , so , besides temperatures and radii , they can in principle be used to measure the atmospheric composition .",
    "see @xcite for a summary of rosat observations of several neutron stars whose x - ray emission could be fitted to blackbody spectra .",
    "the composition can , in turn , affect the estimated temperature and size of the emission region @xcite but rosat spectra were insufficient to determine if there were spectral features that might be expected if cyclotron lines or heavy elements dominate the atmosphere .",
    "for example , @xcite showed that an iron - dominated atmosphere in a magnetic field as strong as @xmath7 g would show many narrow absorption features due to the distortion of the energy levels .",
    "psr b0656 + 14 is an isolated radio pulsar with a period of about 384 ms , found in the _ einstein _ ultrasoft x - ray survey by @xcite .",
    "rosat observations showed weak pulsations with an amplitude of @xmath8 14% @xcite and that the x - ray spectrum appeared to be well fit with a simple black body model with @xmath9 k. from longer rosat observations , @xcite found that the spectrum appeared slightly more complex and that the pulse shape changes with energy .",
    "@xcite fitted a two component model to the pulse light curve and x - ray spectrum , suggesting that the hotter component is emission from the poles and the cooler part comes from the equator but the hotter component could instead be modelled by a steep power law component with @xmath10 ( where @xmath11 ) .",
    "@xcite found a somewhat lower temperature by combining _ euve _ , _ rosat _ , and optical data .",
    "@xcite required two black body components as well as a hard power law ( @xmath12 ) to describe the _ asca _ spectra extending to 5 kev .",
    "the distance estimated from the pulsar s dispersion measure is 760 pc @xcite .",
    "we observed psr b0656 + 14 using the chandra low energy grating spectrometer ( letgs ) in order to detect narrow x - ray lines in absorption that might be observed if the atmosphere is dominated by iron .",
    "the energies of these absorption features should depend on the average magnetic field strength , so we used the high resolution camera spectroscopy ( hrc - s ) detector which provide event timing to better than 10 @xmath13s in order to obtain pulse phased spectra .",
    "we find no strong spectral lines and show that the letgs data are consistent with the previous results ; the continuum is well fit by a model involving two black body components .",
    "pulse phased spectra are used to search for spectral features that might be phase dependent .",
    "psr b0656 + 14 was observed with the letgs on 28 november 1999 ( jd - 2451000 .",
    "= 510.99 - 511.43 ) .",
    "the level 0 were processed with ciao version 2.0b .",
    "the exposure time was 38167 s. the count rate in zeroth order was consistent with 0.19 count / s for the entire observation .",
    "the bandpass for the zeroth order image is hard to define due to the low energy resolution of the hrc - s , so we estimated the energy range over which one may integrate the spectrum - weighted effective area to obtain 90% of the observed count rate : 0.20 - 0.75 kev . to obtain 99% of the total count rate , the bandpass should be extended to 0.16 - 1.0 kev .",
    "the resultant image was azimuthally symmetric , as expected for a point source .",
    "we tested the radial distribution of events against that of a comparable letg / hrc - s observation of a point source : capella ( observation i d 1248 ) . due to the dispersion by the fine and coarse support structure ,",
    "the point response function of the letgs zeroth order image depends slightly on the spectrum of the source .",
    "the zeroth order image yielded 180440 events within 5  of the centroid in 85260 s. the spectrum of capella is soft but is harder than that of the pulsar , so we divided the data into two equal parts based on the pulse height distribution .",
    "the average pulse height for the low half is quite similar to that of psr  b0656 + 14 , but the radial profile differs by no more than 1.5% from the average profile using all events so we used the average profile for comparison to the pulsar .",
    "the encircled power was modelled as the sum of gaussian and exponential components , representing the capella data to better than 1.5% over the 0 - 5  range : @xmath14 +      f [ 1-e^{\\theta/\\theta_0 } ]   , \\ ] ]    where @xmath15 is the angle from the centroid , @xmath16 is the fraction of the power in the exponential component , @xmath17 is the gaussian width parameter of the point spread function ( psf ) , and @xmath18 is the scaling length of the exponential component .",
    "capella is very bright , so the background has a negligible contribution ( @xmath19 1% ) to the radial profile out to 5  from the source centroid . for the pulsar ,",
    "background was estimated from an annulus 8 - 10  from the source centroid .    the cumulative event radial profiles are given in fig .",
    "[ fig : radialprofile ] .",
    "the profiles are normalized to unity at 5 .",
    "the pulsar s radial distribution differs from capella s by @xmath8 8.5% at 0.5 , indicating that the x - ray source may consist of a point source and some distributed emission that is extended on a scale of order 0.5 .",
    "a smirnov test indicates that a 5% difference between the capella and psr  b0656 + 14 profiles would be significant at the @xmath20 level and that differences of 1.6% are significant at the 2@xmath21 level .",
    "we modelled the profile by combining a gaussian model of the extended emission with a psf model .",
    "the model of the extended emission was constructed using the psf model but increasing the gaussian width parameter by combining a second term in quadrature , @xmath22 .",
    "the model for the pulsar s radial distribution is matched to about 2% when @xmath23  and the extended component comprises 50% of the total power .",
    "the uncertainties are difficult to characterize and are probably dominated by systematic uncertainties in the psf . given the possible systematic uncertainties in these early hrc - s imaging data , we estimate that an unresolved source accounts for @xmath24 50% of the profile and that the fwhm of the extended emission is in the range of 0.2 - 0.5 .",
    "the zeroth order image was used to determine the phase and period of the x - ray pulsations . after applying timing corrections to the solar system barycenter and correcting for the satellite s position in orbit",
    ", we determined that the pulse period was 384.8990 ms with a 1 @xmath21 uncertainty of 0.0010 ms using a @xmath25 test on folded light curves .",
    "this period is consistent with the predicted value , 384.89970 ms from radio pulse monitoring ( andrew lyne , 2001 , priv .",
    "communication ) . the pulse light curve shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : pulse ] was folded using the radio ephemeris .",
    "the pulse appears to be asymmetric , as previously found by @xcite .",
    "the modulation amplitude is 10 @xmath0 2% , defined as @xmath26 , where @xmath27 and @xmath28 are the maximum and minimum of the pulse light curve , respectively .",
    "this value is consistent with the pulse fractions obtained by @xcite ( 14 @xmath0 2% ) and @xcite ( 9 @xmath0 1% ) .",
    "the radio phase is defined so that the peak of the radio pulse occurs at a phase of zero .",
    "[ fig : pulse ] shows that the x - ray peak is at about phase 0.85 , which is about 55  out of phase with the radio phase .",
    "the absolute timing hrc - s has been verified to an accuracy of @xmath19 0.001 s using the crab pulsar ( allyn tennant , 2001 , priv .",
    "comm . ) .",
    "the spectral data were reduced from standard event lists using idl using custom processing scripts ; the method is quite similar to standard processing using ciao .",
    "the procedure was to : 1 ) select data based on the criteria suggested by the chandra x - ray center ( cxc ) letgs calibration team in order to reduce background , 2 ) determine the location of zeroth order using one dimensional profiles fitted to gaussians , 3 ) rotate events from sky coordinates to compensate for the telescope roll and correct for a 0.54  offset between hrc - s plates 0 and 1 , 4 ) compute the dispersed grating coordinates ( @xmath29 and @xmath15 ) using the grating dispersion angles and the dispersion relation , 5 ) select `` source '' events spatially within oppositely curving parabolas of the dispersion line as suggested by the cxc letg calibration team , 6 ) eliminate data affected by detector gaps , and 7 ) bin events at @xmath300.025 .",
    "the effective area ( ea ) of the letgs has undergone a few revisions since launch both due to a recalculation of the letg efficiencies and due to a long series of in - flight calibration observations designed to probe the hrc - s quantum efficiency .",
    "we started with the updated letgs ea that was released by the cxc of 31 october 2000 .",
    "these letg efficiencies were used , along with the transmission models of the uv ion shield , to determine the effective areas for orders 2 through 5 . in a final step ,",
    "an adjustment to the pre - flight calibration was applied which was derived from an analysis of the spectrum of mrk 478 @xcite and pks 2155 - 304 ( marshall et al .",
    "2002 , in preparation ) .",
    "the spectra of both targets are well fit by a simple power law with galactic absorption .",
    "the adjustments affect primarily the spectrum at low energies ( @xmath31 kev ) , where high order contributions are beginning to be important .    directly totalling the observed fluxes over the 0.2 - 3.0 kev band",
    "gives an observed flux of 1.01 @xmath32 erg @xmath33 s@xmath4 for an absorbed luminosity of 7.0 @xmath34 erg s@xmath4 .",
    "the data were rebinned adaptively to provide a signal / noise ratio of 5 in each bin over the 0.10 to 2.0 kev range .",
    "the spectrum , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : spectrum ] , was estimated using the first order ea only .",
    "the contributions to the observed counts due to high orders are estimated by folding a model for first order through the high order ea and dividing by the first order ea .",
    "this procedure has the disadvantage that all the spectral features in the high order eas are apparent but the advantage is that the result will match the intrinsic spectrum well if first order dominates . for this source ,",
    "high orders are negligible above 0.20 kev .",
    "following previous analyses , we modelled the continuum with two blackbody components .",
    "our objective is primarily to define a smooth continuum model to use as a baseline for line searches .",
    "we did not include the hard power law component found by @xcite because its contribution in the 0.2 - 1.0 kev band is negligible .",
    "we exclude the data below 0.15 kev from the fit where uncertainties in the high order grating efficiencies can be important .",
    "gaussian statistics could be used for continuum modelling by rebinning to obtain a signal / noise ratio of at least 5 in each bin , giving reduced @xmath35 , acceptable at the 90% level .",
    "the distribution of the residuals is not consistent with a gaussian , however ; the kolmogorov test rejects at the 99.99% confidence level due to systematic skewing of the residuals to positive values .",
    "this may result from systematic errors at the 5 - 10% level in the 0.45 - 0.55 kev portion of the spectrum .",
    "the best fit temperatures of the two blackbody components were @xmath36 and @xmath37 k and the radii were 22.5 @xmath0 2.1 and 1.7 @xmath0 1.0 km , respectively .",
    "the best - fit interstellar medium ( ism ) column density , @xmath38 , was @xmath39 @xmath33 .",
    "these parameters are close to those found by @xcite .",
    "the best fit model is plotted against the fitted data in fig .",
    "[ fig : spectrum ] . the count spectrum ( fig .",
    "[ fig : countspec ] ) was binned at 0.125   resolution in order to search for narrow spectral features against the continuum model .",
    "no significant absorption features were found .",
    "a fit to a nonmagnetized h atmosphere @xcite gave a much lower temperature , 230000 k , a very large radius , 413 @xmath0 53 km and a much larger @xmath38 , @xmath40 @xmath33 .",
    "the data were divided into pulse maximum and minimum by phase : 0.05 - 0.55 and 0.55 - 1.05 ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : pulse ] ) . the difference spectrum ( fig .",
    "[ fig : specdiff ] ) shows a dip in the 45 - 50   region .",
    "the pulse amplitude spectrum was defined as the ratio of the difference spectrum to the model of the pulse - averaged spectrum and is also shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : specdiff ] .",
    "the result is rather flat , consistent with being constant over this wavelength band .",
    "models of a neutron star atmosphere dominated by fe in a strong magnetic field , such as computed by @xcite , should show deep narrow features which we do not observe . for a hydrogen atmosphere",
    ", however , there are very few spectral features but the radius of the fitted nonmagnetized h atmosphere is much too large . in order to reduce the apparent radius to 13 km ( appropriate for a neutron star with a mass of 1.4 @xmath41 and a radius of 10 km ) , the distance would have to be absurdly small  24 pc  given the large @xmath38 and the large distance from the dispersion measure .",
    "for the blackbody model , however , the distance would have to be about 440 pc , which is consistent with the estimate from the pulsar s dispersion measure .",
    "for a magnetized h atmosphere , results are similar to the case with @xmath42 but are not quite so extreme .",
    "@xcite found that the _ rosat _ spectrum of geminga fit a blackbody with @xmath43 k while a magnetized h atmosphere gave @xmath44 k for @xmath45 g. the magnetic field estimated for psr  b0656 + 14 is the same @xcite , so one might expect a similar reduction when fitting the psr b0656 + 14 spectrum . in order to generate the same observed flux",
    ", the radius of the emission region would have to increase by a factor of 2.3 to 52 @xmath0 5 km so the distance would have to be reduced to 190 pc . a distance to less than 200 pc",
    "can be definitely ruled out using the dispersion measure and a more refined model of the local ism ( j. cordes , 2002 , private communication ) .",
    "we find no significant absorption features in the pulse - averaged or pulse - phased spectra over the 0.15 - 0.80 kev band .",
    "thus , we can rule out electron and proton cyclotron resonance lines , which should be rather deep and possibly broadened , according to models by @xcite and @xcite",
    ". the proton cyclotron line would be expected at an observed energy @xmath46 kev , where @xmath47 g ) and @xmath48 is the surface redshift .",
    "substituting the electron mass for the proton mass , @xmath49 , gives the electron cyclotron line energy @xmath50 kev .",
    "thus , we eliminate the ranges @xmath51 and @xmath52 if @xmath53 ( for a neutron star of 1.4 m@xmath54 and a radius of 10 km ) .",
    "these ranges do not exclude the magnetic field estimate from the dipole braking model : @xmath55 @xcite .",
    "the lower limits can be reduced if the bulk of the emission comes from the equatorial zone where the magnetic field is @xmath56% of the polar value or if the absorbing plasma is far off of the neutron surface .    for this dipole field estimate , a light element atmosphere should show h or he ionization edges in the 0.15 - 0.80 kev bandpass .",
    "@xcite give an estimate for the ionization edge energy and its dependence on the atomic number @xmath57 : @xmath58 ^ 2 { \\rm ~~ev}\\ ] ]    where @xmath59 g. a he i edge would be expected in the 0.5 - 0.7 kev range .",
    "we do not detect this edge , which may not be surprising , as helium may have settled in the atmosphere to high optical depths . for surface temperatures of 9 - 22 @xmath60 k",
    "( allowing for variation between the pole and the equator ) , he is almost completely neutral while h is 7 - 22% ionized .",
    "so , we expect to find the h i edge between 0.20 and 0.25 kev ( depending on the surface gravity ) but it is not observed .",
    "the spectrum is dominated by the cooler thermal component , however , which is presumably emission from the equatorial zone in which @xmath61 is @xmath62 weaker than at the pole .",
    "thus , the edge may be found in the 0.16 - 0.21 kev region , where the signal / noise ratio is poor and high order contributions to the letgs spectrum become important .",
    "most of a pulsar s spin - down luminosity is thought to be carried off as a relativistic electron / positron wind .",
    "when this wind is confined by external pressure , a shock forms and the relativistic particles radiate synchrotron emission in the form of a pulsar wind nebula ( pwn ) .",
    "the crab nebula ( hester et al . 1995 , weisskopf et al . 2000 ) is the best known example .",
    "pwne have been observed around at least 6 pulsars so far @xcite .",
    "claims from asca observations of vastly extended pwne ( @xmath63 10 - 20 ) in this and other pulsars with luminosities of the order of @xmath64 erg s@xmath4 have not been confirmed by _",
    "rosat _ and _ bepposax _ @xcite .",
    "we also do not detect such a large extended nebula around psr b0656 + 14 .",
    "the image appears slightly extended , consistent with a point source comprising @xmath65% of the total 0.1 - 3 kev luminosity .",
    "the remainder , with an unabsorbed luminosity of @xmath3 erg s@xmath4 can be modelled with a gaussian with a fwhm of 0.75corresponding to a size of 8.5 @xmath1 cm .",
    "this extended emission is consistent with the result of @xcite , who found that a pwn around psr b0656 + 14 must have an extent of less than 10 . based on its spin - down age , @xmath66 yr",
    ", psr b0656 + 14 is an order of magnitude older than the vela pulsar , the oldest pulsar around which a pwn has been detected @xcite .",
    "if we assume a similar emission efficiency for psr b0656 + 14 as for the vela pular ( @xmath67 ) , we can set an upper limit to the expected luminosity of the pwn of 1.5@xmath68 erg s@xmath4 , consistent with the observed value .",
