    "despite the effort that has been devoted to the investigation of blue compact dwarf galaxies ( bcds ) , the origin of their recurrent starburst activity as well as its impact on their spectrophotometric and dynamical evolution is still poorly understood .",
    "a thorough investigation of these processes is required before questions pertaining to evolutionary connections among dwarf irregulars ( dis ) , dwarf ellipticals ( des ) and bcds ( thuan @xcite , davies & phillipps @xcite , papaderos et al .",
    "1996b ; hereafter @xcite , patterson & thuan @xcite , salzer & norton @xcite , marlowe et al .",
    "@xcite , @xcite ) can be answered .",
    "deep imaging of the low surface brightness ( lsb ) component of bcds , discovered first by loose & thuan ( 1985 ; hereafter @xcite ) , disclosed an evolved stellar population underlying the regions of active star formation ( sf ) ( loose & thuan @xcite , kunth et al .",
    "@xcite , papaderos et al .",
    "1996a ; hereafter @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , the initial hypothesis that bcds are `` extragalactic regions '' lacking an older stellar population ( sargent & searle @xcite ) had to be dismissed for the majority of these systems .",
    "an exception to this finding is made by a tiny fraction ( @xmath2 1% ) of young galaxy candidates which recently have been identified among bcds ( thuan et al .",
    "@xcite , papaderos et al .",
    "@xcite , thuan & izotov @xcite ) .",
    "there is increasing observational evidence that such systems , invariably found among the most metal ",
    "deficient ( @xmath3 1/20 @xmath4 , thuan & izotov @xcite , izotov & thuan @xcite ) members of the bcd class , have started forming the bulk of their stellar component less than 100 myr ago .",
    "this qualifies them as local counterparts of primeval galaxies , i.e. the first galactic building blocks which are thought to have formed at high redshifts .",
    "it seems meaningful to search among the variety of dwarf galaxies for possible successors of young galaxies , i.e. objects in a more evolved stage with a substantial fraction of their masses still in gaseous form . an age sequence built therefrom would allow to study the evolution of nearby dwarf galaxies , which may at the same time give clues to early galaxy evolution processes at high redshift .",
    "this is of great interest for the assessment of the starburst  driven evolution of young galaxies , some of which may become the building blocks of larger systems and for the understanding of issues like the faint blue galaxy excess at intermediate redshifts ( babul & rees @xcite , koo et al .",
    "@xcite , guzmn et al .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "loose & thuan ( 1985 ) developed a morphological classification scheme for bcds and found that @xmath1 90% of their sample is made up of ie and ne  objects .",
    "these show , respectively , an irregular or nuclear starburst component superposed on a smooth elliptical lsb host galaxy with optical colours pointing to ages of several gyr ( loose & thuan @xcite , @xcite , telles & terlevich @xcite , noeske @xcite ) .",
    "in contrast , the few members of the rare class of i0 bcds examined so far have been found to be young galaxy candidates ( thuan et al .",
    "1997 , papaderos et al .",
    "@xcite , thuan & izotov @xcite , izotov et al .",
    "@xcite ) , as they apparently lack a smooth stellar underlying component that would have required previous episodes of sf to be built .",
    "only the class of ii bcds , characterized by both irregular lsb components and starburst regions , has not yet been studied systematically .",
    "this paper focuses on the subset of ii , c bcds ( @xcite ) where `` c '' denotes a _ cometary _ appearance caused by a bright star  forming complex at one end of an elongated stellar galactic body ( see figs .",
    "[ bi_maps ] and [ mk59_bslit ] ) .    in the notation of salzer et al .",
    "( @xcite ) an ii , c bcd is to be included in the class of hotspot galaxies ; these systems seem to systematically differ from other subclasses of galaxies with respect to the metallicities and excitation properties of their ionized gas .",
    ".[obs_ca ] ground  based imaging [ cols=\"<,^,>,^ , < , < \" , ]     surface brightness profiles ( sbps ) are the result of a transformation of a galaxy s 2dimensional flux pattern into a monotonically decreasing 1dimensional intensity distribution . for a set of methods to compute the photometric radius @xmath5 ,",
    "i.e. the radius of a circle with an area equal to the one enclosed by the isophote at the surface brightness level @xmath6 $ ] , see e.g. loose & thuan ( 1986 ) and @xcite .",
    "the method of summing up the area defined by pixels with fluxes exceeding a threshold @xmath7(@xmath8 ) ( method iii ; @xcite ) was considered most appropriate for the bcds analyzed here as both their underlying and starburst components are of irregular morphology .",
    "other techniques , such as isophote integration or ellipse fitting , though well suited for more regular bcds , are hardly applicable to the optical images of and , mainly due to the fact that their high surface brightness components split into many star - forming regions occupying a substantial fraction of the host galaxy s surface .    for each surface brightness level @xmath8 ,",
    "the number @xmath9 of all pixels within a polygonal aperture with a count level @xmath10 was determined ; the corresponding photometric radius is @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the solid angle per pixel in @xmath13 .",
    "numerical simulations showed that for the technique described above poisson photon noise may cause a systematic flattening of sbps at a signal to noise @xmath14 level @xmath15 .",
    "this frequently observed artificial profile flattening could be , however , satisfactorily corrected down to a @xmath16 level of @xmath17 by using the adaptive filtering algorithm implemented in midas ( see richter et al .",
    "1991 for a description ) .",
    "the uncertainties at each photometric radius were calculated taking into account the corresponding intensity , the sky noise of each image , and the number of pixels involved in its calculation ( cf .",
    "colour profiles were computed by subtracting sbps from each other ; the surface brightness and colour profiles displayed in figure  3 are corrected for interstellar extinction ( cf .",
    "section  [ obred_ca ] ) .    unlike stellar systems like globular clusters and giant ellipticals where the mass to light ( @xmath18 ) ratio may be regarded nearly constant over the whole system , the integrated luminosity of bcds originates from two distinct stellar populations with substantially different ages and @xmath18 ratios .",
    "although the lsb component contributes on average one half of the total @xmath19 band luminosity of a bcd ( @xcite , salzer & norton 1998 ) , it contains most of the stellar mass of the system .",
    "therefore , its intensity distribution yields information on the inner gravitational potential within which the starburst ignites and evolves . in order to disentangle the light distribution of the older host galaxy from the one of the superimposed starburst component",
    ", we applied a simple 2component decomposition scheme adjusted interactively to each profile , instead of iteratively fitting the full nonlinear 3component scheme described in @xcite .",
    "the intensity distribution of the lsb component is approximated by an exponential fitting law of the form @xmath20 or equivalently @xmath21 where @xmath22 denotes its exponential scale length in arcsec and @xmath8 the surface brightness level in mag/@xmath13 .",
    "equation ( [ linfit ] ) was adjusted to each profile by applying an error weighted linear fit to the data , at radii sufficiently large to be free from the contamination of the starburst light , i.e. where the colour profiles become constant and h@xmath22 emission vanishes .",
    "to check at which surface brightness levels gaseous emission becomes negligible , we overlaid the h@xmath22 emission and @xmath23h@xmath24 maps with broad band isophotes ( cf . figs .",
    "[ bi_maps ] and [ mk71_hb ] ) .",
    "the fits , obtained at radii @xmath2576@xmath26 for and @xmath25160@xmath26 for , yield the extrapolated central surface brightness @xmath27 and the exponential scale length @xmath22 . the radial surface brightness distribution of the starburst component can be computed from the residual luminosity in excess of the fit eq .",

    "exposures taken in the same filter were co  added and corrected for cosmic ray events using the stsdas package and iraf .",

    "the region within ( figure1 ; right ) was centered on the pc / wf1 chip ( instrumental scale of 0046/pixel ) , allowing the resolution of compact groups of stars with a mean linear separation of @xmath1 0.8 pc .",
    "we utilized the pc1 data to derive cmds in order to further constrain the results of the spectral population synthesis analysis ( section 3.3 ) using the daophotii stellar photometry package under eso midas .",
    "a model for the point spread function ( psf ) , necessary for performing multiple  psf fitting in crowded fields , was computed from several isolated bright stars in each frame .",
    "because of the severe crowding within some regions of as well as local background variations due to strong gaseous emission , we evaluated the photometric uncertainties and completeness limits of the resulting point - source identification files , taking into account the error growth towards fainter luminosities and the magnitude histograms ( cf .",
    "figure [ compl_pc ] ) .    the measured fluxes were calibrated and transformed to the johnson @xmath19 and @xmath34 filters as described in the previous section .",
    "the luminosity functions of the detected point sources ( figure [ compl_pc ] , left panel ) suggest a reasonable completeness for sources brighter than @xmath35 26 mag in both @xmath19 and @xmath34 .",
    "faintwards of the latter magnitude cutoff the photometric errors become dominant ( see figure [ cmds ] ) .",
    "close to the detection limit , an additional error source is introduced by the small  scale variations of the background due to gaseous emission as well as strong noise peaks which possibly are misinterpreted as faint stars ( cf .",
    "the excess counts at low luminosities in the upper left panel of figure [ compl_pc ] ) .",
    "we shall therefore consider the data reliable down to a limit of @xmath1 25 mag in @xmath19 and @xmath34 , close to the one drissen et al .",
    "( @xcite ) obtain for the same data set .",
    "this cutoff is sufficient for our purposes ; from a simple comparison of data points and isochrones it becomes evident that , given the photometric errors and poor time resolution of the @xmath36 cmd , no firm conclusions on the sf history can be drawn for ages @xmath37 50 myr .",
    "a second cmd was derived in the same way for a region on the wf4 chip apparently free of any appreciable signatures of current sf ( marked in figure [ bi_maps ] ) to obtain information on the galaxy s underlying stellar population separately . from an inspection of the right panels of figure [ compl_pc ] , and from the considerations referring to the cmd of we",

    "we found that five objects for which the required data are available share similar properties with and with respect to the results ( 1 )  ( 2 ) .",
    "these findings suggest that the specific starburst morphology observed in ii , c bcds comes along with distinct physical properties of their lsb host galaxies , i.e. is not attributable to stochastic processes only .",
    "hypotheses which we consider worth investigating are :    \\(i ) cometary bcds are relatively young objects , with ages not exceeding a few gyr , thus systematically younger than `` classical '' bcds of type ie / ne . if true , the development of ii , c morphology may represent a late evolutionary stage of an i0 bcd before it gradually assumes ie / ne  characteristics .",

    "<S> `` cometary '' blue compact dwarf galaxies ( ii , c bcds ) are characterized by an off  </S>",
    "<S> center starburst close to the end of their elongated stellar bodies . </S>",
    "<S> this rare phenomenon may carry some clues on how collective star formation ignites and propagates in gas  rich low  mass stellar systems . </S>",
    "<S> this off  center burst may be a fortuitous enhancement of the otherwise moderate star  forming activity of a dwarf irregular ( di ) , or may be caused by a set of special properties of such systems or their environment . </S>",
    "<S> we attempt here a first investigation of this issue by analysing two prototypical examples of cometary dwarf galaxies , the nearby ii , c bcds and , both containing an extraordinarily luminous region in the outskirts of a di  like host . using deep ground  </S>",
    "<S> based spectrophotometric data@xmath0 and hst images , we study the physical state of the starburst regions and the structural properties of the underlying irregular galaxies . we find that the average metallicities show small scatter in the vicinity of the star - forming regions and along the major axis of which suggests that mixing of heavy elements must have been efficient on scales of several kpc . </S>",
    "<S> the azimuthally averaged radial intensity distributions of the underlying host galaxies in either ii , c bcd can be approximated by an exponential law with a central surface brightness and scale length that is intermediate between typical ie / ne bcds and dwarf irregulars . </S>",
    "<S> spectral population synthesis models in combination with colour magnitude diagrams and colour profiles yield a most probable formation age of @xmath1 2 gyr for the low surface brightness ( lsb ) host galaxies in both ii , c bcds , with upper age limits of @xmath1 4 gyr for and @xmath1 3 gyr for , i.e. significantly lower than the typical age of several gyr derived for the lsb component of ie / ne bcds . </S>",
    "<S> these findings raise the question whether ii , c systems form a distinct physical class within bcds with respect to the age and structural properties of their hosts , or whether they represent an evolutionary stage connecting young i0 bcds and `` classical '' ie / ne bcds . in spite of the scarcity of available data , a review of the properties of analogous objects studied in the local universe and at medium redshifts provides some support for this evolutionary hypothesis . </S>"
