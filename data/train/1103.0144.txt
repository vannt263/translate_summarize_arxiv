    "so , we estimate the success probability of the ct of superposition and cpt as @xmath98 ( considering @xmath99 as the probability of the ideal bell - state measurement without necessity of additional rotations ) , which results in one successful controlled teleportation event every @xmath100s . the same estimative is obtained for the preparation of the two atoms entangled state . in the case of tc of entanglement",
