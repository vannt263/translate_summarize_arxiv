    "<S> although many works have been done on the subject , the use of non - extensive statistics in hadronic physics remains rather controversial .    </S>",

    "<S> [ nonext ] , resulting in @xmath20 since experiments report data for relatively small ranges of rapidity this can be considered an appropriate approximation .    in fig .  </S>",

    "<S> it is also clear that the values found here for @xmath29 and @xmath30 satisfy eq .  </S>",
    "<S> [ tqrelat ] .    in conclusion , this work presents an extensive analysis of @xmath0-distribution from @xmath1 collisions at ultrarelativistic energies in order to test the predictions of the non - extensive self - consistent theory proposed in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the results show a limiting effective temperature @xmath21  mev and a limiting entropic index @xmath22 .    also the theoretical mass spectrum is compared with the available data resulting in good agreement between calculation and data for @xmath3452@xmath357@xmath41  mev and @xmath361.103@xmath350.007 . </S>",
    "<S> these values are within the range of the values @xmath29 and @xmath30 found in @xmath0-distribution analysis .    </S>",
    "<S> finally , the relation between @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath24 shows that the results obtained in the present work are in agreement with the critical temperature predicted in lattice qcd calculations .    with these results it is possible to observe that the non - extensive self - consistent thermodynamical approach can describe the main features of the hadronic system formed in high energy collisions . </S>",
    "<S> we do not claim that it describes all possible aspects of the problem , since this thermodynamical theory deals only with a system in its stationary state and therefore it is not supposed to explain what happens before this state is reached nor what happens after the freeze - out .    </S>",
    "<S> the results obtained here allow a complete thermodynamical description of dilute hadronic systems . </S>",
    "<S> with this description one can , for instance , compares the predictions of the non - extensive self - consistent theory with lattice - qcd results  @xcite . in addition </S>",
    "<S> , this work indicates that microscopical mechanisms that lead to non - extensivity should be included in resonance hadron gas models . </S>",
    "<S> some hints on how to pursue this objective can be found in refs .  </S>",
