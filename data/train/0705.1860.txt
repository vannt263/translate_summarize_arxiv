    "fueled by rapid advances in detector technology , enabling fast and accurate mapping of large areas of the sky , extragalactic astrophysics is enjoying a golden age where astronomers have become spoiled for choice with the enormous statistical survey data sets available probing out to cosmologically significant distances such as the optical sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) covering one quarter of the sky @xcite , the near infrared ukirt infrared deep sky survey ( ukidss , 4000 square degrees @xcite ) and the _ spitzer _ wide - area infrared extragalactic survey ( swire , @xcite ) . the most basic tool for the study of cosmological galaxy evolution is the monochromatic ( single band ) number count of extragalactic sources .",
    "however aside from source counts and clustering analysis of large scale structure , deeper investigation into the extragalactic population and cosmological evolution will inevitable require multi - wavelength analysis and hence galaxy colours .",
    "ultimately we would like to define the extragalactic zoo species by species and derive their corresponding distances to determine the star - formation rate and sequence of structure formation in the universe .",
    "however such studies often involve extremely time intensive follow up campaigns with either deep imaging or spectroscopy . as an intermediate step ,",
    "galaxy colours have been frequently used to gain a cheap yet effective insight into galaxy populations and rough distances at a fraction of the cost of large scale follow - up campaigns .",
    "such colour analysis has been extremely effective in selecting and segregating populations of sources in the near - infrared , optical and ultra - violet wavebands ( e.g. the lyman break population @xcite , ero & _ bzk _ sources @xcite ) . at infrared wavelengths",
    "astronomers have often had to work with fewer bands and less well behaved detectors , yet the colour criteria has also been applied with great success in the mid - far - infrared with the pioneering _ iras _",
    "mission s all - sky survey @xcite .",
    "using simple colour criteria , @xcite , @xcite created a parameterization of the extragalactic population based on the _ iras _ infrared colours in four bands .",
    "within this framework , a normal galaxy component was defined by cool 100@xmath0m/60@xmath0 m colours , a starburst component defined by warm 100@xmath0m/60@xmath0 m colours extending to an ultraluminous component at higher infrared luminosities and an agn component was defined by high 25@xmath0m/60@xmath0 m colours due to strong emission from the mid - infrared dust torus .",
    "two decades after the _ iras _ all - sky survey , the japanese _ akari _ mission ( launched successfully on februrary 21st 2006 , formerly known as _ astro - f _ ) will perform a new all - sky survey in 4 far - infrared and 2 mid - infrared bands to much improved sensitivity , higher spatial resolution and wider wavelength coverage @xcite .",
    "akari is equipped with a 68.5 cm cooled telescope @xcite and two focal plane instruments , the far - infrared surveyor ( fis ) and the infrared camera ( irc ) .",
    "the fis has two 2-dimensional detector arrays and observes in four far - infrared bands between 50 and 180 @xmath0 m ( centred on n60 ( 65@xmath0 m ) , wide - s ( 90@xmath0 m ) ,",
    "wide - l ( 140@xmath0 m ) , n160 ( 160@xmath0 m ) , @xcite ) .",
    "the irc consists of three cameras covering 1.7 26 @xmath0 m in 9 bands ( n2 ( 2.4@xmath0 m ) , n3 ( 3.2@xmath0 m ) , n4 ( 4.1@xmath0 m ) , s7 ( 7@xmath0 m ) , s9w ( 9@xmath0 m ) , s11 ( 11@xmath0 m ) , l15 ( 15@xmath0 m ) , l18w ( 18@xmath0 m ) , l24 ( 24@xmath0 m ) ) with fields of view of approximately 10@xmath1 @xmath2 10@xmath1 @xcite .",
    "both the fis and irc instruments also have capabilities for spectroscopy .",
    "in addition to the all - sky survey , _ akari _ will also perform deep pointed surveys over areas of one to ten square degrees at the north ( nep ) and south ( sep ) ecliptic poles @xcite .",
    "these major legacy surveys are expected to yield hundreds of thousands of sources and thus require a major data reduction effort . as a precursor to these surveys ,",
    "the aim of this work is to investigate the feasibility of colour segregation of the infrared populations with the minimum peripheral data and effort as possible in a similar manner to the _ iras _ survey .",
    "our colour segregation criteria will have merits not only for the _ akari _ data sets but also for similar large data sets expected from the _ spitzer _ & _ herschel _ missions . in this paper",
    "we concentrate on the deep region selected for the _ akari _ sep survey while a more detailed investigation of our methods and their applications will be reported in @xcite .",
    "to model the colours of the extragalactic populations we have gathered a selection of spectral energy distribution ( sed ) templates for various galaxy populations from four large readily available contemporary spectral libraries .",
    "computational constraints from our simulations restricts us from utilizing entire sets of thousands of seds so rather we have selected a moderate sub - sample which spans the entire range of spectral properties of the libraries .",
    "the selected sets of seds specifically model the quiescent normal galaxy population , the starburst population ( increasing in luminosity : starburst , luminous infrared galaxies ( lirg ) , ultra - luminous infrared galaxies ( ulirg ) ) and the agn population . to model the quiescent normal galaxy population we have selected spectral templates from the libraries described in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the models of @xcite provide good fits to the _ iras _ , _ iso _ and _ spitzer _ selected samples of the cool , quiescent galaxy population @xcite as well as the cold component of the sub - millimetre source population @xcite and the galaxy source counts from sub - millimetre to near - infrared wavelengths @xcite .",
    "the model templates of dale et al . have been shown to provide good fits to local normal galaxies from both _",
    "iso _ and more recently _ spitzer _ selected samples @xcite , high - z spitzer sources @xcite and the _ iso _ & _ spitzer _ mid - infrared source counts @xcite . the starburst , lirg , ulirg population seds are taken from the radiative transfer models of @xcite and @xcite . the starburst models of efstathiou have provided good fits to a wide variety of individual objects from starburst ( e.g. m82 ) , lirg ( e.g.ngc6090 , iras1445 - 4343 ) to ulirg sources ( e.g. arp220 , mk231 ) , @xcite and also the recent results from the _ spitzer _ swire survey @xcite .",
    "the models of takagi et al . provide good fits to the seds of dusty submillimetre galaxies @xcite .",
    "the agn population is modelled on the recent sed library of @xcite .",
    "the sed libraries provide models for both type 1 and type 2 agn by the consideration of tapered disc geometries .",
    "the selected seds are shown in figure [ sed ] .",
    "further details of the model selection are provided in @xcite      to estimate the expected fluxes and corresponding colours in the _ akari _ bands we use the contemporary galaxy evolution model of @xcite .",
    "this model uses a backward evolution process based on the the _ iras _ all - sky pscz multi - component luminosity function defined at 60@xmath0 m comprising of cool normal quiescent galaxies , and a warmer component defined by infrared luminosity as @xmath3 starburst galaxies , @xmath4 lirg sources , @xmath5 ulirg sources and agn .",
    "this model fits the observed source counts from 2 - 1200@xmath0 m from the _ iras _ , _ iso _ , _ spitzer _ missions and the scuba / jcmt , mambo / iram instruments @xcite .",
    "our source colour information is simulated by passing a catalogue of point sources through the instrument simulator of @xcite .",
    "an input catalogue is constructed for the 5 broad galaxy types outlined above within the framework of @xcite .",
    "the catalogue is constructed as a function of increasing redshift in incremental redshift bins . for each redshift bin ,",
    "the theoretical number - redshift distribution from the model is used to randomly select the appropriate number of galaxies at that redshift and a corresponding luminosity by sampling the input luminosity function .",
    "each source from the catalogue is assigned a sed from the library depending on the galaxy type and the expected flux for each source from the corresponding sed at the desired wavelength and redshift is calculated and convolved with the appropriate filter response function .",
    "a one sigma variation in the sed flux ( i.e. for a given source in the catalogue the assigned flux at a given wavelength is selected randomly between @xmath61@xmath7 of the original sed template flux ) is also included at this stage to allow for a wider range of output fluxes for a limited number of input seds . note that although the instrument simulator is optimized for the _ akari _ mission @xcite , it is a simple matter to extend the simulator to encompass the characteristics of the infrared pass - bands of other space missions ( e.g. _ spitzer _ , _ herschel _ , etc .",
    ", see @xcite ) .",
    "the final output from the simulator is a catalogue of sources with associated sed , and filter band convolved fluxes at a set of desired wavelengths .",
    "in this work , the simulated source catalogue is used to investigate the deep _ akari _ sep survey .",
    "the _ akari _",
    "sep survey is a guaranteed time _ akari _ mission program ( mp ) .",
    "the current projected area spans @xmath88 square degrees in a low cirrus brightness region centred at r.a.=4@xmath944@xmath1000@xmath11 , dec=-53deg 20@xmath100.@xmath120 ( j2000 ) where the cirrus brightness is spectacularly low @xmath13 mjy / sr @xcite .",
    "this survey is estimated to reach the source confusion limit in the far - infrared fis wide bands and will be the deepest far - infrared image of the universe to date ( note that @xcite predict confusion limits of @xmath810mjy & 60mjy in the fis 90@xmath0 m and 140@xmath0 m bands respectively based on the source confusion criterion of 20 beams per source ) .",
    "shallow mid - infrared data will also be available over the entire area , along with deep optical @xmath14-band imaging to 25th magnitude .",
    "in addition , an area of approximately 1 square degree will be covered by irc mid - infrared imaging to @xmath8100@xmath0jy .",
    "source confusion at optical wavelengths may also pose complications for the identification of faint infrared sources . in the optical r - band",
    ", the source density may be up to an order of magnitude higher than the far - infrared akari source density .",
    "furthermore , although the advent of wide field optical multi - object spectroscopy instruments , such as aaomega on the anglo - australian telescope @xcite will make large scale follow up a reality , note that at these optical magnitudes ( b@xmath1523 ) there will still be @xmath85 optical sources per akari beam .",
    "therefore , any identification / population segregation that is possible using the infrared data alone will be of great value .    in figure",
    "[ counts ] the results of our analysis are presented .",
    "the _ top panel _ shows the predicted source counts over 10mjy1jy & 50mjy1jy from the models of @xcite in the _ akari _ fis 90@xmath0 m ( _ left _ ) & 140@xmath0 m ( _ right _ ) bands respectively .",
    "the _ akari _ sep survey should probe to depths of @xmath810mjy @xmath16 50mjy ( 3@xmath7 ) in the 90@xmath0 m & 140@xmath0 m bands respectively . in the 90@xmath0 m band , at brighter fluxes ( @xmath17100mjy ) the source counts are predominantly dominated by cool normal galaxies due to the dust emission hump peaking in the range @xmath8100 - 200@xmath0 m . at fainter fluxes ( @xmath18100mjy ) the warmer evolving starburst and lirg populations dominate .",
    "the 140@xmath0 m band , samples the cooler rayleigh - jeans regime of the dust emission hump and is dominated by cool normal galaxies and cold ulirg sources to @xmath19100mjy .",
    "the fainter fluxes again see the emergence of the warmer lirg population .",
    "the _ middle panels _ of figure [ counts ] show an example colour criterion utilizing the _ akari _ wide bands .",
    "the 140@xmath0m/90@xmath0 m and 90@xmath0m/140@xmath0 m colours are plotted as a function of 90@xmath0 m & 140@xmath0 m flux respectively on the same flux scales as the source counts in the _ top panel _ in the figure .",
    "limits in the flux and the colour corresponding to a 3@xmath7 90@xmath0 m flux limit of 10mjy and a 140@xmath0 m flux limit of 50mjy are plotted as _ dotted _ lines .",
    "immediately it can be seen that the far - infrared colours provide a reasonable discriminator of galaxy type with the more _ active _ star - forming galaxies occupying the parameter space corresponding to warmer colours ( higher 90@xmath0 m flux corresponding to 140@xmath0m/90@xmath0 m colours @xmath20 1.5 and 90@xmath0m/140@xmath0 m colours @xmath21 1 ) .",
    "note that @xcite have carried out a similar exercise with sources from the _ spitzer _ first look survey ( fls ) although their approach was instead to fit different dust temperatures to the far - infrared colours using the mips 160@xmath0 m and 70@xmath0 m bands , interpreting a cooler dust temperature as cold infrared colours .",
    "_ akari _ , with its 4 fis bands will have a greater power than _ spitzer _ in such far - infrared population colour segregation .",
    "in addition to providing a crude separation of cool normal galaxies and warmer starburst and lirg sources , the fis colour segregation is also capable of identifying a distinct cold ulirg population .",
    "these sources occupy a unique colour - flux parameter space in figure [ counts ] . for the case of the 140@xmath0 m band ( _ right - hand middle panel _ ) , the ulirgs occupy the parameter space defined by s(140@xmath0m)@xmath21100mjy with 90@xmath0m/140@xmath0 m colour @xmath200.2 . in the case of the 90@xmath0 m band the ulirgs",
    "are found at fainter fluxes of s(90@xmath0m)@xmath20 30mjy with 140@xmath0m/90@xmath0 m colours @xmath21 6 .",
    "the models of @xcite predict that in the 90@xmath0 m band , these colour selected ulirgs will be high redshift ( 1@xmath15z@xmath153 ) sources whilst the 140@xmath0 m colour selected ulirgs will be predominantly at redshifts z@xmath151.5 .",
    "the fainter 90@xmath0 m ulirg sample should include almost all the 140@xmath0 m ulirgs . from the _ middle panel _ in figure [ counts ] it",
    "can also be seen that the ulirg samples selected in both the 90@xmath0 m & 140@xmath0 m bands descend and ascend respectively into the colour parameter space occupied by the normal galaxies , i.e. that there is contamination of the cold ulirg population by the cooler colours in the normal galaxy population .",
    "this contamination of ulirgs by cool ( low redshift ) normal galaxies has also been reported in other colour selection studies over far - mid - infrared wavelengths @xcite . using suitable additional colour criteria",
    "it is also possible to de - convolve the ulirg sample from the cool normal galaxy population .",
    "the _ bottom panel _ of figure [ counts ] gives an example of the potential power of additional colour constraints to further segregate the galaxy populations .",
    "the _ bottom panel _ shows the segregation of the normal and ulirg populations when one of the deep mid - infrared bands is used ( in this case the irc s7 7@xmath0 m band ) in conjunction with the fis bands .",
    "bottom left panel _ shows the results for the 7@xmath0m/90@xmath0 m colours as a function of 90@xmath0 m flux .",
    "the normal galaxies are separated from the cold ulirg population by virtue of their higher mid - infrared / far - infrared flux ratio ( see figure [ sed ] ) .",
    "the slight remaining contamination that can be seen is actually from a hotter ulirg population whose mid - infrared emission is dominated by an agn .",
    "an even more significant segregation can be achieved using the 7@xmath0m/140@xmath0 m colours as a function of the longer wavelength 140@xmath0 m flux .",
    "since the far - infrared emission of the cold ulirgs is redshifted into the 140@xmath0 m band , the mid - infrared / far - infrared flux ratio is even lower . in addition , the normal galaxies exhibit a smaller scatter in 7@xmath0m/140@xmath0 m colours as a function of 140@xmath0 m flux since there is less variation in the seds on the rayleigh - jeans slope than at the shorter wavelengths sampled by the 90@xmath0 m band .",
    "the _ bottom panels _ of figure [ counts ] also show that , although to a lesser extent , a similar segregation can also be achieved for the agn population .",
    "using a suite of sed libraries combined with a contemporary galaxy evolution model and instrument simulator , we have carried out a pilot study of , and demonstrated a method to segregate galaxy populations in large data sets in a similar manner to the methods utilized for the _ iras _ all - sky survey . using simple colour criteria , the normal galaxy , starburst / lirg & ulirg populations can be succesfully discriminated as a function of far - infrared flux without the need for large - scale optical follow up campaigns .",
    "this method has been applied to the _ akari _ deep survey at the sep where it is successful in achieving a general segregation of the various extragalactic populations .",
    "the addition of more bands with a greater dispersion in wavelength can be used to further refine and decontaminate specific target populations ( in this example the ulirg and normal galaxy populations ) .",
    "the colour segregation criteria can thus be used to construct basic multi - component source counts without the need for expensive ground - based follow up .",
    "this is illustrated in figure [ counts ] .",
    "for the _ akari _ fis 90@xmath0 m band , the normal galaxies are identified with sources having colours over the range 1.5@xmath20140@xmath0m/90@xmath0m@xmath205 over all values of 90@xmath0 m flux .",
    "the starburst / lirg sources are identified with sources of colours 90@xmath0m/140@xmath0 m colours @xmath21 1 .",
    "the ulirg sources can be identified by the dual colour criterea of 140@xmath0m/90@xmath0m@xmath216 & 7@xmath0m/90@xmath0m@xmath200.007 . in the 140@xmath0 m band ,",
    "the normal galaxies can be identified with sources of colour 0.2@xmath2090@xmath0m/140@xmath0m@xmath200.7 while the starburst & lirg sources have generally warmer 90@xmath0m/140@xmath0 m colours @xmath210.7 .",
    "the ulirgs in the 140@xmath0 m band are defined as sources of colour 90@xmath0m/140@xmath0m@xmath200.2 & 7@xmath0m/140@xmath0m@xmath200.02 over a flux range s(140@xmath0m)@xmath21 100mjy .",
    "although not the focus of this present work , a similar criterion can also be applied to the agn population .    the colour - segregation method and corresponding colour segregated source counts holds great promise for the data sets that are expected from the large area surveys that are being conducted or will be conducted by the present and next generation of space - borne far - infrared telescopes such as _ spitzer _ , _ akari _ & _ herschel_. a more detailed description of this work and application to the _ akari _ all - sky survey and possible surveys with _",
