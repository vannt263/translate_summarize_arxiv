    "the supersoft x - ray source rx  j0513.9@xmath06951 ( hereafter called x0513@xmath069 ) was discovered with the @xmath1 satellite ( schaeidt , hasinger , & trumper 1993 ) and identified with a @xmath216.7 mag emission - line star in the large magellanic cloud ( pakull et al . 1993 ; cowley et al . 1993 ) .",
    "this star appears to be the same as the variable hv 5682 found by leavitt ( 1908 ) .",
    "its systemic velocity places it in the lmc , hence implying an absolute magnitude of m@xmath3 , the most luminous of all the supersoft x - ray binaries ( e.g. cowley et al . 1998 ) .",
    "long - term monitoring of x0513@xmath069 shows that it is normally in a high optical state , but that it fades by about a magnitude every 100 - 200 days , remaining in a low state for about a month each time ( e.g. alcock et al . 1996 ) .",
    "the optical spectrum shows extremely strong he ii 4686  emission with a narrow peak and extremely broad wings which are also weakly seen in the balmer and pickering lines .",
    "weaker emission lines of o vi , n v , c iv , and c iii are also present",
    ". highly red- and blue - shifted ( @xmath44000 km s@xmath5 ) components of the strongest emission lines appear to come from bi - polar jets ( crampton et al .",
    "1996 , southwell et al .",
    "the bright absolute magnitude and the presence of jet emission lines suggest that the accretion disk is very luminous and the system is undergoing rapid mass transfer .    in a spectroscopic study of x0513@xmath069 , crampton et al .",
    "( 1996 ) derived an orbital period of @xmath20.76 days from small radial velocity variations ( k@xmath211 km s@xmath5 ) of the emission lines .",
    "a similar photometric period was found by motch & pakull ( 1996 ) who showed the orbital light curve has a single minimum and a full range of @xmath20.06 mag .",
    "an improved photometric period was derived from three years of macho data by alcock et al .",
    "( 1996 ) who found p=0.76278 days with a full amplitude of @xmath20.04 mag during the high optical state .",
    "the very small photometric and velocity amplitudes suggest the system is seen at a low orbital inclination . if the optical emission lines are assumed to show the orbital motion of the compact star , the velocities imply the secondary is an evolved low - mass ( @xmath6 ) star .",
    "however , inconsistencies in the published ephemerides given by different authors prompted us to use the entire macho data set to derive an improved orbital period so that the existing optical data and new far - ultraviolet observations ( hutchings et al .",
    "2002 ) could be intercompared .",
    "this new period analysis is based on nearly 8 years of macho data .",
    "properties of the orbital light curve , long - term photometric variations , and a rediscussion of published spectroscopy are given in this paper .",
    "the interactive macho project light curve browser was used to extract instrumental magnitudes for x0513@xmath069 .",
    "we note that the macho website displays light curves labeled  blue \" and  red \" , but after application of the transformation equations given by alcock et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , the colors are close to @xmath7 and @xmath8 , respectively .",
    "hereafter we will refer them as @xmath9 and @xmath10 . as noted by many authors , the stellar image of x0513@xmath069",
    "is blended with a faint ( @xmath11 , @xmath12 ) field star lying just @xmath13 to the southeast .",
    "data from the online website show that this field star was resolved on nearly all of the red images but on none from the blue .",
    "( apparently , the field star is not included in the blue image reduction template because of its rather red color . )",
    "therefore , we had to explicitly remove an assumed contribution of this contaminant from the @xmath9 values .",
    "the @xmath10 magnitudes could be used without correction .",
    "observations taken in only one color or having an error @xmath14 mag in either color were rejected from further analysis .",
    "the long - term @xmath9 light curve of x0513@xmath069 , covering macho observations taken from 1992 through 1999 , is displayed in figure 1 .",
    "it clearly shows the source undergoes semi - regular drops of about a magnitude in its brightness level .",
    "there were 16 low states which occurred during the series of observations .",
    "however , the minima are not equally spaced and their depths and durations are not constant . the separation of the minima during the macho observation period ranged from 104 days to 195 days , with the average value being @xmath2161 days . the depths ( excluding the deep dip at the start of the low states ) ranged from @xmath20.3 to @xmath21.2 mag in @xmath9 , with the average being @xmath15 mag .",
    "there appears to be a gradual trend for the minima to become shallower from 1992 to 1999 , although the data are sparcer after 1997 so the minima are not as well defined . also , the duration of the minima increased slightly from @xmath235 days at the start of the macho observations to @xmath250 days by the end of the data set",
    ". there appears to be a very weak trend for the magnitude at the start of each bright state to increase with time , changing by @xmath20.3 mag over eight years .",
    "all of these factors need to be considered if one is trying to extract the small orbital variations .      in order to be able to compare new far - ultraviolet data with the older optical data , we re - examined the published orbital periods and ephemerides for x0513@xmath069 ( e.g. alcock et al .",
    "1996 , crampton et al .",
    "1996 , motch & pakull 1996 , southwell et al .",
    "although all authors give orbital periods near @xmath16 days , none of the studies is completely consistent with the others , and each has some limitations .",
    "for example , the spectroscopic studies by crampton et al .  and southwell et al .  were based on observations that covered only a few days in each observing season , so that it is not possible to carry their phasing forward for many cycles .",
    "similarly , the photometric data of motch & pakull only covered 6 nights , so the period was not well established .",
    "alcock et al .  derived a photometric period based on the first three years of macho data ( 1992 to 1995 ) .",
    "however , the ephemeris they presented is not consistent with that given by motch & pakull , although their dates of observation overlapped .",
    "these problems lead us to analyze the entire macho data set .    using the corrected @xmath9 magnitudes , we first removed all of the observations when x0513@xmath069 was in its low optical state or in a transition between states , resulting in 720 usable @xmath9 magnitudes .",
    "we then  detrended \" the data for each high - state interval by subtracting a linear fit to the @xmath9 magnitudes , since the source consistently shows a gradual fading of 0.10.3 mag during bright episodes . a similar procedure was followed by alcock et al .",
    "( we also tested this method using a quadratic fit to the high - state data , but this did not change any of the final results . ) to search for low - amplitude orbital modulations , a periodogram of the residuals , @xmath17 , was calculated ( see figure 2 ) .",
    "there is a significant peak at p=0.76295 days , near the value given by alcock et al .",
    "we refined the period by performing a least - squares fit of the residuals to a sine curve which resulted in the following @xmath9 ephemeris :    t(min ) = jd 2,448,858.099@xmath18 + 0.7629434@xmath19e  (= mjd 48857.599 )    since data from the macho website are tabulated in modified julian days ( mjd ) we give the time of minimum light in both jd and mjd to indicate that we have used the appropriate conversion .",
    "the semi - amplitude of the best - fit sine curve to the @xmath17 data is 0.021 mag .",
    "subsets of the data were also examined to look for possible period changes , but no significant differences were found .",
    "a similar procedure was followed using the @xmath10 data .",
    "we found a formal period that differed by only slightly from the @xmath9 value and a fitted sine curve that had a similar amplitude and time of minimum light .",
    "therefore , we have adopted the @xmath9 ephemeris for the subsequent analysis of all photometric and spectroscopic data . in figure 3 ( upper panel )",
    "we plot the bright - state @xmath17 and @xmath20 light curves , with individual data points averaged into 30 bins for each color .",
    "error bars are only shown for one color , since they would otherwise overlap each other .",
    "the agreement between @xmath17 and @xmath20 curves in both phase and amplitude is extremely good , and it demonstrates that there is no significant color change through the orbit when the source is in its high optical state .      as shown in figure 1 , x0513@xmath069 drops from its normally high optical state ( @xmath2116.7 ) by @xmath22 mag quasi - periodically .",
    "leavitt ( 1908 ) noted this star ( hv 5682 ) varied by @xmath21 mag between 1893 and 1906 , so we know this system has been undergoing these changes for over 100 years . it has been shown that during the optical dips the source undergoes soft x - ray outbursts ( e.g. reinsch et al .",
    "it is thought that mass flow rate at the surface of the while dwarf is at a minimum during the low optical state , while the bright states occur in times of rapid flow rate ( reinsch et al . 2000 ) .    to analyze the faint - state data , we eliminated all observations made during the high and transition states .",
    "in addition , the short , deep dips at the beginning of the low states were also removed . during each minimum",
    "the source tends to brighten slightly , so we have removed this trend for each individual segment . only those intervals with a minimum of four data points were analyzed .",
    "period analysis of the 145 faint - state residuals yields a value very close to that found for the bright state . in figure 3 ( lower panel )",
    "we plot the @xmath17 and @xmath20 light curves for the low - state data using the bright - state @xmath9 ephemeris .",
    "both faint - state light curves have a minimum at phase zero , a small magnitude range , and no orbital color variation .",
    "figure 3 shows the light curves in both colors and from both the high and low states are very similar in amplitude and phasing .",
    "we emphasize that these curves represent the orbital modulation of x0513@xmath069 after removing the mean light level .",
    "the macho data were also examined to see if there is an overall color change between the high and low states .",
    "we find ( @xmath23)@xmath24=0.146 in the bright state and ( @xmath23)@xmath24=0.161 in the low state , which indicates there is no significant change in color between states .",
    "although reinsch et al .  ( 1996 ) found the system became slightly redder [ @xmath25(@xmath26)@xmath27 during a single low state they observed in 1994 december , their discussion suggests that the contribution of the nearby field star may not have been removed .",
    "the fairly red color of the field star ( @xmath28 ) would change the observed color of x0513@xmath069 by about what they observe if the extraneous contribution were not subtracted .",
    "it is clear that irregular fluctuations are superimposed on the orbital variations .",
    "thus , when all the individual macho residual magnitudes ( @xmath17 or @xmath20 ) are plotted , the result is a band of points covering a range of @xmath20.2 mag at all phases .",
    "the binned light curve shown in figure 3 becomes apparent only through long - term monitoring .",
    "if only a few cycles are observed , the resulting light curve can differ considerably from the mean derived from many years of data .",
    "this is presumably why motch & pakull s analysis of only 6 nights of data gave a somewhat shorter period ( 0.745 days ) than the extensive macho data set .",
    "similar irregular behavior from cycle to cycle is typical in cataclysmic variables and related objects .",
    "we also examined additional peaks in the periodogram that were not were not simple aliases of the orbital period ( see the upper panel of figure 4 ) .",
    "a peak at p=83.2 days stands out in the high - state @xmath17 data .",
    "fitting the data to a sine curve , the full amplitude is @xmath20.03 mag with a minimum at mjd 48889.53@xmath290.16 . in the lower panel of figure 4",
    ", we show the @xmath17 light curve of x0513@xmath069 plotted on p=83.2 days .",
    "we tested the significance of this periodicity in three ways . in order to be sure that the long - term period was nt in some way related to the orbital modulation",
    ", we removed the 0.76-day variation and recomputed the periodogram .",
    "the long - period signal remained after the orbital variations were taken out .",
    "we then tried an alternative detrending algorithm using a quadratic rather than linear model .",
    "the resulting periodogram still showed a strong low - frequency peak , albeit at a slightly shorter period ( p=76.4 days ) .",
    "finally , we evaluated the significance of the long - term periodicity by randomly assigning each of the @xmath17 values to one of the observation times and recalculating the periodogram .",
    "since the observed power of the 83.2-day period was exceeded in _",
    "none _ of 250 random trials , the signal detected at this period  which is coherent over 8 years of data or about 35 cycles  is highly significant .    using the low - state data , there is little evidence of this long period in either the calculated periodogram or in the folded light curve .",
    "our speculation is that the long period might be related to the disk s precession . in the low state",
    ", the disk would be sufficiently faint that its variation might not be detectable .",
    "we have obtained photometry of x0513@xmath069 at cerro tololo inter - american observatory during several observing runs , of which most were coordinated with spectroscopic observations .",
    "our previously published photometry ( cowley et al .",
    "1996 ) includes data taken in 1992 december and 1993 march when the source was bright and in 1993 december when x0513@xmath069 was in a transition state , @xmath20.3 mag below its bright level .",
    "additional bright - state data from 3 nights in 1994 november was published by crampton et al .",
    "( 1996 ) . a single @xmath7 observation from 1995 november showed x0513@xmath069 in a bright optical state ( cowley et al .",
    "1998 ) .",
    "the new ccd photometry presented here was obtained with the ctio 0.9 m telescope on 1999 march 2128 ( ut ) , using the same instrumentation as in 1994 .",
    "altogether , 14 pairs of @xmath7 and @xmath30 images were taken ; they were reduced and calibrated with procedures consistent with the processing applied to the older data sets . in particular , the faint field star was resolved on each image taken in 1999 . in table 1 we present the previously unpublished @xmath30 and @xmath7 photometry , which indicate the source was in a bright optical state .",
    "the mean color of x0513@xmath069 was @xmath31 during the observing run .",
    "the light curve from the 1999 march ctio data is entirely consistent with the macho data covering the same epoch .",
    "although there are not enough data points in the small sample to determine an accurate period , the detrended and folded ctio light curve shows orbital modulations that lie within the envelope of the macho bright - state data presented in @xmath322.2 .",
    "with a greatly improved ephemeris it should be possible to phase together the radial velocities from previously published data .",
    "we have included data taken by crampton et al .  in 1992 december ( dec92 ) , 1993 december ( dec93 ) , and 1994 november ( nov94 ) as well as 1994 november - december ( nov / dec94 ) spectra reported by southwell et al .",
    "a plot of these velocities using the new ephemeris shows that these data are not well fit by a single velocity curve .",
    "the nov / dec94 and dec93 velocities agreed with each other in amplitude and phasing .",
    "similarly , the dec92 and nov94 data gave velocity curves consistent with each other , but differing from the first one . in trying to understand this",
    ", we examined the macho long - term light curve to see what optical state the source was in during each of these observations .",
    "the dec92 and nov94 spectra were taken when x0513@xmath069 was in its bright state .",
    "the nov / dec94 spectra were taken as the source was transitioning into a low state . although there is a gap in the macho data during the dec93 spectroscopic observations , simultaneous photometry obtained by schmidtke ( cowley et al .",
    "1996 ) show x0513@xmath069 at @xmath33 , which is fainter than the bright state and consistent with the source being in transition to or from a low state .",
    "the velocity curves from the bright and intermediate / transition states are shown in figure 5 .",
    "when the source was in its high state , maximum positive velocity was observed at phase @xmath20.1 .",
    "when the source was in an intermediate state , maximum velocity occurred about 0.2p earlier and with a slightly higher amplitude .",
    "this suggests that in the bright state , when the mass transfer is high , the emission lines are strongly dominated by the flow from the donor star so that maximum positive velocity is observed near the conjuction at phase zero . as the source transitions into a lower state ,",
    "the mass transfer is less and the accretion disk around the compact star now contributes more to the emission lines , so that some of the orbital motion of that star is evident ( hence the maximum velocity occurs nearer quadrature when the compact star s motion is away from the observer ) .",
    "we note that the systemic velocities in the two plots appear to differ by @xmath220 km s@xmath5 .",
    "we have made every effort to ensure the crampton et al .",
    "velocities are all on the same velocity system and measured in a uniform way .",
    "however , we have no way of knowing how the calibrations for the southwell et al .",
    "data were carried out . since the southwell et al .",
    "velocities comprise the majority of data points in the intermediate state , a difference in their velocity scale or method of measurement may cause the change in systemic velocity between the two plots .",
    "further observations will be needed to see if the differences in velocity curves between the two states are real or a calibration uncertainty .",
    "we would expect that velocities obtained during a low state , when the mass transfer is very low , would come mainly from the region near the compact star",
    ". that would be the ideal time to obtain a velocity curve with the goal of better defining the stellar masses in this system .",
    "knowledge of how the emission - line behavior changes depending on the brightness state of the system should help us to interpret future spectroscopic observations , both optical and ultraviolet .    in summary , we have derived a new ephemeris for x0513@xmath069 which allows us to intercompare published photometric and spectroscopic data and to understand how the system s characteristics change with brightness level .",
