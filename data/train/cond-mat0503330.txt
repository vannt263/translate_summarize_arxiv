    "among the simplest many - body problems one can consider is a fermi sea of electrons interacting with a static impurity .",
    "such an impurity is , for example , suddenly formed when a core or valence electron is excited above the fermi energy by an incident photon in a bulk - metal photoabsorption or photoluminescence experiment .",
    "naively , one would expect a sharp onset of the absorption cross section at threshold with a signal proportional to the density of states in the conduction band above the fermi energy . in experiments ,",
    "deviations from this behavior were found in the form of peaked or rounded edges both in metals @xcite and semiconductors @xcite .",
    "these so - called fermi edge singularities ( fes ) are a clear indication of the importance of many - body processes that have been receiving enduring interest .    for ( clean ) macroscopic systems ,",
    "an essentially complete understanding of the mechanisms causing the fermi edge singularities has been obtained by the late eighties @xcite . in particular , these works have emphasized the role of two competing effects .",
    "the first one is the anderson orthogonality catastrophe ( aoc ) , which is a property of the overlap between many - body wavefunctions .",
    "however , in x - ray absorption and photoabsorption processes , besides aoc there is another many - body response of the conduction electrons to the impurity potential @xcite , often referred to as mahan s exciton , mahan s enhancement , or the mahan - nozires - dedominicis ( mnd ) contribution .",
    "it counteracts the effect of aoc in situations where the dipole selections rules are fulfilled , and causes the photoabsorption cross section to diverge at the threshold .    in the present series of two papers we are interested in these many - body effects in mesoscopic systems @xcite , such as quantum dots or nanoparticles , and in particular in the changes with respect to the macroscopic ( or bulk ) case due to the confined geometry . in this first paper , we focus on the orthogonality catastrophe mechanism for a finite system .",
    "we will more particularly consider the case of a contact ( rank one ) , but not necessarily small , perturbation , with the localized perturbation presented by the core hole left behind in photoabsorption just being one example . in the second paper , that will be referred to as   in the following",
    ", we will discuss in detail fermi edge singularities and mesoscopic photoabsorption spectra that depend not only on aoc but crucially on the mnd contribution .    in a bulk - metal x - ray absorption experiment ,",
    "the conduction electrons respond to the abrupt , non - adiabatic appearance of a core hole generated upon photoexcitation of an inner shell electron into the conduction band by adjusting their single particle energies and wavefunctions slightly .",
    "since the core hole represents an effectively positive charge the scattering potential will be attractive , and the energy levels will be lowered .",
    "although the overlap of the respective single particle states before and after the perturbation is very close to one , the many - body ground state overlap @xmath0 tends to zero in the thermodynamic limit , @xmath1 with @xmath2 the number of conduction electrons and the parameter @xmath3 .",
    "this effect , first noted by anderson in 1967 @xcite , is the anderson orthogonality catastrophe . as a result of aoc the cross section @xmath4 for the absorption of photons with energy @xmath5 will be power - law suppressed near threshold , explaining the above - mentioned fermi edge singularity in the form of a rounded edge .",
    "aoc plays an important role in all processes where a finite range scattering potential suddenly arises or changes .",
    "it is also prominent in the mssbauer effect where aoc enables the recoilless emission or absorption of @xmath6-rays by the whole crystal , but not by a single nucleus@xcite .",
    "another example is kondo physics , except that in that case the impurity is dynamic , rather than static as considered here .",
    "turning from macroscopic to mesoscopic systems opens a new venue to the study of aoc . to start with",
    ", the confined geometry will naturally induce new behavior associated with the mesoscopic regime , among which are the lack of translational or rotational invariance , the existence of interference effects , and the related mesoscopic fluctuations @xcite .",
    "furthermore the advances in the fabrication of mesoscopic and nanoscopic devices provide a great flexibility in designing systems for which one can measure and control processes dominated by aoc .",
    "one example would correspond to the situation where an electron tunnels through a system of two quantum dots joined via a small constriction . in that case",
    "the boundary conditions of the electrons on the far dot are changed once the tunneling electron enters the first dot @xcite , and as a consequence a change of one electron appears as a sudden perturbation to the remaining electrons .",
    "another example is a mesoscopic tunnel junction containing a localized impurity level such that tunneling from the junction to the lead leaves behind a hole bound to the impurity .",
    "the resulting power - law singularities in the current - voltage characteristics were studied in ref .   and observed in experiments with two- and three - dimensional electrodes@xcite .",
    "large optical singularities in one - dimensional electron gases formed in semiconductor quantum wires were observed in ref .   and theoretically explained as fermi - edge singularities@xcite .",
    "aspects of aoc in disordered or mesoscopic systems have been addressed in various publications @xcite .",
    "aoc in disordered simple metals and its influence on x - ray photoemission spectra ( where the excited core electron leaves the metal and the edge behavior is determined by the aoc response alone ) was studied by chen and kroha@xcite . in ref .  , vallejos and coworkers studied aoc in chaotic mesoscopic systems for a weak perturbation modeled by a random matrix .",
    "they found large fluctuations of the aoc overlap that is non - zero in general due to the incomplete orthogonality .",
    "small overlaps are correlated with avoided level crossings between the highest filled and the lowest empty level .",
    "this motivated the analytic study of a two - level model to which we refer below .",
    "mesoscopic conductors with diffusive disorder were studied with respect to aoc by gefen _",
    "et al._@xcite the dependence of the average aoc - overlap on the number @xmath2 of electrons was found to be dimension dependent , and to show a stronger dependence on @xmath2 in two dimensions than in higher dimensions . in agreement with the results by vallejos _",
    "et al . _ and the results we present here , a broad distribution of overlaps is seen , with the small - overlap tail of the distribution being related to few - level statistics near the fermi - energy .",
    "another key result was that the disorder - averaged aoc overlap depends non - monotonically on the disorder .",
    "this becomes clear in the limit of strong disorder where the electrons are strongly localized and can not be sensitive to the addition of another impurity , and was confirmed in their numerical results .",
    "as already mentioned , here we will more specifically consider the case of a short range ( rank one ) , not necessarily small , perturbation @xcite , which applies for the description of the perturbation created by the core hole .",
    "we will furthermore consider a generic chaotic mesoscopic system , such as a quantum dot or nanoparticle , for which a random matrix theory ( rmt ) model of the conduction electrons applies .",
    "this particular regime will show some similarities with both the diffusive systems studied in ref .   and the non - rank - one perturbative regime investigated by vallejos et al.@xcite , but will also display interesting specific properties .    beyond aoc ,",
    "fermi - edge singularities in the mesoscopic regime were considered in refs .  ,  , and  .",
    "we will consider the full mesoscopic x - ray edge problem and the resulting fes in photoabsorption spectra of quantum dots or nanoparticles in the second paper of this series@xcite , and concentrate on aoc in the present , first paper .",

    "[ sec_boundstate ] , and its role for the symmetry of overlap distributions for positive and negative perturbations is discussed .",
