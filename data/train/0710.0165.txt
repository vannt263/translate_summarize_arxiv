    "hadron production in electron - positron annihilations just above @xmath10 threshold has been a subject of mystery and little intensive study for more than three decades since the discovery of charm .",
    "recent developments , like the observation of the @xmath11 reported by the babar collaboration @xcite and subsequently confirmed by cleo - c @xcite and belle @xcite , underscore our incomplete understanding and demonstrate the potential for discovery of new states , such as hybrids and glueballs .",
    "it is also clear that precise measurements of charm - meson properties are essential for higher - energy investigations of @xmath12-flavored particles and new states that might decay into @xmath12",
    ". they also offer unique opportunities to test the validity and guide the development of theoretical tools , like lattice qcd , that are needed to interpret measurements of the ckm quark - mixing parameters @xcite .",
    "any comprehensive program of precise charm - decay measurements demands a detailed understanding of charm production .",
    "past studies of hadron production in the charm - threshold region have been dominated by measurements of the cross - section ratio @xmath13 that have been made over this energy range by many experiments @xcite .",
    "recent measurements with the beijing spectrometer ( bes ) @xcite near charm threshold are especially noteworthy .",
    "there is a rich structure in this energy region , reflecting the production of @xmath14 resonances and the crossing of thresholds for specific charm - meson final states .",
    "interesting features in the hadronic cross section between 3.9 and 4.2  gev include a large enhancement at the threshold for @xmath15 production ( @xmath16  gev ) and a fairly large plateau that begins at @xmath17 threshold .",
    "while there is considerable theoretical interest @xcite , there has been little experimental information about the composition of these enhancements .    in this paper",
    "we describe measurements of charm - meson production in @xmath18 annihilations at thirteen center - of - mass energies between 3970 and 4260  mev .",
    "these studies were carried out with the cleo - c detector at the cornell electron storage ring ( cesr ) @xcite in 2005 - 6 .",
    "( throughout this paper charge - conjugate modes are implied . )",
    "the principal objective of the cleo - c energy scan was to determine the optimal running point for studies of @xmath19-meson decays .",
    "the same data sample has been used to confirm the direct production of @xmath11 in @xmath18 annihilations and to demonstrate @xmath11 decays to final states in addition to @xmath20 @xcite .",
    "specific results presented in this paper include cross - section measurements for exclusive final states with @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 mesons and inclusive measurements of the total charm - production cross section and @xmath21 .",
    "the data sample for this analysis was collected with the cleo - c detector .",
    "both the fast - feedback analysis carried out as data were collected and the detailed analysis reported here are extensions of techniques developed for charm - meson studies at the @xmath22 @xcite .    an initial energy scan , conducted during august - october , 2005 , consisted of twelve energy points between 3970 and 4260  mev , with a total integrated luminosity of 60.0  pb@xmath23 .",
    "the scan was designed to provide cross - section measurements at each energy for all accessible final states consisting of a pair of charmed mesons . at the highest energy point",
    "these include @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and @xmath9 , where the first three contain both charged and neutral states .",
    "a follow - up run beginning early in 2006 provided a larger sample of 178.9 pb@xmath23 at 4170  mev that proved essential in understanding the composition of charm production throughout this energy region .",
    "the center - of - mass energies and integrated luminosities for the thirteen subsamples are listed in table  [ tab : samples ] .",
    ".center - of - mass energies and integrated luminosity totals for all data samples for the cleo - c energy scan . [ cols=\"^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     as a cross - check , for the two largest data samples ( 4170  mev and 4260  mev ) , the multi - body cross sections are also determined by fitting the distributions of missing mass against detected @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 combinations . while these measurements are less precise , they show good agreement with the results of the momentum - spectrum fits .",
    "if all final states have been included , the sum of the exclusive cross sections should equal the total charm cross section .",
    "we test this supposition with two inclusive measurements that can also be compared with past results .",
    "the first cross - check is a measurement of the total charm - meson cross section : @xmath27 where the contributing cross sections are defined by @xmath28/@xmath29 , where @xmath30 and @xmath31 are the efficiency and branching fraction for the decay mode used ( @xmath32 , @xmath33 , and @xmath34 ) , @xmath35 is the integrated luminosity , and @xmath36 is the yield obtained by fitting the mass spectrum . in the case of @xmath1 and @xmath0 , the invariant - mass distribution is fitted to a gaussian signal and polynomial background . for @xmath37 ,",
    "the event - type requirements are maintained because of the relatively large background for the high - yield @xmath38 decay mode .",
    "for our energy points below 4120  mev , where @xmath37 production occurs only through @xmath39 , the yield is extracted by fitting @xmath40 to a gaussian signal and argus background function @xcite . for 4120",
    "mev and above , event types involving @xmath41 contribute .",
    "for all candidate events that pass the selection requirements for any of @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and @xmath9 ( the last only for 4260  mev ) , a fit to the @xmath19 invariant mass is used to determine the yield .",
    "the second cross - check is a determination of the total cross section made by counting multihadronic charm events .",
    "the contribution of @xmath42 continuum production is estimated with measurements made at @xmath433671  mev , below @xmath14 threshold , and extrapolated as @xmath44 .",
    "procedures for this measurement are identical to those used to determine the cross section for @xmath45 in cleo - c data at @xmath46  mev @xcite .    figure  [ fig : concl_sysdd]d shows the inclusive measurements ( statistical and systematic uncertainties combined in quadrature ) and the sum of the cross sections for the measured exclusive final states , without radiative corrections .",
    "the excellent agreement demonstrates that , to current precision , the measured exclusive two- and three - body final states saturate charm production in this region .",
    "furthermore , charm is demonstrated to account for all production of multihadronic events above the extrapolated uds cross section .    for the inclusive - charm cross - section measurements , the systematic uncertainties associated with the per - particle efficiencies for tracking and particle identification are identical to those of the exclusive measurements .",
    "the uncertainties in normalization ( luminosity and branching fractions ) are also identical .",
    "systematic uncertainty in the yield extraction is dominated by the choice of fitting function .",
    "this is evaluated mode by mode and propagated into overall systematic uncertainties accounting for all correlations , with combined systematic uncertainties of @xmath47 , @xmath48 , and @xmath49 ( @xmath50 ) for @xmath1 , @xmath0 , and @xmath2 below ( above ) 4120  mev . for the hadron - counting inclusive cross sections , the systematic uncertainties are identical to those of ref .",
    "@xcite .    for comparison with other experiments and theory",
    "it is necessary to obtain born - level cross sections from the observed cross sections by correcting for isr .",
    "we do this by calculating correction factors following the method of kuraev and fadin @xcite , which gives the observed cross section at any @xmath51 : @xmath52 where the born cross section @xmath53 is a function of the effective center - of - mass energy squared ( @xmath54/@xmath55 ) ) , and @xmath56 is the isr kernel .",
    "the radiative - correction factor is also calculated following the alternative implementation of bonneau and martin @xcite . a 4% difference between the two calculations",
    "is taken as the systematic uncertainty in the radiative correction .",
    "figure  [ radcor_inr_fig ] shows that there is excellent agreement    between our inclusive - charm measurement and @xmath21 measurements in this region made by bes @xcite and crystal ball @xcite .",
    "in summary , we have presented detailed information about charm production above @xmath57 threshold . realizing the main objective of the cleo - c scan run",
    ", we find the center - of - mass energy that maximizes the yield of @xmath58 to be 4170  mev , where the cross section of @xmath59  nb is dominantly @xmath8 .",
    "this information has guided the planning of subsequent cleo - c running , with initial results already presented on leptonic @xcite and hadronic @xcite @xmath37 decays .",
    "the total charm cross section between @xmath60 gev and @xmath61 gev has been measured both inclusively and for specific two - body and multi - body final states .",
    "internal consistency is excellent and radiatively - corrected inclusive cross sections are consistent with previous experimental results .",
    "figure  [ fig : concl_sysdd ] shows that the observed exclusive cross sections for @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath62 , and @xmath63 exhibit structure that reflects the intricate behavior expected in the charm - threshold region .",
    "figure  [ fig : eichten_comparison ] provides a comparison        between our measured cross sections and the updated calculation of eichten _",
    "there is reasonable qualitative agreement for most of the two - charm - meson final states .",
    "the most notable exception is the cross section for @xmath6 in the region between 4050 and 4200 mev , where the measurement exceeds the prediction by as much as 2 nb .",
    "this corresponds to nearly a factor - of - two disagreement in the ratio of @xmath6 to @xmath5 production , accounting for about two thirds of the difference in the total charm cross section .",
    "this is a much larger effect than the absence of a multi - body component from the theoretical prediction .",
    "it has been suggested by dubynskiy and voloshin @xcite that the existence of a peak in the @xmath5 and @xmath64 channels at the @xmath65 threshold , along with the observation that there is a minimum in @xmath4 , can be interpreted as a possible new narrow resonance , but available data are insufficient for a definitive assessment .",
    "the @xmath6 cross section exhibits a plateau just above its threshold .",
    "this contrasts with @xmath66 , which we observe to peak at threshold , in agreement with recently presented preliminary results from belle @xcite .",
    "we gratefully acknowledge the effort of the cesr staff in providing us with excellent luminosity and running conditions .",
    "we thank e.  eichten and m.  voloshin for useful discussions .",
