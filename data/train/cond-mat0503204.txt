    "when the phase coherence of electrons passing through a mesoscopic system is retained , a number of quantum interference phenomena will occur .",
    "recent advances in nano - technologies have attracted much attention to the quantum coherence phenomena in the resonant tunneling processes of the quantum dot(qd ) systems,@xcite in which the typical length scale can be shorter than or comparable to the mean free path of electrons and the wave nature of electrons plays a decisive role . in the past decade , the widely adopted method of studying the phase coherence of a traversing electron through a qd is to measure the magnetic - flux - dependent current through an aharonov - bohm(ab ) interferometer by inserting the qd into one of its arms.@xcite the observed magnetic - oscillation of the current will be the indication of the coherent transport through the qd , provided that at least partial coherence of electrons is kept .",
    "@xcite    fano resonances is another good probe for the phase coherence in the qd system.@xcite it is known that the fano resonance stems from quantum interference between resonant and nonresonant processes,@xcite and manifests itself in spectra as asymmetric lineshape in a large variety of experiments . unlike the conventional fano resonance,@xcite the fano effect in qd system",
    "has its advantage in that its key parameters can be readily tuned .",
    "suppose that a discrete level inside the qd acts as a breit - wigner - type scatter and is broadened by a factor of @xmath0 due to couplings with the continua in leads .",
    "the key to realize the fano effect in the conductance spectra is that , within @xmath0 the phase of the electron should smoothly change by @xmath1 on the resonance.@xcite the first observation of the fano lineshape in the qd system was reported by gres _",
    "et al_.@xcite in the single - electron - transistor experiments .",
    "recently , k. kobayashi _ et al . _ carried out research on magnetically and electrostatically tunable fano effect in a qd embedded in an ab ring,@xcite and a.c .",
    "et al_. investigated a tunable fano interferometer consisting of a qd coupled to a one - dimensional channel via tunneling and observed the coulomb - modified fano resonances.@xcite    the double quantum dot(dqd ) system , including the series - coupled dqd@xcite and parallel - coupled dqd,@xcite makes the quantum transport phenomena rich and varied .",
    "the parallel - coupled dqd system is of particular interest , in which two qd s are respectively embedded into opposite arms of the ab ring , coupled each other via barrier tunneling , and coupled to two leads roughly equally . as a controllable two - level system , it is appealing for the parallel - coupled dqd system to become one of promising candidates for the quantum bit in quantum computation based on solid state devices.@xcite the entangled quantum states required for performing the quantum computation demand a high degree of phase coherence in the system.@xcite being a probe of phase coherence,@xcite if the fano effect in the parallel - coupled dqd system is tunable and exhibits the swap effect , it is certainly of practical importance .",
    "inspired by recent experimental advances in the parallel dqd,@xcite several groups have attempted to address this multi - path system theoretically , and predicted the fano resonance in the parallel - coupled dqd system.@xcite however , it seems that a physically transparent picture for the fano effect in the dqd system is still lacking .",
    "for example , it is unclear what the resonant and nonresonant channels are in this fano system .",
    "moreover , a systematic study is required for exploring various possibilities of tuning fano effect with external fields . in this paper , we intend to provide with a natural yet simple explanation for the fano effect in the parallel - coupled dqd , and propose several ways to control the fano resonance in the conductance spectra by the electrostatic and magnetic approaches .    the paper is organized as follows . in sec.[sec : model ] , a widely used two - level fano - anderson model is introduced with an inter - dot coupling term added . since the coupled quantum dots may be considered as an artificial qd - molecules,@xcite an effective hamiltonian in terms of the bonding and antibonding states of the qd - molecule may form an appropriate working basis .",
    "thus with the help of the green function technique and the equation of motion method,@xcite the density of states is calculated in three asymmetric configurations classified according to the spatial symmetry of the dot - lead coupling.@xcite in sec .",
    "[ sec : calculation ] , the conductance formula is derived for this system,@xcite whereby the fano lineshape in conductance spectra is calculated in the absence of the magnetic flux . in sec.[sec : explain ] , a simple mechanism explaining the fano lineshape in the dqd conductance spectrum is presented .",
    "then , the possibilities of tuning the conductance lineshape by various electrostatic and magnetic methods are described in details , and several novel effects are predicted .",
    "most importantly , by tuning the the total magnetic flux , or the flux difference between the left and right parts of the ab ring , the swap effect between two resonance peaks in the conductance spectra is predicted , which might be of potential application as a type of c - not gate in the quantum computation . finally , a brief summary is drawn and presented .",
    "we start with the fano - anderson model for the parallel - coupled dqd where the discrete states in two quantum dots are coupled each other via tunneling .",
    "( fig.[fig : model]a ) then the hamiltonian reads @xmath2 the @xmath3 in eq.([hamiltonian ] ) represents the noninteracting electron gas in the left(l ) and right(r ) leads , @xmath4 where , @xmath5 are the creation and annihilation operators for a continuum in the lead @xmath6 with energy @xmath7 .",
    "the @xmath8 in eq.([hamiltonian ] ) describes the qd electrons and their mutual coupling in the dqd , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath9 the first term in eq.([hd1 ] ) , @xmath10 @xmath11 , represents the create ( annihilate ) operator of the electron with the energy @xmath12 in the dot @xmath13 .",
    "the second and third terms in eq.([hd1 ] ) denote the inter - dot coupling , in which @xmath14 is the coupling strength taken as a real parameter , and @xmath15 denotes a phase shift related to the flux difference between the left and right sub - rings .",
    "the @xmath16 in eq.([hamiltonian ] ) represents the tunneling coupling between the qd and lead electrons , @xmath17 where the tunneling matrix element @xmath18 , and @xmath19 . here for the sake of simplicity , @xmath20 is assumed to be independent of @xmath21 , and the phase shift due to the total magnetic flux threading into the ab ring , @xmath22 , is assumed to distribute evenly among 4 sections of the dqd - ab ring .",
    "namely , @xmath23 , where the flux quantum @xmath24 .",

    ", we define the line - width matrix as @xmath26 ( @xmath27 and @xmath28 . according to fig.[fig : model](a ) , the line - width matrices in the qd representation read @xmath29 and @xmath30 where @xmath31 is short for @xmath32 .        to make the physical picture clearer and formalism simpler",
    ", it is attractive to introduce a qd - molecule representation by transforming two tunneling - coupled qd levels into the bonding and antibonding states of the qd - molecule .",
    "the operator for a molecule state can be expressed as a linear superposition of the qd operators as @xmath33 where , @xmath34 and @xmath35 are referred to as the annihilation operators for the bonding and antibonding states of the artificial qd - molecule . and the parameter @xmath36 is defined as @xmath37 .",
    "$ ] for mathematical simplicity , in the following only the symmetric case is studied , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath38 , and thus @xmath39 .",
    "then the hamiltonian for coupled dots is decoupled as @xmath40 in the molecular - state representation , the tunneling hamiltonian between the leads and dqd is rewritten into @xmath41 where the effective tunneling matrix elements are @xmath42 now , the dqd system has been mapped into a system of two independent molecular states , which are connected to leads , respectively(_cf . _",

    "it is noticed that the structure 1 and 2 share the identical dos .",
    "two points are worth to pointing out .",
    "firstly , since the full width at half maximum @xmath55 for each molecular state depends on the parameters @xmath56 , @xmath22 , and @xmath15 , the broadenings of molecular states could be tuned not only by the dot - lead coupling strength and total magnetic flux , but also by the flux difference .",
    "secondly , the broadening of one molecular state is always accompanied by the shrinking of the other molecular state because the trace of the matrix of @xmath57 is an invariant , as explicitly shown by eqs .",
    "( [ mogammal ] ) and ( [ mogammar ] ) .",
    "thirdly , in the absence of the magnetic flux ( @xmath58 ) , @xmath59 in the structure 3 , i.e. the antibonding state is totally decoupled from the leads and possesses an infinite lifetime .",
    "the finite @xmath22 introduced by the magnetic flux in this structure results in the finite coupling between the antibonding state and leads , and thus a finite width for the antibonding state .",
    "to study the transport through the dqd system , the conductance at zero temperature is derived , which , on the basis of the non - interacting molecular levels , can be reduced to the landauer - bttiker formula @xcite @xmath60 where , @xmath61 is the fermi energy at both leads at equilibrium . in the absence of coulomb interaction between the electrons on the dots ,",
    "the transmission @xmath62 is expressed as@xcite @xmath63,\\ ] ] where the retarded and advanced green functions , @xmath64 and @xmath65 , and the linewidth matrices @xmath66 can be expressed in molecular states representation or in dot levels representation , respectively .",

    "the solution of @xmath64 is given by @xmath71 the advanced green function is the hermite conjugate of the retarded green function .",
    "put eq.([grdot ] ) into eq.([transmission ] ) and after some algebra , the transmission probability through the dqd system is found to be @xmath72 ^ 2+\\gamma^2_+\\ } \\{[\\varepsilon-(\\varepsilon_0-t_c)]^2+\\gamma^2_-\\}},\\nonumber\\\\\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath73 the conductance through the dqd system as expressed in eq.([conduct1 ] ) depends in general on the energy levels of two dots , dot - lead coupling , inter - dot coupling , and phase shift induced by the magnetic flux . without the magnetic flux ,",
    "i.e. @xmath58 , and @xmath74 , eq.([conduct1 ] ) recovers to the result by guevara _",
    "et al_.@xcite ; while in the limit of vanishing inter - dot coupling ( @xmath75 ) , the result of kubala _ et al_.@xcite is repeated .    in the molecular state representation",
    ", the total conductance can also be divided into @xmath76 where the transmission via each molecular state is @xmath77 ^ 2+\\gamma_{\\pm}^2},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and the interference term is given by @xmath78[\\varepsilon-(\\varepsilon_0- t_c)+i\\gamma_{- } ] } \\}.\\nonumber\\\\\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]",
    "as shown in fig.[fig : fano3 ] , the total conductance through the parallel - couple dqd system consists of a breit - wigner peak and a fano peak , which is quite different from the dos where two lorentzians are superposed . based on the molecular level representation formulated above , let us first explain how the fano interference is produced in somewhat details , then show how to tune it . although similar observations have been reported in refs .",
    ", it seems that till now no simple and transparent explanation is available on the formation of the fano lineshape in this structure .    , and @xmath54 .",
    "notice that the conductance spectra in two structures have quite different interference pattern though the identical dos as in fig.[fig : dos ] .",
    ", scaledwidth=50.0% ]    when a discrete level is buried into a continuum , the coupling between the discrete and continuous states gives rise to the renormalization of the states of whole system .",
    "the phase of the renormalized wave function varies by @xmath79 swiftly as the energy transverses an interval @xmath80 around the discrete level , where @xmath0 is the broadening of the discrete level due to coupling with the continua.@xcite then , if there is a reference channel whose phase changes little in the interval of @xmath0 around the discrete level , the quantum interference above and below the resonance level will be responsible for the fano lineshape in the conductance spectra , for example , the experimentally observed fano lineshape in the hybrid system of a qd and a reference arm.@xcite    in the present dqd multi - path system , it is not simple to identify the resonant and the reference channel .",
    "but , on the basis of the molecular level representation , it is straightforward to interpret the fano resonance in the dqd system in terms of the interference between two channels .",
    "usually , two molecular levels are coupled to the leads unequally . in the absence of magnetic flux , eq.([gfmo5 ] ) simply reduces to @xmath81 i.e. , the broadening of one level is always accompanied by the shrinking of the other . the molecular level associated with a wider band",
    "can be referred to as the strongly - coupled one , while that with narrow band is referred to as the weakly - coupled level .",
    "suppose that the broadening of the strongly - coupled level entirely covers the band width with the weakly - coupled level , and the phase shift for the strongly - coupled channel is negligibly small around the weakly - coupled level , then a phase shift of @xmath1 across the weakly - coupled level can be detected with characteristic of the fano lineshape .",
    "namely , the waves through two channels interfere constructively for electron with energy on one side of the weakly - coupled level ; while interfere destructively on the other side . as a result",
    ", the fano lineshape shows up around the weakly - coupled state .",
    "it is worth pointing out that the @xmath1 phase shift also happens around the strongly - coupled level , but on a energy scale much larger than that around the weakly - coupled level ( fig.[fig : dos ] ) .",
    "that is why usually there is only one fano peak around the weakly - coupled level , and the other peak around the strongly - coupled level only exhibits little asymmetry .",
    "compared with the fano effect in the hybrid system,@xcite where the nonresonant channel served by a quantum point contact detects the @xmath1 phase shift around the resonant tunneling channel through the qd , in the dqd system , the reference channel is the `` less resonant '' tunneling channel on one side of the strongly - coupled level , and the other `` more resonant '' channel through the weakly - coupled level is accompanied with a swift @xmath1 phase shift within a small energy region .",
    "the fano lineshape in the present system can be tuned by the applied electrostatic and magnetic fields .",
    "compared with the one dot and one arm case , where the magnetic field affects only the phase of the electron , but not the interaction strength,@xcite in the parallel - coupled dqd , not only the phase but also the magnitude of the effective coupling between the molecular states and leads can be tuned by the magnetic flux .",
    "of course , one should keep in mind that the inter - dot coupling is the prerequisite to the tunable fano effect .    , where the fermi energy is roughly at the antibonding level .",
    "( b),(c),and ( d ) simulation of the normalized fano lineshape with different asymmetric factors @xmath82 as compared to the results obtained by green functions in ( a).,scaledwidth=50.0% ]      the inter - dot coupling @xmath14 can be tuned by adjusting the height and thickness of the tunneling barrier between two dots through gate voltages .",
    "so can be done the dot - lead coupling @xmath83 .",
    "the interference between the resonance and the reference channels can be described as @xmath84 where @xmath85 and @xmath86 denote respectively the transmission amplitude via the resonance and the reference channels , the detuning @xmath87 , and the asymmetric factor @xmath88 .",
    "it is well known that when the asymmetric factor @xmath82 is small , eq.([fanolineshape ] ) gives rise to the asymmetric fano lineshape ; while for large @xmath82 , it tends to the symmetric lorentzian .",
    "[ fig : tuningtc](a ) depicts the conductance spectra for three different inter - dot coupling strengths in structure 2 . as for comparison , the normalized fano lineshape ( multiplied by a normalized factor @xmath89 )",
    "is also plotted in fig.[fig : tuningtc](b),(c ) , and ( d ) , demonstrating how the fano lineshape evolves with increasing @xmath82 .",
    "it is obvious that as the inter - dot coupling increases , the bonding and antibonding splitting increases . as a result ,",
    "the amplitude through the channel associated with the strongly - coupled level but at the energy range of antibonding peak , @xmath86 , decreases , and since @xmath82 is inversely proportional to @xmath86 , the asymmetric factor @xmath82 increases .",
    "this further confirms our explanation above about the origin of fano effect in this parallel - coupled dqd system .    when tuning the dot - lead coupling strength @xmath83 by tuning the gate voltage ,",
    "the structure studied is changed , and the fano lineshape is changed accordingly .",
    "for example , when the strong and weak coupling in the linewidth matrix is adjusted such that the structure 1 is transformed into the structure 2 , ( see fig.[fig : fano3]b ) , noticeably , the tail direction of the fano peak is flipped .",
    "this delicate change can be understood in terms of the product of the effective tunneling matrix elements @xmath90 in the wide band limit , a linewidth matrix element is proportional to the product of two dot - lead tunneling matrix elements . according to fig.[fig : structure ] ,",
    "the expression above for the structure 1 differs from that for structure 2 by a minus sign , which implies that , compared to structure 2 , an extra flux of @xmath1 threads the loop in the structure 1(fig.[fig : jump ] ) .",
    "thus , the fano lineshape in structure 1 is just opposite to that in structure 2 , i.e. , if two channels interfere with each other constructively in structure 1 , then destructively in structure 2 ; and vice versa .",

    "the swap operation is an important element to the controlled - not gate , which is the key to implementing the quantum computation .",

    "when @xmath92 ( n is an integer ) , eq.([gfmo5 ] ) turns out to be @xmath93 compared with the case of null flux , or @xmath94 [ eq.([gamma_pm ] ) ] , the widths of the bonding and antibonding states are interchanged .",
    "fig.[fig : tuningphi ] demonstrates the evolution of conductances with changing the total magnetic flux in three asymmetric configurations for zero @xmath15 . in this circumstance",
    "the fano and breit - wigner peaks in the conductance spectra of the structures 1 and 2 have been exchanged each other , when changing @xmath22 from @xmath95 to @xmath94 . on the other hand , when @xmath96 , two identical peaks appear in conductance spectra symmetrically , which is quite similar to the dos spectra . in structure 3 ,",
    "no fano peak exists without the magnetic flux according to eq.([rhopm ] ) and fig.[fig : tuningphi ] , because the antibonding state is totally decoupled from the leads .",
    "however , if @xmath22 deviates a little from zero , or more generally , from a multiple of @xmath97 , the channel connecting the decoupled state and the leads is open , and the fano interference comes back again .",

    "two levels are broadened into two bands : one is wider which is associated with the strongly - coupled level , and the other is narrower band related to the weakly - coupled level . when the wider band covers the narrower band , and the phase shift of the wavefunction of the wider band is negligible around the weakly - coupled level , the @xmath1 phase shift at resonance of the wavefunction of the narrower band may be detected via the quantum interference , and shows up as the fano lineshape .",

    "<S> with the help of the green function technique and the equation of motion approach , the electronic transport through a parallel - coupled double quantum dot(dqd ) is theoretically studied . </S>",
    "<S> owing to the inter - dot coupling , the bonding and antibonding states of the artificial quantum - dot - molecule may constitute an appropriate basis set . </S>",
    "<S> based on this picture , the fano interference in the conductance spectra of the dqd system is readily explained . </S>",
    "<S> the possibility of manipulating the fano lineshape in the tunneling spectra of the dqd system is explored by tuning the dot - lead coupling , the inter - dot coupling , the magnetic flux threading the ring connecting dots and leads , and the flux difference between two sub - rings . </S>",
    "<S> it has been found that by making use of various tuning , the direction of the asymmetric tail of fano lineshape may be flipped by external fields , and the continuous conductance spectra may be magnetically manipulated with lineshape retained . </S>",
    "<S> more importantly , by adjusting the magnetic flux , the function of two molecular states can be exchanged , giving rise to a swap effect , which might play a role as a qubit in the quantum computation . </S>"
