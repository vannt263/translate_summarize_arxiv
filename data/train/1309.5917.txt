    "the insb(001 ) substrates were cleaned by repeated cycles of sputtering and annealing up to 700 k. prior to sn deposition , the substrates were covered with 1 ml of bi . we also grew the sn films without pre - deposition of bi for the sake of comparison .",
    "sn was deposited from a knudsen cell and the as - grown films were annealed up to 470 k. the deposition rate of bi and sn were monitored by a quartz microbalance and calibrated using both auger and core - level photoelectron spectra .",
    "figure 1s ( a ) shows the core - level spectra of the sn(001 ) film .",
    "bi @xmath40 is much more intense than sb @xmath41 and in @xmath41 , implying that bi segregates at the surface during the sn growth and forms the topmost atomic plane of the sample .",
    "figure 1s ( b ) shows sn 4@xmath42 core levels from 24 ml bi / sn film ( the upper spectrum ) and that grown on the sample holder ( the lower one ) , which is made of polycrystalline ta plate .",
    "since the @xmath43 phase is stable at room temperature , sn on the ta plate must be @xmath43-sn .",
    "the spectrum from the bi / sn(001 ) film is fitted well with sn 4@xmath42 ( dashed line ) and bi 5@xmath42 ( gray area ) components .",
    "in contrast , on ta , an additional broad component ( light blue area ) is required to fit the spectrum .",
    "it would originate from contaminants ( possibly , oxide layers on ta ) remained on the ta plate : the cleaning procedure used for insb(001 ) is not efficient for ta .",
    "the sn 4@xmath42 peaks from the bi / sn film are shifted with 230 mev from the @xmath43 sn on the ta plate .",
    "this core - level shift is consistent with the previous report about @xmath3-sn(111 ) grown on insb(111 ) @xcite .",
    "figures 1s ( c ) and ( d ) are the low - energy electron diffraction ( leed ) patterns of the insb(001 ) clean surface and the bi / sn(001 ) film , respectively .",
    "a low - background and sharp - spot leed pattern in fig . 1s ( d ) indicates the growth of a well - ordered @xmath3-sn(001 ) film with double - domain ( 2@xmath71 ) fractional spots . as shown by the dashed squares in fig .",
    "1s ( c ) and ( d ) , there are almost no difference of lattice constants between the insb(001 ) clean surface and the bi / sn(001 ) film .",
    "it indicates the in - plane lattice constant of the bi / sn(001 ) film to be close to that of insb ( 4.58  ) .",
    "this is consistent with that of @xmath3-sn ( 4.59  ) but quite different from those of @xmath43-sn ( @xmath44 = 5.83   and @xmath45 = 3.18  ) .",
    "this @xmath3-sn film is stable even after post annealing above room temperature .",
    "the sn film without bi also showed the double - domain ( 2@xmath71 ) leed pattern ( not shown ) .    a ( 2@xmath71 ) pattern suggests a dimer - row structure as in si(001 ) and ge(001 ) surfaces",
    "@xcite . since the films show double - domain patterns , there are variations in the film thickness of more than 1 ml : the dimer - row rotates from 90@xmath13 at each atomic step . in the bi / sn(001 ) films ,",
    "the topmost layer consists of bi , as indicated by the core - level spectra .",
    "based on the ( 2@xmath71 ) periodicity , the topmost sn dimers are possibly replaced with bi , as modeled in fig .",
    "4 ( c ) in the main text . in this model ,",
    "surface dangling bonds of the surface sn atoms are saturated by bi .      from the in - enriched clean surface of insb , in interdiffuses in the sn overlayer @xcite .",
    "it is reported that the maximum thickness of @xmath3-sn(111 ) films grown on sb - enriched insb(111 ) substrates is much larger than that grown on the substrates prepared by the cycles of sputtering and annealing , whose surface would be the in - enriched @xcite .",
    "it suggests that the in interdiffusion into upper sn layers reduces the quality of the epitaxial sn film .",
    "we deposited 1 ml of bi prior to the sn deposition , expecting that the initial bi layer may act as a barrier of such in interdiffusion .",
    "2s is the in 4@xmath42 levels after sn growths with / without bi .",
    "it shows two in @xmath41 components with the peak positions of 4@xmath46 at 58.1 ( @xmath47 ) and 58.6 ev ( @xmath48 ) , respectively .",
    "both of them were observed in the previous study @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the authors reported that ( i ) both components increase with the substrate temperature during the sn growth and ( ii ) @xmath48 corresponds to the in atoms that are chemically bonded with sn .",
    "based on ref .",
    "@xcite , fig .",
    "2s shows that sizable interdiffusion of in occurs in both films , indicating that in interdiffuses into the sn layer irrespective of the existence of pre - deposited bi .",
    "however , we could observe sharp leed patterns in both cases .",
    "it suggests that the in interdiffusion into sn layers is not so serious problem for the @xmath3-sn growth on insb(001 ) , other than the case of the insb(111 ) surfaces .",
    "figure 3s shows the arpes intensity plots of @xmath3-sn(001 ) films grown with ( a , b ) and without ( c , d ) bi at rather thin thicknesses . in these thicknesses ,",
    "the bi - covered film shows surface bands @xmath10 and @xmath11 and the dispersion of @xmath11 is isotropic .",
    "in contrast , the band dispersion of the  bare \" film shown in fig .",
    "3s(c , d ) are not isotropic but clearly exhibits the measurement - plane dependence . with the thickness around 10 ml",
    ", there is no qw states around @xmath9 , which are possibly the origin of the anisotropic surface - band dispersions of thick bi / sn(001 ) films .",
    "therefore , the arpes results of the  bare \" film imply the existence of the surface atomic structure forming the surface states that is absent on the bi / sn(001 ) films .",
    "figure 4s ( a ) is the same figure as fig .",
    "4 ( a ) in the main text . figure 4s ( b ) is calculated from the same slab as ( a ) , but the atomic orbitals of surface bi are included to calculate the radii of the circles for each electronic state . as shown in figs .",
    "4s ( a ) and ( b ) , there is almost no change on the spin - polarized surface states , indicating that the dirac cone observed / calculated in this work is not the surface states localized at the surface bi atoms .",
    "figure 4s ( c - e ) are the calculated band structures of the slabs with different surface atomic structures .",
    "figure 4s ( c ) is obtained from the bi / sn(001)-(2@xmath71 ) surface , the same atomic structure as figs .",
    "4s ( a , b ) .",
    "there is no surface bands dispersing around the fermi level in the projected bulk band gap , except for the dirac cone at @xmath0 .",
    "the clean sn(001 ) surface is modeled by replacing the surface bi of fig .",
    "4 ( c ) in the main text with sn , resulting the metallic surface states dispersing across the fermi level , as shown in fig . 4s ( d ) .",
    "these surface states originate from the dangling bonds of the topmost sn atoms .",
    "the dangling bonds can be saturated by adatoms , @xmath49 hydrogen .",
    "this saturation moves the metallic surface states away from the fermi level , as shown in fig .",
    "4s ( e ) . on such slabs with dangling - bond saturation ,",
    "the only surface states around the fermi level is dirac - cone - like spin - polarized ones .",
    "these results indicate that the saturation of dangling bonds on the surface is the essential condition of the surface electronic structure with single dirac cone . therefore , while the bi dimer - row model proposed in this work is just an assumption , the surface bi probably saturates the surface dangling bonds on the sn(001 ) surface somehow .    at @xmath0 in figs .",
    "4s ( d ) and ( e ) , there is a gap of 225 and 170 mev , respectively",
    ". it would be due to the hybridization between the dirac cones localized at the top and the bottom layers .",
    "@xcite . strictly speaking ,",
    "there is also a small gap on the bi / sn(001 ) slab with 35 mev .",
    "the difference of the gap sizes would be due to the different degree of the top - bottom interference influenced by each surface structure .",
    "this finite gap on the surface states was not observed experimentally in this work .",
    "probably , it is because the actual films are asymmetric with different structures at the top and the bottom faces , in contrast to the symmetric slabs we adopted for theoretical calculations .",
    "this asymmetry can protect the dirac cone from the interference between the top and bottom surface states , as observed on sb(111 ) thin films @xcite .",
    "the experimental geometry of the arpes experiments with linearly - polarized photons influences the observed states , because of the parities of the initial states with respect to the measurement planes . in our experimental condition ,",
    "the photon - incident plane is ( @xmath810 ) and the electric field of linearly - polarized photons lies in the incident plane . in this condition ,",
    "the dipole selection rule allows the photoelectron excitations from initial states with odd ( even ) parities with respect to the measurement plane along [ @xmath810 ] ( [ 110 ] ) .",
    "figures 5s ( c ) and ( d ) show the calculated states localized in subsurface sn layers as fig .",

    "<S> the overall energy resolution was set to 120 mev and the angular acceptance of the detector was @xmath241.8@xmath13 ( @xmath240.06 @xmath21 with 19 ev photons ) . as shown in the spin - resolved spectra , @xmath10 </S>",

    "<S> they correspond to clockwise ( cw ) helicity for the lower cone @xmath11 and counter cw ( ccw ) for the upper cone @xmath10 . </S>",
    "<S> simultaneously , we also measured the spin polarization along the surface normal . </S>",
    "<S> it shows almost negligible polarizations , indicating that the spin polarization of the dc on the sn(001 ) films lies almost completely in the in - plane direction . </S>",
    "<S> it could be due to the absence of the @xmath26 symmetry on the ( 001 ) surface @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> to obtain further insight into the electronic structure of the bi / sn(001 ) films , we performed density - functional - theory ( dft ) calculations . </S>",
    "<S> we used the  augmented plane wave + local orbitals \" method implemented in the wien2k code @xcite taking spin - orbit interaction into account . </S>",
    "<S> we adopted the modified becke and johnson potential together with the exchange - correlation potential constructed by using the local density approximation @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the film was modeled by a symmetric slab of 32 sn layers with the surface covered with ( 2@xmath71 ) dimers of bi , the structure of which was energetically optimized down to the 12th sn layer .    </S>",
    "<S> figure 4(a ) shows the calculated states along [ 110 ] and [ @xmath810 ] . </S>",
    "<S> the contrasts ( colors , online ) of the circles represent the spin polarization orientation of each state as defined in fig . </S>",

    "<S> the radii of the circles @xmath27 are defined by the function , @xmath28 where @xmath29 ( @xmath30 ) represents the atomic orbital in the @xmath31 th sn layer with cw ( ccw ) spin polarization , and @xmath32 is the eigenfunction of the calculated state at ( @xmath17 , @xmath33 ) . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the large circles in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 4(a ) represent the states which are spin - polarized towards cw or ccw directions and localized in the surface sn layers .    as shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 4(a ) , the calculated spin - polarized upper cone @xmath10 and lower cone @xmath11 agree with those experimentally observed . </S>",
    "<S> all states are calculated with smaller binding energies of @xmath1480 mev than what are observed . since the films we measured are double - domain ones , the overlap of the calculated states along [ 110 ] and [ @xmath810 ] should be observed by arpes . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath10 is isotropic along both lines and the observed @xmath11 bands would originate from [ @xmath810 ] . in addition , along [ 110 ] , there is another band @xmath12 which agrees with that observed along @xmath34 on the 34 ml film ( see fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2(j ) ) . </S>",
    "<S> the upper edge of the heavy - hole - like qw states is also spin polarized around @xmath0 , possibly due to the hybridization with dc . </S>",
    "<S> it could be the origin of the circular dichroism observed at @xmath200.15 @xmath21 . </S>",
    "<S> the bandgap between bulk - like qws around @xmath0 is 380 mev . counting in whole sbz , </S>",
    "<S> the gap is 230 mev : the conduction band minimum is around @xmath35 . for thinner films , </S>",
    "<S> the agreement between experiment and calculation is rather poor since the substrate effect can not be neglected .    in order to understand the role of surface bi , we calculated sn slabs with various surface structures without bi . </S>",
    "<S> the slabs with dangling bonds ( such as the ( 2@xmath71 ) clean surface ) made the other surface states dispersing around @xmath9 which is not observed in this work . </S>",
    "<S> on the other hand , once the dangling bonds are saturated by adatoms , such as bi and h , these artificial surface states disappeared . therefore , the main role of bi on the bi / sn(001 ) films is probably to saturate the surface dangling bonds . </S>",
    "<S> the detailed results are in the supplemental material @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the spin polarization orientations calculated for @xmath10 ( cw ) and @xmath11 ( ccw ) are opposite to those observed by spin - resolved arpes : cw ( ccw ) for @xmath11 ( @xmath10 ) . </S>",
    "<S> this is due to the photoelectron spin - flipping due to the polarization of photons @xcite . according to ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , the linearly - polarized photons in our experimental geometry flip the spin polarization of the photoelectrons measured along [ @xmath810 ] with respect to the initial states .    in order to explain the surface - state band evolutions observed in this work , we propose the following scenario ( see fig . </S>",
    "<S> 4 ( d ) ) . ( </S>",
    "<S> i ) for very thin films ( 12 ml ) , the strong interference between the top and bottom surfaces opens the bandgap on dc @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> ( ii ) by increasing the thickness , the topologically protected dc appears in the bandgap because the interference between both faces become weak . </S>",
    "<S> it corresponds to thicknesses from 20 to 24 mls in this work . </S>",
    "<S> ( iii ) at higher thicknesses , qw states with heavy - hole character appears in the gap and hybridize with dc . in this case , the pristine dirac point lies below the topmost heavy - hole - qw state . </S>",
    "<S> note that the upper part of the dc is still dispersing continuously in the gap between bulk - like qw states . </S>",
    "<S> this case corresponds to the films with thicknesses above 30 ml and consistent with what is calculated . </S>",
    "<S> ( iv ) at infinite thickness , the gap between heavy - hole and light - hole qws closes and the system becomes a 3d zero - gap semimetal . based on this model , phase ( ii ) and ( iii ) can be regarded as ti with spin - polarized dc . </S>",
    "<S> since such ti phase can be achieved only for finite thicknesses , it could be categorized as  quasi-3d \" ti . moreover , since the qw states in ( ii ) and ( iii ) have the inverted band structure which is necessary for ti , it would also hold the 1d edge states at the edge of the qw , as the case of hgte qw @xcite .    in conclusion </S>",
    "<S> , we have reported dirac - cone - like dispersion of surface states of @xmath3-sn(001 ) films covered with 1 ml of bi grown on insb(001 ) substrates . </S>",
    "<S> both the spin - resolved arpes and circular dichroism of arpes indicate helical spin polarization of the dirac - cone - like surface states . </S>",
    "<S> a bandgap in the film is estimated to be 230 mev showing that a new type of ti phase can be fabricated with ultrathin films of zero - gap semiconductors . </S>",
    "<S> based on the evolution of dirac - cone - like surface states with film thicknesses , we have demonstrated a new opportunity to fabricate ultrathin ti films with thicknesses down to few nm on conventional semiconductors . </S>",
    "<S> these results should offer new perspectives of applications in miniaturized electronic / spintronic devices .    </S>",
