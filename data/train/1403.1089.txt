    "the pattern of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) anisotropy field can be used to probe cosmology to high precision , as shown by the wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( wmap ) 9 years results @xcite and by the very recent _ planck _ cosmological results ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "cmb data have given a significant contribution in setting up the @xmath8 cold dark matter ( @xmath8cdm ) cosmological concordance model .",
    "the latter establishes a set of basic quantities for which cmb observations and other cosmological and astrophysical data - sets agree estimate from _",

    "in particular , the largest scales of the temperature anisotropies map are of great interest because they directly probe the early universe ( or inflationary phase of the universe @xcite ) .",
    "they correspond to angular scales larger than the horizon size at decoupling as observed today , i.e. @xmath12 or , equivalently @xmath13 ( see for example @xcite ) with @xmath14 being the multipole order of the spherical harmonics expansion @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the temperature anisotropy observed in the direction @xmath17 relative to the cmb average temperature @xmath18 ( @xcite ; see also @xcite for a constraint of the cmb black body shape ) , and with @xmath19 being the coefficients of the spherical harmonics @xmath20 .",
    "the main contribution to the cmb anisotropies at these large scales is provided by the so called sachs - wolfe effect and by a subdominant integrated sachs - wolfe effect @xcite which is different from zero because of the recent ( from a cosmological point of view ) transition to an accelerated phase of the universe @xcite likely associated to a dark energy ( or cosmological constant ) component . in principle a stochastic background of primordial gravitational waves can also give a contribution to the temperature cmb anisotropies at these largest scales , depending on the tensor - to - scalar ratio , @xmath21 , constrained by the current data @xcite .",
    "a firm detection of the primordial gravitational waves requires cmb b modes polarization measurement at large scale @xcite .    from the observational point of view the cmb anisotropies temperature map , as observed by wmap 9 year ,",
    "is cosmic variance dominated , i.e. , cosmic variance exceeds the instrument noise , up to @xmath22 , see @xcite . for _ planck _ data",
    "this crossing happens at @xmath23 @xcite .",
    "therefore , at the largest scales ( @xmath24 ) , the effect of instrumental noise is almost negligible . keeping this in mind , it is even more important to employ the most accurate data analysis tools .    in the current paper",
    "we focus on the angular power spectrum ( aps ) , which is the main observable for diagnosis of the cmb map .",
    "the method that is capable to provide aps with no bias and with the minimum variance , as provided by the fisher - cramer - rao inequality is the quadratic maximum likelihood ( qml ) method @xcite .",
    "such an optimal method has the drawback of being computationally expensive and then limited by the number of pixels .",
    "it is currently implemented and applied at low resolution ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "several other strategies for measuring @xmath25 at low resolution have been developed and applied to cmb data with excellent results .",
    "these methods include different sampling techniques such as gibbs @xcite , adaptive importance @xcite and hamiltonian @xcite . at high multipoles ( @xmath26 , @xcite )",
    "the so called pseudo-@xmath25 algorithms are usually preferred to others techniques .",
    "these methods , in fact , implement the estimation of power spectral densities from periodograms @xcite .",
    "basically , they estimate the @xmath27 through the inverse harmonical transform of a masked map that is then deconvolved with geometrical kernels and corrected with a noise bias term .",
    "these techniques , such as master @xcite , cross - spectra @xcite , give unbiased estimates of the cmb power spectra and moreover , it has been shown they work successfully when applied to real data at high multipoles @xcite .",
    "these estimators are pretty quick and light from a computational point of view . however , it is well known that at low multipoles they are not optimal since they provide power spectra estimates with error bars larger than the minimum variance .",
    "we note that in @xcite an hybrid approach has already been proposed , i.e. the qml at low and the pseudo-@xmath25 at high multipoles , where a recipe for an hybrid covariance is consistently given .",
    "however , in that paper the qml is considered only up to @xmath28 since it is applied to maps with a full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) @xmath29 .",
    "the aim of the present work is to compare quantitatively the qml and pseudo-@xmath25 methods under _ realistic _ assumptions focusing on the largest scales ( i.e. low multipoles ) where cmb anomalies are mainly located @xcite .",
    "the idea is to provide the scientific community with a reference analysis comparing the heavy qml method and the light and quick pseudo-@xmath25 approach in the range of multipoles @xmath13 .",
    "here we quantitatively address this problem through realistic monte carlo ( mc ) simulations .",
    "a similar analysis has been carried out by wmap team using the so - called @xmath30 method employed in @xcite that shows an improvement with respect to the pseudo-@xmath25 method mostly located at very low multipoles and in the intermediate s / n regime . moreover",
    ", we evaluate the benefit of considering an optimal aps estimation taking into account some examples of estimators of anomalies that are commonly used at large scales to test the consistency of the observations with the @xmath31 model .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ descriptionscodes ]",
    "we describe the considered implementations of qml and pseudo-@xmath25 codes , called respectively _ bolpol _ and _ cromaster_. in section [ computationalrequirements ] the computational requirements for both the methods are given .",
    "section [ comparison ] is devoted to the detailed description of the comparison and corresponding results .",
    "examples on how the previous analysis propagates to the aps based estimators , commonly used in literature for the analysis of the large scales anomalies , are provided in section [ wmap ] .",
    "conclusions are drawn in section [ conclusions ] .",
    "in this section we give a description of the two considered aps estimators .",
    "specifically we consider _ cromaster _ , as an implementation of pseudo-@xmath25 method and _ bolpol _ as implementation of the qml estimator .      in order to evaluate the aps of full sky and",
    "masked sky maps _ bolpol _ code adopts the qml estimator , introduced in @xcite . in this section",
    "we describe the essence of this method . given a cmb temperature map @xmath32 , the qml provides estimates @xmath33 of the tt aps as    @xmath34 , \\ ] ]    where @xmath35 is the fisher matrix , defined as    @xmath36 , \\ ] ]    and the @xmath37 matrix is given by    @xmath38    with @xmath39 being the global covariance matrix ( signal plus noise contribution ) .",
    "although an initial assumption for a fiducial power spectrum @xmath25 is needed in order to build the signal covariance matrix @xmath40 , it has been proven that the qml method provides unbiased estimates of the power spectrum contained in the map regardless of the initial guess @xcite ,    @xmath41    where the average is taken over the ensemble of realizations ( or , in a practical test , over mc realizations extracted from @xmath42 ) . on the other hand , the covariance matrix associated to the estimates",
    "is given by the inverse of the fisher matrix    @xmath43    only when the fiducial spectrum @xmath44 . in this case",
    "the inverse of the fisher matrix provides the minimum variance .",
    "according to the cramer - rao inequality , which sets a limit to the accuracy of an estimator , equation ( [ eq : error bars ] ) tells us that the qml has the smallest error bars .",
    "the qml is then an _ optimal _ estimator because equations ( [ eq : unbiased ] ) and ( [ eq : error bars ] ) are both satisfied .    for a generalization to polarization spectra see @xcite .",
    "_ cromaster _ is an implementation of the pseudo-@xmath25 method proposed by @xcite , extended to allow for both auto- and cross - power spectrum estimation ( see @xcite for a comparison ) .",
    "a given sky map @xmath32 can be decomposed in cmb signal and noise as @xmath45 , and we define the masked sky pseudo - spectrum as : @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the pseudo - spectrum of the sky signal , @xmath48 is the pseudo - spectrum of the noise present in the map , and the pseudo-@xmath19 coefficients are computed as : @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the applied mask .    in order to recover the full sky power spectrum , we employ the following estimator : @xmath51 where the mode - mode coupling kernel @xmath52 is a geometrical correction that accounts for the loss of orthonormality of the spherical harmonic functions in the cut sky ( see @xcite for more details ) .",
    "in fact , for an isotropic sky signal that is a realization of a theoretical power spectrum @xmath25 , one can write : @xmath53 hence , equation ( [ eq : pseudocl ] ) defines an unbiased estimator provided that the noise term @xmath48 is properly removed , which is usually done through mc simulations .",
    "however , for current generation high - sensitivity experiments , such as _ wmap _ and _ planck _ , the noise bias has to be known to better than @xmath54 accuracy , and therefore the cross - spectrum approach is preferred ( see , e.g. @xcite ) . in the latter case ,",
    "the pseudo-@xmath25 are computed by combining the spherical harmonic coefficients from two or more maps with uncorrelated noise so that the ensemble average of @xmath55 is null , making the cross - spectrum estimator naturally unbiased .    for practical applications , i.e. involving colored noise properties and arbitrary masks incorporating possible non - uniform weighting of the data , there is no readily available exact analytical expression for the covariance matrix of this estimator .",
    "the error bars for pseudo-@xmath25 methods can be roughly approximated as : @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the effective fraction of the sky used for the analysis which accounts for the weighting scheme of the pixels . for a given sky coverage ,",
    "a uniform weighting scheme produces the largest @xmath58 and is therefore the optimal choice in the signal dominated regime , which corresponds to large angular scales . on the other hand ,",
    "an inverse noise weighting scheme reduces @xmath59 and is the best choice in the noise dominated regime , i.e. at small angular scales .",
    "a trade off between the two weighting scheme should be applied in the intermediate regime , and an optimal pseudo-@xmath25 method should employ the best weighting scheme at a given multipole according to the s / n ratio at that multipole .    in order to derive an accurate estimate of the covariance matrix ,",
    "the original approach proposed in @xcite is to rely on signal and noise mc simulations : @xmath60 this approach has been widely used ( see e.g. @xcite ) , and it is also the baseline procedure for _ cromaster _ used for the analysis reported in this paper , we generate a set of fake @xmath61 by resampling the observed @xmath62 with uniform probability , and these are used to compute a set of fake @xmath33 to be fed into equation ( [ eq : mccov ] ) to estimate the diagonal elements of the matrix . in order account for the sky cut ,",
    "only @xmath63 elements of the @xmath61 are averaged to compute the fake @xmath33 .",
    "this is a very fast procedure based only on real data , and it is especially useful for testing purposes ( i.e. when having a quick look to the data or checking for instrumental systematic effects ) .",
    "however , it is not accurate enough for cosmological analysis especially at low multipoles and when only a small fraction of the sky is considered . for this reason ,",
    "we do not employ it here . ] .",
    "estimating off - diagonal elements of the covariance matrix with high accuracy requires a huge number of simulations .",
    "in fact , assuming that the covariance estimate is wishart distributed , the uncertainty on the diagonal elements simply scales as @xmath64 , while for the off - diagonal elements it scales as @xmath65 , which is significantly worse in the presence of small correlations .",
    "@xcite proposed an analytical approximation involving measured auto- and cross - power spectra which is accurate only at high multipoles and for large sky fraction . _",
    "planck _ power spectrum covariance is also based on an analytical approximation @xcite , that apart from being rather more complex , involves a fiducial model @xmath25 as well as assuming uncorrelated pixel noise .",
    "_ bolpol _ is a fully parallel implementation of the qml method , as described in section [ bolpol ] , written in fortran90 .",
    "since the method works in pixel space the computational cost rapidly increases as one considers higher resolution maps of a given sky area .",
    "the original code , that has been applied to wmap 5 year data in @xcite , to wmap 7 year data in @xcite , and to wmap 9 year data in @xcite , performs the analysis both in temperature and polarization .",
    "here we consider a modification of such implementation that works only on the temperature sector and can therefore ingest higher resolution maps than the original code .",
    "the following computational requirements are referred to this version of _ bolpol _ which has been already applied to _ planck _",
    "data @xcite .",
    "the inversion of the covariance matrix * c * scales as the third power of the side of the matrix , i.e. @xmath66 being @xmath67 the number of observed pixels .",
    "the number of operations is roughly driven , once the inversion of the total covariance matrix is done , by the matrix - matrix multiplications to build the operators @xmath68 in equation ( [ el ] ) and by calculating the fisher matrix @xmath69 given in equation ( [ ff ] ) .",
    "the memory , ram , required to build these matrices is of the order of @xmath70 where @xmath71 is the range in multipoles of @xmath72 ( for every x ) that are built and kept in memory during the execution time .",
    "this implementation is memory demanding , but it has the benefit of speeding up the computations .",
    "for a temperature all - sky map of 49152 pixels ( resolution parametrized by the healpix parameter @xmath73 is implicitly defined by @xmath74 , where @xmath75 is the total number of pixels in a cmb map .",
    "] , see @xcite ) , the total amount of ram needed by _ bolpol _ is 19 tb .",
    "when we run the code into massively parallel computer clusters such as fermi , at cineca , it takes roughly one day using 16384 cores to perform a mc of 1000 maps with 20% of the sky masked .",
    "possible future development and optimization of the code will lead the qml method to analyse higher resolution maps , but , at the moment , the qml method can be applied only to low resolution , i.e. large angular scales .    on the other side _",
    "cromaster _ is very light and can be easily run on a common laptop since it works in harmonic space .",
    "the main idea of the paper is to compare the two aforementioned methods for aps extraction at the largest angular scales under realistic conditions .",
    "our goal is to quantitatively find out to what extent it is worth to use a qml method with respect to a quicker and lighter pseudo-@xmath25 approach .",
    "we consider several cases summarized in table 1 .",
    "the low resolution case , namely case 1 is parametrized by @xmath73 and corresponds to the maximum resolution that _ bolpol _ is currently capable to treat . the high resolution case , i.e. case 2 , with @xmath76 is analysed by _",
    "cromaster_. of course _ cromaster _ can be run also at higher resolution but this does not impact the range of multipoles where we wish to compare the two codes which essentially is @xmath13 . the noise value of @xmath77k@xmath78 at @xmath76 is the typical variance for a _ planck_-like experiment @xcite .",
    "the adopted value at large scale is still @xmath77k@xmath78 , that of course corresponds to an higher noise .",
    "this is done to regularize the numerics for this case . in practice , even if different , the noise levels for both cases of table 1 are negligible and this different treatment does not impact on the analysis we perform .",
    "each of the cases of table 1 is analysed with and without galactic masks . for the latter option",
    ", we used the wmap kq85 temperature mask ( fig .",

    "the former mask excludes about @xmath6 of the sky , the latter about @xmath79 . in the full sky case and in a signal dominated regime , the two codes are algebraically equivalent .",
