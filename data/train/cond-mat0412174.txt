    "simulation of exact many - body quantum dynamics is a highly non - trivial task even in the simplest models .",
    "however , such a capability is highly desirable for studies of the quantum behaviour of mesoscopic systems .",
    "first principles methods are particularly useful when there are several length , time , or energy scales of similar size , which makes simplifying approximations inaccurate .",
    "it is well known , however , that a calculation using an orthogonal basis is intractable because the size of the hilbert space needed to accurately describe the state grows exponentially with the number of subsystems .",
    "perturbation theory is often not useful either , owing to questions of convergence .",
    "other commonly used techniques  like the mean - field approximation  rely on factorizations of operator products , with unknown regimes of validity .",
    "a promising approach is to simulate stochastic equations derived from phase - space distribution methods such as the positive p@xcite and gauge p@xcite representations , or representations based on other separable basis sets . in such methods the quantum state is written as a probability distribution of off - diagonal system configurations , which are separable between local subsystems . for the case of the positive p representation , these subsystems are the spatial lattice points .",
    "the number of variables needed to specify a single configuration grows only _ linearly _ with the system size because they are separable .",
    "correlations between subsystems are contained in the details of the distribution , which is stochastically sampled .",
    "this very mild growth of the number of required variables is the reason that such methods lead to tractable many - body simulations .",
    "recent work has shown that any model with two - body interactions can be expressed by such a distribution of separable system configurations@xcite .    in this paper",
    "we develop reliable ways of estimating the feasible simulation time , which is limited in practise by the growth of the statistical error .",
    "this allows an assessment of simulation parameters before a potentially lengthy calculation is started .",
    "we apply our method to single and coupled anharmonic oscillators , and compare analytic and numerical results for the simulation time .",
    "we also investigate the quantum dynamics of a one - dimensional interacting bose gas .",
    "this calculation shows a unique and interesting behaviour under conditions of a sudden switch in the interaction strength .",
    "we observe correlation waves in which an otherwise homogeneous quantum gas develops wave - like structures only found in the relative coordinates .",
    "this is a particularly timely issue in view of recent developments in fibre optics and ultra - cold atomic bose gases .",
    "it is now possible to experimentally investigate large numbers of interacting bosons , under conditions where quantum coherence plays an important role .",
    "as an example , quadrature squeezing in quantum solitons was predicted using these techniques , and observed experimentally .",
    "ultra - cold atomic bose gas dynamics has been observed in a number of geometries . in these experiments , it is possible to modify external potentials in order to drive the quantum gas into a state very far from either the ground state or any thermal equilibrium state .",
    "more recently , experiments have demonstrated the possibility of dynamically varying the inter - particle potential .",
    "the main body of the paper is organized as follows : firstly the positive p method is summarized in section  [ method ] , and briefly compared to other approaches in section  [ hist ] .",
    "subsequently in sections  [ pptime ] and  [ mmode ] , the estimates of useful integration times are obtained , and their implications considered .",
    "these estimates are verified by numerical simulations of single - mode and multi - mode systems , in sections  [ ppempirical ] and  [ mex ] , respectively . as an example , in the latter section , the dynamics of spatial correlation functions in a 1d uniform gas are investigated .",

    "thus , the most highly occupied mode of a many - mode system limits the overall simulation time .      if we assume ( for the time being ) that inter - mode coupling does not significantly affect the time in which the most highly occupied mode reaches @xmath221 , one estimates that @xmath223),\\ ] ] where @xmath224 is the mean occupation @xmath225 at time @xmath226 , and @xmath227 is given by ( [ timefit ] ) . using the mean value @xmath228 appears justified since for usefully precise simulations at higher occupations we expect @xmath229 .",

    "thus , when simulating a field model , it is worthwhile to use the coarsest lattice for which physical predictions are not affected .",
    "linear coupling between modes is what complicates the physical behaviour , and consequently also the noise behaviour in a simulation .",
    "let us use the label @xmath235 for either @xmath38 or @xmath40 , and look at the short time fluctuations of the phase - space variables .",
    "these fluctuations can be separated as @xmath236 into the `` direct '' part due to local interparticle scattering as considered in detail for the single - mode anharmonic oscillator ( [ 1modeh ] ) , and secondary `` kinetic '' fluctuations .",
    "these are due mostly to transfer of direct fluctuations between modes by the kinetic inter - mode coupling , at least initially .    if @xmath237 , then properties based on the single - mode analysis ( such as the simulation time estimates ( [ ppsimtest ] ) and ( [ ppsimtime ] ) ) will be qualitatively accurate . a rough calculation for uniform gases at density @xmath238",

    "this is independent of the uniform density itself , and indicates that the additional fluctuations due to kinetic effects :    1 .",
    "become relatively more important with time . 2 .",
    "are more dominant for fine lattices .    once ( [ varikd ] ) becomes @xmath241 , deviations from the simulation time estimates of section  [ estim ] can be expected , although this simple analysis does not tell us whether inter - mode coupling decreases or increases simulation time .",
    "in general a decrease seems intuitively more likely , but an increase may occur if @xmath242 and @xmath243 become appropriately correlated to reduce overall fluctuations .",
    "as an example of many - mode dynamical simulations , we have simulated a uniform one - dimensional gas of bosons with density @xmath238 and inter - particle scattering length @xmath7 .",
    "the lattice is chosen with a spacing @xmath244 so that interparticle interactions are effectively local at each lattice point , and the lattice hamiltonian ( [ hamiltonian ] ) applies .",
    "the stochastic equations to simulate are ( [ itoequations ] ) .",
    "periodic boundary conditions are assumed .",
    "the initial state is taken to be a @xmath245 coherent wavefunction , which is a stationary state of the ideal gas ( i.e. when @xmath246 ) .",
    "subsequent evolution is with constant @xmath247 , so that there is a disturbance at @xmath248 when interparticle interactions are rapidly turned on .",
    "physically , this would correspond to the disturbance created in a bec by rapidly increasing the scattering length at @xmath249 by tuning the external magnetic field near a feshbach resonance .",
    "behaviour found in this uniform system will carry over without qualitative change to a 1d bec confined on a length significantly larger than the length scale of observed dynamical phenomena .",
    "most of these phenomena extend over the order of a healing length @xmath250 this is the minimum length scale over which a local density inhomogeneity in a bose condensate wavefunction can be in balance with the quantum pressure due to kinetic effects@xcite .",
    "a useful time scale here is @xmath251 ( the `` healing time '' ) , which is approximately the time needed for the short - distance @xmath252 inter - atomic correlations to equilibrate after the disturbance@xcite .",
    "here we calculate the dynamics of spatial correlation functions , which has not been previously investigated from first principles in this model .",
    "we consider values averaged over the location of one particle out of the pair / triplet since this is a uniform gas :    * first order * : @xmath253 this is a phase - dependent correlation function .",

    "a number of positive p simulations of a one - dimensional gas were made , with densities of @xmath261,@xmath262 , and @xmath263 , and various lattice spacings .",
    "the number of lattice points was varied between simulations taking on values from @xmath264 to @xmath265 depending on circumstances to encompass and resolve the phenomena seen .",
    "more lattice points were required at the higher densities where correlations were weaker , resulting in longer simulation times overall .",
    "figure  [ figmtsim ] compares the actual useful simulation times in simulations with what was predicted by expressions ( [ ppsimtest ] ) and ( [ ppsimtime ] ) .",
    "we can see that the fit is remarkably good despite inter - mode coupling .",
    "it is clearly seen also that the simulation time decreases with @xmath266 .",
    "note that values of @xmath168 are based on precision in @xmath267 .",
    "precision tends to become worse as higher - order moments of @xmath118 or @xmath119 become needed , in e.g. @xmath268 .",
    "this is simply because higher - order moments require the averaged quantity @xmath111 to be a higher - order polynomial in @xmath93 and @xmath124 , and in effect @xmath269}\\approx c^2{\\mathcal{v}}$ ] , with @xmath270 being approximately the order of moment .",
    "figures  [ figmg2 ] to  [ figmg ] show calculated correlation functions for the example system @xmath271 .",
    "we see enhanced pairing / tripling of particles at several preferred relative distances .",
    "these preferred interparticle distances increase with time .",
    "note that the local density @xmath272 is completely invariant , and _ this wave - like behaviour is seen only in the correlations_. it is interesting to note that the overall disturbance advances at a much faster rate than the peaks / troughs of the correlations .",
    "we also see that while long - range coherence is steadily lost , there is a short distance scale corresponding to the distance of the nearest two - particle correlation peak on which phase coherence is enhanced compared to the long - range situation .    significantly more detail regarding calculations with the uniform gas and the correlation waves seen can be found in @xcite , chapter 10 .",

    "the advantages of the positive p /gauge",
    "p method are its simplicity and versatility : equations to simulate are just the gp mean - field equations with added gaussian noise which , remarkably , is sufficient to account for all quantum mechanical features . also , there is no truncation of entanglement , no hard - wired conservation laws , and open systems are the standard .",
    "the method is trivially adaptable to parallel computation : just run each trajectory separately .",
    "the dynamical timescales that can be simulated in a given system using the positive p method , can be easily assessed `` on the back of an envelope '' using the simulation time estimates given here .",
    "the aim here is to assess the relative strength of fluctuations in phase - dependent variables due to direct noise terms @xmath274 and to mixing of noise ( @xmath222 ) from other modes by kinetic processes .",

    "@xmath280 labels lattice points in a fourier space such that @xmath281 , where @xmath282 , and @xmath283 is the full lattice extent in the @xmath63 dimension .",
