    "on scales @xmath1 mpc , the size of the largest known coherent matter aggregates , the density of galaxies in the local universe spans from @xmath2 0.2 @xmath3 in voids to @xmath2 5 @xmath3 in superclusters and filaments , @xmath2 100 @xmath3 in the cores of rich clusters , up to @xmath2 1000 @xmath3 in compact groups , where @xmath3 is the average `` field '' density @xcite .",
    "+ it has been known for decades @xcite that galaxy hubble type and local density are not independent quantities . in their analysis of nearby clusters , @xcite and @xcite agreed that the fraction of spiral galaxies decreases from 80% in the `` field '' , to 60% in the outskirts to virtually zero in the cores of rich clusters , compensated by an opposite increase of elliptical and s0 galaxies .",
    "morphological segregation is perhaps the clearest signature of the environmental dependence of the processes that govern the formation and evolution of galaxies .",
    "understanding the morphology segregation , i.e. the shaping of the hubble sequence in the various environments , has challenged astronomers for years : `` nature or nurture '' ?",
    "the issue is still hotly debated , as it involves many controversial fields of modern astrophysics , including observations , simulations and theories .",
    "+ with the advent of 10 m class telescopes we hope that galaxy evolution will be shortly disclosed observationally , much as in a rewound movie taken along the `` fossil '' sequence , from today s fully evolved nearby galaxies to the early objects forming their first stars far away in space and time .",
    "similarly we can imagine to shoot the movie of the morphology segregation by comparing frames of clusters taken at increasingly large @xmath4 .",
    "snapshots at @xmath0 would show the fully formed and evolved clusters with their final mix of e / s0/s .",
    "frames taken between @xmath5 and 0.5 would show an unchanged fraction of e , with the action focused on increasingly active spirals ( the butcher - oemler effect @xcite ) and a decreasing fraction of s0 @xcite .",
    "by @xmath6 the scene would be on clusters under formation , when large groups of galaxies coalesce .",
    "effective `` pre - processing '' is taking place in these low velocity - dispersion environments , where minor merging and tidal interactions among galaxies are shaping up the s0s @xcite .",
    "none has yet observed elliptical galaxies under formation at @xmath7 and beyond .",
    "but there is general consent that they should have formed at these early epochs , very much from `` nature '' and little from `` nurture '' , even before clusters existed @xcite .",
    "maybe in a decade from now , when the jwst will provide these last photograms , the full movie of the shaping of the hubble sequence will be on view , as many groups of researchers are focusing large efforts on it ( the morphs group @xcite , the cnoc1 group @xcite , the acscs team @xcite , the ediscs group @xcite and the team of van dokkum and collaborators @xcite ) .",
    "+ this is perhaps somewhat optimistic , however . pretending to understand galaxy evolution really means shooting a movie whose individual photograms",
    "are composed of seds , obtained combining best quality data taken over a large stretch of the electromagnetic spectrum , each individual band providing information on the evolution of a particular galaxy component .",
    "restframe uv fluxes and balmer emission line strengths are the best current , massive star - formation tracers .",
    "optical bands provide the morphology , nir bands trace the oldest stars , mir and fir the dust ( and extinction ) ; the radio ( continuum ) tells about the nuclear activity , the supernova rate and the magnetic fields , and the 21 cm line the primordial gas reservoir and its dynamics .",
    "+ the problem is that , as @xmath4 increases , characteristic features become unobservable or more difficult to observe . by @xmath8 ,",
    "for example , the h@xmath9 line ends up in the h band , a noisy place to carry out observations .",
    "the peak of the dust emission falls in the sub - mm bands where the sensitivity of telescopes will remain poor until alma .",
    "the 21 cm line drops to lower sensitivity and angular resolution bands where line correlators do not yet exist ( we are not aware of a single hi emission measurement taken beyond @xmath4=0.15 ) .",
    "furthermore , the movie s linear resolution decreases with @xmath4 , so that detailed morphological information quickly fades away .",
    "most dramatic is the lost of sensitivity with increasing @xmath4 . by @xmath10",
    "dwarf galaxies run completely out of the scene .",
    "meaningful , high - resolution seds in the whole luminosity range covered by galaxies are obtainable only at @xmath0 , providing the boundary conditions to models and simulations of galaxy evolution .",
    "+ the end point of the evolution is within the reach of modern telescopes .",
    "significantly less evolved galaxies can only be observed , with lower resolution , if they are more luminous .",
    "dwarf galaxies , ims , bcds and des , by far the most common types of galaxies in the universe , yet the less understood , can only be observed locally . +",
    "since the rate of evolution of galaxies is found to correlate primarily with their dynamical mass ( infrared luminosity ) according to a remarkably anti - hierarchical scheme ( ) that has been lately named `` downsizing '' , distant surveys might undersample low - luminosity , slowly evolving systems .",
    "this is why studying nearby clusters still is a worthwhile activity . +",
    "another pro of local clusters is that they are ideal laboratories for studying interaction mechanisms at high resolution .",
    "prototypes of all relevant mechanisms can be found in nearby clusters .",
    "abell 1367 , for example , contains perhaps the best known example of currently ongoing ram - pressure stripping ( cgcg 97 - 073 ) , a rare example of a merging system in a cluster ( ugc 6697 ) and even a local prototype of infalling group where pre - processing occurs at the present cosmological epoch ( see section [ prototype ] ) .",
    "infall was much more effective , but unfortunately hard to observe , in the past ( @xmath11 ) , when it contributed shaping the s0 galaxies ( pre - processing ) .",
    "+ so far we insisted on the importance of observing nearby clusters . among them",
    "we have focused the present review on three specific ones : virgo , abell 1367 and coma that are among the best studied in the universe .",
    "the variety of their conditions , e.g. spiral fraction , x - ray luminosity , kinematic properties , makes them suitable `` laboratories '' for comparing clusters in different evolutionary stages : near formation ( virgo ) , still significantly accreting ( a1367 ) , near virialization ( coma ) .",
    "+ honestly speaking , the present review was conceived while we were assembling `` goldmine '' , the galaxy database that we made available on the web ( goldmine.mib.infn.it ) @xcite .",
    "two third of the galaxies contained in goldmine belong in fact to these three clusters and a significant fraction of them are among the best sampled seds .",
    "this does not mean that we havent tried to review the work of other groups",
    ". certainly we havent done it as extensively as we should , and we apologize for that . + but why focusing the present review on late - type galaxies , that are less numerous , they evolve slower than the more intriguing s0s and es ? what can we learn from the handful late - type galaxies that still inhabit local clusters ?",
    "there are several reasons for concentrating on them .",
    "one is that , due to the fragility of their stellar and gaseous disks , they are sensitive probes of their environment .",
    "another is that , since their rate of evolution ( star formation history ) is mild and continuous , they provide a linear clock for evolution , as opposed to e whose action occurred suddenly in one brief and intense episode that occurred early in their life .",
    "spirals are also interesting because significant infall of galaxies of this type has occurred and is still occurring ( at decreasing rate due to the @xmath12 dominated universe ) onto clusters of galaxies .",
    "will they sooner or later evolve into lenticulars ? can we use them as probes of the cluster environment ?    to help better focusing the addressed issues , let s take a look at the coma cluster whose bright galaxy distribution is shown in figure [ coma_map ] .",
    "the early - type galaxies clearly mark the cluster density enhancement , whereas the late - type objects hardly trace the cluster at all , making @xcite to doubt their very membership to the coma cluster .",
    "the latter are very `` healthy '' objects , actively star forming , as witnessed by their average h@xmath9 e.w .",
    "( equivalent width ) of 35    ( with peaks of 78  ) .",
    "this perhaps explains why abell questioned their membership to coma , because the majority of galaxies observed in clusters shows no signs of recent star formation activity .",
    "he did nt know that some of these objects are not as in `` good shape '' as it looks at first glance , something that was realized 20 years later .",
    "the pioneering work of @xcite , continued by many other researchers , among them @xcite , showed in fact that galaxies at projected distances @xmath13 1 mpc from the center of coma suffer from significant neutral hydrogen deficiency ( see section [ the atomic gas ] ) , having lost from 30 % to 90 % of their original hi content .",
    "the first resolved map of their hi distribution was obtained even more recently by @xcite .",
    "it shows that in most highly or moderately deficient objects the hi distribution is asymmetric or significantly displaced from the parent optical galaxy .",
    "this phenomenon occurs in objects projected within the x - ray emitting gas in the coma cluster . for the interpretation of this observation , whether is due to ram - pressure stripping or to galaxy - galaxy or galaxy - cluster interactions , the reader is referred to the remaining of the discussion .",
    "however , generally speaking , a high hi deficiency represents perhaps the clearest signature of the interaction occurring to galaxies in the environment of rich clusters , in other words it gives a clear clue to their cluster membership .",
    "abell was wrong !",
    "these are bona fide cluster members .",
    "what future is reserved to these galaxies ? this is the type of issue addressed by the present review .",
    "the reader can find many excellent review papers in the literature that deal with the evolution of galaxies in the cluster environment @xcite each focused on a particular aspect or wavelength domain .",
    "the most recent achievements in cluster research are collected in the proceedings of the carnegie observatories astrophysics series , vol .",
    "3 : clusters of galaxies : probes of cosmological structure and galaxy evolution ( 2004 ) . with the present review",
    "we wish , for the first time , to consider together all aspects .",
    "the price we pay is that we must narrow down the reviewed interval of @xmath4 , in practice to @xmath4=0 .",
    "we start by reviewing the observational scenario ( sections [ constituents ] , [ obs_diff ] ) , covering the broadest possible stretch of the electromagnetic spectrum , from the gas tracers ( radio and optical ) , the star formation tracers ( uv and optical ) , the old star tracers ( near - ir ) and the dust ( far - ir ) .",
    "we continue by providing a review of models of galaxy interactions relevant to clusters of galaxies ( section [ models ] ) .",
    "we conclude with a discussion on what proposed model(s ) better interprets various aspects of the observational scenario ( section [ discussion ] ) , once again checking the models predictions on recent data on virgo , coma and a1367 .",
    "the atomic gas is the principal component of the ism in late - type galaxies , supplying the `` fuel '' that feeds the star formation . in normal , isolated galaxies",
    "the hi gas distribution outstands the optical disk : column densities of @xmath2 10@xmath14 atoms @xmath15 are observed at @xmath2 1.8 the optical diameter , with a relatively flat radial distribution , sometimes showing a central dip @xcite .",
    "the hi extension in the direction perpendicular to the disk is comparable to the optical thickness @xcite .",
    "+ because of its distribution the hi gas is weakly bound by the galaxy s gravitational potential well , thus it can be easily removed .",
    "it is therefore obvious to expect that the hi content and distribution of galaxies in clusters differ from those of isolated galaxies ( see the reviews by @xcite ) .",
    "the first study of the atomic gas properties of galaxies in the virgo cluster dates back to the sixties @xcite .",
    "since then , several hi surveys of this and other nearby clusters were carried out using single dish radiotelescopes @xcite and interferometers @xcite .",
    "owing to the survey of @xcite and to recent arecibo observations ( e.g. @xcite ) hi data are available for the entire late - type galaxy population in the virgo cluster , including dwarf irregulars and bcds .",
    "+ all works agree on the general conclusion that cluster galaxies have on average a lower atomic gas content than their isolated counterparts , as first noticed by @xcite .",
    "a quantitative determination of this difference could however not be assessed before the systematic hi properties of isolated galaxies were known .",
    "this fundamental step was achieved by @xcite who studied at arecibo a reference sample selected from the @xcite catalogue of isolated galaxies .",
    "@xcite defined the hi - deficiency parameter as the logarithmic difference between the observed hi mass and the expected value in isolated objects of similar morphological type and linear size .",
    "galaxies with an hi - deficiency parameter @xmath16 can be treated as unperturbed objects . + by comparing the statistical hi properties of galaxies in 9 nearby clusters with those of `` field '' objects of similar type and luminosity , @xcite and @xcite showed that clusters contain a large fraction of hi deficient galaxies , with the exception of unrelaxed , loose ones .",
    "this fraction is a strong function of the angular distance from the x - ray center @xcite .",
    "+ @xcite , by re - analyzing the @xcite catalogue showed that the most deficient galaxies are generally early - type spirals in radial orbits , while gas - rich galaxies have isotropic or circular orbits ( confirmed by @xcite ) . @xcite , analyzing the hi properties of @xmath2 1900 galaxies in 18 nearby clusters , concluded that 2/3 of the clusters are composed of hi deficient galaxies inside the abell radius @xmath17 .",
    "the residuals of the deficiency parameter is related to the galaxy morphology and not to their optical size : early - type spirals and probably dwarfs are more deficient than sbc - sc at any radii inside 2@xmath17 .",
    "the deficiency increases toward the cluster center , being significant for @xmath18 .",
    "they did not confirm the relationship between the fraction of hi - deficient galaxies and the cluster x - ray luminosity claimed by @xcite .",
    "+ @xcite have completed the hi observations of late - type cgcg galaxies in the coma supercluster .",
    "one important issue that they were able to address , given the completeness of their data - set , is on what scale the phenomenon of hi ablation holds .",
    "the hi deficiency parameter of individual galaxies is given in fig.[comadef ] as a function of the projected linear separation from the x - ray center of the coma cluster , out to 15 mpc , along with average values taken in bins of 0.5   ( from 0   to 2 ) and in bins of 1   further out .",
    "it is apparent that significant hi deficiency occurs out to approximately 3 mpc radius .",
    "little above one virial radius ( i.e. at 2.2 mpc , @xcite ) , the average hi content of the supercluster galaxies becomes indistinguishable from that of the field , in agreement with @xcite .",
    "we stress that the filaments constituting the `` homunculus legs '' @xcite , i.e. the groups / filaments in the immediate surrounding of the coma cluster , perhaps infalling toward coma ( not shown in fig.[comadef ] ) , are made of galaxies retaining 100 % of their hi content , identical to unperturbed , isolated galaxies .",
    "+ the hi survey of the virgo cluster has also been completed by @xcite , allowing to determine the radial distribution of the hi deficiency parameter of all spirals brighter than 18.0 mag ( only @xmath19 mag are plotted in fig.[comadef ] for consistency with coma ) .",
    "unfortunately for virgo the survey does not extend out in the low density region of the local supercluster as much as in coma , but only out to 3.2 mpc .",
    "we find that in virgo there is a significant population of non - deficient galaxies at all radii , mixed with highly deficient ( @xmath201 ) ones .",
    "these exist within 2.2 mpc , just above 1 virial radius ( i.e. at 1.7 mpc , @xcite ) .",
    "furthermore it is found that individual groups constituting the virgo cluster ( cloud n and s for example ) contain less than 10 % highly deficient objects , compared to 33% in cluster a ( m87 ) .",
    "+ high resolution hi mapping of galaxies in the virgo cluster with the westerbork @xcite and vla @xcite interferometers , and more recently in the coma cluster @xcite revealed that cluster galaxies not only suffer from significant hi depletion , but that their hi distribution is less extended than isolated objects of similar morphological type and luminosity @xcite .",
    "+ while in normal isolated late - type galaxies the hi diameter ( as measured at the 10@xmath14 atoms @xmath15 isophote ) is on average a factor of @xmath2 1.8 larger than the optical isophotal @xmath21 band 25 mag arcsec@xmath22 diameter ( somewhat depending on the morphological type ) , in cluster objects the hi to optical diameter ratio strongly depends on the hi - deficiency parameter and on the distance from the cluster center @xcite .",
    "the most hi - deficient objects close to the x - ray center of virgo have hi diameters up to @xmath2 5 times smaller than the optical ones @xcite .",
    "anemic galaxies whose hi disks are slightly smaller than the optical ones , have significantly lower hi column densities",
    "( by a factor of @xmath2 10 ) than normal , isolated objects of similar morphological type @xcite .",
    "the hi surface density correlates tightly with the hi - deficiency parameter @xcite .",
    "asymmetries in the hi distribution and displacements of the gas from the optical parent galaxies are frequently observed in moderately hi deficient objects @xcite .",
    "+ the hi mass function of the virgo cluster was found by @xcite to differ significantly from the one in the `` field '' due to the combined effect of morphology segregation and presence of hi - deficient objects .",
    "a similar result was recently obtained by @xcite who found , on average , a decrease of @xmath23 and a flattening of the low - mass end of the hi mass function in high density environments .",
    "+ the recently initiated arecibo legacy fast alfa ( alfalfa ) survey aims to map @xmath27000 @xmath24 of the high galactic latitude sky visible from arecibo @xcite . the survey will detect on the order of 20,000 extragalactic h i line sources out to @xmath25 and enable a first wide - area blind search for local h i emitters .",
    "environmental studies will greatly benefit from this survey .      the molecular gas phase , even if it represents only @xmath2 15 % of the total gas reservoir in normal , late - type galaxies @xcite , is the component of the ism that takes direct part to the process of star formation . the hi gas has in fact to condense inside molecular clouds before collapsing to form stars .",
    "it is thus expected that any possible external perturbation induced by the environment on the molecular gas can have important consequences on the star formation activity , and thus on the evolution of late - type galaxies .",
    "+ early systematic works aimed at determining the molecular gas properties of late - type galaxies in clusters are the co surveys of virgo by @xcite , @xcite and @xcite and that of coma by @xcite . using a @xmath26 conversion factor @xmath27=@xmath28 between the intensity of the co line and the column density of the molecular hydrogen calibrated on the milky way , these authors estimated the molecular hydrogen mass @xmath29 of cluster galaxies .",
    "their immediate conclusion was that cluster galaxies have a normal molecular gas content and the interpretation was that molecular gas , being more centrally peaked , deep inside the potential well of the galaxy , than the atomic gas , can not be easily removed by any stripping mechanism @xcite .",
    "molecular gas removal could be effective only in low - mass galaxies with shallow potential wells , explaining the apparent co deficiency of low - luminosity virgo galaxies @xcite .",
    "+ this result suffers however from several biases .",
    "it firstly resides on the hypothesis that the relation between the co line intensity and the h@xmath30 gas column density is universal .",
    "@xcite showed however that @xmath27 varies by more than a factor of 10 over the sampled range of uv radiation field , metallicity , morphological type and luminosity .",
    "the second limitation is the lack of a co reference sample of isolated galaxies selected according to criteria similar to the cluster @xcite .",
    "for example the co survey by @xcite is mostly fir selected , thus biased toward strong co emitters @xcite .",
    "+ to overcome these difficulties @xcite and @xcite obtained co observation of an optically selected sample of isolated galaxies .",
    "they applied a luminosity - dependent co to h@xmath30 conversion factor , calibrated on the nearby galaxies with an independent measure of @xmath27 : @xmath31 from a @xmath32 band luminosity - h@xmath30 mass relation calibrated on the reference sample of isolated galaxies selected following similar criteria @xcite : @xmath33 they obtained , in full analogy with the hi deficiency @xcite an h@xmath30 deficiency parameter defined as : @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the expected molecular gas mass of a galaxy of a given @xmath32 luminosity as determined from eq .",
    "[ eq2 ] and @xmath36 is the observed molecular gas mass @xcite .",
    "+ the lack of relationship between the hi and the h@xmath30 deficiency parameters confirms and extends to lower luminosities similar previous claims obtained in coma @xcite and in virgo @xcite .",
    "the low luminosity , co deficient spiral galaxies found in virgo by @xcite are not necessarily deficient in molecular hydrogen since their h@xmath30 mass was probably underestimated assuming a constant @xmath27 conversion factor . + we conclude that cluster galaxies are significantly deficient in atomic hydrogen , but their molecular content is , on average , normal .",
    "metals are produced and injected into the interstellar medium by massive stars through stellar winds and supernova explosions .",
    "they play a fundamental role in the process of star formation .",
    "since they are produced by stars during their evolution , they can be used to constrain the star formation history of galaxies .",
    "+ @xcite analyzed the effects of the environment on the metal content of spiral galaxies by comparing the metallicity gradients observed in 9 objects in the virgo cluster with similar measurements of isolated objects of equal type .",
    "the 9 galaxies were selected to span a large range in hi - deficiency and angular distance from the cluster center .",
    "hi - deficient galaxies in the center of virgo have , on average , higher metallicity ( 0.3 to 0.5 dex in o / h ) than hi normal galaxies at the periphery of the cluster or isolated objects with similar morphology and luminosity @xcite .",
    "moreover @xcite showed that hi deficient virgo galaxies have shallower abundance gradients than normal objects .",

    "can not be applied to highly hi deficient galaxies because these lines are not detected in these objects . ]",
    "a similar trend was also observed for the dwarfs , which , in dense environments , seem to have higher metallicities than isolated objects @xcite .",
    "the unanimous interpretation of this finding is that metals in cluster galaxies are less diluted in the unpolluted gas , due to hi ablation .",
    "dust grains of different size and composition build up from metals produced by stars and injected into the ism by stellar winds and supernovae explosions .",
    "dust plays an important role in the process of star formation since atoms of hydrogen condense on dust grains to form h@xmath30 molecules @xcite .",
    "the interstellar dust is observable in absorption at ultraviolet and optical wavelengths and in emission in the mid- and far - ir , as the infrared astronomy satellite ( iras ) dramatically revealed @xcite .",

    "the emission is dominated by very small grains , while in the mid - ir ( 5 - 15 @xmath38 m ) it comes mostly from unidentified infrared bands ( uib ) , probably associated to planar molecules , called pahs @xcite .",

    "+ the mid - ir ( 5 - 18 @xmath38 m ) emission per unit galaxy mass of normal , late - type galaxies in the virgo cluster does not depend on the distance from the cluster center @xcite , thus it can be tentatively concluded that the carriers of the ir bands , dominating the emission at these wavelengths , are not affected by the cluster environment .",
    "+ using far - ir iras data for a sample of @xmath2 200 galaxies in 7 nearby clusters , @xcite showed that optically selected cluster galaxies have a normal far - ir ( 60 - 100 @xmath38 m ) emission .",

    "<S> the transformations taking place in late - type galaxies in the environment of rich clusters of galaxies at @xmath0 are reviewed . from the handful of late - type galaxies that inhabit local clusters , whether they were formed in - situ and survived as such , avoiding transformation or even destruction or if they are newcomers that recently infall from outside , we can learn an important lesson on the latest stages of galaxy evolution . </S>",
    "<S> we start by reviewing the observational scenario , covering the broadest possible stretch of the electromagnetic spectrum , from the gas tracers ( radio and optical ) , the star formation tracers ( uv and optical ) , the old star tracers ( near - ir ) and the dust ( far - ir ) . </S>",
    "<S> strong emphasis is given to the three nearby , well studied clusters virgo , a1367 and coma , representative of different evolutionary stages , from unrelaxed , spiral rich ( virgo ) to relaxed , spiral poor clusters ( coma ) . </S>",
    "<S> we continue by providing a review of models of galaxy interactions relevant to clusters of galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> prototypes of various mechanisms and processes are discussed and their typical time - scales are given in an appendix . </S>",
    "<S> + observations indicate the presence of healthy late - type galaxies falling into nearby clusters individually or belonging to massive groups . </S>",
    "<S> more rare are infalling galaxies belonging to compact groups where significant pre - processing might take place . once entered the cluster , they loose their gas and quench their star formation activity , becoming anemics . </S>",
    "<S> observations and theory agree in indicating that the interaction with the intergalactic medium is responsible for the gas depletion . </S>",
    "<S> this process , however , can not be at the origin of the cluster lenticular galaxy population . physical and statistical properties of s0 in nearby clusters and at higher redshift , </S>",
    "<S> indicate that they originate from spiral galaxies transformed by gravitational interactions . </S>"
