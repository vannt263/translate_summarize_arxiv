    "@xcite it was shown that , in case of r  parity conservation , a light neutralino within the lnm , when it happens to be the lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) , constitutes an extremely interesting candidate for the dark matter in the universe , with direct detection rates accessible to experiments of present generation . more specifically , the following results were obtained : a ) a lower bound on @xmath5 was derived from the cosmological upper limit on the cold dark matter density ; b ) it was shown that the population of light neutralinos fits quite well the dama / libra annual modulation results @xcite over a wide range of @xmath5 ; c ) this same population can explain also results of other direct searches for dark matter ( dm ) particles which show positive results ( cogent @xcite , cresst @xcite ) or possible hints ( two  event cdms @xcite ) in some restricted intervals of @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "it is obvious that the features of the light neutralino population , and its relevant properties ( a - c ) , drastically depend on the intervening constraints which follow from new experimental results .",
    "of particular impact over the details of the phenomenological aspects of the lnm are the new data obtained at the cern large hadron collider ( lhc ) which , in force of its spectacular performance , is providing a profusion of new information . in this respect the most relevant results of lhc concern : i ) the lower bounds on the squark and gluino masses , ii ) the correlated bounds on @xmath6 ( ratio of the two higgs v.e.v.s ) and @xmath7 ( mass of the cp  odd neutral higgs boson ) derived from the searches for neutral higgs bosons into a tau ",
    "lepton pair , iii ) a new strict upper bound on the branching ratio for the decay @xmath8 , iv ) the indication of a possible signal ( at a statistical significance of 2.3 @xmath1 ) for a sm  like higgs boson with a mass of about 126 gev @xcite .",

    "the lnm is an effective mssm scheme at the electroweak scale , with the following independent parameters : @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath7 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",

    "however , in the case of r  parity conservation the neutralino , when occurs to be the lsp , has a lower limit on its mass @xmath5 which can be derived from the cosmological upper bound on the cold dark matter ( cdm ) relic abundance @xmath33 . actually , by employing this procedure , in ref .",

    "this is a property arising spontaneusly in our scenario .",
    "notice that although the br of higgs decay into 2 photons is typically smaller that the corresponding sm branchig ratio , @xmath149 can be sm  like , due to enhanced production cross sections .",
    "though imposing the above requirement would imply some further selection within the neutralino population previously discussed , we do not find in our scan any significant correlation between @xmath149 and the properties of relic neutralinos , such as the neutralino relic abundance @xmath150 or the neutralino ",
    "nucleon cross section @xmath151 .",
    "in fact @xmath149 is mainly affected by the production cross section @xmath148 , which depends on susy  qcd parameters that do not enter directly into the calculation of relic neutralino observables .",
    "although a thorough analysis of these aspects is beyond the scope of the present paper , the previous considerations are sufficient to conclude that our scenario can be compatible with the possible higgs signal at the lhc in a natural way .    _",
    "{ mssm}/[\\sigma(gg\\rightarrow h ) br(h\\rightarrow      \\gamma\\gamma)]_{sm}$ ] as a function of @xmath152 for the configurations discussed in section [ sec : generic ] .",
    "black points refer to @xmath46 masses in the range 115 gev @xmath153 131 gev , while ( red ) circles refer to a @xmath46 mass interval more focussed around 126 gev ( specifically : 125 gev @xmath153 127 gev ) . ]",
    "we have reviewed the status of the phenomenology of light neutralinos in an effective minimal supersymmetric extension of the standard model ( mssm ) at the electroweak scale , in light of new results obtained at the cern large hadron collider .",
    "first we considered the impact of the new data obtained by the cms collaboration on the search for the higgs boson decay into a tau pair , and by the cms and lhcb collaborations on the branching ratio for the decay @xmath0 , and we established that , on the basis of these data , the new value for the lower bound of the neutralino mass is @xmath154 18 gev .",
    "then we have examined the possible implications of the excess of events found by the atlas and cms collaborations in a search for a sm  like higgs boson around a mass of 126 gev , with a most likely mass region ( 95 % cl ) restricted to 115.5131 gev ( global statistical significance about 2.3 @xmath1 ) .",
    "we have derived that the excess around @xmath2 = 126 gev , which nevertheless needs a confirmation by further runs at the lhc , would imply a neutralino in the mass range 18 gev @xmath3 38 gev , with neutralino ",
    "nucleon elastic cross sections fitting well the results of the dark matter direct search experiments dama / libra and cresst .",
    "it is worth stressing that light neutralinos in the mass range considered here do not appear to be constrained by dm indirect searches ( such as astrophysical gamma fluxes of diffuse extragalactic origin or from dwarf galaxies , and the low  energy cosmic antiproton flux ) .",
    "a detailed investigation of these aspects would however deserve a dedicated analysis .",
    "after the submission of the present paper , a new upper bound ( at @xmath98 c.l . ) on the branching ratio for the decay @xmath0 has been presented by the lhcb collaboration : @xmath155",
    "if the previous upper bound @xmath156 , employed in our analysis , is replaced by the new lhcb upper limit , the lower bound on the neutralino mass rises from the value of about 18 gev , presented above , to about 20 gev .",
