    "ultrafast control of magnetization has become a hot topic recently  @xcite .",
    "not only does this technique have much potential for application , e.g. , fast data storage and spintronics  @xcite , but it also poses an important question in fundamental physics : can we coherently induce an ultrafast phase transition in many - body quantum systems ?",
    "terahertz ( thz ) laser  @xcite is preferred in terms of quantum coherence since its photon energy is comparable with the energy scale of spin systems . among spin systems ,",
    "quantum antiferromagnets are known to show rich many - body effects .",
    "a traditional way to study their properties is to measure the magnetization curve , i.e. , relation between magnetization and externally applied magnetic field .",
    "prominent phenomena such as various magnetization plateaux  @xcite , field induced topological states  @xcite , and bose - einstein condensation of magnons  @xcite have been discovered .",
    "however , the magnetization curve up to the saturated magnetization often requires an extremely high magnetic field .",
    "if we can realize the full magnetization process in table - top laser experiments , studies on nontrivial magnetic phenomena would be more accessible , but it is not easy due to the limited laser strength .",
    "the magnetic field component of a thz laser is typically less than 0.5 t , several orders below the necessary field strength ( @xmath0 t and more ) for full magnetization .",
    "we can overcome this difficulty with help from recent progress of quantum many - body systems in time - periodic external fields , which have been studied both theoretically  @xcite and experimentally  @xcite .",
    "in general quantum magnets , a proper unitary transformation maps a rotating magnetic field of a circularly polarized laser into an effective static magnetic field  @xcite .",
    "if the magnetic field rotates in the @xmath1 plane , the effective static field has a component in the @xmath2 direction , and its strength is given by the photon energy @xmath3 .",
    "for example , a laser with frequency of 1 thz ( @xmath41 thz@xmath5 mev ) can typically produce an effective field as strong as @xmath6 t. even stronger fields are obtained by increasing frequency @xmath3 , and it is reasonable to consider a possibility of `` laser - induced magnetization curves '' .",
    "our proposal is to change @xmath3 from a small value to a larger value as slowly as possible . in other words ,",
    "an upchirped thz laser pulse is required @xcite . in this paper ,",
    "starting from the zero field ground state ( gs ) , we show that the system under a upchirped laser almost follows the gs in static magnetic field up to full magnetization in time evolution of the wave function .",
    "this is a significant difference compared with an equilibrium magnetization curve obtained using high magnetic field facilities since we can wait for a sufficiently long time in order to make the system equilibrated in the latter case .",
    "thus , we need to find an appropriate protocol to realize the laser - induced magnetization curve .",
    "we determine ideal conditions to approach highly magnetized states and explain the mechanism by many - body landau - zener ( lz ) tunnelings  @xcite .",
    "in addition , in a particular model , we show that a symmetry protected topological ( spt ) plateau state  @xcite can be realized in this manner .",

    "the magnetic field of the laser generates a dynamical zeeman interaction , which results in a hamiltonian , @xmath7 the first term @xmath8 is the spin hamiltonian and the magnetic field of the laser @xmath9 rotates in the @xmath1 plane .",
    "the operator @xmath10 is the @xmath11 component of the total spin and @xmath3 is the laser frequency .",
    "here we assume that the spin hamiltonian @xmath8 is invariant under u(1 ) spin rotation around the @xmath12 axis .",
    "if we apply the time - dependent unitary transform @xmath13 to such u(1)-symmetric magnets under the laser , we obtain the following relation , @xmath14 this transform maps the system from the experimental frame to a rotating frame in spin space  @xcite . in this rotating frame , the hamiltonian becomes _ static _ as follows ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : lasermagnet](b ) ) : @xmath15 we emphasize that this mapping from the dynamical system ( [ eq : hamiltonianwithlaser ] ) to the static one ( [ eq : effectivehamiltonian ] ) always holds when the laser is circularly polarized and @xmath8 is u(1 ) symmetric around the @xmath12 axis .",
    "the mapping does not depend at all on spatial dimensions , spin magnitude @xmath16 , and the other details .",
    "equation ( [ eq : effectivehamiltonian ] ) indicates that a laser with high frequency @xmath3 can lead to highly magnetized states due to the effective zeeman term @xmath17 .",
    "it also implies that the magnetization points in the opposite direction by changing the helicity of the laser . as we mentioned in the sec .",
    "[ sec : intro ] , it is difficult to increase the magnitude @xmath18 to a large value , while the laser frequency @xmath3 can be relatively easily tuned @xcite . therefore , the magnetization along the @xmath12 axis , @xmath19 , is expected to grow by increasing @xmath3 .",
    "however , we should note that even if we increase @xmath3 , the wave function of the magnet does not always follow the gs of the effective static hamiltonian ( [ eq : effectivehamiltonian ] ) .",
    "instead , the system may be in the excited states and the magnetization may be small or even absent .",
    "in fact , when @xmath8 has su(2 ) spin - rotational symmetry , one can understand that the growth of the magnetization does not occur as follows .",
    "the effective hamiltonian @xmath20 represents a quantum magnet under a static magnetic field @xmath21 . in the su(2)-symmetric case ,",
    "@xmath8 and the zeeman term @xmath22 commute with each other . as a result ,",
    "the total spin exhibits just a simple precession motion around the @xmath23 axis .",
    "this clearly indicates the absence of static growth of total magnetization . from this argument",
    ", we find that a magnetic anisotropy breaking the u(1 ) symmetry around the @xmath23 axis is necessary to generate nonzero static magnetization .",
    "notice that if the magnetic anisotropy conserves the u(1 ) symmetry about the @xmath12 axis , the mapping to the static system ( [ eq : effectivehamiltonian ] ) is still valid .",
    "fortunately , magnetic anisotropy generally exists in real magnetic materials .     in a su(2)-symmetric magnet @xmath8 and ( b ) in a magnet with magnetic anisotropy.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    based on a simple symmetry argument ,",
    "let us qualitatively compare time evolution of quantum states in anisotropic and isotropic ( su(2)-symmetric ) magnets , increasing the frequency @xmath3 .",
    "we assume that the gs of the su(2)-symmetric magnet is paramagnetic with @xmath24 .",
    "usually , its lowest excitation is given by spin-@xmath25 triplet with @xmath26 . if @xmath3 ( i.e. , the effective field @xmath27 ) is increased , the triplet excitations are split due to the zeeman effect as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : effmodel](a ) . at a certain value of @xmath3",
    ", a level crossing occurs between the gs and the lowest excitation of the triplet .",
    "however , if we start from the gs , the wave function is still equivalent to the gs even after the level crossing since there is no matrix element between the lowest two states due to the su(2 ) symmetry . on the other hand",
    ", if we consider a magnet with magnetic anisotropy , the level crossing generally changes into an _ avoided crossing _ as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : effmodel](b ) .",
    "when the frequency @xmath3 is monotonically increased , some weight of the wave function continuously follows the lowest - energy state and the total magnetization grows by unity , while the remaining weight tunnels into the upper state .",
    "this phenomenon would be described by the lz tunneling picture  @xcite . with further increasing of @xmath3 , avoided crossings between the lowest two states successively take place and the magnetization would gradually grow . in order to make a larger weight of the state",
    "follow the gs of eq .",
    "( [ eq : effectivehamiltonian ] ) , we have to suppress the lz tunneling probability @xmath28 in fig .",
    "[ fig : effmodel](b ) . from a theory of two - level lz tunneling , the probability @xmath28 is known to rapidly decrease with decreasing the varying speed of @xmath3 .",
    "this argument based on the lz tunneling clearly indicates that we should raise @xmath3 as slowly as possible to realize magnetized states by the laser .",
    "namely , an adiabatic change of @xmath3 is ideal .",
    "thanks to the recent development of laser technique , we can prepare lasers with gradually increasing its frequency @xmath3 . this technique is called _ chirping _  @xcite .    in conclusion ,",
    "the argument in this section tells us that circular polarization , magnetic anisotropy , and chirping of laser would be significant for the realization of laser - induced magnetization process .",
    "even if the magnetic anisotropy slightly breaks the u(1 ) symmetry , laser - induced magnetization is expected to occur .",
    "the idea of the laser - induced magnetization process discussed in the previous section could be applied to general quantum magnets . in the remaining part of this paper , in order to quantitatively study the laser - induced dynamics , we concentrate on two simple but realistic one - dimensional ( 1d ) spin-1/2 systems : heisenberg antiferromagnetic ( haf ) and ferro - ferro - antiferromagnetic ( ffaf ) models .",
    "the haf model explains properties of many quasi-1d magnetic materials while the ffaf model exhibits a 1/3 magnetization plateau state with a spt order as explained below , which describes @xmath29  @xcite .",

    "magnetic ( static ) and laser ( dynamic ) parts in the time evolution operator are separated ( @xmath38 ) , and the magnetization dynamics becomes trivial . as we mentioned in sec .",
    "[ sec : basicidea ] , we have to include a term that breaks su(2 ) symmetry in @xmath8 to lead to nonzero magnetization . as a small magnetic anisotropy term in @xmath8",

    ", we consider the case where the maximum field strength @xmath18 is small enough , e.g. , @xmath51 , while @xmath3 can increase up to a large value such as @xmath52 .",
    "though the increase of @xmath18 and @xmath3 occurs simultaneously in real laser pulses , here we split them into two processes to understand the effect of chirping alone .",
    "we first calculate the gss of @xmath53 and @xmath54 by exact diagonalization in finite systems ( @xmath55 ) , and then numerically integrate the time - dependent schrdinger equation @xmath56 for the magnets under a circularly polarized laser , using the fifth order runge - kutta method .",
    "hereafter , we use the normalized magnetization : @xmath57 where @xmath58 and @xmath59 is its saturated value .     in right - circularly , left - circularly , and linearly polarized lasers .",
    "we have used the same parameters as those of fig .",
    "[ fig : magcurve](a).,scaledwidth=30.0% ]    figure  [ fig : magcurve](a ) shows the laser - induced magnetization curve of the haf model plotted against the time .",

    "we will study the @xmath49 dependence later .",

    "here we have ignored @xmath62 and @xmath63 in the static calculation since they are very small .",
    "we observe that the laser - induced magnetization curve converges to the static curve in the large @xmath33 limit .",
    "the ffaf model shows similar behaviors with one additional feature : the @xmath64 plateau state . as plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : magcurve](b ) , with increasing @xmath33 , the laser - induced magnetization curve also converges to the static curve obtained by infinite time evolving block decimation ( itebd )  @xcite with matrix dimension @xmath65 . during the process , the magnetization shows a plateau around @xmath64 with a width almost independent of the system size .",
    "we also confirmed the realization of 1/3 plateau for the same models with other anisotropies such as ising - type and uniform dm interaction .",
    "in addition to the ffaf model , we also numerically confirmed that a laser - induced dynamical 1/3 plateau can be observed in a 1d @xmath66-@xmath67 spin model  @xcite .",
    "however , this system requires stronger dm interaction with @xmath68 for generating the laser - driven plateau .",
    "this would be because the transition to the plateau phase is accompanied with a spontaneous breakdown of translational symmetry in the @xmath66-@xmath67 model ( any symmetry breaking does not take place in the plateau of the ffaf model ) .",
    "a plateau with a broken symmetry is more fragile against perturbation than that with no symmetry breaking .    as we mentioned in sec .",
    "[ sec : basicidea ] , if we change the sign of laser frequency from @xmath3 to @xmath69 , which is equivalent to changing the polarization of the laser , the magnetization is expected to point in the opposite direction .",
    "we confirm this prediction in the one - dimensional ( 1d ) haf model .",

    "in fact , we can prove rigorously that the size of induced magnetization is the same and the direction is opposite for right- and left - circularly polarized lasers applied to haf and ffaf magnets with ising , uniform dm , and staggered dm anisotropies ( see appendix  [ sec : polarization ] ) .",
    "it is also shown that the magnetization induced by linearly polarized laser is exactly zero .",
    "although such a rigorous proof does not exist in general systems ( e.g. , systems in more than one dimension ) , it is expected that the magnetization points in the opposite direction if circular polarization is reversed . moreover ,",

    "this result is almost independent of the system size @xmath33 .",
    "thus , we conclude that if the chirping speed @xmath49 is sufficiently small , the spt phase can be achieved dynamically . in a rigorous sense , we have to switch off the laser amplitude or neglect the dm anisotropy in order to protect the topological properties of the dynamical plateau state  @xcite .",
    "such a subtlety can be avoided in the case of ising anisotropy .",
    "we have proposed a novel scheme of `` laser - induced magnetization curves '' for general quantum magnets .",
    "an upchirped circularly polarized laser in the thz regime is required , and the material must have small but finite magnetic anisotropy . from our numerical calculation in realistic spin models ,",
    "the criterion for laser strength and chirping speed was obtained , which is explained by the lz picture . using this method",
    ", it is even possible to realize a spt phase dynamically . in this paper",
    ", we have demonstrated laser - induced magnetization curves in two types of magnets : haf and ffaf chains . however , as can be seen from our analyses , this phenomenon does not exploit specific properties of these magnets .",
    "therefore , we again stress that laser - induced magnetization curves would be attained by laser chirping in a wide variety of magnetic materials in any dimension .",
    "we also note that the direction of the magnetization growth can be changed by switching the helicity of the laser .",
    "in addition to the above necessary condition for the magnetization dynamics , let us briefly discuss some desired conditions for easily realizing a higher value of laser - induced magnetization .",
    "large magnetic anisotropies are desired to open a wide gap @xmath87 in fig .",
    "[ fig : zenertunnel](a ) .",
    "magnets with large spin magnitude @xmath16 are preferred since the value @xmath16 is regarded as the coupling constant of the zeeman term , namely a large value @xmath16 helps the laser amplitude to effectively increase .",
    "when the zeeman coupling is too small , effects of the laser might be masked by several noises such as thermal fluctuation , dipole interaction , spin - phonon coupling , and so on .",
    "magnets with ferromagnetic exchanges are also favorable since a ferromagnetic interaction generally decreases the value of saturation field and it reduces the necessary time of chirping . the time interval of chirping needed for full magnetization curves in fig .",
    "[ fig : magcurve ] is estimated to be about @xmath139 for both haf and ffaf chains .",
    "assuming @xmath140 mev ( @xmath141 ps ) , it amounts to @xmath142 ns . it is generally difficult to generate an ideal upchirped laser for a long time interval in real experiments . however , even a nonideal laser is expected to generate a finite magnetization if the laser frequency is comparable to the exchange coupling of the target materials  @xcite . in an actual experimental setup , heating caused by laser",
    "would smear the plateau structure . in order to prevent such heating , we should choose the laser frequency far from any resonant frequencies of phonons , magnons , etc . :",
    "excitations which thermalize the sample .",
    "furthermore , if the lz gap is large enough ( thanks to , e.g. , large zeeman coupling ) , a laser would induce a finite magnetization before the temperature considerably increases .",
    "a pump - probe experiment with two laser pulses would be one of the simple realistic ways of measuring laser - induced magnetizations .",
    "we prepare a circularly polarized laser pulse to coherently control the magnetization of a target material .",
    "the other pulse is used to measure the magnetization , for example , through the inverse faraday or kerr effect .",
    "notice that the laser - induced magnetization curve differs considerably from standard magnetic resonance phenomena .",
    "our scheme does not have a specific energy scale concerning the laser frequency @xmath3 ( although @xmath3 should be the order of exchange couplings ) while a magnetic resonance usually happens ( or becomes strong ) at a certain frequency characteristic of the magnet .",
    "effects of dissipation from an environment and heating magnets by laser , which are not considered here , are important future problems . in this paper , to see the laser - driven dynamics of magnets , we have focused on finite - size systems .",
    "investigation on the effects of laser in the thermodynamic limit is another important issue .",
    "we finally comment on a possible combination of the current method and actual static magnetic fields .",
    "namely , a static zeeman term @xmath143 can be added to @xmath8 , and after the mapping from eq .",
    "( [ eq : hamiltonianwithlaser ] ) to eq .",
    "( [ eq : effectivehamiltonian ] ) , the total effective field becomes @xmath144 this fact would be practically useful in experiments .",
    "for example , we can study the destruction and recovery of the topological state starting from the plateau state in finite static fields and then applying a pulse circularly polarized laser .",

    "magnetization @xmath145 along the @xmath2 axis is induced when a right - circularly polarized laser @xmath146 is applied to haf and ffaf magnets with anisotropy . in the following , we prove that the induced magnetization becomes @xmath147 for an application of a left - circularly polarized laser @xmath148 in the case of haf and ffaf magnets with anisotropies of ( i ) ising , ( ii ) uniform dm , and ( iii ) staggered dm types .",
    "in addition , we can show that magnetization along the @xmath2 axis is exactly zero ( @xmath81 ) for a linearly polarized laser @xmath149 .",
    "we write the time - dependent schrdinger equation for the right - circularly ( left - circularly ) polarized laser as @xmath150 the initial states are the same , @xmath151 .",
    "\\(i ) ising anisotropy : let us consider @xmath152 rotation around the @xmath153 axis , @xmath154 .",
    "this rotation @xmath154 changes @xmath155 to @xmath156 and reverses the circular polarization from right to left in the zeeman term . on the other hand",

    "thus , @xmath158 . since the initial state is invariant under @xmath154 ( @xmath159 ) , @xmath160 is obtained by @xmath161 .",

    "the system is invariant under @xmath154 .",
    "then , @xmath83 is exactly zero due to @xmath162 .",

    "the succession of @xmath154 and @xmath163 does not change @xmath45 , @xmath46 , and uniform dm anisotropy @xmath165 while the circular polarization is reversed . from the same logic as in ( i ) ,",
    "@xmath166 . therefore , @xmath167 if the circular polarization is changed from right to left and @xmath81 for a linear polarization .",
    "\\(iii ) staggered dm anisotropy : we consider one ( three ) site translation of the system @xmath168 ( @xmath169 ) , i.e. , the site @xmath32 corresponds to @xmath170 ( @xmath171 ) .",
    "the succession of @xmath154 and @xmath168 ( @xmath169 ) does not change @xmath45 ( @xmath46 ) and staggered dm anisotropy @xmath172 while the circular polarization is reversed .",
    "thus , the proof is the same as in ( ii ) .",
    "we explain the reason why the lz gap for a magnetization step is proportional to @xmath173 in the ffaf model ( see eq .",
    "( [ eq : lzgap ] ) ) using perturbation theory with respect to @xmath18 and @xmath63 . following the main text , we focus on the finite system with @xmath78 .    through the unitary transform @xmath174",
    ", the effective static hamiltonian is mapped to @xmath175 in the limit of @xmath176 , the @xmath2 component of total spin @xmath177 is a good quantum number , and we can define the lowest energy states in @xmath178 ( @xmath81 ) and @xmath179 ( @xmath64 ) sectors as @xmath180 and @xmath181 , respectively .",
    "these two states come close to each other by tuning @xmath3 .    let us further perform a spin rotation around the @xmath182 axis",
    "so the magnetic field @xmath183 becomes parallel to the @xmath2 axis .",
    "the corresponding unitary operator is @xmath184 with @xmath185 and @xmath186 .",
    "we note that the angle @xmath187 is very small ( @xmath188 ) since the laser amplitude @xmath18 is usually much smaller than the frequency @xmath3 , i.e. , @xmath189 . via this spin rotation ,",
    "new spin operators are given as @xmath190 similarly , the hamiltonian is transformed into @xmath191 while @xmath192 .",
    "the second term @xmath193 is given by @xmath194 note that the form of @xmath46 is invariant under the rotation of @xmath195 due to the su(2 ) symmetry .",
    "here we introduce the normalized magnetization per site of the model @xmath196 as @xmath197 . in the case of @xmath198",
    ", @xmath199 is a good quantum number , and therefore we can define the ground states of @xmath200 ( @xmath201 ) and @xmath25 ( @xmath79 ) sectors as @xmath202 and @xmath203 , respectively . since @xmath189 and the angle @xmath187 is very small , the two states @xmath204 and @xmath203 are respectively very close to @xmath180 and @xmath181 .    for the effective hamiltonian @xmath196 , let us treat the second term @xmath205 as the perturbation . when @xmath198 , the energy levels of @xmath206 and @xmath207 cross at a certain point , @xmath208",
    ". however , this degeneracy is lifted and the level crossing becomes a level repulsion when @xmath63 is introduced .",
    "this gap of the level repulsion is nothing but the lz gap .",
    "let us study the effect of finite @xmath63 around the degenerate point @xmath208 . applying the perturbation theory to the degenerate states @xmath206 and @xmath207 , the first - order perturbation energy @xmath209 from @xmath205",
    "is given as a solution of the following eigenvalue problem : @xmath210    in the case of @xmath211 and @xmath212 , @xmath213 is reduced to @xmath214 and @xmath205 is equal to the original staggered dm interaction , namely , @xmath215 with @xmath216 .",
    "the dm interaction @xmath217 commutes with @xmath218 and it does not change the value of @xmath218 .",
    "this leads to @xmath219 therefore , the off - diagonal term of eq .",
    "( [ eq : eigenperturb ] ) is zero and only the diagonal matrix elements @xmath220 can be finite when @xmath212 .",
    "however , if we suitably tune the external field ( frequency ) from @xmath221 to @xmath222 ( @xmath223 ) , we can remove the diagonal elements .",
    "namely , the level crossing survives even after introducing the @xmath63 term and off - diagonal elements are necessary to generate a lz gap .",
    "next , we add a finite transverse field @xmath18 at the new level crossing point @xmath224 . in this case",
    ", @xmath225 appears in the perturbation part @xmath205 .",

    "( [ eq : eigenperturb2 ] ) are proportional to @xmath234 .",
    "therefore , the @xmath63-induced lz gap @xmath235 is proportional to @xmath173 up to the leading order of @xmath18 and @xmath63 . even if we consider the lz gap from the standpoint of @xmath20 instead of @xmath196 , the @xmath63-induced gap @xmath87 in the space of @xmath214 is also proportional to @xmath173 because @xmath236 can be approximately equal to @xmath214 .",
