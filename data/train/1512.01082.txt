    "in this report , we discuss pion pole effects @xcite and transversity twist-3 contributions from the @xmath0 , @xmath1 gpds @xcite which are important in explanation of spin effects in the light meson production at moderate @xmath4 .",
    "our model of hard electroproduction of light mesons @xcite is based on the handbag factorization at high photon virtuality @xmath4 of the process amplitude into the hard meson electroproduction off partons , and gpds @xcite .",
    "the amplitudes of the pseudoscalar meson ( pm ) leptoproduction in the leading twist approximation are sensitive to gpds @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "these contributions were found to be not sufficient to describe spin effects in the pm production at sufficiently low @xmath4 @xcite . to be consistent with experiment",
    ", one needs the essential contributions from the transversity gpds @xmath0 , @xmath1 which go together with a twist-3 pion wave function @xcite .",
    "we discuss the pion pole and transversity effects in the pm leptoproduction at hermes and clas energies in section 2 .",
    "our results are in good agreement with experimental data .    the hermes data on sdmes for the @xmath2 production indicated essential contributions from unnatural parity exchanges @xcite .",
    "it was found that the pion pole ( pp ) contribution @xcite is significant in explanation of the large unnatural - parity effects observed by hermes . the pp contribution to",
    "the @xmath3 production is much smaller with respect to the @xmath2 case .",
    "we discuss the pp effects in @xmath2 and @xmath7 production in section 3 .",
    "within the handbag approach the leading contributions to the meson production amplitude off proton at sufficiently high photon virtuality @xmath4 can be described in factorized form @xcite as a convolution of a hard meson subprocess amplitude off partons with the same helicities @xmath8 and gpds as @xmath9 here @xmath10 is a flavor factor and @xmath11 and @xmath12 are helicities of the photon and produced meson .",
    "gpds contain information on the hadron structure . with the help of sum rules",
    "they are connected with hadron form factors , and information on the parton angular momenta can be extracted . in the forward limit @xmath13 and zero skewness @xmath14 gpds",
    "are equivalent to ordinary parton distribution functions ( pdfs ) .",
    "we estimate gpds by using the double distribution representation @xcite which connects gpds with pdfs .",
    "the pdfs parameterizations are obtained , e.g , from the analysis @xcite , or from the nucleon form factor study @xcite .",
    "the handbag approach was successfully applied to light meson leptoproduction @xcite .",
    "the cross sections and spin observables of light vector meson ( vm ) leptoproduction were found to be in good agreement with hermes , compass and hera data .",
    "the leading twist contributions are not sufficient to describe the experimental results on pm electroproduction at low @xmath4 .",
    "this can be found from analysis of @xmath15 asymmetry which in the leading twist handbag approximation is small .",
    "however , hermes found @xcite that this asymmetry is large , about 0.5 .",
    "this effect can be explained by the large contributions to the @xmath15 asymmetry from the amplitude @xmath16 . at low @xmath4",
    "the amplitudes @xmath17 are determined by the transversity gpds @xmath0 and @xmath1 contributions which have the twist-3 nature . within the handbag approach the transversity gpds",
    "are accompanied by a twist-3 meson wave function in the hard subprocess amplitude @xmath18 @xcite which is the same for both the @xmath19 amplitudes @xmath20    the @xmath0 gpds in the forward limit and @xmath14 are equal to transversity pdfs @xmath21 and are parameterized by using the model @xcite . the double distribution is used to calculate gpds as before . for details , see @xcite .",
    "information on @xmath1 is obtained now only from the lattice qcd @xcite .",
    "the lower moments of @xmath22 and @xmath23 were found to be quite large , have the same sign and a similar size . at the same time",
    "@xmath24 and @xmath25 gpds have a different sign .",
    "these properties of gpds provide an essential compensation of the @xmath1 contribution in the @xmath26 amplitude , but @xmath0 effects are not small there . for the @xmath27 production",
    "we have large @xmath1 contributions and smaller @xmath0 effects .",
    "we present here our results on the pm leptoproduction based on the handbag approach . in calculation , we use the leading contributions together with the transversity effects ( [ ht ] ) which are essential at low @xmath4 .    in fig.1 , we show our results for the @xmath26 production which are in agreement with hermes @xcite .",
    "the dashed line indicates the model results for @xmath28 .",
    "it is closed to the pp contribution to the @xmath26 cross section .",
    "so in this channel the pp effects are very essential .",
    "the pion induced drell - yan process @xmath29 which is a time - like analog of @xmath26 leptoproduction was investigated in @xcite .",
    "it was found that the pion pole gives the predominant contribution in the longitudinal cross section of this process .",
    "other effects are rather small in @xmath30 .    in fig .",
    "2 , we present the model results for the @xmath27 production cross section @xcite . here",
    "the pp contribution is absent but transversity effects are essential . at small momentum transfer",
    "the @xmath0 contribution is visible and provides a nonzero cross section . at @xmath31",
    "the @xmath1 contribution becomes predominant and gives a maximum in the cross section .",
    "a similar contribution from @xmath1 is observed in the interference cross section @xmath32 .",
    "note that the @xmath1 effects in the unseparated cross section @xmath33 which is saturated by @xmath34 is strongly correlated with similar effects in @xmath32 .",
    "the fact that we describe well both the unseparated @xmath33 and @xmath32 cross sections can indicate that transversity effects were probably observed in clas @xcite .",

    "in most reactions the unnatural parity ( up ) contributions are small with respect to the natural ones .",
    "the hermes data on the spin density matrix elements ( sdmes ) for the @xmath2 production indicate the strong contributions from up effects @xcite .",
    "it was found that the ratio of the unnatural and natural parity cross section , which was expected to be small , is larger than unity .",
    "this can be caused by the large pion pole contribution to this process .",

    "these amplitudes have the up nature and are controlled by the @xmath40 transition form factor .",
    "the transition form factor @xmath41 can be determined from the vm radiative decay @xmath42 we find @xmath43 this means that @xmath44 is about 3 times larger with respect to @xmath45 and we should observe large pp effects in @xmath2 and small in @xmath7 production .",
    "the @xmath4 dependence of @xmath46 was extracted @xcite from the hermes data @xcite on the ratio of the unnatural to the natural parity cross section @xmath47 at @xmath48 .",
    "we will discuss our results on pp effects in the @xmath2 and @xmath7 production @xcite and give a comparison with hermes data @xcite . in calculations we use gpds from our analysis of hard meson leptoproduction .",
    "the natural and unnatural parity asymmetry @xmath49 is determined as follows : @xmath50 if the up contribution is small , we find @xmath51 .",
