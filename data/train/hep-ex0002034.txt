    "we report on the results of measurements of fermion - pair production above the z pole , based on data collected using the l3 detector at lep in 1997 and 1998 at centre - of - mass  energies @xmath0 and @xmath1 , respectively .",
    "data corresponding to integrated luminosities of 55.5  and 176.2  were collected , leading to much improved statistics compared to our previous publications  @xcite based on data from 1995 and 1996 .",
    "in addition , in 1997 , small amounts of data , 3.4  and 3.6  , were collected at the same centre - of - mass  energies as in 1995 , 130.0  and 136.1  , respectively .",
    "the measurements made on these data samples are combined with those resulting from a re - analysis of the previous data , superseding the results obtained in reference  @xcite .    in this article",
    "we report on measurements of the fermion pair production reactions : @xmath2 in these reactions , the @xmath3 indicates the possible presence of additional photons or low invariant - mass fermion pairs .    for a substantial fraction of the events initial - state radiation , isr , lowers the initial centre - of - mass  energy to an _ effective _ centre - of - mass  energy of the annihilation process , @xmath4 .",
    "when @xmath4  is close to the z mass , , the events are classified as radiative returns to the z. a cut on @xmath4  allows a separation between events at high effective centre - of - massenergies ( so - called _ high - energy _ events ) , and radiative returns to the z. cross sections are measured for all processes and forward - backward asymmetries are measured for the lepton channels and are compared to predictions of the standard model  @xcite , both for the high - energy sample and for a larger , _ inclusive _ sample including also the radiative returns to the z. kinematic cuts have been changed with respect to our previous publication  @xcite .",
    "the corresponding results of the cross section and forward - backward asymmetry measurements have been included , with corrections for these changes applied .",
    "similar studies on the data taken at centre - of - mass energies between 182.7  and 188.7  have been published by other lep collaborations  @xcite .",
    "the data were collected using the l3 detector described in references  @xcite . for the @xmath5-channel processes , the inclusive event sample is defined by requiring @xmath6 for hadronic events and @xmath7 for lepton - pair events , to reduce uncertainties on radiative corrections in extrapolating to low @xmath4  values .",
    "the high - energy sample is defined by requiring @xmath8 .    using the sum of all isr photon or pair energies , @xmath9 , and momentum vectors , @xmath10 , the @xmath11 value is given by : @xmath12    for most of the events initial - state radiation is along the beam pipe and",
    "is not detected . in this case a single photon is assumed to be emitted along the beam axis ; its energy is determined from the event kinematics .",
    "the @xmath4  value is estimated using equation  [ eq : spri ] .",
    "the effect of multiple photon and final - state radiation on the @xmath4  calculation has been studied using monte carlo programs and is corrected for .",
    "the treatment of photons observed in the detector is addressed in the sections describing the individual analyses .",
    "mis - reconstruction of the effective centre - of - mass  energy induces a migration of events between the kinematic regions allowed and excluded by the cut on @xmath4 .",
    "this is taken into account in the efficiency determination and as an additional background , denominated as isr contamination .",
    "bhabha scattering at high energies is dominated by @xmath13-channel photon exchange , and hence a cut on @xmath11 is less natural . instead",
    ", a cut is applied on the acollinearity angle , @xmath14 , of the final - state @xmath15 and @xmath16 . in this case , the inclusive and high - energy samples are defined by requiring @xmath17 and @xmath18 , respectively .",
    "selection efficiencies and backgrounds are determined by monte carlo simulations for each centre - of - mass energy using the following event generators : bhlumi  @xcite ( small - angle bhabha scattering ) ; pythia  @xcite ( @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 ) ; koralz  @xcite ( @xmath23 , @xmath24 ) ; bhagene  @xcite and bhwide  @xcite ( large - angle bhabha scattering ) ; teegg  @xcite ( @xmath25 ) ; ggg  @xcite ( @xmath26 ) ; phojet  @xcite ( hadronic two - photon collisions ) ; diag36  @xcite ( @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 ) ; fermisv  @xcite ( @xmath30 ) ; koralw  @xcite ( @xmath31 ) ; and excalibur  @xcite ( @xmath32 , @xmath33 ) .",
    "the measurements are compared to the predictions of the standard model  as calculated using the zfitter  @xcite and topaz0  @xcite programs with the following parameters  @xcite : @xmath34  , @xmath35 , @xmath36  , @xmath37 , and @xmath38  .",
    "the theoretical uncertainties on the standard model  predictions are estimated to be below 1%  @xcite except for the predictions for large angle bhabha scattering which have an uncertainty of 2%  @xcite .      in the presence of interference between",
    "initial- and final - state radiative corrections , the effective centre - of - mass  energy , in contrast to the acollinearity angle , is not well - defined . moreover , for the @xmath5-channel processes , unlike for bhabha scattering , these contributions are not included in the monte carlo samples used to estimate efficiencies .",
    "their effect is expected to be largest for the high - energy @xmath39  and  samples , affecting cross sections by up to 2% and forward - backward asymmetries by up to 0.02 .",
    "the following approach is used in the analysis of the @xmath5-channel processes .",
    "cross sections are first determined disregarding this effect .",
    "this allows the use of existing monte carlo programs without modifications .",
    "corrections are subsequently applied using the standard model  predictions for the interference contributions , folded with the selection efficiency , @xmath40 , as a function of the fermion - pair invariant mass , @xmath41 , and the scattering angle of the anti - fermion , @xmath42 .",
    "this leads to an additive correction : @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the differential interference contribution to the cross section as calculated using the zfitter program .",
    "the corrections applied range between 0.1% for the hadronic cross section and 1.3% for the leptonic cross sections .",
    "the forward - backward asymmetries for the high - energy samples are obtained as the result of an unbinned maximum - likelihood fit to the polar angular distribution in the born approximation , to which is added a term representing the differential interference cross section : @xmath45 for the inclusive sample , initial - state radiation distorts the angular distribution , such that the born approximation in equation  [ eq : cost - afbfit ] is not appropriate .",
    "instead , the forward - backward asymmetry is obtained directly from the differential cross section and extrapolated to the full solid angle using the zfitter program .",
    "the differential cross section is corrected analogously to equation  [ eq : ifsr - cross ] .",
    "the correction is largest for the asymmetry of the high - energy samples , ranging between 0.004 and 0.010 .      besides the emission of isr photons , also the emission of initial - state pairs can lower the effective centre - of - mass energy of the scattering process",
    "this gives rise to a non - negligible contribution to the inclusive cross section ( approximately 1.5% for all @xmath5-channels as estimated using the zfitter program ) when radiative returns to the z are included in the signal definition . to allow for a proper comparison between experimental measurements and theoretical predictions , these radiative corrections",
    "are included in the fermion - pair signal definition .    to calculate the effect of this signal contribution on the overall efficiency , and to estimate the background contributions leading to the same four - fermion final states",
    ", events are generated using the diag36 program .",
    "as this program includes only photon exchange , the events are reweighted to include the effects of z exchange using the matrix element calculation of the fermisv program .",
    "the selection efficiencies are obtained by combining those estimated from the separate monte carlo samples regarded as signal , weighted with their respective cross sections as estimated using the zfitter program .",
    "as these monte carlo programs do not yield a correct description of low - mass hadronic pairs , the efficiency for events with hadronic pairs is taken to be that for the events with lepton pairs .",
    "a 20% uncertainty is assigned to this efficiency , resulting in an uncertainty less than 0.2% on the overall efficiency .    because of the large number of diagrams involved , this approach is less straightforward in the case of bhabha scattering .",
    "since the relative pair correction is estimated  @xcite to be significantly smaller than for the @xmath5-channel processes , its effect on the selection efficiency is neglected and no correction is applied .",
    "the luminosity is measured using small - angle bhabha scattering  @xcite .",
    "a tight fiducial volume cut , @xmath46 and @xmath47 , @xmath48 , is imposed on the coordinates of the highest - energy cluster on one side .",
    "the highest - energy cluster on the opposite side should be contained in a looser fiducial volume , @xmath49 and @xmath50 , @xmath51 .",
    "this method reduces the theoretical uncertainty .",
    "the experimental systematic uncertainties originate from the event selection criteria , 0.10% , and from the detector geometry , 0.05% .",
    "the monte carlo statistics result in an uncertainty of 0.07% , yielding a total experimental systematic uncertainty of 0.13% .",
    "in addition , a theoretical uncertainty of 0.12%  @xcite is assigned to the bhlumi generator , resulting in a total uncertainty of 0.18% .",

    "the longitudinal energy imbalance must satisfy @xmath54 .",
