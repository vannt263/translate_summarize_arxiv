    "regulus ( @xmath21 leo , hr 3982 , hd 87901 ) is a nearby ( @xmath22 pc @xcite ) intermediate mass star of spectral class b @xcite and has the peculiarity of being animated by a very fast rotation .",
    "indeed , combined interferometric and spectroscopic studies @xcite have shown that its equatorial radius @xmath1 is @xmath2 larger than the polar one @xmath3 , and its rotation period is 15.9 hr , which corresponds to an equatorial rotation speed that is @xmath23 of the critical breakup velocity . other fast spinning stars whose oblateness has been interferometrically measured are altair ( @xmath21 aquil , hd 187642 @xcite ) and achernar ( @xmath21 eri , hd 10144 @xcite ) .    in principle",
    ", a companion orbiting not too far from such highly deformed stars would experience relevant orbital effects induced by the primary s oblateness which could be used to dynamically put constraints either on such an important stellar physical parameter or on the orbital / physical parameters of the system .",
    "in fact , the be star achernar recently turned out to be orbited by a faint companion @xcite which should be a a1v - a3v star @xcite , but since its orbital period should amount to about 15 yr it has not yet been possible to obtain its orbital parameters .",
    "no companions are known for altair .",
    "the situation is more favorable for regulus since spectroscopic observations over the last few years have demonstrated that it has a close leo b at a separation of @xmath24 which is itself a binary @xcite , but it has a far too great separation to have ever interacted directly with regulus . ]",
    "companion in a circular orbit described in 40.11 d @xcite .",
    "in this paper we will investigate the possibility of detecting some dynamical orbital effects induced by the oblateness of regulus on its companion and will use them to put some constraints on the mass of the secondary .",
    "the relevant physical and orbital parameters of the regulus binary system are in table [ tavola ] .    .",
    "relevant parameters of the single - line spectroscopic binary system of regulus .",
    "@xmath15 is the primary s mass @xcite , @xmath5 is the orbital period @xcite , @xmath14 is the velocity semiamplitude @xcite , @xmath1 and @xmath3 are the equatorial and polar radii @xcite ; the eccentricity @xmath25 has been assumed equal to zero @xcite .",

    "the estimates of stellar radii and mass are almost independent of the choice of @xmath26 @xcite .    given that the observable quantity at our disposal is the orbital period , we will start by investigating the impact of the primary s oblateness on it . by assuming axial symmetry about the @xmath27 axis and reflection symmetry about the equator assumed as reference @xmath28 plane",
    ", the external gravitational potential @xmath29 can be written as @xciteu= u_0+u_,@xmath30 in which @xmath31 is the colatitude angle and @xmath32 ; indeed , the quadrupole mass moment is proportional to the square of the stellar angular rotation frequency , so that we will neglect the oblateness @xmath33 , if any , of the secondary with respect to that of regulus . the relative acceleration @xmath34 due to the gravitational potential of is , in spherical coordinates @xmath35",
    "which yields @xmath36    we will now make the simplifying assumption that the orbital angular momentum and the spin of regulus are aligned @xcite , thus , @xmath37 and only the equation for the radial acceleration survives in as a_r = a_0+a_q , with @xmath38 following straightforwardly a standard perturbative approach @xcite is it possible to use to obtain p = p^kep + p^q , with p^kep = 2=(1+),and p^q = = .we have used = m+m = m(1 + ) ,  = , and a = ( 1+)a_m=(),where @xmath39 is the relative semimajor axis and @xmath40 is the barycentric semimajor axis of the motion of the primary .",
    "since @xcite q = i_x - i_zm(r_p^2 - r_e^2)=-2.40.510 ^ 49  kg  m^2 , where @xmath41 and @xmath42 are the equatorial and polar moments of inertia , respectively , allows us to investigate if the contribution of the primary s oblateness to the orbital period is large enough to be detected , in principle , given the present - day level of accuracy in determining @xmath5 .",
    "figure [ regulus_pq ] and table [ tavola ] show that this is just the case . here and in the following",
    "we will treat @xmath43 as an unknown quantity .     to the keplerian period for @xmath44m@xmath45 , @xmath46 kg m@xmath47 and different values of the inclination @xmath26 close to the edge - on configuration .",
    "it is larger than the accuracy in the determined orbital period @xmath10 d. ]    this is an important result because it opens , in principle , the possibility of inferring or constraining @xmath4 from the dynamics of the binary system .",
    "moreover , it is the first time that such an opportunity occurs for an extrasolar binary system ; indeed , we will show that other competing dynamical effects , which in other systems may overcome those due to @xmath4 , in this case are negligible .    to do that it would be necessary compute the keplerian orbital period @xmath8 and subtract it from the measured one @xmath5 ; to this aim ,",
    "let us note that the parameters entering have been determined independently of the third kepler law itself , so that it does make sense to compare to the phenomenologically determined orbital period @xmath5 .",
    "however , it is not sufficient that @xmath48 ; is the uncertainty @xmath49 due to the errors in the system s parameters smaller than @xmath7 as well ?",
    "unfortunately , the answer is still negative by about two orders of magnitude , as shown by figure [ regulus_dp ] .     in the keplerian period due to the errors in the system s parameters for @xmath44m@xmath45 and different values of the inclination @xmath26 close to the edge - on configuration . it is larger than @xmath7 by about two orders of magnitude . ]",
    "it may be interesting to see what is the impact of each system s parameter in determining @xmath11 in order to have some hints about the future possibilities and also to drive researches towards the improvement of the parameters which turn out to be the most effective in corrupting the measurement of @xmath7 .",
    "figure [ regulus_dp ] shows that the most relevant sources of errors are @xmath14 and @xmath15 . for details concerning how @xmath14 and @xmath15 and their errors",
    "have been determined see @xcite and references therein , and @xcite , respectively .     for @xmath44m@xmath45 and @xmath16 deg .",
    "]    in principle , there is also a general relativistic contribution to the orbital period which should be taken into account .",
    "it is @xcite p^rel=(1+).however , it can be safely neglected because it is smaller than @xmath13 by four orders of magnitude , being of the order of @xmath50 d. finally , let us note that , in view of the large separation between the two stars no tidal effects come into play",
    ". this can be seen by comparing the tidal acceleration a_tidal==2gm^4 r_e^3,to the centrifugal acceleration",
    "a_cen= ^2 r_e , where @xmath51 is the rotational frequency of regulus ; it turns out that @xmath52 being of the order of @xmath53 .",
    "in this section we will show how useful constraints on the mass @xmath54 of the regulus companion can be inferred by looking for deviations from the third kepler law in terms of @xmath4 ; indeed , in the previous section we showed that no other effects are relevant in the orbital dynamics of such a binary system .",
    "let us start by evaluating the discrepancy @xmath55 between the measured orbital period @xmath5 and the computed keplerian one @xmath8 as a function of @xmath43 for different values of the inclination close to the edge - on configuration : figure [ regulus_p ] shows that , for @xmath16 deg , @xmath56 is significant at @xmath57 level outside the range @xmath58 ; for @xmath59 deg it occurs outside @xmath60 .     of the discrepancy @xmath61 between the measured orbital period @xmath5 and the keplerian one @xmath8 to its uncertainty as a function of @xmath6 for @xmath44m@xmath45 and different values of the inclination @xmath26 close to the edge - on configuration .",
    "it is significant at @xmath57 level outside the range @xmath58 ( @xmath16 deg ) . ]",
    "note that such bounds are conservative because the uncertainty in @xmath56 has been evaluated as @xmath62 . for",
    "the sake of simplicity , let us consider the case @xmath16 deg and see if statistically significant deviations from the third kepler law for @xmath63 , interpreted as due to @xmath4 , are physically meaningful .     as a function of @xmath6 for @xmath44m@xmath45 and @xmath16 deg .",
    "for @xmath17 @xmath4 becomes positive , i.e. the star would be prolate , contrary to the observational evidence . for @xmath18 @xmath4",
    "is negative , but one - two orders of magnitude larger than @xmath64 . ]",
    "figure [ regulus_q ] clearly shows that the answer is negative : indeed , for @xmath65 the quadrupole mass moment @xmath4 of the primary would become positive , i.e. the star would be prolate , which is contradicted by the observations .",
    "thus , we can conclude that the faint companion of regulus can not have a mass larger than about 0.30 m@xmath45 , contrary to what can be found in @xcite .",
    "an inspection of figure [ regulus_q ] tell us that for @xmath66 , i.e. @xmath67m@xmath45 , @xmath4 would be a definite negative quantity , in according with the observations .",
    "however , it must be noted that , in this case , @xmath68 would be one - two orders of magnitude larger than the estimate of .",
    "it would be difficult to consider such a large discrepancy as acceptable .",
    "thus , we provisionally consider @xmath18 not likely .",
    "the simplest solution consists in assuming for @xmath43 the range which still makes @xmath56 compatible with zero considering also that the value of for @xmath4 would not be excluded by such values of @xmath9 , as shown by figure [ regulus_q ] .",
    "in this paper we investigated the impact of the huge quadrupole mass moment @xmath4 of regulus on the orbital period of its faint companion .",
    "it turns out that , for a reasonable estimate of its value , @xmath4 induces a correction to the keplerian period which could , in principle , be measured because it is larger than the error in phenomenologically measuring the orbital period @xmath5 .",
    "however , according to the present - day level of knowledge of the system s parameters , the uncertainty in the keplerian period is larger than the correction due to @xmath4 by about two orders of magnitude ; the most important sources of errors are the velocity semiamplitude @xmath14 and the mass @xmath15 of regulus .",
    "an analysis of deviations from the third kepler law as due to @xmath4 for the edge - on orbital configuration and @xmath69m@xmath45 has shown that values of the ratio @xmath9 of the secondary s mass to the primary s one larger than about 0.096 are to be ruled out because they would yield a positive quadrupole mass moment for regulus , i.e. it would be prolate , contrary to the observations . on the other hand , for @xmath18 @xmath4 would be negative , but with an unlikely large value .",
    "further observational campaigns with different techniques would be of great significance in the attempt of reducing the overall uncertainty in the system s parameters down to the level required for detecting the effect of the shape of regulus ."
