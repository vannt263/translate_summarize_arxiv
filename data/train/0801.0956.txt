    "ultrarelativistic plasmas , in which the thermal energy of the particles is much larger than their rest mass energy , were discussed first in the fifties in the context of astrophysics .",
    "they occur in the early universe as well as stellar and galactic high - energy processes ( zeldovich and novikov , 1971 ; zeldovich and novikov , 1983 ; raffelt , 1996 ) .",
    "for example , ultrarelativistic electron - positron plasmas ( eep ) can be created either by high temperatures in supernovae explosions ( see e.g. hardy and thoma ( 2001 ) ) or strong magnetic fields in so - called magnetars ( beskin _ et al .",
    "_ , 1993 ) .",
    "the theoretical description of ultrarelativistic plasmas is based on transport theory ( silin , 1960 ) or thermal field theory ( tsytovich , 1961 ) .",
    "the latter is an extension of quantum field theory , such as qed or qcd , in vacuum to finite temperature ( or chemical potential ) describing high - energy particle interactions in matter . for this purpose ,",
    "two different approaches were developed , the imaginary time formalism ( matsubara , 1955 ; kapusta , 1989 ) and the real time formalism ( landsmann and van weert , 1987 ) .    in the eighties a new type of ultrarelativistic plasmas became of interest , the quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) ( mller , 1985 ) .",
    "it corresponds to a new state of matter of deconfined quarks and gluons at extremely high temperatures above @xmath0 mev .",
    "the early universe should have been in this state for the first few microseconds after the big bang .",
    "furthermore , the qgp is expected to be created in relativistic heavy - ion collisions , in particular within the accelerator experiment rhic ( gyulassy and mclerran , 2005 ) .",
    "there a hot and dense fireball ( `` little bang '' ) of the size of an atomic nucleus is produced , which could be in the qgp phase for less than @xmath1 s. therefore the qgp in those experiments can not be observed directly but its discovery relies on the comparison of theoretically predicted signatures with experimental data ( `` circumstantial evidence '' ) . for understanding the properties of the qgp and for calculating signatures for its formation , qcd at finite temperature has been applied .",
    "besides a non - perturbative method based on a numerical solution of the qcd equations ( lattice qcd ) , perturbation theory at finite temperature has been used widely ( thoma , 1995a ; le bellac , 1996 ) .",
    "lattice qcd allows only the calculation of static quantities , and hence not of most of the proposed signatures following from particle production .",
    "perturbative qcd , on the other hand , has been used for computing static as well as dynamic quantities . however , its predictions are limited by the fact that the qgp is a strongly - coupled plasma at temperatures achievable in the experiments .",
    "( at extremely high temperatures far above the transition temperature perturbative qcd should be reliable due to asymptotic freedom of qcd . ) nonetheless , a wide variety of properties and quantities of the qgp have been considered in this way .",
    "it started with the calculation of self - energies and dispersion relations in the high - temperature limit ( klimov , 1982 ; weldon , 1982a ; weldon , 1982b ) .",
    "in the high - temperature limit the results differ from the qed results only by trivial factors containing the qcd degrees of freedom ( color , flavor ) .",
    "in addition , it can be shown that the gluon self - energy or polarization tensor , which is directly related to the dielectric function ( see e.g. elze and heinz ( 1989 ) ) , can be derived also within the transport ( vlasov ) approach ( silin , 1960 ) , since the high - temperature limit corresponds to the classical limit .",
    "other quantities , however , such as damping or production rates and transport coefficients , require a quantum field theoretic treatment .",
    "in particular , a resummation of certain diagrams , the hard thermal loops ( htl ) , is needed for a consistent description , i.e. to obtain gauge invariant , infrared finite ( or improved ) results complete to leading order in the coupling constant ( braaten and pisarski , 1990 ) .",
    "details about quantum field theoretic methods and their application to the physics of the qgp can be found in the review article by thoma ( 1995a ) .",
    "recently a third possibility to study ultrarelativistic plasmas has been suggested : in extremely strong laser fields the creation of an ultrarelativistic epp with temperatures around 10 mev could be realized soon ( liang _ et al .",
    "_ , 1998 ) .",
    "for example two opposite , circular polarized laser pulses with a duration of 330 fs and an intensity of @xmath2 w/@xmath3 could hit a thin gold foil . in this way the target electrons can be heated up to about 10 mev producing an ultrarelativistic epp by pair creation",
    ". the positron density could be about @xmath4 @xmath5 ( shen and meyer - ter - vehn , 2001 ) .",
    "this will allow for the first time to study an ultrarelativistic epp in the laboratory .",
    "therefore predictions of the physical properties of such a system are needed .",
    "the interaction of relativistic electrons and positrons is described by qed . in the presence of a thermal plasma background ( heat bath ) qed at finite temperature",
    "has to be considered . as discussed above , perturbative methods based on the imaginary ( matsubara ) or real time formalism",
    "have been developed and applied to the physics of a qgp . here",
    "we will transfer the methods and results for properties of a qgp to the case of an epp , where a perturbative treatment is more reliable than in the case of a strongly coupled qgp .",
    "some applications of thermal field theory to astrophysical plasmas have been discussed before ( see e.g. thoma ( 2002 ) and references therein and altherr and kraemmer ( 1992 ) ) .    an important difference to non - relativistic ion - electron plasmas ( lifshitz and pitaevskii , 1981 ) are the relevant scales . in the non - relativistic case case",
    "they are given by the masses of the plasma particles and the temperature @xmath6 .",
    "for example , the electron plasma frequency reads @xmath7 and the debye screening length due to the electrons in the plasma @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the electron number density , @xmath10 the temperature of the electron component , and @xmath11 the electron mass .    in an ultrarelativistic plasma with @xmath12",
    "the masses can be neglected and the important scales are the temperature @xmath6 , called the hard scale , and the soft scale @xmath13 , which determines the collective phenomena as we will see below . here",
    "we use natural units , i.e. @xmath14 , as usual in quantum field theory . in these units",
    "@xmath15 corresponding to a fine structure constant @xmath16 . for converting to si - units we use @xmath17 .    in the next section",
    "we will discuss the equation of state of an equilibrated ultrarelativistic epp .",
    "then collective phenomena will be considered . afterwards",
    "transport properties and particle production will be discussed .",
    "finally we will describe properties of an epp which is not in chemical equilibrium as in the case of laser induced plasmas .",
    "we will not consider here the formation process and equilibration of an epp .",
    "many results presented here can be found in the literature for the case of a qgp ( thoma , 1995a ) differing only by numerical factors , e.g. number of degrees of freedom .",
    "the purpose of this colloquium is to summarize these results and to extend them to laser induced epps as a reference for future experiments . as an example we consider a temperature of 10 mev as it can be typically realized in laser produced and supernovae epps .",
    "laser produced qed plasmas have also been discussed recently in two review articles ( mourou _ et al .",
    "_ , 2006 ; marklund and shukla , 2006 ) with emphasis on the production mechanism and non - linear effects . here",
    ", however , we want to focus on the properties of an equilibrated epp as they can be calculated from perturbative qed .",
    "such an epp in thermal and chemical equlibrium might be the outcome of future laser experiments if the intensity can be increased further on .",
    "as an example , we have chosen the predictions of shen and meyer - ter - vehn ( 2001 ) based on a numerical simulation ( pic ) and cross sections for electron - positron productions , in which two opposite laser beams are focussed on a thin gold foil leading to a chemically non - equiliibrated plasma ( see section vi ) . however",
    ", this interesting proposal still waits for its experimental confirmation .",
    "other production mechanisms , based on the schwinger pair production effect in strong fields ( schwinger , 1951 ) , have shown that pair production can be efficient already far below the schwinger critical field strength , requiring laser intensities of @xmath18 w/@xmath3 , in the case of time dependent and inhomogeneous fields , e.g. two oppositely directed pulsed laser beams in vacuum ( see e.g. avetissian _",

    "furthermore the pair production in an x - ray free electron laser ( xfel ) has been discussed ( ringwald , 2001 ; alkofer _ et al .",
    "_ , 2001 ; roberts _ et al .",
    "_ , 2002 ) .",
    "qed plasmas in strong magnetic fields have been considered by danielsson and grasso ( 1995 ) and more general in strong electromagnetic fields by morozov _",
    "qed plasmas have also been studied in great detail in the book by melrose ( 2008 ) .",
    "in this section we will consider the equation of state of an epp under the following assumptions :    \\1 .",
    "ultrarelativistic epp , i.e. @xmath12 ,    \\2 .",
    "thermal and chemical equilibrium ,    \\3 .",
    "equal electron and positron density , i.e. vanishing chemical potential ,    \\4 .",
    "ideal gas , i.e. no interactions in plasma ,    \\5 . infinitely extended ,",
    "homogeneous , and isotropic epp .",
    "we will relax some of these assumptions in the following sections . according to these assumptions",
    "the distribution function of the electrons and positrons is given by the fermi - dirac distribution @xmath19 and of the photons by the bose - einstein distribution @xmath20 where the momentum @xmath21 is identical to the energy @xmath22 of the particles in the ultrarelativistic case .",
    "it should be noted that the photons are in equilibrium with electrons and positrons under the above assumptions , i.e. the system is actually an electron - positron - photon gas .",
    "the particle and energy density can be calculated by integrating over the distribution functions . in the case of a qgp",
    "the results can be found in mller ( 1985 ) .",
    "the particle number density of the electrons and positrons follows from integrating over the fermi - dirac distribution as @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the number of degrees of freedom corresponding to the electrons and positrons in the two spin states .",
    "assuming a temperature of @xmath25 mev , we find @xmath26 mev@xmath27 m@xmath28 .",
    "the photon density follows accordingly by integrating over the bose - einstein distribution with @xmath29 degrees of freedom corresponding to the two polarization states as @xmath30 .",
    "the energy density of the electron - positron - photon gas is obtained from @xmath31 where the photons contribute 36 % to the energy density . here",
    "the boltzmann law , @xmath32 , holds also for the fermions because we neglected their masses .    for @xmath25",
    "mev we find @xmath33 j m@xmath28 . in a volume of @xmath34 m@xmath35 ( corresponding to the size of a neutron star ) the total thermal energy of the epp is @xmath36 j , which corresponds to about 10% of the entire energy ( without neutrinos ) released in a supernova type ii explosion . in a volume of 1 @xmath37m@xmath35",
    "there is still an energy of @xmath38 j contained .",
    "the coulomb coupling parameter of the epp , which is a measure for the non - ideal behavior of a plasma ( ichimaru , 1982 ) , is given by @xmath39 , where @xmath40 m is the interparticle distance .",
    "for @xmath25 mev we find @xmath41 which shows that the epp is a weakly coupled plasma in contrast to the qgp where @xmath42 ( thoma , 2005 ) .",
    "therefore the ideal gas results for the equation of state derived above are a good approximation .",
    "after all , interactions in the epp play an important role , for example , for the collective behavior of the plasma as discussed in the next section and for equilibration of the plasma .",
    "obviously , the interaction can be treated by perturbation theory .",
    "interactions between particles can be separated into two classes : individual collisions between the particles and long - range interactions of particles with the medium ( lifshitz and pitaevskii , 1981 ) .",
    "the latter ones lead to collective effects , which are characteristic for plasmas .",
    "the crucial quantity from which the collective phenomena are derived is the dielectric tensor relating the macroscopic electric field @xmath43 in the medium to the external field @xmath44 ( @xmath45 ) , i.e. in momentum space @xmath46 in the case of an isotropic medium it depends only on @xmath47 and has two independent components @xmath48    the dielectric tensor is closely related to the polarization tensor or photon self - energy by ( see e.g. elze and heinz ( 1989 ) )    @xmath49    where @xmath50 and @xmath51 are the longitudinal and transverse components of the polarization tensor , respectively .",
    "the lowest order diagram for the polarization tensor is shown in fig.1 . assuming the external momentum to be soft , i.e. @xmath52 and @xmath53 to be much smaller than @xmath6 and the internal loop momenta to be hard ( htl approximation ) an analytic result can be found using the real or imaginary time formalism ( klimov , 1982 ; weldon , 1982a ) @xmath54 , \\label{e10}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath55 is called the effective photon mass . for @xmath25",
    "mev we get @xmath56 mev .",
    "the hard thermal loop approximation , which is identical to the high - temperature limit , produces consistently the lowest order result in finite temperature qed ( braaten and pisarski , 1990 ) .",
    "the dielectric functions following from ( [ e9 ] ) and ( [ e10 ] ) can also be derived from the classical vlasov equation together with the maxwell equations ( silin , 1960 ) , since the high - temperature limit corresponds to the classical limit .",
    "the dispersion relations of collective plasma modes , i.e. propagation of electromagnetic waves in the plasma , can be found by using the maxwell equation , leading to ( see e.g. carrington _ et al . _",
    "( 2004 ) ) @xmath57 combining ( [ e9 ] ) , ( [ e10 ] ) , and ( [ e11 ] ) gives the dispersion relations @xmath58 of the transverse as well as longitudinal plasma waves as shown in fig.2 .",
    "the longitudinal branch , which does not exist in vacuum , is called plasmon as in the case of non - relativistic plasmas .",
    "the transverse branch does not play a role in non - relativistic plasmas but is equally important as the longitudinal one in relativistic plasmas .",
    "both branches start at the plasma frequency @xmath59 ( kajantie and kapusta , 1985 ) .",
    "consequently the collective plasma waves have soft momenta of the order @xmath13 . at high momenta @xmath60",
    "the transverse mode approaches the free dispersion @xmath61 , corresponding to a real photon in vacuum , whereas the longitudinal mode disappears , i.e. its spectral strength is exponentially suppressed ( pisarski , 1989 ) . for @xmath25 mev we find @xmath62 s@xmath63 .",
    "electromagnetic plasma waves in an ultrarelativistic epp have also been discussed by medvedev ( 1999 ) . for the plasma frequency the same dependence on the temperature and coupling",
    "constant was found ( see eq.(3 ) in medvedev ( 1999 ) ) if one uses the equilibrium number density for the photons proportional to @xmath64 ( see above ) there .",
    "however , the numerical pre - factor there is wrong and only one branch of plasma waves was discussed .    another important quantity which can be derived from the polarization or dielectric",
    "tensor is the debye screening length , entering the yukawa potential of a heavy , non - relativistic test charge in the epp .",
    "the debye screening length is given by the static limit of the longitudinal component of the polarization tensor @xmath65 ( kajantie and kapusta , 1985 ) , leading to @xmath66 , which is @xmath67 m for @xmath25 mev .",
    "finally from ( [ e10 ] ) we see that the polarization tensor and the dielectric function become imaginary for @xmath68 , i.e. below the light cone @xmath69 , corresponding to landau damping ( pisarski , 1988 ) .",
    "we also observe that the plasma waves calculated at lowest order perturbation theory are undamped since they are located at @xmath70 .",
    "this changes , however , at higher orders where the dispersion relation can intersect the light cone ( carrington _ et al . _ , 2004 ) .",
    "it is interesting to note that all these results are apart from some numerical color and flavor factors also valid for collective gluon modes in the qgp in the high - temperature limit ( thoma , 1995a ) .",
    "a complete new phenomenon that does not appear in non - relativistic plasmas is the existence of fermionic plasma waves because all fermion masses are much too large in the non - relativistic case .",
    "their dispersion relations follow from the pole of the electron propagator containing the electron self - energy . using again the hard thermal loop approximation the electron self - energy reads ( @xmath71 , @xmath72 ) ( klimov , 1982 ; weldon , 1982b ) @xmath73 with @xmath74\\ ; , \\nonumber \\\\",

    "the full electron propagator in the helicity representation is given by ( braaten _ et al .",
    "_ , 1990 ) @xmath78 where @xmath79\\ ; .",
    "\\label{e16}\\ ] ] again these results agree with the ones for quarks in the qgp apart from numerical pre - factors .",
    "the dispersion relations following from the pole of this propagator are shown in fig.3 . again",
    "two branches show up , one with a positive ratio of the helicity to chirality ( @xmath80 ) following from @xmath81 , the other one with a negative ratio ( @xmath82 ) following from @xmath83 , called plasmino ( braaten _ et al .",
    "_ , 1990 ) .",
    "the plasmino branch @xmath82 , which does not exist in vacuum , shows an interesting behavior , namely a minimum at @xmath84 .",
    "the same behavior of the quark dispersion in the qgp has been found . in this case",
    "sharp peaks in the dilepton production rate can appear due to the minimum in the plasmino branch , which leads to van hove singularities ( braaten _ et al .",
    "_ , 1990 ; peshier and thoma , 2000 ) . whether something similar could be observed in the epp , e.g. in the electron spectrum , is a very interesting question which should be investigated in detail .",
    "it could open the exciting possibility to observe a new collective plasma wave , the plasmino , experimentally in a laser induced epp .",
    "the collective quantities derived here perturbatively from the dielectric functions are linear phenomena .",
    "nonlinear collective effects in electron - positron plasmas , have been considered in a number of publications , e.g. soliton formation ( lontano _ et al .",
    "_ , 2001 ) , nonlinear alfvn waves ( zhao _ et al . _ , 1994 ) , nonlinear photon interactions ( tajima and taniuti , 1990 ) , plasma enhanced photon splitting ( brodin _ et al .",
    "_ , 2007 ) , and nonlinear self - modulation of radio pulses ( chian and kennel , 1983 ) .",
    "now we want to consider the interaction and properties of particles in the plasma with hard momenta , i.e. of the order of @xmath6 or larger .",
    "in particular we are interested in damping and transport rates , mean free paths , collision times , energy losses of these particles and other transport properties such as the shear viscosity of the epp .",
    "all these quantities have been calculated perturbatively in high - temperature qcd ( thoma , 1995a ) . as in the case of the collective phenomena",
    ", the results can be almost directly taken from the qcd calculations .",
    "it was shown by braaten and pisarski ( 1990 ) that a consistent treatment of gauge theories such as qed at finite temperature , i.e. for obtaining results that are gauge independent , infrared finite , and complete to leading order , require the use of an effective perturbation theory using resummed green functions based on the htl approximation ( htl resummation technique ) .",
    "the htl method relies on the assumption that one can distinguish between soft and hard momenta , i.e. @xmath85 .",
    "this is approximately fulfilled for qed , where @xmath15 , but not in qcd , where the corresponding coupling constant @xmath86 .",
    "the damping rate of an electron or positron in the epp is defined as the imaginary part of the dispersion relation @xmath87 .",
    "to lowest order it follows from the elastic scattering diagram of fig.4 . in the case of a hard electron or positron with momenta of the order of @xmath6 or higher it exhibits a quadratic infrared ( ir ) divergence which can be reduced to a logarithmic one using a htl resummed photon propagator",
    "this logarithmic singularity is expected to be cut - off by higher order contributions leading to ( thoma , 1995a ) @xmath88 within logarithmic accuracy , i.e. the constant under the logarithm is not determined .",
    "for @xmath25 mev we obtain @xmath89 kev , which is much smaller than @xmath90 mev , showing that the epp is not overdamped .    physically more important",
    "are the transport rates @xmath91 which are related to the mean free path and collision time of electrons and positrons in the epp .",
    "they differ from the damping rate in cutting off the long range interactions with small scattering angles @xmath92 by a factor @xmath93 under the integral defining the rate ( lifshitz and pitaevskii , 1981 ) .",
    "this leads to an improvement of the ir behavior ( logarithmic instead of quadratic singularity in perturbation theory ) and a finite result using the htl method .",
    "logarithmic divergent quantities can be treated consistently by splitting them into a soft part and a hard part , where the soft part is calculated using the htl resummation technique ( braaten and yuan , 1991 ) . for the transport rate",
    "we find to logarithmic accuracy by extending the qcd results in thoma ( 1994 ) to qed @xmath94 where the mandelstam variable @xmath95 is the square of the sum of the four momenta of the incoming particles in the scattering diagram of fig.4 . for deriving the above result we replaced in ( 15 ) of thoma ( 1994 ) @xmath96 by @xmath97 and @xmath98 by @xmath99 . for going beyond the logarithmic approximation , which is valid within about a factor of two , one has to calculate explicitly the hard contribution from the qed scattering diagrams as it was done by thoma ( 1994 ) for the qcd case . for thermal particles we replace @xmath100 by its thermal average @xmath101 ( thoma , 1994 ) , where @xmath102",
    "assuming again @xmath25 mev , we get @xmath103 kev .",
    "the mean free path @xmath104 and collision time @xmath105 of the plasma particles ( electrons and positrons ) are given by the inverse of the transport rate @xmath106 , leading to @xmath107 nm and @xmath108 s at @xmath25 mev .    in a non - relativistic plasma",
    "the shear viscosity can be estimated from elementary kinetic theory as ( reif , 1965 ) @xmath109 where the sum is performed over the various components of the system . in an relativistic plasma the coefficient 1/3",
    "should be replaced by 4/15 ( de groot _",
    "et al . _ , 1980 ) . using the mean free path following from ( [ e18 ] ) , the density of ( [ e5 ] ) , and the thermal momentum @xmath110 , the shear viscosity is given by ( within logarithmic accuracy ) @xmath111 at @xmath25 mev the shear viscosity coefficient is @xmath112 pa s.    another quantity of interest in a plasma is its stopping power or the energy loss of an energetic particle in the plasma .",
    "there are two contributions , namely the energy loss by collisions and the radiative one by bremsstrahlung . in a relativistic plasma",
    "the latter one becomes important .",
    "the relevance of these contributions in the qgp has been discussed controversially ( mustafa and thoma , 2005 ) . the collisional energy loss is given by the mean energy transfer divided by the mean free path leading to ( braaten and thoma , 1991 ) @xmath113 where @xmath114 is the particle velocity , @xmath115 the damping or interaction rate proportional to the plasma density and the collision cross section , and @xmath116 the energy transfer from the energetic particle to plasma particle in the collision . using for the collision cross section the lowest order diagrams in fig.5 , the collisional energy of a muon with mass @xmath117 in an epp has been calculated by braaten and thoma ( 1991 ) applying the htl resummation technique @xmath118 where @xmath119 is a slowly varying function of the muon velocity @xmath114 between 1.3 and 1.5 .",
    "the collisional energy loss of an electron with energy @xmath120 is approximately given by ( braaten and thoma , 1991 ) @xmath121 in braaten and thoma ( 1991 ) the factor 15.3 was replaced by 7.6 due to an numerical error which was corrected in thoma ( 1995a ) .",
    "this leads to an energy loss of 200 mev / nm for an electron or positron with an energy of @xmath122 mev at @xmath25 mev , showing that such an electron is stopped ( thermalized ) within a fraction of a nanometer .",
    "( note that the plasma density , proportional to @xmath64 , on which the energy loss depends via the mean free path is hidden in the temperature dependence of the energy loss . )",
    "recently it has been shown that this calculation can be improved by taking into account additional diagrams changing this result slightly ( peigne and peshier , 2008 ) .",
    "so far no calculations of the radiative energy loss in an epp have been performed to our knowledge .",
    "the damping rate of a photon in an epp follows from the diagram in fig.6 , where a htl resummed electron propagator has to be used in case of soft momenta of the exchanged electron ( positron ) .",
    "in contrast to the electron damping rate , the photon rate is infrared finite using the htl method due to the presence of an electron propagator in fig.6 instead of the photon propagator in fig.4 .",
    "hence there is no need to cut off the long range interaction introducing a transport cross section .",
    "the result for a photon with energy @xmath123 reads ( thoma , 1995b ) @xmath124 the mean free path and the collision time of photons in an epp are given by @xmath125 . for a thermal photon with the mean momentum @xmath126 at @xmath25 mev the mean free path @xmath127 nm and the collision time @xmath128 s follow .",
    "actually the damping rate given in ( [ e22 ] ) is a lower limit as higher order effects will enlarge it .",
    "as a matter of fact , the photon production rate in a qgp , which is the inverse process of the damping rate ( thoma , 1995b ) , was shown to be about a factor of 2 larger taking bremsstrahlung into account ( arnold _ et al .",
    "_ , 2001 ) .    for the viscosity of the photon component using the above mean free path , the photon density ( see above ) , and the mean photon energy @xmath129 we find @xmath130 corresponding to @xmath131 pa s at @xmath25 mev .",
    "hence the viscosity of the epp @xmath132 has similar contributions from the electrons and photons .    a more advanced calculation of the total viscosity of the epp based on the kubo formula yields within logarithmic accuracy ( arnold _ et al .",
    "_ , 2000 ) @xmath133 this result is about a factor of 1.5 larger than the one presented here based on the elementary kinetic theory , which is typically valid within a factor of 2 ( reif , 1965 ) .",
    "at high temperatures above 10 mev also other particle species will be produced , e.g. muons with a mass of @xmath134 mev .",
    "their rate follows to lowest order from the diagram in fig.7 ( born term ) .",
    "we assume that @xmath135 holds .",
    "the first inequality implies that the electron mass can be put to zero and the latter inequality implies that muons are not equilibrated . then the muon production rate to lowest order ( @xmath136 )",
    "is given by @xmath137}{1+\\exp[-(e - p)/(2 t ) ] } , \\label{e24}\\ ] ] where @xmath138 is the invariant mass of the virtual photon @xmath139 , @xmath22 its energy and @xmath140 its momentum .",
    "this formula was derived by combining the cross section for the process in berends _ et al . _ ( 1973 ) with the production rate in cleymans _",
    "( 1987 ) where the quark - antiquark annihilation process @xmath141 was considered .",
    "here we assumed the chemical potential @xmath142 .",
    "the only difference to the process considered here comes from the fractional charge of the quarks , i.e. we use here @xmath143 , and from the number of colors in the distribution functions in ( 6a , b ) of cleymans _",
    "( 1987 ) , i.e. dividing the qgp rate by a factor of 9 .",
    "in addition a factor @xmath144 appears in the electron - positron annihilation cross section - see ( 6 ) of berends _ et al . _",
    "( 1973 ) after integrating over the angle - compared to the quark - antiquark annihilation cross section in ( 5 ) of cleymans _",
    "( 1987 ) , using the relative velocity of the ultrarelativistic particles @xmath145 .",
    "because of @xmath146 the rate is suppressed exponentially for temperatures below @xmath147 .    in order to obtain the spectrum from this formula one has to integrate over the space - time volume , taking into account the space - time evolution by using , for example , a hydrodynamical model .",
    "the total muon yield then follows from integrating the spectrum over the energy and momentum of the virtual photon .    at temperatures above 10 mev",
    "also hadron production becomes important , in particular pion production ( kuznetsova _ et al .",
    "_ , 2008 ) .",
    "epps produced in strong laser fields are probably not in complete equilibrium .",
    "for example , it has been predicted by shen and meyer - ter - vehn ( 2001 ) that an positron density of about @xmath148 m@xmath28 at a temperature of 10 mev can be reached .",
    "this density deviates from the equilibrium density ( [ e5 ] ) by 12 orders of magnitude . in the following",
    "we will therefore assume that the epp produced by lasers is in thermal but not in chemical equilibrium .",
    "then we can replace the distribution functions for the electrons by fermi - dirac distributions multiplied by a fugacity factor @xmath149 describing the deviation from chemical equilibrium , @xmath150 .",
    "this assumption has been used for example for describing the chemical equilibration of the qgp in ultrarelativistic heavy - ion collisions ( bir _ et al . _ , 1993 ) .",
    "the fugacity is given by the ratio of the experimental to equilibrium particle density , since the experimental density follows from integrating over the non - equilibrium distribution , i.e. @xmath151    using the real time formalism , qed perturbation theory and the htl method can also be extended to non - equilibrium situations like the one discussed above ( carrington _ et al .",
    "_ , 1999 ) .",
    "for example , the effective photon mass is given now by @xmath152    for @xmath25 mev we then find for the non - equilibrium photon mass @xmath153 ev and the plasma frequency @xmath154 hz .",
    "the debye screening length in such an epp is @xmath155 @xmath37 m . in order to speak of a plasma with collective behavior its dimension",
    "@xmath156 should be much larger than @xmath157 , i.e. at least of the order of 1 @xmath37 m .",
    "furthermore , an anisotropic epp can also be described by quantum field theoretic methods ( mrwczyski and thoma , 2000 ) . in this case instabilities can occur ( mrwczyski and thoma , 2007 ) .",
    "finally a possible difference between the positron density and the electron density can be treated by introducing a finite chemical potential @xmath37 , i.e. using the distribution @xmath158 for the electrons ( negative sign ) and positrons ( positive sign ) .",
    "such a difference comes from the fact that the laser produced epp is embeded in a hot electron and cold ion background of the target .",
    "therefore there will be an excess of electrons over positrons in the hot , relativistic epp .",
    "the methods described above , such as the htl resummation , can be generalized easily to this case ( vija and thoma , 1995 ) .",
    "for example , the energy density is given by @xmath159 or the effective photon energy by @xmath160 the muon production rate for finite chemical potential can be found by replacing the last three factors in ( [ e24 ] ) by ( 13 ) of cleymans _",
    "the properties of ultrarelativistic epps can be treated by qed perturbation theory at finite temperature similarly as the qgp by qcd using the imaginary or real time formalism .",
    "a consistent treatment requires the use of the htl resummation technique for many quantities under consideration .",
    "many results can be more or less directly taken from the corresponding qgp calculation .",
    "the examples discussed here are the equation of state , the dielectric tensor , the dispersion relations of photons and electrons , the debye screening length , damping and transport rates , mean free paths , collision times , shear viscosity , stopping power , and the muon production rate",
    ". in particular collective phenomena , such as plasma waves , are of interest . in an epp",
    "completely new phenomena appear , namely collective fermion modes associated with the possibility to observe van hove singularities .",
    "epps produced by strong lasers open the unique possibility to investigate these plasmas and their properties which also exist in astrophysical systems , e.g. supernova explosions .",
    "however , current predictions indicate that laser induced epps are not in chemical equilibrium .",
    "their properties therefore require an extension of perturbative qed and the htl resummation technique to non - equilibrium situations , which is possible within the real time formalism . as a first application we discussed the debye screening length in such an epp , demonstrating that the epp should have a spatial extension of at least one micron to exhibit a characteristic plasma behavior .    here",
    "we have considered a number of relevant properties of an ultrarelativistic , equilibrated epp as a reference for future laboratory experiments and astrophysical epps and gave numbers for a plasma temperature of 10 mev .",
    "the results are summarized in the table below .",
    "new results , which have not been published so far , are the electron transport rate ( [ e18 ] ) , the electron viscosity ( [ e20 ] ) , and the photon viscosity ( [ e24 ] ) . also new is the application of the results , derived here or compiled from the literature , to relativistic laser plasmas as presented in the third row of the table and in the discussion of non - equilibrium effects .    further quantities , e.g. the radiative energy loss , or higher order corrections , e.g. beyond the leading logarithm approximation , to the quantities considered above could be evaluated in a similar way as discussed above .",
    "also an extension of the properties discussed in sections ii - v to the case of a chemical non - equilibrated epp would be of interest .",
    "finally we did not consider here the formation of an epp in a strong laser field , e.g. by the schwinger mechanism , and its equilibration ."
