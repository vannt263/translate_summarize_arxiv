    "a poincar hyperboloid , as a mathematical object , has many peculiarities appealing to physicists interests .",
    "it is a maximally symmetric and curved two - dimensional space . unlike a sphere which is also a maximally symmetric and curved two - dimensional space",
    ", a poincar hyperboloid is an open space with a negative scalar curvature .",
    "a poincar hyperboloid can be pictured as an embedded manifold in a three - dimensional minkowski space with the embedding equation @xmath0 .",
    "this embedded manifold is endowed with the induced metric which gives a negative ricci scalar .",
    "another aspect of a poincar hyperboloid is that all the riemann surfaces with genus equal to a greater than two can be obtained by suitable identifications of points of this poincar hyperboloid@xcite .    in this work",
    ", we analyze the quantum structure of a poincar hyperboloid . starting from the poisson brackets among the phase space variables of the three - dimensional minkowski space and introducing the constraint @xmath1",
    ", we derive the modified poisson brackets among the phase space variables of a classical system of a free particle on a poincar hyperboloid . from these modified poisson brackets",
    "we derive the dirac brackets and show that the dirac bracket algebra turns out to be the algebra of @xmath2 , the poincar group on @xmath3-dimensional minkowski space .",
    "this algebra has 6 generators @xmath4 .",
    "there are also two constraints @xmath5 , @xmath6 both of which are the casimir operators of this algebra@xcite .",
    "these two constraints reduce the dimension of the algebra from six to four which is the dimensionality of the phase space of the poincar hyperboloid .",
    "we also give the representation of this algebra .",
    "due to the 2nd constraint , the hilbert space is spanned by the states with quantum numbers corresponding to the coordinates of the poincar hyperboloid .",
    "we explicitly derive the form of the hamiltonian in this representation , which agrees with the known result@xcite .    in the next section we consider a classical system of a free particle on a poincar hyperboloid . in section",
    "iii we derive the dirac bracket algebra and in section iv we give the representation of this algebra . finally in section",
    "v we give a brief summary .",
    "we begin with a 3-dimensional minkowski space @xmath7 with metric @xmath8 .",
    "the coordinates of this space are @xmath9 and the metric is given by @xmath10 the dynamics of a free particle in this space would be governed by the following poisson bracket relations among the phase space variables of this theory @xmath11 and the hamiltonian @xmath12 this hamiltonian has no lower bound and the quantum version would be problematic .",
    "we now introduce a constraint given by @xmath13 the sub - space satisfying this constraint is composed of two separate components .",
    "we choose the component with @xmath14(fig .",
    "1 ) .",
    "this space is called poincar hyperboloid .",
    "we choose @xmath15 as the coordinates on this hyperboloid . @xmath16",
    "the induced metric is given by @xmath17 note that this metric is positive definite and the subspace is spacelike .",
    "killing s equation @xmath18 has three independent solutions . @xmath19",
    "the dynamics of a particle on this hyperboloid is given by the following geodesic equations .",
    "@xmath20 this equation can also be derived from the action @xmath21    another way to describe the dynamics of a particle on the hyperboloid starts from the poisson bracket relations given in eq([xxxx]-[ppp ] ) . to derive the poisson bracket relations among the phase space variables of the hyperboloid",
    ", we follow the standard procedure developed by dirac@xcite .",
    "first we modify the hamiltonian in eq([hamil ] ) as @xmath22 and introduce @xmath23 as the conjugate momentum of the lagrange multiplier @xmath24 . @xmath25",
    "the primary constraint @xmath26 leads to a secondary constraint @xmath27 through @xmath28 and we get @xmath29 with c in eq([c0 ] ) .",
    "by imposing @xmath30 we get @xmath31 similarly from @xmath32 we get @xmath33 no further constraint appears because @xmath34 we , therefore , have four constraints @xmath35 to impose on the 8-dimensional phase space @xmath36 .",
    "the subspace satisfying these constraints forms a 4-dimensional space which should be considered as the phase space of our system ( a particle on a hyperboloid ) .",
    "the poisson bracket relations should be modified in such a way that the four constraints are respected . denoting the modified poisson bracket by @xmath37 , the relation between @xmath37 and the original poisson bracket @xmath38 is given by @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the inverse of the @xmath41 matrix @xmath42 defined by @xmath43 the matrix @xmath42 and its inverse @xmath40 are as follows : @xmath44 @xmath45",
    "note that the modified poisson bracket relations automatically respect the constraints and we can safely put @xmath46 .",
    "the modified poisson bracket relations are as follows : @xmath47 two variables @xmath24 , @xmath48 disappear after solving the constraints @xmath49 and @xmath50 and we are left with only two constraints @xmath27 , @xmath51 to be imposed on our 6 variables @xmath52 .",
    "the hamiltonian , after solving the constraints , regains its original form @xmath53 this hamiltonian on the constrained phase space has zero as its lower bound . in order to prove this , we solve constraints @xmath49 and @xmath27 and get @xmath54 substituting these into the hamiltonian we obtain @xmath55 , \\label{hh}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the angle @xmath56 is defined by @xmath57 which is bounded by @xmath58 .",
    "it is obvious that the hamiltonian in eq.([hh ] ) can never be negative and vanishes when @xmath59 .",
    "the classical equation of motion is obtained by @xmath60 we observe that @xmath61 , which assures the motion is confined in the hyperboloid and the force @xmath62 is normal to the hyperboloid indicating that this force is the constraint force .",
    "it can be shown that the equation of motion is the geodesic on the hyperboloid .    before quantizing this theory",
    ", we introduce new variables @xmath63 defined by @xmath64 then @xmath65 can be obtained through @xmath66 here @xmath67 is defined by @xmath68 with @xmath69 as new phase variables , we have @xmath70 with constraints @xmath71 note that @xmath72 is automatically satisfied due to the relation in eq([pi ] ) .",
    "new constraint @xmath73 appears from the definition of @xmath63(eq([ji ] ) ) .",
    "the hamiltonian in these variables becomes @xmath74",
    "the transition from classical to quantum physics is achieved by changing poisson brackets to dirac brackets as @xmath75=i\\hbar\\{a , b\\}_{m}$ ] .",
