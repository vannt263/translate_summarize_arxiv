    "<S> a major impediment of using coherent anti - stokes raman scattering to identify biological molecules is that the illumination levels required to produce a measurable signal often also produce significant nonresonant background from the medium , especially from water , that is not specific to the resonance being investigated . </S>",
    "<S> we present a method of using nonlinear interferometry to measure the temporal shape of the anti - stokes signal to differentiate which components are resonant and nonresonant . </S>",
    "<S> this method is easily adaptable to most existing pulsed cars illumination methods and should allow for distinguishing resonant cars when using higher energy pulses . by examining the differences between signals produced by acetone and water , </S>",
    "<S> we show that the resonant and nonresonant signals can be clearly differentiated .    </S>",
    "<S> the combination of microscopy and coherent anti - stokes raman scattering ( cars ) processes  @xcite is a promising tool to study the composition of biological tissues at micrometer scales . like two - photon microscopy </S>",
    "<S> , cars microscopy uses a nonlinear interaction to produce a confined point response in the medium . </S>",
    "<S> however , cars utilizes endogenous molecular resonances in the tissue and does not require exogenous dyes or markers to be introduced . because cars consists of two stimulated raman scattering ( srs ) processes </S>",
    "<S> , there is a quadratic dependence on the anti - stokes produced by cars on the density of molecules with a target resonance . </S>",
    "<S> frequently the anti - stokes signal is small because the desired target molecule is present at a low concentration . to compensate for this , </S>",
    "<S> higher energy pulses are used . however , at sufficiently high peak power a large non - resonant four - wave - mixing component is generated . </S>",
    "<S> if the power of the anti - stokes light is examined , one can not distinguish the nonresonant signal from the desired resonant signal . </S>",
    "<S> we utilize interferometry to distinguish the resonant cars from the nonresonant background based on the emission time by using the interferometric time gate to reject the early - emitted nonresonant signal . </S>",
    "<S> this is a simplification of the nonlinear interferometric vibrational imaging ( nivi )  @xcite method proposed earlier that is more suited to integration with existing cars pump / stokes pulse generation methods .    </S>",
    "<S> a typical cars process consists of two srs processes . </S>",
    "<S> a molecule is excited by two overlapped pulses , a pump pulse of frequency @xmath0 and a stokes pulse of frequency @xmath1 separated by the resonance frequency @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> some of this excitation is converted to anti - stokes radiation at frequency @xmath3 by mixing with the pump . </S>",
    "<S> the amount of anti - stokes radiation depends on the square of the intensity of the pump pulse and linearly with the stokes pulse . </S>",
    "<S> often the intensities needed to produce a measurable cars signal stimulate other nonlinear nonresonant processes that do not depend on the presence of the target molecule producing a non - negligible background signal , potentially causing an erroneous concentration measurement . </S>",
    "<S> distinguishing the processes that are resonant and therefore specific to a target molecule and nonresonant processes is a significant limitation when using cars at high pulse energies .    </S>",
    "<S> other means of distinguishing resonant cars from nonresonant signals have been explored . because phase - matching in bulk media favors forward propagating anti - stokes radiation , more backreflected ( epi - cars ) anti - stokes is produced by smaller subwavelength sized particles , and less so by the surrounding medium  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the production of resonant cars can be favored by careful preparation of the polarization and phase of the illumination  @xcite , or selected by polarization  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , it is possible to use a delayed probe pulse from the pump / stokes pulse to measure the resonant excitation if the probe pulse is differentiated spatially or spectrally from the pump pulse  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , with the tight focusing required and in the presence of highly scattering media , these methods may be less practical for biological tissue .    to see how nonresonant signals and resonant cars can be separated , consider that nonresonant signals arise from four wave mixing processes mediated by virtual states . in nonresonant four - wave - mixing , virtual states exist only where and when the pump and stokes pulses coincide , so that the anti - stokes is only produced at the instant they are overlapped . </S>",
    "<S> resonant cars is produced because a molecular vibrational , rotational , or electronic state is excited by srs . </S>",
    "<S> this excitation persists after the excitation pulse ends , often for a picosecond or more . </S>",
    "<S> an analogous situation exists when comparing the beating of a drum to the plucking of a guitar string . like a guitar string , the vibration of a molecular resonance decays slowly , while a drum beat ends quickly after the impulse is over . </S>",
    "<S> if pump light continues to illuminate the molecule , the molecular excitation can be converted by srs to anti - stokes radiation . </S>",
    "<S> because the resonant excitation lasts much longer than the nonresonant excitation , the anti - stokes also lasts longer . </S>",
    "<S> thus anti - stokes radiation caused by resonant cars continues to be emitted later than the nonresonant signal . with properly designed pulses </S>",
    "<S> , the resonant and nonresonant signals can be clearly separated .    </S>",
    "<S> our approach is to prepare narrowband pump and stokes pulses , but with the pump pulse stretched out in time to be at least three times longer than the stokes pulse . </S>",
    "<S> the shorter stokes pulse coincides with the leading edge of the pump pulse . </S>",
    "<S> a simulation of this is shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : fig1 ] . </S>",
    "<S> when the overlapped pulses arrive , the molecule is excited by srs . at the same time , nonresonant four - wave - mixing is emitted , overlapped with the stokes pulse . </S>",
    "<S> after the stokes pulse passes , so does the nonresonant signal . </S>",
    "<S> however , the molecule remains excited . as the pump continues to arrive , </S>",
    "<S> the excitation is converted to anti - stokes radiation by srs . </S>",
    "<S> this produces a resonant anti - stokes signal similar to that shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : fig1 ] , which has a resonant `` tail '' unlike the nonresonant anti - stokes , which coincides with the stokes alone . by delaying a reference pulse at the anti - stokes frequency </S>",
    "<S> until after the nonresonant signal has passed , the reference can act as an interference gate to reject nonresonant components .        </S>",
    "<S> interferometric time gating is commonly used to characterize the shape of ultrafast pulses  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these methods typically work by interfering a reference pulse with a known electric field amplitude with an unknown pulse to be characterized . </S>",
    "<S> if the reference pulse is short in time compared to the unknown pulse , then interference between the two pulses only occurs over the interval of the reference pulse . by delaying the two pulses relative to each other , the cross - correlation of the two pulses </S>",
    "<S> is measured . </S>",
    "<S> a resonant cars signal has a much longer cross - correlation signal in time than a nonresonant signal . to obtain the needed short reference pulse , nonresonant four - wave - mixing or other cascaded nonresonant nonlinear processes stimulated by short pulses </S>",
    "<S> can be used . in particular , a reference pulse delayed until after the nonresonant signal arrives at the photodetector prevents an interference signal from being obtained from the nonresonant component .    to experimentally validate this idea </S>",
    "<S> , we used the setup of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : fig2 ] to measure the interferograms of anti - stokes light produced by acetone and water . </S>",
    "<S> acetone has a raman resonance at 2925 @xmath4 corresponding to the c - h stretch , while water does not , containing only hydrogen and oxygen . </S>",
    "<S> water is of primary interest because it is a ubiquitous and pernicious source of nonresonant signal in biological tissues . in the setup , a regenerative amplifier ( rega 9000 , coherent , inc . </S>",
    "<S> santa clara , ca ) emits pulses at 250 khz repetition rate with 808 nm center wavelength and 20 nm bandwidth . </S>",
    "<S> these pulses are used both as the pump and also to seed a second - harmonic - generation optical parametric amplfier ( opa ) ( opa 9450 , coherent ) which generates idler pulses with 1056 nm center wavelength and 20 nm bandwidth for use as a stokes pulse . </S>",
    "<S> a 105 mm length bk7 glass dove prism disperses the pump pulse to approximately three times the length of the stokes pulse . </S>",
    "<S> the pump pulse is delayed to arrive at a dichroic beamsplitter at the same time as the stokes pulse . </S>",
    "<S> the pulses are overlapped and are focused into the sample by a 30 mm focal length lens , which produces anti - stokes radiation centered at 653 nm . </S>",
    "<S> the pump power at the sample was 40 mw , while the stokes was 2 mw , with sufficient peak power to produce abundant resonant and nonresonant signals . </S>",
    "<S> at the same time , the signal pulse from the opa , also at 653 nm , is used as the reference pulse . because the signal pulse is produced by cascaded nonresonant @xmath5 nonlinearities , it is short and nearly transform - limited . </S>",
    "<S> a mach - zehnder interferometer is used to combine the reference pulse and the cars signal . </S>",
    "<S> the signals are attenuated by neutral density filters by many orders of magnitude before they are detected by a photomultiplier tube . by scanning the relative delay between the two signals , </S>",
    "<S> their interferometric cross - correlation was measured .        </S>",
    "<S> fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : fig3 ] shows the interferograms measured from acetone . as can clearly be seen , the interferograms agree qualitatively with fig .  [ </S>",
    "<S> fig : fig1 ] . </S>",
    "<S> the acetone , having a persistent resonance , generates a resonant anti - stokes `` tail '' with a length limited not by the lifetime of the resonance but by the length of the pump pulse , because the pump is needed to produce anti - stokes radiation . as the pump / stokes frequency difference is tuned away from the resonance at 2925 @xmath6 , the resonant `` tail '' disappears . </S>",
    "<S> the tuning resolution is limited by the broad stokes bandwidth of approximately 150 @xmath4 , which is much wider than the raman susceptibility linewidth . on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : fig4 ] shows the interferogram from water , which is completely nonresonant at 2925 @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> the resonant and nonresonant signals are discernible interferometrically despite the fact that the excitation power used produced enough cars light to be clearly seen by the unaided eye scattered from white paper .            </S>",
    "<S> we have demonstrated a difference in the temporal evolution of anti - stokes pulses produced by nonresonant and resonant four - wave - mixing processes . </S>",
    "<S> this approach utilizes nonlinear interferometry and appropriate reference and excitation pulses to measure the tail of resonant cars </S>",
    "<S> . such an approach will likely be very useful in cars microscopy and nivi  @xcite to eliminate the nonresonant background signal in addition to the other advantanges that interferometric detection can provide such as heterodyne sensitivity and stray light rejection . </S>"
