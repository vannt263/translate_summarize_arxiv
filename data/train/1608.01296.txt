    "coherent detection has been widely investigated and successfully applied in many wireless communication systems @xcite .",
    "however , coherent detection requires accurate channel state information , which becomes expensive or even infeasible to obtain in certain scenarios , such as ultra - wideband impulse radio ( uwb - ir ) systems , massive multiple - input multiple - output ( mimo ) systems , millimeter communications , dense wireless networks and so on @xcite-@xcite .",
    "therefore , noncoherent detection avoiding channel estimation has attracted growing research interests @xcite , @xcite .",
    "noncoherent detection techniques primarily rely on differential detection ( dd ) @xcite . due to the doubled variance of the effective noise ,",
    "the standard one - symbol dd suffers 3db signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) loss in the bit - error rate ( ber ) performance compared to their coherent counterparts . to circumvent this dilemma ,",
    "multiple - symbol differential detection ( msdd ) has been advocated as an effective algorithm for improving the detection performance of differential receivers @xcite-@xcite . by exploiting an increased observation window size",
    ", msdd is capable of flexibly reducing the ber performance gap between noncoherent and coherent detection .    noncoherent detection also leads to promising low - complexity and energy - efficient receivers for multipath fading channels @xcite . as a milestone for reliable communication over multipath fading channels , multi - antenna based space - time block - codes ( stbc ) were invented in @xcite , which substantially improved the ber performance compared to the single - antenna systems .",
    "furthermore , dd - based stbc ( dstbc ) systems were proposed in @xcite . in order to reduce the snr loss facing the dd scheme of @xcite ,",
    "an msdd algorithm was conceived for dstbc systems in @xcite .",
    "generalized likelihood ratio test based msdd ( glrt - msdd ) , decision feedback based msdd and sphere decoding based msdd ( sd - msdd ) were investigated for the dstbc aided systems in @xcite .",
    "however , the aforementioned msdd algorithms are all based on hard - decision detection , whose ber performance often remains unsatisfactory . by comparison ,",
    "soft - decision based iterative msdd has been perceived as a more promising algorithm for improving the detection performance in channel - coded systems @xcite-@xcite , where msdd is typically concatenated in an iterative manner @xcite with the decoder of an error - correcting code ( ecc ) that is capable of generating soft outputs , such as convolutional codes , turbo codes and low - density parity - check codes @xcite-@xcite . in iterative msdd schemes of channel - coded systems , how to calculate",
    "the _ a posteriori _ probability ( app ) of each bit transmitted becomes the key problem of interest .",
    "owing to the appealing benefit of forward - and - backward message passing , belief propagation ( bp ) has been successfully applied in many applications , especially in iterative receiver design @xcite-@xcite .",
    "however , most of them are investigated in the context of coherent detection systems . to the best of our knowledge , no bp - based soft - input soft - output ( siso ) msdd has been proposed in the open literature in noncoherent dstbc - aided uwb - ir systems .    against the above background , in this paper , our aim is to design a bp - based siso msdd framework with its illustrative application in the dstbc aided uwb - ir systems .",
    "our particular attention is focused on how to calculate the apps of the information bits transmitted . as such , firstly ,",
    "an equivalent channel model is proposed for msdd that relies on sampling with an autocorrelation receiver ( acr ) architecture .",
    "furthermore , we describe the acr sampling with a trellis structure and then decompose the trellis into multiple subtrellises . as a beneficial result",
    ", the bidirectional message passing of bp is performed on these subtrellises , and a mathematical framework for soft msdd , dubbed bp - msdd , is obtained . since all subtrellises are taken into account , our bp - msdd is capable of generating reliable _ a posteriori _ information .",
    "notably , the proposed bp - msdd is capable of achieving more competitive detection performance than the existing glrt - msdd advocated for the dstbc aided uwb systems .",
    "however , the computational complexity of the bp - msdd increases exponentially with the number of msdd trellis states . additionally , as a common feature of msdd schemes , bp - msdd also exhibits high computational complexity when the observation window size increases . to circumvent the excessive complexity of bp - msdd , we further propose a viterbi algorithm ( va)-based hard - decision msdd ( va - hmsdd ) and a va - based soft - decision msdd ( va - smsdd ) , which constitute attractive practical alternatives due to their advantage over bp - msdd in terms of performance - versus - complexity tradeoff .",
    "additionally , the proposed bp - msdd and va - smsdd can be exploited in conjunction with soft channel decoder to conduct iterative detection and decoding ( idd ) .",
    "hence , they are particularly attractive for the noncoherent systems . for example , due to the high frequency selectivity and dense multipaths of uwb - ir channels @xcite , noncoherent uwb - ir systems are preferred because of their low implementation complexity .",
    "although the proposed msdd algorithms can generally be used in a number of noncoherent detection scenarios , for the sake of convenience , in this paper our numerical simulations are carried out in the context of dstbc aided uwb - ir systems to validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms . for explicit clarity ,",
    "the main contributions of this paper are summarized as follows .     )     an equivalent channel model is developed with the aid of a rigorous theoretic analysis in the context of dstbc aided uwb - ir systems .",
    "this model is attractive , because relying on this model , accurate soft information can be efficiently obtained for msdd .     inspired by the forward - and - backward message passing mechanism of bp , the bp - msdd is conceived , of which the message passing mechanism is implemented on the dstbc trellis diagram .",
    "in contrast to the existing msdd algorithms of @xcite , @xcite , the proposed bp - msdd exclusively benefits from its bidirectional passing mechanism .    in order to circumvent the excessive complexity of bp - msdd for practical applications ,",
    "the survivor paths of the glrt - msdd trellises are obtained by reducing the number of trellis states , and correspondingly , the va - hmsdd is proposed , in which the maximum tolerable computational complexity can be restricted through a proper selection of the va memory depth .",
    "this advantage is particularly attractive , because the prohibitive computational complexity of the glrt - msdd trellises is one of the major challenges facing the bp - msdd .    upon extending the trellis - based detection further ,",
    "the va - smsdd is designed for enhancing the detection performance of va - hmsdd .",
    "another benefit of the va - smsdd is that it also enjoys a lower computational complexity than the bp - msdd .",
    "more specifically , the computational complexity of bp - msdd increases exponentially with the number of the trellis states . by contrast , va - smsdd has a computational complexity increasing only linearly with the number of trellis states , although its ber performance is slightly degraded compared with that of bp - msdd .",
    "we emphasize that the msdd algorithms proposed in this paper can be extended and applied in many other communication systems after necessary minor adaptations .",
    "for example , several msdd schemes have been developed for the symbol detection in differential phase shift keying ( dpsk ) aided systems as well as differential space - time encoded mimo systems @xcite . in particular , we consider the dstbc aided uwb - ir system just as an application for illustrating the principle of the proposed msdds .",
    "the uwb - ir system exploits narrow pulses of nanoseconds to transmit information bits , and the received signal consists of a large number of resolvable multipath components after passing through the uwb - ir channel .",
    "hence , the stringent requirement imposed on channel estimation makes it difficult and costly to implement the optimal coherent receiver .",
    "thus , noncoherent detection becomes inevitable in uwb - ir systems . in",
    "what follows , the proposed bp - msdd , va - hmsdd and va - smsdd will be investigated in the context of dstbc aided uwb - ir systems .",
