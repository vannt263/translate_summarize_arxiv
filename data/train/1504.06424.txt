    "even though the 125-gev boson is found to have many properties very similar to the higgs boson in the standard model ( sm ) , it is still far from clear whether it is the sole entity responsible for the breakdown of electroweak symmetry and mass of all elementary particles . besides , there is no established guiding principle about the structure of the higgs sector other than the lorentz and gauge symmetries .",
    "it is therefore not unnatural to consider additional higgs representations that also contribute to the symmetry breaking and may have a connection to a hidden sector .    as a new physics model with an extended higgs sector ,",
    "the georgi - machacek ( gm ) model  @xcite has some intriguing features not shared by commonly considered models whose extra higgs fields are only singlets and/or doublets . in addition to a doublet field",
    "@xmath6 with @xmath7 as in the sm , the gm model has a triplet field @xmath8 composed of a complex triplet @xmath9 of hypercharge @xmath10 and a real triplet @xmath11 of @xmath12 under the sm @xmath13 gauge symmetry . starting with a higgs potential with custodial symmetry and vacuum alignment between the complex and real triplets",
    ", the model preserves the electroweak rho parameter @xmath14 at tree level .",
    "this allows the possibility of the triplet vacuum expectation value ( vev ) , @xmath15 , as large as up to a few tens of gev .",
    "the model has many higgs bosons , including the sm - like higgs boson @xmath1 and another singlet @xmath16 , one 3-plet @xmath17 , and one 5-plet @xmath18 , with mass degeneracy within each multiplet as a result of the custodial symmetry  @xcite . due to the mixing between the higgs doublet and triplet fields",
    ", the couplings between the sm - like higgs boson and the weak gauge bosons can be stronger than their sm values  @xcite , leading to interesting collider phenomenology  @xcite . in the case of large triplet vev , the 5-plet couples dominantly to the weak gauge bosons .",
    "therefore , vector boson fusion processes serve the most promising channels to search for such exotic higgs bosons and verify their mass degeneracy at the lhc  @xcite . besides",
    ", the model has the @xmath19 vertex at tree level .",
    "such a vertex is known to be small in multidoublet models , because they appear only at loop levels . besides , neutrinos can obtain majorana mass from the higgs triplet vev through the so - called type - ii seesaw mechanism .",
    "the couplings between the triplet field and leptons lead to lepton number - violating processes and possibly even lepton flavour - violating ones .",
    "many of the above - mentioned properties and couplings depend on the value of the triplet vev , @xmath15 , which serves as a quantitative indicator for the participation of the higgs triplet in the electroweak symmetry breaking .",
    "it is therefore of great interest to experimentally determine or constrain this parameter in the model . in the following ,",
    "we discuss how some of the lhc data have been used to put constraints on the model , particularly in the scenario where the mixing between the doublet and the triplet is small , as favoured by the sm - like higgs data .",
    "it is more convenient to organise the isospin doublet field @xmath6 and the triplet fields @xmath9 with @xmath20 and @xmath11 with @xmath21   with @xmath22 being the third isospin number . ] in an @xmath23 covariant form : @xmath24 where the phase convention for the component scalar fields is such that @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 .",
    "moreover , the neutral components after electroweak symmetry breaking are parameterised as @xmath29 where @xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 denote the vev s of @xmath6 , @xmath9 and @xmath11 , respectively",
    ". the explicit form of most general higgs potential consistent with the @xmath33 symmetry can be found , for example , in ref .",
    "the physical 5-plet , @xmath34 , arises within the @xmath8 field .",
    "the two 3-plet fields mix through the angle @xmath35 to render a physical cp - odd higgs 3-plet , denoted by @xmath36 , and another ng 3-plet , @xmath37 , to become the longitudinal components of the weak gauge bosons .",
    "the two cp - even singlet fields further mix by an angle @xmath3 , determined by the quartic coupling constants in the higgs potential , to produce the sm - like higgs boson @xmath1 and another physical singlet denoted by @xmath38 .    under the vacuum alignment assumption @xmath39 ,",
    "the masses of the @xmath2 and @xmath40 bosons have exactly the same form as in the sm : @xmath41 and @xmath42 , where @xmath43 is the weak mixing angle and @xmath44 .",
    "therefore , the electroweak rho parameter is unity at tree level .",
    "define the ratio of the vev s as @xmath45 which is the reciprocal of @xmath46 used in most other works and goes to infinity in the sm limit .",
    "if one requires that the fermion mass comes from yukawa couplings with the higgs doublet and the top yukawa coupling is perturbative , then the triplet vev has an upper bound @xmath47 gev .",
    "recently , the same - sign diboson process @xmath48 had been measured at the lhc using leptonic decay channels of @xmath2 bosons , with production cross sections of two fiducial regions reported to be consistent with the standard model expectations within @xmath49  @xcite .",
    "the results can be used to constrain new physics models with a modified quartic @xmath2 vertex , as in the case of the gm model due to the mediations of exotic higgs bosons .    -@xmath15",

    "a milder bound on @xmath15 is also obtained , as more events from the @xmath55 contribution are rejected by the kinematic cuts used by atlas . at the 14-tev lhc ,",

    "the superscript ggf means the production channel , including @xmath81 and @xmath82 processes , and vbf includes the vector boson fusion and associated productions . as a result of suppression in the coupling with fermions ,",
    "the ggf production of @xmath38 is significantly smaller than the vbf process .",

    "qualitatively , a nonzero @xmath88 coupling will result in a suppression of the regular search channels when @xmath89 gev , and may lead to more production of four - body final states .",

    "this is related to the fact that the signal strength in this case is mainly enhanced in the low - mass regime only .",
    "however , the bounds from @xmath55 is useful in the sense that unlike fig .  [",
    "fig : h1 ] for @xmath38 , they are independent of the mixing angle @xmath3 .",
    "we note in passing that no useful constraint can be obtained from the @xmath84 mode yet , is a result of the non - universal scaling behaviors in the couplings with the weak bosons .    since the @xmath66 does not couple to the weak gauge bosons",
