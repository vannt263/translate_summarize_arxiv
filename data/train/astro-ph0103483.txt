    "as forming stars accrete mass inside molecular clouds , they simultaneously throw away a large fraction of that mass in a vigorous outflow . so - called  molecular \" or ",
    "co \" outflows are one of several manifestations of these mass outflows from young stellar objects ( ysos ) .",
    "the molecular outflows consist primarily of swept - up ambient cloud material , and are most likely driven by an underlying ( faster ) flow emanating from the forming star and/or its circumstellar disk .",
    "spectral - line observations of molecular outflows have shown that they exhibit several common observational characteristics . a log - log plot of outflow mass as a function of velocity ( a.k.a .",
    "a  mass spectrum \" ) , usually shows power - law mass - velocity ( @xmath0 ) relations where @xmath1 .",
    "position - velocity relations of outflows often exhibit another common characteristic a so - called  hubble - law \" where the maximum velocity of the outflowing gas increases nearly linearly with distance from the source .",
    "many observational and theoretical studies have found that molecular outflows have a mass spectrum with @xmath2 ( e.g. , lada & fich 1996 ; smith , suttner , & yorke  1997 ; matzner & mckee  1999 ) , and that the outflows can be characterized by a single hubble - law ( e.g. , meyers - rice & lada  1991 , shu et al .",
    "1991 ; lada & fich 1996 ; matzner & mckee  1999 ) .",
    "but , recent outflow studies ( e.g. , yu , billawala , & bally  1999 ; arce & goodman  2001 ) have shown @xmath3 to be much steeper than 2 in some cases . furthermore , the position - velocity diagrams of those steep - mass - spectrum molecular outflows are characterized by several hubble - law  wedges , \" rather than a single one . in this _ letter _ , we show how an _ episodic _ to @xmath4 yr ) are characterized by events of violent mass ejection ( @xmath5 to @xmath6 m@xmath7 yr@xmath8 ) every 500 to @xmath9 yr or so , with states of no , or very low ( @xmath10 to @xmath11 m@xmath7 yr@xmath8 ) mass ejection between the violent outburst episodes . several mechanisms which produce episodic outflows from young stars",
    "have been discussed in the literature ( e.g. , self - regulated thermal disk instabilities , bell & lin 1994 ; companion - disk interactions in a multiple stellar system , reipurth 2000 , and references therein ) . ]",
    "outflow could easily produce mass spectra with @xmath12 and multiple hubble wedges .",
    "observers measure molecular outflow mass as a function of velocity using molecular spectral line maps , usually of the line . in practice ,",
    "the mass - velocity relation is obtained by calculating mass per @xmath13-wide velocity bin and plotting mass as a function of velocity offset from the host cloud s mean velocity .",
    "the observed mass - velocity relations to date always imply more mass at low outflow velocities than at higher outflow velocities .",
    "usually , @xmath14 vs.  @xmath15 has a broken - power - law appearance , with @xmath16 for  low \" outflow velocities , and @xmath17 for  high \" velocities .",
    "the border between  high \" and  low \" is set by the break in the power law , and @xmath18 ( see bachiller & tafalla 1999 and references therein ) .",
    "hereafter @xmath3 is used to mean @xmath19 whenever @xmath14 has a broken power - law appearance .",
    "most observational outflow studies estimate outflow mass by assuming either that emission is optically thin at all outflow velocities , or by correcting for a constant ( velocity - independent ) line opacity . in the majority of studies where the outflow mass is obtained in this conventional way , @xmath3 ranges from about 0.5 to 3.5 , with a concentration of values near @xmath2 ( e.g. , richer et al .",
    "in fact , however , the line is often optically thick , and the exact value of opacity depends on velocity .",
    "not correcting for the velocity - dependent opacity will , in most cases , underestimate the value of @xmath3 .",
    "a few very recent outflow studies have explicitly taken the velocity - dependent opacity of the line into account when estimating outflow mass , and these studies generally find @xmath12 ( bally et al .",
    "1999 ; yu et al .  1999 ; yu et al .",
    "2000 ; arce & goodman 2001 ) .",
    "discussions on the possible factors that may produce a large value of @xmath3 can be found in yu et al .",
    "( 1999 ) and arce & goodman ( 2001 ) .",
    "but , just because these studies have yielded a steeper mass - spectrum slope , on average , than the `` conventional '' outflow studies , does not necessarily mean that @xmath3 would dramatically increase for all outflows if they were corrected for the velocity - dependent opacity of @xmath20co .",
    "in some cases , usually involving very fast outflows , the assumption that the is optically thin at the outflow velocities is fine , and there is no need for opacity correction . in general , though , we expect that a compilation of velocity - dependent - opacity - corrected mass spectra would yield a distribution of @xmath3 s , with mean @xmath12 .",
    "as discussed in  2.3 below , episodic outflows could produce such a distribution of observed @xmath3 s .",
    "numerical and theoretical studies predict that a molecular outflow mass spectrum should have a power - law dependence . in the numerical models of zhang & zheng ( 1997 ) and of smith",
    "et al .  (",
    "1997 ) , molecular outflows are produced by the entrainment of ambient gas by a bow shock , and @xmath3 is found to be @xmath21 over most of the outflow velocity range .",
    "both models also find a turn - down in the mass spectrum at very high velocities , where @xmath22 . in their numerical models ,",
    "downes & ray ( 1999 ) find that the mass spectrum has a single slope which ranges between 1.58 and 3.75 , depending on certain parameters of the simulation ( i.e. , molecular fraction in the jet , amplitude of the jet velocity variation , and the ratio of jet to ambient density ) .",
    "both smith et al .",
    "( 1997 ) and downes & ray  ( 1999 ) find that @xmath3 increases as the jet ages . according to those models , the ambient material that once was accelerated by bow shock entrainment slows down as times goes by , which steepens the mass spectrum by shifting mass from the  fast \" end of the mass - velocity relation to the  slow \" end .",
    "the simulated outflows of smith et al .",
    "( 1997 ) and downes & ray ( 1999 ) are relatively young ( 600 and 300 years , respectively ) , but it seems reasonable to expect that the qualitative trend of increasing @xmath3 with age would continue as the outflow evolves in time , and once - fast gas slows down . very recent bow shock modeling by lee et al .",
    "( 2000 ) finds that @xmath3 also depends sensitively on the inclination of the outflow axis to the line of sight .",
    "in contrast to the numerical results , the recent analytical study by matzner & mckee ( 1999 ; hereafter mm ) concludes that it is hard to obtain a value of the power - law mass spectrum slope that is not very close to 2 , for all times . unlike the numerical studies listed above , however , the entrainment of the ambient medium in mm is not specifically caused by a bow shock",
    "; rather , it is caused by a collimated wind which sweeps the ambient gas into a momentum - conserving shell , following the models of shu et al .",
    "( 1991 ) and li & shu ( 1996 ) .      as a framework for a future analytic model of an episodic outflow , consider a flow as the sum of many collimated mm - like outflows , each of which originates at a different time , with a slightly different orientation . in this hypothetical picture , the episodic  bursts \" need not all have the same total mass or ejection velocity . as a result , the bursts can even run over themselves in space , with very fast young bursts overtaking older , slower ones . in this picture ,",
    "an observed molecular outflow represents the _ time and space superposition _ of many mm - like individual outflow events . in cases",
    "where many events of comparable energy have taken place within a few dynamical times of each other , the effects of episodicity will be noticeable in the mass - velocity ( and position - velocity , see  3 ) relations measured for the outflow .",
    "in addition , in order for a burst to effect the molecular outflow , the ejection angle between the different bursts should be enough so that each travels through regions of the cloud that have not yet been cleared out of gas by previous bursts .",
    "given that most stellar jets have opening angles of a few degrees ( e.g. , mundt , ray , & raga 1991 ) a change in ejection angle of only a few degrees between different bursts is enough for a burst to easily encounter `` fresh and unperturbed '' cloud material . in the case where the kinetic energy of one of those events completely dominates any others , the effects of episodicity will be less noticeable .    mm show that for any stellar wind with a momentum injection rate distributed in space in proportion to @xmath23 , any momentum - conserving interaction between that wind and an ambient medium with a power - law density profile will have a mass spectrum with @xmath24 .",
    "( see mm and references therein ) .",
    "] so , for the hypothetical episodic flow described above , we can assume that each outburst of an episodic ( hydromagnetic ) wind has a @xmath23 force distribution .",
    "each outburst of outflowing material will not necessarily interact with the same ambient gas conditions , as each successive burst can change the density , velocity and/or temperature distribution of the ambient gas surrounding the wind .",
    "but , mm clearly explain that a value of @xmath3 close to 2 is obtained _ independent _ of the density , velocity and temperature distributions in the ambient gas .",
    "so , in an episodic outflow , we can assume that each independent outburst is responsible for putting ambient gas into motion with a power - law mass - velocity relationship with @xmath2 .",
    "so , what will the _ cumulative _ observed @xmath3 for an episodic outflow be ?",
    "mm say that  @xmath2 \" regardless of the time history of the flow , but that is for a  time history \" where the same flow is just turned on and off , flowing into an ambient medium with a power - law density distribution .",
    "if instead we envision the bursty flow described above , where variable amounts of ambient material are accelerated to assorted maximum velocities ( due either to variations in the wind , or in the ambient medium ) , the observed mass spectrum will be the result of superimposed bursts , and will steepen ( see figure 1 ) .",
    "figure  1 shows a mass spectrum for a hypothetical episodic outflow .",
    "each molecular outflow episode is represented as a power - law going back to zero - velocity should flatten at very low velocities . ] with @xmath25 , but with a unique total mass and maximum velocity .",
    "the observed molecular outflow mass spectrum is the superposition ( sum ) of all past episodes mass spectra .",
    "a power - law fit to the sample `` observed '' mass spectrum in figure 1 results in an `` observed '' @xmath3 of 2.7 .",
    "thus , an episodic wind composed of a series of mm - like ( @xmath26 ) outbursts is able to create a molecular outflow with @xmath27 .",
    "in fact , without additional constraints on the maximum velocity or total mass of any outburst , practically any value of @xmath28 can be created in this way .",
    "one of the best kinematic diagnostics of outflows is a position - velocity ( _ p - v _ ) diagram . the typical molecular outflow _",
    "p - v _ diagram is constructed by summing spectra in strips perpendicular to the assumed outflow axis , and then contouring line intensity as a function of position along the outflow axis and velocity ( see figure 2 ) .    the simplest molecular outflow _",
    "p - v _ diagrams show maximum outflow velocity increasing approximately linearly as a function of distance from the source .",
    "clear examples of this kind of  hubble - law \" velocity distribution are seen in mon  r2 ( meyers - rice & lada  1991 ) and ngc  2264 g ( lada & fich  1996 ; also see bottom panels of figure 2 ) .",
    "in other cases , _ p - v _ diagrams exhibit more complicated behavior , which can often be described as a series of  hubble - wedges \" distributed at various distances from the source ( see top panels of figure 2 ) .",
    "these multiple wedges are seen in small molecular outflows ( 0.4  pc long ) from class 0 sources ( e.g. , l  1448 , bachiller et al .",
    "1990 ) as well as in large ( @xmath29  pc long ) outflows from class i sources ( e.g. , l1551 , bachiller , tafalla , & cernicharo  1994 ; b5 irs1 , yu et al .  ( 1999 ) ; hh  300 , arce & goodman  2001 ) .",
    "outflow models can easily produce a _",
    "single _ hubble - law position - velocity relation , but so far , we do not know of any model that produces multiple hubble - wedges .    the numerical simulations of smith et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , zhang & zheng  ( 1997 ) , and downes & ray  ( 1999 ) in which outflows are created by the entrainment of ambient gas by a single bow shock , all reproduce the hubble velocity law . in these models ,",
    "the hubble velocity law is in part due to the geometry of the bow shock .",
    "a simplified explanation is that the highest forward ( in the traveling direction of the jet ) velocities are found in the apex of the bow shock , which is also the point furthest away from the source .",
    "the forward velocities decrease toward the wings of the bow shock , and the farthest away from the apex ( or closer to the outflow source ) the slower will be the entrained gas ( see figure  3 of masson & chernin  1993 ; and figure  12 of lada & fich  1996 ) .",
    "bow shock models are not the only ones that produce the hubble velocity law ; the studies of shu et al .",
    "( 1991 ) , li & shu  ( 1996 ) and mm also obtain molecular outflows with hubble velocity laws as a natural consequence of their being created by a momentum - conserving wind .",
    "this behavior is easy to understand as  velocity - sorting , \" since faster material _ ejected contemporaneously _ with slower material will travel farther from the source .      an episodic stellar wind interacting with ambient gas through bow shock prompt entrainment could produce a _",
    "p - v _ diagram with several hubble wedges . in an episodic flow with a significantly varying mass - ejection rate ,",
    "outflowing gas would show a hubble - like velocity distribution for each mass - ejection episode , with the tip of each hubble wedge at a source offset corresponding to a bow - shock apex in the outflow map .",
    "since not all outbursts from an episodic source necessarily have the same angle with respect to the plane of the sky or accelerate the ambient gas to the same maximum velocity , each `` hubble wedge '' will not necessarily have the same maximum radial velocity , and the maximum velocity can change over time .    if a wind either has had only a single outburst or is dominated by one particularly strong outburst , a molecular outflow with a _",
    "single _ hubble velocity law can result ( see figure 2 ) .",
    "outflow evolution may also be responsible for creating a single hubble law .",
    "a molecular outflow from an episodic wind which had its last outburst ( or has not had an outburst in a considerable amount of time ) will be subject to the same kind of velocity - sorting mentioned above , and would produce a single hubble law in its _ p - v _ diagram .",
    "taken together , @xmath0 relations with @xmath30 and _ p - v _ relations showing multiple hubble wedges provide very strong evidence that  episodicity \" is a key feature of molecular outflows from young stars .",
    "it is tempting to try to reconstruct the outburst history of an episodic outflow by combining information from @xmath0 and _ p - v _ diagrams . in very simple cases , where two or three outbursts dominate the flow , this is possible ( e.g. , gueth , guilloteau , & bachiller 1996 ; narayanan & walker 1996 ) . in perhaps more typical cases though , where important bursts are separated by much less than the dynamical time scale for each burst , modeling is considerably more complicated in that uniqueness problems plague the search for solutions .",
    "we expect though , that if an _ a priori _ model of the underlying jet can be made ( based on either the molecular line map or other data ) , the consistency of this model with both the @xmath0 and _ p - v _ relations can be tested .",
    "almost since the day they were discovered , molecular outflows have been thought of as a possible ( re-)supplier of the turbulent energy needed to support molecular clouds against rapid gravitational collapse ( e.g. norman & silk 1980 and citations thereto ) .",
    "it has also been suggested that a molecular outflow may be able to disrupt its host core ( e.g , tafalla & myers 1998 ) , and/or that a combination of outflows may `` churn '' ( bally et al .",
    "1999 ) or disrupt ( knee & sandell 2000 ) a whole molecular cloud complex .",
    "now , dozens of observational papers , only some of which are mentioned above , have pointed to the  episodic \" nature of young stellar outflows .",
    "simply put , observers are now _ sure _ that these outflows originate from a bursty source",
    ". the outflow source may also be precessing and/or moving through the ism , and each of its bursts may accelerate a _",
    "different _ amount of ambient matter to a _",
    "different _ velocity . in this _ letter _",
    ", we have shown that the episodic nature of outflows causes their _ m - v _ and _ p - v _ relations to be very different from those predicted by any existing analytic model .    in order to correctly asses the energetic role of outflows in a magnetized ism , it is now necessary to account for the time history of their interaction with their surroundings .",
    "the episodic nature of outflows does not affect the _ total _ momentum injected in the ism by outflows , and thus it does not matter in most of the ism feedback theories ( e.g. , norman & silk 1980 , and citations thereto ) . on the other hand , outflow episodicity may change the effective length and time scales on which the momentum is injected , which is important for a magnetized ism with mhd turbulence ( e.g. , padoan & nordlund 1999 , and references therein ) .",
    "we offer this _",
    "letter _ as a motivation for would - be modelers .",
    "any detailed realistic model of a molecular outflow must include its episodic nature .",
