    "the pm and pe property may be characterized independently of @xmath3 , as follows . defining @xmath10 the quadratic , cubic and 0-dimensional invariants @xmath11 and @xmath12 of the weyl tensor  @xcite can be written as @xcite @xmath13 where the solutions @xmath14 of @xmath15 are the non - zero eigenvalues of @xmath16 for any @xmath3 .",

    "this is particularly true for the vacuum solutions ( with or without @xmath23 term ) , where no pm solutions are known at all .",

    "this motivates the attempt to construct purely magnetic perfect fluid models with @xmath33 in the above . a solution to ( [ fieldeq0 ] ) of this kind",
    "will then be called a pmpf .",
    "the only known perfect fluid which is purely magnetic in a certain region of spacetime , but which is not a pmpf in the above sense ( @xmath34 ) , is the lozanovoski - mcintosh metric @xcite .",
    "the present study is restricted to pmpf models , with the exception of section 4.4 .",

    "an exhaustive classification of pmpf s has by now been obtained , essentially due to two results .",
    "firstly , it was shown most recently  @xcite that petrov type d pmpf s are necessarily lrs class i or iii , whereas secondly the most general metric forms   as a new time - variable @xmath35 instead of @xmath36 ; the result is @xmath37 @xmath38 ^ 2+e^{2b}(dy^2+dz^2)\\right)$ ] , where @xmath39 and @xmath40 are constants and @xmath41 equals -1 , 0 or 1 , @xmath42 and @xmath43 . ] for each of these classes were derived in @xcite .",
    "four systematic studies historically precede these results : on the one hand lrs space - times in general were reinvestigated in @xcite by two different methods , hereby also briefly discussing the purely magnetic case ; on the other hand shear - free  @xcite , resp .",
    "non - rotating  @xcite pmpf s of petrov type d were shown to be lrs class i , resp .",
    "finally the following three distinct pmpf solutions are particular cases of the general lrs cases above : the @xmath44 collins - stewart space - time  @xcite and lozanovski - aarons metric  @xcite , both lrs class iii , and the lrs class i rigidly rotating axistationary model with circular motion of @xcite . the last example was found within a study ( regardless of the petrov type ) of axistationary perfect fluids , which concentrated mostly on the pmpf subclass .",
    "concretely , it was shown that axistationary pmpf s with circular motion necessarily have non - vanishing vorticity and spatial-3 gradient of the matter density , and that such spacetimes are lrs class i. + no algebraically general pmpf s have been found yet , although they might be of relevance for cosmological modelling .",
    "the pmpf subclass of irrotational dust spacetimes consists of ` silent ' universe models @xcite and was investigated in @xcite , but the appearance of chains of severe integrability conditions ( analogously as for the widely studied purely electric subclass in the petrov type i case  @xcite ) made the authors conjecture that this subclass might be empty .",
    "this was recently proved in @xcite for the case of dust , regardless of petrov type and cosmological constant .",
    "the present study continues this line of investigation . whereas evidence is provided that the class of pm rotating dust must be severely restricted as well , we present as a main result a first example of an algebraically general pmpf solution , which is both non - rotating and non - accelerating .",
    "up to a constant rescaling , this solution is shown to be the unique pmpf with these properties .",
    "moreover it is spatially homogeneous with degenerate shear tensor and , just as the related lrs class iii models of @xcite , it turns out to satisfy the energy conditions in an open subset of spacetime .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows . in section 2",
    "we set up the basic variables and equations for pmpf s , in a mixed 1 + 3 covariant / orthonormal tetrad approach . after pointing out why solution families of the pm rotating dust class should be rather poor in number",
    ", the subclasses of petrov type d and of vanishing spatial 3-gradient of the energy density are shown to be empty in section 3 .",
    "section 4 provides a characterization of the new metric , discusses its mathematical and physical features and situates it within the broader context of @xcite .",
    "we end with a conclusion and discussion in section 5 .",
