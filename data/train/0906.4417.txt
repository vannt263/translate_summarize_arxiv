    "cold atomic gases give a possibility to address collective atomic quantum states , where an elementary atomic excitation is coherently distributed among a large number of individual atoms .",
    "such systems have been considered in the context of quantum information @xcite , coherence protection @xcite , individual photon manipulations @xcite etc . for cold rydberg gases that have large dipole moments ,",
    "one has to allow for the effects associated with strong dipole - dipole  interaction among atoms @xcite-@xcite .",
    "considering the regime typical of current experimental setting , one usually takes into account the regular static dipole - dipole interaction @xmath0 among pairs of the atoms , which from the view point of quantum electrodynamics is a result of exchange by a virtual strongly off - resonant vacuum photon with a typical wavelength of the order of interatomic distance @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "this sort of interatomic coupling can be attributed neither to the short range interaction , nor to the long range ones , since the integral @xmath2 corresponding to the average binary interaction logarithmically diverges at both upper and lower limits .",
    "this circumstance results in a number of interesting dynamic phenomena @xcite , such as incomplete decay of a single atom population at the limit of long times , which resembles the anderson localization effect . in the same time , for the description one can not make use of the continuous media model and the mean field approximation , which are applicable only for the long range interactions .    among experiments with rydberg atoms , there are some @xcite that have been done in the regime where the size of a cloud of cold rydberg atoms is of the order or larger than the wavelength of the resonant dipole active transition . in such conditions ,",
    "the role of the radiation trapping , super - radiance @xcite , and the dynamic long - range dipole - dipole interactions ( @xmath3 ) is dominant , and the continuous media model becomes applicable .",
    "in other words quantum states of the atomic ensemble and that of the resonant radiation field get strongly entangled , whereas the eigenstates of the compound atoms+field system correspond to atomic states dressed in the resonant radiation field . driven by the curiosity we will now consider the atomic population dynamics in the simplest version of such a process .",
    "we make use of the mean - field approximation , and concentrate on an exactly soluble case of an infinite uniform continuous two - level media , ignoring the contribution of the static dipole - dipole interaction not conforming the requirements of the mean field model .",
    "we consider a static continuous media corresponding to the gas of @xmath4 two - level particles with the transition frequency @xmath5 and polarization @xmath6 along @xmath7-direction that are uniformly scattered in space at fixed positions .",
    "since the static dipole - dipole interaction between the atoms can be viewed as a process intermediated by virtual photon exchange , the effective hamiltonian that governs the evolution of the combined system in the rotating wave approximation , is @xmath8 where @xmath9 are the collective operators of the exciton @xmath10 , @xmath11 is the coupling and @xmath12 is the angle between the direction of the polarization @xmath6 and the normal to  the photon polarization plane .",
    "the coupling strength @xmath13 is a product of the photon vacuum field strength @xmath14  in a volume @xmath15 and the collective atomic dipole moment @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the atomic transition dipole moment , @xmath18 is the speed of light , and @xmath19 .",
    "we assume that at time @xmath20 , all but one particles are in the ground state .",
    "the consideration is equally applicable to the case where a group of particles locating in a volume with a typical size @xmath21 , small as compared to the resonant transition wavelength @xmath22 , is in a coherent superposition of the individual excited states , such that the total number of excitations is one . in order to take advantage of the uniform distribution , we take states@xmath23 corresponding to a given wavevector @xmath10 as the basis set in the collective hilbert space . here",
    "@xmath24 denotes the vacuum where all particles are in the ground state , and the condition that the average distance @xmath25 among the neighboring particles corresponding to the density @xmath26 is much shorter than the transition wavelength @xmath27 is implicit .    each state , ( [ a ] ) , interacts only with the photon of the same wavevector , and the amplitudes @xmath28 and @xmath29 of the particle+field compound state @xmath30 ( where the second quantum number corresponds to photons ) satisfy the schrdinger equation@xmath31 where dirac delta function @xmath32 stands for the initial condition corresponding to the excitation location in the origin , that is at the point @xmath33 .",

    "long range dipole - dipole interaction corresponds to the exchange by photons close to the resonance domain @xmath42 . in this domain ,",
    "the integrands ( [ da])-([db ] ) have two branching points @xmath43 in the complex plane of @xmath39 where @xmath44 assumes zero value . therefore the contribution of the long range interaction is given by an integral along a contour presented in figure  [ contour ]    circumventing these points , which can be expressed in terms of the bessel functions @xmath45 . in order to shorten the notations we employ the units where @xmath46 henceforth . in the limit @xmath47 of a coupling , which is weak as compared to the energy of atomic transition quantum , the integration over @xmath48 yields@xmath49 up to terms of higher orders in @xmath50 . here",
    "@xmath51  is the heaviside-@xmath52 functions , while @xmath53 and @xmath54 stand for @xmath55 and @xmath56 , respectively .",
    "integration over the solid angle in ( [ ea])-([eb ] ) has to be done numerically in the polar coordinates associated either with the direction of the polarization @xmath6 ( angles @xmath12 and @xmath57 ) or with the direction of the radius vector @xmath58 ( angles @xmath52 and @xmath59 ) as shown in figure  [ fig.1 ] .",
    "it has to be performed over the intervals @xmath60 and @xmath61 , respectively .",
    "angles @xmath12 and @xmath52 do not belong to a same reference frame and therefore one of these angles has to be expressed in the frame , to which belongs the other one .",
    "for the purpose , one can make use of the relations@xmath62 that follow from the invariance of the scalar product @xmath63 .",
    "alternatively one may employ the cylindrical set of coordinates @xmath64 , @xmath65 , and @xmath57 , associated with the direction of the polarization @xmath6 .",
    "we note that there are two size scales in the problem : the wavelength @xmath66 ( that is @xmath67 in the dimensional units ) and a distance @xmath68 ( that is @xmath69 in the dimensional units ) at which the light propagates during the rabi period at resonance . population distribution at these scales have to be analyzed separately .",
    "let us first consider the wavelength scale . for short times @xmath70",
    ", the bessel function can be cast in taylor series and the first order yields @xmath71 for the amplitude in ( [ eb ] ) . with the help of equation ( [ fa ] )",
    "one can calculate the integral exactly and find@xmath72 @xmath73which results in the population @xmath74 quadratically increasing in time , shown in figure  [ fig2 ] .",
    "note , that at long distances the probability corresponding to ( [ h ] ) decreases as @xmath75 , which means that the integral of the population over the volume logarithmically diverges at the upper limit being truncated just at the radius @xmath76 . in other words ,",
    "some part of the excitation is getting transferred by the resonant photons at a large distance @xmath77 .",
    "the distribution of figure  [ fig2 ] persists as long as @xmath78 remains a small number .",
    "its structure can be easily understood when one notice that according to the second equation ( [ c ] ) , the amplitudes of emitted photons are located in the domain of resonance where the the detunings @xmath79 are small .",
    "these photons , after being emitted , result in discarding of the corresponding spacial harmonics from the initial @xmath80-like excitation profile @xmath81 containing all harmonics with equal amplitudes .",
    "but such a discarding implies establishing of the population distribution given by the discarded harmonics taken with the opposite signs . as the result",
    ", the sum of the @xmath80-like distribution and  the latter distributions of @xmath81 no longer contains harmonics strongly coupled to the cooperative resonant radiation . in course",
    "the of time the harmonics with higher detuning are getting involved in the process , and the net population of figure  [ fig2 ] increases . for an initial distribution of a small but finite size @xmath21 ,",
    "the relative amount of this population is given by the ratio of the length @xmath82 of the @xmath39-interval of emitted photons and the length @xmath83 of the @xmath39-interval occupied by the initial distribution .",
    "in course of time @xmath84 , the distribution @xmath74 in the domain @xmath85 gets modified , as shown in figure  [ fig3a ] .",
    "one can find an analytic expression for the asymptotic form of @xmath86 at @xmath87 .",
    "the main contribution to the integral ( [ eb ] ) comes from the domain of small @xmath88 , that results from the exchange by the resonant photons with @xmath10 almost orthogonal to @xmath58 .",
    "integration over @xmath38 can be carried out in the reference system associated with @xmath58 with the allowance for the approximate relation @xmath89 and yields@xmath90 one sees that the population distribution decreases with the radius as @xmath91 and has an angular dependence @xmath92 @xmath93 shown in figure  [ fig5 ] .    ) of the angular part of the population distribution on time @xmath94 . in the inlet",
    "we show the contour plot of the population distribution calculated with the assymptotic formula for @xmath95.,width=269,height=165 ]    angular shrinking of the distribution in the course of time can be understood if we note that the photons emitted in the direction close to that of the particles polarization are weekly coupled due to the smallness of the projection of the electric strength vector to the particle dipole moment .",
    "therefore the typical evolution time for their interaction with the atomic cloud is longer .     for two values of the parameter @xmath96 ( a ) and",
    "@xmath97 ( b ) resulting from the numerical integration of equation ( [ eb]).,width=244,height=257 ]",
    "what happens at the large scale with typical distances @xmath98 ?",
    "the results of numerical integration of ( [ eb ] ) are shown in figure  [ fig3 ] for two different times .",
    "one sees rather irregular structures to some extend resembling the time dependence of fractional revivals @xcite , which results from the interference of different spacial harmonics with the wavevectors close to unity .",
    "one should note that this regime implies that the size of the system is larger or comparable with the distance @xmath98 .",
    "however , this distance can be relatively large , exceeding the typical size of the atomic cloud .    ) for an atomic cloud of a finite size @xmath99 and for the atomic density profile @xmath100.,width=212,height=164 ]    in such a situation , instead of considering the population distribution at distances @xmath101 , one may calculate the frequency spectrum of photons detected at a distance much larger as compared to the typical size of the atomic cloud .",
    "the calculations relevant to the case of large distances rely on the fourier transformed ( [ ba ] ) and ( [ bb ] ) @xmath102 while the resulting amplitude@xmath103 to have a photon with the wavevector @xmath10 at an angle @xmath12 to the direction of the polarization has to be averaged over an interval around @xmath104 of a width @xmath105 corresponding to the uncertainty resulting from the finite size @xmath106 of the system .",
    "the averaging has to be performed with a weight function @xmath107 given by the fourier transformed particle density profile@xmath108 for an analytic profile @xmath107 this yields the spectral intensity@xmath109 where the frequency deviation from the resonance @xmath110 is scaled by the interaction .",
    "in figure  [ rad ] we present the probability of the photon detection as a function of frequency calculated for the particle density distribution @xmath111 with @xmath112 .",
    "this distribution stands as a physical approximation to the delta function spatial distribution of excited atoms we have assumed throughout the derivation .",
    "one sees , that though the cooperative coupling between the particles and the electromagnetic field does not govern the population distribution @xmath74 over the ensemble of two - level particles of a finite size @xmath113 , it manifests itself in the spectrum of emitted photons that can be registered at distances large as compared to @xmath106 .    .",
    "the population distribution for small times and for long times are shown by the contour plots in the upper and the lower parts inside the circle representing the atomic cloud . in 3d",
    "the distribution has cylindrical symmetry around the polarization axis @xmath6 .",
    "the process is associated with the cooperative emission of photons , and the typical scale of the spectrum of these photons is of the order of @xmath50.,width=255,height=184 ]",
    "we conclude by presenting the overall picture of the process shown in figure  [ overall ] .",
    "an atomic cloud , initially in the ground state , has been excited in a small domain close to the center .",
    "in course of time the excitations gets redistributed over all the volume of the cloud due to the long range dipole - dipole interaction .",
    "the typical rate of the process corresponds to the @xmath114 . for short times , the population distribution is given by ( [ h ] ) and for @xmath115 it takes the asymptotic form ( [ i ] ) .",
    "the process is associated with the cooperative spontaneous emission of photons .",
    "the typical scale corresponding to the spectrum of emitted photons is given by the interaction strength @xmath116 , and at a large distance from the atomic cloud it has a two - peak structure of equation ( [ l ] ) . as a general conclusion",
    ", one may state that the presence of two essentially different energy scales ( @xmath50 and @xmath117 ) can be considered as typical manifestation of collective atomic phenomena .",
    "note that fractional revivals discussed by i. sh .",

    "a * 139 * 449 ] are typical of time evolution of quantum systems with discrete spectra that have a small quadratic inequidistance . here",
