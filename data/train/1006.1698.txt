    "the spatial distribution of stellar population properties in early - type galaxies are the chemodynamical fossil imprints of galaxy formation and evolution mechanisms .",
    "the efficiency of different physical processes is expected to vary with radius leaving measurable changes at different galactocentric radii .",
    "thereby , providing unique constraints on the galaxy formation mechanisms predicted by competing scenarios .    in the past years an increasing number of observational studies have focused their effort in probing stellar populations beyond the galactic cores ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "however , these previous studies lack to consider low - mass , low - luminosity galaxies because the intrinsic low surface brightness of these objects makes the measurement of their properties at large galactocentric radii observationally challenging .",
    "the aim of this paper is to provide a clear picture of the stellar population properties at large radii , and their relationship to galaxy structural parameters over a comprehensive galaxy mass range .    in the classical models of monolithic collapse ( @xcite ;",
    "@xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , early - type galaxies form during dissipational infall of cooling gas .",
    "massive galaxies are predicted to form in a short and intense burst of star formation , whereas dwarf galaxies experience more extended and intermittent star formation ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the gas flowing to the centre of the galaxy is chemically enriched by evolving stars , and contributes as metal - rich fuel for star formation .",
    "thus , a negative radial metallicity gradient is established .",
    "metallicity - dependent gas cooling and a time - delay in the occurrence of galactic winds ( i.e. , onsets that vary with the local escape velocity ) can cooperate in steepening any metallicity gradients ( @xcite ; @xcite ) . a strong correlation between metallicity gradient and galaxy mass is expected ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "[ @xmath0/fe ] abundance gradients are suggested to be a consequence of interplay between local differences in the star formation timescale and gas flows ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .    in the hierarchical merging scenario ( e.g. , @xcite ;",
    "@xcite ; @xcite ) , early - type galaxies form by merging events . the properties of merger remnants are related to the progenitors mass ratio , amount of gas content and the geometry of the collision ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "mergers are expected to flatten any ambient gradients ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "central bursts of star formation induced by the merger can partially regenerate the metallicity gradients and create age gradients ( e.g. , @xcite ) . a weak relation between mass and metallicity gradients",
    "is expected ( @xcite ) .",
    "positive or negative [ @xmath0/fe ] gradients can form depending on the chemical enrichment of the pristine gas and the duration of the burst ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "recent models include energy feedback due to active galactic nuclei ( agn ) to stop the star formation in massive galaxies , thus producing a mass - dependent star formation history ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .    here",
    "we further consolidate the findings of @xcite ( hereafter paper i ) on kinematic and photometric properties at large galactocentric radii of 14 low - mass early - type galaxies in the virgo and fornax clusters .",
    "we study the spatial distribution of luminosity@xmath6weighted age , total metallicity [ z / h ] and @xmath0-element abundance ratio [ @xmath0/fe ] of out to @xmath7 by using nearly all of the lick / ids indices .",
    "the comparison of these line - strength indices with single stellar population models ( ssps ) is found to be successful ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) in breaking the well known age / metallicity degeneracy ( @xcite ) .",
    "we extended our study to a broad galactic mass range , introducing a novel literature compilation of stellar population properties out to one effective radius for a sample of 37 early - type galaxies of higher mass .",
    "we compare properties measured at different galactocentric radii encompassing different percentages of the total stellar mass .",
    "the implications for mass scaling relations are considered . by comparing our results to model predictions",
    "we constrain the mechanisms for the formation and evolution of early - type galaxies .",
    "this paper is organised as follows . in section  2",
    ", we describe the data sample . in section  3",
    ", we describe our spectroscopic observations and data reduction . in section  4 , we present the stellar population analysis . in section  5 , we introduce the radial profiles for the 14 low - mass galaxies . in section  6 , we describe the stellar population properties of the entire galaxy sample . in section  7",
    ", we discuss our results in the context of predictions from competing galaxy formation scenarios .",
    "section  8 presents a summary of our findings .",
    "our sample consists of 14 low - mass early - type galaxies in the virgo and fornax clusters .",
    "the six galaxies in the fornax cluster are chosen from the catalogue of @xcite , while the eight galaxies in the virgo cluster are from the catalogue of @xcite .",
    "galaxies of low - mass are selected on the basis on their central stellar velocity dispersion @xmath8 and the absolute @xmath9-band total magnitude @xmath10 , both of which are known to be independent proxies of galaxy mass .",
    "the sample uniformly covers the range @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "this translates to a dynamical mass range of about @xmath13 , using the relation @xmath14m@xmath15 where @xmath16 is the effective radius in parsecs ( @xcite ) .",
