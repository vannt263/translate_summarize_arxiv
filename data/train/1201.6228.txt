    ".    sometimes one may want to organize a set of agents for a specific purpose .",
    "one way to do this is to put a hyperstructure on it organizing the agents to fulfill a given goal .",
    "this applies to both concrete physical and abstract situations .",
    "an example of this is the procedure whereby we organize molecules ( or abstract topological bonds ) into rings , @xmath8-rings,@xmath3 , @xmath6-rings representing new topological structures .    in many cases it is natural to view the bonds as geometric or topological spaces .",
    "for example if a surface @xmath13 has three circles as boundary components , see figure [ fig : surfaces ] , @xmath68 , we may say that @xmath13 is a geometric bond of the circles .",
    "clearly there may be many .",
    "this is in analogy with chemical bonds .",
    "furthermore , if we have a manifold @xmath69 such that its boundary is @xmath70 see figure [ fig : boundary ] , we may say that @xmath69 is a bond of @xmath71 .",
    "even more general is the following situation : given a topological space of some kind @xmath10 and let @xmath72 be subspaces of @xmath10 .",
    "then we say that @xmath10 is a bond of @xmath72 , see figure [ fig : slices ] , thinking of @xmath72 as `` the boundary '' of @xmath10 .    in a hyperstructure of",
    "higher order we may let @xmath10 represent a top level bond , then the @xmath73 s will represent bonds of other spaces : @xmath74 etc .",
    ", see figure [ fig : towers ] .",
    "this slightly extends the pictures of and represent what we could call a _ geometric hyperstructure_. this concept relates to topological quantum field theory and will be studied in a separate paper , see section [ sec : multi ] for some further remarks .",
    "hyperstructures and higher order bonds may be viewed as a huge extension of cobordisms ( manifolds with boundary ) and chemicals bonds and interlockings .",
    "furthermore , the whole scheme of thinking may be applied to interactions and ways of connecting and interlocking people , groups of people , social and economic systems and organizations , organisms , genes , data , etc .",
    "for some of these aspects , see .    by describing all such types of systems by means of hyperstructures",

    "this may be useful to obtain actions like geometrical and physical fusion of objects in various situations similar to the `` political / sociological '' metaphor .",
    "after all we `` make things '' through a hyperstructure principle as in modern engineering .",
    "this may be so since it is the way nature works through evolution , and after all we are ourselves products of such a process .",
    "we have here discussed the organization of many - body systems or general systems of collections of objects . the systems may be finite , infinite or even uncountable .",
    "we have advocated hyperstructures as the guiding organizational principle . in this section",
    "we will discuss in more detail possible organization of the states of the system through level connections .",
    "we use the terminology in section [ sec : hyper ] .",
    "when we put a hyperstructure on a situation in order to obtain a certain goal or action often a dynamics is required on @xmath135 : @xmath248 which essentially changes the states .    in order to do this",
    "it is advantageous to be able to have as rich structures as possible as states : sets , spaces ( manifolds ) , algebras , ( higher ) vector spaces , ( higher ) categories , etc .",
    "for this reason and in order to cover as many interactions as possible we introduce the following extension .    instead of letting the states ( @xmath61 ) in @xmath135 take values in @xmath20 we extend this to a family of prescribed _ hyperstructures of states _ :",
    "@xmath249 where @xmath250 is a hyperstructure such that : @xmath251 we want these level state structures to be connected in some way .",
    "therefore we require that @xmath252 is organized into a hyperstructure itself with @xmath253 as the levels  or actually sets of bonds of states , with @xmath254 being the top level ( dual to @xmath135 itself ) .",
    "we furthermore assume that we have level connecting assignments or boundary maps @xmath255 which we will for short write as :    ( s0 ) at ( 0,0)@xmath254 ; ( s1 ) at ( 1.5,0)@xmath256 ; ( sdots ) at ( 3,0)@xmath212 ; ( sn ) at ( 4.5,0)@xmath257 . ;    ( sn )  node@xmath258 ( sdots ) ;    ( sdots )  node@xmath259 ( s1 ) ;    ( s1 )  node@xmath260 ( s0 ) ;    often the order of the hyperstructure will decrease moving from the bottom to the top  `` integrating away complexity '' .",
    "the @xmath255 s may be of assignment ( functional ) or relational type .",
    "this shows how to form hyperstructures of hyperstructures . in such cases",
    "one may actually use existing hyperstructures to form bonds and states in new hyperstructures .",
    "the assignment of a state to a bond ( or collection of bonds ) is a kind of representation : @xmath261 such that if @xmath262 then @xmath263 in simplified notation ( @xmath264 meaning a family or subset of objects ) .",
    "let us illustrate this by an example .",
    "this is basically a version of example d ) in section [ sec : hyper ] and studied in in connection with genomic structure .",
    "@xmath135 is given by sets @xmath265 meaning that there exist maps @xmath266 to each @xmath267 we assign a state space @xmath29 a manifold ( possibly ) .",
    "then the state hyperstructure reduces to the composition of ( smooth ) mappings : @xmath268    in order to influence global states from local actions it is a reasonable and general procedure to put a hyperstructure on the systems with a multilevel state structure given by another hyperstructure @xmath252 with level relations as described :    ( s0 ) at ( 0,0)@xmath254 ; ( s1 ) at ( 1.5,0)@xmath256 ; ( sdots ) at ( 3,0)@xmath212 ; ( sn ) at ( 4.5,0)@xmath257 . ;    ( sn )  ( sdots ) ;    ( sdots )  ( s1 ) ;    ( s1 )  ( s0 ) ;    the idea is then to act on @xmath257 by introducing a suitable dynamics and let the actions propagate through the hyperstructure to the global level .",
    "this is similar to social systems and may be called the `` democratic method of action '' .",
    "it is especially useful if the level relations are functional assignments : @xmath269 for example if the @xmath250 s are categories of some kind , the arrows would represent functors and if the @xmath250 s are spaces , the arrows represent mappings .",
    "let us specify the mappings @xmath270 by @xmath271 where @xmath272 just means a family or subsets of objects , and requiring assignments ( mappings ) :    ( prod ) at ( 0,0)@xmath273 ; ( omega ) at ( 3,0)@xmath274 ; ( elementinprod ) at ( 0,-0.5 ) ; ( elementinomega ) at ( 3,-0.5 ) ; ( sn - i+1 ) at ( 0,-1)@xmath275 ; ( sn - i ) at ( 3,-1)@xmath276 ;    ( prod )  node[above , midway , font=]@xmath277 ( omega ) ;    ( sn - i+1 ) ",
    "node[above , midway , font=]@xmath278 ( sn - i ) ;    the @xmath279 s are then state level connectors . if the @xmath250 s have a tensor product we will often require    ( omega ) at ( 0,0)@xmath280 ; ( omegab ) at ( 3,0)@xmath274 ; at ( 0.15,-0.5 ) ; at ( 0.15,-1)@xmath281 ;    ( omega )  node[above , midway , font=]@xmath277 ( omegab ) ;    more schematically this may be described as : @xmath282 for bonds , and for states : @xmath283 this is an extension of the framework for extended topological quantum field theories ( see ) where one considers manifolds with general boundaries and corners @xmath284 bound by generalized cobordisms .    at the state level",
    "one assigns to these manifolds higher order algebraic structures such as a version @xmath285-vector spaces ( @xmath286 ) or @xmath285-algebras as follows @xcite : @xmath287 where levels of states are connected via geometrically induced pairings : @xmath288 for all @xmath285 . @xmath289 being the scalars @xmath290 in the case of complex vector spaces .",
    "in this sense we can control and regulate the global state from the lowest level which is clearly a desirable thing in systems of all kinds .",
    "this is useful in the following situation .",
    "let @xmath291 be a desired action or task which may be `` un - managable '' in a given system or context .",
    "furthermore , let @xmath292 be a collection of `` managable '' actions in the system",
    ".    put @xmath293 and design a hyperstructure @xmath135 ( like a society or factory ) where then @xmath291 appears as @xmath294  the top level bond of the hyperstructure @xmath135 .",
    "hence @xmath135 will act as a propagator from \\{managable actions } to \\{desired actions } by dynamically regulating the states of @xmath135 as described .",
    "this procedure applies to general systems and in the sense of one may say that hyperstructures are `` tools for thought '' and creation of novelty .",
    "in general systems one may often want to change the global state in a desired way and it may be difficult since it would require large resources ( `` high energy '' ) .",
    "but via a hyperstructure it may be possible introducing managable local actions and change of states which may require small resources ( `` low energy '' ) , in other words small actions are being organized into large actions via @xmath135 .",
    "this is similar to changing the action of a society or organization by influencing individuals .",
    "if one wants to join two opposing societies ( or nations ) into one , it may take less resources to act on individuals to obtain the global effect .",
    "the photosynthesis works along the same lines  collecting , organizing and amplifying energy .",
    "it seems like an interesting idea to suggest the use of hyperstructures in order to facilitate fusion of various types of systems , for example `` particles '' in biology , chemistry and physics .",
    "even nuclear fusion may profit from this perspective .",
    "the hyperstructure in question may be introduced on the system itself or surrounding space and forces .",
    "binding structures and hyperstructures as we have described them are basically organizing principles of collections of objects .",
    "they apply to all kinds of collections and general systems , and as organizing principles they may be particularly interesting in physical matter ( condensed matter ) of atoms , moleclues , etc .",
    "r.  laughlin has advocated the importance of organizing principles in condensed matter physics in understanding for example superconductivity , the quantum hall effect , phonons , topological insulators etc . see .",
    "he suggests that the very precise measurements made of important physical constants in these situations come from underlying organizing principles of matter .",
    "our binding- and hyperstructures are organizing principles that when introduced to physical matter should lead to new emergent properties .",
    "it is like in our example [ ex : links ] .",
    "if we are given a random tangle of links , a new and non - trivial geometric order emerges when we put a higher order brunnian structure on the collection of links .",
    "+ in one way it is analogous to logical systems , where organized statements are more likely to be decidable than random ones .",
    "similarly in biology : language , memory , spatial recognition , etc.are related to similar organizing principles .",
    "entangled states are studied in quantum mechanics and higher order versions are suggested .",
    "zeilinger ( ghz ) states are analogous to borromean and brunnian rings , see . from our previous discussion",
    "we are naturally led to suggest higher order entangled states organized by a hyperstructure @xmath135 using the transfer principle .",
    "could  such  a  process lead  to  collections  of  particles  forming global / macroscopic quantum states ?",
    "could also an @xmath135-structure act as a kind of ( geometric ) protectorate of a desired quantum state from thermodynamic disturbances ( in high temperature superconducitivity for example ) ?",
    "* putting a binding- or hyperstructure on a collection of objects",
    ". then collections of bound structures will appear , and they may have interesting emergent properties .",
    "for example with respect to precise measurements of involved constants of nature .",
    "+ * putting a binding- or hyperstructure on the ambient space ( space - time ) of a collection for example using various fields etc .",
    "this will introduce a structure on the collection and may result in bindings and fusion of particles and objects , or splitting ( fission ) , stabilizing them into new patterns with new emergent properties .",
    "+    in other words space , fields and reactors may all be organized by binding principles .",
    "we suggest that putting a binding- or hyperstructure on a collection , situation or system is a very fundamental and useful organizing principle .",
