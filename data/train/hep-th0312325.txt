    ".5 true cmthe stability of the proton constituting the nucleus of the lightest and most abundant element , the hydrogen atom , has been the topic of extensive theoretical and experimental investigations in the last three decades [ 1 ] .",
    "however , not much attention has been paid to the stability of its partner , the electron .",
    "experiments give a lower bound of @xmath0 years for its life - time [ 2 ] which is less than that of the proton by several orders of magnitude .",
    "just as proton would decay , among other particles , to a positron and a neutral pion if the constraint imposed by baryon number conservation is removed , so would the electron decay into a photon and a neutrino ( also to a neutrino and neutrino - antineutrino pair ) if electric charge conservation is not respected .",
    "such decay of the electron in closed shells of atoms would cause vacancy giving rise to emission of x - rays and auger electrons .",
    "der mateosian and goldhaber looked for such emission from an iodine atom located in a nai(t1 ) crystal and deduced a lower limit of @xmath5 years on the electron life time .",
    "this limit has been revised to @xmath1 years for @xmath6 by moe and reines [ 3 ] by reducing the detector background .",
    "the most recent limit given by the particle data group [ 2 ] is @xmath7 yrs .",
    "the simplest model which would give rise to @xmath6 decay is one where the electron is regarded as the first excited state and the neutrino as the ground state of a fundamental spin 1/2 particle bound to a scalar particle by a super strong force . since electric charge is not to be conserved , and therefore not a good quantum number , the fundamental particles of the model should not possess electric charge .",
    "consequently the photon can not couple to them directly .",
    "it can do so through its constituents if it too is regarded as a composite particle .",
    "it may be recalled in this connection that long ago fermi and yang [ 4 ] constructed a model for the composite pion and eta particles according to which @xmath8 where @xmath9 and @xmath10 are isotopic spin matrices .",
    "the pion field @xmath11 is a vector in isospin or su(2 ) space ; the eta @xmath12 the nucleon ( n ) are scalar and spinors respectively in this space . in terms",
    "isospin up ( p ) , isospin down",
    "( n ) , the pion field as defined , in ( 1 ) can be written as @xmath13 in the case of photon we have to consider four dimensional space - time instead of two - dimensional isospin space and construct composite photon states from spin up and down states of fundamental spin 1/2 particles , which span a @xmath2 space .",
    "the dirac equation for these particles can be written in a symmetrical from using spinor representation of dirac matrices : @xmath14 here @xmath15 are pauli spin matrices and @xmath16 and @xmath17 are two - component spinors in terms of which the four component dirac field @xmath18 can be written as @xmath19 the spinors @xmath16 and @xmath17 span the @xmath20 space .",
    "analogous to the fermi - yang model for pion in isospin spin the photon can be represented in @xmath20 space as [ 5 ] @xmath21 where u and d stand for spin s up and down , @xmath22 and @xmath23 represent right and left circularly polarized photon , and @xmath24 and @xmath25 represent longitudinal and time - like photon fields .",
    "it will be noticed that the @xmath22 and @xmath23 are composed of fundamental fermions with parallel spins , @xmath24 and @xmath25 are composed of those with antiparallel spins .",
    "just as parallel electric currents attract and antiparallel ones repel , so would parallel spins attract and antiparallel spins repel [ 6 ] since the force is of gauge origin as in quantum electrodynamics .",
    "for this reason @xmath22 and @xmath23 will be bound states while @xmath24 and @xmath25 remain unbound .",
    "this explains why there only two physical photon states .",
    "since the electron and neutrino have spin 1/2 and our fundamental fermions have also have spin 1/2 , they former should be of composites of such a fermion and a fundamental spinless particle which is the counter part of the strange quark in su(3 ) space , electron and neutrino being counterparts of k - mesons . in order to accommodate the spinless field we have to extend the @xmath26 model to @xmath27 and use extended dirac equation : @xmath28 where @xmath29 and @xmath30(a=1,2, .... 8 ) are @xmath31 matrices .",
    "these two equations can be combined into a single one : @xmath32 where @xmath33 which can be derived from the lagrangian density @xmath34 the gauge interaction incorporated by replacing @xmath35 by @xmath36 and @xmath37 in ( 11 ) gives @xmath38 the interaction between the fundamental spin 1/2 and spin 0 fields relevant for the formation and decay of the electron and neutrino contained in this comes out to be @xmath39 where @xmath40  and   @xmath41 @xmath42 the electron and neutrino are first excited and ground states of the composite @xmath43          from which the life - time of the decay ( as in proton decay ) comes out to be @xmath44 taking @xmath45 and using the experimental lower bound for @xmath46 as @xmath47 gives the bound for @xmath48 as @xmath49    a lower bound for the mass of the fundamental particles can be obtained by making use of the formula @xmath50 used for atomic transitions since the electron and neutrino have been taken to be excited and ground state of spin 1/2 composites of fundamental spin 1/2and spin zero particles . in this formula , in that case , @xmath51 would equal the electron mass . for obtaining an estimate ,",
    "we take @xmath52 taking @xmath53 we get from ( 19 ) and ( 20 ) @xmath54 this gives the bound on m as @xmath55 combining ( 21 ) and ( 16 ) gives @xmath56    having considered electron decay we take up the problem of formation of electron through exchange of massive gauge bosons @xmath57 between @xmath58 . the second order dirac equation for this",
    "can be written @xmath59r(r)=0\\eqno{(24)}\\ ] ] where @xmath60 in terms of scaled variables @xmath61 this equation reads @xmath62r=0\\eqno{(26)}\\ ] ] since @xmath63 we can put @xmath64 in which case equation ( 24 ) becomes a second order dirac equation with coulomb potential whose solution for energy @xmath65 is @xmath66 where @xmath67 for the ground state which we have taken as the neutrino , we get from this @xmath68 i.e. , @xmath69 similarly for the electron , which we have taken to be the first excited state , we get @xmath70 if we take @xmath71 in wich case @xmath72 as assumed .",
    "it will be noted that while the mass and energy in eqn(23 ) are in the planck regime , those in eqn(25 ) are in the atomic regime .",
    "we thus see that a model where the electron and neutrino aare taken to be excited and ground states of a composite of a fundamental spin 1/2 fermion and a spin zero particle and the photon as a composite of the fundamental fermion antifermion pair , leads to relation between electron decay time , mass of the fundamental particles and also the mass of the gauge boson which provides the binding .",
    "the experimental bound for electron life time gives bounds for these masses .",
    "while the mass of the fundamental particles lies in the planckian regime , the mass of the gauge boson is the geometric mean of this mass and that of the electron .",
