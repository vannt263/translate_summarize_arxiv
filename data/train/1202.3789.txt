    "recently , much attention has been devoted to the study of a non  supersymmetric background ( first described by kachru , pearson and verlinde  @xcite ) obtained by adding @xmath0 anti ",
    "d3 branes to the klebanov  strassler solution  @xcite .",
    "this configuration is expected to be metastable and to describe a metastable vacuum of the dual @xmath1 supersymmetric gauge theory .    to confirm this",
    "it is important to consider the effects of the backreaction of the anti  branes and some preliminary steps were taken in  @xcite .",
    "the full first ",
    "order backreacted solution possibly describing these anti  branes was obtained in  @xcite , and the parameters of this anti  brane solution were schematically described in  @xcite and computed in  @xcite .",
    "analogous investigations have been performed in similar models in m ",
    "theory  @xcite and type iia string theory  @xcite .",
    "one of the key results of the analysis of  @xcite is that the first ",
    "order backreacted anti ",
    "d3 brane solution must have a certain singularity in the infrared . while there are no arguments that this singularity might be physical ,",
    "it has been suggested that it may be an artifact of perturbation theory , and may go away once full backreaction is taken into account  @xcite .",
    "indeed , as we will review below , the imaginary anti  self  dual ( iasd ) flux couples to the inverse warp factor , which is singular in perturbation theory but is expected to be regular at the non  linear level .    in this paper",
    "we will show that besides a singular iasd flux , the perturbative solution of  @xcite also contains a singular imaginary self  dual ( isd ) flux for which there is no argument that it will go away in the fully non  linear solution .",
    "this is supported by the construction of the fully backreacted solution for anti ",
    "d6 branes in a flux background  @xcite , where a singularity in the @xmath2-flux is unavoidable .",
    "this solution can be thought as a toy model for ours : by t - dualizing it three times along the d6 worldvolume one obtains a solution for anti ",
    "d3 branes in @xmath3 , which is an increasingly better approximation of the ks near  tip region as the @xmath4 radius grows or as the number of anti ",
    "d3 branes becomes ever more smaller than the number of fractional branes .",
    "hence , our result suggests that at least the singular isd flux , already visible in the linearized solution , will persist in the fully backreacted regime",
    ". it would be interesting to verify this by doing a fully backreacted calculation .",
    "the problem would then be whether this isd singularity can be resolved , and it has been hinted  @xcite that this might happen via brane polarization in the near  brane region  @xcite , much like in polchinski ",
    "strassler  @xcite . at first glance",
    "this seems unlikely , at least for smeared branes : the divergent isd flux we find does not seem to have the appropriate leg needed for brane polarization .",
    "we will consider the setup in which a stack of @xmath0 anti ",
    "d3 branes has been introduced in the warped deformed conifold .",
    "the dynamics of these anti  branes has been studied in the probe approximation in  @xcite . due to the warping and the five ",
    "form flux the anti ",
    "branes are attracted to the tip of the geometry ( namely , a three  sphere @xmath4 of radius @xmath5 , related to the confinement scale of the dual gauge theory ) and there they polarize ( by the myers effect  @xcite ) into an @xmath6brane wrapping a two ",
    ". this state will decay to a supersymmetric state , but for sufficiently small @xmath8 ( where @xmath9 denotes the units of rr 3-form flux over the @xmath4 ) the probe analysis shows that this process is non  perturbative and the leading channel is via bubble nucleation , thus providing a realization of a metastable supersymmetry  breaking state . from the gauge theory point of view , this setup would describe a dynamical supersymmetry breaking scenario in the klebanov  strassler theory .",
    "a description of such a state from the gauge theory side is lacking due to the strong coupling regime , thus motivating the search for a gravity dual .",
    "we now want to describe the effects of the backreaction of the stack of anti ",
    "d3 branes on the ambient geometry . in order to make the calculation tractable ,",
    "one can make two simplifying assumptions : i ) smearing the sources on the @xmath4 of the deformed conifold and ii ) working in perturbation theory around the supersymmetric background , at first ",
    "order in the parameter @xmath8 , which we suppose small in order to avoid perturbative decay to the supersymmetric vacuum .    in this approximation",
    "it is possible to find an analytic solution in terms of integrals for the metric and flux modes that perturb the klebanov ",
    "strassler background .",
    "this solution was obtained in  @xcite , building on the results of  @xcite . the anti ",
    "d3 solution was then obtained in  @xcite by imposing appropriate boundary conditions on the space of linearized deformations around the warped deformed conifold .",
    "let us briefly review the main conclusions of this analysis .",
    "+ * ir behavior . *",
    "the boundary conditions that we should impose in the near  brane region are those consistent with smeared anti  branes at the tip : singular warp factor and five  form flux , coming from the anti ",
    "d3 source with equal mass and charge , and regularity in all other modes .",
    "this requirement fixes half of the sixteen integration constants of the general linearized deformation around the conifold in terms of a physical quantity : the number @xmath0 of anti ",
    "d3 branes at the tip .",
    "in particular , this fixes the value of the mode ( indicated by @xmath10 in  @xcite ) that gives rise to the force felt by a probe d3 brane in the backreacted geometry @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the green s function at the linear order , defined in  .",
    "this agrees with the computation  la kklmmt  @xcite and is a nice check that the boundary conditions are the correct ones to describe anti  branes .",
    "once all those requirements are fulfilled , one finds that remnant nonzero perturbations to three ",
    "form fluxes near @xmath13 cause the energy density of such fluxes to diverge  @xcite .",
    "we stress that this is purely an infrared phenomenon , in the sense that the presence of the singularity is insensitive to the uv boundary conditions .",
    "the scope of this note is to dissect this singularity .",
    " strassler background is parametrized by eight scalars @xmath14 which take values in a scalar manifold @xmath15 and which satisfy a first  order system of ode s  @xcite .",
    "the space of linearized deformations around this solution , which preserve its @xmath16 symmetry , is described by a system of eight second  order euler ",
    "lagrange equations for the perturbation modes @xmath17 .",
    "it is useful to use a hamiltonian approach and recast this system in terms of sixteen first ",
    "order equations for the modes @xmath17 and their conjugates variables @xmath18 . as a consequence of perturbing around a first  order system ,",
    "the equations of motion for the @xmath18 modes decouple  @xcite .",
    "these modes provide a useful description of the general solution since they parametrize supersymmetry breaking parametrize the breaking of the first ",
    "order description for the zeroth  order solution , which for the klebanov ",
    "strassler case is not equivalent to the conditions imposed by supersymmetry . in particular there",
    "exist solutions to the first  order system with a non",
    " vanishing @xmath19flux which break the supersymmetry  @xcite . as a result ,",
    "if all the @xmath20 are zero , the perturbation is not necessary supersymmetric .",
    "the converse is however true , if any @xmath20 is different from zero , the perturbation breaks supersymmetry . in our case the only supersymmetry  breaking",
    "solution with @xmath21 is divergent in the uv . ] .",
    "we will organize the metric and flux modes as follows @xmath22 and we will concentrate on the modes @xmath23 , @xmath24 , defined as @xmath25 where @xmath24 are the isd and iasd parts of the three  form flux , @xmath26 is the rr 4form and @xmath27 is the warp factor ( we refer to appendix  [ notation ] for the notations ) .",

    "we now want to compute the isd and iasd flux once the backreaction of the anti ",

    "the equation for @xmath48 can be easily integrated to get @xmath49 we note that @xmath50 and @xmath51 are parametrized by the modes @xmath39 only , and thus vanish if the perturbation is supersymmetric .",
    "one can check ( see appendix  [ appeomg ] ) that the equation of motion   is equivalent to the equations for the modes @xmath52 .",
    "those expressions are valid for all @xmath53 and can be evaluated by numerically integrating the explicit solution for the @xmath39 and @xmath40 modes found in  @xcite .",
    "we now discuss the behavior of the three  form flux in the near  brane region , namely at small @xmath53 , and we will show that both the isd and iasd modes are singular . the presence of a singularity in the iasd flux mode was first noticed in  @xcite .",
    "an explanation of this behavior was given in  @xcite , where the singularity was interpreted as coming from the coupling of anti ",
    "d3 branes to the mode @xmath54 , which is singular in the linearized solution , as we will show in  .",
    "we remark that the @xmath55 mode also presents a singularity at linearized level and discuss the possible implications of this behavior . +",

    "d3 boundary conditions can be read from  @xcite . for the iasd flux",
    "@xmath56 we only need the expansions for the scalars conjugate to the flux perturbation modes @xmath52 which are given in  . from them and   we get @xmath57 where @xmath10 is defined in  .",
    "for the isd flux @xmath55 we also need the expansions for the modes @xmath40 which can be found in section 6.4 of  @xcite .",
    "the final result is @xmath58 we note that @xmath55 shows the same kind of singularity as the @xmath56 mode .",
    "however we remark that , as we can see from  , two contributions enter in  : one is from the @xmath39 modes , the other is from the @xmath40 terms and both give rise to the singularity .",
    "we are now going to rederive these results in a way that will makes clear their interpretation .",
    "let us introduce a set of functions @xmath59 that parametrize the breaking of the isd condition   @xmath60 where the index @xmath61 runs over the components of the three  forms .",

    "we thus see than only two components of @xmath59 are relevant for the infrared physics",
    ". we can now compute @xmath68 by expanding the expression   at first ",

    "we can now analyse the near  tip behavior of the isd and iasd fluxes , namely find the leading terms in an expansion near @xmath13 .",
    "we are interested in the origin of the singular behavior of such modes .",
    "for the imaginary part , we see from the infrared expansions of the ks fields   that the only component that contributes to the singularity is @xmath70 .",

    "let us summarize our findings .",
    "the isd and iasd three  form fluxes in the linearized anti  d3 solution have a singularity of order @xmath82 in the infrared .",
    "another mode in the solution has the same @xmath82 singularity , namely the mode @xmath54 which is coupled to the anti ",
    "d3 branes .",
    "we can see that the singularity in @xmath50 compensates the singularity in @xmath54 in the equation of motion  @xcite .",
    "indeed , at @xmath83 we find @xmath84 based on this observation , it was argued in  @xcite that at the non  linear level , since @xmath54 will be finite at the tip , the @xmath56 singularity will disappear in the full backreacted solution .",
    "we remark however that in the linearized solution also the @xmath55 mode   have a singular behavior near @xmath85 , as shown in figure  [ plotgplus ] .",
    "a similar situation was found for the full backreaction of anti ",
    "d6 branes in  @xcite .",
    "while this latter setup differs in many aspects from the klebanov ",
    "strassler background , it displays the same kind of singular behavior of our linearized solution , as we will now explain",
    ". one can perform three t  dualities along the worldvolume of the anti ",
    "d6 branes and finds that this setup will describe anti ",
    "d3 branes on @xmath3 .",
    "if one regards the three  torus as a large radius limit of the finite @xmath4 at the tip of the klebanov  strassler throat , we expect that the anti  d6 solution will describe the behavior of the three  form flux @xmath86 with legs on the three  sphere . from the result of  @xcite",
    ", we then expect that for this flux the _ full _ backreacted solution will be described by the relation @xmath87 with a divergent @xmath88 in the near  brane region ( with @xmath89 ) .",
    "we can now compare this expectation to our result for the linearized anti ",
    "d3 solution  .",
    "we see that the three  form flux with legs on the @xmath4 ( i.e. the @xmath90 component ) is precisely described by a relation of the form  , with @xmath91 . as we established in  ,",
    ", this analogy would point towards a divergency in the imaginary part of both the isd and iasd fluxes at the full non  linear order .",
    "however , the leg structure of the three  form flux in our linearized anti ",
    "d3 solution is more complicated , and there is another component of the flux , @xmath92 , which contributes to the singularity in @xmath88 , making the anti  d6 analogy alone",
    "not fully conclusive .",
    "recently , a discussion on the interpretation of the behavior described by   appeared in  @xcite , where it was argued that it describes an @xmath2flux accumulation which will eventually lead to a critical value for which the barrier against brane / flux annihilation is destroyed . it would be interesting to confirm by a full non  linear near  brane analysis whether this picture is valid for anti ",
    "d3 branes . while in principle",
    "the iasd flux singularity may disappear in the full backreaction by the argument presented in  @xcite , we still find a singular isd flux which may survive at the non  linear order .    a possible way out , as schematically depicted in  @xcite , is to argue that in the very near  tip region the solution might be altered by the polarization process in which the anti  branes form a fuzzy five ",
    "brane wrapping an @xmath93 .",
    "in particular , one may hope that the three  form flux singularity will be cured much as in the polchinski  strassler solution  @xcite .",
    "if the geometry is smoothed  out in this way , then the effects of the backreaction will alter only quantitatively the kpv model , by making the bound on @xmath8 for the existence of a metastable state more strong .",
    "however , at least for smeared anti ",
    "d3 branes , the singular isd flux   does not have the correct legs needed for brane polarization , as also mentioned in  @xcite .",
    "we have computed the isd and iasd fluxes for the linearized backreaction of @xmath0 anti ",
    "d3 branes on the klebanov  strassler geometry .",
    "both these modes have an infrared singularity .",
    "while it has been suggested  @xcite that the iasd mode may be regular in the full non  linear solution , this argument does not apply to the isd flux .",
    "in fact , by analogy with the anti ",
    "d6 backreaction  @xcite , one can even argue that some components of the iasd flux could be singular at the non  linear level as well",
    ". it would be interesting to verify this by computing the full backreaction near the anti ",
