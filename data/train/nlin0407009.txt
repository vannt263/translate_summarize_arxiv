    "although the mst applies to any klein - gordon lattice , it depends on the analytical or numerical calculation of some magnitudes @xmath6 : this calculation becomes less simple and the number of magnitudes larger as the system becomes more complicated , involving , for example , different linear frequencies or initial phases for the oscillators .    in this paper",
    "we address the application of the mst to klein - gordon lattices with an impurity .",
    "this impurity can be modelled at the on - site potential or at the coupling .",
    "the implementation of it at the masses is equivalent to at the on - site potential .",
    "the necessary magnitudes are calculated and the mst applied to 2-sites and 3-site breathers , multibreathers , phonobreathers and dark breathers .",
    "the theoretical results are also checked numerically to confirm the validity of the calculations with excellent results .",
    "the paper is organized in the following form : first we describe the details of the model ; second we recall the multibreathers stability theorem , and give some details of its application to the case of a lattice with an impurity .",

    "details of analytical calculations are relegated to the first appendix . in the second appendix , a conjecture made in ref .",
    "@xcite is proven .",
    "it is that the only multibreathers that can be stable are the ones with all the oscillator in phase or out of phase .",

    "if the coupling constant is negative , the results are reversed . furthermore , if @xmath50 is non - definite ( i.e. there are some positive and some negative eigenvalues ) , the multibreather is unstable independently on the sign of @xmath12 and the softness / hardness of the potential .",
    "we can summarize the stability properties in the following way .",

    "then , @xmath57 .",
    "it is also important to take into account that there is always a zero eigenvalue due to a global phase mode .",
    "if there were more than one zero eigenvalue , the stability theorem can only predict the instability in the case that there existed eigenvalues of different sign , but not the stability , as the 0eigenvalue is degenerate .",
