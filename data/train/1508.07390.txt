    "free - space optical ( fso ) communications provide high data rate transmission with higher security and higher flexibility compared with conventional wireless communications . due to the complexity of phase and frequency modulation , intensity modulation with direct detection ( im / dd )",
    "is used for most current fso communication systems . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fg : ch5_system ] , a typical fso system is exposed to outdoor environment . a variety of atmospheric phenomena , such as rain , fog and snow , together with pointing errors due to the building sway and light earthquake , cause signal fluctuation and result in a fading channel . besides , the background illumination ( both natural and artificial ) constitutes a low - frequency noisy photocurrent component inside the receiver , which degrades the system error performance .    in this paper , @xmath0-ary pulse amplitude modulation (",
    "m - pam ) is considered . for reliable signal detection ,",
    "the channel state information ( csi ) , which is the instantaneous value of the channel gain , and the photocurrent due to the instantaneous background radiation are required .",
    "if any value of the two is not accurate , the link performance deteriorates . in previous studies , for im / dd systems , several receiver structures , which can be used to recover information from signals through the fso fading channel ,",
    "have been proposed @xcite .",
    "most of these receivers are developed based on the assumption that the background radiation can be completely cancelled by using a lens shade , an optical filter , or an electrical filter .",
    "however , these methods are not perfect : the lens shade can only remove the light that has a different direction with the signal light , the optical filter can only remove the light with a different spectral band , and the electrical filter may also cause signal energy loss . in addition , for the im / dd system , the transmitter can not completely turn off the laser when a zero bit ( symbol ) is transmitted , resulting in a residual current component , which can not be removed by any of the methods mentioned above .",
    "besides , most photodetectors have dark current , which is the current generated in the absence of any optical radiation . in this paper , we call the combination of the dark current and current components due to the background illumination and the incomplete turning off , the background component .    in @xcite , a block - by - block iterative detection method , which can mitigate both of the channel fading and the background radiation , is investigated .",
    "however , it required a large block size to achieve a good error performance , which introduces large system delay and increases implementation complexity . in this paper , based on the generalized likelihood ratio test ( glrt ) principle",
    ", we derive a sequence receiver ( the glrt sequence receiver ) which can automatically estimate the background component and cancel it accordingly .",
    "we will show that as the observation window length increases , the bit error probability ( bep ) of our receiver approaches the _ genie bound _ , which is defined as the bep of the receiver that operates with perfect csi ( pcsi ) and in an ideal environment where no background component exists .",
    "a viterbi - type trellis - search algorithm is adopted to reduce the search complexity to a level independent of the observation window size .",
    "as we will show , the search complexity of the glrt sequence receiver grows exponentially with the modulation order . to further simplify the implementation , we derive a more efficient decision - feedback symbol - by - symbol receiver which retains the same error performance as the glrt sequence receiver .    the remaining parts of this paper are organized as follows .",
    "section ii briefly introduces the system model .",
    "afterwards , existing receivers are concisely reviewed and the exact bep expression of ideal detection is derived in section iii . in section iv ,",
    "based on the glrt principle , we develop our glrt sequence receiver .",
    "the performance results of the glrt sequence receiver is also given in this section . by a further simplification from the sequence receiver",
    ", a symbol - by - symbol decision - feedback receiver is obtained in section v and the theoretical performance analysis , simulation and numerical results of our receivers are also given in this section .",
    "in section vi we draw our final conclusions .    the common italic font letters in this paper , such as @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 ,",
    "are used to denote scalar quantities ; specifically , the lower - case letter @xmath4 is used to denote the probability density function ( pdf ) of some random variable and the upper - case letter @xmath5 denotes the probability of some event .",
    "the bold non - italic font lower - case letters , such as @xmath6 and @xmath7 , are used to denote vectors .",
    "particularly , parentheses ( ) are used to denote the priority of operations , square brackets [ ] are used to denote vectors ( also for references ) , and braces @xmath8 are used to denote sets .",
    "we consider an im / dd link using m - pam .",
    "the transmitter side constellation is shown in fig .",

    "[ fg : ch5_diag_receiver ] , there is an integrator that integrates the photocurrent for each symbol period @xmath11 . for the @xmath12th symbol interval ( @xmath13 ) ,",
    "the received electrical signal @xmath14 is obtained by sampling the integrator at time @xmath15 .",
    "since the photocurrent can be assumed to be constant during the integration time , @xmath14 can be expressed as @xcite @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the responsivity of the photodetector and @xmath18 denotes the instantaneous channel gain . in",
    ", @xmath19 denotes the received light power due to background radiation .",
    "the transmitted data symbol @xmath20 takes on any value from set @xmath21 with equal probability , and gray mapping of bits onto the levels is assumed . in practice , multiplying the received signal by the normalizing basis @xmath22 , which is shown in fig .",
    "[ fg : ch5_diag_receiver ] , is not necessary .",
    "we use it here because we want to simplify later performance analysis by normalizing the discrete additive white gaussian noise ( awgn ) term @xmath23 such that @xmath24=\\delta _ { ij } { n_0}/{2 } $ ] conditioned on that the continuous noise term @xmath25 is an additive white gaussian random process with mean zero and two - sided spectral density @xmath26 .",
    "the responsivity @xmath17 that first appears in in this paper can be calculated by @xmath27 in , @xmath28 is the quantum efficiency ; @xmath29 is the elmentary charge ; @xmath30 is the carrier wavelength ; @xmath31 is the planck s constant ; and @xmath32 is the light speed in vacuum .    in @xcite , the background illumination is simply assumed to be known perfectly and subtracted completely .",
    "however , in practice , the receiver is exposed to varieties of non - signal - carrying light interference such as the natural and artificial ambient light surrounding the receiver .",
    "furthermore , most practical optical transmitters can not turn the laser off completely when a zero bit ( symbol ) is transmitted , resulting in some residual energy received by the receiver .",
    "this phenomenon is usually known to be caused by the finite laser extinction ratio . besides , most photodetectors have dark current , which is the current generated in the absence of any optical radiation .",
    "these factors together constitute a low frequency interference component inside the receiver , which is random and time - varying . unlike @xcite",
    ", in this paper , we do not assume the background illumination can be known perfectly and subtracted accordingly .",
    "it should be emphasized that the interaction of the signal with background radiations due to the non - linear characteristic of photodetectors can practically be neglected @xcite .",
    "thus , we do not consider the interaction of the signal with background radiations here .    by defining @xmath33 as the instantaneous receiver - side electrical - domain minimum signal distance and @xmath34 @xmath14 can be modelled as @xcite @xmath35 since atmospheric turbulence and pointing errors cause fluctuations in the intensity of the received signal , i.e.",
    ", @xmath18 is time - varying , therefore , @xmath36 is time - varying and is modelled as @xmath37 where @xmath38 denotes the electrical - domain minimum signal distance when @xmath39 , i.e. , @xmath40 , which is related to the average transmit power @xmath41 , i.e. , @xmath42    for fso im / dd systems using pin diodes , compared with the electrical circuit thermal noise , the shot noise introduced by the communication signal , which is also awgn , is negligible .",
    "however , since shot noise is incident - light - power dependent , if the background radiation is very strong , the shot noise is enhanced .",
    "thus , in this paper , we have the assumption below .    in this paper , we assume that the background radiation has been reduced by the well - designed lens optics and the photocurrent due to the residual background radiation is of the same order of the electrical circuit thermal noise .",
    "[ asmpt:1 ]    under this assumption , the shot noise introduced by both communication signal light and background radiation is still negligible .",
    "the analysis of how the background radiation affects the system performance and the method to mitigate it , given in this paper , is based on this assumption .    in this channel model ,",
    "three factors determine @xmath18 : geometric spread and pointing errors @xmath43 , atmospheric turbulence @xmath44 , and path loss @xmath45 @xcite .",
    "the channel state @xmath18 can be formulated as @xmath46 quantity @xmath45 is deterministic while @xmath43 and @xmath44 are stochastic . in @xcite",
    ", log - normal distribution is adopted to model @xmath44 for weak turbulence , and gamma - gamma distribution for moderate to strong turbulence and the negative exponential distribution for strong turbulence . since in @xcite",
    ", it has been shown that the gamma - gamma distribution can nicely fit the channel fading statistics of all turbulence regimes , in this paper , we only consider @xmath44 as a gamma - gamma distributed random variable , and the probability density function ( pdf ) of @xmath44 is @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the modified bessel function of the second kind , and @xmath49 and @xmath50 are the variances of the small and large scale eddies , respectively .",
    "further details of the parameters in can be found in @xcite and @xcite . pointing error influence on an fso system",
    "is discussed in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we follow the result in @xcite , and the pdf of @xmath43 can be expressed as @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the fraction of the collected power when no pointing error occurs , and @xmath53 is the ratio between the equivalent beam radius at the receiver and the pointing error displacement standard deviation at the receiver .",
    "as @xmath45 is deterministic , we incorporate @xmath45 into @xmath44 which amounts to setting @xmath54 . then for a turbulence channel with pointing errors ,",
    "the channel gain is @xmath55 .",
    "thus , its pdf can be derived as @xmath56    scintillation index ( si ) is a key metric for fso communications , and measures the normalised intensity variance caused by atmospheric turbulence .",
    "it is defined as the normalised variance of the irradiance fluctuations @xcite .",
    "note that , in our model , pointing errors are considered as well as atmospheric turbulence .",
    "thus , si is @xmath57}{\\mathbb{e}^2[h_a ] } -1,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] but not @xmath58/\\mathbb{e}^2[h]-1 $ ] .",
    "since we use the gamma - gamma fading model , the si can also be calculated according to si = @xmath59@xcite .",
    "accordind to @xcite , the turbulence with si@xmath601 is in weak irradiance fluctuations regime ; and the turbulence with si@xmath611 is in moderate - to - strong irradiance fluctuations regime .",
    "since the time scales of these fading processes are of the order of @xmath62s to @xmath63s , which is far larger than the bit interval ( @xmath64s for multi - gbps systems ) , @xmath18 is considered to be constant over a large number ( @xmath65 ) of symbol intervals @xcite . according to the experimental results reported in @xcite , the photocurrent due to background radiation is commonly in the kilo - hertz region .",
    "for some special source , e.g. , the fluorescent lamps geared by electronic ballasts , the photocurrent fluctuates in a few hundreds of kilohertz region .",
    "thus , it is safe to consider @xmath66 as a constant over a number ( @xmath67 ) of symbol intervals",
    ". finally , the channel coherence length @xmath68 , which is defined as the number of data symbols over which @xmath18 and @xmath66 can be regarded as constants , could be assumed at least of the order of @xmath69 .",
    "the system parameters of this paper are given as follows : for the weak turbulence channel , @xmath70 , @xmath71 and the corresponding @xmath72 ; for the strong turbulence channel , @xmath73 , @xmath74 and @xmath75 . according to",
    ", the turbulence with si=0.1244 is in weak irradiance fluctuations regime ; and the turbulence with si=1.3890 is in moderate - to - strong irradiance fluctuations regime .",
    "the pointing error parameters are chosen to be @xmath76 and @xmath77 @xcite .",
    "additionally , we assume the system data rate @xmath78 is 10 gbps , thus the symbol duration @xmath79 is on the order of @xmath80s and the channel coherence length @xmath68 can be safely regarded as @xmath69 .",
    "we consider the typical thermal noise , which is -174 dbm / hz , passing through a 50@xmath81 receiver circuit .",
    "thus , the value of @xmath82 is @xmath83 .",
    "the carrier wavelength is @xmath84 m and the quantum efficiency is @xmath85 .",
    "here we assume the pcsi receiver only knows the csi perfectly .",
    "it does not know the background component @xmath66 and regards @xmath66 as zero , i.e. , @xmath86 .",
    "thus , ml detection is performed by setting the decision @xmath87 as @xmath88 where @xmath89is the pdf of @xmath14 conditioned on @xmath18 , @xmath38 , @xmath86 and @xmath20 . through the whole paper",
    ", we use @xmath87 to denote the decision on symbol @xmath20 . based on and regarding @xmath66 as zero ,",
    "the conditional pdf is @xmath90 substituting into and eliminating irrelevant items , we have the decision rule as @xmath91 in principle , to perform , one has to compute the value of @xmath92 with all possible @xmath2 s ( 0,1 , ... , @xmath93 ) and choose the one with minimum value . in that way , the search complexity increases with @xmath0 . to reduce the complexity",
    ", we can further simplify the decision rule to @xmath94 where @xmath95 is the floor function . after performing ,",
    "an additional reverse gray mapping is required to recover the transmitted information in bits .",
    "clearly , the implementation complexity of is very low and is independent of the modulation order @xmath0 .    to study the impact of background radiation on the system bep , we plot fig .",
    "[ fg : ch5_bep ] . for simplicity",
    ", we only show the simulation results of systems using on - off keying ( ook ) , which is a special case of pam , i.e. , the 2-pam .",
    "the value of @xmath66 ranges from zero to five times of the system awgn root mean square value .",
    "we can see that , for both weak and strong turbulent conditions , the bep grows as the background radiation goes higher .",
    "the background radiation power corresponding to @xmath96 can be calculated via @xmath97 dbm .",
    "compared with the receiver average received power , @xmath98 dbm is regarded as relatively low . in fig .",
    "[ fg : ch5_bep ] , we show the performance degradation due to weak but non - negligible background radiation .",
    "in fact , if the background radiation keeps increasing , the system error performance will be severely degraded . at lower",
    "received power regions , even weak background radiation may lead the system bep to grow to half , resulting in link disruption .",

    "[ fg : ch5_bep ] is defined as the bep of the receiver that operates with perfect csi ( pcsi ) and in an ideal environment where background component vanishes .",
    "the exact expression of the genie bound is given in a later subsection .",
    "@xmath99      we assume the ideal receiver knows both the csi and the background component @xmath66 perfectly . thus , ml detection is performed by setting the decision @xmath87 as @xmath100 where @xmath101is the pdf of @xmath14 conditioned on @xmath18 , @xmath38 , @xmath66 and @xmath20 , and is given by @xmath102 substituting into and eliminating irrelevant items , we have the decision rule as @xmath103 as we have argued in the previous subsection , the complexity of is on the order of @xmath0 and we further simplified it as @xmath104    at this point , we see that , the product of @xmath18 and @xmath38 , i.e. , the receiver - side electrical - domain minimum signal distance @xmath36 , and @xmath66 are both essential to perform ml detection . more intuitively , we give the constellation at the receiver side in fig .",
    "[ fg : ch5_constellation_rx ] , from which we can see the instantaneous values of @xmath36 and @xmath66 are both required for reliable signal detection .",

    "an unbiased estimation of the decision threshold can be given by @xmath107 using this decision threshold , the first - stage blind detection is @xmath108 where @xmath109 denotes the first - stage decision on @xmath20 .",
    "after this , the second - stage decision - feedback detection is performed as @xmath110 where @xmath111 denotes the second - stage decision on @xmath20 , and the threshold @xmath112 is obtained by @xmath113 .",

    "reference @xcite shows that the bep of this rsl - bd receiver depends on the observation window length @xmath3 and can approach the genie bound if @xmath3 is sufficiently large .",
    "however , since this receiver performs block - by - block detection , large block size though brings better performance , but also introduces large signal delay . besides , it is difficult to generalize this receiver to multi - level cases where multiple decision boundaries are required .",
    "in addition , for the rsl - bd receiver , as discussed in @xcite , the system performance is limited by an error floor .",
    "this is caused by the occurrence of a block of all zeros or all ones .",
    "we can see from that a block of all zeros or all ones will lead to a zero denominator .",
    "increasing the block length can only reduce the probability of the the occurrence of such a troublesome block , but not completely avoid it .",
    "we will show in the next two sections that our receivers ( both the glrt sequence receiver and dfb receiver ) can completely overcomes this error floor problem .",

    "are used as a benchmark when analyzing other receivers .",
    "apart from this subsection , in all other parts of this paper , when it comes to the bep , it refers to the abep over all possible channel states .",
    "we consider a subsequence with @xmath3 immediate past symbols of the entire sequence , where @xmath3 is much smaller than the channel coherence length @xmath68 . at time @xmath12 , the transmitted data subsequence is denoted by @xmath121 $ ] where @xmath122 for any integer @xmath123 .",

    "as @xmath3 is far smaller than @xmath68 , the received subsequence could be modelled as @xmath126 in , @xmath127 is a unit vector whose @xmath3 components are all ones .",

    "the decision rule is reduced to @xmath137 for given @xmath7 and @xmath66 , by differentiating @xmath138 with respect to @xmath36 and letting the derivative be equal to zero , we find that @xmath138 achieves its minimum value at @xmath139 substituting into @xmath138 , we differentiate @xmath140 with respect to @xmath66 and let the derivative be equal to zero .",

    "thus , to minimize @xmath143 with respect to @xmath7 , we only need to maximize the decision metric @xmath144 with respect to @xmath7 .",
    "the decision rule now is reduced to @xmath145    here , we can see evidently that the glrt sequence receiver only calculates the decision metric in .",
    "the estimation of @xmath36 and @xmath66 is implicit .",
    "no integrals are involved in this metric , resulting in low computational complexity .",
    "moreover , the exact knowledge of the distribution of @xmath18 and @xmath66 , and the indicidual values of @xmath115 and @xmath82 , are not required in .",
    "this makes it robust , and enables it to operate in any slowly time - varying environment .    by substituting into and simplifying the result",
    ", we obtain the estimate of @xmath36 as @xmath146 if the transmitter requires a feed - back estimated value of @xmath18 from the receiver for power adaption , the receiver can dynamically substitute the most recent detection results @xmath147 into and then send back the result .",
    "then the transmitter can calculate the value of @xmath148 accordingly since @xmath38 is available at the transmitter side .      in principle",

    "if @xmath3 increases , the search complexity increases exponentially .",
    "nevertheless , a large value of @xmath3 is preferred to make the receiver bep achieve the genie bound .",
    "thus , to use a large value of @xmath3 and to keep the implementation simple , a similar viterbi - type trellis search algorithm to the ones in @xcite is adopted .",
    "the viterbi - type trellis - search algorithm keeps the same as introduced in @xcite and we will not reintroduce the algorithm in this paper . the trellis diagram for @xmath150",
    "is given in @xcite and the one for @xmath151 in @xcite .",
    "it should be noted that the search complexity is on the order of @xmath152 , i.e. , the complexity grows quadratically with @xmath0 .",
    "thus , this method can be used for systems with lower - order modulations .    observing the decision metric given in",

    "the idea of selectively storing the detected signals in the memory keeps the same as that introduced in @xcite .",
    "however , since compared with the decision metric derived in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* eq . ( 39 ) ) , the metric in this paper has been changed , the particular selective - store strategy should be modified accordingly to make it appropriate for the background radiation cancellation .    in the implementation of the viterbi - type trellis - search algorithm",
    ", each survivor can be divided into two parts by the most recent merge node : the _ detected _ part and the _ ongoing _ part . since the detection on the ongoing part is not completed , all survivors should be exactly stored in the memory because each one is possible to be the detector output .",
    "we selectively stores the detected signals in the memory . since signals carrying symbol `` 0 '' can also be used to estimate the background component , unlike that proposed in @xcite , in this selective - store strategy , we do not discard signals carrying `` 0 ' 's . in @xcite , only signals with the highest power are put into the memory .",
    "this method is effective and very efficient in terms of the memory usage .",
    "however , it requires a relatively long channel coherence length .",
    "for example , if we use @xmath154 to denote the memory length , the corresponding observation window length @xmath155 is on the order of @xmath156 .",
    "if a higher order modulation format and a large memory size are adopted , say @xmath157 and @xmath158 , the effective subsequence length is on the order of 1600 and excesses the channel coherence length @xmath159 .",
    "thus , in this background cancellation application , for each data symbol @xmath160 , we store an equal number of its corresponding received signals .",
    "specifically , for each data symbol @xmath2 , we store its most recent @xmath161 corresponding received signals .",
    "as it should be , the memory size @xmath154 is a integer multiple of the modulation order @xmath0 .",
    "as we have shown in the appendix.a , the corresponding observation window length is shorter , and thus we can use a relatively large memory to achieve a higher performance . after adopting the selective - store strategy , the new subsequence @xmath162 , formed by re - combing the symbols stored in the memory , will be never parallel to @xmath129 and thus we can completely avoid the decision metric based on @xmath162 to have a troublesome zero denominator . in the evaluation of , the values of @xmath163 , @xmath164 , @xmath165 , @xmath166 and @xmath167 are required . among them , @xmath163 and @xmath164 can be evaluated by recursively adding in the most recent signals and subtracting the oldest ones stored in the memory ; and @xmath165 , @xmath166 and @xmath167 are constant , which are unnecessary to be refreshed dynamically .",
    "therefore , adopting this selective store strategy does not increase the implementation complexity .",

    "it can be seen that with @xmath169 , the performance of the glrt sequence receiver achieves the genie bound perfectly . with different background radiation strengths , i.e. , different values of @xmath66 ,",
    "the performance degradation due to the background radiation has been completely mitigated .",
    "when @xmath154 is small , we can still see some performance loss .",
    "this is because with fewer receiver memory , the estimation of both the channel gain and the background component is not accurate sufficiently .",
    "compared with the background radiation free case discussed in @xcite , we see a larger memory is required here to let the system error performance achieve the genie bound .",
    "this makes sense since we have one more quantity , i.e. , the background component , to estimate .",
    "the phenomenon that the performance depends on the memory size but not on the background radiation strength is due to the estimation of @xmath66 is unbiased and the estimation accuracy depends on the memory length .",
    "explanation in details will be given in the later section .",
    "as discussed in the previous subsection , the search complexity of the viterbi - type trellis - search algorithm grows quadratically with the modulation order @xmath0 .",

    "[ fg : ch5_bep_vs_l ] , as the value of @xmath154 increases , the bep of all receivers approaches the genie bound .",

    "thus , we have shown that , by both theoretical analysis and simulation , with a higher value of @xmath154 , the estimations of @xmath36 and @xmath66 , are more accurate .",
    "this enables the bep of our dfb receiver to approach the genie bound .",
    "in fso communications , the background radiation deteriorates link performance . in this paper , we first show how the performance degrades by simulation .",
    "since the channel coherence length can be safely regarded as @xmath212 symbol intervals , we can use detected data symbols to estimate the unknown channel gain and the background component . in this paper , we first propose our glrt sequence receiver . however , though its performance can achieve the genie bound , the implementation complexity increases with the modulation order @xmath0 quadratically .",
    "based on its decision metric , we propose a dfb symbol - by - symbol receiver .",
    "the implementation complexity of the new dfb receiver is very low and is independent of the modulation order .",

    "the implementation is simple and spectrally efficient . from both theoretical analysis and simulation ,",
    "we have shown that as the number of the detected data symbols used to estimate the channel increases , the bep of our dfb receiver approaches the genie bound .",
    "one key assumption we have made in this paper is the assumption [ asmpt:1 ] that the background radiation has been reduced by the well - designed lens optics and the background component is on the same order of the electrical circuit thermal noise .",
    "however , if the background component is too large , the shot noise introduced by the background radiation can no longer be neglected .",
    "the receiver - side snr will be reduced compared with the background radiation free case . for strong background radiation , our glrt receivers",
    "can still be used to remove the dc ( or low frequency ) component , but not reduce the system noise , which is dominant by shot noise .",
    "thus , our glrt receivers can only completely mitigate the effects caused by weak background radiation , where the shot noise is negligible .",
    "the shot noise limited system is similar to the photon - counting ( pc ) system introduced in @xcite . for the pc system ,",
    "since the receiver can directly counts how many photons arrives during a symbol interval , the electrical circuit thermal noise no longer affects the system performance and the uncertainty of the received signal comes from both the noisy background radiation and the transmitted signal itself . in that way , we can only compensate it but not cancel it .",
    "the existence of background radiation still deteriorates the performance of the pc system , and after adopting our method introduced in @xcite , this deterioration can be suppressed but not completely removed .      in this paper",
    ", for each data symbol , we store its most recent @xmath161 corresponding received signals in the memory . the corresponding observation window with length @xmath155 , contains at least @xmath161 entities for each data symbol .",
    "thus , @xmath155 is a discrete random variable and we need to study its probability distribution and to see if @xmath213 can be guaranteed with a high probability .",
