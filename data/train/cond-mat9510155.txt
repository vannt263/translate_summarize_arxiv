    "the adiabatic bond charge model ( bcm ) has been quite successful in explaining the phonon dispersion curves of group iv elemental semiconductors@xcite and partially ionic iii - v semiconducting materials@xcite with a zincblende structure . in recent years",
    "it has been successfully applied to study phonons in semiconducting superlattices@xcite , optical properties of al@xmath0ga@xmath1as@xcite , open semiconductor surfaces@xcite and even sp@xmath2-bonded materials like graphite@xcite and fullerenes.@xcite quite recently , a modified version of the bond charge model has been applied@xcite to study the second order raman spectra of alas and alsb .    in view of the similar dispersion curves of tetrahedrally",
    "connected iii - v and ii - vi materials , it is surprising that no attempt to extend bcm to the latter has appeared in the literature",
    ". this may be partly due to the comments indicating that early attempts in this direction were not successful because it was found@xcite that in the case of ii - vi materials the asymmetry of the bond charge position became too large to find a stable equilibrium position for the bond charges .",
    "these conclusions were based on the studies of the valence electron charge density using local pseudopotentials@xcite , which suggested a nearly complete charge transfer from the cation to the anion .",
    "these calculations actually overestimated the ionicity of these compounds and produced valence band spectra in strong disagreement with experimental photoemission results.@xcite later , more accurate calculations using nonlocal pseudopotentials@xcite showed better agreement with the experiments and yielded charge densities indicating a strong shift of the bond maximum rather than complete charge transfer .",
    "in fact , the charge density plots for iii - v and ii - vi compounds@xcite are nearly identical except that the charge maxima in the latter appear to be slightly shifted toward the anion , indicating that , despite their greater ionicity , ii - vi compounds are dominantly covalent in nature . in view of these results",
    ", it is expected that the bcm should give a good account of the phonons in ii - vi materials provided the bond charges are placed at physically reasonable places suggested by the pseudopotential calculations .",
    "traditionally , the lattice dynamics of these materials has been done using rigid ion or shell models.@xcite these models give good fits to the observed phonon dispersion curves at the cost of a large number of adjustable parameters ( 10 or more ) , some of which have no physical interpretation .",
    "recently , _",
    "ab initio _ calculations of phonon spectra have appeared,@xcite but they are are not feasible for studying large systems such as alloys like cd@xmath0hg@xmath1te or thick superlattices .",
    "therefore it is desirable to have a realistic model with fewer , physically meaningful , parameters that is easy to extend to more complex systems . in this paper",
    "we show that the 6-parameter bcm provides a good description of the phonons and other lattice dynamical quantities such as elastic constants and specific heat in ii - vi materials .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in sect .",
    "ii we provide a brief overview of the bond charge model.@xcite in sect .",
    "iii we discuss the results for six ii - vi compounds and in sect .",
    "iv trends in the parameters are discussed .",
    "the adiabatic bond charge model ( bcm ) for homopolar semiconductors@xcite and partially ionic iii - v compounds@xcite is the simplest empirical lattice dynamical model that correctly describes the phonon dispersion curves of covalent crystals . in the bcm the valence electron charge density",
    "is represented by massless point particles , the bond charges ( bc s ) , that follow the ionic motion adiabatically .",
    "the bcm unit cell consists of two ions and four bond charges that are placed along the bonds between the ions . in homopolar covalent crystals",
    "the bond charges are placed midway between the neighboring atoms while in iii - v compounds the bc divides the bond length in the ratio of 5:3 .",
    "this is consistent with nonlocal pseudopotential calculations for the valence electron charge density@xcite that indicate that the charge density maximum in iii - v compounds shifts toward the group v element .",
    "this shift is even stronger in the case of ii - vi compounds , reflecting their more ionic character .",
    "the bcm parameter @xmath3 which measures the polarity of the bond is defined in terms of the ratio in which the bc position divides the bond length .",
    "if @xmath4 is the bond length and @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the two ion - bc distances then @xmath7 ( @xmath8 ) for homopolar materials and @xmath9 ( @xmath10 ) for iii - v compounds . in our extension of the bcm to ii - vi materials",
    "we have chosen to use @xmath11 corresponding to the ratio @xmath12 which is based on the results@xcite of microscopic calculations .",
    "this choice will be discussed in more detail in sect .",
    "[ sec : trends ] .",
    "the cation and the anion interact with one another and with the bond charges via central potentials @xmath13 , @xmath14 , and @xmath15 , respectively . the bond charges centered on a common ion interact via a three body keating potential,@xcite @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the distance vector between ion @xmath18 ( @xmath18 = 1 , 2 ) and bc @xmath19 , @xmath20 is the force constant and @xmath21 is the equilibrium value of @xmath22 .",
    "the bond charges centered on a particular ion also interact directly with one another through a central potential , @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the distance between the bond charges centered on the cation ( @xmath25 ) or the anion ( @xmath26 ) .",
    "finally , the ions and the bc s interact via the coulomb interaction characterized by a single parameter @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the charge of a bc , and @xmath29 is the dielectric constant .",
    "each of the ions is presumed to have a charge @xmath30 so that the net charge in the unit cell is zero .    to reduce the number of parameters it is assumed@xcite that @xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 . if we use these constraints on the total lattice energy per unit cell @xmath34 - \\alpha_{\\scriptscriptstyle m } { ( 2z)^2 \\over \\epsilon}{e^2 \\over t } +    6[v_{bb}^1 + v_{bb}^2 + \\psi_1(r_{bb}^{(1 ) } ) + \\psi_2(r_{bb}^{(2)})]\\ ] ] along with the equilibrium conditions , @xmath35 and @xmath36 , we find@xcite @xmath37 the conditions for stable equilibrium , @xmath38 and @xmath39 , further yield @xmath40 and @xmath41 the madelung constant @xmath42 of the model is defined by writing the coulomb energy per unit cell as @xmath43 . for @xmath44",
    "the values of @xmath42 , @xmath45 and @xmath46 are found numerically@xcite to be 5.0598 , 4.0539 and 17.46 , respectively . in eq .",

    "figure 1 shows the dispersion curves for six ii - vi materials along with the existing neutron scattering data .",
    "figure  2 shows the corresponding densities of states ( dos ) .",
    "we present in table i the bcm parameters and in table ii the calculated and measured elastic constants . in all cases",
    "the overall agreement with the experimental data is fairly good and is of the same quality as for bcm fits for iii - v compounds.@xcite for comparison we have also included the dispersion curves for gaas and insb calculated using the parameters from ref .  . for cdte",
    "our six parameter fit is as good as the 14 parameter shell model fit of rowe _",
    "et al._@xcite and the 11 parameter rigid ion model fit of talwar _",
    "et al._@xcite all three models show a slight upward bend in the to branch in the ( 100 ) direction , which is in contrast with the results of a recent _ ab initio _",
    "calculation.@xcite    the three models give very similar predictions for the phonon density of states .",
    "the principal difference is that the shell model does not predict a gap in the dos between the acoustic and optical contributions , while the bcm has a smaller gap than that seen in the rigid ion model .",
    "this underscores the fact that the bcm is , in many ways , an intermediate model between the shell model and the rigid ion model .",
    "the shell model takes care of the electronic polarizability explicitly by attaching deformable shells to the ions .",
    "the bcm partially accounts for the electronic polarizability through the adiabatic motion of the bond charges , while the rigid ion model ignores it completely .    for zns and",
    "znte our fits are comparable with the 10-parameter valence shell model results of vagelatos _",
    "et al._@xcite for znte the bcm predicts a large dispersion in the lo branch near the zone edge .",
    "however , the maximum deviation from the experimentally measured frequency at the x point is only about 7 percent . for both zns and znte the shape of the optical branches in the ( 110 ) direction is different from the results of ref .",
    "but is similar to that predicted@xcite by _ ab initio _ calculations . for znse also",
    "the agreement with the neutron data@xcite and the measured elastic constants@xcite is fairly good .",
    "mercury compounds , because of their semi - metallic nature , deserve a separate discussion . because of the zero band - gap , the energy for electronic transitions from the valence band to the conduction band is comparable to the optical phonon energy . for hgte raman measurements@xcite at 90 k and infrared reflectivity measurements@xcite at 77",
    "k yield @xmath66 @xmath67 whereas infrared spectra at 8 k gave@xcite @xmath68 @xmath67 .",
    "this difference was attributed to the large number of carriers at higher temperatures .",
    "the same reason is invoked to explain the degenerate values of @xmath69 and @xmath70 found in neutron scattering experiments.@xcite because of this controversy we did not use optical phonon frequencies near the zone center in our fit for hgte .",
    "it is seen that the agreement with the acoustic and transverse optical phonons is good . however , the fit for the lo branch is not of the same quality , although the deviation from the experimental points is only a few percent . in the ( 111 ) direction",
    "the bcm predicts that the lo branch will dip downward instead of the upward trend observed experimentally.@xcite for hgse the agreement with the available neutron data on acoustic phonons@xcite and optical measurements@xcite and measured elastic constants@xcite is very good . because of the lack of neutron data on optical phonons we can not comment on the accuracy of the optical branches .",
    "however , it should be mentioned that the bcm and the 11 parameter rigid ion model@xcite give similar behavior for the optical branches .    to further check the parameters we have calculated the specific heats@xcite for all the six materials using the parameters given in table i. the results are shown in fig .  3 as plots of log @xmath71 _ vs. _ log @xmath72 along with the experimental data .",
    "in every case good agreement is obtained with the experiments , giving further support for the parameters used and the calculated density of states .",
    "we have thus demonstrated that the 6-parameter bcm provides a good description of the phonons and other lattice dynamical quantities such as elastic constants and specific heat for ii - vi compounds with zincblende coordination .",
    "the overall agreement with the neutron data is very good .",
    "however , some discrepancies remain , particularly in the lo branch near the zone edge , where the bcm predicts a large dispersion in almost every material including the iii - v compounds .",
    "this is most obvious in hgte and is indicative of the failure of the bcm to account for the polarizability of the ion core .",
    "because of the associated macroscopic field , the lo phonons are more affected than the other branches .",
    "the calculated@xcite static dielectric function @xmath73 for iii - v and ii - vi compounds is known to have considerable structure , so including a charge form factor should remedy this discrepancy.@xcite",
    "some trends in the parameters presented in table i are immediately obvious . one notices that as one goes from group iv elements to iii - v compounds to ii - vi compounds the parameters involving bc s change uniformly . for group",
    "iv elements the bond charge is situated midway along the bond and the ion - bc and bc - ion - bc force constants are equal for the two ions . however , in iii - v compounds the bc shifts toward the anion which results in higher values for @xmath74 and @xmath60 than @xmath75 and @xmath59 respectively .",
    "this trend continues as we move to ii - vi compounds in which the bc is even closer to the anion .",
    "this pattern in the values of these parameters can be traced to the equations linking @xmath50 and @xmath51 to @xmath42 and @xmath45 .",
    "it should be noted that the values for @xmath42 and @xmath76 for ii - vi compounds are higher than those for iii - v compounds .",
    "apart from these obvious features , there are no other discernible trends in the parameters with respect to the ionicity or the bond length .",
    "however , it is seen that the ion - bond parameters @xmath75 and @xmath74 are considerably lower for mercury compounds than for other materials .",
    "this is reasonable in view of the semi - metallic nature of these materials and the fact that these parameters represent off - diagonal contributions to the dielectric function .",
    "the effect of ionicity on the phonon dispersion curves can be investigated by studying the isoelectronic sequence of materials in which the bond lengths and the average mass in the unit cell are almost same .",
    "two such sequences are ge - gaas - znse and @xmath77sn - insb - cdte .",
    "increased ionicity results in a general lowering of all frequencies and elastic constants and a lifting of the lo - to degeneracy at the @xmath78 point and the lo - la degeneracy at the x point .",
    "a glance at the bcm parameters for these materials shows that the only pattern is a decrease in the magnitude of the bond charge @xmath79 and , in the case of ge - gaas - znse , a decrease in @xmath80 with increased ionicity . for the other sequence",
    ", @xmath80 is almost same for @xmath77-sn and insb but it is smaller for cdte .",
    "a cross comparison of the corresponding materials in the two sequences shows that moving down the periodic table , with its concomitant increase in metallicity , yields an increase in the ion - ion interaction @xmath80 while the parameters involving the bond charges decrease .",
    "we should also comment on the choice of the equilibrium positions of the bond charges . in principle , @xmath3 should be treated as the seventh adjustable parameter of the model .",
    "however , we decided to use the physically reasonable value of 1/3 for @xmath3 .",
    "this corresponds to dividing the bond length in a ratio 2:1 and is consistent with the pseudo - potential calculations of the valence electron charge density.@xcite however , we were also able to find values for the six parameters which still satisfied the stability conditions ( [ eq : stable1 ] ) and ( [ eq : stable2 ] ) and which gave satisfactory fits for @xmath3 as high as 0.55 .",
    "the parameters that varied most with @xmath3 were the ion - bc force constants ; increasing @xmath3 led to a larger @xmath74 and a smaller @xmath75 .",
    "the remaining parameters also changed , but by much less . in every case",
    ", the acoustic phonon curves showed very good agreement with the neutron scattering data .",
    "however , the agreement with the optical phonons slightly worsened as @xmath3 increased .",
    "these results highlight the arbitrariness involved in defining the equilibrium position for the bond charges . our choice of @xmath11 , which coincides roughly with the position predicted by the pseudopotential calculations@xcite , still gave the best overall agreement with the experimental results .",
    "we have applied the adiabatic bond charge model to study phonons in six ii - vi compounds with a zincblende structure .",
    "the theoretical predictions of the 6-parameter bcm are in good agreement with the available neutron data and the experimentally measured elastic constants and specific heats .",
    "some minor discrepancies in the lo branch near the zone edge are believed to be due to the incomplete description of the electronic polarizability of the ions .",
    "these deviations are larger , though still only a few percent , in the case of hgte as expected from its semi - metallic nature and consequently stronger screening effects . in conclusion",
    ", we have found that the 6-parameter adiabatic bond charge model provides a satisfactory description of the lattice dynamics of tetrahedrally connected ii - vi compounds .",
    "the agreement with the experimental data is of the same quality as for iii - v compounds .",
    "we have also discussed some broad trends seen in the parameters .",
    "we find that the parameters for the bond charge - cation short range interactions decrease with a corresponding increase in the parameters for the bond charge - anion interactions as one goes from group iv elements to iii - v to ii - vi compounds .",
