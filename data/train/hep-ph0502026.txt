    "there may be a deep connection between the origin of matter in the universe and the observed neutrino oscillations .",
    "this speculation is inspired by the idea that the heavy right handed majorana neutrinos that are added to the standard model for understanding small neutrino masses via the seesaw mechanism@xcite can also explain the origin of matter via their decay .",
    "the mechanism goes as follows@xcite : cp violation in the same yukawa interaction of the right handed neutrinos , which go into giving nonzero neutrino masses after electroweak symmetry breaking , lead to a primordial lepton asymmetry via the out of equilibrium decay @xmath11 ( where @xmath12 are the known leptons and @xmath13 is the standard model higgs field ) .",
    "this asymmetry subsequently gets converted to baryon - anti - baryon asymmetry observed today via the the electroweak sphaleron interactions@xcite , above @xmath14 ( @xmath15 being the weak scale ) .",
    "since this mechanism involves no new interactions beyond those needed in the discussion of neutrino masses , one would expect that better understanding of neutrino mass physics would clarify one of the deepest mysteries of cosmology both qualitatively as well as quantitatively .",
    "this question has been the subject of many investigations in recent years@xcite in the context of different neutrino mass models and many interesting pieces of information about issues such as the spectrum of right handed neutrinos , upper limit on the neutrino masses etc have been obtained . in a recent paper , @xcite , two of the authors showed that if one assumes that the lepton sector of minimal seesaw models has a leptonic @xmath0 interchange symmetry@xcite , then one can under certain plausible assumptions indeed predict the magnitude of the matter - anti - matter asymmetry in terms of low energy oscillation parameter , @xmath16 and a high scale cp phase .",
    "the choice of @xmath0 symmetry was dictated by the fact that it is the simplest symmetry of neutrino mass matrix that explains the maximal atmospheric mixing as indicated by data .",
    "using present experimental value for @xmath16 , one obtains the right magnitude for the baryon asymmetry of the universe .",
    "the results of the paper @xcite were derived in the limit that @xmath0 interchange symmetry is exact . if however a nonzero value for the neutrino mixing angle @xmath8 is detected in future experiments , this would imply that this symmetry is only approximate .",
    "also , since in the standard model @xmath17 and @xmath18 are members of the @xmath19 doublets @xmath20 and @xmath21 , any symmetry between @xmath17 and @xmath18 must be a symmetry between @xmath22 and @xmath23 at the fundamental lagrangian level .",
    "the observed difference between the muon and tau masses would therefore also imply that the @xmath0 symmetry has to be an approximate symmetry . in view of this",
    ", it is important to examine to what extent the results of ref.@xcite carry over to the case when the symmetry is approximate .",
    "we find two interesting results under some very general assumtions : ( i ) a simple formula relating the lepton asymmetry and neutrino oscillation observables for the case of three right handed neutrinos , i.e. @xmath24 and ( ii ) a relation of the form @xmath25 for the case of two right handed neutrinos .",
    "measurement of @xmath8 will have important implications for both the models ; in particular we show that in a class of models with two right handed neutrinos with approximate @xmath0 symmetry breaking , there is a lower limit on @xmath8 , which is between 0.1 to 0.15 depending on the values of the cp phase .",
    "these values are in the range which will be probed in experiments in near future@xcite .",
    "the basic assumption under which the two results are derived are the following :    \\(a ) type i seesaw formula is responsible for neutrino masses :    \\(b ) @xmath0 symmetry for leptons is broken only at high scale in the mass matrix of the right handed neutrinos .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "ii , we outline the general framework for our discussion ; in sec .",
    "iii , we rederive the result of ref.@xcite for the case of exact @xmath0 symmetry ; in sec .",
    "iv , we derive the connection between @xmath1 and oscillation parameters for the case of approximate @xmath0 symmetry .",
    "iv is devoted to the case of two right handed neutrinos , where we present the allowed range of @xmath8 dictated by leptogenesis argument . in sec .",
    "v , we describe a class of simple gauge models where these conditions are satisfied .",
    "we start with an extension of the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) for the generic the type i seesaw model for neutrino masses .",
    "the effective low energy superpotential for this model is given by @xmath26 here @xmath27 are leptonic superfields ; @xmath28 are the higgs fields of mssm . @xmath29 and @xmath30 are general matrices where we choose a basis where @xmath31 is diagonal .",
    "we do not display the quark part of the superpotential which is same as in the mssm .",
    "after electroweak symmetry breaking , this leads to the type i seesaw formula for neutrino masses given by @xmath32 the constraints of @xmath0 symmetry will manifest themselves in the form of the @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "it has been pointed out that if we go to a basis where the right handed neutrino mass matrix is diagonal , we can solve for @xmath29 in terms of the neutrino masses and mixing angles as follows@xcite : @xmath33 where @xmath34 is a complex matrix with the property that @xmath35 .",

    "let us now turn to lepton asymmetry : the formula for primordial lepton asymmetry in this case , caused by right handed neutrino decay is @xmath41 ^ 2_{1j}}{(\\tilde{y}_\\nu \\tilde{y}^{\\dagger}_\\nu)_{11 } } f(\\frac{m_1}{m_j } ) \\label{nl}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath42 is defined in a basis where righthanded neutrinos are mass eigenstates and their masses are denoted by @xmath43 where @xmath44$]@xcite . in the case where that the right handed neutrinos have a hierarchical mass pattern i.e. @xmath45 , we get @xmath46 . in this approximation , we can write the lepton asymmetry in a simple form@xcite @xmath47_{11}}{v^2(\\tilde{y}_\\nu \\tilde{y}^{\\dagger}_\\nu)_{11 } } \\label{buch}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where using the expression for @xmath29 given above , we can rewrite @xmath1 as : @xmath48_{11}}{v^2|r(z_{ij}){\\cal m}_\\nu r^{\\dagger}(z_{ij})|^2_{11 } } \\label{buch1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    we will now apply this discussion to calculate the lepton asymmetry in the general case without any symmetries . in the following sections , we follow it up with a discussion of two cases : ( i ) the cases of exact @xmath0 symmetry and ( ii ) the case where this symmetry is only approximate . since the formula in eq .",
    "( 9 ) assumes that there are three right handed neutrinos , we will focus on this case in the next two sections . in a subsequent section ,",
    "we consider the case of two right handed neutrinos @xmath49 , which transform into each other under the @xmath0 symmetry .",
    "both cases are in agreement with the observed neutrino mass differences and mixings .",

    "to make a prediction for the lepton asymmetry , we need to the lengths of the complex quantities @xmath53 .",
    "the out of equilibrium condition does provide a constraint on @xmath54 as follows : @xmath55 it is clear from eq .",
    "( 13 ) that if neutrinos are quasidegenerate i.e. @xmath56 , then using eq . ( 11 ) , we find that the left hand side of eq .",
    "( 13 ) has a lower bound of @xmath57 which is clearly much bigger than the right hand side of the inequality . defining @xmath58",
    ", this means that @xmath59 .",
    "this implies that the right handed neutrinos decays are in equilibrium at @xmath60 .",
    "this will cause dilution of the lepton asymmetry generated with the dilution factor given by @xmath61 . using a parameterization for the dilution factor @xmath62@xcite",
    ", we get @xmath63 which will make the baryon to photon ratio much too small . based on this argument",
    ", we conclude that a degenerate mass spectrum with @xmath64 ev will most likely be in conflict with observations , if type i seesaw is responsible for neutrino masses .",
    "it must however be noted that a more appealing and natural scenario for degenerate neutrino masses is type ii seesaw formula@xcite , in which case the above considerations do not apply .",
    "therefore , it is not possible to conclude based on the leptogenesis argument alone that a quasi - degenerate neutrino spectrum is inconsistent .    in a hierarchical neutrino mass picture ,",
    "( 13 ) implies that @xmath65 and @xmath66 .",
    "if we assume that the upper limit in the eq.[equ1 ] is saturated , then we get the atmospheric neutrino mass difference square in eq.[for1 ] to give the dominant contribution .",
    "we will see below that if one assumes an exact @xmath0 symmetry for the neutrino mass matrix , the situation becomes different and it is the solar mass difference square that dominates .",
    "in this section , we consider the case of three right handed neutrino with an exact @xmath0 symmetry in the dirac mass matrix as well as the right handed neutrino mass matrix . in this case , the right handed neutrino mass matrix @xmath30 and the dirac yukawa coupling @xmath29 can be written respectively as : @xmath67 where @xmath68 and @xmath69 are all complex .",
    "an important property of these two matrices is that they can be cast into a block diagonal form by the same transformation matrix @xmath70 on the @xmath71 s and @xmath72 s .",
    "let us denote the block diagonal forms by a tilde i.e. @xmath42 and @xmath73 .",
    "we then go to a basis where the @xmath73 is subsequently diagonalized by the most general @xmath74 unitary matrix as follows : @xmath75 where @xmath76 where @xmath77 is the most general @xmath74 unitary matrix given by @xmath78 .",
    "the @xmath79 case therefore reduces to a @xmath74 problem .",
    "the third mass eigenstate in both the light and the heavy sectors play no role in the leptogenesis as well as generation of solar mixing angle@xcite .",
    "note also that we have @xmath80 .",
    "the seesaw formula in the 1 - 2 subsector has exactly the same form except that all matrices in the left and right hand side of eq .",
    "( 9 ) are @xmath74 matrices .",
    "the formula for the dirac yukawa coupling in this case can be inverted to the form : @xmath81 where @xmath82 . using this",
    ", we can cast @xmath1 in the form : @xmath83 this could also have been seen from eq.([for1 ] ) by realizing that for the case of exact @xmath0 symmetry , we have @xmath84 and @xmath85",
    ".    the above result reproduces the direct proportionality between @xmath1 and solar mass difference square found in ref.@xcite . to simplify this expression further ,",
    "let us note that out of equilibrium condition for the decay of the lightest right handed neutrino leads to the condition : @xmath86 \\leq 14 \\frac{m^2_1}{m_{p\\ell}}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which implies that @xmath87 since solar neutrino data require that in a hierarchical neutrino mass picture @xmath88 ev , in eq.([equ ] ) , we must have @xmath89 .",
    "if we parameterize @xmath90 , we recover the conclusions of ref.@xcite .",
    "this provides a different way to arrive at the conclusions of ref.@xcite .",
    "in this section , we consider the effect of breaking of @xmath0 symmetry on lepton asymmetry . within the seesaw framework ,",
    "this breaking can arise either from the dirac mass matrix for the neutrinos or from the right handed neutrino sector or both .",
    "we focus on the case , when the symmetry is broken in the right handed sector only .",
    "such a situation is easy to realize in seesaw models where the theory obeys exact @xmath0 symmetry at high scale ( above the seesaw scale ) prior to b - l symmetry breaking as we show in a subsequent section .",
    "we will also show that in this case there is a simple generalization of the lepton asymmetry formula that we derived in the exact @xmath0 symmetric case @xcite symmetric model where the dirac yukawa coupling has the form @xmath91 has been discussed in ref.@xcite .",
    "our discussion applies more generally . ] .    in this case",
    "the neutrino yukawa matrix is given in the mass eigenstates basis of the right handed neutrinos by @xmath92 where @xmath93 is the neutrino dirac matrix in the flavor basis ; the notation @xmath94 denotes a unitary @xmath74 matrix in the @xmath95 subspace . in the above equation , @xmath96 .",
    "now if we substitute for @xmath97 the expression in eq .",
    "[ ynu ] and use maximal mixing for the atmospheric neutrino we obtain @xmath98 =   v_{1/3}m^{1/2}_r   r_{1/2}r_{1/3}m^{1/2}_{\\nu}u_{1/2}^{+}u_{1/3}^{+}\\ ] ]    since the @xmath0 symmetry breaking is assumed to be small and from reactor neutrino experiments @xmath99 we will expand the mixing matrices in the @xmath100 subspace to first order in mixing parameter : @xmath101 where @xmath102\\ ] ] to first order in @xmath103 , @xmath104 and @xmath8 we have @xmath105 it is straight forward to show that the perturbation parameters should satisfy the following equations @xmath106 where @xmath107 are the matrix elements of @xmath108 and @xmath109 and @xmath110 are the sine and cosine of the solar neutrino mixing angle .",
    "hence one can see that the parameter @xmath104 is proportional to the @xmath8 neutrino mixing angle and is given to first order by @xmath111\\theta_{13}e^{-i\\delta}c_{\\theta}\\ ] ] this proves that the matrix element @xmath112 that goes into the leptogenesis formula is directly proportional to the physically observable parameter @xmath8 .",
    "this enables us to write @xmath113 .",
    "a consequence of this is that if the coefficient of proportionality is chosen to be of order one , then as experimental upper limit goes down , unlike the generic type i seesaw case in section ii , the solar mass difference square starts to dominate for the lma solution to the solar neutrino problem .",
    "in this section , we consider the case of two right handed neutrinos which transform into one another under @xmath0 symmetry .",
    "the leptogenesis in this model with exact @xmath0 symmetry was discussed in @xcite and was shown that it vanishes . in this model",
    "therefore , a vanishing or very tiny @xmath8 would not provide a viable model for leptogenesis . turning this argument around , enough leptogenesis should provide a lower limit on the value of @xmath8 .    to set the stage for our discussion ,",
    "let us first review the argument for the exact @xmath0 symmetry case@xcite .",
    "the symmetry under which @xmath114 and @xmath115 whereas the @xmath116 constrains the general structure of @xmath117 and @xmath118 as follows : @xmath119 in order to calculate the lepton asymmetry using eq.(7 ) , we first diagonalize the righthanded neutrino mass matrix and change the @xmath29 to @xmath42 .",
    "since @xmath118 is a symmetric complex @xmath74 matrix , it can be diagonalized by a transformation matrix @xmath120 i.e. @xmath121 where @xmath122 are complex numbers . in this basis",
    "we have @xmath123 .",
    "we can therefore rewrite the formula for @xmath124 as @xmath125 ^ 2_{12 } f(\\frac{m_1}{m_2})\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] now note that @xmath126 has the form @xmath127 which can be diagonalized by the matrix @xmath128 .",
    "therefore it follows that @xmath129 .",
    "let us now introduce @xmath0 symmetry breaking . if we introduce a small amount of @xmath0 breaking in the right handed neutrino sector as follows : we keep the @xmath29 symmetric but choose the right handed neutrino mass matrix as : @xmath130 after the right handed neutrino mass matrix is diagonalized , the @xmath131 @xmath132 takes the form ( for @xmath133 and in the basis where the light neutrino masses are diagonal ) : @xmath134 here @xmath135 are of order one and @xmath136 .",

    "it is clear that very small values for @xmath8 will lead to unacceptably small @xmath1 . in fig . 1 , we have plotted @xmath141 against @xmath8 for values of the parameters in the model that fit the oscillation data and find a lower bound on @xmath142 for two different values of the cp phases ( figure 1 ) . in this figure , we have chosen , @xmath143 gev .",
    "for higher values of @xmath144 the allowed range @xmath8 moves to the lower range . also we note that for values of @xmath145 gev , the baryon asymmetry becomes lower than the observed value .",
    "vrs @xmath8 for the case of two right handed neutrinos with approximate @xmath0 symmetry and cp phases @xmath146 and @xmath147 .",
    "the values of @xmath8 are predicted to be 0.1 and 0.15 respectively .",
    "the horizontal line corresponds to @xmath148@xcite . ]",
    "in this section , we present a simple extension of the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) by adding to it specific high scale physics that at low energies can exhibit @xmath0 symmetry in the neutrino sector as well as real dirac masses for neutrinos .",
    "first we recall that mssm needs to be extended by the addition of a set of right handed neutrinos ( either two or three ) to implement the seesaw mechanism for neutrino masses@xcite .",
    "we will accordingly add three right handed neutrinos @xmath149 to mssm .",
    "we then assume that at high scale , the theory has @xmath0 @xmath150 symmetry under which @xmath151 are even and odd combinations ; similarly , we have for leptonic doublet superfields @xmath152 and leptonic singlet ones @xmath153 ; two pairs of higgs doublets ( @xmath154 and @xmath155 ) , and a singlet superfields @xmath156 .",
    "other superfields of mssm such as @xmath157 as well as quarks are even under the @xmath0 @xmath150 symmetry .",
    "now suppose that we write the superpotential involving the @xmath158 fields as follows : @xmath159 then when we give high scale vevs to @xmath160 , then below the high scale there are only the usual mssm higgs pair @xmath161 and @xmath162 that survive whereas the other pair becomes superheavy and decouple from the low energy lagrangian . the effective coupling at the mssm level is then given by : @xmath163 note that the @xmath0 symmetry is present in the dirac neutrino mass matrix whereas it is not in the charged lepton sector as would be required to .",
    "we show below that it is possible to have a high scale supersymmetric theory which would lead to real dirac yukawa couplings ( @xmath164 ) if we require the high scale theory to be left - right symmetric . to show how this comes about , consider the gauge group to be @xmath165 with quarks and leptons assigned to left and right handed doublets as usual@xcite i.e. @xmath166 , @xmath167 ; @xmath168 and @xmath169 ; higgs fields @xmath170 ; @xmath171 ; @xmath172 ; @xmath173 and @xmath174 . the new point specific to our model",
    "is that we have two sets of the higgs fields with the above quantum numbers , one even and the other odd under the @xmath0 @xmath150 permutation symmetry i.e. @xmath175 , @xmath176 , @xmath177 , @xmath178 and @xmath179 ( plus for fields even under @xmath150 and @xmath180 for fields odd under @xmath150 . )",
    "furthermore , we will impose the parity symmetry under which @xmath181 , @xmath182 , @xmath183 ) , @xmath184 .",
    "the higgs sector of the low energy superpotential is determined from this theory after left - right gauge group is broken down to the standard model gauge group by the vev s of @xmath187 .",
    "the phenomenon of doublet - doublet spitting leaves only two higgs doublets out of the four in @xmath188 and is determined by a generic superpotential of type @xmath189 where @xmath190 go over @xmath191 and @xmath180 for even and odd and only even terms are allowed by @xmath0 invariance e.g. @xmath192 are nonzero .",
    "now suppose that @xmath193 but @xmath194 and @xmath195 .",
    "these vevs break the left - right group to the standard model gauge group .",
    "it is then easy to see that below the @xmath196 scale , there are only one higgs pair where @xmath197 and @xmath198 .",
    "here we have denoted the @xmath199 and @xmath200 .",
    "the upshot of all these discussions is that the right handed neutrino yukawa couplings are @xmath0 even and therefore have the form : @xmath201 it is easy to see that redefining the fields appropriately , we can make @xmath29 real .",
    "so the only source of complex phase in this model is in the rh neutrino mass matrix , which in this model are generated by higher dimensional couplings of the form @xmath202 as we discuss now .",
    "the most general nonrenormalizable interactions that can give rise to right handed neutrino masses are of the form : @xmath203 note that since both @xmath204 acquire vevs , the last term in the above expression will give rise to @xmath0 breaking in the rh neutrino sector while preserving it in the @xmath29 .",
    "the associated couplings in the above equations are in general complex .",
    "this leads to a realistic three generation model with approximate @xmath0 symmetry as analyzed in the previous sections .    in summary",
    ", we have studied the implications for leptogenesis in models where neutrino masses arise from the type i seesaw mechanism and where the near maximal atmospheric mixing angle owes its origin to an approximate @xmath0 symmetry .",
    "we derive a relation of the form @xmath205 for the case of three right handed neutrinos , which directly connects the neutrino oscillation parameters with the origin of matter .",
    "we also show that if @xmath8 is very small or zero , only the lma solution to the solar neutrino puzzle would provide an explanation of the origin of matter within this framework .",
    "finally for the case of two right handed neutrinos with approximate @xmath0 symmetry , we predict values for @xmath8 in the range @xmath206 for specific choices of the the high energy phase between @xmath207 and @xmath147 .",
