    "in dirac s equation @xmath5 the bose field @xmath6 is a member of the clifford algebra @xmath0 hence it can be written as @xmath7 here @xmath8 are matrices which act on the flavors and colors of @xmath2 ( the dirac field for leptons and quarks ) . in the excellently verified standard model , the _ matrices _ @xmath9 contain all the fields of higgs and yang - mills .",
    "vice versa , the standard model requires ( [ onetwo ] ) to contain the 10 basis elements @xmath10 but not the further @xmath1 or @xmath11 ( 6 of which are linearly independent ) .",
    "thus we encounter the question , to what extent ( [ onetwo ] ) can involve @xmath12 for this problem it is irrelevant whether @xmath13 is a separate ` tensor potential ' or a multiple of maxwell s @xmath14 ( as proposed by pauli @xcite ) or of its dual @xmath15 hence we always call @xmath16 the ` pauli term ' of ( [ onetwo ] ) . in rigorous , but not trivial ways , we find that @xmath13 must be _ absent _ for a very basic reason : for the members @xmath17 of any * -algebra and their conjugates @xmath18 one postulates @xmath19 this would be violated by any pauli term .",
    "hence we must demand @xmath20 in other words , our fields will not generate a * -algebra , unless ( [ onetwo ] ) is _ restricted _ by ( [ onefour ] ) .",
    "this clear result has not been found in the literature , because a familiar reciprocity @xcite is generally misnamed a theorem , whereas we prove it to be a _ condition _ , which excludes ( [ onetwo ] ) unless it satisfies ( [ onefour ] ) .",
    "showing in sections [ sec2 ] and [ sec3 ] the adopted foundations , we indicate the proof of ( [ onefour ] ) briefly in section [ sec4 ] , and more elaborately in appendix [ appa ] .",
    "it rests on a reciprocity _ condition _ , which is discussed in appendix [ appb ] . calling this a ` relation ' @xcite",
    ", one generally suggests that it holds without restricting the bose fields to be prescribed . that misnomer may have caused the absence of ( [ onefour ] ) in the literature .      for the vector field from ( [ onethree ] ) we must admit the gauge transformation @xmath21 . \\label{twoone}\\ ] ] in order to state that @xmath22 and @xmath23 are _ hermitian _ matrices , we write them @xmath24 while the constant matrices @xmath25 act on flavors and colors , they contain all coupling constants and the @xmath26 from dirac s clifford algebra @xmath0 we generate this @xmath4 by @xmath27 from @xmath28 a transformation similar to the homogeneous part of ( [ twoone ] ) follows for the @xmath29 of ( [ onethree ] ) . in order to prove ( [ onefour ]",
    ") , however , we must initially use ( [ onetwo ] ) with ( [ onethree ] ) in the form @xmath30 this together with @xmath31 will in section [ sec4 ] yield a contradiction , which then proves ( [ onefour ] ) .",
    "that proof holds in quantum induction @xcite where the canonical relations @xmath32}_+ \\delta(x^0 ) = \\delta(x ) \\quad \\text{and } \\quad { \\left [ \\psi(x),\\psi(0)^t\\right]}_+ \\delta(x^0 ) = 0 \\label{twofive}\\ ] ] together with dirac s equation ( [ oneone ] ) are _ fundamental_. its possible validity under presumptions different from ( [ oneone ] ) through ( [ onethree ] ) is discussed in appendix [ appb ] .      for the bilocal ,",
    "time ordered dirac matrix @xmath33 ( [ oneone ] ) and ( [ twofive ] ) provide the differential equation @xmath34 where @xmath35 with @xmath36 the representation used here for @xmath37 follows directly from the familiar @xmath38 writing ( [ twosix ] ) as @xmath39 let us anticipate that the @xmath40 can be made _ homogeneous _ in the sense that @xmath41 also using the ` taylor representation ' @xmath42 we can split ( [ twoseven ] ) into @xmath43 here the dots symbolize infinitely many unknown terms ; they will be irrelevant because they are not more singular than @xmath44 ( for @xmath45 at @xmath46 .",
    "as one easily verifies , ( [ threefour ] ) with ( [ twofour ] ) can be solved by @xmath47 this clearly satisfies ( [ threetwo ] ) and due to appendix [ appa ] is the _ only _ solution of ( [ threefour ] ) which does so .",
    "since it makes the right side of ( [ threefive ] ) homogeneous in @xmath48 of the order @xmath49 we can choose also @xmath50 to obey ( [ threetwo ] ) .",
    "on the right side of ( [ threesix ] ) , we have omitted terms which due to ( [ threeseven ] ) are as homogeneous as @xmath44 ( or less singular ) .",
    "thus ( [ threesix ] ) can be solved by an @xmath51 which ( due to @xmath52 satisfies @xmath53 therefore , we can include in @xmath51 those terms from @xmath54 and @xmath55 which are left arbitrary by ( [ threefour ] ) and ( [ threefive ] ) because they are independent of @xmath56 in order to learn much more about @xmath57 than ( [ threeeight ] ) shows , one would need ` outer ' boundary conditions ( at large @xmath58 these could be obtained from heat kernels ( hk ) ; but here the ` inner ' condition ( by ( [ twofive ] ) giving to ( [ twoseven ] ) its right side ) has been sufficient .    no obstruction to _ solving",
    "_ ( [ twoseven ] ) has been encountered in ( [ threeseven ] ) or in appendix [ appa ] .",
    "neither would any arise if we would extend our recursion for ( [ threeone ] ) or invoke hk@xcite .",
    "taking the dirac adjoint of ( [ twosix ] ) , however , we obtain the ` reciprocity ' condition @xmath59 the latter exemplifies a general rule for * -algebras .",
    "the @xmath60 in ( [ threenine ] ) removes the denominators of the terms in ( [ threeone ] ) , so that the hermitian conjugation affects only their _",
    "numerators_. hence these must ( for @xmath61 satisfy @xmath62 because all three are linearly independent . in ( [ fourone ] )",
    "we did not mention the leading @xmath63 of ( [ threeone ] ) , because it satisfies ( [ threenine ] ) trivially . since ( [ twofour ] ) equals its adjoint @xmath64 that reciprocity is also verified for ( [ threeseven ] ) .    instead of ( [ fourone ] ) with @xmath65 however , in appendix [ appa ] we find",
    "@xmath66 hence it is _ misleading _ when one calls ( [ threenine ] ) a reciprocity ` theorem ' @xcite , as if it were fulfilled for arbitrarily prescribed bose fields ( [ twofour ] ) .",
    "since ( [ threeseven ] ) satisfies ( [ fourone ] ) even with @xmath67 we also see that ( [ onefour ] ) can not be derived as long as one only examines that solution of ( [ threefour ] ) . in other words",
    ", we do not know a way of reaching the conclusion ( [ onefour ] ) without noting that the solution of ( [ threefive ] ) provides ( [ fourthree ] ) .    by ( [ onefour ] ) , however , the @xmath50 solving ( [ threefive ] ) is simplified greatly ; and the further parts of ( [ threeone ] ) are _ shortened _ still more drastically .",
    "hence superfluous work is done by those who pursue higher terms of ( [ threeone ] ) without inserting ( [ onefour ] ) quickly .",
    "they solve the differential equation ( [ twoseven ] ) correctly but in excessive generality .",
    "thus they miss the fact that ( [ twosix ] ) must also satisfy ( [ threenine ] ) , which is a non - trivial condition not expressed by ( [ twoseven ] ) .",
    "in ( [ twoseven ] ) we have used @xmath68 where @xmath69 with @xmath36 these obviously provide @xmath70 which are derived most _ easily _ , when one uses ( [ a1 ] ) as often as possible .",
    "thus ( [ threeseven ] ) makes @xmath71 so that ( [ threefour ] ) with ( [ twofour ] ) is fulfilled .",
    "all these calculations of course do not make sense on the cone @xmath72 hence throughout this paper we assume @xmath73 , as we must clearly do in ( [ threeone ] ) through ( [ threesix ] ) .",
    "this is also true for the _ limits _ with @xmath74 as needed in ( [ threeeight ] ) and in the proof of ( [ a1 ] ) .",
    "hence such limit transitions can proceed on any path which ends at @xmath75 except that it must not touch the cone @xmath72    while ( [ threefour ] ) with ( [ twofour ] ) is due to ( [ a1 ] ) satisfied by ( [ threeseven ] ) , its most general solution follows when we add any matrix @xmath76 which fulfills the homogeneous dirac equation @xmath77 for choosing this @xmath76 we need the    * singularity theorem * : every poincar covariant member @xmath76 of dirac s clifford algebra @xmath78 which solves @xmath79 becomes for @xmath45 with @xmath80 either more singular than @xmath81 or less than @xmath82 hence yields either @xmath83 one proves this easily when @xmath76 depends only on @xmath56 the general proof is lengthy and scarcely of interest to physicists ; hence we shall show it whenever requested .",
    "obvious solutions of ( [ a4 ] ) and ( [ a5 ] ) are all @xmath76 which do not depend on @xmath56 already the solution of ( [ threefour ] ) by ( [ threeseven ] ) says that ( [ threetwo ] ) with @xmath84 can be satisfied .",
    "the theorem ( [ a5 ] ) proves that ( [ threeseven ] ) yields the only @xmath85 which does so ( such that ( [ threefour ] ) and ( [ threetwo ] ) make ( [ threeseven ] ) necessary )",
    ". it also shows that the leading term of ( [ threeone ] ) is determined uniquely . in the same way , ( [ a5 ] )",
    "says that the solution of ( [ threefive ] ) and ( [ threetwo ] ) will be _ unique _ when such a @xmath50 can be found at all .      inserting ( [ twofour ] ) and ( [ threeseven ] ) in ( [ threefive ] ) , we obtain @xmath86 with @xmath87 } = - i \\sigma^{\\mu\\nu } =   \\gamma^\\mu \\gamma^\\nu - \\eta^{\\mu\\nu}.$ ] here all the fields @xmath88 and their partial derivatives are localized at @xmath89 ; hence this parameter has been suppressed in the notation . although ( [ a6 ] ) is for @xmath55 a linear differential equation in @xmath48 of the _ first _ order , deriving a solution was tedious ; but after such a @xmath55 has been found , only differentiations are needed to verify its validity .",
    "only a few readers , however , would perform this extremely easy but time - consuming task ; thus let us merely say that the @xmath50 solving the differential equation ( [ a6 ] ) is twice as lengthy as this .",
    "it implies ( [ fourthree ] ) and thus contradicts ( [ fourone ] ) , _ unless _ all 5 local field polynomials @xmath90\\mu}\\right]_+ ,   \\notag \\\\ { \\mathcal{z}}^2_{\\rho\\sigma\\tau } & : = { \\mathcal{t}}_{[\\rho\\sigma } \\overline{\\mv}_{\\tau ] } + \\mv_{[\\tau } { \\mathcal{t}}_{\\rho\\sigma ] } ,   \\notag \\\\   { \\mathcal{z}}^3_{\\rho } & : = \\left [   \\mv^\\mu ,   { \\mathcal{t}}_{\\mu\\rho}\\right ]   \\label{twentynine } \\\\ { \\mathcal{z}}^4_{\\rho\\sigma } & : = { \\mathcal{t}}_{\\rho\\sigma}\\ms^\\dagger + \\ms { \\mathcal{t}}_{\\rho\\sigma } ,   \\notag \\\\ { \\mathcal{z}}^5_{\\rho\\sigma\\tau } & : = { \\mathcal{t}}_{\\rho\\sigma,\\tau } + i \\overline{\\mv}_{\\tau } { \\mathcal{t}}_{\\rho\\sigma } - i { \\mathcal{t}}_{\\rho\\sigma } \\mv_{\\tau } \\notag\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] satisfy @xmath91 these derivations have been rigorous , because we did not admit any approximation ( rarely possible in physics ) .",
    "our solution ( [ onefour ] ) is clearly the only which holds irrespective of @xmath29 and @xmath92 if ( [ thirty ] ) were mathematically solvable by any @xmath93 ( a case we ca nt examine exactly ) , it would restrict @xmath29 and @xmath22 in complicated and extremely unphysical ways .    within the permitted size of this paper",
    ", we ca nt show the complete proof for the necessity of ( [ thirty ] ) ; the known extension to quantum fields @xcite would enlarge it enormously .",
    "a result as simple as ( [ onefour ] ) , however , should find a much shorter proof .",
    "hence we would prefer to delay the publication until that simplicity is achieved . if we would not show the result ( [ onefour ] ) and indicate our lengthy derivation from ( [ threenine ] ) , however , it would be hard to get anyone interested in such a problem .",
    "we had to perform extensive _",
    "algebra for the derivation of @xmath50 from its differential equation ( [ a6 ] ) .",
    "still more would be required if one were to make the compact result from hk explicit .",
    "neither is needed any longer , because it is easy to verify a known solution of any differential equation , no matter how hard its integration had been . because of ( a ) , however , nobody found this tedious search worthwhile .",
    "it is fashionable , instead of the differential equation ( [ twoseven ] ) to solve a related integral equation , with an ` inner ' boundary condition given by the right side of ( [ twoseven ] ) and a purely mathematical condition at some outer boundary ( where @xmath48 is large or infinite ) . for our problem",
    ", no choice of the latter makes sense because the result ( [ thirty ] ) depends only on ( [ twoseven ] ) and its boundary condition at @xmath94 why should we use a physically irrelevant integral equation for a conclusion which is _ completely _ determined by a differential equation together with a single , well justified boundary condition ?      in many treatments by hk , not only the bose field @xmath6 but also dirac s @xmath2 is non - quantized ( or not even mentioned ) .",
    "then ( [ twoseven ] ) is regarded as an equation for a classical green function @xmath95 not related to any quantum field such as ( [ twosix ] ) . in that approach",
    ", one hardly sees whether a reciprocity ( [ threenine ] ) should be desired .    under _ infinite _ renormalizations ,",
    "( [ oneone ] ) and ( [ twofive ] ) and therefore ( [ threeone ] ) break down @xcite .",
    "hence we ca nt prove ( [ onefour ] ) in familiar settings ( although it might be true even there ) .",
    "any significant @xmath96 would damage the excellent _ verification _ of the standard model @xcite by the magnetic moment of the electron .",
    "this agreement @xcite had formerly been regarded as a brilliant confirmation of renormalized qed . under the present philosophy @xcite of ` effective ' actions",
    ", however , it is an unimportant result of imprecise measurements .",
    "instead of ( [ twosix ] ) , one often uses @xmath97 with the _ eccentric _ coordinates @xmath98 and @xmath99 these simplify ( especially under gravity ) the derivation of ( [ twoseven ] ) , but make the analysis of ( [ threenine ] ) complicated .",
    "the singularity at @xmath100 makes ( [ threeone ] ) dependent on the _ time ordering _ of ( [ twosix ] ) .",
    "hence ( [ threenine ] ) ca nt simply be written @xmath101 because an hermitian conjugation reverses the time order .",
    "the _ differential _ or integral equation for ( [ twosix ] ) can ` mathematically ' be solved @xcite without any concern about the reciprocity ( [ threenine ] ) needed in physics .",
    "however , ( [ twoseven ] ) without ( [ threenine ] ) does not exhaust the contents of ( [ twosix ] ) .",
    "the leading terms @xmath63 and @xmath85 of ( [ threeone ] ) satisfy ( [ threenine ] ) even when ( [ twofour ] ) has @xmath102 hence the _ contradiction _ between ( [ fourone ] ) and ( [ fourthree ] ) is not recognized until one also determines @xmath103    a further reason for the usual rejection of ( [ onefour ] ) may be that such a clear result deserves a _ simple _ derivation .",
    "instead our proof has required the lengthy ( but straightforward ) deduction of the differential equation ( [ a6 ] ) and its explicit solution . that @xmath50 is twice as long as ( [ a6 ] ) and therefore not shown here ; but we hope that others can simplify our arguments .    in order to examine ( [ threenine ] )",
    "completely , the reciprocity ( [ fourone ] ) should also be checked for the ` remainder ' @xmath104 analyzing those parts of it which in @xmath48 are homogenous of the orders @xmath105 and @xmath106 we have not found any restriction beyond @xmath107 ( which simplifies those parts enormously ) .",
    "our _ local _ approach ( without outer boundary conditions ) can not extend that result to all orders .",
    "this should be taken as an incentive to treat the condition ( [ threenine ] ) globally , but not as excuse for discarding our result ( [ fourthree ] ) .",
    "doing so would correspond to ignoring the singular part of a laurent series until all its orders are known .",
