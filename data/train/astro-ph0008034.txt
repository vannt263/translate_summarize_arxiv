    "a most intriguing challenge is to understand how asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) stars transform their surrounding mass - loss shells in a couple of thousand years into the variety of shapes and sizes observed in planetary nebulae ( pne ) .",
    "there are a number of theories currently being investigated . in the generalized interacting stellar wind model , a variety of axisymmetric pn shapes",
    "are obtained by the interaction of a very fast central star wind with the progenitor agb circumstellar envelope ( kwok @xcite ) , when the latter is denser near the equator than the poles ( frank et al .",
    "sahai & trauger ( @xcite ) proposed that the primary agent for shaping pne is not the density contrast , but a high speed collimated outflow of a few 100 km / s .",
    "no consensus about the dominant physical process responsible for the shaping of pne has emerged so far , but there is agreement that they occur during the early agb - to - pn transition stage . however , details of the rate of evolution , the strength of the stellar wind , and the impact of ionization across the transition phase are very poorly known . in order to test model predictions it is essential to study nebulae from the early post - agb phase through the very early pn phases .",
    "however , post - agb objects are difficult to find , because this phase is very short and the star is usually obscured by a thick circumstellar dust shell .",
    "one way of identifying new post - agb stars is through their dust emission . in our search for new obscured pne and post - agb stars , we selected candidates from the _ iras _  point source catalogue based on infrared colors typical of pne .",
    "when we observed these candidates in the radio continuum at 6  cm , on average 20  % of the objects were detected ( van de steene & pottasch @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "subsequent optical spectroscopy showed that the pn candidates detected in the radio have emission line spectra typical of pne ( van de steene et al .",
    "@xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "however , the question remained : what is the evolutionary status of those _ iras _",
    "sources with colors typical of pne , which had no detectable ionization in the radio ( i.e. fluxes below 3  mjy ) ?",
    "it is possible that a few large , low surface - brightness pne have escaped detection .",
    "others of the remaining non - identified pn candidates could be very young and small pne .",
    "their radio flux would have been below our detection threshold and they would nt be identified in h@xmath0 due to extinction . however , the true evolutionary status of most objects with _ iras _",
    "colors typical of pne has remained unknown .",
    "we have calculated evolutionary tracks for post - agb stars in the _ iras _  color - color diagram ( van hoof et al .",

    ", it became clear that post - agb objects and pne could be located in the same region in the _ iras _",
    "color - color diagram .",
    "no other types of objects seem to have typically these particular _ iras _  colors .",
    "we therefore adopted the working hypothesis that the non - detected pn candidates are agb - to - pn transition objects .",
    "the goal of this project is to determine the evolutionary status of these post - agb candidates , their physical properties , and to relate them to their morphology .    to ensure the identification of the correct counterpart of the _ iras_source and obtain accurate positions for follow - up observations , we first imaged the post - agb candidates in the _ n_-band . in order to investigate whether the sources have some ionization",

    "all emission line sources have a strong underlying continuum , unlike normal pne . in another three objects no clear br@xmath1  absorption or emission was visible .      as noted in sect .",
    "[ radiobs ] , the predicted optically - thin radio flux values ( assuming case  b recombination ) appear to be at least a factor of ten higher than the observational flux limits for the post - agb objects .",
    "this indicates that for these objects either the radio flux is optically thick at 3  cm , or the case  b assumption is not valid .    after a star leaves the agb , its mass loss decreases by several orders of magnitude while simultaneously the velocity of the wind increases .",
    "hence the star will be surrounded by an increasingly more tenuous wind inside a detached agb shell . at first",
    "the star will be too cool to cause any significant ionization , either in the wind or in the agb shell .",
    "however , as the stellar temperature increases , ionization will start and the ionization front will steadily move outwards .",
    "this will also be the case for the radius at which the 3  cm radiation becomes optically thick ( for brevity we will call this the 3  cm radius , @xmath7 ) .",
    "optically thick radio emission from a sphere of radius @xmath7 and a temperature t@xmath8 gives a flux density at frequency @xmath9 of    @xmath10 where d is the distance to the star .    using this approximation we calculated that @xmath11 3@xmath12  cm , assuming @xmath13 0.7  mjy , @xmath14  = @xmath15  k , and @xmath16  = 1  kpc .",
    "this upper limit is similar to the size knapp et al.(@xcite ) determined for the post - agb stars crl  915 ( @xmath170.30  mjy ) and _ iras _  17423@xmath31755 ( @xmath170.44  mjy ) using the same assumptions .",
    "as long as the ionization front has not reached the agb shell , the 3  cm radius will not change much , because the outer regions in the @xmath18 density profile contribute very little to the optical depth , and consequently the radio flux will remain very low .",
    "however , once the post - agb star reaches a temperature hot enough to ionize the agb shell , the 3  cm radius will quickly increase by roughly two orders of magnitude , causing a dramatic increase in radio flux .",
    "this marks the onset of the pn phase . as an example , the sizes of the young pne crl  618 and _ iras _  21282 + 5050 measured by knapp et al .",
    "( @xcite ) are a factor 10 larger than the sizes of post - agb star nebulae .",
    "their radio flux values , 67  mjy and 4.3  mjy respectively , are well above our detection limit .    in our post - agb star candidates with br@xmath1  in emission",
    ", the ionized region where the emission originates must be very small and dense . probably , the agb shell of our objects is not yet ionized , but the post - agb wind could be .",
    "the br@xmath1  spectra are unresolved at a resolution of @xmath19150  kms@xmath20",
    ". hence the wind velocity could nt be much larger than this value .",
    "evidence for a wind emanating from some of these central stars was presented in van de steene et al .",
    "( @xcite ) .",
    "one of the well - established characteristics of post - agb stars is that their spectral energy distributions ( seds ) have a ` double - peaked ' shape .",
    "the two peaks in the spectrum correspond to the stellar and dust emission components .",

    "the mass loss rate during the superwind phase is very high . at the end of this phase",

    "however , we need to be cautious about such an interpretation because of the combined effects of many unknowns . the time it takes for the envelope to become optically thin will depend upon the mass loss rate at the tip of the agb , the wind velocity , and the distribution of the mass in the circumstellar shell .",
    "if the agb star had a non - spherical mass loss concentrated towards the equator , the central star could be visible along polar directions , while being completely obscured in equatorial directions . hence , the observed amount of circumstellar extinction will depend on the viewing angle ( soker @xcite ) .",
