    "the different physical mechanisms were being discussed for explanation of thunderstorm related neutron production , but the nature this phenomenon still remains unknown .",
    "recently we reported our first measurements of neutron emission originated by atmospheric lightning like discharge in a laboratory installation  @xcite .",
    "experiments were carried out inside an electric field with the average strength of the order of @xmath11  mv@xmath2m@xmath3 and with neutron detectors of two independent kinds : the cr-39 type tracers and the plastic scintillators .",
    "the neutrons were registered within the range from thermal energies up to the energies above 10  mev .",
    "it was found that the neutron generation takes place at the initial phase of electric discharge and is correlated with generation of x - ray radiation .",

    "it was found that the flash of hard x - rays generated by discharge is not always accompanied by any appearance of neutron signal as well as both the single and multiple neutron pulses were recorded which do not overlap with any x - ray pulses at all . in some rather rare events the neutron pulses appear at the final stage of discharge , when the voltage has just fell down to zero , or even after polarity change of accelerating voltage , and do not correlate with any x - ray radiation .",
    "experiments were held with a high current electron accelerator erg destined for investigation of the high - voltage discharge in the air  @xcite .",
    "the main characteristics of generated discharge and procedure of electrophysical diagnostics were the same as in the measurements described in @xcite .",

    "the current pulse amplitude was about 1012  ka , and the total duration of pulses was about @xmath13501000  ns , in dependence on the gap width . in successive experimental series",
    "were used the electrodes of different configurations : the cathode and anode of hemispherical shape , 80  mm and 90  mm in diameter , and the semispherical @xmath790  mm mesh anode in combination with cathode needle .",

    "ii _ was used to measure the weakening of radiation intensity and to estimate its energy in supposition if all generated emission is considered as gamma rays . in second position",
    "all sd were located in one vertical plane 900  mm aside of discharge axis , and the detector sd3 was placed between sd1 and sd2 .",
    "all three scintillation detectors were calibrated with a standard x - ray source rina  @xcite and have approximately one and the same sensitivity relative to electromagnetic radiation .",
    "x - ray tube of ima6 d type powered by 0.15  j pulses with peak voltage of 100  kv .",
    "angular divergence of x - rays is 30@xmath14 , the pulse duration is about 10  ns with repetition rate of 8  hz .",
    "the diameter of the effective focal spot is 2.5  mm .    for continuous ( not pulsed ) mode estimation their registration efficiency relative to neutron flux",
    "the scintillation detectors were irradiated by a @xmath15cf neutron source with overall yield of @xmath16  neutrons per second . in the case where the source is placed in the center point of the scintillator plane the detection efficiency of the detector was 0.17 .",
    "when the scintillation detector was placed inside a 10-cm lead box and the source was at the anode ( at a distance of about 0.5  m ) scintillator can not record signal ( background level ) because of small average intensity of neutron flux from the source .    as an alternative and independent method of neutron registration in the present experiment",
    "was applied the multichannel detector on ionization neutron counters .",
    "this detector is based on the @xmath0he - filled neutron counters of snm-18 type which were operating in proportional mode .",
    "twelve @xmath17@xmath18  cm counters together with all necessary electronics were put into a 2  mm thick duraluminium casing covered by the discharge ( front ) side with a 7  cm thick paraffin layer for moderation of anticipated neutrons .",
    "the total area of the neutron detection block is 1000  @xmath19 ; the counters are filled with the pure @xmath0he gas under the pressure of 2  atm .",

    "[ fig:1 ] , with its front moderator cover being turned against the generator .",
    "the pulses from all neutron counters were recorded separately , so the average intensity of neutron flux could be calculated as a sum of these counts .",
    "when using the ionization counters based detectors in the vicinity of a powerful electrical installation , it is a general problem to suppress the strong electromagnetic interference on their counts from the nearby electric discharges . therefore , the neutron counters together with their signal acquisition electronics were especially locked inside an electrically shielded volume .",
    "also , in a part of experiments the whole counter assembly was placed inside an additional tight box of welded 3  mm thick iron , and in this position another 43  mm thick layer of light material ( perplex )  a neutron reflector  was put against the back ( opposite to discharge generator ) side of the counter case .",

    "counters assembly occurred to be 0.076% , and with the source in anode region  0.12% .    besides these experimental measurements , efficiency of neutron registration was defined in complete simulation of the neutron propagation process both inside the neutron detectors and in surrounding materials with the use of geant4 toolkit  @xcite .",
    "for the purpose , three detector models were built which took into account specific features of detector set - ups used in reality ( see the fig .",
    "[ geantmodels ] ) .",
    "the model  _ i _ corresponds to the typical configuration of sd1 scintillation detector : a @xmath8  cm@xmath0 plastic scintillator block surrounded by 10 cm thick lead walls . in the model  _",
    "ii _ a set of 12 @xmath0he filled cylindrical `` counters '' having the size of a real snm-18 type detector ( 3  cm in diameter and 30  cm long ) were put into a box of al material with a 7  cm thick paraffin moderator layer placed at its front side . in model",
    "_ iii _ this counter assembly was supplemented with a backward neutron reflector of 4  cm thick perspex , and the whole set - up was placed inside a solid metallic box of a 3  mm thick iron sheets .",
    "the particle physics module of simulation program took into consideration the following processes of neutron interaction : the geant4 models of elastic coincidences in the range from thermal energies ( of the order of @xmath20  ev ) up to 4  ev , so as the elastic coincidence models of the intermediate ( 4  ev20  mev ) and high - energy neutrons ( above 20  mev ) ; the models of inelastic interaction in the ranges of thermal , intermediate and high energies ; the models of radiative neutron capture .",
    "for the protons , besides analogous processes of their elastic and inelastic interactions the models of multiple scattering and ionization losses were considered ; and for the positive and negative pions the decay process ( the physics of negative pions included also the process of their absorption at rest ) .",
    "the fact of neutron registration was signalled either by appearance of any charged particle ( mostly , a recoil proton ) with the energy above 0.5  mev inside the scintillator volume of the model  _ i _ , or by a @xmath0h nucleus born inside the volume of any neutron counter for the case of models  _ ii _ and  _ iii _ ( correspondingly to nuclear reaction @xmath21he",
    "@xmath22h which is used in the real snm-18 type detectors ) . in turn , the overall efficiency of neutron registration was defined as a relation of the number of `` registered '' neutrons to the total number of primary particles put into simulation .",
    "three distribution variants of primary neutron particles were accepted in simulation series for every detector model  _ i _ , _ ii _ , and  _ iii_. in first turn , a parallel beam of monoenergetic primary neutrons was falling on center point of detector front perpendicularly to its surface ( an ideal case of primary geometry and upper limit of possible registration efficiency ) . in second ( intermediate ) variant the position of primary neutrons was randomly selected on the front surface while their momenta remain always perpendicular to it . in the third ( realistic ) simulation",
    "the primary neutrons were emitted with isotropic direction distribution from a spherical point source displaced 70  cm apart from the front surface , similarly to geometry of real experiment were origination of neutrons is supposed to have place somewhere around electrodes of high voltage generator .",
    "a number of succeeding simulation runs with constantly increasing energies of primaries was fulfilled for every combination `` detector model / primary geometry '' , and a set of registration efficiency distributions was calculated in dependence on neutron energy .",
    "these results are presented in the fig .",
    "[ geantresults ] .",
    "as is known , the energy spectrum of neutron emission from @xmath15cf isotope fission does spread up to 13  mev with its mean value being 2.3  mev and the most probable value 1.2  mev . according to the upper frame of fig .",
    "[ geantresults ] the maximum average efficiency of neutron registration by scintillation detector in the energy range of some mev must be confined by the curves  _ 1 _ and  _ 2 _ , i.e. somewhere between 520% . for the `` realistic '' configuration of a distant isotropic neutron source the curve",
    "_ 3 _ predicts an efficiency about 0.40.5% .",
    "the simulation results made for a ionization neutron counter based detector in the middle and bottom frames of fig .  [ geantresults ] have rather irregular behaviour in mev energy range for the case of a distant point source ( the curve  _ 3 _ ) .",
    "this can be explained through manifestation of an additional neutron multiplication mechanism due to recoil process in surrounding materials around the neutron counters ; this effect starts to be feasible just around the mev energy threshold and occurs being noticeable in the curves  _ 3 _ because of their generally low efficiency level .    in the case of the neutron detector model  _",
    "ii _ the simulation predicts the mean registration efficiency about 0.15 - 0.20% for a distant primary source ( curve  _ 3 _ ) which is close to 0.12% efficiency measured with location of californium source in anode region .",
    "the presence of additional backward neutron reflector in the case of model  _ iii _ reveals itself through the increase of resulting registration efficiency up to the values of 0.30 - 0.45% .",
    "discharge development in the real - time experiment was controlled by its photographing at different angles with the use of multichannel digital photo - recorder and application of the neutral and colored optical glass filters , and trough the fast oscilloscope recording of characteristic electric parameters and radiation intensities .",
    "the fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] presents the typical time behavior of the electric current and voltage on the discharge gap , so as the intensity of 13  ghz radio - emission , optic light , ultraviolet and x - ray radiation , and neutron pulse .",
    "it is seen that the moment of x - ray pulse usually is delayed up to 200300  ns relative to the voltage jump , and coincides with the time of increasing pre - pulse current ; most often , the neutron signals do occur within the time of the x - ray radiation pulse .",
    "the lightning discharges are recorded simultaneously with neutrons and gamma radiation using scintillation detectors .",
    "detection of neutrons and/or hard gamma rays in a laboratory experiment requires a clear analysis .",
    "firstly , we have identified a strong dependence of the appearance of the hard ( neutron or gamma ) radiation from the electric field strength near the electrodes , which is determined by their form .",
    "statistics of events with the advent of x - rays and neutrons are presented in table  [ tab1 ] .",

    "although 15% is indicated in second line of table  [ tab1 ] , only 5% of pulses have its amplitude exceeding a third of maximum one .    secondly , we investigated in detail the temporal structure of the appearance of neutron pulses . in a previous paper  @xcite",
    "we noted that the momentum of the neutron radiation , the detected scintillation detector placed behind a lead shield , is correlated with the occurrence of x - ray pulse and is located within it .",
    "that is , the neutron pulse was observed in the initial `` dark '' phase of the discharge until closure of cathode and anode streamers .",
    "however , the structure of the neutron pulse was more complicated .",
    "new measurements have shown that the structure and characteristics relative arrangement pulses of x - rays and neutron radiation has been quite diverse ( fig .",
    "[ fig:4 ] ) .",
    "the emergence of x - ray radiation is not always accompanied by the appearance of neutrons ( fig .",
    "[ fig:4]a ) .",
    "the most common occurrence of neutron pulses clearly correlated with the x - rays pulse and are located inside ( fig .  [",
    "fig:4]b ) . recorded both single and binary neutron pulses inside x - ray(fig .",
    "[ fig:4]c , d ) , and near the x - ray pulses ( fig .",
    "[ fig:4]e ) . in some rare cases , the neutron pulse appears at the final stage of the discharge ( fig .",
    "[ fig:4]f ) in the absence of x - ray radiation . in most cases ,",
    "the neutron impulses occur near the peak voltage to the main phase of the discharge ( at the peak of pre - pulse current ) .    however , there are cases where the neutron pulse is generated at the beginning of the main phase ( fig .",
    "[ fig:5]a ) or at the peak of the discharge current and correlated with the x - ray pulse ( fig .  [ fig:5]b ) . in fig .  [ fig:5 ]",
    "unlike fig .",
    "[ fig:4 ] instead of initial part ( pre - pulse ) total discharge current is shown .",
    "various provisions of the neutron radiation pulse relative to the pulse voltage and discharge current leads to the assumption of possible different mechanisms of neutron generation in the initial stage of discharge ( until the end of streamer - leader stage ) and its main stage .",
    "the amplitude of the neutron signals in a variety of shots can vary by an order of magnitude .",
    "taking into account the efficiency of the neutron detection by the scintillation detector and under the conditions that the flow is isotropic spectrum and the energy does not differ greatly from the spectrum of the source @xmath15cf , maximum observed flux of fast neutrons in a single shot can be estimated at the level of up to @xmath25  neutrons in @xmath26  sr . in a shift pulse of neutron radiation with respect to the x - ray energy neutrons",
    "could be estimated under the assumption about strong correlation x - rays and neutrons .",
    "these estimates give the neutron energy at the level of a few  mev .",
    "we also used data on multiplicities weakening wide beams of gamma radiation for 10  cm protection of pb  @xcite .",
    "[ fig:6 ] shows the waveform of the pulses detected by all three scintillation detectors placed in position ii ( see fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] ) . in fig .",
    "[ fig:6]a the ratio of the amplitudes of the signal on the waveform sd3/sd1@xmath27 , ratio of the amplitudes sd2/sd1@xmath28 . with this weakening of multiplicities",
    "correspond to the energy of gamma rays e@xmath29  mev , which is more than an order of magnitude `` applied voltage '' 1  mev .",
    "since the emission spectrum is not known , an estimate gives a lower bound .",
    "of course , such a possibility can not be rejected completely , however , with high probability we can assume that this signal ( with sd1 ) is formed by fast neutrons",
    ". moreover most part of experiments with laboratory discharges give the energy of gamma rays at level of 150200  kev  @xcite . at the same time , for another shot ( fig .",
    "[ fig:6]b , which is very similar to fig .",
    "[ fig:6]a ) of this run signal from sd1 is absent , and ratio of the amplitudes sd3/sd2 @xmath30 .",
    "it corresponds to the energy of gamma rays e@xmath31  mev in all .",
    "finally for a detailed study of radiation in the initial leader - streamer or dark phase of the discharge were carried out a series of measurements in which especially not a complete discharge formed .",
    "for this purpose , the cathode is installed by radial rod of adjustable length with a groove which develops on the outer cylindrical discharge electrode system ( reversing switch ) . by varying the length of the rod , it is possible to switch the current from the main ( longitudinal ) groove on the discharge gap at a preset time interval , thus interrupting the discharge development in usual longitudinal direction .",
    "experiments on the production of integrated image of the initial phase of atmospheric discharge by interrupting the longitudinal discharge when current switching to radial discharge were carried out for two variants of electrode geometry : a cathode and an anode in the form of a hemisphere with a diameter of 90  mm and a semispherical anode and cathode needle . in the first case , it was done 96  shots , of which 34 shots x - rays with photon energies above 10  kev and only 2 pulses of neutrons have been recorded ( see table  [ tab1 ] ) . in the second series",
    "were only 20  shots . in each of these shots",
    "were recorded x - ray photons with energies above 100  kev and three shots had pulses of neutrons .",
    "therefore , we can conclude that the radiation shown in fig .",
