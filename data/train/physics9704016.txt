    "this paper develops a theoretical approach allowing one to consider pci in the wannier regime .",
    "the interest in this problem has been initiated by recent experiment @xcite followed by theoretical work @xcite in which the electron impact in the vicinity of the atomic inner shell ionization threshold @xmath0 was studied . in this reaction",
    "the inelastically scattered electron e@xmath1 and the knocked out electron e@xmath2 have low energy propagating in the coulomb field of the positive ion a@xmath3 .",
    "these low - energy electrons are known as the wannier pair .",
    "the coulomb interaction of wannier electrons between themselves as well as with the field of the ion results in the wannier power law @xcite for the cross - section @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the energy excess over the ionization threshold and the exponent @xmath6 depends non - trivially on the ion charge @xmath7 @xmath8.\\ ] ] a distinctive property of reaction ( [ 1 ] ) is the finite life - time of the inner - shell vacancy in the ion a@xmath3 .",
    "its decay @xmath9 creates the fast auger electron e@xmath10 and doubly - charged ion a@xmath11 .",
    "the fact that the pair e@xmath1 , e@xmath2 has low energy guarantees that at the moment of the decay it is situated in some close vicinity of the ion . therefore the pair should strongly interact with the products of the auger decay , _ i.e. _ the doubly charged ion and auger electron .",
    "an interaction of this type is known in literature as the post - collision interaction ( pci ) .",
    "what distinguishes reaction ( [ 1]),([2 ] ) is the fact that the wannier pair takes part in pci .",
    "previously pci was extensively studied in the near threshold region for the case when a single low - energy electron is localized in the vicinity of the atom at the moment of the autoionization decay .",
    "thus reaction ( [ 1]),([2 ] ) combines the two problems of the final state interaction , the wannier problem and pci .",
    "previously they both had been extensively studied experimentally as well as theoretically but in those situations when only one of them , either the wannier problem or pci had manifested itself in the final state .",
    "the main purpose of this paper is development of the theory describing pci in reaction ( [ 1]),([2 ] ) as well as in similar situations in electron or atomic collisions or in photoionization .",
    "one of the interesting qualitative questions arising from the reaction ( [ 1]),([2 ] ) is a possible influence of pci on the wannier power law ( [ w1 ] ) . in the field of the singly charged ion the wannier exponent ( [ ex ] ) is @xmath12 , while in the field of the doubly charged ion it is @xmath13 .",
    "if the energy of the auger electron e@xmath10 is high enough then it does not interact strongly with the pair e@xmath1,e@xmath2 and the decay could be considered as a switch of the ion charge from the intermediate - state value @xmath14 to the final - state value @xmath15 .",
    "the question is how this charge variation affects the exponent .",
    "we will demonstrate that for sufficiently low above - threshold energy the exponent is equal to @xmath16 , while for higher energies it is @xmath17 .",
    "this fact agrees with the following simple physical picture .",
    "when above - threshold energy is very low then the wannier pair is located so close to the ion at the moment of the decay that its separation is negligible compared with an important in the problem radius of the coulomb zone .",
    "therefore one can neglect this separation , neglecting as well the very fact of existence of the intermediate - state resonance .",
    "thus in this case the pair is influenced by the field of the final - state ion with the charge @xmath15 .",
    "in contrast for high above - threshold energy the wannier pair is located well outside the radius of the coulomb zone at the moment of the auger decay and therefore is not strongly influenced by the field of the doubly - charged ion .",
    "the main characteristics of the pair in this case are governed by the ion in the intermediate state with @xmath14 .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section [ wan ] gives a short introduction to the wannier problem which was theoretically studied in a number of papers . the variety of approaches developed and the comprehensive list of references can be found in @xcite - @xcite . section [ near ] presents a short review of essential ideas of pci .",
    "the literature on the theory of pci can be found in @xcite .",
    "these introductory notes permit presenting basic ideas of the two problems from a particular point of view which provides the easiest way for further development in sections [ pci ] and [ conseq ] where a way is found to describe pci when wannier electrons are involved .    generally speaking the problem considered",
    "looks very complicated being dependent on the coulomb interaction of three electrons and the ion .",
    "there are , however , important simplifications .",
    "firstly , we assume that the wannier pair possesses low energy , while the auger electron is so fast that one can neglect its interaction with the pair .",
    "this allows us to reformulate the problem in terms of the wannier pair only .",
    "still it is a dynamical three - body problem .",
    "another important simplification comes from the cornerstone of the wannier problem @xcite . in order to escape from the ionic field wannier electrons",
    "should move along a particular classical trajectory .",
    "this motion can be considered as a collective mode describing essential properties of the system .",
    "one can easily verify , see section [ wan ] , that this mode can be described in terms of an effective single - particle coulomb problem .",
    "of course there are important corrections arising from the three - body nature of the problem and making it so specific and interesting .",
    "the point is that knowing the reliable initial approximation one can find these corrections in a clear analytical form .",
    "these arguments show that one should expect the problem considered to have a clear solution .",
    "finding and describing it in simple physical terms is the major goal of this paper .",
    "the main result obtained is the formula which presents the autoionization profile @xmath18 distorted by pci in the form @xmath19 the factor @xmath20 here arises from the most simple approximation for the wannier problem described by the above mentioned effective single - particle coulomb problem . due to this reason",
    "we will call it the coulomb factor .",
    "this factor depends on the overlapping integral of the coulomb wave functions .",
    "it is interesting that a similar factor describes pci in the traditional situation when there is only one low - energy electron .",
    "the only distinction is that in the later case there is a true single - particle coulomb problem , while for the wannier pair the coulomb problem arises as an effective approximation .",
    "still the similarity is so close that one can consider the coulomb factor @xmath20 as a well known quantity which was well studied previously both experimentally and theoretically .",
    "in contrast the factor @xmath21 takes into account more subtle and interesting properties of the process which are essential for pci with the wannier pair and have no analogy in pci with one low - energy electron .",
    "due to this reason we will call it the wannier factor . in section [ conseq ] an explicit analytical formula for this factor",
    "is derived .",
    "the wannier factor found depends on the normalization coefficient of the wannier electrons wave function .",
    "it is interesting that the wannier power law ( [ w1 ] ) arises from the properties of the same coefficient considered in the region of small separations of the pair from the atom .",
    "in contrast , when pci is studied this coefficient manifests itself in a wide range of distances .",
    "this property of the profile ( [ rkr ] ) opens a possibility for experimental studies of the normalization coefficient of the wannier pair wave function in a wide area of distances .",
    "the results obtained in sections [ pci],[conseq ] are illustrated in section [ examp ] for the electron impact near - threshold k - shell excitation of ne .",
    "section [ discussion ] presents a short description of the major results .",
    "consider two low - energy electrons in the field of an ion with the charge @xmath7 .",
    "the coulomb repulsion between the electrons makes opposite directions the most favorable for them @xcite . to simplify the following consideration",
    "let us use this fact developing the following model .",
    "let us assume that the electrons are moving in opposite directions neglecting fluctuations in their angular distribution .",
    "moreover , let us neglect as well the orbital moment .",
    "thus in this model angular variables are neglected which makes it essentially one - dimensional .",
    "this model was applied earlier for description of the wannier power law @xcite .",
    "it is important that the most interesting part of the wannier problem , its instability against a non - symmetrical distribution of energy between the two electrons , is taken into account in full .",
    "moreover , we will argue in section [ discussion ] that our final results do not depend on model assumptions .",
    "one of the main advantages of the model is simplification of notation , which inevitably is to be sufficiently complicated .",
    "our strategy in this section is to first consider the classical approximation and then develop the quantum picture using the semiclassical approach which gives a correct description of the process for low above - threshold energy .",
    "the semiclassical approach to the wannier problem was developed in detail in @xcite to describe the near - threshold behaviour of the reaction ( [ 1 ] ) . in this case one",
    "is mainly interested in the behaviour of the wave function of the wannier pair for small separations .",
    "we will see that to describe pci it is necessary to know the wave function for any separation , not necessarily in the vicinity of the atom .",
    "the convenient representation for this wave function valid for an arbitrary separation is given below in equation ( [ answ ] ) which is the main result of this section .",
    "consider classically the problem of two electrons e@xmath1,e@xmath2 in the framework of the above - formulated one - dimensional model in which electrons are supposed to move in opposite directions with zero orbital moments .",
    "such a system is characterized by two radii @xmath22 .",
    "the lagrangian in these coordinates is @xmath23 where @xmath7 is the charge of the ion .",
    "it is convenient to introduce hyper - spherical coordinates @xmath24 in which @xmath25 describes the overall distance of the pair from the ion , and @xmath26 shows how strongly the pair is deviated from the symmetrical configuration @xmath27 , in which @xmath28 . in these coordinates the lagrangian is @xmath29 the potential energy @xmath30 can be looked at as a coulomb field produced by a @xmath31-dependent charge @xmath32 the function @xmath33 has a minimum for the symmetrical configuration @xmath34 .",
    "it manifests itself as a maximum at @xmath34 of the potential @xmath35 considered as a function of @xmath31 .",
    "this property of the potential is known as the wannier ridge .",
    "the ridge makes the classical system unstable .",
    "the instability results in the most important property of the wannier problem . in order to escape from the coulomb field of the ion the two electrons should propagate in the vicinity of the symmetrical configuration .",
    "otherwise one of them would be trapped by the ion field , _ i.e. _ the pair fall off the ridge .",
    "that is why the motion in the vicinity of the top of the ridge , where the pair is stable plays such an important role and is considered in detail below .    in the vicinity of @xmath28 the function @xmath33",
    "can be expanded in the taylor series @xmath36 where the coefficients are @xmath37 equation ( [ lrchi ] ) results in equations of motion @xmath38 the trajectory along the top of the wannier ridge satisfies @xmath39 the second equation coincides with the equation describing the motion of a single particle in the field of the coulomb charge @xmath40",
    ". we will refer to this motion , which plays an important role below , as an effective single - particle coulomb problem .",
    "the first integral of ( [ r0 ] ) @xmath41 describes the energy conservation law . using it one finds the ridge - top trajectory @xmath42^{1/2 } \\\\",

    "it is convenient to choose a set of basic solutions @xmath61 of ( [ dif ] ) as @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the hypergeometric function .",

    "therefore we can expand the action in powers of these variables @xmath109 where @xmath110 describes a one - dimensional motion along the ridge - top trajectory governed by the effective coulomb charge @xmath40 .",

    "our knowledge of pci properties of the traditional situation when there is only one near - threshold electron enables us to predict manifestations of pci when the wannier pair is involved .",
    "conveniently we do not even need to fulfill explicitly calculation of the overlapping integral ( [ rem ] ) which appears in ( [ r0 ] ) .",
    "inequality ( [ > ] ) guarantees that after the decay the wannier pair is located so far away from the atom that neither the coulomb charge of the ion nor repulsion between the electrons can significantly change the classical trajectory .",

    "the intensity of the line remains constant , it is not influenced by pci , @xmath332 this property is essential for the wannier problem where intensity is one of the main characteristics of the process . taking into account that the cross - section of the reaction ( [ 1 ] ) satisfies the power law ( [ w1 ] ) with the index @xmath333 we find from ( [ w1])([cs]),([gg ] ) that this law remains valid for the total intensity of the line for reaction ( [ 1]),([2 ] ) @xmath334 considered as a function of the above - threshold energy .",

    "once we have established that the eikonal theory is correct we can remove both these simplifications and include into our scheme the case of sufficiently low - energy autoionization and arbitrary directions for the wannier electrons .",

    "consider the case when the localization radius @xmath276 ( [ lo ] ) is smaller than the coulomb radius @xmath314 ( [ er ] ) @xmath337 this inequality holds for sufficiently low energies @xmath316 .",
    "this inequality means that the decay takes place when the pair is so close to the ion that the coulomb potential has a strong influence on trajectories of the wannier pair .",
    "let us examine the behaviour of the integrand in the amplitude @xmath293 in ( [ 2|1 ] ) as a function of @xmath257 .",

    "this fact justifies both the applicability of the semiclassical estimation for the phases in ( [ phase ] ) and the validity of the saddle - point approximation .",
    "these arguments demonstrate that calculating the matrix element ( [ mebb ] ) we can suppose that the main contribution to the integral comes from the vicinity of the saddle point ( [ cro ] ) .",

    "it can be verified that in order to distinguish the exponent @xmath16 from @xmath378 in the power - type behaviour of the cross - section ( [ mu2 ] ) the left - hand side in inequality ( [ cc ] ) should be really small , say , less than @xmath379 putting a severe restriction on @xmath316 .    the most important result of this subsection is ( [ pcif ] ) which describes the influence of pci on the resonance profile .",
    "this equation was evaluated assuming that energies @xmath316 are low enough to satisfy condition ( [ cc ] ) .",
    "notice , however , that the equation remains correct for much higher energies satisfying the condition of applicability of the eikonal approximation ( [ > ] ) which is opposite to the low - energy limit . to see this consider the eikonal region ( [ > ] ) in which @xmath380 . for these energies ( [ cro ] )",
    "results in @xmath381 and therefore @xmath382 . equations ( [ x1]),([x2 ] ) show that @xmath383 permitting one to use asymptotic condition ( [ 12 ] ) which shows that the wannier factor is trivial @xmath384 .",
    "therefore , in the eikonal region ( [ pcif ] ) yields @xmath385 which according to ( [ r0 ] ) is the correct result .",
    "the fact that ( [ pcif ] ) proves to be correct in both the eikonal region @xmath386 and the coulomb region @xmath387 may be considered as an indication that it should give reasonable results in the intermediate region @xmath388 as well .",
    "in order to illustrate the validity of different approximations developed above for description of pci let us consider the example studied experimentally in @xcite in which the electron impact ionization of the ne atom in the vicinity of the k - shell @xmath389 is followed by the kll auger decay @xmath390    the distortion of resonance profiles by pci is illustrated in figure 1 for above - threshold energies @xmath391 and @xmath392 ev .",
    "the width of the k - vacancy is @xmath393 mev @xcite .",
    "the profiles are calculated for the symmetric geometry of wannier electrons when they move in opposite directions possessing equal energies .",
    "notice that experimentally @xcite the spectra were measured versus the energy of the auger electron when neither energy nor angular distributions of wannier electrons were fixed .",
    "the full curve in figure 1 presents the results of calculations based on the most advanced equation ( [ pcif ] ) which , as was argued above is valid for both near - threshold and high energy regions . the factor @xmath394 ) . for numerical calculations",
    "it is more convenient to work with the real coulomb wave function @xmath395 taking a linear combination of convergent and divergent waves , rather then only the convergent wave .",
    "this is possible because the divergent wave in @xmath395 does not contribute to the resonance , see discussion before ( [ fswf ] ) .",
    "the wave function @xmath396 has to be taken as a divergent wave localized in the vicinity of the atom @xcite .",
    "the wannier factor @xmath397 is found from ( [ s2si2]),([solchi ] ) .",
    "full dotes in figure 1 present calculation based on ( [ rpcic ] ) .",
    "the perfect agreement between the full lines and the full circles shows the high accuracy of the approximation which was used in order to present the resonant factor in the final form ( [ pcif ] ) as a product of two different factors .",
    "dotted lines in figure 1 present the simple eikonal approximation ( [ erf ] ) which should be correct only for high energies .",
    "results presented show that below @xmath398 ev the eikonal approximation fails , while for high above - threshold energies @xmath399 ev it produces quite reliable results .",
    "notice that experimental results of @xcite belong to the region @xmath399 ev where we have just verified the eikonal approximation to be valid .",
    "the dotted line in figure 1(_a _ ) shows the coulomb factor @xmath326 which is known to produce good results for pci with a single low - energy electron .",
    "figure ( 1_a _ ) shows that for the considered situation with two low - energy electrons it proves to be incorrect for low energies .",
    "this demonstrates that the wannier factor @xmath397 plays a very important role .",
    "the wannier factor exhibits quite an interesting variation as demonstrated in figure 2 where it is presented versus the energy of the pair @xmath243 for the fixed above - threshold energy @xmath400 ev . in order to reveal the asymptotic low - energy behaviour @xmath401 predicted by ( [ mu2 ] )",
    "the wannier factor is shown as @xmath402 .",
    "the pci shift found from calculations of the pci profiles is shown in figure 3 for the symmetrical configuration of wannier electrons .",
    "the full curve gives the results obtained from ( [ pcif ] ) .",
    "the dotted line shows the prediction of the eikonal approximation .",
    "the full dottes in figure 3 present the results extracted from the profiles calculated in @xcite .",
    "these results effectively include different possible configurations of wannier electrons in the final state .",
    "one can expect that the symmetrical configuration of the wannier electrons gives large contribution to the total probability . therefore the results calculated for the symmetrical configuration should reasonably agree with calculations in which all continuum states of wannier electrons are included .",
    "notice that the theory developed above and the approach of @xcite are very different in technique used .",
    "nevertheless there is a clear resemblance in several important basic features .",
    "firstly , in both works pci is described with the help of overlapping integrals between wave functions describing the wannier pair .",
    "secondly , both works rely upon the semiclassical approximation . having in mind these basic similarities one could expect that the two approaches should give similar results .",
    "this hope proves be correct for high energies , see figure 1(_d _ ) for 10 ev above the threshold .",
    "there is , however , some discrepancy below 10 ev .",
    "it can be verified comparing figure 1 with the results presented in figure of @xcite that distinctions exist in profile shapes as well .",
    "this paper develops the following ideas and results .",
    "1.it is emphasized that the propagation of two wannier electrons can be described by an effective single - particle coulomb problem with corrections which take into account more subtle three - body properties .",
    "correspondingly the wave function of the wannier pair ( [ answ ] ) is presented as the product of the coulomb wave function describing the effective single - particle coulomb problem , the additional phase factor @xmath403 , and the normalization coefficient @xmath404 ( [ s2si2 ] ) which plays a very important role in our consideration",
    ".    2.the complex problem ( [ 1]),([2 ] ) with three electrons in the final state is reduced to a more simple problem in which only two wannier electrons play a role .",
    "the key point is an assumption that the autoionization energy is so high that the autoionized electron can not interact strongly with the other two electrons .",
    "the dynamical properties responsible for pci are shown to be described by the overlapping integral ( [ 2|1 ] ) between the wave functions of wannier electrons in the final and intermediate states .",
    "the resonant factor is found in a very simple form ( [ pcif ] ) which depends on two factors .",
    "one of them @xmath20 describes the overlapping integral between the coulomb wave functions for the effective single - particle problem .",
    "a similar integral is known to describe pci when there is only one near - threshold electron .",
    "more specific properties of the considered problem are described by the wannier factor @xmath405 .",
    "the factorization of the resonant factor into a product of @xmath405 and @xmath20 has a clear physical reason .",
    "there are two scales in the problem .",
    "the effective single - particle coulomb problem describes strong variations of the wave function with a typical radius @xmath406 .",
    "in contrast , the quantities @xmath407 describing the specific properties of the three - body problem vary with a typical distance equal to the radius of the coulomb zone @xmath408 . for low energies",
    "these radii are different @xmath409 .",
    "it is well known that when there are two different scales in a problem then one has to expect an amplitude and a probability to be presented as products of quantities describing events which happen in different scales , as it happens in our case .",
    "equation ( [ pcif ] ) was verified for low energies , _",
    "i.e. _ in the coulomb region , and for high energies in the eikonal zone .",
    "for intermediate region one can _ hope _ that it should give reasonable results .",
    "( however , validity of the later assumption should be clarified by numerical integration of the matrix element ( [ 2|1 ] ) . )",
    "the wannier factor @xmath405 is shown to depend on the normalization coefficient @xmath404 of the wave function of the wannier pair , see ( [ kw ] ) .",
    "the distance at which this coefficient is to be taken depends on the above - threshold energy as well as on the energy of the pair in the final state , see ( [ cro ] ) .",
    "it is remarkable that the same coefficient considered for small separations ( [ aspc ] ) governs the wannier power law ( [ w1 ] ) , and therefore it has been under thorough experimental investigation for a long period of time .",
    "equation ( [ pcif ] ) shows that there is a new possibility to experimentally investigate the coefficient @xmath404 in a wide range of distances .",
    "4.it is demonstrated that for low energies of the pair @xmath364 the wannier power law has the form ( [ asw ] ) with the exponent governed by the ion charge in the final state .",
    "in contrast for higher energies in the eikonal region the power law has a form of ( [ twp ] ) depending on the above - threshold energy @xmath5 with the exponent governed by the ion charge in the intermediate state .",
    "5.our consideration was restricted by the one - dimensional model formulated in section [ wan ] .",
    "however , one can hope that the approach developed is more general than the model itself .",
    "there are clear physical reasons for this .",
    "firstly , pci as well as the wannier problem manifest themselves for large separations where the coulomb potential play an important role , while the more rapidly decreasing orbital barrier does not . therefore neglect of this later potential seems reasonable . secondly , the arguments considered above show that the factorization of the resonant factor into the product of the coulomb factor and the wannier factor is a general property caused by existence of the two different scales in the problem . therefore it should remain valid when the angular variables are included as well .",
