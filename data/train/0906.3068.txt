    "in the field of image analysis , recovering image components is a difficult task .",
    "this turns out to be even more challenging when objects exhibit large variations of their shape and topology .",
    "deformable models that are able to handle that kind of situations can use only little _ a priori _ knowledge concerning image components .",
    "this generally implies prohibitive computational costs ( see table  [ table : complexities ] ) .    in the framework of parametric deformable models , most authors @xcite propose to investigate the intersections of the deformable model with a grid that covers the image space .",
    "special configurations of these intersections characterize the self collisions of the mesh .",
    "once self - instersections have been detected , local reconfigurations are performed to adapt the topology of the model according to its geometry . to take advantage of all image details",
    ", the grid and the image should have the same resolution .",
    "an other method @xcite consists in constraining the lengths of the edges of the model between two bounds .",
    "self - collisions are then detected when distances between non - neighbor vertices fall under a given threshold .",
    "topological consistency is recovered using local operators that reconnect vertices consistently .",
    "using all image details requires edges to have the same size as image pixels .",
    "the complexities of all these methods are thus directly determined by the size of input data .    in the framework of level - set methods , boundaries of objects",
    "are implicitly represented as the zero level set of a function @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "usually @xmath0 is sampled over a regular grid that has the same resolution as the input image . then @xmath0 is iteratively updated to make its zero level - set approach image contours .",
    "even with optimization methods which reduce computations to a narrow band around evolving boundaries @xcite , the complexity of these methods is determined by the resolution of the grid and hence by the resolution of the input image .    .",
    "complexities of the deformable models that automatically adapt their topology .",
    "the length of the deformable model is denoted @xmath1 , the with of a pixel is denoted @xmath2 .",
    "the size of the image is denoted @xmath3 , and @xmath4 denotes the width of the narrow band when this optimization is used .",
    "this shows that the complexities of these algorithms are completely determined by the resolution of the input image .",
    "[ table : complexities ] [ cols=\"<,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "we presented a deformable model that adapts its resolution according to the geometrical complexity of image features .",
    "it is therefore able to recover finest details in images with a complexity almost independent from the size of input data .",
    "admittedly , a preprocessing step is required to build the metric .",
    "however , involved computational costs are negligible and , as a byproduct , these precomputations provide a robust gradient estimator which can be used as a potential field for the deformable model .",
    "most of the material used in our presented deformable model has a straightforward extension to higher dimensions @xcite .",
    "we are currently working on the extension of the whole approach to 3d images .",
    "in this section , we consider a contour that is tangent to the @xmath5 axis at the origin .",
    "this is expressed as @xmath6 and @xmath7 , where @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 denote the partial derivatives of @xmath11 and the strength of the contour .    from the definition of a contour as a maximum of the norm of the gradient in the gradient direction follows @xmath12 .",
    "once expanded , this leads to @xmath13 .",
    "let @xmath14 and @xmath15 denote the vectors tangent and normal to the investigated contour : @xmath16 and @xmath17",
    ". from the definition of curvature follows @xmath18 . replacing @xmath14 and @xmath15 by their expression as functions of @xmath11 , and then expanding and evaluating this expression at point @xmath19 yields @xmath20 .    from the above statements we get a second order taylor expansion of @xmath11 as @xmath21    in addition ,",
    "if we assume that the strength of the contour remains constant along the contour , we get @xmath22 . expanding the previous expression leads to @xmath23 .    with this additional hypothesis ,",
    "@xmath11 may be rewritten as @xmath24",
    "in this section we compute the eigenvalues of the structure tensor along a contour with strength @xmath10 and with local curvature @xmath25 .      following approximation ( [ eqn : parabolic - approximation ] ) we consider the image @xmath11 defined as @xmath26 for symmetry reasons , we know that the eigenvectors of the structure tensor @xmath27 at point @xmath19 are aligned with the @xmath5 axis and @xmath28 axis . in this special case , the eigenvalues of @xmath27 are given as @xmath29 and @xmath30 . if the averaging operation over a neighborhood is implemented as a convolution with a gaussian function @xmath31 , this yields @xmath32 and @xmath33 . in practice only @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath36 are known .",
    "curvature ( up to sign ) is easily computed from these quantities as @xmath37      in this subsection we show that the estimator described in the previous paragraph remains valid to estimate the curvature of a contour with a varying intensity    we start with equation ( [ eqn : parabolic - approximation - varying - s ] )  : @xmath38 from which we get @xmath39 and @xmath40 .    the curvature estimation @xmath41 is thus written  : @xmath42    if @xmath43 we get @xmath44 assuming that the contour intensity is significantly greater than its linear variation along @xmath5 , we obtain @xmath45 . replacing in ( [ eqn : null - curvature ] )",
    "we get @xmath46 .    if @xmath47 , we get @xmath48 as shown before @xmath45 for a reliable contour . as a consequence , such a contour @xmath49 , which shows that the curvature estimator remains available for contours with a varying intensity .",
    "the gradient structure tensor is implemented as successive convolutions of the input image with two gaussian functions @xmath50 , @xmath31 and their partial derivatives : @xmath51 convolutions are implemented efficiently as a product in the frequency domain and could be further improved using recursive implementations of gaussian filters @xcite .",
    "the parameter @xmath52 determines how much the image gets smoothed before computing its derivatives .",
    "it is thus chosen in accordance with the noise level in the image .",
    "the parameter @xmath36 determines the size of the neighborhood over which the gradient information is integrated .",
    "the influences of these parameters are studied experimentally in sect .",
    "[ sect : estimator - quality ] .",
    "since the metric has to be computed everywhere in the image our estimator must remain stable in regions without contours ( _ i.e. _ in regions where @xmath53 .",
    "therefore @xmath25 is computed as follows : @xmath54 where @xmath55 is an arbitrary positive constant . by this way the denominator never vanishes and @xmath25 falls to @xmath56 in places without image structure . in the vicinity of image contours",
    "@xmath55 may be neglected in front of @xmath34 and we get back estimation ( [ eqn : curvature - estimator ] ) . experimentally , a suitable choice for this constant is @xmath57 where @xmath58 denotes the maximum value of @xmath34 over the image .",
