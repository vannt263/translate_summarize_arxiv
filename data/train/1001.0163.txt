    "critical phenomena in equilibrium statistical systems is one of the most important topics in physics .",
    "much of the attention has been focused on the universality of the critical exponents , with several universality classes already characterized in equilibrium systems . on the other hand",
    "the critical behavior of non - equilibrium statistical systems has been receiving a lot of attention in recent years , but the characterization of the different universality classes is far from be complete .",
    "one of the simplest non - equilibrium models is the two dimensional majority vote model , an ising - like system ( up - down symmetry and spin - flip dynamic ) with a continuous order - disorder transition with the same critical exponents that the two dimensional ising model @xcite , as expected from the prediction of grinstein _ et al _ @xcite : every spin system with spin - flip dynamic and up - down symmetry falls in the ising model universality class .",
    "however , there is some controversy about the universality class for higher dimensions . a recent work claims  @xcite that the upper critical dimension for the majority vote model is 6 instead of 4 , based on numerical calculations .",
    "another discrepancy in the critical exponents have been found in simulations on non - regular lattices  @xcite .",
    "it must be mentioned that all of the results mentioned above were performed using standard `` monte carlo '' simulations and finite size scaling approaches for the evaluation of the static critical exponents . on the other hand the time evolution can",
    "gives important information about the universality of a given system .",
    "it has been shown by janssen _ et al . _",
    "@xcite that when systems with relaxation dynamics are quenched from high temperatures to the critical temperature there is a short critical universal behavior .",
    "numerical simulations have confirmed this behavior in the ising and the pott models ( see reference  @xcite for a review of these results ) .",
    "concerning the critical dynamic in systems without detailed balance , there are some works that evaluate the critical dynamic exponent @xmath0  @xcite and the fluctuation - dissipation ratio @xmath2  @xcite for the majority model , but always starting from a disordered state .",
    "as expected the results were compatibles with the ising ones . given all these results one should expect that the basic assumption for the dynamic relaxation of the k - th moment of the order parameter starting from an completely ordered state will be the same as in the ising model , but this has not been proved yet .",
    "the aims of this work are : a ) to evaluate the critical point using short time dynamic starting from ordered and disordered initial conditions and b ) evaluate the dynamic critical exponent @xmath0 and the static critical exponent @xmath1 .",
    "this will test if the grinstein prediction holds for the short time dynamic in the majority vote model .",
    "in the majority vote model each lattice site has a spin whose values are @xmath3 and its dynamic can be grouped by the spin flip rule @xmath4,\\ ] ] here @xmath5 is the local field @xmath6 produced by its nearest neighbors and @xmath7 is a function with up down symmetry that depends on two control parameters @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 . the parameters @xmath11 and @xmath12 can be associated with interface and bulk temperatures respectively  @xcite using the relations @xmath13 the majority model is obtained setting @xmath14 ( @xmath15)and the critical point is at @xmath16  @xcite . the equilibrium case can be obtained along the line @xmath17 ( glauber dynamic ) , where the temperatures are equal ( @xmath18 ) and the critical point is @xmath19 .",
    "the order parameter is the standard for ising - like systems , defined by @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the total number of lattice sites ( @xmath22 is the lateral size .",
    "starting from a disordered state the dynamic for the @xmath23-th moment of the order parameter was derived by janssen _",
    "@xcite , the mathematical expression is given by @xmath24 here @xmath25 is the reduced temperature , or the reduced control parameter for non - equilibrium systems , @xmath26 is the dynamic time variable , @xmath27 is the re - scaling factor , @xmath28 and @xmath29 are static critical exponents , @xmath0 is the dynamic critical exponent,@xmath30 is the scaling dimension of the initial ( small ) order parameter @xmath31 ( see  @xcite and reference therein ) .    at the critical point for sufficiently small @xmath31 and large systems ( @xmath32 )",
    "the order parameter follows a power law dynamic @xmath33 where @xmath34 is defined by @xmath35 .",
    "one must remark that there is a strong dependence on the initial value of the order parameter .",
    "this dependence does not affect the power law behavior at the critical point , what is affected is the exponent @xmath34 that tends to the real value in the limit @xmath36    for the dynamic starting , from the ordered state we have the assumption that the scaling dynamic form is given by @xmath37 again it can be obtained the scaling form at the critical point taking the limit @xmath38 .",
    "@xmath39    this has been proved in equilibrium systems , like the ising or the potts model .    for the evaluation of the critical point",
    "it has been used the fact that theoretically the order parameter evolves as a power law at the critical point if it is evaluated the difference between a power law and the time evolution for different values of the control parameter @xmath11 we will expect a minimum in those differences at the critical point .",
    "the simulations were performed choosing the lattice site randomly starting from both , a completely ordered state ( @xmath40 ) and a carefully prepared disordered state with small magnetization values @xmath41 .",
    "the order parameter is evaluated as a function of the time @xmath26 , with @xmath42 corresponding to a monte carlo time step ( mcts ) .",
    "in order to avoid finite size effects we used lattices with lateral size @xmath43 ( @xmath21 ) . the average were taken with at least @xmath44 independent simulations and 250 and 1000 mcts for the evaluation of the critical point and dynamical exponents respectively .",
    "given that the power law behavior of the order parameter as function of @xmath26 ( decay from an ordered state , increase for a disordered one ) one can performed simulations for different values of @xmath11 around the expected critical point . in fig .",
    "[ examples_dynamic ] we can observe that above and below a certain value of @xmath11 we have dynamic that differ from a power law ( illustrated by the dashed line ) .",

    "b ) dynamic starting from a disordered state ( @xmath45 ) . in both cases",
    "the top continuous line corresponds to a @xmath11 above the critical point and the lower one to a @xmath11 below the critical point .",
    "the dashed line shows the expected power law behavior.,width=302 ]    from here one must define the criterion that will measure which is the best power law curve , in this work it was used the measurement of the @xmath46 for each curve with respect to a power law behavior .",
    "i must remark that previous results for equilibrium systems give the same result for the critical point for both initial states .",
    "however , two different values were found for the majority vote model , see fig .",

    "( color online ) deviation from the power line behavior for the decay ( @xmath47 , left curve ) and the increase ( @xmath48 , right curve ) cases.,width=302 ]    the critical point values obtained were @xmath49 and @xmath50 for the order and disorder state respectively , both results are in perfect agreement with the obtained in the static case ( references  @xcite ) and are quite close .",
    "we have a clearly dependence on the initial condition in short time dynamic of this model , which is not the case for equilibrium systems .",
    "there is no doubt about the critical point obtained from the ordered phase , since @xmath47 is one of the fixed point under renormalization group transformations .",
    "however , one must remember that the power law is valid only in the limit @xmath51 ( the other fixed point ) for the disorder case , assuming that the `` real '' critical point is located at this limit , one can proceed to evaluate the critical point for another values of @xmath31 and with this values extrapolate the critical point for the disordered phase .",
    "the results are showed in table[critical_1 ]    .[critical_1 ] critical point for initial disordered states . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     finally the decay exponent @xmath52 was evaluated starting from an ordered phase ( at @xmath53 ) , using 1000 mcts ( fig .",
    "[ mag_decay ] ) , the result was @xmath54 , that is lower compared to the ising one , @xmath55 .",
    "again the first time steps were discarded for the evaluation of the exponent ( fig .",
    "[ mag_decay ] ) .",
    "theoretically it is possible to obtain the @xmath0 exponent using the known value of @xmath1 , or knowing the @xmath0 value one can obtain the @xmath1 value , but in both cases the results depend on values obtained with a growing process ( @xmath0 ) or the static simulations ( @xmath56 ) .",
    "the approach taken in this work is that the growing and the decay process are different and it could be possible that the dynamic exponent @xmath0 is different in each case , so for the decay case the reporting value is @xmath57 .",
    "( color online ) order parameter relaxation ( @xmath47 ) , here the dashed line shows the power law behavior with @xmath58 .",
    ", width=302 ]    the fact that we have two pseudo - critical points ( that not corresponds to a weak phase transition ) and that the decay and growing process are slower that in the ising model must be related to the absence of detailed balance condition .",
    "one of the consequences of this absence is that we do not have a unique thermodynamic temperature , in this case we have two , so looking at the snapshots for different initial conditions at the pseudo - critical points we can speculate about the competition between the two `` temperatures '' that governs the dynamic in non - equilibrium ising systems .",
    "figure  [ snapshot_dis ] shows the time evolution with @xmath59 at the two pseudo - critical points , a ) for @xmath60 and b ) for @xmath53 .",
    "initially the number of sites with spin - flip probability depending on @xmath61 are very similar to the ones depending on @xmath62 , the time increases from left to right and it can be observed that at @xmath53 the coarsening seems to appear faster that at @xmath60 .",

    ", width=302 ]    it seems that the coarsening differs at the two pseudo - critical points , so as a final test the time evolution for a special initial condition were performed setting @xmath31 really close to zero putting almost half of the spins in one state and the other half in the other state with a circular border , in this way we have a large number of sites with @xmath62 while the number of possible sites with @xmath63 increases ( fig .",
    "[ snapshot_cir ] ) .",
    "we can observe that the circular shape last longer at @xmath53 . in order to corroborate the effect of the difference between temperatures",
