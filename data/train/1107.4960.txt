    "the search for a mechanism for electroweak symmetry breaking , and in particular for a standard model ( sm ) higgs boson , has been a major goal of particle physics for many years , and is a central part of the fermilab tevatron physics program , and also that of the large hadron collider .",
    "recently , the atlas and cms collaborations at the large hadron collider have released results on searches for the standard model higgs boson decaying to @xmath6  @xcite , @xmath7  @xcite , and @xmath8  @xcite .",
    "both the cdf and collaborations have performed new combinations  @xcite of multiple direct searches for the sm higgs boson .",
    "the sensitivities of these new combinations significantly exceed those of previous combinations  @xcite .    in this note , we combine the most recent results of searches for the sm higgs boson produced in  collisions at  , where the decay of the higgs boson is restricted to pairs of photons : @xmath2 .",
    "we consider all four sm production modes , gluon - gluon fusion : @xmath9 , associated production of a higgs boson with a @xmath10 boson : @xmath11 , associated production of a higgs boson with a @xmath12 boson : @xmath13 , and vector - boson fusion : @xmath14 .",
    "the cdf search  @xcite is performed with 7.0  and the d0 search  @xcite is performed with 8.2  of collision data .",
    "the data for the cdf search are divided into four categories : central - central ( cc ) , central - plug ( cp ) , central - central conversion ( cc conv ) , and central - plug conversion ( cp conv ) , which are based on whether the photon(s ) are detected in the central electromagnetic ( em ) calorimeter ( @xmath15 ) or the plug em calorimeter ( @xmath16 ) , and whether or not one of the central photons is detected via its conversion products @xmath17 .",
    "the reconstructed mass resolution is approximately 2.8  gev/@xmath5 for the cdf channels .",
    "the acceptances for higgs boson decay are approximately 13% for the central - central category , 16% for the central - plug category , 2.9% for the central - central conversion category , and 1.8% for the central - plug conversion category , varying by @xmath18% ( relative ) depending on the mass of the higgs boson and the production mechanism .",
    "we assume the sm mixture of the production mechanisms .",
    "the discriminant variable is the reconstructed candidate mass @xmath19 , and the background is parameterized as a smooth function of @xmath19 which is fit to the data outside of a window centered on the signal under test .",
    "the d0 search requires events with at least two photon candidates with @xmath20  gev and @xmath15 .",
    "the diphoton mass resolution is @xmath21  gev/@xmath5 .",
    "the contribution of jets misidentified as photons is reduced by combining information sensitive to differences in the energy deposition from these particles in the tracker , calorimeter and central preshower in a neural network . in this latest iteration of the analysis",
    "boosted decision trees , rather than the diphoton invariant mass , are used as the final discriminating variable .",
    "the transverse energies of the leading two photons along with azimuthal opening angle between them and the di - photon invariant mass and transverse momentum are used as input variables .",
    "a sizeable improvement in sensitivity beyond that achieved with the invariant mass is obtained .",
    "we normalize our higgs boson signal predictions to the most recent highest - order calculations available , for all production processes considered .",
    "the largest production cross section , @xmath22 , is calculated at next - to - next - to - leading order ( nnlo ) in qcd with soft gluon resummation to next - to - next - to - leading - log ( nnll ) accuracy , and also includes two - loop electroweak effects and handling of the running @xmath23 quark mass  @xcite .",
    "the numerical values in table  [ tab : higgsxsec ] are updates  @xcite of these predictions with @xmath24 set to 173.1  gev/@xmath5  @xcite , and an exact treatment of the massive top and bottom loop corrections up to next - to - leading - order ( nlo ) + next - to - leading - log ( nll ) accuracy .",
    "the factorization and renormalization scale choice for this calculation is @xmath25 .",
    "these calculations are refinements of earlier nnlo calculations of the @xmath9 production cross section  @xcite .",
    "electroweak corrections were computed in refs .",
    "soft gluon resummation was introduced in the prediction of the @xmath9 production cross section in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the @xmath9 production cross section depends strongly on the gluon parton density function , and the accompanying value of @xmath26 .",
    "the cross sections used here are calculated with the mstw08 nnlo pdf set  @xcite , as recommended by the pdf4lhc working group  @xcite .",
    "we follow the pdf4lhc working group s prescription to evaluate the uncertainties on the @xmath9 production cross section due to the pdfs .",
    "this prescription is to evaluate the predictions of @xmath22 at nlo using the global nlo pdf sets cteq6.6  @xcite , mstw08  @xcite , and nnpdf2.0  @xcite , and to take the envelope of the predictions and their uncertainties due to pdf+@xmath27 for the three sets as the uncertainty range at nlo . the ratio of the nlo uncertainty range to that of just mstw08 is then used to scale the nnlo mstw08 pdf+@xmath27 uncertainty , to estimate a larger uncertainty at nnlo .",
    "this procedure roughly doubles the pdf+@xmath27 uncertainty from mstw08 at nnlo alone .",
    "we also include uncertainties on @xmath22 due to uncalculated higher order processes by following the standard procedure of varying the factorization renormalization scales up and down together by a factor @xmath28 .",
    "we treat the scale uncertainties as 100% correlated between jet categories and between cdf and d0 , and also treat the pdf+@xmath27 uncertainties in the cross section as correlated between jet categories and between cdf and d0 .",
    "we treat however the pdf@xmath29 uncertainty as uncorrelated with the scale uncertainty .",
    "we include all significant higgs boson production modes in our searches .",
    "besides gluon - gluon fusion through virtual quark loops , we include higgs boson production in association with a @xmath10 or @xmath12 vector boson , and vector boson fusion ( vbf ) .",
    "we use the @xmath30 and @xmath31 production cross sections computed at nnlo in ref .",
    "this calculation starts with the nlo calculation of v2hv  @xcite and includes nnlo qcd contributions  @xcite , as well as one - loop electroweak corrections  @xcite .",
    "we use the vbf cross section computed at nnlo in qcd in ref .",
    "electroweak corrections to the vbf production cross section are computed with the hawk program  @xcite , and are small ( 3% or less ) for the higgs boson mass range considered here .",
    "the vbf cross sections in table  [ tab : higgsxsec ] do not include the electroweak corrections .    in order to predict the distributions of the kinematics of higgs boson signal events , cdf and d0 use the pythia  @xcite monte carlo program , with cteq5l and cteq6l  @xcite leading - order ( lo ) parton distribution functions .",
    "the higgs boson decay branching fraction @xmath32 used here is obtained from the handbook  @xcite .",
    "the branching fractions are computed by evaluating the partial decay widths of on - shell higgs bosons to all possible final states allowed in the sm , and evaluating the fractions of the total decay width for each process . for all processes except @xmath33 and @xmath34 , hdecay  @xcite",
    "is used to compute the partial widths .",
    "hdecay includes relevant higher - order qcd corrections to decays into quarks and gluons , and nlo electroweak corrections are included in the @xmath35 and @xmath36 processes . for @xmath33 and @xmath34 , the monte carlo generator prophecy4f",
    "@xcite is used .",
    "it computes partial widths for higgs boson decays at nlo , including nlo qcd and electroweak corrections and all interferences , for four - fermion final states of higgs boson decay .",
    "more details are available in ref .",
    "the branching fraction @xmath32 is listed in table  [ tab : higgsxsec ] as a function of @xmath37 .",
    "limits on the product of the inclusive higgs boson production cross section and the decay branching ratio to a pair of photons @xmath38 , as a function of the higgs boson mass , assuming sm ratios of the four production mechanisms .",
    "the bands indicate the 68% and 95% probability regions where the limits can fluctuate , in the absence of signal.,width=623 ]    in summary , we combine cdf and d0 results on sm higgs boson searches with @xmath2 , based on 7.0 fb@xmath39 of data from cdf and 8.2 fb@xmath39 of data from d0 .",
    "we use the recommendation of the pdf4lhc working group for the central value of the parton distribution functions and uncertainties  @xcite .",
    "we use the highest - order calculations available for the @xmath40 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , and vbf theoretical cross sections when comparing our limits to the sm predictions .",
    "we include consensus estimates of the theoretical uncertainties on these production cross sections and the decay branching fractions in the computations of our limits .",
    "the 95% c.l .",
    "upper limit on higgs boson production is a factor of 10.5 times the sm cross section for a higgs boson mass of @xmath41115  gev/@xmath5 .",
    "based on simulation , the corresponding median expected upper limit is 8.5 times the sm cross section .",
    "standard model branching ratios , calculated as functions of the higgs boson mass , are assumed .",
    "the results presented here extend significantly the sensitivity of the separate cdf and d0 results .",
