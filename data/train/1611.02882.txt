    "particle - in - cell ( pic ) simulations of collisionless shock formation and instability growth , such as the weibel instability , the kinetic kelvin - helmholtz instability ( kkhi ) , and the mushroom instability ( mi ) , have been performed to study magnetic field generation , particle acceleration , and emission of radiation with applications to astrophysical plasma jets ( e.g. , ( * ? ? ?",

    "furthermore , @xcite have performed global simulations involving injection of a cylindrical jet into an ambient plasma in order to investigate shock ( weibel instability ) and velocity shear instabilities ( kkhi and mi ) simultaneously .",

    "the kinetic features of secondary magnetic reconnection in a single flux rope undergoing internal kink instability are studied by means of three - dimensional particle - in - cell simulations where the single flux rope is modeled with a simple screw - pinch configuration as in @xcite .",
    "the presence of helical magnetic fields is suggested by twisted structures that have been observed in many active galactic nuclei ( agn ) jets , from sub- to kiloparsec scales ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "these jet structures were explained through relativistic magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) modeling , where simulations of current - driven ( kink ) instabilities were performed ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the main result obtained by @xcite has revealed that new types of shocks , similar to the recollimation shocks attained in relativistic mhd simulations , occur when a relativistic plasma jet contains a helical magnetic field .",
    "the simulations presented in this paper were designed to further test these new findings .",
    "we use a fully kinetic approach to model the formation of shocks in relativistic plasma jets containing helical magnetic fields .",
    "we apply pic methods to numerically simulate the injection of a cylindrical relativistic jet with a lorentz factor @xmath2 into an ambient plasma at rest , using a modified version ( e.g. , @xcite ) of the tristan code ( @xcite ) .    for plasma composition ,",
    "we use ( i ) an electron - proton ( @xmath0 ) plasma with a realistic proton - electron mass ratio @xmath3 and ( ii ) an electron - positron ( @xmath1 ) plasma .",
    "the simulations were performed with a numerical grid of @xmath4 @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the cell size , and periodic boundary conditions in traverse directions .",

    "the helical magnetic field structure is implemented using the equations in @xcite , with an exponential damping function for the magnetic fields external to the jet in order for plasma instabilities to grow ( @xcite ) .",

    "small recollimation structures are initially formed , and after instabilities have grown , currents extend outside the jet and the current density becomes turbulent . @xcite",

    "using a fully kinetic approach , the simulation results presented in @xcite demonstrate the formation , at the microphysics level , of new types of shock structures in relativistic plasma jets due to the presence of helical magnetic fields , whereas kinetic instabilities , such as the weibel instability , kkhi , and mi are suppressed .",
    "these new types of shocks have structures similar to those obtained using relativistic mhd methods ( @xcite ) . here",
