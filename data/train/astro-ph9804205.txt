    "by studying typical galaxies at high redshift , here @xmath11 , we can record the origins of normal galaxies such as our own milky way .",
    "schmidt @xcite was the first to observe a high@xmath12redshift galaxy when he obtained a spectrum of 3c9 , a radio@xmath12loud quasar of redshift @xmath13 .",
    "normal star@xmath12forming high@xmath12redshift galaxies are about 1000 times fainter , and remained undiscovered until the present decade . a small number of candidates ( some of which may be active galaxies ) have been identified with 4@xmath12metre telescopes , through the detection of ly@xmath14 emission ( e.g. steidel , sargent , and dickinson 1991 , lowenthal et al .",
    "1991 , mller and warren 1993 , pascarelle et al .",
    "1996 , francis et al .",
    "another approach has been to employ deep broad@xmath12band imaging to identify candidates by the expected lyman@xmath12limit discontinuity in their spectra ( steidel and hamilton 1992 ) .",
    "the brightest lyman@xmath12break galaxies have @xmath15 and spectroscopic confirmation has only become feasible with the completion of the keck 10@xmath12metre telescope .",
    "the report by steidel et al .",
    "( 1996 ) on the results of spectroscopic observations of lyman@xmath12break candidates really marked the beginning of the statistical study of high - redshift galaxies .",
    "they were able to confirm redshifts for 15 star@xmath12forming galaxies in the range @xmath16 .",
    "they discovered that lyman@xmath12break galaxies generally show weak ly@xmath14 emission , but that the rest@xmath12frame ultra@xmath12violet spectra may be recognised by the presence of absorption lines characteristic of the spectra of nearby star@xmath12forming galaxies .",
    "madau et al .",
    "( 1996 ) applied the same methodology to the hubble deep field data to extend the results to fainter magnitudes , and their analysis currently provides the best lower limits to the integrated star formation rate in galaxies at @xmath11 .",
    "complementary to the searches for starlight from high@xmath12redshift galaxies have been the analyses of absorption lines in the spectra of high@xmath12redshift quasars .",
    "these studies have provided measurements of the mass density of neutral hydrogen in the universe ( e.g. wolfe et al .",
    "1986 , lanzetta et al .",
    "1991 ) , and the metallicity of the gas ( e.g. pettini et al 1994 ) , and how these quantities have changed with redshift .",
    "the analysis of pei and fall ( 1995 ) of the absorption ",
    "line data reconstructs the global history of star formation , gas consumption , and chemical enrichment , accounting in a self  consistent way for the effects of the progressive extinction of the background quasars due to dust as star formation proceeds .",
    "the advantage of the absorption  line approach to the history of star formation is that it is global in nature as all the neutral gas at any redshift is directly observed . with the deep imaging studies it is necessary to extrapolate below the survey flux limit to measure the total star formation rate .",
    "the weakness of the global approach however is that it tells us nothing about the sizes and morphologies of the galaxies in which the star formation occurs .",
    "deep imaging of dla absorbers provides the missing information . in other words if we imaged the absorbers we could combine the data of faint galaxy surveys ( luminosities , sizes , shapes ) with the information on the gas obtained from the spectroscopic studies ( column densities , chemistry ) , allowing a more detailed comparison with theories of galaxy formation .    unlike for mgii absorbers ( e.g. bergeron and boiss 1991 , steidel ,",
    "dickinson , and persson 1994a ) little progress has been made in such a programme of imaging of dla systems .",
    "there are only two published unambiguous detections , discussed below , as well as a small number of candidate counterparts of dla absorbers ( at both low redshift @xmath12 steidel et al .",

    "we report on the results of 30 orbits of imaging observations with the _ hubble space telescope _ ( hst ) of a group of three galaxies at @xmath17 , named s1 , s2 , s3 , one of which ( s1 ) is a damped ly@xmath1absorber .",
    "the three galaxies lie in the field of the quasar pks@xmath2 , and were detected in the light of ly@xmath1emission by mller and warren ( 1993 , hereafter paper i ) .",
    "a detailed discussion of their nature was presented by warren and mller ( 1996 , hereafter paper iiemission from the dla absorber is due to star formation rather than photoionisation by the quasar . ] ) .",
    "the hst images provide measures of their sizes , magnitudes , and colours .",
    "the other high@xmath12redshift damped system that has been successfully imaged is the absorber at @xmath18 , towards the quasar @xmath19 , observed by djorgovski et al .",
    "@xcite . in this paper",
    "we intercompare the measured properties of these two absorbers , the two companion galaxies s2 and s3 , and the population of lyman@xmath12break galaxies , to draw conclusions about the space density of dla absorbers , their structure , and the relation between the dla absorbers and the lyman - break galaxies .",
    "the layout of the rest of the paper is as follows .",
    "the hst observations of the field towards pks@xmath2are described in section 2 , as well as new ground@xmath12based narrow@xmath12band observations of the field .",
    "the three galaxies are very small , and the hst images were dithered with a half - integer pixel step in order to improve the image sampling .",
    "the algorithm for combining the images is outlined in this section . in section 3",
    "we present the reduced hst images . in section 4",
    "we provide the results of aperture photometry and profile fitting of the hst and ground - based images .",
    "finally , in section 5 we discuss these results and their implications for our understanding of the nature of dla absorbers and lyman - break galaxies .",
    "the hst observations were made in 1995 february and march , using the wide field camera of wfpc2 .",
    "the journal of observations appears in table 1 .",
    "we used three different filters : six orbits each of observations with the wfpc2 standard broad b ( f450w ) and i ( f814w ) filters , and 18 orbits with the f467 m medium - passband filter .",
    "the last filter , hereafter m , has a width of @xmath20 ( fwhm ) , and is the narrowest wfpc2 filter that contains the wavelength of redshifted ly@xmath14 of the targets , @xmath21 .",

    "we obtained a 1900 sec exposure in the first orbit , and an uninterrupted 2200 sec exposure in each of the following 5 orbits .",
    "the six exposures of each visit were grouped in three pairs .",
    "the two exposures of each pair were obtained with exactly the same pointing .",
    "relative to the first , the second and third pairs were shifted , respectively , by 0.45 arcsec in @xmath22 , and by 0.45 arcsec in both @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "the step of 0.45 arcsec is exactly 4.5 wfc pixels , and this strategy was chosen with a view to improving the rejection of cosmic rays , and to allow an increase in the sampling , since the wfpc2 point spread function is undersampled by the 0.1 arcsec wfc pixels .",
    "the latter point is important because we need good sampling for a morphological study , but our objects are too faint to be observed with the planetary camera .    for the basic reduction of the data we obtained , from the stsci data archive , the best biases , darks and flats appropriate for the observing dates and applied these in standard ways .",
    "we also obtained the relevant hot pixel lists , and created a bad pixel mask and a hot pixel mask for each image .    to combine the frames for each filter we used the weighting scheme and the sigma clipping algorithm described in paper i , which is optimal for faint sources .",
    "we have extended the algorithm to allow for half integer shifts between input frames . a short description of the procedure follows .",
    "a detailed discussion will be provided elsewhere ( mller , in preparation ) .",
    "the sub@xmath12pixel combination is undertaken in two stages , of which the second is iterative .",
    "the first stage is the combination of the frames using integer pixel shifts , with the rejection of cosmic rays by sigma clipping , and the masking of bad pixels . in this combined image",
    "each pixel is then divided two by two into sub@xmath12pixels , providing the first estimate of the final sub@xmath12pixelised image .",
    "the pixels in the original data frames are then similarly divided , and each frame is registered with the combined image , to the nearest sub@xmath12pixel .",
    "the sub - pixel registration allows improved rejection of cosmic rays in the subsequent processing , notably where there are strong gradients in the data e.g. in images of stars .",
    "the first combined image provides a prescription for each original data pixel as to the distribution of the detected incident photons within the pixel . in each frame , in each pixel , the counts are then distributed to the four corresponding sub@xmath12pixels according to this prescription",
    ". a second combined frame is then constructed , again after appropriate rejection of bad pixels and cosmic rays .",
    "this new frame provides an improved prescription for the redistribution of counts within pixels , and the final frame is constructed in this manner through iteration .",
    "the iteration is halted as soon as the mean @xmath24 per pixel has reached a stable minimum , typically after six to twelve iterations . along with the combined image , the corresponding variance image is created .",
    "the measured profiles of objects in the final frame will be similar to the profiles that would have been obtained for the same instrument but with pixels of side half the size .",
    "thus the algorithm improves the sampling by a factor of two , but does not attempt to deconvolve the resolution set by the optics .",
    "it does , however , remove the extra `` box  car '' smoothing of the image caused by the finite pixel size .",
    "the algorithm is strictly locally and globally count conserving , and the observed number of counts recorded in a whole detector pixel is never changed ( as opposed to deconvolution algorithms attempting to correct for the effect of the psf ) .",
    "most cameras used in optical astronomy have pixels which are small compared to the resolution fwhm of the images , and hence their intrinsic pixel smoothing is insignificant . for wfpc2 the pixels are of the same size as the resolution ,",
    "so the pixel smoothing adds significantly to the final resolution if it is not corrected for . the correction algorithm outlined above therefore , for wfpc2 , has the advantage of improving both sampling and resolution , but it does not suffer the disadvantage of mixing information between unrelated detector pixels as does psf  deconvolution algorithms .",
    "the main difference between our algorithm and that used by the hdf group ( hook and fruchter , 1997 ) is that the hdf group decided not to correct for the pixel smoothing because the correction introduces a small correlation of noise on the scale of an original pixel .",
    "the hdf images therefore have somewhat lower resolution but statistically independent sub  pixels .",
    "we obtained a new deep ground - based ly@xmath1image of the field using the susi instrument on the eso new technology telescope ( ntt ) , over two runs in december 1993 and december 1994 .",
    "the journal of the observations appears in table 2 .",
    "the narrow - band filter used for the ntt observations is the same filter , hereafter n , as was used for the eso 3.6 m observations reported in paper i , and has a central wavelength @xmath25 , fwhm @xmath26 .",
    "our original eso 3.6 m narrow - band image was badly affected by filter ghosts , and by the poor seeing , average 1.7 arcsec fwhm .",
    "the purpose of the susi image was to obtain a deeper ghost - free image ( as the filter is not inclined in susi ) with better seeing .",
    "the observations were broken into 1 hour exposures obtained with small shifts in pointing .",
    "the data reduction and the combination of frames followed the procedures described in paper i. the images in the final narrow - band frame have fwhm 0.96 arcsec , with a sampling of 0.26 arcsec per pixel .",
    "the source s1 lies at an angular separation of only @xmath27 arcsec from the line of sight to the quasar . due to",
    "the relatively good seeing the faint image of the quasar ( from the small amount of quasar light that leaks through the filter wings ) and the image of s1 are separate .",
    "there are several unsaturated images of bright stars in the susi frames , so that using daophot we were able to subtract the image of the quasar .",

    "in figure 1 we show a small section of the field around the quasar , that includes the three galaxies s1 , s2 , s3 .",
    "the figure is a weighted sum of the final hst frames for the three filters .",
    "the three galaxies are clearly visible in this figure , and are also each detected in the individual summed frames for each filter .",
    "the galaxy s1 lies at an angular separation of only @xmath28 arcsec from the quasar , and is only visible after subtraction of the quasar image . in figure 1",
    "we have inserted a small panel from the image with the quasar subtracted , to reveal s1 .",
    "the lower panel of figure 1 is the same image lightly smoothed to enhance the contrast of faint objects .    for the psf subtraction we used tinytim v4.1 model psfs .",
    "model psfs were made for each filter , and were constructed on the 0.05 arcsec sub  pixel scale .",
    "images of s1 in all three bands , before and after psf subtraction , are shown in figure 2 .",
    "construction of sub - pixelised images and psfs provides a substantial improvement in the psf subtraction over our preliminary integral pixel shift reductions shown in mller and warren ( 1996 ) .",
    "a comparison between images obtained in different bands is provided in figure 3 , which shows close  up images of all three galaxies .",
    "the sources s1 and s2 are both compact , without any obvious substructure , while the source s3 is composed principally of two compact components , separated by 0.3 arcsec .",
    "a possible third component is just visible , but contains only @xmath29 of the light , and has not been included in the profile fitting described in the next section .    at this point",
    "it is worth commenting on the low signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) apparent in figure 3 of the m - band images of sources s2 and s3 compared with the b - band and i - band images .",
    "the ly@xmath1emission line acounts for a large fraction of the m - band flux for the three sources .",
    "as detailed in section 5 we find evidence that the ly@xmath1emission is more extended than the continuum emission for the three sources , which would explain the low s / n of the m - band images .",

    "the results are provided in table 3 , as well as the colours @xmath79 , @xmath80 , for each source , for both apertures .",
    "the magnitudes are on the hst system , with zero points taken from holtzman et al .",
    "@xcite ( their table 9 ) .    for the small@xmath12aperture measurements we selected isophotes that defined areas of 0.13 , 0.13 , and 0.31 square arcsec for the galaxies s1 , s2 , s3 , respectively . for each object",
    "the identical aperture was applied in each passband .",
    "the quoted photometric errors account for photon noise , read - out - noise , and the error associated with the uncertainty in the determination of the local sky level .",
    "the large aperture used was a circle of diameter one arcsec .",
    "the zero points of the hst photometric system are defined such that for point sources aperture magnitudes in a circular aperture of this size provide total magnitudes .",
    "therefore our large - aperture magnitudes will be total magnitudes if the sources are compact .",
    "this is certainly the case for the continuum emission , as demonstrated by the profile fits described in the next subsection .",
    "the measurement of the flux within the large aperture is difficult for s1 .",
    "this is because the aperture includes regions where the subtraction of the quasar profile is very uncertain .",
    "instead , for this source we applied the aperture to the galaxy - profile models described in the next subsection , but have not attempted to quantify the photometric errors . in computing the best@xmath12fit models",
    "the bad regions were ignored .",
    "therefore , for s1 , the models ought to provide a more reliable estimate of the flux within the larger aperture .      for the ntt image we used a circular aperture of diameter 2.6 arcsec .",
    "we measured the aperture correction between this diameter and a very large diameter for bright stars in the frame , and applied the correction to the measured magnitudes of our sources . again , then , if the sources are compact this procedure provides total magnitudes .",
    "the photometry for the ntt observations is on the ab system .",
    "also provided in table 3 are the values of the rest - frame equivalent width ( ew ) of the ly@xmath1emission line for the three sources .",
    "these were computed by creating power - law spectra @xmath81 , with emission lines of different ew , and applying absorption at wavelengths shortward of the ly@xmath1line centre as approporiate for @xmath17 , using the models of mller and warren ( 1991 ) .",
    "the line ew was adjusted to reproduce the measured large - aperture @xmath82 colours .",

    "the results are provided in table 4 .",
    "the two components of s3 are separated by @xmath86 arcsec .",
    "the s / n of the m - band images of s2 and of s3 were too low to provide meaningful results .",
    "there follows a description of the fitting procedure .",
    "firstly any residual sky counts ( or large - scale psf residuals for s1 ) in the frames were subtracted by means of a large - scale running modal filter , where the mode is estimated by fitting a gaussian to the peak in the histogram of the counts in the sliding box .",
    "a box of side 51 sub - pixels ( 2.55 arcsec ) was used for s2 and s3 .",
    "a smaller box of side 41 sub - pixels was used for s1 , ignoring pixels close to the quasar centroid . for the profile fits themselves boxes of side 21 sub - pixels were used for s2 and s3 , and of side 15 sub - pixels for s1 .",
    "the results were fairly insensitive to the choices of box size .",
    "the model profiles are characterised by six parameters : @xmath87 , ellipticity , position angle , @xmath83 , and surface brightness at @xmath83 .",
    "a mask was applied to exclude certain pixels from the fit , as required ; for example the faint third source in fitting s3 , and in fitting s1 the region over which the quasar image is bright ( i.e. where the poisson noise is high , and where large residuals from the psf subtraction remain ) .",
    "trial model galaxy light profiles were convolved with the normalised sub - pixelised light profile of a nearby star , and the minimum @xmath24 fit was found for the six free parameters .",
    "examples of the best@xmath12fit galaxy models are shown in figure 3 , as well as the images after subtraction of the models .    referring to table 4",
    "it can be seen that for each galaxy , for a particular profile function , there is good agreement in the measured half - light radii for the different filters , indicating that the point spread function is adequately sampled in the sub - pixelised images .",
    "the goodness of fit of both profile functions is in all cases similar , so there is no indication that either the de vaucouleurs or exponential function is preferred . in all cases a larger value of @xmath83",
    "is measured for the de vaucouleurs function , and the discrepancy is larger than the scatter for the same function for different filters .",
    "this is particularly noticeable for galaxy s1 and it is possible that this is caused by residuals left from imperfect subtraction of the quasar image .",
    "the purpose of fitting de vaucouleurs and exponential functions is to be able to correct for the psf .",
    "the profile fitting indicates that the dominant uncertainty in the measurement of the intrinsic half - light radius is the choice of profile rather than poisson noise .",
    "therefore the range of half - light radii quoted in table 4 for the different profile functions provides a measure of how accurately the half - light radius is determined . for this reason we have chosen to average all the measurements as the best estimate of the half - light radius , and to quote the scatter amongst the measurements for each object as a measure of the uncertainty , as listed in column 5 of the table .",
    "the psf has a significant effect on the measured half - light radii for the smallest objects .",
    "for example the half - light radius for s2 measured from the images , without correction for the psf , is 0.15 arcsec , which is about double the intrinsic value .",
    "the n - band ground - based images are of higher s / n but lower spatial resolution than the hst m - band data . because the continuum contributes only a small fraction of the light to the n - band images",
    "the n - band data essentially provide the ly@xmath1profiles of the three sources , and we attempted to measure the profiles following the fitting procedure described above . for s2 and s3 the results are not particularly useful as evidence of whether the ly@xmath1emission is more extended than the continuum emission . for both sources the measured intrinsic sizes are consistent with the continuum sizes measured from the hst images , but also consistent with the hypothesis that they are more extended .",
    "the n - band image of s1 on the other hand is clearly extended .",
    "we measured half - light radii of @xmath88 arcsec and @xmath89 arcsec for the exponential and de vaucouleurs profiles respectively .",
    "the quoted errors are computed as follows : the value of the radius is varied in steps away from the best ",
    "fit value , and for each fixed value of the radius a new minimum @xmath24 fit is computed by allowing the other parameters to vary .",
    "the radius at which the @xmath24 is 1.0 greater than the best ",
    "fit @xmath24 is identified .",
    "the change in radius relative to the best - fit value is the @xmath90 error . for each object",
    "the results of the profile fitting demonstrate that the 2.6 arcsec diameter aperture used for the photometry includes most of the light from the source , so we will treat the measurements as total magnitudes .",
    "the three galaxies s1 , s2 , s3 are similar in their properties to members of the recently detected population of lyman - break galaxies , except that they have strong ly@xmath1emission , with mean restframe @xmath91 .",
    "for example the b and i magnitudes for our three sources @xmath92 , @xmath93 , are within the range of magnitudes of the lyman - break galaxies of redshift @xmath94 observed by steidel et al .",
    "( 1996 ) and lowenthal et al .",
    "the average half - light radius of the four objects listed in table 4 is 0.1 arcsec .",
    "this is smaller than the value quoted for the lyman - break galaxies ( giavalisco et al .",
    "1996 , lowenthal et al .",
    "1997 ) , by a factor of two to three .",
    "however we have broken s3 into two sub components and measured the radii for each subcomponent .",
    "in addition the radii quoted in table 4 have been corrected for the effect of the psf .",
    "young star - forming galaxies should have approximately constant flux per unit frequency over the restframe ultraviolet and optical regions of the spectrum .",
    "the expected colour of a source at @xmath0 with a power - law continuum varying as @xmath81 , after accounting for typical absorption in the ly@xmath1forest , is @xmath95 . as seen in table 3 the @xmath79 colours for the three sources s1 , s2 , s3 are consistent with this value , for both the small and large apertures .",
    "the fact that s1 has properties similar to the lyman - break galaxies suggests that dla absorbers and lyman - break galaxies may commonly be associated with each other .",
    "lowenthal et al ( 1997 ) have also made a connection between the two populations by suggesting that the broad ly@xmath1absorption line seen in several cases in the spectra of lyman - break galaxies is a damped line from neutral hydrogen in the galaxy .",
    "however the absorption lines seen in their average spectrum and in the relatively high s / n spectrum presented by ebbels et al .",
    "( 1996 ) are not optically thick in the line centre .",
    "the absorption ",
    "line profiles are difficult to interpret because the background source is extended .",
    "it is even possible that in some cases the absorption line is stellar absorption in the spectra of late b stars and that the galaxies are observed in a post - burst phase , rather than actively forming stars ( see valls - gabaud 1993 ) i.e. for some cases this may be the explanation for the weakness of the ly@xmath1emission line in the lyman - break galaxies , as opposed to dust .",
    "high - redshift galaxies with strong ly@xmath1emission , like the three sources near pks@xmath2 , may therefore be younger than many of the lyman - break galaxies .",
    "in this subsection we summarise the evidence that the ly@xmath1emission from the three sources is more extended than the continuum emission .",
    "the evidence for s2 and s3 comes from an examination of the @xmath80 and @xmath82 colours , summarised in table 3 .",
    "the bottom row in table 3 provides the predicted @xmath80 colours for each source computed , as detailed in section 4.1.2 , from the b and n total magnitudes .",
    "the small aperture @xmath80 colours are smaller than the predicted values , as would be the case if the ly@xmath1emission is more extended than the continuum . for s2",
    "the difference is significant at @xmath96 , and for s3 at @xmath97 .",
    "notice also that the large aperture @xmath80 colours are larger than the small aperture colours , which is consistent with the hypothesis of extended ly@xmath1emission .",
    "a broad absorption line in the m passband could only explain part of the discrepancy between the measured and predicted colours .",
    "for example for s2 , simply removing @xmath98 of the continuum flux within the m band changes the @xmath80 colour by only 0.1 mag .",
    "the total b magnitude for s1 ( i.e. the large - aperture measurement from the hst image , table 4 ) is not reliable because of the uncertainty associated with the psf subtraction .",
    "this prevents us from usefully making the same comparison between predicted and measured @xmath80 colours for s1 .",
    "however there is an indication that s1 may also be more extended in ly@xmath1 .",
    "the measurements of the half - light radius of s1 from the ground - based ly@xmath1image yielded values of @xmath88 arcsec for the exponential profile and @xmath89 arcsec for the de vaucouleurs profile ( section 4.2.2 ) .",
    "these values are significantly larger than the half light radius of the region of continuum emission of @xmath99 arcsec ( table 4 ) , measured from the hst image .",
    "such a diffuse contribution of ly@xmath1to the m - band flux would be hard to detect , and could have been partially subtracted in attempting to remove large - scale residuals from the psf subtraction ( section 4.2.1 ) .",
    "however we can not rule out the possibility that there is also a similar diffuse contribution to the continuum flux .",
    "the argument for extended ly@xmath1is made visually in figure 4 .",
    "here we compare the m - band images after subtraction of the computed contribution of the continuum ( i.e. showing the ly@xmath1emission only ) , against how the objects would have appeared if the ly@xmath1light profile were the same as the continuum profile .    to summarise , there is evidence that the regions of ly@xmath1emission from these three sources are more extended than the regions of continuum emission .",
    "although the colour and size differences quoted above are only marginally significant , these results accord with our earlier conclusion ( paper ii ) that the cause of the relatively broad ly@xmath1emission lines for s1 and s3 is resonant scattering , as the photons escape though a high column density of hi . in this picture",
    "the ly@xmath1image records the last scattering surface , which will be larger than the region of star formation .",
    "we note in passing that this implies that the observed strength of ly@xmath1absorption and emission in spectra can depend on the slit width used .      in this section",
    "we make a summary of the measured impact parameters @xmath100 of dla absorbers . using this we estimate the cross - section - weighted mean radius @xmath101 of the gas clouds at @xmath11 . combining this information with the measured line density of dla absorbers",

    "we plot impact parameter against column density for the absorbers listed in table 6 , for @xmath7 .",
    "the detection of the counterpart to a dla absorber by broad - band imaging , which requires the digital subtraction of the quasar image , is more difficult for small impact parameters where the photon noise from the quasar image is greater .",

    "the vertical line in figure 6 at @xmath129 marks the conventional lower limit of the column density of dla absorbers .",
    "the distribution of points in the figure is consistent with the expected anticorrelation between impact parameter and column density .",
    "we are interested in the mean impact parameter @xmath130 that would be measured if counterparts were detected for all dla absorbers in a large unbiased survey . from inspection of figure 6",

    "we infer the following limits on the cross - section - weighted mean radius of dla absorbers at high redshift : @xmath138 @xmath139    using these limits and the measured line density of absorbers @xmath102 we can compute limits to the ratio of the comoving space density of dla absorbers to the the local space density of spiral galaxies .",

    "( 1986 ) , and lanzetta et al .",
    "( 1991 , hereafter ltw ) .",
    "for spiral galaxies locally they adopted a galaxy luminosity function @xmath140 of schechter form , with power - law index @xmath141 , a power - law ( holmberg ) relation between radius and luminosity , of index @xmath142 , and a ratio between gas radius and optical ( holmberg ) radius @xmath143 , independent of luminosity .",
    "they found that the incidence of dla absorbers per unit redshift @xmath102 at @xmath144 was considerably higher than expected , by a factor @xmath145 , on the basis of no evolution in galaxy cross section or luminosity function normalisation .",
    "we now allow for evolution by supposing that the space density of dla absorbers is higher than the local space density of spirals by a factor @xmath146 , and that the gas radii of galaxies are larger at high redshift by a factor @xmath147 .",
    "since @xmath102 is proportional to the product of the space density and the galaxy cross section @xmath148 , we have that @xmath149 . by comparing the expected value of the cross - section - weighted radius @xmath150 to the measured limits to @xmath101",
    ", we obtain limits to @xmath147 . then from the measured values of @xmath151 we determine limits to @xmath146 , which is our goal .    under the above assumptions the cross - section - weighted average radius of dla absorbers",
    "is given by : @xmath152 @xmath153 where @xmath154 is the optical radius of a local @xmath155 spiral galaxy .",
    "following ltw we adopt the following values of the parameters : @xmath156 , @xmath157 , @xmath158 , @xmath159 kpc .",
    "this leads to @xmath160 . comparing with the above measured limits to @xmath101 we",
    "obtain the following limits to the growth factor of galaxy disks :    @xmath161 @xmath162    for their sample d2 , of which at least 30 out of the 38 candidate dla absorbers have been confirmed , ltw found @xmath163 , for @xmath10 , and @xmath164 , for @xmath7 .",
    "these results then imply that the ratio of the comoving space density of dla absorbers at high redshift to the local space density of spiral galaxies is given by : @xmath165 @xmath166 because the actual average impact parameters of dla absorbers are very likely substantially smaller than the quoted limits , the actual comoving space density ratios are probably considerably greater than the limits quoted above .    in figure 5",
    "we show also the relation between impact parameter and column density measured by katz et al ( 1996 ) from a hydrodynamic simulation of a cdm universe with @xmath7 . given the limited spatial resolution of the simulation , and the fact that star formation and consequent feedback were not treated",
    ", it would be premature to draw any conclusions about the apparent good agreement between the results of the simulation and the observations .",
    "nevertheless this plot and the above calculation underscore the importance of measuring impact parameters for a large sample of dla absorbers , a goal we are pursuing by imaging with the stis instrument on hst .",
    "the observations summarised above provide some indication of the typical structure of a dla absorber . the following sketch is suggested . at the centre of the gas cloud , corresponding in projection to the highest column densities , there may be a region of star formation , of diameter @xmath167 kpc .",
    "this central source would be observed as a lyman - break galaxy .",
    "the gas column density decreases outwards , as suggested by the anticorrelation between impact parameter and @xmath168 .",
    "the size of the region over which the column density is @xmath169@xmath104 is several kpc .",
    "the region of star formation would be surrounded by a zone of ionised gas .",
    "the ly@xmath1photons are resonantly scattered in escaping to the surface of the surrounding cloud of neutral gas .",
    "the size of the observed region of ly@xmath1emission is larger than the region of star formation , but smaller than the diameter of the gas cloud .",
    "the latter indicates a preferred direction of escape , implying that the gas resides in a flattened structure . in reality",
    "the gas cloud is likely to be irregular rather than smooth , and might contain several knots of star formation , surrounded by hii regions of different sizes , and the ly@xmath1photons will escape preferentially where the column density of neutral gas is lowest , possibly along a complex network of tunnels .",
    "merging clouds will be observed as galaxies with irregular structure .      we have previously suggested ( paper ii ) that the approximately linear arrangement of s1 , s2 , s3 , as well as other known groups at high - redshift , may correspond to the filamentary arrangements of galaxies and galaxy sub - units that are found in computer simulations of the high - redshift universe .",
    "figure 6 summarises the observational situation , and shows the spatial arrangement of four high - redshift groups of galaxies discovered in ly@xmath1searches ( from top to bottom : francis et al . , 1995 , considering the ly@xmath1absorber as a galaxy ; pascarelle et al .",
    ", 1996 ; paper i ; le fvre et al . , 1996 ) .",
    "all groups have been rotated to a horizontal baseline .",
    "clearly each of the structures is elongated .    to quantify the degree of alignment of each group we have measured the smallest internal angle @xmath171 of the triangle defined by the three objects in each group ( for the pks 0528 - 250 field at z=2.81 we used the position of s1 for the dla absorber , rather than the position of the quasar sightline through the absorber ) .",
    "the measured angles are , from top to bottom in the figure , @xmath172 .",
    "the average value of the angle @xmath173 is certainly very suggestive of filamentariness in the distribution of galaxies at high redshift .",
    "it is also notable that the sizes of the groups range over an order of magnitude . in the computer simulations filaments",
    "are seen at all scales ( e.g. evrard et al .",
    "we do not suggest that every high - redshift group of three or four galaxies discovered will exhibit a similar degree of alignment , but rather that filamentary networks akin to those seen in the simulations may become visible as larger samples of high - redshift galaxies with denser sampling become available .",
    "the phenomenon might provide a useful discriminant for models of structure formation .",
