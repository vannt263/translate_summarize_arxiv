    "a stationary random graph is a random rooted graph whose distribution is invariant under re - rooting by a simple random walk .",
    "this notion was made explicit by benjamini and curien in @xcite motivated by several examples , including the uniform infinite planar triangulation / quadrangulation ( uipt / q ) , and previously defined notions such as unimodular random graphs .",
    "in said work they develop the basic entropy theory for stationary random graphs , analogous to the well known theory for random walks on finitely generated groups , see @xcite .",
    "in particular , they define an entropy and prove that if it is zero then the random graph almost surely satisfies the liouville property ( i.e. bounded harmonic functions are constant ) .",
    "the converse implication , that positive entropy implies the existence of non - constant bounded harmonic functions , was posed as a question , see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* remark 3.7 ) .    in this work we answer this question in the afirmative under an additional condition on the stationary random graph .",
    "the hypothesis is the following ( see lemma [ speedlemma ] ) :     ( ) +    our main result is the following ( see theorem [ entropytheorem ] ) .",
    "[ maintheorem ] an ergodic stationary random graph satisfying condition ( [ condition ] ) above , has zero entropy if and only if it satisfies the liouville property almost surely .",
    "furthermore , if such a graph has positive entropy , then almost surely it admits an infinite dimensional space of bounded harmonic functions .",
    "recent work of benjamini , paquette , and pfeffer implies that the space of bounded harmonic functions on a stationary random graph must be either infinite or one dimensional ( see @xcite ) .",
    "this yields an alternate proof of the second part of the above theorem ( using the first part ) .    from the direct implication , which was already proved in their paper , benjamini and curien proved that the uniform infinite planar quadrangulation almost surely satisfies the liouville property . with the extension given by our result above , it is possible to deduce that certain stationary random graphs admit many bounded harmonic functions",
    ". we will discuss in section [ applications ] a few such examples , like the @xmath0-markovian infinite planar triangulations , introduced recently by curien in @xcite , and the hyperbolic poisson - delaunay graph .",
    "an important difficulty in applying the above theorem is the lack of general criteria for establishing that a stationary random graph has at most exponential volume growth , even when the distribution of the degree of the root is known to be well behaved . in most cases where the growth of a stationary graph is known ( e.g. the uniform infinite planar quadrangulation , or the hyperbolic poisson - delaunay graph ) it seems to have been established by ad - hoc , and some times very intricate , arguments .",
    "thus , the authors consider the following question to be important :    given a stationary random graph such that the degree of the root is well behaved . under what conditions",
    "can one deduce that the graph has at most exponential volume growth ?    to the best of the author s knowledge",
    "there is no widely applicable answer to the above question available in the literature .",
    "we discuss two relevant partial results in section [ canopysection ] .",
    "first , we give an example , due to asaf nachmias , of a stationary random graph with super - exponential growth such that the degree of the root has finite mean , and in fact is comparable to a poisson variable .",
    "the example also has the special property that the degree of the root determines the entire graph up to rooted isomorphism .",
    "second , we prove that for unimodular graphs whose root has finite expectation , if the number of elements at distance @xmath1 from the root is asymptotically independent from the degree of the root , then the graph has at most exponential growth ( see lemma [ growthlemma ] ) .",
    "our proof of the main theorem involves derriennic s zero - two law , a sharp criterion for equivalence of the tail and invariant events of a markov chain ( see corollary [ zerotwocorollary ] ) , and a `` looping '' argument which allows us to avoid parity problems ( see figure [ figuralazos ] ) . in order to show that our results are valid for graphs with unbounded degree , we improve the inequalities between the linear drift and entropy from ( * ? ? ?",
    "* proposition 3.6 ) with essentially the same proof ( see lemma [ speedlemma ] ) . to show that positive entropy implies that the space of bounded harmonic functions is infinite dimensional , we relate the dimension of this space to the mutual information between the first @xmath2 steps of a random walk and its tail behavior ( see lemma [ informationandharmoniclemma ] ) .",
