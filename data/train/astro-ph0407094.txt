    "it is generally believed , based on the analysis of type ia supernovae red shift data @xcite , that the expansion of the universe is accelerating and that this acceleration is either caused by a `` dark '' energy or is the effect of extra dimensions . in the case of dark energy",
    "this energy could be a simple cosmological constant term in einstein s equations or it could be a time dependent energy density . in any case",
    "the pressure of the dark energy must be negative to account for the acceleration .",
    "what we would really like to know , to determine the nature of past and future acceleration , is the equation of state of the dark component , @xmath0 , as a function of the scale parameter @xmath1 .",
    "this equation of state is defined as @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the pressure , @xmath4 is the energy density , and @xmath5 is given by the ratio of @xmath1 to the scale today , @xmath6 , as @xmath7 for a cosmological constant @xmath8 for all @xmath5 .",
    "if the acceleration is caused by extra dimensions it can also be parameterized as an effective @xmath9 .",
    "there now exists a new data set of measurements of the luminosity distances for type ia supernovae , which range in distance from @xmath10 to @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "this data includes some new events as well as a reanalysis of the old events .",
    "there were about @xmath12 old events @xcite some of which have been dropped and most of the rest assigned new errors .",
    "the new set consists of @xmath13 `` gold '' events or @xmath14 gold plus `` silver '' events .",
    "the gold data set gives joint confidence levels in the matter - dark energy plane with @xmath15 that are more restrictive than the earlier data and in good agreement with other constraints @xcite .",
    "this is shown in fig.[omox ] .",
    "thus , perhaps , it is not too early to ask whether this data        can distinguish between simple models for @xmath9 . to investigate this question we use a few models such as @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 to calculate a luminosity distance .",
    "we then minimize the @xmath19 of the difference between the measured and calculated luminosity distances in an attempt to determine the constant parameters @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "wmap @xcite and other experiments @xcite have accurately determined the matter density and curvature , defined as @xmath22 to be close to @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "@xmath25 is the density of matter today , @xmath26 is the hubble constant today , and @xmath27",
    ". nevertheless , because we would like to know to what extent the supernova data agrees with these other experiments , we will sometimes include @xmath28 and/or @xmath29 in our set of parameters to be fit despite the fact that this exacerbates the degeneracy problem that arises because the luminosity distance depends only on the sum of the matter , curvature and dark energy contributions .",
    "in an earlier paper @xcite , we explored the @xmath19 sensitivity of the data in refs.@xcite to simple assumptions about the dark energy density . recently",
    ", many other papers have appeared @xcite which use the data of refs.@xcite to analyze numerous models of the dark energy .",
    "a paper which is close in spirit to this work and which we had the advantage of reading before we started this work is ref.@xcite . while we disagree with some of the results and conclusions ,",
    "there is still much to like about this reference ; many more models were studied and physical motivation is given for some of the models .",
    "we , on the other hand , have chosen to consider only the simplest cases to remain as model - independent as possible .",
    "our results are not encouraging .",
    "the errors in the fitted parameters are often more than @xmath30 , in some cases much more .",
    "we estimate the error in @xmath19 itself is more than @xmath31 .",
    "still some consistencies can be seen and some patterns discerned . and while the data is not manifestly in agreement with other experiments ( e.g. , @xmath23 and @xmath24 ) it is not in disagreement .",
    "one ( negative ) result that seems very clear is that the absolute value of @xmath19 can not be used , at this time ( i.  e. , from this data set ) , to discriminate between models for @xmath9 .",
    "the luminosity distance is given by @xmath32\\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath33 is the hubble parameter @xmath34 and @xmath35 is given by the equation of state @xmath36 in eq.([dl ] ) @xmath37 $ ] is used for @xmath38 ( @xmath39 ) , @xmath40 $ ] is used for @xmath41 ( @xmath42 ) , and the unmodified square bracket is used for @xmath24 .",
    "many references give models where @xmath35 is not obviously related to an equation of state .",
    "however , from eq.([fz ] ) we see that @xmath43 , @xmath44 , and , given an explicit expression for @xmath35 , @xmath45 where the prime denotes a derivative with respect to @xmath5 .",
    "this equation can also be used to express the effects of extra dimensions as an effective @xmath9 .",
    "below we use the dimensionless luminosity distance @xmath46 and the quantity that is compared to the data is @xmath47 where @xmath48 is a constant offset between the data and the theoretical expression .",
    "the comparison is made by calculating @xmath19 where @xmath49 ^ 2}{\\sigma_i^2}.\\ ] ] the sum is over the @xmath50 events contained in the gold set @xcite and @xmath51 are the experimental errors in @xmath52 .",
    "@xmath53 , through the equation of state @xmath9 , eq.([eqs ] ) , depends on some set of parameters , @xmath54 , and we minimize @xmath19 by varying these parameters . @xmath19 also depends on @xmath48 but to minimize with respect to @xmath48 is trivial , @xmath55 where @xmath56 and @xmath57 are given by @xmath58 sometimes we use eq.([m ] ) for @xmath48 , sometimes we include @xmath48 as one of the parameters @xmath59 to be fit , and we have checked that we get the same result .",
    "the data indicates that the universe was decelerating in the past and it is of interest to know when that changed .",
    "the acceleration is given by @xmath60 and , given @xmath61 from eq.([hz ] ) , and values for the parameters , it is straightforward to find @xmath62 where @xmath63 .",
    "we consider three simple , rather ad hoc , expressions for the equation of state @xcite @xmath64 w(z)\\,&=&\\,w_0\\,+\\,w_1 z\\,,\\label{model3}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath20 and @xmath21 are constants .",
    "these expressions allow us to evaluate    .",
    "fit of supernova ia data to @xmath65 , @xmath66 ( first 3 rows ) , @xmath67 ( rows iv , v and vi ) , @xmath68 ( rows vii , viii , and ix ) and some special cases ( last three rows ) .",
    "the errors are the @xmath69 confidence level numbers .",
    "the boxes without errors mean that parameter was held fixed .",
    "if a parameter was varied no restrictions were placed on its possible values except for @xmath70 and @xmath71 .",
    "the last column uses the values of the parameters and their errors to find the @xmath5 value where the universe changes from decelerating to accelerating . [ cols=\">,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     the errors in the parameters are very consistent with those given in table[sn1a04_1 ] .",
    "in fact for the cases where only one or two parameters are fit they are almost identical .",
    "the values of @xmath19 for the individual simulations vary from @xmath72 to @xmath73 with a standard deviation of about 20 .",
    "thus , from these simulations , we conclude that the values in table[sn1a04_1 ] are robust and that @xmath74 is uncertain by @xmath75 .",
    "if we take the cosmological constant case ( @xmath76 , @xmath77 ) and fit @xmath28 _ or _ @xmath29 we get the preferred answer of @xmath78 or @xmath79 ( see models x and xi in table[sn1a04_1 ] ) . or if we hold @xmath23 and @xmath24 and fit @xmath20 we get the preferred answer of @xmath80 ( model vi )",
    ". however , if we try to fit even two of the three @xmath81 as in models v or xii , the fitted values are not the preferred ones although the errors are large enough to make the parameters consistent with the desired values .",
    "this can be seen in some detail in the @xmath82 confidence contours for model v , shown in fig.[omw0 ] .",
    "model xii , shown in more detail in fig.[omox ] , was our original     and @xmath83 ( model v ) are shown .",
    "the cross indicates the best fit , and the solid circle is the fit requiring @xmath84 .",
    "the dashed line separates accelerating ( to the left ) from decelerating ( to the right ) cosmologies.,height=288 ]      our models iii and ix are models 9 and 7 of ref.@xcite . that paper used the 2003 data set @xcite",
    "; when we ran with that data set , and included the extra error due to the peculiar velocity as in @xcite , we were able to find a smaller value for @xmath74 in both of these cases ; perhaps we used a different expression for the pecular velocity error . in any case",
    "a smaller @xmath74 is not very important in view of the large uncertainty in @xmath74 indicated by the simulations .",
    "what is important , in view of this uncertainty , is that small relative values of @xmath74 do not indicate which models are a better fit .",
    "also the ability to find the lowest @xmath19 is essential to determining the errors on the parameters ; if the lowest @xmath19 is not found the errors will appear to be smaller than they actually are .",
    "we found much larger errors for the parameters than those given in ref.@xcite and this seems not to be due to uncertainity in handling the pecular velocity error .",
    "for example our result for model iii is @xmath85 , @xmath86 .",
    "if we include structure in @xmath9 , as in models i , ii , iii , which use @xmath18 or vii , viii , ix , which use @xmath16 , then the errors get very large and it is hard to draw any conclusions even if @xmath28 and @xmath29 are fixed . what does seem clear , from the similarity of the results for models i and vii , ii and viii , and iii and ix is that low @xmath5 events are still dominating .",
    "( @xmath21 of models vii , viii , and ix should be compared with @xmath87 of models i , ii , and iii . )",
    "the factor of @xmath88 in the denominator of eq.([model1 ] ) is effectively just @xmath89 .",
    "we have checked that this is also true for the gold plus silver data set . thus comparing models for the equation of state of the dark energy will remain something of a mug s game until there exists substantially more data at higher values of @xmath5 .",
