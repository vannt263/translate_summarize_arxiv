    "recent observations of the central stellar cluster of our galaxy reveal that the brightest k - giant stars ( @xmath13m@xmath4 agb stars or more - massive supergiants ) are depleted within @xmath0pc from sgr a@xmath14 , the dynamical centre of the milky way ( genzel 1996 ) .",
    "the missing stars are highly luminous and are therefore very large , and so genzel ( 1996 ) concluded that stellar collisions were a likely explanation for the paucity if the cluster s core density is sufficiently large to make collisions frequent and if such collisions permanently destroyed the photospheres of giants .",
    "the effects of stellar collisions on giant stars have been previously investigated in the context of globular clusters ( davies , benz & hills 1991 ; 1992 ) .",
    "such collisions often resulted in the impactor becoming bound to the giant s core within the envelope of the giant , forming a _ common envelope _ system .",
    "in such systems , the impactor and the core spiral towards each other and the binding energy released is deposited in the envelope which is ejected on time - scales shorter than the evolutionary time - scale of the giant . by this method",
    "the giant is destroyed , leaving behind a binary comprised of the impactor and the giant s core .",
    "collisions in galactic centres differ from those in globular clusters due to the higher velocities involved .",
    "the higher velocity dispersions in galactic nuclei ( @xmath15km / s ) mean that incoming stars are faster and so are less likely to form bound systems than in globular cluster cores ( @xmath16km / s ) .    in this paper",
    "we investigate the frequency of two - body collisions involving main - sequence stars and also red giants .",
    "the red giants investigated are similar to those observed to be depleted in the galactic centre ( hereafter gc ) .",
    "we simulate a number of encounters involving the giants , quantifying the mass loss and probability of forming bound systems .",
    "if the gc contains binary stars , the collision time - scale between giants and binaries may be significant if the cluster density is sufficiently large . in a companion paper , davies ( 1998 )",
    ", we extend this study to collisions involving binary impactors .",
    "in @xmath172 we consider the stellar contents , motions and distribution within the central parsec of our galaxy , and we discuss the possible nature of the stars that currently can not be detected . the stellar density profile and velocity dispersion",
    "are then used to calculate collision time - scales in @xmath173 . in @xmath174",
    "we consider how devastating an encounter must be to destroy a giant .",
    "we discuss our approach to simulating collisions involving red giants in @xmath175 and we present our results in @xmath176 . in a number of collisions",
    "the impactor will become bound to the giant star .",
    "we comment on the nature of such systems in @xmath177 , prior to discussing our results in @xmath178 .",
    "alternative methods of destruction for the giants are explored in @xmath179 .",
    "we summarise our findings in @xmath1710 .",
    "dust in the plane of our galaxy obscures the gc by @xmath18 magnitudes of visual extinction ( rieke , rieke & paul 1989 ) . the infra - red k band ( @xmath19 m ) extinction is much less severe , a@xmath20 magnitudes ( rieke , rieke & paul 1989 ) .",
    "the large distance to the gc ( @xmath21kpc ) gives a distance modulus of 14.6 which , coupled with a@xmath20 , limits stellar observations to giant stars . within the central @xmath22pc of our galaxy",
    "there are @xmath23 red giants of magnitude k@xmath24 ( eckart 1995 ) .",
    "however , the brightest red giants are _ not observed _ in the deepest parts of the galactic nucleus . observations show sharp drops in the numbers of @xmath25k@xmath26 stars at @xmath27pc and of k@xmath28 stars at @xmath0pc ( genzel 1996 ) .",
    "these highly luminous stars are unlikely to have been overlooked by observations . indeed , the number counts in genzel ( 1996 ) of @xmath25k@xmath26 giants are likely to be @xmath29 complete and the numbers of the k@xmath28 stars are @xmath30 complete ( genzel , private communication ) . at slightly larger galactocentric radii ,",
    "giants of similar luminosity to those missing have a surface - density profile , @xmath31 , for projected radius @xmath32 . assuming that this profile should extend further into the core , we estimate the numbers of missing giants to be twenty - five k@xmath28 magnitude stars and eleven @xmath25k@xmath26 magnitude stars . if the surface density were flat within the region of missing giants then lower limits of the numbers of missing k@xmath28 and @xmath25k@xmath26 giants are eleven and six respectively .",
    "we note that the _ precipitous _ drop , rather than a gradual one , indicates that some mechanism has actively destroyed at least @xmath33 stars in the central @xmath10pc",
    ".      the outcome of a collision between two stars will depend on their masses and sizes ( evolutionary phases ) .",
    "it is useful to visualise the types of stars detectable ( and those which are missing ) at the gc using a hr diagram . for a star of given temperature and bolometric luminosity",
    ", its apparent k - magnitude may be calculated using bolometric corrections and v - k colours ( johnson 1966 ) and by assuming a distance modulus and a k - extinction law .",
    "taking the galactocentric distance to be @xmath34kpc , figure  [ fig : hr1 ] shows a hr digram with contours of constant k appropriate for the gc , assuming a@xmath35 and a@xmath36 .",
    "the effects of uncertainties in the gc distance on the masses and numbers of stars one expects to see at the gc are small compared with uncertainties in a@xmath37 .",
    "rieke , rieke & paul ( 1989 ) report a@xmath38 ; more recently blum , sellgren & depoy ( 1996 ) have derived a mean k - extinction of @xmath39 but note that a@xmath37 may reach six in places .",
    "( ; 0cm)fig1.ps    we see from figure  [ fig : hr1 ] that , for both values of a@xmath37 , the cool , visible stars must be giants and that we can not easily determine their masses because of the closeness of the hayashi tracks .",
    "the figure does , however , imply that a visible low - mass star will likely be on the agb phase , whilst for stars of increasing masses the horizontal branch becomes increasingly visible .",
    "the duration for which a star of a given k - magnitude is visible is an irregular function of its mass ( figure  [ fig : times ] ) depending on whether either the long - lived main - sequence or horizontal - branch phases coincide with the chosen k - magnitude .",
    "figure  [ fig : times ] highlights the great sensitivity of the visible durations of stars on a@xmath37 . if a@xmath35 , stars of masses @xmath40m@xmath4 can not be detected at k@xmath41 .",
    "if a@xmath36 , then stars of mass @xmath42m@xmath4 can not be detected at k@xmath28 and the time - scale for which the stars are visible falls sharply for masses @xmath43m@xmath4 .",
    "( ; 0cm)fig2.ps    assuming a@xmath35 , stars of most masses are brighter than k=10.5 for about @xmath44 years and most stars of magnitude @xmath25k@xmath26 are visible for @xmath45 years . for stars of masses in the region of @xmath46m@xmath4",
    ", the horizontal branch shines in the @xmath25k@xmath26 band rather than in the @xmath47k@xmath48 band .",
    "we thus see a steep drop in the time that such stars spend in the fainter band , and a corresponding peak in the brighter band .",
    "the @xmath25k@xmath26 range corresponds to the hertzsprung gap for stars of higher masses and so the @xmath25k@xmath26 durations drop .",
    "the bulk of detectable stars sit in the @xmath47k@xmath49 bin in which low - mass stars are visible for @xmath50 years ( still assuming that a@xmath35 ) ; higher - mass stars are visible for @xmath51 years .",
    "the fluctuation in visible duration for low - mass stars in the @xmath47k@xmath49 range is due to changes in positioning of the core - helium burning phase with respect to the k@xmath52 contour .",
    "increasing a@xmath37 to four generally decreases the visible time - scales by a factor of a few ( but within an order of magnitude ) .",
    "some stars may have their visible time - scales boosted in some k - magnitude range because , say , their horizontal branches now correspond to a lower k - magnitude bin in which , for lower a@xmath53 , only part of their giant branches had been detectable .",
    "the contours of constant k - magnitude on figure  [ fig : hr1 ] show that detectable stars must be either evolved stars of a range of masses or very massive stars if they are on the main sequence .",
    "if the gc population consists mainly of low - mass main - sequence stars and stellar remnants then we only glimpse a small fraction of the total mass of the gc stellar population .",
    "indeed , the detectable stars motions and distribution have been used to measure the total mass in the central parsec to be @xmath54m@xmath4 , of which @xmath55m@xmath4 is the mass of the putative supermassive black hole at the centre of the cluster ( genzel 1996 , eckart & genzel 1997 ) .",
    "the amount of stellar mass in the central parsec is therefore about @xmath56m@xmath4 .",
    "we saw in @xmath172.2 that only stars of masses @xmath57m@xmath4 may be seen in the gc if a@xmath58 . assuming a scalo imf , stars of masses",
    "@xmath59m@xmath4 can account for about a quarter of the mass of the population , if the mass contribution from stellar remnants is small .",
    "figure  [ fig : times ] shows that low - mass giants may be detectable for about @xmath60 years , depending on the stellar mass .",
    "given that a @xmath61m@xmath4 star lives for @xmath62 years ( pols 1999 ) , for a constant star - formation rate one might expect to see @xmath63 stars within the central parsec .",
    "this is about a factor of two higher than , but is not wildly inconsistent with , the number counts one would observe by extrapolating the observed numbers of stars within @xmath64pc ( eckart 1995 ) out to a radius of @xmath65pc .",
    "a more detailed population synthesis was performed by genzel ( 1994 ) ; they found that the gc stellar contents were inconsistent with a constant star - formation history and salpeter imf .",
    "detailed analyses are , however , hampered by uncertainties in a@xmath37 , possible incompleteness in the observed number counts and that there may not be a unique solution of imf or star - formation history ( or of both ) which reproduces the observations .    the situation is even further complicated by the possibility of a raised low - mass cut - off to star formation at the gc ( morris 1993 ) . for a cut - off of @xmath66m@xmath4 and a constant star - formation history , one might expect roughly equal numbers of white dwarfs and main - sequence stars .",
    "higher low - mass cut - offs may allow stellar remnants to dominate the population , assuming that the population is old .",
    "a further complication is that the gc stellar contents may not be totally indigenous .",
    "morris ( 1993 ) calculates the mass fractions of neutron stars and black holes that may have segregated into the central parsec from outside .",
    "solutions computed by morris ( 1993 ) allow most of the gc mass to be accounted for by black holes and neutron stars .",
    "these calculations , however , suffer from requiring some parameters that are not well constrained , such as the low - mass cut - off and the mass of stellar black holes .",
    "for example , lowering the mass of stellar black holes from @xmath67m@xmath4 to @xmath68m@xmath4 and adopting a low - mass cut - off of @xmath69m@xmath4 reduces the mass - fraction of neutron stars and stellar - mass black holes to @xmath70 by mass .",
    "there will almost certainly be non - indigenous remnants in the gc , but in quantities which are currently poorly constrained .",
    "the overall mass function of the gc population is therefore very uncertain .",
    "for a@xmath35 , we might expect most of the missing giants to be of low masses ( say , @xmath61m@xmath71m@xmath4 ) , for most imfs .",
    "however , the uncertainty in a@xmath37 could mean that the brightest missing stars are of masses @xmath72m@xmath4 .",
    "an observed number density of stars traces that of the whole cluster if the mean mass of the cluster stars is close to the mean mass of the observed stars and if the system is relaxed .",
    "the relaxation time ( see binney & tremaine 1987 ) at @xmath10pc is @xmath73 years for a @xmath65m@xmath4 star , so we expect low - mass ( @xmath74m@xmath4 ) giants to trace the overall distribution of stars of similar masses .",
    "relaxation time decreases with the mass of the star but more - massive stars do not live long enough to become relaxed in the gc .",
    "such stars should be treated cautiously as mass tracers .",
    "genzel ( 1996 ) model the observed red - giant number - density distribution to be @xmath75 for galactocentric radius , @xmath76 .",
    "we adopt this equation , assuming that the observed stars are indeed tracing the whole population .",
    "this assumption is somewhat supported by the stars isotropic motions ( genzel 1996 , eckart & genzel 1997 ) , indicating a relaxed population .",
    "genzel ( 1996 ) also give the central stellar density , @xmath77 , to be @xmath78m@xmath79pc@xmath80 and a core radius of @xmath81pc .",
    "we normalise equation  ( [ eqn : ndens ] ) with this value of @xmath77 but note that @xmath77 and the core radius are interlinked values and that the latter is subject to some debate , depending on whether the cluster s surface - brightness distribution or the surface - density distribution is used ( see genzel 1994 ) . by varying @xmath77 and the core radius between @xmath82pc and @xmath64pc whilst conserving the total central - parsec mass within errors set by genzel ( 1996 ) , we find that the collision time - scales for stars ( see @xmath173 ) can vary by up to a factor of 1.5",
    ".    we also note that equation  ( [ eqn : ndens ] ) gives quite a flat profile inside the core radius .",
    "however , observations become crowded within this radius and it becomes harder to constrain the density distribution .",
    "if the condensed mass at sgr a@xmath1 is a black hole , theoretical modelling predicts a density cusp at low radii : @xmath83 where @xmath84 ( quinlan , hernquist & sigurdsson 1995 ; see also bahcall & wolfe 1976 ) .",
    "consequently we also calculate collision rates assuming @xmath85 ( coinciding with the higher - radius density profile at the gc ) , which we set equal to the density profile of genzel ( 1996 ) for @xmath86pc where we expect the latter to be accurate .",
    "a final comment on equation  ( [ eqn : ndens ] ) is that it is based upon ( m / l)@xmath87 , the mass - to - light ratio evaluated at a few parsecs from the centre .",
    "genzel ( 1996 ) claim that their usage of only brighter cluster members reduces the effects of population change at lower radii",
    ". there does exist some evidence of an increase in ( m / l)@xmath37 at low radii : saha ( 1996 ) show that this ratio may increase by a factor of 3 - 5 between @xmath88pc and @xmath64pc , although if one subtracts @xmath55m@xmath4 for the putative central black hole then the increase in ( m / l)@xmath37 _ for the cluster only _ reduces to two .",
    "collision - rate calculations require a velocity dispersion ( see @xmath173 ) .",
    "we adopt the deprojected velocity dispersion given by genzel ( 1996 ) : @xmath89 the velocity dispersion rises as galactocentric radius falls due to the presence of the supermassive black hole ( see also eckart & genzel 1997 ) . at higher radii ,",
    "the enclosed cluster mass dominates and @xmath90 flattens out .",
    "equation  ( [ eqn : sig1 ] ) is valid throughout the central parsec .",
    "the collision rate per star of species 1 with stars of species 2 is @xmath91 where @xmath92 is the number density of stars and @xmath93 is the probability that two stars have _ relative _ speed @xmath94 .",
    "@xmath95 is the gravitationally focused cross section : @xmath96 where @xmath97 and @xmath98 are the stellar masses and @xmath99 is the collision radius ( which we take to be equal to the sum of the radii of the two colliding stars ) .",
    "the second term on the right in @xmath95 represents the mutual attraction between two stars which increases the cross section above that of the geometric value .",
    "we take @xmath93 to be maxwellian , which is appropriate at high galactocentric radii where the stellar cluster dominates the enclosed mass . in the region where the black hole dominates the enclosed mass ( say , @xmath100pc ,",
    "see genzel 1996 , eckart & genzel 1997 ) , @xmath93 is still close to maxwellian ( quinlan 1995 ) . at any galactocentric radius",
    "we take the _ relative _ velocity dispersion between two stellar species of any mass to be @xmath101 , where the variation of @xmath90 with galactocentric radius is given by equation  ( [ eqn : sig1 ] ) . in a system of stars that has achieved equipartition of energy",
    ", we have @xmath102 ( see binney & tremaine 1987 ) ; stars of different masses would have different velocity dispersions .",
    "the effects of equipartition on the collision rates do not change our conclusions .    assuming number - density and velocity - dispersion profiles discussed in @xmath172 , figure  [ fig : timesc ] shows collision time - scales for the gc .",
    "the collision time - scale is a strong function of @xmath76 and is shortest deep within the core . comparing figure  [ fig : timesc ] with figure  [ fig : times ]",
    "we see that the time - scales for collisions involving giants are similar to the durations for which they are visible at the gc .",
    "the collision time - scale for solar - type stars is considerably longer .",
    "it is only noticeably less than a hubble time at very low radii if the density profile is a cusp ( within @xmath103pc , assuming @xmath104 ) .",
    "( ; 0cm)fig3.ps    ( ; 0cm)fig4.ps    the calculations shown in figure  [ fig : timesc ] have used an instantaneous radius for the stars .",
    "such calculations lose their meaning , however , if the stellar radius changes on time - scales shorter than the collision time - scale .",

    "to determine whether stellar collisions may destroy giant stars , one needs to know how much envelope mass a giant must lose before it is destroyed . strictly speaking , to satisfy the observed paucity we must strongly reduce the k - magnitude of the brightest giants . considering mild encounters where the mass lost is insufficient to alter the giant s long - term evolution",
    ", we actually expect a transient _ increase _ in the stellar k - luminosity : the impactor loses some of its kinetic energy to the envelope which consequently expands somewhat , becomes redder and therefore brighter in the k - band .",

    "figure  [ fig : detime ] shows that at such low radii , the time - scale for a @xmath8m@xmath4 giant to undergo a collision that leads to a common - envelope system is longer than the stellar lifetime ; this is very likely also true for a @xmath151m@xmath4 giant .",
    "thus the formation of bound systems can not destroy enough of the giants to account for the paucity .",
    "the mass lost from the envelope drops with increasing impact speed , and so collisions at very low galactocentric radii will involve lower mass losses than the ( small ) quantities reported in @xmath260 . individually , therefore , solar mass impactors can not destroy the giants , but it may be possible that the giants could be progressively stripped of their envelopes over the many collisions that they would suffer .",
    "impacts of speeds germane to the very low - radius gc ( @xmath261km / s ) with solar - mass impactors will only remove small amounts of envelope mass from either giant , and so it is unclear whether solar - mass impactors may be effective in destroying giants .",
    "impactors of greater mass may be more effective . for a target giant in a sea",
    "comprised solely of @xmath9m@xmath4 impactors ( black holes ) , the number of collisions will be reduced by a factor of eight compared to solar - type impactors . cumulative mass loss via several collisions may remove most of the giants envelopes . alternatively ,",
    "if a giant is likely to undergo several collisions with very massive impactors , there may be a significant probability of a very low impact - parameter collision .",
    "this raises the possibility of the core being pulled out of the envelope by the massive impactor , thereby destroying the giant .",
    "an important problem with this high - mass impactor scenario is that @xmath8m@xmath4 stars generally can not sink as far into the gc if the local mean mass increases from our assumed @xmath65m@xmath4 to @xmath9m@xmath4 .",
    "collisions involving mass - segregating main - sequence stars may be important in the destruction of stars before they evolve into giants . unlike the giant phase , the main - sequence stars will undergo collisions distributed over the range of radii through which the stars sink . for the main - sequence counterparts of the two giants considered above ,",
    "the upper limit of the numbers collisions suffered is about 30 collisions for the @xmath8m@xmath4 star and about two collisions for the @xmath151m@xmath4 star , for solar - type impactors and assuming a cusp - like density profile .",
    "collisions between main - sequence stars at the high speeds involved may lead to a significant amount of mass loss and possibly a merger of the two stars , depending on the impact parameter and mass ratio of the colliders ( benz & hills 1987 , 1992 ; lai , rasio & shapiro 1993 ) .",
    "it is quite possible that potential giants may be destroyed via mass loss in collisions whilst on the main - sequence , if the deep gc density profile is cusp - like .",
    "the merging of the two main - sequence stars into a higher - mass star has the effect of removing two potential lower - mass giants from the galactic centre whilst adding a higher - mass star that will eventually evolve into a massive giant .",
    "if such a process occurs , then it is inconsistent with the paucity observed by genzel ( 1996 ) because massive giants are extremely luminous whereas the observations show an absence of such stars in the deep gc .",
    "another consideration must be the process of _ resonant dynamical friction _",
    "( see @xmath262 ) , which may take place deep in the gc . as the mass - segregation time - scale is similar to the relaxation time - scale , resonant dynamical friction may give rise to segregation time - scales shorter than the normal segregation time by a factor @xmath263 ( see rauch & tremaine 1996 ) , where @xmath264 is the enclosed stellar mass inside a given radius .",
    "this process should not occur for a system in which the orbits are isotropic ( rauch & tremaine 1996 ) . in a spherically symmetric , well - mixed distribution of orbits , however",
    ", the density profile can not decrease inwards .",
    "obviously , the observed paucity of the brightest red giants means that the density distribution of those stars does decrease inwardly within the central @xmath0pc , thereby implying that the brightest giants orbits are not well - mixed or isotropic .",
    "however , resonant dynamical friction allows orbits to drift in angular momentum space , rather than in energy space and thus their semi - major axes would remain constant .",
    "the galactic centre likely harbours a @xmath265m@xmath4 black hole ( eckart & genzel 1997 ) .",
    "stars will be disrupted if they approach the black hole to within the tidal radius , which is given by ( hills 1975 ) : @xmath266 where @xmath267m@xmath4 and @xmath268 is the mean density of the star .",
    "we find that @xmath269pc = @xmath270r@xmath4 for a star of mass @xmath9m@xmath4 and radius @xmath146r@xmath4 .",
    "for a giant of mass @xmath8m@xmath4 and radius @xmath144r@xmath4 , @xmath271pc .",
    "in other words , if these giants had orbital semi - major axes of 0.1pc , they would require eccentricities @xmath272 for them to be disrupted . assuming isotropic orbits , the probability , @xmath273 , of a star being on an orbit that takes it inside the tidal radius is given by ( sigurdsson & rees 1997 ) : @xmath274 where @xmath275 is the semi - major axis of the star s orbit . for the star of mass @xmath9m@xmath4 and radius @xmath146r@xmath4 , @xmath276 .",
    "the observed paucity of giants may be explained by tidal disruption only if , on time - scales shorter than the giants lifetimes , the orbits of _ all _ the giants are scattered into the phase space occupied by the loss cone .",
    "the time - scale for such scattering to occur is usually taken to be the relaxation time [ equation  ( [ eqn : trel ] ) ] , but nearly keplerian potentials ( such as that near the central black hole ) can allow faster _ resonant relaxation _ to occur ( rauch & tremaine 1996 ) .",
    "this process is important within the galactocentric radius at which @xmath277 ( rauch & ingalls 1998 ) , where @xmath278 is the total enclosed stellar mass . within the region of missing bright giants ( @xmath279pc ) ,",
    "@xmath280 satisfies this condition , assuming either the cusp - like density profile or that of genzel ( 1996 ) ( see @xmath281 ) .",
    "the resonant relaxation time - scale is given by rauch & tremaine ( 1996 ) : @xmath282 well inside the region in which the bright giants are depleted , say at 0.1pc , @xmath283 years , assuming a mean stellar mass of @xmath284m@xmath4 and assuming the density profile of genzel 1996 ( the cusp - like profile actually gives rise to longer resonant relaxation time - scales as the enclosed stellar mass is higher ) .",
    "given the small size of @xmath273 and also that the resonant relaxation time is longer than the giant phases of the stars ( see table  [ tbl : time ] ) , we conclude that tidal disruption via relaxation can not account for the paucity .",
    "giants may also enter the loss cone via precession if the gc stellar distribution ( and thus potential ) were flattened from spherical , as the total angular momentum of a giant in such a potential is not conserved .",
    "if the flattening is along , say , the @xmath285-direction , then two of the star s angular momentum components ( @xmath286 and @xmath287 ) are not conserved whereas @xmath288 is conserved .",
    "for giant stars on orbits of @xmath289pc to pass within @xmath290 of the black hole , the required values of @xmath291 represent only a small fraction of the full range available .",
    "thus precession into the loss cone in a flattened asymmetric potential in the gc can not account for the missing bright giants .",
    "we conclude that tidal disruption can not account for the paucity of the bright giant stars .",
    "interactions between binary stars and red giants in the gc were considered by davies ( 1998 ) .",
    "such interactions can explain the observed paucity only if the giants are low mass ( @xmath8m@xmath4 rather than @xmath9m@xmath4 ) and also if the stars can be hit at earlier stages of their evolution . a high binary fraction in the gc population is also required .",
    "if these conditions are satisfied then hard binaries will be more destructive towards giants than single stars .",
    "for stellar collisions to occur in a binary - single star encounter , one expects @xmath292 .",
    "the collision rate for such encounters is less dependent on the individual size of the interacting stars than are two - body encounter rates .",
    "thus main - sequence stars , which are smaller but longer lived than giants , will play a greater role in 2 + 1 body encounters than in single - single collisions .",
    "if a sufficient number of collisions occur in 2 + 1 body encounters then the _ precursors _ of the bright - giant stars may be destroyed before they ascend the giant branch .",
    "this will be investigated in future work .    for sufficiently tight binaries ,",
    "the size of the primary s roche lobe limits the primary s size , or may even lead to the premature end of the primary s evolution .",
    "the binary separation , @xmath293 , for which single cluster members have _ just _ enough kinetic energy to break up the binary is given by : @xmath294 ( davies 1995 ) where @xmath154 is the relative velocity between the binary and the single star ; @xmath295 , @xmath296 and @xmath208 are respectively the masses of the two binary components and the mass of a third - body intruder .",
    "deep in the gc , the mass of the central black hole dominates , forcing stars to follow keplerian orbits ( see eckart & genzel 1997 ) .",
    "as the velocities and velocity dispersions of the stars are independent of the their masses , the _ relative _ velocity dispersion between a binary @xmath297 and single star @xmath298 is therefore @xmath299 and the mean - square velocity is @xmath300 .",
    "substituting @xmath301 for @xmath302 in equation  ( [ eqn : dhs ] ) , we find for @xmath195 appropriate for the gc , @xmath293 is indeed small ( @xmath303r@xmath4 for @xmath304m@xmath4 ) .",
    "the time - scale for two objects to pass within , say , @xmath305r@xmath4 of each other deep in the gc is @xmath306years . with the exception of the tightest binaries , most binaries",
    "will have been ionised before the primary could evolve off the main sequence .",
    "we therefore expect most of the gc giant stars to be single and so the observed paucity of bright giants can not be explained in terms of giants evolution being restricted in tight binaries .",
    "another problem with this scenario is that it does not explain why the bright giants disappear rather precipitously at about @xmath10pc .",
    "our chief conclusions may be summarised as follows :    1 .",
    "the mass losses that result from single - single stellar encounters involving red giants in the galactic centre are almost always low ( @xmath166m@xmath4 ) .",
    "only a very small number of collisions will involve sufficient mass loss to destroy the giant .",
    "such collisions require low @xmath99 ( @xmath180r@xmath4 ) and preferentially high - mass impactors ( @xmath185m@xmath4 ) .",
    "such high mass loss collisions are thus unlikely to account for the observed paucity of bright red giants .",
    "2 .   mass loss was found to be an increasing function of impactor mass and decreasing functions of @xmath99 and @xmath94 reflecting that gravitational forces rather than shock mechanisms dominated the collisions .",
    "tidal capture of impactors by giant stars is unlikely to occur in the galactic centre .",
    "most collisions involved the impactor passing through the giants and remaining unbound .",
    "this is due to the high velocity dispersion associated with the galactic centre .",
    "4 .   the fraction of the impactor s orbital energy ( @xmath188 ) deposited in the giant increased with impactor mass and decreased with increasing @xmath99 and @xmath94 .",
    "for sufficiently small @xmath307 and @xmath94 the impactor became bound to the giant , immediately forming a common envelope system or an eccentric binary system which would rapidly decay into a common envelope system .",
    "the fraction of collisions resulting in these bound systems was @xmath308 at a few pc , decreasing to @xmath309 at very low radii , depending upon the impactor mass . at the radius at which the luminous giants are missing ( @xmath310pc ) , the fraction was @xmath311 .",
    "we showed that many of these common envelope systems formed would lead to total envelope ejection for the @xmath8m@xmath4 giant and also for the @xmath9m@xmath4 giant if the efficiency was high or the impactor was a high - mass main - sequence star or a stellar remnant .",
    "however , even if all common envelope systems destroy the giant , the time - scale for collisions which result in these bound systems was at least the _ entire _ lifetimes of stars of masses @xmath238m@xmath4 and so could not account for the paucity of the giants .",
    "the time - scale for creating bound systems was only weakly dependent of the impactor mass and so can reveal little about the nature of the undetectable stellar population of the galactic centre . 7 .   giants ( or their precursors ) within the gc _ may _ be destroyed in collisions involving high mass losses if their orbits are sufficiently eccentric to take the stars deeper into the galactic nucleus where the collision rate is higher .",
    "this requires , however , that we currently significantly underestimate the stellar density deep in the gc .",
    "dynamical friction and resonant dynamical friction may allow stars , originally on wide orbits at about 0.2pc ( the outer radius at which bright giants are observed to be missing ) , to travel deep into the galactic nucleus , thereby becoming subject to a greatly increased collision rate .",
    "this study does not rule out the possibility of the bright giants ( or their precursors ) being destroyed in such collisions .",
    "this process is only significant , however , if the galactic - centre has a cusp - like density profile , rather than the observed flattened profile .",
    "the absence of the giant stars is not due to tidal disruption around a central black hole of mass @xmath55m@xmath4 , nor does it seem likely to be due to single - single stellar collisions involving giants . to explain the paucity in terms of stellar collisions requires investigation into the collisional effects of binary stars upon pre - giant stars .",
    "hard binaries in the galactic centre may well have separations too small for the primary to evolve into a giant .",
    "this also , however , means that most binaries will have been ionised and so most giants will be single stars ( unless , perhaps , they exchange into a binary ) .",
    "it also does not seem to explain why the numbers of bright giants plummet rapidly at @xmath310pc .",
