    "galactic formation and evolution is one of the most outstanding problems in modern astrophysics .",
    "one way to address this question is through galactic archaeology , which is an approach to explore the formation and evolution history of the milky way through the @xmath5archeological  record provided by its individual stars .",
    "we are coming into a new era of galactic investigation , in which galactic archaeology can be studied with massive spectroscopic surveys .",
    "the spectra generated by these surveys are range from @xmath6 to @xmath7 , for examples , rave @xcite , segue @xcite , apogee @xcite , galah @xcite , lamost @xcite , _ gaia _",
    "@xcite , argos @xcite , 4most @xcite , and weave @xcite .",
    "valuable information , that can be extracted from these spectroscopic surveys , include fundamental stellar parameters , chemical compositions , and radial velocities of individual stars . with the compilations of these massive surveys in the next decade",
    ", our knowledge of galactic formation and evolution will be significantly improved .    as a unique campaign among these surveys",
    ", apogee operates in the near - infrared band and is able to target stars at very low galactic latitude @xcite , this penetrating the veil of interstellar dust . besides observing disk stars",
    ", apogee also targets two other components : the halo and the bulge .",
    "it has pencil - beam observations of red giants in the halo that target fields in the bulge .",
    "the primary goal of apogee is to provide constraints on the dynamical and chemical evolution model of our milky way .",
    "numerous galactic structure and stellar population issues can be addressed by the apogee data . in order to take full advantage of this",
    "massive spectroscopic data set , and make a full use of the chemical information , we need to analyze the 6d phase - space distribution of stars in the milky way , which is usually hampered by a lack of reliable distance data .",
    "the most accurate and successful direct distances measurements are from the _ hipparcos _ satellite , which provide trigonometric parallaxes for @xmath8 stars .",
    "however , the _ hipparcos _ measurements are only accurate to a distance around @xmath9 pc @xcite . in the near future , the recently launched _",
    "mission ( perryman 2005 ) will return parallax and proper motion measurements for around @xmath10 stars , which will contribute to this field substantially .",
    "however , even after the _ gaia _ mission is completed , stars with direct distance measurements are still less than 1% of all stars in the milky way .",
    "indirect distance determination methods for more distant stars , especially for apogee stars with heavy extinction in the low latitude disk region , and in the bulge , are still highly desired .",
    "several indirect methods for determining stellar distance have been developed .",
    "red clump ( rc ) stars has been used as standard candles to calculate stellar distances @xcite .",
    "since the rc stage is very short in the whole stellar evolutionary life of a star , in general , this method is only suitable for a small fraction of stars .",
    "asteroseismology can determine stellar parameters , such as stellar mass , radius , and age @xcite , with high precision .",
    "these parameters are then employed , together with other stellar parameters determined with classical methods , e.g. , metallicity and effective temperature , to accurately estimate intrinsic stellar properties , such as distance and extinction .",
    "@xcite have clearly demonstrated that distance can be obtained with high accuracy when coupled with asteroseismic information .",
    "however , the asteroseismology method requires systematic variability studies of its targets .",
    "it not only needs the target stars to have detectable seismic activities , but also requires observing a very time consuming data set .",
    "till now , only small patch of sky coverage has become available with asteroseismology data @xcite , and many stars within the coverage area do have asteroseismic data for accurate distance determinations .",
    "therefore , more general methods of deriving stellar distance are needed .    to take advantage of large sets of available spectroscopic and photometric data from recent surveys ,",
    "more general methods to infer stellar parameters , such as extinction , mass , age , distance , etc , have been explored by many authors @xcite .",
    "because of its importance , many among these works focus on distance determination @xcite .",
    "these authors use spectroscopic and photometric quantities to compute the probability distribution of stellar parameters , to infer distance of individual stars .",
    "the logistics of these works are similar , but different authors may implement the method in slightly different ways . for instance",
    ", some use estimated uncertainties of measured stellar parameters , some do not .",
    "authors may treat extinction differently , use different theoretical evolutionary models , use different prior knowledge of the galaxy , etc .    in this work ,",
    "we follow the same bayesian method as @xcite to derive distances for around @xmath11 stars in the apogee survey .",
    "the extinction is considered consistently along with the distance determination .",
    "the plan for the paper is as follows . in section 2",
    ", we briefly introduce the bayesian method adopted in this work , while the apogee data from sdss dr12 are described in section 3 . in sections 4 and 5",
    ", we compare our bayesian distances and extinctions with those from other independent methods .",
    "finally , the conclusion is presented in section 6 .",
    "the bayesian method adopted here is the same as used by @xcite , in which the distances and extinctions were calculated for around one million stars in the first data release of the lamost survey @xcite .",
    "the accuracy of the derived distances have been extensively tested with both simulation and several independent measurements utilizing lamost data .",
    "the check shows that a good accuracy can be achieved with the implemented bayesian method in @xcite .",
    "the method is very similar to those in @xcite and @xcite . for clarity",
    "we give a brief description on this method .",
    "for each star we have the relevant observables : effective temperature @xmath12 , metallicity @xmath13 , surface gravity @xmath4 , and near infrared photometries @xmath14 .",
    "these quantities form an observed vector : @xmath15 each star can be related and characterized by a set of @xmath5intrinsic  parameters : metallicity @xmath13 , age @xmath16 , initial mass @xmath17 , position on the sky @xmath18 , and distance from the sun @xmath19 .",
    "these quantities form another vector : @xmath20 with the help of trivial bayesian theory , we can derive the posterior probability of @xmath21 , which is the conditional probability of the parameter set @xmath22 given @xmath23 .",
    "@xmath24    @xmath23 and @xmath22 can be connected by theoretical isochrones , with @xmath23 being a function of @xmath22 .",
    "@xmath25 is the probability that the set of observations was made and does not depend on @xmath22 , which is a normalization factor .",
    "@xmath26 is the probability that the set of observations @xmath23 gives the set of parameters @xmath22 .",
    "we assume the uncertainties of the measured observables for each component of @xmath23 can be described as a gaussian distribution with a mean @xmath27 and standard deviation @xmath28 .",
    "@xmath29    @xmath30 is the prior probability we ascribe to the set of parameters , which is an important ingredient in the bayesian method .",
    "@xcite used a three - component prior model of the galaxy for the distribution functions of metallicity , density , and age :    @xmath31    where the @xmath32 correspond to thin- , thick - disk , and stellar halo , respectively .",
    "a slightly modified kroupa - type imf is adopted as shown in @xcite and @xcite . the same as @xcite , an extinction prior , which employs the three - dimensional milky way extinction model ,",
    "is used to calculate the extinction by integrating along each line of sight toward individual stars .    having the posterior probability distribution function , @xmath33 , the mean and standard deviation for each parameters in @xmath22",
    "can be obtained by taking the first and second moments of this distribution as shown by @xcite . besides providing the distance @xmath34 , this bayesian method can also output another distance estimator , the parallax @xmath35 . in general , there is the relation between these two distance estimators , @xmath36 @xmath37 @xmath38 , which can be attributed to the weights that each estimator attaches to the possibilities of long or short distance@xcite .",
    "@xcite find that @xmath38 is a good distance estimator for rave data . in this work",
    ", we will use the output @xmath36 directly in the following sections .",
    "however , for comparison we also list the results estimated from @xmath39 in table.[table : d ] .",
    "the padova isochrones @xcite are adopted like in @xcite .",
    "the metallicity steps of the isochrones have been carefully chosen by @xcite for avoiding great changes in the observed quantities between adjacent isochrones , and have been extended to low metallicity by @xcite .",
    "since the extinction can be calculated with this bayesian method , an extinction law is a necessary ingredient . at present",
    ", there is no real consensus on the correct extinction law along all the directions of the galaxy , especially toward to the galactic bulge region @xcite .",
    "thus , we decide to use the extinction law of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ccm ) with @xmath40 as shown in @xcite .",
    "the apache point observatory galactic evolution experiment ( apogee ) as one component of sdss iii @xcite , is a near - infrared ( @xmath41-band ; @xmath42m@xmath43 m ) , high - resolution ( r@xmath4422,500 ) spectroscopic survey .",
    "it targets primarily red giant ( rg ) stars across all galactic environments and stellar populations in the milky way @xcite , using the sloan 2.5 m telescope@xcite and an innovative multi - object ir spectrograph @xcite .",
    "the stellar atmospheric parameters and individual chemical abundances are derived from combined apogee spectra with the apogee stellar parameters and chemical abundances pipeline ( aspcap ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which finds the best matching between pre - calculated synthetic spectra to the observed ones via a @xmath45@xmath46 minimization . to validate aspcap outputs , stellar parameters for members in well studied clusters and surface gravities from asteroseismic analyses",
    "are carefully compared @xcite .",
    "calibration correlations are applied to the original aspcap outputs to obtain calibrated stellar parameters for stars @xcite .",
    "the empirical uncertainty of @xmath12 is about 100 k through comparison of aspcap derived temperatures with photometric temperatures , and 0.11 dex for @xmath4 via comparing calibrated aspcap values with asteroseismic surface gravities for stars in the @xmath47 field .",
    "the internal precision of the apogee abundances is typically @xmath48 dex , but the external accuracy of the abundances is challenging to assess , and may only be good to 0.1 - 0.2 dex @xcite .",
    "it is worthy to note that the applied calibration correlations are derived with members in well - studied clusters and stars in the @xmath47 field ; their reliability outside parameter spaces that these calibrated stars cover , such as surface gravities of metal poor stars , are not validated .",
    "the final sdss - iii apogee public data release , dr12 @xcite , includes catalogs with radial velocity , stellar parameters @xmath49)$ ] , and 15 elemental abundances for over 150,000 stars , as well as more than 500,000 spectra from which these quantities are derived .",
    "we retrieved the calibrated stellar parameter data from the apogee parameter catalogs of sdss dr12 using the casjobs interface .",
    "the two micron all sky survey ( 2mass ) near - infrared photometric data for the same stars in @xmath50 m ) , @xmath51 m ) , @xmath52 m ) are also extracted from the point - source catalogue @xcite .",
    "the following procedure is used to select stars with reliable parameters : first , stars should not be set any flags indicating that the observations or analysis is bad .",
    "second , stars without any calibrated parameters ( such as dwarfs ) are excluded .",
    "we use sdss casjobs to extract the data with the following command scripts : ( aspcapflag & dbo.fapogeeaspcapflag(star_bad ) ) = 0 and teff @xmath53 0 . with these criteria , we select 104816 stars from the apogee catalogue . there are 3084 stars that have been observed more than once . for stars with multiple observations ,",
    "only data with the highest signal to noise ratio are used .",
    "this results in 101726 stars in our final sample .",
    "we note that in the following analysis only stars with @xmath54 k and @xmath55 are used to select stars with reliable parameters @xcite , and there are 99165 stars left after applying this selection .",
    "after further strict criteria are applied , such as @xmath56 k and aspcap_chi2 @xmath57 20 ( 92060 stars left ) , no significant change is noticed in the statistical results .",
    "as discussed above , there are several independent methods which can deliver reliable distances for their suitable targets .",
    "for instance , distances to nearby stars from parallax measurements ; to cluster members from the main - sequence fitting , distances of red clump ( rc ) stars by using them as a distance candle ; distances of giants from asteroseismic information , etc .",
    "our bayesian method , described in section 2 , is a more general one . in principle",
    ", it can be used to derive stellar distances of individual stars which have available spectroscopic and photometric quantities . to validate our derived stellar distances , we compare our derived distances with results from other independent methods for common stars : astrometric parallax distances obtained by esa s _ hipparcos _ mission @xcite ; distances to well studied clusters , distances of rc stars , and distances from asteroseismic analyses .",
    "figures 1 to 6 show these comparisons which are also summarized in table 1 . in summary ,",
    "the systematic offsets , in terms of our derived distances minus others , range from @xmath1 to @xmath58 , with dispersions from 15% to 25% ; considering mutual uncertainties in our derived distances and in others , our distances are consistent with those from other methods .",
    "we discuss these comparisons in more detail below .    [ cols=\"<,<,<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     the apogee survey has generated high resolution near - infrared spectra for over @xmath11 stars .",
    "these data provide valuable information on the studies for galactic archaeology . in order to fully exploit these data sets in six - dimension",
    ", we used a bayesian method to derive the distances and extinctions of individual stars by considering photometric and spectroscopic information , as well as prior knowledge on the milky way .",
    "all derived distances and extinctions will be made available as online data .",
    "table [ table : catalogue ] shows the online data format .",
    "the first column is apogee i d , the fourth and fifth columns are derived distance and its associated error respectively , while the eighth and ninth columns are estimated extinction and its error respectively .",
    "the sixth and seventh columns are another distance indicator , parallax and its error output by the bayesian method respectively .    to assess the derived distances , we compared our bayesian distances to those from four independent measurements , the _ hipparcos _ parallaxes , stellar cluster distances , red clump star distances , asteroseismic distances from saga catalogue @xcite and apokasc catalogue @xcite .",
    "these independent measurements cover four orders of magnitude in distance , from @xmath59 kpc ( the _ hipparcos _ parallaxes ) to @xmath60 kpc ( star clusters ) .",
    "the results of these validations are all summarized in table [ table : d ] .",
    "we find that the mean relative difference between our bayesian distances and those derived from other methods are @xmath1 to @xmath2 , and that the dispersion ranges from 15% to 25% .",
    "surprisingly , no systematic offset is seen in the comparison with one set of asteroseismic constrained distances @xcite . considering mutual uncertainties in our derived distances and in other measurements ,",
    "we conclude that , statistically , our derived distances are accurate to a few percent although errors for a few individual stars could be large .",
    "therefore , they are suitable for statistical studies on galactic archaeology .    we have compared our bayesian extinctions with those derived from the rjce method .",
    "it seems that the extinctions from the rjce method depend on spectral type . for stars with @xmath61 k , @xmath62 , and @xmath63 , the rjce method tends to overestimate extinction , however , in most cases this overestimation is less than 0.11 mag . in @xmath64band , which is still within the error budget suggested by @xcite .",
    "the overestimation of the extinction at large distance can also be attributed to this effect , as giants with even lower @xmath4 are usually the dominant population at this region due to a selection effect .",
    "we also notice that there is a systematic difference at heavy extinction @xmath65 mag . , which could be due to the adopted extinction law . comparing with two dimensional extinction map of @xcite",
    ", we note that the map may overestimate extinction in the nearby regions .",
    "we also compared our results with three - dimensional extinction models of @xcite and maps of @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite . compared with our extinction , both the model of @xcite and map of @xcite",
    "show lower extinction values for distant stars toward the anti - galactic central region .",
    "the model of @xcite matches well with our results of nearby region @xmath66kpc@xmath67 toward the bulge field @xmath68 . for this field",
    "the map of @xcite predicts a steep rise in slope for @xmath69 kpc , while the map of @xcite provides a good fit with our result for distant region ( @xmath70 kpc ) .",
    "the accurate distance and extinction derived in the current work provide valuable information for the apogee stars , and are important for exploiting the data set of the apogee survey when studying the formation and evolution of the milky way .",
    "the anonymous referee is greatly thanked for useful comments and suggestions that helped improve the quality of this paper .",

    "<S> using a bayesian technology we derived distances and extinctions for over @xmath0 red giant stars observed by the apache point observatory galactic evolution experiment ( apogee ) survey by taking into account spectroscopic constraints from the apogee stellar parameters and photometric constraints from 2mass , as well as a prior knowledge on the milky way . </S>",
    "<S> derived distances are compared with those from four other independent methods , the _ hipparcos _ parallaxes , star clusters , apogee red clump stars , and asteroseismic distances from apokasc @xcite and saga catalogues @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these comparisons covers four orders of magnitude in the distance scale from 0.02 kpc to 20 kpc . </S>",
    "<S> the results show that our distances agree very well with those from other methods : the mean relative difference between our bayesian distances and those derived from other methods ranges from @xmath1 to @xmath2 , and the dispersion ranges from 15% to 25% . </S>",
    "<S> the extinctions toward all stars are also derived and compared with those from several other independent methods : the rayleigh@xmath3jeans color excess ( rjce ) method , gonzalez s two - dimensional extinction map , as well as three - dimensional extinction maps and models . </S>",
    "<S> the comparisons reveal that , overall , estimated extinctions agree very well , but rjce tends to overestimate extinctions for cool stars and objects with low @xmath4 .    [ firstpage ]    stars : fundamental parameters  stars : distances  dust , extinction </S>"
