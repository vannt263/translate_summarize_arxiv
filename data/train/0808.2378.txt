    "the extensive applications of synchrotron radiation in a wide variety of experiments and in many disciplines ( see @xcite-@xcite and references therein ) , motivate the importance of investigations for various mechanisms of controlling the radiation parameters . in particular , it is of interest to consider the influence of a medium on the spectral and angular characteristics of the radiation .",
    "it is well known that the presence of medium can essentially change the characteristics of the electromagnetic processes and gives rise to new types of phenomena such as cherenkov , transition , and diffraction radiations .",
    "moreover , the operation of a number of devices assigned to production of electromagnetic radiation is based on the interaction of high - energy particles with materials ( see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "the synchrotron radiation from a charged particle circulating in a homogeneous medium was considered in @xcite , where it has been shown that the interference between the synchrotron and cherenkov radiations leads to remarkable effects .",
    "new interesting features arise in the case of inhomogeneous media .",
    "interfaces of media are widely used to control the radiation flow emitted by various systems .",
    "well - known examples of this kind are the cherenkov radiation of a charge moving parallel to a plane interface of two media or flying parallel to the axis of a dielectric cylinder , transition radiation , smith - purcell radiation . in @xcite",
    "the radiation from charged particles flying over a surface acoustic wave generated on a plane interface between two media is studied . in a series of papers initiated in grig95a , grig95b , grigoryan1995 ,",
    "we have investigated the influence of spherical and cylindrical boundaries between two dielectrics on the characteristics of the synchrotron radiation .",
    "in particular , the investigation of radiation from a charge rotating about / inside a dielectric ball showed @xcite that when the cherenkov condition for the ball material and particle speed is satisfied , there appear high narrow peaks in the spectral distribution of the number of quanta emitted to outer space at some specific values of the ratio of ball - to - particle orbit radii . in the vicinity of these peaks",
    "the rotating particle may generate radiation field quanta exceeding in several dozens of times those generated by particle rotating in a continuous , infinite and transparent medium having the same real part of permittivity as the ball material .",
    "similar problems with the cylindrical symmetry have been discussed in grigoryan1995,kot2000 . it is shown that under similar cherenkov condition for permittivity of cylinder and the speed of particle gyrating about / inside the cylinder , high narrow peaks are present in the spectral - angular distribution for the number of radiated quanta . in the vicinity of these peaks",
    "the radiated energy exceeds the corresponding value for homogeneous medium case by several orders of magnitude .    in recent papers @xcite-@xcite ,",
    "we have investigated more general problem of the radiation from a charged particle in a helical trajectory inside a dielectric cylinder . the corresponding problem for a charge moving in vacuum has been widely discussed in the literature ( see , for instance , @xcite and references given therein ) and the influence of a homogeneous dispersive medium is considered in @xcite .",
    "this type of electron motion is used in helical undulators for generating electromagnetic radiation in a narrow spectral interval at frequencies ranging from radio or millimeter waves to x - rays ( see bord99,hofm04,onuk03 ) .",
    "the present paper is devoted to the investigation of the radiation from a charge moving along a helix around a dielectric cylinder immersed in a homogeneous medium .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the next section , by using the formulae for the green function from @xcite , we derive expressions for the vector potential and electromagnetic fields in the region outside the cylinder .",
    "the angular - frequency distribution of the radiation intensity in the surrounding medium is considered in section sec : radiation . in section [ sec : properties ] we discuss the features of the radiation intensity and the results of the numerical evaluations are presented .",
    "section [ sec : conc ] concludes the main results of the paper .",
    "consider a point charge @xmath0 moving along the helical trajectory of radius @xmath1 outside a dielectric cylinder with radius @xmath2 and with permittivity @xmath3 .",
    "we will assume that this system is immersed in a homogeneous medium with dielectric permittivity @xmath4 ( magnetic permeability will be taken to be unit ) .",
    "this type of motion can be produced by a uniform constant magnetic field directed along the axis of a cylinder , by a circularly polarized plane wave , or by a spatially periodic transverse magnetic field of constant absolute value and a direction that rotates as a function of the longitudinal coordinate . in helical undulators",

    "<S> in this paper we investigate the radiation emitted by a charged particle moving along a helical orbit around a dielectric cylinder immersed into a homogeneous medium . </S>",
    "<S> formulae are derived for the electromagnetic potentials , electric and magnetic fields , and for the spectral - angular distribution of the radiation in the exterior medium . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that under the cherenkov condition for dielectric permittivity of the cylinder and the velocity of the particle image on the cylinder surface , strong narrow peaks appear in the angular distribution for the number of quanta radiated on a given harmonic . at these peaks the radiated energy exceeds the corresponding quantity for a homogeneous medium by several dozens of times . </S>",
    "<S> simple analytic estimates are given for the heights and widths of these peaks . </S>",
    "<S> the results of numerical calculations for the angular distribution of the radiated quanta are presented and they are compared with the corresponding quantities for the radiation from a charge moving along a helical trajectory inside a dielectric cylinder .    </S>",
