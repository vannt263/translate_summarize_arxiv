    "in the past decade considerable progress has been made in understanding our galaxy s globular cluster ( gc ) system .",
    "this is in large part due to dedicated programs that aim to characterize homogeneously properties of clusters including chemical abundance patterns , ages , horizontal branch ( hb ) morphology , structural parameters and orbits .",
    "studies have combined the recently aquired various observational databases to search for correlations that can point to a realistic formation picture of the globular - cluster system ( see e.g. , carreta 2006 , recio - blanco et al .",
    "2006 , pritzl et al .",
    "2005 , mackey & gilmore 2004 ) .",
    "briefly , the present picture points to an accreted origin for the outer halo clusters ( @xmath2 kpc ) , while a combination of dissipational collapse and some accretion can best explain the current properties of inner gcs . however , details of these pictures are by no means understood as there appear to be a series of `` non - canonical '' observations .",
    "for instance , there are metal - poor ( [ fe / h ] @xmath3 ) clusters with disk - like kinematics ( dinescu et al .",
    "1999b - paper iii and references therein , dinescu et al .",
    "2003 - paper iv ) , there are metal - rich clusters ( [ fe / h ] @xmath4 ) with unusually blue , extended hbs that appear to reside within the bulge , ( e.g. , rich et al .",
    "1997 ) , and ( for the data currently available ) the orbits of the most energetic clusters appear to be on average more eccentric than those of present - day dwarf spheroidal satellites ( dinescu et al . 2001 ) .",
    "also , these clusters are not dynamically associated with any of the current streams found in the sdss ( belokurov et al .",
    "2006 , grillmair & dionatos 2006 , see also our discussion in this study ) .",
    "there is only one exception to this latter point : cluster pal 12 and its association with the sagittarius dwarf galaxy ( sgr ; dinescu et al .",
    "2000 , martinez - delgado et al .",
    "2002 , cohen 2004 ) . therefore questions such as how much accretion took place in the past to build up the inner halo , can it really be traced and separated from the features of a dissipational collapse , and how different was it from the ongoing / recent accretion seen in surveys such as sdss remain to be explored .    with these questions in mind ,",
    "we continue our program to determine absolute proper motions of gcs especially in the inner halo , and thus contribute new orbit information to the overall picture of the formation of the milky way gc system .",
    "previous results from our program ( dinescu et al 1997 - paper i , dinescu et al 1999a - paper ii , paper iii and paper iv ) were based on photographic plates alone .",
    "the current results are based on ccd data for the second epoch .",
    "a ccd system with two cameras was mounted in 2003 on the double astrograph at el leoncito , argentina , where our observation are based .",
    "here we show the first astrometric results that make use of the new ccd system .    in section 2 , we describe the observations and reductions including those of the ccd system recently mounted on the astrograph . in section 3",
    "we describe the proper - motion derivations .",
    "sections 4 presents the velocity and orbit results , and finally , a discussion of the results is given in section 5 .",
    "this work is part of the continuation of the southern proper motion program ( spm , platais et al . 1998 ,",
    "girard et al . 1998 , 2004 ) , a survey that aims to produce absolute proper motions and @xmath5 photometry for @xmath6 million stars in the southern sky , down to @xmath7 . a recent release of this program based on photographic material alone , includes 10 million objects ( girard et al . 2004 ) . the photographic plate material used in this work",
    "is described in table 1 .",
    "the remaining area for the @xmath8 epoch observations is being mapped with a two - camera ccd system installed on the 51-cm double astrograph at cesco observatory , el leoncito , argentina .",
    "the earliest observations included in the spm program started in june 2003 .",
    "this system s properties and performances are briefly described below , while a more detailed description will be given in a future spm general - program update .",
    "the program clusters are a low - latitude sample that supplements our previous work for 15 high - latitude clusters ( papers i and ii ) .",
    "thus , in the current work , the proper motions are tied to an inertial reference system via @xmath0 stars rather than galaxies .",
    "the first results for this low - latitude sample were presented for four bulge clusters ( l @xmath9 ) in paper iv .",
    "the current sample is located in the fourth galactic quadrant ( table 2 ) .",
    "other limitations on the sample are imposed by the spm first - epoch plate material , i.e. , clusters are south of @xmath10 and within @xmath11 kpc from the sun .",
    "the novelty of the current work lies in the use of @xmath8 epoch ccd data that have improved the precision of our proper - motion results by 1 ) expanding the baseline from 20 - 25 years to 30 - 38 years , and 2 ) improving the positional precision of the @xmath8 epoch observations .",
    "the spm plates were taken with the double astrograph at cesco observatory in blue ( 103a - o ) and visual ( 102a - g + og515 filter ) passbands ( see table 1 ) .",
    "the plate scale is 55.1@xmath12 mm@xmath1 , and each field covers @xmath13 .",
    "spm plates contain a 2-hr exposure that reaches to @xmath14 and an offset 2-min exposure . during both exposures , an objective grating",
    "is used , which produces a series of diffraction images on either side of the central , zero - order images ; depending on grating orientation , the diffraction images are aligned with the e - w direction in most cases , and , in a few cases , along the n - s direction ( girard et al . 1998 ) .",
    "the multiple sets of images of bright stars allow us to detect and model magnitude - dependent systematics that affect both positions and proper motions .",
    "these systematics are 1 ) present in practically all photographic material , 2 ) mainly due to the nonlinear response of the photographic emulsion , and 3 ) require special methods to detect internally ( girard et al .",
    "1998 and references therein ) .    for the spm plate material ,",
    "the size of these systematics is 10 to 15 mas over 6 magnitudes ; their modeling and removal using diffraction images has been thoroughly described in girard et al .",
    "this key feature of the spm program to internally correct for magnitude equation ensures that bright stars , incluing the astrometric calibrators ( @xmath0 stars , @xmath15 ) , and faint stars ( e.g. , cluster stars , @xmath16 ) are on a system largely free of systematics . a comparison between the absolute proper motion of ngc 6121 ( m4 )",

    "the photographic plates were scanned with the yale pds microdensitometer , in object - by - object mode , with a pixel size of 12.7 microns .",
    "on each spm field , we measure a pre - selected set of stars ( see also paper iv ) .",
    "this set consists of all @xmath0 and tycho2 stars ( esa 1997 ) , @xmath31 guide star catalog 1.1 ( gsc , lasker et al .",
    "1990 ) stars , @xmath32 faint field stars selected from the usno - a2.0 catalog ( monet et al .",
    "1998 ) in the magnitude range 15 to 17 , and cluster stars . for bright stars ( @xmath33 ) we measure both exposures and diffraction images .",
    "@xmath0 stars provide the correction to absolute proper motion , while tycho2 and gsc stars assure an appropriate magnitude range of various diffraction orders with which to model magnitude - dependent systematics .",
    "the faint stars serve as reference stars , i.e. , are used to map one plate into another , as well as ccd positions into the photographic ones .",
    "spatially , they are distributed around each @xmath0 star , and in a ring around the cluster .",
    "this special configuration was chosen to minimize modeling uncertainties when plate positions are transformed into one another ( see paper i ) .",
    "for each spm field we measure @xmath6 @xmath0 stars ; and there are twenty faint stars surrounding each @xmath0 star , and @xmath34 faint stars within the ring surrounding the cluster .",
    "the list of cluster stars to be measured on the plate is determined from a ccd frame ( see below ) centered on the cluster .",
    "the input positions for these stars are determined from the ccd frame and the software package sextractor ( bertin & arnouts 1996 ) .",
    "cluster stars are selected to cover a region of a few times the half - light radius as taken from harris ( 1996 , 2003 update , hereafter h96 ) .",
    "the radius of this region varies between @xmath35 and @xmath36 for the various clusters , with the central @xmath37 being unusable because of crowding .     and our proper motions for the five spm fields . the average value of the differences , i.e. , the correction to absolute proper motion , has already been applied as on offset such that the proper motion range is the same for all fields .",
    "]      the ccd camera system consists of two main cameras , one each in the blue and visual focal planes of the double astrograph .",
    "the pixelvision visual ccd camera has a 4k @xmath38 4k unthinned , front - illuminated loral chip of total area @xmath39 .",
    "the pixel size of @xmath40 is well matched to our site , where the seeing is typically between @xmath41 and @xmath42 , corresponding to 3 - 4 pixels per fwhm . with a 2-minute exposure in reasonable seeing conditions , a magnitude limit of @xmath43 is reached .",
    "the original blue camera was an apogee ap-8 ccd with a 1k x 1k site back - illuminated chip , covering @xmath44 at @xmath45/pixel . in may 2005 , this camera was replaced by an apogee alta e42 2k @xmath38 2k camera with a field of view of @xmath46 at @xmath47/pixel .",
    "the observations are taken with the diffraction grating oriented at @xmath48 .",
    "thus the entire ccd dynamical range covered is 10 magnitudes , i.e. , 6 inhrently from the ccd plus 4 more provided by the grating .    for the spm program ,",
    "the pixelvision camera is the primary astrometry instrument , and @xmath49-band photometer , while the apogee cameras provide @xmath50 photometry and possibly astrometry over a fraction of the survey . for the cluster work presented here ,",
    "we make use only of the pixelvision astrometric data .",
    "the planned two - fold overlap coverage with ccd frames requires some 90 frames over an isolated @xmath13 spm field . in addition",
    ", six or more frames are taken centered on each program cluster : each set of three frames has exposures of 30 , 60 and 120 sec .",
    "the ccd pre - processing pipeline includes calibrations using biases and flats for the pixelvision frames .",
    "detections and aperture photometry are derived with sextractor software .",
    "the positions from sextractor , which are intensity - weighted centroids , are then used as initial positions in our refined centering routine that fits a 2d elliptical gaussian to the image profile .",
    "these later positions have a centering precision of @xmath51 mas per single image for well - measured objects ( @xmath52 to 15 ) .    before attempting to derive proper motions based on the pixelvision ccd positions ,",
    "two separate pre - corrections are performed .",
    "first , a correction for the optical field angle distortion ( ofad ) of the field of view is determined and applied .",
    "second , positions from the grating - order images must be placed on a common system with those of the deeper , central - order images .",
    "this latter step is necessary to provide a reliable means of linking the faint cluster members with the bright @xmath0 stars that will be used to determine the correction to absolute proper motions .",
    "the ofad of the pixelvision frames , to the extent that it is constant and stable , can be determined by averaging the residuals between our ccd positions and those of an external catalog , over many frames .",
    "general quadratic polynomial transformations between ucac2 ( zacharias et al .",
    "2000 ) coordinates and the ( central - order ) positions from the pixelvision frames provides residuals adequate for this task . as the telescope pointings used to create the ucac2 catalog are distributed randomly across the pixelvision field of view , any resulting systematic patterns revealed can be attributed to the combined pixelvision / astrograph effective ofad .",
    "we have averaged a minimum of @xmath53 residuals from at least @xmath54 frames reduced into the ucac2 using a quadratic transformation , for each spm field in this study . for each field ,",
    "an empirical correction mask is derived , on a @xmath55 grid across the 4k @xmath38 4k pixel field .",
    "this mask is applied to the positions from each pixelvision frame , using bilinear interpolation within the mask grid .",
    "typical amplitudes of the position corrections are 10 to 15 mas .",
    "the second crucial step in the processing of pixelvision positions is the unification of the various diffraction - order coordinate systems . given perfect optics and detector , and ignoring the possible effects of differential color refraction , the average position of the two first - order image centers should coincide exactly with the position of the central - order image . likewise , the average of the positions of the two second - order images should also be coincident with the central order image .",
    "an offset can indicate the presence of magnitude equation - the magnitude dependent bias in stellar image positions often seen in photographic material but also expected to a lesser degree in ccd data because of imperfect charge transfer efficiency ( cte ) . with the first - order images being effectively four magnitudes fainter than the corresponding central - order image",
    ", the presence of any magnitude - dependent bias would directly lead to a non - zero offset .",
    "in fact , these positional offsets are used to determine and then correct the magnitude equation present in the spm photographic plates , ( see girard et al .",
    "1998 ) .",
    "in the case of the pixelvision data , our hope was to use the offsets between central and diffraction - grating images to measure any cte - induced magnitude equation and correct for it .",
    "indeed , substantial offsets on the order of 0.05 pixels ( @xmath56 ) are seen , however these do not appear to be cte - related , i.e. , caused by inherent magnitude equation .",
    "the offsets between the average of the first - order images relative to the central image , @xmath57 , vary from 0.0 to 0.1 pixels .",
    "these offsets are well - correlated with the coresponding offsets of the average of the second - order image pair relative to that of the central image , @xmath58 , within any given frame . empirically , we find @xmath59 .",
    "this is most certainly _ not _ the behavior to be expected if the offsets were due to magnitude equation .",
    "the second - order images are only marginally fainter than the first - order images , while both are substantially fainter than the central order .",
    "the magnitude differences between grating order and central order are 4.00 and 4.66 for the first and second orders , respectively .",
    "obviously , the observed positional offsets , @xmath57 and @xmath58 , are _ not _ proportional to the magnitude offsets .",
    "a search for possible dependencies between the size of a particular frame s offsets and hour angle , grating orientation angle , and seeing have all failed to reveal any underlying cause of the observed offsets .",
    "noting that the ratio of the first and second - order offsets , 2.0 , matches the ratio of the actual separation of these diffraction images on the frame , we have decided to interpret the offsets as geometric in nature .",
    "that is , the bias in position is postulated to be proportional to separation from the central order image .",
    "thus , we have adopted a scheme for transformation from grating - order coordinate system to central - order system that is a uniform @xmath60 , @xmath61 to be applied to the positions of all first - order image pairs , and @xmath62 , @xmath63 that is applied to the second - order positions .",
    "the values of @xmath60 , @xmath61 , @xmath62 , and @xmath63 are calculated separately for each pixelvision frame , using probability plots ( hamaker 1978 ) of the inner @xmath64 of all measureable grating - pair / central - image triads that also meet conservative photometric criteria to ensure the exclusion of saturated central - order images .",
    "further details of our analysis that led to the development of both the positional correction mask and the grating - order offsets that are applied to the pixelvision positions will accompany the publication of the next spm proper - motion catalog expected later this year .",
    "for the present study , comparisons of the final proper motions determined using separately the first and second - order images alone will serve as a check on the latter , and less certain , of these two corrections .",
    "all ccd observations were taken between 2003 and 2005 , thus ensuring a baseline of 30 to 38 years ( see table 2 ) .",
    "after all precorrections are applied to the photographic plate positions ( i.e. , refraction , magnitude systematic - correction , etc . , see girard et al .",
    "1998 ) and to the ccd positions ( see above ) , we proceed to calculate proper motions using the central - plate overlap method ( e.g. , girard et al .",
    "all measurements are transformed into the system of one photographic plate that is used as a master plate .",
    "we choose a first - epoch visual plate to serve as the master .",
    "the remaining @xmath65-epoch plates are transformed into the master plate using a polynomial of up to @xmath66 order .",
    "the reference stars used for these transformations have a magnitude range between @xmath67 and 18 ; however , the input list is such that stars with @xmath68 dominate the reference frame . therefore , it is the central - order image that is used in these transformations . between @xmath69 and 6800",
    "stars are used in these plate transformations , and the derived positional precision per single measurement for these stars is between 70 and 85 mas . the central - order transformation from one plate into another , is then applied to the remaining orders as well .",
    "the ccd positions are also mapped into the system of the photographic master plate , individually for each ccd frame . for these transformations , only @xmath8-order polynomials",
    "are necessary .",
    "typically , for each ccd frame , there are @xmath6 stars that model this transformation ( see the selection of the input list in section 2.1 ) , and , as with the plates , only the central - order image is used . for the @xmath65 and @xmath8-order images ,",
    "we apply the transformation defined by the central order . for frames that include a cluster , there are between @xmath70 and 1800 faint reference stars that map this transformation ; clusters stars ( i.e. , those selected within a few half - light radii of the cluster ) are @xmath71 used in this transformation .",
    "the scatter in this transformation s residuals is due to both measurement errors and cosmic proper - motion dispersion .",
    "proper motions are then determined by treating each image order as an independent set of positions for both photographic plates and ccd frames .",
    "we have thus the possibility to test determinations based on various image orders , and plates",
    ". a linear least - squares fit of positions as a function of time gives the proper motion for each object .",
    "measurements that differ by more than @xmath72 from the best - fit line are considered outliers , and excluded ; the formal proper - motion uncertainty is given by the scatter about the best - fit line .",
    "these proper motions are thus relative to a reference frame that is dominated by 16th - magnitude stars . by treating individually each ccd frame",
    ", we make the implicit assumption that the mean motion of the reference system does not vary over a 6@xmath38 6-degree field .",
    "however , this is not necessarily true ; in fact we have found linear spatial gradients across the spm fields that must be considered when the final cluster proper motion is determined ( see below ) .      the correction from a relative reference frame defined by 16th - magnitude stars to an inertial reference frame",
    "is determined from straight differences between the @xmath0 proper motions and our relative proper motions . in figure 1",
    "we show these differences for all five spm fields .",
    "the left panels show the vector - point diagram ( vpd ) while the middle and right hand panels show the differences in each coordinate as a function of magnitude .",
    "units of proper motion are mas yr@xmath1 throughout the paper , and @xmath73 .",
    "the offset defined by these differences is the correction to absolute proper motion . in fig .",
    "1 we have applied these offsets so that a similar proper - motion range is displayed for all fields .",
    "the offsets are determined using probability plots ( hamaker 1978 ) trimmed at @xmath74 at each edge .",
    "other estimators such as simple average and median have also been tested ; they all give consistent results within the estimated uncertainty .",
    "we obtain a scatter of between 2 and 3 mas yr@xmath1 , and consequently , formal uncertainties in the absolute proper - motion correction of between 0.2 and 0.3 mas yr@xmath1 .",
    "the proper motions shown are constructed from all image orders on the photographic plates and only the @xmath65 and @xmath8 order on the ccd frames .",
    "central - order images for @xmath0 stars on the ccd frames are saturated and unusable . for each spm field , we have also determined the correction by using separately only blue or yellow plates , or only ccd @xmath65-order or @xmath8-order images , to check for possible systematics .",
    "the results indicate that differences between different determinations are within the estimated uncertainties .",
    "the sole variation found was the variation of the proper - motion differences across the field .",
    "the size of the gradients is @xmath75 mas yr@xmath1 mm@xmath1 which will amount to a significant deviation , when compared to formal uncertainties , for clusters that lie far from the center of the spatial distribution of the @xmath0 stars .",
    "we have therefore applied adjustments to the absolute proper - motion correction that account for these gradients , for each cluster .",
    "we have also verified that these spatial gradients are of the magnitude expected for the change in the mean motion of the reference system across the field .",
    "we have used the besanon galactic model ( robin et al .",
    "2003 , 2004 ) to predict the mean proper - motion gradient across spm field 068 , and confirm the variation seen in our measures .",
    "the mean motion of the cluster with respect to field stars is determined from the stars measured in the cluster region and trimmed in the color - magnitude diagram ( cmd ) for clusters ngc 2808 , ngc 4833 , ngc 5927 and ngc 5986 . for the remaining clusters , ngc 3201 and ngc 4372 ,",
    "we have applied a two - component gaussian fitting procedure for the proper motion distributions , as the field contribution is considerable , even after trimmed via the cmd . in the cases of ngc 2808 , 5927 and 5986 , we have used 2mass ( cutri et al .",
    "2003 ) j and k photometry to select cluster stars in the cmd . for ngc 4833 ,",
    "we have used b and v photometry from the study of melbourne et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , that covers the entire area of our measured cluster stars ( a circle with @xmath76 radius ) . in figures 2 and 3",
    "we show the cmds and the proper - motion distributions for each cluster .",
    "the open symbols represent all stars measured in the cluster area , while the black symbols those selected from the cmd to be likely cluster members .",
    "the left panels show the cmds , the middle panels show the vpds of all the stars in the cluster area .",
    "the right panels show the vpds of the stars selected from the corresponding cmd .",
    "the histograms show the marginal distributions of the proper motions .",
    "the cross shows the adopted mean relative proper motion of the cluster . for clusters",
    "ngc 2808 , 4833 , 5927 and 5986 , we have determined this mean with probability plots trimmed at @xmath74 of cmd - selected stars within a radius of 20 mas yr@xmath1 from the approximate centroid of the cluster proper - motion distribution .",
    "thus stars outside this proper - motion range are considered outliers .",
    "the remaining field contribution after the cmd selection , is assumed to be small and therefore eliminated by the @xmath74 cut in the probability - plot determination .",
    "this was not the case however for ngc 4372 , and ngc 3201 .",
    "since the area where cluster stars were measured for these two clusters is larger than that of the other four clusters , as they are more extended , it is likely that more field contamination contributes to the cluster sample , even when a cmd selection is applied .",
    "that this is the case for ngc 4372 , can be seen in the @xmath77 marginal distribution ( fig .",
    "2 - second right - hand panel ) , which is visibly skewed .",
    "therefore we chose to fit the proper - motion distribution of all of the stars in the cluster area ( i.e. , no selection using the cmd ) with a model consisting of the sum of two gaussians , one representing ngc 4372 , the other the field .",
    "this is done separately for each coordinate , and the `` observed '' proper - motion distribution is constructed from the data smoothed with the individual proper - motion errors .",
    "details of this procedure can be found for instance in girard et al .",

    "the continuous line shows the two - component gaussian fit to the data .",
    "the cross in the top - right panel is the mean relative proper motion of the cluster as determined from the two - component gaussian fit to the data in the top - left panel . ]",
    "a similar procedure was applied to the field of ngc 3201 .",
    "this is illustrated in figure 4 .",
    "the top left panel of fig .",
    "4 shows the proper - motion distribution of all stars measured in the cluster area .",
    "the dotted lines show the rotated system in which the gaussian fit is made , aligning the @xmath78 axis with the elongated shape of the field proper - motion distribution . in the top , right panel",
    "we show the radial - velocity selected sample of cluster stars .",
    "the radial velocities are from cte et al .",
    "( 1995 ) ; with a mean of 494 km s@xmath1 , they are thus very distinct from the field radial - velocity distribution .",
    "the cross marks the mean proper motion as determined from the gaussian fit .",
    "this fit is shown in the bottom panels of fig .",
    "the fit is applied to the entire sample of stars measured in the cluster area ; the open symbols show the observed proper - motion distribution , and the black line shows the fit .",
    "we have also calculated the mean motion of the cluster by using only the radial velocity - selected stars and the probability plot estimator with no trimming . only stars laying outside a 20 mas yr@xmath1 radius from the proper - motion centroid are excluded as measurement outliers . from this determination",
    ", we obtain @xmath79 mas yr@xmath1 .",
    "the gaussian fit gives @xmath80 mas yr@xmath1 .",
    "since the results agree very well we are convinced that the field contamination is well modeled and appropriately accounted for in the gaussian fit .",
    "therefore we adopt this value .",
    "the number of cluster stars that enter into each determination varies between 260 and 400 stars . as in the case of correction to absolute proper motions ,",
    "we have searched for possible systematics by performing separate solutions for the blue and visual plates . in the case of ngc 4833 ,",
    "since the sample allowed it , we have also looked at the mean proper motion as determined from the blue , horizontal branch stars , and the red giant stars . we have found that results agreed within estimated uncertainties in all cases except for ngc 4372 .",
    "here , the blue plate solution proved different from that of the visual plate , and with the blue - plate solution showing a large scatter in the cluster star proper motions .",
    "since ngc 4372 lies in the corner of the spm field , it is likely that this area of the first - epoch blue plate is damaged .",

    "our data however rule out this association given the very eccentric orbit of ngc 2808 ( table 5 ) , and the thick - disk - like orbit of the monoceros structure ( pearrubia et al .",
    "in fact , none of the metal poor clusters in our sample can be associated with the monoceros / canis major structures , on account of their highly eccentric or retrograde orbits .",

    "@xmath107 cen is now widely believed to be the nucleus of a satellite galaxy captured and destroyed by the gravitational field of the milky way , mainly on account of its chemical abundance patterns that indicate strong self - enrichment and multiple episodes of star formation ( e.g. , smith 2004 ) .",
    "more recently , a new picture has emerged for all globular clusters with extended blue hbs . since the he enhancement appears to explain well the peculiar hb morphology",
    "( see also the case of ngc 6441 , calois & dantona 2007 ) , and since most theoretical studies point to self - enrichment from a previous generation of massive stars in their agb phase as the source of the high he abundance ( e.g. , karakas et al .",
    "2006 and reference therein ) , it has been suggested that all clusters with extended hbs may have been cores of disrupted dwarf galaxies ( lee et al .",
    "lee et al .",
    "( 2007 ) also show that these extended hb clusters are the most massive in our galaxy .",
    "recent models of he enrichment from a previous generation of massive stars within a globular cluster - size system are however unable to reproduce the very high he abundance ( @xmath108 ) inferred in ngc 2808 and @xmath107 cen ( e.g. , karakas et al .",
    "2006 , bekki & norris 2006 ) .",
    "this too has prompted the hypothesis that such systems are born early on at the bottom of the potential well of a more massive system ( @xmath109 , bekki & norris 2006 , bekki 2006 ) than what they currently retain ; and subsequently the halos of these systems are disrupted and destroyed by the galactic tidal field .",
    "none of the current models are however able to explain both the amount of he enrichment and the particular abundance patterns seen in these globular clusters ( the na - o anticorrelation and the c+n+o constancy for instance , karakas et al .",
    "2006 , bekki et al .",
    "2007 , romano et al . 2007 ) .",
    "regardless of the difficulties of models to reproduce in detail these abundance patterns , the suggestion that these clusters may have originated in rather massive satellite systems has prompted a closer look at the properties of their orbits .",
    "thus , according to the newly emerged picture , the orbits of the progenitors of these extended hb clusters should have been particularly prone to orbital decay , because they were massive and underwent dynamical friction , and disruption , as they reached the denser , inner regions of our galaxy .",
    "models of the disruption of the host system of @xmath107 cen by tsuchiya et al .",
    "( 2003 , 2004 ) that aim to reproduce its present orbit and mass indicate that the original system started with an orbital eccentricity of 0.90 and an apocenter radius of 58 kpc , while the current values are @xmath110 and @xmath111 kpc ( paper iii , allen et al .",
    "2006 ) . along this line of reasoning , ngc 2808 may be analogous .",
    "it has a relatively high orbital eccentricity ( 0.65 ) , and does not move farther than @xmath112 kpc from the galactic center ( table 5 ) . in our sample , besides ngc 2808 , cluster ngc 5986 may also belong to this category of systems with extended hbs ( alves et al .",
    "2001 , rosenberg et al . 2000 ) .",
    "it is also a rather massive cluster ( table 2 ) .",
    "its orbit is highly eccentric , practically plunging , and confined to within the inner 5 kpc of the galactic center .",
    "a rather unexpected result from the orbits derived for the metal poor clusters is that there are two pairs of clusters that have very similar orbital parameters .",
    "the first pair consists of ngc 5986 and ngc 4833 ( tables 4 and 5 ) , and the second pairing is ngc 2808 and ngc 4372 . clearly , orbit angular momenta l@xmath113 , pericentric radii",
    ", eccentricities and orbit inclinations agree very well ( within @xmath114 ) for the pair ngc 5986 - ngc 4833 , and moderately well for the pair ngc 2808 - ngc 4372 .",
    "the most significant difference is the total orbital energy difference between the two clusters in either pair , which implicitly affects the apocenter radii , maximum distance from the galactic plane and , to some extent the eccentricity .",
    "the orbital energy difference between the two clusters of either pair is @xmath115 km@xmath116 s@xmath117 . for reference ,",
    "we take the example of sgr and cluster pal 12 which is now believed to have been torn from sgr .",
    "an initial argument supporting this picture was the analysis of their orbits ( dinescu et al .",
    "however , later on , other evidence strengthened this view : the chemical abundance pattern of pal 12 matches that of stars in sgr ( sbordone et al .",
    "2006 , cohen 2004 ) , and the cluster is embedded in sgr tidal debris ( martnez - delgado et al .",
    "2002 ) .    assuming that indeed pal 12 was torn from sgr , we have calculated orbits for these two systems using the proper motion from dinescu et al .",
    "( 2000 ) for pal 12 , and the proper motion of sgr given by dinescu et al .",
    "( 2005 ) , both in the jsh95 potential .",
    "we obtain a difference between the orbital energy of pal 12 and sgr of @xmath118 km@xmath116 s@xmath117 .",
    "this simple - minded exercise leads to the suggestion that the clusters in each pair may be dynamically associated , and therefore had a common origin in satellites of the size of sgr .",
    "from the theoretical point of view , disruption events of satellite galaxies described by helmi & de zeeuw ( 2000 ) in the e@xmath119-l@xmath113 and l - l@xmath113 planes ( their fig . 4 for instance ) show ranges in e@xmath119 and l compatible with the ranges of our two pairs of clusters . for a given satellite ,",
    "it is l@xmath113 that has the narrowest range in the helmi & de zeeuw simulations , and indeed these values agree within errors for our two pairs of clusters . if indeed the clusters in each pair are dynamically associated , this reinforces the hypothesis that each pair was born in a massive satellite system subsequently destroyed .",
    "alternatively , another simple - minded exercise is to estimate the chance of obtaining two apparent `` pairs '' of dynamically associated clusters , drawn from a system which has velocities distributed randomly according to the velocity ellipsoid of the halo .",
    "we have therefore assigned velocities drawn randomly from a velocity ellipsoid with dispersions @xmath120 km s@xmath1 and averages equal to zero in each velocity component .",
    "the velocity dispersions are taken from paper iii , for the metal - poor halo sample ( [ fe / h ] @xmath121 ) .",
    "we have thus generated a set of one hundred such random representations for the five metal - poor clusters in our sample .",
    "the integrals of motion were calculated for each generated representation , and then we have searched for `` pairs '' of clusters within a given volume in the integrals - of - motion space . the search box in this space is based on the observed separations and uncertainties of our actual measures for the two proposed cluster pairs in our sample .",
    "for example , the l@xmath113 side of the box is calculated from the quadrature sum of the difference between l@xmath113 for one of our tentative cluster pairs and the uncertainty in this difference as given by the values in parantheses in table 4 .",
    "thus , for the pair ngc 2808-ngc 4372 the search box is ( @xmath122l@xmath113 , @xmath122e , @xmath122l ) = @xmath123 , and for ngc 5986-ngc 4833 is ( @xmath122l@xmath113 , @xmath122e , @xmath122l ) = @xmath124 ( units are those in table 4 ) . for the ngc 2808-ngc 4372 pair",
    "we obtain a @xmath125 chance of finding an apparent dynamically associated pair from a system that has velocities randomly distributed according to the known velocity ellipsoid of the halo , while for the ngc 5986-ngc 4833 pair , we obtain a @xmath126 chance . taken together , the chance that both of these cluster pairings are mere coincidence is @xmath127 .    to this extent",
    ", we have shown that in a sample of five metal - poor clusters there appears to be clumping in the integrals - of - motion space that is not likely due to chance occurence .",
    "this clumpiness should be further tested and quantified by analyzing the entire sample of globular clusters with 3d velocities , and by comparing the data with more realistic models of the formation of the globular - cluster system such as those in prieto & gnedin ( 2007 ) for instance .",
    "we hope to be able to address this in a future paper .",

    "<S> we have measured the absolute proper motions of globular clusters ngc 2808 , 3201 , 4372 , 4833 , 5927 and 5986 . </S>",
    "<S> the proper motions are on the @xmath0 system , and they are the first determinations ever made for these low galactic latitude clusters . </S>",
    "<S> the proper motion uncertainties range from 0.3 to 0.5 mas yr@xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> the inferred orbits indicate that 1 ) the single metal rich cluster in our sample , ngc 5927 , dynamically belongs to the thick disk , 2 ) the remaining metal poor clusters have rather low - energy orbits of high eccentricity ; among these , there appear to be two `` pairs '' of dynamically associated clusters , 3 ) the most energetic cluster in our sample , ngc 3201 is on a highly retrograde orbit  which had already been surmised from radial velocity alone  with an apocentric distance of 22 kpc , and 4 ) none of the metal poor clusters appear to be associated with the recently detected sdss streams , or with the monoceros structure .    </S>",
    "<S> these are the first results of the southern proper - motion program ( spm ) where the second - epoch observations are taken with the recent ccd camera system installed on the double astrograph at el leoncito , argentina . </S>"
