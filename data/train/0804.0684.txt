    "density functional theory ( dft )  @xcite is a standard theoretical tool for the description of electronic systems , which takes into account exchange and correlation effects .",
    "practically , dft methods require approximations to the exchange and correlation potentials .",
    "the most widely used is the local density approximation ( lda ) @xcite .",
    "this scheme however contains a spurious self - interaction . as a consequence , the coulomb asymptotics , the ionization potential , and the potential energy surface of a system turn out to be wrong .",
    "these incorrect behaviors can lead to misleading results especially in time - dependent processes , as e.g. dynamics of ionization .",
    "a corrected description includes a self - interaction correction ( sic ) @xcite .",
    "sic methods were tried and tested in various domains of physics , such as atomic , molecular , cluster and solid state physics , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "the original sic scheme leads to an orbital dependent ( and thus non hermitian ) mean - field which , as a consequence , leads to violation of orthonormality .",
    "that problem has been attacked with various strategies .",
    "when maintaining orbital - dependent potentials , the most consistent technique is to deal with a matrix of lagrangian multipliers taking care explicitely for orthonormality , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "a formally elegant alternative is to enforce a common mean - field potential by the method of optimized effective potentials ( oep ) @xcite which , however , can become technically very involved .",
    "thus one often steps down to the krieger - li - iafrate ( kli ) approximation for oep @xcite .",
    "kli - sic is widely accepted as a useful and inexpensive approach to sic .",
    "there are , however , some drawbacks showing up in critical applications .",
    "indeed kli is underestimating the often necessary localization of wavefunctions @xcite which , e.g. , leads to problems with the polarizibility in chain molecules @xcite or with nmr shieldings @xcite .",
    "time dependent kli also runs in serious problems with energy conservation and zero - force theorem @xcite .",
    "thus there remains a need for a direct handling of sic to deal with such critical applications .",
    "the non - hermicitiy of the orbital - dependent mean - field and proper handling of orthonormality of the occupied single - particle states are then crucial topics to be considered , particularly in time - dependent applications .",
    "the formally sound , but practically cumbersome , way to deal with that is to use a full matrix of lagrange multipliers . it is widely used practice to abbreviate that by using standard diagonalization schemes together with explicit orthonormalization .",
    "it is the aim of the present paper to compare various solution strategies and to investigate in detail the interplay of orthonormality and energy diagonality ( or variance , respectively ) .",
    "this will be done in a simplemost model involving two active states .",
    "the paper is organized as follows  : section [ sec : mod ] introduces the model , section [ sec : mf ] summarizes briefly the various approaches , and section [ sec : compar ] is devoted to discussion of results .",
    "we consider four electrons , two spin - up and two spin - down , in one spatial dimension with the hamiltonian    [ eq : fullham ] @xmath0    the electron - electron interaction @xmath1 is taken schematically as zero range .",
    "the external ionic potential is regularized at short distance .",
    "its parameters are chosen as @xmath2 @xmath3 , @xmath4 @xmath3 , total charge @xmath5 and charge in the right well @xmath6 .",
    "the potential has two centers around @xmath7 and the charge @xmath8 creates a spatial asymmetry , see fig .  [",
    "fig : model ] .",
    "the ratio @xmath9 sets the natural energy unit .",
    "the various methods used here can all be formulated in terms of the energy - density functional .",
    "the full hf case serves as a benchmark .",
    "the hf energy as derived from the full hamiltonian @xmath23 ( [ eq : h ] ) reads @xmath24 where the factor 2 in @xmath25 stands for spin degeneracy and @xmath26 . here",
    "the @xmath27 denote the eigenfunctions of the perturbed @xmath23 . note that the zero - range interaction @xmath1 produces a purely density - dependent energy already at the level of exact exchange .",
    "when only the hartree contribution is taken into account , the energy is now given by @xmath28 this hartree energy is deduced from the direct term of the interaction only .",
    "this raises the self - interaction problem . augmenting that hartree energy by a self - interaction correction ( sic ) reads @xmath29",
    "the mean - field equations are derived from a given energy expression by variation with respect to the single - electron wavefunctions @xmath30 .",
    "this reads in general @xmath31 where the self - consistent mean - field ( mf ) contribution @xmath32 from the electron - electron interaction depends on the actual level of approach .",
    "the unperturbed part @xmath13 remains the same in all approaches .",
    "all further discussions concentrate on the mean - field potential .",
    "note that the mean - field hamiltonian may depend on the state @xmath11 on which it acts .",
    "that will be a major topic in the following .      in the hartree - fock ( hf ) scheme",
    ", the fock term automatically cancels all self - interactions .",
    "it is the most complete approach in the variational space of slater states and provides the reference theory as we work at the level of exchange only .",
    "the mean - field potential @xmath33 then reads @xmath34     =     \\frac{g}{2}\\rho(r )     \\quad.\\ ] ] it is hermitian and so becomes the total mean - field hamiltonian @xmath35 . for then , the solutions of eq .",
    "( [ eq : mfgeneral ] ) are orthonormal .",
    "the mean - field equations can also be expressed in terms of matrix elements which reads , for the two - state model , @xmath36      the situation is very similar to hf , except for a different factor in front of the mean - field potential .",
    "we have now , for @xmath33 , @xmath37     =     { g}\\rho(r )     \\quad.\\ ] ] the further handling proceeds as for hf in the previous subsection .",
    "the off - diagonal elements have to fulfill @xmath38 and diagonal ones define the hartree single - particle energies @xmath39 .",
    "note that the hartree scheme is here considered as the analogue of the local density approximation widely used in dft .",
    "variation of the sic energy ( [ eq : e - sic ] ) yields for the mean - field potential  : @xmath40     -     u^\\mathrm{(ha)}[|\\psi_{i\\sigma}(r)|^2 ]    \\quad.\\ ] ] this mean - field potential now depends explicitely on the state on which it acts .",
    "orthonormality of the solution of the mean - field equation ( [ eq : mfgeneral ] ) is not guaranteed anymore .",
    "several strategies are used to deal with that complication .",
    "we will present three variants and compare them step by step .      a straightforward attack to the problem is to solve the eigenvalue equations ( [ eq : mfgeneral ] ) for each state separately and to apply explicit orthonormalization _ a posteriori _ , e.g. by a gram - schmidt procedure .",
    "this reads    [ eq : sicnaive ] @xmath41    the equations ( [ eq : sicnaivei ] ) look seducing .",
    "however , one does not solve the eigenvalue problem for @xmath42 in full but only in a restricted space where all states below have been projected out by the orthogonalization .",
    "we will denote that approach by the acronym `` osic '' .",
    "the price to be paid for that simplification will be checked in our detailed example below .",
    "a more satisfactory scheme consists in using lagrange multipliers to impose the orthonormality constraint , @xmath43 , at the level of the variational formulation following  @xcite .",
    "we will refer to this scheme by the acronym `` lsic '' .",
    "the system one has to solve is then given by  :    [ eq : lsic ] @xmath44 where @xmath45 is defined in eq .",
    "( [ eq : mfgeneral ] ) and the lagrange multipliers are given by @xmath46 .",
    "furthermore the orthonormality of the @xmath27 imposes a `` symmetry '' condition on the @xmath47  : @xmath48    that equation is more involved than eq .",
    "( [ eq : mfgeneral ] ) , since it is no longer an eigenvalue equation but they guarantee that the solutions @xmath30 will be orthogonal . furthermore , as eq .",
    "( [ sym_lfsic ] ) stems from a variational principle on the energy in an effectively reduced space ( orthonormal orbitals ) , it is necessary fulfilled .",
    "the constrained equations ( [ eq : lsic ] ) do not yield immediately single - particle energies as the @xmath47 matrix is not diagonal .",
    "we thus define the @xmath49 as eigenvalues of the constraint matrix @xmath50 .",
    "( [ sym_lfsic ] ) shows that @xmath50 is a hermitian matrix .",
    "thus a diagonalization is possible and the definition makes sense .",
    "one could be very naive and ignore the orthonormality at all . in our model , that amounts simply to solve the eigenvalue problem with @xmath51 associating the solution with lowest eigenvalue and with @xmath52 associating the highest eigenvalue . that naive sic scheme will be labeled by the acronym n - osic for `` non - orthonormalized sic '' , in order to stress the loss of orthonormalization of the eigenstates .",
    "we consider that , in principle prohibited , option for pedagogical purposes .",
    "the aim is to check the simultaneous fulfillment of the mean - field equations ( [ eq : mfgeneral ] ) for each state @xmath15 in the two - state model together with orthonormality of the corresponding solutions @xmath30 .",
    "we restrict the solutions to the configuration space spanned by the two energetically lowest eigenstates @xmath53 and @xmath54 of the unperturbed problem , see section [ sec : model ] .",
    "the solutions of the interacting mean - field equations will thus be expanded as @xmath55 the same way for both spins .",
    "that transformation maintains normalization of the @xmath27 .",
    "it becomes a unitary transformation if @xmath56 and then also keeps orthogonality between the @xmath27 .",
    "however we _ a priori _ start with @xmath57 .",
    "solution of mean - field equations means that the variance of the corresponding mean - field hamiltonian becomes zero .",
    "thus we consider as a global measure of convergence the squared deviations from the goal , @xmath58 where the mean field variances for hf , hartree , n - osic and osic read    [ variance_h ] @xmath59 while in the case of lsic , these expressions are more involved , due to the lagrange multipliers @xmath60 , @xmath61    the mean value of @xmath62 is defined as @xmath63 .",
    "the solution is found by searching the global minimum of @xmath64 in the space of the angles @xmath65 and @xmath66 .",
    "the natural result @xmath67 emerges immediately for hf , hartree and lsic .",
    "the case remains open for n - osic and osic .",
    "four coupling constants @xmath68 have been tested  : @xmath69 , @xmath70 , 0.5 and 1.5 .",
    "for all cases , the hf single particle energies correspond to bound states and the shifts in energy are rather small , consistently with the fact that our zero - range interaction potential is a perturbation of @xmath13 , as we work in the basis of the eigenstates of @xmath13 . for @xmath71 ,",
    "the repulsion starts to be too strong and the eigenstates are less and less bound , or even not bound anymore .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : energy ] , we present the two eigen - energies @xmath72 and @xmath73 for the various schemes .",
    "remind that the hf values represent our benchmark calculations .",
    "as expected , the hartree calculation , which does not account for any sic , gives values that are far from the hf energies . for negative coupling constants ,",
    "the hartree states are too bound , while for positive values , they are less bound .",
    "this is not a surprise , since comparing eqs .",
    "( [ eq : u_hf ] ) and ( [ eq : u_ha ] ) , @xmath74 is twice larger than @xmath75 .",
    "when sic is included , the eigen - energies are very close to the hf results . surprisingly sic without imposing the orthogonality of the @xmath27 ( n - osic ) works remarkably well , and",
    "actually the corresponding energies are indistinguishable from those of sic with orthogonality .",
    "however our concern is precisely the conservation of orthogonality . following that aim ,",
    "we have plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : indicators ] two indicators of the resolution precision for each scheme  : the ratio of the hamiltonian variance over its mean value , @xmath76 , see eq .",
    "( [ eq : chi2 ] ) , for all sic schemes , and the orthogonality violation of the @xmath27 , @xmath77 , only in the case of hf , hartree , sic , n - osic and osic .",
    "note that such an indicator should not exist neither for osic nor for lsic , since the orthogonality of the @xmath27 is explicitely taken into account in both schemes . and",
    "indeed @xmath77 vanishes for lsic as it should , for the orthonormalization of the @xmath27 is imposed in the variational derivation of the total energy .",
    "however in osic , as is discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : osic ] , the brute force orthogonalization restricts the space of the @xmath27 and a vanishing minimum of the @xmath64 , eq .",
    "( [ eq : chi2 ] ) , may not exist . and",
    "this is indeed the case as we shall see below .",
    "as expected , hf and hartree , which are hermitian , give perfect indicators in the sense that they are equal to zero  : @xmath76 is about @xmath78 , while the orthogonality of the @xmath27 is verified within an error less than @xmath79 . in lsic",
    ", we also obtain the same order of magnitude for @xmath76 .",
    "now let us focus on the various sic we have tested . in n - osic ,",
    "( [ eq : sicnaive ] ) , the standard deviation of @xmath80 is one order of magnitude higher than in lsic but remains very small ( less than @xmath81 ) .",
    "however , since no orthogonality has been taken into account , @xmath77 does not vanish , as expected  : it ranges from 3  % up to 25  % .",
    "when one minimizes at the same time the standard deviation of @xmath80 and the orthogonality condition ( osic scheme ) , one of course obtains a better indicator for the orthogonality of the @xmath27 , as is visible in fig .",
    "[ fig : indicators ] when comparing circles ( n - osic ) with squares ( osic ) . in the latter case ,",
    "the orthogonality is violated by 0.45  % .",
    "but note that @xmath76 does not vanish as well  : for small couplings , it varies between 1  % and 2  % , while it goes up to 11.5% in the worst case .",
    "this means that , in this example , it is impossible to solve in a satisfactory way schrdinger equations with orthogonal eigenstates . and actually , the violation is shared among the orthogonality and the variance of @xmath80 .    to end this section , we come back to the osic scheme . as stated just above , the violation of the vanishing of both orthogonality and variance of @xmath80 is shared among these two constraints .",
    "one can actually give more weight to one condition with respect to the other one , for instance to the schrdinger equations .",
    "in fig .  [",
    "fig : weight ] , we have plotted the results of the minimization of @xmath82 where @xmath83 is a weight varying between 0 and 1 , for a coupling constant of 0.5 . we note that indeed , whatever the weight , both constraints are violated by the same order of magnitude .",
    "this means once again that it is impossible to meet both conditions at the same time in the osic scheme .",
    "we have investigated the problem of orthonormality of the occupied single - particle states in mean - field equations with self - interaction correction ( sic ) . to that end , we have used a simple two - state model with zero - range interaction which concentrates fully on the share amongst the occupied states through sic . the full hartree - fock ( hf ) case serves as a benchmark .",
    "the hf hamiltonian is hermitian and we have energy diagonality together with orthonormality of the states .",
    "the same holds for the hartree approach which , however , is plagued by the self - interaction error .",
    "sic produces a state - dependent hamiltonian and orthonormality becomes an issue . naively ignoring that , yields deceivingly good results for the energies but awfully wrong wavefunctions , with disastrous consequences for other observables .",
    "taking care by explicit gram - schmidt orthonormalization during the mean - field solution provides acceptable results leaving , however , non - negligible variances in the energy .",
    "the error can remain small depending on the case .",
    "the consistent scheme dealing with a matrix of lagrange multipliers is a bit involved and requires a separate step to defined single particle energy .",
    "but it is the only scheme delivering consistent and satisfying sic results .",
    "note that , in static calculations , the orthonormalization may be a marginal problem in many cases as observables are found to stay very close to the hf ones .",
    "however it will build up to large errors in time - dependent cases and could even lead to divergencies ."
