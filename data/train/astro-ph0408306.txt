    "the lack of a convincing detection of hydrogen in the spectrum of any type ia supernova has been difficult to reconcile in the single - degenerate scenario where the non - degenerate companion , in most candidate progenitor channels , is hydrogen - rich .",
    "however , @xcite recently announced the discovery of h@xmath0 emission associated with the type ia supernova , sn 2002ic . over a time - span of about + 7 to + 48d from maximum light ( @xmath5 = jd 2452601 = 2002 november 22 ; *",
    "4 ) , the optical spectra of sn  2002ic exhibited similar but weaker features to those of ` normal ' type  ia sne .",
    "however , strong h@xmath0 emission was also apparent : the h@xmath0 feature consisted of a narrow component ( unresolved at 300 ) atop a broad component ( fwhm @xmath11800 ) . while the narrow component could have beeen due to an underlying hii region ( but see below ) , @xcite argued that the broad component arose from ejecta / circumstellar medium ( csm ) interaction , and that this interaction also provided the continuum source required to dilute the spectral features of sn 2002ic . by day + 48 , they found that the spectrum could be equally well - matched by either a suitably ` diluted ' coeval spectrum of the type  ia sn 1990n , or by an unmodified , roughly coeval spectrum of the type  iin sn 1997cy .",
    "type  iin supernovae ( sne  iin ) are so called because of the presence at early times of narrow lines in the spectra originating in a relatively undisturbed circumstellar medium ( csm ) @xcite .",
    "their progenitors must therefore have undergone one or more mass - loss phases before explosion .    in order to investigate the origin of the hydrogen emission and hence the nature of sn  2002ic and its circumstellar environment , we have acquired high resolution optical spectroscopy at + 256  days , and @xmath6-band ir photometry at + 278 and 380  days .",
    "the first results of this study are presented here .",
    "we obtained optical spectra of sn 2002ic and its purported host galaxy on 2003 august 05 ( = + 256d ) with the eso very large telescope ( vlt ) unit 2 ( kueyen ) and ultra - violet echelle spectrograph ( uves ) .",
    "we used a 3  ( pa=90 ) slit which yielded a resolution of @xmath19 .",
    "the seeing was @xmath109 .",
    "the exposure times for sn 2002ic and the galaxy were 2200s and 1100s respectively .",
    "the data were reduced in the figaro 4 environment .",
    "wavelength calibration was by means of a thar arc taken at the end of the exposure of each of the targets .",
    "flux calibration was carried out with respect to the spectrophotometric standard feige 110 .",

    "fig : ha ] .",
    "the spectrum is dominated by a strong h@xmath0 feature .",
    "in addition , a weak broad feature around 9000  is present which is the blend of o  i 8446  and the ca  ii ir triplet @xcite .",
    "in fig.[fig : ha]b we show the h@xmath0 profile in more detail : it comprises a narrow , but resolved , p cygni - like profile atop a broad emission feature .",
    "there may also be a very broad feature present , but owing to the blue limit of the spectrum , we are unable to give a complete description of this feature .",
    "the @xcite + 217d spectrum extends further to the blue , and they attribute the very broad feature to [ oi]6300,6364 , ( fwhm@xmath7 ) .",
    "we do not give further consideration to this component .",
    "however , we note that as a consequence of the presence of the very broad feature , some authors refer to the `` broad emission feature '' mentioned above and shown in fig .",

    ", we generated a model p  cygni profile using a homologously expanding csm above a photosphere , with a rest frame wavelength equal to that of the narrow peak and an exponentially - declining density profile .",
    "the p  cygni profile parameters were adjusted by eye to match the absorption component , yielding a velocity of 100  at the photosphere , and an e - folding velocity of 30 .",
    "the maximum detectable extent of the blue wing of the absorption is @xmath1250 .",
    "the p  cygni model also demonstrated that the narrow component includes additional emission not taken into account by the absorption .",
    "both the narrow emission component and the p  cygni profile suggest a csm velocity of 80100 .",
    "in addition , there is a small but significant shift between the narrow emission component and the 1500  component in the sense that the narrow component peak is @xmath9  further to the red .",

    "we determined the redshift of sn 2002ic from the narrow emission component of the p cygni profile and found it to be @xmath10 .",
    "this is consistent with the measurement of @xcite .",
    "our redshift implies a distance of @xmath1280  mpc ( @xmath11 = 70mpc@xmath4 ) . according to @xcite ,",
    "the redshift of the galaxy @xmath15  e of sn 2002ic ( marked a in fig .",

    "fortuitously , during our uves observation of the supernova , the extreme eastern end of the slit intercepted the nuclear region of galaxy  a. we noticed an emission feature at the corresponding spatial position ( along the slit ) in the spectra , and in the same order as the h@xmath0 feature of sn 2002ic , shifted only slightly in wavelength . assuming the feature was also due to h@xmath0 emission ( but from galaxy  a ) , we derive @xmath13 .",
    "this indicates that galaxy  a must be the host of sn 2002ic .",
    "hamuy ( priv . comm . ) confirms that , owing to a target acquisition error , the redshift given for the host galaxy in @xcite is incorrect .",
    "the narrow component of the h@xmath0 feature suggests an origin in a wind flowing at @xmath14 .",
    "the presence and velocity of the p  cygni - like absorption immediately rules out an origin in a line - of - sight hii region i.e. the narrow emission / absorption feature is intrinsic to the supernova or its immediate environment .",
    "the similarity of the early - time , low - resolution spectra of sn 2002ic to that of the type iin sn 1997cy has been noted by several authors .",
    "we find that the similarity also holds at high resolution ; the late - time h@xmath0 profile of sn 2002ic is compared to those of type  iin supernovae observed at comparable epochs in fig .",
    "[ fig : hires_sne ] .",
    "narrow emission / absorption profiles superimposed on broad emission features have been observed in the type  iin events sn 1997ab at 425d and sn 1997eg at + 202d @xcite . for sn",
    "1997ab the narrow absorption blue wing limit yields a velocity of 90 , superimposed on an emission feature of @xmath11800  fwhm , with wings extending to @xmath14000 . for sn 1997eg , the corresponding figures are 160 , 3800and @xmath111000 . in both cases the narrow feature",
    "is displaced redward of the peak of the broad component by @xmath1600 .",
    "@xcite attribute the apparent relative shifts to self - absorption in the intermediate component which preferentially attenuates the red wing . as indicated above",
    ", the sn2002ic narrow component also exhibits a ` redshift ' relative to the broad peak , but at 111  the shift is much smaller , suggesting that self - absorption is less important .",
    "the luminosity of the narrow and intermediate h@xmath0 features of sn2002ic are , respectively , @xmath15ergs@xmath4 and @xmath16  ergs@xmath4 .",
    "the 1500  component is probably produced by the supernova ejecta / wind interaction , as suggested by @xcite .",
    "we note that the width of the broad component declined from 1800  to 1500  between days + 47 and + 256 .",
    "this gives additional weight to the ejecta / wind interaction scenario .",
    "the high late - time luminosity of sn  2002ic allows us to rule out radioactive decay of @xmath17ni as the dominant energy source .",
    "the @xmath18 light curve @xcite gives a luminosity of @xmath19  ergs@xmath4 at 250d , whereas the total radioactive luminosity of 0.7m@xmath2 @xmath17ni at this epoch is only @xmath20  ergs@xmath4 .",
    "moreover , by + 250 , only about @xmath110% of the decay gamma - rays would be deposited in the ejecta of the presumed type  ia sn ejecta ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "therefore , the dominant source of energy for the broad component luminosity , @xmath21 , must be due to the ejecta / csm interaction . in this scenario",
    ", @xmath21 is proportional to the kinetic energy dissipation rate across the shock front .",
    "we can use this luminosity to estimate the mass - loss rate , @xmath22 , @xcite :    @xmath23    where @xmath24 is an efficiency factor which peaks at @xmath10.1 .",
    "@xmath25 is the shock velocity , and @xmath26 is the velocity of the unshocked wind , assumed to be freely - expanding . from the broad h@xmath0 line , @xmath25= 2900 , while the narrow feature gives @xmath27=100 .",
    "substituting into the above equation , and using the broad component luminosity , we obtain a mass - loss rate of @xmath28/0.1)m@xmath29yr@xmath4 .",
    "@xcite also show that by using the luminosities of both the broad and narrow emission components , the csm density and mass can be estimated . using the component luminosities given above",
    ", we find that the number density at the csm inner limit on day  256 is @xmath30@xmath31 .",
    "assuming that the csm was created by a steady wind ( density @xmath32 @xmath33 ) and that the inner limit of the csm on day  256 corresponds to the radius reached by the 2900  shock , we find a total csm mass of @xmath34m@xmath2 , where @xmath35 and @xmath36 are , respectively , the inner and outer limits of the csm , and @xmath37 .",
    "@xmath35 can be identified with the shock radius .",
    "we now consider the ir emission . on day + 380 , @xmath380.04 .",
    "such a colour corresponds to a 1430@xmath3940k blackbody .",
    "we therefore propose that the late - time ir emission is due to thermal emission from hot dust associated with sn  2002ic or its progenitor .",
    "however , it is possible that the ir flux contains a component due to hot ( t@xmath110,000k ) residual photospheric emission such as might be produced by the shock / csm interaction .",
    "we therefore measured the continuum level in the vicinity of 0.94@xmath40 m on day + 256 and extrapolated to day  + 380 assuming an exponential decline timescale of 170d @xcite .",
    "we then extrapolated to the @xmath41 and @xmath42 bands assuming a rayleigh - jeans law . from this",
    "we conclude that @xmath130% and @xmath18.5% of the @xmath41 and @xmath42 band fluxes respectively was due to contamination by the hot photosphere . after subtracting the photospheric component and correcting for a galactic extinction of a@xmath43 ( ned ) ,",
    "we find that the net ir flux on day  380 can be reproduced by a t=1220k blackbody and a luminosity of @xmath20  ergs@xmath4 .",
    "the corresponding figure for + 278d ( assuming the same temperature ) is @xmath44ergs@xmath4 .",
    "we note that if the ir emission were due to dust condensation in the ejecta , for the corresponding 1220k blackbody to attain these luminosities it would need to have expanded at 80009000  since the supernova exploded .",
    "we now consider the location and origin of the hot dust .",
    "we first note that as with the @xmath18 emission , contemporary radioactive decay can have made only a minor contribution to the late - time ir luminosity of sn2002ic .",
    "we also note that dust is not expected to condense in type ia explosions .",
    "this is consistent with the fact that to produce the observed ir luminosity , the 1220k blackbody surface would have to be located as far out as the @xmath18500  region of the ejecta .",
    "dust condensation in such circumstances seems unlikely .",
    "we conclude that the ir luminosity arises from a pre - existing dusty csm .",
    "heating of this dust can be via ( a ) local heating by the ongoing ejecta / csm shock interaction , or ( b ) photon emission from the supernova yielding an ir echo in the unshocked csm .",
    "@xcite find velocities exceeding 10000  in c , o , and ca , which they attribute to the supernova ejecta .",
    "thus , local heating of a dusty csm by the ejecta / csm shock might seem to be a possibility .",
    "however , the the initial flash from the supernova would have evaporated any csm dust to at least @xmath13500  au for carbon - rich grains ( t@xmath45 ) and 16,500  au for oxygen - rich grains ( t@xmath46 ) @xcite . yet",
    "a 10000  shock would have reached only 1600au by + 278d .",
    "we therefore rule out local heating of the dust by the ejecta / csm shock .",
    "we now test the possibility that the ir emission arose from the heating of csm dust by photons from the supernova i.e. the ir - echo scenario .",
    "we use the bolometric light curve of @xcite which can be approximately described as having a peak ( t=0 ) luminosity of @xmath47 ergs@xmath4 and an exponential decline timescale of 170d .",
    "we attribute this slow decline to the energy released in the interaction of the shock with the csm .",
    "the bolometric light curve is based on @xmath18 photometry , and so does not include possible additional energy from an x - ray precursor .",
    "however , given the much higher opacity of dust grains to uv - optical light , it is likely that the x - ray contribution to grain heating will be small .",
    "@xcite showed that the ir - echo light curve comprises an initial plateau phase , followed by a decline .",
    "the transition from plateau to decline corresponds to the passing of the ellipsoid vertex from the dust - free cavity into the region of unevaporated dust .",
    "thus , the radius of the dust free cavity @xmath48 .",
    "we noted that the ir flux from sn2002ic barely changed between days  278 and 380 . from this",
    "we conclude that the vertex was still within the dust - free cavity on day 380 , implying a cavity radius of @xmath49au .",
    "we use eq.17 in @xcite to estimate the optical depth of dust required to yield the observed ir flux from sn  2002ic .",
    "the parameters adopted were : @xmath50  au , d = 280mpc , dust ir emissivity proportional to @xmath51 for wavelengths down to 0.2@xmath40 m , a mean uv - visual absorption efficiency of 1 , and an initial dust temperature at the cavity boundary assumed to be about equal to an evaporation temperature of 1500k .",
    "the csm was assumed to have been produced by a steady wind so that the density is proportional to @xmath33 .",
    "we find that the ir flux at both epochs is reproduced with a dust optical depth of @xmath52 . for a gas - to - dust mass ratio of 160 , a grain material density of 3g@xmath31 and a grain radius of 0.1@xmath40 m ,",
    "this translates ( from * ? ? ?",
    "* ) into a total csm mass ( including the dust - free cavity ) of @xmath10.3@xmath53m@xmath2 , where @xmath36 is the outer limit of the csm and @xmath54 .",
    "thus the csm mass exceeds 0.3m@xmath2 . the corresponding mass loss rate ( again for @xmath54 ) ,",
    "assuming a wind velocity of 100 is @xmath55  m@xmath2yr@xmath4 ( * ? ? ?",
    "it is about @xmath565 the value which @xcite derived for the type  iil sn  1979c .",
    "compared with the derivations from the h@xmath0 line , the ir analysis produces a lower mass - loss rate ( @xmath11% ) .",
    "this discrepancy could , in part , be due to an underestimate of the shock velocity leading to an overestimate of the mass - loss rate derived from the broad @xmath57 line .",
    "nevertheless , both analyses indicate a csm mass probably exceeding 0.3m@xmath2 produced by a mass loss rate greater than several times @xmath3m@xmath2yr@xmath4 . the mass - loss rate inferred from this work and that of others is higher than expected from traditional mass loss mechanisms .",
    "we remark that the high values of @xmath22 are  at least partly  a consequence of simplifying assumptions e.g. clumped winds would mimic a high mass - loss rate .",
    "the close similarity between sn 2002ic and type iin sne , has raised doubts as to whether sn 2002ic is a _ bona fide _ ia event and whether other type iin ( i.e. core - collapse ) sne , only discovered at late epochs , may have been sn 2002ic - like events .",
    "we suggest that the type iin phenomenon is predominantly related to the amount of csm around the progenitor system rather than the type of explosion . a type 1.5 scenario i.e. the explosion of a single",
    ", massive agb star has been invoked as a possible progenitor of sn 2002ic .",
    "we point out that an extremely low metallicity would be required to inhibit mass - loss so as to allow the degenerate core to grow to m@xmath58 e.g. , a 4m@xmath29 star would need to have @xmath59 @xcite . also , a low mass - loss rate is at odds with the large amount of csm inferred for this event , although we can not rule out the possibility that the csm is due to a binary companion .",
    "furthermore , sn 2002ic exhibited an exceptionally high maximum @xmath60-band luminosity and a much slower post-@xmath1 + 25days decline rate in @xmath61 than is seen in normal sne  ia .",
    "the opposite effect would be expected for type 1.5 events i.e. the photometric and spectral evolution should be similar to ii events at early times and dominated by the decay of radioactive ni and co at late times as for type i and iip events @xcite .",
    "any progenitor scenario must satisfy all the observational constraints _ viz : _ the type ia - like behaviour at early - times and the type iin behaviour at late - times @xcite ; broad profiles of ca and o @xcite ; an aspherical csm @xcite ; a slow - moving outflow at @xmath62  and a dusty csm .",
    "it must also explain the apparent rarity of sn 2002ic - like events .",
    "taking these observational constraints at face - value , we currently favour a system involving a post - agb star .",
    "there are several known examples of post - agb stars that have high inferred mass - loss rates and dusty discs csm ) ( e.g. iras 08544 - 4431 , * ? ? ?",
    "these objects have typical outflow velocities of the order of 100 .",
    "furthermore , the post - agb phase can be relatively short , @xmath63 yrs . @xcite .",
    "further planned observations will no doubt provide more clues as to the previous evolution of sn 2002ic .",
