    "nonclassical state has an important role in understanding deeply some fundamental problems in the field of quantum mechanics .",
    "in order to realize this purpose , many experimental and theoretical protocols have been proposed to generate and manipulate such nonclassical quantum states @xcite . in these protocols , the photon addition @xmath0 , as a non - gaussian operation , can create a nonclassical state from any classical state @xcite .",
    "in addition , practically realizable non - gaussian operations including the photon subtraction @xmath1 or addition @xmath0 or the superposition of both were used to improve the nonclassicality , the degree of entanglement , the fidelity of continuous variable teleportation , loophole - free tests of bell s inequality , and quantum computing , as well as the performance of quantum - key - distribution @xcite .",
    "for example , the quantum commutation rules have been probed experimentally by using addition and subtraction of single photons to / from a light field @xcite .",
    "in addition , the multi - photon process has experimentally an theoretically attracted much attention @xcite .",
    "for example , the multi - photon excited coherent state has been introduced by agarwl , and the corresponding nonclassical properties and experimental preparation are discussed by using parametric down - conversion and homodyne tomography technology @xcite .",
    "single photon addition is used theoretically to improve the performance of quantum - key - distribution @xcite . recently",
    ", multiple - photon subtraction and addition have been used to enhance the degree of entanglement for two - mode squeezed vacuum ( tmsv ) and the fidelity of teleportation with continuous @xcite .",
    "it is shown that the highest entanglement , the fidelity and some squeezing properties can be improved for the tmsv with symmetric multi - photon subtraction operations .",
    "both two non - gaussian operations can actually be realized by using the linear optical elements such as beam splitter and conditional measurement on ancillary outcome , which is probabilistic but more feasible in the laboratory compared with nonlinear process .    on the other hand , it is interesting to notice that hermite polynomial states can be considered as the minimum uncertain states @xcite , on which are focused by some researchers @xcite .",
    "for instance , a generalized hermite polynomial s operation has been theoretically introduced and operated on single - mode squeezed vacuum and coherent state @xcite , such as @xmath2 and @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the coordinate operator and @xmath5 is the glauber coherent state , and @xmath6 is the single - mode squeezed vacuum .",
    "it is found that all these nonclassicalities can be enhanced by hermite polynomial operation and two adjustable parameters @xcite . however , there is no scheme proposed to generate such these polynomial states .",
    "the implementation of such non - gaussian operations is still a very challenging task @xcite .    in order to prepare the non - gaussian states , excepting for photon addition and subtraction or both ,",
    "the quantum catalysis is also a feasible strategy to generate nonclassical quantum states @xcite .",
    "the analogy to catalysis is to perform a measurement with the same number of photons as ancillary mode on one output , which can generate an effective nonlinearity . in this paper",
    ", we shall introduce a new kind of non - gaussian quantum stateslaguerre polynomial excited coherent states ( lpecss ) , which can be produced by using beam splitter and a special conditional measurement ( multi - photon catalysis ) on one of two outports .",
    "then we investigate the nonclassical properties according to the mandel s q parameter and second - order correlation function , photon - number distribution , squeezing property as well as the wigner function .",
    "particularly , we also discuss the decoherence effect of thermal channel on the lpecss by deriving analytically the wigner function .",
    "there is no report about this non - gaussian state generated by multiphoton catalysis before , including the effect of decoherence on the nonclassicality .",
    "this work is arranged as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we propose the protocol for generating such a kind of non - gaussian state by using the heralded interference and conditional measurement . in sec .",
    "iii , we derive the normalization factor , which is important for further discussing the statistical properties of the state .",
    "it is shown that the factor is related to the two - variable hermite polynomials . in sec .",
    "iv , we present the statistical properties of the state , such as photon - number distribution , squeezing , etc .",
    "secs . v and vi are devoted to investigating the nonclassicality in terms of the negativity of wigner function without and with the effect of decoherence of the thermal channel , respectively .",
    "our conclusions and discussions are presented in the last section .",
    "the scheme for generating an optical state @xmath7 by the heralded interference and conditional measuring @xmath8 photons is shown in fig.1 . in fig.1 , an arbitrary input pure state @xmath9 and an @xmath10photon fock state @xmath11",

    "recently , for another example , the single - photon - added coherent state has been used in quantum key distribution @xcite . it is shown that the single - photon - added coherent source can greatly exceed all other existing sources in both bb84 protocol and the recently proposed measurement - device - independent quantum key distribution .",
    "these investigations are good examples for showing that it is possible to enhance the performance in the field of quantum information by preparing various non - gaussian states .",
    "thus , the applications of such non - gaussian states including the lpecss with continuous - variable in quantum information could be paid attention in the future .",

    "<S> we theoretically introduce a new kind of non - gaussian statelaguerre polynomial excited coherent states by using the multiphoton catalysis which actually can be considered as a block comprising photon number operator . </S>",
    "<S> it is found that the normalized factor is related to the two - variable hermite polynomials . </S>",
    "<S> we then investigate the nonclassical properties in terms of mandel s q parameter , quadrature squeezing , second correlation , and the negativity of wigner function ( wf ) . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that all these properties are related to the amplitude of coherent state , catalysis number and unbalanced beam splitter ( bs ) . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , the maximum degree of squeezing can be enhanced as catalysis number and keeps a constant for single - photon catalysis . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , we examine the effect of decoherence by wigner function , which show that the negative region , characteristic time of decoherence and structure of wf are affected by catalysis number and unbalanced bs . </S>",
