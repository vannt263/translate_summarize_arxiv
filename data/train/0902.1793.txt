    ", this four - wave mixing scheme produces many pairs of spatially entangled modes  @xcite , in analogy to a recent optical experiment  @xcite .",

    "the equivalent of laser light is a bose - einstein condensate .",

    "the two modes are exactly correlated in number , and anti - correlated in phase .",

    "the phase difference between the modes is insensitive to anti - correlations , and thus measurement of the _ relative _ phase will not help demonstrate entanglement between these states .",

    "in optics the quadrature measurements required to demonstrate entanglement can be made by balanced homodyning that mixes the signal beams with a phase reference beam on a 50 - 50 beam splitter .",

    "this is achieved by first using a @xmath47 bragg pulse to transfer half of the atoms from mode 0 to mode 3 which is initially unpopulated .",
    "a weak bragg pulse will not affect modes 1 or 2 due to the doppler shift of light .",

    "collisions have a negative impact on the measurement scheme and reduce the strength of correlation between the quadratures . if the radial trapping is very strong , releasing the trap suddenly could potentially result in complex three - dimensional collision dynamics that could disturb the fragile entangled state .",
    "to avoid most of these collisions , the trapping potential may be ramped down adiabatically over a timescale short compared to the rest of the experiment ( but fast compared to @xmath102 ) , removing most of the interaction energy from the system while preserving the quasi - one - dimensional state .",
