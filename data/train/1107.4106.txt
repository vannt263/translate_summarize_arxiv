    "estimates for the rates of gravitational radiation ( gr ) sources from coalescing degenerate binaries are typically performed with population synthesis methods ( e.g. , lipunov , postnov & prokhorov 1997 ; bethe & brown 1998 ; de donder & vanbeveren 1998 ; bloom , sigurdsson & pols 1999 ; fryer , woosley & hartmann 1999 ; nelemans , yungelson & portegies zwart 2001 , voss & tauris 2003 or more recently belczynski et al .",
    "these studies attempt to explain the past evolution of the given observed binary or stellar population and put some constraints on the physics of stellar / binary evolution ( e.g. , valsecchi et al .",
    "nevertheless , there are often critical model parameters that are poorly constrained .",
    "recently , bulik , belczynski & prestwich ( 2011 ) have taken a different approach , examining specific binary systems with well established parameters and investigating their future evolution . if a binary is chosen close to the end of its life ( e.g. , the formation of double compact object ) such a method has potentially great predictive power as many unknowns relating to its prior binary and stellar evolution can be avoided .",
    "in particular , bulik et al .",
    "( 2011 ) considered two high mass x - ray binaries ( hmxbs ) , ic10 x-1 and ngc300 x-1 , and showed that these systems will soon form close black hole + black hole ( bh - bh ) systems that will merge within hubble time and produce strong gr signature .",
    "this provided an empirical lower limit of detection chances for the current gr instruments without direct reference to population synthesis methods .    in this study , we consider the future evolution of one of the most interesting binaries known in our galaxy : cyg x-1 .",
    "recently , the distance to this system was determined by radio parallax and other methods ( reid et al .",
    "2011 ; xiang et al .",
    "2011 ) , allowing the basic parameters of this binary to be firmly established ( orosz et al .",
    "this hmxb hosts one of the most massive ( @xmath8 ) galactic bhs in a close orbit around a massive ( @xmath9 ) o star .",
    "since the companion is in the mass range for neutron star formation , we have selected this system to investigate yet another unobserved population of potential gr sources : black holes + neutron star ( bh - ns ) systems .",
    "to evolve the system forward in time we use evolutionary prescriptions incorporated in the startrack population synthesis code ( belczynski et al .",
    "the evolution of the system is relatively simple and we do not need any population synthesis tools at this point .",
    "we start off with the best estimate of current binary parameters ; the black hole with the mass @xmath10 , the optical star with the mass @xmath11 and radius of @xmath12 and the orbital period @xmath13d ( orosz et al .",
    ".    the optical companion is almost filling its roche lobe and will start roche lobe overflow ( rlof ) in less than 0.2 myr while still on main sequence ( see fig .  [ radius ] ) .",
    "the mass ratio is close to unity so we do not expect the common envelope evolution , but rather a stable rlof phase ( belczynski et al .",
    "2008b , wellstein , langer & braun 2001 ) .",
    "however , the mass transfer rate may reach quite high values while the donor is moving through hertzsprung gap ( hg ) .",
    "the evolution of the system is presented in figure  [ rlof ] .",
    "mass transfer rate is calculated using physical properties of the donor and the system parameters ( belczynski et al .",
    "the mass accretion onto bh is calculated using the slim disk models ( e.g. , abramowicz et al .",
    "1988 ; ohsuga et al . 2005 ; ohsuga 2007 ) and thus can significantly exceed the classical eddington limit ( see belczynski et al .",
    "2008b for details ) .",
    "the bh increases its mass to @xmath14 , while the optical star loses most of its mass @xmath15 to become a massive helium core with a bit of h - rich envelope .",
    "note that the majority of the mass lost from the donor is lost from the system ( highly non - conservative case ) .",
    "the period of the system increases to @xmath16d .",
    "rlof stops as the donor decreases in size due to the lost of its h - rich envelope .",
    "the massive helium or wolf - rayet ( wr ) star , ( ( @xmath17 ) is well within its roche lobe @xmath18 . after some wind mass loss ( @xmath19 ) and about @xmath20 myr after the rlof termination , the wr star explodes in type ib / c supernova and forms a neutron star ( ns ) .",
    "there is about @xmath21 mass loss in the supernova and that is not enough to disrupt the system .",
    "however , the pre - supernova binary is rather wide ( @xmath22d , and semi - major axis @xmath23 due to additional orbit expansion caused by the mass loss from the wr star ) , and any large natal kick tends to disrupt the binary . in table  [ sn ] we list the disruption and survival probabilities for two assumptions about the distribution of kick velocities .",
    "the `` full '' kicks are adopted from the velocity distribution of the galactic single pulsars that is best described by a maxwellian with 1d @xmath24 km s@xmath6",
    "( hobbs et al . 2005 ) and uniform distribution of orientation .",
    "as there may be some observational and theoretical evidence that natal kicks are smaller in close binary systems ( see the discussion in belczynski et al .",
    "2010 ) we also explore a `` half '' kick model with kicks drawn from the same distribution but with @xmath25 km s@xmath6 . as expected for such a wide system , the binary disruption and formation of two single compact objects is most likely : 94% and 74% for full and half kicks , respectively .",
    "less likely , but still quite probable is the formation of a wide bh - ns system : 5% and 25% .",
    "the least likely is the formation of the close bh - ns system with the coalescence time below hubble time ( @xmath26 gyr ) : 0.2% and 0.8% . in order for the system to form a close bh - ns binary",
    ", the supernova explosion must produce a significant kick ( @xmath27 km s@xmath6 ) that sends the ns toward the bh .",
    "additionally , we have investigated an evolutionary scenario in which the rlof starts early in the hg . since at this point",
    "the optical star has a more massive core as compared with the above example , it will retain more mass through rlof ( only the h - rich envelope is transferred / lost ) .",
    "since less mass is transferred / lost the orbital expansion is not as dramatic and the final orbital period of the binary at the supernova explosion is @xmath28d ( @xmath29 ) .",
    "this obviously leads to higher survival probabilities and higher chance of the close bh - ns formation : 0.4% and 1.4% for the full kick and half kick models , respectively .",
    "cyg x-1 has been detected because of its unusually strong x - ray brightness .",
    "let us consider the question of the formation rate of cyg x-1 like binaries in our galaxy .",
    "the upper limit on the x - ray active phase in cyg x-1 is set by the evolutionary time of the secondary , which is @xmath30 myr for a @xmath9 star .",
    "we employ this upper limit .",
    "had we adopted more formal estimate of @xmath31 myr ( it takes about @xmath31 myr for a massive star to form a bh that is already in the system and start an x - ray phase ) the estimated detection rate of bh - ns inspirals in gravitational radiation would increase by factor of 2 .",
    "given that we see just one such object and assuming that the current star formation rate is representative across the lifetime of the galaxy we can infer the formation rate of cyg x-1 like binaries as one per @xmath30 myr , i.e. @xmath32 yr@xmath6 .",
    "our simulations show that the chance of forming a merging bh - ns system is between @xmath33 and @xmath34 ( see bottom row of tab .",
    "[ sn ] ) from a cyg x-1 like progenitor .",
    "these means that the formation rate of bh - ns binaries from cyg x-1 like progenitors will be only @xmath35 yr@xmath6 .",
    "this means that only a handful ( @xmath36 ) close bh - ns systems might have been formed over a @xmath30 gyr history of the milky way . for comparison",
    "the galactic empirical ns - ns merger rate is significantly higher : ns - ns @xmath37 yr@xmath6 ( kim , kalogera & lorimer 2010 ) .",
    "the implied advanced ligo / virgo detection rate follows once we determine the range of these detector for a bh - ns system .",
    "given the final mass of the bh ( @xmath38 ) and assuming the mass of a ns to be canonical @xmath39 , we obtain the chirp mass of the newly formed system to be @xmath40 .",
    "since the range for the advanced detectors for ns - ns system with a chirp mass of @xmath41 is @xmath42 mpc , we obtain the range for such bh - ns systems of @xmath43 mpc ( the detection distance scales like @xmath44 ) .",
    "if we adopt the milky way like galaxies density in the local universe to be @xmath45  mpc@xmath46 ( e.g. , oshaughnessy et al .",
    "2008 ) , then within such distance there should be @xmath47 galaxies . combining it with the galactic rate we obtain the detection rate in the range @xmath48 yr@xmath6 , or a detection every 36 to 250 years in the advanced ligo / virgo .    the observational uncertainities on component masses ( @xmath49 ) do not play a significant role on our findings and qualitatively they do not change any of our results . the same applies to the stellar wind mass loss rate from the companion star as the @xmath50 loses only about @xmath51 during its main sequence ( e.g. , vink , de koter & lamers 2001 ) .",
    "the major uncertainities arise in the orbital evolution during rlof in which @xmath52 is lost / exchanged and supernova outcome ( natal kicks ) .",
    "so far we have discussed only one binary , cyg x-1 , as a potential progenitor of bh - ns system .",
    "tomsick & muterspaugh ( 2010 ) list several known galactic hmxbs with a ns and a companion massive enough to potentialy produce a bh : vela x-1 ( @xmath53 ) , xtej1855 - 026 ( @xmath54 ) , 4u1907 + 09 ( @xmath55 ) and gx301 ( @xmath56 ) .",
    "the expansion of massive companions will eventually lead to a rlof .",
    "these systems due to extreme mass ratio will evolve into common envelope that will result in a merger of a ns with its companion aborting the bh - ns formation .",
    "such outcome follows from the fact that the mass of a ns is so small in respect to the mass of the envelope of a companion that there is not enough orbital energy to eject companion envelope ( e.g. , webbink 1984 ) .",
    "an extragalactic system lmc x-3 hosting a @xmath57 bh was belived to have a companion massive enough to form a ns .",
    "however , recent spectral analysis that takes into account irradiation of the companion , indicates that it is a b5 dwarf setting its mass at about @xmath58 ( val - baker , norton & negueruela 2007 ) and makes it a wd progenitor .",
    "hmxbs like cyg x-1 are wind fed , and thus their non - degenerate stars do not fill their roche lobes .",
    "it is therefore curious that those binaries for which good system parameters are known tend to be close to rlof .",
    "cyg x-1 is an example : our analysis implies that the system will begin rlof in @xmath59 myr , after a lifetime about 50 times longer than that .",
    "an even more extreme case is that of lmc x-1 , in which an @xmath60 black hole is found in a 3.9 day orbit with a @xmath61 companion .",
    "the companion currently fills over 90% of its roche lobe , implying that the system will undergo rlof within @xmath62 myr ( orosz et al .",
    "note that the high mass of the companion implies that rlof will result in unstable mass transfer and the likely formation of a common envelope system  this lmc x-1 is unlikely to produce any sort of double degenerate binary .",
    "there are only a few hmxbs with precisely known system parameters , so this tendency to be alarmingly near rlof may be a statistical anomaly . alternatively , it may be a selection effect : a system in which the companion is far from rlof will have a smaller fraction of its stellar wind accrete onto the compact object , and thus a lower x - ray luminosity .",
    "nevertheless , it may be worth entertaining the idea that this effect is neither a statistical glitch nor an observational bias , but that there is some unknown physical process that halts the growth of the companion star near the roche lobe boundary .",
    "we note that the gravitational potential becomes shallow near the @xmath63 point , and x - ray irradiation becomes a bigger effect for companion stars that present a relatively large cross section .",
    "both of these effects may dramatically change the surface structure and stellar winds of the companion star as it approaches the roche lobe , conceivably in a self - limiting way .",
    "such winds might be observable through the strength , shape and variability of emission lines associated with the wind .",
    "if such an effect is present , the evolutionary path of the binary system may prove to be quite different from what is commonly assumed , and what we have assumed above .    to evaluate the possible effect this might have on rates of gr sources , we consider how the future evolution of an hmxb like cyg x-1 might proceed if it never reaches rlof .",
    "as a limiting case , we constrain the orbital period to remain at its currently observed value of @xmath13d .",
    "in fact , we expect the orbital period to increase somewhat ( even without rlof ) as mass is lost from the system in stellar wind . in this case , the survival through the supernova and the formation of the close bh - ns system is expected in @xmath64 of cases and corresponds to advanced ligo / virgo detection rate of @xmath7 per decade .",
    "so despite the fact that we have violated ( in favor of producing close bh - ns systems ) our current understanding of the stellar evolution we still do not get enough bh - ns mergers to expect detection in gravitational waves .",
