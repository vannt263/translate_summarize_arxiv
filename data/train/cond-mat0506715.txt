    "the spin of the electron in low - dimensional semiconductor structures has received intense interest in recent years due to its potential applications in spintronic devices and quantum information processing technologies.@xcite to improve the performance of such devices , the decoherence of the electron spin due to coupling to environmental degrees of freedom should be minimized .",
    "theoretical@xcite and experimental investigations@xcite have shown that the electron spin could have a extremely long relaxation time in nonmagnetic semiconductor quantum dots ( qd s ) , compared with that in the bulk or quantum wells .",
    "theoretical works proposed that the diluted magnetic semiconductor ( dms ) qd s can be used as spin aligners , spin memories as well as spin qubits.@xcite dms qd s offer us a new flexibility in manipulating carrier spins , since the spin properties can be strongly influenced by applying an external magnetic field or varying the temperature.@xcite various relaxation mechanisms of the electron spin come from different coupling to the environment , i.e. , magnetic impurity , nuclear spin , and spin - orbit interaction .",
    "it is important to identify the dominant mechanism of spin relaxation for a particular system .",
    "previous theoretical@xcite and experimental@xcite works on spin relaxation in dms quantum wells have indicated that the _ s - d _ exchange interaction between band electrons and localized spins of magnetic ions is the dominant spin - flip mechanism , leading to electron spin lifetime of the order of picoseconds . however , to the best of our knowledge , there is no study on the spin relaxation induced by the _ s - d _ exchange interaction in dms qd s .",
    "detailed theoretical and experimental investigations are necessary to gain physical insight into the spin relaxation process in such structures .    in this paper , we investigate theoretically the spin relaxation of the lowest zeeman doublet in vertical ii - vi dms qd s . the spin - flip scattering caused by",
    "the acoustic phonon - mediated _ s - d _ exchange interaction between the conduction electron and mn ions is considered .",
    "the electron - acoustic phonon coupling includes the piezoelectric and deformation potential interactions .",
    "since the first - order spin - flip process through direct scattering by the mn ions is generally blocked by the energy - matching condition , we consider the second - order process involving the emission or absorption of a phonon .",
    "our calculation shows that this phonon - mediated spin - flip scattering leads to electron spin lifetime typically of the order of microseconds .",
    "the effectiveness of this mechanism increases significantly with increasing mn concentration , electron spin splitting , vertical confining strength and lateral diameter , while it shows non - monotonic dependence on the magnetic field and temperature , due to the competing effect of the electron spin splitting , the phonon number and the correlation function of the mn ions .",
    "it is interesting to notice that the spin relaxation of electrons in the lowest zeeman doublet is suppressed in a strong magnetic field at low temperature for ii - vi dms qd s with low mn concentration .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows : the theoretical model and formula of the spin - flip scattering rate ( sfr ) induced by phonon - mediated _ s - d _ exchange interaction are derived in sec .",
    "numerical results and discussions for the sfr as a function of magnetic field , as well as its dependence on the mn concentration , qd size and temperature are given in sec .",
