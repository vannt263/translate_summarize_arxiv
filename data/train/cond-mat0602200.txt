    "the model of a directed polymer in a random medium has attracted a lot of attention in the last twenty years for two main reasons . on the one hand",
    ", it is directly related to non - equilibrium growth models @xcite ; on the other hand , it plays the role of a ` baby spin glass ' model in the field of disordered systems @xcite .",
    "this model presents a low temperature disorder dominated phase , where the order parameter is an ` overlap ' @xcite .",
    "this low temperature phase displays an extreme sensitivity with respect to temperature or disorder changes @xcite , and aging properties for the dynamics @xcite . in finite dimensions ,",
    "a scaling droplet theory was proposed @xcite , in direct correspondence with the droplet theory of spin glasses @xcite , whereas in the mean - field version of the model on the cayley , a freezing transition very similar to the one occurring in the random energy model was found @xcite .",
    "the phase diagram as a function of space dimension @xmath28 is the following @xcite : for @xmath29 , there exists a phase transition between the low temperature disorder - dominated phase and a free phase at high temperature @xcite .",
    "this phase transition has been studied numerically in @xmath30 @xcite , exactly on a cayley tree @xcite and on hierarchical lattice @xcite . on the contrary , in dimension @xmath31 , there is no free phase , i.e. any initial disorder drives the polymer into the strong disorder phase . in this paper",
    ", we will be interested in the low energy excitations above the ground state in dimensions @xmath1 .    in disordered systems , there can be states that have an energy very close to the ground state energy but which are very different from the ground state in configuration space . for spin glasses ,",
    "the debate between the droplet and replica theories concerns the probabilities and the properties of these states . in the droplet theory @xcite ,",
    "the low temperature physics is described in terms of rare regions with nearly degenerate excitations which appear with a probability that decays with a power law of their size . in the replica theory @xcite ,",
    "the replica symmetry breaking is interpreted as the presence of many pure states in the thermodynamic limit , i.e. the nearly degenerate ground states appear with a finite probability for arbitrary large size . more generally , the statistical properties of the nearly degenerate excitations ( their numbers , their sizes , their geometric properties , the barriers separating them , etc ... ) are interesting in any disordered system , since they govern all properties at very low temperature .",
    "in particular , a linear behavior in temperature of the specific heat @xmath32 seems rather generic for a large class of disordered models , including ( i ) spin glasses where this behavior is measured experimentally @xcite and numerically @xcite ( ii ) disordered elastic systems @xcite ( iii ) one - dimensional spin models where this behavior can be exactly computed via the dyson - schmidt method @xcite . for the last case , the coefficient @xmath33 of the linear term of the specific heat can be put in direct correspondence with the density @xmath34 of two - level low energy excitations of size @xmath2 @xcite via the simple formula @xmath35 . other integrals like @xmath36 with @xmath37",
    "determine the low temperature behavior of other observables .",
    "the explicit computation of the density @xmath34 of excitations as a function of their size @xmath2 has been possible only for one - dimensional models , such as the case of one particle in a random potentials @xcite and the random field ising chain via strong disorder renormalization @xcite . for higher dimensional disordered systems ,",
    "the statistics of excitations can only be studied numerically .",
    "in particular , there has been a lot of efforts to characterize the distribution and the topology of the low energy excitations in of spin glasses @xcite . for the directed polymer model in finite dimensions , we are only aware of the work of tang @xcite , where the probability of two degenerate non overlapping ground states with binary disorder in @xmath38 was found to decay as @xmath39 .",
    "our aim in this paper is to measure the statistics @xmath40 of low energy excitations of length @xmath2 , for a directed polymer of length @xmath0 in a gaussian random potential , in dimensions @xmath1 . we compare our results with the droplet scaling theory in finite dimensions @xcite .",
    "we also try to make the connection with the exact results @xcite on the cayley tree ( @xmath41 ) .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ previouswork ] , we briefly recall known results on the directed polymer in a random medium , concerning exact results in @xmath42 and @xmath41 ( cayley tree ) , as well as the spin glass inspired droplet scaling theory . after presenting the parameters of our numerical study in section [ numerics ] ,",
    "we briefly present our results on ground state energies in section [ groundstate ] , before focusing on low energy excitations .",
    "the statistics of boundary and bulk excitations are respectively studied in sections [ statexbo ] and [ statexbu ] .",
    "we finally summarize and discuss our results in section [ conclusion ] .",
    "the probability distribution of the ground state energy @xmath43 of a directed polymer of length @xmath0 in dimension @xmath44 is expected to follow a scaling form @xmath45 where @xmath46 represent the ground state energy density per monomer .",
    "the exponent @xmath6 then governs both the fluctuation and the correction to extensivity of the mean value ( note that this is not always the case in disordered systems , see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "this result has been proven in @xmath42 with the exact value of the exponent @xcite @xmath47 for the mean - field version on the cayley tree ( @xmath41 ) one has formally @xmath48 @xcite : the width is of order @xmath49 , whereas the correction to the extensive term @xmath50 in the averaged value @xmath51 is of order @xmath52 @xcite . in finite dimensions @xmath53 ,",
    "the exponent @xmath6 has been numerically measured @xcite .",
    "the values of the kpz exponent @xmath54 measured in @xcite for dimensions @xmath55 translate into the following values for the directed polymer exponent @xmath6 @xmath56 through the correspondence @xmath57 .",
    "note that the existence of a finite upper critical dimension has remained a very controversial issue between the numerical studies @xcite and various theoretical approaches @xcite . beyond the exponent @xmath58 ,",
    "the scaling function @xmath59 itself is also of interest : it is exactly known in @xmath42 @xcite ( as well as in other geometries @xcite ) , and has been studied on the cayley tree , with the conclusion that the distribution is not universal but depends on the disorder distribution @xcite .",
    "another important property of the ground state in finite dimensions @xmath28 is the probability distribution of its end - point position @xmath60 that follows the scaling form @xmath61 where the exponent @xmath62 is directly related to the previous exponent @xmath6 via the simple relation @xcite @xmath63 this corresponds to a superdiffusive behavior @xmath64 as soon as @xmath65 , and in particular in one dimension @xmath66 .",
    "the probability distribution @xmath67 has been studied for the case @xmath42 in @xcite .      in their continuum version , directed polymers in random media belong to a special class of disordered models for which exact remarkable identities for thermal fluctuations can be derived @xcite .",
    "the hamiltonian of these models have a deterministic part which consists in quadratic interactions and a random part whose statistics is translation invariant . for the directed polymer in dimension @xmath38 , this so - called statistical tilt symmetry leads in particular to the following identity for the fluctuation of the end point @xmath68 @xcite @xmath69 other identities giving relations between higher cumulants can be similarly derived @xcite .",
    "the identity ( [ cumulant ] ) is rather surprising at first sight , since the fluctuations of the end - point are found to independent of the disorder and to be exactly the same as in the absence of disorder ! the exact result ( [ cumulant ] ) is particularly interesting at very low temperature , since it predicts a linear behavior in @xmath70 of the second cumulant , and thus puts constraints on the statistics of nearly - degenerate excitations . in simpler 1d models of one particle in random potentials",
    "one can explicitly relate @xcite the linear behavior of the position fluctuations to the rare configurations with two nearly degenerate minima @xmath71 . for directed polymer in random media ,",
    "any theory of low energy excitations has to reproduce the result ( [ cumulant ] ) , and we will now describe its interpretation within the droplet theory @xcite .      the droplet theory for directed polymers @xcite , is very similar to the droplet theory of spin glasses @xcite . it is a scaling theory that can be summarized as follows . the exponent @xmath58 involved in the fluctuations of the ground state energy @xmath43 over the samples ( see eq .",
    "( [ distrie0 ] ) ) also governs the fluctuations of the energy within one sample as the end point varies . as a consequence ,",
    "if one assumes a scaling distribution analogous to ( [ distrie0 ] ) , the probability to find a nearly degenerate ground state @xmath71 of order @xmath0 behaves as @xmath72 , so it is rare , but it corresponds to a very large fluctuation of the end - point of order @xmath73 with the spatial exponent @xmath74 ( see eq .",
    "( [ distrir0 ] ) ) .",
    "the contribution of these rare nearly degenerate paths to the disorder averaged fluctuations ( [ cumulant ] ) is thus of order @xmath75 using the scaling relation ( [ zetaomega ] ) .",
    "this naive ` zero - order ' argument has to be refined if one is interested into the density @xmath40 of excitations that involve an arbitrary length @xmath2 for a polymer of length @xmath0 . for @xmath76 , the droplet theory assumes that the same scalings apply : the probability of an excitation of length @xmath2 is of order @xmath77 and leads to a fluctuation of the end - point of order @xmath78 .",
    "however now , the crucial notion of ` independent excitations ' @xcite has to be introduced to obtain a consistent picture . both for spin glasses @xcite and for directed polymers @xcite ,",
    "the idea is that in a given sample , droplets with neighbouring sizes tend to have a big overlap .",
    "more precisely for the polymer , two excitations of lengths @xmath79 and length @xmath80 with @xmath81 will typically merge and then follow the same path to join the ground state , as shown by the tree structure of optimal paths to all end - points @xcite . as a consequence in @xcite ,",
    "droplets are considered to be independent only if there is a factor of order @xmath82 between their sizes , and this gives a factor @xmath83 in all integrations over droplets @xmath84 a more intuitive view of the @xmath85 factor is to remark that independent excitations stem from a branching process along the ground state path , and that the infinitesimal number of branches between @xmath2 and @xmath86 is precisely @xmath85 .    in summary ,",
    "the droplet theory predicts a power law distribution of independent excitations , with exponent @xmath87 .",
    "note that the absence of any characteristic scale in @xmath2 means that there exists some infinite correlation length in the system in the whole low temperature phase .",
    "this is in contrast with simpler models like the random field ising chain @xcite or in the spin glass chain in external field @xcite , where the density of excitations was found to decay exponentially in @xmath2 , the correlation length being the imry - ma length .",
    "many exact results for directed polymers on the cayley tree have been derived by derrida and spohn @xcite . from the point of view of excitations , the most important result concerns the distribution of the overlap in the thermodynamic limit , which is simply the sum of two delta peaks at @xmath88 and @xmath89 in the whole low temperature phase @xcite : @xmath90 and the distribution of @xmath91 over the samples is the same as in the random energy model @xcite . in particular , the disorder average of eq .",
    "( [ piarbre ] ) is @xcite : @xmath92 i.e. the overlap is zero with probability @xmath93 , and one otherwise .",
    "this means that for a polymer of length @xmath0 , the important excitations are those of length @xmath94 , and that these excitations keep a finite weight in the limit @xmath95 . to understand the origin of this surprising result , fisher and",
    "huse @xcite have computed that the probability to find an excitation of length @xmath2 which branches off at a distance @xmath96 from the root behaves as @xmath97 , i.e. using the length notation @xmath98 @xmath99 finally , tang has studied numerically the overlap distribution @xmath100 for a polymer of finite - size @xmath0 @xcite to characterize how the two delta peaks develop in ( [ overlapcayley ] ) : the data for @xmath101 follow the scaling behavior ( see figs 4(a ) and 4(b ) of @xcite ) @xmath102 where the scaling function @xmath103 present the same singularity with exponent @xmath104 near @xmath105 and @xmath106 @xmath107 so that , in the limit @xmath95 , @xmath108 only contains two @xmath109 peaks at @xmath88 and @xmath89 ( see eq .",
