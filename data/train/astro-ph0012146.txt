    "the past few years have been a watershed in our ability to directly observe galaxy evolution .",
    "deep field surveys such as the canada - france redshift survey ( cfrs  lilly 1995 ) and color - selected field samples such as that of steidel ( 1996 , 1999 ) have provided critical information on the evolution of field galaxies .",
    "madau ( 1996 ) integrated the results at @xmath8 into a coherent picture of the star formation history of the universe , suggesting that the global star formation rate peaked between @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "since then , recognition of the importance of both dust and cosmic variance has changed the steep decline in the cosmic star formation rate inferred at @xmath11 into a flat plateau for @xmath12 ( steidel 1999 ) .",
    "cowie ( 1999 ) also show a more gradual rise at @xmath13 than initially inferred by the cfrs .",
    "there remain four substantial caveats regarding these findings .",
    "first , the number of spectroscopically measured redshifts between @xmath14 and @xmath10 is small .",
    "second , since the uv dropout technique used to identify the @xmath15 population requires them to be uv bright , it is possible that a substantial amount of star - forming activity in dusty systems has been overlooked .",
    "third , redshift surveys from which cosmic star formation rates are measured must be of sufficient depth and wavelength coverage that star formation indicators ( , @xmath16(2800  ) ) can be measured with limited extrapolation over wide redshift intervals . finally , small area surveys , such as the hdf , are vulnerable to perturbations from large scale structure .",
    "infrared - selected surveys provide a powerful tool for addressing these issues ( see dickinson , these proceedings ) . among the benefits , infrared @xmath17-corrections are small and relatively independent of galaxy type , age , and redshift . since the long - wavelength light of galaxies is dominated by lower mass stars rather than short - lived high - mass stars , infrared luminosities track galaxy mass , thereby providing a more direct comparison to theories of galaxy formation without relying on the poorly - understood physics of star formation .",
    "infrared light is also less vulnerable to dust absorption .    on the negative side ,",
    "since spectroscopy is primarily performed at optical wavelengths , infrared - selected samples are challenging to follow - up .",
    "also , since evolved stars become important contributors to the long - wavelength flux of a galaxy , poorly - understood phases of stellar evolution can make interpretation of broad - band colors ambiguous ( spinrad 1997 ) . finally , since infrared - surveys do not select for young stars , they are suboptimal for studying the cosmic star - formation history , though they provide a natural basis for studying the mass - aggregation history .",
    "we present the spices survey ( eisenhardt 2001 , in prep . ) , a deep @xmath2 imaging and spectroscopic survey covering over 100 arcmin@xmath1 spread over four fields .",
    "table  [ tab1 ] lists the vega magnitude 3@xmath18 depths in 3  diameter apertures for the imaging .",
    "the relatively large area mitigates the effects of large - scale structure while the @xmath19-band depth is more than sufficient to detect @xmath20 galaxies to @xmath21 .",
    "the area and depth are a significant improvement over several recent surveys ( cowie 1996 ) , but are modest compared to several programs currently in production mode ( cimatti , these proceedings ; mccarthy , these proceedings ) .",
    "an important strength of spices is the spectroscopic program : we currently have 626 spectroscopic redshifts of @xmath22 sources selected from the sample , approximately one - third of the complete @xmath22 sample ( see figure  1 ) .",
    "these spectroscopic redshifts are being used to directly construct an eigenbasis of galaxy spectral energy distributions with which to determine photometric redshifts for the complete sample ( see budavari 2000 ) .",
    "wu ( these proceedings ) discusses _ hst _ imaging of one of the spices fields .",
    "here we discuss two initial results from the survey .",
    ".depth of spices imaging ( vega magnitudes ) [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ tab1 ]    extremely red objects ( ero s ) are an intriguing class of extragalactic object , likely associated with @xmath23 galaxies ( cimatti , these proceedings ) . we find that the surface density of these sources is elevated in the spices fields relative to some of the surface densities reported previously in the literature .",
    "for @xmath24 , we find a surface density of 1.4 ero s arcmin@xmath25 , with a range in this value of 1.3 to 1.9 across the four fields .",
    "for the same magnitude range and color criterion , barger ( 2000 ) find a surface density of @xmath26 ero s arcmin@xmath25 over a field of view of 61.8 arcmin@xmath1 while mccracken ( 2000 ) find a surface density of ero s in the herschel deep field of @xmath27 arcmin@xmath25 over a 47.2 arcmin@xmath1 field .",
    "similarly , if we consider ero s defined as @xmath28 sources with @xmath29 , the spices fields have 0.13 ero s arcmin@xmath25 with a range of @xmath30 ero s arcmin@xmath25 across the four fields . using the same definition , the cadis survey finds @xmath31 ero s arcmin@xmath25 across a 154 arcmin@xmath1 field ( thompson 1999 ) while daddi ( 2000 ) find 0.07 ero s arcmin@xmath25 across a 447.5 arcmin@xmath1 field with strong clustering reported .    what is the source of this discrepancy ?",
    "one possibility is that the depth and area of the spices imaging are significantly improved over many of the surveys mentioned above : @xmath32 is a 10@xmath18 detection in the spices survey .",
    "another possibility is large scale structure .",
    "though the spices fields cover @xmath33 arcmin@xmath1 , larger than several of the above surveys , fluctuations in the ero surface density on these scales have been reported by more recent larger area deep infrared surveys ( daddi 2000 ; cimatti , these proceedings ; mccarthy , these proceedings ) .",
    "indeed , one of the spices fields ( the lynx field : @xmath34 ) has a higher surface density of red objects than the other three fields .",
    "keck / lris spectroscopy and has subsequently identified many of these red sources with galaxies in two x - ray emitting clusters at @xmath35 ( stanford 1997 ; rosati 1998 ) .",
    "the @xmath19-band luminosity function ( klf ) at @xmath9 offers a powerful constraint on theories of galaxy formation .",
    "since the @xmath19-band light tracks mass better than ultraviolet / optical light , the klf is more directly comparable to theories of the collapse and merging of galaxies .",
    "kauffmann & charlot ( kc98 ; 1998 ) show that pure luminosity evolution ( ple ) models , models in which galaxies collapse monolithically at high redshift with little subsequent merging activity , predict that many massive galaxies exist at @xmath9 : @xmath36% of an infrared - selected field galaxy sample with @xmath37 should be at @xmath7 .",
    "alternatively , their hierarchical model predicts only @xmath38% of @xmath37 field galaxies should be at @xmath7 . ignoring the spices field with the @xmath35 clusters and another field with very limited spectroscopy",
    ", we conservatively find that @xmath39% of @xmath37 spices sources are at @xmath7 .",
    "this assumes that @xmath40% of @xmath28 , @xmath41 ( red ) sources are at @xmath7 , as our spectroscopic program shows thus far , and we only count those @xmath37 , @xmath42 ( blue ) sources already spectroscopically confirmed to be at @xmath7",
    ". early photometric redshift analysis on these fields suggests a value @xmath3% of the @xmath37 being at @xmath7 .",
    "these numbers show that neither ple nor the kc98 hierarchical model correctly predicts the @xmath43 klf , implying that substantial merging occurs at @xmath7 .",
    "the identification of two clusters at @xmath35 and one cluster at @xmath45 in the lynx spices fields has led to a deep , 190  ksec _ chandra _ map of the field .",
    "analysis of the diffuse high- and low - redshift cluster x - ray emission are discussed in stanford ( 2001 , submitted ) and holden ( 2001 , in prep . ) , respectively . stern ( 2001 , in prep . ) discusses x - ray background ( xrb ) results from this data set .",
    "we confirm results of recently published _",
    "chandra _ studies ( giacconi 2001 ) : most of the @xmath46 kev xrb is resolved into discrete sources ; the fainter soft - band sources have harder x - ray spectra , providing a coherent solution to the long - standing ` spectral paradox ' ; and @xmath47% of the sources have optical / near - infrared identifications in deep ground - based imaging .",
    "a preliminary spectroscopic program shows a mix of obvious agn , apparently normal galaxies , and , perhaps surprisingly , several x - ray emitting stars , some with hard x - ray spectra .",
    "we are also targeting the spices fields with very deep imaging in @xmath48 to identify high - redshift sources using the lyman break technique .",
    "this work has led to the discovery of a faint quasar at @xmath49 ( stern 2000 ) and several high - redshift galaxies out to @xmath50 .",
    "strong emission - line galaxies have also been identified serendipitously during the spices spectroscopic campaign , the highest redshift source being a likely @xmath51 ly@xmath52 emitter with @xmath53 erg cm@xmath25 s@xmath55 .",
    "we present first results from the spices survey , an infrared - selected photometric and spectroscopic survey .",
    "we find an elevated surface density of ero s compared to several recent deep , infrared surveys , likely due to fluctuations in that quantity from large scale structure at moderate redshifts .",
    "perhaps relatedly , we also find a large fraction of infrared - bright ( @xmath28 ) galaxies residing at @xmath7 . a good measure of this quantity provides a powerful constraint on models of galaxy formation .",
