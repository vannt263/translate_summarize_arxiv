    "weak gravitational lensing refers to small but coherent shape distortions ( cosmic shear ) of background galaxies caused by gravity .",
    "it provides a direct way of probing the cosmic structures on large scales @xcite .",
    "a number of ongoing galaxy surveys are focusing on the measurement of weak lensing statistics with a large ensemble of galaxy images , for the purpose of better understanding the cosmic evolution history and the nature of dark matter and dark energy ( e.g. , des , hsc , kids , lsst , wfirst ) .    currently , a great deal of efforts in the field of weak lensing are on constructing unbiased cosmic shear estimators .",
    "this is challenging due to a number of facts involved in the image formation process of modern ccd cameras , including the point spread function ( psf ) , the pixelation effect , the photon noise , etc .. many different algorithms have been proposed , tested in recent open tests , and used on real galaxy data @xcite . at this stage , it is timely to raise a related question : what is the best way of taking the ensemble average of the shear estimators , or their products ( for shear - shear correlation ) ?    cosmic shear is typically estimated with galaxy ellipticities .",
    "it is known that when the ensemble average of shear estimators is taken , the statistical uncertainty on the shear signal can be suppressed if larger ellipticities are weighted less , as they contribute larger shape noises than average .",
    "@xcite ( bj02 hereafter ) shows that a weighting scheme based on the probability - distribution - function ( pdf ) of the galaxy ellipticities can be used to achieve optimal statistical uncertainty , or the cramr - rao bound ( called c - r bound hereafter ) , given that the shear response function is properly calculated and multiplied on the ensemble average .",
    "nevertheless , a successful application of the bj02 idea relies on accurate measurement of galaxy ellipticities , which is unfortunately difficult in practice .",
    "for example , ellipticities estimated in the model - fitting methods generally contain biases due to noise and underfitting of galaxy morphologies @xcite .",
    "zhang et al.(2015 ) ( zlf15 hereafter ) proposes an alternative form of shear estimators using the multipole moments of the galaxy power spectrum .",
    "the new method does not make assumptions on the morphologies of the galaxy or the psf , therefore does not have the underfitting problem .",
    "the contribution of background noise to the shear estimator can be removed statistically using a neighboring noise image , and the poisson noise contribution can also be removed directly in fourier space .",
    "these features motivate us to understand how to approach the c - r bound with the zlf15 shear estimators .    instead of taking a weighted sum , we find that one can recover the shear signal by symmetrizing the pdf of the zlf15 shear estimators , or the joint pdf of the shear estimator pairs for measuring shear - shear correlations .",
    "it turns out that the new method allows us to approach the c - r bound without incuring systematic errors .",
    "this is realized under very general observational conditions , and without prior knowledge of the pdf . in  [ mle ]",
    ", we introduce the c - r bound , and a way of realizing it through nulling of the pdf asymmetry . ",
    "[ realizing_mle_estimator ] shows how to apply the pdf symmetrization method on shear estimators of zlf15 , thereby to approach the c - r bound in shear statistics , including the recovery of constant shear and shear - shear correlation .",
    "numerical examples / proves are shown in ",
    "[ numerical ] using mock galaxies of very general conditions .",
    "we conclude and discuss the application of this new method in  [ summary ] .",
    "for simplicity , let us consider @xmath0 random numbers @xmath1 ( @xmath2 ) with an intrinsically symmetric pdf denoted as @xmath3 . each random number is shifted by a small amount @xmath4 .",
    "note that this situation is very similar to the case of shear estimator : @xmath1 is analogous to the galaxy ellipticity , and @xmath5 can be regarded as the cosmic shear signal . according to the maximum likelihood estimation , an estimator @xmath6 of @xmath5 is given by : @xmath7 the c - r bound for the variance of @xmath6 is then given by : @xmath8 as a result , eq.([mle_ave ] ) yields an estimate of @xmath5 as : @xmath9}\\ ] ] it is straightforward to show that eq.([mle_ave3 ] ) is unbiased .",
    "meanwhile , the c - r bound for the variance can be derived from eq.([mle_error ] ) as : @xmath10 note that here and in the rest of the paper , to simplify the notation , an integration symbol without the lower and upper limits refers to integration from negative infinity to positive infinity .",
    "the numerator in eq.([mle_ave3 ] ) can be regarded as a weighted sum of the data @xmath1 with the weighting function given by @xmath11^{-1}$ ] , and the denominator as the sum of the weighting function multiplied by a correction factor ( or response function ) , similar to the discussion in bj02 .",
    "however , to reach the optimal statistical uncertainty given in eq.([mle_error2 ] ) and an unbiased estimate of the signal @xmath5 simultaneously , it requires an accurate knowledge of the pdf of the data @xmath1 , which is difficult if the amount of data is not large enough .",
    "more importantly , if one thinks of @xmath1 as the galaxy ellipticity plus some additional measurement errors , eq.([mle_ave3 ] ) becomes a biased estimator of @xmath5 even when the measurement error has zero mean .",
    "due to the nonlinearity of eq.([mle_ave3 ] ) , the correction of such a bias must be complicated .",
    "it is therefore interesting to ask if there is a way to approach the c - r bound with less stringent requirements .      in the example of  [ example ] , @xmath5 causes asymmetric distribution of the measured values of @xmath1 with respect to zero .",
    "this fact suggests that one can estimate @xmath5 by asking how much we shall shift each @xmath1 to symmetrize the pdf of the data . to be more specific , let us set up bins for the data that are symmetrically placed around zero .",
    "we define @xmath12 and @xmath13 as the two boundaries of the @xmath14 bin . for convenience ,",
    "we let half of the bin indices to take negative values , with @xmath15 for @xmath16 , and @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the bin size , and @xmath19 is the total bin number . assuming the shifted amount is @xmath6 , the number of data @xmath20 that fall to the @xmath14 bin on the right side of @xmath21 is defined as : @xmath22 where we have used the heaviside step function @xmath23 , and the subindex @xmath24 covers all data i d s . the bins of negative indices satisfy : @xmath25 note that to avoid confusion , we explicitly write out the formulae for bins of positive and negative indices respectively .    to estimate the value of @xmath6 that can maximally symmetrize the distribution of @xmath20 with respect to zero , we form the @xmath26 as follows : @xmath27 where we assume that the fluctuation of @xmath28 obeys poisson statistics , so that @xmath29 .",
    "@xmath6 is estimated by minimizing @xmath26 .",
    "let us now show that such an estimator is unbiased . for this purpose , we assume that the number of measurements is large , so that @xmath28 and @xmath30 can be written as integrations ( @xmath31 ) : @xmath32 where @xmath33 , @xmath34 is the total number of data points , and @xmath3 is the original ( symmetric ) pdf of @xmath35 when @xmath36 . with taylor expansion , and",
    "keep terms up to the second order in @xmath37 , we get : @xmath38\\delta g\\\\ \\nonumber & + & \\frac{1}{2}\\left[p'(u_j)-p'(u_{j-1})\\right]\\delta g^2\\\\ \\nonumber \\frac{n_{-j}}{n_t}&=&\\int_{u_{-j}}^{u_{-j+1}}dx p(x)+\\left[p(u_{-j+1})-p(u_{-j})\\right]\\delta g\\\\ \\nonumber & + & \\frac{1}{2}\\left[p'(u_{-j+1})-p'(u_{-j})\\right]\\delta g^2\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] since @xmath3 is a symmetric function , we must have @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",

    "@xmath26 can be rewritten as : @xmath44 where @xmath45 ^ 2}{n_j+n_{-j}}\\ ] ] in the limit of small bin size @xmath18 , we have @xmath46 , therefore , @xmath47 ^ 2}{p(u_j)\\delta}\\approx\\int dx\\frac{p'(x)^2}{p(x)}\\ ] ] which recovers",
    "the c - r bound given in eq.([mle_error2 ] ) in the limit of small bin size .",
    "the above calculation shows that one can approach the c - r bound by symmetrizing the pdf of the data .",
    "it only requires binning the data symmetrically with respect to zero , and a reasonably large bin number .    as examples",
    ", we consider three different types of pdf : @xmath48 the c - r bounds ( labelled as cr ) and the variances @xmath49 using the direct averaging method ( labelled as ave ) can be worked out for the three cases respectively as : @xmath50    to test the pdf symmetrization method ( called pdf - sym hereafter ) , we set the signal @xmath51 , and use @xmath52 data points to recover the signal in each example .",
    "the results are shown in table [ result_test ] .",
    "note that the number in the parentheses at the end of each result refers to the statistical error on the last digit .",
    "we use this format for the notation of statistical uncertainty all through this paper .",
    "the corresponding variances @xmath53 in the two methods are listed in table [ sigma_test ] .",
    "the results in the tables agree with our theoretical expectations .",
    "pdf - sym can indeed make the statistical uncertainty approach the c - r bound when the bin number is large . in practice , @xmath54 bins are usually good enough for the purpose , unless the pdf has a number of nonmonotonic features .",
    "the figure shows that even @xmath55 bins can be used in pdf - sym .",
    "this is useful when the number of data points is small ( @xmath56 ) .",
    "note that in making the bins , one should guarantee that each bin to have more than roughly @xmath57 samples , so that @xmath26 has a smooth dependence on the assumed value of the signal @xmath6 , leading to a reliable determination of the @xmath26 minimum and the uncertainty of the recovered signal .",
    "the boundaries between the bins can be determined by sorting the samples according to their absolute values , and making the sample number in each bin on the positive side of zero roughly the same .",
    "the bins on the negative side are then symmetrically set up .",
    "it is interesting to note that when the pdf has a singular behavior at the origin , such as @xmath58 defined in eq.([ps ] ) , the c - r bound approaches zero .",
    "the results in table [ result_test ] & [ sigma_test ] confirm this fact . indeed , according to eq.([mle_error2 ] ) , this phenomenon can occur whenever the intrinsic pdf contain sharp peaks , located either at zero , or symmetrically at the two sides of zero .",
    "this phenomenon has been previously mentioned in bj02 .",
    "it is a very useful feature in signal recovery .",
    "as shown next , the pdf symmetrization procedure allows us to approach the c - r bound in shear measurement with shear estimators defined in zlf15 .",
    "the abovementioned advantages of the new method can be achieved under very general observational conditions .    [",

    "weak lensing statistics , such as mean shear or shear - shear correlation , are typically evaluated as the weighted sum of the shear estimators or their products .",
    "traditionally , galaxy ellipticities are used as shear estimators .",
    "as discussed in bj02 , the weighting factor can be designed as a function of the galaxy ellipticities , so that the resulting statistical error can approach the cramr - rao bound .",
    "this weighting scheme is however hard to realize in practice given the presence of noise and bias in the measurement of galaxy ellipticities and their pdf .",
    "based on the shear estimators of zlf15 , we propose to evaluate shear statistics by symmetrizing the pdf of the shear estimator or the joint pdf of shear estimator pairs ( for shear - shear correlation ) .",
    "we find that this is a way to approach the c - r bound without introducing systematic errors , as shown analytically in  [ realizing_mle_estimator ] .    in  [ numerical ] , we test shear recovery accuracy with large ensembles of galaxies or galaxy pairs ( for the measurement of shear - shear correlation ) .",
    "we find that _ both direct averaging and pdf symmetrization can recover shear or shear - shear correlation accurately in the presence of noise and stars that are misidentified as galaxies _ , proving the robustness of both methods in practice .",
    "note that the allowance of stars in the galaxy ensemble is a quite unusual and useful feature of the zlf15 shear estimators .",
    "it is mostly due to the linearity of the shear estimator form .    in our numerical experiment ,",
    "we use two different types of mock galaxies : 1 .",
    "rw galaxies that are made of point sources connected by 2d random walks ; 2 .",
    "ring galaxies that are made of point sources evenly distributed on a circle , and projected to the plane of the sky with random angles . with the method of pdf - sym",
    ", we find that on average , every ring galaxy contains much more shear information than each rw galaxy .",
    "this is consistent with the theoretical expectation regarding the c - r bound , and agrees with bj02 , who concerns thin - disk galaxies that are similar to our ring galaxies .",
    "the advantage of ring galaxies in shear recovery can not be easily exploited in direct averaging of the shear estimators . when these two types of galaxies are mixed in an ensemble , we find that pdf - sym can maximally utilize the shape information in all galaxies , typically generating a much smaller statistical uncertainty than that by direct averaging .",
    "this fact is again consistent with the theory regarding the c - r bound .",
    "it is interesting to note that pdf - sym allows us to approach the c - r bound in shear measurements without prior knowledge of the pdf form of the shear estimator .",
    "this is because of the monotonic dependence of the shear estimator on its corresponding shear component in the weak shear / convergence limit , implying that restoring the pdf is equivalent to symmetrizing the pdf .",
    "this fact has been proven useful for recovering the 1-point and 2-point shear statistics .",
    "similar ideas may be developed for the measurement of n - point shear statistics in a future work .",
    "it is straightforward to apply the new method in several areas of weak lensing to optimize the statistical uncertainty of the results , including : 1 .",
    "shear - shear correlation measurement binned in both angular separation and redshift ; 2 . galaxy - shear cross correlation at a fixed 3d relative position ; 3 . testing shear recovery accuracy .",
    "the results of these measurements all correspond to explicit theoretical expectation values , therefore are easy to interpret . in measuring shear - shear correlation ( , for a survey of size larger than or comparable to cfhtlens @xcite ) , we find that there are typically a large number of galaxy pairs for a given angular separation and two redshift bins , making the pdf - sym method an ideal tool to use .",
    "note that when the number of galaxy pairs is too large , it is better to take the average of the shear estimators in each spatial bin first , and then measure the shear correlation with bin pairs of given spatial separations . we will report the application of the new method on the cfhtlens galaxy images in separate papers galaxies /@xmath59 ) for pdf - sym to use more than 2 bins in shear recovery within the grid ( , table [ result_ring ] ) ] .",
    "if the source galaxies in the ensemble cover a broad redshift range , , in the recovery of 2d shear map , or in the measurement of 2d shear - shear correlation , using pdf - sym becomes more complicated .",
    "indeed , in this case , the pdf of the shear estimators can not be symmetrized at all in principle , though we can still use the @xmath26 formalism developed in  [ const_shear ] &  [ correlation ] , which would result in a weighted sum of the shear signal or the shear - shear correlation within the redshift range .",
    "the weighting function can be calculated , though it requires the pdf of the shear estimator as a function of redshift .",
    "appendix d shows a derivation of the weighting function for shear recovery .",
    "this problem will be studied more carefully in a future work .",
    "overall , the performance of pdf - sym depends on the pdf form / galaxy type , distribution of galaxy snr , and other image distortion effects @xcite .",
    "we have only examined a few cases .",
    "more work will be done to quantify the improvement with real observational data .",
