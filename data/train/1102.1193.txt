    "in recent papers @xcite-@xcite@xcite-@xcite , ferrara , levy and duff et al . established a correspondence between extremal black holes and qubit and qutrit entanglement .",
    "such a correspondence stems from duff s observation that the entropy of an extremal black hole in the four - dimensional @xmath1 stu model and the measure of three - qubit entanglement are both given by cayley s hyperdeterminant @xcite .",
    "later work was motivated by studies of bps black holes in a class of @xmath1 supergravities whose scalar fields lie on a symmetric space @xcite-@xcite , called magic supergravities @xcite-@xcite . it was shown that extremal black holes in @xmath5 magic supergravities can be described by jordan algebras and their corresponding freudenthal triple systems , with the bekenstein - hawking entropy of the black holes given by algebraic invariants @xcite . in @xmath6 , the quartic invariant was shown to be proportional to cayley s hyperdeterminant @xcite and used to describe three - qubit entanglement , yielding a novel derivation of the three - qubit entanglement classes @xcite .",
    "subsequent work led to the description of stu black holes in terms of four qubits @xcite and a rigorous classification of four qubit entanglement based on @xmath7 black hole u - duality orbits @xcite .    in @xcite ,",
    "borsten et al . proposed the identification of elements of jordan algebras of degree two and three with @xmath8 and @xmath9 reduced density matrices for two qubits and qutrits , in quantum mechanics defined over arbitrary division algebras . here , we also make use of the jordan formulation of quantum mechanics , but give a different interpretation for elements of jordan algebras over composition algebras , which include division algebras as well as their split forms .",
    "given that 1/2-bps black hole charge vectors in @xmath10 , @xmath0 and @xmath1 magic supergravities are rank one elements of jordan algebras of degree two and three @xcite , it is possible to identify 1/2-bps black hole charge vectors with pure qudits ( qubits and qutrits ) over composition algebras .",
    "the unitary and slocc groups of such qudits correspond to the automorphism and reduced structure groups of the corresponding jordan algebras , respectively .",
    "as higher rank jordan elements can always be expressed as orthogonal sums of rank one elements via spectral decomposition @xcite , we identify 1/4 and 1/8-bps black hole charge vectors with observables on orthogonal qudit states .    geometrically , 1/2-bps black hole charge vectors are mapped to points in projective space , while 1/4 and 1/8-bps charge vectors are mapped to projective lines and planes .",
    "the corresponding u - duality groups are isomorphic to the collineation groups of the projective spaces @xcite . in the quantum information context , u - duality transformations are realized by acting on jordan algebra matrices with elements of the reduced structure group @xcite , where such elements are interpreted as qudit slocc gates .",
    "we review @xmath0 and @xmath1 magic supergravities in @xmath10 and give their corresponding jordan algebras , symmetry groups and entropy expressions for black string and hole solutions .",
    "the relevant jordan algebras are of degree two and three and taken over finite dimensional composition algebras . we will first review composition algebras and jordan algebras , particularly those relevant to black hole solutions in supergravity .",

    "it will be seen that the vanishing of the quadratic adjoint map or the @xmath119 invariant are defining conditions for 1/2-bps black hole charge vectors to be interpreted as points in projective space .",
    "in this section , qubits and qutrits over composition algebras will be defined and identified with 1/2-bps black string and hole charge vectors in @xmath10 , @xmath0 and @xmath1 magic supergravities .",
    "a quantum bit or @xmath120 is a state of a quantum system with a two - dimensional representation space @xmath121 .",
    "the basis states of this space are denoted as @xmath122 and @xmath123 and a general state can be written in this basis as : @xmath124 @xmath125 is usually taken to be an element of the hilbert space @xmath126 , where @xmath127 represent the qubit computational basis .",

    "the locc and slocc equivalence groups are equivalent to @xmath134 and @xmath135 @xcite .",
    "+ given a pure qubit , one can assign a rank one density matrix @xmath136 satisfying @xmath137 as @xmath138 is a rank one @xmath139 hermitian idempotent , we have a map from the hilbert space @xmath126 to the space of rank one elements of the jordan algebra @xmath140 .",
    "geometrically , @xmath138 is mapped to a point of the projective line @xmath141 @xcite .",
    "in fact , the mapping of a pure qubit to @xmath141 gives rise to the hopf fibration @xmath142 .",
    "in general , given a pure qubit over a composition divison algebra @xmath143 , the mapping @xmath144 gives rise to all four hopf fibrations @xcite @xmath145 for split composition algebras @xmath146 , there exist analagous mappings @xcite , providing non - compact hopf fibrations which represent maps between hyperboloids in different dimensions with hyperboloid fibers @xmath147 the non - compact hopf fibrations thus describe the geometry of qubit state spaces over split composition algebras . as @xmath148 , it is natural to identify locc groups for pure qubits over composition algebras with the automorphism group of the corresponding jordan algebra of degree two @xmath149 , yielding @xmath150 , @xmath134 , @xmath151 and @xmath152 for composition division algebras @xmath36 , @xmath153 , @xmath154 , @xmath33 @xcite , and @xmath86 , @xmath155 and @xmath156 for split composition algebras @xmath157 , @xmath158 and @xmath34 , respectively @xcite . the relevant slocc groups are then given by the reduced structure groups @xmath93 , giving @xmath98 , @xmath97 , @xmath96 and @xmath95 for composition division algebras @xcite , and @xmath159 , @xmath160 , @xmath94 for split composition algebras .",
    "with a direct correspondence between qubit state spaces and spaces of rank one elements of jordan algebras of degree two , it is seen that six - dimensional 1/2-bps black hole charge vectors transform as qubits over composition algebras .",
    "this allows one to identify 1/2-bps black holes with qubits and also gives a quantum computational interpretation for @xmath2 , @xmath0 and @xmath1 magic supergravitiy u - duality groups .",
    "specifically , u - duality groups consist of those qubit transformations which allow the conversion between states with a non - vanishing probability of success .",
    "this is sensible since , in general , special linear transformations are not isometries of qubit state spaces and not expected to preserve the normalization of pure qubits . however , such transformations do preserve the determinant , hence rank , acting as single qubit slocc gates which map between not necessarily normalized states in projective space .",
    "single qubit gates are typically given by unitary transformations @xcite , but for reversible computation any @xmath139 invertible linear transformation will suffice @xcite .",
    "important unitary single qubit gates include the hadamard gate @xmath161 the pauli - x , y , z gates ( where pauli - x acts as a not gate ) @xmath162 and the phase shift gates @xmath163 some example non - unitary gates @xcite include @xmath164 over any composition algebra @xmath75 , the pauli gates are generalized to the set @xmath165 where @xmath166 or @xmath167 and the phase shift gates become @xmath168 it can be verified that the generalized pauli gates @xmath169 and @xmath170 are generators for @xmath171 , while @xmath172 and @xmath173 .",

    "when the determinant is preserved exactly , one recovers slocc gates in @xmath179.given a black string in @xmath2 , @xmath0 or @xmath1 magic supergravity , its charge vector is an element @xmath175 @xcite with spectral decomposition @xmath180 where @xmath181 are orthonormal rank one idempotents of @xmath182 .",
    "identifying @xmath54 with pure qubit density matrices allows one to interpret a 1/4-bps black string charge vector as a boolean observable on two orthogonal qubit states .",
    "the eigenvalues @xmath183 are those values the observable takes on two coordinate charts of the projective line @xmath184 @xcite .",
    "the group of qubit slocc transformations @xmath179 transforms the observable while preserving the black string entropy @xmath185 .",
    "this is consistent with the interpretation of @xmath2 black strings as bound states or intersections of basic constituent @xmath186-branes of charge @xmath187 , for which the area law for the entropy yields @xmath188 @xcite . these configurations preserve 1/4 of the supersymmetry and in @xmath0 supergravity can arise from two orthogonally intersecting m - branes in @xmath189 @xcite .      a quantum trit or @xmath190 is a state of a quantum system with a three - dimensional representation space .",

    ", this is leads to a successful construction of the projective plane @xmath202 ( cayley - moufang plane ) @xcite , for which the standard construction using only equivalence classes of elements of @xmath199 fails .",
    "the failure of the standard construction is due to the identification @xmath203 requiring associativity to be an equivalence relation @xcite .",
