    "in modern agronomy , the recent progress of sensors provides a lot of data , among them many temporal data .",
    "this opens new challenges , such as the proper calibration of these sensors , and the use of temporal data to establish relationships with product characteristics and quality .",
    "these relationships are not easy to determine because of the high variability of biological material .",
    "this can be compensated by the integration of expertise , as agronomy is a domain that has always relied as much on experience than on science .",
    "nevertheless , for domain knowledge to be effectively used in collaboration with mathematical models and data , an expertise formalization step is required . our objective in this paper is to show the interest of a formalized data and knowledge - based approach to study a complex agronomical phenomenon , namely the influence of vine water deficit on grape quality .",
    "any index of vine water deficit aims at evaluating the amount of water effectively used by the vine in order to determine if if this amount falls short of some reference amount . typically , the _ reference _ amount is the maximal amount of water a vine can use .",
    "various methods exist to characterize the level of water deficit experienced by the plant as reviewed by @xcite .",
    "tissue water status can be assessed visually or by measurements of vine water potential . however , both methods have serious drawbacks .",
    "the lack of precision of visual observations often leads to yield reduction before visible symptoms occurs .",
    "the pressure chamber method used to measure water potential is slow and labour intensive , especially for predawn measurement , and is unsuitable for automation .",
    "in addition , measurements done with pressure chambers are very dependent on atmospheric conditions and vine phenological stage @xcite .    sap flow sensors , that indirectly measure changes in conductance , have recently become available .",
    "this sensitive measurement method requires a complex instrumentation and technical expertise for the definition of irrigation control thresholds @xcite .",
    "the main advantages of sap flow method is to allow automatic and continuous measurement of water flowing through the plant , which is directly related to transpiration @xcite .",
    "however , sap flow is a complex phenomenon and expert knowledge is necessary to convert raw data into useful transformed data , i.e. water courses , by designing a software sensor .",
    "once these data transformations are validated , it opens the way to a range of new studies , based on vine s water courses .    in this paper",
    ", we will first show how a formalized data and knowledge - based approach can be useful to design a software sensor .",
    "knowledge formalization will be done by using ontologies , which take increasing importance in the field of life sciences @xcite , for their ability to model and structure qualitative domain knowledge .    in a second step",
    ", water use trajectories will be put in relation to grape quality indicators such as berry weight or sugar concentration , using recent data analysis tools and formalized knowledge .",
    "innovative data analysis tools include functional data analysis that offers the possibility to use curve ( functional ) data instead of scalar data .",
    "functional data analysis has not been much used in life sciences yet @xcite , though it could be of particular interest in the vine and wine industry , and more generally for modern agronomy .",
    "the modeling task is divided into two independent parts : software sensor design and temporal data analysis .",
    "if the sensor design procedure were different , this would not affect the validity of the data analysis methodology .",
    "the methodological work is illustrated by a case study , involving an experimental design on several vineyards in the languedoc region ( france ) .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : section [ sec : meth ] presents the material and methods .",
    "it is divided into four parts .",
    "the first part gives some elements about data and the second one presents ontology - based formalization .",
    "the software sensor design , that relies on the use of mathematical models , data and formalized knowledge , is described in the third part .",
    "the selected example shows how it is possible to transform raw sap flow data into vine water deficit courses .",
    "the fourth part describes the methods used for analysing the sofware sensor output in relation to product quality .",
    "section [ sec : resu ] presents and discusses the results and their relationship with grape composition ( sugar concentration , berry weight ) .",
    "some concluding remarks are given in section [ sec : discu ] .",
    "in this section , we propose to follow four steps :    * to describe the experimental design with its input and output variables * to formalize eco - physiological knowledge using an ontology * to design a software sensor using formalised knowledge , a mathematical model , and data * to relate software sensor output to product quality using decision trees and functional analysis .",
    "expert knowledge plays an essential part in the modeling process , and we focus on providing an efficient way to separate the data - based statistical procedures from the qualitative knowledge - based assumptions .    the outline of the approach is given in fig.[fig : kd ] .",
    "experiments feed a data base .",
    "the software sensor integrates data from the data base , an ontology and a mathematical model .",
    "its outputs can be analyzed using data analysis .",
    "this analysis also calls for eco - physiological knowledge , essentially about the phenological stages .",
    "therefore , the ontology is used at two different levels : software sensor design and data analysis supervision .",
    "data analysis is performed on the basis of two complementary perspectives for determining relations between software sensor temporal output and product quality .",
    "the first line of work is to design scalar explanatory variables , by summarizing a period of interest in compliance with the eco - physiological knowledge .",
    "these variables can then be used as input to decision trees .",
    "the second line of work is to use recent advances in functional data analysis , so that the inputs to the statistical model are the temporal data as a whole .    in the following",
    ", the approach is illustrated with a software sensor to estimate vine water courses and their relation to grape quality .",
    "nevertheless , the proposed methodology is generic in many aspects , and could be useful in the development of other decision support tools in agronomy , provided that expertise and temporal data are available .",
    "data used in this paper come from a multi - site experiment located in the south of france .",
    "the same experimental design was set up in seven sites across the languedoc roussillon region in order to test for the effects of vine stress status on grape potential and wine quality in contrasted environmental conditions . in total ,",
    "vine water stress status was followed over 16 vine plots , each planted with one of the following varieties : merlot , cabernet - sauvignon , grenache or chardonnay .    to get a wider range of vine water statuses during the season ,",
    "an irrigation treatment was applied for two years on each of the eight site - variety combinations . the irrigation treatment consisted of two modalities , replicated twice , yielding 32 experimental subplots . in the non irrigated subplots , vines only received natural precipitations during the growing season while in the irrigated subplots , vines received regular extra - amounts of water through drippers line ( emission rate from 2 to 4 @xmath0 , 1 to 2 drippers per plant ) .",
    "several kinds of data , collected according to an experimental design are available : local meteorological data , vine water stress related measurements , phenological state assessments , as well as grape quality analyses .",
    "hourly meteorological data on windspeed ( @xmath1 ) , minimal , maximal and mean air temperature ( @xmath2 ) , air humidity ( % ) , solar radiation ( @xmath3 ) and amounts of precipitations ( @xmath4 ) were extracted from local meteorological stations for each site .",
    "_ transformed data _    hourly vapor pressure deficit ( @xmath5 ) and reference atmospheric evaporative demand ( potential evapotranspiration , @xmath6 ) were calculated according to methodologies referred to as fao-56 @xcite .",
    "calculation of reference atmospheric evaporative demand ( @xmath6 in @xmath7 ) is based on penman - monteith formula .",
    "daily meteorological data were obtained from hourly data after a trapeze integration .",
    "thermal time , _",
    "i.e. _ the accumulation of growing degree days ( gdd ) from april 1@xmath8 was calculated by daily integration of mean air temperature minus a base temperature of 10 @xmath2 which is considered as the simplest model to estimate vine phenology @xcite .",
    "the main phenological phases ( budbreak , bloom , nouaison , veraison ) were estimated visually in each experimental plot when 50% of the plants reached the stage .",
    "bloom was observed when 50% of the clusters had the cap off .",
    "nouaison was defined using the bloom stage , according to local expert knowledge ( see section [ sec : con]).veraison dates were recorded when 50% of the fruit had turned red .",
    "vine water status was monitored by two kinds of measurements : discrete measurements of leaf water potential at predawn ( @xmath9 , or predawn lwp ) and continuous measurements of sap flow .    _ leaf water potential at predawn _",
    "lwp measurements were conducted every week from the end of june to the end of august with a pressure chamber at predawn ( between @xmath10 3.00 am and @xmath10 5.00 am ) .    _ sap flow",
    "_    the energy balance method ( sakuratani , 1981 ) was used to measure sap flow with sap ip system ( dynamax , houston , tx , usa ) .",
    "there is one variety per vineyard site .",
    "the vineyard site is divided into 2 irrigation treatments .",
    "two vineyard rows were selected .",
    "one row represents one irrigation treatment . in each",
    "selected row , 2 vines were equipped with one sensor . each sensor measured vine sap flow rate every 15 minutes .",
    "the 2 selected vines were within 25 meters of each other within the same row .",
    "sap flow rates measured on each vine were averaged on an hourly basis within each row .",
    "total sap flow of each vine was calculated as the product of sap flux density and cross sectional sap wood area at the point of measurement .",
    "various expert methods were applied to filter out nighttime , weak and erroneous signals .",
    "sap flow measurements were scaled at the plant level according to plant leaf area estimates corresponding to each sensor .",
    "the daily sap flow assumed to measure daily vine transpiration was computed by adding all hourly sap flow rates measured during the day .",
    "the volumetric flux per vine ( @xmath11 ) was converted into @xmath12 taking into account the respective area of ground per vine .",
    "daily vine transpiration will be noted @xmath13 .",
    "starting two weeks before harvest , fruit was sampled for each irrigation treatment in each vineyard .",
    "fruit data was collected at three different dates .",
    "fruit composition analysis focused on berry weight ( @xmath14 ) , sugar concentration ( @xmath15 ) , acidity ( @xmath14h2so4@xmath16 ) , anthocyanes and assimilable nitrogen ( @xmath17 ) .      in this section ,",
    "our aim is to show how ontologies can be used to formalize domain knowledge and to design a software sensor .    in information science",
    ", an ontology formally represents knowledge as a set of concepts within a domain , and the relationships between pairs of concepts .",
    "ontologies are becoming increasingly popular , due to the great amount of available ( complex ) data and to the need for modeling ( qualitative ) knowledge and structural information .",
    "this need first arose out of the development of the world wide web .",
    "however , there are still very few attempts to combine ontologies and statistical or data - driven models",
    ". this could be particularly useful in life sciences and agronomy @xcite .",
    "the main incentives for using ontologies @xcite are the following ones :    1 .   to share a common understanding of structured information @xcite ; 2 .",
    "to explicit the specificities of domain knowledge ; 3 .   to identify ambiguous or inappropriate model choices .    for the present work ,",
    "a specfic ontology has been built , in order to formalize the concepts and relations required to design a vine water deficit indicator and to analyze its impact on grape quality .",

    "abscissa are in gdd .",
    "the values of @xmath91 and @xmath92 have been found by cross - validation . ]",
    "peaks ( 1 ) and ( 3 ) are positive , which implies a rise in sugar concentration . during these periods ,",
    "the stronger the @xmath48 value , the higher the rise .",
    "as @xmath48 varies inversely with water stress , it means that the lower the water stress during these periods , the higher the rise in sugar concentration .",
    "the effect is twice as strong for the peak ( 1 ) than for the peak ( 3 ) .",
    "regarding the time period , peak ( 1 ) appears to be located before pre - veraison whereas peak ( 3 ) occurred during pre - veraison .",
    "by contrast , peak ( 2 ) has a negative effect on sugar concentration . during this period located just before pre - veraison",
    ", a low water stress decreases the sugar concentration .",
    "this can be reformulated as follows : the higher the stress during that period , the lower the decrease in sugar concentration .",
    "the work presented in this paper used formalized knowledge and mathematical models to design a software sensor from raw data and relate its temporal output to product quality .",
    "the proposed approach has been applied to the case of a vine water stress indicator , and its relation to two grape quality variables : berry weight and sugar concentration .",
    "results provide a number of meaningful insights .",
    "first of all , the software sensor key point , which is the determination of @xmath81 , seems reasonably consistent with the literature . from an agronomical point of view , this allows to effectively work at plot scale , and to offer decision support for irrigation , as a function of each plot characteristics .",
    "the use of an ontology allows to separate expert knowledge and numerical models .",
    "it makes it much easier to build a generic model , that is both evolutive and adaptable over time as knowledge progresses or climate changes .",
    "contrary to a data base , an ontology schema adds semantics to the data structure , allowing automatic reasoning , using logical properties , such as reflexivity or transivity .",
    "the ontology presented here has a moderate complexity level : only four kinds of primary concepts , and five types of relations .",
    "this is still sufficient to express many mathematical conditions and dependencies , going well beyond the scope of the present case study .",
    "there may however be cases where new concepts and relations are necessary , and the ontology can easily be enriched when needed .",
    "second , the two - fold proposal for data analysis appears to be a good means of exploiting such temporal data as provided by the water stress indicator @xmath47 .",
    "the results show that the water stress has an effect on grape quality .",
    "the analysis confirmed known results on the vine physiological response according to the variety and the irrigation effect .",
    "thus our results are comforting the validity of the @xmath48 indicator , and therefore the level of confidence and reliability in the software sensor design procedure .",
    "functional data analysis highlighted critical periods for vine and berry development , regarding final quality features .",
    "on one hand , the knowledge - based extraction of meaningful summary features over phenological periods of interest allowed to feed these features as input to decision trees .",
    "this confirmed the primordial effect played by the variety on berry weight determination . on the other hand ,",
    "functional data analysis made it possible to use the water stress curve ( @xmath47 ) , as a whole , to explain sugar concentration .",
    "this allows more precise monitoring of vine water needs according to a targeted product .",
    "note that we did not take account of the variety factor in functional data analysis .",
    "this would require a covariance analysis model adapted to functional data , which was not possible in this study as the number of data per variety is not sufficient .",
    "these results show the complementarity of both approaches : the first one performs dimensional reduction by summarizing features which requires expert assumptions , the second one handles the continuous temporal data , without any reduction , but it needs more numerous data to be efficient",
    ".    applied perspectives of this work include the study of the relationship between vine water stress and other more complex quality features .",
    "in particular new chemical analyses make it possible to follow the aroma development in berries over time , which is assumed to be very sensitive to the grape water status .",
    "our approach is innovative in more than one aspect .",
    "even if the software sensor had a different design , the same advanced methodology could still be applied to analyze the temporal data . beyond the present case study",
    ", the proposed methodology has a high genericity level , for the applied fields of agronomy and environment .",
    "it could be used in many cases when raw data have to be transformed by software sensors to be meaningful , or when temporal data have to be analyzed in depth .",
    "the research leading to these results has received funding from the pilotype program , funded by oseo innovation and the languedoc roussillon regional council .",
