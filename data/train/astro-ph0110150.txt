    "there are essentially three distinct star formation mechanisms that include most of the observations : gravitational instabilities leading to dense clouds and then stars by fragmentation , sequential triggering of dense clouds by other stars , and turbulent triggering of dense clouds by supersonic compression in a turbulent flow .",
    "these processes operate in the main disks of galaxies .",
    "we consider here whether they also operate in the inner kpc regions where the conditions are sufficiently different that the proportion of the three may change .",
    "gravitational instabilities in the main disks of galaxies produce structures on kpc scales , including flocculent and grand - design spiral arms , and regularly spaced star - forming regions and other giant cloud complexes inside spiral arms ( e.g. , m51 : kuno et al . 1995 ) .",
    "secondary gravitational instabilities may occur on smaller scales in the cooled and colliding parts of these primary instabilities ( e.g. , wada & norman 1999 , 2001 ) .",
    "nuclear disks have similar structures .",
    "some galaxies have nuclear grand design spiral arms ( e.g. , d15 in coma ",
    "caldwell , rose , & dendy 1999 ; ngc 5248  laine et al . 1999 ) and others have long irregular arms that resemble multiple - arm density waves in main disks ( e.g. , ngc 7469 and viizw031 observed by scoville et al .",
    "massive patches of star formation can form in either of these arms .",
    "nuclear regions can also have rings with regularly spaced star formation , as in eso 565 - 11 ( buta , crocker & byrd 1999 ) .",
    "the spatial scales for nuclear spirals and star formation are much smaller than they are in main galaxy disks . in nuclear regions",
    ", spirals can be only several hundred pc long and tens of pc wide ; even the largest star - forming regions are only several tens of pc in size .",
    "the smaller sizes in nuclear regions are the result of a smaller jeans length , which comes from a higher ambient density without a significantly higher velocity dispersion .",
    "gravitational instabilities are also clearly present in some larger starbursts involving whole galaxy disks .",
    "ngc 6090 is a merger system ( mazzarella & boroson 1993 ) with a molecular surface density of @xmath0 m@xmath1 pc@xmath2 that peaks in a region between the two nuclei ( bryant & scoville 1999 ) .",
    "color maps of this system in dinshaw et al .",
    "( 1999 ) show four equally - spaced knots of star formation along an arc with a length of several kpc .",
    "these knots are like the beads in normal spirals arms , but in ngc 6090 , they are much denser .",
    "ngc 253 also has an enormous cluster in the central region with several thousand o - type stars and an age comparable to 1 my ( watson et al .",
    "ngc 5253 has a similar dense cluster near the center ( turner , beck , & ho 2000 ) .",
    "these giant clusters do not appear to be simple extrapolations of a smooth cluster mass function because there is nothing else like them in the galaxies .",
    "they are also not near obvious pressure sources or shells as if they were sequentially triggered , nor are they part of a fractal hierarchy of structures as might result from turbulence .",
    "they appear to be isolated cases of gravitational collapse to single giant clusters .",
    "many of the clusters in the solar neighborhood have been triggered by external pressures from existing hii regions and stellar winds .",
    "reviews of this process are in elmegreen ( 1998 ) and elmegreen et al .",
    "examples in the recent literature include the rosette nebula ( phelps & lada 1997 ) , orion nebula ( bally et al .",
    "1987 ; lada et al . 1991 ; dutrey , et al . 1991 ; reipurth , rodriguez & chini 1999 ) , trifid nebula ( lefloch & cernicharo 2000 ) , rho ophiuchus ( de geus 1992 ) , upper sco ob association ( preibisch & zinnecker 1999 ) , and w5 ( kerton & martin 2000 ) .",
    "occasionally a supernova remnant is seen to have triggered star formation along the periphery .",
    "this should be rare because supernova remnants are usually short - lived compared to the triggering time .",
    "g349.7 + 0.2 seems to be an example ( reynoso & mangum 2000 ) .",
    "other shells have triggered star formation ( xie & goldsmith 1994 ; yamaguchi et al .",
    "2001 ) , but they are older than single supernova remnants and were probably formed by a combination of supernova and stellar wind pressures ( mccray & kafatos 1987 ) .",
    "giant shells in other galaxies have triggered star formation too ( brinks & bajaja 1986 ; puche et al . 1992",
    "; wilcots & miller 1998 ; steward et al . 2000 ; stewart & walter 2000 ) .",
    "ic 2574 ( walter & brinks 1999 ; steward & walter 2000 ) has hii regions on the perimeter of a shell with clusters @xmath3 my old and another cluster in the center of the shell that is 11 my old .",
    "there is also evidence for sequential triggering in starburst regions , like 30 dor ( walborn et al .",
    "1999 ) , but not much evidence yet for this process in the central kpc regions of galaxies outside the milky way . in our own central region , the giant molecular cloud sgr b2 was recently found to contain shells in nh@xmath4 maps , and these shells contain hot cores on their periphery ",
    "evidence for triggering of massive stars ( martin - pintado et al .",
    "there is little clear evidence yet for shells and two - stage star formation in other galaxy nuclei .",
    "alonso - herrero , ryder , & knapen ( 2001 ) suggested that hii regions in the nuclear region of ngc 2903 were excited by stars triggered by older clusters seen nearby as ir sources , but the clusters inside the hii regions have not been found yet , and they could , in principle , be excited by radiation escaping from the existing ir clusters .",
    "clear evidence for sequential triggering in the nuclear regions of galaxies may be difficult to get .",
    "the high rates of shear and the small disk scale heights in inner galaxy regions should distort any shells that form , making them hard to recognize .",
    "the length scales for triggering are usually small too , perhaps 10 pc in a local gmc and 1 pc in a dense nuclear gmc .",
    "this makes the resolution required very high .",
    "sequential triggering could actually be less important than spontaneous gravitational instabilities in inner galaxy disks because the dynamical time , @xmath5 , at the extreme density of a nuclear disk is comparable to or less than the stellar evolution time of @xmath6 my .",
    "this means that spontaneous instabilities could fill a region with star formation before the dying stars from the first generation get a chance to supernova and trigger much themselves .",
    "turbulence triggers cloud and star formation by compressing gas that cools and becomes gravitationally unstable . in main galaxy disks",
    ", this compression can produce star fields with a fractal character ( gomez et al .",
    "1993 ; elmegreen & elmegreen 2001 ) and it can give a correlation between age and scale ( harris & zaritsky 1999 ) or between duration of star formation and scale ( efremov & elmegreen 1998 ; battinelli & efremov 1999 ; scalo & chappell 1999 ; nomura & kamaya 2001 ) .",
    "star formation times can be very short when clouds are formed by supersonic motions ( ballesteros - paredes , hartmann , & vazquez - semadeni 1999 ) .",
    "there have been many numerical simulations of cloud and star formation triggered by compressible turbulence ( maclow & ossenkopf 2000 ; pichardo et al .",
    "2000 ; klessen , heitsch , & maclow 2000 ; vzquez - semadeni , gazol , & scalo 2000 ; semelin & combes 2000 ; ostriker , stone , & gammie 2001 ; heitsch , mac low , & klessen 2001 ; toomre & kalnajs 1991 ; wada & norman 1999 , 2001 ) . the converging regions increase the density and produce clouds , which can then become gravitationally unstable and make clusters and stars .",
    "the clumpy and fractal structure of supersonically turbulent gas helps explain the mass functions of clouds and clusters ( fleck 1996 ; elmegreen & falgarone 1996 ; sttzki et al . 1998 ; elmegreen & efremov 1997 ; elmegreen 2001a ) .",
    "this mass function , which is @xmath7 , is found at the high mass end of old globular clusters ( ashman , conti , & zepf 1995 ) , for young globular clusters in starburst regions ( whitmore & schweizer 1995 ; zhang & fall 1999 ) , open clusters in the solar neighborhood ( battinelli et al .",
    "1994 ) , and ob associations in galaxies ( kennicutt , edgar , & hodge 1989 ; elmegreen & salzer 1999 ; mckee & williams 1997 ) .    the case for turbulence triggering in the central kpc is not well documented .",
    "there is no observation yet of a size - age or size - duration correlation for star formation , nor is there good evidence for fractal structure in the positions of young stars .",
    "nevertheless , the dust spirals in some nuclear regions have a fractal quality reminiscent of turbulence ( elmegreen , elmegreen , & eberwein 2001 ) , and the morphology of these spirals suggests shear is very important .",
    "thus the spatial correlations and space - time correlations that show up well in low - shear environments such as the large magellanic cloud may be present but difficult to recognize in the central kpc regions of spiral galaxies .",
    "the three processes of star formation mentioned above combine to give the net star formation rate in a galaxy .",
    "this total rate may be saturated to the maximum possible value given the structure of the gas ; i.e. , saturated to the value at which every suitable region forms stars on a dynamical time scale that is proportional to the inverse square root of the density ( elmegreen 2001b ) .",
    "the mechanism of star formation may not matter for the total rate ; if one mechanism does not work well , then another will take over to give the same total rate .",
    "the combination of processes also means that while gravity , star formation pressures , and turbulence may structure the positions and densities of gas clouds , the actual triggering processes inside these clouds may be a different combination of mechanisms .",
    "a cloud may form by one process and get star formation triggered by another .",
    "thus it is often difficult to say how a particular star formed .",
    "there are several correlations that should be expected for star formation that operates in a turbulent gas on a dynamical time scale .",
    "first , the mass of the largest cluster should increase with the square of the number of clusters ( as observed by whitmore 2000 ) because of the size - of - sample effect .",
    "thus regions of active star formation should have not only more clusters but also bigger clusters .",
    "second , the relative fraction of star formation that occurs in the form of clusters should increase with the total star formation rate ( larsen & richtler 2000 ) .",
    "this is because the total pressure scales approximately with the square of the gas column density in a galaxy , @xmath8 , and the star formation rate scales with this column density approximately as @xmath9 ( kennicutt 1998 ) .",
    "thus @xmath10 .",
    "in addition , for virialized clusters , the velocity dispersion is @xmath11 and the internal pressure is @xmath12 .",
    "these two equations give a relation between mass and pressure : @xmath13 the normalization for this relation comes from the properties of the molecular core near the trapezium cluster in orion ( lada , evans & falgarone 1997 ) .",
    "this mass is the maximum cluster mass since smaller clusters can fragment out . from this",
    "we get @xmath14 for internal pressure @xmath15 . if the internal pressure scales with the ambient pressure , then the maximum cluster mass @xmath16 .    the larsen & richtler ( 2000 ) correlation follows from this expression for maximum mass .",
    "the total mass of young dense clusters equals the integral of the cluster mass weighted by the mass spectrum from the smallest mass , @xmath17 , to the maximum mass , @xmath18 . for an @xmath19 spectrum ,",
    "the normalization factor @xmath20 comes from the integral of @xmath21 from @xmath18 to infinity : @xmath22 , which gives @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "thus the total cluster mass is @xmath25 .",
    "the log term is slowly varying , so we get @xmath26 . from this",
    ", the fraction of the star formation in the form of dense clusters , @xmath27 , scales directly with the star formation rate : @xmath28 this is essentially the relation found by larsen & richtler ( 2000 ) .",
    "a turbulent medium has a distribution of density that is approximately log - normal ( vzquez - semadeni 1994 ; nordlund & padoan 1999 , klessen 2000 ; wada & norman 2001 ) .",
    "stars form in the densest gas , and this accounts for only a small fraction of the total mass .",
    "the rest is at a lower density and is generally faster moving . in the full ism",
    "there are also several temperatures for the gas , and , although much of it is turbulent , only the cool component forms stars .",
    "the formation of single or binary stars requires a sufficiently high density in a small region that starlight is excluded , magnetic diffusion is relatively rapid , gravity is relatively strong , and the turbulent motions are subsonic and incompressible . the star formation rate should be approximately the total mass exceeding this density multiplied by the dynamical rate and the efficiency for the collapse process itself .",
    "collapse efficiencies may be several tens of percent once the star formation process starts ( matzner & mckee 2000 ) .",
    "the various processes of star formation that are observed in main galaxy disks are also observed in the inner kiloparsec regions where the densities and star formation rates per unit area are much larger .",
    "the relative proportion of these processes should change , however , as the ratio of the ambient dynamical time , which is @xmath29 for density @xmath30 , to the stellar evolution time , which is independent of @xmath30 , decreases . for high densities , spontaneous gravitational instabilities at the ambient jeans length and the more local instabilities that occur in turbulence - compressed gas should operate much faster than supernova and stellar wind triggering , which seem to dominate the onset of star formation locally .",
    "not much is known about these relative rates , however .",
    "high shear , high extinction , small angular scales , and short time scales make the determination of specific triggers for star formation difficult to determine in the inner kiloparsec ."
