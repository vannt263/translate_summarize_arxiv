    "quiescent solar filaments form along the inversion polarity line or between the weak remnants of active regions .",
    "early filament observations ( @xcite ) as well as recent high - resolution h@xmath0 observations , obtained with the swedish solar telescope ( sst ) in la palma ( @xcite ) and the dutch open telescope ( dot ) , have revealed that their fine structure is composed by many horizontal and thin dark threads .",
    "the measured average width of resolved threads is about @xmath1 arc sec ( @xmath2 @xmath3 km ) while the length is between @xmath4 and @xmath5 arc sec ( @xmath2 3500 - 28,000 km ) .",
    "they seem to be partially filled with cold plasma @xcite , typically two orders of magnitude denser than that of the corona , and it is generally assumed that they outline their magnetic flux tubes ( @xcite ) .",
    "this idea is strongly supported by the fact that they are inclined with respect to the filament long axis at a similar angle to what has been found for the magnetic field ( @xcite ) .",
    "small amplitude oscillations have been observed in filaments and it is well established that these periodic changes are of local nature .",
    "the detected peak velocity ranges from the noise level ( down to 0.1 km s@xmath6 in some cases ) to 23  km s@xmath6 , although larger values have also been reported .",
    "two - dimensional observations of filaments by @xcite and @xcite revealed that individual threads or groups of threads may oscillate independently with their own periods , which range between 3 and 20 minutes .",
    "more recently , @xcite reports that spatially coherent oscillations are found over slices , with an area of @xmath7 arc sec@xmath8 , of a polar crown filament , and that among other , a significant periodicity at 26 minutes , strongly damped after 4 periods , appears .",
    "furthermore , @xcite have shown evidence about traveling waves along a number of filament threads with an average phase velocity of @xmath9  km s@xmath6 , a wavelength of @xmath10 ( @xmath11  km ) , and oscillatory periods of the individual threads that vary from @xmath12 to @xmath13 minutes .",
    "the observed periodic signals are obtained from doppler velocity measurements and can therefore be associated to the transverse displacement of the fine structures .",
    "the observed small amplitude oscillations have been interpreted in terms of magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) waves ( @xcite ) and theoretical models have been developed ( see @xcite , for recent reviews ) .",
    "@xcite modeled a prominence thread as a straight cylindrical flux tube with a cool region representing the filament material , confined by two symmetric hot regions .",
    "they found that the fundamental fast mode is always confined in the dense part of the flux tube , hence , for an oscillating cylindrical filament thread , it should be difficult to induce oscillations in adjacent threads , unless they are very close .",
    "the time damping of prominence oscillations has been unambiguously determined in some observations .",
    "reliable values for the damping time have been derived , from different doppler velocity time series , by @xcite and @xcite , in prominences , and by @xcite , in filaments .",
    "the values thus obtained are usually between 1 and 4 times the corresponding period , and large regions of prominences / filaments display similar damping times .",
    "the damping of perturbations is probably a common feature of filament oscillations , hence theoretical mechanisms must be explored and their damping time scales should be compared with those obtained from observations .",
    "linear non - adiabatic mhd waves have been proposed as a potential mechanism to explain the observed attenuation time scales ( @xcite ) . using thermal mechanisms only slow waves can be damped in an efficient manner while fast waves remain almost undamped .",
    "ion - neutral collisions provide a possible mechanism to damp fast waves ( as well as alfvn waves ) that is able to reproduce observed damping times for given parameter values , in particular for a quasi - neutral gas ( @xcite ) .",
    "apart from the mentioned non - ideal damping mechanisms , there is another possibility to attenuate fast waves in thin filament threads .",
    "the phenomenon of resonant wave damping is well documented for fast kink waves in coronal loops ( see e.g.  @xcite , for recent reviews ) and provides a plausible explanation to quickly damped transverse loop oscillations observed by trace ( @xcite ) . in this letter",
    ", we address the resonant damping mechanism in the context of filament thread oscillations and assess its relevance in explaining the observed attenuation time scales .",
    "given the relatively simple structure of filament threads , when compared to the full prominence / filament structure , the magnetic and plasma configuration of an individual and isolated thread can be theoretically approximated using a rather simplified model .",
    "we consider a gravity - free , straight , cylindrically symmetric flux tube of mean radius @xmath14 ( see fig .",
    "[ fluxtube ] ) . in a system of cylindrical coordinates ( @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 ) with the @xmath17-axis coinciding with the axis of the tube",
    ", the magnetic field is pointing in the @xmath17-direction , @xmath18 .",
    "we neglect gas pressure , which allows us to concentrate on the oscillatory properties of fast and alfvn mhd waves and their mutual interaction . in our straight field configuration",
    "this zero-@xmath19 approximation implies that the field strength is uniform and that the density profile can be chosen arbitrarily .",
    "the inhomogeneous filament thread is then modeled as a density enhancement with a one - dimensional non - uniform distribution of density , @xmath20 , across the structure .",
    "the internal filament plasma , with uniform density , @xmath21 , occupies the full length of the tube and is connected to the coronal medium , with uniform density , @xmath22 , by means of a non - uniform transitional layer of thickness @xmath23 .",
    "the ratio @xmath24 provides us with a measure of the transverse inhomogeneity length - scale , that can vary in between @xmath25 ( homogeneous tube ) and @xmath26 ( fully non - uniform tube ) .",
    "the magnetic flux tube model adopted here is a waveguide for a number of mhd oscillatory solutions . in the zero-@xmath19 approximation",
    "slow waves are absent .",
    "the properties of the remaining small amplitude fast and alfvn waves can readily be described by considering the linear mhd wave equations for adiabatic changes of state for perturbations of the form @xmath27exp@xmath28 . here",
    "@xmath29 and @xmath30 are the azimuthal and longitudinal wave - numbers and @xmath31 the oscillatory frequency .",
    "we further concentrate on perturbations with @xmath32 , which represent fast kink waves that produce the transverse displacement of the tube as they propagate along the density enhancement .      in the long wavelength or thin tube approximation ( @xmath33 ) the frequency of the @xmath32",
    "fast kink wave can be written down analytically ( see @xcite ) as    @xmath34    with @xmath35 the filament ( f ) and coronal ( c ) alfvn velocities . by defining @xmath36 , for the density contrast",
    ", the period of kink oscillations with a wavelength @xmath37 can be written as    @xmath38    the factor containing the density contrast varies between @xmath39 and @xmath40 , when @xmath41 is allowed to vary between a value slightly larger that @xmath40 ( extremely tenuous thread ) and @xmath42 . for typical filament thread densities , which are two orders of magnitude larger than coronal densities , this factor is near unity .",
    "equation  ( [ period ] ) then predicts alfvn velocities in the thread as low as a few km s@xmath6 or as large as @xmath43 km s@xmath6 , for combinations of periods and wavelengths between 3 and 20 minutes , and @xmath44 and @xmath45 km , respectively",
    ".    for fast kink waves to be damped by resonant absorption , transverse inhomogeneity in the alfvn velocity has to be considered . in our uniform field model",
    "this is obtained by considering @xmath46 .",
    "then , the @xmath32 solution is resonantly coupled to local alfvn waves .",
    "the coupling produces the temporal attenuation of fast transverse motions which are converted into localized azimuthal alfvnic oscillations .",
    "asymptotic analytical expressions for the damping time , @xmath47 , can be obtained under the assumption that the transverse inhomogeneity length - scale is small ( @xmath48 ) .",
    "this is the so - called thin boundary approximation .",
    "when the long wavelength and thin boundary approximations are combined , the analytical expression for the damping time over period can be written as ( see e.g.  @xcite )    @xmath49    here @xmath50 is a numerical factor that depends on the particular variation of the density in the non - uniform layer . for a linear variation @xmath51 @xcite ; for a sinusoidal variation @xmath52 @xcite .",
    "for example , considering @xmath53 a typical density contrast and @xmath54 equation  ( [ dampingrate ] ) predicts a damping time of @xmath2 6 times the oscillatory period .",
    "figure  [ fig2 ] shows analytical estimates computed using equation  ( [ dampingrate ] ) ( solid lines ) .",
    "the damping is affected by the density contrast in the low contrast regime and @xmath55 rapidly decreases for increasing thread density ( fig .",
    "[ fig2]a ) .",
    "interestingly , it stops being dependent on this parameter in the large contrast regime , typical of filament threads .",
    "the damping time over period is independent of the wavelength of perturbations ( fig .",
    "[ fig2]b ) , but rapidly decreases with increasing inhomogeneity length - scale ( fig .",
    "[ fig2]c ) .",
    "these results suggest that resonant absorption is a very efficient mechanism for the attenuation of fast waves in filament threads , especially because large thread densities and transverse plasma inhomogeneities can be combined together .",
    "the two approximations used to derive equations  ( [ period ] ) and ( [ dampingrate ] ) may impose limitations to the applicability of the obtained results to filament thread oscillations . to start with , it is not clear how accurate the long wavelength approximation can be , especially for short wavelengths . the period in equation  ( [ dampingrate ] ) corresponds to the long wavelength limit ( [ period ] ) , which is independent of the radius of the structure , and does not include effects due to radial density inhomogeneity . also , equation  ( [ dampingrate ] ) is only valid as long as the damping time is sufficiently larger than the period , an assumption made in order to derive the expression , and clearly contradicted by the obtained results .",
    "the accuracy of the damping formula ( [ dampingrate ] ) was assessed by @xcite in the relatively low density contrast regime corresponding to damped coronal loop oscillations .",
    "some degree of inaccuracy in the large contrast regime characteristic of filament threads is also to be expected .",
    "we have therefore computed numerical approximations to the solutions by solving the full set of linear , resistive , small amplitude mhd wave equations for the @xmath32 transverse kink oscillations ( see e.g.  eqs .  [ 1][5 ] in @xcite ) , using the pde2d code ( @xcite ) .",
    "figure  [ fig2 ] shows the obtained numerical results .",
    "analytical and numerical solutions display the same qualitative behavior with density contrast and transverse inhomogeneity length - scale ( figs .",
    "[ fig2]a , c ) .",
    "now the damping time over period slightly depends on the wavelength of perturbations ( fig .",
    "[ fig2]b ) . equation ( [ dampingrate ] ) underestimates / overestimates this magnitude for short / long wavelengths .",
    "the differences are small , of the order of 3% for @xmath56 , and do not vary much with density contrast for long wavelengths ( @xmath57 ) , but increase until 6% for short ones",
    "( @xmath58 ) .",
    "the long wavelength approximation is responsible for the discrepancies obtained for thin non - uniform layers ( fig .",
    "[ fig2]c ) . figure  [ fig2]d shows how accurate equation  ( [ dampingrate ] ) is for different combinations of wavelength , density contrast , and inhomogeneity length - scale . for thin layers ( @xmath54 ) the inaccuracy of the long wavelength approximation produces differences up to @xmath2 10% for the combination of short wavelength with high contrast thread . for thick layers , differences of the order of 20%",
    "are obtained ( in agreement with @xcite ) .",
    "here , the combination of large wavelength with high contrast thread produces the largest discrepancy .",
    "numerical results allow the computation of more accurate values , but do no change our previous conclusions regarding the efficiency and properties of resonant damping of transverse oscillations in filament threads .",
    "in this letter we have shown that due to the highly inhomogeneous nature of filaments at their transverse scales the process of resonant absorption is an efficient damping mechanism for fast mhd oscillations propagating in these structures .",
    "the relevance of the mechanism has been assessed in a flux tube model , with the inclusion of transverse inhomogeneity in the alfvn velocity . also , the accuracy of analytical estimates , in terms of wavelength , density contrast , and transverse inhomogeneity , has been quantified . for the typical large filament to coronal density contrast",
    "the mechanism produces rapid damping in timescales of the order of a few oscillatory periods only .",
    "the obtained damping rates are only slightly dependent on the wavelength of perturbations .",
    "an important result is that the damping rate becomes independent of density contrast for large values of this parameter .",
    "this has two seismological consequences .",
    "first , the observational determination of density contrast is less critical than in the low contrast regime .",
    "second , according to seismic inversion results that combine theoretical and observed periods and damping times ( @xcite ) , high density thread models would be compatible with relatively short transverse inhomogeneity length - scales .",
    "analytical estimates of @xmath59 can even be calculated using equation  ( [ dampingrate ] ) for a given observed @xmath60 , taking the limit @xmath42 .",
    "we believe our conclusion on the relevance of resonant damping in filament thread oscillations is robust in front of the main simplification adopted for the present study .",
    "observations show that threads are only partially filled with cool and dense plasma and our one - dimensional model misses this property .",
    "although the resonant damping mechanism relies on the alfvn velocity inhomogeneity in the direction transverse to the magnetic field , an investigation of the damping properties in such a two - dimensional configuration is a necessary issue .",
    "finally , the presence of flows is commonly observed along filament threads and the interplay between resonant damping and flows must also be explored in this context .",
