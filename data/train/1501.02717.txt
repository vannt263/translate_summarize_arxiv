    "most of the binaries formed in relatively low velocity environment ( @xmath94 100 km / s ) would become nearly circular while those formed in very high velocity environment are likely to keep significant eccentricity when they cross the 30 hz . considering the fact that the low velocity galaxies contribute more to the total merger rate ( cf .",

    "here , we present the post newtonian ( pn ) equation of motion of binary system in the centre of mass frame up to 2.5pn order by following @xcite ( also see appendix in * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "because we assume non - spinning bhs , we do not consider spin terms in this paper .",
    "for the beginning , we borrow notations from @xcite as @xmath95 where @xmath96 and @xmath97 are the mass of stars , @xmath98 and @xmath99 are the 3-dimensional positions and velocities , and @xmath100 is the symmetric mass ratio . as mentioned in the text , the pn acceleration can be considered as a perturbation and added to the gravitational acceleration as @xmath101 where @xmath102 and @xmath103 are the pn coefficients related to the relative position and velocity , respectively , where @xmath104        and @xmath106 @xmath107 @xmath108 where @xmath109 is the first time derivative of radial distance defined as @xmath110",

    "note that the sign of @xmath103 is opposite of that in @xcite .",
    "since the nbody code uses 4th - order hermite integrator , we have to have the first time derivatives of accelerations as similar to the accelerations @xmath113 the derivative of pn acceleration @xmath114 can be expressed as @xmath115 where @xmath116 and @xmath117 are the time derivatives of the coefficients @xmath102 and @xmath103 , which are the summations of            aarseth , s.  j.  1999 , pasp , 111 , 1333 aarseth , s.  j.  2007 , mnras , 378 , 285 aarseth , s.  j.  2010 , gravitational @xmath4-body simulations , by sverre j.  aarseth , cambridge , uk : cambridge university press , 2010 , abadie , j. , abbott , b.  p. , abbott , r. , et al .",
