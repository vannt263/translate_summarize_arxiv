    "recent realization of superfluidity in a dilute gas of ultracold fermionic atoms , is driving renewed theoretical efforts aiming at a quantitative understanding of many - body correlations in a dilute fermi gas . at low density , for finite - range interactions ,",
    "one expects that all sensitivity to the detailed features of the interaction is lost  @xcite , and the system s quantum behavior depends only on the scattering length and the range of the interaction .",
    "furthermore , as we approach the `` unitarity '' limit  @xcite , i.e. the limit where the scattering length is much larger than the mean inter - particle separation , the system exhibits universal behavior and the energy is determined entirely by the density , leading to high sensitivity to many - body correlation effects .    built on the successful realization of quantum degenerate systems consisting of boson  @xcite and/or fermion  @xcite atoms , experimental progress in cold atom physics",
    "has recently resulted in the generation of ultracold molecules from ultracold atoms  @xcite , bose - einstein condensates ( bec ) of molecules  @xcite , and the first experimental realization of the small pair to large pair crossover  @xcite . in one type of experiments  @xcite ,",
    "the system consists of one - type of cold , degenerate , fermionic atoms in an optical trap .",
    "the strength of the interatomic interaction can be continuously adjusted via a magnetically - tuned feshbach resonance between a closed and an open channel .",
    "hence , the system can evolve from a bec phase in which spatially non - overlapping ( shafroth ) pairs  @xcite are bound together , to a bardeen - cooper - schrieffer ( bcs)-type superfluid  @xcite involving correlated atom pairs in momentum space .",
    "significant experimental work has been also directed towards the study of mixtures of bosonic and fermionic atom gases  @xcite .",
    "such mixtures remind of the strongly correlated @xmath0he-@xmath1he mixtures  @xcite , and can be obtained by sympathetically cooling a gas of fermionic atoms by using a condensed boson gas as a refrigerator . in this paper",
    ", we will focuss on the latter type of system , and discuss the fermionic response to a density fluctuation of the bose condensate in the trap , with special emphasis on the effects due to the finite - range character of the fermion - fermion interaction .",
    "we will argue that the shape of the acoustic attenuation rate depends on the bec or bcs character of the fermionic liquid .",
    "the hamiltonian describing the interacting fermi - bose system is given as the sum of a boson , fermion and interaction components @xmath2 this model , proposed in this context by timmermans _",
    "@xcite , is similar to the a model introduced by bardeen _",
    "et al _  @xcite to describe the effect of the fluctuations of the polarization in an excitonic liquid and a gas of electrons .",
    "this model has since been the subject of intense investigations in connection with the feshbach resonance mechanism in ultracold fermionic gases  @xcite .    in the weak coupling limit",
    ", the fermi and bose components can be treated independently , and the many - body wave function of the fermi - bose mixture is the direct product of _ independent _ fermi and bose wave functions , @xmath3 .",
    "the dispersion relation of the dilute bose condensate is  @xcite @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the phonon ( bec excitation ) velocity of sound , @xmath6 is the boson coherence length , and @xmath7 is the strength of the bosonic pseudo - potential .",
    "the coherence length , i.e. the length scale at which the condensate varies spatially , is typically of the order of @xmath8 , while @xmath9 is approximately @xmath10 in condensates with density of @xmath11 .",
    "the scattering length , @xmath12 , and the density of the bosonic component , @xmath13 , are tunable parameters which can be used to modify the dispersion relation  ( [ eq : eq ] ) , but @xmath14 , @xmath15 and , therefore , the parameters @xmath9 and @xmath16 can not be varied independently . throughout this paper @xmath17 ,",
    "i.e. the energy is measured in units of frequency .",
    "the low - energy state of the system is described by the free - energy associated with the bcs - reduced hamiltonian @xmath18 with @xmath19 .",
    "then , in a zero - temperature mean - field approximation  @xcite , the fermionic ground - state in the hartree - fock - bogoliubov representation  @xcite is the standard bcs variational wave function given by @xmath20 the bcs ansatz interpolates smoothly between the bcs and bec limit .",
    "the parameters @xmath21 are obtained by solving the system of equations @xmath22 and @xmath23 , subject to the normalization condition , @xmath24 denotes the quasi - particle spectrum in the fermionic ground state , @xmath25 .",
    "the pairing gap , @xmath26 , is obtained as @xmath27 .",
    "the interaction between the fermi and bose components is assumed to be weak , and the interaction hamiltonian , @xmath28 , describing the interaction of a single acoustic phonon of momentum @xmath29 and energy @xmath30 with the fermionic component can be written similarly to the electron - phonon hamiltonian  @xcite , as : @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the mass density of the composite gas .",

    "the normal and anomalous densities in the fermionic ground state are defined as @xmath36 .",
    "the acoustic attenuation rate appears as the superposition of components @xmath37 and @xmath38 , which depend separately on the normal and anomalous densities , respectively ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite ) .    in principle",
    ", one should also consider the possibility of exciting the anderson - goldstone mode of the fermion superfluid system .",
    "however , as it has been discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , the anderson - mode excitation can be avoided by specifying that the bec velocity of sound , @xmath9 , is less than the velocity of the anderson mode , @xmath39 , i.e. we require @xmath40 .",
    "then , the excitation of the collective anderson mode by a bec phonon mode is energetically forbidden .",
    "this is a reasonable assumption for the mixtures of bosonic bec and fermionic atom gases under consideration here : in the bcs regime , the velocity of the anderson mode , @xmath39 , is equal to the fermi - velocity @xmath41 and , for typical atom trap conditions , that can be easily satisfied .",
    "the only cold atom mixtures for which @xmath42 contain ultra - low density fermion systems or ultra - high density bec s : the first type would be difficult to realize because of the very low critical temperature for fermion superfluidity , the second type would be difficult to achieve experimentally because three - body recombination processes would quickly deplete the experimental system . hence , while the anderson mode will most likely be somewhat softened in the crossover regime ( since we expect it to go over into the bogoliubov mode of the bec - system in the bec limit of the crossover ) , by choosing a sufficiently weakly interacting bec or low density bec , it should always be possible to ensure that @xmath40 throughout the entire crossover .",
    "in order to study the phase - space constraints subjecting the acoustic attenuation rate , we consider first a schematic model of the momentum - dependence of the pairing gap , suggested by comte and nozires  @xcite : @xmath43 note that the realistic momentum dependence of the pairing gap , as predicted by the one - channel fermion - fermion model with a finite - range interaction to be discussed in the next section , has a much longer tail than the simple ansatz of comte and nozires  @xcite . unless otherwise specified , in the following we set @xmath44 for simplicity .",

    "[ fig : d4 ] and  [ fig : d01 ] , we plot the energy - dependence of the various attenuation - rate components , @xmath38 and @xmath37 , for the regime of large and small values of the pairing - gap , @xmath47 , respectively . because the quasi - particle spectrum in the model described by eq .",
    "( [ eq : cn ] ) has a minimum at finite momentum , @xmath52 , then the conservation of energy , @xmath53 , and momentum , @xmath54 , leads to four branches .",
    "the available phase - space satisfying these constraints leads to kinks observed in the energy - dependence of the acoustic attenuation rate .",
    "in particular , we have four  critical \" points , as depicted by the vertical lines in figs .  [ fig : d4 ] and  [ fig : d01 ] . in the increasing order of the `` critical '' energy",
    ", we have : @xmath55  the energy value at which the momentum conservation corresponding to the second ( @xmath56 ) and third ( @xmath57 ) branches , is no longer satisfied .",
    "this failure generates the most remarkable feature in the acoustic attenuation rate , resulting in a decrease in the acoustic attenuation rate ;",
    "@xmath58  the energy value at which the fourth branch ( @xmath59 , @xmath60 ) also fails due to failed momentum conservation ; @xmath61  the energy value at which the fourth branch vanishes ; and @xmath62  the energy value at which the second and third branches also vanish : from this point on , the only contribution is from the first branch ( @xmath63 ) .    the energy distribution of the acoustic attenuation rate may feature a `` shoulder '' just before @xmath61 , because the domain of the integrals corresponding to branches three and four is @xmath64 $ ] , i.e. the integration domain for these branches is @xmath30-independent ( see circled area in the top panel of fig .  [ fig : d4 ] .",
    "this `` shoulder '' is apparent in the large @xmath47 regime , and disappears as we approach the normal fermi gas limit .    in the small @xmath47 regime ,",
    "the `` critical '' energies @xmath55 and @xmath58 are close together , while the `` critical '' energies @xmath61 and @xmath62 are pushed to relatively higher values .",
    "when @xmath47 becomes very small , only one of the eight contributions to @xmath65 is significant ( due to the fact that the anomalous density is a delta - like distribution centered around  @xmath66 ) , and the kinks in the energy distribution of the acoustic attenuation rate are entirely obscured , except for  @xmath55 .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : eb ] we show evolution of the attenuation rate profile as a function of the pairing - gap , @xmath47 , at fixed chemical potential .",
    "the shape of the attenuation rate changes smoothly between low and large values of the pairing - gap .",
    "the signature of the crossover is the change in the sign of the slope of the acoustic attenuation rate , for phonon energies between the threshold energy , @xmath67 , and the first `` critical '' value , @xmath55 : the slope is positive in the small @xmath47 regime , and becomes negative in the large @xmath47 regime . from figs .",
    "[ fig : d4 ] and  [ fig : d01 ] follows that , the crossover is characterized by the ratio of @xmath68 , i.e. the ratio of the anomalous- to the normal - density . in the small @xmath47 limit",
    "this ratio is small ( it vanishes for the fermi gas ) . in the large @xmath47 limit",
    ", the anomalous - density contribution is comparable in size ( but still smaller ) than the normal - density contribution . in the limit when @xmath69 , we recover the normal fermi gas result .",
    "we consider now a more realistic scenario , in which the fermionic atoms interacting via a short - range gaussian potential , @xmath70 .",
    "the mean - field approximation for the ground - state properties of this system has been discussed recently in ref .",

    "the dilute fermionic state is characterized by the parameter @xmath74 , which combines together the density of the fermionic gas , characterized by the fermi momentum , @xmath66 , and the fermion - fermion scattering length .",
    "the bec - bcs crossover is indicated by the disappearance of the singularity in the fermionic density of states , @xmath75 ( see fig .  3 in ref .",
    "these results are similar to a magnetic field dependent contact interaction  @xcite , and are relevant to present experiments in which only the lowest hyperfine levels of the fermionic atom gas are populated .",

    "the bec - bcs crossover in this case occurs for @xmath74 between 0.15 and 0.80 .",
    "we assume that the dispersion relation of the bosonic component is given by the parameters : @xmath77 , and @xmath78 .",
    "our results are illustrated in fig .",

    "the energy dependence of the attenuation rate , @xmath65 , as a function of the scattering length ( or @xmath74 ) , is plotted at fixed fermion density ( @xmath76 ) . for our choice of parameters in the dispersion relation of the dilute bose condensate ( see eq .  ) , the ratio @xmath79 approaches a constant for @xmath80 . here",
    "@xmath66 is the fermi momentum , and @xmath73 is the s - wave scattering length in the fermionic component .    at the threshold , on the bcs side ,",
    "the acoustic attenuation rate features a sharp edge , followed by a ( linear ) increase in the acoustic attenuation rate as a function of the phonon energy ; in contrast , on the bec side , the sharp edge is smoothed out , and the acoustic attenuation rate decreases slowly as a function of energy . it is important to recall that in the dilute limit the bec - bcs crossover coincides with the singularity in the scattering length , and occurs for @xmath81  @xcite .",
    "the acoustic attenuation rate provides a crisp signature of the bec - bcs crossover .    on the bec side ,",
    "the energy threshold in first - order perturbation theory is higher than the energy threshold ( @xmath82 ) given by energy conservation , due to the reduced phase space availability for momentum conservation . in this regime",
    "we have @xmath83 and the contributions due to the third and fourth branches ( @xmath59 ) vanish . due to the lack of available phase space for the integral",
    ", the actual threshold in first - order perturbation theory is located further away from the energy threshold as we go deeper into the bec regime ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : one_att ] ) .",
    "the effect is enhanced by a smaller bosonic coherence length .    from the numerical results depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : one_att ] it is apparent that the attenuation rate calculated in first - order perturbation theory vanishes in the deep bec region . in this regime , one needs to include a second - order approximation in order to describe the scattering of the boson off the molecular condensate .",
    "provided that i )  the molecular condensate degrees of freedom do not play a role and that ii )  the coupling between the bosonic and fermionic components is sufficiently weak this second - order correction in perturbation theory is expected to be small and will not be discussed here . for energies greater than the threshold ,",
    "the acoustic attenuation rate becomes nonzero and the first - order result is expected to be dominant .",
    "the dependence on the phonon velocity and/or the boson mass of the strength of the bec signal is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : alpha ] . here , we depict the acoustic attenuation rate for @xmath84 ( the crossover region ) , as obtained by first changing the phonon velocity from 0.02 to @xmath85 , which is equivalent to changing @xmath86 from 1.6 to @xmath87 .",
    "next , we increase the boson mass , @xmath88 , first by 50  % and then by 100  % , which is equivalent to reducing by the same factor the bosonic coherence length , @xmath16 . the acoustic attenuation rate changes little when we increase the phonon velocity , @xmath9 , for a given boson mass , @xmath88 .",
    "in contrast , for heavier bosons , the signal drops in intensity very quickly for a relatively small increase of the boson mass , or else for a relatively small decrease in the bosonic coherence length .",
    "we note that in a related formalism , similar shapes ( especially on the bec side ) are present in the discussion of the spin - spin correlation functions ( see refs .",
    "these calculations refer to observables accessible via bragg , rf and spin - noise spectroscopy .",
    "therefore , measurements of the acoustic attenuation rate can be used in conjunction with these other techniques to probe features of the fermionic normal and anomalous densities . the acoustic attenuation rate discussed here",
    "is intrinsically a nonzero momentum transfer measurement , thus probing different moments of the fermionic normal and anomalous densities .",
    "this in turn results in different features in the shapes on the bcs side .",
    "to summarize , in this paper we have studied the acoustic attenuation rate in the framework of the fermi - bose model , for a realistic finite - range fermion - fermion interaction .",
    "our findings suggest that by inducing a density fluctuation in the bose gas component one can induce an acoustic response in the fermionic component , and the shape of the acoustic attenuation rate can be used as a signature of superfluidity on the bcs side . for a low excitation energy , the acoustic attenuation rate increases with the phonon energy on the bcs side and decreases on the bec side .",
    "therefore , a linear increase of the acoustic attenuation rate with the phonon energy above the threshold indicates that one has passed to the bcs side .",
    "moreover , our results show that the signal on the bcs side is much larger than on the bec side , which makes the detection easier .",
    "the acoustic attenuation rate measurement is favored by a larger phonon velocity and the choice of the lightest available boson specie .",
