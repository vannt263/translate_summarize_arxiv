    "within semantic frameworks for programming languages , a basic approach to the study of infinite objects is through their finite approximations .",
    "this is true both within an individual domain , as well as with domains collectively .",
    "a salient example of the latter is plotkin s approach to sfp  @xcite , where a class of domains is constructed systematically by taking colimits of sequences of finite partial orders .",
    "an important component of this framework is the notion of embedding - projection pair , capturing when one partial order is an approximation of another .",
    "an interesting outcome of this process is that completeness of an individual domain , the property that makes a cpo complete , becomes a natural by - product obtained by taking colimits of finite structures . in domain theory",
    ", the sfp- ( or bifinite ) domains now form an important cartesian closed category of domains , see  @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we study colimits of sequences of finite chu spaces .",
    "this entails the use of monic morphisms ( or monomorphisms ) as a way to formulate the substructure relationship . such an innocuous attempt led to striking differentiations of the notion dictated by the extensionality properties of the underlying spaces .",
    "we consider three base categories of chu spaces : the generic chu spaces ( * c * ) , the extensional chu spaces ( * e * ) , and the biextensional chu spaces ( * b * ) .",
    "the main results are : ( 1 ) a characterization of monics in each of the three categories ; ( 2 ) existence ( or the lack thereof ) of colimits and a characterization of finite objects in each of the corresponding categories using monomorphisms / injections ( denoted as * ic * , * ie * , and * ib * , respectively ) ; ( 3 ) a formulation of bifinite chu spaces with respect to * ic * ; ( 4 ) the existence of universal , homogeneous chu spaces in this category .",
    "unanticipated results driving this development include the fact that : ( a ) in * c * , a morphism @xmath0 is monic iff @xmath1 is injective and @xmath2 is surjective while for * e * and * b * , @xmath0 is monic iff @xmath1 is injective ( but @xmath2 is not necessarily surjective ) ; ( b ) while colimits always exist in * ie * , it is not the case for * ic * and * ib * ; ( c ) not all finite chu spaces ( considered set - theoretically ) are finite objects in their categories .",
    "bifinite chu spaces can be viewed , in an intuitive category - theoretic sense , as `` countable '' objects which are approximable by the finite objects of the category .",
    "the class of bifinite chu spaces is very rich ( up to isomorphism , there are uncountably many such spaces ) .",
    "however , we show that there is a single bifinite chu space @xmath3 which contains any other bifinite chu space as a subspace .",
    "moreover , @xmath3 can be chosen to be homogeneous , i.e. to bear maximal possible degree of symmetry , and with this additional property @xmath3 is unique up to isomorphism .",
    "our interest in chu spaces stems from a number of recent developments .",
    "chu spaces provide a suitable model of linear logic , originating from a general categorical construction introduced by barr and his student  @xcite .",
    "the rich mathematical content of chu spaces has been extensively illustrated by pratt and his collaborators in a variety of settings , ranging from concurrency to logic and category theory  @xcite .",
    "in particular , pratt shows that all small categories can be embedded in a certain category of chu spaces  @xcite .",
    "chu spaces are closely related to the topic of formal concept analysis ( fca  @xcite ) .",
    "both areas use the same objects but the morphisms considered in fca are different .",
    "chu spaces are also related to domains  @xcite . in @xcite , a class",
    "called casuistries was introduced as a `` continuous '' version of chu spaces , and yet maintaining the constructions desired as a model of linear logic . on the other hand , if instead of chu transformations , chu spaces are equipped with what are called _ approximable mappings _",
    "@xcite , one obtains a cartesian closed category equivalent to the category of algebraic lattices and scott continuous functions  @xcite . for",
    "this to work properly , a modified notion of formal concept , called _",
    "approximable concept _ , needs to be used  @xcite .",
    "this way , an infinite concept can be approximated by finite ones .",
    "universal objects have played an important role in the development of domain theory .",
    "for example , the early work of scott  @xcite and plotkin  @xcite showed that with universal objects , domain equations can be treated by a calculus of retracts .    by studying chu spaces that are colimits of sequences of finite objects ,",
    "we hope to understand these spaces from a constructive angle , formulate a notion of completeness , and study the existence of universal , homogeneous objects .",
    "recursively defined chu spaces as well as models of linear logic within bifinite chu spaces are some topics worth revisiting in light of this paper .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section 2 recalls basic terminologies and gives a characterization of monic morphisms in the categories * c * , * e * , and * b*. section 3 studies colimits in the categories * ic * , * ie * , and * ib*. section 4 characterizes finite objects in * ic * , * ie * , and * ib*. section 5 introduces bifinite chu spaces and shows the existence of universal , homogeneous bifinite chu spaces using finite amalgamation .",
    "remark : the shortened conference version of the paper was presented at calco 2007 in bergen , norway .",
    "we recall some basic definitions to fix notation , following  @xcite .",
    "readers interested in more details should consult  @xcite . in  @xcite",
