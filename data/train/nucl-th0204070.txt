    "the pairing problem , which was introduced first in atomic physics @xcite , was later applied to nuclear physics @xcite in an attempt to describe binding energies of nuclei and their low - lying vibrational spectra @xcite .",

    "this revival of interest in pairing follows from the recent development of radioactive beam facilities and attempts to bridge from nuclear structure considerations to astrophysical phenomena @xcite .",
    "along with approximate mean field solutions ( for a review see @xcite ) , the pairing problem can be solved exactly by means of various group theoretical methods , which allow one to explore the underlying symmetries .",

    "the simple  quasi - spin \" ( @xmath13 ) approach @xcite not only offers an elegant way to understand the results from the conventional seniority scheme @xcite , based on @xmath14 , but allows for a straightforward expansion to @xmath15 to include protons and neutrons , which otherwise has proven to be too complicated .",

    "the model space consists of @xmath23 states with pairs coupled to isospin @xmath18 ; mixing with @xmath19 @xmath17 pairs is not included .",
    "the importance of the isovector pairing for binding energies is suggested by experimental data , namely a @xmath24 ground state for most @xmath25 odd - odd nuclei with mass number @xmath26 @xcite , and by the results of various theoretical studies @xcite .",
    "while coupling to the isoscalar @xmath17 pairing mode may be important in some cases @xcite , we exclude  to the best of our ability  the ground states of nuclei that show fingerprints of isoscalar pairing correlations . in short ,",

    "is realized leading also to an exact @xmath32-deformed solution of the problem and its limiting cases .",
    "the motivation behind the @xmath32-deformed generalization is that , as a novel and richer model , it allows us to include non - linear features of the interaction and to investigate the respective changes this may require in the strength parameters and in the pairing gaps .",

    "an analysis of the results , obtained by fitting model parameters to experimental data both in the deformed and non - deformed cases , provides for a reasonable prediction of the relevant @xmath5 state energies of nuclei classified as belonging to a major shell and gives insight into their pair structure and isospin mixing .",
    "it also estimates the broad limits of applicability of such a simple algebraic model and its deformed non - linear extension which is in agreement with the results of other theoretical approaches for describing pairing phenomena in nuclear systems @xcite .",

    "is introduced with emphasis on the physical interpretation of the generators . in section 3 the application of the algebraic constructions",
    "is realized through the introduction of a model hamiltonian in both the deformed and non - deformed cases . in section 4 , the parameters of the hamiltonians are presented as output of a fitting procedure to the respective experimental energies and the results are analyzed . a summary of our findings and the main conclusions as well as possible further developments of the approach are discussed in the final section .",

    "this accounts for the differences in the experimental data between mirror nuclei even after the coulomb energy correction . in the limit of identical - particle coupling , when @xmath32 increases from one ( @xmath281 ) neutron pairs are less bound and proton pairs give a larger pairing gap , and vice versa for @xmath282 . in this way",

    "the reason may be that while higher - order effects may be significant in nuclei they probably cancel on average when the @xmath32-parameter is one and the same for all nuclei .",
    "however , in two of the cases , @xmath201 and @xmath209 , it is of an order of magnitude greater than the estimation of other physical applications ( @xcite and references there ) and for the shell @xmath7 , our value ( @xmath283 ) is comparable to the values obtained in a @xmath32-deformed like - particle seniority model @xcite : @xmath284 for the neutron pairs and @xmath285 for protons . for the nuclei in the multi-@xmath4 shell our model yields a bigger @xmath32-parameter than for the lighter nuclei in single-@xmath4 shell ( table 3 ) , where the small number of valence nucleons is not sufficient to build strong non - linear correlations",
    "this suggests that the @xmath32-deformation is more significant for masses @xmath286 .",
    "the fitting procedure not only estimates the magnitude of the pairing strength and describes the type of the dominant coupling mode , it also can be used to predict nuclear energies that have not been measured . from the fit for the @xmath7 case the binding energy of the proton - rich @xmath287 nucleus",
    "is estimated to be @xmath288 mev , which is by @xmath289 greater than the sophisticated semi - empirical estimate of @xcite .",
