    "@xcite it was conjectured that after only fixing the number and form of possible singularities , gauge invariance uniquely determines the yang - mills and gravity scattering amplitudes .",
    "it was also stated that the same is true for scalar theories like the non - linear sigma model ( nlsm ) and dirac - born - infeld ( dbi ) , when gauge invariance is replaced by vanishing in the single soft limit .",
    "crucially , in all of these cases locality and unitarity are never assumed , and so arise automatically as a consequence of uniqueness . here by locality",
    "we mean that poles correspond to propagators of cubic diagrams ( for ym and gr ) , and quartic diagrams ( for nlsm and dbi ) , while by unitarity we mean factorization on those poles . in some sense",
    "then we see the emergence of spacetime and local quantum interactions purely from gauge invariance .",
    "a similar result was presented in ref .",
    "@xcite , that locality and vanishing under large bcfw shifts are also sufficient to completely fix the yang - mills amplitude . beyond their conceptual implications ,",
    "these uniqueness results have a very practical application : if a given expression can be verified to be gauge invariant and contain the correct singularity structure , it is now guaranteed to match the corresponding amplitude .",
    "this has many implications for a wide variety of recently developed formalisms , like bcfw recursion relations @xcite , the bcj duality @xcite , or the chy scattering equations @xcite-@xcite , among others .",
    "the proof used in this article also demonstrates a new powerful application of soft limits , as well as novel derivations of the well - known leading theorems @xcite@xcite . leading and subleading soft theorems",
    "have already proven very useful in a number of very surprising ways .",
    "originally , they showed that charge conservation or the equivalence principle can be derived from s - matrix arguments @xcite .",
    "more recently , the theorems were interpreted as consequences of new symmetries @xcite , with further implications for black - hole information @xcite .",
    "they were also used for recursion relations for effective field theories @xcite .",
    "the goal of this paper is three - fold .",
    "first , we present the full details of the argument used in ref .",
    "@xcite to prove the uniqueness claims for yang - mills , gravity , nlsm , and dbi , when locality is assumed .",
    "second , we extend the argument to prove the conjecture that uniqueness still holds without assuming locality .",
    "and third , we make an even larger conjecture , that gauge invariance alone , with no assumptions on the presence of any singularities , is sufficient to imply both locality and unitarity .",
    "independent solutions , forming the bcj basis of yang - mills amplitudes . ]      in all four theories , yang - mills , gravity , nlsm , and dbi , we start with an ansatz @xmath1 , based on our assumptions of the singularity structure and mass dimension . in general , this ansatz contains functions of the form : @xmath2 where the numerators @xmath3 are general polynomials with @xmath4 powers of momenta , and linear in some number of polarization vectors / tensors ( for ym / gr ) . the denominators @xmath5 can be any polynomial of @xmath6 factors . if we assume locality , it means we must restrict each @xmath5 to be a product of simple poles , which can be associated to propagators of cubic ( for ym and gr ) or quartic ( for nlsm and dbi ) diagrams .",
    "that is , a local ansatz has a form : @xmath7 with @xmath8 corresponding to the channels of each diagram .",
    "as discussed in @xcite , it is always possible to put amplitudes in this cubic diagram form , by adding artificial propagators to the higher point vertex interactions . for ym and nlsm the diagrams",
    "are ordered , while for gravity and dbi they are not .",
    "we can relax locality by dropping the underlying diagram structure , allowing each term to have some number @xmath9 of any singularities @xmath10 , with the @xmath11 consecutive for ym and nlsm : @xmath12    then the claim is that for the smallest @xmath9 and @xmath4 which admit solutions , the ansatz ( [ lll ] ) is uniquely fixed by gauge invariance / vanishing in the single soft limit in @xmath0 particles . concretely ,",
    "these smallest values for @xmath9 and @xmath4 are :    * yang - mills : @xmath13 , @xmath14 * gravity : @xmath13 , @xmath15 * nlsm : @xmath16 , @xmath14 * dbi : @xmath16 , @xmath15    in this article , we prove the following results :    1 .",
    "local singularities + gauge invariance @xmath17 locality + unitarity 2 .",
    "locality + adler zero @xmath17 unitarity    the stronger version of claim number 2 for nlsm and dbi ( that local singularities + adler zero @xmath17 locality + unitarity ) is less susceptible to the argument we use in this article , but a more direct approach was already presented in @xcite .",
    "we also prove a stronger result for yang - mills , by allowing non - local singularities @xmath18 , with some mild restrictions .",
    "further , we conjecture that completely ignoring the singularity structure , gauge invariance alone forces general polynomials to be linear combinations of amplitude numerators .    surprisingly , imposing gauge invariance / vanishing in the soft limit for the @xmath19 particle is not required , and is automatic once the other @xmath0 constraints have been imposed . without loss of generality we can take particle 3 to be this @xmath20 particle , and we will always impose momentum conservation by expressing @xmath21 in terms of the other momenta . tying the unneeded @xmath19 constraint to momentum conservation",
    "ensures that we always avoid checks of the form @xmath22 , which would complicate the analysis .    to begin",
    ", the above statements can be easily tested explicitly for a small number of particles . for yang - mills , at four points , we can only have terms with one pole , either @xmath23 or @xmath24 .",
    "then the most general term we can write down is a linear combination of 60 terms , of the form @xmath25 imposing gauge invariance in particles 1 , 2 , and 4 forces the coefficients @xmath26 to satisfy some linear equations with a unique solution , which turns out to be precisely the scattering amplitude of four gluons .    at five points ,",
    "the most general non - local ansatz , where we only assume two cyclic singularities per term , contains some 7500 terms , and it can be checked that gauge invariance in four particles leads to the five point amplitude .",
    "it is indeed quite remarkable that gauge invariance is so constraining to produce a unique solution . actually , it is even more remarkable that any solution exists at all !",
    "the amplitudes are the result of a striking conspiracy between the propagator structure and momentum conservation .",
    "it is easy to make a gauge invariant in @xmath27 particles by taking different contractions of @xmath28 , but this requires a mass dimension of @xmath29 $ ] .",
    "no single diagram has enough momenta in the numerator to accommodate this product , so different diagrams must cancel each other .",
    "but less obviously , without momentum conservation , such contractions will always contain terms with at least @xmath27 factors of @xmath30 .",
    "this is impossible to achieve even with several diagrams , since each diagram numerator can have at most @xmath31 such factors per term , while the denominators only contains @xmath6 factors .",
    "but with momentum conservation , together with a cubic propagator structure , it turns out that @xmath31 factors are sufficient , creating an object which satisfies more constraints than expected by simple counting .",
    "in fact , we will show that this structure is indeed very special .",
    "there is no non - trivial way of deforming or adding things to produce different solutions .",
    "identical facts hold for the other theories as well .",
    "for example , the nlsm requires vanishing under @xmath0 particles , which naively would require @xmath32 for @xmath0 particles .",
    "again , however , only at @xmath14 , with momentum conservation and quartic diagrams we find an exception , which is the amplitude itself .",
    "the absence of solutions below this critical mass dimension is at the heart of the proof .",
    "the basic strategy for the proof is the following .",
    "we start with an appropriate ansatz ( local , non - local , etc ) , and we take single / double soft expansions . then order by order",
    "we show that gauge invariance / the adler zero condition uniquely fix the corresponding amplitudes . in this process",
    "we do not assume any form of the soft theorems , but we end up re - deriving the well known leading terms @xcite",
    ". our approach does not directly provide the subleading terms ( which for gravity have a particularly nice form @xcite ) , but only proves their uniqueness .",
    "the whole proof rests on showing that after the first non - vanishing order is fixed , none of the higher orders can produce independent solutions .",
    "the reason for this is that the subleading orders must have a growing number of soft momenta in the numerator , leaving fewer momenta to satisfy the necessary requirements .      in section [ gaugeinv ] ,",
    "we begin by exploring the notion of constrained gauge invariance .",
    "we find a very simple proof that functions with at most @xmath33 factors of momenta in the numerator can be gauge invariant in at most @xmath4 particles , while the same is true for tensors with @xmath34 .    in section [ unique1 ] ,",
    "we first prove a weaker version of our statement for ym and gr , by assuming locality . in section [ unique2 ]",
    "the same argument is applied to the nlsm and dbi amplitudes , with gauge invariance replaced by the adler zero condition .    in section [ locality ] ,",
    "relaxing our assumptions on the underlying cubic diagrams , we instead consider a more general singularity structure .",
    "we only keep the requirement of ( local ) singularities of the form @xmath35 , and recover the unique amplitude , as long as the number of such singularities per term is @xmath36 . for fewer singularities",
    "there are no solutions , while for more the answer can always be factorized as @xmath37 .",
    "this proves the conjecture originally made in ref @xcite .",
    "finally , in section [ l2 ] , we investigate the extent to which more general singularities can be used to fix the yang - mills amplitude .",
    "completely non - local singularities of the form @xmath18 , with some minor restrictions , are also shown to provide a unique solution .",
    "trying to find a less arbitrary ansatz , we are lead to consider polynomials again , with no singularities at all .",
    "we conjecture that yet an even stronger statement can be made , namely that the smallest mass dimension polynomial that admits a solution is fixed to a linear combination of amplitude numerators , when gauge invariance in _ all _ @xmath27 particles is imposed .",
    "the usual argument can be used to provide leading order evidence for this fact .",
    "let @xmath38 be a polynomial linear in polarization vectors , with at most @xmath4 factors of dot products of the type @xmath30 in any given term .",
    "let @xmath39 be the total number of gauge invariance requirements , and @xmath40 be the  excess \" of gauge invariance requirements compared to the maximum number of @xmath41 factors .",
    "when appropriate , we will use the notation @xmath42 to distinguish polarization vectors which are not used for gauge invariance .",
    "we wish to prove that , without momentum conservation , @xmath38 can be gauge invariant in at most @xmath4 particles , ie .",
    "satisfy at most @xmath43 constraints .",
    "then we will prove that with momentum conservation the statement is still true , but only for @xmath33 .",
    "having no momentum conservation implies gauge invariants in particle @xmath44 must be proportional to @xmath45 .",
    "therefore the only way to obtain gauge invariants in @xmath4 particles is with linear combinations of different contractions of products @xmath46 .",
    "we will show that such expressions always contain at least one term with @xmath4 factors of @xmath41 .    by assumption",
    "there are always more @xmath47 s than @xmath41 s , so at least one of the polarization vectors needed for gauge invariance will be in a factor @xmath48 or @xmath49 .",
    "consider first as an example the following term in a polynomial with @xmath50 : @xmath51 we wish to show that such a term can not be gauge invariant in three particles , say particles 1 , 2 and 3 .",
    "we start with a polarization vector sitting in a @xmath48 factor , for example @xmath52 . to make a gauge invariant in particle 1",
    ", at least one of the @xmath53 above must be a @xmath54 , and a pair term must exist with @xmath52 and a @xmath54 switched .",
    "we can use either the @xmath55 in the @xmath56 ( or @xmath57 ) factor , or one in the @xmath58 factor , to make the gauge invariants : @xmath59 however , the second option leads to a term with four @xmath41 factors , contradicting our claim that just two factors are sufficient .",
    "the first option is fine , and so we can only use @xmath55 s in @xmath41 factors for this mark - and - switch procedure .",
    "now consider the second term in @xmath60 above , and note that we ended up with another @xmath48 factor , namely @xmath61 . applying the same reasoning for gauge invariance in 3 forces us to fix the factor @xmath62 to @xmath63 .",
    "therefore the second piece of @xmath60 can form a gauge invariant in particle 3 in the pair : @xmath64 now we do not need gauge invariance in 4 , so this chain @xmath65 is finished .",
    "note we do not care about making the first piece of @xmath60 gauge invariant in particle 3 , we are only interested in finding some minimal constraints . instead , we go back to ( [ eq0 ] ) to check gauge invariance in the remaining particle 2 . but",
    "the choices we made so far by imposing gauge invariance in 1 and 3 fixed both @xmath41 factors in this initial term to @xmath66 so now there is no way to make it gauge invariant in 2 , as all the allowed @xmath55 s have been used up .",
    "therefore the term ( [ eq0 ] ) is not compatible with gauge invariance in \\{1,2,3}.    the general strategy is the same .",
    "new chains always start in the original term from @xmath49 or @xmath48 factors , which are aways present by assumption .",
    "next , for each jump we fix a @xmath55 in an @xmath41 or @xmath67 factor , which becomes unavailable for other gauge invariants .",
    "the chain ends when reaching an @xmath67 factor , and a new chain is started from the original term , and so on .",
    "the process ends when all the chains have ended on @xmath67 factors , which means gauge invariance is compatible with this counting argument , or when all the @xmath41 s have been marked and a chain is unable to continue , which means the term is ruled out .    in general , we said we need gauge invariance in @xmath68 + 2\\#[e.e]+\\#[e.p]$ ] particles , but have only @xmath69+\\#[e.p]$ ] factors .",
    "this means the difference between how many chains must start and how many can end is : @xmath70 + 2\\#[e.e]\\right)-\\#[\\overline{e}.p]=1 $ ] .",
    "therefore there is always at least one chain which can not end , so all possible starting terms are ruled out . then there is no way to make a polynomial @xmath38 gauge invariant in @xmath71 particles .",
    "now we consider the same type of polynomials from above , but on the support of momentum conservation , @xmath72 . to impose momentum conservation explicitly , we can choose three particles ( for example 2 , 3 , and 4 ) , and use the following relations : @xmath73 this allows other ways of forming gauge invariance in particles 2 , 3 and 4 .",
    "for example , for particle 2 we can now have a new gauge invariant of the form @xmath74 such an expression avoids our previous argument : now both particles 2 and 4 can share the same @xmath75 factor above . when checking gauge invariance in at most @xmath76 particles this is not a problem , as we can always impose momentum conservation in such a way as to avoid these three special particles .",
    "however , for more than @xmath76 particles , at least one particle has to be affected by momentum conservation .    the worst case that we will need to prove is that @xmath77 can not be gauge invariant in @xmath31 particles . without loss of generality ,",
    "since we can change how we impose momentum conservation , we can leave out 3 and 4 , and assume that these @xmath31 particles are @xmath78 .",
    "then @xmath76 of the particles can only form gauge invariants of the form @xmath79 , while particle 2 allows gauge invariants of the form ( [ alt ] ) .",
    "since we only have @xmath80 factors of @xmath41 , the first @xmath76 constraints already fix all such factors .",
    "however , we are not checking gauge invariance in particle 4 , so none of the factors will be fixed to @xmath81 , more specifically to the @xmath75 needed in eq .",
    "( [ alt ] ) .",
    "therefore there is still no room to form the gauge invariant for particle 2 .",
    "this proves that a polynomial @xmath82 with @xmath33 can be gauge invariant in at most @xmath4 particles .",
    "it is easy to see that the last step of the argument fails for @xmath14 . in that case",
    "the counting allows for gauge invariance in not just @xmath0 particles , but all the way to @xmath27 particles .",
    "this is of course what we should expect , since a polynomial @xmath83 corresponds to the full amplitude numerator , and is gauge invariant in @xmath27 particles .",
    "the previous results for polynomials can be extended to functions with poles , such as those we initially introduced in eq .",
    "( [ nl ] ) : @xmath84 because the @xmath5 are only functions of @xmath58 factors , a function with at most @xmath4 momenta in the numerators can be expressed in terms of a polynomial with at most @xmath4 factors of @xmath41 : @xmath85 this implies that a function @xmath1 can not be gauge invariant in @xmath71 particles , if @xmath86 .",
    "this statement can be generalized to tensors @xmath87 .",
    "we can write out the components of such a tensor : @xmath88 and determine what constraints each of the functions above must satisfy in order for @xmath87 to be gauge invariant in @xmath71 particles .",
    "we can treat each different type of function in order :    * @xmath89 : if we check gauge invariance in some particle @xmath90 , with @xmath91 , the prefactor remains unique , and none of the other terms in ( [ qq1 ] ) may cancel against @xmath92 .",
    "this implies @xmath93 itself must be gauge invariant in at least @xmath94 particles so is ruled out , if @xmath95 . *",

    "@xmath107 : is only ruled out for @xmath33    to summarize , we obtain just three types of cases : @xmath108 all of which vanish for @xmath86 .",
    "for @xmath14 , the first two also vanish , but for the third we have an apparent contradiction , since we know that functions @xmath109 have sufficient momenta to satisfy gauge invariance in @xmath0 particles .",
    "however , when @xmath14 , case ( [ 3rd ] ) does not exist .",
    "the only tensor @xmath110 that will show up in the actual proof has @xmath111 , so it does not contain a component @xmath112 .    therefore",

    "we have not derived what these must be , but since we can just write down the five terms of eq .",

    "after _ using momentum conservation @xmath318 , we can add arbitrary coefficients @xmath319 .",
    "for example , from a six point local pole like @xmath320 , we can obtain @xmath321 . note how this rule does nt allow the four point pole @xmath308 from above .",
    "it can only come from the pole @xmath322 , which is not cyclic . at five points ,",
    "the most general set of singularities that can be used is : @xmath323 for an @xmath27 point amplitude , @xmath31 of the singularities keep the form @xmath324 , while the others are promoted to carry these extra coefficients .",
    "now , the usual proof by induction will work , as long as we avoid taking soft the particles adjacent to 3 , which is of course always possible from four points and higher .",
    "this procedure ensures that the soft - singularities @xmath132 , critical for the leading term , are not affected in any way .",
    "then the leading term is as usual @xmath325 where now @xmath326 also contains the non - local singularities described above .",
    "if by assumption even this non - local @xmath138 is uniquely fixed by gauge invariance , ultimately so will @xmath151 .",
    "the claim is in fact trivial at four points , where none of the poles may be modified , so @xmath327 .    with a few extra restrictions ,",
    "a similar result can be shown for gravity as well , though the procedure is somewhat more complicated because for gravity soft - singularities involving @xmath21 are not so easily avoided .",
    "the solution is to require several extra poles to keep their usual local form , in such a way to ensure that even after taking multiple soft limits , there always exists a particle which forms no soft - singularities with @xmath21 .",
    "so far , we have mostly looked at functions with singularities of the form @xmath35 , and in some cases we showed that singularities of the type @xmath18 also lead to uniqueness .",
    "but what about allowing the denominators to be polynomials of some degree @xmath328 , instead of @xmath9 products of singularities ? in general",
    ", this is a very difficult question to systematically analyze , and given the four point counter - example from the previous section , it might simply be an ill - posed question .",
    "but instead of trying to understand all such completely general poles , there is an even more general alternative to pursue .",
    "we can completely disregard singularities , and investigate gauge invariance directly at the level of the total numerator , by considering general polynomials instead of functions with poles . clearly , given sufficient mass dimension , a general polynomial can always be thought of as originating from the most general singularity structure possible .",
    "we can start with the minimal polynomial which admits any solution , which has @xmath31 @xmath41 factors , and @xmath329 total mass dimension , the same as an actual amplitude numerator .",
    "it turns out that imposing our usual @xmath0 gauge invariance constraints does not provide a meaningful solution , but imposing the full @xmath27 constraints does : we obtain a linear combination of amplitude numerators ! the @xmath19 extra constraint essentially is required to replace the information we lost by not considering denominators which are products of singularities . from this perspective , the singularities do no play any crucial or physical role , but only provide a useful method of organizing terms in the polynomial . while we do not have a proof for this fact for @xmath330 , it is easily testable at five points .",
    "there we obtain six solutions , which are linear combinations of five point amplitude numerators , corresponding to different orderings .",
    "below we provide leading order evidence for this fact .",

    "first , it is easy to check that imposing all four gauge invariance conditions on the four point polynomial @xmath331 gives a unique solution .",
    "this corresponds to the fact that all four point amplitudes have the same numerator .",
    "that is , any amplitude can be obtained by dividing the same numerator by the desired propagator structure : @xmath332 at five points , the leading piece of the general polynomial must have a form : @xmath333}n^{\\mu\\nu}(p^8)\\ , .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] after imposing the other four constraints all possible components are ruled out , except the following : @xmath334 where @xmath335 .",
    "now the @xmath336 must also satisfy the four constraints .",
    "first , we can rewrite @xmath337 , after a reshuffling of the coefficients .",
    "then , the constraints imposed on @xmath338 instead act on @xmath339 , which by assumption is fixed uniquely to the four point numerator . finally , there are two independent @xmath6 factors at four points",
    ". therefore we obtain @xmath340 ie .",
    "six independent solutions , which are related to the leading pieces of amplitude numerators .",
    "unfortunately , the subleading order is not ruled out so quickly .",
    "the @xmath341 still have enough momenta to provide gauge invariant contributions even at this order : @xmath342 and so the usual argument fails in its simplest form .",
    "however , considering all orders , eventually these extra solutions become tied to the original six , and in the end just six solutions are left .",
    "the argument becomes even less well suited for higher points , so clearly a better strategy is required .",
    "in this note we have presented the full proofs for some of the uniqueness claims originally made in @xcite .",
    "we summarize these results below .",

    "the next step is understanding how to approach such polynomials with absolutely no singularity structure .",
    "it would be very interesting to see if the soft limit argument can be extended even further , or if an even more powerful argument is required .",
    "meanwhile , for nlsm and dbi , it is not even clear what the equivalent claim should be , if it exists . for ym",

    "for scalar theories , there is no distinction to be made : all the @xmath55 s are equal .",
    "we should note that an equivalent claim for gravity does not exist .",
    "it is trivial to obtain many different solutions by gluing together yang - mills amplitudes , while there is a unique gravity numerator .",
    "nevertheless , even if the numerator statement is less fundamental than the other results , it is a very useful exercise . after all , thinking about polynomials lead to the crucial results of section [ gaugeinv ] , so perhaps there is more to be learned from this perspective .",
    "a more important issue to be understood is that of the gram determinant relations . when working in some fixed dimension @xmath349 , at most @xmath350 vectors can be linearly independent ( @xmath351 because of momentum conservation ) .",
    "for example , if we restrict to 4d , starting at six points , we can express @xmath352 in terms of the other four independent momenta : @xmath353 this could allow for different solutions to our requirements .",
    "the linear dependence ( [ lin ] ) can be viewed as another form of momentum conservation : @xmath354 we already saw that adding momentum conservation limited the applicability of our initial polynomial argument to @xmath86 : at @xmath14 momentum conservation allowed for some `` free '' gauge invariants to be formed .",
    "luckily , this was still sufficiently constraining for our purposes .",
    "it is not inconceivable , though would be very surprising , that the gram determinant relations could allow such free gauge invariants starting at @xmath80 for example .",
    "ultimately , these results strongly suggest that scattering amplitudes might have a different definition , perhaps geometric , in line with the amplituhedron program @xcite . a formulation where both this minimal singularity structure and gauge invariance / vanishing in the soft limit are manifest could potentially uncover yet more unknown features of these theories .",

    "<S> we show that : ( 1 ) yang - mills and general relativity amplitudes are completely determined by gauge invariance in @xmath0 particles , with minimal assumptions on the singularity structure ; ( 2 ) scalar non - linear sigma model and dirac - born - infeld amplitudes are fixed by imposing full locality and the adler zero condition ( vanishing in the single soft limit ) on @xmath0 particles . </S>",
    "<S> we complete the proofs by showing uniqueness order by order in the single soft expansion for yang - mills and general relativity , and the double soft expansion for nlsm and dbi . </S>",
    "<S> we further present evidence for a greater conjecture regarding yang - mills amplitudes , that a maximally constrained gauge invariance alone leads to both locality and unitarity , without any assumptions on the existence of singularities . in this case </S>",
