    "graphene has attracted considerable attention recently due to its linear energy dispersion , where the excitations are massless dirac fermions , which could lead to physical behavior different from that of the standard two - dimensional systems .",

    "however , it requires the use of a cutoff function , without which the contributions from the higher energy states add up to produce a diverging and oscillatory result .",

    "in fact , using exact diagonalization on finite lattices , black - schaffer@xcite extracted @xmath0 values which differed from saremi s results both in the prefactors and , for @xmath5 , in the oscillatory factor as well . on the other hand , the finite lattice calculations in turn suffer from the deficiency that the distance between the impurities can not be too large and extra interactions between the moments get introduced due to the supercell geometry .    in order to address these issues",
    ", we use a direct computation of the lattice green s functions to compute the rkky interaction with the full tight - binding band structure .",
    "the method allows us to numerically calculate the rkky interaction for very large distances , which is impractical to obtain from the finite lattice calculations .",
    "in addition , we obtain analytical results for the long - distance behavior of @xmath0 by using an approach slightly different from that of saremi,@xcite which allows us to obtain the proper phase factors in the rkky oscillations that were missed in the previous works .",

    "the results can be easily generalized if the hopping integrals @xmath12 are retained beyond the nearest neighbor .",
