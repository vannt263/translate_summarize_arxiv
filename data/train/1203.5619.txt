    "the importance of the theory of holomorphic ( analytic ) functions of one complex variable suggests looking for a similar theory for functions of three and more real variables . considering the case of four variables , where the quaternion algebra @xmath0 should replace the field @xmath1 of complex numbers ,",
    "is , of course , especially natural .",
    "let us recall that the quaternion algebra was introduced by w.r .",
    "hamilton in 1843 ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , and that , according to _ frobenius theorem _ ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , every finite - dimensional ( associative ) division algebra over the field @xmath2 of real numbers is isomorphic either to @xmath2 , or to @xmath1 , or to @xmath0 .    in a sense , there are three well - known methods for constructing the theory of holomorphic functions of one complex variable : the derivative method , the polynomial method and the gradient method . in the case of quaternion functions , none of them leads to a satisfactory quaternionic analogue of the notion of a holomorphic function .",
    "this method is based on the use of the limit definition of a derivative . in the case of quaternion functions ,",
    "such an approach yields at least two notions of the quaternion derivative of a quaternion function @xmath3 .",
    "the point is that , as quaternions do not commute , there are two different possibilities for regarding the ratio @xmath4 : one could replace it either by @xmath5 h^{-1}$ ] or by @xmath6 $ ] .",
    "this leads to the notion of a right - hand derivative @xmath7 h^{-1}\\ ] ] and to the notion of a left - hand derivative @xmath8 , \\ ] ] provided that the corresponding one - sided limit exists .",
    "actually , both of these notions are too restricted .",
    "it turns out @xcite that only the functions @xmath9 possess the right - hand derivative , and only the functions @xmath10 possess the left - hand derivative , while only the functions @xmath11 possess both left- and right - hand derivatives , and they are equal . here",
    "@xmath12 and @xmath13 are quaternions , while @xmath14 is a real number .",
    "let us consider a polynomial @xmath15 of two real variables @xmath16 , @xmath17 with complex coefficients @xmath18 .",
    "replacing @xmath16 with @xmath19 , and replacing @xmath17 with @xmath20 , we obtain the polynomial @xmath21 of the complex variables @xmath22 and @xmath23 . in order that @xmath21 be a polynomial of only the variable @xmath24 ,",
    "it is necessary and sufficient that @xmath21 satisfies the well - known cauchy ",
    "riemann condition .",
    "this condition is precisely what is needed for distinguishing the class of polynomials of the variable @xmath24 .",
    "an analogous approach to the polynomials of the variables @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 with quaternion coefficients is too general to give a desired result @xcite .",
    "indeed , the hausdorff formulas @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 @xcite allow us to express the real coordinates @xmath33 of the quaternion @xmath34 in terms of @xmath24 itself , without using the conjugate quaternion @xmath35 .",
    "( note that along with the hausdorff formulas , we also have the formulas @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 and @xmath39 , but unlike the complex case , they are not essential . )",
    "hence the functions which can be represented by quaternionic power series are just those which can be represented by power series in four real variables .",
    "loomann @xcite and menchoff @xcite proved that any complex - valued continuous function that satisfies the cauchy ",
    "riemann condition in a complex domain , is holomorphic in the same domain @xcite .",
    "thus , in order to extend the theory of holomorphic functions to the quaternionic setting , one of the possible ways is to try to find a quaternionic analogue of the cauchy - riemann equations . in 1935 ,",
    "fueter@xcite proposed such a quaternionic analogue by introducing two quaternion gradient operators @xmath40 and @xmath41 he calls a quaternion function @xmath3 of the quaternion variable @xmath34 _ right - regular _ , provided @xmath42 _ left - regularity _ of @xmath43 is defined in a similar way by requiring that @xmath44 @xmath43 is called _ regular _ if it is simultaneously left and right regular .",
    "such quaternion functions are to be thought of as the appropriate generalization of holomorphic functions to the quaternionic setting .",
    "any right or left regular quaternion function is harmonic , i.e. satisfies laplace s equation @xmath45 moreover , for any real harmonic function , there is a regular function whose real part is exactly the given function ( see @xcite ) .",
    "thus there are plenty of regular functions .",
    "although fueter s approach is quite powerful and gives rise to a fully formed theory of regular functions , it has some significant flaws .",
    "one such is the fact that even the functions @xmath46 fail to be regular ( they are non - harmonic , since , for example , @xmath47 and hence can not be regular ) .",
    "note that the functions @xmath48 are regular @xcite .",
    "another flaw is that the class of regular functions of a quaternion variable do not form an algebra in the same sense that the holomorphic functions do : for example , regular functions can not be multiplied to give further regular functions .",
    "the aim of the paper is to propose a new definition of a derivative for quaternion functions of one quaternion variable and show that all the elementary functions as well as the quaternion logarithm function possess such a derivative .",
    "we also give rules for calculating such derivatives .",
    "we conclude introduction with an incomplete list of references where various applications of quaternions are discussed @xcite .",
    "we begin by the following    [ d2.1]_a quaternion function @xmath3 , @xmath34 , defined on some neighborhood @xmath49 of a point @xmath50 , is called @xmath0-_differentiable at _",
    "@xmath51 if there exist two sequences of quaternions @xmath52 and @xmath53 such that @xmath54 is finite and that the increment @xmath55 of the function @xmath3 can be represented as @xmath56 where @xmath57 and @xmath58 . in this case , the quaternion @xmath54 is called the @xmath0-_derivative of the function @xmath43 at the point _ @xmath51 and is denoted @xmath59 .",
    "thus @xmath60 _    the uniqueness of the @xmath0-derivative follows from the fat that the right - hand part of , if it exists , is just the partial derivative @xmath61 of @xmath3 at @xmath51 with respect to its real variable .    in the sequel ,",
    "the symbol @xmath62 denotes any function @xmath63 satisfying .",
    "[ r1.1 ] note that the same definition still makes perfectly good sense for any map between banach algebras . moreover , all the proofs of our results remain valid ( except for proposition [ p3.5 ] , which still remain true if we take @xmath64 to be invertible in a neighborhood of @xmath51 ) , since they require only those properties of @xmath0 which are also possessed by any banach algebra .",
    "the following functions introduced by hamilton    @xmath65    are the _ basic elementary quaternion functions of one quaternionic variable  @xmath24_.    let us now show that the basic elementary functions are @xmath0-differentiable .",

    "_    @xmath91 therefore @xmath92 hence @xmath93    similarly , one has    [ p2.6]_the equality @xmath94 is valid . _",
