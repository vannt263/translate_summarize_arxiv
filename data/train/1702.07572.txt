    "in the present paper , we study the exclusive @xmath0 process : @xmath7 in general , the number of possible mechanisms is rather large . here",
    "we shall focus on the triple - regge exchange processes . according to our knowledge",
    "such processes were not discussed quantitatively in the literature and estimation of their importance becomes timely in the light of studies being performed by the star , atlas , cms and alice collaborations . at the lhc",
    "the energy is so high that there is enough rapidity span for such processes to occur , at least from the theoretical point of view .    in this study",
    "we present an extension of the regge - inspired lebiedowicz - szczurek approach used for the reactions : @xmath8 @xcite , @xcite , @xmath9 @xcite and @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "the number of diagrams for the six - body reactions is bigger than for the four - body reaction and we have to carefully write the corresponding amplitudes using , however , simplified regge rules for @xmath11 and @xmath12 interactions .",
    "we shall try to use the same model parameters as for the @xmath13 whenever possible .",
    "this should allow for an approximate estimation of the cross section and some differential distributions .",
    "the calculation presented here is performed with the help of the genex monte carlo event generator @xcite .",
    "we wish to concentrate on the four charged pion continuum production mechanism which , in addition , is a background for studies of central exclusive production of resonances discussed recently in @xcite .",
    "the production of glueball states is expected to be enhanced in gluon rich pomeron - pomeron interactions .",
    "identification of diffractively produced glueball states is still an experimental challenge at the lhc . for experimental point of view at lower energies see e.g. @xcite .",

    "the parameter of the off - shell form factor(s ) is in principle a free parameter . in the present paper",
    "we shall use @xmath46 gev ( lower limit ) and use @xmath47 gev ( upper limit ) .",
    "these values correspond to @xmath48 gev and @xmath49 gev in the convention used in @xcite .",
    "the amplitudes ( [ amplitude_for_ppi_subproces ] ) and ( [ amplitude_for_pipi_subproces ] ) have to be corrected ( cut off ) for low @xmath50 as the regge theory is valid only above a lower subenergy limit . in our analysis here mainly a smooth cut - off function will be used , as in @xcite , e.g. , @xmath51 with @xmath52  gev and @xmath53  gev , which cuts off @xmath54  gev@xmath55 smoothly .",
    "another cut - off function which we use is the heaviside theta function : @xmath56 where @xmath57 is a parameter to be adjusted to future precise data .",
    "we will show that both functions , see ( [ smoothcut ] ) and ( [ smoothcut ] ) , give similar results for the integrated cross section , however , somewhat different distributions in some special variables .",
    "in this section we show some predictions for the considered process .",
    "we will select @xmath58  tev collision energy as a representative example .",
    "the collision energy dependence of the cross section is rather weak ( see section [ subsection:13tev ] ) .",
    "presentation of our results is divided into three parts : + ( a ) calculation for the full six - body phase space , + ( b ) calculation relevant for the atlas main tracker , + ( c ) calculation relevant for the alice main tracker .    in a separate section",
    "we discuss some general specific aspects of the discussed here mechanism .",
    "some technical details related to the monte carlo integration are described in appendix [ a ] .      in this subsection",
    "we present some results for cross section calculation which we call `` full phase space '' meaning that only minimal cuts are imposed for purely technical reasons , namely @xmath59    these cuts can be easily placed in experimental analyses and do not change the shape of the resulting distributions .",
    "the condition @xmath60 cuts off less than a few percent of the cross section .",
    ".full phase space cross sections in @xmath3b .",
    "no absorption effects are included here . [ cols=\"<,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tab : crosssection13tev ]    the table shows that the transfer of energy to the system is slowly varying with the collision energy .",
    "therefore all plots presented in the previous sections do not differ dramatically for the case of @xmath61  tev .",
    "the only sizeable difference is that in the rapidity plots the protons are a bit further from @xmath62 . summing up , the model cross section is only weakly dependent on the centre - of - mass energy .",
    "the triple - regge exchange model was proposed for the production of four - pions in the @xmath63 exclusive reaction .",
    "the amplitudes of the process were parametrized in the regge formalism with coupling constants fixed to describe the total nucleon - nucleon and pion - nucleon cross sections .",
    "some care must be taken how to remove the low dipion invariant mass regions ( @xmath64  gev ) that are not described by regge amplitudes    in the considered process two of the pions are off - mass - shell already in the born amplitude(s ) .",
    "the off - shell effects are parametrized in terms of corresponding form factors .",
    "the same objects ( form factors ) were discussed recently in the context of the @xmath13 reaction considered both theoretically as well as measured by the star , cdf , and cms collaborations @xcite .",
    "the cut - off parameter was fitted then @xcite to describe the preliminary data .",
    "the present dipion data do not allow for a precise extraction of the model parameter but allow to obtain a reasonable range of the cut - off parameter @xmath65 = 1  1.5 gev .",
    "here we have assumed exponential dependence of the form factors on the pion virtualities .",
    "then the model has almost only one free parameter ( called here cut - off parameter ) , which can be taken in the range known from the four - body ( @xmath13 ) reaction studied in the literature . in comparison to the four - body reaction the dependence on the cut - off parameter is much stronger as two pions , instead of one for the @xmath66 process , are off - mass - shell .",
    "we have made first predictions for the six - body processes .",
    "both total cross sections ( integrated over six - body phase space ) as well as several differential distributions were calculated and presented . compared to the @xmath5 and @xmath6 mechanisms considered recently by two of us @xcite , the considered here mechanism populates final states with much larger dipion and four - pion invariant masses .",
    "we get total cross section 7.21  42.86  @xmath3b ( see tab . [",
    "tab : crosssection13tev ] ) in the whole phases space ( neglecting absorption effects ! ) .",
    "the absorption effects are expected to diminish the cross section by an order of magnitude .",
    "our preliminary studies here have been done at the born level and the absorption can be included only in the form of the multiplicative gap survival factor .",
    "one expects it to be of the order of 0.1 .",
    "full - fledged calculation of absorption effects and in particular its dependence on kinematical variables is not simple ( see , e.g. , @xcite for detailed studies for the @xmath13 reaction ) .",
    "the integrated full phase space cross section can not be , however , measured due to limited coverage of the lhc detectors .",
    "we have therefore made predictions for the kinematical cuts characteristic for the atlas and alice detectors .",
    "the latter detector can identify pions down to very small transverse momenta of @xmath67 = 0.1 gev .",
    "however , the rapidity coverage of the alice tracker is very ( too ) limited .",
    "this does not allow to observe the large four - pion invariant masses , the genuine feature of the considered diffractive triple - regge mechanism .",
    "in contrast , the atlas detector allows to measure cases with large @xmath68 invariant masses .",
    "we expect that the considered multi - diffractive process dominates over the contributions of other mechanisms for four - pion invariant masses @xmath4  gev .",
    "we have discussed in addition how much energy can be transferred from protons to the excitation of the four - pion system .",
    "we have demonstrated that the model amplitude gives natural limitations for such a transfer .",
    "a specific ordering of pion charges in rapidity has been found to be an interesting and representative characteristics of the discussed process .    to assure exclusivity of the process , not only charged pions but also forward / backward protons",
    "should be measured .",
    "the alfa detectors are natural candidates for this purpose in the case of the atlas experiments .",
    "similarly the cms collaboration together with the totem collaboration could perform similar studies .    in summary ,",
    "the observation of counts / events at large four - pion invariant masses should be a clear signal of observing the discussed here three - pomeron exchange processes , not identified so far experimentally .",

    "in this section ( appendix ) we presents the recipe for generating phase space of the reaction which treats all final pions in the same way and therefore it is suitable for the case when including complicated interferences of contributing amplitudes .",
    "the considered reaction is of the form : @xmath69 and then @xmath70 . the formula for the cross section can be written in the standard form @xmath71 where @xmath72 is a matrix element for the six - body reaction and @xmath73 is a total four - momentum in the initial ( and final ) system .    starting from ( [ sigmageneral ] ) the phase space is factorized as ( see @xcite , eq .",
