    "\\end{array}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the above system was investigated extensively in the last several decades @xcite due to its wide applications in various engineering areas , such as reservoir simulations and exploration of underground water , oil and gas .",
    "existence of weak solutions of the system was obtained by feng @xcite for the 2d model and by chen and ewing @xcite for the 3d problem .",
    "existence of semi - classical / classical solutions is unknown so far .",
    "numerical simulations have been done extensively with various applications , see @xcite and the references therein .",
    "optimal error estimates of a standard galerkin - galerkin method for the system ( [ e - fuel-1])-([e - fuel-4 ] ) in two - dimensional space was obtained first by ewing and wheeler @xcite roughly under the time - step condition @xmath17 . in their method , a linearized semi - implicit euler scheme was used in the time direction and galerkin fem approximation was used both for the concentration and the pressure .",
    "later , a galerkin - mixed finite element method was proposed by douglas et al @xcite for this system , where a galerkin approximation was applied for the concentration equation and a mixed approximation in the raviart  thomas finite element space was used for the pressure equation .",
    "a linearized semi - implicit euler scheme , the same as that used in @xcite , was applied for the time discretization .",
    "optimal error estimates were obtained under a similar time - step condition @xmath17 .",

    "our theoretical analysis is based on an error splitting proposed in @xcite ( also see @xcite ) for a joule heating system with a standard galerkin fem . by introducing a corresponding time - discrete system ,",
    "we split the numerical error into two parts , the error in the temporal direction and the error in the spatial direction .",
    "thus with the solution @xmath25 of the time - discrete system , the numerical solution can be bounded by @xmath26 without any time - step condition .",

  "abstract_text": [
    "<S> in this paper , we study the unconditional convergence and error estimates of a galerkin - mixed fem with the linearized semi - implicit euler time - discrete scheme for the equations of incompressible miscible flow in porous media . </S>",
    "<S> we prove that the optimal @xmath0 error estimates hold without any time - step ( convergence ) conditions , while all previous works require certain time - step restrictions . </S>",
    "<S> our theoretical results provide a new understanding on commonly - used linearized schemes . the proof is based on a splitting of the error into two parts : the error from the time discretization of the pdes and the error from the finite element discretization of corresponding time - discrete pdes . </S>",
    "<S> the approach used in this paper can be applied to more general nonlinear parabolic systems and many other linearized ( semi)-implicit time discretizations . </S>"
