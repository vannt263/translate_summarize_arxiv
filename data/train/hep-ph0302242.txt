    "the very powerful qcd perturbative theory ( pqcd ) is developed in order to describe the hadron processes at high energies .",
    "the scaling and its logarithmic violation are described by the pqcd calculations in the lowest orders of expansion in the strong coupling constant .",
    "coming down in energy more and more powers of the strong coupling constant has to be taken into account .",
    "moreover , in the intermediate energy region the power corrections come into play that are very sensitive to intrinsic hadron structure . typically , the coefficients of the expansion in the coupling constant and in powers of the momentum transfer are the quark - gluon matrix elements taken at hadronic energy scale that have to be found by nonperturbative methods .",
    "these matrix elements are governed by the evolution equations that are determined within pqcd for different hard processes .",
    "these equations start to be applicable at momentum transfer squared of order 1 gev@xmath0 or more where the strong coupling constant becomes small .",
    "so , it is necessary to determine the initial data for the evolution equation which is the nonperturbative problem .",
    "another nontrivial situation arises when at high energy two or more hard scales appear . in that case in order to make predictions reliable it is necessary to resum the soft part of the quark - gluon interaction to all orders .",
    "again the presence of the non - perturbative effects may be important in this energy region .",
    "there are different approaches to treat manifestation of nonperturbative phenomena at high energies : qcd sum rules , lattice qcd , quark models , _",
    "etc_. in this talk we consider few examples of description of the nonperturbative effects in the hadron processes at high energies by applying the instanton liquid model of the qcd vacuum .",
    "instanton liquid model being effective model of the qcd vacuum describes well the hadrons at low as well at intermediate energies .",
    "thus , contact with perturbative qcd results is possible providing the unique information about the quark - gluon distribution functions in the qcd vacuum and hadrons at low energy normalization point .",
    "the various aspects of the instanton induced effects in the high energy hadronic processes had been addressed at the very beginning of the instanton era ( see , _",
    "e.g. _ , @xcite ) . in recent works",
    "@xcite the interest to them has revived and the hope of direct detection of the qcd instanton induced effects has appeared @xcite .",
    "we investigate the role of instantons in diffractive quark - quark scattering , their resummation for the quark form factor and as a model for pion bound state describing the distribution amplitudes in hard exclusive processes .",
    "soft hadronic collisions are described successfully using regge phenomenology , with the pomeron exchange being dominating at high energy .",
    "the pomeron is considered as an effective exchange in the @xmath1 channel by the object with vacuum quantum numbers .",
    "that is why the idea that the nontrivial structure of the qcd vacuum is relevant in describing its mechanism .    to illustrate this",
    "let us consider high energy diffractive quark - quark scattering , where there is hope that for small momentum transfer the nonperturbative effects give dominant contribution .",
    "one of the simplest models of the pomeron is based on the use of exchange by two nonperturbative gluons .",
    "the nonperturbative part of the gluon propagator is given by ( in the feynman gauge ) @xmath2 in the abelian gauge model considered originally by landshoff and nachtmann @xcite the nonperturbative gluon propagator @xmath3 is related to the correlation function describing the gauge invariant gluon field strength correlator ( nonlocal gluon condensate ) .",
    "this correlator in general non - abelian case has form@xmath4",

    "it is this property that has been used in @xcite to relate the pomeron properties to the value of the gluon condensate .",
    "however , in the non - abelian model one has opposite situation .",
    "really , for the qcd instantons we find @xcite @xmath9 and @xmath10 is nonzero . in the realistic model of the qcd vacuum , where the interaction with vacuum fields of large scale , @xmath11 , is important",
    ", the instanton cease to be exact solution of the equations of motion , but the so called constraint instanton approximate solution ( ci ) can be constructed @xcite .",
    "this name is due to necessity to put constraints on the system to stabilize the instanton in the external vacuum medium .",
    "it was shown that the constraint instanton has exponentially decreasing at large distances ( @xmath12 ) asymptotics .",
    "the constraint instanton has topological number @xmath13 as an instanton , however it is not self - dual field .",
    "thus , in realistic qcd small part of @xmath14 appears .",
    "very similar results have been found in the lattice simulations of the gluon field strength correlator @xcite .",
    "thus , within the non - abelian models there is no direct connection between the gluon propagator and the gluon field strength correlator .",
    "so , let us directly consider the instanton part of the gluon propagator .",
    "the fourier transform of the instanton field is defined as @xmath15where @xmath16@xmath17 is the ( constrained ) instanton profile and @xmath18 is the bessel function .",
    "the explicit form of the fourier transform of the pure instanton solution is well known ( in the singular gauge ) @xmath19 , \\ \\",
    "\\ \\widetilde{\\varphi } ^{i}(p^{2})=\\left\\ { \\begin{array}{c } \\frac{i\\left ( 2\\pi \\right ) ^{2}\\rho ^{2}}{p^{2}},\\qquad p^{2}\\rightarrow 0 , \\\\ \\frac{i\\left ( 4\\pi \\right ) ^{2}}{p^{4}},\\qquad p^{2}\\rightarrow \\infty .",
    "\\end{array}% \\right . \\label{phi(p)_singi_as}\\ ] ] the constraint solution saves its form at short distances , but changes it at large ones : @xmath20 where the constant @xmath21 is given by @xmath22now , the fourier transform of the single instanton contribution to the gluon propagator ( in the landau gauge ) becomes @xmath23where the effective instanton density takes into account averaging over the instanton size distribution .",
    "thus , we see again that the gluon propagator and gluon field strength correlator are quite different functions , and the relation between them valid in the abelian gauge model is destroyed in the non - abelian case .    from ( [ phi(p)_singi_as ] ) and ( [ phi(p)_singci_as ] ) it is easy to deduce the asymptotics of the instanton part of the gluon propagator @xmath24    calculating ( in very similar way as in the landshoff - nachtmann model ) at large energy , @xmath25 , the invariant @xmath26matrix element of the quark - quark scattering exchanging by two gluons we get @xmath27 with@xmath28 g\\left [ \\left ( \\overrightarrow{k_{\\perp } } -\\frac{1}{2}% \\overrightarrow{q_{\\perp } } \\right ) ^{2}\\right ] , \\label{it}\\ ] ] where @xmath29 is defined in ( [ gprop_ii ] ) with @xmath30 . except numerical coefficient",
    ", this expression is in agreement with the nachtmann - landshoff formula .",
    "this agreement is due to specific features of the instanton induced interaction .",
    "it is clear from the infrared behaviour of the instanton induced propagator ( [ gprop_as ] ) that @xmath31 ( [ it ] ) is infinite for the pure instanton solution ( [ phi(p)_singi_as ] ) , but it is finite for the constraint instanton solution .",
    "this fact also noted recently in @xcite was one of the arguments to construct constraint instanton that modifies the profile of the instanton at large distances .    from ( [ tmatr ] ) and",
    "the optical theorem it follows that the spin averaged total quark - quark cross section is constant at large energy : @xmath32 these results have been recently generalized in @xcite , where the growing part of the total cross section was also found @xmath33    as was discussed in details in @xcite already this simple model of the pomeron explain many properties of diffractive scattering : the effective vector - like exchange ( [ tmatr ] ) , the additive quark rule and the main features of the total cross section ( [ sconst ] ) , ( [ sgrow ] ) .",
    "one of the important questions in the description of hadronic processes is the behaviour of the vertex functions ( form factors ) at various energy domains .",
    "the present section is devoted to the analysis of the instanton induced corrections to the asymptotic behavior of the color singlet quark form factor at the large momentum transfer within the framework of the instanton liquid model of qcd vacuum .",

    "the kinematics of the process is described ( in minkowski space - time ) in terms of the scattering angle @xmath38 : @xmath39    the consistent rg analysis of the total form factor @xmath40 results in the conclusion that its leading large-@xmath41 behaviour including all the logarithmic corrections is controlled by the universal cusp anomalous dimension and can be expressed in the following form @xcite : @xmath42 \\ ,   \\label{1}\\ ] ] where @xmath43 is the cusp anomalous dimension@xmath44    at high energy the quark receives the eikonal phase during the scattering process off soft gluons .",
    "this effect is expressed in terms of the vacuum average of the gauge invariant path ordered wilson integral @xmath45 in eq .",
    "( [ 1a ] ) the integration goes along the closed contour @xmath46 with cusp .    in the single instanton sector",
    "the wilson integral ( [ 1a ] ) is in the form : @xmath47 @xmath48we omit the path ordering operator @xmath49 in ( [ wi1 ] ) because the instanton field ( [ agen , f ] ) is a hedgehog in color space .",
    "note , that for the instanton calculations , it is necessary to map the scattering angle to the euclidean world by the analytical continuation @xmath50 , and perform the inverse transition in the final expressions in order to restore the @xmath41-dependence . therefore , we find that the instanton contribution to the quark form factor @xcite : f_q(q^2 ) =  .",
    "[ eq : final ] results in a finite renormalization of the next - to - leading logarithmic perturbative term .    in the leading order in instanton field the nonperturbative contribution can be expressed in the form ( here we use the exponentiation of the single - instanton result in a dilute instanton ensemble @xcite ) : @xmath51    in order to estimate the magnitude of the instanton induced effect we consider the standard distribution function supplied with the exponential suppressing factor , what has been suggested in @xcite ( and discussed in @xcite in the framework of constrained instanton model ) in order to describe the lattice data @xcite : @xmath52where the constant @xmath53 , @xmath54 is the string tension .",

    "let us consider the pion form factor for the transition process @xmath69 at space - like values of photon momenta .",
    "the interest to the pion transition form factor has recently revived due to its measuring by cleo collaboration @xcite at large virtuality of one of the photons . theoretically , the pion form factor @xmath70 for the transition process @xmath71 , where @xmath72 and @xmath73 are photon momenta , is related to fundamental properties of qcd dynamics at low and high energies . at zero photon virtualities",
    "the value of the form factor and its slope ( radius ) is estimated within the chiral perturbative theory . in the opposite limit of large photon virtualities",
