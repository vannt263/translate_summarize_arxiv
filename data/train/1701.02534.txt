    "the dynamical and physical properties of the extreme trans - neptunian objects or etnos ( semimajor axis , @xmath6 , greater than 150 au , and perihelion distance , @xmath7 , greater than 30 au , trujillo & sheppard 2014 ) are intriguing in many ways .",
    "their study can help probe the orbital distribution of putative planets going around the sun between the orbit of pluto and the oort cloud as well as understand the formation and evolution of the solar system as a whole .",
    "the first etno was found in 2000 , ( 148209 )  2000  cr@xmath3 , and its discovery was soon recognised as a turning point in the study of the outer solar system ( e.g. gladman et al .",
    "2002 ; morbidelli & levison 2004 ) .",
    "the current tally stands at 21 etnos .",
    "trujillo & sheppard ( 2014 ) were first in suggesting that the dynamical properties of the etnos could be better explained if a yet to be discovered planet of several earth masses is orbiting the sun at hundreds of au .",
    "this interpretation was further supported by de la fuente marcos & de la fuente marcos ( 2014 ) with a monte carlo - based study confirming that the observed patterns in etno orbital parameter space can not result from selection effects and suggesting that one or more trans - plutonian planets may exist .",
    "a plausible multi - planet dynamical scenario was explored by de la fuente marcos , de la fuente marcos & aarseth ( 2015 ) . based on observational data , and analytical and numerical work ,",
    "batygin & brown ( 2016 ) presented their planet nine hypothesis that was further developed by brown & batygin ( 2016 ) , but questioned by shankman et al .",

    ", the pair 4746402013  rf@xmath1 clearly stands out ( de la fuente marcos & de la fuente marcos 2016 ) .",
    "the directions of their perihelia ( those of the vector from the sun to the respective perihelion point ) are very close ( angular separation of 98 ) , their orbital poles are even closer ( 41 ) , and consistently the directions of their velocities at perihelion / aphelion are also very near each other ( 95 ) , although improved values are given in section  3.3 ; in addition , they have similar aphelion distances , @xmath10 ( 589 au vs. 577 au ) . assuming that the angular orbital elements of the etnos follow uniform distributions ( i.e. they are unperturbed asteroids moving in keplerian orbits around the sun )",
    ", the probability of finding by chance two objects with such a small angular separation between their directions of perihelia and , what is more important , also between their orbital poles is less than 0.0001 , which suggests a common dynamical origin .",
    "however , a probable common dynamical origin does not imply a common physical origin . in an attempt to unravel their physical nature ,",
    "visible spectroscopy of the two targets was obtained on 2016 september using the osiris camera - spectrograph at the 10.4  m gran telescopio canarias ( gtc ) telescope , located in la palma ( canary islands , spain ) . here , we present and discuss the results of these observations .",

    "the new observations including spectroscopy , photometry and astrometry and their results are presented in section  3 .",
