    "it is now well established that superconductivity in mgb@xmath0 with the unexpectedly high critical temperature @xmath5k @xcite , is due to strong electron - phonon interaction with in - plane boron vibration modes .",
    "extensive ab - initio calculations @xcite , along with many experimental evidences from stm , point contact , and raman spectroscopy , heat capacity , magnetization and rf measurements @xcite unambiguously indicate that mgb@xmath0 exhibits two - gap s - wave superconductivity @xcite .",
    "mgb@xmath0 has two distinct superconducting gaps : the main gap @xmath6mv , which resides on the 2d cylindrical parts of the fermi surface formed by in - plane @xmath7 antibonding @xmath8 orbitals of b , and the smaller gap @xmath9mv on the 3d tubular part of the fermi surface formed by out - of - plane @xmath10 bonding and antibonding @xmath11 orbitals of b.    the discovery of mgb@xmath0 has renewed interest in new effects of two - gap superconductivity , motivating different groups to take closer looks at other known materials , such as yni@xmath0b@xmath0c and luni@xmath0b@xmath0c borocarbides @xcite nb@xmath12sn @xcite , or nbse@xmath0 @xcite , heavy - fermion @xcite and organic @xcite superconductors , for which evidences of the two gap behavior have been reported . however , several features of mgb@xmath0 set it apart from other two - gap superconductors . not only does mgb@xmath0 have the highest @xmath13 among all non - cuprate superconductors , it also has two coexisting order parameters @xmath14 and @xmath15 , which are _ weakly coupled_. the latter is due to the fact that the @xmath7 and @xmath10 bands are formed by two orthogonal sets of in - plane and out - of - plane atomic orbitals of boron , so all overlap integrals , which determine matrix elements of interband coupling and interband impurity scattering are strongly reduced @xcite .",
    "this feature can result in new effects , which are very important both for the physics and applications of mgb@xmath0 .",
    "indeed , two weakly coupled gaps result in _ intrinsic josephson effect _ , which can manifest itself in low - energy interband josephson plasmons ( the legget mode ) @xcite with frequencies smaller than @xmath16 .",
    "moreover , strong static electric fields and currents can decouple the bands due to formation of interband textures of @xmath17 planar phase slips in the phase difference @xmath18 @xcite well below the global depairing current . in turn , the weakness of interband impurity scattering makes it possible to radically increase the upper critical field @xmath1 by selective alloying of mg and b sites with nonmagnetic impurities .    despite the comparatively high @xmath13 ,",
    "the upper critical field of mgb@xmath0 single crystals is rather low and anisotropic with @xmath19 and @xmath20 of @xcite , where the indices @xmath21 and @xmath22 correspond to the magnetic field * h * perpendicular and parallel to the ab plane , respectively . since these @xmath1 values are significantly lower than @xmath23 t for nb@xmath12sn @xcite , there had been initial scepticism about using mgb@xmath0 as a high - field superconductor , until several groups undertook the well - established procedure of @xmath1 enhancement by alloying mgb@xmath0 with nonmagnetic impurities .",
    "the results of high - field measurements on dirty mgb@xmath0 films and bulk samples has shown up to ten - fold increase of @xmath24 as compared to single crystals @xcite , particularly in carbon - doped thin films @xcite made by hybrid physico - chemical vapor deposition @xcite .",
    "this unexpectedly strong enhancement of @xmath4 results from its anomalous upward curvature , rather different from that of @xmath4 for one - gap dirty superconductors @xcite . as shown in fig . 1",
    ", @xmath1 of mgb@xmath0 c - doped films has already surpassed @xmath1 of nb@xmath12sn , which could make cheap and ductile mgb@xmath0 an attractive material for high field applications @xcite .",
    "[ fig.1 ]    this radical enhancement of @xmath1 shown in fig .",
    "1 is indeed assisted by the features of two - gap superconductivity in mgb@xmath0 .",
    "2 gives another example of @xmath4 for a fiber - textured film @xcite , which exhibits an upward curvature of @xmath4 for @xmath25 .",
    "this behavior of @xmath4 and the anomalous temperature - dependent anisotropy ratio @xmath26 are different from that of the one - gap theory in which the @xmath4 has a downward curvature , while the slope @xmath27 at @xmath13 is proportional to the normal state residual resistivity @xmath28 , and @xmath29 @xcite .",
    "however , the behavior of @xmath4 in mgb@xmath0 can be explained by the two - gap theory in the dirty limit based on either usadel equations @xcite or eliashberg equations @xcite .",
    "= 0.85    = 0.85    the behavior of @xmath4 can be qualitatively understood using a simple bilayer model shown in fig .",
    "3 , which captures the physics of two - gap superconductivity in mgb@xmath0 , and suggests ways by which @xmath1 can be further increased .",
    "indeed , mgb@xmath0 can be mapped onto a bilayer in which two thin films corresponding to @xmath7 and @xmath10 bands are separated by a josephson contact , which models the interband coupling .",
    "the global @xmath4 of the such weakly - coupled bilayer is mostly determined by the film with the highest @xmath1 , even if @xmath30 and @xmath31 are very different .",
    "for example , if the @xmath10 film is much dirtier than the @xmath7 film then @xmath32 dominates at higher t , but at lower temperatures the @xmath10 film takes over , resulting in the upward curvature of @xmath4 . if the @xmath7 film is dirtier , the @xmath10 film only results in a slight shift of the @xmath1 curve and a reduction of the slope @xmath33 near @xmath13 .",
    "the bilayer model also clarifies the anomalous angular dependence of @xmath34 for @xmath35 inclined by the angle @xmath36 with respect to the c - axis ( parallel to the film normal in fig .",
    "3 ) @xcite . in this case",
    "both @xmath37 and @xmath38 depend on @xmath36 according to the temperature - independent one - gap scaling @xmath39 @xcite , but with very different effective mass ratios @xmath40 for each film . because the @xmath7 band is much more anisotropic than the @xmath10 band , @xmath41 , and @xmath42 @xcite , the one - gap angular scaling for the global @xmath34 breaks down .",
    "for example , in the case shown in fig .",
    "3 , @xmath4 is anisotropic at higher t , but at lower t , the nearly isotropic @xmath10 band reduces the overall anisotropy of @xmath1 , so the ratio @xmath26 _ decreases _ as t decreases .",
    "this is characteristic of many dirty mgb@xmath0 films like the one shown in fig .",
    "2 , for which the @xmath10 band is typically much dirtier than the @xmath7 band .",
    "by contrast , in clean mgb@xmath0 single crystals @xmath43 increases from @xmath44 near @xmath13 to @xmath45 at @xmath46 @xcite .",
    "this behavior was explained by two - gap effects in the clean limit @xcite .",
    "3 suggests that @xmath4 of mgb@xmath0 can be significantly increased at low t by making the @xmath10 band much dirtier than the main @xmath7 band .",
    "this could be done by disordering the mg sublattice , thus disrupting the @xmath11 boron out - of - plane orbitals , which form the @xmath10 band . achieving high",
    "@xmath1 requires that both @xmath7 and @xmath10 bands are in the dirty limit . yet , making the @xmath10 band much dirtier than the @xmath7 band provides a `` free boost '' in @xmath1 without too much penalty in @xmath13 suppression due to pairbreaking interband scattering or band depletion due to doping @xcite . in fact , the interband scattering is weak for the same reason that @xmath47 and @xmath48 are weakly coupled , which may enable alloying mgb@xmath0 with more impurities to achieve higher @xmath1 .",
    "systematic incorporation of impurities in mgb@xmath0 has not been yet achieved because the complex substitutional chemistry of mgb@xmath0 is still poorly understood @xcite .",
    "several groups have reported a significant increase in @xmath1 by irradiation with protons @xcite , neutrons @xcite or heavy ions @xcite , but so far the carbon impurities have been the most effective to provide the huge @xmath1 enhancement shown in figs . 1 and 2",
    ". the effect of carbon on different superconducting properties can be rather complex @xcite and still far from being fully understood .",
    "yet given the indisputable benefits of carbon alloying , one can pose the basic question : how far can @xmath1 be further increased ?",
    "the bilayer model suggests that @xmath1 increases if intraband scattering is enhanced .",
    "however , because intraband impurity scattering causes an admixture of pairbreaking interband scattering , the first question is to what extent weak interband scattering in mgb@xmath0 can limit @xmath1 .",
    "another important question is how far is the observed @xmath1 from the paramagnetic limit @xmath49 . in the bcs theory @xmath49",
    "is defined by the condition : @xmath50 , or @xmath51",
    "= 1.86t_c[k]$ ] @xcite , where @xmath52 is the bohr magneton . for @xmath53 ,",
    "this yields @xmath54 t , not that far from the zero - field @xmath55 in figs . 1 and 2 .",
    "however , the bcs model underestimates @xmath49 , which is significantly enhanced by strong electron - phonon coupling @xcite : @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the electron - phonon constant .",
    "taking @xmath58 for the @xmath7 band @xcite , we obtain @xmath59 t , so there still a large room for increasing @xmath1 by optimizing the intra and interband impurity scattering .",
    "for instance , increasing @xmath60 to a rather common for many high field superconductors value of 2t / k ( much lower than @xmath61t / k for pbmo@xmath62s@xmath63",
    "@xcite ) could drive @xmath1 of mgb@xmath0 with @xmath64 above 70 t . in the following we give a brief overview of recent results in the theory of dirty two - gap superconductors focusing on new effects brought by weak interband scattering and paramagnetic effects .",
    "the main conclusion is that , although interband scattering in mgb@xmath0 is indeed weak , it can not be neglected in calculations of @xmath4 .",
    "we will also address the crossover from the orbitally - limited to the paramagnetically limited @xmath1 in a two - gap superconductor .",
    "we regard mgb@xmath0 as a dirty anisotropic superconductor with two sheets 1 and 2 of the fermi surface on which the superconducting gaps take the values @xmath65 and @xmath66 , respectively ( indices 1 and 2 correspond to @xmath7 and @xmath10 bands ) .",
    "although the @xmath7 band is anisotropic , mgb@xmath0 is not a layered material @xcite , so the continuum bcs theory is applicable because the c - axis coherence length @xmath67 is much longer than the spacing between the boron planes @xmath68 .",

    "for example , for the c - doped mgb@xmath0 film shown in fig . 1 , @xmath28 was increased from @xmath320 cm to @xmath321 cm , yet @xmath13 was only reduced down to @xmath322k @xcite .",

    "has already surpassed @xmath1 of nb@xmath12sn ( see fig .",
    "1 ) . given the intrinsic weakness of interband scattering , which enables tuning mgb@xmath0 by selective atomic substitutions on mg and b sites , there appear to be no fundamental reasons why @xmath1 of mgb@xmath0 alloys can not be pushed further up toward the strong - coupling paramagnetic limit ( [ paraeli ] ) .",
    "thus , understanding the mechanisms of intra and interband impurity scattering in carbon - doped mgb@xmath0 , and the competition between scattering and doping effects becomes an important challenge for the computational physics .",
    "for instance , it remains unclear why the multiphased c - doped hpcvd grown films @xcite exhibit higher @xmath1 and weaker @xmath13 suppression @xcite than uniform carbon solid solutions @xcite .",
    "this unexpected result may indicate other extrinsic mechanisms of @xmath1 enhancement , which are not accounted by the simple two - gap theory presented here . among those",
    "may be effects of electron localization or strong lattice distortions in multiphased c - doped films which can manifest themselves in the buckling of the mg planes observed in the dirty fiber - textured mgb@xmath0 films shown in fig . 2 @xcite .",
    "such buckling may enhance scattering in the @xmath10 band formed by out - of - plane @xmath11 boron orbitals .",
    "recently significant enhancements of vortex pinning and critical current densities @xmath325 in mgb@xmath0 @xcite has been achieved , particularly by introducing sic @xcite and zrb@xmath0 @xcite nanoparticles .",
    "given these promising results combined with weak current blocking by grain boundaries @xcite , the lack of electromagnetic granularity @xcite , and very slow thermally - activated flux creep @xcite , it is not surprising that mgb@xmath0 is being regarded as a strong contender of traditional high - field magnet materials like nbti and nb@xmath12sn . despite these achievements , a detailed theory of pinning in mgb@xmath0 is trill lacking .",
    "such theory should take into account a composite structure of the vortex core , which consists of concentric regions of radius @xmath326 and @xmath327 where @xmath328 and @xmath329 are suppressed @xcite . for example , in mgb@xmath0 single crystals the larger vortex cores in the @xmath10 band start overlapping above the `` virtual upper critical field '' @xmath330 , causing strong overall suppression of @xmath331 well below @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "this effect can reduce @xmath325 at @xmath332 , however both @xmath333 and @xmath1 can be greatly increased by appropriate enhancement of impurity scattering in mgb@xmath0 alloys .",
    "recently there has been an emerging interest in microwave response of mgb@xmath0 @xcite and a possibility of using mgb@xmath0 in resonant cavities for particle accelerators @xcite .",
