    "there is well - known theoretical result by haldane @xcite who mapped the spin - chain problem to nonlinear - sigma model ( nl@xmath13 m ) and showed that the cases of integer and half - integer spins differ qualitatively ( for a review see , e.g. , ref .",

    "the so - called topological @xmath14-term in the effective action occurs which leads to unusual magnetic behavior of such chains . as follows from the bethe ansatz solution for @xmath0 ( the same situation holds for any half - integer spin value ) , ground - state in this case already possesses quasi - long - range order .",
    "the excitation spectrum turns out to be gapless and spin correlators have a power - law behavior , but staggered magnetization is zero ( the situation is reminiscent of the @xmath15 model below the kosterlitz - thouless point @xmath16 ) .",

    ", we obtain the self - consistent equation for the sublattice magnetization @xmath67 in the mean - field approximation in the form @xmath68 despite the hamiltonian @xmath69 ( [ hmf ] ) has an one - chain form , calculation of the function @xmath70 ( which is an analog of the brillouin function in the usual mean - field theory of heisenberg magnets ) at arbitrary @xmath71 is a very complicated task .",
    "scaling arguments suggest @xmath72 with some scaling function @xmath73 for @xmath74 ( in this case we have a standard sine - gordon , or , equivalently , massive thirring model ) @xmath70 was calculated by bethe ansatz in ref.@xcite .",

    "the reason of this is that the mean - field approximation does not take into account the collective excitations which substantially contribute to the thermodynamic properties .",
    "such excitations can be considered within the random - phase approximation ( rpa ) .",
    "the rpa spin susceptibilities are given by @xcite    [ hirpa ] @xmath94 where , for the square lattice in the direction transverse to chains ,    @xmath95    @xmath96 being the dynamical staggered susceptibility for the model ( [ hmf ] ) and we have taken into account only staggered components of the susceptibility .",
    "again , @xmath96 is given by simple analytical expressions only in two cases : @xmath75 ( for the results see ref.@xcite and also appendix c ) , and @xmath78 where we have @xcite for both the susceptibilities",
    "@xmath97 as it should be , @xmath98    now we can calculate the spin - fluctuation corrections to interchain mean - field theory owing to collective modes .",
    "similar to the case of the simplest mean - field approximation in the theory of heisenberg magnets @xcite , these corrections can be obtained within the @xmath41-expansion .",
    "since we treat only transverse neighbors within the mean - field approach , one has to speak about the @xmath1-expansion . to construct this expansion , we consider the perturbation theory in @xmath99 ( see appendix a ) , which is an analog of expansion in @xmath100 for three - dimensional heisenberg magnets @xcite . from this viewpoint ,",
    "the above - discussed mean - field approximation is just the zeroth - order in @xmath101 so that the fluctuation corrections to this approximation can be obtained in a regular way .",
    "the leading ( first order in @xmath1 ) corrections come from the diagrams which include one rpa - interaction line .",

    "numerical calculation for @xmath39 case ( simple cubic lattice ) yields @xmath107 thus , with account of the function @xmath108 the lowering of @xmath5 due to interchain fluctuation effects is about @xmath6 of its mean - field value .",
    "for @xmath39 the integral in ( [ v ] ) is divergent and we have @xmath109    the same result ( [ tn ] ) can also be derived in a more elegant way within the spin - fluctuation approach by moriya @xcite ( see appendix b ) .",
    "corrections to the ground - state staggered magnetization are calculated in appendix c. we have @xmath110 where the last term in the brackets represents the @xmath1 correction with @xmath111 note that we do no take into account the logarithmic corrections owing to presence of the marginal operator , since there exists no simple ways of calculating dynamical staggered susceptibility at @xmath75 in the presence of such an operator .",
    "however , one can see that we have nearly @xmath112 lowering of @xmath3 for @xmath37 and only @xmath113 lowering for @xmath114 thus the fluctuation corrections to ground - state magnetization are much less important than those to the neel temperature , and in the three - dimensional case they can be neglected .",
    "the results obtained enable one to perform quantitative comparison with experimental data on magnetic chain systems . consider first the compound kcuf@xmath9 with @xmath0 . according to ref.@xcite",
    ", we have @xmath115 k , @xmath116 as discussed by schulz @xcite , this value of @xmath22 corresponds to @xmath117 so that @xmath118 k. the simplest mean field approximation ( [ tnmf ] ) yields @xmath119k . from ( [ tn ] )",
    "we obtain @xmath120 k which is somewhat lower in comparison with the experimental result of ref.@xcite , @xmath121 k. thus our approximation slightly overestimates the effects of fluctuations , but improves reasonably the mean - field approximation .",
    "contribution of the double - logarithmic term in ( [ l ] ) makes up about @xmath122 percents and improves the agreement with the experimental data .",
    "another @xmath0 chain compound that is widely discussed in recent publications is sr@xmath8cuo@xmath9 which has the following parameters @xcite : @xmath123k , @xmath124k .",
    "direct experimental data for @xmath125 are absent , but using ( [ tn ] )  and the experimental value of @xmath5 we obtain @xmath126k .",
    "then we have from ( [ s0 ] ) @xmath127 which is in agreement with the experimental data ( @xmath128 ) .    for ca@xmath8cuo@xmath9",
    "the experimental parameters have following values @xcite : @xmath129 @xmath123k and @xmath130k . from ( [ tn ] )  we find @xmath131 k and @xmath132 .",
    "taking into account above results for sr@xmath8cuo@xmath9 we find that the latter value is again in excellent agreement with the experimental data @xcite which give @xmath22(ca@xmath8cuo@xmath9)/@xmath3(sr@xmath8cuo@xmath9 ) @xmath133 .",
    "thus the result ( [ tn ] ) is sufficient to describe quantitatively real quasi-1d magnetic systems .    in the isotropic quasi-1d magnets under consideration ,",
    "the fluctuation corrections modify only numerical factor in the expression for @xmath134 one can expect , however , that in the anisotropic case the form of functional dependence @xmath135 will be also modified .",
    "the influence of anisotropy on the neel temperature will be considered elsewhere .",
    "another interesting question concerns quasi-1d magnets with half - integer spins @xmath136 as discussed in the introduction , in this case there is a crossover from `` usual '' spin - wave behavior of staggered magnetization to non - spin - wave one . the expressions for @xmath5 should be also changed because of this crossover .",
    "finally , despite the standard spin - wave theory yields a qualitatively correct description of integer - spin magnetic chains , the corresponding values of neel temperatures are also overestimated in comparison with experimental data . thus calculation of fluctuation corrections for these magnets is also of interest .",
