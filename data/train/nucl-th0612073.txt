    "the experimental efforts presently performed at the new generation of radioactive ion beam facilities in particular the rare isopote accelerator ( ria ) in usa , the international accelerator facility for research with anti - proton ions at gsi in germany , and the radioactive ion beam factory ( ribf ) in japan , will boost the nuclear structure studies of exotic nuclei .",
    "one of the central challenges of theoretical nuclear physics is the attempt to describe these unknown properties of the exotic systems in terms of a realistic nucleon - nucleon ( nn ) interaction . in order to calculate matrix elements with this singular interaction we have to define effective correlated hamiltonians .",
    "correlation effects in nuclei have been first introduced in nuclei by villars  @xcite , who proposed the unitary - model operator ( umo ) to construct effective operators . the method was implemented by shakin  @xcite for the calculation of the g - matrix from hard - core interactions .",
    "non perturbative approximations of the umo have been recently applied to odd nuclei in ref .  [ 3 ] and to even nuclei in ref .  [ 4 ] .",
    "the basic formulas of the dynamic correlation model and of the boson dynamic correlation model ( bdcm ) presented in the above quoted papers have been obtained by separating the n - body correlation operator in short- and long - range components .",
    "the short - range component is considered up to the two body correlation while for the long range component the three and four body correlation operators have been studied .",
    "the extension of the correlation operator to high order diagrams is especially important in the description of exotic nuclei ( open shell ) . in the short range approximation",
    "the model space of two interacting particles is separated in two subspaces : one which includes the shell model states and the other ( high momentum ) which is used to compute the g - matrix of the model .",
    "the long range component of the correlation operator has the effect of generating a new correlated model space ( effective space ) which departs from the originally adopted one ( shell model ) .",
    "the amplitudes of the model wave functions are calculated in terms of non linear equation of motions ( eom ) .",
    "the derived systems of commutator equations , which characterize the eom , are finally linearized . within these generalized linearization approximations ( gla )",
    "we include in the calculation presented in the paper up to the ( ( n+1)p1h ) effective diagrams .",
    "the linearized terms provide , as explained later in the text , the additional matrix elements that convert the perturbative umo expansion in an eigenvalue equation .",
    "the n - body matrix elements needed to diagonalize the resulting eigenvalue equations are calculated exactly via the cluster factorization theory ( cft ) .",
    "+ within the present treatment of the correlation operator one generates in the n - body theory not only the ladder diagrams of ref .",
    "@xcite but also the folded diagrams of kuo see ref .",
    "in order to describe the structures and the distributions of nuclei we start from the following hamiltonian : @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the singular nucleon - nucleon two body potential . since the matrix elements @xmath3 are uncorrelated the matrix elements of @xmath2 are infinite .",
    "this problem can be avoided by taking matrix elements of the hamiltonian between correlated states . in this paper",
    "the effect of correlation is introduced via the @xmath4 method . in dealing with very short range correlations",
    "only the @xmath5 part of the correlation operator needs to be considered .    following ref .  [ 2 ] we therefore calculate an `` effective hamiltonian '' by using only the @xmath5 correlation operator obtaining : @xmath6 where @xmath7 refers to the long - range part of the nucleon - nucleon force diagonal in the relative orbital angular momentum , after the separation  @xcite : @xmath8 the separation is made in such a way that the short range part produces no energy shift in the pair state  @xcite .",
    "in doing shell model calculation with the hamiltonian eq .",
    "( [ eq.1 ] ) , we remark : a ) only the long tail potential plays an essential role in the calculations of the nuclear structure i.e. : the separation method and the new proposed @xmath9  @xcite method show a strong analogy and b ) the @xmath10 must be included as an additional re - normalization of the effective hamiltonian eq .",

    "( [ eq.3 ] ) u(r ) is generated as in ref .",
    "@xcite by a separation distance calculation for the central part of the force in the @xmath16 state .",

    "we propose to calculate the ground state of @xmath19h , @xmath19he , and @xmath20he within the eom method which derive the eigenvalue equations by working with the @xmath21 operator on the wave functions of the a=3,4 nuclei .",

    "( [ e2 ] ) we introduce the cft  @xcite which factorizes the three particle states in combination of pairs .",
    "for the two particles we distinguish between two spaces : 1 ) effective valence space which is used to diagonalize the eom and 2 ) complementary high excited single particle space which is used to compute the g matrix . within this method we can use either the shakin - yale matrix elements of ref .",
    "@xcite with b=1.50 fm or the @xmath25 matrix elements  @xcite . from the diagonalization of the eigenvalue equation of the three particles ,",

    "( [ e2 ] ) to a four particle state we obtain for the ground state of @xmath20he the binding energy of e=28.39 mev . from the the ground state wave functions calculated with the two - body potential of ref .",
    "@xcite ( b=1.50 fm ) and with the @xmath25 matrix elements  @xcite evaluated with the bonn potential  @xcite we obtain the two distributions given in fig .",
    "the distributions and the radii of 1.709 fm and 1.71 fm look similar .",
    "in dealing with complex nuclei however the ( @xmath27 ) correlations should also be considered .",
    "the evaluation of these diagrams is , due to the exponentially increasing number of terms , difficult in a perturbation theory .",
    "we note however that one way to overcome this problem is to work with @xmath28 operator on the slater s determinant by keeping the n - body hamiltonian uncorrelated . via the long tail of the nuclear potential",
    "the slater determinant of the `` n '' particle systems are interacting with the excited slater s determinants formed by the ( `` n '' particles+(mp - mh ) mixed - mode excitations ) .",
    "the amplitudes of the different determinants are calculated via the eom method .",
    "after having performed the diagonalization of the n - body hamilton s operator we can calculate the form of the effective hamiltonian which , by now , includes the complete set of the commutator equations . for odd particle systems we use the well established formalism of ref .",
    "[ 3 ] .      in the following",
    "we present the theory for even `` dressed '' particles . in order to define the eigenvalue equations for the nuclear modes we start by defining the two particle operator as following : @xmath29^j_m|0\\rangle,\\ ] ] we calculate then the commutator equations : @xmath30|0\\rangle=\\sum_{\\beta_{1 } } \\omega(2p|2p ' ) a^{\\dagger}_1(\\beta_1j)|0\\rangle+   \\sum_{\\beta_2j'_1j'_2 } \\omega(2p|3p1h ) a^{\\dagger}_2(\\beta_2j'_1j'_2j)|0\\rangle.\\ ] ] and @xmath31|0\\rangle }   \\\\ \\displaystyle { = \\sum_{\\beta_{2}j'_1j'_2 } \\omega(3p1h|3p'1h ' ) a^{\\dagger}_2(\\beta_2j'_1j'_2j)|0\\rangle+ \\sum_{\\beta_{3}j'_1j'_2j'_3 } \\omega ( 3p1h|4p2h ) a^{\\dagger}_3(\\beta_3j'_1j'_2j'_3j)|0\\rangle } , \\end{array}\\ ] ] which define the dynamic evolution of the valence modes . in eqs .",
    "( [ e34],[e8 ] ) the @xmath32 operators are defined below : @xmath33 the additional commutator equations which involves the @xmath34 and the higher order operators are here not given .",
    "the obtained commutator chain is suitable to be solved perturbatively by inserting the @xmath35-th commutator in the @xmath36-th commutator , @xmath36-th commutator in the @xmath37-th commutator ,  the second commutator in the first . within this perturbative",
    "approach one defines effective hamiltonians of the model which , due to the increasing degree of complexity , are not easily solvable . much simpler solutions to the commutator equations may , however , be obtained in the bdcm model .",
    "we start by remarking that in the study of low lying excitations of the n - body systems the higher order components of the wave functions , which involve n valence - and ( 2p-2h ) core - excitations are poorly admixed in the model space and can be linearized .",
    "this linearization consists by applying the wick s theorem to the @xmath34 terms and by neglecting the normal order diagrams .",
    "the linearization generates the additional terms that one needs to convert the commutator chain in the corresponding eigenvalue equation , as can be obtained by taking the expectation value of the linearized eqs .",
    "( [ e34 ] ) , and  ( [ e8 ] ) between the vacuum and the model states .      for three `` dressed '' particles",

    "( [ e35 ] ) , and  ( [ e35a ] ) between the vacuum and the excited states .",
    "the generalization of the commutator equations to `` n '' valence particles can be simply derived in the analogous way and is not given .",
    "within these approximations the model commutator equations are suitable to be restricted to a finite space .",
    "the linearized system of the commutator equations is then solved exactly in terms of the cft  @xcite which calculates the n - body matrix elements of one- and two - body operators .",
    "in order to perform structure calculations , we have to define the cmwfs base , the `` single - particle energies '' and to choose the nuclear two - body interactions .",
    "the cmwfs are defined as shown in appendix a by including mixed valence modes and core - excited states .",
    "the base is then orthonormalized and , since the single particle wave functions are harmonic oscillators , the center - of - mass ( cm ) is removed .",
    "one can generate the cm spurious states according to ref .",
    "@xcite and evaluate the overlap between these states and the nuclear eigenstates of the model ( see appendix b ) .",
    "model components having with the corresponding cm components an overlap greater than 10% are treated as spurious states and discarded .",
    "the single - particle energies of these levels are taken from the known experimental level spectra of the neighboring nuclei  @xcite .",
    "for the particle - particle interaction , we use the g - matrix obtained from yale potential  @xcite .",
    "these matrix elements are evaluated by applying the @xmath42 correlation operator , truncated at the second order term of the expansion , to the harmonic oscillator base with size parameter b=1.76 fm .",
