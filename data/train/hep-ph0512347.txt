    "in 1995 , the cleo collaboration found a hump in the low momentum region of the inclusive spectrum of @xmath7 decay @xcite . later on ,",
    "this observation was confirmed by belle @xcite and babar @xcite . in these measurements",
    ", there is an excess in the momentum spectrum of the @xmath1 recoiling mass at @xmath8 . and",
    ", the excess corresponds to a branching ratio of @xmath9 . in order to explain this result ,",
    "various hypotheses have been proposed @xcite .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , chang and hou employ the idea of intrinsic charm @xcite @xmath10 inside the @xmath2 meson to this issue .",
    "based on this scenario , they predicted that the branching ratio of @xmath11 should be about @xmath12 .",
    "however , according to recent babar and belle measurements , the branching ratio upper limit of this process is less than @xmath13 @xcite , which implies that the intrinsic charm mechanism is not favored . in another scenario , in which the charmonium is produced predominantly in the color - octet mechanism , eilam and",
    "yang estimated the branching ratio of @xmath11 @xcite and got a result of about @xmath14 .",
    "however , in the collinear factorization , they have to use a cut - off or @xmath15-function to tame the end - point singularity .",
    "hence , their numerical results are not stable .",
    "the recent progress in perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) treatment , based on the @xmath5 factorization , of @xmath2 meson decays can solve this problem by introducing the sudakov form factor through the threshold resummation .",
    "now , the pqcd approach @xcite has become one of the broadly used theoretical methods in investigating the @xmath2 meson two - body non - leptonic decays .",
    "base on the pqcd approach , many @xmath2 meson decay modes have been calculated , like @xmath16 @xcite , etc . , and most results are consistent with the experimental data . since there is no end - point singularity , the pqcd approach can also be applied to the pure `` annihilation processes '' , such as @xmath17 @xcite .    in this work ,",
    "we calculate the @xmath18 and @xmath19 processes in the pqcd @xmath5 factorization . in the decay of @xmath11 ,",
    "the @xmath20 boson exchange induces the four quark operator @xmath21 , and an additional pair of @xmath22 is created by a gluon .",
    "this gluon can attach to any quark involving in the four - quark operator . in the rest frame of @xmath2 meson ,",
    "the produced @xmath23 and @xmath24 quarks in the final states have the momenta of order @xmath25 and @xmath26 , respectively .",
    "therefore , the gluon , which generates the charm quark pair , possesses a virtuality of order @xmath27 , which enables the perturbative qcd calculation reliable .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : we present the formalism used in the calculation of @xmath18 and @xmath28 decays in section [ 3 ] . in section",
