    "the research of late time evolution of the universe has also assumed eos of the type given by eq.([eos ] ) motivated by the fact that the constraints from the observational data implies @xmath30 for the eos of the dark energy component if it assumed ruled by a barotropic eos , but the values @xmath31 , corresponding to a phantom fluid , or @xmath32 , corresponding to quintessence can not be discarded .",
    "also theoretical studies like the so called running vacuum energy in qft ( see  @xcite ) gives rise to a cosmological constant with a dynamical evolution during the cosmic time , so eos of the type given in eq.([eos ] ) could represent effectively the results of this approach under some specific assumptions .",
