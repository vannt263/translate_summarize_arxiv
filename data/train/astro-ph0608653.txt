    "the source sax j2103.5 + 4545 has a variable pulse profile which affects the pulse timing . in order to estimate the errors in the arrival times , the light curve of each rxte observation",
    "was sampled into approximately 4 - 5 equal subsets and new arrival times were estimated .",
    "the standard deviation of the arrival time delays obtained from each subset of the observation was taken to be the uncertainty of the arrival time of that observation .",

    ", we present refined orbital parameters and their uncertainties .    using this new refined orbital parameters , we regenerated the pulse phases and constructed the pulse frequency time series for all rxte / pca observations .",
    "for the estimation of pulse frequencies , we made linear fits to the phase offsets ( @xmath46 ) with nearly one orbital period resolution .",
    "these are presented in figure 3 .",
    "we constructed the pulse frequency derivatives by adding a quadratic term @xmath47 to the taylor expansion .",

    "for this purpose we fitted quadratic polynomial to phase offsets at two orbital period time resolution shown at the top panel of figure 4 . from top panel of figure 4 ( between @xmath48 and @xmath49 days ) , our pulse frequency derivative values corresponding to the @xmath50 day interval between mjd 52629.9 and mjd 52761.3 are consistent with the previous pulse period derivative measurement using integral observations ( sidoli et al .",

    "we used the deeter polynomial estimator method ( deeter 1984 ) to derive the power spectrum from the pulse frequency measurements .",
    "this technique uses the polynomial estimators instead of sinusoidal estimates for each time scale t. the power density estimator @xmath51 is defined as @xmath52 where @xmath53 means pulse frequency derivative of given analysis frequency . in order to estimate the power density , we first divided the spin frequency measurements into time spans of duration t and fitted a quadratic polynomial in time .",
    "the observed time series was simulated by a monte carlo technique for a unit white noise strength defined as @xmath54 and fitted with a quadratic polynomial in time .",
    "then the square of the second order term was normalized to the value obtained from monte carlo simulation ( deeter 1984 , cordes 1980 ) .",
    "the logarithmic average of these estimators over the same time intervals is the power density estimate .",
    "this procedure was repeated for different durations t to obtain a power spectrum .",
    "the power due to instrumental noise was subtracted from the estimates and shown independently by cross symbols .",

    "the slope of the power spectrum between 1/1858 and 1/52 @xmath57 yields a power law index 2.13 @xmath2 0.6 .",
    "this is the steepest power law index seen among the hmxrbs ( bildsten et al .",
    "it should also be noted that sax j2103.5 + 4545 is the first transient hmxrb for which the noise power spectrum is constructed .",
    "the power spectrum indicates that at short time scales pulse frequency derivative fluctuations are less noisy . on contrary , at long time scales , pulse frequency derivative noise strengths are stronger .",
    "this could be qualitatively explained by well defined accretion disk at shorter time scales possessing low timing noise therefore power density spectrum becomes more steeper relative the other persistent hmxrbs .",
    "we analyzed 31 pca spectra of sax j2103.5 + 4545 obtained from data corresponding to the same time intervals that were used to calculate the frequency derivatives shown in figure 4 .",
    "spectrum , background and response matrix files were created using ftools 6.0 data analysis software .",
    "we used background subtracted spectra in our analysis .",
    "energy channels corresponding to the 3 - 20 kev energy range were used to fit the spectra .",
    "we ignored photon energies lower than 3 kev due to uncertainties in background modelling while energies higher than 20 kev were ignored as a result of poor counting statistics .",
    "no systematic error was added to the errors .",
    "we fitted the spectra using two models .",
    "the first model consists of an absorbed power law ( morrison & mccammon 1983 ) with a high - energy cutoff ( white et al .",
    "the second model has an additional soft component modeled as a blackbody using bbodyrad model in xspec software with the peak energy freezed at 1.9 kev .",
    "this frozen peak energy is consistent with the previously found value of the soft blackbody component of sax j2103.5 + 4545 ( inam et al .",
    "for both models , an iron line feature at @xmath58 kev was required to fit the spectrum .",
    "the first model was previously found to well - fit the x - ray spectrum of sax j2103.5 + 4545 for the energies higher than @xmath59 kev using rxte ( baykal et al .",

    "our results showed that two spectral models fit almost equally well to the spectrum in 3 - 20 kev band ( see figure 7 ) .",
    "for the model with the blackbody component , cut - off and e - fold energy parameters were found to vary between @xmath60 kev and @xmath61 kev .",
    "for the model without the blackbody component , the same parameters were found to vary between @xmath62 kev and @xmath63 kev .    for the blackbody model , the blackbody normalization was found to vary between @xmath64 km@xmath65 ( 10kpc)@xmath66 .",
    "corresponding blackbody and power law fluxes were found to be correlated with each other .",
    "thus , the total unabsorbed flux was found to be correlated with the blackbody flux .",
    "a correlation between pulse frequency derivative and x - ray flux has been observed in the outbursts of many x - ray pulsar transient systems .",

    "all of these sources have shown correlations between spin - up rate and x - ray flux . among them only sax j2103.5 + 4545 has been observed to have both spin - up and spin - down episodes .",
    "the correlation between spin - up / down and x - ray flux can be explained by accretion from an accretion disk .",
    "both outbursts of sax j2103.5 + 4545 started with a spin - up trend , made a transition to a steady spin rate and then appeared to just begin a spin - down trend ( see figure 4 and baykal et al .",

    ", we present the x - ray flux and pulse frequency derivative correlations including the results found in this paper and in baykal et al .",
    "( 2002 ) .",
    "if the accretion is via an accretion disk then the keplerian rotation of the disk is disrupted by the the magnetosphere at the inner disk edge .",
    "then the plasma is forced to accrete along the magnetic field lines .",
    "the inner disk edge @xmath67 moves inward with increasing mass accretion rate .",
    "the dependence of the inner disk edge @xmath68 on the mass accretion rate @xmath69 may approximately be expressed as ( pringle @xmath20 rees 1972 , lamb , pethick , @xmath20 pines 1973 ) @xmath70 where @xmath71 is the neutron star magnetic moment with @xmath72 the magnetic field and @xmath73 the neutron star radius , g is the gravitational constant , and @xmath74 is the mass of the neutron star . in this equation @xmath75 gives the alfven radius for spherical accretion .",
    "then the torque estimate is given by ghosh & lamb ( 1979 ) as @xmath76 where @xmath77 is the moment of inertia of the neutron star , @xmath78 is the specific angular momentum added by a keplerian disk to the neutron star at the inner disk edge @xmath79 ; @xmath80 is a dimensionless torque which is a measure of the variation of the accretion torque as estimated by the fastness parameter @xmath81 where @xmath82 is the corotation radius at which the centrifugal forces balances the gravitational forces , @xmath83 is the critical fastness parameter at which the accretion torque is expected to vanish .",
    "the critical fastness parameter @xmath83 has been estimated to be @xmath84 0.35 and depends on the electrodynamics of the disk ( ghosh & lamb 1979 , wang 1987 , ghosh 1993 , torkelsson 1998 , li @xmath20 wickramasinghe 1998 , dai @xmath20 li 2006 ) .",
    "the accreted material will produce x - ray emission at the neutron star surface with a luminosity expressed as @xmath85 where @xmath86 is the efficiency factor . from equations 2,3 and 6 ,",
    "the rate of spin - up is related to the x - ray intensity through @xmath87 where @xmath88 is the distance to the source and @xmath89 is the x - ray flux .",
    "the distance of the source from optical observations was found to be @xmath90 kpc ( reig et al .",
    "2004 ; reig et al .",
    "although cyclotron emission has not been seen from this source , the hard spectrum and cut off energy suggests that the magnetic field is greater than @xmath91 gauss ( lutovinov , molkov , & revnivtsev 2003 ; flippova , lutovinov , shtykovsky et al .",
    "2004 ; falanga , di salva , burderi et al .",
    "2005 ; sidoli , mereghetti , larsson et al .",
    "we fitted the ghosh & lamb model setting power law index , magnetic field and distance as a free parameter .",
    "we obtained for the distance to the source @xmath92 kpc and for the magnetic field @xmath93 gauss .",
    "we obtained a power - law index @xmath94 which is consistent with the value 6/7 expected in the model .",
    "the large uncertainty in this power law index shows that radiation pressure dominated accretion disk model with power law index 0.925 is also possible ( see ghosh 1996 ) . since the peak outburst luminosity ( @xmath95erg / sec , assuming a distance of 4.5kpc ) is far below the eddington limit ( @xmath96 erg / sec )",
    ", we consider that gas pressure accretion disk with power law index 6/7 model is the appropriate model for this source .",
    "it is also seen in figure 5 , the points corresponding to spin - up and spin - down are consistent with torque model .    our distance estimate is lower by @xmath97 than the value obtained from optical observations .",
    "the discrepancy could arise from the efficiency factor between accretion x - ray luminosity and observed luminosity .",
    "another factor could be the uncertainty of interstellar absorption coefficient used in optical observations ( see reig et al .",
    "2004 and references therein )    the noise torque fluctuations of accreting x - ray pulsars are subject to both external and internal torques .",
    "the external torques arise from both the accretion of matter from the binary companion and the interaction of the pulsar magnetosphere with accretion disk .",
    "the internal torques arise from the response of the neutron star to these external torques and depend on the interior structure of neutron stars .",
    "however due to the pulse shape noise and consequent instrumental noise , torque fluctuations at short time scales ( or analysis frequencies ) could not be resolved so far ( baykal , alpar , kiziloglu 1991 ; baykal 1997 ) .",
    "bildsten et al . , ( 1997 ) constructed noise power spectra of hmxrbs using batse / cgro pulsar observations .",
    "they found that for vela x-1 , her x-1 , 4u 1538 - 52 and gx 301 - 2 pulse frequency derivative fluctuations ( @xmath98 ) are consistent with a white torque noise model . for oao 1657 - 415 ,",
    "gx 1 + 4 and cen x-3 , they showed that red torque noise for which @xmath98 is proportional to @xmath99 .",
    "our results indicate that for sax j 2103.5 + 4545 @xmath98 is proportional to @xmath100 .",
    "in other words torque fluctuations are characterized as first order random walk in pulse frequency derivatives .",
    "the main reason of this might be the formation of transient accretion disks which leads to the formation of step like torque fluctuations on sax j2103.5 + 4545",
    ". for higher analysis frequencies of @xmath101 , instrumental noise due to the pulse shape fluctuations limits the pulse timing and hence cut - off the torque noise fluctuations .",
    "it was shown for sax j2103.5 + 4545 that there is @xmath102% x - ray flux modulation within the time span of orbital period at the bright part of observations ( see figure 8 of baykal , stark , swank 2000 , and figure 4 of baykal , stark , swank 2002 ) .",
    "assuming that the pulse frequency and x - ray spectra correlations as seen in figure 5 is valid at short time scales in single orbit we estimate the phase offsets using the ghosh and lamb torque model as in @xmath103 @xmath104 .",
    "this phase offset corresponds to the 1/0.0027=358 part of pulse phase .",
    "typical uncertainty of pulse phases is @xmath38 which is much larger than the phase offsets of torque fluctuations .",
    "therefore we could not resolve the torque fluctuations within the orbital period time scale .    from the x - ray spectral analysis of sax j2103.5 + 4545",

    "2004a ) . while fitting the spectra using this model , we fixed the blackbody peak energy at 1.9 kev ( typical value found by inam et al .",
    "2004a ) since our energy range does not cover around 1.9 kev and large uncertainties of this parameter might have arised .",
    "the blackbody component in accretion powered pulsars comes either from the reprocessed emission of the surrounding material or from the polar caps of the neutron stars ( see inam et al . 2004a and references therein ) .",
