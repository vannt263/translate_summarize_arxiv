    "periodic structures driven through a random environment have become a paradigm for the statistical mechanics of non - equilibrium processes .",
    "the beginning of the study of this phenomenon in the context of charge density wave ( cdw ) dynamics was marked by the development of several pioneering and elegant concepts ( see @xcite for a review ) , in particular the description of the depinning transition in terms of critical phenomena @xcite .",
    "yet it was hard to foresee the subsequent growth of what seemed to be a simple although a subtle subject into a fascinating multidisciplinary branch of statistical physics .",
    "the resurgence of interest was related to the discovery of high temperature superconductors ( hts ) where the motivation was driven also by the technological quest for the description of transport properties of hts .",
    "the understanding of the remarkable effects displayed by driven vortex lattice involved a diversity of concepts drawn from various branches of contemporary physics ranging from polymer physics and spin glasses to nonlinear stochastic equations and turbulence , as well as the invention of new concepts of non - equilibrium physics of disordered media ( see @xcite ) . in recent years",
    "much theoretical effort has been expended to advance our knowledge of the driven dynamics of disordered media . yet in spite of impressive achievements there remains a vast amount of fundamental open questions with the depth and subtleties still to be revealed . in this work",
    "we develop a regular approach to the description of periodic media driven through a quenched random environment that will hopefully enable to put subsequent research endeavors on a firm standard basis .",
    "_ statics of disordered elastic periodic systems _",
    "the subtle dynamic properties of dirty media are governed by the interplay among thermal fluctuations , driving force , and quenched disorder . to gain better insight into the dynamics",
    "we first discuss briefly the _ statics _ of weakly disordered elastic periodic systems .",
    "these include cdw , vortex lattices ( vl ) , vortex arrays in josephson junctions , domain walls , dislocations in solids , wigner crystals , and many others .",
    "the common feature of the above systems is that , although the weakness of pinning suggests the purely elastic hamiltonian as a starting point , the disorder - distorted system possesses a huge number of meta - stable states and the ground state is infinitely degenerate .",
    "this dooms to eventual failure direct attacks on the asymptotic large - scale behavior based on a straightforward perturbation theory with respect to disorder .",
    "the first and decisive step for an approach by statistical physics to such systems was made in the remarkable work of larkin @xcite .",
    "the pioneering ideas of this work were later cast into the _ collective pinning theory _ @xcite and basically determined the further development of the field .",
    "it was recognized in @xcite that pinning can be treated perturbatively in the domain of the distorted lattice belonging to a single meta - stable state generated by disorder .",
    "such a coherently pinned domain is called the correlated volume and the pinning energy stored in such a domain determines the crucial characteristic of the pinned system : the critical depinning force .",
    "the key quantity characterizing the system is the degree of distortion of the elastic system by disorder , the _ roughness _",
    "@xmath0 ^ 2\\rangle } $ ] , where @xmath1 is the displacement of a vortex from its undistorted position @xmath2 . within the domain @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the characteristic spatial scale of variations of the random potential",
    ", the pinning force @xmath5 has only a negligible dependence on the displacements @xmath6 .",
    "this implies that this domain is pinned coherently and lies in the single valley of the effective potential landscape of the system .",
    "the roughness within the correlation volume grows as @xmath7 with the so - called wandering or roughness exponent @xmath8 that takes the value @xmath9 in the larkin regime ( @xmath10 is the dimensionality of the lattice ) . since",
    "different larkin domains are pinned independently one could conclude that pinning , however weak , destroys the long - range order of the lattice for @xmath11 .",
    "as soon as the relative displacement of vortices exceeds the disorder correlation length , the spatial variation of the pinning forces becomes important .",
    "the vortices start to feel that they are in a random _ potential _ having many meta - stable states rather than in a random force field .",
    "therefore the perturbative result would overestimate the actual roughness of the lattice .",
    "on intermediate scales where @xmath12 and @xmath13 is the lattice constant the system adjusts itself to the multi - valley potential relief .",
    "this regime is referred to as the random manifold regime @xcite and the roughness exponent becomes smaller than in the larkin regime . on these scales",
    "the periodicity of the medium is not yet of significance .",
    "the region of the largest scales , where lattice displacements exceed the lattice constant , @xmath14 , and the periodic nature comes into play , was first investigated by nattermann @xcite who found , by the renormalization group approach , that at large distances pinning of the vl is equivalent to pinning of cdw and that displacements grow only logarithmically , @xmath15 .",
    "the above results were confirmed later by variational replica approaches @xcite .",
    "structures with logarithmic roughness are well known in the physics of surfaces and 2d crystals .",
    "the logarithmic roughness implies that the system retains its periodic character and bragg peaks in the structure factor @xmath16 , the singularities however have an algebraic character , @xmath17 , ( @xmath18 is a reciprocal lattice vector ) rather than the @xmath19-function - like character as in ordinary crystals or lorentzian character in liquids @xcite .",
    "this algebraic behavior is a characteristic feature of _ quasi - long - range crystalline order_.    the roughness of the lattice structure implies a ruggedness of the potential landscape of the system and the existence of infinitely high barriers separating the different meta - stable states , which is the characteristic feature of glassy systems ( see @xcite ) .",
    "this was realized in a seminal work by m.p.a .",
    "fisher @xcite who identified the vl distorted by disorder as a glassy structure and called it the _ vortex glass_. it is important to stress that the derivation of the above features was based on the _ elastic _ nature of disordered lattices .",
    "the stability of the elastic vortex glass with respect to the formation of topological defects ( dislocations ) was questioned by fisher , fisher and huse @xcite who stated that dislocations are to be generated at the scales where the roughness becomes of order the vortex spacing and that therefore the elastic description of the vortex glass fails . in spite of the fact that the correctness of the arguments of @xcite was questioned in its turn (",
    "the energy of the dislocation formation was underestimated and the logarithmic smoothness of the lattice on large scales was overlooked ) , the image of the vortex glass as a dislocation saturated medium became widespread .",
    "arguments demonstrating the self - consistency of the elastic vortex glass approach ( as long as the disorder is weak enough ) were presented in @xcite .",
    "thus the existence of a weak disorder - induced elastic vortex glass free of topological defects can be considered as well established . recalling that a logarithmically rough medium shows algebraic bragg peaks , giamarchi and le doussal @xcite proposed to call the vortex lattice deformed by disorder a `` bragg glass . ''",
    "this name gained popularity among the specialists and replaced the somewhat compromised `` vortex glass '' in their technical jargon .",
    "the latter terms is now reserved for the topologically disordered vortex solid phase .    _",
    "dynamics of disordered elastic periodic systems _",
    "the main feature of the driven dynamics in a random environment is the existence of the pinning threshold : at zero temperature the system remains pinned if the drive does not exceed a certain threshold value @xmath20 , the critical pinning force , and slides if @xmath21 . at finite temperatures the sharp transition is rounded by thermal fluctuations and is not very well defined .",
    "nevertheless , one can keep the notion of a temperature dependent critical force @xmath22 as the force separating the pinning dominated regime with slow thermally activated dynamics or creep at low force @xmath23 from the fast sliding one at @xmath24 .",
    "motion of the system in the creep regime occurs via thermally activated jumps over energy barriers separating different meta - stable states .",
    "the size of the typical energy barrier as a function of the driving force can be related by scaling arguments to structural features of the system , in particular its roughness .",
    "this was done in @xcite for driven elastic manifolds and it was found that the barriers controlling the motion _ diverge _ algebraically at small driving forces as @xmath25 , where @xmath26 .",
    "the approach of @xcite was extended from continuous media to the creep of vortex lattices in @xcite .",
    "the divergence of the activation barriers implies a non - linear response of the system to small forces and leads to the identification of the low - temperature vortex state as a glassy phase , since such a non - linear response is a hallmark of the glassy system .",
    "the understanding of the critical behavior at the depinning threshold has seen remarkable progress@xcite since the first work by d.s .",
    "fisher @xcite .",
    "the high - velocity sliding of the periodic systems was long considered as the most `` easy - to - understand '' regime .",
    "the outburst of the interest in the flow regime at large driving forces well above the depinning threshold was triggered by the prediction @xcite of dynamic phase transitions between plastic sliding in the nearest vicinity of depinning and coherent motion of the crystalline structure at high drives .",
    "already early experiments @xcite have shown that a moving vortex lattice has a higher degree of crystalline order than a pinned vortex lattice .",
    "these studies have been refined recently @xcite to identify the different dynamical regimes .",
    "the non - equilibrium phase transition predicted in ref .",
    "@xcite is expected to occur in systems with sufficiently strong disorder , where depinning is accompanied by the massive production of topological defects @xcite .",
    "the structural order improves at large driving forces because the system experiences disorder forces that are temporally fluctuating in the moving frame . in this sense",
    "the effect of disorder resembles the thermal noise of a heat bath .",
    "however , this comparison does not carry too far , since the quenched nature of the disorder still implies infinite - ranged spatio - temporal correlations of the effective force in the moving frame .",
    "balents and fisher @xcite used scaling arguments to extend the concept of the non - equilibrium `` freezing '' transition of ref .",
    "@xcite to cdw and have shown that true long - range order is restored at large velocities only in @xmath27 .",
    "thus the critical dimension is reduced by one in comparison to the static case .",
    "for @xmath28 the cdw phase , which is the analog of the vortex displacement , is still rough even even at the largest velocities , whereas a temporal order resulting in narrow - band noise may still persist .",
    "giamarchi and le doussal @xcite addressed the question of spatial large - scale order in the driven vl .",
    "they argued that the transverse periodicity of the system leads to glassy features of the driven phase .",
    "it was argued , in particular , that on the largest scales the driven lattice retains a logarithmic roughness in the directions transverse to the velocity for @xmath29 . in the direction parallel to the velocity",
    "the roughness is expected to be even algebraic as for driven cdw @xcite in contrast to the static case , where roughness is logarithmic .",
    "one of the manifestations of the transverse glassiness suggested according to ref .",
    "@xcite would be the existence of diverging transverse barriers .",
    "this brings to mind the early observation of schmid and hauger @xcite who have performed a lowest - order perturbative calculation for the pinning force and noticed a discontinuity in the transverse i - v characteristic in a sliding state .",
    "notice that in comparison to the equilibrium situation in the absence of driving forces , the approach to the physics at large velocities is even more intricate because of the _ non - equilibrium _ nature of the driven state .",
    "although important predictions about this state have already been formulated , a systematic approach is still lacking .",
    "in this paper we develop such a systematic approach to the driven dynamics of dirty periodic media on the basis of the martin - siggia - rose ( msr ) formalism .",
    "the msr formalism provides a powerful tool to access the largest scales and to treat the immediate vicinity of the depinning transition . although the complete description should include the derivation of renormalization group equations",
    ", we will show that a number of important conclusions concerning the properties of the driven state can be successfully achieved even within the framework of the dynamic perturbative approach . for large velocities @xmath30",
    "the small parameter for the expansion is @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the @xmath10-dimensional spatial integral of the potential correlator of a width @xmath4 , and @xmath33 is the friction coefficient .",

    "the parameters become anisotropic since the velocity identifies a particular spatial direction .",
    "all components of the friction coefficient @xmath35 are found to be _",
    "finite_. therefore glassy features , which in general appear as a divergence of such coefficients , are absent .",
    "the elastic dispersion that reads @xmath36 in fourier space , includes besides elastic constants @xmath37 also stress terms @xmath38 after coarsening .    due to pinning and dissipative effects on spatial scales smaller than the coarse - grained cutoff scale ( with momenta larger than @xmath39 ) , the velocity - dependence of the friction force @xmath40 becomes non - linear .",
    "the fourth term in eq . ( [ eqmo^ * ] ) is a kardar - parisi - zhang ( kpz ) non - linearity @xcite @xmath41 , which is absent in the bare dynamics , is generated by disorder .",
    "it is an anisotopic generalization of the term @xmath42 familiar from surface growth and burger s equation .",
    "the pinning force @xmath43 , which was simply the gradient of a random potential in the bare case , acquires a more virulent random - force character with a correlator    [ phi.xx.0 ] @xmath44    for large velocities @xmath45 with a typical elastic constant @xmath46 .",
    "one sees that the variance of the components perpendicular to the velocity _ diverges _ in @xmath47 as the coarse - graining cutoff @xmath48 .",
    "the effective thermal noise @xmath49 describes in general an effective heat bath with a temperature that is increased due to shaking effects exerted by the pinning on the medium .",
    "[ vartheta.xx.intro ] @xmath50    in the non - equilibrium case this effective `` temperature '' is defined as the integral over the correlator of @xmath49 , that can be distinguished from pinning forces by the temporal decay of its correlations .",
    "the behavior of @xmath51 and @xmath52 is very similar , they show the same type of divergence for @xmath53 . since this divergence comes from small momenta , it is a measure for the strong fluctuations of the medium on _ large _ scales only .",
    "the disorder generated stress couplings @xmath38 , the kpz non - linearities and the random forces are specific non - equilibrium terms that are absent in the equation of motion before coarse - graining .",
    "from the effective equation of motion ( [ eqmo^ * ] ) the displacement fluctuations are found to roughen the medium in dimensions @xmath47 with high anisotropy for directions parallel and perpendicular to the velocity ( which we choose to be parallel to the @xmath54-axis ) .",
    "the anisotropy manifests itself in two distinct features of the displacement correlations : ( i ) the components of the displacement field perpendicular to @xmath55 exhibit stronger fluctuations than the components parallel to @xmath55 .",
    "( ii ) the relative displacement increases faster in perpendicular directions than in the parallel direction .",
    "the former feature , obtained below within perturbation theory for the elastic medium , can be understood qualitatively already from a single - particle picture in analogy to the consideration that led to the notion of the shaking temperature , describing the disorder - induced increase of the effective system temperature @xcite . to this end",
    "we consider a particle moving in a disorder potential @xmath56 with gaussian correlations @xmath57 . a particle starting at @xmath58 moves with an average velocity @xmath59 following an over - damped equation of motion @xmath60 .",
    "the components of its displacement @xmath61 parallel and perpendicular to @xmath55 have a variance that grows differently as a function of time .",
    "when the effect of the pinning forces is integrated over time ( i.e. along the direction of motion of the particle ) , the force component parallel to the direction of motion is `` recognized '' as the gradient of a random potential , whereas the perpendicular components can _ not _ be distinguished from a true random force , since the particle does not explore these directions .",
    "therefore @xmath62 saturates for large times , whereas @xmath63 grows without bounds , like under the influence of thermal noise .",
    "this implies that the shaking temperature @xmath64 is associated with the _ perpendicular _ displacement components .    the second feature of anisotropy , a more rapid growth of the relative displacements @xmath65 in the direction perpendicular to the motion ( i.e. for @xmath66 ) , is related to the size and shape of the dynamic larkin domain , in which the pinning forces act coherently on the elastic medium . since @xmath67 has much weaker fluctuations than @xmath68",
    "the correlation lengths are determined by the fluctuations of @xmath68 alone and are found to be @xmath69 for weak disorder they are finite only in dimensions @xmath47 ( @xmath70 still depends logarithmically on @xmath30 in @xmath71 ) and increase for large velocities much faster parallel than perpendicular to the velocity ( see fig .",
    "[ fig.larkin ] )",
    ".    the next important question of the stability of the lattice with respect to plastic relative displacements of vortices can be captured by a phenomenological lindemann criterion , that examines the fluctuations in the relative distance of neighboring vortices ( bond length ) .",
    "vortices neighboring in a direction parallel to @xmath55 have much weaker fluctuations in their relative position than neighbors in perpendicular directions .",
    "when the relative fluctuations of certain bonds exceed a certain fraction of the vortex spacing , these bonds are expected to be broken by topological defects .",
    "we find that the bonds in directions _ perpendicular _ to the velocity have the strongest fluctuations .",
    "this consideration therefore supports the suggestion that above a certain critical value of the velocity the vl moves coherently like a solid and the topological order of the lattice may be preserved despite of the roughness of the lattice in @xmath72 .",
    "below this critical velocity the motion is plastic and vortices may move in decoupled channels .",
    "it is essentially the anisotropy of the larkin domain that provides decoupling of flowing vortex channels .",
    "[ fig.phases ] summarizes our view of the dynamic phase diagram for the case of sufficiently strong disorder .",
    "starting from highest drives we expect a _",
    "coherent _ motion of the topologically ordered phase . upon decreasing the driving force",
    "the fluctuations of the bonds between the neighboring vortices cause a massive production of topological defects at the transition from coherent to incoherent motion marked by the solid line .",
    "this line corresponds to the freezing transition of @xcite .",
    "the question concerning the nature of the plastically moving phase still remains .",
    "our analysis suggests that there is a tendency to channel formation , but at this point we can not conclude whether these channels remain stable upon a further decrease of the applied force , and therefore dynamic melting describes transition from the moving quasi - crystal to moving smectic @xcite , or directly into the fluid like phase .",
    "the possible transition between the smectic and fluid - like phases is denoted by the dotted line .",
    "the lower strip below the critical current ( the dashed line ) corresponds to the pinned state where the system moves via thermally activated jumps between meta - stable states .    for weak disorder",
    "a dynamic transition from the coherently pinned phase to a coherently moving phase is possible without passing through a plastic regime .",
    "plasticity occurs only at sufficiently high temperature and for small enough velocities . since the anisotropy of the system decreases with decreasing velocity , the width of the smectic regime shrinks in that direction .",
    "in fact it also remains a fundamental open question to what extent the creep regime can be considered as coherent in the sense that the topological order persists up to the largest length scales .",
    "the successful description of this regime by collective pinning requires only the typical distance between free topological defects to increase faster than the size of the largest effective barriers for decreasing creep velocity . in principle",
    "it is possible that only at strictly zero velocity the coherence of the lattice is restored .",

    "while @xmath364 does not reveal a well - defined scaling behavior at large scales since finite temperature and disorder give finite contributions ( in @xmath256 ) , the scaling of @xmath365 is dominated by the disorder contribution with @xmath366 .",

    "the disorder contribution to the force correlator @xmath188 , that tends to increase the roughness , is balanced by the contributions to @xmath226 , notably an increase to the elastic constants that increases the stiffness of the lattice .    for many disordered systems different approaches to treat a balance between several diverging terms",
    "have been fruitful .",
    "one possibility are self - consistent approaches like that of sompolinski and zippelius @xcite which treats the coupling of modes on a mean - field level .",
    "this approach has been applied for example to spin glasses @xcite and elastic manifolds @xcite . however , since typically the self - consistency takes into account only first - order corrections @xmath174 to the action , it can produce only approximate values of scaling exponents . in the present situation",
    "these approaches would completely miss the physics arising from the divergence of @xmath371 .",
    "it would therefore be necessary to extend this scheme to the second - order corrections which make a solution of the self - consistency equations even more involved .",
    "another approach is provided by the renormalization group ( rg ) , that in principle can be extended systematically to arbitrary perturbative order .",
    "a consistent and reliable treatment of the large scale properties requires the simultaneous handling of several complications : ( i ) the anisotropies as discussed above start to interplay under rg interaction with the anisotropies of the friction coefficient , stress coefficients , elastic constants , and kpz terms .",
    "( ii ) since disorder roughens the vl , as seen already within the gaussian approximation , the generated kpz terms are more relevant than the elastic couplings according to scaling arguments .",
    "therefore , a priori they also need to be taken into account and are expected to modify the large scale physics qualitatively as soon as the medium is rough .",
    "the relevance of anisotropies in the kpz terms in the absence of disorder has been studied for _ single _ driven vortex lines by ertas and kardar @xcite , who find a variety of different physical regimes depending on the anisotropy of elastic constants and kpz coefficients , and by hwa @xcite for driven line liquids . for cdw in @xmath377 chen",
    "@xcite find non - trivial scaling exponents ( i.e. differing from the scaling found in the gaussian approximation ) due to the kpz terms also in the presence of disorder .",
    "our discussion has been restricted so far to the elastic approximation , neglecting topological defects ( like dislocations ) in the vortex lattice . upon increasing velocity",
    "all effects of disorder become weaker , and we expect also the length beyond which dislocations become relevant to increase and even to diverge for temperatures below the melting temperature of the pure system . then the interesting question arises : what kind of defects lead at smaller drift velocities to a destruction of the coherence of motion , and what kind of order can survive ?",
    "balents , marchetti , and radzihovsky ( bmr ) @xcite have proposed the existence of a smectic phase where vortices are correlated over much larger distances parallel to the drift velocity than perpendicular to it .",
    "we propose here a picture for the formation of a smectic phase within a phenomenological approach based on a generalized lindemann criterion , examining the relative fluctuations in the distance of neighboring vortices . instead of addressing the topological defects explicitly , we rather focus on their effect , namely the destruction of the neighborhood of vortices .",
    "since the positional fluctuations of neighboring vortices are a small - scale feature , it is sufficient to take into account disorder within the gaussian approximation ( i.e. neglecting the dependence of the pinning force on the vortex displacements ) , the large scale properties of which have been examined in eq .",
    "( [ w.gauss ] ) above .",
    "the disorder contribution to the relative displacement of two neighbored vortices @xmath378 and @xmath379 separated by a bond vector @xmath380 is given by @xmath381 with @xmath353 taken from eq .",
    "( [ c.gauss ] ) .",
    "now one can compare the shaking of a bond parallel to velocity ( @xmath382 ) and `` perpendicular '' to the velocity ( @xmath383 ) . strictly speaking ,",
    "there are no bonds with @xmath384 in a hexagonal lattice , by `` perpendicular '' we mean the bonds making the 60@xmath385 and/or 120@xmath385 angles with the velocity .",
    "this simplified treatment does not change our qualitative conclusions altering slightly only the unimportant numerical factors . in the limit of large velocities",
    "we find    @xmath386    from this result one sees immediately that in this limit the bonds perpendicular to @xmath55 experience much stronger shaking effects than the bonds parallel to velocity .",
    "consequently , these perpendicular bonds linking different channels are expected to break more easily than the parallel bonds .",
    "this implies that the vortex structures has much longer correlations in the direction parallel to the velocity than in the other directions , in agreement with the anisotropy of the dynamic larkin lengths ( [ larkin ] ) .",
    "this result leads to the phase diagram depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig.phases ] that has been discussed already in the introduction .",
    "ultimately it is desirable to have a more systematic approach to the effects of dislocations in the driven medium . a first step in this direction ,",
    "the study of the dynamics of single dislocations , was made in ref .",
    "in order to decide whether _ free _ dislocations destroying the topological order of the lattice are present , it is necessary to study the dynamic stability of dislocation loops ( in @xmath71 ) or of dislocation pairs ( in @xmath279 ) . in particular in @xmath279 one can expect a description of the dynamic phase transition in terms of the kosterlitz - thouless transition @xcite generalized to non - equilibrium systems .",
    "we have constructed a general approach to the driven dynamics of dirty periodic media based on the msr technique .",
    "the developed scheme provides a regular and consistent derivation of the effects of disorder on the sliding motion . at present , however , we have restricted ourselves to the second order dynamical perturbation theory , yet sufficient to draw several fundamental conclusions concerning the high - velocity behavior .",
    "we have derived the coarse - grained equation of motion ( [ eqmo^ * ] ) for periodic media in the presence of disorder . we have found a renormalization of the bare system parameters like friction coefficients , elastic constants , and the friction force within the one - loop approximation as well as new couplings giving rise to the disorder induced stresses , kpz non - linearities and an effective disorder with a random - force character evolving from the original random potential @xcite .",
    "the presence of such terms has been proposed for one - component systems like driven interfaces @xcite and cdw @xcite without analytic derivation .",
    "the appearance of divergent parameters under coarse - graining is much more subtle in the driven system than in the system in equilibrium . for complete coarse - graining ( @xmath53 ) we found a divergence in the correlator of the transverse components of the effective thermal noise @xmath387 and the random pinning force @xmath388 in @xmath47 .",
    "thus in the driven state the upper critical dimension is reduced by one and there are less divergent parameters in comparison to the static case , where also the friction coefficients and elastic constants diverge already in the first order of perturbation theory for @xmath277 .",
    "the divergences in the correlator of the ( persistent and non - persistent ) random force components perpendicular to the drift velocity appear only for systems with a periodic structure transverse to the velocity .",
    "therefore there is a fundamental difference between the dynamic behavior of cdw , which have only one component , and vl with more than one displacement components .",
    "the standard way to test _ glassy properties _ of the systems in question is to examine the large scale behavior of the disorder - induced corrections to the physical quantities , the most marking of which is the friction coefficient .",
    "its divergence is immediately related to an extremely slow dynamics that is dominated by infinitely high barriers . a large - scale divergence of the perturbative corrections",
    "would then indicate the glassy behavior .",
    "however , a divergence of the first order correction to the friction coefficient is _ absent _ in the driven case .    since the vortex system is already in motion , the friction coefficient @xmath389 , which describes the velocity response for a change of the _ amplitude _ of the driving force , has to be finite since the drifting lattice already overcomes the potential barriers in this direction",
    "nevertheless , one could expect that the friction coefficient @xmath390 , which describes the velocity response for a change of the _ direction _ of the driving force , could still diverge due to infinite barriers for a transverse motion of the lattice .",
    "however , since @xmath391 is finite , these barriers can only be finite .",
    "this implies a linear transverse transport characteristic for small transverse forces at finite temperatures .",
    "it is still possible that a true critical force exists at @xmath258 .",
    "but this is not a signature of glassy behavior .",
    "an instructive comparison is provided by a single particle in a sinusoidal potential , which has no glassy properties @xcite .",
    "its transport characteristics has a finite critical force at @xmath258 . for low temperatures it has an exponentially large but finite friction coefficient at small velocities ( due to thermal activation ) that crosses over to the smaller bare friction coefficient at large velocities .",
    "despite of the absence of generic glassy features like the existence of transverse barriers , we find a tendency to form channels directly from the presence of the stress coefficients ( [ chi.xx ] ) in the coarse - grained equation of motion .",
    "to discuss the physical meaning of the effective temperature @xmath51 , it seems appropriate to emphasize that it is actually the _ weight of the noise correlator_. in a system at equilibrium ( and for our bare system ) , @xmath392 is proportional to the product of the temperature @xmath132 and the friction coefficient @xmath33 .",
    "since we have found a finite correction to the friction coefficient , the divergence of @xmath392 can be interpreted as a divergence of the effective temperature . however , in the non - equilibrium situation under consideration , there is no well - defined meaning of a `` temperature . ''",
    "one can speak only about an ( non - unique ) effective temperature if one specifies what physical property of the non - equilibrium system is compared to an equilibrium system . since the divergence of @xmath51 arises from fluctuations on the largest length scales , only the degrees of freedom on asymptotically large scale can be related to an infinite effective temperature .",
    "this means that the driven lattice in the presence disorder is on large length scales much more rough than the lattice in the absence of disorder .",
    "in general , divergent parameters signal a break - down of perturbation theory at large scales .",
    "therefore the question about the asymptotic large - scale behavior of the system can be conclusively addressed only by a systematic rg treatment that includes implicitly all orders of perturbation theory , which goes beyond the scope of this work .    in the absence of a formal derivation ,",
    "we propose the following speculations regarding the existence of ( quasi- ) long - range order at highest driving forces .",
    "it is essential to distinguish between cdw - like systems ( having only one `` displacement '' component ) and vl - like systems ( having more than one `` displacement '' component ) because of fluctuations in the displacement components perpendicular to the velocity . in the cdw case , where there is only the component parallel to the velocity , it has been argued in ref .",
    "@xcite that the random forces along that direction lead to a roughness with an exponent @xmath393 that is not reduced by renormalization effects on the largest scales .",
    "we believe that the situation could be different in the case of vl .",
    "we have shown within the perturbative framework that the perpendicular displacement components fluctuate much stronger than those of the parallel component and are subject to a diverging random force correlator .",
    "in this case one has to take into account that the strong perpendicular displacements wash out not only the perpendicular components of the pinning forces but also the parallel components and therefore qualitatively _ reduce _ the true large - scale roughness in all directions .",
    "this speculation is formally supported by the structure of the perturbative corrections obtained in section [ sec.gen ] . to be specific , we discuss the random force correlator eq .",
    "( [ phi ] ) .",
    "it contains exponential factors @xmath394 that have been neglected in the evaluation in section [ sec.eval ] .",
    "this is legitimate in lowest order perturbation theory , where only thermal fluctuations contribute to @xmath395 .",
    "however , under iterating the perturbative expressions ( this is essentially the idea of an rg ) , one should take into account also the disorder contributions to @xmath257 .",
    "since we have found that disorder roughens the system , @xmath396 diverges on large scales and the exponential factors decay for large @xmath335 , @xmath2 or @xmath82 , suppressing the corrections in comparison to the lowest order perturbative results . in this way all corrections generated by disorder are suppressed , except from the first order correction ( [ phi^1 ] ) that tends to compensate the disorder itself .",
    "one also immediately recognizes that the roughness of the components perpendicular to the velocity ( the large scale behavior of @xmath365 ) influence e.g. the random force correlator @xmath397 in directions parallel to the velocity and vice versa .",
    "this mechanism is the same in all perturbative expressions and , as we believe , coud reduce the true roughness qualitatively in comparison to the perturbative result in @xmath398 for the _ largest _ velocities .",
    "in addition to the aspects of the high - velocity phase we have evaluated our general perturbative results also in the limit of vanishing velocities , when the depinning transition is approached .",
    "we found disorder to be relevant in @xmath277 in agreement with larkin s original static analysis @xcite and dynamic approaches to depinning as a critical phenomenon @xcite .",
    "as an additional feature our perturbative analysis revealed the relevance of the non - equilibrium contributions ( _ diverging _ kpz terms and random - force correlator ) to the equation of motion .    to be specific ,",
    "let us consider the example of the kpz couplings as true non - equilibrium couplings .",
    "it seems surprising that they do not always vanish in the limit @xmath329 , where one naively expects the fdt to hold and all non - equilibrium terms to vanish . to resolve this paradox note that the zero - velocity limit has to be taken with care since it does not commute with the limit @xmath53 .",
    "the observed divergence occurs only if one takes @xmath53 before @xmath329 , since the divergence arises from the infrared contributions to the integration over @xmath399 .",
    "physically these contributions are related to the diverging energy barriers on large scales .",
    "these diverging barriers imply a diverging relaxation time and persistent memory effects of the system , which are the origin of the survival of non - equilibrium terms . in other words , in a glassy system relaxing from a ( globally drifting ) non - equilibrium state into its equilibrium state after switching off the current , there will be regions which are still drifting , their dynamics being governed by an effective non - equilibrium equation of motion . if , on the other hand , one considers the kpz couplings for _ finite _ @xmath39 , they are finite and vanish @xmath304 for velocities @xmath400 . for this reason",
    "these terms have not been taken into account in the previous studies of the depinning transition .",
    "however , the obervation that these non - equilibrium terms diverge at small velocities for @xmath303 could indicate that even for weak disorder the depinning transition is rounded in a very narrow region by rare plastic effects @xcite , which are not captured by the phenomenological lindemann criterion .    in the final stage of preparing this manuscript we became aware of a preprint by bmr @xcite that extends their earlier reference @xcite and where the authors come to similar conclusions .",
    "in addition to perturbative results a rg analysis of a simplified `` toy model '' for the transverse displacement component has been performed , but it does not seem to yield results that differ qualitatively from those obtained by the perturbation theory .",
