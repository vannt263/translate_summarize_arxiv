    "astrophysical models can explain the origin of most nuclei beyond the iron group by a combination of processes involving neutron captures on long ( @xmath14-process ) or short ( @xmath15-process ) time scales @xcite .",
    "however , 32 proton - rich stable isotopes between @xmath16se and @xmath13hg can not be formed in these neutron capture processes , because they are either shielded by stable isotopes from the @xmath15-process decay chains or lie outside the @xmath14-process flow ( fig .",
    "[ p - iso ] ) .",
    "these isotopes , which are ascribed to the so - called `` @xmath1-process '' , are 10 to 100 times less abundant than their @xmath14- and @xmath15-process neighbors .",
    "so far , the astrophysical site of the @xmath1-process is still under discussion , since the solar @xmath1-abundances can not be completely described by current models .",
    "( color online ) example from the chart of nuclides illustrating the position of the lightest @xmath1-nuclei , which are shielded from the @xmath14-process flow and the @xmath15-process decay chains . ]",
    "historically , the @xmath1-process was thought to proceed via proton captures , but a plausible site with the required amount of free protons could not be identified .",
    "moreover , elements with large @xmath17 can not be produced by proton captures because the temperatures necessary to overcome the coulomb repulsion favor photodisintegration rather than charged - particle capture .",
    "the most plausible astrophysical site is the explosively burning ne / o layer in core collapse supernovae , which is heated to ignition temperatures by the outgoing shock front @xcite . in this high - temperature environment",
    "proton - rich nuclei are produced by sequences of photo - dissociations and @xmath18 decays . in stars 20 times more massive than the sun the @xmath1-process temperatures for efficient photo - disintegration",
    "are already reached at the end of hydrostatic ne / o burning @xcite .",
    "this mechanism is also called `` @xmath19 process '' because proton - rich isotopes are produced by ( @xmath20 ) reactions on pre - existing seed nuclei from the @xmath14- and @xmath15- processes .",
    "when ( @xmath21 ) and ( @xmath22 ) reactions become comparable or faster than ( @xmath20 ) , the reaction path branches out from the initial isotopic chain and feeds nuclei with lower atomic number @xmath17 . while photodisintegration dominates in the early , hot phase ,",
    "the initially released neutrons can be recaptured at a later time , when the material cools down after the passage of the shockwave .",
    "the typical @xmath1-process abundance pattern exhibits maxima at @xmath23mo ( @xmath24=50 ) and @xmath25sm ( @xmath24=82 ) .",
    "the solar abundances of the @xmath1-nuclei are reproduced by current models of the @xmath19 process within factors of two to three on average @xcite , except for two regions with nuclei of @xmath26 and @xmath27 @xcite .",
    "the most abundant @xmath1-isotopes , @xmath28mo and @xmath29ru , are significantly underproduced because appropriately abundant seed nuclei are missing .",
    "alternative processes and sites have been proposed in order to explain this deficiency , i.e.  reactions induced by the strong neutrino fluxes in the deepest ejected layers of core - collapse supernovae ( the @xmath30 process @xcite ) , or explosive hydrogen burning in proton - rich , hot matter accreted onto the surface of neutron stars ( the @xmath31 process @xcite ) .",
    "an alternative site for additional production of the @xmath27 has not been suggested so far .",
    "a few @xmath1-nuclides may also be produced by neutrino reactions during the @xmath19 process .",
    "this `` @xmath32 process '' @xcite could be the origin of the odd - odd isotopes @xmath33la and @xmath10ta@xmath34 , which are strongly underproduced in the @xmath19 process .",
    "the abundances of both @xmath1-nuclei may be explained by neutrino scattering on their abundant neighbor isotopes to states above the neutron emission threshold .",
    "the isotopes @xmath35gd , @xmath36er , and @xmath10ta@xmath34 were sometimes also considered as @xmath1-nuclei but it was found that significant fractions are produced indeed by the @xmath14-process @xcite .",
    "the fact that self - consistent studies of the @xmath19 process have problems to synthesize the @xmath1-nuclei in the mass regions @xmath37 and @xmath27 @xcite may result from difficulties related to the astrophysical models as well as from systematic uncertainties of the nuclear physics input .",
    "therefore , the improvement of nuclear reaction cross sections is crucial for further progress in @xmath1-process models , either by directly replacing theoretical predictions by experimental data or by testing the reliability of predictions if the relevant energy range is not accessible by experiments .    in this context",
    "we have carried out an extensive experimental program to measure the ( @xmath38 ) cross sections of 13 @xmath1-only isotopes by means of the activation technique .",
    "two publications are already available concerning @xmath16se , @xmath39sr @xcite , and @xmath40hf @xcite .",
    "the present paper continues this series of measurements with the isotopes @xmath5pd , @xmath6te , @xmath7ba , and @xmath8dy , and a follow - up paper will cover the remaining heavy @xmath1-isotopes @xmath9yb , @xmath10w , @xmath11os , @xmath12pt , and @xmath13hg . a concluding paper will present @xmath1-process network calculations based on a new version of the `` karlsruhe astrophysical database of nucleosynthesis in stars '' ( kadonis ) @xcite , where the available experimental and semi - empirical ( @xmath38 ) cross sections for the @xmath1-process will be added to the already existing data library for the @xmath14-process .",
    "thereby , the kadonis project will be extended to provide the @xmath1-process community with updated experimental information .",
    "these data will necessarily remain a complement to the indispensable theoretical predictions for the vast majority of the mostly unstable isotopes in the @xmath1-process network , which are not accessible to cross section measurements with present experimental techniques .",
    "nevertheless , these data provide important tests of existing calculations in the hauser - feshbach statistical model @xcite , i.e. with the codes non - smoker @xcite or most @xcite .",
    "the experimental aspects of this work are presented in sec .",
    "the analysis of the data and a discussion of the related uncertainties follows in secs .  [ data ] and [ unc ] .",

    "the present capture measurements were carried out at the ( now closed ) karlsruhe 3.7 mv van de graaff accelerator using the activation technique .",
    "neutrons were produced with the @xmath2li(@xmath41)@xmath2be source by bombarding 30 @xmath42 m thick layers of metallic li or crystalline lif on water - cooled cu backings with protons of 1912 kev , 31 kev above the threshold of the @xmath2li(@xmath41)@xmath2be reaction at 1881  kev . under these conditions ,",
    "all neutrons are emitted into a forward cone of 120@xmath43 opening angle .",
    "the resulting neutron field represents a quasi - stellar spectrum , which approximates a maxwell - boltzmann distribution for @xmath4= @xcite ( see fig .  [ target ] ) .",
    "activation in this spectrum yields , therefore , directly the maxwellian averaged cross section ( macs ) , with only a small correction for the fact that the quasi - stellar spectrum is truncated at @xmath44= 106  kev . neutron scattering in the cu backing is negligible , since the transmission is @xmath4598% in the energy range of interest .        in all cases ,",
    "the sample material was of natural composition and high elemental purity ( @xmath46 ) , either in metallic form or as a compound ( table  [ iso ] ) .",
    "however , it has to be emphasized that the large uncertainty of the @xmath6te abundance given in @xcite originates from the fractionation of tellurium in various materials and the fact that up to now no absolute isotopic abundance measurement has been carried out .",
    "the recommended value of 0.09 ( 1)% in @xcite is commented with `` an electron multiplier was used for these measurements and the measured abundances were adjusted using a square root of the masses correction factor '' @xcite .",
    "independent relative measurements of the isotope ratios have been carried out later by de laeter et al .",
    "@xcite with a faraday cup collector and lee et al .",
    "@xcite using icp - ms ( inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry ) . both methods revealed @xmath6te abundances of 0.0918 ( 7)% and 0.0927 ( 4)% , respectively , which are in clear disagreement with the `` best value '' assignment of 0.0960",
    "( 7)% by smith et al .",
    "@xcite given in the latest iupac technical report 2003 @xcite .",
    "in @xcite the value from smith et al .",
    "@xcite was corrected with the above mentioned factor @xmath47 and one can calculate a value of 0.0935 ( 7)% from the given isotope ratios . the correction is due to a mass discrimination which occurs when using electron multipliers .",
    "the signal from light isotopes is enhanced compared to that from heavier isotopes because the secondary electron yield at the first dynode is velocity dependent @xcite .",
    "the methods using faraday cups @xcite or icp - ms @xcite do already account for this .",
    "from these three values we can derive a weighted average of 0.0927 ( 9)% where the uncertainty is derived from the standard deviation of the measurements .",
    "we decided to use this value for our measurement instead of the `` representative isotopic composition '' given in @xcite .    .",
    ".sample materials and isotopic abundances @xcite [ iso ] [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the stellar reaction rate can be determined via @xmath48 with @xmath42 being the reduced mass , @xmath49 the stellar enhancement factor ( eq .

    "as can be seen and was already mentioned before , the individual evaluated data sets increasingly deviate the further the energy is from the normalization point at kt=25 kev ( t=0.29 gk ) .",
    "although the most results include the stellar enhancement factors , it is only a small correction at 25 kev as can be seen in table [ tab : macs ] .",
    "it has to be emphasized again that the comparison for energies @xmath57 kev is actually a comparison with weighted hauser - feshbach predictions which are implicitly contained in the databases ( see the discussion in sec .",
    "[ sec : libraries ] ) and this way entering our extrapolation .    therefore , fig .",
    "[ rr ] also illustrates the necessity for cross section measurements with the time - of - flight method over a wider energy range from the resonance region up to about 1 mev , in particular for nuclei involved in the @xmath1-process network .",
    "unfortunately , this will be hard to achieve , mostly because isotopically pure samples of the rare @xmath1-isotopes are difficult to obtain .",
    "the ( n,@xmath19 ) cross sections of the @xmath1-isotopes @xmath5pd , @xmath6te , @xmath7ba , and @xmath8dy have been measured in a quasi - stellar neutron spectrum corresponding to a thermal energy of @xmath58 kev by means of the activation technique .",
    "the results for @xmath5pd , @xmath6te , and @xmath59ba represent the first experimental data , thus replacing rather uncertain theoretical predictions . for @xmath60ba and @xmath8dy",
    "the previously available experimental information could be significantly extended and improved .",
    "the measured cross sections were converted into maxwellian averaged cross sections for a range of thermal energies between @xmath61 and 100 kev , and further extrapolated to the temperature region of the @xmath1-process .",
    "the extrapolation still relies on theory and this underscores the necessity for future measurements covering a wider energy range .",
    "the present work will be complemented by a second paper on the ( @xmath38 ) cross sections of @xmath9yb , @xmath10w , @xmath11os , @xmath12pt , and @xmath13hg , followed by a discussion of the astrophysical implications in a third , concluding paper .",
