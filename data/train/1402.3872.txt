    "in this section , we devote ourselves to studying nonlocal properties of our hybrid tripartite system and , moreover , exploring the relationship between nonlocality and entanglement , which are two central concepts in quantum physics . up to now",
    ", their relationship is far from being answered especially in multipartite _ mixed _ states  @xcite .",
    "it should be pointed out that the definition of tripartite / multipartite nonlocality is still not clear and unified  @xcite .",
    "usually , it is defined as _ genuine _ ( or three - way ) tripartite / multipartite nonlocality denoted by the violation of svetlichny inequality ( si )  @xcite .",
    "however , there exists tripartite nonlocality ( here we mean nonlocality involving all three parties ) that does not violate si , i.e. , is not necessarily _ genuine _ : for example , in a three - particle system , particle 1 is nonlocally correlated with the other two , while particles 2 and 3 are locally correlated . in such a case , nonlocal correlations could be signalled by the violation of other weaker bell - like inequalities , e.g. the mk inequality .",
    "the ` drawback ' of the mk is that its violation admits states with only two - particle nonlocal correlations present  @xcite .",
    "it is in principle impossible to distinguish tripartite nonlocality from bipartite ones in the violation of mk inequality . in what follows",
    ", we will focus on testing the mk inequality in our highly mixed three - mode gaussian state in view of the failure of violating the si in such a state .",
    "it should be pointed out that the violation of si is rather demanding , with genuinely multipartite entangled states of the @xmath81 form achieving values of the svetlichny function only slightly larger than 4 @xcite , and for gaussian states , violation of the si seems impossible when the purity falls below 0.86 @xcite .",
    "given the cm of the system , one can write its characteristic function @xmath82  @xcite .",

    "the key of such a phase - space approach is that the mean value of the displaced parity operator is connected to the wigner function , i.e. @xmath94  @xcite .",

    "the tripartite entanglement can only be present within a high - finesse cavity , and a large @xmath128 ( @xmath126 ) compared to decay @xmath28 ( @xmath35 ) .",

    "as shown , a considerable degree of @xmath132 emerges , and , moreover , @xmath132 is robust against the temperature surviving up to @xmath133 k for cavity finesse @xmath134 .",
    "as @xmath28 becomes larger , the steady - state coupling @xmath128 increases remarkably ( see the inset ) resulting in a rising @xmath132 till to a saturated value . surprisingly , @xmath103 declines as @xmath132 increases . for the whole range of @xmath28",
    ", we have not witnessed any violation of the mk inequality .",

    "what follows , we will show this is indeed the case .",
    "by relaxing the coupling @xmath128 , realized by increasing the cavity length to @xmath21=@xmath136 mm , we observed a weak violation of the mk inequality when @xmath28 takes small values ( smaller @xmath28 will not satisfy the conditon for cm @xmath76 being physical ) , as shown in fig .",
    "[ enmk ] * ( b)*. in such a case , @xmath132 can only achieve its maximum around 0.05 due to a much weaker @xmath128 [ about 0.17 @xmath128 of getting maximum @xmath132 for @xmath123 mm in fig .",
    "[ enmk ] * ( a ) * ] . unlike the robustness of entanglement towards the temperature ,",
    "the nonlocality is quite fragile : @xmath103 drops below 2 when @xmath43 rises up to 1 mk .",
    "such a feature has also been observed in the tripartite nonlocality of the vibrational modes of trapped ions  @xcite . from an experimental perspective , we see that @xmath137 mk can not be reached with standard dilution refrigerators ( which typically reaches 10 mk and hardly below ) .",
    "however such temperatures could be reached by employing advanced techniques such as adiabatic nuclear demagnetization refrigerators  @xcite .",
    "alternatively , one could think of using ghz oscillators , for which the nonlocality properties discussed here would be visible at higher temperatures .",
    "this negative relation between nonlocality and entanglement is confirmed by fig .",

    "unambiguously , @xmath132 reaches a peak as @xmath131 , while @xmath103 gets two _ minima _ when @xmath139 . since @xmath103 is not sensitive to @xmath138 when @xmath28 is small , in fig .",
    "[ enmk ] * ( b ) * we used @xmath131 .",
    "evidently , as @xmath138 takes values away from @xmath140 , a slight rise of @xmath103 would occur .",
    "since the violation of mk inequality admits bipartite nonlocal correlations  @xcite , we now prove the negative relation still holds even in this situation . above all",
    ", it is necessary to specify unambiguously the _ positive relation _ between nonlocality and entanglement .",
    "despite specific states studied , measures of the entanglement and bell inequalities adopted , the _ positive relation _ contains two apparent meanings ( not necessarily complete ) : ( i ) as the entanglement increases / decreases , the nonlocality also increases / decreases , and vice versa ; ( ii ) for a multipartite nonlocal state with two of the bipartition entanglement @xmath141 ( where a and b are subsystems regardless of the number of particles / modes comprised in both ) , @xmath142 is more likely than @xmath143 to violate the bell inequality , or contributes more to the violation . now",
    "_ suppose the positive relation is valid _ in our case , then the decreasing mk function might result from one or more declining bipartite entanglement @xmath115 and/or @xmath107 , though the tripartite entanglement @xmath132 is increasing . to ascertain this , we show in fig .",

    "[ enmk ] * ( b)*. it shows that only atoms - light entanglement @xmath144 is slightly decreasing as @xmath28 grows . according to ( i ) , only @xmath144 could lead to the decreasing @xmath103 , and then in view of ( ii ) , @xmath144 should be larger than any other entanglement plotted in fig .",
    "[ enmk ] * ( d)*. this is clearly against the fact that @xmath144 is the minimal entanglement and has the least possibility to get the mk inequality violated .",
    "therefore , the previous assumption does not hold and thus the nonlocality and entanglement show a negative relation even if bipartite nonlocality is present in the violation of the mk inequality .",
    "the breaking of the positive relation ( i ) has been reported in refs .",
    "@xcite .    from the above analyses , we remark that the emergence of both tripartite entanglement and nonlocality within the system requires a high - finesse cavity , a high mechanical q factor , strong coupling @xmath128 ( @xmath126 ) with relatively low decay @xmath28 ( @xmath35 ) , and the cavity is resonant with the anti - stokes",
    "differently , the appearance of entanglement mainly depends on the coupling strength , while nonlocality is mainly sensitive to the value of the decay rate , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ enmk ] * ( b ) * , @xmath145 can only exist at extra - low cavity and atomic decay",
    ". this inconsistency could be the physical reason that leads to the negative relation between both .",
    "it should be pointed out that it is in principle hard to give a _ general _ conclusion on the relationship between both in view of various measures or bell inequalities for the nonlocality , especially for multipartite cases which display a more complex structure than the bipartite cases  @xcite .",

    "the parameters take the same values as in fig .",
    "[ enmk ] * ( a)*. ]",
    "having observed the tripartite quantum nonlocality and entanglement in the system , we now turn to the study of quantum effects in its subsystems .",
    "we focus on the non - classicality of the motional state of the mechanical system , owing to its significance in the fundamental research in quantum physics  @xcite . in what follows , non - classicality is indicated by regions where the wigner function attains negative values  @xcite . due to the linearization of the dynamics and the gaussian nature of the input states and the noises , the state of the system is gaussian at all times ,",
    "and thus it will not be possible to observe non - classicality simply by tracing out the atomic and cavity subsystems from the joint state . as shown in ref .",

    "the latter can be carried out by using the quantum jump detection scheme described in ref .",

    "based on the parameters adopted in our system , however , we did not find the negativity of the wigner function when performing measurements on the cavity . on the contrary , detection on the atoms",
    "induces effectively a negative wigner function [ cf .",
    "[ wignerm ] * ( a ) * and * ( b ) * ] .",
    "this is probably because , under the parameters , the atoms - mirror coupling or entanglement via the cavity field is stronger than the mirror - light s though there is no direct interaction between them  @xcite . for measurements simultaneously performed on both the cavity and the atomic mode , the negativity induced by the detection on the atoms vanishes due to the combined effects caused by the detection on the cavity , as shown in fig .",

    "<S> we study quantum effects in hybrid atomic optomechanics in a system comprising a cloud of atoms and a mobile mirror mediated by a single - mode cavity . </S>",

    "<S> it has been shown [ c. genes , et al . </S>",
    "<S> , pra 77 , 050307 ( r ) ( 2008 ) ] that tripartite entanglement is optimized when the cavity is resonant with the anti - stokes sideband of the driving laser and the atomic frequency matches the stokes one . </S>",
    "<S> however , we show that this is not the case for the nonlocality . </S>",
    "<S> the mk function achieves _ minima _ when the atoms are resonant with both the stokes and anti - stokes sidebands , and unexpectedly , we find violation of the mk inequality only in a parameter region where entanglement is far from being maximum . a negative relation exists between nonlocality and entanglement with consideration of the possibility of bipartite nonlocality in the violation of the mk inequality </S>",
    "<S> . we also study the non - classicality of the mirror by post - selected measurements , e.g. geiger - like detection , on the cavity and/or the atoms . </S>",
    "<S> we show that with feasible parameters geiger - like detection on the atoms can effectively induce mechanical non - classicality .    </S>",
    "<S> the lack of observation of quantum effects at the macroscopic scale reinforces the conjecture that macroscopic objects are governed by classical physics , while the microscopic world is ruled by quantum mechanics . </S>",
    "<S> however , quantum mechanics intrinsically shows no limitation to describe large - scale / massive systems  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> preparing macroscopic quantum states is of vital importance for understanding fundamental issues in quantum mechanics , such as decoherence and the quantum - to - classical transition  @xcite , collapse models of the wave function  @xcite , and so on . </S>",
    "<S> optomechanics , addressing the coupling of optical and mechanical degrees of freedom via radiation pressure  @xcite , provides an ideal platform to generate and control quantum mesoscopic / macroscopic states of mechanical systems thanks to its intrinsic nonlinear light - matter interactions .    over the past few years </S>",
    "<S> , successful advances in nano- and micro - mechanical engineering , in particular mechanical oscillators cooled into ( or close to ) their ground state  @xcite , have made it possible to prepare mechanical quantum states . </S>",
    "<S> preparing quantum states either for the light mode or the mechanical oscillator is a fascinating ( though challenging ) goal in the field of optomechanics  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> nonclassical mechanical states can be generated by the optomechanical nonlinearity intrinsic in the strong coupling regime  @xcite , by injecting squeezed light into the cavity ( the squeezing is thus transferred from light to the mechanical degree of freedom )  @xcite , by post - selected measurements on the optical field  @xcite , and so on .    </S>",
    "<S> recently , it has been reported that hybrid atom - assisted optomechanics shows advantages in many aspects  @xcite . to name but a few </S>",
    "<S> , atoms induce an additional nonlinear effect , which enhances the optomechanical interaction and , moreover , results in a squeezed state of the mechanical mode  @xcite ; atoms boost the cooling of the mechanical motion  @xcite and can be utilized to prepare non - gaussian mechanical states  @xcite ; and the strong coupling between an atom / atoms and a mechanical oscillator allows to realize quantum control of the oscillator via manipulating the atom / atoms  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it has also been shown that a genuine tripartite entangled stationary state of an atom - cavity - mirror system can be produced  @xcite . very recently </S>",
    "<S> , nonlocality of an atom and a mechanical oscillator mediated by a single - mode cavity has been studied  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> being incompatible with local realism , nonlocality is demonstrated by the violation of bell inequalities  @xcite , and witnesses a type of quantum correlations that is distinct from entanglement and discord . </S>",
    "<S> it has been proven that a _ pure _ bipartite / tripartite entangled state is nonlocal  @xcite . however , in general , nonlocality and entanglement are different properties : a system in an entangled _ mixed _ state does not necessarily possess nonlocal correlations  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the relationship between both is much more subtle for _ mixed _ states and far from being clear especially in multipartite cases  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it is thus of fundamental importance to explore their relationship in such states , practicably starting from a specific case , which is the main theme of this paper . </S>",
    "<S> multipartite nonlocality has been investigated in continuous variable ( cv ) systems  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in such cases , it is usually demonstrated by the violation of bell - like inequalities in phase space due to the systems infinite - dimensional hilbert spaces  @xcite .    in this paper </S>",
    "<S> , we investigate tripartite nonlocality and entanglement in a hybrid optomechanical system composed of an atomic ensemble placed within an optomechanical cavity . </S>",
    "<S> the system is subject to noise and dissipation , and its state is in general highly mixed . </S>",
    "<S> it therefore represents an ideal platform for exploring the relationship between nonlocality and entanglement in mixed states . </S>",
    "<S> it has been reported  @xcite that robust genuine tripartite entanglement can be generated using experimentally feasible parameters under the following conditions : ( i ) the cavity is resonant with the anti - stokes sideband of the driving laser ( i.e. the mechanical cooling regime ) ; ( ii ) the atomic frequency matches the stokes sideband ; ( iii ) the effective optomechanical / atom - light coupling is large compared to cavity / atomic decay . under these conditions , however , we show that the value of mermin - klyshko ( mk ) function  @xcite ( from which the mk inequality is constructed whose violation denotes tripartite nonlocality ) shows a negative relation with the entanglement for a wide range of the cavity decay : the mk value decreases for increasing entanglement . by relaxing the optomechanical / atom - light coupling thus diminishing the entanglement , we observed a violation of the mk inequality demonstrating nonlocal correlations shared among the atom - light - mirror system . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , we also show that the mk function achieves _ minima _ when the atoms are resonant with both the stokes and anti - stokes sidebands of the laser , while the former is the condition under which the tripartite entanglement is maximized .    </S>",
    "<S> another theme of this paper is to explore the impact of the atomic ensemble on the non - classicality of the mechanical mode . </S>",
    "<S> we show that by post - selected measurements , e.g. geiger - like detection , on the atomic state , a negative wigner function of the mirror is observed witnessing the quantum nature of its motional state . </S>",
    "<S> larger coupling strength of the system leads to a more nonclassical mechanical state . </S>"
