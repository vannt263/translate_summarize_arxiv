    "the semiclassical treatment of the hawking radiation was introduced by kraus and wilczek @xcite .",
    "the interest of the approach is to provide a method to compute the back - reaction effect of the radiation on the black hole , an effect which is completely ignored in the the external field treatment of the phenomenon .",
    "the main idea is to replace the free field modes of the radiation by the semiclassical wave function of a shell of matter or radiation which consistently propagates in the gravitational field generated by the back hole and by the shell itself .",
    "the shell dynamics was studied in detail in many papers ( see @xcite ) . in the original semiclassical treatment @xcite the spectrum of the hawking radiation",
    "is extracted through the standard fourier analysis of the regular modes .",
    "later such a treatment was related to the tunneling picture @xcite ; such an approach gave also rise to several proposals and to controversy @xcite .",
    "we think that the mode analysis is still the clearest and safest way to extract the results in the semiclassical approach .",
    "the present work @xcite is devoted to a detailed analysis of the construction of the semiclassical modes and their time fourier transform .",
    "the action related to the modes which are regular on the horizon is defined through mixed boundary conditions , i.e. a condition on the value of the conjugate momentum at @xmath1 and a condition at time @xmath2 on the coordinate @xmath3 .",
    "the computation of the action as a function of @xmath2 corresponds to the solution of a system of two highly non linear equations where the two unknown are the value @xmath4 of the hamiltonian and the shell position at time @xmath1 , @xmath5 which also depends on the mixed boundary conditions . in @xcite a truncated system of equations obtained by keeping only the most singular terms in the exact equations was considered . through a long chain of approximations",
    "the authors reached for the effective temperature , due to the back reaction effects , the value @xmath6 .",
    "later keski - vakkuri and kraus @xcite using a completely different method obtained for such effective temperature the value @xmath7 . here we reconsider the problem along the lines of @xcite treating the full exact system of equations .",
    "we show that such a system of equations is equivalent to an other non linear equation which can be solved by a convergent iterative procedure .",
    "the first two terms of the convergent iterative procedure are sufficient to provide the leading spectrum of the radiation and its back - reaction correction terms of order @xmath8 confirming the result of @xcite .",
    "the rotationally invariant painlev - gullstrand metric is given by @xmath9 where all quantities @xmath10 are functions only of @xmath3 and @xmath2 .",
    "one has still a gauge choice on @xmath11 . in presence of a shell of matter",
    "we shall use the `` outer gauge '' @xcite which is defined by @xmath12 for @xmath13 where @xmath14 denotes the shell position . at @xmath15 ,",
    "@xmath11 is continuous as all the other functions appearing in ( [ metric ] ) , but its derivative is discontinuous . after solving the constraints the action takes the form in the massless case @xcite @xmath16    at the semiclassical level",
    "the modes which are invariant under the killing vector @xmath17 are simply given by    @xmath18    where @xmath19 is the square of the planck length .",
    "as it is well known such modes have the feature of being singular at the horizon . instead",
    "the true vacuum should be described in term of modes which are regular at the horizon for which an outgoing shell of matter has the following boundary conditions @xcite : i ) at time @xmath20 the conjugate momentum is a given value @xmath21 ; ii ) at time @xmath2 the shell position @xmath3 is a given value @xmath22 .",
    "the expression for such an action was already given by kraus and wilczek in @xcite .",
    "with the two conditions @xmath23 and @xmath24 the action is @xmath25 t .\\ ] ] @xmath5 denotes the value of @xmath3 at time @xmath20 ; also such a quantity depends on the imposed boundary conditions .    in the outer gauge",
    "@xcite the equations of motion can be integrated to @xmath26 with the boundary condition at @xmath1 @xmath27 where @xmath28 .",
    "eq.([kequation ] ) together with eq.([tequation ] ) should determine completely @xmath4 as a function of @xmath2 .",
    "however with the above mentioned mixed boundary condition in general caustics arise @xcite , i.e. in general more that one trajectory in phase space satisfies the mixed boundary conditions . on the other hand",
    "we prove @xcite that if the end point @xmath22 , is less that a critical value @xmath29 , caustics to not occur .",
