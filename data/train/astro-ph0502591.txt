    "elemental abundances in metal - poor galactic halo stars are providing evidence of the earliest galactic nucleosynthesis history and clues about the identities of the first stellar generations , the progenitors ( or predecessors ) of the halo stars .",
    "the neutron - capture ( @xmath4-capture ) elements  formed in slow ( @xmath5-process ) and rapid ( @xmath1-process ) neutron - capture nucleosynthesis  were synthesized in these first stars and later ejected into the interstellar medium and eventually incorporated into the halo stars ( see recent reviews by cowan & thielemann 2004 ; truran  2002 ; sneden & cowan 2003 ; cowan & sneden 2004 ) .    the focus of @xmath4-capture abundance studies in metal - poor stars has been to examine correlations among these elements in an attempt to help to identify the sites of nucleosynthesis for these elements and also to trace their evolution with galactic metallicity . most of the previous studies in this field have focused on the rare - earth elements ( _ e.g. _ , ba and eu ) that are easily detectable with ground - based telescopes .",
    "such studies have indicated a consistency , or scaling , ( for @xmath1-process - rich stars ) between the total @xmath4-capture elemental abundances and the solar system @xmath1-process - only abundances . until recently ,",
    "however , it has not been possible to examine the full range of the @xmath4-capture elements , as many of them have dominant transitions in the near uv that are accessible only to telescopes such as the hubble space telescope ( hst ) . with the space telescope imaging spectrograph ( stis )",
    ", it is now possible to make reliable abundance determinations of the heaviest stable @xmath4-capture elements ( such as pt ) to determine whether the relative scaling of the rare - earth elements extends through the @xmath1-process peak , and also to examine some of the lighter , less - investigated elements such as ge .    in this paper",
    "we report the first large - sample abundance determinations of the abundances for the elements ge , zr , os and pt using hst , supplemented by keck  i high resolution echelle spectrograph ( hires ) observations of the very heavy @xmath4-capture element ir , in a group of 11 metal - poor halo stars . in ",
    "2 we present the spectroscopic data , in  3 we describe the abundance analyses , and in  4 we discuss the correlations among the elements and the implications for stellar nucleosynthesis and galactic chemical evolution . in this section",
    "we also revisit the detailed elemental abundance distributions for the two well - studied @xmath1-process - rich stars 22 and 17 , followed by our conclusions in  5 .",
    "high - resolution ultraviolet spectra were gathered with the hubble space telescope imaging spectrograph ( hst / stis ) .",
    "the instrumental setup included the echelle grating e230 m centered at 2707   , an entrance aperture of 0.2@xmath60.06@xmath7 , and the near - uv mama detector .",
    "these components yielded spectra in the wavelength range 2410    @xmath8  @xmath9  @xmath8  3070    with a spectral resolving power of r  @xmath10  @xmath11  @xmath12  30,000 .",
    "one to five individual spectra were obtained during the hst visit for each program star , depending on the target brightness .",
    "the observing sequence was a standard routine that included target acquisition , peakup , and integration(s ) .",
    "no special calibration exposures were needed .",
    "standard hst pipelines produced the one - dimensional , flat - fielded , wavelength - calibrated spectra from the individual stellar integrations .",
    "algorithms implemented in the iraf software system were then used to reformat these spectrum files into standard fits spectral images , and to combine the integrations to produce final spectra .",
    "the signal - to - noise ratios ( s / n ) of the spectra were difficult to estimate accurately because of the strong - lined nature of the stars in the uv wavelength region . from comparisons of synthetic and observed spectra",
    "we estimate that s / n  @xmath13  50 in the spectral regions of interest .",
    "we supplemented these data with visible - region high resolution spectra obtained with the keck  i hires ( vogt  1994 ) .",
    "this instrument was configured to produce complete spectral coverage in interval 3150    @xmath8  @xmath9  @xmath8  4600    at a resolving power of r  @xmath12  45,000 , and 30  @xmath14  s / n  @xmath14  200 ( a steadily increasing function with increasing wavelength for these cool target stars , which were with a ccd system not optimized for near - uv response ) .",
    "we obtained auxiliary lamp spectra for flat - fielding and wavelength calibration of the spectra .",
    "the echelle extractions , including flat - field and bias correction , cosmic - ray rejection , sky subtraction , and wavelength and flux calibration , were accomplished with the software package makee ( e.g. , barlow & sargent 1997 ) .",
    "for the stars cs  22892 - 052 and bd  + 17@xmath153248 , recent and detailed analyses have been performed by sneden  ( 2003 ) and cowan  ( 2002 ) ; their parameters have been adopted here .",
    "the stars hd  6755 , hd  115444 , hd  122563 , hd  122956 , hd  186478 , and hd  221170 were analyzed with the stellar models used by simmerer  ( 2004 ) .",
    "the remaining stars ( hd  6268 , hd  1265887 , and hd  175305 ) were assigned stellar models based on methods used in simmerer the details of these parameter selection methods are outlined in that paper and are summarized here .    the grid of kurucz stellar atmosphere models with no convective overshoot ( castelli  1997 ) were employed .",
    "we interpolated these to the set of stellar parameters using software provided by a. mcwilliam ( 1990 , private communication ) and i. ivans ( 2002 , private communication ) .",
    "the stellar parameters ( effective temperature , surface gravity , metallicity as represented by [ fe / h ] , and microturbulence ) were then checked against standard spectroscopic constraints .    * : when possible , effective temperatures were taken from alonso  ( 1999,2001 ) , who give values for their calibration stars ( which include hd  6755 , hd  122563 , hd  122956 , hd  186478 , and hd  221170 ) .",
    "these temperatures were then checked against the spectroscopic constraint that the equivalent widths ( ews ) of lines be uncorrelated with the excitation potentials of the lines .",
    "the alonso  temperatures for those stars were all consistent with that requirement .",
    "effective temperatures were calculated for the remaining stars ( hd  6268 , hd  115444 , hd  126587 , and hd  175305 ) with the alonso  calibrations for infrared color indices .",
    "the ir colors were taken from the 2mass database , as transformed to a system consistent with alonso  ( see simmerer  section 3.3.1 ) .",
    "* surface gravity :  may be derived from the standard relation involving , absolute magnitude , and mass ( , simmerer  2004 ) .",
    "most giant stars are too distant to have a well determined parallax ( and hence absolute magnitude ) , so we used the m@xmath16 derived by anthony - twarog & twarog ( 1994 ) for hd  122563 , hd  122956 , hd  186478 , and hd  221170 . the surface gravity for hd  6775",
    "was calculated from its hipparcos parallax ( perryman  1997 ) , as this star is close enough to have a well - determined value ( though the hipparcos distance is consistent with that of anthony - twarog & twarog ) .",
    "the derived gravities were then checked spectroscopically by requiring that the abundances of fe from and be essentially equal ( see thevenin & idiart 1999 ) .",
    "the anthony - twarog & twarog values for these stars all met that criterion .",
    "the remaining four stars also had distance estimates from anthony - twarog & twarog ( 1994 ) , which we used to calculate surface gravities .",
    "* metallicity : a small list of and lines was used to check the derived stellar effective temperatures and surface gravities .",
    "this list was also used to assess the [ fe / h ] metallicity .",
    "as per the discussion in thevenin & idiart ( 1999 ) , the fe ionization equilibrium may not be correctly described by the lte saha formula .",
    "we therefore report both [ /h ] and [ /h ] abundances in table  [ tab1 ] .",
    "note that thevenin & idiart considered relatively high - gravity stars , and a thorough investigation of nlte effects in low gravity , low metallicity stars has yet to be published .",
    "examples of attempts in this area include those of gratton  ( 1999 ) and korn ( 2004 ) .",
    "these authors suggest that nlte departures in abundances for stars of interest here may not be large , but the uncertainties in such analyses do not permit definitive conclusions to be reached on this issue . + the metallicity of the model atmosphere usually was set 0.25  dex higher than the derived fe abundance to account for additional opacity from the @xmath3-capture elements ( whose abundances are enhanced at low metallicities ) .",
    "the [ x / fe ] ratios in table  [ tab3 ] are calculated with [ /h ] . for hd  6268 , hd  115444 , hd  1265887 , and",
    "hd  175305 , we used the [ fe / h ] reported by burris  ( 2000 ) and then applied the offsets found by simmerer  ( 2004 ) to recover and abundances .",
    "this results in an offset of + 0.04 dex ( for ) and -0.08 dex ( for ) from the [ fe / h ] found in burris  ( 2000 ) . *",
    "microturbulence :  was set be requiring that log @xmath17 be uncorrelated with the abundance for lines .",
    "microturbulence values for the four stars not included in simmerer   ( 2004 ) were set to 2.0  , a typical value for stars in this ,  domain .      in cool stellar atmospheres germanium , osmium , iridium and platinum",

    "spectra in this wavelength domain are extremely complex mixes of overlapping atomic and molecular features .",
    "no completely unblended features of , , and exist at the spectral resolution of our hst / stis data . therefore synthetic spectrum computations were employed in all of the abundance determinations of this paper .",
    "construction of atomic and molecular line lists has been discussed in several of our previous papers ; see sneden  ( 1996 , 2003 ) and cowan  ( 2002 ) for overviews and application to @xmath1-process - rich metal - poor giant stars .",
    "sneden  ( 1998 ) describe in detail and show illustrative spectra of several of the uv features that are employed here .",
    "briefly , we combined laboratory data for the lines of interest with data for other atomic and molecular hydride features taken from the kurucz ( 1995 ) database to form the initial line lists .",
    "then repeated syntheses of the solar spectrum ( delbouille , neven , & roland 1973 ) for @xmath9  @xmath2  3000   , and of the spectrum of the very metal - poor , @xmath4-capture - deficient giant star hd  122563 ( obtained as part of this program ) , were used to refine the often poorly - known transition probabilities of the atomic contaminants .",
    "the line strengths of molecular hydrides ( predominantly oh , less often ch and nh ) were varied together by changing the cno abundances of the individual stars until acceptable matches with the observed spectra are obtained .    in this procedure , no alterations were permitted to the laboratory data for the , , , and lines . here",
    "we comment on the lines of each species employed in this survey and the sources of their laboratory data .",
    "_ germanium : _ the best germanium abundance indicator is the 3039.07    line . following the discussion of cowan  ( 2002 ) , we adopted the bimont  ( 1999 ) @xmath19 value .",
    "as cowan  noted , two other strong lines at 2651.17 and 2651.57    can be detected in the spectra of our program stars .",
    "unfortunately , they comprise parts of a large blended absorption feature stretching over @xmath202   , and we could not derive reliable germanium abundances from these lines .",
    "their line strengths do roughly correlate with that of the 3039  line ; probably they could become useful transitions with higher resolution ( r  @xmath12  60,000 ) spectra .",
    "_ zirconium : _ several lines are detectable on our hst spectra , allowing a link to be made with spectral features of this species seen in the visible spectral region .",
    "cowan  ( 2002 ) and sneden  ( 2003 ) have already demonstrated that consistent abundances of zr can be obtained from uv and ground - based spectra .",
    "bimont  ( 1981 ) published reliable @xmath19-values for many lines , but unfortunately their study did not extend to wavelengths below 3400   .",
    "therefore , for the 3036.39 + 3036.51   blend , and for the lines at 3054.84 , 3060.12 , and 3061.33  , we adopted the transition probabilities recommended by kurucz ( 1998 ) , who adjusted the original corliss & bozman ( 1962 ) values to conform with the bemont  @xmath19 scale .",

    "spectra of these two lines are displayed in that paper s figure  2 .",
    "we also added the line at 3301.57   , which has been shown to be a reliable abundance indicator in @xmath1-process - rich stars ( cowan  2002 , sneden  2003 ) .",
    "transition probabilities for the 3058 and 3301    lines were adopted from the recent laboratory analysis of ivarsson  ( 2003 ) : log  @xmath21  =  0.45 , and log  @xmath22  =  0.74 .",
    "these values are very close to those used in our previous studies ( 0.43 , and 0.75 , respectively ; kwiatkowski  1984 ) .",
    "no recent laboratory study of the 2838     line exists , so we adopted the value used by sneden  ( 1998 ) : log  @xmath23  =  + 0.11 , from corliss & bozman ( 1962 ) scaled to the kwiatkowski  lifetime system .",

    "happily , ivarsson  ( 2003 ) also have provided transition probabilities for two of the lines : log  @xmath24  =  1.21 , and log  @xmath25  =  1.44 , which are in excellent agreement with the older values of 1.26 and 1.45 , respectively .",
    "we adopted the ivarsson  values for these lines ( see further remarks in the appendix ) , and log  @xmath26  =  -0.52 for the third line ( gough et al . 1983 ) .    _ platinum : _ den hartog  ( 2005 ) have recently completed a new laboratory transition probability analysis of ; their values are adopted here .",
    "that study also searched for the cleanest and strongest lines in our program star 17 , originally studied in detail by cowan  ( 2002 ) .",
    "this halo giant star was considered the most favorable case for detections , as it combines low metallicity ( [ fe / h ]  =  2.1 ) , large @xmath4-capture / fe abundance ratios ( , [ eu / fe ]  + 0.9 ) , relatively high temperature (  =  5200  k , which results in substantially weakened molecular contaminating features ) , and excellent high - resolution spectra in hand from 2500    through 7000   . of the 127 lines with newly - determined @xmath19 values , den hartog  found only 11 useful features for their platinum abundance study of 17 , and recommended only the relatively unblended lines at 2646.68 , 2659.45 , and 2929.79    for application to other metal - poor stars . those lines were employed in the present study .",

    "a rough progression of increasing abundance ratio with increasing atomic number is evident : large deficiencies of the light @xmath4-capture element ge in all program stars ; weak or no enhancements of the intermediate - mass element zr in all stars except the extreme @xmath1-process - rich star 22 ; and large overabundances of the heaviest elements os , ir , and pt in all stars except the @xmath1-process - poor star hd  122563 .",
    "a similar conclusion may be seen in figure  [ fig2 ] , in which we show the observed spectra of three stars with contrasting @xmath1-process abundance levels : hd  122563 ( [ /h ]  =  2.61 , [ eu / fe ]  =  0.50 ; see tables  [ tab1 ] and [ tab3 ] , and their literature references ) ; hd  115444 ( ( [ /h ]  =  2.71 , [ eu / fe ]  =  + 0.58 ) ; and 22  ( ( [ /h ]  =  3.09 , [ eu / fe ]  =  + 1.62 ) .",
    "while the relative absorption strengths of the lines of these three stars qualitatively track the [ eu / fe ] values ( top panel ) , no such correlation is seen in the line strengths ( bottom panel ) .",
    "in fact , 22  has the largest [ eu / fe ] value but clearly the weakest feature . in the following subsections we amplify and interpret these observational results .      earlier work ( cowan  1996 ; sneden  1998 , 2003 ) used hst with stis and the goddard high resolution spectrograph to detect   @xmath4-capture - peak ( _ e.g. _ , pt ) in a few individual metal - poor halo stars . our new abundance data for os , ir , and",
    "pt allow us to make the first moderate - sample systematic study of the heaviest stable @xmath4-capture elements , and to compare them with the @xmath4-capture element eu , which is synthesized almost entirely in the @xmath1-process .",
    "we make direct comparisons of os , ir , and pt abundances with eu in the three panels of figure  [ fig3 ] .",
    "while the ratios [ el / fe ] shown in figure  [ fig1 ] all indicate substantial overabundances of these three elements , the comparisons to eu in figure  [ fig3 ] demonstrate the clearly correlated abundance behavior of eu , os , ir , and pt . the very small deviations from [ el / eu ]  =  0.0 indicated by the solid horizontal lines of each panel ( @xmath18[os / eu]@xmath2  =  + 0.15 , @xmath38  =  0.12 ; @xmath18[ir / eu]@xmath2  =  + 0.13 , @xmath38  =  0.09 ; , and @xmath18[pt / eu]@xmath2  =  + 0.13 , @xmath38  =  0.20 ) suggest that the solar - system @xmath1-process abundance distribution is mimicked in our sample ( and possibly all ) @xmath1-process - rich stars born in the early galactic halo .",
    "we regard the mean @xmath20 + 0.15  dex offset as observationally indistinguishable from [ el / eu ]  =  0.0 ; see the uncertainty discussion of  3.3 .",
    "these very - heavy - element abundance comparisons strongly suggest a similar synthesis origin for eu , os , ir , and pt in the @xmath1-process sites that were the progenitors to the observed halo stars .",
    "we also want to note the la / eu ratios listed in table  [ tab3 ] ( see also the discussion in  3.2 ) .",
    "in solar system material la ( dominantly an @xmath5-process element , see simmerer  2004 ) is more abundant than the @xmath1-process element eu .",
    "as is seen in the data compiled in table  [ tab3 ] , however , @xmath18[la / eu]@xmath2 = 0.4 , clearly indicating that all of the stars in our sample are @xmath1-process - rich .",
    "( see simmerer  for further discussion of the synthesis of la in these stars . )      in figure [ fig4 ] we plot [ ge / h ] values with respect to the traditional metallicity indicators [ fe / h ] .",
    "it is easy to see that the ge abundances scale with metallicity but at a depressed ( with respect to solar ) level : @xmath18[ge / h]@xmath2  =  [ fe / h ]  ",
    "0.79@xmath340.04 ( @xmath38  =  0.14 ) . further supporting this interpretation",
    "are abundance comparisons of ge with respect to the @xmath4-capture element eu that we illustrate in figure  [ fig5 ] .",
    "if ge and eu were correlated , the abundances would fall along the straight ( diagonal ) line illustrated in the figure .",
    "obviously the abundances of ge seem to be uncorrelated with those of the @xmath1-process element eu .",
    "in fact , [ ge / fe ] for the @xmath1-process poor star hd  122563 is comparable to the values found for @xmath1-process ( _ i.e. _ , eu ) rich stars , including the upper limit for 22 .",
    "while @xmath4-capture processes are important for ge production in solar system material ( , simmerer  2004 ) , these abundance comparisons immediately suggest a different origin for this element early in the history of the galaxy .",
    "our abundance data appear to be more consistent with an explosive ( or charged - particle ) synthesis for ge .",
    "this might occur as a result of capture on iron - peak nuclei , perhaps during the so - called `` @xmath3-rich freeze - out '' in a supernova environment .",
    "however , calculations to date ( nakamura   1999 ; hoffman   2001 ; heger & woosley 2002 ; umeda & nomoto 2005 ; chieffi & limongi 2004 ) have difficulties explaining the observed trends in [ ge / fe ] . indeed",
    ", the trends in iron - peak nuclei revealed in cayrel  2004 ) strongly suggest the occurrence of a rather dramatic alpha - rich freeze associated with the earliest and most metal - deficient stellar populations , down to at least a metallicity level [ fe / h ] @xmath20 -4 ( truran   2005 ) .",
    "the strong temperature ( density ) dependence of this process indicates that fine tuning may be required to fit the observations .",
    "this may explain the fact that existing studies have not reproduced the trends .",
    "it is interesting to note , in this regard , that the trends seen in the two `` hyper''-iron - poor stars ( frebel  2004 ; christlieb  2004 ) do not appear to be consistent with the extrapolation of those reflected in the cayrel  ( 2004 ) study below [ fe / h ] @xmath20 -4 . this contribution to ge synthesis appears to be the dominant production mechanism at low metallicities . of course ,",
    "un - tracebly small contributions from @xmath5- and/or @xmath1-process production can not be ruled out ( but significant @xmath5-process production is not expected at [ fe / h ] @xmath41 2 ) . at higher metallicities and the onset of the @xmath5-process , it would be expected that the ge production would increase sharply and no longer be correlated with the iron production ( gallino , private communication ) .",
    "we make a similar abundance comparison of zr versus eu for our sample of stars in figure [ fig6 ] .",
    "as discussed in  3.3 , we note that the zr abundances obtained with hst / stis are well correlated with the ground - based abundances of this element .",
    "the abundance data , excluding 22 , show very little scatter and appear to be uncorrelated with eu  this includes stars with [ eu / fe ]  @xmath12  1.0 .",
    "the exception is 22 , for which [ zr / fe ] is substantially higher than in , for example , hd  122563 .",
    "the zr and eu abundances , however , do not follow a clearly linear correlation in the figure . this again would seem to indicate a different synthesis origin for these two elements , something recently discussed in more detail by travaglio  ( 2004 ) .",
    "their more extensive abundance analysis suggests that known @xmath4-capture processes can explain some of the production of zr , but that the nucleosynthetic origin of this element is different than that for heavier @xmath4-capture elements such as ba and eu .",
    "furthermore , travaglio  argue that an additional ( lighter element ) primary process is also responsible for some fraction of the synthesis of sr and y. we note finally that in addition to our abundance determination for 22 , the halo giant cs  31081001 ( the hill  2002 `` uranium '' star ) also has very enhanced [ eu / fe ] @xmath42 [ zr / fe ] .",
    "it may be that in these very @xmath1-process - enhanced stars , this kind of @xmath4-capture nucleosynthesis contribution overwhelms the light primary process proposed by travaglio   perhaps as a result of fission recycling .",
    "we note that the relative constancy of [ zr / fe ] with both [ fe / h ] and [ eu / fe ] supports the conclusion of johnson and bolte ( 2002 ) - based on the constancy of the ratio [ y / zr ] with respect to [ zr / fe ] and [ ba / fe ] - that the source of zr in metal - poor stars must be the same for both the @xmath1-process - rich and @xmath1-process - poor stars .",
    "the heavy element abundance patterns presented here exhibit striking differences as a function of metallicity .",
    "the linear correlation ( with very small scatter ) of ge and fe abundances suggests that ge must have been produced rather commonly in stars  even at early times in the galaxy  over a wide range of metallicity .",
    "the zr abundances show much the same behavior as ge with ( perhaps ) somewhat more scatter , suggesting some variations in abundance with respect to fe .",
    "the pattern of the heavy @xmath4-capture elements eu , os , ir and pt is however very different than that of ge and zr . there is a very large star - to - star scatter in the abundance values with respect to iron , particularly at low metallicity  a factor of @xmath2 100 at [ fe / h ]  @xmath18  2.5 .",
    "( we note that while there is only one star , hd 122563 , in our sample with a very low [ eu / fe ] ratio , observations ( see _ e.g. _ , burris et al .",
    "2000 ) have indicated other such stars . at higher metallicities this scatter diminishes dramatically",
    "this general notion is of course not new , having been seen previously for eu ( see e.g. , gilroy  1988 ; burris  2000 ; sneden & cowan 2003 ) .",
    "this is the first clear indication that  @xmath1-process peak elements also show the same scatter .",
    "these apparently conflicting trends can be explained by assuming that at early times ( and some low metallicities ) the galaxy was chemically inhomogeneous with some regions containing larger amounts of @xmath1-process ejecta than others .",
    "then at higher metallicities ( and later times ) these differences in the total abundance levels would be minimized  this would be as a result of a higher number of events , which would produce an abundance average , and probably mixing throughout the galaxy . thus , from ge to zr to eu - os - ir - pt we might be witnessing decreasing event statistics , , a smaller number of ( supernova ) sites at very low metallicities , which create these elements ( cowan & thielemann 2004 and references therein ) .",
    "this might further indicate that not all supernovae , or at least those that make lighter @xmath4-capture elements like ge and zr , are responsible for synthesizing the heavier @xmath4-capture elements ( these @xmath1-process events would have been rare ) at very low metallicities early in the history of the galaxy .",
    "such abundance comparisons and scatter ( , [ eu / fe ] versus [ fe / h ] ) are also providing new clues into the earliest stars and the chemical evolution of the galaxy ( , wasserburg & qian 2000 ; fields , truran & cowan 2002 ) and the nature of and site for the @xmath1-process , particularly early in the galaxy ( argast  2004 ) .",
    "two of our sample stars are the very @xmath1-process rich stars 22 and 17 . employing our new observations and new , more reliable abundance determinations for nd ( den hartog  2003 ) and ho ( lawler , sneden , & cowan 2004 ) , we have updated and supplemented the ( ground - based and hst ) abundances previously obtained for 22  ( sneden  2003 ) and 17 ( cowan  2002 ) .",
    "we show in figure  [ fig7 ] the detailed abundance distributions for both of these stars .",
    "the values for 17 have been arbitrarily displaced downward for display purposes .",
    "we also show for comparison the solar system @xmath1-process abundances ( solid lines ) , determined based upon the classical @xmath5-process model and utilizing the most recent @xmath1-/@xmath5-process deconvolution reported by simmerer  ( 2004 ) .",
    "several points are worth noting in this figure .",
    "the agreement between the rare earth elements ( , ba and eu ) and the solar system @xmath1-process abundances is now seen to extend into , and includes , the  @xmath1-process peak elements os  pt in 22 and 17 .",
    "note that employing the new atomic experimental data of den hartog  ( 2005 ) results in a shift downward of 0.1 dex  with respect to the previously determined value  in the abundance of pt .",
    "this element ( along with os and ir ) now falls on the same scaled solar system @xmath1-process curve that also matches the abundances of the rare - earth elements such as eu , strengthening the apparent synthesis connection between these heavier @xmath4-capture elements .    our new , more reliable abundance determinations for the elements nd and ho are also consistent with the solar system @xmath1-process distribution .",
    "however , as shown in figure  [ fig7 ] , the abundances of elements with z  @xmath18  56 ( , below ba ) in general fall below the scaled solar @xmath1-process curve for 22 .",
    "there is very little data available for 17  in this region of 40  @xmath8  z  @xmath8  50 , but its ag abundance , in particular , is much less than the scaled solar - system @xmath1-process curve .",
    "only upper limits on ge and ga were obtained with hst for 22 , but those abundances fall far below the solar curve , as does the ge abundance in 17 .",
    "this indicates that there may be two processes and may suggest two astrophysical sites for @xmath1-process nucleosynthesis  with one for lighter and another for the heavier @xmath4-capture elements .",
    "this possibility was suggested earlier ( see wasserburg , busso , & gallino 1996 and wasserburg & qian 2000 ) with supernovae with different masses and frequencies responsible for the two ends of the @xmath4-capture abundance distribution .",
    "other models have suggested neutron - star binary mergers as one of the possible sites , particularly for the heavier @xmath4-capture elements where supernovae models have had difficulties in achieving the required high entropies ( freiburghaus  1999 ; rosswog , rosswog , & thielemann 1999 ; but see argast  2004 ) .",
    "in addition to a combination of supernovae and neutron - star mergers , it has been suggested that the light and heavy @xmath4-capture elements could also be synthesized in the same core - collapse supernova ( cameron 2001 ; see also recent reviews by cowan & sneden 2004 and cowan & thielemann 2004 for further discussion ) .",
    "we have made new detections of the elements ge , zr , os , and pt with hst ( stis ) , along with ir using keck i ( hires ) , in a sample of metal - poor galactic halo stars .",
    "these are the first large - sample abundance determinations of these elements in such stars .",
    "the abundances of the elements os , ir and pt , in the @xmath1-process peak appear to be correlated among themselves and with eu  the extensively observed , rare - earth , @xmath1-process element  indicating a similar nucleosynthesis origin and site .",
    "in contrast the ge abundance appears to scale with iron in the halo stars and is independent of the eu abundances in those stars .",
    "this suggests an explosive , rather than @xmath4-capture , synthesis for this element in stars at very low metallicities . perhaps this might be the result of some type of alpha - rich freeze out in sne early in the history of the galaxy  at higher ( _ e.g. _ , near solar ) metallicities , and later times",
    ", it would be expected that @xmath1- and @xmath5-process production would dominate production .",
    "the zr abundances in the sample stars do not in general scale with metallicity , nor with the eu abundances , suggesting a different origin for this element than for the heavier @xmath4-capture elements .",
    "the one exception is for the very @xmath1-process rich ( high eu abundance ) star 22 , where there is a significant increase in the zr abundance .",
    "this element , however , has a complicated synthesis with perhaps several processes contributing ( see _ e.g. _ , travaglio et al .",
    "2004 ) .",
    "the star - to - star abundance scatter among the elements is quite different , with the lighter element ge showing very little scatter over the range of metallicity studied .",
    "this suggests a common origin - most sne making this element - even at very low metallicities . zr like ge also shows little scatter with iron except for the case again of 22 .",
    "it has been shown previously that [ eu / fe ] exhibits a large star - to - star scatter as a function of metallicity ( see _ e.g. _ burris et al .",
    "our results are the first demonstration that the abundances of the @xmath1-process elements os - ir - pt to iron coincide with and exhibit a similar scatter to [ eu / fe ] , again suggesting a similar origin for these four elements .",
    "these new elemental abundance scatter data also appear to be consistent with the idea that not all supernovae will make eu ( and os - pt )  these appear to be rarer events than the synthesis of , for example , ge and zr  and to point to a lack of chemical homogeneity early in the history of the galaxy .",
    "the new abundance determinations for os - ir - pt fall on the same solar system scaled @xmath1-process curves as the rare - earth elements in the @xmath1-process rich stars 22 and 17 .",
    "this agreement ( or consistency ) now extends from ba through the @xmath1-process peak for these stars , again indicating a similar synthesis origin for these elements .",
    "the observed abundances of the lighter @xmath4-capture elements ( ge and zr ) do not fall on the same solar curve that matches the heavier such elements , and may indicate two sites , or at least astrophysical conditions , for the synthesis of all of the @xmath4-capture elements .    while the astrophysical site for the @xmath1-process has still not been precisely identified ( see _ e.g.",
    "_ , cowan & thielemann 2004 ) , the abundance determinations presented here are consistent with a supernova origin and suggest that not all supernovae may be responsible for synthesizing these @xmath4-capture elements . however , additional abundance determinations particularly over a range of mass number including both lighter and heavier @xmath4-capture elements  in stars of very low metallicity will be needed to constrain models of @xmath1-process production , determine if there are multiple sites and to understand the history of element , and star , formation at very early times in the history of the galaxy .",

    "<S> our results demonstrate that abundances of the  @xmath1-process peak elements os , ir and pt in these metal - poor halo stars are very well - correlated among themselves , and with the abundances of the canonical @xmath1-process element eu ( determined in other studies ) , thus arguing for a common origin or site for @xmath1-process nucleosynthesis of heavier ( z  @xmath2  56 ) elements . </S>",
    "<S> however , the large ( and correlated ) scatters of [ eu , os , ir , pt / fe ] suggests that the heaviest neutron - capture @xmath1-process elements are not formed in _ all _ supernovae . in contrast , the ge abundances of all program stars track their fe abundances , very well . an explosive process on iron - peak nuclei ( </S>",
    "<S> _ e.g. _ , the @xmath3-rich freeze - out in supernovae ) , rather than neutron capture , appears to have been the dominant synthesis mechanism for this element at low metallicities  </S>",
    "<S> ge abundances seem completely uncorrelated with eu . </S>",
    "<S> the correlation ( with very small scatter ) of ge and fe abundances suggests that ge must have been produced rather commonly in stars  even at early times in the galaxy  over a wide range of metallicity . </S>",
    "<S> the zr abundances show much the same behavior as ge with ( perhaps ) somewhat more scatter , suggesting some variations in abundance with respect to fe . </S>",
    "<S> the zr abundances also do not vary cleanly with eu abundances , indicating a synthesis origin different than that of heavier neutron - capture elements .    </S>",
    "<S> detailed abundance distributions , for 22  and 17 , combining the new elemental determinations for os - pt and recently published nd and ho measurements , show excellent agreement with the solar system @xmath1-process curve from the elements ba to pb . the lighter @xmath4-capture elements , including ge , in general fall below the same solar system @xmath1-process curve that matches the heavier elements . </S>"
