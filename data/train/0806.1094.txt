    "modern nucleon - nucleon ( @xmath14 ) potentials @xcite give successful description of the @xmath14 scattering data at low energies and have been used for precision calculations in light nuclei @xcite .",
    "similarly , hyperon - nucleon ( @xmath15 ) and hyperon - hyperon ( @xmath16 ) potentials in the coordinate space are known to be quite useful and important for studying the properties of hypernuclei @xcite as well as the equation of state for hyperonic matter in neutron stars @xcite . however , there are still large experimental uncertainties in @xmath15 and @xmath16 interactions at present , because the short life - time of the hyperons makes the scattering experiments difficult . accordingly ,",
    "phenomenological @xmath15 and @xmath16 potentials are not well constrained from data even under some theoretical guides @xcite .",
    "in such a situation , it would be desirable to analyse hyperon interactions on the basis of the first principle lattice qcd simulations .",
    "studies along this line for nucleon interactions was initiated in ref.@xcite , where the @xmath14 scattering lengths were extracted from the quenched simulations by using the lscher s finite volume method @xcite . the same method was applied later to the ( 2 + 1)-flavor simulations with the mixed action @xcite .",
    "the scattering length of @xmath17 system was first examined in @xcite in quenched simulations on a small lattice box .",
    "subsequently , @xmath17 and @xmath18 scattering lengths were studied in ( 2 + 1)-flavor simulations with the mixed action @xcite .",
    "such low - energy scattering parameters calculated in lattice qcd would be valuable inputs to construct phenomenological @xmath15 and @xmath16 potentials to be used for studying hypernuclei and hyperonic matter .",
    "recently , an alternative but closely related approach to @xcite has been proposed to define the @xmath14 potential from lattice qcd @xcite .",
    "since the potential is not a direct physical observable , one can not make quantitative comparison of this lattice @xmath14 potential with the phenomenological @xmath14 potentials .",
    "however , they are both designed to reproduce the correct scattering phase shifts , and their spatial structures are found to have common features @xcite ; the attraction at long and intermediate distances and the strong repulsion at short distance in the @xmath19-wave channel @xcite .    the purpose of the present paper is to report our first attempt to apply the above approach to the hyperon - nucleon systems . for the @xmath14 potential , only two channels ( isovector and isoscalar )",
    "exist in the flavor su(2 ) space , i.e. , @xmath20 . including the strange quark extends this to @xmath21 in the flavor su(3 ) space .",
    "the isovector ( isoscalar ) channel in the @xmath14 sector is assigned to be a subset in the @xmath22-plet ( @xmath23-plet ) representation .",
    "the potentials in newly arising channels are hardly determined from experiments so far .    in this paper , we focus on the @xmath24 potential in the isovector ( @xmath25 ) channel as a first step .",
    "( a preliminary account of this system has been reported in @xcite . )",
    "there are two main reasons for picking up this channel : ( i ) theoretically , it is the simplest generalization of the @xmath14 system ; @xmath8 is obtained from @xmath26 by replacing the @xmath27-quarks in the neutron by the @xmath6-quarks .",
    "also it is a channel which do not have strong decay into other @xmath15 systems . in the isoscalar",
    "( @xmath28 ) channel is above the @xmath29 threshold . ]",
    "( ii ) experimentally , not much information has been available on the @xmath24 interaction except for a few studies ; a recent report gives the upper limit of elastic and inelastic cross sections @xcite , and earlier publications suggest weakly attractive @xmath30-nucleus potential @xcite .",
    "the @xmath30-nucleus interaction will be soon studied as one of the day - one experiments at j - parc @xcite via @xmath31 reaction with nuclear target .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : formulation ] , we describe the basic formulation to derive the @xmath8 potential through the bethe - salpeter amplitude measured in the lattice qcd simulations .",
    "our lattice setup is explained in section  [ sec : setup ] . in section  [ sec : results ] , we show numerical results of the potentials in the spin - singlet and spin - triplet channels and their quark mass dependence .",
    "we also show the estimate of the scattering lengths in these channels .",
    "section  [ sec : summary ] is devoted to summary and concluding remarks .",
    "our methodology to obtain the baryon potentials is along the lines of @xcite .",
    "( see also @xcite for the seminal attempts to introduce similar notion of the potential . )",
    "we consider the low - energy @xmath32-@xmath30 scattering and start with an effective schrdinger equation for the equal - time bethe - salpeter ( bs ) wave function @xmath33 obtained from the lippmann - schwinger equation @xcite ; @xmath34 here @xmath35 and @xmath36 are the reduced mass of the @xmath24 system and the non - relativistic energy in the center - of - mass frame , respectively .",

    "it can be shown that the non - local potential @xmath37 is energy independent .",
    "also , it is unique given the interpolating operator as long as the bs - amplitude for all energies is known @xcite . if we take other nucleon interpolating operator , both the bs wave function and the non - local potential change their spatial structure without affecting the observables such as the binding energy and the phase shift . at low energies ,",
    "the nonlocality of the potential can be expanded as @xcite @xmath38 where the dimensionless expansion parameter is @xmath39 with @xmath40 being the typical scale of the strong interaction such as the excitation energy of a single baryon .",

    "we note that the antisymmetric spin - orbit forces ( @xmath53 and @xmath54 ) do not arise in the @xmath14 case because of the identical nature of the nucleon within the isospin symmetry .",

    "it is in order here to make some remarks on the potential we have defined .    1 .",
    "the description by the energy - independent non - local potential @xmath37 is equivalent to that by the momentum - dependent local potential , @xmath98 .",
    "the potential @xmath94 in eq.([effcpot ] ) is the leading order term of the derivative expansion of @xmath98 and can be determined by the bs wave function at @xmath99 .",
