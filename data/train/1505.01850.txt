    "precise measurements of the physical properties of pre - main sequence ( pre - ms ) stars are fundamental to testing the theoretical predictions of stellar evolution models .",
    "such models are in turn the basis for deriving a variety of interesting quantities in star - formation research , including the masses and ages of individual pre - ms stars from secondary properties ( such as effective temperature and luminosity ) , the initial mass function ( imf ) of star - forming regions , and the timescale for circumstellar disk evolution and planet formation , among many others . to successfully test and help refine theoretical models of pre - ms evolution",
    ", we require a sample of  benchmark \" systems where the fundamental properties are known . the key constraint for such systems is a direct ( i.e. , dynamical ) measurement of the stellar mass .",
    "unfortunately , few such benchmarks exist , particularly at the low end of the mass spectrum ( @xmath7 m@xmath8 ) where the models are in greatest need of calibration ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "eclipsing binaries ( ebs ) have long served as important empirical touchstones for testing stellar models .",
    "however , the recent review of pre - ms benchmarks by @xcite identified only 21 low - mass ebs that have sufficiently precise measurements of their physical parameters to be suitable for testing evolutionary models .",
    "the same review also presented new evidence that many of the benchmark pre - ms ebs may have their temperatures and/or radii altered by the influence of tertiary companions which , while representing interesting physics in their own right , render them less suitable to direct tests of the evolutionary models that do not include such effects ( see also * ? ? ? * )",
    ".    therefore , additional pre - ms stellar mass benchmarks are crucial .",
    "ideally , these would include single stars , or binaries without the potentially complicating effects of a tertiary component .",
    "in particular , single or binary pre - ms stars with circumstellar or circumbinary disks offer the opportunity to dynamically measure the stellar masses using the keplerian orbital motion ( i.e. , rotation curve ) of the gas disk ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    to be sure , there are additional complications with the analysis of such systems , including accretion effects , isolating the individual component masses in the case of a close binary ( since the dynamical mass is then the total binary mass ) , and a systematic ( linear ) dependence on the ( still uncertain ) distance",
    "however , such systems are much more common than the intrinsically rare ebs , and therefore represent an important opportunity to significantly expand the sample of benchmark pre - ms stars .",
    "this is particularly compelling now , as alma has started to provide unprecedented sensitivity to molecular line emission from disks , and the upcoming _ gaia _ mission is poised to give accurate distances to these systems . just as important as the ongoing determination of empirical masses for more of these pre - ms systems",
    "is the development of robust procedures for their careful analysis , including sophisticated molecular line modeling approaches and the incorporation of state - of - the - art statistical methods for comparing the stellar properties to current theoretical pre - ms evolution models .",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "given the eccentricity of the binary , one might also expect that the inclination estimates could be biased due to the assumptions of circular disk and ring structures .",

    "<S> we present spatially and spectrally resolved atacama large millimeter / submillimeter array ( alma ) observations of gas and dust in the disk orbiting the pre - main sequence binary ak sco . by forward - modeling the disk velocity field traced by co @xmath0=2@xmath11 line emission , </S>",
    "<S> we infer the mass of the central binary , @xmath2@xmath3 , a new dynamical measurement that is independent of stellar evolutionary models . assuming the disk and binary are co - planar within @xmath42 , this disk - based binary mass measurement is in excellent agreement with constraints from radial velocity monitoring of the combined stellar spectra . </S>",
    "<S> these alma results are also compared with the standard approach of estimating masses from the location of the binary in the hertzsprung - russell diagram , using several common pre - main sequence model grids . </S>",
    "<S> these models predict stellar masses that are marginally consistent with our dynamical measurement ( at @xmath42@xmath5 ) , but are systematically high ( by @xmath410% ) . </S>",
    "<S> these same models consistently predict an age of @xmath6myr for ak sco , in line with its membership in the upper centaurus - lupus association but surprisingly old for it to still host a gas - rich disk . </S>",
    "<S> as alma accumulates comparable data for large samples of pre - main sequence stars , the methodology employed here to extract a dynamical mass from the disk rotation curve should prove extraordinarily useful for efforts to characterize the fundamental parameters of early stellar evolution . </S>"
