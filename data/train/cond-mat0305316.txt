    "in general , the introduction of continuous versions of discrete spin models in statistical mechanics has always been welcomed . since the work of kac and berlin @xcite the spherical model has lead to a better understanding of a lot of basic phenomena due to the fact that they simplify the mathematical calculations considerably . in spin glass research",
    "there is no doubt that an important role has been played by the spherical p - spin spin glass model @xcite @xcite .",
    "since then it has been quite remarkable to see how a mean - field model with spherical spins resembles the results of realistic structural glasses ( see , e.g. , the many references in @xcite ) .    in neural network theory",
    "the hopfield model is by now a well known _",
    "classic _ found in many textbooks ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite ) to study storage and retrieval in associative memory problems .",
    "strangely enough , a spherical version of it has not yet been studied in the literature .",
    "one of the reasons might be that by relaxing the neurons from ising - type to spherical - type variables the retrieval phase is absent , i.e. one of the most important properties of this model is lost .    in this work",
    "we show that this problem has an easy and elegant solution . by introducing a quartic potential term in the hopfield hamiltonian such that the neurons stay spherical the retrieval phase is recovered . in this way we obtain a simplified version of the hopfield model with an exactly solvable thermodynamics leading to marginally replica symmetric results .",
    "a phase diagram is obtained with an explicit solution for the spin - glass retrieval ` transition ' line , showing no re - entrance . moreover , the region of global stability for the retrieval solutions is larger than the corresponding region in the standard hopfield model .",
    "next , we study the relaxational langevin dynamics of this model leading to a closed set of equations for the order parameters and effective correlation and response functions , typical for neural networks .",
    "these equations are similar to those of other models with continuous spins ( see , e.g , @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "we discuss the evolution of the overlap order parameter in the retrieval phase .",
    "the stationary limit of the dynamics is found to correspond to the thermodynamic results .",
    "the numerical solution of the dynamics illustrates this behaviour .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we introduce the model .",
    "section 3 contains the thermodynamical properties with the temperature - capacity phase diagram . in section 4",
    "we study the dynamics showing the evolution of the retrieval overlap .",
    "finally , section 5 summarizes our conclusions .",
    "the hopfield model @xcite is defined through the following mean - field ising - type hamiltonian @xmath2 where the couplings @xmath3 are related with the information one wants to store in the network through the hebbian rule @xmath4 with @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the loading capacity of the network . in this work , the @xmath7 patterns @xmath8 are choosen to be a collection of continuous indepnedent identical random variables ( i.i.d.r.v . ) with respect to @xmath9 and @xmath10 and drawn from a gaussian distribution @xmath11\\ ] ] and the neurons ( spins ) are also taken to be continuous and to satisfy the spherical constraint @xmath12 as we will show explicitly below this setup of the spherical hopfield model does not allow for a retrieval phase .",
    "therefore , we add the following term to the hamiltonian ( [ hopham ] ) @xmath13 which is a quartic term in the order parameter @xmath14 characterizing the retrieval phase @xmath15    the introduction of this quartic term turns out to contribute macroscopically to the condensed part of the free energy but it only leads to sub - extensive contributions to the noise produced by the non - condensed patterns and to a sub - extensive contribution coming from the diagonal terms , as we now discuss in the following section .",
    "we apply the standard replica technique @xcite in order to study the thermodynamical properties of the model defined above . starting from the hamiltonian @xmath16 and assuming , for simplicity",
    ", one condensed pattern , the replicated free energy per site becomes @xmath17 with @xmath18 in this expression @xmath19 are the retrieval overlap , respectively the neuron ( spin ) overlap order parameters , @xmath20 are conjugate variables and @xmath21    within a k - th order parisi replica breaking scheme we assume that the spin overlap matrix has the following ( ultrametric ) structure @xmath22 with @xmath23 a set of real numbers and @xmath24 a set of integers such that @xmath25 is an integer ( @xmath26,@xmath27 ) , and we introduce the inverse of the parisi function @xmath28 in the limit @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 such that the free energy per site reads in the limit @xmath32 @xmath33=   & -\\frac{\\beta}{2}m^2-\\frac{u_0\\beta } { 4}m^4      + \\frac{\\alpha\\beta}{2}-\\big(\\alpha        + \\frac{1}{2}\\big)\\ln 2\\pi-\\frac{1}{2 }         + \\frac{\\alpha } { 2}\\big[\\ln\\big[1-\\beta(1-q_m)\\big ] \\\\ & \\hspace{-2 cm } -\\beta\\int_0^{q_m}\\frac{dq}{1-\\beta\\int_{q}^1 x(q')dq'}\\big ]      -\\frac{1}{2}\\big[\\int_{0}^{q_m } \\frac{dq}{\\int_{q}^1x(q')dq ' }            + \\ln(1-q_m)-\\frac{m^2}{\\int_{0}^1 x(q)dq}\\big ] \\ , , \\end{split}\\ ] ] where @xmath34 has to be extremized with respect to @xmath35 and @xmath14 . taking , in general , @xmath35 to be a piece - wise continuous function it is straightforward to show following @xcite that the solution for @xmath35 reads @xmath36 and , hence , the replica solution is exact .",
    "the free energy then reads @xmath37-\\frac{\\beta q}{1-\\beta(1-q)}\\big ]   -\\frac{1}{2}\\big[\\ln[1-q]+\\frac{q - m^2}{1-q }                   \\big]\\right\\ } \\end{split}\\ ] ] with @xmath38 , the edwards - anderson orderparameter and @xmath39 .    in agreement with this",
    ", one can show by investigating the stability against replica symmetry breaking fluctuations that the replicon eigenvalue is zero and , hence , the replica symmetric result is marginally stable .",
    "the saddle - point equations then become simple algebraic equations for @xmath40 and @xmath14 @xmath41 with @xmath42 the susceptibility .",
    "we immediately remark that when we remove the quartic interaction by setting @xmath43 there exist no solution with @xmath44 and , hence , there is no retrieval possible .",
    "henceforth , we take @xmath45 . the corresponding @xmath46 phase diagram is shown in fig .  1 .",
    "let us compare this result with the phase diagram of the standard hopfield model calculated in a replica symmetric approximation @xcite .",
    "again we have three phases . for temperatures above the broken line @xmath47",
    ", there exist paramagnetic solutions characterized by @xmath48 , while below the broken line , spin glass solutions , @xmath49 but @xmath50 , exist .",
    "the transition between the paramagnetic and the spin glass phase is continuous and the line @xmath47 separating the two phases is easily computed @xmath51 as in the standard hopfield model .",
    "next , below the thin full line @xmath52 , ( locally stable ) retrieval solutions , @xmath44 and @xmath50 , appear .",
    "the transition between the spin - glass and the retrieval phase is , however , a discontinous transition . using then the information that the values of both the order parameters @xmath40 and @xmath14 jump when passing this line @xmath52 , it is possible to find an analytical expression for the latter .",
    "writing the equations as two polynomials in @xmath40 and @xmath14 , a jump means that complex roots of these two polynomials become real at the same time for all values of @xmath53 obtained when crossing @xmath52 .",

    "below the thick full line , @xmath58 , the retrieval states become globally stable . at this point",
    "we remark that , compared with the standard hopfield model , there is no re - entrance behaviour in the transitions since the spherical model is ( marginally ) replica symmetric .",
    "furthermore , the region of global stability for the retrieval solutions in the spherical model is much larger .",
    "in this section we study the dynamics of the model . since the neurons are continuous , we assume the relaxational dynamics to be given by the set of langevin equations @xmath59}{\\delta \\sigma_i ( t ) }              + \\eta_i(t)+ \\theta_i(t)\\ ] ] where the first term on the rhs controls the fluctuations of the neurons , @xmath60 is gaussian noise with as first two moments @xmath61 and @xmath62 is an external perturbation field .",
    "we discuss this dynamics using the generating functional approach @xcite . in a straightforward way",
    "the following generating functional is introduced @xmath63    = \\int { \\mathbf d}[{\\mbox{\\boldmath $ { \\sigma}$}},\\widehat{{\\mbox{\\boldmath $ { \\sigma}$ } } } ]      \\exp\\big[\\sum_{i=1}^n\\int dt\\psi_i(t)i\\sigma_i(t )                               + a[{\\mbox{\\boldmath $ { \\sigma}$}},\\widehat{{\\mbox{\\boldmath $ { \\sigma}$}}}]\\big]\\ ] ] with the action @xmath64 $ ] given by @xmath65 = \\sum_{i=1}^n\\int dt\\big\\{-t\\widehat{\\sigma}^2_i(t )     + i\\widehat{\\sigma}_i(t )        \\big(\\frac{\\partial \\sigma_i ( t)}{\\partial t }         + \\mu(t)\\sigma_i ( t)-\\theta_i(t )         + \\frac{\\delta { \\cal h}[{\\mbox{\\boldmath $ { \\sigma}$}}]}{\\delta \\sigma_i ( t)}\\big)\\big\\}\\ ] ] where the @xmath66 are the generating fields , @xmath67 are conjugate variables and @xmath68 $ ] is the measure in path space . from this expression",
    "all physical quantities of interest can be computed by taking derivatives with respect to the generating and the external perturbation fields .",
    "assuming that the initial neuron configuration is correlated with only one pattern , i.e. the condensed one , and averaging over the disorder we arrive , after some algebra , at the following effective single site dynamics in the thermodynamic limit @xmath69\\xi^1+\\theta(t )     + \\alpha\\int dt'[({{\\bf 1}\\hspace{-1mm}{\\bf i}}-{\\bf g})^{-1}{\\bf g}](t , t')\\sigma(t')+\\phi(t)\\ ] ] where @xmath70 is a colored noise with mean value and variance @xmath71^{-1}{\\bf c}[{{\\bf 1}\\hspace{-1mm}{\\bf i}}-{\\bf g}^\\dag]^{-1}(t , t')\\,.\\ ] ] in this expression @xmath72 is the retrieval overlap @xmath73 and the matrices @xmath74 and @xmath75 are the dynamical order parameters of the problem , i.e. the correlation and response functions @xmath76 with @xmath77 the average over the condensed pattern and @xmath78 the average over the effective noise @xmath70 .",
