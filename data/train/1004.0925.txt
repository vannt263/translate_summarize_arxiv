    "the experimental program of the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) at brookhaven national laboratory probes quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) from numerous directions . the extraordinary flexibility of the machine permits collisions between heavy and light ions at record energies ( up to  ) , polarized and unpolarized protons , and strongly asymmetric systems such as  .",
    "the proton collisions are the focus of an intense program exploring the spin structure of the nucleon .",
    "however , these collisions also serve as a critical `` baseline '' measurement for the heavy ion physics program that drove the construction of rhic .",
    "studies of ultrarelativistic heavy ion collisions aim to explore the equation of state of strongly interacting matter .",
    "the highly dynamic nature of the collisions , however , does not allow a purely statistical study of static matter as one might perform in condensed matter physics , but rather requires a detailed understanding of the dynamics itself . if a bulk , self - interacting system is formed ( something that should not be assumed _ a priori _ )",
    ", the equation of state then plays the dynamic role of generating pressure gradients that drive the collective expansion of the system .",
    "copious evidence  @xcite indicates that a self - interacting system is , in fact , generated in these collisions .",
    "the dynamics of the bulk medium is reflected in the transverse momentum ( @xmath0 ) distribution  @xcite and momentum - space anisotropy ( e.g. `` elliptic flow '' )  @xcite of identified particles at low @xmath0 .",
    "these observables are well - described in a hydrodynamic scenario , in which a nearly perfect ( i.e. very low viscocity ) fluid expands explosively under the action of pressure gradients induced by the collision  @xcite .",
    "two - particle femtoscopy  @xcite ( often called `` hbt '' analysis ) measures the space - time substructure of the emitting source at `` freeze - out , '' the point at which particles decouple from the system  ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "femtoscopic measurements play a special role in understanding bulk dynamics in heavy ion collisions , for several reasons .",
    "firstly , collective flow generates characteristic space - momentum patterns at freezeout that are revealed  @xcite in the momentum - dependence of pion `` hbt radii '' ( discussed below ) , the transverse mass dependence of homogeneity lengths  @xcite , and non - identical particle correlations  @xcite . secondly , while a simultaneous description of particle - identified @xmath0 distributions , elliptic flow and femtoscopic measurements is easily achieved in flow - dominated toy models  ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , achieving the same level of agreement in a realistic transport calculation is considerably more challenging .",
    "in particular , addressing this `` hbt puzzle ''  @xcite has led to a deeper understanding of the freezeout hypersurface , collectivity in the initial stage , and the equation of state .",
    "femtoscopic signals of long dynamical timescales expected for a system undergoing a first - order phase transition  @xcite , have not been observed  @xcite , providing early evidence that the system at rhic evolves from qgp to hadron gas via a crossover  @xcite .",
    "this sensitive and unique connection to important underlying physics has motivated a huge systematic study of femtoscopic measurements in heavy ion collisions over the past quarter century  @xcite .",
    "hbt correlations from hadron ( e.g.  ) and lepton ( e.g.  ) collisions have been extensively studied in the high energy physics community , as well  @xcite , although the theoretical interpretation of the results is less clear and not well developed . until now",
    ", it has been impossible to quantitatively compare femtoscopic results from hadron - hadron collisions to those from heavy ion collisions , due to divergent and often undocumented analysis techniques , detector acceptances and fitting functions historically used in the high energy community  @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we exploit the unique opportunity offered by the star / rhic experiment , to make the first direct comparison and quantitative connection between femtoscopy in proton - proton and heavy ion collisions .",
    "systematic complications in comparing these collisions are greatly reduced by using an identical detector and reconstruction software , collision energies , and analysis techniques ( e.g. event mixing  @xcite , see below ) .",
    "we observe and discuss the importance of non - femtoscopic correlations in the analysis of small systems , and put our femtoscopic results for  collisions into the context both of heavy ion collisions and ( as much as possible ) of previous high - energy measurements on hadron - hadron and  collisions .",
    "these results may play a role in understanding the physics behind the space - momentum correlations in these collisions , in the same way that comparison of  and heavy ion collision results in the high-@xmath0 sector is crucial for understanding the physics of partonic energy loss  @xcite .",
    "our direct comparison also serves as a model and baseline for similar comparisons soon to be possible at higher energies at the large hadron collider .",

    "these two forms ( as well as others that can be found in literature  @xcite ) are purely empirical , motivated essentially by the shape of the observed correlation function itself . while most authors attribute these effects primarily to momentum conservation in these low - multiplicity systems , the parameters and functional forms themselves can not be directly connected to this or any physical mechanism . one may identify two dangers of using an ad - hoc form to quantify non - femtoscopic contributions to @xmath19 .",
    "firstly , while they describe ( by construction ) the correlation function well at large @xmath13 , for which femtoscopic contributions vanish , there is no way to constrain their behaviour at low @xmath13 where both femtoscopic and ( presumably ) non - femtoscopic correlations exist .",
    "even simple effects like momentum conservation give rise to non - femtoscopic correlations that vary non - trivially even at low @xmath13 .",
    "misrepresenting the non - femtoscopic contribution in @xmath32 can therefore distort the femtoscopic radius parameters in @xmath33 , especially considering the small radius values in  collisions .",
    "secondly , there is no way to estimate whether the best - fit parameter values in an ad - hoc functional form are physically `` reasonable . ''",
    "if the non - femtoscopic correlations are in fact dominated by energy and momentum conservation , as is usually supposed , one may derive an analytic functional form for @xmath68 .",
    "in particular , the multiparticle phase space constraints for a system of @xmath69 particles project onto the two - particle space as  @xcite    @xmath70    where    @xmath71    the notation @xmath72 in equation  [ eq : emcics ] is used to indicate that @xmath73 is the average of a two - particle quantity which depends on @xmath2 and @xmath3 ( or @xmath12 , etc ) .",

    "recent `` imaging '' fits approximate the two - particle emission zone as a sum of spline functions , the weights of which are the parameters  @xcite ; the number of splines ( hence weights ) used is @xmath91 .",
    "other fits ( e.g. double gaussian , exponential - plus - gaussian )  @xcite contain a similar number of femtoscopic parameters . in all cases , a distinct set of parameters",
    "is extracted for each selection of @xmath10 ( c.f .",
    "equation  [ eq : cfexp ] and surrounding discussion ) .",
    "accounting for the non - femtoscopic correlations inevitably increases the total number of fit parameters .",
    "the `` @xmath67 '' functional form ( eq .  [ eq : zetabeta ] ) involves two parameters , the `` @xmath62 '' form ( eq .  [ eq : dq3d ] ) three , and the emcic form ( eq .  [ eq : emcics ] ) four .",
    "however , it is important to keep in mind that using the @xmath67 ( @xmath62 ) form means 2 ( 3 ) additional parameters _ for each selection _ of @xmath10 when forming the correlation functions .",
    "on the other hand , the four emcic parameters can not depend on @xmath10 .",
    "therefore , when fitting @xmath92 for four selections of @xmath10 , use of the @xmath67 , @xmath62 and emcic forms increases the total number of parameters by 8 , 12 and 4 , respectively .",
    "as mentioned in section  [ sec : intro ] , there is significant advantage in analyzing  collisions in the same way that heavy ion collisions are analyzed .",
    "therefore , the results discussed in this paper are produced with the same techniques and acceptance cuts as have been used for previous pion femtoscopy studies by star  @xcite .",
    "here we discuss some of the main points ; full systematic studies of cuts and techniques can be found in  @xcite .",
    "the primary sub - detector used in this analysis to reconstruct particles is the time projection chamber ( tpc )  @xcite .",
    "pions could be identified up to a momentum of 800  by correlating their momentum and specific ionization loss ( @xmath93 ) in the tpc gas .",
    "a particle was considered to be a pion if its @xmath93 value for a given momentum was within two sigma of the bichsel expectation  @xcite ( an improvement on the bethe - bloch formula  @xcite for thin materials ) for a pion , and more than two sigma from the expectations for electrons , kaons and protons . by varying the cuts on energy loss to allow more or less contamination from kaons or electrons",
    ", we estimate that impurities in the pion sample lead to an uncertainty in the femtoscopic scale parameters ( e.g. hbt radii ) of only about 1% .",
    "particles were considered for analysis if their reconstructed tracks produced hits on at least 10 of the 45 padrows , and their distance of closest approach ( dca ) to the primary vertex was less than 3  cm .",
    "the lower momentum cut of 120  is imposed by the tpc acceptance and the magnetic field . only tracks at midrapidity ( @xmath94 ) were included in the femtoscopic analysis .",
    "events were recorded based on a coincidence trigger of two beam - beam counters ( bbcs ) , annular scintillator detectors located @xmath95  m from the interaction region and covering pseudorapidity range @xmath96 .",
    "events were selected for analysis if the primary collision vertex was within 30  cm of the center of the tpc . the further requirement that events include at least two like - sign pions increases the average charged particle multiplicity with @xmath97 from 3.0 ( without the requirement ) to 4.25 . since particle _ pairs _ enter into the correlation function , the effective average multiplicity is higher ; in particular , the pair - weighted charged - particle multiplicity at midrapidity is about 6.0 . after event cuts ,",
    "about 5 million minimum bias events from  collisions at  were used .",
    "two - track effects , such as splitting ( one particle reconstructed as two tracks ) and merging ( two particles reconstructed as one track ) were treated identically as has been done in star analyses of  collisions  @xcite .",
    "both effects can affect the shape of @xmath19 at very low @xmath98  , regardless of the colliding system .",
    "however , their effect on the extracted sizes in  collisions turns out to be smaller than statistical errors , due to the fact that small ( @xmath99  fm ) sources lead to large ( @xmath100  ) femtoscopic structures in the correlation function .",
    "the analysis presented in this paper was done for four bins in average transverse momentum @xmath101  ( @xmath102 ) : 150 - 250 , 250 - 350 , 350 - 450 and 450 - 600  .",

    "clearly one possibility is that there is no universal multiplicity dependence of the femtoscopic scales ; the underlying physics driving the space - time freezeout geometry may be quite different , considering   varies from 44 to 1800  gev in the plot .",
    "however , even if there were an underlying universality between these systems , it is not at all clear that it would appear in this figure , due to various difficulties in tabulating historical data  @xcite .",
    "firstly , as discussed in section  [ sec : formalism ] the experiments used different fitting functions to extract the hbt radii , making direct comparison between them difficult . secondly , as we have shown , the radii depend on both multiplicity and @xmath101 .",
    "since , for statistical reasons , the results in fig .  [",
    "fig : multscaling ] are integrated over the acceptance of each experiment , and these acceptances differ strongly , any universal scaling would be obscured .",
    "for example , since the acceptance of tevatron experiment e735  @xcite is weighted towards higher @xmath101 than the other measurements , one expects a systematically lower hbt radius , at a given multiplicity . indeed , even the `` universal '' multiplicity scaling in heavy ion collisions is only universal for a fixed selection in @xmath101 .",
    "thirdly , the measure used to quantify the event multiplicity varies significantly in the historical literature ; thus the determination of @xmath115 for any given experiment shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : multscaling ] is only approximate .    from the discussion above",
    ", we can not conclude definitively that there is or is not a universal multiplicity scaling of femtoscopic radii in high energy hadron - hadron collisions .",
    "we conclude only that an increase of these radii with multiplicity is observed in all measurements for which @xmath116  gev and that the present analysis of  collisions is consistent with world systematics .    in section  [ sec : results ]",
    ", we discussed the @xmath0-dependence of hbt radii observed in our analysis .",
    "previous experiments on high - energy collisions between hadrons and even leptons have reported similar trends . as discussed above , direct comparisons with historical high - energy measurements are problematic .",
    "comparisons between fit parameters to 1- and 2-dimensional correlation functions are shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : wsmtdep_1donly ] and  [ fig : wsmtdep_2donly ] .",
    "all experiments observe a decrease in femtoscopic parameters with increasing transverse momentum .",
    "our radii at = 200  gev fall off similarly or somewhat more than those measured at an order of magnitude lower energy at the sps  @xcite , and less than those measured at an order of magnitude higher energy at the tevatron  @xcite .",
    "it is tempting to infer that this compilation indicates an energy evolution of the @xmath0-dependence of femtoscopic radii .",
    "however , given our previous discussion , we conclude only that there is qualitative agreement between experiments at vastly different collision energies , and all show similar @xmath0 dependence .",

    "[ fig : wsmtdep_1donly],scaledwidth=45.0% ]    , compared to measurements by e735  @xcite , na27  @xcite and na22  @xcite .",
    "the sps experiments na22 and na27 set @xmath114 in their fits . star and e735 data plotted versus @xmath117 ( c.f . eq .",
    "[ eq : cfexp ] ) .",
    "na27 reported results in terms of @xmath118 and na22 in terms of @xmath119 . for purposes of plotting here ,",
    "@xmath120 was assumed .",
    "[ fig : wsmtdep_2donly],scaledwidth=45.0% ]    systematics in 3-dimensional hbt radii from hadron collisions are less clear and less abundant , though our measurements are again qualitatively similar to those reported at the sps , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : wsmtdep3d ] .",
    "there , we also plot recent results from  collisions at lep ; in those 3-dimensional analyses , the `` longitudinal '' direction is the thrust axis , whereas the beam axis is used in hadron - hadron collisions , as in heavy ion collisions .    ,",
    "we have seen that hbt radii from  collisions at rhic are qualitatively consistent with the trends observed in particle collisions over a variety of collision energies .",
    "further , they fall quantitatively into the much better - defined world systematics for heavy ion collisions at rhic and similar energies .",
    "particularly intriguing is the nearly identical dependence on @xmath103 of the hbt radii in  and heavy ion collisions , as this dependence is supposed  @xcite to reflect the underlying dynamics of the latter .",
    "several possible sources of an @xmath103 dependence of hbt radii in small systems have been put forward to explain previous measurements .",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite have suggested that the heisenberg uncertainty principle can produce the transverse momentum dependence of femtoscopic radii in  collisions .",
    "however , as discussed in  @xcite , a more detailed study of the results from  collisions complicates the quantitative comparisons of the data from various experiments and thus the interpretation .",
    "additionally , the arguments from  @xcite apply only to the longitudinal direction ( @xmath110 ) , so could not explain the dependence of all three radii .",
    "\\2 . in principle",
    ", string fragmentation should also generate space - momentum correlations in small systems , hence an @xmath103 dependence of the hbt radii . however , there are almost no quantitative predictions that can be compared with data .",
    "the numerical implementation pythia , which incorporates the lund string model into the soft sector dynamics , implements bose - einstein enhancement only as a crude parameterization designed to mock up the effect  ( c.f .",
    "section 12.4.3 of * ? ? ?",
    "* ) for the purpose of estimating distortions to @xmath121-boson invariant mass spectrum .",
    "any bose - einstein correlation function may be dialed into the model , with 13 parameters to set the hbt radius , lambda parameter , and correlation shape ; there is no first - principles predictive power . on more general grounds , the mass dependence of the femtoscopic radii",
    "can not be explained within a lund string model  @xcite .",
    "long - lived resonances may also generate the space - momentum dependence of femtoscopic radii  @xcite .",
    "however , as discussed in  @xcite , the resonances would affect the hbt radii from  collisions differently than those from  collisions , since the scale of the resonance `` halo '' is fixed by resonance lifetimes while the scale of the `` core '' is different for the two cases .",
    "thus it would have to be a coincidence that the same @xmath103 dependence is observed in both systems .",
    "nevertheless , this avenue should be explored further .",
    "have introduced a model  @xcite based on a direct proportionality between the four - momentum and space - time freeze - out position ; this model successfully described data from  collisions . the physical scenario is based on freezeout of particles emitted from a common tube , after a fixed time of 1.5  fm / c . with a very similar model ,",
    "humanic  @xcite was able to reproduce femtoscopic radii measured at the tevatron  @xcite only with strong additional hadronic rescattering effects . with rescattering in the final state , both the multiplicity- and the @xmath103-dependence of the radii",
    "were reproduced  @xcite .",
    "it has been suggested  @xcite that the @xmath0-dependence of hbt radii in very small systems might reflect bulk collective flow , as it is believed to do in heavy ion collisions .",
    "this is the only explanation that would automatically account for the nearly identical @xmath0-scaling discussed in section  [ sec : hisystematics ] .",
    "however , it is widely believed that the system created in  collisions is too small to generate bulk flow",
    ".    the remarkable similarity between the femtoscopic systematics in heavy ion and hadron collisions may well be coincidental . given the importance of the @xmath103-dependence of hbt radii in heavy ion collisions , and the unclear origin of this dependence in hadron collisions , further theoretical investigation is clearly called for .",
    "additional comparative studies of other soft - sector observables ( e.g. spectra ) may shed further light onto this coincidence .",
    "we have presented a systematic femtoscopic analysis of two - pion correlation functions from  collisions at rhic .",
    "in addition to femtoscopic effects , the data show correlations due to energy and momentum conservation .",
    "such effects have been observed previously in low - multiplicity measurements at tevatron , sps , and elsewhere . in order to compare to historical data and to identify systematic effects on the hbt radii",
    ", we have treated these effects with a variety of empirical and physically - motivated formulations . while the overall magnitude of the geometric scales vary with the method , the important systematics do not .",
    "in particular , we observe a significant positive correlation between the one- and three - dimensional radii and the multiplicity of the collision , while the radii decrease with increasing transverse momentum .",
    "qualitatively , similar multiplicity and momentum systematics have been observed previously in measurements of hadron and electron collisions at the sp@xmath122s , tevatron , isr and lep .",
    "however , the results from these experiments could not be directly compared to those from heavy ion collisions , due to differences in techniques , fitting methods , and acceptance .",
    "thus , the results presented here provide a unique possibility for a direct comparison of femtoscopy in  and  collisions .",
    "we have seen very similar @xmath0 and multiplicity scaling of the femtoscopic scales in  as in  collisions , independent of the fitting method employed . given the importance of femtoscopic systematics in understanding the bulk sector in  collisions ,",
    "further exploration of the physics behind the same scalings in  collisions is clearly important , to understand our `` reference '' system .",
    "the similarities observed could indicate a deep connection between the underlying physics of systems with size on order of the confinement scale , and of systems much larger .",
    "similar comparisons will be possible at the large hadron collider , where the higher collision energies will render conservation laws less important , especially for selections on the very highest - multiplicity collisions .",
