    "through concerted efforts from both the experimental and theoretical sides , we have deepened our understanding of the mechanism of @xmath0 production at high energies in recent years ( for a review , see ref .",
    "@xcite and references cited therein ) .",
    "yet , there are still major challenges to the theoretical models",
    ". one of them is the long - standing @xmath0 polarization puzzle .",
    "the polarization of promptly produced @xmath0 mesons , which are produced either directly or via the feed down from higher excited states such as @xmath9 ( @xmath10 ) and @xmath11 mesons , was measured by several experiments in different environments , including cdf at the fermilab tevtron @xcite ; hera - b @xcite , zeus @xcite , and h1 @xcite at desy hera ; phenix at bnl rhic @xcite ; and alice @xcite , cms @xcite , and lhcb @xcite at cern lhc .",
    "unfortunately , these measurements could not yet be explained by theoretical analyses in a way consistent with the world data on the unpolarized @xmath0 yield . the production of heavy - quarkonium states , like the @xmath0 meson , involves the creation of the heavy - quark pair ( @xmath12 ) and its subsequent transition to the hadronic bound state .",
    "different ways of treating these two parts result in different models .",
    "polarization variables are more sensitive to the fine details of the hadronization of the @xmath12 pair than production rates and , therefore , play a key role in testing the theoretical models .    due to the fact that the heavy - quark mass @xmath13 is much larger than the asymptotic scale parameter of qcd @xmath14",
    ", the heavy - quarkonium state can be approximately treated as a nonrelativistic system .",
    "the factorization formalism based on the effective field theory of nonrelativistic qcd ( nrqcd ) @xcite is nowadays considered to be the most favorable theoretical approach to study heavy - quarkonium production and decay . in this framework",
    ", the heavy - quarkonium production cross sections are factorized into process - dependent short - distance coefficients ( sdcs ) and supposedly universal long - distance matrix elements ( ldmes ) @xcite .",
    "the sdcs , which describe the production of the @xmath12 pair at energy scales @xmath15 or larger , can be calculated perturbatively through expansions in the strong - coupling constant @xmath16 .",
    "the ldmes , which measure the probability of the hadronization of the @xmath12 pair , are weighted by definite powers of the relative velocity @xmath17 of the heavy quarks in the heavy - meson rest frame @xcite . in this way ,",
    "theoretical calculations are organized as double expansions in @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "quantum corrections come as terms of higher orders in @xmath16 and relativistic corrections as terms of higher orders in @xmath18 .",
    "thus , next - to - leading - order ( nlo ) results include corrections of orders @xmath19 and @xmath20 relative to the leading - order ( lo ) result .",
    "next - to - next - to - leading - order results also include terms of relative orders @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , and so on . a crucial difference between the nrqcd factorization formalism and the conventional color - singlet ( cs ) model is that the former allows for the @xmath12 pair to be in any possible fock state @xmath24}$ ] with total spin @xmath25 , orbital angular momentum @xmath26 , total angular momentum @xmath27 , and color multiplicity @xmath28 , while the latter is restricted to the cs state , with @xmath29 , sharing the quantum numbers @xmath25 , @xmath26 , and @xmath27 with the heavy meson . the color - octet ( co ) mechanism , _",
    "i.e. _ , the appearance of co states , with @xmath30 , is a distinctive feature of nrqcd factorization .",
    "two decades after the introduction of nrqcd factorization @xcite , all the relevant observables of prompt @xmath0 production are available at nlo in @xmath16 . in particular , these include yield @xcite and polarization @xcite in photoproduction , yield @xcite and polarization @xcite in hadroproduction , and observables in other production modes @xcite . since the ldmes of the @xmath31 meson are related to those of the @xmath0 meson via heavy - quark spin symmetry , the @xmath31 yield @xcite must be included in this list , too .",
    "the @xmath0 ldmes determined at nlo in nrqcd via a global fit to measurements of the unpolarized @xmath0 yields in photoproduction , hadroproduction , and other production modes @xcite lead to predictions of @xmath0 polarization in hadroproduction @xcite that are incompatible with measurements at the tevatron @xcite and the lhc @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", @xmath0 ldmes determined only from hadroproduction data @xcite are incompatible with data from photoproduction and other production modes @xcite .",
    "in other words , the long - standing @xmath0 polarization crisis of nrqcd , which had already been observed at lo @xcite , is substantiated at nlo in @xmath16 .",
    "this crisis has recently been aggravated by the observation @xcite that all the up - to - date @xmath0 ldme sets @xcite lead to nlo nrqcd predictions for the @xmath31 yield in hadroproduction that significantly overshoot the recent lhcb measurement @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , attempts @xcite to reconcile the measured @xmath31 and @xmath0 yields of hadroproduction by resorting to pre - lhc ldmes @xcite fail to describe the @xmath0 polarization measured at the tevatron @xcite and the lhc @xcite in the regime of large @xmath7 values and central rapidities @xmath32 .",
    "the analysis of ref .",
    "@xcite also misses its goal of achieving a coherent description of the @xmath0 and @xmath31 yields and the @xmath0 polarization in prompt hadroproduction .",
    "obviously , nrqcd factorization presently faces severe challenges with regard to the predicted universality of the ldmes at nlo in @xmath16 .    to resolve the @xmath0 polarization puzzle and to clarify the universality problem of the nrqcd ldmes",
    ", we systematically calculated , in our previous work @xcite , the relativistic corrections , of relative order @xmath20 , to the unpolarized @xmath0 yields in photoproduction and hadroproduction by including both the direct and feed - down contributions .",
    "we found that the @xmath20 corrections are appreciable , except for the cs @xmath1}$ ] channel of hadroproduction , and that their line shapes greatly differ between photoproduction and hadroproduction , which may offer a chance to improve the goodness of the state - of - the - art determinations of the ldmes . in this paper , we take the next logical step by calculating the @xmath20 corrections to the @xmath0 polarization observables in photoproduction and hadroproduction .",
    "all these @xmath20 corrections must be included on top of the respective @xmath19 corrections @xcite to render the nlo predictions complete .",
    "we organize the remainder of this paper as follows . in sec .",
