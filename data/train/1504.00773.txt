    "photons and neutrinos are the lightest particles in the standard model ( sm ) and give the radiation energy density at late times in the early universe .",
    "the sm neutrino species contributes three degrees of freedom because there are exactly three neutrino mass eigenstates @xmath2 in combinations of the three flavor eigenstates @xmath3 of the weak interaction .",
    "the weak interactions that keep neutrinos in thermal contact with the electromagnetic plasma become ineffective around a second after the big bang .",
    "neutrinos decouple at a temperature on the order of @xmath4 mev before @xmath5 pairs annihilate and , thus , do not share in the entropy transfer from @xmath5 pairs .",
    "this causes the neutrino temperature to be less than the photon temperature later .",
    "however , neutrino decoupling was not quite complete when @xmath6 annihilation began , so some of the energy and the entropy of photons could transfer to neutrinos .",
    "if the dark radiation density is parameterized in terms of the number of effective neutrino species @xmath1 with the canonical neutrino - to - photon temperature ratio , @xmath1 increases to slightly more than the three neutrino species , leading to @xmath7 @xcite . because the number of effective neutrino species @xmath1 is precisely predicted in the sm , this can give a robust constraint to any nonstandard physics .",
    "for example , new relativistic particles , such as the light sterile neutrino @xcite or the goldstone boson @xcite which has a decoupling temperature less than 100 mev , arise in many extensions of the sm , and their existence will contribute to the dark radiation energy density .",
    "this scenario is , however , strongly excluded at over the @xmath8 level in the latest planck analysis @xcite unless photons or electrons ( positrons ) are heated at a later time @xcite .    according to a recent analysis of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) temperature anisotropy by the planck satellite @xcite",
    ", @xmath1 was found to be @xmath9 @xmath10 , consistent with the sm prediction .",
    "we should recognize that the hubble constant @xmath11 inferred by planck is in tension at about @xmath12 with the direct measurement of @xmath13 kms@xmath14mpc@xmath14 by the hst @xcite : larger values of the hubble constant prefer larger values of @xmath1 .",
    "@xmath1 was not strongly excluded to about the @xmath15 upper limit in the planck analysis . additionally , @xmath1 can be inferred from big bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) considerations @xcite at times earlier than recombination because the theoretical expectations for the primordial abundances of light elements depend on @xmath1 .",
    "recently , two groups announced different results for @xmath1 determined from an analysis of @xmath16he abundance measurements in combination with the d abundance @xcite .",
    "one group @xcite obtained a result consistent with the planck observation , but the other @xcite found a larger value of @xmath17 .",
    "this probe does not have the same resolving power as the planck satellite .",
    "we will use planck results to constrain the dark radiation in this work .",
    "recently , weakly interacting massive particles ( wimps ) with sub - gev masses @xcite , referred to as light dark matter ( dm ) , have received some attention because the existence of wimps with mass less than 20 mev can modify the early universe energy s and entropy densities .",
    "if dm particles couple to the sm particles ( neutrinos , or photons and @xmath18 pairs ) and are sufficiently light ( @xmath0 mev ) to annihilate after neutrino decoupling , the primordial plasma will be heated by dm annihilation .",
    "this will affect the neutrino - to - photon temperature ratio and so might be able to explain possible differences of @xmath1 from the sm prediction or to avoid strong experimental constraints on the existence of additional radiation particles .",
    "this scenario was studied in the equilibrium version for neutrino heating @xcite and photon heating @xcite .",
    "the equilibrium version is , however , a rough approximation because dm particles are nonrelativistic at freeze - out .",
    "if the dm particles are relativistic at dm decoupling , the equilibrium method must be a good approximation because they will decouple at equilibrium concentrations . a more accurate description of the freeze - out process should be considered when dm particles are nonrelativistic at freeze - out . here",
    ", the boltzmann equation is applied to the time - evolution of the dm number in a spatially homogeneous and isotropic universe .",
    "we treat an adiabatic  expansion of the universe so that the total entropy stays constant and the second law of thermodynamics can be applied to the entropy ( temperature ) evolution of the produced relativistic particles .",
    "because the dm mass @xmath19 determines the dark radiation energy , it will be the parameter that we will constrain .",
    "we start to study the dm number evolution for an expanding universe and dark radiation @xmath20 in the equilibrium approximation .",
    "then , we study the out - of - equilibrium light - particle production , its entropy ( temperature ) evolution and its effect on the dark radiation .",
    "the possibility of the existence of new light species ( equivalent neutrinos ) is also investigated .",
    "the dark radiation energy density of the universe @xmath21 is parameterized in terms of the energy density of photons @xmath22 and the effective number of neutrinos @xmath1 with the neutrino - to - photon temperature ratio of the sm given by@xmath23 the factor @xmath24 is due to the effect of fermi - dirac statistics on the energy density .",
    "the exact formula for @xmath1 depends on the scenario ( model ) . because the temperature will change in our scenario ,",
    "@xmath1 can be expressed by@xmath25 we have assumed that dm particles are nonrelativistic at the time we consider , for example , the time of dm freeze - out or recombination .",
    "the bbn imposes limits on @xmath1 at photon temperatures around @xmath26 mev , and any additional dark radiation particle is unfavorable from bbn considerations though a small possibility still exists . if the dm particle is relativistic in the bbn era , it becomes a dark radiation particle .",
    "we investigate the effects of dm annihilation on @xmath1 for the dm mass range of @xmath27 mev .",
    "the ratio of the neutrino temperature to the photon temperature can be determined by entropy conservation because the total entropy stays constant in an adiabatic expansion of the universe .",
    "after neutrino decoupling , the primeval plasma will consist of two decoupled components , the electromagnetic component and three neutrino ones .",
    "the entropies of the neutrino and the electromagnetic plasmas are separately conserved , and this must serve as an efficient tool for the study of dark radiation here .",
    "two independent thermal baths exist after neutrino decoupling , and we will consider the dm interaction ( annihilation ) in each thermal bath . here , the dm particle always interacts with the plasma in thermal bath @xmath28 , and thermal bath @xmath29 is not relevant to the dm interaction , @xmath30 , @xmath31 or @xmath32 , but @xmath33 .",
    "dm particles are in thermal contact with the rest of the cosmic plasma at high temperatures , but they will experience the freeze - out at a critical temperature . in this case , we should consider the boltzmann equation for the evolution of dm number . because the dm interacts with one of the plasmas , we express the comoving number density about the temperature of the plasma in thermal bath @xmath29 .",
    "this notation is very useful because one plasma can always be in the thermal equilibrium .",
    "if the dm interacts with the plasma in thermal bath @xmath28 , the evolution equation for the comoving number density @xmath34 @xmath35 with respect to the inverse temperature @xmath36 @xmath37 of the other thermal bath reads @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the hubble parameter , @xmath40 is the entropy density in thermal bath @xmath29 and @xmath41 @xmath42 is the equilibrium number density .",
    "this equation is not meaningful when @xmath43 .",
    "this becomes the usual fluid equation in thermal equilibrium .",
    "we parameterize the annihilation cross section as @xmath44 , in which @xmath45 for @xmath46-wave annihilation and @xmath47 for @xmath48-wave annihilation",
    ". the above equation can be reduced to@xmath49 where @xmath50 and @xmath51 are the effective relativistic degrees of freedom for the energy density and the entropy respectively , and @xmath52 is the planck mass .    unfortunately , eq . ( 4 ) has no analytic solution .",
    "1 shows the result of numerical solutions for @xmath46-wave annihilation into neutrinos ( left panel ) and @xmath48-wave annihilation into photons ( right panel ) . the dm residual annihilation into photons can distort the cmb spectrum @xcite",
    "this effect excludes dms with mass less than 10 gev for @xmath46-wave annihilation into photons .",
    "the effect is negligible for @xmath48-wave annihilation , which is velocity dependent , so this bound can be evaded . for dm annihilation into neutrinos",
    ", we assumed that the same numbers of neutrinos and antineutrinos of each type were produced .",
    "the number of effective relativistic degrees of freedom @xmath53 is not related to dm or its production .",
    "we could take the value on the sm base .",
    "the @xmath50 is taken as a constant @xmath54 on average .",
    "the curves were made with the proper values of @xmath55 in agreement with the current dm relic density @xmath56 for a dirac fermion , majorana fermion , complex scalar and real scalar with a dm mass of 10 mev .",
    "as we expected , the dm number track the equilibrium abundance at very high temperatures , @xmath57 . the solution to the boltzmann equation starts to deviate significantly from the equilibrium abundance at around @xmath58 , and the actual dm abundance @xmath34 is different from @xmath41 and @xmath59 for a considerable time .",
    "notice that the equilibrium number densities at high tenperatures ( early times ) are different for different particle species .",
    "because the current dm relic density is not relalted to the particle species , a large number of relativisitic particles will be produced for the species that has a large equilibrium number density at early times .",
    "this can be a means to distinguish the nature of the particle if other information about the dm , such as the dm mass , is given ( see figs . 2 and 3 ) .",
    "[ ptb ]    fig1.eps      dm particles are assumed to keep in thermal contact with one of plasmas after neutrino decoupling and to decouple suddenly at some point .",
    "the dm and its products can be expressed by fermi - dirac or bose - einstein statistics in this case .",
    "there can be different types of particles in thermal bath @xmath28 , so we will use the entropy density @xmath60 to define the number of effective relativistic degrees of freedom is placed on top of the symbol of the number of the effective relativistic degrees of freedom to indicate dm inclusion .",

    "we set the chemical potentials to zero .",
    "the number of effective relativistic degrees of freedom is given by @xmath71 because the entropy in each thermal bath is conserved after neutrino decoupling , the temperature @xmath72 @xmath73 varies as @xmath74 @xmath75 , where @xmath76 is the scale factor .",
    "we can find the temperature ratio at the dm decoupling time if we know the temperature ratio at a certain time ( the time of neutrino decoupling ) .",

    "this formula can be approximated to the temperature ratio at late times ; @xmath30 , at the times when the temperatures @xmath81 are less than the decoupling temperatures .",

    "we remove the mark @xmath61 .",
