    "looking for new solutions of yang - baxter equation is an interesting and important problem in exactly solvable statistical models .",
    "some time ago set of new solutions of yang - baxter equations were obtained @xcite by `` baxterization '' of multicolored generalization of temperley - lieb ( tl ) algebras - fuss - catalan algebras  discovered by bisch and jones @xcite .",
    "these solutions are really new and are not equivalent to a fusion of known models . in @xcite these solutions were formulated in terms of generators of this new algebra , and in principle the boltzmann weights may be interpreted both as a vertex model , or as an interaction round the face ( irf ) models defined on a tensor product of admissibility graphs corresponding to different colors of the tl algebra .",
    "physical interpretation of these new integrable models may be different .",
    "in addition to construction of new integrable vertex and irf models , an obvious possible realization of these new solutions is multicolored generalization of dense loop models @xcite , polymers and other subjects of exactly solvable statistical models ( for a review see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "another new integrable model of the same class was obtained as integrable solution for lorentz lattice gases @xcite,@xcite and dimerised coupled spin-@xmath0 chain @xcite .    in spite of traditional form of the r - matrix",
    ", it turns out that the usual algebraic bethe ansatz solution , at least in its naive and straightforward version , reveals some technical problems .",
    "one of the possible reasons for that might be a non trivial structure of pseudo vacuum , which is hard to guess in a way effective for realization of algebraic bethe ansatz program .",
    "the alternative method for investigation of physical properties of integrable models , such as ground state energy , its free energy , spectrum and correlation functions is the method of inversion relations .",
    "it does nt require explicit form of ba equations or transfer matrix eigenvalues , valid in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "it was taken up by baxter ( see , e.g. @xcite,@xcite ) and further developed by others ( see e.g. @xcite,@xcite ) .",
    "it exploits functional inversion relations for the transfer matrix in the ground state , and transfer matrix analytical properties , in order to calculate ground state energy and low lying excitations spectrum @xcite .",
    "assumptions on the transfer matrix eigenvalue analytical properties usually should be confirmed numerically .",
    "the advantage of this method is that it does nt require knowledge of bethe ansatz equations and eigenvalues of transfer matrix explicitly , but gives a possibility to find basic physical quantities of the model quite easily .",
    "plan of the paper is the following .",
    "we start sect.2 with description of the boltzmann weights of the models in terms of multicolored tl generators and their algebraic relations .",
    "we analyze possible physical regimes , where boltzmann weights are real and positive , and discuss possible vertex and irf interpretation of the models .",
    "some interesting factorization property of admissibility graph for irf models is pointed out .",
    "in sect.3 we derive functional inversion relations for the transfer matrices of two colored vertex model and for the partition function of two colored irf model .",
    "we solve them analytically as a product of analytical non zero function , and a function with poles or zeros .",
    "excited states are discussed and found to lead to a mass gap . in sect.4 generalization of inversion relations for multicolored models",
    "is discussed .",
    "we conclude by sect.5 with a discussion of the obtained results .",
    "in this section we recall the results of @xcite and demonstrate them for few examples of two , three and four colored models . for details of fuss - catalan algebras and their representations",
    "we refer a reader to bj and @xcite .",
    "we also discuss vertex and irf representations of baxterized fuss - catalan models and find their possible physical regimes",
    ".      new class of tl like algebras found by bisch and jones @xcite can be considered as a kind of quotient of tensor product of few tl algebras .",
    "generators of these algebras may be formulated in terms of tl generators defined on a lattice .",
    "the relations on generators depend on the parity of the site @xmath1 where the operator acts .",
    "the main commutation relations bj are the following.@xmath2where@xmath3here @xmath4 is the number of colors is , and in the standard strings pictorial interpretation of the operators @xmath5 weight @xmath6 is attached to each loop of color @xmath7 .",
    "locality of operators @xmath8 expressed as @xmath9when @xmath10 , or when @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "non commuting operators satisfy cubic relations@xmath13these are basic relations of the fuss - catalan algebra @xmath14 which describes coils of @xmath15 strings of @xmath4 colors .",
    "boundary conditions are fixed by requirement that both on the top and on the bottom strings end up by the same pattern @xmath16 .",
    "pictorial interpretation of the commutation relations written above one can find in @xcite .",
    "lets note that not all of the relations written above are independent ( for details see @xcite,@xcite ) .",
    "there are some consequences of these relations necessary , in particular , if one wishes to check validity of yang - baxter equations for the baxterization solutions , but we will not stop on these technical details here .    in @xcite baxterization of this algebra was successfully done .",
    "namely , all possible solutions of the yang - baxter equation @xmath17were found in the form @xmath18satisfying @xmath19 in the class of rational polynomial functions @xmath20 .",
    "it was done by substitution of ( [ w ] ) into ( [ yb ] ) , which , using the fuss - catalan algebra , leads to a complicated system of functional equations on the coefficients @xmath20 .",
    "general solution of this system of functional equations was found to be : @xmath21where @xmath22 are defined in ( [ ro ] ) , @xmath23 , and @xmath24 and other parameters entering the last equations , are restricted and defined by the following set of relations : @xmath25 and either @xmath26 , or @xmath27 , and @xmath28for any @xmath29 . in @xcite the special solution with @xmath30 was called fundamental . with this set of @xmath31 one",
    "has @xmath32 .",
    "these equations were solved in the assumption that all @xmath33 s are positive .",
    "we will relax this condition and permit two possible branches of the square root when solving ( [ mu ] ) with respect to @xmath34 . for real @xmath34",
    "it means the option of some negative @xmath33 s wo nt be ignored .",
    "we introduce the set of signs of @xmath34 , @xmath35 such that @xmath36 .",
    "then we get the solutions in the following general form@xmath37note that an important artefact of the baxterization procedure in the case of the fuss - catalan algebras is a necessary additional requirement that all the parameters @xmath34 of different copies of tl subalgebras should be equal ( up to some signs ) . here and below we denote @xmath38 as @xmath33 - the only free parameter remaining after baxterization , which , we in principle permit to be negative .",
    "this possibility of negative @xmath33(s ) will extend variety of possible physical regimes of our statistical models .    in @xcite",
    "the solutions with @xmath39 were called fundamental .",
    "all others differ from it either by less powers of @xmath40 appearing in @xmath41 , or alternating signs of @xmath41 .",
    "both type of changes compared to the fundamental solution should respect the symmetries of parameters @xmath42 and ( [ alal ] ) .",
    "the fundamental solution can be written as @xmath43    all the solutions for boltzmann weights ( [ w ] ) we got have two important properties : unitarity@xmath44and crossing symmetry:@xmath45which becomes @xmath46for the fundamental models . here",
    "@xmath47 @xmath48 , the `` bar '' operation means @xmath49 .",
    "in pictorial representation `` bar '' means rotation of tl generators by 90 degrees , as in the crossing relation of boltzmann weights of a lattice models .",
    "these two symmetries ( u),([cr ] ) are very important and play crucial role in derivation of inversion relation . here and below we",
    "mainly stop on few representative examples of the plenty solutions described by ( [ eq]),([ek]),([f ] ) .",
    "we will analyze in details @xmath50 , considering possible regimes of the models .",
    "here we write down explicitly all the solutions found for @xmath50 .",
    "two color case has only fundamental solution@xmath51 in the case of three colors there are two possibilities@xmath52where the  case of upper signs @xmath53 corresponds to what we called the fundamental solution .",
    "there are more possibilities in the case of four colors .",
    "it is the minimal number of colors when what we called an excited solution ( some @xmath54 ) exists .",
    "two solutions are@xmath55the fundamental solution is @xmath56 and @xmath57 is an excited one .",
    "there are more four color excited solutions : @xmath58    if we now impose positivity of all boltzmann weights , we can find different regimes of the models .",
    "it is convenient to give names to the following regions on the plain @xmath59 : @xmath60we will use the following parameterization of spectral and crossing parameters in the regions @xmath61:@xmath62models `` @xmath63 '' and `` @xmath64 '' are physical ( have positive boltzmann weights ) in all the regimes @xmath61 .",
    "`` @xmath65 '' is physical in the regimes @xmath66 and @xmath67 , and `` @xmath68 ''  in the regimes @xmath69 .",
    "`` @xmath70 '' has all boltzmann weights positive only in the regime @xmath66 , whereas models `` @xmath71 '' and `` @xmath72 '' are never physical in the sense of all boltzmann weights positivity .    we see a rich spectrum of possibilities for different regions of parameters defining a positive boltzmann weights . only detailed investigation of the models",
    "can answer on the question what is the phase structure of the models and its relation to the regimes .",
    "in principle it would be plausible to proceed with exact solution of these new integrable lattice models directly in terms of fuss - catalan generators .",
    "such possibility is shortly discussed in the sect.5 . here and below we formulate integrable lattice models in terms of more concrete representations of the fuss - catalan algebra . in this context",
    "the useful fact @xcite is that the fuss - catalan algebra ( [ u1]),([u2]),([u3 ] ) is a subalgebra of tensor product of few copies of tl algebras with different parameters @xmath73 , and generators @xmath74 may be expressed in terms of @xmath75 as@xmath76recall that one of the requirements of the baxterization procedure was the same value of @xmath77 for different @xmath78 .",
    "the most studied lattice models are vertex models and interaction round the face ( irf ) models . in the first case the tl operator @xmath74 acts on linear spaces attached to four links of square lattice connected to each site . using a basis @xmath79 of the linear space the vertex boltzmann weights @xmath80",
    "is defined as @xmath81the fundamental representation for the usual tl generator @xmath82 is known to be defined on a tensor product of two dimensional linear spaces in a matrix form:@xmath83where @xmath84  is related to the tl algebra parameter @xmath85 . in view of ( [ utp ] ) it is natural to define representation for the multicolored generator @xmath74 as the tensor product of matrices ( [ tlv ] ) ( with , in principle , different parameters @xmath84 ) and identity matrices , as in ( utp ) .",
    "the linear spaces living on the links of the lattice are of dimension @xmath86 , where @xmath4 is the number of colors .",
    "another representation of algebraically formulated lattice model boltzmann weights @xmath87 is an irf representation . in this case",
    "some ( integer ) numbers are living at each site of the square lattice with a constraint that on two admissible ( connected by a link ) sites may appear only numbers permitted by some fixed admissibility graph .",
    "then the representation is given ( see e.g. @xcite ) on an elementary face of the lattice with site values @xmath88 in the anti clockwise direction @xmath89where @xmath90 are components of the eigenvector of the admissibility matrix with the largest eigenvalue equal to the tl parameter @xmath33 .",
    "@xmath91 with @xmath7-coxeter number for models with @xmath92-like admissibility graphs , and @xmath93 for the extended @xmath94 admissibility graphs .",
    "further construction of representation of @xmath74 generators goes by tensoring ( [ tlf ] ) according to ( [ utp ] ) .",
    "this tensor product of elementary irf representations of tl operators will be defined on a tensor product admissibility graph . as we said above",
    ", not all admissibility graphs may participate in this tensor product , since their matrix eigenvalues are not arbitrary , but restricted by condition ( [ alal ] ) .",
    "possible partners among @xmath92 models which can be tensored , were classified in @xcite .",
    "actually there is even more freedom  one can make a tensor product of vertex and irf models , consistently fitting their parameters @xmath33 .",
    "but in what follows we will concentrate on two simplest examples  two color vertex model and two color @xmath95 irf models .",
    "the simplest possibility for vertex realization is the model @xmath96``@xmath63 '' . in",
    "has 32 non zero boltzmann weights and list of them one can find in @xcite .",
    "looking at this list , one can see that the model is not of ice type  there is no a natural `` charge '' conservation in each vertex .",
    "linear space living on each of four edges of a vertex is four dimensional , such that r - matrix is @xmath97 .",
    "an interesting observation is that it is possible to attach `` charge '' to these four spaces in a way preserving `` charge '' conservation , but on a cost of charge degeneracy of the spaces .",
    "for instance , the attachment : space @xmath98 @xmath99 charge @xmath98 , space @xmath100 @xmath101 charge @xmath100 , space @xmath63 @xmath99 charge @xmath100 , space @xmath102 @xmath101 charge @xmath102  leads to `` charge '' conservation in each non zero vertex .",
    "we formulate the model in the language of spin chain models , and consider the boltzmann weights @xmath80 as an l - operator .",

    "each of two quartets @xmath88 and @xmath121 are any permitted by @xmath122 admissibility graph diagram independently , and @xmath123 .",
    "one can explicitly check that these boltzmann weights satisfy the following unitarity and crossing relations@xmath124@xmath125    an interesting and important feature of the boltzmann weights ( [ irf ] ) is their admissibility graph decomposition property .",
    "one can check that admissibility rules coming from ( [ irf ] ) lead to two independently existing subsets of site variables , each with its own admissibility graph .",
    "the form of these two graphs depends on oddness of @xmath120 ( see fig.1a , fig.1b ) .",

    "the auxiliary space of tm contains a sum over thermodynamically many ( @xmath128 ) variables @xmath129 in ( [ tv ] ) , whereas the irf tm does not contain any auxiliary space .",
    "let us look in more details at the two color @xmath130 graph irf model .",
    "this model , in a sense , may be called @xmath131``two color '' ising model , since , as it is well known ( see e.g. @xcite ) , @xmath131 graph irf model is equivalent to the ising model .",
    "recall that @xmath131 admissibility rule requires that the height value is fixed and equal to 2 ( the value of the middle site of @xmath131 graph ) on the even sublattice of two dimensional square lattice , whereas the heights on the odd sublattice take the values 1 and 3 , forming an ising model .",
    "the situation is different in the two color case and the model seems to be more complicated then ising model . as one can see by explicit analysis of non zero boltzmann weights for the case @xmath132 , the rsos model splits into two subsets of variables living on the sites of a face . if one denotes ( @xmath133 ) the pairs of two numbers at the sites of a face as@xmath134the decomposition of the admissibility graph into two ones looks like it is shown on the fig.2 .",

    "again there are two separate submodels .",
    "note that the relations ( [ irfcu ] ) are valid for each of two submodels of @xmath139 admissibility graph decomposition .",

    "unfortunately the obstructions we met on this way did nt allow us to proceed in this direction , and algebraic bethe ansatz for these models remains an open problem .",
    "but some information about ground state energy and free energy , spectrum of low lying excitations , and even about some correlation functions , can be extracted using a method known for a long time @xcite , which does nt require a knowledge of explicit form ba equations and transfer matrix eigenvalues .",
    "it is a method of inversion functional relations on the transfer matrix eigenvalues , which was successfully applied to few integrable lattice models @xcite",
    ". it would be interesting to develop a universal algebraic method of derivation of inversion relations in terms of multicolored tl algebra generators , as it was partly done in @xcite for usual tl algebra models , but in what follows we are going to consider the inversion relation in vertex and irf representations of multicolored tl algebra , which we discussed in the previous section .",

    "it leads to the following functional relation for eigenvalues of transfer matrix in the thermodynamic limit @xmath154 , when the terms @xmath155 can be neglected @xmath156    another relation is the unitarity relation .",

    "the analog of ( sys1 ) for vertex model in a parameterization ( [ co4]),([co5 ] ) of the regimes @xmath225 looks like@xmath226where in the regime @xmath221 @xmath227 , and in the regime @xmath224 @xmath228 . equation ( [ sys2 ] ) remains as it is .",
    "it means the solution for @xmath229 in this case is given by @xmath230@xmath171 is given by the same solution ( [ zp ] ) .",
    "with the assumption of anz condition for @xmath231 it leads to the following ground state energies of the two color vertex model in the regimes @xmath221 and @xmath224 : @xmath232 the analysis of low lying excitations remains the same , giving the same finite energy gap ( [ gap ] ) .    in the same way one can modify the solutions for partition function @xmath209 of two color irf models in regimes @xmath221 and @xmath224 . with an anz hypothesis , it is given by the same expression ( [ so ] ) with the same property @xmath210 .",
    "a natural conjecture is that all what was done in the previous section for two colored  models , can be generalized for what was called above fundamental models with any number of colors in the regime analogous to regime @xmath66 .",
    "lets point out that both three and four colored models have only regimes @xmath66 and @xmath67 as regimes with all boltzmann weights positive . as we said , @xmath148 only in the regime @xmath66 , which was crucial for derivation of inversion relation .",
    "instead of ( [ crl ] ) we have @xmath233 ^{t_{2}}% \\widetilde{m}^{(1)}\\]]with some matrix @xmath234 acting in the first space .",
    "together with ( [ ul ] ) it gives the following inversion relations@xmath235 ^{n}id+o(e^{-n } ) \\\\",
    "t(x)t(1/x ) & = & id\\end{aligned}\\]]as we see , they differ from ( [ inv3 ] ) is minimal way  by a prefactor . the same procedure as previously gives @xmath236with the same expression ( [ zp ] ) for @xmath171 .",
    "it leads to integer shift of the ground state energy in @xmath237 , compared to ( [ e0 ] ) , provided still @xmath238 ( anz hypothesis ) .",
    "this of course should be checked numerically .",
    "looking at the other models which have some physical regimes , one can believe that the general form of inversion relations both for fundamental models with some negative signs and for excited models with or without negative signs , is just @xmath239 ^{n}id+o(e^{-n } ) \\\\",
    "t(x)t(1/x ) & = & id\\end{aligned}\\]]form of solution of these equations depends on regime .",
    "we see that different models have the same set of functional inversion relations , and sometimes even the same set of regimes .",
    "one can believe that if there is a difference in ground state or low lying excited states between these models , then it is expressed in the amount and location of poles and zeros of function @xmath171 .",
    "an information about these poles and zeros may come from numerics .",
    "in this paper we made an attempt to analyze vertex and irf multicolored lattice models .",
    "we saw an interesting structure of admissibility graph for irf models .",
    "being unable to solve the models by algebraic bethe ansatz , we tried to analyze them using the inversion relations .",
    "the main result of this attempt - all the models have a mass gap in the considered regime .",
    "another evidence for absence of conformal points in this regime we saw formally trying to construct new link invariants , following a standard procedure of extracting a braid group representation from the boltzmann weights either in vertex or in irf form ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the objection we met in this way is that it is impossible to get a well defined braid group representation taking a limit @xmath240 , or some other one , for the two color boltzmann weights @xmath241 .",
    "also the formal sufficient condition for construction of link invariants from @xmath241 one can find in @xcite is not satisfied .",
    "but one can not reject a possibility of gapless behavior for the models we considered in other regimes , as it was pointed out in @xcite for dimerised coupled spin chain .",
    "let us stress an almost unrestricted amount of possibilities in construction of new integrable multicolored tl models demonstrated above .",
    "certainly these zoo of new models deserves a classification which , as far as we know , is missing for today .    an interesting possible alternative is coordinate bethe ansatz formulated in terms of the fuss - catalan algebra itself .",
    "such kind of bethe ansatz formulation , purely in terms of usual tl algebra generators for the xxz model , was applied in @xcite . the basis for wave function representation",
    "was chosen as a basis of specially defined two sided ideals of words of tl generators .",
    "it would be interesting to apply such formulation to the multicolored tl lattice models .",
    "this paper is only a first touch to these new integrable models .",
    "development  and applications of known methods of integrable models , such as algebraical bethe ansatz , transfer matrix functional relations leading to a ( system of ) integral equations , a role of q - operator in these models , and so on  are open and interesting problems .",
