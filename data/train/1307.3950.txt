    "water is known to show a wide variety of solid phases , and in fact , sixteen different crystalline ice phases have been identified so far.@xcite the determination of their crystal structures and stability range in the pressure - temperature phase diagram has been a matter of research for several decades . however , despite the large amount of experimental and theoretical work on the solid phases of water , some of their properties still lack a complete understanding .",
    "this is mainly due to their peculiar structure , where hydrogen bonds between contiguous molecules give rise to properties somewhat different than those of most known liquids and solids.@xcite    in all ice phases ( with the exception of ice x ) , water molecules appear as well defined entities forming a network connected by h - bonds . in this network each water molecule is surrounded by four others in a more or less distorted tetrahedral coordination .",
    "the orientation of each molecule with respect to its four nearest neighbors fulfills the so - called bernal - fowler ice rules .",
    "these rules state that each h@xmath1o molecule is oriented in such a way that its two protons point toward adjacent oxygen atoms and that there must be exactly one proton between two contiguous oxygen atoms.@xcite in the following we will refer to these rules simply as `` ice rules . ''",
    "the presence of orientational disorder in the water molecules is a property of several ice phases .",
    "while the oxygen atoms show a full occupancy ( @xmath2 ) of their crystallographic positions , the hydrogen atoms may display a disordered spatial distribution as indicated by a fractional occupancy of their lattice sites .",
    "thus , ice ih , the stable phase of solid water under normal conditions , presents full proton disorder compatible with the ice rules , i.e. , occupancies of h - sites of @xmath3 . however , other phases such as ice ii are h - ordered , while others as ice iii are characterized by a partial proton ordering , i.e. , some fractional occupancies of h - sites are different from 0.5 .",
    "configurational disorder of protons in ice was first studied by pauling,@xcite who estimated its contribution to the entropy of a crystal of @xmath4 molecules to be @xmath5 .",
    "this combinatorial estimate turned out to be in good agreement with the `` residual '' entropy derived from the experimental heat capacity of ice ih,@xcite although the calculation did not take into account the actual structure of ice ih .",
    "nagle@xcite calculated later the residual entropy of hexagonal ice ih and cubic ice ic by a series method , and found in both cases very similar values , which turned out to be close to but slightly higher than the pauling s estimate .",
    "more recently , berg _",
    "et al._@xcite have used multicanonical simulations to calculate the configurational entropy of ice ih , assuming a disordered proton distribution compatible with the ice rules . moreover , several authors have calculated the configurational entropy of partially ordered ice phases,@xcite a question that will not be addressed here .",
    "ice - type models are important not only for condensed phases of water , but also for other kinds of materials showing atomic disorder,@xcite as well as in the statistical mechanics of lattice models.@xcite although exact analytical solutions for the ice model in the actual three - dimensional ice structures are not known at present , an exact solution was found by lieb for the two - dimensional square lattice.@xcite in this case , the configurational entropy results to be @xmath6 , with @xmath7 , somewhat higher than the pauling value @xmath8 .    in this paper , we present a simple , but `` formally exact '' method , to obtain the configurational entropy of h - disordered ice structures . it is based on a thermodynamic integration from high to low temperatures , for an ice model which reproduces the ice rules at low temperatures .",
    "to calculate the configurational entropy of the different ice structures , we consider a simple model .",
    "the only requirement for this model is that it has to reproduce the ice rules at low temperature .",
    "thus , irrespective of its simplicity , it can give the actual entropy if an adequate thermodynamic integration is carried out .",
    "for concreteness , we summarize the ice rules:@xcite    \\(1 ) there is one hydrogen atom between each pair of neighboring oxygen atoms , forming a hydrogen bond .",
    "\\(2 ) each oxygen atom is surrounded by four h atoms , two of them covalently bonded and two other h - bonded to it .    our model is defined as follows .",
    "we consider an ice structure as defined by the positions of the oxygen atoms , so that each o atom has four nearest o atoms .",
    "this defines a network , where the nodes are the o sites , and the links are h - bonds between nearest neighbors .",
    "the network coordination is four , which gives a total of @xmath9 links , @xmath4 being the number of nodes .",
    "we assume that on each link there is one ( and only one ) h atom , which can move between two positions on the link ( close to one oxygen or close to the other ) .",
    "is the number of h atoms close to the central oxygen , @xmath10 indicates its multiplicity , and @xmath11 refers to its energy in the model described in the text .",
    ", width=302 ]    given a configuration of h atoms on an ice network , the energy @xmath12 is defined as : @xmath13 where the sum runs over the @xmath4 nodes in the network , and @xmath14 is the number of hydrogen atoms covalently bonded to the oxygen on site @xmath15 , which can take the values 0 , 1 , 2 , 3 , or 4 . the energy",
    "associated to site @xmath15 is then @xmath16 ( see fig .  1 ) ,",
    "having a minimum for @xmath17 , which imposes the fulfillment of the ice rules at low temperature .",
    "in this way , all hydrogen configurations compatible with the ice rules on a given structure are equally probable in the low - temperature limit , i.e. , it is implicit in the model that all configurations obeying the ice rules have the same energy .",
    "we note that this simple model , although it is a convenient tool for our present purposes , does not represent any realistic interatomic interaction , in the sense that we are not dealing with a real ordering process , but with a numerical approach to `` count '' h - disordered configurations of ice .",
    "since the entropy is a state function , one can obtain the number of configurations compatible with the ice rules by a kind of thermodynamic integration from a reference state ( @xmath18 ) for which the h configuration is random ( does not respect the ice rules ) , to a state in which these rules are strictly fulfilled ( @xmath19 ) .",
    "we note that in our calculations we use reduced variables , so that all quantities such as the energy @xmath12 and the temperature @xmath20 are dimensionless .",
    "the entropy per site @xmath21 that we calculate is therefore related with the physical configurational entropy @xmath22 as @xmath23 .",
    "the heat capacity per site , @xmath24 has been obtained from the energy fluctuations at temperature @xmath20 , by using the expression@xcite @xmath25 where @xmath26 .",
    "the configurational entropy per site can be obtained from the heat capacity by thermodynamic integration as @xmath27 in our case , the entropy per site for @xmath18 is given by @xmath28 where @xmath29 in the exponent indicates the number of links in the network under consideration ( note that @xmath30 is the total number of possible configurations in our model , since each of the @xmath29 links admits two different positions for an h atom ) .    a practical problem with eq .",
    "( [ entrop1 ] ) in a thermodynamic integration is that the limit @xmath18 can not be reached , and any cutoff in the temperature , even if this is taken at large @xmath20 , can introduce systematic errors in the calculated entropies . to overcome this problem we use the fact that an analytical model can approximate very well the high - temperature thermodynamic variables , with an error smaller than the error bars associated to the simulation procedure .",
    "such an analytical model can be obtained by considering the nodes as `` independent '' , as in pauling s original calculation for a hypothetical network including no loops . in this case , the partition function is given by @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the one - site partition function : @xmath33 ( as derived from the boltzmann factors for 16 possible configurations of four hydrogen atoms ; see fig .",
    "1 ) and the term @xmath34 in the denominator appears to avoid counting links with zero or two h atoms . in fact , the high - temperature limit of @xmath35 in eq .  ( [ zz ] ) is @xmath36 , which is the number of configurations compatible with the condition of having an h atom per link .",
    "the energy per site is @xmath37    for the actual ice structures , the corresponding oxygen networks contain loops , which means that the factorization in the partition function in eq .",
    "( [ zz ] ) is not possible .",
    "however , at high temperatures thermodynamic variables for the real structures converge to those of the independent - site model . at high temperature ,",
    "@xmath38 in eq .",
    "( [ eindep ] ) can be expanded in powers of @xmath39 so that @xmath40 and using eqs .",
    "( [ cvt ] ) and ( [ entrop1 ] ) we find for the entropy @xmath41 keeping terms for @xmath42 up to @xmath43 , we find @xmath44 = 1.38414 .",
    "we have checked that at temperatures @xmath45 , both the energy and heat capacity derived from this model coincide ( within error bars ) with those derived from our monte carlo simulations for the actual networks studied here .",
    "thus , to obtain the configurational entropy for the ice structures , our thermodynamic integration in fact begins at @xmath46 , a temperature at which the entropy of the actual network is taken as that of the analytical ( no loops ) model .",
    "we note that at lower temperatures ( @xmath47 ) , the simulations for the considered networks yield energy values different from those derived from the `` independent - node '' model in eqs .",
    "( [ zz ] ) and ( [ z68 ] ) , which is in fact the reason why we find for these networks entropy values different from the pauling result .    with this simple scheme for the energy ,",
    "we have carried out monte carlo simulations on ice networks of different sizes .",
    "the largest networks employed here included 3600 , 2880 , and 3430 sites for the square lattice , ice ih , and ice vi , respectively .",
    "periodic boundary conditions were assumed .",
    "sampling of the configuration space was carried out by the metropolis update algorithm.@xcite for each network we considered 360 temperatures in the interval between @xmath20 = 10 and @xmath20 = 1 , and 200 temperatures in the range from @xmath20 = 1 to @xmath20 = 0.01 .",
    "for each considered temperature , the simulation started from the last hydrogen configuration in the previous temperature , and then we carried out @xmath48 monte carlo steps for system equilibration , followed by @xmath49 steps for averaging of thermodynamic variables .",
    "each monte carlo step consisted of an update of @xmath29 ( the number of h - bonds ) hydrogen positions successively and randomly selected .",
    "finite - size scaling was then employed to obtain the configurational entropy per site @xmath0 corresponding to the thermodynamic limit ( extrapolation to infinite size ) .    using a simple energy model as that employed here , an alternative procedure to calculate the configurational entropy can consist in obtaining directly the density of states as a function of the energy , as described elsewhere for order / disorder problems in condensed matter.@xcite then , in our case the entropy could be obtained from the number of states with zero energy , i.e.",
    ", compatible with the ice rules .",
    "we have applied the method described above to calculate the configurational entropy of the ice model in three different networks .",
    "first , we check the precision of the method for the two - dimensional square lattice , for which an exact analytical solution is known .",
    "then , we calculate @xmath0 for the familiar ice ih , and compare our results with those obtained in earlier work . finally , we present results for the configurational entropy of ice vi , for which one expects @xmath0 to be appreciably different from ice ih , due to the presence of four - membered rings of water molecules in its structure .    for each considered network",
    ", we have obtained the configurational entropy @xmath50 in the limit @xmath19 for several system sizes @xmath4 , as described in sect .",
    "ii . in fig .  2 we present @xmath50 for the ice model on the two - dimensional square lattice .",
    "open symbols represent the configurational entropy derived from our thermodynamic integration , as a function of the inverse system size .",
    "we find that @xmath50 decreases for increasing system size @xmath4 , and in fact there is a linear dependence of @xmath50 on @xmath51 for @xmath52 , in the form @xmath53 where @xmath54 is a network - dependent parameter . for smaller system sizes ( not shown in the figure ) ,",
    "@xmath50 deviates slightly from the linear behavior , becoming smaller than the value predicted from a linear fit for @xmath55 sites .",
    "extrapolation of the linear fit for @xmath56 gives a value @xmath0 = 0.43153(3 ) , in good agreement with the exact solution for the square lattice found by lieb@xcite by the transfer - matrix method : @xmath57 .",
    "information on the least - square fit carried out here is given in table  i.    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     an argument why the entropy per site should decrease for increasing size is the following .",
    "let us call @xmath58 the number of configurations compatible with the ice rules for size @xmath4 .",
    "for two independent cells of size @xmath4 the number of possible configurations would be @xmath59 .",
    "then , putting both cells together to form a larger cell of size @xmath29 , we have @xmath60 , because one has to discard configurations that do not `` match '' correctly in the border between both @xmath4-size cells .",
    "the decrease of @xmath50 for increasing @xmath4 can thus be viewed as an effect of the boundary conditions . assuming that @xmath50 behaves regularly as a function of @xmath51 in the thermodynamic limit ( @xmath56 )",
    ", one expects for large @xmath4 a dependence of the form @xmath61 .",
    "this is in fact what we find from our simulations , with the parameter @xmath62 so small that the linear dependence of @xmath50 on @xmath51 is clearly consistent with the results at least for @xmath55 .",
    "for the three - dimensional structure of ice ih we also find a linear dependence of the configurational entropy on the inverse network size .",
    "this is shown in fig .  3 , where one observes that the slope ( parameter @xmath54 in eq .  ( [ sns ] ) ) is larger than in the case of the two - dimensional lattice .",
    "the entropy in the thermodynamic limit is lower for ice ih , as expected from earlier results for this ice structure.@xcite we find @xmath0 = 0.41069(8 ) . as already observed in the analytical result by nagle@xcite and in the multicanonical simulations by berg _",
    "et al._,@xcite the configurational entropy is higher than the earlier estimate by pauling . moreover , our result is slightly higher than that of nagle@xcite , who found @xmath0 = 0.41002 .",
    "our result is a little higher than that found by berg _",
    "et al._,@xcite , although we consider that both data are compatible one with the other , given the error bars ( see table  i ) .    apart from ice ih and cubic ice ic , we are not aware of any direct calculation of the configurational entropy of h - disordered ice for other ice structures . to assess the influence of the ice network on the entropy",
    ", we have also considered the case of ice vi , where h atoms are known to be disordered.@xcite in fig .",
    "4 we display our results for the configurational entropy of ice vi , as a function of the inverse network size .",
    "we find in this case a slope @xmath54 = 3.44 , much larger than for the square lattice and ice ih .",
    "the extrapolation of @xmath50 to infinite network size gives @xmath0 = 0.42138(11 ) , clearly higher than the value corresponding to ice ih ( a 2.6% larger ) .",
    "this result is remarkable , since up to now the only comparison in this respect concerned ice ih with the pauling estimate , being the entropy an 1.3% larger in the former case than in the latter .",
    "now we see that for ice vi the configurational entropy for this h - disordered structure is 3.9% larger than the pauling result .",
    "we note the tendency of the entropy @xmath0 to increase due to the presence of loops in the ice structure . in fact",
    ", the pauling approximation neglects the presence of loops , as happens in the so - called bethe lattice ( also known as cayley tree).@xcite this gives a value @xmath63 . for ice ih , which contains six - membered rings of water molecules ,",
    "the entropy is higher by an 1.3% , and it is still higher for the square lattice with four - membered rings ( a 6.4% respect the pauling approach ) . with this trend in mind , we could expect for ice vi a value of the entropy intermediate between those of ice ih and the square lattice , as it contains four- and six - membered rings ( apart from other larger loops).@xcite similarly , for ice networks with larger ring sizes , one can expect a smaller configurational entropy for disordered hydrogen distributions , and thus closer to the pauling result .    some further comments on table  i are in order . in most papers dealing with the configurational entropy of ice ,",
    "it is the parameter @xmath64 which is given , instead of the entropy @xmath0 itself . as we find directly @xmath0 from our thermodynamic integration , we have calculated @xmath64 in the different cases as @xmath65 .",
    "also the error bars @xmath66 and @xmath67 in the values of @xmath0 and @xmath64 , respectively , are related by the expression @xmath68 , as can be derived by differentiating the exponential function .",
    "our error bars for @xmath0 represent one standard deviation , as given by the least - square procedure employed to fit the data . in the result by nagle,@xcite",
    "the error bar was estimated by this author from an extrapolation of the series terms calculated in his analytical procedure .",
    "note also that , although the result obtained by pauling was intended to reproduce the residual entropy of ice ih , it does not take into account the actual ice network , but only the fourfold coordination of the structure .",
    "for this reason we qualify it as `` generic '' . concerning the results by berg _",
    "et al._@xcite , we note that these authors have recently@xcite given an entropy value for ice ih slightly smaller than their earlier result , but both of them are compatible one with the other , taking into account the statistical error bars .    to avoid any possible confusion , we emphasize that the simple model employed in our calculations is not intended to reproduce any physical characteristic of ice ( such as order / disorder transitions ) further than calculating the entropy of an h distribution compatible with the ice rules .",
    "it implicitly assumes that the distribution of h atoms on the ice network has no long - range order , and only imposes strict fulfillment of the ice rules ( short - range order ) in the limit @xmath19 .",
    "the configurational entropy obtained in this way is what has been traditionally called residual entropy of ice.@xcite with this in mind , we are not allowing for any violation of the third law of thermodynamics .    in this context",
    ", it is generally accepted that the equilibrium ice phases in the low - temperature limit ( at low and high pressures ) display ordered proton structures , as expected from a vanishing of the entropy .",
    "order - disorder transitions have been observed between several pairs of ice phases.@xcite these transitions are accompanied by orientational ordering of the water molecules , which implies a kinetically unfavorable reorganization of the h - bond network . in several cases ,",
    "the transition from a disordered to an ordered phase only occurs after doping the sample , which seems to provide a mechanism favoring the rearrangement of the h - bond network.@xcite thus , at low temperature ice ih transforms into ice xi , an h - ordered phase , but this transition has never been observed in pure ice , only in doped materials at 72 k.@xcite something similar happens for high - pressure phases , and ice vi in particular transforms into proton - ordered ice xv.@xcite    given the entropy difference found here for real structures such as ice ih and ice vi , a detailed knowledge of the configurational entropy for the different ice phases can be important for precise calculations of the phase diagram of water,@xcite as noted earlier for ice phases with partial proton ordering.@xcite",
    "we have presented results for the configurational entropy of h - disordered ice structures , calculated by means of a thermodynamic integration . a simple model allowed us to derive the entropy corresponding to each structure .",
    "this procedure has turned out to be very precise , indicating that the associated error bars can be made very small without employing sophisticated methods , but only using standard statistical mechanics and numerical procedures .    for real ice structures , such as ice ih and ice vi",
    ", we find a difference in configurational entropy of 2.6% . for ice vi",
    "we obtain an entropy value 3.9% higher than the pauling estimate , as a consequence of its particular network connectivity .",
    "this method can be applied to other ice structures with hydrogen disorder , which will presumably give different values for the configurational entropy , due to differences in their network topology ."
