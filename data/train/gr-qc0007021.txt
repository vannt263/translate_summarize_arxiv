    "gravitational time delay effects in general relativity have been considered by many authors .",
    "although general relativity makes unambiguous predictions for , e.g. , the time of reception of signals sent by a space probe orbiting nearly behind the sun  and these predictions have been observationally verified @xcite  it appears remarkably difficult to characterize these effects in a meaningful way in terms of the `` time delay '' of a light ray relative to the time required in minkowski spacetime .",
    "the reason for this difficulty is that , in general , there is no natural way to choose a flat background for a curved spacetime , and , thus , no meaningful way to compare the propagation of a light ray in a curved spacetime with that of a `` corresponding '' light ray in minkowski spacetime @xcite .",
    "recently , a general result on gravitational time delay was obtained in @xcite .",
    "the authors of @xcite considered linearized perturbations @xmath6 of minkowski spacetime that satisfy the linearized version of the the null energy condition .",
    "( the null energy condition states that @xmath7 for all null @xmath8 . )",
    "it was further required that no incoming gravitational radiation be present .",
    "it was then shown that in the lorentz gauge , @xmath9=0\\ ] ] the metric perturbation satisfies @xmath10 for all @xmath8 that are null with respect to the minkowski background , i.e. , @xmath11 .",
    "eq.([hk ] ) can be interpreted as saying that the light cones of the perturbed metric contract relative to the flat background , i.e. , the propagation of light is `` slower '' in the perturbed spacetime .",
    "however , the above result is highly gauge dependent , i.e. , it depends in a crucial way on how one chooses to compare the perturbed spacetime with the background minkowski spacetime .",
    "the choice of a different manner of comparison corresponds to changing @xmath12 via a gauge transformation @xmath13 the following is an explicit example of a smooth , pure gauge @xmath12 that `` opens out '' the light cones everywhere and also goes to zero as @xmath14 at spatial and null infinity : in spherical polar coordinates in minkowski spacetime , let @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the radially outward pointing vector with @xmath17 ( i.e. , @xmath18 ) and @xmath19 is any smooth function such that @xmath20 for @xmath21 , @xmath22 for @xmath23 , and @xmath24 , @xmath25 for all @xmath26 .",
    "then , we have @xmath27 ^ 2 } ( dr)_a r_b   - \\frac{2}{2+g(r ) } \\partial_{(a } r_{b ) } \\nonumber \\\\ & = & \\frac{2r g'(r)}{[2 + g(r)]^2 } ( dr)_a ( dr)_b - \\frac{2}{2+g(r ) } q_{ab}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath28 is the euclidean metric on the @xmath29 hypersurfaces . since @xmath20 for @xmath21 , we see that the orthonormal frame components of @xmath12 are @xmath30 as @xmath31 ( independently of @xmath32 ) . for any null vector @xmath8",
    ", we have @xmath33 ^ 2 } ( \\frac{\\vec k\\cdot \\vec x}{r})^2   - \\frac{2}{2+g(r ) } |\\vec k|^2 \\nonumber \\\\ & < & 0\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] i.e. , this pure gauge @xmath12 opens out the light cones everywhere . by adding a suitable multiple of this pure gauge perturbation to the perturbation considered in @xcite",
    ", we can reverse the conclusions of @xcite in any compact region of spacetime .",
    "indeed , a theorem of penrose @xcite proves that it is impossible to identify schwarzschild spacetime with minkowski spacetime so that the null infinities of the two spacetimes coincide and the light cones of the schwarzschild metric lie within the lightcones of the minkowski metric .",
    "( this does not contradict the results of @xcite because the lorentz gauge is ill behaved at null infinity @xcite . ) from the point of view taken in @xcite , penrose s result might be interpreted as an `` anti - time - delay '' theorem , but it would seem more reasonable to interpret both penrose s theorem and the results of @xcite as having more to do with the manner in which the identification of the curved and flat spacetimes are made than with gravitational time delay .    as pointed out by olum @xcite , in the case of a spacetime that is minkowskian outside of a world tube ( see fig . 2 of @xcite ) ,",
    "an unambiguous comparison with minkowski spacetime can be done in the minkowskian region , so the notion of `` time delay '' is well defined in this context .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that in such a spacetime , if the null energy condition ( [ nec ] ) and null generic condition ( see eq.([gc ] ) below ) hold within the non - flat region , then a `` time advance '' can not occur . however ,",
    "if the dominant energy condition holds , it is impossible to have a spacetime ( other than minkowski spacetime ) that is minkowskian outside of a worldtube , since the adm mass of such a spacetime would vanish , in contradiction with the positive mass theorem . in @xcite , an alternative characterization of `` time delay ''",
    "also was proposed .",
    "this characterization does not require a comparison with minkowski spacetime , and a time delay theorem was proven for this definition .    in this paper , we will prove two theorems related to `` time delay '' that also do not require a comparison with minkowski spacetime . both theorems apply to spacetimes",
    "that satisfy the null energy condition ( [ nec ] ) as well as the null generic condition .",
    "( the null generic condition is the statement that each null geodesic contains a point at which @xmath34cd[e } k_{f ] } k^c k^d \\neq 0 \\label{gc}\\ ] ] where @xmath8 denotes the tangent to the geodesic . )",
    "it appears likely that our assumption that the null generic condition holds could be significantly weakened by use of the null splitting theorems of @xcite , but we shall not consider this issue further here .    our first theorem states that in a null geodesically complete spacetime satisfying the null energy condition and the null generic condition , given any compact set @xmath0 , there exists another compact set @xmath1 satisfying the following property : if @xmath4 and @xmath5 are any two events lying outside of @xmath1 such that @xmath35 , then any causal curve , @xmath3 , connecting @xmath4 with @xmath5 ( which necessarily must be a null geodesic ) can not enter @xmath0 ( see fig .",
    "the relationship of this result to `` time delay '' is as follows : if it were possible to arrange the spacetime geometry in a compact region @xmath0 so as to produce a `` time advance '' , then one might expect a `` fastest null geodesic '' @xmath3 to take advantage of this by entering @xmath0 .",
    "thus , the theorem suggests that `` time advance '' is not possible , although it is difficult to make a strong argument for this interpretation , since the theorem gives little control over the size of the region @xmath1 .",
    "some additional applications of this theorem will be given in section 2 .    in section 3",
    ", we present our second theorem . in this theorem , we restrict attention to spacetimes satisfying the null energy condition and null generic condition to which a timelike conformal boundary can be attached , such that the conformally completed spacetime , @xmath36 , satisfies strong causality together with the property that for all @xmath37 , the set @xmath38 is compact .",
    "the prototype spacetimes satisfying these properties are asymptotically anti - de sitter spacetimes , although anti - de sitter spacetime itself would not be in this class on account of its failure to satisfy the null generic condition . for the spacetimes satisfying the hypotheses of this theorem",
    ", we prove that any `` fastest null geodesic '' in @xmath36 connecting two points @xmath39 in the conformal boundary , @xmath40 , must lie entirely within @xmath40 .",
    "now , in the case of anti - de sitter spacetime itself , it turns out that if the points @xmath41 are the past and future endpoints in @xmath36 of a null geodesic in @xmath42 , then there also exists a null geodesic in @xmath40 connecting @xmath4 and @xmath5 , but no `` faster '' null geodesic exists , i.e. , @xmath5 lies on the boundary of the future of @xmath4 in @xmath36 . in other words , in anti",
    "- de sitter spacetime , in a `` race '' to get from @xmath43 to a point in @xmath40 antipodal to @xmath4 , there is a `` tie '' between null geodesics passing through @xmath42 and null geodesics lying in @xmath40 .",
    "our theorem proves that in a generically perturbed anti - de sitter spacetime , this `` tie '' is always broken in favor of geodesics lying within the boundary .",
    "thus , our theorem can be interpreted as saying that in generically perturbed anti - de sitter spacetime , there is always a `` time delay '' relative to anti - de sitter spacetime itself . a similar result under somewhat different hypotheses",
    "has previously been obtained by woolgar @xcite .",
    "our notation and conventions throughout this paper follow those of @xcite .",
    "all spacetimes considered in this paper will be assumed to be connected , smooth , time oriented , and paracompact .",
    "no assumption will be made about the dimensionality of spacetime , i.e. , our results hold in any spacetime dimension .",
    "in this section , we will prove the following theorem fails to contain a null line . since the present hypotheses of theorem 1 ( i.e. , null geodesic completeness , the null energy condition , and the null generic condition ) preclude the existence of a null line ,",
    "galloway s modification of theorem 1 is a stronger result than our version .",
    "galloway s proof of his version of theorem 1 provides a direct construction of a null line when the conclusion of theorem 1 fails , thereby bypassing lemma 1 ( whose proof makes explicit use of the null energy condition).[gg ] ] and then discuss some applications of it .",
    "let @xmath44 be a null geodesically complete spacetime satisfying the null energy condition ( [ nec ] ) and the null generic condition ( see eq.([gc ] ) ) . then given any compact region @xmath45",
    ", there exists another compact region @xmath46 containing k such that if @xmath47 and @xmath35 , then any causal curve @xmath3  connecting @xmath4 to @xmath5 can not intersect the region @xmath0 .    the proof of this theorem , will be based upon a lemma that we shall state and prove below . before doing",
    "so we introduce some notation and recall some facts about conjugate points .",
    "since @xmath42 is time oriented , we may choose a continuous , nowhere vanishing , future - directed timelike vector field @xmath48 .",
    "we define @xmath49 where @xmath50 denotes the tangent space at @xmath4 .",

    "it follows that in @xmath200 , there exists a past directed causal limit curve @xmath55 through @xmath5 which either is past inextendible or has a past endpoint at @xmath4 .",
    "let @xmath230 .",
    "( such a @xmath231 exists because @xmath40 is timelike . )",
    "then each @xmath227 lies in @xmath232 , which is compact , and hence is closed as a subset of @xmath200 .",
    "consequently , since @xmath55 is a limit curve of the sequence @xmath233 , we have @xmath234",
    ". however , since @xmath235 is compact and @xmath36 is strongly causal , @xmath55 can not be past inextendible ( see , e.g. , lemma 8.2.1 of @xcite ) .",
    "thus , @xmath55 must have a past endpoint at @xmath4 .",
    "consequently , we have @xmath224 , as we desired to show .    finally , for @xmath222 , let @xmath236 be any causal curve in @xmath36 connecting @xmath4 with @xmath5 .",
    "suppose there exists a point @xmath237 .",
    "then there must exist an open segment of @xmath236 contained in @xmath42 with endpoints on @xmath40 .",
    "by the same arguments as in the first paragraph of this proof , we can deform this segment of @xmath236 to a timelike curve in @xmath42 , keeping its endpoints fixed .",
    "we may then further deform @xmath236 to a timelike curve in @xmath42 connecting @xmath4 with @xmath5 . however , this contradicts the fact that @xmath222 .",
    "thus , we have @xmath238 , so @xmath236 must lie entirely in @xmath40 . since @xmath239 is a spacetime in its own right , and since @xmath240 [ with @xmath241 and @xmath242",
    "now defined with respect to the spacetime @xmath239 ] it follows that @xmath236 must be a null geodesic with respect to @xmath244 .",
    "@xmath131    it should be noted that anti - de sitter spacetime satisfies all of the hypotheses of theorem 2 except for the null generic condition .",
    "it also should be noted that anti - de sitter spacetime fails to satisfy part of the conclusion of theorem 2 : @xmath173-dimensional anti - de sitter spacetime is conformal to the region @xmath245 of the einstein static universe @xmath246 thus , @xmath40 is comprised by the @xmath247-sphere @xmath248 . for @xmath222 with @xmath4 and @xmath5 at antipodal points of this sphere , then in addition to null geodesics in @xmath40 that connect @xmath4 with @xmath5 , there also exist null geodesics in @xmath42 that connect @xmath4 with @xmath5 @xcite , in contradiction with the last sentence of theorem 2 .",
    "however , theorem 2 implies that if we perturb anti - de sitter spacetime in such a way that the geometry of @xmath40 is not changed and in such a way that all of the hypotheses of theorem 2 hold ( including the null generic condition ) , then @xmath4 and @xmath5 no longer can be joined by a causal curve that enters @xmath42 .",
    "since the boundary geometry has not changed , we have a well defined , fixed `` reference frame '' with respect to which we can compare the causal properties of asymptotically anti - de sitter spacetimes with that of anti - de sitter spacetime itself .",
    "thus , as already indicated in the introduction , theorem 2 may be interpreted as implying that the propagation of light through an asymptotically anti - de sitter spacetime will always be `` delayed '' relative to propagation through anti - de sitter spacetime itself .",
