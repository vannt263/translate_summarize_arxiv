    "nevertheless , susy can only be an approximate symmetry in nature .",
    "several scenarios for the mechanism of susy breaking , based on very different physical models , have been proposed .",
    "a possibility to constrain the type and scale of susy breaking is to study , with very high precision , the relations between the mssm parameters evaluated at the electroweak and the gut scales .",

    "a comprehensive high - precision analysis can be performed at the international linear collider ( ilc ) , for which the estimated experimental accuracy is at the per mill level .",

    "the agreement between the different codes is in general within one percent  @xcite . a first three - loop running analysis , based , however , only on one - loop threshold effects ,",

    "the three - loop corrections reduce significantly the dependence on the scale at which heavy particles are integrated out and on the other hand , they are essential for phenomenological studies , because they are as large as , or greater than , the effects induced by the current experimental accuracy of @xmath7 . our aim is to compute @xmath0 at a high - energy scale @xmath8 with three - loop accuracy , starting from the sm parameter @xmath7 as input . additionally , we compare the predictions obtained within the above mentioned approach with those based on the leading - logarithmic ( ll ) approximation suggested in ref .",

    "the @xmath3 scheme , based on regularization by dimensional reduction ( dred ) and modified minimal subtraction , is most convenient . on the other hand , the values of the sm parameters",

    "the parameters of the various effective theories are related by so - called decoupling ( or matching ) constants .",
    "when going from a high to a low energy scale , one may separately integrate out every particle at its individual threshold .",

    "in particular , it is unclear which value was used for @xmath154 in eq.([eq::mms2dr_2 ] ) .",
    "it should be pointed out that the formulae and prescriptions of ref .",
    "@xcite have been partially taken over in the outline of the spa project  @xcite . however , as in the case of the strong coupling , various orders of perturbation theory have been combined inconsistently .",
    "thus , let us stress again that the formulae of ref .",
    "@xcite should not be taken over literally in phenomenological analyses if precision is of concern .",
    "application of dred to non - susy theories is rather cumbersome compared to dreg because of the occurrence of evanescent couplings .",
    "however , when low energy precision data such as @xmath155 or @xmath156 are related to their counterparts in a susy theory at high energies , one may need to switch between the @xmath2 and the @xmath3 scheme at some energy scale .",
    "the conversion formulae will involve evanescent couplings , sometimes already at one - loop level , as in the case of the quark mass .",
    "we have used recent three- and four - loop results for the @xmath22 functions , the quark anomalous dimension , and the decoupling coefficients in order to derive @xmath157 and @xmath158 from @xmath159 and @xmath160 at three- and four - loop level , respectively .",
    "it turns out that the three - loop terms are numerically significant both for @xmath0 and for @xmath5 . the dependence on where the susy spectrum is decoupled becomes particularly flat in this case .",
    "the theoretical uncertainty is expected to be negligible w.r.t .  the uncertainty induced by the experimental input values .",
    "comparing our results and methods to the literature , we find that the issue of evanescent couplings has either been ignored ( by assuming @xmath161 ) or circumvented by decoupling the susy spectrum at @xmath162 .",
    "we find that at one- and two - loop level , this choice does not allow for a good approximation of the higher order effects , if one assumes the susy partner masses to be of the order of 1tev .    to conclude",
    ", we strongly suggest that phenomenological studies concerning the implications of low energy data on grand unification should be done at three - loop level , and that decoupling effects and evanescent couplings are properly taken into account .",
