    "the link between the deep infrared behaviour of the gluon and ghost propagators and confinement , has motivated a great effort on computing these quantities on the lattice . besides checking gluon confinement criteria ,",
    "another important goal is to compare recent solutions of the dyson - schwinger equations with lattice results . in particular , the scaling solution @xcite predicts a vanishing gluon propagator and a divergent ghost propagator at zero momentum .",
    "this solution complies with gribov - zwanziger @xcite and kugo - ojima @xcite confinement criteria . on the other hand ,",
    "the decoupling solution @xcite claims that a finite and non - vanishing zero momentum gluon propagator and a tree level like ghost propagator . the value of the zero momentum gluon propagator is connected with a dynamical generated gluon mass .    in this paper",
    "we report on our current results for the cucchieri - mendes bounds in su(3 ) lattice gauge theory .",
    "the cucchieri - mendes bounds @xcite provide upper and lower bounds for the zero momentum gluon propagator of lattice yang - mills theories in terms of the average value of the gluon field .",
    "in particular , they relate the gluon propagator at zero momentum @xmath0 with @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the number of space - time dimensions , and @xmath3 the number of colors . in the above equation ,",
    "@xmath4 is the @xmath5 color component of the gluon field at zero momentum , defined by @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the @xmath5 color component of the gluon field in the real space .",
    "@xmath0 is related with @xmath8 by @xmath9 in the last equation @xmath10 means monte carlo average over gauge configurations . for convenience we will use the definition @xmath11 .",
    "the bounds in equation ( [ bounds ] ) are a direct result of the monte carlo approach .",
    "the interest on these bounds comes from allowing a scaling analysis which can help understanding the finite volume behaviour of @xmath0 : assuming that each of the terms in inequality ( [ bounds ] ) scales with the volume according to @xmath12 , the simplest possibility and the one considered in @xcite , an @xmath13 for @xmath14 clearly indicates that @xmath15 as the infinite volume is approached . in this sense , this scaling analysis allows to investigate the behaviour of @xmath0 in the infinite volume limit .    for the su(2 ) yang - mills theory @xcite , the results show a @xmath16 for the two dimensional theory , but a @xmath17 for three and four dimensional formulations .",
    "we have studied the cucchieri - mendes bounds within su(3 ) lattice gauge theory for three values of the gauge coupling : @xmath18 @xcite , @xmath19 @xcite , and @xmath20 .",
    ".,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    in table [ setup60 ] we present the lattice setup for @xmath18 , pointing out the differences to @xcite .",
