    "the transport of angular momentum in protoplanetary discs is most probably driven by the magnetorotational instability , described by @xcite , and hereafter referred to as mri .",
    "since the protoplanetary discs are ionized rather weakly , in some regions of the disc the ionization degree @xmath0 can decrease below a critical level , @xmath1 , at which the gas decouples from the magnetic field and the mri decays .",
    "such region is referred to as a _",
    "dead zone _",
    ", contrary to the so called _ active zone _ where the mri operates .",
    "the most important processes responsible for the ionization of gas in protoplanetary discs are 1 ) particle collisions due to thermal motions , and 2 ) irradiation by cosmic rays and high - energy photons originating from the central star .",
    "the collisional ionization dominates in the innermost part of the disc , where the temperature is high enough to maintain @xmath2 at all distances from the disc plane .",
    "further away from the star @xmath1 is exceeded only in two surface layers ( on both sides of the disc ) , each ionized by cosmic rays and stellar x - ray quanta , and having approximately constant column density @xmath3 . both processes result in the following distribution of disc activity : at @xmath4 ( where the thermal ionization degree exceeds @xmath5 ) the whole disc is active ; at @xmath6 ( where @xmath7 ) a dead zone is sandwiched between two active layers ; and at @xmath8 ( where @xmath9 ) the whole disc becomes active again .",
    "this model was proposed by @xcite to explain the fu  ori outbursts .",
    "fu  ori stars are young stellar objects whose optical brightness occasionally increases by @xmath10  mag on a time - scale of @xmath11  yr , and remains at the increased level for @xmath12  yr .",
    "it is generally believed that these events are related to the variations of the accretion rate in circumstellar discs .",
    "to explain the observed increase in luminosities the accretion rate has to change from @xmath13 to @xmath14  m@xmath15yr@xmath16 , implying that as much as @xmath17m@xmath15 must be accreted onto the central star during the outburst @xcite .",
    "the fu  ori phenomenon may be caused by a thermal instability of the protoplanetary disc ( see e.g. @xcite , @xcite and references therein ) , analogous to the one operating in accretion discs around primary components of cataclysmic binaries @xcite . however , the thermal instability model has difficulties with explaining long duration of the outbursts , since the high accretion rate during the outburst quickly removes most of the material from the inner part of the disc where the instability occurs @xcite .",
    "a transition of the very inner disc to the outburst state due to the thermal instability was studied by @xcite with the help of the similar two - dimensional code as used in this work .",
    "@xcite suggested that this problem may be solved by the layered model , in which the dead zone serves as a mass reservoir for the outburst . in the layered disc",
    "the accretion rate can be an increasing function of @xmath18 . when this is the case , an annulus centred at @xmath19 receives more mass per unit time from the disc exterior to it @xmath20 than it loses to the disc interior to it @xmath21 , causing the matter to accumulate in the dead zone .",
    "if this process lasts long enough , the total surface density of the disc may become so large that once the accretion was somehow triggered in the dead zone it would release enough heat to restore the coupling between the matter and the magnetic field .",
    "such an `` ignition '' of the accumulated matter would then start a self - sustaining outflow of mas from the dead zone into the inner disc , substantially increasing the accretion rate .",
    "@xcite assume that the triggering factor is the gravitational instability .",
    "their model shows repeating periods of vigorous accretion separated by quiescent intervals lasting @xmath22  yr , in qualitative agreement with the observed properties of fu  ori objects . however , our radiation - hydrodynamic simulations of layered discs ( @xcite , hereafter paper  i ) indicate , that it may be rather difficult for the dead zone to store @xmath23m@xmath15 of the disc matter necessary to feed an fu  ori outburst .",
    "the reason is the ring instability described in paper  i , which , long before the required mass is reached , causes the dead zone to split into well - defined rings that become unstable to the instability discovered by @xcite .    in the present paper",
    "we extend the simulations reported in paper  i onto a broader range of disc parameters , with the principal aim to find in which conditions the dead zone could become massive enough to account for fu  ori outbursts . for reasons explained in",
    " 2 , along with models whose dead zones are entirely free of viscosity we explore models with some residual viscosity acting in the region which formally should be declared dead .",
    "we also explore the effect of different viscosity prescriptions .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in ",
    "2 we briefly describe the numerical methods and input physics . the results of simulations are reported in  3 . in ",
    "4 we give a simple analytical description of processes at the inner boundary of the dead zone , and derive conditions for ignition . in  5 we summarize our results and discuss the limits of the mass accumulation process .",
    "as in paper  i , the simulations are performed in spherical coordinates with the help of the radiation - hydrodynamics code tramp @xcite .",
    "the models are axially symmetric , but we do not impose an additional mirror symmetry with respect to the mid - plane of the disc , i.e. we allow for the flow through the mid - plane .",
    "further technical details , like boundary conditions or initialization procedure , can be found in paper  i.    the viscosity is treated according to the @xmath24-prescription of @xcite . in paper",
    "i , following the argument that the turbulent viscosity coefficient should be proportional to the product of sound speed and the largest scale available for the turbulent eddies , we used the formula    @xmath25    where @xmath26 is the half - thickness of the active layer , @xmath27 is the sound - speed at the bottom of the active layer and @xmath24 is a dimensionless parameter discussed below . in the present work this formula is employed in models @xmath28 .",
    "the remaining models are obtained based on an alternative formula which allows for variations of @xmath29 with the distance from the mid - plane @xmath30 where @xmath31 and @xmath32 are _ local _ values of sound speed and angular velocity .",
    "obviously , in a vertically averaged approximation assuming the zero - thickness dead zone both prescriptions are equivalent ; however , in two - dimensional models with the dead zone , we found that the details of the evolution are sensitive to the particular form of the viscosity formula ( see  3 ) .",
    "we assume that at @xmath33  k the ionization degree is high enough for the magnetorotational instability to operate and provide the source of viscosity , whereas at @xmath34 the mri is quenched .",
    "this assumption is based on the fact that at @xmath35  k @xmath0 increases by five orders of magnitude due to ionization of potassium @xcite .",
    "further , based on the cosmic ray stopping depth calculated by @xcite , we assume that on both sides of the disc a surface layer of column density @xmath36  g@xmath37 is made active due to ionization by energetic particles of cosmic origin .    in principle , ionization due to x - rays from the central star should also be taken into account . however , the corresponding active surface layer is probably not thicker than a few tens of g@xmath37 @xcite .",
    "the x - rays become important when the disc is screened from cosmic rays by magnetized stellar winds @xcite . in such cases the ionization structure of the disc strongly depends on various model parameters like properties of the x - ray source , critical magnetic reynolds number or abundance of heavy metals @xcite , and it is not possible to define one critical @xmath3 for all possible circumstances . unfortunately ,",
    "such effects are too complicated to take them into account in multidimensional simulations , and an active surface layer of constant column density must serve as the necessary approximation . in effect , to define the boundary of the dead zone we employ the simple model of disc ionization structure introduced by @xcite .    in paper  i @xmath24 was set to 0 within the dead zone .",
    "however , it has been recently argued that the dead zone is not entirely dead in the sense that a residual viscosity can be maintained there by a purely hydrodynamic turbulence , excited by the non - axisymmetric waves propagating from the mri - turbulent active layers @xcite . following those arguments , in some models we allow for @xmath38 .",
    "however , in all models the dead zone is much less viscous than the active zone , i.e. @xmath39 .    in the previous work we neglected the transport of heat by micro - turbulence , i.e. the heat was transported across the disc by radiation only .",
    "the same approximation is adopted here . while it would be poorly justified in 1-d models ( see e.g. @xcite ) , it is entirely reasonable in 2-d discs , where the most important ( i.e. the largest ) turbulent scales are automatically taken into account , as they are resolved on the grid .",
    "based on the similarity of the turbulence maintained by the magnetorotational instability to kolmogoroff turbulence @xcite , we estimated that the subgrid micro - turbulent flux is not significant compared to the radiative one .",
    "varying @xmath40 , @xmath41 and the viscosity prescription , we obtained a set of disc models listed in table [ modeltab ] .",
    "models 1 - 5 , 7 and 8 were followed for several thousand orbits of the outer edge of the disc on a grid of @xmath42 points in @xmath18 and @xmath43 , respectively .",
    "model 6 , which is compared to the analytical description of the disc obtained in ",
    "[ sec : oscil ] is computed on a grid with double resolution ( @xmath44 ) .",
    "the size of the computational domain was set so that it included a small part of the inner @xmath24-disc and a part of the dead zone where the ignitions took place . in radial direction , it was @xmath45  au for models 1 - 6 , @xmath46  au for model 7 and @xmath47  au for model 8 .",
    "the vertical extent of the computational domain was @xmath48 for all models .",
    ".parameters of the disc models . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      this model is the same as the one described in paper  i , but the current resolution is two times lower .",
    "the main purpose of this calculation was to check if we recover all essential features and time - scales observed and measured in paper  i , which is indeed the case .",
    "the model develops a strong instability , which quickly leads to the formation of well - separated rings , most of which remain stable for at least a few hundred years .",
    "however , they would probably decay in 3d due to the hydrodynamic instability discovered by @xcite as noted in paper  i.    paper  i contains a detailed discussion of the ring instability mechanism . here",
    "we only mention that the key element of that mechanism is the coupling between the changes of the dead zone thickness and the mass accumulation rate .",
    "it turns out that the accretion rate drops at the inner edge of the ring , which works as a bottle - neck in the accretion flow along the active surface layer . as a consequence",
    ", matter accumulates preferably in the ring .    since only a small amount of mass flows from the ring inwards , the growth of a given ring is substantially slowed down when additional rings are formed further away from the centre of the disc .",
    "if several rings are simultaneously present in the grid , the accretion rate ( always measured at the inner boundary of the computational domain ) drops to a value as low as @xmath52  m@xmath15yr@xmath16 . as the ring accretes mass and becomes denser , its central temperature increases .",
    "once it exceeds @xmath53 , the ring ignites and a `` mini - outburst '' ensues , after which the ring is rebuilt at the same position .",
    "the accretion rate onto the star increases up to to approximately @xmath54  m@xmath15yr@xmath16 during an ignition of a single innermost ring ( at @xmath55 and @xmath56  yr ) .",
    "moreover , two cases of `` induced ignition '' are observed at @xmath57 and @xmath58  yr .",
    "in such a case the heat produced by the ignition and accretion of a particular ring is transported by the radiation to the neighbour rings and makes them active .",
    "the accretion rate onto the star increases up to @xmath59 and @xmath60  m@xmath15yr@xmath16 .",
    "this model evolves very similarly to model  1 .",
    "the non - zero viscosity in the dead zone causes the temperature inside the rings to increase faster , and the induced ignition occurs earlier than in model  1 .",
    "the accretion rate in both quiet and ignited states are almost the same as in model  1 .      in this model",
    "we also observe the tendency toward ring formation .",
    "however , the viscosity in the dead zone is now sufficiently high to prevent it from splitting .",
    "the behaviour characteristic of the rings in models 1 and 2 is now observed in the whole low - viscosity area : as the surface density of the disc grows , the temperature at the mid - plane grows as well , and ignition occurs once it exceeds @xmath53 .",
    "the accretion rate is increased to @xmath63  m@xmath15yr@xmath16 , the accumulated mass is quickly removed from the ignited region , and the layered structure is re - established . such mini - outbursts repeat on a time - scale of @xmath64  yr .",
    "they are not strictly periodic , since the surface density of the layered part of the disc is not completely smooth , as it is incessantly perturbed by the ring instability . at @xmath65  yr the whole dead zone contained in the computational domain is ignited and the accretion rate increases up to @xmath66  m@xmath15yr@xmath16 . since the mini - outburst is stopped by the outer boundary , and the peak accretion rate is probably underestimated .",
    "simulation that produced model  1 is now repeated with the modified viscosity prescription . since in the modified prescription",
    "there is no direct connection between the thickness of the active layer and the viscosity coefficient , the ring instability needs much more time to develop .",
    "the growth rate of the instability is approximately one order of magnitude lower than in model 1 . by the end of the simulation only the innermost ring is separated from the dead zone , while the remaining ones are visible only as density enhancements within the dead zone .",
    "no ignition events are observed .",
    "the radial extent of the innermost ring is approximately twice as big as the one in model  1 , and its mass is @xmath68  m@xmath15 ( approximately five times more than in model  1 ) .",
    "this model differs from model  2 in the same way as model  4 from model  1 , i.e. only in the formula employed to describe the viscosity . with the modified formula",
    "the residual viscosity in the formally dead area is high enough to prevent the formation rings before the dead zone ignites at @xmath69  yr . as a result of ignition",
    "the accretion rate increases @xmath70  m@xmath15yr@xmath16 to @xmath71  m@xmath15yr@xmath16 .",
    "this mini - outburst involves the whole dead zone in the computational domain , so the peak accretion rate is probably underestimated , as in the case of model  3 . approximately @xmath68",
    "m@xmath15 were accreted onto the star during this mini - outburst .      in this case",
    ", the high viscosity in the dead zone completely suppresses the ring instability and the surface density remains smooth in the layered region .",
    "recurrent ignitions and replenishments of the dead zone lead to the periodic oscillations of its inner boundary .",
    "the period of these oscillations is around @xmath72  yr .",
    "since the mass accumulates in the whole dead zone , a progressively larger part of it is ignited at each oscillation , and the amplitude of the oscillations generally increases .",
    "this increase is accompanied by a slow secular increase of the accretion rate at the inner boundary ( from @xmath73  m@xmath15yr@xmath16 in the beginning to @xmath74  m@xmath15yr@xmath16 at @xmath75  yr ) .",
    "after each ignition the accretion rate temporarily increases by approximately @xmath76 .",
    "the model evolves similarly to model 6 .",
    "the accretion rate slowly grows from @xmath79 in the beginning to @xmath80  m@xmath15yr@xmath16 at @xmath81  yr .",
    "the relative changes during mini - outbursts are slightly higher , reaching approximately @xmath82 . at @xmath83",
    "yr a strong convection occurs in the inner @xmath24-disc which makes the accretion rate curve noisy .",
    "this model exhibits very regular mini - outbursts with period @xmath86  yr . the accretion rate at the inner boundary changes from @xmath87 in the quiet state to the peak value @xmath88  m@xmath15yr@xmath16 .",
    "the amplitude of the oscillations remains constant , however , double mini - outbursts occur at later stages of the evolution ( starting at @xmath89  yr ) .",
    "the time separation of the two peaks in such double mini - outburst is approximately @xmath90  yr . the outer part of the dead zone is not affected by the oscillations  it remains stationary ( see  [ sect : statsol ] ) .",
    "in general , the numerical models exhibit two most remarkable phenomena . if @xmath51 ( models 1 and 4 ) , the dead zone tends to split into rings . on the other hand , if @xmath91 ( models 3 and 6 - 8 ) , the dead zone remains unsplit , but the inner boundary of the dead zone starts to oscillate .",
    "the mass accumulated in this part of the dead zone is periodically depleted .",

    "if @xmath93 some accretion in the dead zone occurs . however , as long as the accretion in the active layers dominates , the accretion rate is , in general , a function of radius .",

    "these oscillations are more or less regular with period between several tens and several hundreds years depending on model parameters .",
    "they can be accompanied by variations of the accretion rate on a time - scale as short as ten years , at a relative amplitude reaching from a few per cent to 200  300 per cent in the high viscosity model 8 .",
    "these variations would be rather difficult to observe , however it does not seem absolutely impossible . since the properties of these oscillations are quite sensitive to physical conditions in the disc , such observations could help to constrain the set of models of protoplanetary discs .",
    "similar variations of the accretion rate were also found by @xcite using an one - dimensional hydrodynamic code . however , the period was much longer than in our model ( @xmath177  yr ) .",
    "the reason for that may be that in his models the ignition of the inner part of the dead zone is much more difficult due to the absence of the radiation transport ( and , generally speaking , due to oversimplified description of the interactions between the inner hot @xmath24-disc and the layered region ) .",
    "we give an analytical description of these oscillations based on the vertically averaged model modified for the case of layered disc .",
    "it illustrates the mechanism of the dead zone oscillations and tests the numerical model .",
    "finally , we perform a simple 1-d model of the layered disc based on the analytical solution to follow the evolution of the whole layered region for a long time .",
    "we found that with @xmath93 a stationary layered region may exist at higher radii ( this was also observed in numerical model  8) .",
    "part of this stationary region is still combustible , i.e. it may be made active by increasing the temperature by some external event , and part of its mass is available for accretion .",
    "we compare the amount of mass stored in the combustible region to the mass accreted during a fu  ori type outburst following the idea that the dead zone can serve as a mass reservoir for such event .",
    "we found , that these masses are comparable for the case of massive disc with the high accretion rate , which is in agreement with the observation that the fu  ori objects are very young systems .",
