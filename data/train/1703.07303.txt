    "signal processing and signal transmission play an important role in many different areas .",
    "typical problems include the reconstruction of a signal by its discretely sampled values as well as the detection of changes from a given reference signal . for univariate signals @xmath0 , sampled equidistantly using a sampling period @xmath1 and disturbed by additive noise , such that one obtains a block of noisy samples @xmath2 where @xmath3 a nonparametric joint reconstruction / detection algorithm has been proposed in the paper of @xcite .",
    "their approach has several appealing features .",
    "firstly , the algorithm can detect changes while reconstructing the signal at the same time .",
    "secondly , it is a nonparametric approach , i.e.  no further information about the exact class to which the observed signal belongs is necessary .",
    "lastly , the procedure works in a sequential way such that changes can be detected on - line , in contrast to off - line detection schemes which can first detect changes in retrospect , i.e.  when the whole data set is already available .",
    "a natural question arises whether this approach also works for high - dimensional signals .",
    "one answer to this problem is given in @xcite , where the authors treat matrix - valued signals and apply results from @xcite by considering quadratic forms . in the present paper , however , we consider a more general framework by focusing our attention on signals @xmath4 for @xmath5 .",
    "examples for such signals are multifaceted , including geographic and climatic data as well as image data , that are observed over a fixed time horizon . in order to simplify the notation we fix @xmath6 as this case also covers the most interesting applications .",
    "however , our results also hold true for @xmath7 and arbitrary @xmath8 and the corresponding proofs can easily be completed along the same lines .",
    "thus , in the following we are interested in reconstructing three - dimensional signals and , at the same time , in detecting changes from a given reference signal . here , one component represents the time and the other two the location .",
    "the application that we have in mind are video signals , i.e.  sequences of image frames over time .",
    "the basis on which we now want to establish our investigations is a finite block of noisy samples @xmath9 that  in accordance with model ( [ basicmodelpreface ] )  is obtained from the model @xmath10 here , @xmath11 is the unknown signal depending on time ( @xmath12 ) and location ( @xmath13 and @xmath14 ) , @xmath15 is a zero mean random field and @xmath16 , are the sampling periods .",
    "we assume that they fulfill @xmath17 and @xmath18 , @xmath19 as @xmath20 . as in @xcite",
    "we want to base our approaches on classical reconstruction procedures from the signal sampling theory , leading to sequential partial sum processes as detector statistics , see section [ detalg ] . in order to make these detector statistics applicable we need to determine proper control limits ; thus , in section [ limdist ] we will show that we can generalize the two main weak convergence results in @xcite to our multidimensional context , i.e.  we show weak convergence of the detection process towards gaussian processes under different assumptions on the dependence structure of the noise processes where either the null hypothesis @xmath21 or the alternative @xmath22 holds true . in section [ ext ] we present extensions to weighting functions , which allow to detect the location of the change as well , and discuss how to treat the case of an unknown but time - constant reference signal",
    ". finally , in section [ sim ] we present some simulation results concerning the rejection rates and the power of the detection algorithm .",
    "we now want to extend the main results of @xcite to signals @xmath4 with @xmath6 . as in @xcite",
    "we base our estimator of @xmath11 on results of the signal sampling theory like the shannon - whittaker theorem .",
    "this theorem has generalizations to signals with several variables . in three dimensions we have for band - limited functions on @xmath23\\times[-\\omega_2,\\omega_2]\\times[-\\omega_3,\\omega_3]$ ] with @xmath24 the representation @xmath25 where @xmath26 , cf .",
    "@xcite , p.  1571 .",
    "the most direct idea to construct an estimator of @xmath11 would now be to just replace the values of @xmath27 at @xmath28 by the noisy observations @xmath29 .",
    "however , @xcite have shown that this naive estimator is not even consistent in one dimension . instead",
    ", they propose a post - filtering correction of the so - called oversampled version of the shannon - whittaker series to filter out high frequencies .",
    "this is the approach that we also adapt here . in three dimensions this oversampled version is of the form @xmath30 for @xmath31 .",
    "if we convolve this version with @xmath32 use the fact that @xmath33 and replace @xmath34 by the noisy sample @xmath35 , this finally leads to the following truncated convolution form as an estimator for @xmath36 namely @xmath37 cf .",
