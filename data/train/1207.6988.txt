    "hd57682 is an 09 subgiant , and one of only eight o - type stars convincingly detected to host magnetic fields : the zero - age main sequence ( zams ) o7v star @xmath5 ori c = hd37022 @xcite , the more evolved of?p stars hd108 @xcite , hd148937 @xcite , hd191612 @xcite , ngc 1624 - 2 @xcite and cpd -28 2561 @xcite , the recently detected carina nebula star tr16 - 22 @xcite , and hd57682 @xcite .",
    "in addition , a small number of other o - type stars have been tentatively reported to be magnetic in modern literature ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "these stars have either been found through independent observation and/or analysis to be non - magnetic ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , or have yet to be independently re - observed or re - analysed .",
    "these small numbers are both a reflection of the rarity of o - type stars with detectable magnetic fields , and the challenge of detecting such fields when present .",
    "based on seven spectropolarimetric observations of hd57682 , @xcite characterised its physical and wind properties , deriving , in particular , a mass of @xmath6 , a radius of @xmath7 , a mass - loss rate @xmath8@xmath9yr@xmath10 and wind terminal velocity @xmath11kms@xmath10 .",
    "their spectroscopic and magnetic data indicated that the star was variable , likely periodically on a time - scale of a few weeks . using the bayesian statistical method of @xcite",
    ", @xcite estimated the surface dipole strength to be @xmath12 g .",
    "this magnetic field strength , combined with the inferred physical and wind parameters , indicated a wind magnetic confinement parameter of @xmath13 @xcite , leading the authors to suggest that the observed line profile variations were a consequence of dense wind plasma confined in closed magnetic loops above the stellar surface .",
    "the present study seeks to refine and elaborate the preliminary results reported by @xcite . in sect .",
    "[ obs_sect ] we discuss the new and archival observations used in our analysis , including extraction of least - squares deconvolved ( lsd ) mean profiles and measurement of the longitudinal magnetic field . in sect .",
    "[ period_sect ] we perform a period analysis of the h@xmath0 and longitudinal field data and demonstrate that a single period of @xmath1463d is required to reproduce the periodic variations of the measurements , which span over 15 years . in sect .",
    "[ rot_sect ] we discuss the implications of the inferred rotation period for the projected rotational velocity of the star , and , in particular , the estimate of 15  kms@xmath10 proposed by @xcite . in sect .",
    "[ mag_field_sect ] we constrain the magnetic field properties using the longitudinal field measurements and direct fits to the observed lsd stokes @xmath15 profiles . in sect .",
    "[ spec_var_sect ] we present an extensive overview of the variability of line profiles of h , he and metals . in sect .",
    "[ magneto_sect ] we revisit the magnetospheric framework proposed by @xcite , and in sect .",
    "[ disc_sect ] we discuss our results and present our conclusions .",
    "a total of 38 polarimetric observations were collected with the high - resolution ( @xmath16 ) espadons spectropolarimeter mounted on the canada - france - hawaii telescope ( cfht ) .",
    "the observations were obtained in the context of the magnetism in massive stars ( mimes ) cfht large program on 20 different nights over a period of two years from 2008 december to 2010 december .",
    "each observation consists of a sequence of four sub - exposures that were processed using the upena pipeline running libre - esprit , as described by @xcite .",
    "the final reduced products consist of an unpolarised stokes  @xmath17 and circularly polarised stokes @xmath15 spectrum .",
    "the individual sub - exposures are also combined in such a way that the polarisation should cancel out , resulting in a diagnostic null spectrum that is used to test for spurious signals in the data . during most nights",
    "two polarimetric sequences were obtained and the un - normalised spectra were combined to produce 20 distinct observations .",
    "seven of our twenty observations were previously discussed by @xcite and we present 13 new observations here , the details of which are listed in table  [ obs_tab1 ] . in fig .",
    "[ spec_comp ] we show spectra for selected spectral regions at a few different rotational phases to highlight the variability observed in almost all spectral lines ( see sect .  [ period_sect ] for further details ) .    from each observation we extracted lsd profiles using the technique as described by @xcite .",
    "the measurements reported here differ in details from those reported by @xcite as we have adopted an updated line mask with significantly more lines , but the measurements are fully consistent within their respective uncertainties .",
    "our new mask has an average land ' e factor and average wavelength of 1.180 and 4682  versus 1.135 and 4649  from the original mask .",
    "the new mask was derived from the vienna atomic line database ( vald ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) for a @xmath18k , @xmath19 model atmosphere .",
    "only lines with intrinsic depths greater than 1 percent of the continuum were included in the line list over the full espadons spectral range ( 370 to 1050 nm ) , resulting in 1648 he and metallic lines .",
    "the line list was further reduced by removing all intrinsically broad he and h lines , all lines that are blended with these lines , in addition to all lines blended with atmospheric telluric lines .",
    "this resulted in a final list of 571 metallic lines used to extract the final lsd profiles computed on a 1.8kms@xmath10 velocity grid , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ lsd_fig ] . the detection probability for each lsd spectrum",
    "was computed according to the criteria of @xcite .",
    "each observation resulted in a definite detection ( dd ) of an excess signal in stokes  @xmath15 within the line profile ( false alarm probability ( fap ) @xmath20 ) , except for the observations obtained on the nights of 2008 - 12 - 05 and 2009 - 05 - 07 , which were non - detections ( nd ) .",
    "we calculated the longitudinal magnetic field ( @xmath21 ) and null measurements ( @xmath22 ) from each lsd profile using the first - order moment method discussed by @xcite , using an integration range between -25 and 75kms@xmath10 ( see table  [ obs_tab1 ] ) .",
    "this range was adopted to encompass the full profile range of the stokes  @xmath15 signature .",
    "the resulting @xmath21 measurements range from -170 to -350 g with a median uncertainty of 20 g ."
