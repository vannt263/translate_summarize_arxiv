    "one of the important nonlinear processes affecting pulse propagation in massive wavelength division multiplexing ( wdm ) optical fiber communication systems is due to inter - pulse raman - induced crosstalk @xcite . in this process , which takes place during collisions between pulses from different frequency channels ( interchannel collisions ) , energy is transferred from high - frequency pulses to low - frequency pulses .",
    "it is known that the magnitude of the raman - induced energy exchange in a single interchannel collision is independent of the frequency difference between the channels .",
    "consequently , the magnitude of the cumulative energy shifts for a given pulse grows with the square of the number of channels , a result that is valid for linear transmission @xcite , conventional soliton transmission @xcite , and strongly dispersion - managed ( dm ) soliton transmission @xcite .",
    "therefore , in a 100-channel system , for example , the raman crosstalk effects can be larger by a factor of @xmath1 compared with a two - channel system operating at the same bit rate per channel .",
    "early studies of raman crosstalk in wdm transmission focused on the dependence of the energy shifts on the total number of channels @xcite , as well as on the impact of energy depletion @xcite and group velocity dispersion @xcite on the dynamics . later on attention turned to the combined effects of raman crosstalk and bit - pattern randomness in the on - off - keying ( ook ) transmission scheme , and it was found that the probability density function ( pdf ) of the pulse amplitudes is lognormal @xcite .",
    "this finding means that the @xmath2th normalized moments of the amplitude grow exponentially with both propagation distance and @xmath3 .",
    "furthermore , in several studies of conventional soliton transmission it was found that the dynamics of the frequency shift is strongly coupled to amplitude dynamics , and as a result , the @xmath2th normalized moments of the raman - induced self and cross frequency shifts also grow exponentially with propagation distance and @xmath3 ( see refs .",
    "this intermittent dynamic behavior has important practical consequences , by leading to relatively high bit - error - rate ( ber ) values at intermediate and large propagation distances @xcite .",
    "raman crosstalk effects were also recently investigated in hut - skipped amplified wdm transmission @xcite , in cable television overlay passive optical networks @xcite , in optical code - division multiple - access transmission systems @xcite , and in conjunction with four - wave - mixing @xcite .",
    "one of the ways to overcome the detrimental effects of raman crosstalk on massive wdm transmission is by replacing the ook scheme by alternative encoding schemes , which are expected to be less susceptible to these effects .",
    "the differential phase shift keying ( dpsk ) scheme , in which all time slots are occupied and the information is encoded in the phase difference between adjacent pulses , is one of the promising encoding methods that have attracted much interest in recent years @xcite . in dpsk transmission the raman - induced amplitude dynamics becomes ( approximately ) deterministic , and important questions arise regarding the character of this dynamics .",
    "one major question concerns the possibility to achieve a stable equilibrium state for the amplitudes in all channels .",
    "the study reported in ref .",
    "@xcite demonstrated that this is not possible in unamplified optical fiber lines .",
    "however , later experiments showed that the situation is quite different in amplified wdm transmission @xcite .",
    "more specifically , it was found that the introduction of amplification into the system significantly reduces the raman - induced energy shifts . in the present paper",
    "we suggest a dynamical explanation for this important experimental observation .",
    "moreover , we demonstrate the robustness of dpsk transmission against inter - pulse raman crosstalk effects by showing that equilibrium states with non - zero amplitudes in all channels do exist , and by proving the stability of the equilibrium states .    in the present study we consider optical solitons as an example for the pulses carrying the information for the following reasons .",
    "first , as mentioned above , the raman - induced energy exchange in pulse collisions is similar in linear transmission , conventional soliton transmission , and strongly dm soliton transmission .",
    "second , propagation of conventional solitons through an optical fiber is described by the nonlinear schrdinger ( nls ) equation , which is an integrable model @xcite . due to the integrability of the model , and to the fact that optical solitons are stable stationary solutions of the nls equation",
    ", the derivation of the model for the raman - induced amplitude dynamics can be done in a rigorous manner .",
    "third , conventional optical solitons have traditionally been considered as excellent candidates for information transmission in high - speed optical fiber lines and in all - optical networks @xcite .",
    "furthermore , state - of - the - art transmission experiments already use all - raman distributed amplification @xcite , which is the most suitable amplification scheme for conventional solitons .    since we consider transmission systems where the pulses in each frequency channel are well - separated , intrachannel four - wave - mixing ( fwm ) effects are negligible . in addition , we assume that loss is compensated by distributed raman amplification . it is a well - known fact in soliton theory that in the absence of loss interchannel fwm products completely vanish after the collisions , see ref .",
    "@xcite for theory and refs .",
    "@xcite for numerical simulations with the nls equation with and without delayed raman response .",
    "we remark that even in systems employing lumped amplifiers ( and non - overlapping pulses ) , interchannel fwm can be significantly reduced by dispersion - management .",
    "this is true both in the soliton regime @xcite and in the linear regime @xcite .",
    "in contrast , the energy shift in a single collision between two strongly dm solitons is given by an expression with exactly the same form as the expression obtained for conventional solitons @xcite , i.e. , strong dispersion - management does not reduce raman crosstalk .    in deriving the model for raman - induced amplitude dynamics",
    "we fully take into account pulse walk - off .",
    "in addition , we assume that the pulse sequences in all frequency channels are deterministic and that the sequences are either infinitely long or are subject to periodic temporal boundary conditions .",
    "the first setup approximates long - haul transmission , while the second one corresponds to a closed fiber loop experiment .",
    "we also assume that the constant net gain / loss in each channel is determined by the difference between distributed amplifier gain and fiber loss .",
    "notice that in this feature our model is fundamentally different from the model derived in ref @xcite .",
    "indeed , since in the latter model all channels experience net loss , it does not support an equilibrium state with non - zero amplitudes in all channels .",
    "in contrast , in our model the net gain / loss of some channels is positive while for other channels it is negative , which is the underlying reason for the existence of equilibrium states with non - zero amplitudes in all channels .    our model for the raman crosstalk dynamics in an @xmath0-channel system",
    "consists of a system of @xmath0 coupled nonlinear ordinary differential equations ( odes ) for the amplitudes in different channels .",
    "the system of coupled odes can be described in the jargon of population dynamics theory as an @xmath0-dimensional predator - prey model @xcite . after obtaining the model",
    "we look for equilibrium states with non - zero amplitudes in all channels and establish their stability with respect to deviations of the initial amplitudes from the equilibrium values .",
    "we also investigate the dynamic behavior induced by such deviations . in actual optical fiber transmission systems pulse dynamics",
    "can be influenced by physical processes other than raman crosstalk .",
    "it is therefore important to understand the manner in which these additional processes perturb the raman - induced amplitude dynamics . in the present study",
    "we investigate the effects of three perturbations due to cross phase modulation ( xpm ) , raman self frequency shift ( sfs ) , and raman cross frequency shift ( xfs ) . for each of these physical processes",
    "we construct the perturbed model describing amplitude dynamics in an @xmath0-channel system and investigate the existence of equilibrium states with non - zero amplitudes in all channels .",
    "furthermore , we study the stability of the equilibrium state and the typical dynamic behavior of the amplitudes in two - channel systems in the presence of each of the three perturbations .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section [ derivation ]",
    "we derive the unperturbed model for raman - induced amplitude dynamics in wdm systems with @xmath4 channels , and in section [ stability ] we find the equilibrium states of the model and investigate their stability . in section [ simulations ]",
    "we validate the predictions of section [ stability ] by numerical simulations .",
    "the perturbed models with xpm , raman sfs , and raman xfs , are studied in sections [ xpm ] , [ sfs ] , and [ xfs ] , respectively , for two - channel systems .",
    "section [ conclusions ] is reserved for conclusions . in appendix [ appendb ]",
    "we obtain the perturbed models with xpm , raman sfs , and raman xfs in wdm transmission with @xmath4 channels .",
    "propagation of short pulses of light through an optical fiber in the presence of delayed raman response is described by the following perturbed nls equation @xcite : @xmath5 where @xmath6 is proportional to the envelope of the electric field , @xmath7 is propagation distance and @xmath8 is time in the retarded reference frame .",

    "let us describe the main raman - induced effects on a single collision between a soliton from the @xmath18th frequency channel and a soliton from the @xmath19th frequency channel .",
    "we assume that @xmath20 , which is the typical situation in many wdm transmission systems even for adjacent channels @xcite . under this assumption",
    "one can show that the most important effect of delayed raman response on the collision is an @xmath21 change in the soliton amplitude @xcite @xmath22 where the coupling constants @xmath23 depend on the specific approximation for the raman gain curve .",

    "the effects of the collision in order @xmath25 will be described in section [ perturbed ] , where we obtain the perturbed models for amplitude dynamics . since @xmath20 ,",
    "effects of order @xmath26 and higher will be neglected .",
    "in addition , third order dispersion and self - steepening are neglected since the collision - induced effects of these conservative perturbations on the soliton amplitude and frequency are of higher order in both the parameter @xmath27 characterizing the perturbative process and @xmath28 ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite ) .    consider now wdm transmission systems with @xmath4 channels and frequency difference @xmath29 between adjacent channels .",
    "our model , which takes into account pulse walk - off , is based on the following assumptions .",
    "( 1 ) the soliton sequences in all channels are deterministic in the sense that all time slots are occupied and each soliton is located at the center of a time slot of width @xmath30 . furthermore ,",
    "when considering amplitude dynamics , the amplitudes are equal for all pulses from the same frequency channel , but are not necessarily equal for pulses from different channels .",
    "this setup corresponds , for example , to return - to - zero ( rz ) transmission with differential - phase - shift - keying @xcite .",
    "( 2 ) the sequences are either ( a ) infinitely long , or ( b ) subject to periodic temporal boundary conditions .",
    "notice that setup ( a ) is an approximation for long - haul transmission systems , while setup ( b ) is an approximation for closed fiber - loop experiments .",
    "( 3 ) the gain / loss in each channel is determined by the difference between distributed amplifier gain and fiber loss .",
    "in particular , for some channels this difference can be slightly positive , resulting in small net gain , while for other channels this difference can be slightly negative , resulting in small net loss .",
    "we emphasize that in this feature our model is essentially different from the models that are usually considered in studies of raman amplification schemes , where it is assumed that _ all _ pumps experience net loss @xcite .    to obtain the dynamic equation for the amplitude of the @xmath18th - channel solitons we note that the distance traveled by these solitons while passing two successive solitons in the @xmath31 or @xmath32 channels is @xmath33 .",
    "we denote by @xmath34 the location of the @xmath35th collision of a given @xmath18th - channel soliton with solitons in the @xmath32 or @xmath31 channel . using eq .",

    "moreover , the same equations with different @xmath18 values , where @xmath40 , describe the dynamics of the soliton amplitudes in all channels . going to the continuum limit we obtain @xmath41 ,    \\label{crosstalk5}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath42 and @xmath40 .",
    "the system ( [ crosstalk5 ] ) gives a complete description of the dynamics of the @xmath43 s .",
    "notice that apart from the important fact that some gain / loss coefficients can be positive while others can be negative , the system ( [ crosstalk5 ] ) is similar to the one obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite for the raman - induced amplitude dynamics of continuous waves in unamplified wdm transmission .",
    "thus , our model also describes the raman - induced crosstalk dynamics of continuous waves in amplified wdm transmission systems .",
    "in optical fiber communication systems it is usually desired to achieve a steady state in which the pulse amplitudes in all channels are equal and constant ( independent of @xmath7 ) @xcite .",
    "we therefore look for an equilibrium state of the system ( [ crosstalk5 ] ) in the form @xmath44 for @xmath45 . setting the right hand sides of ( [ crosstalk5 ] ) equal to zero we arrive at @xmath46 therefore",

    ", the net gain / loss coefficient of high - frequency channels should be positive , while that of low - frequency channels should be negative .",
