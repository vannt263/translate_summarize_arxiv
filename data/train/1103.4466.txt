    "until now , most kohn - sham ( ks ) density functional theory ( dft ) @xcite calculations on solids have been done using either the local density approximation ( lda ) or the generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) for the exchange - correlation energy .",
    "calculations were done exclusively with lda@xcite until the early 90s , when the gga functional pw91@xcite was proposed and then implemented in computer codes for solid - state calculations .",
    "a few years later , a gga functional with a simpler analytical form than pw91 , namely pbe,@xcite but giving nearly identical results has been proposed and is nowadays the standard functional .",
    "the successes of the semilocal lda and gga approximations rely on the fact that the accuracy is usually good enough to be useful , in particular for the calculation of the geometrical parameters and other quantities like the bulk modulus or the phonon spectrum .",
    "( see , e.g. , refs . and for a compilation of lattice constants and bulk moduli calculated with various gga functionals . )",
    "however , it is known that there are classes of systems , e.g. , strongly correlated or van der waals systems , whose properties are not described properly by semilocal functionals already at the qualitative level .",
    "it is also well known that the ks band gap , defined as the conduction band minimum ( cbm ) minus the valence band maximum ( vbm ) , obtained from a semilocal functional is much smaller than the experimental band gap ( defined as the ionization potential @xmath1 minus the electron affinity @xmath2 ) .",
    "however , it is important to note that this problem , known as the _ band gap problem _ , is more general and has its roots in the ks - dft method itself , and actually the ks band gap calculated with the _ exact multiplicative _ ks potential would differ from @xmath3 by the derivative discontinuity @xmath4 of the exchange - correlation potential ( see ref . for a review ) . since @xmath4 can be of the same order as the ks band gap , the _ exact _ ks band gap can differ substantially from @xmath3 .",
    "there are several methods to obtain orbital energies which lead to values for @xmath5 comparable to @xmath3 .",
    "if one wants to stay inside the true ks framework ( i.e. , ks equations with a multiplicative potential ) , exact exchange ( exx ) calculations ( see , e.g. , refs . and ) or advanced semilocal potentials@xcite can do a good job . alternatively one can use a non - multiplicative potential , which means to use a method which lies outside the ks framework , but belongs to the so - called generalized ks framework.@xcite most of these methods mix the dft and hartree - fock ( hf ) theories and the best known are the lda+@xmath6,@xcite screened - exchange lda ( sx - lda ) , @xcite and hybrid@xcite methods .",
    "the @xmath7 method can yield very accurate band structures , in particular if it is applied self - consistently , but it is a very expensive method ( see ref . for a review ) .",
    "the lda+@xmath6 method ( see ref . for a recent review ) consists of applying an approximate ( but very cheap ) form of hf only to the electrons which are not well described by semilocal functionals .",
    "typical examples are the @xmath8 or @xmath9 electrons in strongly correlated systems ( e.g. , transition - metal and rare - earth oxides ) that are very localized and hence lead to large self - interaction error when a semilocal functional is used ( this results in too small band gaps and magnetic moments ) . in the sx - lda method , the short - range ( sr ) part of lda exchange is replaced by the sr part of hf exchange , where the sr part is defined by replacing the bare coulomb potential by the screened yukawa potential@xcite into the corresponding expressions for the energy and potential .",
    "the sx - lda method has been implemented within the pseudopotential plane - wave @xcite and linearized - augmented plane - wave @xcite basis sets , and it has been shown that sx - lda improves substantially over lda for the band gap of semiconductors and insulators .    despite the fact that reports about the implementation of the hf method in solid - state codes started to appear already in the 70s ( see , e.g. , refs . ) , it is only in the early 2000s that the first calculations on solids with hybrid methods were reported,@xcite which is much later than for molecules.@xcite in hybrid methods , a certain percentage ( between 10% and 50% ) of semilocal exchange is replaced by hf exchange , while the correlation remains purely semilocal . as for molecules ,",
    "the hybrid functionals have shown to lead to ( much ) better results than semilocal functionals for various types of materials and properties .",
    "in particular , they lead to band structures which are usually in good agreement with experiment as shown for classical semiconductors and insulators ( see , e.g. , refs . ) and strongly correlated materials ( see , e.g. , refs . ) .",
    "the most common hybrid functionals are b3lyp @xcite and pbe0 @xcite which contain 20% and 25% of hf exchange , respectively . however , for solids the long - range ( lr ) nature of hf exchange leads to technical difficulties . for calculations done in real space ,",
    "the results converge very slowly with respect to the number of neighboring unit cells that are taken into account for the calculation of hf exchange , while for calculations done in reciprocal space , the slow convergence is with respect to the number of @xmath10-points for the integrations in the brillouin zone .    to reduce this problem of slow convergence , heyd _",
    "et al_. ( hse ) @xcite proposed to consider only the sr part of hf exchange ( as done in sx - lda ) , and therefore to keep 100% of semilocal lr exchange .",
    "this was done by splitting the coulomb operator into sr and lr components by using the error function.@xcite since then , it has been shown that the hse functional , which is based on pbe0 , leads to very good results for semiconductors and insulators @xcite including strongly correlated systems , @xcite and several recent papers reporting the implementation of hse have appeared .",
    "@xcite we also mention the onsite version of hf exchange proposed by novk _",
    "et al_. , @xcite which leads to very cheap calculations , but can be applied only to localized electrons .",
    "this method has been used in the context of hybrid calculations .",
    "@xcite    in the present work , we report the implementation of screened hybrid functionals into the wien2k code,@xcite which is based on the full - potential linearized augmented plane - wave plus local orbitals method ( abbreviated as lapw in the following ) @xcite to solve the ks equations . as done for the sx - lda functional,@xcite the hf exchange is screened by means of the yukawa potential in order to eliminate the lr hf exchange .",

    "the implementation of unscreened and screened hybrid functionals into the wien2k code , which is based on the lapw basis set , has been presented .",
    "the screening is based on the yukawa potential for which the expansion in spherical harmonics has a simple expression .",
    "also , it was possible to calculate analytically all integrals which were necessary for the derivation of the various formulas for the pseudocharge method . in order to check the validity of the implementation ,",
    "first , test calculations were done on systems which do not contain core electrons , such that the total hartree - fock energy could be compared with benchmark results from the literature . as a further test of the implementation , the band gap and lattice constant of several solids",
    "have been calculated with the hybrid functionals pbe0 and ys - pbe0 which are based on the gga functional pbe .",
    "the results are in very good agreement with the results obtained by other codes .",
    "noticeably , for the screened hybrid functional ys - pbe0 , it was possible to find a value of the screening parameter @xmath40 such that the results are very close to the results of hse06 , whose screening is based on the error function .",
    "finally , we applied the hybrid functionals to the semiconductor cu@xmath0o .",
    "the results obtained with the unscreened pbe0 and screened ys - pbe0 for the band gap and efg are much more accurate than the results obtained with semilocal and lda+@xmath6 functionals .",

    "@xmath175 is the continuation inside the spheres of the plane waves ( pw ) representation of the charge density and @xmath176 is zero in the interstitial region .",
    "such a scheme is possible since the potential in the interstitial region created by the charge inside the spheres depends only on the multipole moments @xmath177 which are defined as follows for the unscreened [ eq . ( [ vc ] ) ] and screened [ eq . ( [ vcs ] ) ]",
