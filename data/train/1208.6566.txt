    "heavy quarkonium states , such as the @xmath1 , are expected to provide essential information on the properties of high - energy heavy - ion collisions where the formation of a quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) is expected .",
    "the impact on the @xmath1 production of such a hot and dense medium formed in the early times of the collision has been extensively studied at sps and rhic energies .",
    "it is expected that due to colour screening mechanisms @xmath1 production is suppressed in a plasma of quarks and gluons  @xcite and thus provides a unique probe for qgp formation .",
    "@xmath1 suppression , however , is also induced by other effects that have to be taken into account , such as nuclear shadowing , cold nuclear matter effects and comover absorption scenarios . at lhc energies charm is produced abundantly in central pb ",
    "pb collisions and scenarios where originally uncorrelated charm and anti - charm quarks ( re)combine gain importance . such scenarios are described in several statistical and transport models ( e.g.  @xcite ) . measuring the @xmath1 production at lhc will help to disentangle between the different mechanisms .",
    "alice  @xcite measures the @xmath1 production at mid - rapidity ( @xmath5 ) in the di - electron channel , as well as at forward rapidity ( @xmath2 ) in the di - muon decay channel .",
    "the di - electron analysis is based on a dataset of pb  pb collisions at @xmath6tev , taken with a minimum bias trigger in 2010 . in total 12.8 m ( 0 - 80% most central ) events",
    "were analysed corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 2.1@xmath7 .",

    "the opposite sign spectrum of the same event ( black ) is displayed together with the background distribution obtained from event mixing ( red ) .",
    "the background distribution is scaled to match the integral of the signal distribution in an invariant mass range between 3.2 and 4gev/@xmath9 .",
    "the bottom panel shows the background subtracted distribution .",
    "signal extraction is performed by integrating the signal counts in an invariant mass range of 2.92 - 3.16gev/@xmath9 . in total",
    "about 2000 @xmath1 are available for the analysis .",
    "this statistics allowed a signal extraction in three centrality intervals . in case of the di - muon analysis",
    "a dataset at the same collision energy , measured in 2011 , was analysed .",
    "a dedicated di - muon trigger allowed for recording 70@xmath7 of integrated luminosity , corresponding to 17.7 m triggered events .",
    "this corresponds to a factor 20 higher statistics than previously reported  @xcite .",
    "fig.[fig1 ] ( right ) shows the invariant mass spectrum of @xmath10 candidates for 0 - 90% most central events .",
    "the signal is extracted by performing a combined fit for the background and signal contribution .",
    "the background is described by a gaussian with a width ( @xmath11 ) which varies as a function of the mass value . for the signal description",
    "a modified crystal ball function was used which is a convolution of a gaussian and power law functions that can fit the tails of the measured signal . in total about 40k @xmath1 have been found .",
    "this statistics allows for a differential analysis of the nuclear modification factor in either nine bins of centrality , seven bins in transverse momentum or six bins in rapidity .",
    "the raw yield has been corrected for acceptance and efficiency .",
    "for the di - electron analysis hijing simulations enriched with primary @xmath1 were used . in case of the di - muon analysis monte carlo ( mc )",
    "@xmath1 were embedded into real pb ",
    "pb events . for the primary @xmath1 sample in both cases",
    "a parametrisation was used for the transverse momentum and rapidity shape , obtained from an interpolation of rhic , fermilab and lhc data  @xcite .",
    "in addition the effects of shadowing were taken into account using eks98 calculations  @xcite .",
    "the polarisation of the simulated @xmath1 was assumed to be zero .",
    "first measurements of the @xmath1 polarisation in pp collisions at @xmath12tev  @xcite ( @xmath13 , @xmath14gev/@xmath15 ) , show results compatible with zero .    in both cases",

    "the nuclear modification factor @xmath16 is defined as : @xmath17 where the @xmath1 yield , @xmath18 , is the number of @xmath1 ( @xmath19 ) corrected for acceptance times efficiency ( @xmath20 ) , the branching ratio ( @xmath21 ) and normalised to the number of analysed minimum bias interactions @xmath22 .",
    "@xmath23 is the nuclear overlap function , obtained from a glauber mc , @xmath24 is the @xmath1 production cross - section in pp collisions at the same centre of mass energy per nucleon pair , which was measured by alice  @xcite .     as a function of the average number of participant nucleons at mid- ( blue ) and forward ( red ) rapidity.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]",

    "the error bars correspond to the statistical uncertainties , the boxes to the uncorrelated systematic uncertainties of the pb ",

    "the main contribution to the systematic uncertainty in case of the di - electron channel results from the imperfections of the description of the combinatorial background .",

    "@xmath23 carries the main uncertainty , followed by the signal extraction and the trigger and tracking efficiency .",
    "global systematic uncertainties are quoted in the figure legend : 26% for the di - electron and 14% for the di - muon channel , where the main contribution is due to the respective pp reference .",
    "it has to be remarked that the uncertainties in the di - electron measurement are rather large , due to the low statistics that was available for the analysis .",
