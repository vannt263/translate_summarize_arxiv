    "it is widely accepted that the electronic properties of the cuprates are well described by the three - band hubbard model @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "zhang and rice @xcite suggested that this model can be reduced to an effective one - band @xmath11 model under certain simplifying hypothesis : small o - cu hopping @xmath12 and zero on - site o coulomb repulsion @xmath13 , cu - o coulomb nearest - neighbor interatomic repulsion @xmath0 and o - o hopping @xmath14 .",
    "while the one - band effective models can explain the magnetic properties of high-@xmath15 materials and can provide magnetic mechanisms for superconductivity @xcite , these models , with fixed parameters , do not take into account the effects of the cu - o repulsion @xmath0 .",
    "the density of carriers in cuprate superconductors is very low .",
    "the average distance between two holes is larger than 7   and the cu - o distance is @xmath16 1.9   and therefore @xmath0 is expected to be poorly screened . neglecting screening @xmath17 ev ,",
    "while direct calculations give @xmath18 ev @xcite and constrained - density - functional results predict @xmath19 ev @xcite .",
    "thus , as pointed out early after the discovery of high-@xmath15 superconductivity , the effects of @xmath0 can be important @xcite .",
    "these effects include a charge - transfer mechanism for superconductivity @xcite , and marginal -fermi - liquid behavior @xcite .",
    "it is known that a sufficiently large @xmath0 induces a charge - transfer instability ( cti ) and a valence instability ( vi ) related with cu - o charge transfer @xcite .",
    "these instabilities are associated with phase separation because of the coupling between the fluctuations of the valence and the total density @xcite .    the three - band hubbard model including @xmath0 has been studied by exact diagonalization of small clusters @xcite , random - phase approximation @xcite , gutzwiller variational wave function @xcite , and slave - bosons with 1/n expansion , for the particular case @xmath20 and with @xmath13 and @xmath0 treated in the hartree approximation @xcite .",
    "the results of these works are qualitatively similar in general . increasing @xmath0 the system reaches the cti , vi and the related phase separation . near the phase - separation boundary",
    ", the effective interaction in the cooper _ s _ and _ d _ channels becomes attractive .",
    "bang _ et al .",
    "_ in weak coupling @xcite and raimondi _",
    "et al_. in strong coupling @xcite have shown that even though the energy @xmath21 of the charge - transfer collective excitonic mode at zero wave vector , decreases with increasing @xmath0 , it remains finite at the cti . however , this mode is coupled to the zero - sound mode , leading to a charge - transfer - mode mediated attraction which allows the violation of the landau stability criterion @xmath22 .",
    "this leads to the simultaneous divergence of the compressibility and charge - transfer static susceptibility indicating that phase separation and the cti take place .    in spite of the qualitative agreement on the facts mentioned above among the different techniques , the regions of phase separation differ in the strong and weak coupling approaches , and the critical value of @xmath0 where the instabilities take place depends strongly on the approximation used",
    "also , the effect of the variation of the parameters has not been investigated in detail and realistic values of @xmath9 have not been studied so far .",
    "thus , further research on these subjects seems necessary .    on the other hand , it is important to address the question of to what extent the above mentioned properties of the three - band hubbard model can be accounted for using a one - band effective model derived from the former through a sufficiently accurate mapping procedure .",
    "generalized @xmath11 and one - band hubbard models have been obtained performing systematic low - energy reductions of the three - band hubbard @xcite .",
    "these reductions either are based on a cell method @xcite or use an effective spin - fermion model with renormalized parameters as an intermediate step in the derivation @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the original derivation of zhang and rice , these methods allow to extend the mapping procedure to realistic and large values of cu - o hopping @xmath23 , and show that the zhang - rice singlets are stable for large cu - o covalency .",
    "there have been an important amount of research devoted to the study of the validity of the low - energy reduction and the stability of the zhang - rice singlets . in particular , the roles of local triplets states @xcite and apical o ions @xcite have been recently investigated .",
    "exact diagonalization of small clusters have shown that the low - energy spectrum @xcite and magnetic properties @xcite of the three - band model can be well reproduced by a @xmath24 model , where @xmath25 is the next - nearest - neighbor hopping and @xmath26 is a next - nearest - neighbor hopping combined with a nearest - neighbor spin flip .",
    "this three - body term , with the sign corresponding to large o - o hopping @xmath27 in the original three - band model , can stabilize a resonance - valence - bond superconducting ground state @xcite .",
    "in this paper , starting from the three - band hubbard model , we derive an effective generalized one - band hubbard model , using the cell method generalized to take into account properly the intercell part of the o intratomic repulsion @xmath13 and the cu - o interatomic repulsion @xmath0 . as a consequence of these interactions ,",
    "the parameters of the effective model become dependent on the particle density .",
    "solving the effective one - band model exactly in a @xmath28 cluster , and also in the slave - boson mean - field theory of kotliar and ruckenstein @xcite we study the above mentioned valence instability ( vi ) , the regions of phase separation ( ps ) , and also the dependence of the effective one - band parameters with @xmath0 and doping .",
    "the advantage of our approach in comparison with other methods discussed above for the study of the vi , cti and ps , is that the intracell correlations , including cu on - site repulsion @xmath9 and a large part of the @xmath0 and @xmath13 terms , are taken into account exactly at each cell .",
    "this allows us in particular to take realistic values of @xmath9 ( @xmath29 ev ) , while in previous treatments @xmath9 was either small or infinite .    in section",
    "ii we describe the different hamiltonians and the method for low - energy reduction .",
    "section iii contains the results and section iv is a short summary and discussion .",
    "we start from the three - band extended hubbard model : @xmath30 the sum over @xmath31 ( @xmath32 ) runs over all cu ( o ) ions .",
    "the vector @xmath33 ( @xmath34 ) connects a cu ( o ) site with one of its four nearest o atoms .",

    "the phases of half of the orbitals have been changed in such a way that for all directions , the hoppings are positive ( @xmath23 , @xmath40 ) .",
    "the parameters of the model are known approximately from constrained - density - functional calculations @xcite .",
    "the first step in the cell method @xcite is to change the basis of the o orbitals to linear combinations which hybridize ( @xmath41 ) and do not hybridize ( @xmath42 ) with @xmath43 orbitals , due to the term in @xmath23 at each point * k * of the reciprocal space .",
    "we denote the wannier functions of these orbitals as @xmath44 and @xmath45 respectively .",
    "the @xmath46 ( _ non - bonding _ states ) lie very high in energy and are neglected . after the change of basis , the original hamiltonian can be separated in two parts , one containing the intracell ( and generally larger ) terms and another containing the intercell terms : @xmath47 with @xmath48   \\nonumber \\\\ & & + u_{pd}\\sum_{i\\neq jl\\sigma \\sigma ^{\\prime } } [ f(i - j , i - l)n_{i\\sigma ^{\\prime } } ^d\\alpha _ { j\\sigma } ^{\\dagger } \\alpha _ { l\\sigma } + h.c . ]   \\nonumber \\\\ & & + u_p\\sum_{ijlm}^{\\prime } h(i - j , i - l , i - m)\\alpha _ { i\\uparrow } ^{\\dagger } \\alpha _ { m\\uparrow } \\alpha _ { j\\downarrow } ^{\\dagger } \\alpha _ { l\\downarrow } \\label{inter}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the functions of the lattice vectors @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 and @xmath53 are given in ref .",

    "the @xmath55 indicates that in the last sum the term with @xmath56 is excluded .",
    "the ordinary cell method consists in solving @xmath57 exactly in the subspaces of 0 , 1 and 2 particles and retaining the ground state in each subspace .",
    "the non trivial retained eigenstates have the form :    @xmath58    @xmath59    the energies of these states will be denoted @xmath60 and @xmath61 respectively .",
    "the first term of @xmath62 corresponds to the zhang - rice singlet in the original derivation @xcite .",
    "our modification consists in considering the coefficients as variational parameters which are determined minimizing the total energy .",
    "we treat the terms in @xmath0 of @xmath63 with @xmath64 replacing @xmath65 by its expectation value . using the fact that @xmath66 , this is equivalent to the treatment of ref .",

    "the same treatment is done for @xmath70 and @xmath71 .",
    "the remaining terms except those with @xmath67 and @xmath71 were neglected .",
    "the intercell hamiltonian is written as a function of the retained eigenstates of @xmath57 , and mapping the latter into those of the one - band hubbard model at site @xmath31 , one obtains the following effective model : @xmath72+t_{bb}n_{i,-\\sigma } n_{j,-\\sigma } + h.c .",

    "we begin this section by studying the parameters of the one - band effective model and its dependence with the original parameters and doping . as a basis for our study",
    "we take the parameters of the original three - band hubbard model determined from constrained - density - functional approximation @xcite .",
    "we take the unit of energy as @xmath74 ev .",

    "@xmath75 the intercell interactions vanish ( @xmath76 ) and the variational parameters @xmath77 , @xmath78 ( eqs . [ para1 ] and [ para2 ] ) which minimize the total energy correspond to the eigenstates of the cell hamiltonian @xmath57 ( eq . [ cell ] ) for all dopings .",
    "thus the effective one - band parameters are independent of doping .",

    ", @xmath80 decreases with doping for small values of @xmath83 this reflects a _ metallization _ of the system with a larger amount of cu - o covalency which should be reflected in an increase of the conductivity .",
    "this might be related to the sudden increase in the hall conductivity observed in la@xmath84sr@xmath85cuo@xmath86 for @xmath87 @xcite . as a consequence of the larger amount of o holes in the doubly occupied cells , and the change in the variational parameters @xmath78 ( eq . [ para2 ] ) to minimize the loss of energy due to the cu - o repulsion @xmath88 the energy @xmath61 and the amount of o holes in the singly - occupied cells increase with doping for small @xmath81 and large @xmath0 . for others values of @xmath81 and @xmath0",

    ", the effective repulsions do not change very much because the decrease ( increase ) in cu - o repulsion is approximately compensated by the increase ( decrease ) in o - o repulsion .    in figs . 5 and 6 we show the dependence of the expectation value @xmath91 @xmath92 on @xmath81 .",
    "as expected , @xmath93 increases with @xmath81 . for small @xmath0",
    "the results obtained by exact diagonalization ( ed ) and slave bosons ( sb ) are qualitatively similar , although there are quantitative differences of the order of 20% for larger dopings . for larger values of @xmath0",
    "there are some important qualitative differences between both methods which are discussed below , however both methods coincide in that for intermediate and small values of @xmath81 , @xmath93 _ decreases _ with doping as a consequence of cu - o charge transfer which overcompensates the effect of doping ( see figs . 6 and 7 ) .",
    "this is related with the increase in cu - o covalency and the _ metallization _ mentioned before .",
    "in contrast , for large values of @xmath94 @xmath93 _ increases _ faster with doping than for small values of @xmath0 . as a consequence of these opposite effects of @xmath0 for small and large @xmath81 ,",
    "the dependence of @xmath93 with @xmath81 becomes more abrupt for large @xmath88 eventually driving the valence instability ( vi ) .",

    "@xmath98 differs from the charge - transfer susceptibility @xmath99 because the latter is defined at constant chemical potential instead of at constant @xmath96 .",
    "the valence susceptibility @xmath100 is shown in fig",

    ", there is a critical value of @xmath0 ( @xmath102 ) for which @xmath98 diverges at a critical value of @xmath81 ( @xmath103 ) , indicating the presence of a vi .",
    "for @xmath104 there is a discontinuous transition as shown for example in fig . 6 for @xmath105 .",
    "the minimum possible value of @xmath106 occurs for maximum doping ( @xmath107 ) . the critical value @xmath108 increases with decreasing @xmath109 .",
    "note that @xmath102 found with sb is always lower than that found with ed .",
    "also , at @xmath110 the sb approximation gives an artificially large @xmath98 at the metal - insulator transition due to the vanishing of the double occupancy ( @xmath111 ) in the insulating phase and the exaggerated large increase of @xmath111 with @xmath112 in the metallic phase near the metal - insulator boundary . within the ed",
    ", @xmath111 grows smoothly with @xmath112 in absence of the vi as one expects .    in fig .",
    "9 we show the phase - separation diagram calculated with the sb approximation . contrary to previous strong - coupling mean - field approximations , where always one of the phases between which phase separation takes place has @xmath110 @xcite , we obtain , in qualitative agreement with weak - coupling approximations @xcite that phase separation takes place between a phase with large doping @xmath107 and another one with @xmath113depending of the parameters .",
    "as expected , the region of phase separation grows with increasing @xmath0 .",
    "at least for @xmath114 ( _ i.e. _ for parameters near those obtained by constrained - density - functional approximation @xcite ) there is no phase separation .",
    "the effect of decreasing @xmath9 on phase separation is to suppress it for large values of @xmath81 .",
    "this is related with the change of the character of the local singlet @xmath62 ( eq . [ para1 ] ) from mainly cu - o or o - o to a doubly occupied cu orbital . for low values of @xmath115 ,",
    "the phase diagram is rather independent of @xmath116 also , the effects of @xmath0 and @xmath9 on the phase diagram on a qualitative level can be understood on general physical grounds : increasing these repulsions favors localization , inhibits the kinetic energy terms , and as a result the dependence of the energy on occupation is more flat , favoring phase separation .",
    "although using ed we have only a few possible different densities , due to the small size of the cluster , the results for the compressibility at these densities agree qualitatively with the sb  phase separation diagram .",
    "however there are some important differences in a quantitative level : a ) there is no phase separation for @xmath117 .",
    "b ) for @xmath118 there is a small island inside which the system phase separates in two phases , both with compositions inside the interval @xmath119 . some of these features can be seen in fig .",
    "10 , where we show the chemical potential @xmath50 as a function of doping . in table",
    "i we list the densities for which the compressibility is negative ( a sufficient but not necessary condition for phase separation ) according to our ed results for different parameters .",
    "in this work , we have studied the effects of cu - o coulomb repulsion @xmath0 on valence instabilities and phase separation . using a variational form of the cell method",
    ", we derive a one - band effective model with doping dependent parameters .",
    "this model has the form of a generalized hubbard with correlated hoppings and nearest - neighbor repulsions .",
    "this approach allows us to study realistic values of the on - site cu repulsion @xmath120 ev and is accurate enough for moderate values of @xmath0 and on - site o repulsion @xmath13 .",
    "we obtain that for parameters near those derived using constrained - density - functional approximation @xcite , in particular @xmath121 ev , the low- energy physics of the three - band hubbard model can be well represented by the effective one - band model , with doping independent parameters .",
    "the effect of @xmath0 is merely to renormalize the effective parameters and there are neither valence instabilities nor phase separation .    for larger @xmath0",
    "the effective parameters become strongly doping dependent and for @xmath122 ev valence instabilities and phase separation appear . in agreement with previous weak - coupling results @xcite",
    ", we obtain that phase separation starts to occur for large doping values ( @xmath123 according to the exact - diagonalization results or @xmath124 according to the slave - boson ones ) .",
    "the valence instability begins at @xmath107 in both treatments .",
    "this facts are in contrast to results of alternative previous strong - coupling approaches @xcite .",
    "this is probably due to the facts that on the one hand , the slave - boson approximation produces an artificial increase of @xmath98 at the metal - insulator transition ( @xmath110 ) , as discussed in section iii , favoring ps at low @xmath109 . on the other hand in refs .",
    "@xcite , the @xmath8 and @xmath13 terms were taken in a mean - field approximation , essentially equivalent to hartree - fock , ( and since @xmath9 is large , this induces an artificially large increase of the energy with doping ) , while in our present treatment most of the @xmath0 term and a large part of the @xmath13 one are treated exactly .",
    "in fact , we have verified that treating both terms in hartree - fock before performing the low - energy reduction to the one - band model ( as was done in previous studies of the metal - insulator transition @xcite ) , the results become qualitatively similar to those of refs .",
