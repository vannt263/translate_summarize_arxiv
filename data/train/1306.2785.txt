    "silicon nanocrystals ( si - ncs ) have attracted a lot of interest in the latest years , due to their large applicability .",
    "to date si - ncs have been employed in several fields like nanophotonics,@xcite photovoltaics,@xcite thermoelectrics,@xcite medical screening,@xcite and others .",
    "one of the most challenging aspect of si - ncs concerns the high sensitivity of the measured response to the precise structural configuration of the nc and of its surrounding environment .",
    "in fact , size , shape , interface , defects , impurities , embedding medium , and cristallinity level , among others , constitute a set of mutually - dependent parameters that drastically determine the opto - electronic properties of the ncs .",
    "many theoretical and experimental works have contributed to characterize the connection between the above parameters and the observed nc response . while the theoretical approach is more suitable to deal with single ncs , especially when making use of simulations at the atomistic ( _ ab - initio _ ) level , experiments usually make use of samples containing a large number of different ncs , making the identification of the most active configurations a non trivial task . therefore , despite the tremendous advances of the latest years , a direct comparison between theoretical simulations and experimental observations is still a complicated task . +",
    "in the present work we try to fill up the gap by extending the theoretical calculations performed on individual ncs to realistic ensembles made by a large number of ncs , in order to provide a connection with the experimental data . following the superposition principle we aim at evaluating the optical absorption / emission of an ensemble of ncs as the sum of the absorptions / emissions of the individual ncs .",
    "the main approximation regards the absence of nc - nc interaction mechanisms , that for h- or oh - terminated ncs , or for embedded si / sio@xmath0 ncs implies nc - nc distances larger than about 0.5nm.@xcite the latter conditions can be satisfied in real embedded or freestanding nc samples by varying the silicon excess or the nc concentration , respectively . + it is worth to note that embedded systems present strained bonds at the interface region , of magnitude proportional to the difference between the lattice spacing of si and that of the embedding medium .",
    "such strain has been recognized as a crucial factor , strongly concurring with others in the determination of the nc properties .",
    "in particular , red - shifts of as much as @xmath11ev have been calculated in the absorption spectrum of si - ncs embedded in a sio@xmath0 matrix w.r.t .",
    "their freestanding counterparts,@xcite while photoluminescence ( pl ) experiments report red - shifts up to 0.2ev.@xcite clearly , an accurate description of an ensemble of embedded ncs can not ignore the influence of the matrix - induced strain .",
    "for this reason the results presented in this work should only indirectly be interpreted in terms of embedded ncs . in principle , a connection of strain with other nc parameters is possible , as already tempted in ref .  , and could easily be applied to the present method with the purpose of describing ensembles of embedded ncs .",
    "structural , electronic and optical properties have been obtained by full _",
    "ab - initio _ calculations in the framework of density functional theory ( dft ) using the espresso package.@xcite calculations have been performed using norm - conserving pseudopotentials within the local - density approximation ( lda ) .",
    "an energy cutoff of 60 ry on the plane - wave basis set has been considered .",
    "the optical properties have been calculated within the random - phase approximation ( rpa ) using dipole matrix elements .",
    "+ the ncs have been generated starting from a betacristobalite - sio@xmath0 matrix , by removing all the oxygen atoms inside a sphere whose radius determines the nc size .",
    "the so - obtained si - nc , embedded in the sio@xmath0 , presents perfectly coordinated atoms and the same si - si distance of betacristobalite , corresponding to about 3.2 .",
    "the ncs have been de - embedded by removing all the external si / o atoms , while keeping the first shell of o atoms forming the interface .",
    "finally , each interface oxygen has been passivated by an hydrogen atom .",
    "the resulting si - ncs are oh - terminated , with a number of oh groups variable and dependent on the size of the spherical cutoff . in particular ,",
    "the ratio of the number of oxygen by the number of si atoms to which they are connected can vary from 1 to 3 , and is named here the _ oxidation degree _ , @xmath2.@xcite after the ionic relaxation the si - si bond length approached the bulk value of 2.34 , while the si - o - h bonds formed angles of about 115@xmath3 .",
    "examples of so - obtained ncs are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig.structures]a .",
    "in addition to the oh - terminated ncs we have produced a set of h - terminated ncs by replacing the oh groups with hydrogens and then re - relaxing the structures ( fig .",
    "[ fig.structures]b ) . following the procedure outlined above we have generated the following set of ncs : si@xmath4(oh)@xmath5 , si@xmath6(oh)@xmath7 , si@xmath8(oh)@xmath5 , si@xmath9(oh)@xmath10 , si@xmath11(oh)@xmath5 , si@xmath12(oh)@xmath13 , si@xmath14(oh)@xmath15 , si@xmath16(oh)@xmath17 , si@xmath18(oh)@xmath19 , si@xmath20(oh)@xmath17 , si@xmath21(oh)@xmath22 .",

    "are reported in fig .",
    "[ fig.distributions ] . clearly , by varying the silicon layer thickness and the annealing conditions it is possible to obtain samples with distributions of different mean and variance . in the case of freestanding ncs",
    "it is possible to obtain narrower distributions by using filters that determine the si - nc diameter.@xcite    when not specified , we assume ev and nm the default units of energy and distance , respectively .",
    "in this section we aim at describing the absorption spectrum ( here represented by the imaginary part of the dielectric function ) of the ensemble by summing the individual nc spectra with weights given by eq.[eq.logdistrib ] .",
    "+ first , the dft - rpa complex dielectric function of the ncs , @xmath33 , have been calculated for all the relaxed structures . in doing that",
    ", we have omitted the vacuum states , i.e. the conduction states of energy equal or above the vacuum energy @xmath34 .",
    "an estimate of @xmath34 can be calculated by properly aligning the eigenvalues after applying the makov - payne correction to the total energy.@xcite in alternative , the vacuum states are identifyable by an inverse - participation - ratio ( ipr)@xcite value well - below a certain threshold . for each system , we have evaluated @xmath33 removing the vacuum states by a crosscheck of both the above methods .",
    "+ second , we must consider that the calculated absorption is normalized over the volume of the simulation cell .",
    "therefore , by means of effective - medium approximation ( ema ) we have retrieved the nc - related dielectric function @xmath35 from the calculated one : @xmath36 where the so - called _ filling factor _ , @xmath37 ,",
    "is given by the ratio of the nc volume and the simulation cell volume @xmath38 given the spherical shape of the nc ( by construction ) , we may simply relate the nc volume to its diameter @xmath39 by : @xmath40 the problem of correctly define @xmath39 is not trivial , especially for small ncs , and requires some discussion . in a previous work@xcite",
    "we have demonstrated that the dielectric function of the si / sio@xmath0 embedded system @xmath41 is separable through the ema into @xmath35 and the dielectric function of the hosting dielectric matrix @xmath42 . from such calculation",
    "we revealed that the true inclusion is not formed by the sole nc but by the nc+interface system .",
    "similarly to eq .",
    "[ eq.cellvacuum ] , the separation of the dielectric function was possible provided that a correct filling factor was introduced into the calculation .",
    "therefore , by using the ema it is possible to calculate an `` effective '' @xmath39 for a set of embedded ncs .",
    "following this picture we have verified that the relationship @xmath43 returns the correct filling factor when @xmath44 corresponds to the atomic density of bulk silicon , @xmath44=@xmath45@xmath46@xmath47 , and @xmath48 corresponds to the total number of atoms in the nc ( si+o+h ) . +",

    "[ eq.filling-factor]-[eq.d(rho ) ] .",
    "+ note that the diameter resulting from eq .",
    "[ eq.d(rho ) ] is larger than the maximum distance between two atoms belonging to the same nc , widely used in literature to represent the nc diameter .",

    "while previous many - body calculations on si - ncs have shown that self - energy corrections and electron - hole coulombic corrections nearly cancel out each other@xcite yielding fundamental gaps and absorption spectra close to the independent - particle calculated ones , the effect of lf has been reported to severely modify the absorption profile , as for embedded like as for freestanding ncs of every size.@xcite unfortunately , the ab - initio calculation of the full dielectric response requires a computational effort that increases dramatically with the system size , setting a strong limit on the maximum processable nc @xmath39 .",

    "<S> * we report on the possibility of describing the absorption and emission characteristics of an ensemble of silicon nanocrystals ( ncs ) with realistic distributions in the nc size , by the sum of the reponses of the single ncs . </S>",
    "<S> the individual nc responses are evaluated by means of _ ab initio _ theoretical calculations and the summation is performed by taking into account the trend of the optical properties as a function of nc size and oxidation degree . </S>",
    "<S> the comparison with experimental results shows a nice matching of the spectra , also without any tuning of the parameters . </S>",
    "<S> finally , the possibility of adapting the model in order to reproduce the experimental data is explored and discussed . * </S>"
