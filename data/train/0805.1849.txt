    "* ) . only in some short orbital period systems ,",
    "the early type star , often a supergiant , fills its roche lobe and leads to mass transfer through roche lobe overflow @xcite .",
    "persistent hmxbs accrete all the time and in most cases display x - ray luminosities in the 10@xmath2 - 10@xmath3  erg  s@xmath4 range .",
    "many hmxbs are transient systems that remain at low x - ray luminosity levels ( 10@xmath5 - 10@xmath6  erg  s@xmath4 ) most of the time and undergo outbursts lasting from weeks to months . during these outbursts they display nearly identical properties to those of persistent hmxbs .",
    "transient systems usually comprise a be star donor and relatively long , moderately eccentric orbits , such that the star sits deep in its roche lobe and stellar wind capture is the only mechanism through which mass transfer takes place .",
    "the occurrence of the outbursts is likely associated to variations in the stellar wind of the be star , such as shell ejection episodes , or build up of matter around the resonant orbits in the slow equatorial wind component @xcite .",
    "however , there are characteristics of the outbursts that are difficult to interpret if accretion onto the neutron star surface takes place unimpeded also in quiescence ; these are ( a ) the large outburst to quiescence x - ray luminosity swing ( factor of @xmath010@xmath7 or larger ) and ( b ) the presence in a given source of low - luminosity ( type i ) outbursts recurring close to periastron and , at different times , of high - luminosity ( type ii ) outbursts that last for several orbital cycles and display little ( if any ) x - ray flux variations associated to the orbital phase .",
    "these characteristics of be transients can be explained if the accretion rate ( and thus x - ray luminosity ) variations that are produced by the stellar wind alone , could be amplified by some `` gating '' mechanism .",
    "since most be star hmxb transients contain relatively fast spinning x - ray pulsars , such mechanism has been identified with the centrifugal barrier that results from the rotation of the neutron star magnetosphere @xcite .",
    "about 10 transient systems have been recently discovered , which display sporadic outbursts lasting from minutes to hours ( i.e. much shorter than be star transients ) and reach peak luminosities of @xmath010@xmath8 - 10@xmath9  erg  s@xmath4 .",
    "these systems spend long time intervals in quiescence , with x - ray luminosities down to @xmath010@xmath10 times lower than those in outburst ; in spite of their association with ob supergiant companions , their behaviour is thus at variance with other persistent and transient hmxbs .",

    "if accretion onto the collapsed object of sfxts takes place both in quiescence and outburst , then the corresponding x - ray luminosity swing , typically a factor of @xmath010@xmath11 - 10@xmath12 , would require wind inhomogeneities with a very large density and/or velocity contrast ( according to the standard wind accretion , the mass capture rate onto the ns scales like @xmath13v@xmath14 , with @xmath13 , the mass loss rate and v@xmath14 , the wind velocity of the supergiant star , * ? ? ?",
    "several authors @xcite suggested the presence of dense clumps in the wind of the ob companions in order to attain the luminosity variations of sfxts .",
    "while some observations provide evidence for a clumpy wind , the characteristics of such inhomogeneities are still poorly known .",
    "numerical simulations suggest that clumps may originate from small scale perturbations in the radiation - driven wind @xcite .",
    "models involving accretion of clumps are still being actively pursued @xcite .",
    "the requirement on the density and/or velocity contrasts in the wind can be eased if there is a barrier that remains closed during quiescence , halting most of the accretion flow , and opens up in outbursts , leading to direct accretion ( this is similar to the case of be star transients ) .",

    "sec : model ] after reviewing the theory of wind accretion in hmxbs , we describe the different regimes of a rotating magnetic neutron star immersed the stellar wind from its companion . in   [ sec : trans ] we discuss the conditions under which transitions across regimes can take place in response to variations in the wind parameters . as compared to previous works addressing gating mechanisms in transient accreting magnetic neutron stars ( notably * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , we present here a more comprehensive treatment of the different physical processes that have been discussed in this context .",
    "in   [ sec : results ] , we present an application to the different states of two sfxts and discuss in turn the possibility that the outbursts are driven by a centrifugal or a magnetic barrier .",
    "the latter mechanism involves a magnetosphere extending beyond the accretion radius @xcite , which prevents most of the inflowing matter from accreting ; it is discussed here for the first time in relation to the activity of transient binary sources . unless the stellar wind were extremely clumpy ( as envisaged in other sfxt models )",

    "therefore , very long spin period sfxts might provide the first opportunity to study transitions across such a magnetic barrier .",
    "irrespective of whether the centrifugal or magnetic barrier operates in ,   a long spin period would imply a high magnetic field , comparable to those inferred for magnetar candidates .    scenarios involving magnetars with spin periods well above 1000  s have been considered in several studies @xcite .",
    "moreover a few known accreting x - ray pulsars with unusually long spin periods have already been proposed as magnetar candidates ( see e.g. , * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "however these sources display different properties from sfxts : some are persistent sources ; others display week to month - long outbursts ; the high spin up measured in  testifies that the accretion flow is likely mediated by a disk @xcite .",
    "therefore some of the features of the model discussed in this paper would not be applicable to these sources .    in the context of wind - fed hmxbs , @xcite pointed out that magnetars might be hosted in binary systems with relatively short orbits ( @xmath01 - 100  d ) and long pulse period ( @xmath1710@xmath134 - 10@xmath19  s ) . by using evolutionary calculations",

    "it is apparent that , for magnetar - like fields and long spin periods the above timescales are much shorter than the lifetime of the supergiant s strong wind phase .",
    "therefore secular changes in the wind parameters and/or the ns magnetic field will be easily tracked by the ns spin .",
    "moreover since spin - up and spin - down take place on comparable timescales , it is to be expected that spin - up intervals during outbursts are compensated for by spin - down during quiescent intervals of comparable duration . in other words accretion state of long spin period sfxts",
    "would be expected to have a duty cycle of order @xmath00.5 or higher . as we discussed in ",
    "[ sec : properties ] , evidence for high values of the duty cycle is gradually emerging from high sensitivity observations of sfxts .",
    "on the other hand spin - down may also occur during the accretion intervals as a results of velocity and density gradients in the supergiant s wind that lead to temporary reversals of the angular momentum of the captured wind relative to the neutron star ( note that persistent wind accreting x - ray pulsars in hmxbs have long been known to alternate spin - up and spin - down intervals , see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "this would tend to favor spin - down , such that the ns spin might gradually evolve longwards of the spin period that is required to inhibit direct accretion and a transient source becomes a persistent one .",
    "interestingly , this might apply to s ,  a persistent x - ray pulsar with a luminosity of @xmath010@xmath8  erg  s@xmath4 , which displayed variations by a factor of @xmath11610 .",
    "since its spin period is extremely long ( @xmath146 ) @xmath123 is smaller than the corotation radius and the ns accretes continuously from the relatively weak supergiant companion s wind ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "the sfxts population might thus represent those supergiant hmxbs systems that have not ( yet ) evolved away from the spin period at which transitions across different ns state can take place .",
    "we note that for sfxts to host magnetars their dipole magnetic field must retain values in the @xmath51=0.1 - 1 range for a few 10@xmath29  yr , i.e. the typical timescale from the formation of the ns to the onset of the supergiant s strong wind .",
    "presently known magnetar candidates ( soft gamma repeaters , sgr , and anomalous x - ray pulsars , axp ) have estimated ages in the 10@xmath11 - 10@xmath12  yr range ( for a review see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "little is known on the long term evolution of the magnetic field of magnetars and different models have been proposed which lead to different predictions .",
    "we note that if the irrotational mode of ambipolar diffusion dominates the b - field decay , @xmath51=0.1 - 0.3 can be expected for ages of a few 10@xmath29  yr @xcite .    according to our proposed scenario the combination of a long spin period and a very large luminosity swing is indicative of the presence of a magnetar .",
    "this can be further corroborated through other magnetars signatures , such as e.g. proton cyclotron features in the x - ray spectrum @xcite or sporadic subsecond bursting activity such as that observed in axps and sgrs @xcite .",
    "finally we remark on the orbital period of sfxts : in all regimes described in   [ sec : model ] , the luminosity scales with l@xmath131@xmath91@xmath147v@xmath14 . for our fiducial wind parameters , orbital periods of tens of days",
    "are required for the transition between low and high luminosity states to occur at @xmath4810@xmath8  erg  s@xmath4 , a typical luminosity for the onset of sfxt outbursts @xcite .",
    "this is why throughout this paper we scaled our equations by p@xmath138=10  d and used the same value in the examples of figs .",
    "[ fig : trans]-[fig : igrj17544 ] .",
    "@xcite showed that orbital periods around @xmath010  d are compatible with the nss being embedded in the clumpy wind from the supergiant companions , rather than in a quasi - continuous wind . in this case",
    "sfxt outburst durations might be associated with the transit time of a clump @xmath148 in reasonable agreement with the observed durations of individual flares ( see   [ sec : properties ] ) .",
    "we conclude that clumpiness of the stellar wind , an often - used concept for interpreting sfxt activity , applies to the gating scenarios described here as well .",
    "the main advantage of introducing a gating mechanism rests with the possibility to model the very large luminosity swings of sfxts with much milder density ( or velocity ) contrasts in the wind .",
    "in this paper we reviewed the theory of wind accretion in hmxbs hosting a magnetic neutron star with a supergiant companion , and considered in some detail the interaction processes between the inflowing plasma and the magnetosphere that are expected to take place when direct accretion onto the neutron star surface is inhibited .",
    "we then applied this theory to sfxts and showed that their large luminosity swings between quiescence and outburst ( up to a factor of @xmath010@xmath19 ) can be attained in response to relatively modest variations of the wind parameters , provided the system undergoes transitions across different regimes . expanding on earlier work",
    ", we found that such transitions can be driven mainly by either : ( a ) a centrifugal barrier mechanism , which halts direct accretion when the neutron star rotation becomes superkeplerian at the magnetospheric radius , a mechanism that has been discussed extensively in be star x - ray transient pulsars , or ( b ) a magnetic barrier mechanism , when the magnetosphere extends beyond the accretion radius .",
    "which mechanism and wind interaction regime apply will depend sensitively on the ns spin period and magnetic field , besides the velocity and mass loss rate in the supergiant s wind .",
    "in particular , the magnetic barrier mechanism requires long spin periods ( @xmath171000  s ) coupled with magnetar - like fields ( @xmath1710@xmath15  g ) . on the other hand , magnetar - like fields would also be required if the centrifugal barrier set in at relatively high luminosities ( @xmath149  erg  s@xmath4 ) in neutron stars with spin periods of hundreds seconds .",
    "evidence has been found that the spin periods of a few sfxts might be as long as 1000 - 2000  s. motivated by this , we presented an interpretation of the activity of  ( whose spin period is unknown ) in terms of the magnetic barrier by a 1300  s spinning neutron star and showed that the luminosity stages singled out in a  observation of this source are well matched by the different regimes of wind - magnetosphere interaction expected in this case .",
    "we discussed also an interpretation of this source based on the centrifugal barrier and a slightly shorter spin period ( 400  s ) , which reproduced the luminosity stages comparably well .",
    "we emphasise that in both solutions the required magnetic field strength ( @xmath1710@xmath16  g and @xmath178@xmath3310@xmath126  g , respectively ) are in the magnetar range .    while the possibility that magnetars are hosted in binary system with supergiant companions has been investigated by several authors ( e.g. , * ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , clear observational evidence for such extremely high magnetic field neutron star in binary systems is still missing . according to the present study , long spin period sfxts might provide a new prospective for detecting and studying magnetars in binary systems .",

    "note also that the above lower limit does not violate the stability condition of the quasi - static atmosphere in the subsonic propeller regime .",
    "in fact , following @xcite , this atmosphere can be considered quasi - static if the relaxation time scale of the envelope is less than the drift time scale of the mass flow crossing the magnetospheric boundary . in our case matter penetration inside the ns magnetosphere in the subsonic propeller regime",

    "fig : magn_e_non ] , [ fig : lshortspin ] , and [ fig : vwind ] ) .    an upper limit to the khi mass flow rate can be obtained by assuming @xmath73/@xmath74=1 ( a solution adopted , for example , by * ? ? ?",
    "according to @xcite , the density @xmath73 can be increased until the thermal pressure inside the magnetosphere p@xmath88@xmath91@xmath73 is comparable to the magnetic pressure p@xmath83=b@xmath49(r@xmath39)/(8@xmath41 ) .",

    ", it is shown that @xmath73/@xmath74@xmath01 does not violate the condition p@xmath88@xmath69p@xmath83 ( at least in the subkeplerian magnetic inhibition regime ) . therefore , even though we restricted ourself to the lower limit h=1 , the upper limit on @xmath79 might be attainable in some instances",
    ". the khi would then provide matter penetration inside the magnetosphere at a rate @xmath0@xmath31 , thus allowing almost all the captured matter to accrete onto the ns . a detailed calculation of khi accretion in the subkeplerian magnetic inhibition and subsonic propeller regimes will be reported elsewhere .",
    "as shown by @xcite , the treatment of the supersonic propeller regime ( see   [ sec : supersonic ] ) is self consistent only if the energy input at the base of the atmosphere , due to the supersonic rotating ns magnetosphere , is larger than radiative losses within the atmosphere itself .",
