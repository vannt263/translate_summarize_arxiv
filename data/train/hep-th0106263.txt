    "the first attempts at creating a theory of relativistic fluids were those of eckart @xcite and landau and lifshitz @xcite .",
    "these theories are now known to be pathological in several respects .",
    "regardless of the choice of equation of state , all equilibrium states in these theories are unstable and in addition signals may be propagated through the fluid at velocities exceeding the speed of light .",
    "these problems arise due to the first order nature of the theory , that is , it considers only first - order deviations from the equilibrium leading to parabolic differential equations , hence to infinite speeds of propagation for heat flow and viscosity , in contradiction with the principle of causality .",

    "causal bulk viscous thermodynamics has been extensively used for describing the dynamics and evolution of the early universe or in an astrophysical context . but due to the complicated character of the evolution equations , very few exact cosmological solutions of the gravitational field equations are known in the framework of the full causal theory . for a homogeneous universe filled with a full causal viscous fluid source obeying the relation @xmath10 , exact general solutions of the field equations have been obtained in @xcite . in this case the evolution of the bulk viscous cosmological model can be reduced to a painleve - ince type differential equation , whose invariant form can be reduced , by means of nonlocal transformations , to a linear inhomogeneous ordinary second - order differential equation with constant coefficients @xcite .",
    "it has also been proposed that causal bulk viscous thermodynamics can model on a phenomenological level matter creation in the early universe @xcite .",
    "exact causal viscous cosmologies with @xmath11 have been obtained in @xcite .",
    "because of technical reasons , most investigations of dissipative causal cosmologies have assumed frw symmetry ( i.e. homogeneity and isotropy ) or small perturbations around it @xcite . the einstein field equations for homogeneous models with dissipative fluids can be decoupled and therefore are reduced to an autonomous system of first order ordinary differential equations , which can be analyzed qualitatively @xcite .",
    "it is the purpose of the present paper to investigate the effects of the bulk viscosity of the cosmological matter fluid on the dynamics of the brane world .",
    "since the effects of the extra - dimensions and also the viscous effects are more important at high matter densities , we restrict our analysis to the extreme case of a stiff ( zeldovich type ) cosmological fluid , with pressure equal to the energy density . hence the most important contribution to the energy density of",
