    "there exists two non - equivalent such points within the first brillouin zone , defined by the vectors @xmath6 $ ] , with @xmath7 the direct lattice parameter . in the vicinity of each of these points , or valleys",
    ", it is shown that the dispersion relation is linear , @xmath8 , for @xmath9 . in each valley",
    "@xmath10 , the envelope electronic functions related to this dispersion relation can thus be obtained as the pseudo - spinor solutions of an effective two - dimensional dirac s equation , @xmath11 here @xmath12 are the pauli matrices , we have re - defined @xmath13 for each valley , and the energy eigenvalues for positive ( negative ) helicity are @xmath14 .",

    "we shall neglect umklapp processes , and thus we have @xmath34 for normal processes . in this case ,",

    "<S> .    in this paper , phonon - limited transport coefficients in graphene are studied , by considering the presence of temperature and voltage gradients . under similar assumptions as in ref . </S>",
    "<S> ( @xcite ) , that is , bloch theory and deformation potential approximation for the interaction between electrons and longitudinal - acoustic phonons , analytical expressions for the transport coefficients are obtained from a variational solution of the boltzmann equation @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this method , at the lowest - order approximation , provides equivalent results to the relaxation time approximation and , at higher orders , converges to solutions of the boltzmann equation which are exact to an arbitrary precision , within the limitations of the set of variational functions chosen . </S>",
    "<S> as has been pointed out before @xcite , the semiclassical approach based on the boltzmann equation can not capture the subtleties of electronic transport in graphene right at the neutrality point . </S>",
    "<S> this limitation can , at least in part , be attributed to the inhomogeneity in the charge distribution experimentally observed in graphene samples at the neutrality point@xcite . however , </S>",
    "<S> at high carrier densities the fermi level is well above the dirac point , and the boltzmann equation then provides a correct description . </S>"
