    "even after fifty years of the advent of laser , achieving population inversion and lasing in novel systems remain a topic of continuing interest @xcite .",
    "in particular , inversion in solid - state emitters like quantum dots ( qds ) has attracted considerable interests recently @xcite , due to the possibility of lasing in a driven two - level system @xcite contrary to the common notion of multilevel manifolds @xcite .",
    "semiconductor qds are novel nano - structures with unique engineerable features like large optical dipole moments and emission wavelengths .",
    "they can also be integrated efficient to micro - cavities and waveguides @xcite .",
    "their similarities to two - level atoms have been demonstrated in phenomena like autler - townes doublet @xcite , mollow triplet in resonance fluorescence @xcite , spectral line narrowing @xcite and superradiance @xcite .",
    "furthermore , phonon - assisted excitation transfer in quantum dot molecules has been investigated in @xcite .",
    "additonally , due to potential application as solid state qubits numerous coherent optical studies of this system has been undertaken in the past decade @xcite . during last few years , sensitivity of qds to the nature of their phonon environment has been exploited in numerous investigations .",
    "phonon - assisted damping of rabi oscillations @xcite , effect of phonons on polarization - entangled photons @xcite , phonon induced transitions of excitons to cavity photons @xcite , heat pumping with optically driven excitons in phonon environment @xcite and effect of electron - phonon coupling on resonance fluorescence spectrum @xcite have been reported .",
    "moreover , phonon - mediated population inversion in a single qd - cavity system driven by a continuous wave @xcite and a pulse laser excitation @xcite was proposed recently .    in light of these works , here",
    ", we propose a novel scheme to achieve and enhance population inversion in an ensemble of strongly driven two - level solid - state emitters like qds via phonon - photon mediated collectivity ( see fig .",

    "the article is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we describe the analytical approach and the system of interest , and obtain the master equation characterising the photon - phonon mediated interaction among a collection of two - level pumped qubits . in section iii , we analyze the obtained results , respectively . the summary is given in section iv .",
    "we consider an ensemble of qds embedded in a substrate ( such as ingaas encased in gaas substrate ) or in a micro - cavity ( like that formed by inas / gaas bragg reflectors ) illuminated by a cw laser of frequency @xmath3 . as shown schematically in fig .",

    "the linear dimension of the ensemble is smaller or of the order of the relevant emission wavelength .",
    "the laser is detuned from the exciton transition by @xmath7 and drives it with a constant rabi frequency of @xmath0 .",
    "furthermore , the qds interact with the solid state environment ( phonon reservoir ) and with field modes of the electromagnetic vacuum ( photon reservoir ) leading to different incoherent decay processes .",

    "( [ eq1 ] ) the first three terms represent the free hamiltonians of the electromagnetic vacuum , the phonon reservoir and the two - level qds .",
    "the fourth term corresponds to the laser - qd interaction , while the two terms inside the curly brackets describe , respectively , the qds interaction with the surrounding phonon and vacuum reservoirs . the photon / phonon operators satisfy the standard boson commutation relations : @xmath10=\\delta_{uu'}$ ] and @xmath11 = [ q^{\\dagger}_{u},q^{\\dagger}_{u ' } ] = 0 , ~ ( q = \\{a , b\\ } , u =   \\{k , p\\})$ ] .",
    "the terms @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 are , respectively , the qd - phonon coupling constant taken in a general form satisfying the weak - coupling limit , the mode function of the three - dimensional multi - mode field , and the dipole moment of the @xmath15-th qd , while @xmath16 . the raising and lowering operators for each qd",
    "are denoted by : @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 while obeying the standard su(@xmath20 ) angular momentum commutation relations . in the following , we consider that the qds system is driven by an intense laser .",
    "this leads to the dressing of both the bare - states in each qd creating the dressed - states : @xmath21 .",
    "hence , it is imperative to continue the further analysis in the dressed - state basis .",
    "the general form of the dressed master equation ( dme ) in the interaction picture is given by @xcite : @xmath22 \\nonumber \\\\ & - & 1/\\hbar^{2}\\int^{t}_{0}dt ' \\left [ \\mathcal{h}_{i}(t),\\left[\\mathcal{h}_{i}(t ' ) , \\rho_{sb}(t')\\right ] \\right].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here , @xmath23 is the density operator of the combined qds @xmath24 reservoirs ( both vacuum and phonons ) in the interaction picture .",

    "the vacuum - induced dressed decay rates @xmath51 are derived under the assumption that the qds interact with a broad - band cavity mode of frequency @xmath52 and decay rate @xmath53 .",
    "@xmath54 is the phonon - induced dissipation rate of the qds at the generalized rabi frequency @xmath2 ( see fig .",
    "1b ) whereas @xmath55 describes the dephasing rate of qds @xcite .",
    "notice that both reservoirs , i.e. photon and phonon , contribute to the collectivity among the qds when fixed on a solid - state substrate . for this to occur",
    ", the inter - particle separations should be of the order of the smallest wavelength in the system ( or less ) .",
    "typically , the phonon wavelength in these samples is of the order of few / several nano - meters .",
    "therefore , the dicke limit considered here applies for a small qd system of an arbitrary shape or for specific geometries with moderate qds numbers @xcite .",
    "indeed , when two or more qubits are close to each other on the emission wavelength scale then collective effects occur , i.e. the photon / phonon emission of one qubit influences its neighbor qubit and vice - versa . a small - sized qds ensemble can be well within the dicke - limit with respect to photon emission wavelength .",
    "for phonons the situation is different .",
    "the phonon emission wavelength in our system ( the phonon linear dispersion @xmath56 is a good approximation in the long wave vector limit ; here , @xmath57 is the speed of sound while @xmath58 is the phonon wave vector ) is of the order of few / several @xmath59 leading to inter - qubits phonon interactions only if the qubits s separation is of this order or less .",
    "this can be achieved , for instance , in grid - like patterns as it was the case for experimentally observation of photon- induced superradiance with quantum dots @xcite or in a quantum - dot array interacting via a common phonon bath @xcite . here",
    ", however , the dicke limit with respect to phonon wavelength may not be satisfied meaning that the collective decay rates due to phonon emission will depend on the inter - qubit separations , @xmath60 .",
    "however , for a few / several - qubit ensemble one can still consider that the collective decay rate is equal for all qubits .",
    "this happens because the inter - qubit separation in the collective decay rates enters as an argument to a sin / cos - like function @xcite . adjusting the inter - qubit separation with respect to the phonon wavelength",
    "one can avoid the inter - particle dependence of the phonon - induced decay rates for small - sized ensembles .",
    "also , the exciton bohr radius should be smaller than the size of a single qd , i.e. qds are independent quantum objects in terms of quantum - mechanical tunnel coupling . finally , in deriving eq .",
    "( [ eq6 ] ) , we have assumed that all dipole moments are equal , while for an inhomogeneous sample the frequency spread @xmath61 of the transition frequencies should be less than the collective decay rates , i.e. @xmath62 ( see , also , ref .",

    ", we shall investigate the photon - phonon mediated emission - absorption properties of an ensemble of two - level laser - pumped quantum dots described by eq .",
    "( [ eq6 ] ) .",
    "to understand the physics of qd dynamics , we next investigate the steady - state fluorescence and absorption spectrum of a single qd in the dressed basis and then generalize the obtained results to a multi - qubit ensemble .",

    "the solid ( dashed ) lines in the plot corresponds to resonant ( non - resonant ) coherent excitation of the qd .",
    "the photon fluorescence spectrum shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2](a ) is similar to the mollow spectrum well known for atoms , however , with certain key modifications due to the phonon bath .",
    "the position of the mollow sidebands are shifted to @xmath75 with phonon induced broadening of their widths @xmath76 and that of the central line @xmath77 as can be easily seen from their respective analytical forms .",
    "additionally , in presence of phonons the sidebands are asymmetric with the ratio of the right to left peak heights as : @xmath78^{2}\\chi_{-}/\\chi_{+}$ ] .",
    "this asymmetry is pronounced for non - resonant driving of the qd as shown in fig .",

    "note that , such phonon induced modifications of the mollow triplet has been observed in a recent experiment @xcite .    the imaginary part of the photon absorption spectrum shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2](b ) is strikingly different from a typical mollow absorption spectrum of a two - level atom . as a key finding , for resonant excitation of a qd",
    "we report _ phonon induced amplification and absorption _ in the spectrum at @xmath82 respectively with peak heights @xmath83 .",
    "note that , these characteristics are absent in atomic system , where there is no phonon coupling and the probe field is transparent at resonance as @xmath84 .",
    "furthermore , for both resonant and non - resonant excitation , we find from eq .",
    "( [ eq11b ] ) broadening of the amplification and absorption spectral lines due to phonons . the imaginary part of eq .",
    "( [ eq11c ] ) exhibits another remarkable feature , _ gain _ in the phonon absorption spectrum for _ population inversion in the dressed - state_. this , in principle , leads to amplification of a weak phonon wave in presence of an additional phonon cavity @xcite tuned to the dressed transition at the shifted generalized rabi frequency of @xmath85 ( see fig .",
    "note that , the phonon amplification profile is enhanced only in presence of the vacuum reservoir as can be seen from the expressions for @xmath37 .    for a collection of @xmath8 qds in a sub - wavelength - sized ensemble ,",
    "the emission - absorption spectrum is modified due to collective effects .",
    "the spectral lines are further broadened and enhanced , with the enhancement proportional to @xmath86 and @xmath8 , respectively , for the mollow peaks in photon fluorescence and gain profile in the photon or phonon absorption @xcite . in the following",
    ", we discuss another key finding of the paper : _ collectivity assisted enhancement _ of steady - state population inversion .      in order to study the collective steady - state population inversion of the qds in bare- and dressed - basis , we need to obtain the steady - state solution of eq .",
    "( [ eq6 ] ) . for this purpose",
    ", we first define the dressed - state collective operators as : @xmath87 , and @xmath88 , and then look for a solution of the form : @xmath89,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the normalization @xmath90 is determined by the requirement @xmath91 .",
    "the unknown variable @xmath92 can be evaluated by inserting eq .",
    "( [ eq12 ] ) in the dme and taking the steady - state @xmath93 condition .",
    "on doing so , we obtain : @xmath94 .",
    "note that , the coherent part of the dipole - dipole interaction potential commutes with the steady - state solution ( [ eq12 ] ) obtained for a small - sized ensemble meaning that it does not modify the population distribution ( unless it is larger than the generalized rabi frequency ) .",
    "this can be seen by adding an extra term to the hamiltonian ( [ eq1 ] ) , namely : @xmath95 where the averaged over all possible orientation of dipoles coherent dipole - dipole interaction behaves as : @xmath96 , and it was taken identical for all involved qubits - an approximation valid for smaller ensembles . applying the dressed - state transformation ( [ dst ] ) to ( [ ddd ] ) in the secular approximation , one can observe that the hamiltonian describing the dipole - dipole interaction includes the collective correlators : @xmath97 , @xmath98 and @xmath99 , respectively , commuting with the solution ( [ eq12 ] ) .",
    "we next look for the inversion in the bare - states . in the secular approximation the collective bare - state inversion is given by : @xmath100 where @xmath101 is the collective steady - state dressed - state inversion found from eq .",
    "( [ eq12 ] ) as @xcite : @xmath102 to gain physical insight into the behavior of the bare - state population , we need to understand the inversion of dressed - state populations . for this purpose , we consider two limits in eq .",
    "( [ eq15 ] ) : ( i ) @xmath103 and ( ii ) @xmath104 . from eq .",
    "( [ eq15 ] ) , we get in the limit ( i ) : @xmath105 $ ] , which clearly approaches maximum inversion @xmath106 , for @xmath107 . as @xmath8 represent the number of qds in the ensemble , we can conclude that collectivity among the qds enhances population inversion in the dressed - state . in the limit ( ii ) on the other hand , we get : @xmath108 - 1 $ ] which for @xmath107 becomes , @xmath109 , suggesting that all the population tends to reside in the lower dressed - state @xmath110 and , thus , no inversion .",
    "note that , in the limit @xmath111 , @xmath112 there is also no inversion as the dressed - states are equally populated .",
    "additionally , we would like to emphasize that inversion is possible _ only in presence of the radiative decay _",
    "@xmath113 _ among the dressed - states _ with @xmath114 .",
    "this can be proved by analyzing the expressions for @xmath115 . on substituting @xmath116 we have @xmath117/[\\bar{n}\\gamma_{p}+\\gamma_{d } ] \\ge 1 $ ] , for any bath temperature and qd parameters thereby implying _ no possible dressed - state inversion_. finally , setting @xmath118 and @xmath119 , one can recover the thermal population distribution among the dressed - states @xcite .",
    "indeed , one can easily show that the steady - state upper and lower dressed - state populations ( see , also , fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) are , respectively , @xmath120 and @xmath121 . their respective ratio is : @xmath122 , where @xmath123 , and , thus , behaves according to thermal equilibrium relaxation .",
    "this will be the case also if spontaneous emission due to interaction with the vacuum modes of the surrounding electromagnetic field reservoir is smaller than the phonon - induced decay rates .",
    "it is clear from the above discussion and eqs  ( [ eq14 ] ) and ( [ eq15 ] ) , that for conditions of inversion in the dressed - state there will be no population inversion among the bare - states @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "however , at low temperature ( small @xmath124 ) , if @xmath125 we can satisfy the condition @xmath126 and @xmath127 thereby leading to inversion among the bare - states for negative laser detuning . in fig .",
    "[ fig3](a ) , we show the steady - state population inversion among the bare - states for different number of qds and typical experimental parameters @xcite .",
    "inversion is seen to be achievable for certain range of negative laser detuning as expected from the above discussion . additionally , we find collectivity induced enhancement of population inversion in the bare - state .",
    "this follows directly from the behavior of @xmath128 for @xmath126 .",
    "we report almost @xmath129 inversion for reasonable ( @xmath130 ) number of qds ( complete inversion in bare - state corresponds to a @xmath131 . note that the mean - phonon number depends on the generalized rabi frequency and , thus , varies as detuning varies .",
    "this has been explicitly considered here . in fig .",
    "[ fig3](b ) , we show the behavior of the imaginary part of photon absorption spectrum of eq .",
    "( [ eq11b ] ) at maximum bare - state inversion for a single qd .",
    "the spectrum show completely new feature in presence of phonons - _ amplification at bare - state inversion_. however , for @xmath132 or in absence of phonons , we get back the typical absorption peak instead of gain ( dot - dashed line in fig .",
    "[ fig3]b ) .",
    "this implies that we can get amplification of a probe laser from a qd ensemble .",
    "thus , concluding , for a small - sized ensemble of qds , we find that collectivity enhances the inversion substantially both in bare and dressed - state .",
    "hence , the _ phonon induced _ gain characteristics of photon - absorption spectrum that we report here for bare - state inversion , can be utilized towards amplification of a weak light field at optical frequencies in such solid - state systems .",
    "the _ photon induced _",
    "gain characteristic of the phonon - absorption spectrum for dressed - state inversion , on the other hand , can amplify a phonon wave at thz frequencies tuned to the @xmath2 transition ( as @xmath133 ps is achievable in qds ) .",
    "furthermore , the phonon emission of a single pumped qd shows anti - bunched phonon statistics , namely : @xmath134",
    ". \\label{g2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this can be understood as follows : once a phonon is emitted - the qubit will be in the lower dressed - state .",
    "obviously , the qubit will generate then a photon on the dressed - state transition @xmath135 or @xmath136 , respectively ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "therefore , one can obtain in principle a flux of single - phonons .",
    "if the qubit is pumped with a strong pulse , then one can manage to obtain a single - phonon anti - bunched source .",
    "here , one can look also at the photon - photon , phonon - phonon , phonon - photon or photon - phonon induced correlations .",
    "thus , photon - phonon correlations open interesting regimes of quantum statistics in these systems which can be harnessed towards quantum computation .",
    "summarising , we have derived a collective dressed - state master equation for an ensemble of strongly driven qds coupled to phonon and vacuum reservoirs . as a key finding , we reported gain characteristic in the photon and phonon absorption spectrum instead of transparency and absorption respectively due to crucial interplay of the vacuum and phonon reservoirs .",
    "furthermore , we have shown that phonon mediated collectivity among the qds enhances the population inversion in the bare - states .",
    "anti - bunching occurs for phonon emission by a single pumped qd .",
    "our findings show the possibility for amplification of photon and phonon waves as well as quantum particle correlations , and can open new directions towards creation of nanoscale optical and acoustic quantum or classical coherent sources .",
