    "our original goal was to discover some eclipsing binaries among be stars to support of the binary hypothesis of the origin of the be phenomenon ( harmanec et al . 1972 ; k and harmanec 1975 ) .",
    "the  observing program was started immediately after the installation of the 0.65-m reflector on july 29 , 1972 and has continued until now , with a number of croatian , czech and other observers participating .",
    "the program was parallel to spectroscopic monitoring of be stars in ondejov .",
    "soon we found that the be stars vary on several timescales , the dominant being long - term changes on a timescale of years but often with quite a small amplitude .",
    "therefore , there was a need for a very careful transformation to the standard johnson system .",
    "the following _ non - linear seasonal transformations _ are a must ( see harmanec , horn and juza 1994 and references therein for details ) : @xmath0 where @xmath1 stands for @xmath2 , @xmath3 , and @xmath4 and @xmath5 are the seasonal transformation coefficients ( different for each passband ) .",
    "the second crucial step was to homogenize but not to re - define original johnson  magnitudes of many stars .",
    "this way , our comparison , check and red standard stars can be used as seasonal transformation standards .",
    "the whole package of reduction programs with hec22 , vypar , auxiliary programs , a detailed manual , and practical examples is available at _ http://astro.troja.mff.cuni.cz : ftp / hec / phot_. the reduction program hec22 is also able to model the changes of extinction during observing nights , which greatly improves the accuracy of all - sky photometry , therefore also the seasonal transformations - see figure  [ ext ] .",
    "the second order extinction coefficients are derived among the _ seasonal _ transformation coefficients , not every night , since they are given by the transmission properties of the instrument , not the atmosphere of the earth .",

    "it is obvious that choosing a site for a photometric observatory , located only 240  m above the sea level on a relatively small island and not very far from a city of hvar is , well , somewhat unusual .",

    "when he first climbed the ` goat trail ' to the observatory and looked around , he said : _  it is a nonsense to built an observatory here ... but what a marvelous one ! \" _",
    "our task was to give sense to this nonsense and we hope we did ... the number of publications in refereed journals and a simple statistics show that quite clearly .",
    "our approach led to a ` rehabilitation ' of the  system : applying reductions with hec22 , we were able to combine the data from hvar ( 240  m above the sea level ) and san pedro mrtir ( 2800  m above the sea level ) _ without need for any artificial zero - point shifts . _",
