    "these additional features do not qualitatively change the phase separation , and we therefore turn to one mechanism that does : the coupling of a flow field to the cahn  hilliard equation  @xcite . in this case , the cahn  hilliard concentration equation is modified by an advection term , and the flow field is either prescribed or evolves according to some fluid equation . ding and",

    ", the inclusion of this term can have a substantial effect on the behaviour of the system .",
    "for the rest of this study , this term is set to zero ; its inclusion is discussed elsewhere by the present authors  @xcite , and by others  @xcite .    in view of the severe constraint @xmath144 , some discussion about the applicability of eqs .",
    "to real systems is warranted .",
    "this constraint is the condition that the mean thickness of the film be much smaller than the transition - layer thickness . in experiments involving the smallest film thicknesses attainable ( @xmath145 m )",
    "@xcite , this condition is naturally satisfied . furthermore , in certain situations far from this limiting case , variations in the domain structure in the vertical direction are suppressed , and a system of equations with no vertical ( @xmath37- ) dependence , such as eqs .  , is appropriate .",
    "this kind of situation arises when external effects such as the air - fluid and fluid - substrate interactions do not prefer one binary fluid component or another ; hence , the dimensionality of the film is reduced , and the balance laws implied by eqs .",
    "are applicable .",
    "the choice of potential @xmath146 determines the behaviour of solutions . in this section",

    "these are bounds on norms of the solution @xmath147 that are obtained without assuming any prior knowledge of the solution . throughout this section , the driving force resulting from surface - tension gradients is set to zero .",
    "the first step in our analytical study is to find the circumstances under which the constant state @xmath148 is unstable to a small - amplitude , initial perturbation @xmath149 .",
    "this perturbation evolves in time to a state @xmath150 , which satisfies the linearized version of equations  . by writing down a wave ansatz @xmath151",

    "the system can become unstable as a result of substrate - film interactions if @xmath154 .",
    "such an interaction will often lead to rupture  @xcite .",
    "if this route is suppressed , then film rupture may be prevented , but the second route to instability is also relevant .",
    "this is accessible when @xmath93 is in the spinodal range @xmath155 .",
    "thus , even when the first route to instability is not accessible , a critical mixed state will phase separate in a manner similar to the classical cahn ",
    "hilliard fluid , as described in sec .",
    "[ sec : intro ] .    while the linear analysis is helpful to describe early - stage evolution , it sheds no light on the behaviour at later times .",
    "we therefore turn to the non - linear analysis of the problem  .",

    "it is necessary to construct a lyapunov functional , that is , a non - negative , non - increasing functional of the solution @xmath147 .",
