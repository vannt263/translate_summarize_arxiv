    "self lensing refers to the gravitational lensing phenomenon that occurs within a binary system where the brightness of a background star ( source ) is magnified by its foreground companion ( lens ) .",
    "this concept was first mentioned by @xcite .",
    "@xcite and @xcite later pointed out that binary systems in which one member is a degenerate , compact object  a white dwarf ( wd ) , neutron star ( ns ) , or black hole ( bh ) ",
    "could cause repeated magnification of its companion star if the orbit happened to be viewed edge - on .",
    "the magnification of these self - lensing binary systems is very tiny , typically a part in one thousand or less for a sun - like source star , and thus it was considered to be very difficult to detect such a phenomenon .",
    "the concept of self lensing , which had been dormant for more than two decades , resurrected with the advent of new types of experiments that are equipped with instruments with greatly enhanced photometric precision and survey capability . with the start of galactic microlensing surveys , @xcite and",
    "later @xcite revisited self lensing and estimated the possibility of detecting self - lensing binaries in the data acquired from lensing surveys .",
    "@xcite evaluated the prospect of detecting self - lensing binaries in the data obtained from sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) .",
    "@xcite investigated lensing effects of a planet transiting its host star . @xcite and @xcite pointed out that space - based instruments such as _ kepler _ and _ eddington _ would be sensitive to compact objects in binaries through their microlensing signatures . finally , by using _ kepler _ data , @xcite reported the first discovery of a self - lensing binary system ( koi-3278 ) that is composed of a wd stellar remnant and a sun - like companion .",
    "the number of self - lensing binary detections is expected to be increased in a wealth of data from current and future survey experiments .",
    "occultation and lensing are different limits of the same phenomena occurring when one body passes in front of another body @xcite . under some circumstances , both magnification of the source flux by lensing and",
    "de - magnification by occultation can simultaneously occur .",
    "this happens to binaries composed of wd - star pairs for which the size of the lens ( wd ) is equivalent to the einstein radius @xcite .",
    "for example , the radius of the wd companion of koi-3278 is @xmath0 of the estimated einstein radius . considering",
    "that wd - star pairs are important targets to observe self - lensing phenomena , there will be more self - lensing cases where both lensing and occultation are important .    in this paper",
    ", we introduce a degeneracy between lensing and occultation in the analysis of self - lensing phenomena .",
    "we demonstrate that this degeneracy is intrinsic and thus very severe , making it difficult to accurately characterize self - lensing binary systems .    the paper is organized as follows . in section 2 , we describe basic physics of self lensing , including various effects that determines self - lensing light curves . in section 3 , we introduce the degeneracy between lensing and occultation and demonstrate the severity of the degeneracy by presenting example self - lensing light curves suffering from the degeneracy .",
    "we summarize results and conclude in section 4 .",
    "the basic difference between self - lensing and regular microlensing phenomena comes from the fact that the einstein radius of the self - lensing phenomenon is much smaller than that of the regular lensing phenomenon .",
    "the einstein radius is related to the mass of the lens , @xmath1 , the distances to the lens , @xmath2 , and source , @xmath3 , by @xmath4^{1/2}. \\label{eq1}\\ ] ] for self - lensing phenomena , @xmath5 and thus the second term within the brackets on the right side of equation  ( [ eq1 ] ) becomes @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the semi - major axis of the binary orbit .",
    "this term is much smaller than the factor @xmath8 of the regular lensing phenomenon that occur by a lensing object located roughly halfway between the source and observer and thus einstein radii of self - lensing phenomena are very small .",
    "to be also noted is that the einstein radius of the self - lensing phenomenon does not depend on the distance to the binary @xcite , i.e.   @xmath9    measuring the einstein radius is important because it enables one to determine the physical parameters of the lens .",
    "in addition to the relation in equation  ( [ eq2 ] ) , the mass and semi - major axis are related to each other by the kepler s law @xmath10 since the orbital period @xmath11 and the mass of the lensed star @xmath12 can be determined from follow - up photometric and spectroscopic observation , kepler s law provides another relation between @xmath13 and @xmath7 . with the two unknowns and two relations , therefore",
    ", it is possible to determine the physical parameters of self - lensing binary systems .    in figure",
    "[ fig : one ] , we present the einstein radii of self - lensing phenomena as a function of the semi - major axis and the mass of a lensing object . for stellar - mass lensing objects with masses in the range @xmath14 , the expected einstein radii of self - lensing effects are in the range @xmath15 for binaries with semi - major axes",
    "these einstein radii are @xmath17  @xmath18 times smaller than the einstein radii of galactic microlensing events with typical radii of @xmath19 .",
    "the most important consequence of very small einstein radii of self - lensing phenomena is that lensing magnifications are affected by severe finite - source effects .",
    "finite size of a source affects lensing magnifications due to a differential magnification , where different parts of the source surface are magnified by different amounts @xcite .",
    "finite - source effects are described by the ratio of the source radius @xmath20 to the einstein radius . for regular microlensing events ,",
    "the ratio is @xmath21 and thus finite - source effects become important either for very rare cases of extremely high - magnification events , where the lens traverses or approaches very close to the source , or for events associated with extremely large source stars . on the other hand , the ratio is @xmath22 ",
    "@xmath23 for self - lensing phenomena that occur on typical main - sequence stars . as a result ,",
    "self - lensing phenomena are always affected by severe finite - source effects and exhibit light curves that are very different from those of regular lensing events .    under the assumption of a uniform disk ,",
    "the lensing magnification of a finite source is computed as the area ratio of the lensed image to the source star .",
    "the image position , @xmath24 , for a given position of a source with respect to a lens , @xmath25 , is obtained by solving the lens equation @xmath26 where all lengths are normalized to the einstein radius @xcite . solving the equation with respect to *",
    "z * yields two solutions of the image positions @xmath27 { { \\bf u}\\over u}. \\\\ \\label{eq5}\\ ] ]    figure  [ fig : two ] shows the variation of self - lensing images ( grey shaded region ) with the change of the lens ( circle shaded by slanted lines ) location with respect to the source ( orange circle ) .",
    "we note that the positions of the image envelope are obtained by solving equation  ( [ eq5 ] ) for the positions along the envelope of the source .",
    "the center of the lens is marked by the `` + '' symbol and the einstein radius around the lens is marked by a red circle .",
    "we note that a similar plot was presented in figure 2 of @xcite .",
    "when the lens is out of the source star surface ( @xmath28 ) , there exist two separate images : one big image located out of the einstein ring ( major image ) and the other small image within the einstein ring ( minor image ) . on the other hand ,",
    "when the lens is within the source star surface ( @xmath29 ) , there exists a single image with a small hole inside .",
    "the positions of the hole corresponds to those of the minor image , i.e.   @xmath30 in equation  ( [ eq5 ] ) .",
    "then , the magnification of a uniform , finite source is expressed as @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the area of the source , and @xmath33 and @xmath34 are the areas of the major and minor images , respectively .    under the assumption that the disk of a source is uniform , finite - source magnifications during very close lens - source approaches can be expressed in an analytic form .",
    "for the derivation of the analytic expression , we present the geometry of a self - lensing system in figure  [ fig : three ] . in the figure , the green annulus represents the image of a source when the source ( yellow circle ) is gravitational lensed by a lens ( grey circle ) that is exactly aligned with the source .",
    "the positions of the inner and outer circles of the image are the major- and minor - image locations corresponding to the envelope of the source , and thus the radii of the inner and outer circles are @xmath35 , \\cr r_{\\rm out } & = { 1\\over 2 } \\left [ \\left ( r_*^2 + 4r_{\\rm e}^2\\right)^{1/2}+r_*\\right ] , \\cr } \\label{eq7}\\ ] ] respectively .",
    "then , the lensing magnification , which corresponds to area ratio of the image to the source , is expressed as @xcite @xmath36^{1/2}. \\label{eq8}\\ ] ] in the limiting case where @xmath37 , equation  ( [ eq8 ] ) is approximated as when @xmath38 and @xmath39 when @xmath40 . ]",
    "@xcite @xmath41 this approximation is useful in estimating the peak magnifications of self - lensing events .",
    "for example , the peak magnifications with @xmath42 , 0.05 , and 0.1 are @xmath43 , 1.005 , and 1.02 , respectively .",
    "stellar disks are not uniform in brightness . instead , central part of a stellar disk appears brighter than the edge due to limb - darkening .",
    "then , when finite - source effects are important in lensing magnifications , limb - darkening effects come along @xcite . in figure",
    "[ fig : four ] , we present the variation of lensing magnifications caused by limb - darkening effects .",
    "we model the surface brightness profile as @xcite @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the linear limb - darkening coefficient and @xmath46 is the angle between the line of sight toward the center of the source star and the normal to the source surface .",
    "we note that @xmath45 depends not only on the stellar type of the source but also on the observed passband .",
    "we accommodate the limb - darkening effect on lensing light curves by dividing the source into multiple annuli and giving a weight of the surface brightness to each annulus in the computation of finite - source magnifications .",
    "we note that finite - source magnifications including limb darkening can also be computed by using analytic expressions derived by @xcite for circular sources and @xcite for elliptical sources .",
    "from the pattern of the variation , it is found that the limb - darkened magnification is higher than the magnification of a uniform disk when the lens is located at the center of the source star disk , where the surface brightness is high .",
    "in contrast , the magnification when the source is located at the edge , where the surface brightness is low , is lower than uniform - disk magnification .",
    "it is also found that the limb - darkening effect causes the flat top part of the light curve to appear rounder .",
    "these tendencies become more important as the limb - darkening coefficient increases .",
    "very small einstein radii of self - lensing phenomena sometimes require to consider finite sizes of lenses .",
    "the effect of a finite lens on lensing magnification is caused because a lensed image can be partly blocked by the lens @xcite .",
    "the occultation of an image is illustrated in figure  [ fig : two ] .",
    "since the blocked part of the image can not be seen , finite - lens effects cause the lensing magnification to appear lower than the magnification of a point lens .",
    "occultation effects occur when the lens radius is greater than the inner radius of the image , i.e.  @xmath47 . under this condition ,",
    "lensing magnifications become @xcite @xmath48 where the second term on the right side is the magnification term induced by lensing while the last term is the de - magnification term induced by finite - lens effects .",
    "@xcite showed that the analytic expression holds when the lens is well inside the source .",
    "then , the lensing magnification when the lens is located over the source star surface is expressed as @xmath49 which is known as the `` inverse - transit approximation '' @xcite .",
    "note that @xmath50 implies that the image is completely blocked out by the lens .",
    "we also note that the expression for exact lensing magnifications considering finite source and lens is provided by @xcite .",
    "de - magnification by occultation is important for self - lensing phenomenon where the radius of the lens is comparable to the einstein radius , i.e.  @xmath51 @xcite .",
    "for wd lenses , which are roughly the same size as the earth , i.e.  @xmath52 , the size of the lens can be a significant fraction of the einstein radius and thus finite - lens effects can be important .",
    "for stellar lenses , on the other hand , the lens is much bigger than the einstein radius , i.e.  @xmath53 . in this case , the resulting light curve of the background star is simply that of an eclipsing binary where lensing signatures can not be detected .    in figure",
    "[ fig : five ] , we present light curves of self - lensing events with different ratios of the lens radius to the einstein radius . from the comparison of the light curves , it is found that magnifying lensing effects and de - magnifying occultation effects compete each other depending on the ratio @xmath54 . for small @xmath54 ratios , lensing effects dominate and",
    "the source flux is magnified . as the ratio increases , occultation effects become more important .",
    "the simultaneous occurrence of magnification by lensing and de - magnification by occultation provokes a question on whether the contribution of the lensing - induced magnification can be separated from observed light curves in order to accurately determine the einstein radius and thus to characterize binary systems . to answer the question",
    ", we compare self - lensing light curves with similar peak magnifications but with different combinations of the einstein ring and the lens radii . for a given magnification and a source radius , the relation between @xmath55 and @xmath56 of degenerate solutions are obtained from equation  ( [ eq12 ] ) , i.e. @xmath57 .",
    "\\label{eq13}\\ ] ] we note that this expression is valid for @xmath58 .",
    "figure  [ fig : six ] shows example degenerate light curves resulting from 5 different combinations of @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "the lensing parameters are chosen so that the individual light curves can explain the observed light curve of the self - lensing binary koi-3278 .",
    "we note that the model parameters presented by @xcite are @xmath59 , @xmath60 , and @xmath61 and the lens - source impact parameter is @xmath62 .",
    "the lower panel shows the residuals from the point - lens case , i.e.  @xmath63 .",
    "we note that for all degenerate cases , the lens radius is significantly larger than the inner radius of the image @xmath64 . in figure",
    "[ fig : seven ] , we also present the distribution of the fractional deviation of the peak magnification @xmath65 from the point - lens magnification @xmath66 as a function of the lens to einstein radius ratio , @xmath54 .    from the comparison of the light curves",
    ", it is found that the light curves are similar each other despite the large differences in the values of @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "the degeneracy between light curves is especially severe when the lens is smaller than the einstein ring .",
    "it is found that the difference in the fractional magnification is @xmath67 for self - lensing events with @xmath68 .",
    "the photometric precision of _ kepler _ is @xmath69 , 1@xmath70 error achieved in 15 min sampling for a @xmath71 star @xcite , which corresponds to @xmath72 .",
    "then , although self - lensing itself , with @xmath73 , can be detected with a significant statistical confidence , it will be difficult to distinguish degenerate light curves suffering from the lensing / occultation degeneracy .    with the increase of @xmath54 ratio , the deviation from the point - lens light curve increases .",
    "it is found that the major deviations occur during the ingress and egress of the lens over the source surface .",
    "considering the photometric precision of kepler , however , it is expected that resolving the degeneracy will be possible for only events that experience severe occultation effects .",
    "we introduced a degeneracy that would happen in interpreting light curves of self - lensing phenomena .",
    "we found that the degeneracy was intrinsic to self - lensing binaries for which both magnification by lensing and de - magnification by occultation occur simultaneously .",
    "we found that the degeneracy was severe and would be difficult to resolve by the precision of _ kepler _ data .",
    "therefore , the degeneracy would pose as an important obstacle in accurately determine self - lensing parameters and thus to characterize binaries .",
