    "when the vlasov - poisson equations are studied by means of eulerian numerical simulations , one encounters , for low amplitude fluctuations , the problem of the initial state recurrence . as explained by cheng et al .",
    "@xcite , the recurrence phenomenon is intimately related to the presence of a free - streaming term in the distribution function and to the filamentation problem @xcite . since the mesh - size of the velocity grid is necessarily finite , the initial state is periodically re - constructed , and thus the electric field exhibits a fake recurrence of the initial state , whose period is @xmath0 , @xmath1 being the perturbation wavenumber and @xmath2 the numerical grid mesh in velocity space .    in this paper , the effects of collisions on the phenomenon of the numerical recurrence are discussed .",
    "collisions are modeled through the lenard - bernstein ( lb ) operator , firstly proposed in 1958 by lenard and bernstein @xcite as a full three - dimensional velocity space collisional operator .",
    "the lb operator is a linear fokker - planck collisional operator which belongs , as the dougherty one @xcite , to the class of `` simplified '' collisional operators and both collisional terms can be interpreted as advection - diffusion operators in the velocity space .",
    "basically , since both theoretical and numerical approaches of the landau collisional integral @xcite - the natural collisional operator for plasmas - are very complicated , effects of collisions are usually modeled through simplified collisional operators as the two mentioned above .",
    "recently , by comparing the effects of the landau and dougherty operators in a homogeneous plasma , pezzi et al .",
    "@xcite have shown that the two operators can be successfully compared once time is opportunely scaled by a constant factor .",
    "this represents a quite good and computationally affordable way to perform self - consistent collisional simulations in the realistic three - dimensional velocity space @xcite .",
    "however , when collisions act on longitudinal electrostatic waves and the system dynamics occurs preferentially in a unique direction , one can describe collisional effects in a reduced one - dimensional velocity space by adopting one - dimensional collisional operators .",
    "this approach has already been adopted in several works @xcite . in the same spirit , here we focus on the one - dimensional lb operator .",
    "our analysis complements previous results discussed in earlier works ( see refs .",
    "@xcite ) : as these authors pointed out , for the linear landau damping problem an opportune collisionality can prevent the onset of the numerical recurrence and restore the correct collisionless damping as expected within the landau theory @xcite .",
    "moreover , an important result in the study of the lb operator has been established by ng et al .",
    "@xcite : while the collisionless vlasov - poisson system supports a continuous spectrum of neutral singular eigenmodes ( the so - called case - van kampen modes @xcite ) , the introduction of the lb operator modifies the spectrum into a set of proper , discrete eigenmodes .",
    "the landau damping phenomenon , which in the collisionless case appears due to the phase - mixing of the continuous spectrum @xcite , is recovered as a discrete eigenmode , in the limit of vanishing collisionality . however , as we will show , when the vlasov - poisson - lb system is discretized in the velocity space ( and hence bound to a finite resolution ) , the landau root is recovered as a discrete eigenvalue only for a given value of collisionality .",
    "interestingly , the same effect on the spectrum induced by lb collisions has been discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite in the context of _ spectral deformation_. this is a technique introduced for the vlasov - poisson system in @xcite , where a non - unitary transformation is applied to the linear operator , in such a way that its eigenvalues with nonzero real part remain unchanged , while the continuum of neutral modes is damped . in analogy to the case of lb operator , the landau damping is recovered as a true eigenmode .",
    "therefore , we suggest that the lb operator might be interpreted as a spectral deformation to the collisionless vlasov - poisson system",
    ". however , the precise identification of the transformation which is equivalent to the lb operator is left for future work .",
    "the aim of our analysis is to understand if recursive effects or any other numerical effect associated to limited velocity resolution of eulerian calculations can be successfully removed by making use of a collisional operator , without increasing the number of gridpoints in the velocity domain ( and without altering the physical features of the system evolution ) . in case of positive response",
    ", this would be extremely useful especially for multi - dimensional simulations , where the velocity resolution is limited for computational reasons .",
    "we show that , in general , the collision frequency @xmath3 which is suitable for preventing recurrence in the linear regime is a function of the perturbation wavenumber : as the wavenumber increases a stronger collisionality is necessary to avoid the onset of the numerical recurrence .",
    "moreover , by focusing on the nonlinear landau damping and in particular on the formation of a bernstein - greene - kruskal ( bgk ) nonlinear wave @xcite , we show that i ) the collisionless case is also slightly affected by recurrence and ii ) collisional effects become important when the dynamics evolve to the nonlinear stage .",
    "therefore , it seems impossible to use the lb operator to avoid the numerical recurrence and , simultaneously , preserve the phase space structures developed as in the collisionless case .",
    "of course , in the case of higher velocity resolution , for which the recurrence time is significantly larger than the characteristic time of the physical process of interest ( landau damping , onset of instabilities , generation of nonlinear bgk structures and so on ) , the use of a collisional operator opportunely tailored to eliminate numerical recurrence does not affect the reliability of the physical results for times smaller than the recurrence time . however , let us remark that this case is not the one of interest in our analysis in which we intentionally choose to have recurrence in the initial stage of the simulations , which typically can not afford a very fine resolution in velocity space ( especially in multi - dimensions ) . finally , by exploring the recurrence effect on the bump - on - tail instability @xcite",
    ", we show that the recurrence affects both the linear exponential growth and the nonlinear saturation of the instability by producing a fake growth in the electric field and that , as in the nonlinear landau damping case , collisional effects are not able to prevent the initial state recurrence without significantly altering the nonlinear structures .    in summary ,",
    "the purpose of this paper is twofold .",
    "first , we show how recursive effect and filamentation , which are usually described in the context of low amplitude fluctuations , can also be problematic in nonlinear phenomena , such as the saturation regime of the bump - on - tail instability .",
    "second , we discuss a useful diagnostic , in terms of expansion of the velocity space into hermite functions , that allows to better appreciate the effect of an artificial collisional operator in phase space .",
    "let us summarize the content of the paper . in sec .",
    "[ secmath ] the theoretical background of the problem is given and the numerical strategies adopted to approach the solution are explained .",
    "then , in sec .",
    "[ secld ] , the recurrence effects on the landau damping phenomenon are described in both linear and nonlinear regimes by transforming the vlasov - poisson system into hermite - fourier coordinates and by means of eulerian simulations .",
    "moreover , we investigate how collisional effects prevent the recurrence problem but , at the same time , smooth out the nonlinear plasma dynamics features as the system evolves to the nonlinear regime .",
    "then , in sec .",
    "[ secbump ] we analyze the initial state recurrence problem and the collisional effects for the case of the bump - on - tail instability . finally , in sec .",
    "[ secconcl ] we conclude by summarizing the shown results .",
    "here we consider a quasi - neutral and unmagnetized plasma composed by kinetic electrons and immobile background ions .",
    "we assume that only electrostatic interactions occur between particles , therefore the maxwell system reduces to the poisson equation . furthermore , since electron - ion and ion - ion collision frequencies are much smaller than the electron - electron one , we take into account only electron - electron collisions @xcite . as introduced above , electron - electron collisions are modeled through the lb collisional operator @xcite .",
    "the normalized collisional vlasov - poisson ( vp ) equations - where collisions are modeled through the lb collisional operator - in the 1d1v ( one dimension in physical space and one dimension in velocity space ) phase space configuration reads : @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the electron distribution function , @xmath6 is the electrostatic potential , defined as @xmath7 ( @xmath8 is the electric field ) and @xmath9 is the lb collisional operator . due to their inertia , the protons are considered as a motionless neutralizing background of constant density @xmath10 . in previous equations ,",
    "time is scaled to the inverse electron plasma frequency @xmath11 , velocities to the initial electron thermal speed @xmath12 ; consequently , lengths are normalized by the electron debye length @xmath13 and the electric field by @xmath14 ( @xmath15 and @xmath16 being the electron mass and charge , respectively ) . for the sake of simplicity , from now on",
    ", all quantities will be scaled using the characteristic parameters listed above .",

    "the lb operator preserves global mass .",
    "moreover , if the distribution function has null average speed @xmath18 and unitary temperature @xmath19 , being @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 respectively plasma mean velocity , density and temperature , it conserves also momentum and energy .    in the following we analyze the equations system eqs .",
    " coupled to eq . .",
    "for the sake of simplicity , we refer to this system compactly as eqs .",
    ". two different analyses have been performed on eqs .  and are briefly explained in the following two subsections .",
    "a very convenient way of studying the properties of the lb operator in the linear regime is by employing an expansion of the linearized distribution function into a fourier - hermite basis . here",
    ", we use the so - called asymmetrically weighted hermite functions @xcite : @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the n - th hermite polynomial , defined as @xmath25 and @xmath26 . the basis in eqs .",
    " has the following properties : @xmath27 @xmath28 being the kronecker delta .",
    " are linearized around an homogeneous equilibrium that , when expanded in hermite functions , reads @xmath29 .",
    "note that , for a maxwellian equilibrium with zero mean velocity , all coefficients @xmath30 are null for @xmath31 .",
    "the perturbed distribution function @xmath32 is expanded as : @xmath33 with @xmath34 , and @xmath35 the domain length . by using the orthogonality of the fourier - hermite basis ,",
    "one obtains , for each @xmath36 mode :    @xmath37    note that @xmath38 is an eigenfunction of the lb operator of eq .",
    ", with eigenvalue @xmath39 , and thus the use of the rescaling factor in the argument of the basis in eqs .  allows to obtain a rather compact formulation ( compare , for instance , with the formulation in @xcite ) . in particular , the linear equation ( [ linear_eq ] ) can be written in matrix form as : @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the vector defined as @xmath42 , and the matrix @xmath43 is defined as @xmath44 the collisionality @xmath3 affects only the diagonal entries of the matrix . once again , this is due to the fact that the hermite basis is an eigenfunction of the lb operator .",
    "of course , when numerically solving the linear problem in eq .",
    ", one has to truncate the matrix @xmath45 , that is , one has to choose the maximum number @xmath46 of hermite modes in the expansion of eq . , by setting @xmath47 for any @xmath48 ( other closures have been investigated , see , e.g. @xcite )",
    "this corresponds to defining the resolution in velocity space .",
    "it is precisely the inability to capture increasingly finer scales in velocity space that gives rise to the phenomenon of recurrence in the numerical solutions of vlasov equation .",
    "this becomes particularly clear by looking at the recurrence effect within the framework of the hermite basis expansion in velocity .",
    "= 8.5 cm      the other approach consists in the numerical solution of eqs .",
    " through a eulerian code based on a finite difference scheme for the approximation of spatial and velocity derivatives of @xmath49 over the grid - points .",
    "time evolution of the distribution function is approximated through the splitting scheme first introduced by filbet et al .",
    "@xcite [ see refs .",
    "@xcite for details about the numerical algorithm ] , which is a generalization of the well - known splitting scheme discussed by @xcite .",
    "we impose periodic boundary conditions in physical space and @xmath49 is set equal to zero for @xmath50 , where @xmath51 .",
    "phase space is discretized with @xmath52 grid points in the physical domain and @xmath53 points in the velocity domain .",
    "finally , the time step @xmath54 has been chosen in such a way to respect the courant - friedrichs - levy condition @xcite for the numerical stability of time explicit finite difference schemes .",
    "= 8.5 cm    the plasma is initially in an equilibrium state and we perturb the system through an oscillating density perturbation which produces , through the poisson equation , a perturbative electric field of amplitude @xmath55 .",
    "in the present section , recurrence effects and collisional effects on this phenomenon are described for the the case of the landau damping of a langmuir wave .",
    "first , we study a collisionless ( @xmath56 ) linear landau damping case , for the wavenumber @xmath57 ( being @xmath58 ) , by means of the fourier - hermite decomposition with @xmath59 .",
    "the system is initially perturbed through a spatially sinusoidal electric field perturbation , which translates , in the fourier - hermite space , to initialize the vector @xmath41 as @xmath60 ( the electric field is proportional to @xmath61 ) .",
    "figure [ fig1 ] shows the temporal evolution of the absolute value of the hermite coefficients @xmath62 in logarithm scale . since the filamentation in velocity space naturally produces small velocity scales , hermite coefficients of increasingly higher modes are excited . when the largest mode gets excited , the truncation of the series acts as a reflecting boundary ( around time @xmath63 ) , and the perturbation travels back towards lower modes . around time @xmath64",
    ", the electric field damping is abruptly interrupted and a value close to the initial value is restored .",
    "let us note that , although the electric field will not be affected until the recurrence time @xmath64 , the distribution function is spuriously altered from time @xmath63 , that is when the perturbation reflects on the boundary .",
    "= 8.5 cm    as we mentioned earlier , the effect of a non - null collisionality in the vlasov - poisson linear operator is to modify the spectrum of eigenvalues .",
    "landau damping is not anymore due to the phase - mixing of a continuous set of neutral mode .",
    "moreover , for a large enough value of @xmath3 , it appears as the least - damped eigenvalue of the system .",
    "this is shown in figure [ fig2 ] , where , for the same value of @xmath65 , we show the spectrum of the matrix @xmath45 for four increasing values of collisionality : @xmath66 ( respectively in black , red , blue and gold dots ) . the damping rate @xmath67 and the wave propagation frequency @xmath68 are respectively shown on the horizontal and vertical axes of fig .",
    "the values corresponding to the theoretical langmuir roots ( @xmath69 and @xmath70 ) , obtained through the numerical evaluation of the landau dispersion function roots , are shown as black squares .",
    "we emphasize that the spectrum of the matrix @xmath45 differs from the spectrum of the infinite - dimensional vlasov - poisson - lb operator .",
    "in fact , while for the latter the landau root is a discrete eigenvalue in the limit @xmath71 , figure 2 clearly shows that , in the presence of a finite velocity resolution , a small collisionality acts to distort the discrete representation of the case - van kampen continuum . in other words , a sufficiently large collisionality value ( depending on the velocity resolution ) is needed in order to recover the landau root as a discrete mode .",
    "indeed , it is clear that , for @xmath72 ( gold points ) , the spectrum exhibits two eigenvalues overlapping with the proper landau roots value and , therefore , the proper landau damping is restored .    in order to clarify the behavior of the coefficients @xmath62 in the case where the collisionality restores the proper landau damping ( i.e. @xmath72 ) , we show in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] the temporal evolution of the hermite coefficients @xmath62 .",
    "clearly the reflecting effect discussed for fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] has now completely vanished and the electric field damping does not show any recurrence . since the collisional operator damps the high hermite modes or , in other words , since collisional effects stop the production of small velocity scales , the velocity filamentation is not correctly captured .",
    "= 8.5 cm    in order to complete our analysis , we numerically solve eqs .",
    " through the finite - difference numerical code presented earlier , for different values of the collisional frequency @xmath3 .",
    "we set the initial sinusoidal density perturbation such that the perturbation electric field amplitude is @xmath73 .",
    "the phase space is discretized with @xmath74 and @xmath75 points .",
    "let us remark that , with the parameters choice just described , the recurrence time is @xmath76 .    the time evolution of the logarithm of the absolute value of the first fourier component @xmath77 of the electric field @xmath78 is shown in fig .",
    "the black , red and blue lines correspond respectively to the collisionless case ( @xmath79 ) , intermediate collisional case ( @xmath80 ) and stronger collisional case ( @xmath81 ) .",
    "the last case is the case in which the landau damping root is recovered in the spectrum shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , thanks to the effect of collisions .",
    "the red and blue dashed lines in fig . [ fig4 ] indicates the theoretical landau damping rate @xmath82 and the recurrence time @xmath83 respectively .",
    "for the three cases , the electric field spectral component evolution is approximately the same for @xmath84 and the electric field is damped at the proper landau damping rate @xmath85 .",
    "then , around @xmath83 , the collisionless and the intermediate collisional cases ( black and red solid lines of fig",
    ". [ fig4 ] ) present a fake `` jump '' in the signal due to the initial state recurrence problem . on the other hand , in the stronger collisional case @xmath72 ( blue solid line of fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ) , the recurrence effect disappears and the unphysical `` jump '' is completely suppressed by collisional effects .",
    "it is worth to note that , in this case , the recurrence does not occur neither at times multiples of the recurrence period .",
    "= 8.5 cm    based on the results presented above , the inclusion of a weakly collisional operator to prevent the numerical recurrence effect might look convenient ; however , the consequences of including collisionality into the vlasov - poisson system must be investigated with care .",
    "figure [ fig5 ] shows the difference between the damping rate @xmath86 of the least damped mode and the damping rate @xmath87 of the landau root , as a function of the collisional rate @xmath3 , for three different values of @xmath88 , ( black , red and blue line , respectively ) .",
    "as explained in figure [ fig2 ] , for @xmath89 , and fixed velocity resolution , the case - van kampen spectrum @xcite is recovered ( see fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) , and @xmath90 .",
    "the intersection between the red dashed and the solid lines indicates the value of collisionality that is required to recover the correct landau damping as a discrete eigenmode .",
    "moreover , bearing in mind that both @xmath86 and @xmath87 are negative quantities , values above the red - dashed line in the figure indicate that the collisional rate is not large enough to recover the landau damping as the least damped eigenvalue , while values below the red - dashed line indicate over - damping with respect to the landau damping .",
    "figure [ fig5 ] clearly indicates that there is not a single value of collisionality that would allow to recover the correct landau damping for a spectrum of several wavenumbers .",
    "since larger wavenumbers are subject to stronger damping , they would require a larger collisional rate    moreover , if the initial field amplitude is increased in order to explore the nonlinear evolution of the landau damping , the collisionality , which was able of preventing recurrence in the linear simulation , becomes strong enough to smooth the nonlinear physical features of the landau damping . in order to clarify this point",
    ", we perform a simulation with the same parameters of the linear one explained above ( see fig . [ fig4 ] ) and we increase @xmath91 . figure [ fig6 ] ( a ) shows the time evolution of @xmath78 for @xmath77 for the collisionless case ( black solid line ) and for the collisional case @xmath92 ( red solid line ) . the blue dashed line in fig . [ fig6 ] indicates the recurrence period @xmath76 .",
    "we remark that this specific value of collisional frequency is the one which prevents recurrence effects in the linear case , still preserving the correct value of landau damping .",
    "it is clear that , in the non - linear collisionless case , the landau damping is arrested by nonlinear effects ( particle trapping ) and , as a consequence , the electric field starts oscillating around a nearly constant saturation level . on the other hand , in the collisional case",
    ", the physical scenario changes drastically and the electric field amplitude displays evident collisional damping .    in phase space , nonlinear effects manifest as the generation of a vortical trapping population , moving with velocity close to the wave phase speed ( @xmath93 ) .",
    "this is shown in figs [ fig6 ] ( b)(c ) where the contour plots of the distribution function @xmath94 at time @xmath95 for the collisionless case ( b ) and for the collisional case ( c ) are reported .",
    "it is clear from the comparison of panels ( b ) and ( c ) of fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] that collisions prevent the generation of the phase - space trapping population , since they work to smooth out any deformation of the particle distribution function and to drive the system toward thermal equilibrium . in other words , as soon as kinetic effects produce distortions ( and , consequently , sharp velocity gradients ) of the particle distribution , collisional effects become more intense to keep the velocity distribution close to a maxwellian .",
    "therefore , it is quite clear that collisional effects are not able to prevent the recurrence problem without destroying the plasma dynamics characteristics .    in order to understand whether changing the resolution in velocity space @xcite affects the physical features of the system , we performed additional simulations in collisionless regime , increasing the number of gridpoints in the velocity domain : @xmath96 ; @xmath75 [ indicated with blue crosses in figs .",
    "[ fig7 ] ( a  b ) ] corresponds to the case depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] .",
    "we computed the following quantities as `` proxies '' of numerical accuracy :    * the oscillation period @xmath97 of the wave , evaluated in the time interval @xmath98 ) ; * the time @xmath99 where the electric field envelope reaches its first maximum [ @xmath100 in fig .",
    "[ fig6](a ) ] ; * the oscillation period @xmath101 of the electric field envelope , defined as the average of the difference between two consecutive maximum points in the @xmath102 at which the electric field spectral power saturates .",

    "the relative variations between the values obtained with @xmath75 and the corresponding saturation values ( red dashed lines ) are about the @xmath106 for @xmath105 and @xmath107 for @xmath101 . we conclude that even in the nonlinear case shown in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] the limited resolution in the velocity domain slightly affects the physical evolution of the system .",

    "[ fig1 ] for the landau damping , the filamentation creates small velocity scales and , due to the truncation of the hermite series - which corresponds , in the eulerian code , to the presence of a finite velocity grid size - the boundary reflects back the perturbation towards lower modes .",

    "first , phase space structures obtained in the cases with recurrence are less resolved compared to the one of the recurrence - free case and this is obviously related to the different velocity grid size : effectively , since the velocity grid size is smaller in the recurrence - free case , finer scales are naturally created compared to the cases at lower resolution .",
    "moreover , the vortex width seems to be slightly wider in the @xmath75 case [ fig .",
    "[ fig10 ] ( e ) ] compared to both the collisionless recurrence - free case [ fig .",
    "[ fig9 ] ( b ) ] and to the @xmath123 case [ fig .",
    "[ fig10 ] ( f ) ] . in other words , since the electric field does not saturate in presence of recursive effects , the phase space structure tends to increase its width .",
    "the effects of the initial state recurrence on the bump - on - tail instability represents a novel and quite unexpected feature in the analysis of the recursive phenomena . both linear and nonlinear stages of the instability are affected by recurrence : the electric field evolution departs from the evolution in the case without recurrence ( @xmath125 ) around @xmath138 .",
    "furthermore the nonlinear saturation , which is properly retained in the case at high resolution , is interrupted by recurrence as the velocity grid size gets larger .",
    "moreover , due to the absence of the electric field saturation , the distribution function shows a vortex properly centered around the right phase speed but whose width tends to be bigger compared to the case without recurrence .",
    "finally , although initial state recurrence phenomena are often related to linear physical problems , here we have found some new and interesting recurrence effect features which occur in the nonlinear regime .    in order to explore",
    "if a collisionality described by the lb operator could represent a good way to prevent numerical recurrence in the case of the bump - on - tail instability , we focus on the @xmath123 resolution case ad we perform several collisional simulations by changing the collisional frequency @xmath3",
    ".    figs .",
    "[ fig11 ] ( a)(c ) display , through black lines , the temporal evolution of @xmath132 with @xmath77 for the cases : @xmath141 ( a ) , @xmath142 ( b ) and @xmath143 ( c ) . in each panel of fig .",
    "[ fig11 ] red solid lines indicate the evolution in the collisionless case without recurrence [ the same shown in fig .",
    "[ fig9 ] ( a ) and in figs .",
    "[ fig10 ] ( a)(b ) ] while the red dashed line shows the theoretical expectation for the instability growth curve @xmath144 , being @xmath145 .",
    "as expected , collisions inhibit the instability and tend to restore thermal equilibrium .",
    "however in the case @xmath141 [ see fig .",
    "[ fig11 ] ( a ) ] , collisions weakly affect the electric field evolution which , as in the collisionless case , do not saturate and overtake the recurrence - free case evolution [ red line in fig .",
    "[ fig11 ] ( a ) ] .    as collisional frequency increases",
    ", the electric field evolution tends to be dissipated . in the intermediate case @xmath142",
    "[ see fig .",
    "[ fig11 ] ( b ) ] , the electric field reaches , at the end of the simulation , almost the same power of the collisionless case without recurrence ; however its evolution departs from the reference red curve around @xmath146 , where the recurrence - free case [ red line in fig .",
    "[ fig11 ] ( b ) ] presents a stronger power level than the collisional @xmath123 case [ black line in fig .",
    "[ fig11 ] ( b ) ] . on the other hand , in the case @xmath143",
    "[ see fig .",
    "[ fig11 ] ( c ) ] , a significant difference between the two evolutions appears at even smaller time instants and collisions clearly affect the linear instability regime . in particular , the linear growth rate in the collisional @xmath123 case [ black line in fig .",
    "[ fig11 ] ( c ) ] is significantly smaller than the collisionless @xmath125 case [ red line in fig .",
    "[ fig11 ] ( c ) ] .",
    "moreover , as in the collisionless recurrence - free case , at the final stages of the simulation the electric field spectral power exhibits an almost flat behavior at a lower power value compared to the collisionless recurrence - free case .    in order to point out how phase space is affected by collisions , figs .",
    "[ fig12 ] ( a)(c ) show the contour plots of the distribution function @xmath137 at the final time instant @xmath133 and zoomed around the phase speed @xmath134 for the cases : @xmath141 ( a ) , @xmath142 ( b ) and @xmath147 ( c ) . as in fig .",
    "[ fig10 ] ( e)(f ) , even in fig .",
    "[ fig12 ] ( a)(c ) we performed an interpolation of the distribution function over a more resolved grid .",
    "in all the three cases shown in fig . [ fig12 ]",
    "( a)(c ) a phase space structure is observed around the wave phase speed and its width reduces as collisional frequency increases .",
    "clearly as collisions become stronger , phase space structures are smoothed out and present a smaller size .    to conclude this section",
    ", we highlight that , as collisional frequency gets bigger , the instability is affected by collisions more intensely .",
    "moreover , since collisions tend to restore the equilibrium , they have been active since the initial stage of the simulation ( the initial distribution function is out of equilibrium ) .",
    "furthermore they remain active until the equilibrium is recovered and incessantly work to smooth out all the wave features ( electric field signal and phase space structures ) .",
    "therefore , at longer times ( not shown here ) , the phase space structures shown in figs . [ fig12 ] get smaller and disappear , while the electric field signal shown in figs .",
    "[ fig11 ] is dissipated by collisional effects .",
    "we conclude that , as in the nonlinear landau damping case , an artificial collisionality is not able to prevent the initial state recurrence in the bump - on - tail instability onset .",
    "in particular we found two different scenarios : collisions are so weak that recurrence is still active or , on the other hand , they affect both recurrence effects and physical evolution of the system by deeply smoothing the electric field and the phase space structure .",
    "in this paper we analyzed in detail the problem of the initial state recurrence in a weakly collisional plasma , where electron - electron collisions have been modeled through the lenard - bernstein collisional operator @xcite .",
    "we focused on two study cases : the landau damping of a langmuir wave and the bump - on - tail instability onset .",
    "for both cases , the analysis in the linear regime has been performed through the decomposition of the linear vlasov - poisson system into the fourier - hermite space . in particular , the expansion of the distribution function in terms of hermite functions separates naturally different velocity scales and it allows to better describe recursive effects and appreciate the role of the collisional operator in phase space .",
    "moreover , the analysis has been extended to the nonlinear regime through a 1d1v eulerian collisional vlasov - poisson code , already tested and used in previous works ( see refs .",
    "@xcite ) .    recently",
    "some authors ( see refs . @xcite and references therein ) pointed out that an opportune collisionality can prevent the onset of recursive effects and restore the correct landau damping .",
    "this indication suggested us to investigate whether the inclusion of an artificial collisionality could be used to prevent recurrence in numerical simulations without the loss of physical details due to collisional effects .",
    "however , we have shown that the collisional frequency @xmath3 which is suitable for preventing numerical recurrence in the linear regime depends on the perturbation wavenumber ; furthermore , collisional effects become important when the system evolves to the nonlinear regime and , for the same value of collisionality which prevents recursive effects in the linear stage , any nonlinear wave is strongly dissipated by collisional effects .    finally , we pointed out that numerical effects associated to the generation of fine velocity scales can modify the physical features of the system evolution even in nonlinear regime .",
    "this has been shown by focusing on the nonlinear landau damping phenomenon and on the bump - on - tail instability both in linear and nonlinear regime .",
    "our results indicate that filamentation - like and recursive effects , often associated with evolution in linear regime , can also be important in the nonlinear case .",
    "we also conclude that the addition of a collisional operator , with the aim of preventing the recurrence of the initial state and other numerical effects related to limited resolution in the velocity domain , significantly changes the evolution of nonlinear waves and the corresponding phase space portrait .",
