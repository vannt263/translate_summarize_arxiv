    "dark matter halos serve as building blocks in the structure formation in the universe .",
    "while the spherical assumption for shapes of dark matter halos has been widely used both in theoretical and observational researches , a number of observations and cosmological simulations has exhibited clear signatures of the non - sphericity of dark matter halos .",
    "it is conventionally accepted that the primordial density fluctuations in the early universe obey the gaussian random field , and they have a definite statistical signature of the non - sphericity @xcite .",
    "one prescription for the non - spherical evolution of such primordial density fluctuations is given by the ellipsoidal collapse model ( hereafter ec ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . by taking account of the non - spherical evolution of halos",
    ", @xcite found that the mass function fits better the simulation results than that of spherical prediction based on the press - schechter theory @xcite .",
    "the improved quality of observational data demands more accurate theoretical models of the non - sphericity of halos beyond the simple ec prediction",
    ". however , purely theoretical description of the non - spherical structure and evolution of dark matter halos is very difficult due to the non - linear evolution and complicated interactions among dark matter within the highly inhomogeneous density distribution .",
    "therefore cosmological n - body simulations play key roles in investigating the non - sphericity of halos .",
    "in fact , many authors have recently studied the non - sphericity of halos extracted from cosmological n - body simulations @xcite .",
    "in particular , @xcite ( hereafter js02 ) modelled simulated halos by triaxial ellipsoids , and found that their minor - to - major axis ratio follows a universal probability distribution function ( pdf ) that depends on redshift and mass .",
    "@xcite found that the pdf of js02 contradicts the prediction of ec with the gaussian random initial conditions ; while massive halos are more spherical in ec , they are less spherical in js02 .",
    "@xcite and @xcite performed improved n - body simulations for halos with higher resolution in a wider mass range , and they confirmed that their results basically reproduce js02 , still in disagreement with ec .    even from the existing observation data , the non - sphericity of halos is already detectable especially for galaxy clusters in x - ray and optical bands . since observational analyses are based on the density distribution of halos _ projected on the sky _ , the projected ( two - dimensional ) non - sphericity is more relevant quantity than the three - dimensional one .",
    "in fact , @xcite ( hereafter ols03 ) calculated the pdf of projected axis ratio by integrating the pdf of js02 .",
    "then they showed that the observed excess of gravitationally lensed arcs relative to the spherical model prediction can be reconciled by taking into account the effect of the non - sphericity of lensing halos .",
    "the pdf of the non - sphericity has been also observationally examined , although the observational uncertainty is large at this stage .",
    "the weak lensing study by @xcite showed that their 18 clusters have a pdf of ellipticity barely consistent with that proposed by js02 .",
    "the 70 x - ray clusters analyzed by @xcite with the hydrostatic equilibrium assumption also produced a roughly consistent result with js02 . at this stage , the available data is limited and the observational uncertainty is large . in the near future , however , especially subaru hyper suprime - cam will provide us with a number of highly resolved lensing halos that are suitable for non - spherical analyses .",
    "we emphasize that the pdf of js02 , and therefore that of ols03 assume the self - similarity of the halo structure ; the density distribution of halos is approximated by concentric ellipsoids with the same axis ratio and orientation",
    ". as js02 have already indicated , however , the simulated halos are not necessarily self - similar . in order to fully utilize the data by future observations , an improved model of",
    "the projected axis ratio is quite important .",
    "therefore , our goal in this paper is to find an empirical fitting formula for the pdf of projected axis ratio of dark matter halos without assuming their self - similarity . for that purpose ,",
    "we analyze 2004 halos extracted from n - body simulation , and approximate the density distribution around each simulated halo and its protohalos by triaxial ellipsoids . to better understand the non - spherical evolution of the halos , we first compare the evolution of individual halos with the ec prediction .",
    "next we statistically examine the mass dependence and the radial profile of axis ratio of the simulated halos , and identify how and when the difference between ec and simulations emerges .",
    "importantly , we find that the self - similarity assumption for halos adopted in the previous studies ( js02 ; ols03 ) is not accurate , and that the prediction of the projected non - sphericity of dark matter halos is significantly affected by the assumption .",
    "therefore we calculate the pdf of the projected axis ratio directly from the simulation data .",
    "this is exactly what we aim at in this paper .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section 2 describes our n - body simulation and how to follow the evolution of our simulated halos .",
    "we compare the evolution of individual halos with ec in section 3 .",
    "section 4 discusses the statistical evolution of halo non - sphericity . in section 5 , we present the pdf of axis ratio of halos in three - dimensional space , and its two - dimensional counterparts are constructed .",
    "finally section 6 summarizes this paper .",
    "throughout this paper , we use cluster - scale halos identified from a cosmological n - body simulation .",
    "the details of the simulation and the halo - finding procedures are described in this subsection .",
    "we start the simulation at @xmath2 , where @xmath3 particles distributed in a periodic cube with a side length of 360 @xmath4 ( comoving ) .",
    "their initial conditions are generated with a parallel code developed by @xcite and @xcite , which is based on the second - order lagrangian perturbation theory @xcite .",
    "we employ the matter transfer function computed by a linear boltzmann solver ` camb ` @xcite for a flat @xmath5cdm cosmology with the nine - year wmap parameters @xcite ; @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and @xmath9 are the current matter density in units of the critical density , the hubble constant in units of @xmath10 , the scalar spectral index , and the amplitude of the density fluctuation ( linearly extrapolated to the present ) smoothed with a top - hat filter of radius 8 @xmath4 , respectively . with the above parameters , mass of each simulation particle @xmath11 is @xmath12 , which is sufficient to resolve massive halos ( @xmath13 ) at @xmath0 .",
    "the particle distribution is then evolved using a publicly available parallel cosmological @xmath14-body solver ` gadget2 ` @xcite .",
    "the long - range gravitational force is computed on @xmath15 mesh points based on the fast fourier transform , while we rely on the tree algorithm with the softening length of @xmath16 on short range .",
    "we store snapshots at redshifts @xmath17 , 9 , 5 , 4 , 3 , 2 , 1.5 , 1 , 0.8 , 0.6 , 0.4 , 0.2 , 0.1 and 0 .",
    "halos at @xmath0 are identified using the friends - of - friends ( ` fof ` ) algorithm @xcite with the linking length of @xmath18 times the mean inter - particle separation in one dimension .",
    "this length is chosen so that the corresponding virial overdensity @xmath19 matches 355.4 in units of the cosmic mean density at @xmath0 , which is motivated by the spherical collapse model @xcite .",
    "indeed , we confirmed that the total mass of the linked particles @xmath20 approximately corresponds to the virial mass @xmath21 .",
    "we further apply the ` subfind ` algorithm @xcite implemented in @xcite for each fof halo to identify substructures as well as unbound particles .    in this paper",
    ", we use the fof halos with @xmath22 , corresponding to the mass range of galaxy clusters which are well resolved in optical and x - ray observations .",
    "the total number of those halos is 2004 .      before modelling the 2004 simulated halos by triaxial ellipsoids",
    ", we classify the halos by the amount of substructures .",
    "this is useful in understanding the extent to which the definition of the non - sphericity of the fof halos is sensitive to the presence of substructures .    due to the nature of the fof algorithm ,",
    "an fof halo may comprise two or more prominent components .",
    "such a halo tends to yield higher non - sphericity , which should be distinguished from a very elongated _ single _ structure .    according to the result of the subfind algorithm",
    ", we obtain the mass @xmath23 of the @xmath24-th most massive component for each fof halo .",
    "the most massive component ( @xmath25 ) is called the `` main halo '' , and we call the other components `` substructures '' . since the shape of a cluster is expected to be sensitive to a few prominent substructures , we classify halos according to the values of @xmath26 and @xmath27 , instead of the total mass fraction of substructures . we note that this classification is free from numerical resolutions because such big substructures are all well - resolved in the current simulation .",
    "the upper - left , upper - right and lower - left panels of figure [ class ] show the snapshots of fof member particles of three halos with different morphology .",
    "the halo in the upper - left panel has very small values of @xmath26 and @xmath27 , representing a single isolated structure .",
    "in contrast , the halo in the upper - right panel has relatively large @xmath26 and small @xmath27 , corresponding to a `` double - structure '' .",
    "the third halo in the lower - left panel has relatively large values both for @xmath26 and @xmath27 , and is classified as a `` triple - structure '' .",
    "the lower - right panel of figure [ class ] indicates the cumulative fraction of the halos with a given threshold of @xmath26 or @xmath27 .",
    "the majority of our halos have small @xmath26 , and @xmath28 is substantially smaller than @xmath29",
    ". thus the multiplicity of most of the halos can be characterized by the value of @xmath26 .",
    "for later convenience , we set the threshold of @xmath30 , and call a halo with @xmath31 a `` single - halo '' .",
    "also , a halo with @xmath32 is referred to as a `` multiple - halo '' .",
    "then the halos in the upper - right and the lower - left panels of figure [ class ] are multiple - halos . such multiple - halos occupy approximately 10 % of all the 2004 halos .",
    "the threshold @xmath30 is somewhat arbitrary . according to the right panel of figure [ class ] ,",
    "if we set the threshold by @xmath33 , for example , @xmath34 20 % of our sample are classified as multiple - halos .",
    "as will be seen in the later sections , the choice of the threshold does not make a major difference in the main results of this paper .",
    "table 1 lists the number of the single- and multiple - halos out of our sample , corresponding to the threshold @xmath30 .",
    ".the numbers of single- and multiple - halos , where @xmath35 and @xmath29 are the masses of the main halo and the most massive substructure . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      as an example of possible applications of our fitting formula for the pdf of projected axis ratio @xmath1 , we attempt to compare it with the pdf for the observed halos estimated by @xcite .",
    "they measured the projected axis ratio from the weak lensing shear map of 18 clusters .",
    "in doing so , they assumed that the three - dimensional density distribution inside each halo follows a self - similar triaxial ellipsoid .",
    "the observed region of their clusters roughly corresponds to @xmath36 , and their mean redshift is 0.23 , so we compare their observation data with our model for @xmath36 of all the halos and @xmath37 in table 2 .",
    "the mean virial mass @xmath21 of our sample is roughly @xmath38 .",
    "the left panel of figure [ oguri ] plots the pdf of projected axis ratio of the observed halos in red symbols with error bars .",
    "@xcite compared this observational results with the pdf of ols03 calculated by assuming @xmath39 in equation ( [ js ] ) , corresponding to the mean mass of the observed clusters .",
    "we also plot the same pdf in the blue curve .",
    "in addition , our model is plotted in the black curve .",
    "the mean mass of our sample is smaller than that of @xcite , but this is not serious since the mass dependence of axis ratio @xmath1 is very weak ( figure [ a1a2evol ] ) .    in order to include the possible effect of the observational uncertainty in @xmath1 , @xcite convolved the pdf of ols03 with the gaussian function with @xmath40 , corresponding to the typical uncertainty of the measurement of the axis ratio ( cf .",
    "table 1 of @xcite ) .",
    "we repeated the same procedure for the pdf of ols03 and our fitting formula .",
    "the resulting pdfs are plotted in the right panel of figure [ oguri ] . because of the large observational error bars , it is difficult to distinguish the pdf of ols03 and our fitting formula .",
    "our fitting formula is , however , based on the direct measurement of @xmath1 of the simulated halos , and therefore more reliable than that of ols03 based on the self - similarity of halos . in the near future ,",
    "precise observational data of numerous clusters will be provided by subaru hyper suprime - cam , for example . in order to perform much more precise comparison of observational data and theory",
    ", one should adopt the same estimator of the projected axis lengths both for observations and simulations .",
    "hence more elaborate analyses will be a useful tool to test the non - sphericity of halos predicted in the cdm cosmology .",
    "our current results are indeed towards such a purpose .",
    "we have studied the redshift evolution , and the mass- and radial - dependence of non - sphericity by analyzing halos from a cosmological n - body simulation .",
    "we approximated the density distribution of the halos by triaxial ellipsoids , employing the mass tensor @xmath41 ( equation ( [ ixx ] ) ) .",
    "our major findings are summarized as follows .    1 .   for the first time",
    ", we compared the evolution of the axis lengths @xmath42 ( @xmath43 , 2 , 3 ) of the triaxial ellipsoids of individual simulated halos with the prediction of the ellipsoidal collapse model ( ec ) _ on the object - wise basis_. in general , the ec prediction roughly reproduces the simulation up to the turn - around epoch ( @xmath44 ) . after the turn - around epoch",
    ", however , the simulation substantially deviates from the ec prediction .",
    "the discrepancy in the statistical mass dependence of axis ratio @xmath45 at @xmath0 between the ec prediction and simulations has been reported in literature ; massive halos are more spherical in ec , but those in simulations tend to be less spherical .",
    "for the first time , we demonstrated how and when the statistical mass dependence of @xmath45 of the simulated halos deviates from ec .",
    "while massive halos are more spherical initially , they gradually become less spherical after the turn - around epoch .",
    "this tendency is opposite to the ec prediction .",
    "the averaged axis ratio @xmath46 over all the simulated halos has significant radial dependence as a function of enclosed mass @xmath47 . at @xmath48 , @xmath49",
    "rapidly decreases due to filamentary structures around the halos . inside @xmath50 , the radial dependence of @xmath49 gradually",
    "changes with time ; while @xmath49 increases toward the inner region at @xmath51 , it decreases at @xmath0 .",
    "the radial dependence of @xmath49 indicates that the halos are not necessarily self - similar ( concentric , common axis ratio and orientation ) .",
    "we examined how the probability distribution function ( pdf ) of @xmath45 of triaxial halos at @xmath0 depends on @xmath47 .",
    "the values of @xmath49 at @xmath52 is smaller than that of js02 who employ the isodensity surface at @xmath53 ( roughly corresponding to the region of @xmath54 ) and adopt the self - similarity assumption .",
    "the difference is partly due to the different methods of triaxial modelling of halos ; mass tensor and isodensity surface .",
    "the projected axis ratio @xmath1 is a more relevant quantity to compare with observational data , and we find that it is sensitive to the self - similarity assumption as well .",
    "therefore we calculated the pdf of @xmath1 , not through those of three - dimensional @xmath45 , but directly from the projected density distributions of the simulated halos for the first time .",
    "we provide a fitting formula for the resulting pdf , and show that the formula improves those in previous studies that assume the self - similarity of halos .",
    "hence our fitting formula will play important roles in interpreting the future data of subaru hyper suprime - cam among others .",
    "our current analysis is based on the dark - matter only simulation , which is reasonably justified in applying to weak - lensing observations . in a complementary fashion , x - ray observations of intracluster gas",
    "provide independent information on the non - sphericity of clusters .",
    "the density distribution of gas is , however , not necessarily identical to that of dark matter @xcite .",
    "therefore , in order to study the non - sphericity of the gas density distribution without additional assumptions like hydrostatic equilibrium , hydrodynamical simulations including gas are needed .",
    "this is what we are currently working on , and will be presented elsewhere .",
    "we thank an anonymous referee for many valuable comments . we gratefully acknowledge fruitful discussions with benedikt diemer , hajime kawahara , surhud more , masamune oguri and sbastien peirani .",
