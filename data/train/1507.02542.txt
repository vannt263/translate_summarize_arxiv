    "the euler - bernoulli beam ( ebb ) equation with tip mass is a well - established model with a wide range of applications : for oscillations in telecommunication antennas , or satellites with flexible appendages @xcite , flexible wings of micro air vehicles @xcite , and even vibrations of tall buildings due to external forces @xcite .",
    "the interest of engineers and mathematicians in the corresponding control problems started in the 1980s .",
    "so various boundary control laws have been devised and mathematically analyzed in the literature  with the stabilization of the system being a key objective ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) . soon afterwards , also exponentially stable controllers were developed which require , however , higher order boundary controls for an ebb with both applied tip mass and moment of inertia @xcite . on the other hand , if only a tip mass is applied , lower order controls are sufficient for exponential stabilization @xcite . in spite of this progress , and due to its widespread technological applications , considerable research on ebb - control problems is still underway : in the more recent papers @xcite exponential stability of related control systems was established by verifying the riesz basis property . for the exponential stability of a more general class of boundary control systems ( including the timoshenko beam ) in the port - hamiltonian approach we refer to @xcite",
    ".    we shall analyze an inhomogeneous multi - layered piezoelectric ebb with applied tip mass and moment of inertia , coupled to a dynamic controller that uses only low order boundary measurements .",
    "this system was introduced by kugi and thull in @xcite to independently control the tip position and the tip angle of a piezoelectric cantilever along prescribed trajectories .",
    "this beam is composed of piezoelectric layers and the electrode shape of the layers was used as an additional degree of freedom in the controller design .",
    "the sensor layers were given rectangular and triangular shaped electrodes , so that the charge measured is proportional to the tip deflection and the tip angle , respectively .",
    "the actuator layers were also assumed to be covered with rectangular and triangular shaped electrodes , with the following motivation : a voltage supplied to an actuator with rectangular ( or triangular ) shaped electrodes acts in the same way on the structure as a bending moment ( or force ) at the tip of the beam .",
    "the key issue of @xcite was to devise a stable feedback control model for that beam , such that it evolves asymptotically ( as @xmath1 ) as a prescribed reference trajectory .",
    "more precisely , that controller allows to track the position and the angle of the tip mass at the same time . to solve the trajectory planning task , the concept of differential flatness ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) was employed .",
    "thereby , the control inputs and the beam bending deflection were parametrized by the flat outputs and their time derivatives .",
    "the boundary controller constructed there has a dynamic design , thus coupling the governing pdes of the beam with a system of odes in the feedback part . in order to render the system experimentally and technically realizable ,",
    "it is crucial that the controller only involves boundary measurements up to the first spatial derivative  at the ( small ) price of loosing _ exponential _ stability ( as we shall see here below ) .",
    "the goal of the present paper is first to complete the analysis of @xcite , proving that this hybrid system is asymptotically stable but _ not _ exponentially stable .",
    "this part is an extension of rao s analysis @xcite to dynamic controllers and inhomogeneous beams . in our second , and in fact",
    "main part we shall develop and analyze a dissipative finite element method ( fem ) for the control system .",
    "now we specify the problem under consideration , an inhomogeneous ebb of length @xmath2 , clamped at the left end @xmath3 , and with tip mass , moment of inertia , and boundary control at @xmath4 . in the following linear system ( [ model1])([model5 ] ) , we actually consider the evolution of the trajectory error system .",
    "so , @xmath5 denotes the deviation of the actual beam deflection from the desired reference trajectory .",
    "similarly , @xmath6 denote the difference between the applied voltages to the electrodes of the piezoelectric layers and the ones specified by the feedforward controller .",
    "@xmath7 here , @xmath8 $ ] denotes the linear mass density of the beam and @xmath9 $ ] is the flexural rigidity of the beam .",
    "both functions are assumed to be strictly positive and bounded .",
    "@xmath10 and @xmath11 denote , respectively , the mass and the moment of inertia of the rigid body attached at @xmath4 . equation ( [ model4 ] ) states that the beam bending moment at @xmath4 ( i.e.  @xmath12 ) plus the bending moment of the tip body ( i.e.  @xmath13 ) is balanced by the control input @xmath14 . similarly , ( [ model5 ] ) describes that the total force at the free end , equal to shear force at the tip ( i.e.  @xmath15 ) plus the tip mass force @xmath16 , cancels with the control input @xmath17 .",
    "the proposed control law has the goal to drive the error system to the zero state as @xmath1 .",
    "it reads : @xmath18 with the auxiliary variables @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "moreover , @xmath21 are hurwitz matrices , @xmath22 vectors and @xmath23 .",
    "we assume that the coefficients @xmath24 and @xmath25 are positive and that the transfer functions @xmath26 satisfy @xmath27 for some constants @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "these assumptions imply that the transfer function is strictly positive real , or shortly spr ( for its definition we refer to @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "then , it follows from the kalman - yakubovic - popov lemma ( see @xcite , @xcite ) that there exist symmetric positive definite matrices @xmath30 , positive scalars @xmath31 , and vectors @xmath32 such that @xmath33 for @xmath34 a spr controller is defined as a controller with spr transfer function .",
    "one motivation for this controller design is the fact that , in the finite dimensional case , the feedback interconnection of a passive system with a spr controller yields a stable closed - loop system .",
    "this principle of passivity based controller design was generalized to the trajectory error dynamics of the multi - layered piezoelectric cantilever in @xcite .",
    "( [ model1])([control_law ] ) constitute a coupled pde ",
    "ode system for the beam deflection @xmath35 , the position of its tip @xmath36 , and its slope @xmath37 , as well as the two control variables @xmath38 , @xmath39 .",
    "the main mathematical difficulty of this system stems from the high order boundary conditions ( involving both @xmath40- and @xmath41- derivatives ) which makes the analytical and numerical treatment far from obvious .",
    "well - posedness of this system and asymptotic stability of the zero state were established in @xcite using semigroup theory on an equivalent first order system ( in time ) , a carefully designed lyapunov functional , and lasalle s invariance principle .    in  [ s2 ]",
    "we shall prove that this unique steady state is _ not _ exponentially stable .",
    "let us compare this result to a similar system studied in @xcite and  5.3 of @xcite , which also consists of an ebb coupled to a passivity based dynamic boundary control , but without the tip mass .",
    "then , that system is exponentially stable .    as an introduction for our dissipative finite element method ( fem ) in  [ s - fem ]",
    ", we shall now briefly review several numerical strategies for the ebb from the literature . in @xcite",
    "the authors propose a conditionally stable , central difference method for both the space and time discretization of the ebb equation .",
    "their system models a beam , which has a tip mass with moment of inertia on the free end . at the fixed end a boundary control is applied in form of a control torque . due to higher order boundary conditions ,",
    "fictitious nodes are needed at both boundaries . in @xcite",
    "the authors consider a damped , translationally cantilevered ebb , with one end clamped into a moving base ( as a boundary control ) and a tip mass with moment of inertia placed at the other . for their numerical treatment",
    "they considered a finite number of modes , thus obtaining an ode system . in @xcite the ebb with one free end ( without tip mass , but with boundary torque control ) was solved in the frequency domain : after laplace transformation in time , the resulting odes could be solved explicitly .",
    "the more elaborate approaches are based on fems : in @xcite two space - time spectral element methods are employed to solve a simply supported , nonlinear , modified ebb subjected to forced lateral vibrations but with no mass attached : there , hermitian polynomials , both in space and time , lead to strict stability limitations . but",
    "a mixed discontinuous galerkin formulation with hermitian cubic polynomials in space and lagrangian spectral polynomials in time yields an unconditionally stable scheme . in @xcite",
    "the authors present a semi - discrete ( using cubic splines ) and fully discrete galerkin scheme ( based on the crank - nicolson method ) for the strongly damped , extensible beam equation with both ends hinged .",
    "@xcite considers a ebb with tip mass at the free end , yielding a conservative hyperbolic system .",
    "the authors analyze a cubic b - spline based galerkin method ( including convergence analysis of the spatial semi - discretization ) and put special emphasis on the subsequent parameter identification problem .",
    "all these fems are for models _ without boundary control_. hence , we shall develop here a novel fem for the mixed boundary control problem ( [ model1])-([control_law ] ) .",
    "there , the damping only appears due to the boundary control .",
    "hence , our main focus will be on preserving the correct large - time behavior ( i.e.  dissipativity ) in the numerical scheme .",
    "our fem is based on the second order ( in time ) ebb equation ( [ model1 ] ) and special care is taken for the boundary coupling to the ode . in time we shall use a crank - nicolson discretization , which was also the appropriate approach for the decay of discretized parabolic equations in @xcite .",
    "we remark that the modeling and discretization of boundary control systems as port - hamiltonian systems also has this flavor of preserving the structure : for a general methodology on this spatial semi - discretization ( leading to mixed finite elements ) and its application to the telegrapher s equations we refer to @xcite .    the paper is organized as follows : in  [ s2 ]",
    "we first review the analytic setting from @xcite for the ebb with boundary control . while this closed - loop system is asymptotically stable , we prove that it is _ not _ exponentially stable . towards this analysis",
    "we derive the asymptotic behavior of the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the coupled system . in  [ s - fem ]",
    "we first discuss the weak formulation of our control system .",
    "then we develop an unconditionally stable fem ( along with a crank - nicolson scheme in time ) , which dissipates an appropriate energy functional independently of the chosen fem basis .",
    "we shall also derive error estimates ( second order in space and time ) of our scheme .",
    "in the numerical simulations of  [ s - simul ] we illustrate the proposed method and verify its order of convergence w.r.t . @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "first we recall from @xcite the analytical setting for ( [ model1])([control_law ] ) in the framework of semigroup theory . to cope with the higher order boundary conditions , and the boundary terms on the r.h.s .  of ( [ control_law ] ) , the terms @xmath44 , @xmath45 were introduced as separate variables ( following the spirit in earlier works @xcite ) .",
    "more precisely , @xmath46 is the vertical momentum of the tip mass and @xmath47 its angular momentum , where @xmath48 is the velocity of the beam .",
    "hence , we define the hilbert space @xmath49 where @xmath50 , with the inner product @xmath51 and @xmath52 denotes the corresponding norm .",
    "let @xmath53 be a linear operator with the domain @xmath54 defined by @xmath55 = \\left [ \\begin{array}{c } v \\\\ - \\frac{1}{\\mu } ( \\lambda u_{xx})_{xx } \\\\ a_{1 }   \\zeta_{1 } + b_{1 }   \\frac{\\xi}{j } \\\\",

    "the following well - posedness and stability result was obtained in @xcite , for the homogeneous beam ( i.e. for @xmath57 and @xmath58 constant ) .",
    "the proof in the inhomogeneous case is performed analogously .",

    "but it remained an open question if this system is also exponentially stable . as a criterion we will use the following theorem due to huang @xcite , which was also used for controlled ebbs _ without _ tip mass @xcite :    let @xmath65 be a uniformly bounded @xmath60-semigroup on a hilbert space with infinitesimal generator @xmath53 . then @xmath65 is exponentially stable if and only if @xmath66 and @xmath67 holds .",

    "<S> we present a mathematical and numerical analysis on a control model for the time evolution of a multi - layered piezoelectric cantilever with tip mass and moment of inertia , as developed by kugi and thull @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this closed - loop control system consists of the inhomogeneous euler - bernoulli beam equation coupled to an ode system that is designed to track both the position and angle of the tip mass for a given reference trajectory . </S>",
    "<S> this dynamic controller only employs first order spatial derivatives , in order to make the system technically realizable with piezoelectric sensors . from the literature </S>",
    "<S> it is known that it is asymptotically stable @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> but in a refined analysis we first prove that this system is _ not exponentially _ stable .    in the second part of this paper , </S>",
    "<S> we construct a dissipative finite element method , based on piecewise cubic hermitian shape functions and a crank - nicolson time discretization . for both the spatial semi - discretization and the full @xmath0discretization </S>",
    "<S> we prove that the numerical method is structure preserving , i.e.  it dissipates energy , analogous to the continuous case . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we derive error bounds for both cases and illustrate the predicted convergence rates in a simulation example . </S>"
