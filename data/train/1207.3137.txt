    "many gene regulation pathways have been discovered over the past few decades [ @xcite ] . at the turn of the century , researchers began applying statistical tools to genome - wide expression data to understand complex gene interactions .",
    "eisen et al . showed that genes from the same pathways and with similar functions cluster together by expression pattern [ @xcite ] . soon afterward",

    "these models describe gene regulation quantitatively and can be used to simulate and predict systems behaviors [ @xcite ] . however ,",
    "more work is needed to develop effective model - based methods for inferring gene network structure from experimental data .",
    "existing inference methods typically rely either on heuristic approaches or on very simple , local models , like linear differential equation models in a neighborhood of a particular steady - state .",
    "statistical corrrelation is a common method of establishing network connections [ @xcite ] and can be very useful when hundreds or thousands of genes are monitored under specific , local cellular conditions ( e.g. , for grouping genes with similar functions ) .",
    "however , this approach works poorly when perturbations drive the network far from the original steady - state .",
    "global nonlinear models are essential to account for complex global system behaviors , like the transformation of a normal cell into a cancerous cell due to the amplification of a particular gene .    as a basis for our inference approach",

    "many models of this type have been proposed , and the idea traces back to the beginning of systems biology in the biophysics field [ @xcite ] , but the bintu model is widely accepted within the biophysics community [ @xcite ] . the bintu model is based on the thermodynamics of rna transcription , the process at the core of gene expression regulation [ @xcite ] .",

    "we show how to design a sequence of experiments to collect the data and how to use it to fit the parameters of the bintu model , leading to a set of odes that quantitatively characterize the regulatory network .",
    "although the original fitting problem is nonlinear , we can transform it into a convex optimization problem by restricting our attention to steady - states .",

    "let @xmath0 represent rna concentrations and @xmath1 represent protein concentrations corresponding to a set of @xmath2 genes .",
    "we assume that the production rate of the rna transcript @xmath3 of gene @xmath4 is proportional to the probability @xmath5 that rna polymerase ( rnap ) is bound to the promoter .",
    "that is , we assume that rna transcription occurs at a rate @xmath6 whenever rnap is bound to the promoter .",

    "( we assume that the concentration of each complex is proportional to the product of the concentrations of the constituent proteins , and absorb the proportionality constant into corresponding coefficients @xmath18 . ) the coefficients @xmath19 and @xmath20 depend on the binding energies of regulator complexes to the promoter . @xmath21 and",

    "gene 1 is activated by the protein product of gene 2 and repressed by its own product ( an example of self - regulation ) .",
    "gene 2 is repressed by a complex formed by the product of gene 1 and its own product ( synergistic self - regulation ) . in the diagram ,",
    "the edge colors indicate activation ( green ) or repression ( red ) and the edge weights indicate coefficient sizes , illustrated above with typical sizes . ]    as an example , consider the simple two - gene network shown in figure  [ figmodelexample ] .",
    "suppose that genes 1 and 2 have rna concentrations @xmath28 , and protein concentrations @xmath29 , respectively , and that gene 1 is activated by protein 2 and repressed by its own product ( protein 1 ) , while gene 2 is repressed by a complex formed by proteins 1 and 2 .",
    "the situation corresponds to the following equations : @xmath30\\\\[-8pt ] \\frac{dx_2}{dt } & = & \\tau_2 \\frac{b_{20 } } { 1 + c_{21 } y_1 y_2 } - \\lambda _ 2^{\\mathrm{rna } } x_2,\\qquad \\frac{dy_2}{dt } = r_2x_2 - \\lambda_2^{\\mathrm{protein } } y_2.\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in the notation above , we have @xmath31 . the parameters @xmath32 determine the magnitude of the repression or activation .",
    "as this example shows , the model is flexible enough to capture a wide range of effects , including self - regulation ( i.e. , regulation of a gene by its own protein product , most commonly as repression ) and synergistic regulation by protein complexes ( two or more proteins bound together to form a regulatory unit ) , in quantitative detail .",
    "furthermore , the model is predictive : if we know or can infer the coefficients in the model , we can predict the future behavior of the system starting from any initial condition .",
    "the model given by equations ( [ eqexpression ] ) and ( [ eqf ] ) fully describes the evolution of rna and protein levels and provides a comprehensive , quantitative model of gene regulation , provided we know the parameters .",
    "unfortunately , @xmath33 are extremely difficult to measure , as they depend on binding energies of rnap and tfs to the gene promoter .",
    "the sheer number of measurements required to characterize all possible tfs ( both individual proteins and complexes ) also makes this approach infeasible .",
    "therefore , our goal is to use a systems level approach to fit the model using rna expression data .",
    "specifically , we will assume that @xmath34 are known or can be measured ( if these quantities are not available , we can simply absorb them into the coefficients @xmath33 , although more accurate rate estimates will likely improve the coefficient estimates ) .",
    "our data will be measurements of the rna concentrations @xmath35 at many different cellular steady - states ( which correspond to steady - states of the dynamical system ) .",
    "the problem is to infer the values of the coefficients @xmath33 .",
    "the key to solving this problem efficiently is to restrict our attention to steady - states , as proposed by choi ( @xcite ) .",
    "this restriction allows us to transform a nonlinear ode fitting problem into a linear regression problem .",
    "a steady - state of the system is one in which rna and protein levels are constant : @xmath36 .",
    "steady - states of the system correspond to cell states with roughly constant gene expression levels , like embyronic stem cell , skin cell or liver cell .",
    "in contrast , an embryonic stem cell in the process of differentiating is not in steady - state .",
    "perturbed steady - states are particularly interesting .",
    "after a perturbation like gene knockdown , a cell s gene expression levels are in flux for some time while they adjust to the change . eventually , if it is still viable , the cell may settle to a new steady - state [ @xcite ] .",

    "the last equation is linear in the coefficients @xmath33 ! in order to solve for @xmath33 , we will need to collect many different expression measurements @xmath35 at both naturally occurring and perturbed steady - states .",
    "each steady - state measurement will lead to a different linear equation .",

    "( the experimental means of collecting the necessary steady - state expression data will be discussed in the next section . )",
    "we solve a separate problem for each gene @xmath4 , since the coefficients @xmath16 in the differential equation @xmath48 for gene @xmath4 are independent of the coefficients in the differential equations for other genes .",
    "since we can not know ahead of time which potential regulatory terms @xmath49 are actually involved , we include all possible terms up to second - order and look for sparse @xmath33 , intepreting @xmath50 to mean that term @xmath49 is not a regulator of gene @xmath4 .",

    "typically we do not know the regulators beforehand , however , and we need to use the data to identify them . that is , we include all possible terms ( up to second - order ) in the equations : @xmath58 and estimate sparse coefficients @xmath16 using several steady - state measurements @xmath59 .",

    "( in practice , choosing thresholds is a judgment call based on the expected number of regulators , the noise level of the data and the level of detail appropriate for the application . )",
    "we set the thresholds at @xmath121 ( noiseless case ) or @xmath122 ( noisy case ) of the largest coefficient recovered for each equation .",
    "for example , the largest recovered coefficient in the @xmath123/dt$ ] equation is roughly 15 in either case , so we zero the coefficients that fall below @xmath124 ( noiseless case ) or @xmath125 ( noisy case ) .",

    "coefficient is above the threshold , with weights reflecting the size of the coefficients .",
    "these diagrams show that the recovery is nearly perfect in the noiseless case : using the gentler threshold for the oct4 equation , we recover all the true edges except for three very weak ones , and return just one small false positive repressor in the gata6 equation . in the noisy case ,",
    "we recover all the large coefficients correctly , although there are a few small false positives and we miss several of the weakest edges .",
    "overall , the method is able to capture the major network structure .",
    "our experiment on the synthetic esc system demonstrates that our algorithm can be used to infer a complex dynamical systems model of gene regulation and that the method can tolerate low levels of noise . term selection from among all possible single gene and gene - complex regulators ( up to second - degree interactions , plus the third - degree interaction osn ) was successful .",
    "the inferred equations are easy to interpret in terms of gene networks , and the detailed quantitative information allows for prediction of future expression trajectories from any starting point .",
    "the approach is also scalable .",
    "since we have formulated our problem as a convex optimization problem [ equation ( [ eqopt ] ) ] , it can be solved efficiently even for large systems using prepackaged software .",
    "furthermore , it is trivially parallelizable , since we need to solve a version of ( [ eqopt ] ) to infer the differential equation coefficients @xmath16 for each gene @xmath4 .",
    "parallelization is even more helpful for the cross - validation step , where we need to solve equation ( [ eqopt ] ) for each gene and a sequence of choices sparsity parameter @xmath96 .",
    "we tested the scalability by running the algorithm with the parallelization discussed above on a simulated 100-gene system .",
    "the algorithm ran correctly in a reasonable time frame ( a few hours ) on a computing cluster .",
    "the high resolution of our model is one of its most valuable features , but it means that accurate term selection may require much data , especially in the presence of noise . in our experiment ,",
    "when we added @xmath122 gaussian noise , we needed extra data ( knockdown / overexpression pairs ) in order to accurately select terms .",
    "when we tried @xmath130 noise , the algorithm consistently selected the large terms in five of the six equations , but we had to add even more data in order to correctly identify the major repressor in the nanog equation .",
    "the nanog equation is subtle in that oct4 acts as both an activator in complexes with sox2 and nanog and a repressor in a complex with gata6 , so the algorithm tends to select different gata6 complexes ( or the gata6 singleton ) as the major repressor when the data is insufficient . in the @xmath130 noise case , we needed additional data on the role of gata6 ( double - knockdowns and double - overexpression of pairs including gata6 from esc and dsc ) in order to select oct4-gata6 as the major repressor of nanog fairly consistently . as discussed earlier , another difficulty is the nonidentifiability that arises from accounting for self - regulation while restricting data to steady - states .",
    "distinguishing between the two possible forms of nonidentifiable equations requires extra derivative data ( which can be collected experimentally , although it is more difficult and time - consuming ) and extra steps in the algorithm .",
    "the constraints on the convex optimization problem ( [ eqopt ] ) , which arise from thermodynamic considerations , are sufficient to prevent further nonidentifiability , but in certain cases , certain problems can suffer from near - nonidentifiability of other forms , which may contribute to the challenge of term - selection with noisy or limited data .",
    "we ensure accurate term selection by making sure we include enough diverse , high - quality steady - state measurements .",
    "we should also note that our model does not account for the intrinsic noise in gene transcription and translation , although these processes are inherently stochastic , since tf and rnap binding result from chance collisions between molecules in the cell .",
    "however , the stochastic version of our rational - form transcription model is highly complex and there is currently no satisfactory method for its inference . studying the deterministic evolution plus",
    "additive noise is standard practice for all but linear models of gene expression , and treatment of the deterministic model provides insight into the stochastic model .",
    "here we focus on the additive noise case and leave the study of intrinsic noise for future investigation .",
    "the model we use is based on the detailed thermodynamics of gene transcription , and quantitatively captures the full spectrum of regulatory phenomena in a detailed , physically interpretable , predictive manner . since we can formulate the model fitting problem as a convex optimization problem , we can solve it efficiently and scalably using prepackaged software .",
    "@xmath89-regularization allows for term - selection while maintaining the problem convexity .",
    "the experiments required to collect the necessary steady - state gene expression data are straightforward to perform , as technologies for knockdowns and overexpression are well - established and measuring gene expression is relatively simple .",
    "the model accounts for activation and repression by single - protein tfs and synergistic complexes as well as self - regulation , and describes the magnitude of each type of regulation in quantitative detail .",
    "furthermore , the model can be extended to account for environmental effects and auxiliary proteins involved in regulation , including enhancers and chromatin remodelers .",
    "the fitted model can predict the evolution of the system from any starting point . given a set of steady - states gene expression measurements",
    ", our algorithm can be used to fit a model which not only predicts further steady - states of the system , but also fully describes the transitions between them .",
    "finally , beside the study of gene regulation , our approach will be useful in many other application areas where it is necessary to infer a nonlinear dynamical system by suitable experimentation and statistical analysis .",
