    "formation rate and environment at @xmath1 remain similar ( e.g. , the sfr  density relation is still inverted relative to that found at @xmath114 , and the u - shaped dependence of average overdensity on sfr persists ) .",
    "we note that the _ amplitude _ of this calibration , rather than the strength of its luminosity  dependence , will not affect the conclusions of any of our studies at constant redshift , but only comparisons of the overall strength of star  formation at @xmath117 to @xmath142 .",
    "clearly , if a source is sufficiently highly obscured , then we may detect no [ o ii ] emission in the deep2 spectra .",
    "for such sources , the empirical calibrations of @xcite will not be appropriate .",

    "as such , correcting for extinction beyond that expected from @xcite would be expected to increase the strength of the trends observed in the deep2 sample , causing the average sfr to be yet higher in overdense regions .",
    "one method for detecting heavily obscured sources and minimizing the impact of dust on sfr measurements is to observe at longer wavelengths ( e.g. , at 24@xmath144 m ) , where dust obscuration is much weaker .",
    "analysis of the relationship between star formation and environment using _",
    "spitzer_/mips data will be the subject of future papers @xcite and will be a critical check to the results presented here .",
    "however , extremely deep infrared data is needed to include sources with star ",
    "formation rates as low as those measurable in the deep2 spectroscopy .",

    "ongoing , extremely deep _",
    "spitzer_/mips observations in the egs and the extended chandra deep field south ( ecdfs ) will provide data sets well  suited to future analyses of obscured star formation at intermediate redshift .",
    "we note that although they do not appear to influence our environment results , the effects of dust extinction and agn contamination may be responsible for the difference in the curvature of the isocontours of mean sfr as a function of color and absolute magnitude in the sdss and deep2 samples , as seen in figure [ mean_sfr_cmd_fig ]",
    ". the higher number density of agn at @xmath1 relative to @xmath1 , especially on the red edge of the blue cloud and on the red sequence , inflates the mean sfr at those portions of the color ",
    "magnitude diagrams , thereby stretching the isocontours of mean sfr to redder colors .",
    "similarly , the higher fraction of obscured star formation at intermediate redshift @xcite could be responsible for elongating the iscontours at @xmath1 with respect to those at @xmath4 .",
    "as discussed in  [ sec_intro ] , one explanation which has been posited for the dramatic drop in the cosmic star  formation rate space density at @xmath5 is a corresponding steep decline in the galaxy merger rate , which thereby reduces the amount of merger  induced star formation .",
    "mergers of dark matter halos are integral to hierarchical structure formation ; their rate may be calculated straightforwardly in the extended press ",
    "schechter formalism @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , attempts to constrain the evolution in the galaxy merger rate through observations at @xmath5 , have produced mixed results .",
    "early imaging studies of galaxies at intermediate redshift using the _ hubble space telescope _ ( _ hst _ ) found galaxies with disturbed morphologies ( i.e. , mergers ) to be much more common at @xmath1 than locally and attributed the rapid decline in the blue luminosity density to the evolution of this population ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) . in agreement with this finding , some estimates of the galaxy merger rate at @xmath5 derived from analyses of galaxy morphologies and from studies of spectroscopic pairs , have found a significant decline in the frequency of major mergers over the last 7 gyr @xcite .",
    "however , a number of other efforts to study galaxies at @xmath1 have found a much more gradual decline in the pair fraction and merger rate since @xmath1 , downplaying the role of galaxy interactions in the evolution of the cosmic star ",
    "formation history ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the abundance of contrasting results is , at least in part , due to the difficulty in measuring the merger rate , which depends significantly on the treatment of projection effects and assumptions regarding the timescales over which merger signatures are visible .",
    "furthermore , despite having large differences in the best ",
    "fit rate , many of the seemingly  contradictory evolution estimates are still consistent with each other due to small sample sizes and large random errors .",
    "many systematic problems could affect one method or another ; for instance , @xcite argues that some of the variance in results is attributable to accounting errors in converting pair fractions into merger rates .",
    "recent studies at intermediate redshift have benefited from significantly larger sample sizes and deeper _ hst _ imaging over wider fields .",
    "while this has not yielded consensus on the evolution of the merger rate , studies of galaxy morphologies using data sets in fields such as the egs and the ecdfs have found that the contribution from irregular ( or peculiar ) galaxies to the blue luminosity density to be subdominant at @xmath1 ; for instance , results from @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite all indicate that the drop in the global sfr at @xmath5 ( as traced by the @xmath37band and uv luminosity densities ) is driven by a decline in the emission from galaxies with regular ( i.e. , non  disturbed ) morphologies .",
    "thus , regardless of the evolution in the merger rate , galaxy mergers must not be the dominant cause of the stark ( @xmath146@xmath147 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) decline in the global star ",
    "formation rate since @xmath1 .",
    "this conclusion is supported by a variety of other galaxy studies at @xmath148 .",
    "@xcite placed an upper limit of @xmath149 on the contribution from galaxy pairs ( i.e. , precursors to mergers ) to @xmath150 m infrared emission at intermediate redshift .",
    "similarly , @xcite find that the relationship between galaxy morphology and star  formation activity at @xmath151 implies that major mergers ( and the evolution in the major merger rate ) can not be the proximate cause of the decline in the cosmic star  formation rate . in agreement with these observational results , theoretical models of galaxy mergers",
    "predict that such interactions contribute only a small fraction of the total star  formation rate space density of the universe @xcite .    since galaxy mergers do not appear to be driving the global decline in the cosmic star ",
    "formation rate since @xmath5 , a new paradigm is required .",
    "several multiwavelength studies of star formation at intermediate and low redshifts have concluded that the reduction in the global star  formation rate space density is largely driven by long  term processes such as gradual gas depletion , rather than galaxy mergers .",
    "for instance , @xcite and @xcite find that star  forming galaxies populate a tight sequence in sfr and stellar mass at @xmath152 , with a limited range in sfr at a given stellar mass and redshift @xcite .",
    "this constrains the amount of episodic star ",
    "formation activity that may be occurring , and indicates that star formation at @xmath148 appears to be dominated by a gradual decline in the average sfr among the star  forming galaxy population .",
    "strong , outlier bursts indicative of being driven by merger activity are rare , even at @xmath153 @xcite .    while mergers ( and environment ) should play some role in the decline of the global sfr even if there is only a weak evolution in the merger rate , the growing consensus appears to be that mergers have relatively little effect on the global decline in star formation from @xmath1 to @xmath4 .",
    "the impact of other environment  dependent mechanisms , however , could be significant .",
    "for instance , virial shock  heating of infalling gas onto massive dark matter halos can produce a smooth decline in star formation with time : as the flow of cold gas to galaxies in such halos is suspended , the galaxies suffer from starvation and gradually stop forming stars . given the strong correlation between halo mass and local galaxy density ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , this process should exhibit a close connection with galaxy environment .",
    "similarly , conductive heating of gas can halt star formation within infalling galaxies onto a cluster or group @xcite .",
    "pressure stripping , evaporation occurs most efficiently in the central regions of clusters .",
    "however , the gas density and temperature in the outskirts of clusters or in groups are sufficient to make these processes efficient in less extreme environs than the centers of the most massive clusters @xcite .    however , the results of this paper show that environment  dependent ( or environment  related ) processes are not responsible for driving the decline in the cosmic star  formation rate .",
    "instead , our analysis supports the general picture of a smooth decline in the typical galaxy sfr , with only a relatively minor impact from environment  related mechanisms such as mergers , evaporation associated with conductive heating , and ram  pressure stripping .",
    "formation rate in both dense and underdense regions has decreased rapidly since @xmath1 , rather than primarily declining in group and cluster  like environments .",
    "figure [ mean_sfr_z ] shows the decline in the average ( and median ) sfr for the blue galaxy population within the volume  limited [ relative to @xmath154 deep2c and sdss  b samples .",
    "the evolution in the mean sfr is much stronger than the dependence of mean sfr on environment at @xmath9 or @xmath4 ( cf .",
    "[ sfr_environ_fig ] ) ; the average ( or median ) sfr drops by a factor of @xmath155 between @xmath1 and @xmath46 , while the contrast between the mean sfr in the highest and lowest  density regions is less than a factor @xmath156 at both @xmath1 and @xmath46 . changing the rate of @xmath157 evolution used to define these samples",
    "( i.e. , the parameter @xmath54 in equation [ magcut_eqn ] ) changes these results only modestly ; the growth in the mean sfr for these matched samples ranges from a factor of @xmath158 to @xmath159 for @xmath160 or @xmath161 . while our results show",
    "that environment is clearly correlated with star ",
    "formation activity at @xmath5 and that there is significant evolution in the relationship between mean sfr and galaxy overdensity from @xmath1 to @xmath4 , the strength of the sfr ",
    "density relation and its evolution at @xmath5 is a small perturbation on the overall decline in the global star  formation rate space density . if environment  related processes played a dominant role in the cosmic star ",
    "formation history over the last 7 gyr , then we would expect the decline of the cosmic star formation rate to be associated with only a subset of environments .    while galaxy environment does not dictate the evolution of the global star  formation activity at @xmath5 , it does play a central role in both the complete quenching of star formation ( i.e. , the creation of `` red and dead '' galaxies ) and the evolution of the bright , blue galaxy ( bbg ) population . as first shown by @xcite , all major features of the color ",

    "dense environments .",
    "similarly , by analyzing the evolution of the blue galaxy fraction in both galaxy groups and the field in deep2 , @xcite showed that the growth in the abundance of galaxies on the red sequence ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "environment plays a related role in the evolution of bbgs .",
    "as first discussed by @xcite , in order to reconcile the differences in the luminosity  environment trends at @xmath1 and @xmath4 , the bbgs in dense environments at @xmath1 must have ceased star formation and moved onto the red sequence by the present epoch .",
    "this evolution may play a significant role in the evolution of the bright end of the blue galaxy luminosity function , which sees a significant drop off in number density at bright magnitudes over the last 7 gyr ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this quenching of the bbgs in overdense environments will have only a small impact on the global sfr , as the most massive galaxies contribute only a small portion of the total sfr density at @xmath5 @xcite .",

    "our results , which are based on a significantly larger sample and probe to lower levels of star  formation activity , are in relatively good agreement with those of @xcite .",
    "both analyses find an inversion ( or `` reversal '' ) in the sfr  density relation at @xmath1 relative to the local relation .",
