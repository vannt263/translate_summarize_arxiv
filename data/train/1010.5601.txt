    "let @xmath2 be a finite group and let @xmath3 be a field of characteristic @xmath4 , where @xmath4 divides @xmath5 assume that @xmath3 is sufficiently large that it is a splitting field for all relevant finite groups .",
    "the @xmath4-blocks of the symmetric groups are determined by a partition @xmath6 called the @xmath4-core and by a non - negative integer @xmath7 called the weight .",
    "rouquier and chuang @xcite showed that all blocks of a fixed weight in the symmetric and alternating groups are derived equivalent .",
    "the chuang - rouquier method , called @xmath8-categorization , uses lie group methods , including reflection functors .",
    "the symmetric and alternating groups have central extensions @xmath9 and @xmath10 with kernel @xmath11 , the cyclic group of order @xmath12 , which we will loosely refer to as covering groups ( although , for a few small values of @xmath13 , the kernel of the extension is not contained in the commutator of the group ) .",
    "we assume henceforward that @xmath4 is an odd prime , in which case all blocks can be divided into ordinary blocks of @xmath14 or @xmath15 or _",
    "spin blocks _ , whose characters all take the value @xmath16 on the non - trivial element of the center .    as with blocks of the symmetric groups ,",
    "the spin blocks of the covering groups are determined by a non - negative integer @xmath7 called the weight , and by a partition @xmath6 called the @xmath4-bar core .",
    "however , the @xmath4-bar cores must be strict partitions , can not contain any parts divisible by @xmath4 , and can not contain parts congruent to @xmath17 and to @xmath18 for any @xmath17 satisfying @xmath19 .",
    "any pair @xmath20 for @xmath21 determines exactly one block of @xmath9 and one block of @xmath10 . in the sequel",
    ", we will denote the pair @xmath20 by @xmath22 .",
    "the obstruction to making an immediate generalization of the chuang - rouquier @xcite result to the spin blocks of @xmath9 lies in the fact that blocks which , by the combinatorics of the reflection functors , should seemingly be derived equivalent , do not always have the same number of simple modules .",
    "since the number of simples is invariant under derived equivalence , this meant that they could not in fact be in the same derived equivalence class .",
    "the solution to this dilemma is the following , inspired by the results of @xcite and formulated explicitly in @xcite :    ( kessar - schaps ) if @xmath4 is an odd prime , then among all the spin blocks of @xmath23 and @xmath24 , there are exactly two derived equivalence classes for each weight @xmath21 , and for each @xmath4-bar core there is exactly one block of weight @xmath7 in each equivalence class .",
    "the extremal points of the maximal strings in the crystal graph correspond to morita equivalent blocks , making the appropriate crossover from @xmath23 to @xmath24 if the parities differ .",

    "brou @xcite,@xcite has conjectured that if @xmath26 is abelian and @xmath29 is a block with defect group @xmath26 , then @xmath29 and @xmath30 are derived equivalent , i.e. , the bounded derived categories @xmath31 and @xmath32 are equivalent .",
    "the roles of @xmath9 and @xmath10 are much more symmetrical in the spin case then they are for the ordinary representations of the symmetric and alternating groups . over a field of characteristic zero ,",
    "the irreducible representations of both correspond to partitions , but now they are strict partitions , containing no repeated parts , not even the part @xmath33 .",
    "whereas in the symmetric case there was a one - to - one correspondence of partitions and irreducible representations , in the spin case the matter is determined by the parity of the partition .",

    "each strict partition @xmath35 of @xmath13 has a parity @xmath37 the partition is called even if @xmath38 and odd if @xmath39 . over a field of characteristic @xmath40 , an even strict partition labels two conjugate irreducible representations of @xmath10 and one of @xmath9 .",

    ". a prescription for the edges can be found , for example , in @xcite .",
    "a _ maximal string _ is a maximal connected sequence of simple modules joined by edges with the same label .",
    "the reflection functors of chuang - rouquier reflect the maximal strings around their midpoint , with the reflection preserving the weights of the blocks to which the simples belong .",
    "furthermore , it was shown by scopes @xcite that the extremal points of the maximal strings are actually morita equivalent . a lie theoretic version of this result , due to brundan and kleshchev , can be found in section 11 of @xcite .",
    "recalling that @xmath4 is odd , we set @xmath42 .",
    "we now define the scopes involutions .",

    "to make the three - dimensional representation easier to view , we have drawn the positive @xmath58 axis going down rather than up . within each layer ,",

    "2 .   from the arguments in @xcite ,",
    "it is clear that @xmath129 decomposes as a @xmath130$]-module into @xmath33 , @xmath12 , or @xmath131 different isomorphism classes of tensor products of a simple modules of @xmath132 and the dual of a simple module of @xmath133 , all with the same multiplicity @xmath134 .",
    "the exact number @xmath113 is given by the formula in case @xmath12 , since a core produces two blocks precisely when the group and the core have the same parity .",
    "there are two possibilities for the first exactly when @xmath122 and there are two possibilities for the second exactly when @xmath123 . + if @xmath126 , then @xmath113 is the number of isomorphism classes in the bimodule . if @xmath89 , the action of @xmath135 permutes each pair where there is a pair , so in the case where there are one or two isomorphism classes , there is only one in the set of fixed points",
    "when there are four isomorphism classes , they are permuted in pairs , leaving two different classes in the end .",
    "3 .   it remains to calculate @xmath136 if @xmath137 , then this is the restriction bimodule , and by the branching rules given in @xcite , we get @xmath138 .",

    "the middle terms of the short string are translations of trivial fundamental short strings .",
    "a short @xmath17-string of type @xmath160 must arise from a core which is mapped to itself under @xmath161 , and this can not occur for @xmath48 , since @xmath162 is an integer and is mapped to @xmath163 under the scopes involution @xmath164 . for @xmath165 ,",

    "we now look at the string in the crystal graph , i.e. , a string of simple modules , which we represent by their labeling partitions and separate by arrows .",

    "as a check of our calculations , we know from lemma [ res ] that the total restriction from one end of the string to the other should be @xmath234 times the lowest rank simple module , since here @xmath235 , @xmath121 and @xmath236 .",
    "we illustrate this is the first of the four cases above :    again assume @xmath57 .",

    "we expect @xmath237 of @xmath238 to be an indecomposable projective module beginning and ending with @xmath245 .",
    "since both the irreducible modules @xmath245 and @xmath246 have dimension @xmath131 , this must be the projective module @xmath247 with @xmath245 as its head .",

    "however , from that point on , the restrictions can no longer be distinguished by passing to @xmath60 , because the restriction of each of the two associate simples has the same composition factors over @xmath60 , these being one copy of each of the two associate simples with label @xmath249 .",
    "over @xmath266 the top and socle are interchanged when one passes from one associate to the other , but over @xmath60 this difference is lost .",

    "the irreducible top is , in fact , the next module in the string in the crystal graph .",
    "if one looks at ordinary modules , this identification of top and socle ceases to be true . in the example with which we are dealing",
    ", the restriction of either of the modules with label @xmath244 is a module with top equal to one of the two associates labeled by @xmath249 , and socle labeled by the other . in the restriction of the other , this will be reversed .",
    "one can decide , in trying to label modules by @xmath267 of @xmath268 , that one will always label as @xmath267 the one at the top of the restriction of the @xmath267 , but given the duality between top and socle , this choice is arbitrary .",
    "continuing to @xmath269 , some factors drop out because they are correspond to a block other than the two associate blocks of with label @xmath255 , and we are left with @xmath234 copies of each of two non - isomorphic bimodules of dimension twenty , each being the tensor product of the original left @xmath270-module and one of the two associate one - dimensional right @xmath269-modules .",
    "we now construct the one - sided tilting complex , using the methods of @xcite , @xcite .",
    "by @xcite,@xcite there is a one - sided tilting complex consisting of linear complexes of projectives outward from the exceptional vertex . letting each complex be labeled by its highest part",
    ", we would get : @xmath271 letting each of these complexes be represented by @xmath272 , where @xmath273 is the highest index in the first set of complexes , and r is the lowest index in the second set of complexes , we find that one possible tilting complex which will lead to the complex obtained from the representative for @xmath222 by removing the part @xmath33 is given by @xmath274    to compose the two equivalences , we take mapping cones of the various combined complexes , leading to a new one - sided complex , with almost all terms in degree zero , except the term containing the part @xmath4 .",
    "if we follow this procedure for each of the maps in the second tilting complex , taking care of the degrees of each complex , we get    @xmath275    this complex is recognizable as an elementary one - sided tilting complex of the type introduced by okuyama @xcite .",
    "we have thus prepared to prove the following :    in a short string of weight type @xmath194 , the derived equivalence between the two terms of weight @xmath33 is given by an elementary one - sided tilting complex .",
    "if @xmath276 and @xmath277 are the middle terms , then they are both allowed equivalent to the middle terms of a @xmath40-string of the normal form given in the lemma , and thus there must be a tilting complex of the given form .    in order for the tilting complex to be elementary ( in this case , to the right )",
    ", we must have a subset @xmath278 of the set of indices @xmath279 , such that the projective modules @xmath280 with indices in @xmath278 are all shifted one degree to the right , and every other projective module @xmath281 is replaced by a complex @xmath282 , where the map @xmath283 is such that the kernel is the maximal submodule of @xmath281 which contains no composition factors @xmath284 with @xmath17 in @xmath278 .",
    "( the definition of elementary on the left is dual . )",
    "the only @xmath281 with composition factors labeled by indices in @xmath278 are the two adjacent projectives in the brauer tree , which in this case are @xmath285 and @xmath286 . since the maps in the tilting complex are maximal maps , the kernels have the desired maximality condition .",
    "now that we have the divided powers , we can construct a candidate for the bimodule @xmath287 which is to give the derived equivalence between the block of @xmath224 and the block of @xmath243 .",
    "here we are in a case parallel to the case in which rickard first proposed the complex of bimodules @xmath287 , in which the block on which we want @xmath287 to act is at depth one in the string .",
    "the complex @xmath288 is actually the direct sum of four complexes : @xmath289 the numbers are the weights of the action of @xmath283 from the @xmath290-action .",
    "the complexes at the extremal points are the divided powers corresponding to the source algebra equivalences derived in @xcite",
    ". the complexes in the middle are the tilting complex and its dual giving the derived equivalence .",
    "our candidate complex is @xmath291 this is actually dual to the complexes used in @xcite , but this could have been fixed by reversing the numbering of the complexes that we used .",
    "the short strings of weight two are of two types , those with weight series ( 1,2,2,1 ) , which are simply translations of strings with weight series ( 0,1,1,0 ) , and those of weight series ( 0,2,2,0 ) .",
    "this difference is reflected clearly in the tilting complexes in the examples for which we have decomposition matrices , in that the examples of the types ( 1,2,2,1 ) which we calculated have tilting complexes which are derived directly from the tilting complex of the ( 0,1,1,0 ) example , whereas the tilting complex for the ( 0,2,2,0 ) example is an elementary complex with only one `` active '' module , that coming from the defect zero block .",
    "we checked all the examples for @xmath57 which fall into the range for which the decomposition matrices have been calculated , and checked that the transformations of the decomposition matrices were compatible with what we would expect from categorification , i.e. , were indeed elementary .",
    "the lowest rank example of a string of type @xmath196 is from block @xmath292 of @xmath293 to block @xmath294 of @xmath295 .",
    "the block @xmath296 has five simple modules .",
    "of these , @xmath297 is connected in the crystal graph to the simple module @xmath298 of @xmath299 , and similarly @xmath300 is connected in the crystal graph to the simple module @xmath301 . after we have rearranged the rows to correspond by @xmath164 and the columns to correspond by the the crystal graph , we get that the decomposition matrix @xmath302 is obtained from the decomposition matrix @xmath303 of @xmath296 by    @xmath304&~~~~(64)\\\\ [ 0 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 0 ] & ~~~~(82)\\\\ [ 0 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 1 ] & ~~~~(73)\\\\ [ 1 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 ] & ~~~~(91)\\\\ [ 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 ] & ~~(4321)\\\\ [ 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 ] & ~~~~(10)\\\\ [ 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 ] & ~~~~(10)\\\\ [ 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 1 ] & ~~~(532)\\\\ [ 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 1 ] & ~~~(532)\\\\ [ 1 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 1 ] & ~~~(541)\\\\ [ 1 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 1 ] & ~~~(541 ) \\end{matrix};\\ ] ]    @xmath305&~~~~(641)\\\\ [ 0 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 0 ] & ~~~~(821)\\\\ [ 0 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 1 ] & ~~~~(731)\\\\ [ 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 ] & ~~~~~(11)\\\\ [ 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 1 ] & ~~~~(632)\\\\ [ 1 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 ] & ~~~(10~1)\\\\ [ 1 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 ] & ~~~(10~1)\\\\ [ 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 ] & ~~~(5321)\\\\ [ 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 ] & ~~~(5321)\\\\ [ 1 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 0 ] & ~~~~~(65)\\\\ [ 1 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 0 ] & ~~~~~(65 ) \\end{matrix};\\ ] ]            the matrix @xmath306 records the parity in the shift of the irreducible modules over a field of characteristic @xmath40 , while the matrix @xmath213 gives a `` virtual '' tilting complex .",
    "we number the projectives by the column in which they appear . in this case",
    "the matrix @xmath213 is compatible with a tilting complex : @xmath310 this is , as expected , a translation of the tilting complex for the string of type @xmath194 .",
    "note that the column @xmath311 , which is not derived from translation , is left unchanged .",
    "the block of lowest rank for @xmath57 with weight type @xmath188 occurs in a @xmath33-string",
    ". there is no such string for @xmath312 because there @xmath313 , so there are no intermediate scopes involutions , so this is indeed the example of lowest rank .    in the @xmath40-strings of the types @xmath194 and @xmath196",
    "there were no crossovers , because the parity of the simple modules remained the same for the entire string . in @xmath17-strings for @xmath314",
    "we have the parity switching back and forth .",
    "thus the two blocks of weight @xmath12 are the block @xmath315 in @xmath316 , which we will denote as before by @xmath317 , and the block @xmath318 in @xmath319 , which we will denote by @xmath320 .",
    "there are both blocks of type @xmath213 , and the decomposition matrices are as follows :                      in order to fill this out to a complex of bimodules of the form @xmath326 , we must take as many copies of each irreducible complex as the degree of the corresponding simple module in @xmath296 .",
    "in addition , since only copies of @xmath327 are expected in the term on the left , we presume that the terms which have been canceled in passing from the two - sided to the one - sided tilting complex are of the form @xmath328 with the identity map between the projectives .    in summary , for blocks of type @xmath213 , the permutation module method from @xcite should allow the definition of divided powers . for blocks of type @xmath214",
