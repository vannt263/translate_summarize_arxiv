    "the problem of reconstructing a signal @xmath0 from non - uniformly spaced measurements @xmath1 arises in areas as diverse as geophysics , medical imaging , communication engineering , and astronomy .",
    "a successful reconstruction of @xmath0 from its samples @xmath1 requires a priori information about the signal , otherwise the reconstruction problem is ill - posed .",
    "this a priori information can often be obtained from physical properties of the process generating the signal . in many of the aforementioned applications",
    "the signal can be assumed to be ( essentially ) band - limited .",
    "recall that a signal ( function ) is band - limited with bandwidth @xmath2 if it belongs to the space @xmath3 , given by @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the fourier transform of @xmath0 defined by @xmath6 for convenience and without loss of generality we restrict our attention to the case @xmath7 , since any other bandwidth can be reduced to this case by a simple dilation .",
    "therefore we will henceforth use the symbol @xmath8 for the space of band - limited signals .",
    "it is now more than 50 years ago that shannon published his celebrated sampling theorem  @xcite .",
    "his theorem implies that any signal @xmath9 can be reconstructed from its regularly spaced samples @xmath10 by @xmath11    in practice however we seldom enjoy the luxury of equally spaced samples .",
    "the solution of the nonuniform sampling problem poses much more difficulties , the crucial questions being :    * under which conditions is a signal @xmath9 uniquely defined by its samples @xmath12 ? * how can @xmath0 be stably reconstructed from its samples @xmath1 ?",
    "these questions have led to a vast literature on nonuniform sampling theory with deep mathematical contributions see  @xcite to mention only a few .",
    "there is also no lack of methods claiming to efficiently reconstruct a function from its samples  @xcite .",
    "these numerical methods naturally have to operate in a finite - dimensional model , whereas theoretical results are usually derived for the infinite - dimensional space @xmath8 . from a numerical point of view",
    "the `` reconstruction '' of a bandlimited signal @xmath0 from a finite number of samples @xmath13 amounts to computing an approximation to @xmath0 ( or @xmath5 ) at sufficiently dense ( regularly ) spaced grid points in an interval @xmath14 .    hence in order to obtain a `` complete '' solution of the sampling problem following questions have to be answered :    * does the approximation computed within the finite - dimensional model actually converge to the original signal @xmath0 , when the dimension of the model approaches infinity ? * does the finite - dimensional model give rise to fast and stable numerical algorithms ?    these are the questions that we have in mind , when presenting an overview on recent advances and new results in the nonuniform sampling problem from a numerical analysis view point .",
    "in section  [ ss : truncated ] it is demonstrated that the celebrated frame approach does only lead to fast and stable numerical methods when the finite - dimensional model is carefully designed .",
    "the approach usually proposed in the literature leads to an ill - posed problem even in very simple situations .",
    "we discuss several methods to stabilize the reconstruction algorithm in this case . in section  [ ss : trigpol ]",
    "we derive an alternative finite - dimensional model , based on trigonometric polynomials .",
    "this approach leads to a well - posed problem that preserves important structural properties of the original infinite - dimensional problem and gives rise to efficient numerical algorithms .",
    "section  [ s : numeric ] describes how this approach can be modified in order to reconstruct band - limited signals for the in practice very important case when the bandwidth of the signal is not known .",
    "furthermore we present regularization techniques for ill - conditioned sampling problems .",
    "finally section  [ s : applications ] contains numerical experiments from spectroscopy and geophysics .",
    "before we proceed we introduce some notation that will be used throughout the paper .",
    "if not otherwise mentioned @xmath15 always denotes the @xmath16-norm ( @xmath17-norm ) of a function ( vector ) . for operators ( matrices )",
    "@xmath18 is the standard operator ( matrix ) norm .",
    "the condition number of an invertible operator @xmath19 is defined by @xmath20 and the spectrum of @xmath19 is @xmath21 .",
    "@xmath22 denotes the identity operator .",
    "the concept of frames is an excellent tool to study nonuniform sampling problems  @xcite .",
    "the frame approach has the advantage that it gives rise to deep theoretical results and also to the construction of efficient numerical algorithms  _ if _ ( and this point is often ignored in the literature ) the finite - dimensional model is properly designed .",
    "following duffin and schaeffer  @xcite , a family @xmath23 in a separable hilbert space @xmath24 is said to be a frame for @xmath24 , if there exist constants ( the _ frame bounds _ ) @xmath25 such that @xmath26 we define the _ analysis operator _ @xmath19 by @xmath27 and the _ synthesis operator _ , which is just the adjoint operator of @xmath19 , by @xmath28 the _ frame operator _",
    "@xmath29 is defined by @xmath30 , hence @xmath31 .",
    "@xmath29 is bounded by @xmath32 and hence invertible on @xmath24 .",
    "we will also make use of the operator @xmath33 in form of its gram matrix representation @xmath34 with entries @xmath35 .",
    "on @xmath36 the matrix @xmath37 is bounded by @xmath38 and invertible .",
    "on @xmath17 this inverse extends to the _ moore - penrose inverse _ or pseudo - inverse @xmath39 ( cf .",

    "any @xmath40 can be expressed as @xmath41 where the elements @xmath42 form the so - called dual frame and the frame operator induced by @xmath43 coincides with @xmath44 .",
    "hence if a set @xmath23 establishes a frame for @xmath24 , we can reconstruct any function @xmath40 from its moments @xmath45 .",
    "one possibility to connect sampling theory to frame theory is by means of the _ sinc_-function @xmath46 its translates give rise to a _ reproducing kernel _ for @xmath8 via @xmath47 combining   with formulas   and   we obtain following well - known result  @xcite .",
    "if the set @xmath48 is a frame for @xmath8 , then the function @xmath9 is uniquely defined by the sampling set @xmath12 . in this case",
    "we can recover @xmath0 from its samples by @xmath49 or equivalently by @xmath50 with @xmath37 being the frame gram matrix with entries @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "the challenge is now to find easy - to - verify conditions for the sampling points @xmath53 such that @xmath48 ( or equivalently the exponential system @xmath54 ) is a frame for @xmath8 .",
    "this is a well - traversed area ( at least for one - dimensional signals ) , and the reader should consult  @xcite for further details and references .",

    ", neither of the formulas   and   can be actually implemented on a computer , because both involve the solution of an infinite - dimensional operator equation , whereas in practice we can only compute a finite - dimensional approximation .",
    "although the design of a valid finite - dimensional model poses severe mathematical challenges , this step is often neglected in theoretical but also in numerical treatments of the nonuniform sampling problem .",
    "we will see in the sequel that the way we design our finite - dimensional model is crucial for the stability and efficiency of the resulting numerical reconstruction algorithms .    in the next two sections we describe two different approaches for obtaining finite - dimensional approximations to the formulas   and  .",
    "the first and more traditional approach , discussed in section  [ ss : truncated ] , applies a finite section method to equation  .",
    "this approach leads to an ill - posed problem involving the solution of a large unstructured linear system of equations .",
    "the second approach , outlined in section  [ ss : trigpol ] , constructs a finite model for the operator equation in   by means of trigonometric polynomials .",
    "this technique leads to a well - posed problem that is tied to efficient numerical algorithms .",
    "according to equation   we can reconstruct @xmath0 from its sampling values @xmath1 via @xmath55 , where @xmath56 with @xmath57 . 0 since @xmath37 is a compact operator it can be diagonalized via its singular system ( or eigensystem since @xmath37 is self - adjoint ) @xmath58 as follows  @xcite @xmath59 with a corresponding complete orthogonal set of vectors @xmath60 .",
    "the moore - penrose inverse @xmath61 can be expressed as @xmath62 where , as usual , only the non - zero singular values of @xmath37 are used in the above sum . in order",
    "to compute a finite - dimensional approximation to @xmath63 we use the finite section method @xcite . for @xmath64 and @xmath65",
    "we define the orthogonal projection @xmath66 by @xmath67 and identify the image of @xmath66 with the space @xmath68 . setting @xmath69 and @xmath70 , we obtain the @xmath71-th approximation @xmath72 to @xmath73 by solving @xmath74    it is clear that using the truncated frame @xmath75 in   for an approximate reconstruction of @xmath0 leads to the same system of equations .    if @xmath48 is an exact frame",
    "( i.e. , a riesz basis ) for @xmath8 then we have following well - known result .",
    "let @xmath48 be an exact frame for @xmath8 with frame bounds @xmath76 and @xmath77 and @xmath78 as defined above .",
    "then @xmath79 converges strongly to @xmath80 and hence @xmath81 for @xmath82 .",
    "since the proof of this result given in  @xcite is somewhat lengthy we include a rather short proof here .",
    "note that @xmath37 is invertible on @xmath17 and @xmath83 .",
    "let @xmath84 with @xmath85 , then @xmath86 .",
    "in the same way we get @xmath87 , hence the matrices @xmath88 are invertible and uniformly bounded by @xmath89 and @xmath90 the lemma of kantorovich  @xcite yields that @xmath91 strongly .",
    "if @xmath48 is a non - exact frame for @xmath8 the situation is more delicate .",
    "let us consider following situation .",
    "* example 1 : * let @xmath9 and let the sampling points be given by @xmath92 , i.e. , the signal is regularly oversampled at @xmath93 times the nyquist rate",
    ". in this case the reconstruction of @xmath0 is trivial , since the set @xmath94 is a tight frame with frame bounds @xmath95 .",
    "shannon s sampling theorem implies that @xmath0 can be expressed as @xmath96 where @xmath97 and the numerical approximation is obtained by truncating the summation , i.e. , @xmath98    using the truncated frame approach one finds that @xmath37 is a toeplitz matrix with entries @xmath99 in other words , @xmath88 coincides with the prolate matrix  @xcite .",
    "the unpleasant numerical properties of the prolate matrix are well - documented .",
    "in particular we know that the singular values @xmath100 of @xmath88 cluster around @xmath101 and @xmath102 with @xmath103 singular values in the transition region .",
    "since the singular values of @xmath88 decay exponentially to zero the finite - dimensional reconstruction problem has become _ severely ill - posed _",
    "@xcite , although the infinite - dimensional problem is `` perfectly posed '' since the frame operator satisfies @xmath104 , where @xmath22 is the identity operator .",
    "of course the situation does not improve when we consider non - uniformly spaced samples . in this case",
    "it follows from standard linear algebra that @xmath105\\}$ ] , or expressed in words , the singular values of @xmath37 are bounded away from zero .",
    "however for the truncated matrices @xmath88 we have @xmath106\\}\\ ] ] and the smallest of the singular values of @xmath88 will go to zero for @xmath82 , see  @xcite .",
    "let @xmath107 be the singular value decomposition of a matrix @xmath108 with @xmath109 .",
    "then the moore - penrose inverse of @xmath108 is @xmath110 , where ( e.g. , see  @xcite ) @xmath111 for @xmath112 this means that the singular values close to zero will give rise to extremely large coefficients in @xmath113 .",
    "in fact @xmath114 for @xmath82 and consequently @xmath72 does not converge to @xmath73 .",
    "practically @xmath115 is always bounded due to finite precision arithmetics , but it is clear that it will lead to meaningless results for large @xmath71 .",
    "if the sampling values are perturbed due to round - off error or data error , then those error components which correspond to small singular values @xmath116 are amplified by the ( then large ) factors @xmath117 .",
    "although for a given @xmath88 these amplifications are theoretically bounded , they may be practically unacceptable large .",
    "such phenomena are well - known in regularization theory  @xcite .",
    "a standard technique to compute a stable solution for an ill - conditioned system is to use a truncated singular value decomposition ( tsvd )  @xcite .",
    "this means in our case we compute a regularized pseudo - inverse @xmath118 where @xmath119 in  @xcite it is shown that for each @xmath71 we can choose an appropriate truncation level @xmath120 such that the regularized inverses @xmath121 converge strongly to @xmath122 for @xmath82 and consequently @xmath123 , where @xmath124 with @xmath125 the optimal truncation level @xmath120 depends on the dimension @xmath71 , the sampling geometry , and the noise level .",
    "thus it is not known a priori and has in principle to be determined for each @xmath71 independently .",
    "since @xmath120 is of vital importance for the quality of the reconstruction , but no theoretical explanations for the choice of @xmath120 are given in the sampling literature , we briefly discuss this issue . for this purpose",
    "we need some results from regularization theory .      0 in realistic situations the samples",
    "are usually perturbed by noise , with @xmath126 where @xmath127 denotes a perturbed sample . the noise level",
    "@xmath128 is in practice in general much larger than the truncation level for noise - free data .",
    "thus @xmath120 will mainly depend on @xmath128 . for noise - free data",
    "the accuracy is determined by the roundoff level via the machine precision of the computer .",
    "let @xmath129 be given where @xmath108 is ill - conditioned or singular and @xmath130 is a perturbed right - hand side with @xmath131 . since in our sampling problem",
    "the matrix under consideration is symmetric , we assume for convenience that @xmath108 is symmetric . from a numerical point of view",
    "ill - conditioned systems behave like singular systems and additional information is needed to obtain a satisfactory solution to @xmath132 .",
    "this information is usually stated in terms of `` smoothness '' of the solution @xmath133 .",
    "a standard approach to qualitatively describe smoothness of @xmath133 is to require that @xmath133 can be represented in the form @xmath134 with some vector @xmath135 of reasonable norm , and a `` smoothing '' matrix @xmath29 , cf .",
    "often it is useful to construct @xmath29 directly from @xmath108 by setting @xmath136 usually , @xmath137 is assumed to be fixed , typically at @xmath138 or @xmath139 .",
    "we compute a regularized solution to @xmath140 via a truncated svd and want to determine the optimal regularization parameter ( i.e. , truncation level ) @xmath141 .    under the assumption that @xmath142 it follows from theorem  4.1 in  @xcite that the optimal regularization parameter @xmath141 for the tsvd is @xmath143 where @xmath144 ( see section  6 in  @xcite ) .",
    "however @xmath135 and @xmath145 are in general not known . using @xmath146 and @xmath147",
    "we obtain @xmath148 .",
    "furthermore , setting @xmath149 implies @xmath150 hence combining   and   we get @xmath151    applying these results to solving @xmath78 via tsvd as described in the previous section , we get @xmath152 where @xmath153 is the upper frame bound .",
    "fortunately estimates for the upper frame bound are much easier to obtain than estimates for the lower frame bound .    thus using the standard setting @xmath138 or @xmath139",
    "a good choice for the regularization parameter @xmath141 is @xmath154\\ , .",
    "\\label{thresh}\\ ] ] extensive numerical simulations confirm this choice , see also section  [ s : applications ] .",
    "for instance for the reconstruction problem of example  1 with noise - free data and machine precision @xmath155 , formula   implies @xmath156 $ ] .",
    "this coincides very well with numerical experiments .",
    "if the noise level @xmath128 is not known , it has to be estimated .",
    "this difficult problem will not be discussed here .",
    "the reader is referred to  @xcite for more details .",
    "although we have arrived now at an implementable algorithm for the nonuniform sampling problem , the disadvantages of the approach described in the previous section are obvious . in general",
    "the matrix @xmath88 does not have any particular structure , thus the computational costs for the singular value decomposition are @xmath157 which is prohibitive large in many applications .",
    "it is definitely not a good approach to transform a well - posed infinite - dimensional problem into an ill - posed finite - dimensional problem for which a stable solution can only be computed by using a `` heavy regularization machinery '' .",
    "the methods in  @xcite coincide with or are essentially equivalent to the truncated frame approach , therefore they suffer from the same instability problems and the same numerical inefficiency .      as mentioned above one way to stabilize",
    "the solution of @xmath78 is a truncated singular value decomposition , where the truncation level serves as regularization parameter . for large @xmath71",
    "the costs of the singular value decomposition become prohibitive for practical purposes .",
    "we propose the conjugate gradient method  @xcite to solve @xmath78 .",
    "it is in general much more efficient than a tsvd ( or tikhonov regularization as suggested in  @xcite ) , and at the same time it can also be used as a regularization method .",
    "the standard error analysis for cg can not be used in our case , since the matrix is ill - conditioned .",
    "rather we have to resort to the error analysis developed in  @xcite .",
    "when solving a linear system @xmath132 by cg for noisy data @xmath130 following happens .",
    "the iterates @xmath158 of cg may diverge for @xmath159 , however the error propagation remains limited in the beginning of the iteration .",
    "the quality of the approximation therefore depends on how many iterative steps can be performed until the iterates turn to diverge .",
    "the idea is now to stop the iteration at about the point where divergence sets in . in other words",
    "the iterations count is the regularization parameter which remains to be controlled by an appropriate stopping rule  @xcite .",
    "in our case assume @xmath160 , where @xmath161 denotes a noisy sample .",
    "we terminate the cg iterations when the iterates @xmath162 satisfy for the first time  @xcite @xmath163 for some fixed @xmath164 .",
    "it should be noted that one can construct `` academic '' examples where this stopping rule does not prevent cg from diverging , see  @xcite , `` most of the time '' however it gives satisfactory results .",
    "we refer the reader to  @xcite for a detailed discussion of various stopping criteria .",
    "there is a variety of reasons , besides the ones we have already mentioned , that make the conjugate gradient method and the nonuniform sampling problem a `` perfect couple '' .",
    "see sections  [ ss : trigpol ] ,  [ ss : ml ] , and  [ ss : regul ] for more details .    by combining the truncated frame approach with the conjugate gradient method ( with appropriate stopping rule ) we finally arrive at a reconstruction method that is of some practical relevance .",
    "however the only existing method at the moment that can handle large scale reconstruction problems seems to be the one proposed in the next section .",
    "in the previous section we have seen that the naive finite - dimensional approach via truncated frames is not satisfactory , it already leads to severe stability problems in the ideal case of regular oversampling . in this section",
    "we propose a different finite - dimensional model , which resembles much better the structural properties of the sampling problem , as can be seen below .",
    "the idea is simple . in practice only a finite number of samples @xmath13",
    "is given , where without loss of generality we assume @xmath165 ( otherwise we can always re - normalize the data ) . since no data of @xmath0 are available from outside this region we focus on a local approximation of @xmath0 on @xmath166 $ ] .",
    "we extend the sampling set periodically across the boundaries , and identify this interval with the ( properly normalized ) torus @xmath167 . to avoid technical problems at the boundaries in the sequel",
    "we will choose the interval somewhat larger and consider either @xmath168 $ ] or @xmath169 $ ] with @xmath170 .",
    "for theoretical considerations the choice @xmath168 $ ] is more convenient .",
    "since the dual group of the torus @xmath167 is @xmath171 , periodic band - limited functions on @xmath167 reduce to trigonometric polynomials ( of course technically @xmath0 does then no longer belong to @xmath8 since it is no longer in @xmath16 ) .",
    "this suggests to use trigonometric polynomials as a realistic finite - dimensional model for a numerical solution of the nonuniform sampling problem .",
    "we consider the space @xmath172 of trigonometric polynomials of degree @xmath173 of the form @xmath174 the norm of @xmath175 is @xmath176 since the distributional fourier transform of @xmath137 is @xmath177 we have @xmath178 $ ] .",
    "hence @xmath172 is indeed a natural finite - dimensional model for @xmath8 .    in general the @xmath1",
    "are not the samples of a trigonometric polynomial in @xmath172 , moreover the samples are usually perturbed by noise , hence we may not find a @xmath175 such that @xmath179 .",
    "we therefore consider the least squares problem @xmath180 here the @xmath181 are user - defined weights , which can be chosen for instance to compensate for irregularities in the sampling geometry  @xcite .    by increasing @xmath173 so that @xmath182 we can certainly find a trigonometric polynomial that interpolates the given data exactly .",
    "however in the presence of noise , such a solution is usually rough and highly oscillating and may poorly resemble the original signal .",
    "we will discuss the question of the optimal choice of @xmath173 if the original bandwidth is not known and in presence of noisy data in section  [ ss : regul ] .",
    "the following theorem provides an efficient numerical reconstruction algorithm .",

    "the bernstein - boas formula yields an explicit way to reconstruct a function @xmath9 from its ( sufficiently dense ) nonuniform samples @xmath239 , cf .",
    "this formula involves the numerically intractable computation of infinite products .",
    "however since only a finite number of samples can be used in a numerical reconstruction one may assume that the sequence of sampling points has regular structure outside a finite interval .",
    "this allows to replace the infinite products by finite products which yields following approximation formula for @xmath0 @xmath240 and an estimate for the approximation error .",
    "although their approach is computationally more expensive than the algorithm proposed in section  [ s : trigpol ] their approach may be an attractive alternative if only a small number of samples in a short interval @xmath241 $ ] are available and if at the same time the signal to be reconstructed is `` strongly '' non - periodic on @xmath241 $ ] .",
    "we point out that other finite - dimensional approaches are proposed in  @xcite .",
    "these approaches may provide interesting alternatives in the few cases where the algorithm outlined in section  [ ss : trigpol ] does not lead to good results .",
    "these cases occur when only a few samples of the signal @xmath0 are given in an interval @xmath242 $ ] say , and at the same time we have @xmath243 and @xmath244 , i.e. , if @xmath0 is `` strongly non - periodic '' on @xmath242 $ ] .",
    "however the computational complexity of the methods in  @xcite is significantly larger .",
    "the approach presented above can be easily generalized to higher dimensions by a diligent book - keeping of the notation .",
    "we consider the space of @xmath245-dimensional trigonometric polynomials @xmath246 as finite - dimensional model for @xmath247 . for given samples @xmath1 of @xmath248 , where @xmath249",
    ", we compute the least squares approximation @xmath207 similar to theorem  [ th : act ] by solving the corresponding system of equations @xmath198 .    in 2-d for instance the matrix @xmath188 becomes a block toeplitz matrix with toeplitz blocks  @xcite . for a fast computation of the entries of @xmath19",
    "we can again make use of beylkin s usfft algorithm  @xcite . and similar to 1-d , multiplication of a vector by @xmath188",
    "can be carried out by 2-d fft .",
    "also the relation between the finite - dimensional approximation in @xmath246 and the infinite - dimensional solution in @xmath250 is similar as in 1-d .",
    "the only mathematical difficulty is to give conditions under which the matrix @xmath188 is invertible . since the fundamental theorem of algebra does not hold in dimensions larger than one , the condition @xmath251 is necessary but no longer sufficient for the invertibility of @xmath188 .",
    "sufficient conditions for the invertibility , depending on the sampling density , are presented in  @xcite .",
    "in this section we discuss several numerical aspects of nonuniform sampling that are very important from a practical viewpoint , however only few answers to these problems can be found in the literature .      in almost all theoretical results and numerical algorithms for reconstructing a band - limited signal from nonuniform samples",
    "it is assumed that the bandwidth is known a priori .",
    "this information however is often not available in practice .",
    "a good choice of the bandwidth for the reconstruction algorithm becomes crucial in case of noisy data .",
    "it is intuitively clear that choosing a too large bandwidth leads to over - fit of the noise in the data , while a too small bandwidth yields a smooth solution but also to under - fit of the data . and",
    "of course we want to avoid the determination of the `` correct '' @xmath2 by trial - and - error methods .",
    "hence the problem is to design a method that can reconstruct a signal from non - uniformly spaced , noisy samples without requiring a priori information about the bandwidth of the signal .",
    "the multilevel approach derived in  @xcite provides an answer to this problem .",
    "the approach applies to an infinite - dimensional as well as to a finite - dimensional setting .",
    "we describe the method directly for the trigonometric polynomial model , where the determination of the bandwidth @xmath2 translates into the determination of the polynomial degree @xmath173 of the reconstruction .",
    "the idea of the multilevel algorithm is as follows .",
    "let the noisy samples @xmath252 of @xmath9 be given with @xmath253 and let @xmath254 denote the orthogonal projection from @xmath8 into @xmath172 .",
    "we start with initial degree @xmath255 and run algorithm  [ th : act ] until the iterates @xmath256 satisfy for the first time the _ inner _ stopping criterion @xmath257 for some fixed @xmath164 .",
    "denote this approximation ( at iteration @xmath258 ) by @xmath259 . if @xmath259 satisfies the _",
    "outer _ stopping criterion @xmath260 we take @xmath259 as final approximation .",
    "otherwise we proceed to the next level @xmath261 and run algorithm  [ th : act ] again , using @xmath259 as initial approximation by setting @xmath262 .    at level @xmath263",
    "the inner level - dependent stopping criterion becomes @xmath264 while the outer stopping criterion does not change since it is level - independent .",
    "stopping rule   guarantees that the iterates of cg do not diverge .",
    "it also ensures that cg does not iterate too long at a certain level , since if @xmath173 is too small further iterations at this level will not lead to a significant improvement .",
    "therefore we switch to the next level .",
    "the outer stopping criterion   controls over - fit and under - fit of the data , since in presence of noisy data is does not make sense to ask for a solution @xmath265 that satisfies @xmath266 .    since the original signal @xmath0 is not known , the expression @xmath267 in   can not be computed . in  @xcite",
    "the reader can find an approach to estimate @xmath267 recursively .",
    "a variety of conditions on the sampling points @xmath268 are known under which the set @xmath48 is a frame for @xmath8 , which in turn implies ( at least theoretically ) perfect reconstruction of a signal @xmath0 from its samples @xmath1 .",
    "this does however not guarantee a stable reconstruction from a numerical viewpoint , since the ratio of the frame bounds @xmath269 can still be extremely large and therefore the frame operator @xmath29 can be ill - conditioned .",
    "this may happen for instance if @xmath270 in   goes to 1 , in which case @xmath271 may become large .",
    "the sampling problem may also become numerically unstable or even ill - posed , if the sampling set has large gaps , which is very common in astronomy and geophysics .",
    "note that in this case the instability of the system @xmath198 does _ not _ result from an inadequate discretization of the infinite - dimensional problem .",
    "there exists a large number of ( circulant ) toeplitz preconditioners that could be applied to the system @xmath198 , however it turns out that they do not improve the stability of the problem in this case .",
    "the reason lies in the distribution of the eigenvalues of @xmath188 , as we will see below .",
    "following  @xcite , we call two sequences of real numbers @xmath272 and @xmath273 _ equally distributed _ , if @xmath274 = 0 \\label{defdist}\\ ] ] for any continuous function @xmath275 with compact support and @xmath276 are required to belong to a common interval . ] .",
    "let @xmath277 be a @xmath278 circulant matrix with first column @xmath279 , we write @xmath280 .",
    "the eigenvalues of @xmath277 are distributed as @xmath281 .",
    "observe that the toeplitz matrix @xmath282 with first column @xmath283 can be embedded in the circulant matrix @xmath284 thms  4.1 and  4.2 in  @xcite state that the eigenvalues of @xmath282 and @xmath285 are equally distributed as @xmath286 where @xmath287 the partial sum of the series   is @xmath288    to understand the clustering behavior of the eigenvalues of @xmath188 in case of sampling sets with large gaps , we consider a sampling set in @xmath289 , that consists of one large block of samples and one large gap , i.e. , @xmath290 for @xmath291 for @xmath292 .",
    "( recall that we identify the interval with the torus ) .",
    "then the entries @xmath293 of the toeplitz matrix @xmath188 of   ( with @xmath294 ) are @xmath295 to investigate the clustering behavior of the eigenvalues of @xmath188 for @xmath296 , we embed @xmath188 in a circulant matrix @xmath297 as in  . then   becomes @xmath298}\\ ] ]",

    "thus the eigenvalues of @xmath188 are asymptotically clustered around zero and one .",
    "for general nonuniform sampling sets with large gaps the clustering at 1 will disappear , but of course the spectral cluster at 0 will remain . in this case",
    "it is known that the preconditioned problem will still have a spectral cluster at the origin  @xcite and preconditioning will not be efficient .",
    "fortunately there are other possibilities to obtain a stabilized solution of @xmath198 .",
    "the condition number of @xmath188 essentially depends on the ratio of the maximal gap in the sampling set to the nyquist rate , which in turn depends on the bandwidth of the signal .",
    "we can improve the stability of the system by adapting the degree @xmath173 of the approximation accordingly .",
    "thus the parameter @xmath173 serves as a regularization parameter that balances stability and accuracy of the solution .",
    "this technique can be seen as a specific realization of _ regularization by projection _ , see chapter  3 in  @xcite .",
    "in addition , as described in section  [ ss : regul ] , we can utilize cg as regularization method for the solution of the toeplitz system in order to balance approximation error and propagated error . the multilevel method introduced in section  [ ss : ml ]",
    "combines both features . by optimizing the level ( bandwidth ) and the number of iterations in each level it provides an efficient and robust regularization technique for ill - conditioned sampling problems .",
    "see section  [ s : applications ] for numerical examples .    0 in many applications the physical process that generates the signal implies not only that the signal is ( essentially ) band - limited but also that its spectrum of the signal has a certain rate of decay .",
    "for instance geophysical potential fields have exponentially decaying fourier transform .",
    "this a priori knowledge can be used to improve the accuracy of the approximation . instead of the usual regularization methods , such as tikhonov regularization , we propose a different , computationally much more efficient method .",
    "assume that the decay of the fourier transform of @xmath0 can be bounded by @xmath302 .",
    "typical choice in practice are @xmath303 or @xmath304 . for a given system",
    "@xmath305 define the diagonal matrix @xmath306 by @xmath307 .",
    "instead of solving @xmath308 we consider the `` weighted problem '' @xmath309 or @xmath310 in the first case the solution is @xmath311 and in the second case we have @xmath312 of course , if @xmath19 is invertible both solutions coincide with the solution of @xmath313 .",
    "however if @xmath19 is not invertible , then both equations lead to a weighted minimal norm least squares solution .",
    "note that @xmath306 is not chosen to minimize the condition number of the problem , since as outlined above standard preconditioning will not work in this case .",
    "systems   and   can be solved by conjugate gradient methods .",
    "hence the computational effort of such an approach is of the same order as algorithm  [ th : act ] .",
    "a detailed numerical analysis of the convergence properties of this approach has still to be completed .",
    "for a numerical example see section  [ ss : geo ] .",
    "we present two numerical examples to demonstrate the performance of the described methods .",
    "the first one concerns a 1-d reconstruction problem arising in spectroscopy . in the second example we approximate the earth s magnetic field from noisy scattered data .",
    "the original spectroscopy signal @xmath0 is known at 1024 regularly spaced points @xmath53 .",
    "this discrete sampling sequence will play the role of the original continuous signal .",
    "to simulate the situation of a typical experiment in spectroscopy we consider only 107 randomly chosen sampling values of the given sampling set .",
    "furthermore we add noise to the samples with noise level ( normalized by division by @xmath314 ) of @xmath315 .",
    "since the samples are contaminated by noise , we can not expect to recover the ( discrete ) signal @xmath0 completely . the bandwidth is approximately @xmath316 which translates into a polynomial degree of @xmath317 .",
    "note that in general @xmath2 and ( hence @xmath173 ) may not be available .",
    "we will also consider this situation , but in the first experiments we assume that we know @xmath2 .",
    "the error between the original signal @xmath0 and an approximation @xmath318 is measured by computing @xmath319 .",
    "first we apply the truncated frame method with regularized svd as described in section  [ ss : truncated ] .",
    "we choose the truncation level for the svd via formula  .",
    "this is the optimal truncation level in this case , providing an approximation with least squares error @xmath320 .",
    "figure  [ fig : spect](a ) shows the reconstructed signal together with the original signal and the noisy samples . without regularization",
    "we get a much worse `` reconstruction '' ( which is not displayed ) .",
    "we apply cg to the truncated frame method , as proposed in section  [ ss : cgtrunc ] with stopping criterion   ( for @xmath321 ) .",
    "the algorithm terminates already after 3 iterations .",
    "the reconstruction error is with @xmath322 slightly higher than for truncated svd ( see also  figure  [ fig : spect](b ) ) , but the computational effort is much smaller .    also algorithm  [ th : act ] ( with @xmath323 ) terminates after 3 iterations .",
    "the reconstruction is shown in  figure  [ fig : spect](c ) , the least squares error ( @xmath324 ) is slightly smaller than for the truncated frame method , the computational effort is significantly smaller .",
    "we also simulate the situation where the bandwidth is not known a priori and demonstrate the importance of a good estimate of the bandwidth .",
    "we apply algorithm  [ th : act ] using a too small degree ( @xmath325 ) and a too high degree ( @xmath326 ) .",

    "[ fig : spect](f ) , the error is @xmath330 , thus within the error bound @xmath128 , as desired .",
    "hence without requiring explicit information about the bandwidth , we are able to obtain the same accuracy as for the methods above .",
    "exploration geophysics relies on surveys of the earth s magnetic field for the detection of anomalies which reveal underlying geological features .",
    "geophysical potential field - data are generally observed at scattered sampling points .",
    "geoscientists , used to looking at their measurements on maps or profiles and aiming at further processing , therefore need a representation of the originally irregularly spaced data at a regular grid .",
    "the reconstruction of a 2-d signal from its scattered data is thus one of the first and crucial steps in geophysical data analysis , and a number of practical constraints such as measurement errors and the huge amount of data make the development of reliable reconstruction methods a difficult task .    it is known that the fourier transform of a geophysical potential field @xmath0 has decay @xmath331 .",
    "this rapid decay implies that @xmath0 can be very well approximated by band - limited functions  @xcite .",
    "since in general we may not know the ( essential ) bandwidth of @xmath0 , we can use the multilevel algorithm proposed in section  [ ss : ml ] to reconstruct @xmath0 .",
    "the multilevel algorithm also takes care of following problem .",
    "geophysical sampling sets are often highly anisotropic and large gaps in the sampling geometry are very common .",
    "the large gaps in the sampling set can make the reconstruction problem ill - conditioned or even ill - posed . as outlined in section  [ ss : regul ] the multilevel algorithm iteratively determines the optimal bandwidth that balances the stability and accuracy of the solution .",
    "figure  [ fig : geo](a ) shows a synthetic gravitational anomaly @xmath0 .",
    "the spectrum of @xmath0 decays exponentially , thus the anomaly can be well represented by a band - limited function , using a `` cut - off - level '' of @xmath332 for the essential bandwidth of @xmath0 .",
