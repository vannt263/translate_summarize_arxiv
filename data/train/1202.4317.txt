    "it has been suggested that the current expansion of the universe is accelerating by recent cosmological observations such as supernovae ia ( sne ia)@xcite , cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) radiation@xcite , large scale structure ( lss)@xcite , baryon acoustic oscillations ( bao)@xcite , and weak lensing  @xcite .",
    "there are two representative approaches to account for the late time cosmic acceleration .",
    "one is the introduction of cosmological constant dark energy in the framework of general relativity .",
    "the other is the modification of gravity , for example , @xmath2 gravity , where @xmath2 is an arbitrary function of the scalar curvature @xmath4 ( for recent reviews on @xmath2 gravity , see , e.g. , refs .  ) .",
    "one of the most important parameter in this issue is the equation of state ( eos ) for dark energy @xmath5 , which is the ratio of the pressure @xmath6 of dark energy to the energy density @xmath7 of it .",
    "recent cosmological observational data@xcite also seems to indicate the crossing of the phantom divide line of @xmath1 of the eos for dark energy in the near `` past '' . in this paper , we concentrate on the evolution of @xmath0 .",
    "in particular , we review our main results on it in @xmath2 gravity@xcite , @xmath3 theory and non - local gravity@xcite . the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ aba : sec2 ] , we explicitly show that the future crossings of the phantom divide line @xmath1 are the generic feature in the existing viable @xmath2 gravity models . in sec .",
    "[ aba : sec3 ] , we demonstrate that the crossing of the phantom divide can be realized in the combined @xmath3 theory having the exponential and logarithmic terms . in sec .",
    "[ aba : sec4 ] , we evaluate the effective eos for the universe when a finite - time future singularity occurs in non - local gravity .",
    "the effective eos corresponds to the ratio of the total pressure to the total energy density of the universe .",
    "we use units of @xmath8 and denote the gravitational constant @xmath9 by @xmath10 with the planck mass of @xmath11gev .",
    "the action of @xmath2 gravity is given by @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the determinant of the metric tensor @xmath14 .",
    "here , we use the standard metric formalism .",
    "it is known that viability conditions for @xmath2 gravity are ( a ) positivity of the effective gravitational coupling , ( b ) stability of cosmological perturbations , ( c ) asymptotic behavior to the standard @xmath15-cold - dark - matter ( @xmath16 ) model in the large curvature regime , ( d ) stability of the late - time de sitter point , ( e ) constraints from the equivalence principle , and ( f ) solar - system constraints .",
    "we consider the following four viable models : ( i ) hu - sawicki@xcite , @xmath17/   \\left [ c_2 \\left(r / r_{\\mathrm{hs}}\\right)^p + 1\\right]$ ] , where @xmath18 , @xmath19 @xmath20 , @xmath21 are constant parameters ( for an extended model , see ref .  ) .",
    "( ii ) starobinsky@xcite , @xmath22 $ ] , where @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 are constant parameters .",
    "( iii ) tsujikawa@xcite , @xmath26 , where @xmath27 , @xmath28 are constant parameters .",
    "( iv ) the exponential gravity models , @xmath29 $ ] , where @xmath30 and @xmath31 are constant parameters .",
    "it has been examined that the crossing of the phantom divide can be realized in the above viable @xmath2 models on the past .",
    "we therefore explore the future evolution of @xmath0 .",
    "we take the flat friedmann - lematre - robertson - walker ( flrw ) metric @xmath32 . in this background ,",
    "@xmath0 is given by @xmath33 where @xmath34 , and the dot denotes the time derivative of @xmath35 , and @xmath36 is the hubble parameter . as a result",
    ", it has explicitly been demonstrated that in the future the crossings of the phantom divide are the generic feature in the viable @xmath2 gravity models ( i)(iv ) shown above .",
    "we mention that @xmath2 gravity models with realizing the crossings of the phantom divide have been reconstructed analytically@xcite and numerically@xcite .",
    "the new cosmological ingredient is that in the future the sign of @xmath37 changes from negative to positive due to the dominance of dark energy over non - relativistic matter . this is a common physical phenomena to the existing viable @xmath2 models and",
    "thus it is one of the peculiar properties of @xmath2 gravity models characterizing the deviation from the @xmath16 model .",
    "there is another procedure to study gravity beyond general relativity by using the weitzenbck connection , which has no curvature but torsion , rather than the curvature defined by the levi - civita connection .",
    "this approach is referred to ",
    "the teleparallel lagrangian density described by the torsion scalar @xmath38 has been extended to a function of @xmath38@xcite to account for the late - time cosmic acceleration as well as inflation in the early universe@xcite .",
    "this idea is equivalent to the concept of @xmath2 gravity , in which the ricci scalar @xmath4 in the einstein - hilbert action is promoted to a function of @xmath4 .",
    "the modified teleparallel action for @xmath3 theory is given by@xcite @xmath39 , where @xmath40 .",
    "in the teleparallelism , orthonormal tetrad components @xmath41 are used , where an index @xmath42 runs over @xmath43 for the tangent space at each point @xmath44 of the manifold . in the flat flrw background , by using the analysis method in ref .",
    ", we explicitly illustrate the cosmological evolution of @xmath0 in @xmath3 gravity , expressed as  @xcite @xmath45 where a prime denotes a derivative with respect to @xmath46 , @xmath47 and @xmath48 . since we are interested in the late time universe , we consider only non - relativistic matter ( cold dark matter and baryon ) , whose pressure is approximately zero .",
    "we have constructed an @xmath3 theory by combining the logarithmic and exponential terms in order to realize the crossing of the phantom divide : @xmath49 \\right\\ } $ ] with @xmath50\\right\\ } $ ] , where @xmath51 is the current torsion and @xmath52 is a constant .",
    "moreover , @xmath53 , where @xmath54 is the energy density of non - relativistic matter at the present time and @xmath55 is the critical density with @xmath56 being the current hubble parameter . we have shown that the crossing in the combined @xmath3 theory is from @xmath57 to @xmath58 , which is opposite to the typical manner in @xmath2 gravity models .",
    "non - local gravity produced by quantum effects has been proposed in ref .  .",
    "it is known that matter instability@xcite occurs in @xmath2 gravity and the curvature inside matter sphere becomes very large and hence the curvature singularity could appear@xcite .",
    "it is important to examine whether there exists the curvature singularity , called `` the finite - time future singularities '' , in non - local gravity .",

    "we consider the case in which the scalar fields @xmath64 and @xmath65 only depend on time . in this background , by deriving the gravitational field equations and the equations of motion for the scalar fields @xmath64 and @xmath65 and using these equations , we examine whether there exists the finite - time future singularities in non - local gravity . we analyze an asymptotic solution of the gravitational field equations in the limit of the time when the finite - time future singularities appear .",
