    "gravity deflects space - time . for this reason matter and energy , while bending geodesics , force other masses to move along keplerian trajectories . indeed gravity , by equivalence principle and better by general relativity , bends also massless photons .",
    "deflection of star s lights by sun , nearly eighty years ago , overthrown newtonian relativity leading to the most popular triumph of einstein s relativity .",
    "it is the gravitational bending of the light that gave life to gravitational microlensing ( paczynski @xcite , @xcite ; griest @xcite ; alcock @xcite ) , one of the best ways to see `` matter in the dark '' .",
    "however gravity shapes also time rate . indeed clocks are slowed in presence of heavy bodies ( earth , etc . ) .",
    "the well known gravitational redshift is ( as well as light bending ) a cornerstone of general relativity .",
    "time is slowed down near pulsars and totally frozen when observed , far away , near the schwarzschild radius of a black hole .",
    "+ the variable gravitational redshift on a fixed period due to the source motion with respect to the gravitating body is just `` shapiro phase shift '' ( shapiro @xcite ) .",
    "it has been predicted on early 1964 and observed , by delayed radar echoes grazing the sun and reflected by mercury ( 1967 ) and venus ( 1970 ) , by shapiro himself .",
    "we have not ( yet ) a powerful radar to inspect far away dark planets or machos in our galaxy .",
    "however nature does offer very precise clocks spread far in our galaxy : pulsars .",
    "the period of pulsars is stable , million or billion times better than our commercial clocks , competitive with the best laboratory ones on earth .",
    "the stability of the timing of pulsars is granted by the huge inertial momentum of the pulsar , its consequent large angular momentum and the negligible angular momentum losses .",
    "therefore pulsars are the timing candles in our shapiro delay search : their beating slowdown and speed up may inform us on the dark objects crossing along the line - of - sight .",
    "+ while geodesic accelerations suffer the gravitational field gradients ( proportional to the inverse of square distance ) at a given point , shapiro phase shift ( sps ) is a path integral of the field ( which decreases as the inverse of the distances ) : sps `` records '' the gravitational fields from the source to the observer and the delay is a cumulative effect .",
    "indeed there is both a geometrical delay ( which is proportional to gravitational fields ) as well as a gravitational shapiro delay which is roughly the path integral of the field .",
    "the consequent gravitational shapiro delay is a logarithmic function of the impact parameter and it is usually the dominant one at large impact parameter values of body encounters .",
    "this effect increases , nearly by a factor of one hundred , the characteristic impact distance of a detectable phase delay with respect to a microlensing event of magnification of the brightness of stars . therefore ,",
    "even the few hundreds pulsars in our galaxy offer a large enough sample to measure a few sps delay a year ( fargion & conversano @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "their imprint is a long - term `` anomalous '' negative contribute on the time derivative of the period of pulsars , superimposed to the slow - down positive one .",
    "depending on the strength of the event , the total @xmath0 can be still positive but lower . moreover a sub - sample of pulsars close to the ecliptic projection may monitor the solar system planets ( jupiter , mars ... ) as well as the solar sps , allowing a quantitative calibration and verification of the sps delay .",
    "the same technique may be deploied to observe far hypothetical unknown planets which may pollute at the far periphery of the solar system .",
    "their eventual rare infall and near encounter with the earth in the past might have left important geological imprints ( fargion & dar @xcite ) ; strong tidal forces might induce tsunami and volcanic activities as well as life extinction .",
    "shapiro phase delay may also reveal machos in our solar system neighbors while a collective correlation of the period derivatives may track the secret trajectories of far dark bodies in the space .",
    "the shapiro phase shift on pulsars ( spsp ) is the shapiro effect ( shapiro @xcite ) which influences the time of arrivals of the signal of the pulsars .",
    "+ the application of the spsp to the search of dark matter was first proposed by j. schneider ( @xcite ) . limiting to the case of strong lensing events , @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the mean impact parameter estimate based on visible matter",
    ", he constrained the observation of the phenomenon to the signals of extragalactic pulsars .",
    "larchenkova & doroshenko ( @xcite ) probably detected an event of spsp towards the galactic anticenter region .",
    "the authors claim the existence of a massive black hole of @xmath3 producing a strong lensing event .",
    "wex , gil & sendyk ( @xcite ) investigated the possibility of identifying machos in the galactic center region by means of spsp both for strong and weak lensing events . according to the authors",
    "the probability for observing an spsp with lens mass between @xmath4 and @xmath5 @xmath6 is quite reasonable but , for weak lensing events , it should not be possible to extract any information on the parameters of the lens ( mass , transverse velocity ... ) without making assumptions about both the intrinsic frequency @xmath7 and the intrinsic frequency derivative @xmath8 .",
    "+ we also analyzed the spsp effect in our previous works ( fargion & conversano @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "spsp may be responsible of the time derivative deviation and may explain the presence of a few negative pulse derivatives among 706 known pulsars .",
    "we estimated the mean optical depth for spsp events for weak lensing ( high impact parameters ) on the basis of present models of the distribution of luminous matter in our galaxy .",
    "we found that the spsp may play a role in @xmath0 deviations for just a @xmath9 event rate at a @xmath10 level for massive objects of @xmath11 .",
    "we expect a higher event rate for masses @xmath12 @xmath13 but at lower intensities of @xmath14 .",
    "events toward the galactic anticenter should be rarer to observe , as a result of the rapid decrease of the density of galactic matter with the distance from the center .",
    "moreover , the higher the typical mass of massive objects the lower the event rate for spsp should be expected . on the basis of these simple probability estimates",
    "we believe the event detected by larchenkova & doroshenko be rather a weak lensing event produced by a macho of mass much smaller than @xmath3 .",
    "we also showed how analogous collective spsp in globular clusters would also be possible .",
    "+ the fundamental equations for spsp can be summarized as follows .",
    "a massive object passing by the line - of - sight of a pulsar , with transverse velocity @xmath15 at a distance @xmath16 from the observer ( see figure [ spsp ] ) , produces a shapiro time delay .",
    "this is made of two terms : a first geometrical one , @xmath17 , which is the result of the angular deflection of the path and it is rapidly vanishing at large impact values : @xmath18 .",
    "the second term is the gravitational redshift due to the deflector field , @xmath19 , all along the wave trajectory and scales as the logarithm of the impact parameter @xmath20 : @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the distance from the observer to the source and @xmath23 is the dimensionless impact parameter of the macho from the line - of - sight of the source , in units of the einstein radius @xmath24 \\left[\\frac{d_{s}}{4 kpc}\\right ] \\left[\\frac{x_{d}}{0.5}\\right ]    \\left [ 2 - \\left ( \\frac{x_{d}}{0.5 } \\right ) \\right]\\ , } \\,\\;\\;\\ ; cm\\ ] ] where @xmath25 and @xmath26 is the usual notation as found in literature ( @xmath27 , for quick conversion ) .",

    "it has a maximum and a symmetric negative minimum for the values @xmath38 ( as shown in figure [ fderiv ] for values @xmath39 and @xmath40 ) .",
    "+ competitive gravitational delays in residual periods of the pulsars may occur due to doppler shifts induced by gravitational deflection of both unbounded objects ( planets , stars , black holes , ... ) and binary bounded objects near the pulsar ( the former being a step - like residual signal in the period of the pulsar while the latter being a periodic sinousoidal one ) .",
    "in this context the spsp leads to a recognizable , episodic , timely bell - shaped period variation .",
    "spsp period derivative should be added to the average positive derivative ( @xmath41 ) related to the intrinsic pulsar spin - down .",
    "our first inspection ( fargion & conversano @xcite , @xcite ) into the catalogue of 558 pulsars ( taylor et al .",
    "@xcite ) found out some `` anomalous '' negative period derivatives . in table",

    "the pulsar b0021 - 72c , which resides in the same globular cluster , has different values of @xmath0 even if the epoch of measurement is the same ( notwithstanding this still negative ) .",
    "we believe the newer value of @xmath0 be consistent , being similar to the value of b0021 - 72d and , maybe , being evidence of a collective spsp within the globular cluster .",
    "particular attention must be dedicated to the pulsar b1813 - 26 .",
    "it does not belong to any globular cluster nor to any binary system but increases its negative @xmath42 to a positive @xmath43 after a time interval of @xmath44 .",

    "+ the reported values of @xmath0 of the other pulsars in table [ table1 ] are equal in both the catalogues .",
    "on the basis of these data we can not produce a more precise statistic on the time development of the @xmath0 , in this sense only an on - line frequently updated database should be useful . +",
    "many sources of spsp can affect the time derivative of the period of the pulsars : local companions in binary systems , encounters of machos along the trajectory of the signal ( paczynski @xcite , @xcite ; griest @xcite ; alcock @xcite ) , gravitational waves , collective spsp in globular clusters ( fargion & conversano @xcite ) .",
    "moreover any massive object in solar system can , in principle , be a source of spsp . in this section",
    "we investigate on the possibility to use the spsp effect to discover dark planets and any other massive object close to our solar system . in the case of planets",

    "we count 73 pulsars which should be continuously monitored .",
    "+ there are two main contributes of @xmath0-deviation which affect any observed pulsar : a doppler effect @xmath46 ( as a result of both the relative motion of the pulsar and the revolution of the earth ) and a shapiro effect ( as a result of the gravitational action of the deflector on the optical path of the signal of the pulsar ) .",
    "+ the total time delay due to the two main contributes is : @xmath47 we take our attention to the gravitational one . for nearby deflectors",

    "we neglect the contribute of the geometrical deviation due to the fact that we are interested mainly in weak lensing ( large @xmath20 ) . the residual period time derivative can be found by time differentiating equation [ eqn10 ] . +",
    "as the dark planet search involves deflector masses much lower than stellar ones , the resulting @xmath0-deviations are much lower than what expected in galactic dark matter search .",
    "therefore a comprehensive analysis of what are all the possible sources of spsp in our solar system that can produce spsp @xmath0-deviations is needed .",
    "+ the removal of all of these effects , together with the improvement of the threshold of sensitivity , is important for the spsp technique in dark planet search to have success in solar system .",
    "here we propose two ways to achieve this : ( _ i _ ) the extraction of the frequency component corresponding to annual modulations on the timing ; ( _ ii _ ) the cross - correlation of the signals coming from an array of pulsars laying along the projection of ecliptic toward the galaxy .",
    "the low - intensity @xmath0-deviation scenario in solar system is quite complex .",
    "the sun and all the known planets produce @xmath0-deviations higher then or comparable to those expected in dark planet search .",
    "even the revolution of the moon around the earth and the rotation of the earth itself produce both doppler and spsp @xmath0-deviations .",
    "the evaluation of the time evolution of all of these contributes is important to ensure both a calibration and the removal of known additive disturbs in using spsp for dark planet search .",
    "all of these @xmath0-deviations are periodic .",
    "planets in solar system produce periodic spsp @xmath0-deviations with their own periods of revolution , the sun an annual one , the moon a monthly one and the rotation of the earth a daily one .",
    "the revolution of the earth produces also an annual doppler @xmath0-deviation ( the mutual attraction of known planets in solar system , which perturbs earth trajectory , should be included in this term ) , while the rotation of the earth a doppler daily one .",
    "+ the variation of the mutual distances among the planets causes the einstein radius @xmath60 to change .",
    "if we refer the observations to a geocentric observer , the variation is modulated by the annual revolution of earth .",
    "the relative variation of the einstein radius is : @xmath61 where we do not consider the term @xmath62 , being this negligible .",
    "we can distinguish three cases :    1 .",
    "this is the most probable case , where the deflector is located nearly half - way from the observer and the source .",
    "the einstein radius takes the general form of equation [ eqn2 ] .",
    "relative variations of few astronomical units do not affect significantly the signal coming from a pulsar located at distances @xmath64 . in these cases planets orbiting in distant stellar systems should not give detectable modulations due to the orbit of the planet .",
    "2 .   @xmath65 . in this case",
    "the deflector is close to the pulsar .",
    "the einstein radius depends on the deflector - source distance only , @xmath66 .",
    "if the pulsar were bound in a binary system its signal is modulated at the frequency of rotation when @xmath67 gets comparable with @xmath68 .",
    "3 .   @xmath69 .",
    "this is the case when the deflector is very close to our solar system .",
    "the einstein radius takes the form : @xmath70 , depending only on the deflector distance .",
    "if the deflector were a dark planet bounded to our solar system , relative variations of few astronomical units should be significant .",
    "the revolution of earth itself should infer to the signal an annual modulation as a result of the cyclic variation of @xmath71 . as an example , figure [ orbit ] shows the typical geocentric orbit of jupiter , together with the regular orbit of the sun .",
    "the mutual earth - jupiter distance , @xmath71 , varies periodically nearly twelve times during a whole revolution of jupiter .",
    "the period of this variation is exactly one year .",
    "therefore we expect that the @xmath0-deviation have two periodic components of modulation : a long - term one ( with a period of nearly twelve years ) , as a result of the revolution of jupiter , and a short - term one ( with a period of one year ) , as a result of the revolution of earth .",
    "any massive object passing close to our solar system should infer to the time arrivals of the pulsar a short - term @xmath60 modulation at a period of one year and , if bounded to solar system , a long - term @xmath60 modulation at its own period of revolution . .",

    "the key point is now to recognize which planets .",
    "+ - ) as the spsp modulations due to the other known planets can be easily calculated , one should check if long - term frequency components are present in the residual timing of the pulsar .",
    "if a long - term component at a known frequency , say , that of jupiter , is present , the corresponding short - term @xmath60 component must also be subtracted from the annual component .",

    "+ - ) any residual annual frequency component , free from both doppler and known - spsp effects , if still present , could reveal a massive nearby object .",
    "+ now , what is the sensitivity ?",
    "we can compare the change in shapiro time delay , as a result of a change in @xmath71 ( @xmath72 ) with the @xmath0 deviation .",
    "the procedure to calculate @xmath0 is ( fargion & conversano @xcite ) : @xmath73 where @xmath74 while @xmath72 is : @xmath75 comparing equations [ remodulationeq1 ] and [ remodulationeq3 ] and approximating @xmath76 , we find @xmath72 as a function of @xmath0 and the relative variation @xmath77 : @xmath78 where @xmath79 and @xmath80      any massive object either orbiting around or passing by close to our solar system may slow down the signal of more than one pulsar at the same time . in fact , the projection of its impact parameter subtends an angle wider than that subtended in the case of a far deflector .",
    "in this case we can use the whole array of known pulsars both to increase the detectability threshold and to trace the trajectory of the object via a collective statistics . with",
    "what threshold of detectability we can hope to achieve this ?",
    "we can choose the maximum acceptable angular impact parameter as , say , the latitude width of the subsample in table [ table2 ] ( @xmath81 ) .",
    "with this choice we can calculate what @xmath0-deviation a planet passing by one edge of the subsample generates on a pulsar laying on the other edge .",
    "the linear impact parameter @xmath82 becomes @xmath83 and the @xmath0-deviation ( equation [ eqn7 ] ) produced by the planet is : @xmath84 we can replace the dependence from @xmath85 with the distance @xmath71 of the deflector from the observer : @xmath86 where the distance @xmath87 of the deflector from the sun has been approximated to @xmath71 for large distances , @xmath88 and @xmath89 . in this case equation [ eqarray1 ]",

    "may greatly increase by coherent interference the sensitivity , leading to the discover of the vectorial motion of the `` dark '' object . in any case , as a first point of view on this matter , we can say that the combination of both the methods could be taken into act . a one - year modulated warning system would be useful for low - mass objects which can affect the residual timing of a pulsar at intensities well within the present observational detectability , while a combined statistic on many pulsars would be useful for the discovery of very low - mass celestial objects which would produce an spsp of very low intensity . in view of a possible need of the discover of dangerous impact trajectories of asteroids , and in view of a need of monitoring incoming mini - planets , the cross - time correlation of the periods of a net of pulsars may offer a unique tool able to see in the dark .",
