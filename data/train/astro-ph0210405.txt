    "blue compact galaxies ( bcgs ) are characterized by their very blue color , compact appearance , high gas content , strong nebular emission lines , and low chemical abundances ( kunth & \" ostlin 2000 ; stlin et al .",
    "these properties are typical of unevolved systems , thus suggesting that bcgs should have suffered very few bursts of star formation during their lives and that some of them are probably experiencing their first burst . in a recent review ,",
    "kunth & stlin ( 2000 ) argued that , despite a few remaining young galaxy candidates ( like i zw 18 , sbs 0335 - 052 ) , in most bcgs an old underlying stellar population does exist , revealing at least another burst of star formation ( sf ) prior to the present one ( papaderos 1996 ; kong & cheng 2002 ) .",
    "in addition , these properties make bcgs represent an extreme environment for star formation that differs from that in the milky way and in other quiescent nearby galaxies ( izotov & thuan 1999 ; izotov et al . 2001 ) . detailed studies of bcgs are important not only for understanding their intrinsic properties , but also for understanding of the chemical evolution of galaxies , for constraining models of stellar nucleosynthesis , for understanding star formation processes and galaxy evolution in different environments .    to measure the current star formation rates , stellar components , metallicities , and star formation histories and evolution of bcgs",
    ", we have prepared an atlas of optical spectra of the central regions of 97 blue compact galaxies in the first paper of this series ( kong & cheng 2002 ; paper i ) . because we want to combine the optical spectra we obtained with  data to constrain simultaneously the stellar and gas contents of bcgs , we selected most of our sample from  surveys by gordon & gottesman ( 1981 ) .",
    "the spectra were obtained at the 2.16 m telescope at the xinglong station of the beijing astronomical observatory ( bao ) in china .",
    "a 300 line mm@xmath1 grating was used to achieve coverage in the wavelength region from 3580 to 7400   with about 10  resolution .    in the present paper , we provide measurements of emission line equivalent widths and fluxes , equivalent widths of absorption lines , 4000  balmer break index , as well as fluxes at several points of the continuum for our bcgs sample .",
    "we explore the trends in emission line fluxes and equivalent widths in the integrated spectra of sfgs in the sample .",
    "the absorption features and the continuum colors will be used to study the stellar population components and star formation history of blue compact galaxies .",
    "the emission line equivalent widths and fluxes will be used to determine the physical parameters of blue compact galaxies .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2 ,",
    "we classify spectra according to their emission lines .",
    "emission line equivalent widths and fluxes measurements are presented in section 3 .",
    "section 4 describes the continuum determination and the measurements of stellar absorption equivalent widths . in section 5",
    "we present an analysis of the emission line equivalent widths , line ratios and blue magnitudes of bcgs .",
    "section 6 summarizes our conclusions .",
    "most of our bcgs sample was selected from the previous neutral hydrogen studies of blue compact galaxies by gordon & gottesman ( 1981 ) .",
    "this study has focused on the haro , markarian , and zwicky lists of galaxies and hence objects were selected on the basis of a blue color , uv - excess or compactness , but not on the basis of emission line strength ( smoker et al . 2000 ) .",
    "the optical spectral observations of these galaxies show a range in spectral properties ; from galaxies with absorption line spectra to narrow emission line objects classified as sfgs .    in order to study our sample galaxies in detail , we use emission lines to classify the sample spectra into three types : non - emission line galaxy ( non - elg ) , low - luminosity active galactic nuclei ( agn ) and star - forming galaxy ( sfg ) .",
    "our classification scheme is outlined below .    because the  recombination line is easily detected in optical spectrum and only weakly affected by dust and underlying stellar absorption , we first separated the spectra into two broad categories , emission line galaxy and non - emission line galaxy , using the   recombination line . when  is detected in emission , we classified the galaxy as an emission line galaxy , otherwise as a non emission line galaxy . 13 of 97 bcgs spectra have no  recombination emission lines , and were classified as non - elgs .",
    "stellar   absorption lines are , in fact , prominent in all of these spectra .",
    "next we classify the remaining 84 emission line spectra into active galactic nuclei and star - forming galaxies based on the next 3 steps :    1 .   because of their very large permitted line widths , seyfert 1 galaxies are easily recognizable .",
    "we classify 5 galaxies ( mrk 335 , mrk 352 , mrk 6 , i zw 26 , and mrk 50 ) with broad emission lines in their spectra as seyfert 1 galaxies",

    "the rest - frame equivalent widths , @xmath9 , and integrated fluxes , @xmath10 , of the emission lines were measured by direct numerical integration , using the splot program in iraf .",
    "the continuum levels and integration limits for the lines were set interactively , with repeat measurements made in difficult case .",
    "for single emission lines such as 4861 , 5007 , direct integral methods were used .",
    "this method allows the measurement of lines with asymmetric shapes ( i.e. with deviations from gaussian profiles ) . for blended lines such as , 6548,6583 , and",

    "the interactive method allows us to control by eye the level of the continuum , taking into account defects that may be present around the line measured .",
    "it does not have the objectivity of automatic measurements , but it does allow us to obtain reliable , accurate measurements .",

    "the second line for each entry lists an estimate of the error ( see in sec 3.2 ) .",
    "we use the convention that positive equivalent widths denote emission to conserve space and improve readability .",
    "a dash in the table indicates either that the corresponding segment of the spectrum is lacking or that the spectrum was too noisy in the region to give a reliable value of equivalent widths .",
    "we have chosen an equivalent width of 1.0   as the lower limit for true detection .",
    "the observed emission line fluxes ( the galactic foreground reddening were corrected , see kong & cheng 2002 ) are listed in table 2 .      for measurements of emission lines and absorption lines where the slope and curvature of the continuum are well defined ,",
    "the main sources of random errors in the flux and equivalent width measurements are the uncertainty of the overall height of the continuum level , the individual intensity points within the interval of integration , the signal - to - noise ratio of the continuum , and the uncertainty in the choice of the best - fitting profile parameter . to estimate @xmath12 standard deviations of emission lines , we followed the method outlined in tresse et al .",

    "1999 ) :    @xmath14    the error @xmath15 with equivalent width @xmath16 of the line can be expressed as :    @xmath17    where @xmath18 is the mean standard deviation per pixel of the continuum on each side of the line , @xmath19 is the spectral dispersion in   per pixel ( for our spectral sample , d=4.8 ) and @xmath20 is the number of pixels covered by the line . because the signal - to - noise ratio for each pixel was estimated by scaling the continuum variance according to poisson statistics , these are not exactly the formal statistical @xmath12 errors of @xmath10 or @xmath16 .",
    "our approximation slightly overestimates the errors , but in our analysis , we are mainly interested in the consistency of the estimation of errors .    in figure",

    "the result shows our equivalent widths limit is at a @xmath22 confidence level for those commonly found emission lines , and the typical uncertainty in these measurements is less than 10% . for those less common lines , such as 4340 , 6300 , the measurements typically have confidence levels @xmath23 , and",
    "the typical uncertainty in these measurements is about 20% .",
    "fluxes of emission lines will be used to determine the internal reddening of emission line regions , the star formation rate , and the element abundance of galaxies .",
    "it is known that the measurements are an underestimate of the real flux of the spectral lines , because of the underlying absorption component . to correct the underlying stellar absorption , some authors ( such as popescu & hopp 2000 ) adopt a constant equivalent width ( @xmath24  ) for all the hydrogen absorption lines . because the real value of the absorption equivalent width is uncertain and dependent on the age of star formation burst and star formation history ( izotov et al . 1994 ; gonz ' alez delgado et al . 1999 ) , the other usual correction for the contamination by stellar absorption lines assumes absorption equivalent widths , and iterates until the color excesses derived from / , / , and / ratios converge to the same value ( izotov et al .",

    "we have applied an empirical population synthesis method , which uses observed properties of star clusters as a _ base _",

    "the extinction of interstellar dust in sfgs modifies the spectra of these objects .",

    "we plot the  emission equivalent width as a function of @xmath0 for the sfgs in our sample . a pronounced trend towards larger equivalent widths at lower luminosities can be found , galaxies with the strongest  lines are of low luminosity .",

    "thus , a large equivalent widths is due either to a large uv flux ( or @xmath58 absolute magnitude since they are correlated ) , or to a low continuum from old stars . in either case",
    ", this implies a blue continuum color .",
    "hence , the observed trend of larger @xmath16 ( ) for fainter galaxies implies that the faint sfg population is dominated by blue galaxies , while the bright sfg population is dominated by redder galaxies .    in the bottom panel of figure [ eqw - amb ] ,",
    "we plot the 6583 emission line equivalent width as a function of @xmath0 for the sfgs in our sample .",
    "its equivalent width behaves in the opposite way , lower luminosity systems tend to have smaller equivalent widths .",
    "such a trend has also been found in other studies of nearby galaxies ( jansen et al .",
    "the global behavior of 6583 @xmath16 reflects intrinsic differences in the nitrogen abundance in bcgs , on average luminous bcgs are likely to be enhanced in nitrogen abundance .",
    "this suggests that , in faint , low - mass , bcgs , nitrogen is a primary element , whereas in brighter , more massive bcgs it comes from a secondary source .      in deep large optical surveys , low - resolution spectroscopy or narrowband  imaging",
    "is often used .  and 6548 , 6583 lines are often blended , so it is important to recover the flux solely in  to measure for instance the  luminosity function , hence to derive a star formation rate .",
    "figure  [ niiha]a shows that the 6583/  @xmath16 ratio decreases as a function of @xmath16 ( ) . all the spectra in this figure have @xmath16 ( ) and @xmath16 ( ) @xmath59 10  , which can be measured very accurately . the 6583/  equivalent widths ratio is strongly correlated with @xmath16 ( ) . a least - squares fit of this relation yields : log @xmath16(6583)@xmath60 ( ) = @xmath61 log @xmath16 ( ) .    since @xmath62}}6583 ) = 3ew({\\hbox{[n\\,{\\sc ii}]}}6548)$ ] , we also plot the relation 1.33 @xmath62}}6583)$]/ @xmath63 versus @xmath64}}6583)$ ] in figure  [ niiha]b .",

    "emission line fluxes are primary traces of the star formation rate ( sfr ) in galaxies ( kennicutt 1998 ) . for star - forming galaxies ,",
    "the balmer emission line luminosities scale directly with the ionizing fluxes of the embedded young stars , and this makes it possible to use the balmer lines to derive sfrs in galaxies .",
    "is the best line for such applications , but beyond @xmath70 , this line is redshifted into the near infrared . to find other tracers of sfr we analyze the fluxes of other emission lines as a function of the intrinsic  flux .",
    "since the various prominent emission lines correlate with each other , any of them is likely to be a first order ranking indicator of sfr of star - forming galaxies , but the strongest correlations are found between 3727 , 4340 ,  and .",
    "3727 is the most useful star formation tracer in the blue . in figure [ flux - ha]a",
    ", we show the flux of 3727 as a function of the intrinsic   flux .",
    "we found , as expected , these two lines have a strong correlation .    from purely astrophysical considerations , the most reliable star formation tracers in the blue should be the higher order balmer lines , since the fluxes of these lines scale directly with the massive star formation and are nearly independent of the temperature and ionization level of the emitting gas .",
    "figure [ flux - ha]b shows the relation between the fluxes of  and .",
    "a strong , roughly linear correlation between  and  is apparent .",
    "this correlation confirms that the  line can serve as a reliable star formation tracer in strong emission line galaxies , such as the sfgs in our bcg sample .",
    "in addition , the correlation between the intrinsic fluxes of  and  is stronger than that between the fluxes of  and ,  is another good star formation tracer for sfgs .",
    "recently , charlot & longhetti ( 2001 ) quantified the uncertainties in these sfr estimators .",
    "they found sfr estimates based purely on one of emission line luminosity of galaxies could be in error by more than an order of magnitude . on the other hand , with the help of other emission lines",
    ", these errors can be substantially reduced .",
    "based on our high quality spectrophotometric data , we can derive star formation rate for each galaxy , using these different star formation rate estimators .",
    "numerous studies have claimed the existence of a metallicity - luminosity relation in a variety of classes of galaxies : dynamically hot galaxies , i.e. ellipticals , bulges , and dwarf spheroidals , dwarf  galaxies , irregular galaxies and spirals ( lequeux et al .",

    "1998 ) and 6583/3727 ( dopita et al . 2000 ) as a function of the total absolute blue magnitude @xmath0 .",
    "the line flux ratios were corrected for both internal ( using the value of @xmath32 ) and galactic extinction , and underlying stellar absorption .",
    "since the reddening correction becomes more uncertain for galaxies with small @xmath16 ( ) and @xmath16 ( ) , we only use those objects that have @xmath16 ( ) @xmath59 5   and thus the most reliable reddening corrections .",
    "we do find a good correlation between @xmath0 and the metallicity indices 6583/  and @xmath71 .",
    "the correlation of the 6583/3727 index with @xmath0 is statistically significant , but at a rather low level .",
    "these metallicity indices show clear trends with galaxy absolute magnitude , confirming that indeed there is a relation in blue compact galaxies between the overall metallicity of the star forming regions and the galaxy luminosity .",

    "( 1994 ) found no evidence for a systematic dependence between reddening and abundance in a sample of 39 disk galaxies . in other contexts , stasi ' nska & sodr ' e(2001 ) found that the nebular extinction as derived from the balmer decrement strongly correlates with the effective metallicity of the emission line regions of spiral galaxies .",
    "figure [ fig - metal]d shows @xmath32 as a function of the metallicity indicator 6583/ , which is less affected by the reddening correction .",
