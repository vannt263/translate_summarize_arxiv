    "in systems possessing spatial or dynamical symmetry breaking , brownian motion combined with unbiased external input signals , deterministic or random alike , can assist directed motion of particles at submicron scales@xcite .",
    "this subject was motivated by the challenge to explain unidirectional transport in biological systems@xcite , as well as their potential technological applications ranging from classical non - equilibrium models@xcite to quantum systems@xcite .",
    "ratchets have been proposed to model the unidirectional motion driven by zero - mean non - equilibrium fluctuations . broadly speaking , ratchet devices fall into three categories depending on how the applied perturbation couples to the substrate asymmetry : rocking ratchets@xcite , flashing ratchets@xcite , and correlation ratchets @xcite .",
    "additionally , entropic ratchets , in which brownian particles move in a confined structure , instead of a potential , were also extensively studied @xcite .",
    "these ratchets demand three key ingredients @xcite which are ( a)nonlinearity : it is necessary since the system will produce a zero mean output from zero - mean input in a linear system ; ( b)asymmetry ( spatial and/or temporal ) : it can violate the symmetry of the response ; ( c ) fluctuating input zero - mean force : it should break thermodynamical equilibrium .",
    "+ most studies on ratchets have referred to the consideration of normal diffusion driven by gaussian noises . however , in the past few years , anomalous diffusion has attracted growing attention , being observed in various field of physics and related sciences @xcite . because the lvy flights do not possess a finite mean - square displacement , their physical significance has been ignored for a long time . however , in the recent years , the growing experimental evidences suggest that there is a need to consider a more general type of noise than gaussian , i. e. , lvy noise",
    ". description of physical models in terms of lvy flights becomes more and more popular @xcite .",
    "they are actually observed in various real systems and are used to model a variety of processes such as bulk mediated surface diffusion @xcite , exciton and charge transport in polymers under conformational motion @xcite , transport in micelle systems or heterogeneous rocks @xcite , two - dimensional rotating flow @xcite , and many others@xcite .",
    "+ very few studies on ratchets have focused on the lvy flights . recently , dybiec and coworkers @xcite studied the minimal setup for a lvy ratchet and found that due to the nonthermal character of the lvy noise , the net current can be obtained even in the absence of whatever additional time - dependent forces .",
    "del - castillo - negrete and coworkers @xcite also found the similar results in constant force - driven lvy ratchet for @xmath0 ( @xmath1 is lvy index ) .",
    "rosa and beims @xcite studied the optimal transport and its relation to superdiffusive transport and lvy walks for brownian particles in ratchet potential in the presence of modulated environment and external oscillating forces . in these studies",
    "the lvy noise is an intrinsic driving factor to obtain the net transport . in",
    "the classical forced thermal ratchets @xcite , the driving factor is usually the external ac - driving force .",
    "however , what s the difference between the intrinsic driver and the external one ? how do lvy flights compete with the ac - driving forces ? in order to answer these questions , in the present paper , we studied the transport of overdamped particles in an asymmetrically periodic potential in the presence of the lvy flights and ac - driving forces .",
    "our emphasis is on finding the difference between the two driving factors and how the competition between them affects the transport .",
    "in this study , we consider the transport of brownian particles moving in an asymmetrically periodic potential in the presence of ac - driving forces and lvy - stable noises .",
    "the overdamped dynamics can be described by the following langevin equation in the dimensionless form @xmath2 where @xmath3 and @xmath4 are the driving amplitude and frequency , respectively .",
    "the prime stands for differentiation over @xmath5 .",

    ", we mainly focus on the transport of the driven particles . in the gaussian noise driving ratchets , due to the existence of the mean value of the noise , the displacement of particles also possesses a mean and the transport can be characterized by the average velocity . however , for the noise with distribution of a lvy - stable law with @xmath28 , the mean of the noise and the overall displacement does not exist .",
    "the main feature of this distribution is that the tails can not be cut off , or in other words , rare but large events can not be neglected . as a consequence ,",
    "the classical stochastic theory ( average velocity ) , which is based on the ordinary central limit theorem , is no longer valid .",
    "recently , dybiec and coworkers @xcite proposed a different approach to the lvy ratchet problem based on the group velocity analysis for @xmath29 . throughout the paper",

    "a median line for a stochastic process @xmath30 is a function of @xmath31 given by the relationship @xmath32 .",
    "therefore , one can use the derivative of the median to define the group velocity of the particle packet@xcite , @xmath33 and this definition is valid even for the case of lacking average current . in the following ,",
    "we mainly focus on the study of the long time group velocity , @xmath34 in our simulations , we have considered more than @xmath35 realizations to obtain the accurate median . in order to provide the requested accuracy of the system dynamics time step was chosen to be smaller than @xmath36 .",

    ", the lvy ratchet reduces to the classical forced thermal ratchet @xcite . in this case",
    ", the only resource driving particle current across the barrier is the ac - driving force . in the adiabatic limit @xmath42 ,",
    "the ac - driving force can be expressed by two opposite forces @xmath3 and @xmath43 .",
    "the particles get enough time to cross both side from the minima of the potential . it is easier for particles to move toward the slanted side than toward the steeper side ,",
    "so the group velocity is positive . on increasing the frequency @xmath4 , due to the high frequency",
    ", the particles in one period get more enough time to climb the barrier from the steeper side than from the slanted side , resulting in negative group velocity . when the ac - driving forces oscillate very fast",

    "the group velocity crosses zero and subsequently reverse its direction .",
    "however , when @xmath45 , due to the nonthermal character of lvy noise , lvy noise becomes another source driving the particle current . as the index @xmath1 decreases , the positive group velocity decreases while the negative group velocity increases . especially , for @xmath46 , the lvy flights dominate the transport and the group velocity is even always negative .",
    "it is obvious that the transport driven by the lvy flights is opposite to that driven by the ac - driving forces for not too small values of the lvy noise intensity . in the same potential",

    "figure 3 illustrates the dependence of group velocity @xmath41 on the lvy index @xmath1 with and without ac - driving forces . from the figure",
    "we can see that the rectified transport can occur even the external driving forces are absent .",
    "this is due to the nonthermal character of the lvy noise which can break the thermaldynamical equilibrium .",
    "interestingly , one can see that the curves demonstrate nonmonotonic behavior for small values of the noise intensity .",
    "these phenomena can be explained by the interplay between the potential profile and lvy flights .",
    "firstly , the particles stay in the minima of the potential awaiting large noise pulses to be catapulted out . for not too small values of lvy index , the lvy flights are shorter , and the outliers in the lvy noise are smaller , the distance from minima to maxima dominates the transport . in this case",
    "this distance is shorter from the steeper side ( the left side ) than that from the slanted side ( the right side ) .",
    "consequently , most of the particles are thrown out from the steeper side , resulting in negative group velocity .",
    "however , for very small values of lvy index , the lvy flights are longer , and the outliers in the lvy noise are larger . in this case , the slope of the potential dominates the transport .",
    "so it is easier for the particles moving toward the slanted side than toward the steeper side and the group velocity is positive .",
    "therefore , there exists an intermediate value of @xmath1 at which the group velocity takes its extra value and the group velocity as a function of the lvy index is nonmonotonic .",
    "however , for large values of the noise intensity , the curves demonstrate monotonic behavior .",
    "this case was reported in ref.[21 ] .",
    "when a large ac - driving force ( @xmath40 ) is added , the ac - driving force dominates the transport and the group velocity is positive .",
    "however , the shape of the curve is similar to that without the ac - driving forces .     as a function of the noise intensity @xmath50 at @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",

    "when the driving amplitude @xmath3 is small , the lvy flights will dominate the transport and the group velocity is negative . on increasing the amplitude @xmath3",
    ", the ac - driving forces gradually dominate the transport and the group velocity crosses zero and becomes positive , namely , transport reversal occurs .",
    "when @xmath60 , the group velocity tends to zero for small driving fores ( @xmath61 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 , and @xmath58 ) and goes to a finite value for large driving forces ( @xmath62 , @xmath55 , and @xmath56 ) .",
    "this is due to the fact that in the determined ratchets the net current occurs for large driving forces and disappears for small driving forces .",
    "when @xmath63 , the effects of the potential and the ac - driving forces disappear , so the group velocity tends to zero . for suitable amplitude @xmath3",

    "we next investigate the role of the amplitude @xmath3 on the transport .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "it is found that the group velocity will tend to a negative constant for very small driving forces . as we know",
    "that in a classical forced thermal ratchet @xcite the velocity will tend to zero for very small driving forces .",
    "the nonthermal character of the lvy noise induces this different behavior . for very large values of the amplitude ,",
    "the influence of the potential and the lvy flights will become negligible and the group velocity goes to zero . at some intermediate values of amplitude @xmath3 , the group velocity crosses zero and reverses it direction .",
    "in this paper , we studied the transport of overdamped particles moving in an asymmetrically periodic potential in the presence of ac - driving forces and lvy flights . because the mean of the lvy noise and the mean of the overall displacement do not exist , the definition of the average velocity may be invalid .",
    "therefore , throughout the study we use the group velocity proposed by dybiec and coworkers @xcite to measure the transport of overdamped particles . from the langevin numerical simulations",
    ", we found that ac - driving forces and lvy flights are the two different drivers in nature that can break thermodynamical equilibrium .",
    "the competition between the two driving factors induces some peculiar phenomena . due to the lvy flights",
    ", the group velocity tends to a negative constant , instead of zero , for fast - driving limit and it may be always negative for small value of the lvy index .",
    "we also found that the relation between the group velocity and lvy index is nonmonotonic for small values of the noise intensity .",
    "there exists an intermediate value of lvy index at which the group velocity takes its extreme value .",
    "remarkably , multiple transport reversals occur when the noise intensity changes .",
    "this is caused by the competition between the ac - driving forces and lvy flights .",
    "though the model presented does not pretend to be a realistic model for a real system , beyond its intrinsic theoretical interest , the results we have presented have potential applications in many processes such as diffusive transport in plasmas , particles separation with non - gaussian diffusion , and ratchet transport in biology systems that are intrinsically out of equilibrium .",
