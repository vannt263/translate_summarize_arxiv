    "the aim of this paper is to provide a method to determine the location and scale relationship between two groups of one - dimensional observations for two samples , say @xmath0 and @xmath1 , such as the responses of two different products on different subjects , the scores of people on two examinations and so on .",
    "suppose @xmath2 are independent identity distributed according to @xmath3 and @xmath4 are independent identity distributed according to @xmath5 , where @xmath3 and @xmath5 are two unknown distribution functions . when the test for normality is not passed , nonparametric analysis methods should be applied . usually , the mean difference or midian difference of the two samples is used to determine the location difference and use mean ratio or midian ratio to obtain the scale .",
    "they are not reliable since only a small information of the two samples are extracted and the results are not meaningful .",
    "based on the idea of location - scale transformation , freitag , munk and vogt @xcite has developed an approach to access the structure relationship between distributions , in which the whole information of the samples are used . however , the problem we concern are the location difference and scale between two distributions rather than the model structure . that s to say , we have to determine the values of location difference or scale or both for any two distributions . using the same transformation idea ,",
    "our approach can be described as follows .",
    "let @xmath6 a linear function , i.e. , @xmath7 , where @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "@xmath10 is a given measure of discrepancy between two distributions .",
    "denote the distribution function of @xmath11 by @xmath12 .",
    "let @xmath13 .",
    "we want to find the value @xmath14 which minimize @xmath15 .",
    "that s to say , if we transform @xmath2 to be @xmath16 , the two groups of observations are closest and under the `` closest '' mean we can not tell there are any location difference or scale between them .",
    "therefore , we can say @xmath4 is at least @xmath17 larger than @xmath18 times of @xmath2",
    ".    there are situations where @xmath14 is not unique .",
    "let @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "conservatively , at first we can take @xmath22 if @xmath23 , else @xmath24 ; then take @xmath17 to be the value in @xmath25 satisfying @xmath26 .",
    "when @xmath27 is a continues region , it is easy to see that the selected @xmath14 is unique .",
    "therefore , we should find certain @xmath10 that @xmath27 is a continues region .",
    "besides , if we let @xmath28 in @xmath29 , the location difference between @xmath30 and @xmath31 could be determined .",
    "if we let @xmath32 in @xmath29 , the scale between @xmath30 and @xmath31 could be determined . in practice",
    ", we could use the empirical distributions of the two group of data for @xmath3 and @xmath5 , respectively . the discrepancy measure",
    "@xmath10 we consider in this paper will be focused on mallows distance and expand to kolmogorov - smirnov distance .",
    "mallows distance was presented in the formulation of statistics framework in 1972 , however , an independent physics research work had involved such a related concept a little earlier in 1940s .",
    "the rest of the paper is unfolded as follows . in section 2",
    "the main results under mallows distance for the location transformation , scale transformation or both are presented , showing that we can uniquely determine the location and scale relationship between two distributions and thus mallows distance is suitable discrepancy measure to use . in section 3",
    "the similar results can be obtained under kolmogorov - smirnov distance but only for location transformation .",
    "section 4 gives the application of this approach to determine the location and scale relationship on real data .",
    "in this subsection , we consider the proposed approach under mallows distance . formally , the mallows @xmath33-distance ( also known as wasserstein @xmath33-distance ) between distributions @xmath3 and @xmath5 regarding to random variables @xmath34 and @xmath35 , respectively , is defined as @xmath36 where the infimum is taken over the set ( denoted by @xmath37 ) of all joint distributions of @xmath34 and @xmath35 with marginals @xmath3 and @xmath5 . here",
    "we require that @xmath34 and @xmath35 have finite @xmath33th moment , i.e. , @xmath38 and @xmath39 .    for @xmath40 , the mallows @xmath33-distance @xmath41 has the two properties .",
    "* mallows distance @xmath41 , i.e. satisfies axioms of a metric on @xmath37 . * the convergence of distributions in mallows distance is equivalent to weak convergence plus @xmath33th moment convergence.(lavina and bickel , 2001 )    let @xmath42 be an uniform random variable , @xmath43 , and @xmath44 is the inverse of a distribution function , @xmath45 .",
    "according to johnson and samworth ( 2005 ) we know @xmath46 equation ( [ eq - u ] ) gives an easier computation formula to calculate the distance , that is @xmath47 particularly , when @xmath48 , we have a further relationship for computation @xmath49 which is especially useful when calculating mallows 1-distance using empirical distribution for real data , in order to circumvent the unknown real distribution .",
    "let @xmath50 , where @xmath8 and @xmath51 , and @xmath52 be its distribution function , then it is easy to obtain that @xmath53 .",
    "the purpose of our approach is to find the optimal shift and scale values @xmath14 to minimizing the mallows @xmath33-distance between @xmath54 and @xmath55 , that is @xmath56    then the following result can be obtained .    [ thr-1 ] for distribution functions @xmath3 and @xmath5 , let @xmath53 with @xmath57 .",
    "then the mallows @xmath33-distance ( @xmath58 ) between @xmath54 and @xmath55 , denoted by @xmath29 , a function of two variables @xmath59 and @xmath60 , is a continuous and convex function on half plane , i.e. , for any @xmath61 , and @xmath62 , @xmath63 , it holds that @xmath64    it can be easily obtained that @xmath65 . from ( [ eq - uu ] )",
    ", we know @xmath66 then the continuity of the @xmath67 is trivial . besides , using minkowski unequality we have    @xmath68    according to the definition of theorem [ thr-1 ] , scaled parameter @xmath59 should be greater than zero , but we can easily give an apparent analysis of transformed distribution function if @xmath69 .",
    "@xmath70    also , the theorem shows that under mallows @xmath33-distance ( @xmath71 ) @xmath67 is a convex function of @xmath72 , thus ( [ eq-1 ] ) is a continues region",
    ". we can select @xmath14 according to the plan in section [ sec : intro ] . if we only consider the shifted case or scaled case , let @xmath28 or @xmath32 in @xmath67 ,",
    "then we can obtain the following results .",
    "for distribution functions @xmath3 and @xmath5 , let @xmath73 .",
    "then the mallows @xmath33-distance ( @xmath58 ) between @xmath54 and @xmath55 , denoted by @xmath74 , a function of @xmath60 , is a continuous and convex function on @xmath75 , i.e. for any @xmath61 , and @xmath63 , it holds that @xmath76    for distribution functions @xmath3 and @xmath5 , let @xmath77 with @xmath57 .",
    "the mallows distance ( @xmath58 ) between the scaled distribution @xmath54 and @xmath55 , denoted as @xmath78 , a function of @xmath59 , is a continuous and convex function on @xmath79 , i.e. for any @xmath61 , and @xmath62 , it holds that @xmath80    in order to illustrate @xmath67 may not be strictly convex , let distributions @xmath3 and @xmath5 to be @xmath81 actually , @xmath3 is the uniform distribution over two half unit intervals @xmath82 $ ] and @xmath83 $ ] , and @xmath5 is uniform over @xmath84 $ ] . from ( [ eq - uuu ] )",
    "we know @xmath74 can be calculated via @xmath85 .",
    "then it is easy to verify that @xmath74 reaches minimum of 0.5 in the entire interval @xmath86 $ ] .",
    "the optimal shifted value for @xmath87 is not unique .",
    "therefore , @xmath74 is not strictly convex on @xmath75 , nor is @xmath67 .",
    "since our approach is successful under mallows distance , there is nothing preventing us from exploring other discrepancy measure . here , we are able to realize our approach for shifted case under kolmogorov - smirnov distance ( k - s distance ) , @xmath88 .    for k - s distance and distribution functions @xmath3 and @xmath5 ,",
    "our purpose is to find the optimal shift value @xmath17 to minimize @xmath89 .",
    "let @xmath90 and @xmath91 for distribution @xmath30 .",
    "define @xmath92 $ ] and @xmath93 $ ] , then we have @xmath94 .",
    "and we denote @xmath95 and @xmath96 . due to these definitions ,",

    "@xmath114 increases on @xmath121 .",
    "@xmath102 the proof can follow the similar method as @xmath98 trivially .",
    "theorem [ thr-2 ] shows that our approach under k - s distance can also provide a reasonable , possibly unique location difference between two distributions .",
    "in hair study , we need to assess effets of hair care products in changing hair diameters after a period of use . there are two treatments , say @xmath122 and @xmath30 .",
    "the experiments are conducted as follows .",
    "there are 30 subjects and each subject use @xmath122 and @xmath30 on the left and right head , respectively .",
    "there are two study visit , baseline and 8 weeks later . at each study visit ,",
    "hair diameters are measured on several hundred of hairs on left and right head from a subject .",
    "comparison between visits is to compare the distributions of hair diameters at two visit point .",
    "the diameters from one subject often follows non - traditional distributions . for example , a subject at baseline and 8 weeks later hair diameter frequency plot for treatment @xmath122 are shown in figure [ fig1 ] and the distributions are shown in figure [ fig2 ] .",
    "it is of importance to know holistically how much diameters have changed .    for each subject ,",
    "the optimal shift amount of the distributions of hair diameters at the two visit point for each treatment under mallows distance and k - s distance can be obtained .",
    "for instance , the shift plots for @xmath122 and @xmath30 of a subject are displayed in figure [ fig3 ] and shift plots of all subjects for @xmath122 are displayed in figure [ fig4 ] .",
    "the shift corresponding to the minimum distance is the difference between two distributions , for comparison analysis .",
    "shift plot of all subject for @xmath122,width=345 ]    use the optimal values for each subject each treatment as responses and perform wilcoxon signed rank test on differences in shifts between treatments for all subjects to detect a difference between the treatments .",
    "the results are shown in table [ tab-1 ] , from which we concludes that the two treatments are difference at 0.01 level .",

    "in this paper , we demonstrated a significant theorem relating to how to measure two distribution within the probabilistic interpretation under mallows distance or k - s distance , and a well studied simulation on real data had been implemented for an illustration of this method . the solid theoretical foundation would be beneficial to others who would have a further understanding or research on mallows distance measures the discrepancy between two distributions , especially two similar distributions with inner relationship .",
    "besides those distances , there might be possibility to use other divergence measures to be minimized after proper transformations .",
