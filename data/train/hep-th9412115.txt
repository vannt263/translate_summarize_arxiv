    "as well as applications to statistical physics , conformal field theory has proved to be a very powerful tool in string theory . in particular , the ground state of a critical string corresponds to a conformal field theory with a specific central charge .",
    "it is of particular interest to classify all such ground states which can therefore be done by finding the space of all conformal field theories of a given central charge .",
    "this `` moduli space '' forms the space of string vacua and may be considered as the stringy analogue of the space of einstein metrics in general relativity .",
    "the moduli space of conformal field theories thus gives rise to two immediate applications .",
    "firstly one may try to gain an understanding of stringy effects in quantum gravity by comparing the moduli space of conformal field theories with the space of einstein metrics for a given class of backgrounds .",
    "secondly one may assume that space - time is in the form of flat four - dimensional minkowski space times some compact part @xmath7 .",
    "the space of possible @xmath7 s leads to a space of theories of particle physics ( i.e. , particle masses , couplings , etc . ) in four dimensional space time ( see , for example , @xcite ) . in this latter case",
    "@xmath7 has a euclidean signature . because of the difficulty in analyzing conformal field theories associated to a target space with indefinite signature we will need to restrict our attention to the latter scenario .",
    "it should be expected however that many of the features we observe in these lectures should carry over to the former case of stringy quantum gravity of all of space - time .    in section [ s : cft ] we will deal with simple examples of non - supersymmetric conformal field theories and their moduli space to introduce the basic concepts we will require later in these lectures .",
    "the basic example central to a great deal of work in this subject will be that of @xmath8 theories and the linear sigma model whose target space is a circle .",
    "the notion of  duality appears here and will be of some interest later in these lectures .",
    "we will find that extending our ideas to more complicated examples is very difficult to achieve in general . because of this we are forced to impose restrictions on the type of conformal field theories we study .",
    "in particular we want to focus on conformal field theories which are associated to some geometric target space ( or perhaps some slightly generalized notion thereof ) .",
    "we also impose that the conformal field theory has @xmath9=2 supersymmetry .",
    "the effect of this is to force the target space to be a space with a complex structure . in terms of the flat four - dimensional minkowski space point of view",
    "these conditions amount the existence of a space - time supersymmetry . for the purposes of these lectures we may simply regard these conditions as providing us with enough structure to use the tools of algebraic geometry .    in section [ s : torus ] we will study the superconformal field theory for a sigma model with a complex one - torus as the target space .",
    "this will allow us to introduce the complex coordinates which prove to be extremely useful for dealing with later examples .",
    "section [ s : k3 t ] will cover briefly the case of a k3 surface as the target space .",
    "in this case we have @xmath9=4 supersymmetry .",
    "this section will also introduce the concept of a `` blow - up '' which is a key construction in algebraic geometry and thus also appears naturally in the context of superconformal field theories .",
    "this blow - up also appears to be of central importance to understanding some global issues of the moduli space of @xmath9=2 theories and so it will become something of a recurring theme in later sections .    in the sections discussed thus far we will find that using a metric as an effective description of the target space suffices . for the rest of the lectures however we will study examples which require more radical approaches . in particular",
    "we will be required to think in terms of algebraic geometry rather than differential geometry .",
    "for the cases we discuss in the later sections , the moduli spaces factor into two parts @xmath10 ( moduli some discrete symmetries and so long as we are careful about the boundary points ) . in geometric terms @xmath11 corresponds to deformations of the ( complexified ) khler form on @xmath7 and @xmath12 corresponds to deformations of the complex structure of @xmath7 .",
    "the factor @xmath12 turns out to be simple to understand and may be analyzed classically . in order to understand the structure of the moduli space of a particular class of conformal field theories we will have to give three interpretations to each point in @xmath11 :    1 .   the desired interpretation as a theory with some target space @xmath7 with a specific khler form .",
    "this is the most difficult to analyze .",
    "2 .   a theory with some flat target space containing @xmath7 with a specific khler form . in some limit",
    "the fields in this theory are required to live in @xmath7 .",
    "this is the `` linear '' of @xcite .",
    "3 .   a theory with some space @xmath13 , related to @xmath7 by `` mirror symmetry '' , where the point in moduli space specifies a complex structure on @xmath13 .    we will find that the third interpretation in terms of @xmath13 provides the simplest context in which to compute the moduli space but that we require the linear  as an intermediary to translate between interpretations on @xmath7 and @xmath13 for each point in this space .",
    "in section [ s : d=3 ] we will look at the simplest non - trivial example of the above and explicitly compute @xmath11 . in section [ s : phase ]",
    "we will consider the more general case .",
    "finally in section [ s : conc ] we present a few concluding remarks .",
    "we will begin our discussion with the simplest . for further details and references as well as",
    "an excellent introduction to conformal field theory the reader is referred to @xcite . consider a field theory in a two - dimensional space @xmath14 whose action is given by @xmath15 where @xmath16 is real and we are using complex coordinate @xmath17 and its conjugate @xmath18 on the world - sheet , @xmath14 .",
    "classically this action is conformally invariant and under quantization one indeed obtains a conformal field theory with central charge @xmath8 .",
    "that is , the stress tensor @xmath19 which in this case is proportional to the normal ordered product @xmath20 obeys the operator product expansion @xmath21 with @xmath8 . in this way",
    "we say that we have a @xmath8 conformal field theory description of the real line @xmath22 .",
    "a simple generalization of ( [ eq : bsm ] ) is to give the field @xmath16 an index @xmath23 which runs @xmath24 .",
    "that is , the value of @xmath25 lies in @xmath26 .",
    "we may also think of @xmath16 as defining a map @xmath27 .",
    "the stress tensor is now in the form @xmath28 and we obtain ( [ eq : vir ] ) with @xmath29 .",
    "thus , at least in this simple case we see that the central charge is a measure of the dimension of the target space of the .",
    "returning to the case @xmath30 , we may make an alternative simple generalization of our simple model by imposing periodic boundary conditions on @xmath16 .",
    "that is , we consider the target space to be a circle of radius @xmath31 which implies @xmath32 .",
    "actually it is convenient to rescale @xmath16 such that @xmath33 .",
    "then the action is @xmath34 this is a conformal field theory with @xmath8 for any value of @xmath31 agreeing with the idea that a circle is a one - dimensional object irrespective of its size !",
    "we have a family of field theories parametrized by @xmath31 .",
    "the key purpose of these lectures is to discuss such families of conformal field theories .",
    "the moduli space of theories is the space mapped out by the parameters in the theory .",
    "thus the moduli space for theories on a circle appears at first sight to be the real half line @xmath35 mapped out by @xmath36 .",
    "certainly this is the moduli space for circles . in order to be sure that we have the right moduli space",
    "however it is important to ask the following question .",
    "do two distinct points in the supposed moduli space actually correspond to identical conformal field theories ? to answer this question we need to know more about the theory than just the action ( [ eq : bsmr ] ) .",
    "while different values of @xmath31 certainly give different actions it may be the case that when we work out the spectrum of fields and their correlators we end with identical field theories with different values of @xmath31 . thus turns out frequently to be the case as we shall see .",
    "consider the local structure of the moduli space around a point corresponding to the action @xmath37 .",
    "for a field @xmath38 in this theory we may build a new field theory @xmath39 for some small @xmath40 . to maintain conformal invariance",
    "we require that the term added be conformally invariant .",
    "this implies that @xmath41 must be of weight ( dimension ) @xmath42 with respect to @xmath43 and @xmath18 .",
    "such an operator is called `` marginal '' .",
    "it is important to realize that the operator @xmath41 belongs to the field theory given by @xmath37 and not @xmath44 . in order that we may `` transport '' this field to a new one in the new theory which is also marginal we require that @xmath41 should not interact with itself to cause corrections to its own weight @xcite .",
    "such a field is called `` truly marginal '' . such fields naturally span the tangent space to any point in the moduli space .",
    "it turns out that something rather special happens with @xmath45 ( see @xcite for more details ) .",
    "the resultant conformal field theory is completely equivalent to the field theory that corresponds to a string propagating on the group manifold @xmath46 .",
    "this has two striking consequence .",
    "firstly @xmath46 is three - dimensional and @xmath8 thus ruining our initial hope that the central charge might give the dimension of the target space .",
    "secondly , the extra symmetries given by the affine algebra of @xmath46 map @xmath41 to @xmath47 for this theory .",
    "thus decreasing @xmath31 appears to be the same as increasing @xmath31 away from this point in the moduli space .",
    "actually what we see here is the famous  duality symmetry for a string on a circle @xcite .",
    "it turns out that the partition function of the string on a circle of radius @xmath31 is identical to that of a string on a circle of radius @xmath48 .",
    "the reason for this is quite simple to picture .",
    "as in normal quantum mechanics , the momentum for the string going around the circle is quantized just like a `` particle in a box '' .",
    "this leads to `` momentum mode '' eigenstates with energy proportional to @xmath49 for @xmath50 . unlike the quantum theory of a particle we also have `` winding modes '' where the string wraps around the circle .",
    "clearly the string must wind an integer number , @xmath51 , times round the circle forcing these modes to be quantized too .",
    "the energy of these modes goes like @xmath52 .",
    "thus , the  symmetry appears as an exchange in the rles of @xmath53 and @xmath51 , i.e. , an exchange of winding modes with momentum modes .",
    "( note that in order to prove the equivalence of two conformal field theories it is not sufficient just to show that partition functions are identical . in this case",
    "however we know that this duality holds near the point @xmath45 because of the symmetry @xmath54 and we may integrate along this marginal direction to extend the symmetry to a whole @xmath55-symmetry acting on the line of @xmath31 s",
    ". this @xmath55 symmetry must be the  duality since this is the only symmetry of the partition function with a fixed point at @xmath45 . )    at this point our moduli space appears to be the half real line closed at both ends by @xmath56 with the point at infinity corresponding to @xmath22 , i.e. , a circle of infinite radius .",
    "actually this is not the full moduli space of @xmath8 conformal field theories .",
    "we may form orbifolds of theories we already have . to form an orbifold we divide the theory out by a discrete symmetry",
    "this not only projects out the non @xmath57-invariant states from the original theory but also adds in `` twisted '' modes corresponding to open strings in the original theory whose ends are identified under @xmath57 .",
    "the circle generically admits a @xmath55 symmetry by @xmath58 .",
    "this leads to a new line of theories .",
    "we will have more to say about orbifolds later .",
    "one may also divide the @xmath46 group manifold at the @xmath45 point by any discrete subgroup of @xmath46 .",
    "most of these subgroup lead to theories already accounted for but the three exceptional subgroups ( the bitetrahedral , bioctahedral and biicosahedral ) give new points @xcite in the moduli space . whether the full moduli space of unitary conformal field theories with @xmath8 has now been accounted for is still to be proven",
    ". however partial results towards this end have been reached @xcite .",
    "the conjectured moduli space for @xmath8 theories is shown in figure [ fig : c=1 ] .",
    "interesting points have been labeled  the reader is again referred to @xcite for more details .",
    "the two generalizations of the real line we have considered thus far were that of @xmath26 and that of a circle .",
    "the next case is to combine these to get a torus @xmath59 .",
    "this will give us a conformal field theory of central charge @xmath29 .",
    "again , we will not provide any detailed proofs here but only state the results .",
    "narain @xcite has shown that a string on an @xmath51-torus may be specified by a lattice in a @xmath60-dimensional space of indefinite signature @xmath61 .",
    "the generators of the lattice must have inner product in the form of the matrix @xmath62 thus the question of the the moduli space of conformal field theories is reduced to that of finding the moduli space of lattices in the required form .",
    "the group @xmath63 acts on any lattice to preserve ( [ eq : offh ] ) and this may be taken as the initial guess at the moduli space .",
    "we need to identify points in the space @xmath63 corresponding to identical theories which requires us to take a quotient of this group .",
    "firstly we need to divide by @xmath64 .",
    "these rotations may be viewed as rotations of the @xmath51-dimensional lattice defining the torus itself ( or the set of allowed winding modes ) and the rotations of the dual lattice ( giving the set of allowed momentum modes ) .",
    "these rotations have no effect on the underlying field theory .",
    "thus our candidate moduli space becomes the ( right ) coset @xmath65 ( where the group @xmath64 acts on @xmath63 from the right ) .    to complete the picture of the moduli space some more identifications are required .",
    "these come from elements of @xmath63 which act as automorphisms of the lattice .",
    "it is easy to see that such automorphisms must consist of @xmath66 , i.e. , matrices in @xmath63 , preserving ( [ eq : offh ] ) , which have purely integer entries .",
    "assuming we have accounted for all the necessary identifications our moduli space can then be written as @xmath67 where the infinite discrete group @xmath66 acts on @xmath63 from the left .",
    "it is an instructive exercise to interpret this space from the point of view of of the world - sheet action @xcite . in the case of the circle",
    "we could account for the one degree of freedom in the moduli space as corresponding to the radius of the circle .",
    "the natural generalization here would be to put a constant metric @xmath68 on the torus .",
    "thus accounts for @xmath69 dimensions but our moduli space ( [ eq : mod - t ] ) has @xmath70 dimensions . to account for these extra terms",
    "one may add the term @xmath71 to the action , where @xmath72 and @xmath73 indices label coordinates on the world - sheet and @xmath74 is a constant matrix which may be taken to be antisymmetric .",
    "note the factor of @xmath23 in this term  this is because of the transformation properties of @xmath75 under the wick rotation from a minkowski signature world - sheet to the euclidean signature we assume in these lectures .",
    "written in terms of complex coordinates on the world - sheet our action then becomes @xmath76    it turns out that in more general cases it is also natural to include the antisymmetric @xmath77-term degree of freedom in the field theory .    in order to examine more complicated conformal field theory moduli spaces",
    "it will be necessary to impose further structure .",
    "the structure we will impose shall be supersymmetry .",
    "thus , from this point on , all conformal field theories considered will be superconformal field theories .",
    "the  with target space given by a circle can be extended in a straight - forward manner to a superconformal field theory .",
    "to do so we add one free left - moving and one free right - moving majorana - weyl fermion to our action .",
    "such a free fermion is well - known to correspond to the ising model and contributes @xmath78 to the central charge .",
    "our resulting theory will therefore have @xmath79 .",
    "the moduli space of this theory is at first sight little more complicated than the non - supersymmetric case .",
    "the only marginal operator in a generic theory is the one that we already had acting to change the radius of the circle . this should not be surprising since there are no deformations of the free fermion part of the theory .",
    "the moduli space for these @xmath79 theories contains figure [ fig : c=1 ] but it actually has more branches .",
    "the reader is referred to @xcite where this calculation was first performed for more details .",
    "the extra branches in the moduli space arise because one may put different boundary conditions on the fermions .",
    "this moduli space of superconformal field theories with @xmath79 is certainly simpler than the space of all conformal field theories with @xmath79 so adding supersymmetry has simplified the problem .",
    "unfortunately this simplification is still not sufficient to study the moduli spaces of non - trivial examples .",
    "the main topic of these lectures will be conformal field theories with @xmath80 world - sheet supersymmetry .",
    "we insist on @xmath9=2 superconformal invariance in the both sectors and so such theories are often referred to as @xmath9=(2,2 ) superconformal field theories .",
    "it is this extended supersymmetry structure which allows for a dramatic simplification of the problem .",
    "the fundamental reason for this is that in this case one works exclusively with objects taking values in the complex numbers @xmath81 rather than @xmath22 .",
    "holomorphicity then allows many problems to be solved .",
    "to begin our discussion of @xmath9=2 theories let us try to build the simplest theory with a non - trivial moduli space in analogy with the @xmath8 theories and the @xmath82 theories above . adding a second free moving fermion to each sector forces us to add another free boson to complete the @xmath80 supermultiplet .",
    "it appears that our simplest model will have @xmath83 .",
    "actually the moduli space of such theories turns out to be very messy .",
    "extra branches like those that appeared in the @xmath79 theories of @xcite proliferate in this case . to bring this situation under control",
    "let us impose a further condition on our theories .",
    "each field in our @xmath9=2 superconformal field theory has charges @xmath84 under the left - moving and right - moving @xmath3 currents implicit in the @xmath9=2 algebra .",
    "we will insist that all ns fields in our theory will have @xmath85 .",
    "such a constraint appears naturally in string theory  it is required for `` spectral flow '' to be a symmetry for fields appearing in the partition function .",
    "the reader is referred to @xcite for more details .",
    "let us compute the complete moduli space for such conformal field theories with @xmath83 .",
    "the following argument was first presented in @xcite and we present here only an outline . for the time being we will assume @xmath86 but this will change later . using the usual notation @xmath19 , @xmath87 and @xmath88 for the fields generating the @xmath9=2 algebra in the left sector",
    ", we have @xmath89 this implies there exists some free boson @xmath41 such that @xmath90 furthermore , we can define fields , @xmath91 , which are neutral under this @xmath3 current : @xmath92 it follows that @xmath93 this in turn implies the existence of a complex free boson @xmath94 such that @xmath95    the free boson @xmath41 by itself forms a @xmath8 conformal field theory as we described earlier . precisely which conformal field it corresponds to is given by the periodicity of the field @xmath41 ",
    "i.e. , the radius of the circle on which @xmath41 lives",
    ". this is fixed by our quantization condition on the fields in our theory .",
    "a field of charge @xmath96 will contain a @xmath97 factor .",
    "the existence of charge one fields implies that the radius is 1 . from figure",
    "[ fig : c=1 ] we see that this corresponds to a dirac fermion .",
    "that is , we have two fermions with matching boundary conditions .",
    "call this a complex fermion @xmath98 .",
    "we then have that @xmath99    all our degrees of freedom in the moduli space appear to be encapsulated in the field @xmath94 . the first possibility to consider",
    "is that this corresponds to some two - dimensional torus .",
    "the moduli space of such @xmath100 conformal field theories was studied in @xcite .",
    "actually we already know from we what have said that it should be @xmath101 neglecting factors of @xmath55 , one knows that @xmath102 ^ 2.\\ ] ] we may map @xmath103 into the upper half complex plane by @xmath104 thus , modulo issues of discrete group actions our moduli space is two copies of the upper - half complex plane .",
    "this space is referred to as the `` teichmller space '' .",
    "the actual moduli space is the teichmller space divided by some discrete group action .",
    "the group @xmath105 contains @xmath106 .",
    "these @xmath107 groups act on the two upper half planes by @xmath108 thus in our moduli space each upper half plane is divided by this modular group . to picture the moduli space we should therefore consider one fundamental domain for this group for each upper - half plane .    in our haste in building the moduli space",
    "thus far we have neglected a few @xmath55 factors .",
    "the correct inclusion of these divides the space by two further @xmath55-actions ( see @xcite for this calculation ) .",
    "let us label the two half planes by @xmath109 . as well as the modular group action ( [ eq : modgroup ] ) on each of these parameters we also have @xmath110 the resulting moduli space is shown in figure [ fig : mod - t ] .",
    "when the moduli space of @xmath100 theories was investigated in @xcite it was noted that figure [ fig : mod - t ] was not the complete moduli space . in general",
    "one could take orbifolds of the 2-torus to obtain other conformal field theories with @xmath100 . in the context of our @xmath83 superconformal field theory",
    "any action of a group on this torus which is not simply a translation would act non - trivially on @xmath87 .",
    "thus dividing by such a group would ruin the @xmath9=2 superconformal invariance .",
    "one concludes therefore that the moduli space as shown in figure [ fig : mod - t ] includes all valid @xmath111 superconformal field theories .",
    "it will prove extremely useful to analyze figure [ fig : mod - t ] from the point of view of complex geometry .",
    "let us first note that a 2-torus is a complex manifold of one dimension .",
    "now rewrite the action ( [ eq : torsm ] ) in terms of complex coordinates @xmath25 on the target space : @xmath112    in terms of the action ( [ eq : sm ] ) we appear to have the following degrees of freedom : complex structure on @xmath7 and a choice of @xmath113 and @xmath114 .",
    "can we interpret the moduli space of figure [ fig : mod - t ] in terms of these ?",
    "the complex structure part is easy .",
    "it is well - known that the moduli space of a torus is given by the upper half plane divided by @xmath107 .",
    "we may thus take @xmath115 to represent the complex structure in the usual way , i.e. , the complex structure is that of a torus constructed from the complex plane by dividing by the translations given by 1 and @xmath115 where @xmath116 .    it may be shown @xcite that the complex parameter @xmath117 may be built from the remaining degrees of freedom : @xmath118 the real numbers @xmath119 and @xmath120 describe the degrees of freedom of the metric and the @xmath77-term as follows . introduce a constant 2-form @xmath121 such that @xmath122 .",
    "thus @xmath121 generates @xmath123 .",
    "now write @xmath124 where @xmath125 from now on , to avoid cumbersome factors , let us set units so that @xmath126 .",
    "the element in @xmath107 which takes @xmath127 is easy to explain as follows .",
    "we may rewrite the action ( [ eq : sm ] ) as @xmath128 where @xmath129 does not depend on @xmath77 and @xmath130 denotes the pull - back of the two - form , @xmath77 , from @xmath7 to the world - sheet @xmath14 via the map @xmath131 .",
    "first note that this term depending on @xmath77 is `` topological ''  it depends only on the cohomology class of @xmath77 .",
    "thus deformations of @xmath77 do not affect @xmath44 .",
    "this means that the equations of motion do not depend on @xmath77 . at the quantum level",
    "@xmath77 is important but correlation functions can only `` see '' @xmath77 via the expression @xmath132 in the path integral .",
    "thus , if we shift @xmath77 by an element of @xmath123 then @xmath44 shifts by @xmath133 for @xmath134 and thus the correlation functions are invariant .",
    "this will be a general symmetry of any theory based on the action ( [ eq : sm ] ) . in the case of the torus it corresponds to @xmath127 .",
    "the other generator of @xmath107 not yet accounted for takes @xmath135 .",
    "if we take @xmath77 to be zero , this amounts to inverting @xmath120 .",
    "since @xmath120 corresponds to the area of the torus , this action amounts to the  duality acting on the torus .",
    "the @xmath55-action @xmath136 also has a straight - forward explanation",
    ". one can show that it amounts to taking the complex conjugate of the field theory . in target space terms",
    "this amounts to taking the conjugate complex structure on the target space and changing the sign of @xmath77 .",
    "the last symmetry , generated by @xmath137 , has no classical explanation .",
    "it is `` mirror symmetry '' ( see @xcite for an account of the evolution of this phenomenon ) .",
    "for some points in this moduli space we may also view this as coming from  duality .",
    "this occurs as follows .",
    "let the torus be generated by dividing the complex plane by translations by @xmath138 and @xmath139 in orthogonal directions and let @xmath77 be zero .",
    "this gives @xmath140 the  duality acting on @xmath141 gives the mirror map @xmath137 .",
    "it is important to realize however that this is a very special case we will not expect there to be any relationship between mirror symmetry and  dualities in general .",
    "note that prior knowledge of the existence of mirror symmetry would have been a powerful tool in building this moduli space .",
    "having built the teichmller space we could have generated the whole modular group from the following :    1 .",
    "the modular group for the classical moduli space of complex structures , i.e. , @xmath107 .",
    "2 .   the @xmath55 generated by the mirror map .",
    "3 .   the @xmath55 generated by complex conjugation plus change in sign of @xmath77 .    now let us discuss some of the philosophy behind this latter approach to building the modular group and thus moduli space and contrast it to the method that we used formerly in this section .",
    "the first thing to note is that this latter approach differs markedly from the approach one might consider more natural in physics . as physicists we are used to analyzing space - time in terms of a riemannian metric .",
    "thus when a theory is presented in the form ( [ eq : sm ] ) and one is asked the question `` what is the moduli space for such theories ? '' , one s first reaction will be to find the moduli space of allowed metrics @xmath113 . in the cases",
    "presented thus far in these lectures , the metric is constant and the theory can be solved . indeed",
    "this is the method by which we effectively found the moduli space .",
    "as we shall see , when the metric is not so trivial , life becomes considerably more difficult .",
    "the stunning feature of the program for building the moduli space using mirror symmetry as outlined in the three steps above is that nowhere did we mention the metric ! one might at first think that the complex structure encodes at least part of the metric data since one may think of it as being used to go from the real metric to the hermitian metric used in ( [ eq : sm ] ) . actually this need not be the case as we now explain .    the branch of geometry usually used by physicists is differential geometry .",
    "this is implicit when one uses riemannian geometry .",
    "given a manifold @xmath7 , one looks very closely at a very small part of it and assumes it looks roughly like flat space . by",

    "one need never mention the metric when studying algebraic geometry .",
    "indeed , one need not insist that the space in question is a manifold and thus it may be difficult to define a metric on our space anyway . the important point to notice",
    "is that the moduli space of complex structures of a space may be determined using the methods of algebraic geometry .",
    "the situation in @xmath9=2 theories is actually twice as algebraic as classical geometry thanks to mirror symmetry . in most cases ( but",
    "not always as we see in section [ s : k3 t ] ) the moduli space roughly factorizes into two parts .",
    "one part describes the complex structure and the other half gives the khler form ( i.e. , hermitian metric ) and @xmath77 .",
    "classically the first half can be determined by algebraic geometry whereas the second half is not such a naturally algebraic object . in string theory",
    "the mirror map relates the second half to a complex structure calculation allowing both halves to be calculated using algebraic geometry ! certainly within the context of @xmath9=2 theories",
    "it would seem unfortunate that physicists have grown to be biased in favour of differential rather than algebraic geometry for analyzing problems .",
    "in fact it is the case that not only is algebraic geometry the more convenient setting for analyzing such string theories but that differential geometry can lead to incorrect conclusions as we shall see later .",
    "this should not really be a surprise .",

    "let us now reanalyze the moduli space of the torus from an algebraic point of view .",
    "this may appear to be unnecessarily cumbersome compared to the analytical approach used earlier in this section .",

    "let us consider a target space that is not flat",
    ". that is , we allow @xmath113 and @xmath114 in ( [ eq : sm ] ) to vary over @xmath7 .",
    "it is not possible , in general , to solve this model exactly .",

    "one might also hope that any such model is equivalent to some  model ( if the class of  spaces is generalized in some way ) .",
    "therefore , for the purposes of these lectures , if an @xmath9=2 theory has any large radius interpretation then it must be a  space .",
    "the constraint of ricci - flatness is actually topological in nature . the first chern class of the tangent bundle on a manifold , which is an element of @xmath123 , is defined in terms of the ricci curvature and so must be trivial for a space . in these lectures we will denote this condition by @xmath214 .",
    "denotes the canonical divisor .",
    "this divisor is associated to the first chern class of the canonical bundle which is turn is equal to the first chern class of the cotangent bundle . ] actually , due to a theorem of yau @xcite , this argument works in reverse .",
    "that is , given a manifold with @xmath214 one may prove the existence of a ricci - flat khler metric . to be more specific ,",
    "given a  manifold ( with a given complex structure ) and a suitable cohomology class in @xmath215 there is a _",

    "2 .   the cohomology class of the khler form , @xmath211 .",
    "3 .   the cohomology class of @xmath77 modulo @xmath123 .    let us use @xmath2 to denote the complex dimension of the target space .",

    "there are two possibilities .",
    "firstly there is the two complex dimensional torus  again a flat space .",
    "secondly one might have a `` k3 surface '' . before moving on to @xmath217",
    "we will briefly analyze some aspects of this k3 case . although this is not entirely relevant for the case @xmath217 it will allow us to introduce  orbifolds which will be of some importance later on .    in the case",
    "@xmath4 we found that the superconformal algebra provided a very restricting set of conditions for the theory .",
    "it was this that forced the target space to be a torus .",
    "for @xmath218 we lose some of the power of this method but for @xmath216 one may still impose certain restrictions . in this case",
    "we can define the boson @xmath219 by @xmath220 we also have the fields @xmath221 which are present in any non - trivial theory with ns fields with integer @xmath3 charges .",
    "the fields @xmath222 together form an @xmath46 affine algebra @xcite .",
    "thus the @xmath3 of the @xmath9=2 superconformal algebra has been elevated to @xmath46 .",
    "in fact , the two fields @xmath87 may be split up into 4 fields transforming as a @xmath223 representation of @xmath46 . in this way",
    ", the algebra is extended to an @xmath9=4 superconformal algebra .",
    "that is to say , in the case @xmath216 , any @xmath9=2 superconformal field theory with ns fields with integer @xmath3 charges is automatically an @xmath9=4 superconformal field theory .",
    "this @xmath9=4 supersymmetry has a striking effect on the perturbation theory for the non - linear .",
    "one may show @xcite that there are no corrections to ( [ eq : cy ] ) at any loop order , nor indeed any nonperturbative corrections .",
    "one may also show that the target space has a quaternionic structure as well as a complex structure .",
    "now let us turn our attention to k3 itself .",
    "what exactly is a k3 surface ?",
    "one way of building one is in the form of an orbifold .",
    "consider the two complex dimensional torus constructed by taking a quotient of @xmath224 , with coordinates @xmath225 , by the translations @xmath226 .",
    "in other words we take the product of two tori with @xmath227 as defined in the last section . the group @xmath55 generated by @xmath228 fixes the 16 points @xmath229 .",
    "this means that when we build the space that is the quotient of the complex two - torus by this @xmath55 we will have a space with 16 singularities .",
    "each of the 16 singularities looks locally like @xmath230 where the @xmath55 in the denominator is generated by @xmath231 .",
    "this latter space has an isolated singularity at the origin .",
    "a space with quotient singularities is known as an orbifold . because such spaces are not manifolds , nave application of differential geometry would be inappropriate .",
    "they are simple to deal with in terms of algebraic geometry however . to see how such objects appear in our moduli spaces we need to introduce the concept of a `` blow - up '' .",
    "to begin with let us define the space @xmath232,(x , y)\\in\\p^1\\times \\c^2;\\,ay = bx\\}.\\ ] ] clearly this is a two - dimensional space ( there is one constraint in a three dimensional space ) .",
    "if @xmath233 then @xmath234 is determined and we fix a point on @xmath235 .",
    "thus , away from the origin of @xmath224 there is a one - to - one map between @xmath224 and @xmath236 . at the origin of @xmath224",
    "there is no constraint on @xmath237 $ ] so we recover the whole @xmath235 .",
    "thus @xmath236 looks like @xmath224 with the origin removed and replaced by @xmath235 .",
    "one may also check that @xmath236 is smooth from ( [ eq : smooth ] ) .",
    "the space @xmath236 is said to be obtained from @xmath224 by `` blowing - up '' the origin . given a space ,",
    "one may produce an infinite set of spaces by blowing - up smooth points .",
    "this might at first appear an alarming prospect from the point of view of trying to classify  spaces but it turns out that if we take a  space and blow - up a smooth point then the resulting space has @xmath238 .",
    "that is , the resulting space will not be  ( although it is still khler ) .",
    "the usefulness of the blowing - up construction in the context of  spaces stems from what happens when we try to blow - up singular points as we now see .",
    "let us return the the space @xmath230 .",
    "let us define @xmath239 clearly @xmath240 are invariant under the @xmath55 action .",
    "we also have @xmath241 .",
    "in fact this defines a one - to - one map between the space @xmath230 and the hypersurface @xmath241 in @xmath174 .",
    "the latter forms the description of the quotient singularity in algebraic geometry .",
    "let us pretend that @xmath242 $ ] are the homogeneous coordinates of @xmath142 rather than the affine coordinates of @xmath174 .",
    "in this case @xmath241 defines a smooth @xmath243 .",
    "putting coordinates @xmath237 $ ] on this @xmath235 we may map it into @xmath142 via @xmath244 .",
    "the definition of @xmath236 amounted to taking the subspace of @xmath245 where the affine coordinates on @xmath224 represented the homogeneous coordinates on @xmath235 .",
    "let us now play the same game with our subspace of @xmath174 .",
    "that is we consider @xmath246,(x , y , z)\\in \\p^1\\times\\c^3;\\,xy = z^2,a^2z = abx , a^2y = b^2x , aby = b^2z\\}.\\ ] ] now , with reasoning similar to before , away from @xmath247 the space looks like @xmath230 whereas at @xmath247 we have a @xmath235 .",
    "that is , we have replaced the singular point of @xmath230 by a @xmath235 and in the process we have ended up with a smooth space",
    "! actually the above form of this space can be simplified .",
    "the constraints are sufficient to uniquely determine @xmath43 from the other variables .",

    "the condition @xmath214 is only met by @xmath249 when @xmath250 .",
    "thus , it is only when blowing up with @xmath251 that we can hope to obtain a  space in two dimensions .",
    "note that blowing - up changes the topology .",
    "in particular , introducing the new @xmath235 adds an element to @xmath252 .",
    "this new element is called an `` exceptional divisor '' .",
    "the term `` divisor '' means , for our purposes , any linear combination of complex codimension one objects in our algebraic variety .",
    "`` exceptional '' refers to the fact that it came from a blow - up .",
    "we may take our space obtained by dividing the complex 2-torus by @xmath55 and obtain a smooth space by blowing up all 16 fixed points .",
    "the hodge numbers @xmath253 can be calculated by starting with the cohomology of the complex 2-torus , projecting out those elements which are not invariant under the @xmath55 action and then adding in the elements from the exceptional divisors of the blow - up .",
    "this is captured by the following hodge diamonds :    @xmath254 the diamond on the left is that of the complex 2-torus and on the right that of the desired space . the smooth  surface is an example of a k3 surface .",
    "any smooth complex surface which is  and is not a torus will be diffeomorphic to a k3 surface ( see for example @xcite ) .",
    "one may divide complex 2-tori by many discrete groups .",
    "so long as this discrete group is a subgroup of @xmath46 one may blow - up the resulting space and , if there were any fixed points , one will find the same hodge diamond as above .",
    "blow - ups of complicated quotient singularities are performed by a sequence of adding @xmath251 spaces @xcite .",
    "let us now consider the khler form on @xmath7 , when @xmath7 is a k3 surface .",
    "then since @xmath255 , the cohomology class of the khler form lives in the vector space @xmath256 .",
    "there is a natural linear mapping between @xmath42-forms and divisors .",
    "this mapping is `` the dual of the dual '' in the following sense .",
    "we take a @xmath42-form @xmath257 and find the dual form @xmath258 such that @xmath259 .",
    "@xmath260 is then taken to be the dual of @xmath261 in the sense that @xmath262 .",
    "let us choose a basis @xmath257 , @xmath263 .",
    "one choice could be to take @xmath264 forming a basis of the @xmath42-forms of the original two - torus and have @xmath265 associated to the 16 exceptional divisors .",
    "we then write @xmath266 using standard khler geometry ( see , for example , @xcite ) one may calculate the area of a curve , @xmath198 , given its homology class , i.e. , area @xmath267 . to calculate this",
    "we need to know the intersection form @xmath268 .",
    "our association between @xmath257 and @xmath260 allows us to rephrase questions in terms of intersection numbers since @xmath269 .",
    "let us consider the intersection numbers of an exceptional divisor , say , @xmath270 , with the other generators .",
    "each exceptional divisor comes from a different fixed point and so need not touch the others .",
    "also a generator of @xmath271 on the original complex two - torus may defined such that it does not pass through the fixed points .",
    "thus @xmath272 for @xmath273 .",
    "what about @xmath274 ?",
    "consider the rational curve , @xmath198 , in @xmath249 defined as the base space while considering @xmath249 as a line bundle .",
    "this bundle may be considered as the normal bundle of the embedding of this rational curve in the space @xmath249 .",
    "deformations of the curve may then be given by holomorphic sections of this normal bundle .",
    "if @xmath275 there are non - zero sections of the bundle with generically @xmath51 zeroes . in this manner , we see that @xmath198 has self - intersection @xmath51 . in our case",
    "@xmath250 and there are no deformations of the rational curve .",
    "however one may assume that the above reasoning extends for @xmath276 and we declare that @xmath277 .",
    "we therefore obtain @xmath278    since it is a reasonable assertion that the area of this curve should be positive , we should therefore impose that @xmath279 .",
    "when one computes all the areas and volumes of all algebraic subspaces of @xmath7 as well as the volume of @xmath7 itself , this positivity condition marks out a region of @xmath256 where the khler is allowed to have values .",
    "the shape marked out is a cone  if @xmath211 is a valid khler form then so is @xmath280 for @xmath281 a positive real number .",
    "this subspace of @xmath256 is called the `` khler cone '' .",
    "note that when we take the limit @xmath282 , the area of the exceptional divisor shrinks down to zero .",
    "this is precisely the reverse of blowing - up . by sending @xmath283 for @xmath284",
    "we can thus recover the orbifold of the complex 2-torus . in this sense , the orbifold `` lives '' in the boundary of the khler cone .",
    "this is shown in figure [ fig : kc ] .",
    "it is worth mentioning that one may analyze the orbifold directly in string theory without having to resolve the singularities @xcite . to study the orbifold in @xmath285 , where @xmath286 is a smooth space and @xmath57 is a discrete group acting with fixed points ,",
    "one considers string theory on @xmath286 . as well as",
    "closed strings on @xmath286 one should also consider strings which are open but whose ends are identified under the action of @xmath57 since such strings will be closed on the orbifold .",
    "these are called `` twisted '' strings .",
    "one then projects on to all @xmath57-invariant states .",
    "this procedure allows one to deduce the string spectrum , and hence euler characteristic , of the orbifold @xcite . applying such a method for our two - torus divided by @xmath55 we obtain an euler characteristic of 24 in agreement with the cohomology of k3 .",
    "this calculation is actually more surprising than first meets the eye .",
    "the orbifold itself , despite being singular may still be triangulated and thus singular homology may be defined on it .",
    "the orbifold is a simplicial complex obtained from the two - torus by removing 16 points , dividing by a freely acting @xmath55 and adding back the 16 points .",
    "the euler characteristic is thus 8 .",
    "thus string theory somehow knew that when it was on the orbifold that the associated geometry was that of a ( blown - down ) k3 surface rather than the obvious simplicial complex for purposes of cohomology .",
    "this is another reason to believe that algebraic geometry is the best setting for understanding the geometry of string theory  blowing up the orbifold to form k3 is a very natural process in algebraic geometry .",
    "while the correct geometrical picture is now well - understood for simple cases ( see , for example @xcite ) addition of so - called `` discrete torsion '' into the orbifolding process can introduce many curiosities @xcite .",
    "now let us discuss the deformations of complex structure .",
    "deformations of a complex manifold are given by elements of @xmath287 , i.e. , one - forms with values in the holomorphic tangent bundle .",
    "if @xmath7 is a  manifold of @xmath2 dimensions , there is a unique @xmath288-form ( up to rescaling ) which may be used to form an isomorphism between @xmath287 and @xmath289 .",
    "see @xcite for a fuller explanation .",
    "it is known @xcite that all elements of this cohomology group give deformations assuming @xmath7 is smooth .",
    "thus the dimension of the moduli space of complex structures is given by the hodge number @xmath290 which in this case is 20 .",
    "it is actually rather tricky to explicitly show all 20 deformations in one model .",
    "let us build k3 as an algebraic variety as we did for the elliptic curve .",
    "we know that any surface we can build that is simply connected will be a k3 surface .",
    "one can show that the hypersurface in @xmath291 defined by an equation of total degree 4 in the homogeneous coordinates @xmath292 $ ] has the required properties ( see chapter 2 of @xcite for a thorough account of such constructions ) .",
    "it is not too difficult to show that writing down the most general quartic defining equation and accounting for linear redefinitions of the coordinates leads to 19 deformations of the defining equation .",
    "thus we appear to `` miss '' one of the the deformations when we analyze the k3 surface in this way .",
    "the reason for this is not too difficult to see .",
    "it comes from the fact that the deformations of complex structure and those of the khler form tend to `` interfere '' with each .",
    "suppose we have an algebraic curve @xmath198 embedded in our k3 surface .",
    "to such a curve we associate a two - form @xmath293 by the linear map discussed earlier .",
    "this two - form will be a ( 1,1)-form by standard results in complex geometry @xcite .",
    "since @xmath198 is an element of @xmath294 , @xmath293 will also be an element of @xmath123 . as we vary the complex structure of @xmath7 , the way that the lattice @xmath123 sits within the hodge decomposition @xmath295 will vary .",
    "thus , the very existence of such a curve @xmath198 will put constraints on the complex structure .",
    "our k3 surface does indeed have such a curve  if we define @xmath296 by the vanishing of a generic equation linear in the homogeneous coordinates , then the intersection of this `` hyperplane '' @xmath142 with the quartic hypersurface will be an algebraic curve ( of genus 3 ) .",
    "the fact that there is only class of such curves puts one constraint on the complex structure and lowers the dimension of the moduli space from 20 to 19 .",
    "in fact the general rule is that if we have @xmath51 algebraic curves in the variety generating @xmath51 dimensions of the khler cone , we only have @xmath297 deformations of complex structure .",
    "thus it is hopeless to try to capture the whole moduli space this way .",
    "the actual analysis of the moduli space of k3 surfaces using mirror symmetry is very interesting but we will not pursue it much further here since it is of little relevance to the rest of these lectures .",
    "the reader is referred to @xcite for further details .",
    "what we will present here is the final answer .",
    "it turns out the the moduli space fails completely to factorize into complex structure times khler parts .",
    "the form of the space turns out to be remarkably similar to that of the torus : @xmath298 where the indefinite metric being preserved is of the form @xmath299 , where @xmath300 is the definite even self dual lattice in 8 dimensions and @xmath94 is the 2-dimensional matrix @xmath301 for @xmath302 and @xmath303 for @xmath304 . from narain",
    "s work @xcite this is precisely the moduli space for string on a left - right unsymmetric torus of dimension ( 4,20 ) . why this should be the case is as yet only partially understood @xcite .",
    "note that the moduli space is again of the form of some smooth teichmller space divided out by some modular group .",
    "note also that this moduli space includes orbifolds such as our complex two - torus divided by @xmath55 .",
    "it should be the case ( but this has not yet been checked ) that the modular group should identify at least some of the orbifolds with classically smooth models as predicted in @xcite .",
    "now let us progress on to the case @xmath217 . recall that for @xmath4 there was only one  manifold  the torus . for @xmath216",
    "we add two possibilities .",
    "how many spaces are there for @xmath217 ? despite considerable effort by mathematicians in recent years , at this point in time it is not known if the number is finite or even if there are any bounds on the euler characteristic !",
    "there are certainly many methods of building  manifolds and all constructions which magically produced a k3 surface ( or occasionally a complex two - torus ) for @xmath216 tend to produce something different in each case when applied to @xmath217 .",
    "there are some constructions which can systematically produce a very large number of  manifolds .",
    "perhaps the most general construction studied so far is that of complete intersections in toric varieties @xcite .",
    "there are known  manifolds which can not be built this way however @xcite .",
    "see @xcite for an introduction to a few of these techniques .",
    "there are some simple statements that can be made .",
    "firstly all spaces with @xmath305 are the complex 3-torus or a k3 surface times a one - torus or some orbifold thereof @xcite .",
    "we will ignore such possibilities here although it should not be difficult using the results of the preceding sections to analyze the moduli spaces completely for these examples .",
    "making the assumption @xmath306 removes some of the complications that occured in the previous section .",
    "the effect of the complex structure on the hodge decomposition @xmath307 will now be trivial since @xmath308 .",
    "this allows us to factorize ( at least locally away from the boundary ) the moduli space into deformations of complex structure and deformations of the khler form .",
    "unfortunately we pay dearly for this simplification .",
    "it was the @xmath309 property of the k3 surface that allowed us to build the @xmath9=4 superconformal algebra that in turn controlled the perturbation theory for the non - linear .",
    "surprisingly one receives no correction to the @xmath73 function for the metric at two and three loop with only @xmath9=2 supersymmetry but at four loops we obtain an extra correction @xcite for the metric : @xmath310+\\ldots      \\label{eq:4lb}\\ ] ] thus we no longer have a ricci - flat metric as a solution .",
    "actually this does nt really matter since we never actually found the metric in the last section , we just needed yau s theorem .",
    "we now need some modified version of the theorem to say that given @xmath7 with a complex structure and a point in the khler cone of @xmath7 , there will be a unique solution of ( [ eq:4 lb ] ) ( at least in some large radius limit ) such that the khler form is of the desired cohomology class .",
    "we will assume that this is the case for convenience of argument .",
    "ultimately we do not really care about the metric and this point will be irrelevant .",
    "more worryingly , we now have instanton effects which are non - trivial .",
    "as we shall see this will cause severe problems with a metric - based point of view but fortunately we have the algebrao - geometric methods of section [ s : torus ] to rescue us .",
    "the two factors of the moduli space are best viewed using topological field theory .",
    "we refer to m. bershadsky s lectures in this volume for more details regarding the following summary .",
    "the main point is that a topological field theory has only a few observables and correlation functions which are fairly simple to calculate ( at least compared to non - topological field theories ) .",
    "we can `` twist '' an @xmath9=2 superconformal field theory in two different ways to obtain two distinct topological field theories .",
    "this is achieved via the transformation @xmath311 these two different twistings give rise to the `` a - model '' and the `` b - model '' as defined in @xcite .",
    "only the ( anti)chiral superfields of the @xmath9=2 theory appear in the a and b models .",
    "in particular , only the ( c , c ) and ( a , a ) fields appear in one and the ( c , a ) and ( a , c ) fields appear in the other ( again see @xcite for an explanation of this notation ) .",
    "when analyzed in terms of a non - linear the correlation functions of the fields in the a - model depend only upon the khler form and @xmath77-term of @xmath7 and the correlation functions of the b - model depend only upon the complex structure @xcite .",
    "thus our factors of the moduli space of @xmath9=2 theories coincide with the moduli spaces of the topological field theories obtained by twisting .",
    "thus , although considerable information is lost when one twists an @xmath9=2 theory into a topological field theory , so long as we consider both twists , we do not lose any information about the structure of the moduli space .",
    "let us briefly review each moduli space .",
    "the moduli space of the a - model @xmath312 encodes information concerning the khler form and @xmath77-term of @xmath7 .",
    "this occurs because of instantons .",
    "a solution to the equations of motion of the a - model is a holomorphic map from the world - sheet , @xmath14 , to @xmath7 .",
    "the constant map mapping @xmath14 to a point in @xmath7 is the trivial case .",
    "any other solution is an instanton . if this map is one - to - one then the image of @xmath14 in @xmath7 is an algebraic curve . in the case",
    "@xmath217 it turns out that three - point functions between interesting observables are only non - zero when the world - sheet is genus zero .",
    "the curves in question are therefore rational .",
    "the remaining instantons unaccounted for are the non - trivial many - to - one maps .",
    "these are multiple covers of rational curves ( for which the interested reader is referred to @xcite ) .    in the case",
    "that an instanton corresponds to a rational curve , @xmath198 , in @xmath7 , the value of the action is @xmath313 .",
    "let us chose a basis , @xmath314 , for @xmath123 .",
    "using our assumption that @xmath306 we may then make the following definitions @xmath315 it then follows that any correlation function will be a power series in the variables @xmath316 .",
    "note that we can now make more precise our rather vague notion of `` large radius limit '' for the non - linear . as each component of the khler form , @xmath317 , tends to infinity",
    ", we see that @xmath318 .",
    "thus any power series is more likely to converge .",
    "we will define the large radius limit to be the limit in which @xmath319 for all @xmath189 .",
    "thus , not only does @xmath7 become a space of infinite volume but each algebraic subspace will also become infinitely large",
    ". we will consider this large radius limit @xmath320 to be a point in the moduli space .",
    "with this definition we may hope that the correlation functions of the a - model will converge in some non - zero region around this large radius limit point .",
    "the b - model and its moduli space @xmath321 are in many ways much simpler .",
    "the only solution to the equations of motion in this case are the constant maps .",
    "therefore we are free from instantons .",
    "this makes the non - linear  very simple to analyze for information concerning observables which appear in the b - model .",
    "essentially the three - point functions calculated at tree - level in the large radius limit will be exact .",
    "actually this fact should have been clear once we noted the factorization of the moduli space into @xmath322 .",
    "if the correlation functions of the b - model depend only on our position with @xmath321 , we can go as close to the large radius limit in @xmath312 as we please thus taking the classical limit .",
    "this has a profound consequence :    @xmath323    thus the fact that the left - hand side of figure [ fig : mod - t ] is the moduli space of complex structures for an elliptic curve was not an artifact of the simplicity of this model .",
    "this kind of behaviour persists in higher dimensions .    in the case of the complex",
    "one torus we just had to copy @xmath321 to obtain @xmath312 .",
    "in general this situation is not quite so straight - forward .",
    "let us consider a non - linear  with target space @xmath7 .",
    "we may then associate to this a conformal field theory and thus a moduli space if @xmath7 is a  space .",
    "it may ( or may not ) be the case that there is another  space @xmath13 which yields exactly the same conformal field theory as that given by @xmath7 except that we exchange chiral rings ( c , c)@xmath324(a , c ) and ( c , a)@xmath324(a , a ) . in this case @xmath13 is the `` mirror '' of @xmath7 ( again the reader is referred to @xcite . )",
    "if this is the case then clearly @xmath325 and @xmath326 .",
    "for the cases @xmath327 the condition of being a  is so constraining that @xmath7 and @xmath13 are topologically the same . thus the mirror map appears as an automorphism on the moduli space .",
    "for @xmath5 it is usually the case that @xmath7 and @xmath13 are topologically distinct ( or even that @xmath13 does not exists as  manifold ) .",
    "assuming @xmath13 exists and we can identify it , we may thus calculate the moduli space of @xmath9=2 theories associated to @xmath7 by two complex structure moduli space calculations  one for @xmath12 and one for @xmath325 .",
    "the moduli space is then generically @xmath328 where the final @xmath55 quotient corresponds to complex conjugation of @xmath7 and changing the sign of @xmath77 .",
    "before we proceed further to look at a simple example , we first introduce another field theory associated to the target space @xmath7 .",
    "the reason for this short diversion should become clear soon .",
    "this will be witten s linear .",
    "we refer the reader to the original paper @xcite for more details concerning the remainder of this subsection ( see also j. distler s lectures in this volume ) .",
    "the basic idea is that although the conformally invariant  for @xmath7 is very complicated we may consider a much simpler  with a larger target space containing @xmath7 such that the fields are constrained to live in @xmath7 in some limit .",
    "the latter  ( which we will refer to as the _ linear _ ) shares many properties of the nonlinear  which has @xmath7 as the genuine target space .    before writing down this linear  we need to specify our conventions for superspace . to fit in with our earlier description of the @xmath9=2 superalgebra we denote by @xmath329 our coordinates for the left sector and @xmath330 for the right sector .",
    "let us introduce a set of charged ( c , c ) superfields @xmath331 and a set of neutral ( c , a ) superfields @xmath332 in a supersymmetric gauge theory .",
    "that is , @xmath333 where @xmath334 is the gauge covariant superderivative . for our purposes",
    "we consider the case where the gauge group is @xmath335 and @xmath336 .",
    "each @xmath332 may be considered as the supersymmetric version of the field strength for the  @xmath3 factor @xcite .",
    "the gauge fields for this theory live in vector superfields @xmath337 .",
    "we may write @xmath338 where @xmath339 is the charge of @xmath331 with respect to the @xmath3 . in this case",
    "@xmath340 is a ( c , c ) superfield with respect to the standard ( rather than gauge covariant ) superderivatives .",
    "we may then expand @xmath340 as @xmath341 note that for a rigid @xmath3 rotation , @xmath342 , the vector superfield is invariant and so @xmath343 .",
    "the details of the vector superfield are rather messy .",
    "the `` @xmath344-term '' appears in the form @xmath345 in the expansion .",
    "a vector superfield in four dimensions has a real vector boson as its lowest component .",
    "when we dimensionally reduce to two dimensions we thus obtain a two - dimensional vector , which we denote @xmath346 and two real scalars which we combine into a complex scalar @xmath347 .",
    "the action to be considered is @xmath348 where @xmath349 is a neutral holomorphic function and @xmath350 and @xmath351 are real numbers .",
    "the equations of motion for this model together with the condition that we lie in the fixed point set of the fermionic symmetries give @xmath352 the solutions to these equations are governed by the topological invariant @xmath353 where @xmath354 is the field strength of @xmath346 .",
    "this is topological since it may be considered to be the integral of the first chern class over a space . assuming single valuedness of sections of the bundle of which @xmath355 is the curvature would force @xmath51 to be integer",
    "this is the two - dimensional analogue of the familiar second chern class @xmath356 term that appears in four - dimensional yang - mills .",
    "one may also show @xcite that @xmath357 .",
    "the first and third equation of ( [ eq : eom ] ) may be combined to complexify the @xmath335 gauge group to @xmath358 @xcite .",
    "( @xmath359 is the group , under multiplication , of nonzero complex numbers . )",
    "we need only work at tree - level for the purposes of these lectures and thus let us assume that @xmath14 is of genus zero . the third equation in ( [ eq : eom ] ) may then be used to tell us that @xmath360 is a holomorphic section of the line bundle @xmath361 .",
    "the only holomorphic section of @xmath362 , where @xmath53 is negative , is the trivial zero section and so we have @xmath363 this will force some , but in general not all , of the fields @xmath360 to vanish .",
    "therefore , generically , the last equation in ( [ eq : eom ] ) forces @xmath347 to vanish .    for the classical vacuum",
    "we need to find the classical potential .",
    "this is given by @xcite @xmath364 where the equations of motion set the auxiliary fields as in ( [ eq : eom ] ) .",
    "there is one very useful fact which we should immediately note concerning the parameter @xmath351 .",
    "this appears as the coefficient of the term ( [ eq : c1f ] ) .",
    "@xmath351 behaves just like the `` theta '' in four - dimensional yang - mills theory , which only affects the field theory via instantons and correlations are periodic in this variable . in particular ,",
    "if @xmath51 is an integer then @xmath365",
    ".      further discussion of the case @xmath217 and the linear is best illuminated by a specific example . from previous sections we have already discussed two simple methods of construction one might use to build a  threefold . the first method from section [ s : k3 t ] would be to take a complex three - torus and divide out by a subgroup of @xmath366 and blow - up the resulting singularities",
    ". the other method would be to take a complex projective space @xmath367 with homogeneous coordinates @xmath368 $ ] and define a hypersurface , @xmath7 , by the vanishing of a generic polynomial of homogeneous degree 5 in @xmath369 . both of these examples appeared in the original paper on manifolds in string theory @xcite .",
    "the latter space above , the `` quintic threefold '' , is particularly attractive because of the simplicity of @xmath312 .",
    "the moduli space @xmath11 of this  space was computed first in @xcite .",
    "taking a hyperplane @xmath291 and intersecting with the quintic threefold we obtain a divisor .",
    "( since @xmath217 , divisors will now have complex dimension 2 . )",
    "this divisor generates @xmath370 and thus there is a two - form , @xmath121 , associated ( by the same `` dual of a dual '' construction of section [ s : k3 t ] ) to this divisor that generates @xmath123 .",
    "thus the dimension of @xmath371 is one .",
    "the full hodge diamond of this space is # 1#1 @xmath372    therefore @xmath312 is has complex dimension 1 and @xmath321 has dimension 101 . before discussing @xmath13 and @xmath373",
    "let us explore the linear  of @xmath7 .",
    "for our example we set @xmath374 and @xmath375 .",

    "@xmath349 to be neutral we set the @xmath3 charge of each @xmath382 to be + 1 and the charge of @xmath379 to be @xmath383 .",
    "we will also use the letters @xmath369 and @xmath384 to denote the complex bosons which are the lowest respective components of the associated ( c , c ) superfields in the sense of ( [ eq : spex ] ) .",
    "the classical potential energy becomes @xmath385 ^ 2 + |f(x_i)|^2 +          |p|^2\\sum_{i=0}^4\\left|\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x_i }          \\right|^2 + 2|\\sigma|^2\\left(\\sum_{i=0}^4|x_i|^2 +          25|p|^2\\right ) .",
    "\\label{eq : thisu}\\ ] ] we also have from ( [ eq : eom ] ) that @xmath369 are sections of @xmath249 and that @xmath384 is a section of @xmath386 .",
    "in addition , the fields @xmath360 satisfy the constraint @xmath387 .",
    "suppose for the time being that @xmath388 .",
    "since @xmath389 , we have @xmath390 .",
    "if @xmath391 then @xmath384 must be zero by ( [ eq : eom ] ) .",
    "clearly @xmath392 is non - negative .",
    "let us try to solve for @xmath393  this will be the @xmath394 case . to obtain zero for the first term in ( [ eq : thisu ] ) we must have that at least one of the @xmath369 s is non - vanishing .",
    "the last term then forces @xmath117 to vanish . assuming the transversality condition holds , i.e.",
    ", that ( [ eq : smooth ] ) is only satisfied when all the @xmath369 s are zero , then @xmath384 is forced to vanish by ( [ eq : eom ] ) .",
    "the classical vacuum , i.e. @xmath393 , is thus parametrized by @xmath369 subject to the constraints @xmath395 we also have the @xmath3-action @xmath396 . the first equation in ( [ eq : con1 ] ) gives the sphere @xmath397 .",
    "dividing this by the @xmath3 action gives @xmath398 . the easiest way to see",
    "this latter isomorphism is to build @xmath367 in stages as follows :    1 .   take the space @xmath399 with coordinates @xmath400 and remove the origin @xmath401 .",
    "2 .   divide any vector in @xmath402 by its length .",
    "this retracts @xmath402 onto the sphere @xmath397 .",
    "it may be considered as the quotient @xmath403 where @xmath35 is the group of positive real numbers .",
    "3 .   since @xmath404 and @xmath405 , we have @xmath406 where the @xmath407 acts as @xmath396 .",
    "finally , therefore , our target space consists of the hypersurface @xmath387 in the projective space @xmath367 exactly as desired .",
    "it should be noted that this manipulation extending a @xmath3 quotient to a @xmath359 quotient is essentially equivalent to the procedure referred to earlier for identifying @xmath360 as sections of holomorphic bundles .",
    "deforming the quintic equation @xmath408 will produce deformations of complex structure of @xmath7 .",
    "more interestingly , changing @xmath409 will change the radius of @xmath397 and thus the overall scale of @xmath7 .",
    "this is equivalent to deforming the single parameter governing the khler form of @xmath7 .",
    "thus , @xmath409 appears to be a degree of freedom similar to @xmath211 .",
    "it is also tempting to associate @xmath73 with @xmath77 since they both live on a circle and combine with @xmath409 and @xmath211 respectively to form natural complex parameters .",
    "before we make such a bold identification however we must bare in mind that we have not really built the desired non - linear  with target space @xmath7 .",
    "the fields @xmath369 originally span the space @xmath399 .",
    "the metric on this space is the trivial one ( implicitly present in the first term in ( [ eq : linsig ] ) ) .",
    "the metric on @xmath367 is inherited from this original metric by `` symplectic reduction '' @xcite .",
    "this produces the `` fubini - study '' metric on @xmath367 .",
    "the metric on @xmath7 is therefore the restriction of the fubini - study metric .",
    "such a metric is not ricci flat and so can not satisfy ( [ eq:4 lb ] ) in the large radius limit .",
    "actually we have not even the correct degrees of freedom in the linear . in the desired nonlinear",
    "the fields are completely constrained to lie in the target space @xmath7 . while we appear to have the correct behaviour for the low - energy behaviour in the linear  one should expect extra massive fields which are not confined to live in @xmath7 .",
    "therefore , in order to obtain the correct degrees of freedom we should integrate out such massive states . such a procedure may well affect the value of the parameters @xmath73 and @xmath409 .",
    "the correlation functions of the a - model depended on @xmath410 .",
    "this dependence came from instanton effects . to compare the quantities @xmath410 and @xmath411 it should be useful to look at instantons in the linear .",
    "the interested reader is referred to @xcite for more features of these instantons .",
    "the instantons are solutions to the equations ( [ eq : eom ] ) but will not necessarily satisfy @xmath393 .",
    "in particular we have that @xmath369 are sections of @xmath249 .",
    "this forces @xmath51 to be an integer and thus @xmath412 as explained in the previous section .",
    "now let us compare this linear  instanton with the a - model instantons .",
    "an a - model instanton is a holomorphic map from @xmath14 into @xmath7 .",
    "homogeneity requires @xmath51 to be the same for each @xmath369 . now consider a hyperplane @xmath413 .",
    "the image of @xmath14 under the map given by @xmath369 will intersect this hyperplane @xmath51 times if the map is suitably generic .",
    "this is the _ degree _ of the map .    thus far",
    "the linear  instantons and the a - model instantons appear identical .",
    "there is a difference however .",
    "for the a - model , the quantities @xmath369 are homogeneous coordinates of @xmath367 and can not simultaneously vanish .",
    "the @xmath369 s of the linear  are just sections of @xmath249 and therefore not so constrained .",
    "suppose we have an instanton in the linear  where all of the fields @xmath369 vanish at a point @xmath414 and let us assume that @xmath30 .",
    "the equations ( [ eq : eom ] ) and ( [ eq : c1f ] ) dictate that @xmath415 since @xmath388 , the value of @xmath416 must rise rapidly as one moves away from @xmath417 .",
    "in fact , the region on the world sheet around @xmath417 where @xmath416 is not roughly equal to @xmath409 must have an area the order of @xmath418 .",
    "that is , this instanton appears as a small lump around @xmath417 .",
    "we see then that the linear  contains all the instantons of a - model and in addition some small - scale instantons which shrink down to points on the world - sheet in the limit @xmath419 . in order to translate between the coordinate @xmath409 and the coordinate @xmath211 on the respective moduli spaces we need to take into account the effects of these small - scale instantons .",
    "in addition to this non - perturbative correction to @xmath409 we should also consider loops in the perturbation theory .",
    "the super - renormalizability of this gauge theory in two dimensions makes such an analysis rather straight - forward .",
    "we need to consider one - loop diagrams such as the tadpole given by @xmath420{\\smash{$d_l$ } } } \\put(450,615){\\makebox(0,0)[lb]{\\smash{$\\phi_i$ } } } \\end{picture }    \\label{eq : dtad}\\ ] ] this results in a shift in @xmath421 which we will denote @xmath422 .",
    "the value of this shift will vary depending upon our position in the moduli space but should be expected to be finite .",
    "let us write @xmath423 and @xmath424 , where @xmath409 is the _ uncorrected _ parameter in the linear  ( i.e. , we have not taken into account the one - loop effects ) . to calculate how @xmath425 is related to @xmath426",
    "we combine the one - loop and instanton corrections .",
    "this amounts to @xmath427 where @xmath428 represents the first - order effect from the small - scale instantons and @xmath381 represents the higher orders .",
    "let us introduce a variable @xmath429 as an analogy to the variable @xmath430 of ( [ eq : qdef ] ) : @xmath431 the above sign ambiguity is a problem that always occurs in the problem of trying to find the relationship between @xmath96 and @xmath43 .",
    "the idea is that it appears that one can choose a sign so that @xcite @xmath432 where @xmath433 is a power series in @xmath434 with no constant term .",
    "that is , we assume that the @xmath435 term corrects @xmath426 by 0 or @xmath436",
    ". one can determine this explicitly by counting rational curves in the example being studied as was done in @xcite for example .",
    "this conjecture has yet to be proven in general .",
    "standard renormalization arguments in @xmath9=2 theories guarantee that @xmath433 is a holomorphic function .    thus far",
    "the reader may wonder what we have achieved by rephrasing things in terms of the linear .",
    "the answer is that we may now probe the moduli space a long way from the large radius limit at least in some sense  the linear  may be analyzed away from the limit @xmath419 , i.e. , @xmath437 .    as an extreme example",
    "let us consider the case @xmath438 .",
    "now @xmath439 and the fields @xmath369 are forced to be zero ( using the transversality condition when @xmath394 ) . for the classical vacuum",
    "we first look at the vanishing of @xmath392 in ( [ eq : thisu ] ) .",
    "this will force @xmath384 to be nonvanishing .",
    "this in turn forces @xmath117 to vanish .",
    "the equation @xmath387 is now trivially satisfied .",
    "the value of @xmath409 fixes @xmath440 and the @xmath3 gauge symmetry may be used to fix the phase of @xmath384 .",
    "thus all the expectation values of the fields are fixed  the classical target space is a point !",
    "actually , to be more precise , we have a landau - ginzburg orbifold theory .",
    "the fields @xmath369 may have a zero vacuum expectation value but their quantum fluctuations are massless and governed by the superpotential @xmath349 which is of degree 5 in the fields @xmath369 .",
    "we also need to note that the field @xmath384 has charge @xmath383 while the charge of the @xmath369 s is 1 . therefore ,",
    "when the phase of @xmath384 was fixed by using the symmetry @xmath441 , we still have a residual @xmath442 symmetry @xmath443 therefore , the fields @xmath369 effectively live in @xmath444 and our theory is an orbifold .",
    "again this theory has instantons .",
    "now @xmath384 will be nontrivial and a section of @xmath386 .",
    "this means that @xmath445 but that @xmath51 need not be integral .",
    "let us consider the instanton given by @xmath446 .",
    "@xmath384 is a section of @xmath447 and will have one zero on @xmath14 .",
    "let us denote this point on the world - sheet by @xmath417 . since @xmath448 we must have that the value of @xmath449 rises quickly to @xmath450 outside a patch of area of order @xmath451 around this zero on the world - sheet .",
    "thus the interesting part of this instanton configuration is confined to a small lump around this single zero .",
    "the fields @xmath369 live in the bundle @xmath452 and will not be single valued .",
    "in particular , the field @xmath384 will pick up a phase @xmath453 with respect to monodromy around @xmath417 whereas @xmath369 will pick up a phase of @xmath454 around the same point @xmath414 .",
    "this is precisely a twist - field configuration where the map @xmath369 is taking the point @xmath417 on the world - sheet to the origin of the target @xmath444 .",
    "thus by varying the value of @xmath409 , we may switch between a target space of a  hypersurface in @xmath367 ( for which the only massless modes lie within that space ) and a target space which is a point with massless landau - ginzburg - type massless fluctuations about it .",
    "each of these theories has instantons and in each case the action of the instantons goes as @xmath455 so that the instanton effects become negligible in the large @xmath455 limit .",
    "that is , we have `` exactly '' a  theory for @xmath456 ( in an infinitely large target space ) and `` exactly '' a landau - ginzburg orbifold theory for @xmath457 .",
    "we should ask if anything peculiar happens for a finite value of @xmath409 as we change between these two `` phases '' .",
    "the only special value at which something nasty happens occurs classically for @xmath458 . at this value ,",
    "all the fields @xmath369 and @xmath384 may vanish and then @xmath117 may take on any value . any analysis which works for the theory at generic @xmath409 values",
    "should be expected to contain divergences when @xmath409 takes on this value and @xmath117 becomes massless .",
    "actually we have to be a little more careful than this ( and we refer the reader again to @xcite for more detail ) . taking quantum effects properly into account , the minimum energy density for a state at large",
    "@xmath117 goes roughly as @xmath459 .",
    "thus we have a singularity at @xmath460 .",
    "this is the true corrected value for @xmath73 and @xmath409 at the singularity so we need to compute @xmath435 at this point in the moduli space to find @xmath43 .",
    "this may be calculated by assuming that @xmath117 is large and is given purely by the diagram ( [ eq : dtad ] ) .",
    "the result in the case that @xmath374 is that @xcite @xmath461 thus @xmath462 at the singularity .",
    "it turns out that we should choose @xmath463 to get the rational curve count correct @xcite .    to summarize",
    "thus far we have identified three special points in the moduli space . at @xmath185",
    "we have a  target space of infinite radius .",
    "we also know that in the neighbourhood of @xmath185 we may use ( [ eq : q = z ] ) to relate this coordinate to the coordinate in the moduli space of a - models on the same  target space . at @xmath464",
    "the linear  is equivalent to a landau - ginzburg orbifold and at @xmath463 the theory is singular .",
    "now let us address the question of @xmath373 which we expect to be isomorphic to @xmath11 .",
    "first let us carefully build @xmath13 .",
    "analysis of the linear  showed us that there is a landau - ginzburg orbifold theory in the moduli space .",
    "the same must be true for the theory of a - models ( although at this point in the argument we do nt know where it is located ) and therefore @xmath9=2 conformal field theories . if we go to the correct point in @xmath12 , the landau - ginzburg theory in question may be written as a tensor product of minimal @xmath9=2 models and thus the required landau - ginzburg orbifold is an orbifold of such a tensor product @xcite .",
    "the resulting theory is a `` gepner model '' @xcite .",
    "the process for finding the mirror of a gepner model is well - understood @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "the result is that the mirror is a certain orbifold of the original gepner model .",
    "this may then be retranslated back into landau - ginzburg orbifold language .",
    "the required result is as follows .",
    "if @xmath465 is the landau - ginzburg theory defined by the superpotential @xmath466 in @xmath444 where @xmath442 is generated by ( [ eq : z5 ] ) , then the mirror theory @xmath467 is the landau - ginzburg orbifold theory with the same superpotential in the space @xmath468 , where @xmath469 is the group consisting of elements @xmath470 where @xmath72 is a non - trivial fifth root of unity and @xmath471 are integers such that the relation @xmath472 holds .",
    "now we need to look at @xmath373 .",
    "this is given by the moduli space of superpotentials .",
    "in the case of @xmath12 there was a 101 dimensional space of superpotentials , or , equivalently , a 101 dimensional space of complex structures on @xmath7 .",
    "the @xmath469 orbifolding group will project most of these deformations out .",
    "as expected , we are left with one parameter .",
    "we may write @xmath150 in the form @xmath473 where @xmath98 is the parameter .",
    "thus , by construction , @xmath190 is the landau - ginzburg orbifold point which is mirror to the landau - ginzburg orbifold point for @xmath7 .",
    "varying @xmath98 will span the space @xmath373 . at this point @xmath13",
    "is a landau - ginzburg orbifold .",
    "as we found with @xmath7 however , the space of @xmath474 will be such that @xmath13 may be pictured as a smooth  manifold in part of the moduli space of a - models . since we are only concerned with b - model data for @xmath13 we may take @xmath13 to be this smooth  manifold . as a matter of fact",
    "there will be many smooth  manifolds which may be used to represent @xmath13 .",
    "this issue will be explained further in section [ s : phase ] .",
    "since we now have a global description of @xmath373 and of linear s on @xmath7 , it is natural to try to map them to each other .",
    "first we should pick good coordinates on each moduli space such that two different values of the coordinate do not correspond to the same point .",
    "the identification @xmath475 in the neighbourhood of @xmath185 makes @xmath43 a good coordinate at least in the vicinity of the large radius  limit . around the landau - ginzburg point ,",
    "the instanton number @xmath51 need only be an element of @xmath476 and so it would appear that the identification should be @xmath477 . actually there is a @xmath442 symmetry around the point @xmath464 which identifies theories such that we restore @xmath475 . as indicated earlier , the instantons with non - integer @xmath51 may be thought of as twist fields . a twist field @xmath478",
    "then transforms under this @xmath442 symmetry as @xmath479 therefore @xmath43 is a good coordinate locally around @xmath464 .",
    "picturing the moduli space as @xmath235 with @xmath43 the usual affine coordinate , we have done enough to show that @xmath43 is a good coordinate everywhere ( together with the point @xmath464 ) .    the @xmath442 transformation generated by @xmath480",
    "can be made a symmetry of ( [ eq : ydef ] ) by extending it so that @xmath481 .",
    "therefore @xmath98 is not a good coordinate .",
    "this symmetry of @xmath98 is the only one induced by symmetries of the equation ( [ eq : ydef ] ) .",
    "this means that @xmath482 is a good coordinate .",
    "we now wish to map these two @xmath235 moduli spaces to each other in a one to one manner .",
    "the pervading @xmath9=2 structure present means that we expect this map to be holomorphic .",
    "this forces @xmath483 where @xmath484 are complex numbers such that @xmath485 .",
    "we may thus fix this map by identifying three points .",
    "we have already identified @xmath464 and @xmath190 as the landau - ginzburg orbifold point .",
    "we know that @xmath463 corresponds to a singular theory",
    ". the equation ( [ eq : ydef ] ) satisfies ( [ eq : smooth ] ) when @xmath486 .",
    "this therefore provides a natural candidate for the singular point in @xmath373 .",
    "actually , if one attempts to calculate correlation functions using the `` chiral ring '' of @xcite then it is precisely when ( [ eq : smooth ] ) is satisfied that these calculations become badly defined .",
    "thus we map @xmath463 to @xmath486 . for our last point",
    "we pick the large radius  point @xmath185",
    ". clearly it would be unnatural for this point to be anything other than @xmath487 . to check this",
    "however one may put the zamolodchikov metric on @xmath11 and @xmath373 .",
    "the point @xmath185 maps to @xmath488 in @xmath11 which corresponds to the large radius limit and is thus an infinite distance away from other points on @xmath235 .",
    "the same is true for @xmath487 on @xmath373 @xcite .",
    "we have thus fixed @xmath489    it is amazing just how simple ( [ eq : zpsi ] ) is .",
    "this is the justification of our using the linear .",
    "while the map between @xmath11 ( in terms of @xmath96 ) and @xmath373 ( in terms of @xmath98 ) is rather complicated , there is a very simple relation between the linear  version of @xmath11 ( in terms of @xmath43 ) and @xmath373 . at this point",
    "it is very tempting to end our analysis of the moduli spaces since in many ways we have all the information we need concerning the moduli space .",
    "the only problem is that we have described @xmath11 in terms of the coordinate @xmath43 rather than @xmath96 .",
    "recall that @xmath96 was derived from the khler form and thus ultimately differential geometry .",
    "it appears that @xmath43 is the coordinate that appears more naturally in string theory and perhaps we should rewrite general relativity in terms of degrees of freedom naturally expressed in terms of this parameter rather than @xmath96 .",
    "rather than attempting such an ambitious problem we will submit to the present conventions for describing space - time and try to reparametrize our moduli space in terms of @xmath96 .",
    "actually the analysis of section [ ss : t - alg ] allows us to do this without much more work .",
    "recall that we found @xmath490 in terms of a ratio of periods on the mirror , in this case @xmath13 .",
    "one may use the local geometry of the moduli space @xmath9=2 theories to show that this is also the case for any @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "therefore we just need the picard - fuchs equation for these periods to find @xmath96 as a function of @xmath43 .",
    "the desired equation for the periods @xmath178 is @xcite @xmath491 the four solutions of this hypergeometric differential equation are characterized by their monodromy around @xmath185 , which goes as @xmath492 respectively . the powerful constraint ( [ eq : q = z ] )",
    "then determines the answer uniquely to be @xmath493 where @xmath494,\\cr}\\ ] ] where @xmath495 is the digamma function defined as the derivative of @xmath496 .",
    "these periods may also be found directly from a smooth model of @xmath13 without going via the picard - fuchs equation @xcite .",
    "we may now expand @xmath96 as @xmath497 which converges for @xmath498 .",
    "thus , by using mirror symmetry we have been able to determine the precise form of ( [ eq : q = z ] ) .",
    "it should come as no surprise that this series has a radius of convergence equal to @xmath499 since the singular theory lies at @xmath463 . at the point",
    "@xmath463 the series just manages to converge and we obtain @xmath500 we denote this value of @xmath120 by @xmath501 . if we have a  manifold diffeomorphic to the quintic hypersurface and if the size of it is such that the area of a curve which generates @xmath252 is larger than about @xmath502 then we can place precisely where our model lies in the moduli space of @xmath9=2 theories by using ( [ eq : q = zquin ] ) .",
    "we have not yet accounted for the complete moduli space of these theories however .",
    "what about the region where @xmath503 ? at this point the series fails to converge .",
    "if we try to compute correlation functions using the nonlinear  for a point in this region of the moduli space we will also find that the instanton corrections form a divergent series too . if we were to be pragmatic at this point we should say that the nonlinear  is not such a good picture for any theory in the region @xmath503 and that some other picture is more appropriate .",
    "indeed , we already know what the other picture is  we should interpret such theories as landau - ginzburg orbifolds corrected by instantons . actually , to use more conventional conformal field theory language , these instantons are twist fields .",
    "one may deform a conformal field theory orbifold by a twist field which is also a truly marginal operator . although the resulting theory will not generically be an orbifold",
    ", one may compute correlation functions as a power series in terms of the fields in the original orbifold theory .",
    "this will be a power series in the coupling to the marginal operator in the usual way in conformal perturbation theory .",
    "one will find that such a series will converge when @xmath503 .",
    "for any point ( except when @xmath504 ) in the moduli space @xmath11 we may therefore associate an effective target space theory . in one region",
    "we have a  manifold with instanton corrections and in the other region we a landau - ginzburg orbifold perturbed by twisted marginal operators .",
    "both types of theories have correlators in the form of convergent power series .",
    "the regions do not overlap .",
    "this leads to the `` phase '' picture of the moduli space @xcite .",
    "we do not have some universal picture for a target space @xmath7 associated to @xmath11 .",
    "it is necessary to have a set of target space descriptions which are applicable in various regions in @xmath11 .",
    "the attentive reader may have realized that , because we have holomorphic functions , we should be able to analytically continue our series beyond their radius of convergence .",
    "certainly this is possible as we now explain .",
    "one can therefore begin to interpret one phase of the moduli space in terms of other phases .",
    "the more cautious reader might declare such a process to be unnatural however .",
    "anyway , let us see what happens when we extend the  picture into the landau - ginzburg region .    to analytically continue we first need to apply branch cuts .",
    "the branch points are clearly @xmath505 . in our identification of the strip @xmath506 , where @xmath507 , with the hemisphere @xmath498 we have already cut from @xmath185 to @xmath463 .",
    "we require another cut emanating from @xmath464 . to avoid changing the hemisphere around @xmath185 which is already in the desired form , we cut form @xmath464 to @xmath463 .",
    "this latter cut may be performed by returning to our variable @xmath98 and imposing @xmath508 the same method of barnes integrals as was used in section [ ss : t - alg ] then yields @xmath509 as a convergent power series for @xmath510 .",
    "we may now map the entire @xmath235 of @xmath11 into the @xmath506-plane .",
    "the result is shown in figure [ fig : bjquin ] .",
    "the first striking feature of figure [ fig : bjquin ] is that not all values of @xmath120 are allowed .",
    "the sphere is mapped to the striped region and so @xmath120 acquires a minimum value of @xmath511 .",
    "this fits in with the idea of a minimum allowed size as we saw for the circle .",
    "any conformal field theory in this class may be associated with a manifold of a size scale no less than the order of the planck length .",
    "the shaded area in figure [ fig : bjquin ] represents the area in which the instanton sum for the  nonlinear  converges . depending on one s taste",
    ", one might wish to declare this to set the minimum length and then say that the bottom region must be describe in terms of landau - ginzburg orbifolds .",
    "a very important point to note is the following .",
    "the striped region in figure [ fig : bjquin ] may at first sight look similar to a fundamental @xmath107 region in the upper half plane as we had for the torus example in section [ s : torus ] .",
    "sadly the region in figure [ fig : bjquin ] _ can not _ be obtained this way .",
    "one may map this region by a transcendental function to another region which may be written in the form of a fundamental region @xcite but as this map is not one - to - one it is not clear what purpose this can serve for a model of the moduli space .",
    "the moduli spaces for the torus and for k3 surfaces appeared naturally in the form of a teichmller space divided by some modular group .",
    "it appears that for more generic @xmath9=2 theories such a description is no longer valid .",
    "this should not dishearten the reader however  we were still able to find @xmath11 without such a description .",
    "in the last section we looked at the simplest case of a moduli space for a nontrivial case @xmath217 .",
    "it was found that the space naturally divided into two phases . in this section",
    "we will discuss the more general picture .      to facilitate the discussion it will prove useful to run through another example .",
    "this example was first analyzed in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "the idea is very similar to that of the quintic hypersurface except this time we begin with a _ weighted _ projective space @xmath512 .",
    "this is the space with homogeneous coordinates @xmath368 $ ] , omitting @xmath513 $ ] , where we identify @xmath514\\cong[\\lambda^2x_0,\\lambda^2x_1 ,      \\lambda^2x_2,\\lambda x_3,\\lambda x_4],\\ ] ] where @xmath515 .",
    "the desired  hypersurface is given by @xmath516 this hypersurface is not smooth .",
    "there is a @xmath55 singularity along the surface @xmath517 $ ] in @xmath512 which intersects our hypersurface along a curve . at each point on the curve , this singularity is essentially the same as the the one studied in section [ s : k3 t ] .",
    "thus we may blow each point of the curve up to get @xmath235 to smooth the space .",
    "the resulting exceptional divisor , @xmath518 , will be a surface ( basically the old curve@xmath519 ) .",
    "this smooth  manifold , containing the surface @xmath518 , will be our smooth model for @xmath7 .",
    "the hyperplane in @xmath512 produces another divisor in @xmath7 which we call @xmath520 .",
    "the divisors @xmath518 and @xmath520 are associated to two linearly independent elements of @xmath371 .",
    "in fact @xmath521 and these elements form a basis",
    ". therefore @xmath11 is now two - dimensional .    for witten s linear",
    "we now want @xmath522 and so we need two @xmath3 charges and on complexification have two @xmath359 actions to consider on the target space .",
    "we assign the following charges : @xmath523 and have the following superpotential @xmath524 where @xmath381 represents other term that may be added ( with arbitrary coefficients ) respecting the quasi - homogeneity of the equation .",
    "the @xmath344-terms are now fixed by the equations of motion as @xmath525 recall that for the example in section [ ss : eg1 ] we found that fields which were sections of @xmath249 vanished when @xmath439 even though one might initially expect this only to be the case when @xmath276 .",
    "the @xmath394 case should be checked by the transversality condition .",

    "therefore they all vanish .",
    "taking the @xmath344-terms to vanish to solve @xmath393 forces a non - zero value for @xmath535 and @xmath384 which may be fixed by the @xmath536 gauge group .",

    "there is a residual @xmath537 symmetry left over so that our theory is actually a landau - ginzburg theory with target space @xmath538 .",
    "2 .   @xmath526 and @xmath539 : in this case @xmath540 which forces @xmath541 . solving for @xmath393 , the @xmath344-terms force @xmath535 to be non - zero and",
    "that @xmath542 can not simultaneously vanish .",
    "we may use one @xmath359 symmetry to fix @xmath535 .",
    "the other one may be used to turn @xmath542 into the homogeneous coordinates of @xmath512 .",
    "the target space is thus the hypersurface @xmath152 in @xmath512 .",

    "first assume that @xmath559 .",
    "we may then use one of the @xmath359-actions to fix @xmath535 . let the other @xmath359 make @xmath542 into homogeneous coordinates .",
    "our target space is now very similar to that of the hypersurface in @xmath512 except that we are missing the points where @xmath560 and @xmath561 .",
    "now let @xmath546 .",
    "now we have @xmath561 and @xmath548 and @xmath549 may be any value except both zero .",
    "use one of the @xmath359-actions to turn @xmath533 into the homogeneous coordinates of @xmath235 and the other @xmath359-action turn @xmath531 into homogeneous coordinates . what we have is a description of the smooth , blown - up  manifold described above  the singular point set has been replaced by an exceptional divisor consisting of a curve times @xmath235 .",
    "this is the `` '' phase .",
    "this produces a `` phase diagram '' which we show in figure [ fig : ph ] .",
    "the instantons which appear in each sector can now appear in various forms .",
    "the cases are given as follows :    1 .",
    "for the landau - ginzburg orbifold we have only twist - fields .",
    "2 .   for the orbifold phase we have two kinds .",
    "firstly we have rational - curve type instantons ( together with their small - scale supplements ) .",
    "secondly we have twist - field instantons confined to the region around the @xmath55-quotient singularity .",
    "3 .   for the @xmath235 phase",
    "we have rational curve type instantons  the rational curve being @xmath235 itself !",
    "we also have twist - field instantons in the landau - ginzburg fibre since this has a @xmath551 quotient singularity .",
    "4 .   for the  phase",
    "we have rational curve instantons .",
    "now let us consider the mirror , @xmath13 , of this example .",
    "this is obtained by dividing @xmath7 by the group @xmath562 consisting of elements @xmath563 where @xmath564 and @xmath565 are all integers .",
    "the general form of the defining equation for @xmath13 is then @xmath566 where @xmath41 and @xmath98 are complex parameters that vary the complex structure of @xmath13 .",
    "this is in agreement with our expectation that @xmath567 . to map the space spanned by @xmath41 and @xmath98 to the moduli space of linear s for @xmath7 we need to find special points in these spaces .",
    "we first consider the values of @xmath98 and @xmath41 for which the hypersurface ( [ eq : fy2 ] ) becomes singular .",
    "a little algebra shows that @xmath568 for all @xmath369 admits nontrivial solution when @xmath569 or @xmath570 . with some foresight",
    "let us introduce the variables @xmath571 we may now map the singular points in our moduli space into the @xmath572 plane .",
    "that is we find the values for @xmath573 and @xmath574 for which there can be a @xmath41 and @xmath98 which give a singular @xmath13 .",
    "the result is shown in figure [ fig : ph2 ]    now imagine that we `` zoom out '' infinitely far from figure [ fig : ph2 ] .",
    "it should be easy to see that the shaded region will become precisely the phase boundaries in figure [ fig : ph ] .",
    "in fact , the variables in ( [ eq : rhos ] ) were chosen precisely so that we may make the identification @xmath575 and @xmath576 .",
    "the fact that the asymptotes of the region in figure [ fig : ph2 ] are parallel to , rather than along , lines passing through the origin comes from the one - loop renormalization effects of @xmath350  just as we had a @xmath577 shift in section [ ss : eg1 ] . thus assuming a simple map between the b - model moduli space coordinates and the linear  coordinates as we had in ( [ eq : zpsi ] ) , we obtain @xmath578 the reader is referred to @xcite for the complete proof that this is indeed the correct map .",
    "again we may calculate the picard - fuch s equation for this two - parameter example @xcite . again ( [ eq : q = z ] ) uniquely determines the relationships @xmath579 this is a convergent power series in the calabi - yau phase .    as before each phase leads to some notion of a series for correlation functions which will be convergent in some region .",
    "in the example studied in section [ ss : eg1 ] we found that any generic point in the moduli space lay in the region of convergence of one of the power series .",
    "this is no longer the case in this two parameter example .",
    "the shaded region in figure [ fig : ph2 ] marks where none of the power series converge . in this sense",
    ", the phase picture does not cover the entire moduli space although it will cover most of a circle with center @xmath580 in the limit of infinite radius .",
    "as we did in section [ ss : eg1 ] we may analytically continue the @xmath430 s into the other three phases .",
    "this calculation was done in @xcite .",
    "doing so one obtains the following bound for the entire moduli space @xmath581 this is a very important result .",
    "it means that the algebraic curves in @xmath7 whose areas are measured by @xmath120 ( i.e. , the rational curves in the exceptional divisor ) may shrink down to zero size .",
    "* we have broken the constraint of a minimum length .",
    "*    the reader may argue that we analytically continued @xmath430 beyond the  phase and so we may artificially have been able to reach zero size .",
    "actually in this case , @xmath120 can take on arbitrarily small values while one remains in the  phase @xcite .",
    "thus one really is forced to reject a notion of minimum length in this example .",
    "it is worth noting that general arguments have been made which appear to prove a universal notion of minimum length ( such as @xcite ) .",
    "these arguments appear to rely on the assumption that space - time is locally flat , i.e. , one believes the differential geometry view . unless we can concoct some alternative view of small distances this will appear to show that differential geometry is seriously misleading at small scales !",
    "the examples studied so far show many of the aspects of the global structure of the moduli space  @xmath12 is rather dull and can be explained classically while @xmath11 forces a `` phase '' description upon us and forces us to rethink our notions of geometry at small scales .",
    "let try to understand the more general picture of @xmath11 .",
    "one of the phase transitions for the example studied in section [ ss : eg2 ] was between an orbifold and a  manifold .",
    "it was precisely the blow - up of section [ s : k3 t ] .",
    "all of the phase transitions mentioned thus far are actually of this type .",
    "let us return to the example of the quintic threefold of section [ ss : eg1 ] .",
    "the two phases here were a smooth  manifold and an landau - ginzburg theory in @xmath444 .",
    "the natural question to ask is if we can blow - up the quotient singularity @xmath444 .",
    "the answer is yes , and the procedure is very similar to that of blowing up the @xmath230 singularity . in the latter case we used the line bundle over @xmath235 with first chern class @xmath582 .",
    "for @xmath444 we use the line bundle over @xmath367 with first chern class @xmath383 .",
    "that is , the exceptional divisor is @xmath367  but @xmath367 is precisely the ambient space for the  phase .",
    "this leads us to the following general picture .",
    "define @xmath7 as the critical point set of some function @xmath349 on some ( non - compact ) space , @xmath583 . by blowing up and down quotient singularities in @xmath583",
    "we induce the phase transitions in @xmath7 .",
    "the singularity @xmath538 is blown up using an exceptional divisor with two irreducible components . having each of these components blown up or down leads to the 4 phases .",
    "for example , the first component is @xmath584 .",
    "blowing up the landau - ginzburg phase using this component gives the @xmath235 phase .",
    "this still has @xmath551 singularities all along this @xmath235 .",
    "the second component is @xmath367 .",
    "this component resolves the @xmath551 singularities in each fibre .",
    "the restriction to the critical point set of @xmath349 in each fibre forms a quartic constraint .",
    "a quartic in constraint in @xmath367 is a k3 surface .",
    "thus this latter phase is a fibre bundle over @xmath235 with generically a k3 fibre .",
    "this is one description of the smooth  manifold @xcite .",
    "we may also reach the smooth phase by blowing up along @xmath367 first to obtain the orbifold phase and then along @xmath585 to resolve the orbifold .",
    "have we constructed the general picture by considering blow - ups of quotient singularities ?",
    "the answer to this question is no .",
    "we should then ask the question as to whether there is any transformation that might give the general picture .",
    "the answer that appears to be the case is that we consider `` birational '' transformations .",
    "birational transformations occur very naturally in algebraic geometry and thus we should nt be too surprised that they will be natural objects in @xmath9=2 theories .",
    "two algebraic varieties @xmath586 and @xmath587 are birationally equivalent if one can find open subsets @xmath588 and @xmath589 such that the set of functions in @xmath590 is isomorphic to the set of functions in @xmath591 ( see @xcite for a more careful definition ) .",
    "an example of birationally equivalent pairs are given by @xmath586 being a blow - up of @xmath587 .",
    "another example of birational equivalence can be provided still from quotient singularities .",
    "this stems from the fact that the process of blowing - up a quotient singularity need not be a unique process .",
    "suppose we have a singular space @xmath592 which may be smoothed by blowing - up into two topologically distinct smooth spaces @xmath586 and @xmath587 .",
    "these two smooth spaces are then birationally equivalent .    in @xcite",
    "an example with @xmath593 was studied .",
    "this requires toric geometry which takes us beyond the scope of these lectures so we will not provide details here .",
    "there are 100 phases in all for this model of which 5 consist of smooth  manifolds .",
    "these 5 manifolds are all the possible resolutions of an orbifold which provides one of the other phases",
    ".    one may also picture a direct transition between these manifolds in the form of a `` flop '' as we now explain .",
    "we can raise our example of a @xmath230 quotient singularity of section [ s : k3 t ] to one higher dimension by considering the space @xmath594 in @xmath595 with coordinates @xmath596 .",
    "transversality tells us that this hypersurface has an isolated singularity at @xmath597 .",
    "it can not be written as a quotient singularity .",
    "now consider the space @xmath598,(x , y , z , w)\\in\\p^1\\times\\c^4;\\ , az = bx , ay = bw\\}.      \\label{eq : flop1}\\ ] ] this smooths the singularity , in a manner similar to blow - ups discussed earlier , replacing the singular point by @xmath235 .",
    "the space @xmath598,(x , y , z , w)\\in\\p^1\\times\\c^4;\\ , aw = bx , ay = bz\\ }      \\label{eq : flop2}\\ ] ] does pretty much the same thing .",
    "the only difference between ( [ eq : flop1 ] ) and ( [ eq : flop2 ] ) is the way in which the @xmath235 is inserted .",
    "the two smooth spaces produced are said to differ by a flop . this local picture",
    "may be fitted into more complicated global geometries .",
    "these five smooth models for @xmath7 occupy adjacent phases ( since they are related by flops ) in the phase picture and so we may consider a path of conformal field theories passing from one to the other .",
    "so long as this path is generic , it will not hit the singularity lying in the complex codimension one `` phase boundary '' and so this transition is perfectly smooth from the conformal field theory point of view .",
    "this shows how string theory can give rise to a `` smooth topology change '' in the target space so long as the two topological spaces are birationally equivalent as algebraic varieties .    if the reader was not convinced thus far that algebraic geometry was superior to differential geometry for our purposes then this last point must surely convince them .",
    "the natural equivalence class in differential geometry is that of diffeomorphic equivalence which is a class stronger than topological equivalence .",
    "string theory happily combines different classes smoothly into the same moduli space  string theory is oblivious to such distinctions",
    "! however , every phase in a given moduli space belongs to single birational equivalence class .",
    "there are many more possibilities of birational transformations than those provided by resolving quotient singularities and flops .",
    "one of the more exotic ones is the `` exoflop '' of @xcite . in the case of the flop",
    ", one @xmath235 is transformed into another one within a manifold . in the the case of an exoflop",
    ", a rational curve is taken from within the  manifold to one glued onto the outside .",
    "the complete picture of possible phases is far from complete . the most general construction for models for which one understands the linear  is that provided by @xcite .",
    "these are explored to some extent @xcite although the full range of possibilities have yet to be classified .",
    "one interesting point discussed in @xcite is that the phase diagrams need not contain any smooth  phase .",
    "this really is quite natural given that there is nothing particularly special about the smooth  phase  it has no more reason to exist than any of the other phases .",
    "the reason we tend to like manifolds rather than the other phases is because we tend to be happier with differential geometry which only works properly in this phase .    having said that we should rid our minds of any bias towards the manifold phase we should note some rather interesting curiosities which occur when we try to analyze the whole moduli space in terms of these smooth phases .",
    "let us consider the five parameter example of @xcite which has 100 phases of which 5 are  manifolds .",
    "when we do the analytic continuation analysis to map out the entire moduli space in terms of one phase , which  phase should we begin with ?",
    "the surprising answer is that is does nt actually matter as we now explain .",
    "suppose we begin with one of the topologies for @xmath7 which we denote @xmath586 .",
    "thus we have some phase in the moduli space containing the large radius limit of @xmath586 where we put @xmath599 .",
    "now let @xmath587 be another topology which is obtained by flopping @xmath586 .",
    "this flop will correspond to a rational curve @xmath600 and another rational curve @xmath601 which arise in the form of equations ( [ eq : flop1 ] ) and ( [ eq : flop2 ] ) .",
    "we may chose @xmath602 such that @xmath603 now we consider the flop process . to make things simple",
    "we should make every rational curve in @xmath586 have infinite area except for @xmath270 .",
    "this may be achieved by setting @xmath604 .",
    "now we analyze the picard - fuch s equation to obtain @xmath602 in terms of @xmath605 .",
    "the result is @xcite @xmath606 analysis of the phase picture shows that if we introduce coordinates @xmath607 for a patch of coordinates with origin at the large radius limit of @xmath587 then @xmath608 .",
    "we also have @xmath609 .",
    "this means that the analytic continuation between these two phases simply asserts that the area of @xmath270 is minus the area of @xmath610 .",
    "thus we naturally identify a topology with a certain conformal field theory by demanding that all areas be positive .",
    "it appears to be the case @xcite that the following now applies in the case that there is at least one  phase .",
    "given any conformal field theory we may associate some  target space topology ( possibly by analytic continuation ) in which all areas are non - negative .",
    "that is to say when we go from a phase picture in terms of @xmath350 s which covers the whole space @xmath611 and then remap this space into the space of @xmath612 s then only points within ( or on the boundary of ) cones corresponding to smooth  phases are covered .",
    "this is shown schematically in figure [ fig : ka ] for a hypothetical example with @xmath522 and five phases @xmath613 for which only @xmath586 and @xmath587 are smooth  manifolds .",
    "we hope the reader is convinced that algebraic geometry together with mirror symmetry is a very useful tool for analyzing the moduli space of @xmath9=2 theories .",
    "although sticking to metric - based ideas seems to work without any problems for some models , it appears to face severe short - comings in the generic case . in particular , when there are instantons one tends to have phases since one will have instanton sums which are only convergent in a certain region of the moduli space .",
    "when this happens the other phases appear to have an equal right to be taken as a model for the target space and then one necessarily needs to discuss singular spaces .",
    "where metric - based ideas may work , in the case @xmath217 , appears to be restricted to the few cases where @xmath614 ( which implies that @xmath615 which in turn implies that the target space has a continuous isometry ) .",
    "although we did nt discuss these examples in detail , the interested reader may try to apply the methods of section [ s : torus ] and [ s : k3 t ] for these cases .",
    "the methods used in section [ s : d=3 ] have certain shortcomings which may not have been completely apparent .",
    "firstly there may be some subtleties introduced into the phase picture if there are some symmetries of the defining equation that are not of the most nave kind .",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite for such an example .",
    "another , more severe , problem is that not all of the dimensions of the moduli space may be parametrized by the linear .",
    "that is , we may only be able to write down models based on a gauge group @xmath335 where @xmath616 .",
    "the mirror to this statement is the fact that not all deformations of a complete intersection can , in general , be written as deformations of the defining equations @xcite .",
    "we do not have any techniques at our disposal to address the complete moduli spaces of such objects at this point in time .",
    "we should also repeat that some @xmath9=2 conformal field theories can not be put in the form of a gauged @xmath3 linear  at all .",
    "this is equivalent to the statement in geometry that not all  manifolds can be written as complete intersections in toric varieties .",
    "one may try to extend methods to nonabelian gauge groups .",
    "although such models were discussed in @xcite , since the mirror map construction for such models is not yet understood , we may not apply most of the methods discussed in this paper .",
    "also there is no reason to believe that these nonabelian groups will exhaust all the @xmath9=2 theories .",
    "although the moduli space of @xmath9=2 theories is far better understood now than people imagined a few years ago it appears that there is still much left to discover .",
    "it is a pleasure to thank b. greene , d. morrison and r. plesser for many useful conversations .",
