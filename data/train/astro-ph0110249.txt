    "polar ring galaxies ( prgs ) are early - type galaxies surrounded by an outer ring , made up by gas , stars and dust , which orbits in a nearly perpendicular plane to the equatorial one of the central galaxy ( whitmore et al .",
    "ngc  4650a is considered the prototype of the class of wide polar ring galaxies , because the two components are bright and well - defined ( whitmore 1991 ) .",
    "this object is one of the best - investigated polar ring galaxy , in particular to put limits on the 3-d shape of its dark matter halo ( whitmore et al . , 1987 ;",
    "sackett & sparke , 1990 ; sackett et al . , 1994 and combes & arnaboldi , 1996 ) .",
    "to this aim , new high - resolution 21-cm observations were carried out by arnaboldi et al . in 1997 at the australia telescope compact array .",
    "these were meant to resolve the rotation curve at small radii , where velocities were measured into two planes , the polar ring and the host galaxy equatorial plane , and to reach out at larger distances into the halo .",
    "the results showed that the total hi mass in this system is @xmath0 @xmath1 , and the hi distribution and kinematics is consistent with the one of a spiral disk . the spiral pattern proposed by arnaboldi et al .",
    "( 1997 ) seems to be confirmed by the recent hst image of ngc  4650a , acquired during the heritage project ( gallagher et al .",
    "2001 ) .    is a polar disk likely to form in the standard picture for the formation and evolution of polar ring galaxies ?",
    "the standard scenario suggests that a gas - rich dwarf galaxy was either accreted by an early - type galaxy , or gas was stripped from a nearby gas - rich object during a high speed encounter .",
    "the accreted material would then form a ring ( quinn 1991 , hernquist & weil 1993 ) , which settles into one of the principal plane of the gravitational potential associated with the host galaxy ( heisler , merritt and schwarzschild , 1982 ; bertola et al .",
    "several studies focused on the evolution and stability of highly inclined rings .",
    "smoothed - particle hydrodynamic simulations with strong dissipative cooling by katz & rix ( 1992 ) and christodoulou et al .",
    "( 1992 ) were used to study the evolution of low mass , highly inclined ring .",
    "katz & rix ( 1992 ) and christodoulou et al .",
    "( 1992 ) showed that a narrow ring precesses very slowly in a quasi - equilibrium configuration , with no appreciable evolution over an hubble time .",
    "the gas stripping scenario was studied by reshetnikov & sotnikova ( 1997 ) .",
    "they analyzed the different morphologies generated in high speed encounters between an elliptical or an s0 galaxy , and a gas rich disk .",
    "their results indicate that the average radius at which the ring forms is related to the central mass ( luminous + dark ) concentration of the host galaxy .",
    "if the mass is highly concentrated , the ring forms at smaller radii ; if the host galaxy has an extended massive halo , the ring average radius ( @xmath2 ) can be as large as 30  kpc .",
    "the common characteristics of all these secondary events , i.e. accretion of a dwarf or gas stripping , are the formation of narrow polar annuli , whose radial extent is of the order of 10% of the average radius , for a quasi - stable configuration , and the total amount of accreted gas is up to @xmath3 @xmath1 .",
    "a quite different approach to the formation of polar ring galaxies was proposed recently by bekki ( 1998 ) . in this scenario the polar ring results from a `` polar '' merger of two disk galaxies with unequal mass .",
    "the `` intruder '' , on a polar orbit with respect to the `` victim '' disk , passes through it near its center : it is slowed down , and pulled back toward the victim , by strong dissipation which is caused by the interaction with the victim gaseous disk . in this encounter the two galaxies must have a small relative velocity , so that the intruder is brought to rest at the center of the victim s disk .",
    "dissipation removes the random kinetic energy of the gaseous component of the victim s disk , so that some gas can settle again into a disky configuration .",
    "the morphology of the merger remnants depends on the merging initial orbital parameter and the initial mass ratio of the two galaxies .",
    "bekki s scenario successfully reproduces many of the observed morphologies for polar ring galaxies , such as the existence of both wide and narrow rings , helical rings and double rings ( whitmore 1991 ) .",
    "when wide polar rings are produced they have the following characteristics : 1 ) there is no central hole in the polar structure ; 2 ) mass distributions in the central component and ring become more centrally concentrated after the encounter ; an r@xmath4 profile can develop if the `` intruder '' disk is much more massive than the `` victim '' ; 3 ) the central component is nearly gas - free , similar to an s@xmath5-like system , while the density wave triggered by the intruder into the victim disk causes rapid star formation , within @xmath6 yr , so that the polar structure is characterized by a very young stellar population .",
    "this kind of model ( sec .",
    "3.2.5 in bekki s 1998 paper ) does predict peculiar characteristics for the intruder too : the intruder experiences both a heating of the disk ( it puffs up ) and energy dissipation , so that its density should increase relative to standard unperturbed stellar disks . while the ` gas - accretion ' scenario can account for the existence of rings ,",
    "the bekki scenario would also explain the presence of wide and massive polar disks .",
    "one uncertainty related to the bekki scenario is whether the polar rings formed in this way are stable , i.e. for how long these objects can preserve the polar morphology after the merger remnant reaches virial equilibrium .    to perform a detailed test of these two scenarios for the formation of prgs we need to have data with the highest angular resolution , to resolve the inner central morphology of the polar ring and the central host galaxy , plus the nir data , to probe the stellar population without the strong absorption caused by dust .",
    "such a data set is now available for ngc  4650a and the aim of this work is to compare the predictions from different formation scenarios with the observational results from a study of the new nir and high resolution hst data .",
    "we adopt a distance of 41 mpc based on @xmath7 km @xmath8 and an heliocentric radial velocity @xmath9 km @xmath10 .",

    "the zero points that we derived are in good agreement with the indicative values derived for the caspir camera ( available in the caspir user manual ) in each band ; the differences in zero points were less than 0.1 mag . the ring in ngc  4650a is too extended to lie inside one single pointing , therefore it was necessary to take two different frames and mosaic them in a single image .",

    "compared with the pixel - to - pixel variation , we found that there is more noise , both within sky regions of moderate size and between such regions , than predicted by a pure counting ( poisson ) model .",
    "large scale variations in the background , due to an imperfect flatfield correction , contributed significantly to this `` extra noise '' . for the areas within which we measured magnitudes and colors ( see sec.[photo ] below )",

    "the values for the apparent @xmath31 ratio of the s0 disk , which is @xmath32 , should be considered an upper limit to the true flattening : the warp present in the s0 disk makes the isophotes more boxy in the outer parts and therefore may produce a larger @xmath31 value .",

    "the disk scalelength of the central spheroid in the i band is about 1 arcsec larger than in the kn band , which may suggest that there could be a difference in the stellar population of the s0 disk as function of radius .      because of the polar ring morphology in the optical ,",
    "the luminosity profile along the polar ring major axis is computed as averages of 20 extracted profiles , parallel to p.a .",

    "the polar ring scalelength decreases from the optical to the nir bands , i.e. the polar ring is more extended in the optical than in the nir , and may also suggests the presence of different stellar populations : an older inner component and a more extended , younger , one .",
    "an important quantity related to the size of the polar ring is the moment of its radial distribution @xmath40    where @xmath2 is the average radius @xmath41 weighted by the surface brightness distribution and @xmath25 is the effective radius of the central component . for a pure exponential disk",

    "the process of ring formation through accretion / stripping of a gas - rich companion takes few gyrs at most . in this scenario",
    "the host galaxy is an early - type gas - free system and preserves its structure ( luminosity profile , b / d ratio , scale parameters ) , while some star formation is triggered by the event ( arnaboldi et al .",
    "1993 ) .",
    "the merging scenario of two disks can account for the formation of narrow rings as well as of wide / massive disk - like structures , depending on the initial mass ratio of the two merging progenitors . according to this scenario ,",
    "the polar structure represents what remains of the `` victim '' disk galaxy , while the accreted `` intruder '' has supplied the s0-like component .",
    "polar rings are more likely to form when the two disks encounter each other on a polar orbit , with a small initial orbital angular momentum ( bekki 1998 ) .",
    "this dissipative merger event transforms the intruder s thin stellar disk into a thicker structure . both intruder s and victim s",
    "disk radial mass distribution deviates from the initial exponential profiles as the merger process goes on .",
    "when extended polar structures are formed ( depending on the intruder / victim mass ratio ) , they are characterized by the absence of a hole in the central regions , and their hi content can be as large as that of late - type spirals , i.e. up to @xmath72 .",
    "the predicted evolution time for the whole resulting polar ring galaxy is of about @xmath3 yr , and the outwardly propagating gaseous waves , excited by the intruder galaxy , trigger a burst of stellar formation in the polar disk .",
    "what are the observational properties of the polar ring galaxy ngc  4650a ?",
    "can they discriminate between the two scenarios ? both in the nir and hst images , we have found that stellar light and dust lanes connect the outer parts of the polar structure with the inner central nucleus of the system , i.e. this component does not show a completely empty central hole .",
    "the light distribution of the polar structure follows an exponential profile and has a @xmath73 .",
    "these properties suggest that this structure is more similar to a disk rather than a narrow annulus , as already suggested by arnaboldi et al .",
    "( 1997 ) through the analysis of the hi distribution in the polar structure .",
    "furthermore , the hi observations for ngc  4650a showed that the total hi mass in this component is about @xmath72 .",
    "the high resolution hst images indicate that the central spheroidal component is not a standard early - type system .",
    "it has a small exponential bulge and a disk with an exponential profile , which appears slightly warped in the outer regions .",
    "this warp is observed both in the optical and in nir .",
    "the study of the integrated colors of ngc  4650a has shown that polar structure is much bluer than the stellar central component , as it is also visible in the beautiful hst multicolor images .",
    "the comparison with the predicted colors from stellar population synthesis codes suggests a very young age ( @xmath74 gyr ) for the polar structure .",
    "the age of the central component is in the range of @xmath51 to @xmath63 gyr , which is of a significantly younger age than those typical for early - type galaxies .",
    "whatever event may have occurred in the past of ngc  4650a , it has strongly changed the properties of the host galaxy , both in the structure and stellar population , so that this component differs from a standard s0 system .",
    "published simulations of the accretion / stripping scenario were not able to reproduce either these observed properties for the host galaxy in ngc  4650a , or those for the polar structure . in particular , we note the absence of a hole in the center of the polar disk , which has an exponential light distribution and a large amount of hi , which is an order of magnitude larger than what is expected in the accretion models . furthermore , for reasonable mass - to - light ratios ( @xmath75 in the nir , from matthews , van driel and gallagher 1998 ) , the luminous mass ( gas plus stars ) in the polar structure , of about @xmath76 , is comparable with or even higher than the total luminous mass in the host galaxy , of about @xmath77 . in the accretion scenario",
    ", one would expect the accreted baryonic mass ( stellar + gas ) to be a fraction of that in the pre - existing galaxy , and not viceversa , as it is observed for ngc 4650a .",
    "based on these new observational results , we have considered the alternative ideas discussed by bekki according to which the polar ring galaxies , such as ngc  4650a , may have formed from a dissipational merger event of some kind .",
    "the dissipative merger scenario proposed by bekki ( 1998 ) may provide a coherent explanation for the wide and massive polar disk of ngc  4650a and its larger baryonic mass content with respect to the central component , plus the non - standard properties of the light distribution in the central s0-like component .",
    "a future test of bekki s scenario for prg formation should also include a detailed analysis of the kinematics predicted from the n - body simulations and a comparison with prg kinematics , and address the question about the stability of those merger configurations which lead to the formation of a massive disk .",
