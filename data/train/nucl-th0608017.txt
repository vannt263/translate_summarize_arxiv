    "often the problem of calculating long - wavelength nuclear observables  binding energies , radii , or responses to low - momentum probes  is formulated in terms of pointlike , nonrelativistic nucleons interacting through a potential . to solve",
    "this problem theorists have developed both nuclear models , which are not systematically improvable , and exact numerical techniques , such as fermion monte carlo . because the nuclear many - body problem is so difficult ",
    "one must simultaneously deal with anomalously large nn scattering lengths and a potential that has a short - range , strongly repulsive core ",
    "exact approaches are numerically challenging , so far limited to the lighter nuclei within the 1s and lower 1p shells .",
    "the argonne theory group has been one of the main developers of such exact methods @xcite .",
    "however , effective theory ( et ) offers an alternative , a method that limits the numerical difficulty of a calculation by restricting it to a finite hilbert space ( the @xmath0- or  included \"- space ) , while correcting the bare hamiltonian @xmath1 ( and other operators ) for the effects of the @xmath2- or  excluded \"- space .",
    "calculations using the effective hamiltonian @xmath3 within @xmath0 reproduce the results using @xmath1 within @xmath4 , over the domain of overlap .",
    "that is , the effects of @xmath2 on @xmath0-space calculations are absorbed into @xmath5 .",
    "there may exist some systematic expansion  perhaps having to do with the shorter range of interactions in @xmath2  that simplifies the determination @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "one interesting challenge for et is the case of a @xmath0-space basis of harmonic oscillator ( ho ) slater determinants .",
    "this is a special basis for nuclear physics because of center - of - mass separability : if all slater determinants containing up to @xmath6 oscillator quanta are retained , @xmath3 will be translationally invariant ( assuming @xmath1 is ) .",
    "such bases are also important because of powerful shell - model ( sm ) techniques that have been developed for interative diagonalization and for evaluating inclusive responses .",
    "the larger @xmath0 can be made , the smaller the effects of @xmath7 .",
    "there are two common approaches to the et problem .",
    "one is the determination of @xmath5 from a given @xmath1 known throughout @xmath4 , a problem that appears naively to be no less difficult than the original @xmath4 diagonalization of @xmath1 .",
    "however , this may not be the case if @xmath1 is somehow simpler when acting in @xmath2 .",
    "for example , if @xmath2 contains primarily high - momentum ( short - distance ) interactions , then @xmath7 might have a cluster expansion : it becomes increasingly unlikely to have @xmath8 nucleons in close proximity , as @xmath8 increases ( e.g. , a maximum of four nucleons can be in a relative s - state ) . thus one could approximate the full scattering series in @xmath2 by successive two - body , three - body , etc . , terms , with the expectation that this series will converge quickly with increasing nucleon number .",
    "this would explain why simple two - nucleon ladder sums ",
    "g - matrices  have been somewhat successful as effective interactions @xcite ( however , see ref .  ) .",
    "the second approach is that usually taken in effective field theories @xcite , determining @xmath3 phenomenologically .",
    "this is the ",
    "eliminate the middleman \" approach : @xmath1 itself is an effective interaction , parameterized in order to reproduce @xmath9 scattering and other data up to some energy .",
    "so why go to the extra work of this intermediate stage between qcd and sm - like spaces ?",
    "this alternative approach begins with @xmath10 , the long - range @xmath9 interaction that is dominated by pion exchange and constrained by chiral symmetry .",
    "the effects of the omitted @xmath2-space , @xmath5 , might be expressed in some systematic expansion , with the coefficients of that expansion directly determined from data , rather than from any knowledge of @xmath1 acting outside of @xmath0 .    while we explored this second approach some years ago ,",
    "some subtle issues arose , connected with properties of ho bases .",
    "this convinced us that the first step in our program should be solving and thoroughly understanding the effective interactions problem via the first approach , so that we would have answers in hand to test the success of more phenomenological approaches .",
    "thus we proceeded to follow the first approach using a realistic @xmath9 potential , @xmath11 @xcite , generating @xmath3 numerically for the two- and three - body problems in a variety of ho sm spaces . here",
    "i will use these results to show that a properly defined short - range interaction provides an excellent representation of the effective interaction .",
    "this is an encouraging result , one that suggests a purely phenomenological treatment of the effective interaction might succeed .",
    "the key observation is that hobet is an expansion around momenta @xmath12 , and thus differs from eft approaches that expand around @xmath13 .",
    "consequently a hobet @xmath0-space lacks both high - momentum components important to short - range @xmath9 interactions and long - wavelength components important to minimizing the kinetic energy .",
    "while our group has previously discussed some of the consequences of the combined infrared / ultraviolet problem in hobet , here i identify another : a sharp energy dependence in @xmath3 that must be addressed before any simple representation of @xmath7 is possible .",
    "this , combined with a trick to remove operator mixing , leads to a simple and successful short - range expansion for @xmath7 .",
    "i conclude by noting how these results may set the stage for a successful determination of the hobet @xmath3 directly from data .",
    "the basis for the approach described here is the bloch - horowitz ( bh ) equation , which generates a hermitian , energy - dependent effective hamiltonian , @xmath3 , which operates in a finite hilbert space from which high - energy ho slater determinants are omitted : @xmath14 here @xmath1 is the bare hamiltonian and @xmath15 and @xmath16 are the exact eigenvalue and wave function ( that is , the results of a full solution of the schroedinger equation for @xmath1 in @xmath4 ) .",
    "the bh equation must be solved self - consistently , as @xmath3 depends on @xmath15 .",
    "if this is done , the model - space calculation reproduces the exact @xmath15 , and the model - space wave function @xmath17 is simply the restriction of @xmath16 to @xmath0 .",
    "if one takes for @xmath0 a complete set of ho slater determinants with ho energy @xmath18 , @xmath3 will be translational invariant .",
    "@xmath0 is then defined by two parameters , @xmath19 and the ho size parameter @xmath20 .",
    "the bh equation was solved numerically for the @xmath11 potential using two numerical techniques . in work carried out in collaboration with c",
    "song @xcite , calculations were done for the deuteron and @xmath21he/@xmath21h by directly summing the effects of @xmath11 in the @xmath2-space . because this potential has a rather hard core , sums to 140 @xmath22",
    "were required to achieve @xmath23 1 kev accuracy in the deuteron binding energy , and 70 @xmath22 to achieve @xmath23 10 kev accuracies for @xmath21he/@xmath21h . in work carried out with t. luu @xcite ,",
    "such cutoffs were removed by doing momentum - space integrations over all possible excitations .",
    "the results are helpful not only to the goals discussed previously , but also in illustrating general properties of @xmath3 that may not be widely appreciated .",
    "for example , table 1 gives the evolution of the @xmath0-space @xmath21he @xmath11 wave function as a function of increasing @xmath19 for fixed @xmath20 .",
    "@xmath17 evolves simply , with each increment of @xmath19 adding new components to the wave function , while leaving previous components unchanged .",
    "one sees that the probability of residing in the model space grows slowly from its 0@xmath22 value ( 31% ) toward unity .",
    "effective operators are defined by @xmath24 and must be evaluated between wave functions @xmath17 having the nontrivial normalization illustrated in table 1 and determined by @xmath25 the importance of this is illustrated in fig .",
    "1 , where the elastic magnetic responses for deuterium and @xmath21he are first evaluate with exact wave functions @xmath17 but bare operators , then re - evaluated with the appropriate effective operators . bare operators prove a disaster even at intermediate momentum transfers of 2 - 3 f@xmath26 . by using the effective operator and effective wave function appropriate to @xmath19 , the correct result ",
    "the form factor is independent of the choice of @xmath19 ( or @xmath20 )  is obtained , as it must in any correct application of effective theory .",
    "he elastic magnetic form factors evaluated for various @xmath0-spaces with bare operators ( various dashed and dotted lines ) and with the appropriate effective operators ( all results converge to the solid lines).,width=340 ]    the choice of a ho basis excludes not only high - momentum components of wave functions connected with the hard core , but also low - momentum components connected with the proper asymptotic fall - off of the tail of the wave functions .",
    "this combined ultraviolet / infrared problem was first explored by us in connection with the nonperturbative behavior of @xmath3 : the need to simultaneously correct for the missing long- and short - distance behavior of @xmath17 is the reason one can not define a simple @xmath0 that makes evaluation of @xmath3 converge rapidly .",
    "we also found a solution to this problem , a rewriting of the bh equation in which the relative kinetic energy operator is summed to all orders .",
    "this summation can be viewed as a transformation of a subset of the slater determinants in @xmath0 to incorporate the correct asymptotic falloff .",
    "this soft physics , obtained from an infinite sum of high - energy ho states in @xmath2 , is the key to making @xmath3 perturbative .",
    "it turns out this physics is also central to the issue under discussion here , the existence of a simple representation for @xmath27 , where @xmath28 .",

    ", @xmath32 is the identity except when it operates on an @xmath33 with energy @xmath34 or @xmath35 .",
    "we will call these slater determinants the edge states . for nonedge states , this new expression and the bh form given in eq .",
    "( [ wh : eq1 ] ) both reduce to the expressions on the right of eqs .",
    "( [ wh : eq4 ] ) .    noting that the first lhs term in eqs .",
    "( [ wh : eq4 ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath36 we see that the @xmath31 summation can be viewed as a transformation to a new basis for @xmath0 , @xmath37 , that is orthogonal but not orthonormal .",
    "this edge - state basis builds in the proper asymptotic behavior governed by @xmath31 ( free propagation ) and the binding energy @xmath15 .",
    "the transformation preserves translational invariance , as @xmath30 is the relative kinetic energy operator .",
    "viewed in the transformed basis , the appropriate effective interaction in given by the lhs terms in the square brackets in eqs . ( [ wh : eq6 ] ) below .",
    "alternatively , the results can be viewed as two equivalent expressions for the effective interaction between ho states , but with a different division between  bare \" and  rescattering \" contributions @xmath38 { e \\over e - qt}&\\leftrightarrow&h \\nonumber \\\\",
    "\\mathrm{rescattering:}{e \\over e - tq } \\left [ v { 1 \\over e - qh } qv \\right ] { e \\over e - qt}&\\leftrightarrow & h { 1 \\over e - qh } qh \\label{wh : eq6}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] _ it is this new division that is critical . _",
    "the expressions are identical for nonedge states .",
    "but for edge states , only the expression on the left isolates a quantity , @xmath39 , that is short - range and nonperturbative .",
    "we will see that this is the term that can be represented by a simple , systematic expansion .",
    "figure 2 shows the extended tail that is induced by @xmath32 acting on a ho state .",
    "figure 3 is included to emphasize that there are important numerical differences between the two expressions in eqs .",
    "( [ wh : eq6 ] ) .",
    "it compares calculations done for the deuteron using the two  bare \" interactions : thus in both cases @xmath40 enters only linearly between low - momentum states , and all multiple scattering of @xmath40 in @xmath2 in ignored .",
    "figure 3 gives the resulting deuteron binding energy as a function of @xmath20 , for several values of @xmath19 . for the standard form of the bh equation",
    ", a small model space overestimates the kinetic energy ( too confining ) and overestimates short - range contributions to @xmath40 ( too little freedom to create the needed wave - function  hole \" ) .",
    "making @xmath20 larger to lower the kinetic energy exacerbates the short - range problem , and conversely .",
    "thus the best @xmath20 is a poor compromise that , even in a 10 @xmath22 bare calculation , fails to bind the deuteron .",

    "( [ wh : eq6 ] ) sums @xmath31 to give the correct wave - function behavior at large @xmath41 , independent of @xmath20 .",

    "note that the normalization of the extended state has been adjusted to match that of @xmath47 at @xmath41=0 , in order to show that the shapes differ only at large @xmath41 .",

    "now i turn to the question of whether ( and how ) the @xmath2-space rescattering contribution to @xmath3 might be expressed through some systematic short - range expansion .",
    "there are two steps important in applying such an expansion to hobet .",
    "one has to do with the form of the short - range expansion .",
    "a contact - gradient ( cg ) expansion , constructed to include all possible lo ( leading order ) , nlo ( next - to - leading order ) , nnlo ( next - to - next - to - leading order ) , ... , interactions is commonly used , @xmath49    because hobet is an expansion around a typical momentum scale @xmath50 , rather than around @xmath51 , it is helpful to redefine the derivatives appearing in the cg expansion noting @xmath52 we demand by analogy in hobet @xmath53 this can be accomplished by redefining the operators @xmath54 of eqs .",
    "( [ wh : eq5 ] ) by @xmath55    the gradients in eq .",
    "( [ wh : eq5 ] ) then act on polynomials in @xmath41 , a choice that removes all operator mixing .",
    "that is , if @xmath56 is fixed in lo to the @xmath57 to @xmath57 matrix element , where @xmath6 is the nodal quantum number , it remains fixed in nlo , nnlo , etc .",
    "furthermore , the expansion is in nodal quantum numbers , e.g. , @xmath58 so that matrix elements become trivial to evaluate in any order .",
    "it can be shown that the leading order in @xmath6 contribution agrees with the plane - wave result , and that operator coefficients are a generalization of standard talmi integrals for nonlocal potentials , e.g. , @xmath59    the next step is to identify that quantity in the bh equation that should be identified with the cg expansion .",
    "this has to do with the two forms of the bh equation discussed previously .",
    "consider the process of progressively integrating out @xmath2 in favor of the cg expansion , beginning at @xmath60 and progressing to @xmath61 .",
    "using the projection operator @xmath62 we can isolate the contributions , above some scale @xmath63 , to the two bh rescattering terms of eqs .",
    "( [ wh : eq6 ] ) @xmath64 { e \\over e - qt}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the goal of a cg expansion might be successful reproduction of the matrix elements of @xmath65  the @xmath2-space rescattering contributions for the standard form of the bh equation  as @xmath66 .",
    "this would allow us to replace all @xmath2-space rescattering by a systematic short - range expansion , opening the door to a purely phenomenological determination of @xmath3 for the sm .",
    "the test case will be an 8@xmath22 @xmath0-space calculation for the deuteron ( @xmath67 = 8 , @xmath20=1.7 f ) .",
    "the running of the 15 independent @xmath21s@xmath68 matrix elements of @xmath65 are plottted in fig .",
    "five of these are distinguished because they involve an edge - state bra or ket ( or both ) .",
    "the evolution of these contributions with @xmath63 is seen to be somewhat less regular than that of nonedge - state matrix elements .",
    "the results for @xmath61 show that rescattering is responsible for typically 12 mev of binding energy .",
    "the cg fit to the results in fig .",
    "4a were done in lo , nlo , and nnlo as a function of @xmath63 , using the standard form of the bh equation .",
    "the coefficients are fit to the lowest - energy matrix elements .",
    "thus in lo @xmath69 is fixed by the @xmath70 matrix element , leaving 14 unconstrained matrix elements ; the nnlo fit ( @xmath71 , @xmath72 , @xmath73 , and @xmath74 ) leaves 11 matrix elements unconstrained .",
    "this is easily done , because the operators do not mix ; e.g. , among these four , only the @xmath73 matrix element is influenced by @xmath75 .",
    "the result is a set of coefficient that run as a function of @xmath63 in the usual way , with @xmath56 small and dominant for large @xmath63 , and with the nlo and nnlo terms turning on as the scale is dropped .",
    "4b - d show the residuals  the differences between the predicted and calculated matrix elements .",
    "for non - edge - state matrix elements the scale at which typical residuals in @xmath76 are significant , say greater than 100 kev ( above @xmath23 1% ) , is brought down successively , e.g. , from @xmath77 , to @xmath78 ( lo ) , to @xmath79 ( nlo ) , and finally to @xmath80 ( nnlo ) . but",
    "matrix elements involving edge states break this pattern : the improvement is not significant , with noticeable deviations remaining at @xmath77 even at nnlo .     due to excitations in @xmath2 above @xmath63",
    "are given for the standard form of the bh equation .",

    "matrix elements with bra or ket ( dashed ) or both ( dot - dashed ) edge states are seen not to improve systematically.,width=453 ]    this failure could be anticipated : because @xmath31 strongly couples nearest shells across the @xmath81 boundary , @xmath82 contains long - range physics .",
    "the candidate short - range interaction is @xmath83 , not @xmath82 : this is the reason @xmath31 should be first summed , putting the bh equation in a form  the lhs of eqs .",
    "( [ wh : eq6 ] )  that isolates this quantity .",

    "-summed reorganization of the bh equation , as described in the text.,width=453 ]    figs .",
    "5 shows the results : the difficulties encountered for @xmath65 do not arise for @xmath89 .",
    "the edge - state matrix elements are now well behaved , and the improvement from lo to nlo to nnlo is systematic in all cases . when @xmath66 , the cg potential continues to reproduce @xmath3 for the @xmath11 potential remarkably well , with an the average error in @xmath21s@xmath68 nnlo matrix elements of about 100 kev ( or 1% accuracy ) .",
    "other channels we explored behaved even better : the average error for the 15 @xmath90s@xmath91 matrix elements is about 10 kev ( or 0.1% accuracy ) . because all matrix elements of @xmath3 are reproduced well , the cg potential preserves spectral properties , not simply properties of the lowest energy states within @xmath0 .",
    "the nnlo calculation in the @xmath21s@xmath68-@xmath21d@xmath68 channel yields a deuteron ground - state energy of -2.21 mev .",
    "several points can be made : + @xmath92 the net effect of the @xmath31 summation is to weaken the cg potential for ho edge states : the resulting , more extended state has a reduced probability at small @xmath41 .",
    "consequently the effects of @xmath43 are weaker than in states immune from the effects of @xmath31 .",
    "+ @xmath92 the very strong @xmath31 coupling of the @xmath0 and @xmath2 spaces is clearly problematic for an et : small changes in energy denominators alter the induced interactions .",
    "thus it is quite reasonable that removal of this coupling leads to a strong energy dependence in the effective interaction between ho states .",
    "i believe that proper treatment of this energy dependence will be crucial to a correct description of the bound - state spectrum in the ho sm .",
    "+ @xmath92 this process can also be viewed as a transformation to a new , orthogonal ( but not normalized ) basis for @xmath0 in which @xmath93 .",
    "this yields basis states with the proper asymptotic behavior for each channel .",
    "a cg expansion with fixed coefficients can be used between these states , following the reorganized bh equation of eqs .",
    "( [ wh : eq4 ] ) .",
    "+ @xmath92 while our calculations have been limited to the deuteron , this same phenomena must arise in heavier systems treated in ho bases ",
    "@xmath31 remains the ladder operator . as",
    "the issue is extended states that minimize the kinetic energy , it is clear that the relevant parameter must be the jacobi coordinate associated with the lowest breakup channel .",
    "this could be an issue for treatments of @xmath3 based on the lee - suzuki transformation , which transforms the interaction into an energy - independent one . in approaches like the no - core shell model @xcite , the lee - suzuki transformation is generally not evaluated exactly , but instead only at the two - body level .",
    "if such an approach were applied , for example , to @xmath94li , a system weakly bound ( 1.475 mev ) to breaking up as @xmath95+d , it is not obvious that a two - body lee - suzuki transformation would treat the relevant jacobi coordinate responsible for the dominant energy dependence .",
    "this should be explored .",
    "+ @xmath92 i believe the conclusions about the cg expansion will apply to other effective interactions .",
    "for example , v - low - k @xcite , a soft potential obtained by integrating out high - momentum states , is derived in a plane - wave basis , where @xmath30 is diagonal .",
    "thus it should be analogous to our cg interaction , requiring a similar renormalization when embedded into a ho sm space",
    ". it would be interesting to test this conclusion .",
    "these results show that the effective interaction in the ho sm must have a very sharp dependence on the binding energy , defined as the energy of the bound state relative to the first open channel .",
    "this is typically 0 to 10 mev for the bound states of most nuclei ( and 2.22 mev for the deuteron ground state explored here ) .",
    "once this energy dependence is identified , the set of effective interaction matrix elements can be represented quite well by a cg expansion , and the results for successive lo , nlo , and nnlo calculations improve systematically .",
    "this result suggests that the explicit energy dependence of the bh equation is almost entirely due to @xmath31  though this inference , based on the behavior of matrix elements between states with different number of ho quanta , must be tested in a case where multiple bound states exist .",
    "we also presented a simple redefinition of the gradients associated with cg expansions , viewing the expansion as one around a momentum scale @xmath96 .",
    "this definition removes operator mixing , making nnlo and higher - order fits very simple .",
    "the expansion then becomes one in nodal quantum numbers , with the coefficients of the expansion related to talmi integrals , generalized for nonlocal interactions .",
    "while our exploration here has been based on  data \" obtained from an exact bh calculation of the effective interaction for the @xmath11 potential , this raises the question , is such a potential necessary to the sm ? that is , now that the success of an nnlo description of @xmath2-space contributions is established , could one start with @xmath10 and determine the coefficients for such a potential directly from data , without knowledge of matrix elements of @xmath1 outside of @xmath0 ?",
    "i believe the answer is yes , even in cases ( like the deuteron ) when insufficient information is available from bound states .",
    "it turns out that the techniques described here can be extended into the continuum , so that observables like phase shifts could be combined with bound - state information to determine the coefficients of such an expansion .",
