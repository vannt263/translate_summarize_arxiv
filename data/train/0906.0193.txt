    "in the case of the liquid - gas critical point , gravitational effects become important as the isothermal compressibility ( i.e. the susceptibility ) increases to a large value in the vicinity of that point and , indeed , diverges as that point is approached .",

    ", one must develop models that incorporate the effects of gravity .",
    "a number of theoretical studies have been performed on the effect of gravity on measurements near the superfluid transition in @xmath1he .",
    "models of the @xmath1he specific heat in bulk and finite - size samples near the superfluid transition have been successfully tested by high precision measurements in ground - based laboratories @xcite and in microgravity @xcite .    in a previous article @xcite ,",
    "the authors of this paper reported the results of a theoretical calculation of the expected finite - size effects on the isothermal susceptibility near a liquid - gas critical point in a zero gravity environment .",
    "that investigation was performed for a thin film between surfaces that both strongly prefer the liquid phase .",
    "it is hoped that predictions of this study will be tested by future experimental studies in space @xcite . in the present paper , we extend those calculations including the effects of gravity .",
    "the @xmath0he and @xmath1he liquid - gas critical points were chosen for this theoretical investigation because these systems are devoid of impurities and many bulk thermophysical properties have been measured near their liquid - gas critical point .    in this article",
    "we will discuss the behavior of the susceptibility of a film of a non - polar fluid of , say , @xmath0he or @xmath1he , having a thickness @xmath5 in which the intrinsic interaction @xmath6 is of the van der waals type , decaying with distance @xmath7 between the molecules of the fluid as @xmath8 . here",

    "when @xmath35 this universality class is characterized by critical exponents @xcite @xmath36 and @xmath37 as we have already stressed , the methods and ideas to determine the behavior of the susceptibility if thin films of non - polar fluids used in the current article are general and can , in principle , be applied to any non - polar fluid ; however , but we will exemplify these methods via the study of @xmath0he and @xmath1he films .",
    "a central question pertains to the extent to which the critical exponents listed above describe the experimentally observed behavior of these substances near their respective liquid - vapour critical points . in the early years of the development of critical behavior",
    ", there were attempts to experimentally measure the critical exponents of the he isotopes to be compared with theoretically predicted values ; see , e.g. , @xcite",
    ". however , it became clear that the asymptotic power - law region is very limited in ground - based measurements and accurate analyses must take into account correction - to - scaling terms as well as gravity effects ; see , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "these issues are particularly important in the case of the he isotopes , which have the largest gravity effect ( see , e.g. , the discussion of table i in @xcite ) . because of these problems , most recent experimental measurements , particularly those in the he isotopes , have been compared to models using the theoretical critical parameters obtained from those models ; see@xcite . in light of this history , we will utilize theoretically derived values of the relevant critical exponents .    from ( [ omegasdef ] ) and with @xmath38 , as in physical van der waals interactions , one has @xmath39 and @xmath40 . since @xmath41 , for @xmath5 _ large enough _ , one can expand the r.h.s . of eq .",

    "note that this criterion also connects the relevance of gravity to the thickness @xmath5 of the films ; for thin films it is negligible , while in the case of sufficiently thick films it is not . in the case of @xmath0he and @xmath1he we will discover that films with @xmath51 or @xmath52 liquid layers are , in this sense , thin films , while a film with , say , @xmath53 layers , can be considered thick for the purposes of assessing the influence of gravity on critical point behavior .    in this article",
    "we discuss the finite - size behavior of the susceptibility of van der waals fluid films bounded by two flat substrate plates situated perpendicular to the earth s gravitational field ( i.e. horizontal ) , both of which strongly prefer the liquid phase of the system .",

    "the larger @xmath5 and @xmath25 , the stronger this effect .",
    "thus , for @xmath5 large enough ( see the case with @xmath61 ) the critical point of the finite system lies above the @xmath67 line , i.e. at @xmath68 , which stabilizes the liquid phase of the fluid .",
