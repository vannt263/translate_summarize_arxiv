    "we investigate the black hole mass - bulge velocity dispersion relation with the eight co - detected z@xmath06 quasars in figure 8 .",
    "the supermassive black hole mass ( @xmath10 ) and bulge velocity dispersion ( @xmath11 ) in local galaxies follow a relationship of @xmath207 ( tremaine et al .",
    "we first roughly estimate @xmath11 for the eight z@xmath06 quasars with the co line widths , using the empirical relation @xmath208 ( shields et al . 2006 ; nelson et al .",
    "the results are plotted in figure 8 , together with the local active and inactive galaxies from tremaine et al .",
    "( 2002 ) and co - detected @xmath3 quasars that have available smbh mass measurements ( shields et al .",
    "2006 ; coppin et al .",
    "most of the high - z co - detected quasars , especially the objects with @xmath209 , are above the local @xmath210 relationship with offsets of more than one order of magnitude in black hole mass , as was found in shields et al .",
    "the median value of the ratios between @xmath10 and the expected black hole masses from the local @xmath10@xmath14 relation ( @xmath211 ) for our z@xmath06 sample is @xmath212 .",
    "this is consistent with the high @xmath192 ratios and the idea of prior smbh formations we discussed in the previous section (  5.2.1 ) .",
    "however , the systemic offset between the high - z objects and the local @xmath210 relation ( i.e. @xmath213 ) can be reduced if we include assumptions of inclination angles in our estimations of @xmath42 , following the empirical correlations between @xmath42 and inclination angle - corrected co line width from the literature ( eg . ho 2007a , 2007b , wu 2007 ) .",
    "in particular , if we consider the possible gas disk inclination angle range for these z@xmath06 quasars and adopt an average value of @xmath214 ( as was discussed in  5.2.1 ) , the derived @xmath213 will reduce to @xmath026 and 4 following the methods described in wu ( 2007 ) and ho ( 2007a ) , respectively .",
    "we also notice that our sample exhibits significant scatter on the @xmath10@xmath14 plot with derived @xmath215 values over three orders of magnitude .",
    "this is mainly due to the intrinsic scatter and offset between the real bulge velocity dispersions and the co estimated values based on the empirical relationships of low - z samples .",
    "indeed , how the observed co line widths trace the bulge velocity dispersions in the high - z co - detected quasars is still an open question .",
    "these objects are the most massive smbh - host systems in the universe with smbh masses of a few @xmath216 to @xmath1 and experiencing massive star formation in the central kpc scale regions ( walter et al .",
    ". we will expect the sensitive interferometer arrays ( such as alma and the evla ) to directly probe the gas properties e.g. , the gas distribution , geometry , dynamics ( virialized or not ) , line profiles , and contributions from turbulence , etc .",
    "in their spheroidal hosts and finally address the @xmath210 correlation in these high - z fir and co luminous quasars .",
    "we present new observations of molecular co line emission and 350 @xmath27 m dust continuum emission in quasar host galaxies at z@xmath06 .",
    "our most important finding is that high - order co transitions are detected in all six of the z@xmath06 quasars observed with the 3 mm receiver on the pdbi .",
    "the new co detections all have observed 250 ghz dust continuum flux densities of @xmath18 .",
    "these results , together with previous co - detections in another two objects , reveal an extremely high co detection rate in the fir luminous quasars at z@xmath06 . with the final sample of eight co - detected z@xmath06 quasars , we study the molecular gas properties in the earliest quasar host galaxies , and the main results",
    "are summarized as follows :    the co emission indicates molecular gas masses of 0.7 to @xmath136 in the quasar host galaxies .",
    "the observed co line widths are spread over a wide range from @xmath217 to @xmath139 , with a median value of about @xmath140 .",
    "the gas mass and co line width distributions of the z@xmath06 quasars are consistent with samples of co - observed smgs and quasars at @xmath3 .",
    "the co and fir luminosities of the eight z@xmath06 quasars follow the @xmath161 relationship derived for local spirals , lirgs , ulirgs , high - z smgs , and co - detected quasars , though the weakest co detection has the largest offset from the trend .",
    "this is consistent with the idea of co - eval star formation with rapid growth of the supermassive black hole in the early quasar - host systems .",
    "the derived sfrs are from @xmath166 to @xmath167 .",
    "the corresponding star formation efficiencies indicated by the ratios of @xmath218 are consistent with the extreme starburst systems at low and high redshifts .",
    "we investigate the black hole - bulge correlations of these fir and co luminous quasars at z@xmath06 using the co measurements .",
    "based on certain assumptions of the molecular gas disk size , average inclination angle , and @xmath42-co line width relation , we estimate the bulge dynamical masses and velocity dispersions for our sample and compare them to the local black hole - bulge relationships .",
    "the results suggest that the black hole masses of these z@xmath06 quasars are typically an order of magnitude higher than the values expected from the present - day relationships , which is consistent with the idea that the formation of the smbhs occurs prior to that of the stellar bulges in the massive high - z quasar - galaxy systems .",
    "however , we also recognize that there are large uncertainties in the estimations of @xmath178 and @xmath11 for individual objects due to unknown gas distribution , disk inclination , and dynamics .",
    "further high - resolution observations of quasar host galaxies should focus on these fir and co luminous z@xmath06 quasars to fully understand the black hole - bulge evolution at the highest redshift .",

    "<S> we report our new observations of redshifted carbon monoxide emission from six z@xmath06 quasars , using the iram plateau de bure interferometer . </S>",
    "<S> co ( 6 - 5 ) or ( 5 - 4 ) line emission was detected in all six sources . together with two other previous co detections , these observations provide unique constraints on the molecular gas emission properties in these quasar systems close to the end of the cosmic reionization . </S>",
    "<S> complementary results are also presented for low - j co lines observed at the green bank telescope and the very large array , and dust continuum from five of these sources with the sharc - ii bolometer camera at the caltech submillimeter observatory . </S>",
    "<S> we then present a study of the molecular gas properties in our combined sample of eight co - detected quasars at z@xmath06 . </S>",
    "<S> the detections of high - order co line emission in these objects indicates the presence of highly excited molecular gas , with estimated masses on the order of @xmath1 within the quasar host galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> no significant difference is found in the gas mass and co line width distributions between our @xmath2 quasars and samples of co - detected @xmath3 quasars and submillimeter galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> most of the co - detected quasars at z@xmath06 follow the far infrared - co luminosity relationship defined by actively star - forming galaxies at low and high redshifts . </S>",
    "<S> this suggests that ongoing star formation in their hosts contributes significantly to the dust heating at fir wavelengths . </S>",
    "<S> the result is consistent with the picture of galaxy formation co - eval with supermassive black hole ( smbh ) accretion in the earliest quasar - host systems . </S>",
    "<S> we investigate the black hole  bulge relationships of our quasar sample , using the co dynamics as a tracer for the dynamical mass of the quasar host . </S>",
    "<S> the median estimated black hole - bulge mass ratio is about fifteen times higher than the present - day value of @xmath00.0014 . </S>",
    "<S> this places important constraints on the formation and evolution of the most massive smbh - spheroidal host systems at the highest redshift . </S>"
