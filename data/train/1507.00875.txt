    "strong interactions in the standard model are described by quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) , which is supposed to describe a vast array of phenomena , from gluon and quark interactions at the highest energies achievable with the large hadron collider to the nature of nuclear material at the core of a compact star .",
    "this last challenge initiated the quest to uncover the equation of state ( eos ) for superdense nuclear matter @xcite .",
    "the intervening years have seen remarkable activity , highlighted by the discovery of a new state of matter , _ viz_.  a strongly - coupled quark - gluon plasma ( sqgp ) @xcite .",
    "these efforts have delivered a sketch of the qcd eos in the plane spanned by baryon chemical potential ( @xmath1 ) and temperature ( @xmath2 ) @xcite .    in vacuum , _",
    "i.e_.  in the neighbourhood @xmath3 , qcd exists in a phase characterised by two emergent phenomena : confinement and dynamical chiral symmetry breaking ( dcsb ) .",
    "confinement is most simply defined empirically : those degrees - of - freedom used in defining the qcd lagrangian  gluons and quarks  do not exist as asymptotic states .",
    "the forces responsible for confinement appear to generate more than 98% of the mass of visible matter @xcite .",
    "this phenomenon is known as dcsb .",
    "it is a quantum field theoretical effect , which is expressed and explained via the appearance of momentum - dependent mass - functions for quarks @xcite and gluons @xcite even in the absence of any higgs - like mechanism .    on the other hand , in medium , _",
    "i.e_.  as @xmath1 and/or @xmath2 are increased beyond certain critical values , the property of asymptotic freedom @xcite suggests that qcd undergoes phase transitions . in the new phases",
    ", dcsb disappears and/or gluons and quarks are deconfined .",
    "indeed , the possibility that the transitions are related and coincident in the @xmath4-plane is much discussed .",
    "the qcd eos and related thermal properties are important for numerous reasons @xcite , _",
    "e.g_.they are crucial inputs to the hydrodynamic simulations used to connect basic theoretical predictions with modern experimental data . in this context , the current sketches are not adequate : a better picture is needed in order to understand the data and hence the qualities of a sqgp .",
    "the @xmath5 properties of qcd have been scrutinised via simulations of the lattice - regularised theory ( lqcd ) .",
    "this is apparent , _",
    "e.g_.  in refs.@xcite , which also highlight problems impeding the extension of lattice methods to @xmath6 . at this stage",
    ", a picture of the phase diagram in the entire @xmath4-plane requires other methods , so models continue to be employed widely .",
    "however , they are numerous in number and various in formulation , and too often provide conflicting predictions @xcite . herein , therefore , we analyse aspects of the thermal properties of qcd using methods of continuum quantum field theory ; namely , the dyson - schwinger equations ( dses ) @xcite .",
    "we focus on the matter sector of qcd and hence begin with the quark gap equation :    [ eqgap ] @xmath7    where @xmath8 is the current - quark bare - mass ; @xmath9 , @xmath10 is the quark matsubara frequency and @xmath11 is the quark chemical potential ( @xmath12 ) , @xmath13 ; @xmath14 is the dressed - gluon propagator ; and @xmath15 the dressed - quark - gluon vertex . the kernel of eq .",
    "is determined by the quark - gluon vertex and the gluon propagator .",
    "we use @xmath16 , which defines rainbow - ladder ( rl ) truncation , _",
    "i.e_.  the leading - order in the most widely used symmetry - preserving dse approximation scheme @xcite , which is accurate for ground - state light - quark hadrons @xcite .",
    "it is appropriate here because whilst a certain class of vertex improvements can influence critical exponents associated with second order transitions , _",
    "viz_.  those leading to inclusion of long - range colour - singlet correlations @xcite , no form available today alters the order of a transition or has a material impact on its location @xcite .",
    "the gluon propagator in eq . has the general form @xmath17 where @xmath18 are , respectively , @xmath19 transverse and longitudinal projection operators , and @xmath20 ; @xmath21 , @xmath22 , where @xmath23)$ ] describes a gluon screening mass , the value of which is determined from leading - order perturbative qcd @xcite ; and ( @xmath24 ) @xcite @xmath25 } \\ ,   \\ , , \\ ] ] with @xmath26 , @xmath27gev , @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30gev .",

    "support a reliable in - vacuum description of ground - state hadrons in rl truncation @xcite .",
    "( _ n.b_.  by using landau gauge we minimise sensitvity to truncation - induced violations of gauge covariance @xcite . )",
    "the in - medium extension of the gap equation s kernel , eq . , preserves agreement with qcd at large momenta .",
    "however , in assuming that @xmath34 is @xmath0-independent it overlooks screening of the interaction s infrared strength .",
    "we remedy that by writing @xcite @xmath35\\rule{0ex}{2.5ex}}\\ , , &   t \\ge t_{\\text{p } } \\ , , \\end{array } \\right .",

    "naturally , @xmath43 : we set @xmath44 at @xmath45 , ensuring @xmath46 by evolving the value of @xmath47 .    in rl truncation and stationary phase approximation , the dressed - quark pressure density is @xcite : @xmath48=t \\ln{z}=-t ( { \\rm tr}\\ln{[t s]}+\\tfrac{1}{2}tr[\\sigma s ] ) \\ , , \\ ] ] where eq",
    ". determines @xmath49 , @xmath50 . at each @xmath0 , eq .",
    "possesses the same ultraviolet divergence , which may be eliminated by subtracting the @xmath51 result .",
    "the subtraction can be accomplished by recalling that for any function @xmath52 , compatible with a physical system , @xcite : @xmath53 where we have omitted a @xmath2-independent term that is zero so long as @xmath54 , and @xmath55 with @xmath56 , @xmath57 .",
    "the first term on the right - hand - side of eq . is responsible for the divergence we wish to eliminate",
    ". the physical piece of the dressed - quark pressure can thus be calculated as the difference between the two terms in the first line of eq .",
    ", with @xmath52 computed via the functional expression in eq .. practically , one proceeds as follows : solve the gap equation at a given @xmath0-pair for a large number of matsubara frequencies , characterised by @xmath58 ; at each @xmath11 , obtain smooth interpolations in `` @xmath59 '' for the scalar functions obtained thereby , eq . ;",
    "evaluate @xmath60 $ ] with these inputs ; and then compute the difference between the sum and integral , verifying that it is insensitive to the interpolation procedure and choice of @xmath58 . that this procedure can work",
    "effectively is illustrated in fig.[freepressure ] , which displays a comparison of our numerical result for the free - quark pressure with the analytic form .",
    "points  numerical result for the free - quark pressure obtained as described in connection with eq . ; and solid ( red ) curve  analytical result.,scaledwidth=40.0% ]    our approximation for the dressed - quark contribution to the qcd eos is now defined .",
    "using the pressure , one can define the _ trace _ _ anomaly _ :",
    "@xmath61 , where the energy density @xmath62 and @xmath63/\\partial t$ ] is the entropy density .",
    "notably , @xmath64 for an noninteracting ultrarelativistic gas , which is described by @xmath65 ; and hence @xmath66 is a measure of the interaction energy stored in the system .",
    "now , since the confined dressed - quark contribution to the physical pressure must vanish on @xmath67 , it follows that @xmath66 exhibits a maximum at some @xmath68 , the value of which serves to define a useful reference temperature .",
    "we employ the dses because they possess the capacity to study confinement and dcsb simultaneously in the continuum @xcite . within this framework",
    "the @xmath69 eos has only been computed using a very simple description of qcd s gauge sector @xcite .",
    "owing to the importance of the eos in developing a complete picture of the standard model , it is imperative to do better .",

    "the temperature is expressed in units of the appropriate value of @xmath68 . the value of @xmath68 exhibits modest variation between the calculations : in our case @xmath73gev ; which is roughly 30% smaller than found in modern lqcd studies owing to our omission of the gluon contribution . additionally , each computation in fig.[fig : trace ] is normalised by the appropriate form of @xmath72 : represented in this way , there is qualitative agreement between all results .",
    "our prediction describes the quark - only contribution to @xmath66 .",
    "it matches the lqcd results in shape and order of magnitude .",
    "these observations indicate both that the gluon and quark contributions to the total interaction energy behave similarly and that they are commensurate in size when measured against their respective asymptotic contributions to the pressure .    , where @xmath74 is the sound velocity in the system .",

    "it is a crucial factor in determining the flow of material in the system , _",
    "i.e_.  its transport properties .",
    "as evident in fig.[fig : soundspeed ] , our prediction for the sound velocity in the dressed - quark subcomponent is similar to results obtained in lqcd for the velocity in the complete system .",
    "a feature which distinguishes our framework from lqcd is its ability to treat @xmath76 without further approximation .",
    "thus , in fig.[fig : full ] we display results for the dressed - quark pressure and trace anomaly at a range of values of @xmath76 : whilst increasing @xmath11 produces an increase in the pressure at all values of temperature , it only materially increases the interaction energy on @xmath77 .",

    ", @xmath78 is a monotonic function of @xmath2 for small @xmath11 , and @xmath78 and @xmath66 are smooth ; but qualitative changes occur at @xmath79gev : a peak appears in @xmath78 and that in @xmath66 becomes sharper .",
    "both functions remain smooth , however , until @xmath80gev , whereat the first derivative of each diverges at @xmath81gev , signalling that the transition has become first - order .",
    "this effect locates the critical endpoint ( cep ) for the chiral symmetry restoring transition at @xmath82gev .",
    "the behaviour of both @xmath78 and @xmath66 on @xmath83 is consistent with hard thermal loop perturbation theory @xcite .",
    "we now draw the diagrams associated with qcd s phase transitions as determined from the dressed - quark pressure .",
    "chiral symmetry restoration is straightforward .",

    "we consider confinement as a violation of reflection positivity by coloured schwinger functions .",
    "this associates it with dynamically - driven changes in the analytic structure of qcd s propagators and vertices @xcite that occur because both gluons and quarks acquire running mass distributions , which are large at infrared momenta .",
    "this leads to the emergence of a length - scale @xmath85fm , whose existence and size is evident in all continuum and lqcd studies of dressed - gluons and -quarks : @xmath86 characterises the material change in their analytic structure @xcite .",
    "from this perspective , deconfinement occurs when @xmath87 and reflection positivity is thus recovered .",
    "this criterion has been used effectively in dense - hot qcd ( _ e.g_.  refs.@xcite ; and we employ it herein , following a local implementation elucidated in refs.@xcite .",
    "we display the phase diagram computed from the dressed - quark pressure in fig.[fig : phase ] .",
    "comparison with fig.3 in ref.@xcite shows that our improved dse kernel , which agrees with the one - loop qcd renormalisation group , does not qualitatively alter the phase diagram .",

    "the solid and dashed curves coincide and cep@xmath100cep@xmath101 : chiral symmetry restoration and deconfinement are coincident ; but the dislocation at @xmath102 entails the existence of a small domain wherein quarks are deconfined but chiral symmetry is broken .",

    "pockets of nambu phase material in this subset of the phase coexistence region possess that character . in the domain of @xmath0 enclosed between the axes and the dashed and dotted curves ,",

    "these are the critical exponents of a mean - field transition , which is the nature of rl truncation .",
    "we introduced a practical procedure for computing the @xmath0-dependent dressed - quark pressure in continuum qcd , which we illustrated using a gap equation whose solutions are key to a successful description of the properties of ground - state hadrons in - vacuum . without further approximation ,",
    "the associated richly - structured phase diagram in the @xmath0-plane was computed .",
    "we drew the transition lines for deconfinement and chiral symmetry restoration , and confirmed that these transition are identical in the chiral limit .",
    "likewise , we calculated the speed of sound in the system and provided the @xmath0-dependence of the trace anomaly , latent - heat and heat - capacity densities . where comparisons are possible , our predictions are consistent with results from lattice qcd .",
    "notably , predictions obtained from the dressed - quark pressure are qualitatively equivalent to those computed using the complete pressure , which suggests that the dressed - quark pressure alone can be used as a practical guide to some of qcd s thermal properties .",
