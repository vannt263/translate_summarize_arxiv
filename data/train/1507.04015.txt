    "one of the key disputes that had to be settled when the modern formulation of mechanics was being constructed was whether friction had a primary or secondary role .",
    "a hard - won step forward was made with the recognition that the inertia principle ( momentum in a system can only be changed through an interaction with its surroundings ) is fundamental , and not the `` friction principle '' ( that systems naturally and continuously slow down unless acted upon by their surroundings ) . that the `` friction principle '' seems",
    "to be so naturally confirmed by everyday experience is one of the big challenges in teaching the inertia principle , and is the source of many naive pre- and mis - conceptions on the part of students .",
    "so , it is no small victory when a student builds sufficient mastery with newtonian ideas to successfully solve the usual spectrum of problems set in a first - semester mechanics course . the pedagogical problem",
    "i wish to explore here is a common one in these courses ( both at the high school and university level ) .",
    "the coulomb model of dry friction is simple enough to state , and while the coulombic kinetic friction is fraught with its own set of pitfalls for students @xcite , the _ static _ coulomb friction approximation is ( in my experience ) even more tangled with students conceptual difficulties .",
    "indeed , the static coulomb friction approximation puts an upper limit on a quantity that students have to work extraordinarily hard to convince themselves _ even exists_. this paper is ( yet one more @xcite ) attempt to give students a sense of what this maximum force means , and why the angle of repose is a good measure of the static coefficient of friction , and to put this pedagogical tool into the hands of instructors .",
    "an elementary problem will illustrate the conceptual problem that i encounter all too often in my own first - semester mechanics course . the situation is shown in figure  [ figure1 ] .",
    "rolls without slipping on a surface with static coeficient of friction @xmath0 . ]    a uniform cylinder of radius r is placed on a ramp inclined from the horizontal at an angle @xmath1 .",
    "the coefficient of static friction and kinetic friction , @xmath0 and @xmath2 are given .",
    "assuming that the object rolls without slipping , _ what is its acceleration down the ramp _ ?",
    "taking the @xmath3-axis as going down the ramp , and the @xmath4 axis as normal to the ramp .",
    "a good student will generate the following from newton s second law : @xmath5 and @xmath6 the first is the resolution of the weight and friction force in the @xmath3-direction as being the explanation for the @xmath3-component of the acceleration of the disc , and the second is a really quite sophisticated statement that the constraint normal force @xmath7 will take _ whatever value is required _ so that the observed motion ( @xmath8 ) is maintained . at this point , there are three unknowns in the problem , @xmath9 and @xmath7 , and it is all too tempting to close the set of equations with the statement of coulomb kinetic friction - because the disc is _ moving _ : @xmath10 this is , of course , an excellent solution to a completely different problem , not the one at hand . for",
    ", the resulting ( incorrect ) acceleration is just that of an object sliding down a incline : @xmath11 but , this is completely unsatisfactory , and i attempt to guide students to discover why this is a bad solution from a skeptical review of the result .",
    "for instance , we could easily choose @xmath12 so that the `` acceleration '' would vanish .",
    "thus , at this `` magic '' angle , a disc placed at rest on such a surface would remain in equilibrium - defying every experience every student has had with objects rolling down hill .",
    "we can make @xmath13 small , but it is very hard to imagine how it can be made to vanish at finite @xmath1 ... or even become negative !    the resolution is trivial for an instructor , of course .",
    "we have not even used the `` rolling without slipping '' constraint , and the critical role the moment of inertia of the disc plays in the physics has not been established . in fact , the friction force is determined by the rolling without slipping constraint : if @xmath14 were too big ( small ) , the disc would over ( under ) rotate , and the point of contact between the disc and the ramp would slide .",
    "the correct analysis eventually leads to @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the moment of inertia of the disc and @xmath17 ensuring that the friction force stays below its maximal value .    and ,",
    "while this is indeed a trivial problem that we expect any well - trained student to be able to solve , there is still the slightly ( to me ) unsatisfactory and qualitative difference between the kinetic friction force ( which has a given magnitude proportional to the loading of the surfaces ) and the static friction force ( which has the character of a constraint force ) with its mysterious maximal value . as a student , the idea that the kinetic friction force was the result of asperities on each surface interacting was convincing and suggestive .",
    "what , however , is being `` broken '' in the static friction force ?",
    "dry welding of asperities , or adhesion of the surfaces , or any other number of phenomenon are called to mind as at least a metaphor for coulomb dry static friction .",
    "while dry friction is far too complex a phenomenon to explain with a simple geometric theory , i can explain its general features in a pedagogical and geometric toy model .",
    "before anyone mucks around with modeling surface interactions with friction , we introduce the physicist s toy model of the `` frictionless '' surface , and we train students quite well in how to analyze systems built from these imaginary surfaces .",
    "consider the symmetric wedge of mass @xmath18 and bottom angle @xmath19 resting on a conforming frictionless surface , as in figure  [ figure2 ]",
    ".     is resting on a conforming trough with tangent parameter @xmath20 .",
    "the net force on the wedge consists of two reaction forces , @xmath21 and @xmath22 , the weight @xmath23 and the driving force , @xmath24 .",
    "a free body diagram is shown at right for the wedge . ]",
    "i place a loading horizontal force @xmath24 on the wedge and ask two simple questions : what are the two forces @xmath21 and @xmath22 , and is there a maximum force @xmath24 that i can apply and still maintain equilibrium ? clearly , @xmath21 and @xmath22 are `` ordinary '' normal forces , and can only point in the given direction , but with an unknown magnitude .",
    "equilibrium requires @xmath25 and @xmath26 thus , the values of @xmath21 and @xmath22 can be found , although this is not such an illuminating result : @xmath27 and @xmath28 not surprisingly , @xmath22 has a larger magnitude than @xmath21 , because @xmath24 is dragging the wedge off to the right . much more enlightening is to consider the _",
    "maximal value _ of @xmath24 consistent with equilibrium . here , because the left surface is providing @xmath21 by _ pressing away _ from itself , the maximal value of @xmath24 will occur when @xmath29 : @xmath30 here , we have replaced the half - opening angle of the wedge , @xmath31 with the incline anlge of the surface @xmath32 .",
    "thus , if the lateral force @xmath24 satisfies : @xmath33 then the wedge will remain in equilibrium .",
    "should @xmath24 exceed this value , the wedge will start to accelerate . this is a simple , straightforward model for coulomb static friction .",
    "very well , a single wedge resting in a conforming trough behaves similarly to an object resting on a flat surface characterized by static friction @xmath0 . if we conceptualize such a flat , frictioned surface as consisting of two surfaces as in figure  [ figure3 ] we have a useful toy model for static friction .        here , the upper and lower surfaces are frictionless in the usual sense , but consist of a uniform sawtooth profile with a `` roughness '' angle @xmath1 .",
    "if a lateral force @xmath24 is applied to the upper object , the argument above implies that each wedge - shaped subregion will remain in equilibrium only so long as @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the total number of wedges in the upper surface , each consisting of a mass @xmath36 .",
    "if we were to tilt the lower surface at an angle @xmath37 , as long as @xmath38 , there will be a nonzero reaction force between the two surfaces , and the object will remain motionless . when @xmath39 the frictionless surfaces making up the system are free to slide past each other .",
    "thus , the angle of repose matches the usual euler condition : @xmath40    this toy model could be made very explicit by adding low - friction caster wheels to the wedge and trough in figure  2 , and could be used as a lecture demonstration or as a stand alone experiment in equilibrium leading to a study of static friction .",
    "the thing that i enjoy so much about this model is that it places kinetic and static friction upon the same footing . that the kinetic coefficient of friction between two surfaces is related ( in some hard to analyze but definite manner ) to the _ shapes _ or the surfaces ,",
    "as characterized by a rms tangent angle @xmath41 is a fixture in elementary mechanics texts .",
    "this model makes it clear that static friction arises from the same basic phsyics - two rough surfaces interacting .",
    "an interesting , implication of the model is that it may be possible to create surfaces with anisotropic friction,@xcite but in more than just the sense of their being low friction axes on a surface . indeed ,",
    "if microscopically corrugated surfaces with a different forward roughness , @xmath42 the backward roughness @xmath43 , different threshold forces in the forward and reverse directions could be engineered .",
    "thus , not just an axis but a specific direction on a surface - _ a tribological diode _ could be engineered .",
    "i have constructed a simple mechanical toy model for dry static coulombic friction , and naturally interpreted the roughness of a surface as the source of all of the important static friction properties introduced in a first - semester mechanics course .",
    "surfaces are modeled as frictionless but impenetrable , and it is the tangent angle of the sawtooth contacts surfaces make with each other that gives rise to @xmath0 .",
