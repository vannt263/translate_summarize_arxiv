    "measurements of large - scale peculiar velocities provide a direct probe of cosmological models and can be used to place constraints on parameters that are highly degenerate and/or unconstrained via other cosmological probes , such as measurements of primary cmb fluctuations @xcite and supernovae distance measurements @xcite .",
    "specifically , these peculiar velocities depend on the properties and distributions of large - scale structure , along with the characteristics of dark energy and the behavior of gravity on the corresponding length scales .",
    "consequently , peculiar velocity measurements for large numbers of objects can probe the redshift evolution of the properties of dark energy @xcite and also distinguish between dark energy and modified gravity models @xcite .",
    "in addition , measurements of an extremely large peculiar velocity for a single object ( e.g. , 1e0657 - 56 , also known as the bullet cluster ) can be used to directly test the validity of standard cosmological models @xcite .    in the local universe ,",
    "line - of - sight peculiar velocities can be measured using a combination of spectroscopy and distance measurements via the extragalactic distance ladder , generally using the relation described by @xcite .",
    "such measurements have been used to constrain cosmological parameters like the total matter density @xmath7 and the normalization of density fluctuations @xmath8 , generally finding good agreement with other cosmological probes ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "unfortunately , uncertainties in the extragalactic distance ladder are proportional to distance , therefore preventing the application of these methods outside the local universe . in contrast , the kinetic sunyaev - zeldovich ( sz ) effect provides a direct measurement of the line - of - sight peculiar velocity of the distribution of hot electrons within galaxy clusters ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see section  [ sec : sz ] ) .",
    "in addition , the surface brightness of the kinetic sz signal is independent of redshift , depending only on the electron optical depth and line - of - sight peculiar velocity . consequently , many groups have performed detailed studies of the cosmological constraints that would be possible with large - scale peculiar velocity surveys using the kinetic sz signal ( e.g. , @xcite ) .    despite the great promise of kinetic sz surveys , measurements of the kinetic sz signal",
    "have proven to be a significant observational challenge . over the past two decades",
    ", several attempts have been made to detect the kinetic sz signal toward a variety of individual massive clusters .",
    "these observational efforts have used a range of instrumentation , including : the dedicated multi - band photometer suzie and its successors @xcite , multi - band data collected from a range of facilities @xcite , the moderate resolution spectroscopic receiver z - spec @xcite , and the two - band photometric imaging camera bolocam @xcite .",
    "none of these observations have made a high - significance detection of the kinetic sz signal , and the derived uncertainties on the line - of - sight peculiar velocities have not improved significantly from the first measurements with suzie , at least in part because none of the subsequent measurements have used instrumentation specifically designed to detect the kinetic sz signal .",
    "recently , data from the _ wmap _ and _ planck _ satellites have been used to place upper limits on bulk flows and rms variations in peculiar velocities via the kinetic sz signal @xcite .",
    "in addition , @xcite used a combination of atacama cosmology telescope ( act ) and sloan digital sky survey iii data to constrain the mean pairwise momentum of clusters using a kinetic sz signature that is inconsistent with noise at a confidence level of 99.8% .",
    "furthermore , upper limits on the kinetic sz power spectrum measured by the south pole telescope ( spt ) have been used to inform cosmological simulations and to place constraints on the reionization history of the universe @xcite .",
    "one of the strongest hints of a kinetic sz detection was presented in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter m12 ) toward the massive cluster macs j0717.5 + 3745 using bolocam measurements at 140 and 268  ghz .",
    "motivated by this result , we have collected a significant amount of additional 268  ghz bolocam data toward this cluster .",
    "the results we obtain using this additional , deeper data are presented in this manuscript , which is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : sz ] we present the sz effect and in section  [ sec : m0717 ] we describe previous analyses of macs j0717.5 + 3745 . in section  [ sec : reduction ]",
    "we provide the details of our data reduction .",
    "we describe our model of the sz signal toward macs j0717.5 + 3745 in section  [ sec : model ] and provide the corresponding constraints on the two - band sz surface brightnesses of the cluster in sections  [ sec : b ] and [ sec : c ] . in section  [ sec : vpec ] we give the line - of - sight peculiar velocity constraints derived from these surface brightnesses , in section  [ sec : discussion ] we put these results in a broader context , and in section  [ sec : summary ] we briefly summarize our analysis .",
    "we also include an appendix which fully details our treatment of the cosmic infrared background ( cib ) in the 268  ghz data .",
    "when a massive galaxy cluster is moving with respect to the rest frame of the cmb , the doppler - induced spectral distortion of the cmb due to the bulk motion of the electrons in the intra - cluster medium ( icm ) is described by the kinetic sz effect ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the change in cmb temperature due to the kinetic sz effect is given by @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the icm peculiar velocity along the line - of - sight , @xmath11 is the speed of light , and @xmath12 is the total electron optical depth @xmath13 for an electron density @xmath14 integrated along the line of sight @xmath15 ( @xmath16 is the thompson cross section ) .",
    "we note that a positive peculiar velocity results in a negative temperature change , under the convention that a doppler shift toward higher redshift corresponds to a positive value of @xmath10 .",
    "in addition , we note that there are small relativistic corrections to the kinetic sz signal ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "there is also a thermal sz effect , which describes the compton scattering of cmb photons off of high energy electrons in the icm of massive clusters ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "specifically , the change in cmb temperature due to the thermal sz effect is given by @xmath17 where @xmath18 encodes the frequency @xmath19 dependence , including relativistic corrections that depend on the electron temperature @xmath20 ( e.g. , @xcite ) and @xmath21 ( @xmath22 is boltzmann s constant and @xmath23 is the electron mass ) .",
    "in the limit of an isothermal distribution , @xmath24 is directly and linearly proportional to the total electron optical depth @xmath12 .",
    "macs j0717.5 + 3745 , located at @xmath25 , was discovered as part of the massive cluster survey ( macs , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and is extremely massive and dynamically disturbed . as such , it has been the focus of many studies at a range of wavelengths , and it has been chosen as part of the six - cluster hubble space telescope frontier fields program .",
    "radio observations have shown that macs j0717.5 + 3745 hosts the most powerful radio halo known @xcite , and strong lensing data have shown that macs j0717.5 + 3745 has the largest known einstein radius @xcite . from both the galaxy distribution @xcite , and weak lensing studies @xcite , macs j0717.5 + 3745 also appears to be part of a large , extended filamentary structure .",
    "in addition , it has the highest x - ray temperature among all of the clusters in the macs catalog @xcite .",
    "@xcite performed a joint analysis using x - ray data , along with the measured galaxy positions and redshifts , and identified four distinct sub - clusters in macs j0717.5 + 3745 , from n to s labeled as a , b , c , and d ( see figure  [ fig : composite ] ) .",
    "an independent strong lensing analysis described in @xcite also identified four sub - clusters , with similar positions to the ones given in @xcite .",
    "both analyses found sub - cluster c to be the most massive system , and @xcite determined that sub - cluster c is probably the highly disturbed core of the main system .",
    "sub - clusters b and d are assumed to be relatively intact cores of systems that are merging along a direction close to the line - of - sight . in particular",
    ", sub - cluster b is coincident with an x - ray temperature that is colder than the surrounding regions , indicating that its core has not been highly disrupted by the merger . from the spectroscopic data",
    ", @xcite found that sub - cluster b has a line - of - sight velocity that differs from the other components by approximately 3000  km s@xmath1 .",
    "further indications of this large line - of - sight velocity for sub - cluster b were presented in m12 , who found a similar best - fit velocity by using x - ray and sz measurements to constrain the kinetic sz signal toward that sub - cluster , although the statistical significance of their kinetic sz constraint on the velocity is modest ( @xmath26 ) .",
    "this wide range of observational data toward macs j0717.5 + 3745 is therefore converging to what appears to be a coherent picture of this complex system .",
    "we observed macs j0717.5 + 3745 with bolocam from the caltech submillimeter observatory ( cso ) for a total of 12.5 hours at 140  ghz and for a total of 27.3 hours at 268  ghz , where the effective band centers are quoted for a cmb spectrum .",
    "compared to the previous bolocam analysis presented in m12 , this represents an additional 19.3 hours of data collected at 268  ghz in 2012 december .",
    "in contrast to the original 8.0 hours of 268  ghz integration used in m12 , much of which was collected in poor observing conditions with a 225  ghz optical depth @xmath27 , most of the additional 19.3  hours of 268  ghz integration was obtained with @xmath28 .",
    "this additional data was therefore collected during the lowest opacity conditions generally available from the cso .",
    "the bolocam instrument has an @xmath29 diameter circular field of view ( fov ) , and point - spread functions ( psfs ) that are approximately gaussian with full - widths at half - maximums ( fwhms ) equal to @xmath30 and @xmath31 at 140 and 268  ghz , respectively @xcite .",
    "all of our bolocam observations of macs j0717.5 + 3745 involved scanning the cso in a lissajous pattern with an rms velocity of approximately @xmath32/sec .",
    "the details of our data reduction are given elsewhere ( * ? ? ?",
    "* m12 ) , and we briefly summarize our procedure below .",
    "first , we obtain pointing corrections accurate to @xmath33 using frequent observations of nearby quasars , and we obtain an absolute flux calibration accurate to 5% and 10% at 140 and 268  ghz , respectively , using observations of uranus and neptune @xcite . we note that @xcite recently determined the brightness temperature of uranus to be @xmath34  k at 149  ghz using act observations calibrated against the primary cmb anisotropies measured by the _",
    "also , @xcite recently determined the brightness temperature of uranus to be @xmath35  k at 143  ghz based on _ planck _ data .",
    "our calibration model assumes a brightness temperature of @xmath36  k for the 140  ghz bolocam bandpass , which was measured in @xcite by extrapolating the _ wmap _ 94  ghz brightness measurements presented in @xcite using the model of @xcite .",
    "this model predicts the brightness temperature of uranus to increase with decreasing frequency . as a result ,",
    "the act and _ planck _ measurements imply a best - fit 140  ghz brightness temperature that is approximately 2.5  k higher than our assumed value of 106.6  k. however , this difference is comparable to the act and _ planck _ measurement uncertainties , and it is well below our estimated 5% flux calibration uncertainty at 140  ghz .",
    "we therefore have not updated our calibration model .",
    "furthermore , we note that the accuracy of the act and _ planck _ uranus brightness temperatures is @xmath37% , which is only slightly smaller than the 3.3% accuracy of our assumed 140  ghz brightness temperature .",
    "furthermore , our 140  ghz calibration uncertainty receives an approximately equal contribution from our 3.1% beam solid angle uncertainty . revising our flux calibration using act and _ planck",
    "_ would thus not have a significant effect on our overall calibration uncertainty , which itself is already sub - dominant to measurement uncertainties ( see table  [ tab : sz_brightness ] ) .",
    "finally , we note that our 10% flux calibration at 268  ghz is limited largely by atmospheric fluctuations , and therefore a more accurate uranus brightness temperature at that frequency would have no effect on our overall calibration uncertainty .    to remove atmospheric fluctuations from the data , we first subtract a template of the common mode signal over the fov , and we then high - pass filter ( hpf ) the time - stream data at 250 and 500  mhz at 140 and 268  ghz , respectively .",
    "the large amplitude of the atmospheric fluctuations in the 268  ghz data necessitates this more aggressive hpf , and this filtering represents a slight change from the m12 analysis , which used a 250 mhz hpf for both datasets .",
    "we used a scan speed of @xmath38/sec for our observations , and the hpfs at 250 or 500  mhz therefore correspond to angular scales of @xmath39 and @xmath29 , respectively .",
    "consequently , the maximum angular scale preserved by our filtering is largely set by the common mode subtraction over bolocam s @xmath29 fov . because our processing removes astronomical signals with angular sizes larger than the @xmath29 fov",
    ", we determine the map - space transfer function at each wavelength by reverse - mapping and processing an image template through the entire reduction pipeline .",
    "we estimate the instrumental and atmospheric noise in our images by forming 1000 separate jackknife realizations of the data , where a randomly selected subset of half the single observations is multiplied by @xmath40 to remove all astronomical signals .",
    "there are 75 single 10-minute observations of macs j0717.5 + 3745 at 140 ghz and 164 single 10-minute observations of macs j0717.5 + 3745 at 268 ghz .    to account for noise from unwanted astronomical signals",
    ", we first add a different random realization of the primary cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) fluctuations , using the power spectrum measurements from the south pole telescope ( spt ) , to each jackknife @xcite . at 140 ghz , we add an additional random realization of the cib , again based on the measured spt power spectra @xcite , under the assumption that the fluctuations are gaussian .",
    "this assumption is not strictly true , but the cib fluctuations are more than an order of magnitude dimmer than the other noise fluctuations in the data , and therefore a breakdown of this assumption is not likely to have a noticeable effect on our results . the cib is significantly brighter at 268  ghz , and we therefore use a much more detailed model to account for it in those data , as described in the appendix . throughout this manuscript",
    "we refer to these 1000 jackknife plus astronomical noise realizations as `` noise realizations '' .    for the analyses described in this manuscript , we make use of the bolocam data in two different ways .",
    "we use images of the processed data , which cover a maximum size of @xmath41 , to constrain parametric models of the astronomical signals ( see section  [ sec : model ] ) .",
    "this analysis involves convolving the model with the signal transfer function of the data processing and the bolocam psf . to determine best - fit parameters for a given model",
    ", we use the generalized least squares fitting algorithm mpfitfun @xcite under the simplifying assumption that the map noise covariance matrix is diagonal .",
    "we have demonstrated that this fitting method produces unbiased estimates of the best - fit parameter values @xcite , although in some cases it does produce a slightly biased estimate of the uncertainties on these best - fit parameters .",
    "therefore , to fully account for all of the subtleties of our noise , we derive all of the parameter uncertainties via the spread of best - fit values we obtain from applying the same fitting algorithm to a sample of 1000 noise plus signal realizations .",
    "each noise plus signal realization is generated by adding a noise realization to the best - fit model found for the real data .",
    "we also deconvolve the transfer function of the data processing to obtain unbiased images after first reducing the image to a maximum size of @xmath42 to prevent significant amplification of the noise on the largest angular scales .",
    "one subtlety in this process is the fact that the signal transfer function is equal to 0 at an angular wavenumber of 0 ( i.e. , the dc signal level of the image is unconstrained ) .",
    "we therefore use the parametric model fits to constrain the dc signal level , as described in section  [ sec : photometry ] . as a result ,",
    "the deconvolved images have some model dependence .",
    "consequently , to ensure that the uncertainties on the model accurately represent the underlying uncertainties on the data , both for the model fits alone and for the results derived from the deconvolved images , the model must provide an acceptable fit quality . by requiring a model with an acceptable fit quality",
    ", we also ensure that the results derived from model fits will be consistent with those derived from the deconvolved images . to estimate the noise in the deconvolved images",
    ", we also deconvolve the transfer function from each of the 1000 noise realizations .              our analysis of the _ chandra",
    "_ x - ray exposures of macs j0717.5 + 3745 is nearly identical to the analysis described in m12 , and we briefly summarize the main aspects below . as in m12 , we utilize both _",
    "acis - i x - ray observations of macs  j0717.5 + 3745 ( obs ids 1655 and 4200 ) , for a total exposure time of 81  ksec ( see @xcite for the reduction details ) . from these x - ray data",
    "we compute pseudo - pressure @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the x - ray surface brightness @xmath45 @xmath46 is the effective line - of - sight extent of the icm , and @xmath47 is the x - ray emissivity as a function of @xmath20 and metallicity @xmath48 . to generate pseudo - pressure maps from the _ chandra _ images , we first bin the data using _ contbin _ @xcite .",
    "we construct the pseudo - pressure maps from @xmath20 maps generated by computing @xmath20 within each bin and @xmath14 maps computed from the x - ray surface brightness ( see equation  [ eq : pseudopressure ] ) .",
    "to rescale the pseudo - pressure maps to units of compton-@xmath24 , we need to determine the value of @xmath46 ( which in m12 was done using 31  ghz sza data , but in practice is left as a free parameter in all of our fits ) .",
    "this x - ray template for the thermal sz signal , which is simply a rescaling of the x - ray pseudo - pressure map , is called a `` pseudo compton-@xmath24 map '' throughout this manuscript . for consistency with m12",
    ", we employ the same pseudo compton-@xmath24 map that was generated for that analysis .",
    "we note that this map was generated using ciao version 4.3 and calibration database ( caldb ) version 4.4.5 @xcite .",
    "new for this analysis compared to m12 , we also generate 20 realizations of the pseudo compton-@xmath24 map that are fluctuated by the x - ray measurement uncertainties on @xmath20 , which dominate the uncertainty of the pseudo - pressure maps ( see figure  [ fig : pseudoy ] ) .",
    "we note that , in addition to measurement uncertainties , the pseudo compton-@xmath24 maps are also subject to possible systematic errors due to gas clumping within the icm .",
    "clumping is defined as @xmath49 and from the equations listed above , we see that the pseudo - compton-@xmath24 maps are sensitive to @xmath50 .",
    "typical clumping factors of @xmath51 within @xmath52 are expected from simulations ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "assuming clumping is uncorrelated with temperature variations , clumping is sub - dominant to the variations included in the input temperature maps , and we therefore do not include any additional uncertainty from clumping in our 20 realizations of the pseudo compton-@xmath24 maps .",
    "in addition , we note that the average systematic trend for x - ray surface brightness to be boosted by clumping is mitigated by the fact that the amplitude of the compton-@xmath24 maps is constrained by the sz data via the factor of @xmath46 .",
    "we also use the _ chandra _ data to constrain the electron temperature @xmath20 within two @xmath53 diameter regions centered on sub - clusters b and c ( these temperatures are applied to our analysis in section  [ sec : vpec ] ) .",
    "in contrast to the pseudo compton-@xmath24 maps , which we obtain via the same reduction that was used in m12 , we constrain these values of @xmath20 using maps generated with ciao version 4.5 and calibration database ( caldb ) version 4.5.6 @xcite .",

    "these data became public in 2012 october ( obs ids ; 0672420101 , 0672420301 , 0672420301 ) , and therefore were not included in m12 .",
    "we perform the _ xmm _ mos data processing and background modeling with the _ xmm _ extended source analysis software ( _ esas _ ) using the methods reported in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the details of our _ xmm _ analysis are described fully in @xcite , and we provide a summary and discuss important differences here .",
    "our _ xmm - newton _ data analysis includes production of the calibrated event files , filtering for the high intensity soft proton flares , and determination of the background intensity in each observation .",
    "the net exposure time after filtering the event files for good time intervals is 155  ksec .",

    "the temperature gradient is not large , and so contamination by adjacent regions ( e.g. , other sub - clusters ) due to the wider psf of _ xmm _ should not affect the extracted temperature for each region .    for each extracted spectrum , we model a superposition of four main background components : quiescent particle background , soft x - ray background emission ( including solar wind charge exchange , galactic halo , local hot bubble , and extragalactic unresolved sources ) , and residual contamination from soft protons @xcite . as in @xcite",

    "in order to model the sz signals from the icm of macs j0717.5 + 3745 , we employ the pseudo compton-@xmath24 map to describe the overall shape of the thermal sz signal .",
    "the x - ray data we use to create the pseudo compton-@xmath24 map depend negligibly on the line - of - sight velocity of the icm , and the map therefore provides a spatial template for the thermal sz signal that is free from contamination from the kinetic sz signal .",
    "we then convert this map to units of surface brightness in each bolocam observing band according to the thermal sz equations @xcite , including relativistic corrections @xcite . for this conversion",
    "we compute the responsivity - weighted average bandpass over all the bolocam detectors , and from this spectrum we determine the effective band center for a thermal sz spectrum . due to relativistic corrections , this effective band center depends on the icm temperature . for the 140  ghz band , both the thermal and kinetic sz band centers are @xmath69  ghz , while the 268  ghz thermal sz band center is @xmath70  ghz and the kinetic sz band center is @xmath71  ghz . then , for each bolocam band , we convolve the pseudo compton-@xmath24 map with both the bolocam psf and the transfer function of the data processing .",
    "we first constrain the normalization of the pseudo compton-@xmath24 map via a simultaneous fit to both the 140 and 268  ghz bolocam data . physically , this corresponds to a constraint on the effective line - of - sight extent of the icm @xmath46 , under the assumption of zero kinetic sz signal . for this fit ,",
    "we use only the data within a @xmath72 square region approximately centered on the peak of the sz signal at 140  ghz .",
    "we choose this region because it is large enough to contain the bulk of the sz signal and it is small enough to mitigate the effects of the large - angular - scale atmospheric noise in the 268  ghz data .",
    "the quality of this fit is very poor , with a @xmath73 for 717 degrees of freedom , indicating that the pseudo compton-@xmath24 map alone is inadequate to describe our bolocam sz data ( see figure  [ fig : processed_thumbnails ] ) .            motivated by this poor fit , along with the significant differences in the line - of - sight velocities measured by @xcite for the",

    ", if any , additional model components are required in order to describe the data , we perform a simulated f - test according to the procedure described in @xcite . to perform this test",
    "we first insert the baseline model into each of our 1000 noise realizations ( in this case the baseline model is the pseudo compton-@xmath24 map with our best - fit single normalization ) .",
    "we then fit two models to each of these realizations , one consisting of only the baseline model , and one with an extension to the baseline model .",
    "we compute the value of @xmath74 from these two separate fits for each of the 1000 realizations , and the resulting values provide a measurement of the distribution of @xmath74 for the null hypothesis that the model extension is not required by the data .",
    "there are several possible model extensions to consider , and we therefore proceed according to the following decision tree : 1 ) determine the value of @xmath74 separately for each possible model extension ; 2 ) perform the simulated f - test to determine which extension is most preferred by the data ; 3 ) if the most preferred model extension is preferred at a high enough significance , which we quantify based on a probability to exceed ( pte ) from the simulated f - test , then the model extension is added to the baseline model .",
    "these steps are repeated until none of the possible model extensions have a simulated f - test pte below our threshold , which we have chosen to be equal to 0.02 .",
    "model permutations .",
    "our pte threshold , which is necessarily somewhat arbitrary , is therefore small enough to ensure that a random fluctuation among this set of 32 permutations is unlikely to produce a pte small enough for us to include an extension that is not justified by the data .",
    "we explore the sensitivity of our results to this pte threshold in detail in section  [ sec : systematics ] . ]    as a first possible model extension , we consider a smooth template of the sz signal centered on one of the four sub - clusters according to the positions given by @xcite , allowing for different normalizations of the template at 140 and 268  ghz .",
    "we construct the sz template according to the average profile constrained by bolocam for a sample of 45 clusters @xcite , fixing the scale radius according to the estimated mass of each sub - cluster , which we obtain by using the ratios of sub - cluster masses determined by @xcite , in combination with the whole - cluster value of @xmath75 determined by @xcite .",
    "we note that this template represents a more physically motivated model than the gaussian profile assumed by m12 .",
    "we perform four separate fits , in each case fitting a single normalization to the pseudo compton-@xmath24 map ( i.e. , assuming that the pseudo compton-@xmath24 map contains only thermal sz signal ) , along with separate normalizations at 140 and 268  ghz for an sz template centered on one of the four sub - clusters ( i.e. , allowing the sz template for that sub - cluster to be free to include any arbitrary mixture of thermal and kinetic sz signal ) .",
    "we find values of @xmath74 equal to 48.3 , 108.1 , 9.5 , and 26.3 when the model contains an additional sz template coincident with sub - clusters a , b , c , and d , respectively .",
    "these values of @xmath74 correspond to f - test ptes of 0.001 , @xmath76 , 0.213 , and 0.026 .",
    "we note that the second value is extrapolated , due to the fact that we only have 1000 realizations of @xmath74 .    as another possible extension to the baseline model of a pseudo compton-@xmath24 map with a single normalization in both bolocam bands",
    ", we also explore the option of allowing for different normalizations of the pseudo compton-@xmath24 map at 140 and 268  ghz .",
    "physically , this would represent a single bulk velocity for the entire cluster , with the cluster being isothermal so that the kinetic sz signal has a spatial profile identical to the spatial profile of the thermal sz signal .",
    "this fit results in a value of @xmath77 , which corresponds to a simulated f - test pte of @xmath78 , where we have again used an extrapolation due to our finite number of realizations .",
    "therefore , according to our f - test decision tree , we assume a new baseline model consisting of the pseudo compton-@xmath24 with a single normalization , along with a sz template centered on sub - cluster b , as this is the model extension with the smallest simulated f - test pte .    to fully characterize the fit of this new baseline model , we insert the best - fit model into each of our 1000 noise realizations , and then fit the same model to each of these realizations .",
    "the best - fit model has an overall @xmath79 for 715 degrees of freedom , which corresponds to a pte of 0.29 based on the fits to the noise realizations , indicating that it provides an adequate description of our bolocam sz data .    using this new baseline model",
    ", we again follow the f - test decision tree to determine whether the data still require an additional model extension .",
    "we perform three new fits that introduce an additional sz component at a , c , and d to our baseline model . for these three fits , the value of @xmath74 is 23.9 , 8.4 , and 21.1 , which corresponds to a simulated f - test pte of 0.033 , 0.260 , and 0.046 . as before , we also perform a fit allowing the normalization of the pseudo compton-@xmath24 map to be different at 140 and 268  ghz , and we find a @xmath80 , with an associated simulated f - test pte of 0.963 .",
    "all of these fits have ptes larger than 0.02 , and we therefore conclude that none of these additional degrees of freedom are required to describe our data .",
    "consequently , our baseline model of the sz signal includes a pseudo compton-@xmath24 map with a single normalization , along with an sz template centered on sub - cluster b with separate normalizations at 140 and 268  ghz ( see figure  [ fig : processed_thumbnails ] ) .",
    "the data s strong lack of a preference for separate normalizations of the pseudo compton-@xmath24 map at 140 and 268  ghz justifies our choice of that model to describe the thermal component of the sz signal .",
    "furthermore , the best - fit normalization of the pseudo compton-@xmath24 map is @xmath81 .",

    "the kinetic sz signal is a factor of @xmath82 dimmer compared to the thermal sz signal in the sza observing band .",
    "therefore , the consistent normalizations of the pseudo compton-@xmath24 map found by bolocam and sza further indicate that it provides a good description of the thermal sz signal toward macs j0717.5 + 3745 . as an additional cross - check",
    ", we also refit the normalization of the pseudo compton-@xmath24 map using the bolocam data , but excluding the data within a @xmath53 diameter aperture centered on sub - cluster b. this fit , which did not include any additional sz components , results in a best - fit normalization of @xmath83 for the pseudo compton-@xmath24 map .",
    "the fit quality is good , with a pte of 0.38 , indicating that , outside sub - cluster b , the m12 pseudo compton-@xmath24 map , which was normalized to sza , describes the bolocam data well .",
    "although these results serve as additional evidence that our model choice is physically justified , we emphasize that our results described below do not strictly depend on the pseudo compton-@xmath24 map being a good template for the thermal sz signal , only that our model is physically motivated and provides an adequate description of the data .",
    "based on the requirement of an additional model component centered on sub - cluster b to describe our data , we compute the sz brightness at both 140 and 268  ghz toward that sub - cluster . in order to eliminate as much contamination from other regions of the cluster as possible , we use a circular aperture with a diameter of @xmath53 , which is slightly larger than the psf fwhm at 140  ghz .",
    "we first compute the average surface brightnesses within this aperture using the best - fit model from section  [ sec : model ] , convolved with the bolocam psf to accurately represent the resolution of the measurement . to include all of the subtle effects of the noise , such as the correlations between pixels due to residual atmospheric noise and primary cmb fluctuations",

    "in addition to the best - fit model , we also compute the surface brightness toward sub - cluster b by directly integrating our deconvolved images , which are shown in figure  [ fig : deconv ] . as described in section  [",
    "sec : bolocam ] , the deconvolved images have no sensitivity to the dc signal level . as a result , we determine the dc signal level of the deconvolved images using the best - fit model . specifically , we add a signal offset to the deconvolved images so that the average signal level within the @xmath72 region we use to constrain the model is equal to the average signal level of the best - fit model within the same region .",
    "we exclude the @xmath53 diameter aperture centered on sub - cluster b in this calculation to avoid any potential bias in the surface brightness we derive within that aperture .",

    "the model derived results , we used a ks test to determine if the distribution of 1000 values is consistent with gaussian , and we find ptes of 0.75 and 0.57 at 140 and 268  ghz , respectively .",
    "we note that these surface brightness values are consistent with those derived from the best - fit model , although there is significantly more measurement uncertainty on the 268  ghz value .",
    "this additional uncertainty is a result of the significant large - angular - scale atmospheric noise in those data , which is amplified by the deconvolution of the signal transfer function .",

    "the three sets of coordinates are separated from each other by @xmath129 , which is a significant fraction of the aperture radius of @xmath130 , and means that less than 50% of the area enclosed by one aperture is also enclosed by another aperture .",

    "the remaining difference between our current surface brightness values and the ones presented in m12 is due to minor changes in our assumed model of the sz signal .",
    "first , m12 constrained the normalization of the pseudo compton-@xmath24 map separately at 140 and 268  ghz , compared to the joint constraint we use in our present analysis .",
    "in addition , m12 assumed that the sz template centered on sub - cluster b had a gaussian profile , compared to the more physically motivated profile we use in this analysis , with a shape described by the best - fit profile to a sample of 45 clusters observed with bolocam @xcite .",

    "this result is in contrast to the measurements presented in m12 , where the two values differed by slightly more than @xmath134 .",

    "therefore , as described above , for this analysis we choose to constrain the dc signal offset of the 140  ghz deconvolved image using our nominal model of the sz signal ( a pseudo compton-@xmath24 map with an additional sz component centered on sub - cluster b ) .",

    "chandra _ and _ xmm _ , and the temperatures we measure are in general agreement with this systematic difference . at this point , the cause of this difference has not been conclusively demonstrated . due to this lack of a conclusive understanding of the difference , combined with the fact that the difference between the x - ray temperatures we derive from the two observatories is of modest statistical significance",
    ", we choose to constrain the electron temperatures via the joint likelihood from the _ chandra _ and _ xmm _ data .",
    "if we instead adopt the _ xmm_-only values of @xmath20 , then we find best - fit values of @xmath10 equal to @xmath179  km s@xmath1 and @xmath180  km s@xmath1 for the model fit and direct integration of sub - cluster b and @xmath181  km s@xmath1 and @xmath182  km s@xmath1 for the model fit and direct integration of sub - cluster c. if we instead adopt the _ chandra_-only values of @xmath20 , then we find best - fit values @xmath10 equal to @xmath183  km s@xmath1 and @xmath184  km s@xmath1 for the model fit and direct integration of sub - cluster b and @xmath171  km s@xmath1 and @xmath181  km s@xmath1 for the model fit and direct integration of sub - cluster c. for sub - cluster b , the _ chandra_-only temperatures yield line - of - sight velocities that differ by @xmath185 , but all of the other values are statistically indistinguishable from our results in table  [ tab : vpec ] .",
    "therefore , we conclude that x - ray calibration uncertainties do not strongly affect our constraints on @xmath10 .",
    "we further note that the significance of our kinetic sz measurement from @xmath158 is nearly independent of the exact value of @xmath20 and the slight differences in @xmath10 for the different temperatures are due to the inverse relationship between @xmath20 and @xmath12 for a fixed @xmath24 , coupled with the inverse relationship between @xmath10 and @xmath12 for a fixed kinetic sz surface brightness .    to assess the impact of the x - ray uncertainties on @xmath20",

    "therefore , the x - ray uncertainties are not significant in our overall error budget on @xmath10 .    to determine the effect of the cib on our measurement of @xmath10 , we also compute the sz brightness under the assumption that the cib is completely and noiselessly subtracted from the data .",
    "specifically , compared to our default noise realizations , we remove the noise from the undetected cib , along with our uncertainties on the subtracted cib ( see the appendix ) .",
    "this results in a negligible change in the 140  ghz surface brightness uncertainties , and a @xmath188% reduction in the 268  ghz surface brightness uncertainties .",
    "there is a corresponding @xmath188% reduction in our derived uncertainties on @xmath10 .",
    "in addition , we estimate the potential bias that would result from not subtracting any of the bolocam or spire - detected galaxies from our 268  ghz data .",
    "we find that our best - fit 268  ghz surface brightness values change by @xmath187% , indicating that the bright sources in the cib produce a non - negligible bias in the sz surface brightnesses we measure .",
    "therefore , at our sensitivities , the cib has a noticeable effect on our kinetic sz measurement , and is more significant than uncertainties on the x - ray - derived electron temperature .",
    "we also perform fits under the assumption that primary cmb fluctuations are perfectly subtracted from our data by removing them from our noise realizations .",
    "this does not produce a noticeable change in the 268  ghz surface brightness constraints , but does improve the 140  ghz surface brightness constraints by @xmath189% , with a corresponding improvement in our derived constraints on @xmath10 .",
    "therefore , noise from primary cmb fluctuations has an effect on our kinetic sz measurements that is smaller than , but comparable to , noise from cib fluctuations .",
    "this mild sensitivity to primary cmb fluctuations is due to the relative shallowness of our 140  ghz data , which have an rms of @xmath190  @xmath191k@xmath192-arcmin ( see table 1 of @xcite ) .",
    "examining the error budget in table  [ tab : sz_brightness ] , the dominant uncertainties are associated with sz measurement noise and the exact choice of model used to describe the sz data , although we note that uncertainties due to absolute flux calibration are only a factor of @xmath82 smaller . as detailed in section  [ sec : bolocam ] , a model is required to interpret our sz data because the large - angular scale atmospheric noise necessitates high - pass filtering of the data , which removes signal on large angular scales . as a result , a spatial model of the sz is the only way to recover this large - scale signal in order to obtain an absolute surface brightness .",
    "therefore , this modeling uncertainty is a direct result of the measurement noise in the sz data , and is not a fundamental limitation .",
    "consequently , deeper sz data would provide a significant improvement to our kinetic sz measurement , although these deeper sz data will require better absolute flux calibration , are likely to require an improved subtraction of the cib ( and possibly the primary cmb fluctuations ) , and may require an improved understanding the the x - ray temperature calibration or the line - of - sight temperature structure ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "our analysis constrains the line - of - sight peculiar velocities of two of the sub - clusters of macs j0717.5 + 3745 via a measurement of the sz surface brightnesses within small apertures centered on these sub - clusters . due to the complex dynamics in macs",
    "j0717.5 + 3745 , the sz signal within these apertures may not be sourced by gas bound to a single sub - cluster with a single coherent bulk velocity .",
    "however , as described in section  [ sec : m0717 ] , the x - ray data show that sub - cluster b does appear to have a relatively intact core region .",
    "therefore , at least for sub - cluster b , the assumption of a single bound icm appears to be justified .",
    "sub - cluster c seems to be more disturbed , and this assumption may not be valid for that region .",
    "in addition to possible merger - induced gas inhomogeneities , there are also likely to be line - of - sight projection effects that cause the sz signal within a single aperture to be sourced by the icms of multiple sub - clusters . in part to answer this question , @xcite studied the sz signal from a simulated triple - merger system in detail .",
    "their simulated cluster is similar to macs j0717.5 + 3745 , and contains one sub - cluster with a velocity of 2500  km s@xmath1 .",
    "they used kinetic sz measurements at 90 and 268  ghz to constrain the line - of - sight velocities of sub - clusters within the merger and found best - fit velocities that are consistent with the true velocities of the sub - clusters to within @xmath187% .",
    "this is partly due to the fact that the sz signal from the core of the sub - cluster of interest is significantly brighter than the sz signal away from the core of other sub - clusters in projection .",
    "however , the merging sub - cluster also induces a small kinetic sz signal in the icms of the other sub - clusters in projection with it , and this induced signal serves to bring the sz - measured velocity into better agreement with the true velocity .",
    "these results indicate that at our current measurement precision , the bias in our measured velocities due to interactions and projection effects from other sub - clusters is likely to be statistically insignificant .",
    "our kinetic sz measurements are in good agreement with the spectroscopic measurements of @xcite and indicate that sub - cluster b is moving with a line - of - sight velocity of @xmath193  km s@xmath1 compared to the center of mass of the system .",
    "@xcite note that this value is close to the maximum expected velocity due to infall from infinity .",
    "for example , if sub - cluster b starts from rest at infinity , and if the main cluster has a mass of @xmath194  m@xmath195 , then sub - cluster b would need to be within @xmath196  mpc of the main cluster to reach an infall velocity of 3000  km s@xmath1 .",
    "this is in fairly good agreement with n - body simulations , which indicate that a relative velocity of @xmath193  km s@xmath1 is possible for a macs j0717.5 + 3745-like cluster within the framework of the standard cosmological model .",
    "for example , @xcite showed that mergers with main cluster masses above @xmath197  m@xmath195 at @xmath198 have a non - negligible probability of producing velocities larger than 3000  km s@xmath1 when the sub - cluster is within the virial radius of the main cluster .",
    "in addition , the cluster studied by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see section  [ sec : add_bias ] ) was selected from a cosmological simulation of a 400  @xmath199mpc cube , and one of its sub - clusters has a line - of - sight velocity of 2500  km s@xmath1 .",
    "therefore , we conclude that while the velocity of sub - cluster b is large , it is not in any tension with the standard cosmological models .",
    "we detect an extended sz signal toward macs j0717.5 + 3745 at high significance in two observing bands with bolocam ( 140 and 268  ghz ) .",
    "the 268  ghz data also contain significant emission from dusty star forming galaxies .",
    "we subtract all of the galaxies brighter than @xmath200  mjy using a combination of _ herschel_-spire and bolocam data , although both this subtraction , and the un - subtracted population of dimmer galaxies , produce a non - negligible amount of noise in our measurement of the sz signal ( see section  [ sec : limitations ] ) . using a rigorous decision tree based on application of the f - test",
    ", we find that a physically - motivated model composed of a _ chandra_-derived pseudo compton-@xmath24 map to describe the thermal sz signal , plus an additional template centered on sub - cluster b with different normalizations at 140 and 268  ghz , is the minimum model that is adequate to describe our data .",
    "we note that sub - cluster b has a measured spectroscopic line - of - sight velocity of @xmath0  km s@xmath1 @xcite .    from this best - fit model , we compute the two - band sz surface brightness toward sub - cluster b , along with the most massive sub - cluster , c. we also compute the sz surface brightness by directly integrating the bolocam images , although the best - fit model is required to constrain the dc signal level of these images , which is filtered away by our data processing . for both the model - derived and directly integrated sz surface brightnesses , we include uncertainties due to measurement noise and absolute flux calibration .",
    "in addition , we include an uncertainty due to the variations in derived surface brightnesses for a range of physically motivated models that we could have chosen to describe our data , and we find that this uncertainty is similar to our measurement uncertainty .",

    "we seek to measure , all of the dusty star - forming galaxies in our bolocam image are unresolved .",

    "we estimate that , between the bolocam and spire detections , we remove all of the dusty galaxies with a 268  ghz flux density @xmath245  mjy along with @xmath246 galaxies with lower flux densities , significantly reducing the contamination from these sources on our measurement of the sz signal ( see figure  [ fig : n_s ] , left ) .    due to the fact that the spire candidates are in general not well described by the greybody model , the derived uncertainty on the extrapolation is likely to be underestimated . therefore , to determine the effect that this underestimate might have on our sz results , we artificially increase the uncertainties on the spire photometry for each candidate until the reduced @xmath242 of the greybody fit is equal to 1 . for candidates with a reduced @xmath247 ,",

    "this could be caused by , for example , noise - boosted flux densities in the spire data or an incorrect choice of sed template . to estimate the effects of such a potential bias , we re - estimated the 268  ghz sz brightnesses of sub - clusters b and c after subtracting an extrapolated spire template with the best - fit bolocam normalization of 0.84 ( rather than 1 ) . using this renormalized template results in sz brightnesses that differ by @xmath252  mjy sr@xmath1 compared to those found with the default normalization of the template , or by approximately 2% of our nominal uncertainties .",

    "although the emission from cluster - member galaxies at 268  ghz is likely to be negligible compared to the background cib , the significant magnification of the background due to gravitational lensing can distort the number counts .",
    "in particular , lensing preserves the total surface brightness of the cib , but causes a significant and spatially dependent change in the number counts @xcite .",
    "our data show hints of this change as an excess of sources at bright flux densities , which is consistent with measurements toward massive clusters using aztec at the same wavelength @xcite .",
    "it is therefore not clear how well the unlensed @xcite model describes the faint population of dusty star - forming galaxies toward macs j0717.5 + 3745 .    to test the validity of the @xcite model in describing our macs j0717.5 + 3745 data ,",
    "we add a random sky realization to each jackknife realization of the adaptive - pca map , where the sky realizations are based on the aforementioned difference between the @xcite model and our detected number counts .",
    "we find that adding these random sky realizations increases the noise rms by 12.3% .",
    "we then fit a gaussian to the distributions of pixel s / n values for the adaptive - pca map jackknife realizations , and to the actual data after subtraction of the extended - sz template , the bolocam detections , and the extrapolated spire detections ( see figure  [ fig : n_s ] , right ) .",
    "we find that the gaussian standard deviations returned by the fits differ by @xmath253% , in excellent agreement with the prediction based on the @xcite model .",
    "therefore , the @xcite model provides a good description of the global noise fluctuations due to dim unresolved galaxies at the level we are able to ascertain with our bolocam data .    in principal",
    ", we could subtract some of the signal from these dim unresolved galaxies via e.g. , a cross correlation analysis between the spire and bolocam maps .",
    "although these dim galaxies are not detected in any single spire band , their signal will be correlated across the ensemble of spire and bolocam bands .",
    "however , the spire data , particularly at 500  @xmath191 m , contains a non - negligible amount of diffuse sz signal .",
    "this signal would also be correlated across the multiple bands , and therefore such an analysis could subtract sz signal from the bolocam data in addition to cib signal . furthermore , the effective reddening of the cib due to the sz signal in the spire data could potentially cause a significant over - estimate of the signal when extrapolated to the bolocam bands . consequently , to mitigate these effects , we have chosen to subtract only the unresolved bright galaxies individually detected by spire , which should not be significantly contaminated by the diffuse sz signal .",
    "although beyond the scope of this work , an optimal analysis would jointly constrain a model of the sz and cib signals via a simultaneous fit to both the spire and bolocam data . however , given the relative dimness of the sz signal in the spire bands , along with the relative dimness of the cib signal in the bolocam bands , the improvement from such a joint fit is likely to be minimal compared to our analysis procedure .",
    "we note that the fluctuations from the cib are accounted for in our 140  ghz data by adding noise realizations generated according to the power spectrum measurements from spt @xcite .",
    "we do not attempt to subtract any individual galaxies due to the large , and consequently potentially untrustworthy , spectral extrapolation that would be required from the spire measurements .",
    "in addition , as noted above , there are very few galaxies detected within the extended region containing bright sz signal , and none of those galaxies are particularly bright .",
    "we note that this is in general true for massive clusters , as shown in @xcite .",
    "however , to verify that the cib is sufficiently dim that we can neglect subtracting it at 140  ghz , we extrapolated the spire detections to 140  ghz and removed them from the bolocam data . even if this large extrapolation is potentially untrustworthy , it should provide a reasonable estimate of the potential brightness of the cib at 140  ghz .",
    "when we subtract this extrapolated cib , we find that the best - fit 140  ghz sz brightnesses toward both sub - cluster b and sub - cluster c changes by @xmath254  mjy sr@xmath1 , or by approximately 1% of the total uncertainty on each sub - cluster s sz brightness . therefore , neglecting to subtract the cib at 140  ghz has a negligible effect on our overall results ."
