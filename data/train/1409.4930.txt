    "an important model hybrid system is a resonator coupled to a mesoscopic normal or superconducting system [ ] . in many cases ,",
    "the resonator , which can be electrical or nanomechanical , is slow and can be described classically .",
    "this implies the relation @xmath0 between its resonant frequency @xmath1 and the temperature @xmath2 .",
    "in contrast to this , the characteristic energy of a mesoscopic quantum subsystem is usually larger than @xmath3 . in this case",
    ", the resonator and the quantum subsystem evolve on different timescales .",
    "adjustment should be made if , in addition , there is a slow component in the evolution of the quantum system .",
    "one such situation takes place  [ ] if the rabi oscillations are induced with a frequency @xmath4 , resulting in an effective energy exchange between the subsystems .",
    "another interesting situation occurs when the relaxation of the quantum subsystem is so slow that its characteristic time @xmath5 is of the order of the resonator s period @xmath6 , which is a realistic assumption for quantum dots  [ ] .",
    "then the delayed response of the quantum subsystem to the resonator s perturbation implies that the resonator is influenced by both the in - phase and out - of - phase forces  [ ] .",
    "the out - of - phase force can damp or amplify the resonator oscillations [ ] .",
    "such effects can be described as a decrease or increase in the number of photons in the resonator , which relates to lasing and cooling  [ ] .",
    "alternatively , the slow evolution of a quantum subsystem subject to a periodic driving by a resonator with a significant probability of relaxation can be described in terms of periodic _ sisyphus - type processes_. this was studied for an electric resonator coupled to a superconducting qubit  [ ] . in such systems ,",
    "the electric resonator performs sisyphus - type work by slowly driving a qubit along a continuously ascending ( or descending ) trajectory in energy space , while the cyclic sisyphus destiny is completed by resonant excitation on one side of the trajectory and relaxation on the other  [ ] .",
    "our aim in this paper is to study an analogous process for a typical nanoelectromechanical system  [ ] , which consists of a nanomechanical resonator ( nr ) coupled to a single - electron transistor or a quantum dot ( qd )  [ ] .",
    "this study is partly motivated by the experiments in refs .",
    "a straightforward approach for describing a slow classical resonator coupled to a fast quantum subsystem is a fully - quantum description of the coalesced system  [ ] .",
    "arguably , a more intuitively clear procedure assumes a delayed response of the quantum subsystem to the resonator driving .",
    "the effectiveness of this _ _",
    "delayed - response method _ _ has been confirmed in different contexts  [ ] .",
    "in particular , the observation of sisyphus cooling and amplification of an electrical _ lc _ circuit by a flux qubit  [ ] can be described by solving the master equation of the coalesced system [ ] ; the delayed - response method performs equally well in describing such a system  [ ] . in both cases , successful fitting of the experimental results yields a similar value for the key delay parameter , @xmath7 , close to the optimal value for sisyphus cooling and amplification .",
    "accordingly , for a coupled slow classical resonator and a fast quantum subsystem , we will use a semiclassical theory within the framework of the delayed - response method .",
    "the resonator ( here a nr ) slowly drives the quantum subsystem ( a qd , in our case ) , with the response of the latter at a time @xmath8 determined by the driving parameters at some prior time @xmath9 .",
    "we will show that this produces an out - of - phase force , with the resonator s oscillations amplified or attenuated by the back - action of this force . while we leave the detailed discussions for the appendixes , in the rest of the paper we consider in detail the delayed response of the qd to the oscillations of the coupled nr .",
    "the presentation is organized in such a way that the approach could be straightforwardly adapted to other similar systems , where a slowly - driven system is coupled to a fast quantum system , whose back - action is delayed by the ( possibly slow ) relaxation process .",

    "this is by phenomenologically introducing a delayed time - dependence in the qd response to the influence of the nr .",
    "this key assumption is discussed in detail in appendix a. the delayed - response method can be formulated as follows .",

    "note that for illustration we consider the number of electrons and not the energy levels since we have an open driven system in which energy changes of one subsystem should not be equal to minus the energy changes in another subsystem .     as a function of the bias @xmath191 and ( b ) changes of the bias due to the periodic evolution of the nr .",
    "the right and left halves of the graph illustrate the cycles in which resonator changes the average number of electrons from 0 to 1 and vice versa .",
    "see text for a detailed description of these cycles.,width=8 ]    in the right and left halves of fig .",
    "[ fig : sisyphus ] we consider two cases of positive and negative offsets .",
    "the amplitude of the oscillations is chosen to be twice the offset , so that the resonator drives the two - level system ( tls ) between the point of energy level quasi - intersection ( at @xmath192 ) and the point removed from it ; see also fig .",
    "fig : i - q(a , b ) .",
    "we assume that the region where the energy levels are curved ( i.e. , experience avoided - level crossing ) plays the role of a 50/50- beam - splitter .",
    "this means that after going out of this region , the tls levels are equally populated .",
    "here we assume that the characteristic relaxation time @xmath5 is longer than the time of passing this region .",
    "moreover , we assume that it is of the order of the driving period , namely , @xmath193 .    then , the overall dynamics of the tls can be stroboscopically split in four intervals .",
    "consider first the right part of fig .",
    "[ fig : sisyphus ] .",
    "( 1 ) the resonator drives the tls uphill along the ground state , @xmath91 changes from 0 to 1/2 .",
    "( 2 ) in the region of the avoided - level crossing , the two energy levels become equally populated ; and then we monitor the upper - level evolution . (",
    "3 ) again the resonator drives the tls uphill , until it relaxes during the fourth evolution stage . in this cycle",
    "the resonator does work such that it changes @xmath91 from 0 to 1 , while the relaxation does vice versa .",
    "in contrast , in the inverted cycle , @xmath194 , shown in the left part of fig .  [",
    "fig : sisyphus ] , the resonator does work changing @xmath122 from 1 to 0 .    the beam - splitting can be created in several ways .",
    "( i ) this can be created by means of non - adiabatic landau - zener transitions between the energy levels  [ ] .",
    "( ii ) the 50/50- beam - splitting can be created by resonantly driving the tls as in ref .",
    "( iii ) alternatively , the non - zero upper - level occupation can be created by the thermal excitation , which is essential when the temperature is comparable with the energy - level separation , as it was considered in the previous section .",
    "the equations for the source - drain current @xmath49 and the changes of the nr quality factor @xmath39 can be rewritten as follows:@xmath195where @xmath196 .",
    "the former equation was illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : i - q](c ) .",
    "the latter equation was illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : ksi ] .",
    "the deep analogy with the sisyphus cycles for the flux qubit-_lc _ resonator system  [ ] , mentioned earlier in the text , can be further justified by writing down analogous equations for this system .",
    "so , following ref .  [ ] , we consider now the driven flux qubit with the hamiltonian @xmath197 in this case , the averaged current in the flux qubit is  [ ] @xmath198 , where @xmath199 is the flux qubit persistent current and the averaged upper level occupation probability is given by the lorentzian@xmath200with @xmath201 and @xmath202 . then for the changes of the quality factor @xmath39 of the _ _  lc _ _ resonator one can obtain  [ ] @xmath203where @xmath204 .",

    "( [ dq_prop ] ) ; it is proportional to the lagging parameter @xmath205 ( which is zero at @xmath206 ) and contains two competing terms : the lorentzian and its derivative ; the latter being the alteration of a peak and a dip .",
    "it is this latter term ( when it is dominant ) that describes the sisyphus amplification and cooling , respectively  [ ] .",
