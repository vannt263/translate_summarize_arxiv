    "scale invariance is known to be an important cornerstone for our understanding of critical phenomena and provides the basis of renormalization group theory . on a lattice",
    "a scale transformation can be carried out by coarse - graining the elementary degrees of freedom .",
    "one of the best known examples is wilson s block - spin renormalization of the ising model , where several spins are grouped into blocks  @xcite . if the hamiltonian in terms of these block variables has the same form as the original one ( possibly with different parameters ) , this procedure maps the system onto itself , forming a group of renormalization transformations .",
    "critical phenomena are typically associated with fixed points under renormalization group transformations .",
    "non - equilibrium systems differ from their equilibrium counterparts in so far as they involve time as an additional dimension on equal footing with the spatial degrees of freedom .",
    "nevertheless the situation is similar , i.e. by appropriately coarse - graining the elementary degrees of freedom we can identify critical phenomena as fixed points under renormalization group transformations . in the past decades various renormalization techniques for nonequilibrium systems have been developed , including field - theoretic renormalization methods  @xcite , density matrix renormalization  @xcite , and continuous non - perturbative renormalization techniques  @xcite , to name only a few .    in the present paper",
    "we consider a discrete renormalization scheme in the spirit of wilson s block - spin method that is suitable for systems with continuous nonequilibrium phase transitions into absorbing states  @xcite .",
    "the most important example of such systems is directed percolation ( dp )  @xcite , a universality class of absorbing phase transitions which plays a paradigmatic role similar to the ising class in equilibrium statistical mechanics .",
    "other examples include the class of compact directed percolation , the parity - conserving universality class , voter - type phase transitions , the pair - contact process with diffusion , and the manna class ( for a review see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "universal behavior is also observed at tricritical points  @xcite and in models with algebraic long - range interactions  @xcite .",
    "recently absorbing phase transitions attracted increasing attention since the critical behavior of directed percolation could be reproduced experimentally for the first time in turbulent liquid crystals  @xcite .    before going into detail",
    "let us briefly sketch how the proposed method for renormalization works . restricting for simplicity to the 1 + 1-dimensional case , it involves the following steps :    * consider a sufficiently large system on a chain with @xmath0 sites and periodic boundary conditions starting with a homogeneously active state _ at criticality_. +",
    "* read out the configuration of active sites at time @xmath1 and divide the chain into blocks of equal size  @xmath2 . a block containing at least one active site",
    "is called active ( 1 ) and otherwise inactive ( 0 ) , giving a string of @xmath3 bits .",
    "+ * scan the bit string cyclically in order to estimate the probability @xmath4 to find @xmath5  randomly selected adjacent blocks with the bit pattern @xmath6 .",
    "for example , three adjacent blocks can have eight different patterns  @xmath7 .",
    "this procedure is carried out at different times @xmath1 and for different block sizes @xmath2 , averaging over many runs to reduce statistical fluctuations .",
    "note that the underlying process is not affected , all what is needed is to read out the configurations in regular time intervals and to process this data in a separate procedure in order to estimate @xmath4 .",
    "the probabilities @xmath4 will depend on both the block size @xmath2 and the actual time  @xmath1 .",
    "however , as will be shown below , the _ ratios _ of these probabilities saturate and can be extrapolated to @xmath8 .",
    "these block - size - dependent extrapolated probability ratios in turn converge to well - defined _ universal _ values in the limit @xmath9 , providing a whole set of universal numbers which can be viewed as a fingerprint of the underlying universality class . with these numbers denoted as @xmath10 , which are as robust as critical exponents , it is possible to identify a universality class in a reliable way .",
    "the purpose of any block renormalization scheme is to organize the elementary degrees of freedom ( the lattice sites ) into equal groups and to replace the individual states inside each group by a single effective state of the same kind .",
    "this coarse - graining has to be done in such a way that the symmetries of the model are preserved .",
    "for example , in wilson s block renormalization scheme for the one - dimensional ising model the spins are grouped in pairs .",
    "one of the two spins is taken as the effective spin of the block while the other spin is integrated out and absorbed into the effective interaction of two neighboring blocks .",
    "obviously , this procedure preserves the global @xmath11-symmetry of the ising model .    devising a similar method for models with absorbing state transitions",
    ", the coarse - graining procedure should respect the most salient feature of such models , namely , the existence of an absorbing state .",
    "an absorbing state is a configuration that can be reached but not be left and therefore plays the role of a dynamical trap .",
    "consequently any renormalization procedure should map a locally absorbing configuration of lattice sites onto an absorbing effective state of the block and conversely every non - absorbing configuration onto an active effective state .",
    "in other words , the renormalization procedure has to preserve the property of ` being absorbing ' .",
    "+ many models with absorbing phase transitions are two - state models , where each lattice site @xmath12 carries a binary bit  @xmath130,1@xmath14 , denoting inactive and active sites , respectively .",
    "the renormalization procedure outlined above groups these bits into equal - sized blocks , assigning to each block an effective state in form of a single bit which is again either 0 or 1 .",
    "therefore , the desired map has to be a boolean function .    since the renormalization procedure has to preserve the absorbing state , a locally absorbing configuration 00",
    "... 0 has to be mapped to 0 .",
    "conversely , any non - absorbing configuration , where the block contains at least one active site , has to be mapped to 1 . obviously , the only boolean function with this property is a logical or .",
    "thus we can conclude that any block renormalization scheme for two - state systems with a single absorbing state should be based on a logical or of the individual degrees of freedom .",
    "[ fig : rg ]    the coarse - graining procedure by a logical or can be implemented in different ways . in the following",
    "we will use it to renormalize spatial configuration ( snapshots ) of the system at a certain instance of time , as sketched in fig .",
    "[ fig : rg ] .",
    "after renormalization one obtains coarse - grained bit patterns of adjacent block variables . the aim is to analyze their probability distribution , to study possible universal properties , and to use the results in order to identify the underlying universality class of the process .",
    "+ the critical properties of absorbing phase transitions are well described by a phenomenological scaling theory  @xcite .",
    "starting point is the postulate that such systems are invariant under anisotropic scale transformations @xmath15 where @xmath16 is a spatial scale factor , @xmath17 denotes the coarse - grained density of active sites , and @xmath18 denotes the distance from criticality in the control parameter @xmath19 .",
    "apart from few exceptions  @xcite , time and space scale differently , expressed by a dynamical exponent @xmath20 .",
    "thus the scaling behavior of such a system is determined by three independent critical exponents @xmath21 from which all other bulk exponents can be derived by simple scaling relations which is associated with the conjugate order parameter . however , in most cases a time reversal symmetry implies @xmath22 , see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite . ] .    by grouping @xmath2 lattice sites into blocks the lattice spacing @xmath23 increases by @xmath24 .",
    "this means that the spatial coordinate @xmath25 in eq .",
    "( [ rescaling ] ) , which measures the distance in units of the lattice spacing , decreases by @xmath26 .",
    "therefore , the scale factor of each renormalization step is @xmath27 so that the quantities discussed above are expected to scale as @xmath28 note that the density of active blocks increases under coarse - graining , reflecting the fact that a logical or can only increase the density of active blocks , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : rg ] . moreover , the last equation @xmath29 tells us that the distance from criticality effectively increases under renormalization , driving the system away from criticality . +",
    "suppose that we have read out the configuration of the system at time @xmath1 and arranged it into blocks of size @xmath2 as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : rg ] . scanning over the resulting bit pattern ( and averaging over several runs )",
    "we can now estimate the probability @xmath4 to find @xmath5 randomly selected adjacent blocks in the configuration @xmath30 . by definition , these probabilities are normalized by @xmath31 .",
    "how do these probabilities decay asymptotically as functions of time ? to answer this question we first note that @xmath32 is just the density of active sites on the original lattice , hence this quantity is known to decay as @xmath33 where @xmath34 .",
    "if the renormalization scheme outlined above works properly , the same should hold for all single - bit quantities after coarse - graining , i.e. we expect them to decay asymptotically as @xmath35 for arbitrary block sizes @xmath2 , differing only by a @xmath2-dependent proportionality factor in front of the power law .",
    "this observation can be confirmed easily by numerical simulations .",
    "let us now turn to the two - bit probabilities .",
    "on the one hand , @xmath36 and @xmath37 are restricted by the normalization condition and the left - right symmetry @xmath38 on the other hand , the renormalization mapping by a logical or can be expressed as @xmath39 finally , tracing out the second bit one obtains the relation @xmath40 with the same power law as in ( [ eq : norm ] ) but with a smaller proportionality factor .",
    "these four equations imply that the two - bit probabilities with non - vanishing bit patterns ( i.e. @xmath41 , @xmath42 , and @xmath43 ) decay asymptotically in the same way as the density of active sites @xmath44 , but with different prefactors in front of the power law .",
    "[ fig : decaydemo ]    similarly all @xmath5-bit probabilities for arbitrary block sizes @xmath2 are found to decay asymptotically in the same way as the density of active sites , i.e. , @xmath45 this is demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : decaydemo ] in the case of dp , where we plotted the decay of the four - bit probabilities for two different block sizes .",
    "note that this common type of algebraic decay sets in only when the correlation length of the process exceeds the size of the block sequence , i.e. @xmath46 .",
    "this requires a simulation time @xmath47 , where @xmath48 is the dynamical exponent of the process under consideration .",
    "+ since all probabilities @xmath4 with @xmath49 decay asymptotically in the same way , any quotient of these quantities will saturate at some constant value in the limit @xmath50 . as a convenient choice we decided to study the ratios @xmath51 where we used the normalization condition in the denominator .",
    "these quantities can be interpreted as the _ conditional _ probability to find @xmath5 subsequent blocks of size  @xmath2 in the bit pattern @xmath52 , given that at least one of the blocks is active . by definition , they are normalized by @xmath53 as discussed before , the conditional probabilities tend to a constant @xmath54 in the limit @xmath8 . in this way we have defined stationary block probabilities in a non - stationary process .",
    "+        since the conditional probabilities @xmath55 can be viewed as some kind of short - range correlation functions , we expect them to be non - universal , reflecting the microscopic details of the dynamics . however , the main message of this paper is the observation that the block renormalization procedure introduced above drives the conditional probabilities towards certain universal values which depend only on the large - scale critical behavior of the process under consideration .",
    "this means that the conditional probabilities converge to well - defined universal values @xmath56 in the limit of large block sizes .",
    "note that this limit has to be carried out _ after _ taking @xmath57 since the two limits ( [ eq : timelimit ] ) and ( [ eq : limitblocksize ] ) do not commute .    as will be demonstrated in the following section , it is possible to carry out the two - fold non - commuting limit in numerical simulations which allows one to estimate the numbers @xmath10 , following the sequence of steps shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : mainsteps ] .",
    "as mentioned before , these numbers can be viewed as a fingerprint of the underlying universality class . since our method",
    "can be applied to any models with absorbing states , we can use these numbers to verify whether a given process belongs to a certain universality class or not . + as will be shown now , the universal two - bit probabilities @xmath58 are special in so far as they can be expressed exactly in terms of the critical exponents . to see this recall that @xmath59 is the density of active sites , while @xmath60 is the renormalized density of active sites , defined as the probability to find at least one active site in a block of size @xmath2 .",
    "according to eq .",
    "( [ rescaling2 ] ) this quantity is expected to scale as @xmath61 as @xmath62 .",
    "this asymptotic power law implies the identity @xmath63 using the exact relations @xmath64 and @xmath65 this identity can be rewritten as @xmath66 together with the normalization condition and spatial reflection symmetry we obtain a system of three equations @xmath67 with the exact solution @xmath68 if the critical exponents are known , this allows us to predict the two - bit quantities and to verify the accuracy of the method in a numerical simulation . in the remaining part of this article we use monte carlo simulations to do the same for two well known universality classes of absorbing phase transitions , namely directed percolation and parity conserving class .",
    "note that the conditional probabilities with three or more bits can not be calculated in this way since the scaling laws do not provide enough equations .",
    "this is good news since these probabilities provide additional information in form of universal numbers which are independent of the usual critical exponents . from the numerical simulations we also estimate these universal numbers for the above mentioned classes .",
    "for directed percolation in one dimension the best known estimates of the critical exponents are  @xcite @xmath69     [ fig:2bit ]    inserting these estimates into eq .",
    "( [ eq : exact1 ] ) and  ( [ eq : exact2 ] ) we can compute the conditional two - bit probabilities @xmath70 let us now demonstrate how these values can be obtained numerically by performing the two non - commuting limits @xmath50 and @xmath9 . to this end",
    "we simulate an ordinary bond dp process starting with a fully occupied lattice over @xmath71 monte carlo sweeps . in certain intervals we read out the actual configuration and",
    "apply the suggested renormalization scheme , reducing @xmath2 bits to a single bit by a logical or operation .",
    "scanning over the resulting bit string and averaging over many runs , we estimate the conditional probabilities @xmath72 as a function of time for the block sizes @xmath73 and @xmath74 .    as shown in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig:2bit ] , these probabilities tend to certain asymptotic values @xmath55 as @xmath1 is increased .",
    "it turns out that the difference @xmath75 decays asymptotically as @xmath76 , - a numerical observation for which we do not yet have an explanation .",
    "hence , by plotting @xmath72 versus @xmath76 we can easily extrapolate the curves to the limit @xmath57 .",
    "the extrapolated values for @xmath55 are then plotted in the right panel of  fig .",
    "[ fig:2bit ] . in order to perform the second limit @xmath62 it is again useful to plot these values versus @xmath77 and to estimate the limit @xmath78 by linear extrapolation .",
    "as can be seen , this procedure accurately reproduces the predicted values in eq .",
    "( [ eq : exactnumerical ] ) which are indicated by arrows in the figure . + in order to demonstrate the universal character of the extrapolated conditional probabilities @xmath10 in the case of bit patterns with more than two bits , we measured the 3-bit quantities for various frequently used models in the directed percolation class , namely the contact process with random sequential updates , bond dp , site dp and wolframs rule w18 ( see  @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : compare ] , these models produce different values for @xmath55 but they converge towards the same value as the block size is taken to infinity , confirming the universality hypothesis .",
    "surprisingly the contact process and bond percolation produce almost identical results , indicating that they are probably characterized by very similar non - universal short - range correlations .",
    "[ fig : compare ]    moreover , we studied the domany - kinzel ( dk ) model  @xcite along its critical line parametrized by @xmath79 and @xmath80 , searching for a point where the deviation for small block sizes is minimal ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : compare ] ) . without going into detail",
    "we would like to report that this optimal point is located at @xmath81 and @xmath82 .",
    "we expect that this transition point of the critical line is characterized by minimal corrections to scaling .",
    "parity conserving ( pc ) models belong to a universality class of absorbing state transitions different from dp .",
    "the defining feature of this class of systems is that the dynamics conserves the number of particles modulo @xmath83 which is referred to as the _ parity _ of the system .",
    "there are several variants of parity conserving models which are all characterized by the critical exponents  @xcite @xmath84 to apply the block renormalization procedure for the pc class , one needs to make sure that the renormalization scheme also respects the additional microscopic symmetry present in the system , _",
    "i.e. _ the conservation of parity",
    ". this can be ensured if the reduction of a block of length @xmath2 to a single site keeps the parity of that block unchanged .",
    "this is not possible with a two - state model , where a bit obtained by reducing a block does not carry any information about the parity . instead one needs three states , namely , the inactive state and two active states indicating whether a block contains an even or odd number of particles .    in this spirit",
    "we devise a parity - conserving three state model with an absorbing phase transition .",
    "as will be discussed below , this model renders itself easily to the scheme of block renormalization without hampering the parity of the original configuration .",
    "the model is defined on a one - dimensional periodic lattice , where each lattice site  @xmath12 is either empty or occupied by an odd or even number of particles , corresponding to the state variables @xmath85 and @xmath83 , respectively .",
    "the system evolves in time according to the following dynamical rules ,    @xmath86    this dynamics either adds or removes a pair particles , keeping the parity of the system conserved .",
    "the only absorbing configuration is @xmath87 since any occupied site is considered as active .",
    "the order parameter @xmath17 is the density of active sites , not the density of particles in the system .",
    "this system shows an absorbing state transition belonging to the pc class defined by the critical exponents ( [ eq : pc ] ) at the critical point @xmath88 the parity - conserving variant of the block renormalization scheme can be applied to this model as follows .",
    "a block of length @xmath2 is replaced by a single site with the state    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ [ cols= \" < , < \" , ]",
    "in this paper we have introduced a simple renormalization scheme suitable for systems with absorbing states . for two - state systems",
    "the renormalization step involves a logical or of the elementary degrees of freedom .",
    "the scheme can be applied in any space dimension to spatial as well as spatio - temporal configurations .",
    "the present work is restricted to the analysis of spatial configurations in 1 + 1 dimensions .",
    "it is shown that in a critical process with homogeneous initial conditions all block probabilities @xmath4 for non - vanishing configurations decay asymptotically as  @xmath89 , differing only by their proportionality constants , which means that their ratios will tend to certain constants as @xmath50 .",
    "this allows us to define ( non - universal ) ratios @xmath90 which depend only on the block size . as the renormalization procedure has the tendency to suppress non - universal microscopic details , these quantities converge to _ universal _ values @xmath10 in the limit of large block sizes",
    "it is important to keep in mind that the two limits , @xmath50 and @xmath9 , do not commute .    using the examples of directed percolation and the parity - conserving class , we have demonstrated that the universal numbers are as robust as the critical exponent and therefore characterize the underlying universality class of the process like a fingerprint .",
    "the two - bit quantities turn out to depend on the critical exponents by exact scaling relations , providing a numerical test for the accuracy of the method .",
    "the three- and four - bit quantities , however , render larger sets of universal numbers which are independent of the critical exponents . by comparing the numerical estimates for a given model with the values listed in table 1",
    ", this method provides a very sensitive test to which of the universality classes the phase transition belongs . as renormalization drives a system away from criticality",
    ", we note that it is crucial for the method to use a very accurate estimate of the critical point .",
    "the proposed method could shed new light onto nonequilibrium processes whose critical behavior is still debated in the literature .",
