    "while the total intensity of the cosmic far infrared background ( cfirb ) is known from absolute photometry measurements @xcite , we still lack a complete knowledge of the sources , in the form of dusty star - forming galaxies , that make up the background . limited by aperture sizes and the resulting source confusion noise @xcite , existing deep surveys with the _ herschel _ space observatory ( pilbratt et al .",
    "2010 ) and ground - based sub - mm and mm - wave instruments resolve anywhere between 5 and 15% of the background into individual galaxies @xcite .",
    "anisotropies of the cfirb , or the spatial fluctuations of the background intensity , provide additional statistical information on the fainter galaxies , especially those that make up the bulk of the background .",
    "while the fainter galaxies are individually undetected , due to gravitational growth and evolution in the large - scale structure these galaxies are expected to be clustered @xcite . in the ansatz of the halo model @xcite",
    "such clustering of galaxies captures certain properties of the dark matter halos in which galaxies are found and the statistics of how those galaxies occupy the dark matter halos .",
    "the resulting anisotropies of the cfirb are then a reflection of the spatial clustering of galaxies and their infrared luminosity .",
    "these cfirb anisotropies , are best studied from the angular power spectrum of the background infrared light .",
    "separately , statistics such as the probability of deflection , @xmath4 @xcite , probe the variance and higher order cumulant statistics of the intensity variations at the beam scale .    while early attempts to measure the angular power spectrum of the cfirb resulted in low signal - to - noise measurements @xcite , a first clear detection of the cfirb power spectrum with _ herschel_-spire ( griffin et al .",
    "2010 ) maps between 30 arcseconds and 30 arcminute angular scales was reported in @xcite .",
    "those first measurements also confirmed the interpretation that galaxies at the peak epoch of star formation in the universe at redshifts of 1 to 3 trace the underlying dark matter halo distribution . since then",
    ", additional measurements of the cfirb power spectrum have come from planck @xcite and with additional spire maps from the hermes survey @xcite . with multiple fields spanning up to 20 deg@xmath5 ,",
    "recent hermes cfirb power spectra probe angular scales of about 30 to 2@xmath6 .",
    "the halo model interpretation of the hermes spectra suggest that the halo mass scale for peak star - formation activity is @xmath7 and the minimum halo mass to host dusty galaxies is @xmath8 .",
    "the angular power spectrum of cfirb , in principle , captures the spatial distribution of the background intensity , regardless of whether the emission is from individual point sources or from smoothly varying diffuse sources , such as intracluster and intrahalo dust .",
    "thus the angular power spectrum should be a sensitive probe of the total dust content in the universe .",
    "the existing estimes of the dust abundance from direct emission measurements make use of the sub - mm luminosity ( e.g. , dunne , eales & edmunds 2003 ) or dust mass ( e.g. , dunne et al . 2011 ) functions , they are generally based out of extrapolations of the measured bright galaxy counts .",
    "the anisotropy power spectrum should capture the integrated emission from faint sources , especially at the flux density scale that dominate the confusion noise . separately ,",
    "other estimates of the cosmic dust abundance rely on the extinction of optical light , especially with measurements that combine magnification and extinction of quasars behind samples of foreground galaxies @xcite",
    ". it will be helpful to compare our direct emission measurement of the dust abundance with the extinction - based estimates since any differences can allow us to understand the important of galaxies with hot dust that could be missed in spire maps .",
    "we make use of a halo model to interpret the anisotropy power spectrum with the goal of measuring @xmath9 , the cosmic abundance of dust relative to the critical density , as a function of redshift .",
    "to enable these measurements we make use of the wide field ( @xmath10 45 deg@xmath5 ) maps of _ herschel_-atlas ( eales et al .",
    "2010 ) in the three gama areas along the equator , and select a single area that has the least galactic cirrus confusion .",
    "this gama-15 field involves 4 independent blocks of about 14 deg@xmath5 , each overlapping with the adjacent blocks by about 4 deg@xmath5 .",
    "we make use of the three overlap areas between the blocks to measure the power spectra at 250 , 350 and 500@xmath0 m .",
    "the final power spectrum is the average of the individual power spectra of each of the overlapping regions .",
    "while this forces us to make a measurement over a smaller area than the total survey area , our power spectrum measurement has the advantage that with two sets of cross - linked scans we can make independent measurements of the noise power spectrum .",
    "our measurement approach is similar to that used for hermes power spectra measurements ( amblard et al .",
    "2011 ; viero et al .",
    "2012 ) using multiple scans to generate jack - knives of data to test the noise model .",
    "the total area used in hermes measurements is about 12 and 60 deg@xmath5 , respectively , in amblard et al .",
    "( 2011 ) and viero et al .",
    "however , h - atlas covers about 120 deg@xmath5 in all three gama fields a measurement of the power spectrum in the whole of h - atlas gama areas requires an assumption about the noise power spectrum , since in regions with only one orthogonal scan or a single cross - linkeds scan , we are not able to separate the noise from the signal with data alone . in a future paper , we will present the power spectrum of the whole area using a noise model that is independently tested on various datasets to improve the confidence in separating noise in single cross - link scans . for",
    "now , we make use of two cross - link scans for cross - correlations and auto - correlations to separate noise and sky signal .    this paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : mapmaking ] , we briefly review how 250 , 350 and 500@xmath11 maps for the gama-15 field were constructed using hipe @xcite from raw time streams . in section  [ sec : powerspec ] , we discuss how the auto and cross - correlation functions for each of the three fields were estimated , corrected , and assigned errors .",
    "the final power spectra are presented in section  [ sec : powerspec_results ] . the halo model used to fit the data and the luminosity function",
    "is discussed in section  [ sec : halomodel ] .",
    "finally , in section  [ sec : results ] & [ sec : conclusion ] we present our results and their implications , discuss future follow up work and give our concluding thoughts .",
    "for this work we generate spire maps using the madmap @xcite algorithm that is available within hipe .",
    "the timeline data were reduced internally by the h - atlas team using hipe version 8.2.0 @xcite .",
    "the timelines were calibrated with corrections applied for the temperature - drift and deglitched both manually and automatically .",
    "astrometry corrections were also applied to the timelines using offsets between sdss sources and the cross - identifications @xcite .",
    "in addition , a scan - by - scan baseline polynomial remover was applied to remove gain variations leading to possible stripes .",
    "the map - maker , madmap , converts the timeline data @xmath12 @xmath13 with noise @xmath14 and sky signal @xmath15 , given the pointing matrix @xmath16 between pixel and time domain to a map by solving the equation @xmath17 here @xmath18 is the time noise covariance matrix and @xmath19 is the pixel domain maximum likelihood estimate of the noiseless signal map given @xmath18 and @xmath20 .",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite for more details of madmap .",
    "the final maps we use for this work consist of four partially overlapping tiles , each containing two sets of 96 scans in orthogonal directions ( fig .  1 ) .",
    "the pixel - scale for the 250 , 350 and 500@xmath0 m maps is 6 , 8.333 and 12 , respectively , corresponding to @xmath21 of the beam size .    in regions where the tiles do not overlap ,",
    "the map at each wavelength consists of a single scan each in the two orthogonal scan directions . in the overlap region",
    ", we have two scans in each direction .",
    "as discussed below , we are able to estimate the noise and signal power spectra independent of each other using the auto - correlations of the combined 4-scan map and the cross - correlations involving various jack - knife combinations . in fig .",
    "2 we show an example overlap region .     of the gama-15 overlap regions at 250 ( top ) , 350 ( middle ) and 500 ( bottom ) @xmath0 m , respectively .",
    "the green points show the auto - power spectra computed from overlap regions using all 4 scans .",
    "this power spectrum is a combination of the real sky anisotropy power spectrum and the instrumental noise .",
    "we estimate the sky signal independent of noise by creating two sets of maps for each of the three overlap regions with two orthogonal scans each and then taking the cross power spectrum ( red points ) of those independent maps .",
    "the difference of these two spectra shows the instrumental noise power spectrum ( black points ) . ]",
    "we now discuss the measurement of angular anisotropy power spectra in each of the three spire bands . to be consistent with previous measurements of the spire angular power spectrum @xcite our maps",
    "are masked by taking a 50 mjy / beam flux cut and then convolving with the point response function .",
    "such a flux cut , through a mask that removes the bright galaxies , also minimizes the bias coming from those bright sources by reducing shot - noise effects .",
    "the same mask also includes a small number of pixels that do not contain any useful data , either due to scan strategy or data corruption .",
    "the combined mask removes roughly 13 , 12 and 15% of the pixels at 250 , 350 and 500@xmath0 m , respectively .",
    "the fractions of masked pixels are substantially higher than the fractions of amblard et al .",

    "( 2011 ) study .",
    "these galaxies tend to be brighter , especially at 250@xmath0 m .",
    "while the fraction masked is larger , the total number of pixels used for this study is comparable to amblard et al .",
    "( 2011 ) with @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 at 250 , 350 and 500@xmath11 in each of the three overlap regions .    to measure the power spectrum in the final set of maps , we make use of 2d fourier transforms . in general this",
    "is done with masked maps of the overlap regions , denoted @xmath26 and @xmath27 in real space . if we denote the 2d fourier transform of each map as @xmath28 and @xmath29 , the power spectrum , @xmath30 , formed for a specific @xmath31 bin between between @xmath31-modes @xmath32 and @xmath33 , is the mean of the squared fourier modes @xmath34 between @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "the same can be used to describe the auto power spectra , but with @xmath35 .",
    "the raw power spectra are summarized in fig .",
    ", we show the auto spectra in the total map , as well as the cross spectrum with maps made with half of the time - ordered data in each map .",
    "the difference of the two provides us with an estimate of the instrumental noise . at small angular scales ( large @xmath36 values )",
    "the noise follows a white - noise power spectrum , with @xmath30 equal to a constant . at large angular scales ,",
    "the detectors show the expected @xmath37-type of noise behavior , with the noise power spectrum rising as @xmath38 .",
    "we fit a model of the form @xmath39 \\ , , \\ ] ] and determine the knee - scale of the @xmath37 noise and the amplitude of noise power spectra .",
    "the noise values are @xmath40 and @xmath41 jy@xmath5/sr at 250 , 350 and 500@xmath0 m , comparable to the detector noise in the 4-scan maps of the lockman - hole used in amblard et al .",
    "the knee at which @xmath37 noise becomes important is @xmath42 and 3370 , comparable to the expected knee at a wavenumber of 0.15 arcmin@xmath43 given the scan rate and the known properties of the detectors @xcite .",
    "the raw spectra we have computed directly from the masked maps are contaminated by several different effects that must be corrected for .",
    "these issues are : the resolution damping from the instrumental beam , the filtering in the map - making process , and the fictitious correlations introduced by the bright source and corrupt pixel mask . including these effects ,",
    "we can write the measured power spectrum as @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the observed power spectrum from the masked map , @xmath46 is the beam function measured in a map , @xmath47 is the map - making transfer function , and @xmath48 is the mode coupling matrix resulting from the mask . here , @xmath49 is the true sky power spectrum and is determined by inverting the above equation .",
    "we now briefly discuss the ways in which we either determine or correct for the effects just outlined .     for the madmap map making tool used for the gama-15 field anisotropy power spectrum measurement .",
    "the uncertainties in the transfer function are calculated from 100 random realizations of the sky as described in section  3.1 . ]     for one of the overlap regions ( log scale ) . ]      due to the finite number of detectors , the scan pattern , and the resulting analysis technique to convert timeline data into a map , the map we produce is not an exact representation of the sky .",
    "the modifications are associated with the map - making process , relative to the true sky , are described by the transfer function @xmath47 .",
    "we determine this by making 100 random realizations of the sky using gaussian random fields derived from a first estimate of the h - atlas power spectrum .",
    "we sample those skies using the same timeline data as the actual observations and analyze the simulated timelines with the same data reduction and map - making hipe scripts for the actual data .",
    "we then compute the average of the ratio between the estimated power spectra and the input spectrum .",
    "this function is then the transfer function associated with polynomial filtering and the map - making process .",
    "this transfer function , like the beam , represents a multiplicative correction to the data .",
    "we divide the estimated power spectrum of the data by this transfer function to remove the map - making pipeline processing effects .    in fig .",
    "4 we show the transfer functions at 250 , 350 and 500@xmath0 m with 68% error bars taken from the standard deviation of 100 simulations .",
    "the transfer function is such that it turns over from 1 at both large angular scales , corresponding to roughly the scale of an individual scan length , and the beam scale . the large - scale deviation , which is wavelength independent , is due to the polynomial removal from each timeline of data , while the turnover at small angular scales is due to the cut - off imposed by the instrumental point response function or the beam .",
    "the transfer function is more uncertain at the large angular scales due to the finite number of simulations and the associated cosmic variance resulting from the field size . given its multiplicative nature , errors from this transfer function are added in quadrature with rest of the errors .",
    "following amblard et al .",
    "( 2011 ) , the beam function is derived from neptune observations of spire . the neptune timeline data are analyzed with the same pipeline and our default map maker in hipe .",
    "the resulting beam functions are similar to those of amblard et al .",
    "( 2011 ) and we find no detectable changes resulting from the two different map makers between this work and the smap @xcite pipeline of the spire instrument team used in amblard et al .",
    "( 2011 ) and viero et al .",
    "this is primarily due to the fact that the beam measurements involve a large number of scans and neptune is several orders of magnitude brighter than the extragalactic confusion noise .",
    "we interpolate the beam function measured from neptune maps in the same @xmath36 modes at which we compute our anisotropy power spectra .",
    "this beam transfer function , @xmath46 , at each of the wavelengths represents a multiplicative correction to the data .",
    "similar to amblard et al .",
    "( 2011 ) , we compute the uncertainty in the beam function by computing the standard deviation of several different estimates of the beam function by subdividing the scan data to 4 different sets . the error on the beam function in fourier space is propagated to the final error and is added in quadrature with rest of the errors .",
    "the third correction we must make to the raw power spectrum involves the removing of fictitious correlations between modes introduced by the bright sources and contaminated or zero - data pixel mask . due to this mask",
    "the 2d fourier transforms are measured in maps with holes in them . in the power spectrum",
    "these holes result in a fourier mode coupling that biases the power spectrum lower at large angular scales and higher at smaller angular scales .",
    "this can be understood since the modes at the largest angular scales , like the mean of the map , are broken up into smaller scale modes with any non - trivial mask .    to correct for the mask we make use of the method used in @xcite .",
    "the method involves capturing the effects of the mask on the power spectrum into a mode - coupling matrix @xmath48 .",
    "the inverse of the mode coupling matrix then removes the contamination and corrects the raw power spectrum to a power spectrum that should be measurable in an unmasked sky .",
    "the correction both restores the power back to the large angular scale modes by shifting the power away from the small angular scale modes , especially those at the modulation scale introduced by the mask .    to generate @xmath48",
    "we apply the mask to a map consisting of a gaussian realization of a single @xmath31-mode and take the power spectrum of the resulting map .",
    "this power spectrum represents the shuffling of power the mask performs on this specific @xmath31-mode among the other @xmath31-modes .",
    "this process is repeated for all @xmath31-modes and these effects of the mask on each mode are then stored in a matrix .",
    "this matrix , @xmath48 now represents the transformation from an unmasked to a masked sky by construction . by inverting this matrix , shown in fig . 5 ,",
    "we are left with the transformation from a masked to an unmasked sky removing the fictitious couplings induced by the mask applied to the raw power spectra .",
    "the matrix @xmath48 behaves such that in the limit of no @xmath50mode coupling @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the fraction of the sky covered .",
    "thus in the limit of partial sky coverage the correction becomes the standard formula with @xmath53 . for more details , including figures demonstrating the robustness of the method , we refer the reader to @xcite .",
    "the final power spectrum @xmath30 at each of the three wavelengths is shown in fig .",
    "6 ( left panels ) .",
    "the final error bars account for the uncertainties associated with the ( a ) beam , ( b ) map making transfer function , ( c ) instrumental or detector noise ( fig .",
    "3 ) , and the cosmic variance associated with the finite sky coverage of the field . in fig .",
    "6 we compare these final h - atlas gama-15 power spectra with measurements of the cfirb anisotropy power spectrum measurements from hermes ( amblard et al . 2011 ) and planck ( planck collaboration 2011 ) team measurements .",
    "we find general agreement , but we also find some differences . at 250@xmath0 m , we find the amplitude to be larger than the existing spire measurements of the power spectrum at 250@xmath0 m in hermes while the measurements are more consistent at 350 and 500@xmath0 m .",
    "we attribute this increase to the wide coverage of h - atlas and the presence of a large surface density of galaxies at low redshifts .",
    "while most of these galaxies are masked we find that the fainter population likely remains unmasked and contributes to the increase in the power that we have seen .",
    "this conclusion is also consistent with the strong cross - correlation between detected spire sources in gama fields of h - atlas and the sdss redshift survey ( e.g. , guo et al .",
