    "the hamiltonian formulation of classical mechanics assigns simultaneous , arbitrarily accurate , values for the canonically conjugate position and momentum to distinguishable particles .",
    "indeed in classical mechanics these simultaneous values are regarded as properties of the particles themselves ; measurement simply reveals these values and need not , in principle , add uncertainty to their determination . in quantum mechanics the conjugate position and momentum are represented by noncommuting operators , @xmath0 and @xmath1 , with @xmath2=i\\hbar$ ] .",
    "it follows that there is no physical state for which position and momentum can take dispersion free values .",
    "this is the content of the standard formulation of the uncertainty principle @xmath3 , where @xmath4 .",
    "this does not mean , however , that simultaneous measurements of position and momentum are impossible , only that such simultaneous measurements can not be made arbitrarily accurate @xcite .",
    "our objective is to show that the _ observed _ phase space , reconstructed from the classical stochastic measurement record of continuous joint measurements of position and momentum , corresponds to the classical phase space description with added noise . by a careful specification of the measurement model , including the relevant states of the apparatus , together with a markov assumption ,",
    "we show that the observed classical stochastic measurement record corresponds to the conditional quantum averages @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "we obtain a stochastic schrdinger equation for the conditional state of the system with complex noise , together with classical stochastic equations for the variables corresponding to the observed measurement records .",
    "this extends the results of bhattacharya et al .",
    "@xcite where only a position measurement was considered .",
    "other authors @xcite have considered a general type of stochastic schrdinger equation ( which may be interpreted as corresponding to a measurement ) in the framework of _ quantum state diffusion _ to examine dissipative chaos in open systems .    a model for the simultaneous measurement of position and momentum was given long ago by arthurs and kelly @xcite .",
    "this model consists of two meters which are allowed to interact instantaneously with the system .",
    "the interaction couples one of the meters to position and the other to momentum , encoding the results of the measurement in the final states of the meters . projective measurements",
    "are then made on each of the meter states separately . in more general terms",
    "the arthurs - kelly model is an explicit example of the gelfand - naimark - segal theorem @xcite which enables us to write a positive joint probability density of two real variables ( the actual measurement outcomes ) in terms of an inner product on an extended hilbert space ( extended to include the two apparatus as well as the system to be measured ) .",
    "it can also be considered as an example of a _ positive operator valued measure _ @xcite .",
    "the arthurs - kelly model suggests a route to a phase space description of quantum mechanics based on the joint outcomes of simultaneous measurements of position and momentum .",
    "however , to achieve a phase space description of the dynamics it is necessary to consider a time sequence of such measurements .",
    "the arthurs - kelly model forces the conditional state of the system into a coherent state after a single measurement and is too strong for this purpose .",
    "we generalize the arthurs - kelly model to allow for a weakening of the measurement . in this way",
    "repeated measurements can take place without invariably reducing the system to a coherent state . by simultaneously increasing the number of measurements and weakening the strength of each measurement ,",
    "the continuous limit is achieved .",
    "we show that under continuous observation the evolution of the system state is described by an it stochastic schrdinger equation . unlike evolution via the ordinary schrdinger equation ,",
    "continuous observation forces the conditional state of the system to remain localized .",
    "hence the quantum mean of the phase space variables can be thought of as a trajectory .",
    "it is in this light that we investigate quantum nonlinear dynamics under continuous observation .",
    "the theory of continuous measurement in quantum mechanics was first developed by barchielli and co - workers @xcite ( see also @xcite ) and some of the results in this paper are contained in their work",
    ". however our approach uses the arthurs - kelly measurement model as a starting point and follows the work on continuous position measurements by caves and one of us in @xcite . in this way our results have a clear physical interpretation .    in section",
    "ii we generalize the arthurs - kelly measurement model . in section",
    "iii we derive the stochastic schrdinger equation for continuous measurement which is then investigated analytically in section iv and simulated numerically in section v for a chaotic system . finally , in section vi we discuss our results",

    "@xcite we rederive and generalize the result implicit in the work of arthurs and kelly @xcite .",
    "the simultaneous measurement of position and momentum of a one dimensional quantum system is achieved by constructing an interaction governed by the hamiltonian @xmath7 which couples the system hamiltonian @xmath8 , with two detectors @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "the measurement model also requires that the detectors have been prepared in the initial states @xmath11 where @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "the parameter @xmath14 is called the _ squeezing parameter _ and biases the coupling so that one may obtain more information on either position or momentum .",
    "the parameter @xmath15 will be used to weaken the measurement , decreasing the amount of information collected on both position and momentum .    before the interaction the system state @xmath16 and the combined detector state @xmath17",

    "note that @xmath52 and @xmath53 are charged by stationary white noise @xmath121 making their graph highly irregular .",
    "it is thus better to represent the measured trajectory by @xmath122 and @xmath123 .",
    "we will now investigate the effect of measurement on the system state by setting @xmath124 and defining @xmath125 where @xmath126 and @xmath127 are the expected variances in position and momentum , and @xmath128 is the expected covariance between position and momentum .",
    "the average is taken over all possible measurement histories .",
    "one can then derive the following set of coupled differential equations : @xmath129 the solutions of which are @xmath130 where @xmath131 , @xmath132 and @xmath133 .",
    "hence the process of measurement induces the system state to collapse into a coherent state . if the measurement retrieves no information on momentum , i.e. @xmath78 , then @xmath134 and the growth in the momentum variance is unbounded .",
    "similarly , if the measurement retrieves no information on position then the position variance grows unbounded .",
    "however , when both position and momentum are measured simultaneously the system state is forced into a coherent state .",
    "when @xmath135 we expect that for a suitable choice of @xmath136 , any spreading of the quantum wavepacket caused by nonlinearities in the hamiltonian will be counteracted by the measurement induced localization .",
    "one might naively assume that if the measurement only retrieves information on position ( or momentum ) then the state will not localize .",
    "however this is not always the case .",
    "note that when @xmath137 in equation ( [ vp ] ) the momentum variance will initially decrease .",
    "thus if the system dynamics is such that it increases the covariance between position and momentum , then the continuous measurement of position may also localize momentum .",
    "for example , consider the hamiltonian describing free particle motion , @xmath138 .",
    "when @xmath78 the variances and covariance satisfy @xmath139 although we could not solve these equations analytically , it is easy to see that all physical solutions asymptotically attract to the stable fixed point @xmath140 hence , measurement of position does not introduce a diffusion in momentum , and the state localizes ( this result has been derived previously in @xcite ) .",
    "however , for free particle motion , if we only measure momentum the state does not localize .",
    "the system dynamics accelerates the growth in the position variance .",
    "see @xcite for more on localization .",
    "we will now numerically investigate the solution of the stochastic schrdinger equation ( [ stochschro ] ) for the driven system @xmath141 the numerical method to solve this equation is simple . to take advantage of",
    "the measurement induced localization we use a local moving number basis @xmath142 truncated at some finite value @xmath143 .",
    "the stochastic terms are integrated using the first - order euler method while other terms are integrated by diagonalizing the position and momentum operators and using the split - operator formula .",
    "we will first consider an integrable case when @xmath144 , @xmath145 , @xmath146 and @xmath147 .",
    "the initial state was chosen to be a coherent state ( @xmath148 ) centered at @xmath149 when @xmath150 .",

    "the husimi density of the evolved state ( @xmath151 ) together with the trajectories @xmath152 for different measurement schemes is plotted in figures 1(b)-(d ) .",
    "the evolved state in fig .",
    "1(b ) is the result when no measurements occur ( @xmath153 ) . in this case , nonlinearities in the hamiltonian cause the state to shear as it evolves , spreading it along the contours .",
    "the trajectory has little meaning when @xmath153 . in fig .",
    "1(c ) the evolved state is the result of continuous simultaneous measurement of position and momentum with @xmath154 and @xmath148 . in this case",
    "the state has remained localized as it follows the contours .",
    "the continuous measurement of position only ( @xmath78 ) when @xmath155 has also kept the state localized .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "the combined variance of position and momentum is plotted in fig .",
    "we must emphasize that only when both position and momentum are measured together does the trajectory correspond via ( [ xa],[xb ] ) to the outcome of an actual measurement .",
    "if only position is measured , only @xmath122 observed while @xmath123 is simply the result of a mathematical calculation .",
    "now consider the chaotic case when @xmath156 , @xmath157 , @xmath145 , @xmath158 , @xmath159 and @xmath147 .",

    "for an initial state the same as above , the evolved state ( @xmath160 ) together with the trajectories for different measurement schemes is plotted in figures 2(b)-(d ) . when no measurement occurs ( fig .",
    "2(b ) ) the chaotic action of stretching and folding spreads the state across the phase space .",
    "however when we continuously measure position and momentum ( fig .",
    "2(c ) ) the state remains localized and the trajectory resembles classical motion with noise .",
    "this noise will vanish as we approach the classical limit @xmath161 . in fig .",
    "3(a ) we have plotted the quantum trajectory for the same parameter values as above except with @xmath162 . in this case",
    "the total variance remains below @xmath163 ( fig .",
    "3(b ) ) and the noise is not visible .",
    "the corresponding classical trajectory is plotted in grey and is only visible when it deviates from the quantum at @xmath164 .",
    "the evolution of this system under the continuous measurement of position has already been studied by bhattacharya et al .",
    "they also find that the measurement keeps the system state localized .",
    "it is not surprising that this is also the case when only momentum is measured ( fig .",
    "we have derived an it stochastic schrdinger equation ( [ stochschro ] ) describing the evolution of a quantum system under the continuous simultaneous measurement of position and momentum .",
    "the outcome of this measurement is a classical stochastic record obeying ( [ calx ] ) . as a consequence of the measurement ,",
    "the system state is forced to remain localized allowing a classical interpretation of the quantum mean of the phase space variables as the trajectory of the system .",
    "this trajectory corresponds to the actual measured trajectory minus noise ( [ xa],[xb ] ) .",
    "furthermore , the localization property allows a well - defined classical limit via ehrenfest s theorem .",
    "indeed , for small @xmath165 , numerical results show that the quantum system approximately follows classical trajectories .",

    "<S> classical dynamics is formulated as a hamiltonian flow on phase space , while quantum mechanics is formulated as a unitary dynamics in hilbert space . </S>",
    "<S> these different formulations have made it difficult to directly compare quantum and classical nonlinear dynamics . </S>",
    "<S> previous solutions have focussed on computing quantities associated with a statistical ensemble such as variance or entropy . </S>",
    "<S> however a more direct comparison would compare classical predictions to the quantum for continuous simultaneous measurement of position and momentum of a single system . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we give a theory of such measurement and show that chaotic behaviour in classical systems can be reproduced by continuously measured quantum systems . </S>"
