    "classical equilibrium thermodynamics , in its essence , aims at describing the equilibrium states of a system composed of many particles using a small number of variables .",
    "the individuation of the right number of macroscopic variables , often called _ collective variables _",
    "@xcite , is a non trivial task .",
    "this problem has received attention in the chemical physics community : if the system is described by a fokker - planck equation , the existence of a _ large gap _ in the spectrum of the associated elliptic operator is interpreted , from a physical point of view , as the emergence of a finite dimensional description of the system in terms of its leading eigenvalues .",
    "this is , roughly speaking , the content of the kramers - klein theory , which dates back to the seminal paper @xcite ; see e.g.@xcite and @xcite for an exposition and some applications of this framework .",
    "nowadays a sound justification of the above kramers - klein theory relies on the witten theory @xcite , also discussed in arnold - keshin @xcite .",
    "another reductionistic approach which is relevant for the present work is the amann ",
    "zehnder reduction ( acz in what follows ) @xcite .",
    "acz is a global lyapunov - schmidt type reduction transforming an infinite dimensional variational principle into an equivalent finite dimensional one .",
    "namely , a static pde variational problem becomes perfectly equivalent to a finite algebraic system , see section [ sec : acz ] .",
    "this method has been employed in conjunction with topological techniques for proving results of existence and multiplicity of solutions for nonlinear differential equations @xcite .",
    "notably for our purposes , we have that the acz philosophy can be applied also to dissipative dynamical equations , giving rise to the notion of _ inertial manifolds _ @xcite .",
    "an inertial manifold is a finite dimensional smooth structure which contains the attractor of the system and which is also invariant with respect to the evolution equations .",
    "moreover , every orbit of the system starting outside of the manifold is exponentially rapidly attracted towards the manifold itself .",
    "this feature supports the idea that the global motion could be effectively studied and controlled by studying the motion restricted to the inertial manifold . in principle , the application of this methodology is extremely appealing and promising for a wide range of applications .",
    "however the existence of such manifolds is not guaranteed in the general case and furthermore the numerical exploitation of such structures is usually problematic .",
    "nevertheless , given the different scales at which the modeled phenomena occur , some of the fine details of the motion can be neglected without affecting the general and long time behavior of the system .",
    "it is possible therefore to define an asymptotic series expansion of such manifolds , and such expansion have a simple explicit formulation and can be implemented numerically in an effective and efficient way .",
    "truncations in this series expansions are called _ approximate inertial manifolds _ ( aim ) and have been applied successfully in a range of situations and for a wide spectrum of phenomena @xcite .",
    "eventually , aims can be defined and employed for studying the global motion even when an exact inertial manifold does not exist .",
    "coming back to thermodynamics , an even more challenging task is the description of a system in an out of equilibrium state . in this realm",
    "the classical thermodynamic description , except for the case of moderate deviation form equilibrium , is less powerful and even the status of basic notions as non equilibrium free energy or entropy is debated .    in a series of papers",
    "@xcite g. jona - lasinio and coworkers develop a theory aiming at a macroscopic description of thermodynamic systems in a stationary non equilibrium state ( driven diffusive systems ) in terms of a finite number of space  time fields representing pertinent thermodynamic variables .",
    "the theory has an axiomatic format that stems from generalization of previous rigorous result for lattice gas systems where the macroscopic equations are the hydrodynamic limit equations .",
    "a thorough treatment of large deviations for these systems was given by varadhan and others @xcite .",
    "for a driven diffusive system the macroscopic equations are balance equations and for these jona - lasinio and co - workers develop a theory of macroscopic fluctuations which is a generalization to fields variables of the friedlin and wentzell theory of large deviations for ode .",
    "one of the most interesting features of the theory is that the infinite dimensional analog @xmath0 -see @xmath1- of the _ quasi potential _ of the friedlin and wentzell theory is interpreted as the non equilibrium free energy of the system in a stationary non equilibrium state , without any assumption of moderate deviations from equilibrium .",
    "the guiding principle of this paper is the following : starting from an infinite dimensional system ( pde ) akin to those considered by jona - lasinio we operate a reduction and we study a stochastic version of the resulting finite dimensional ode .",
    "we can thus make use of the standard friedlin and wentzell theory .",
    "here is the sketch of our strategy .",
    "* we start from a reaction - diffusion pde which is also a @xmath2__gradient type _ _ system , see ( [ rd ] ) , thought as a simplified prototype model for the balance law governing the evolution of a open system in a stationary non equilibrium state .",
    "* we operate a finite dimensional reduction of it obtaining in this way a finite dimensional ode , equation @xmath3 , still of _ gradient type_. the true dynamics approaches the reduced one and the difference between them can be estimated by the associated approximate inertial manifold , see sect.[aim1 ] , [ aim2 ] .",
    "* we mimic the loss of information linked to the finite approximate reduction above introduced adding a stochastic noise to this deterministic ode @xmath3 and we consider the associated probabilistic fokker - planck equation . a careful description of the limiting behavior of the sde is afforded by the standard friedlin - wentzell theory of large deviations for stochastic ode . a major role in this theory",
    "is played by the _ action functional _ over the dynamic evolution of the system and its associated variational principle which defines the so - called _ quasi - potential _",
    "-see @xmath4 and @xmath5- the related hamilton - jacobi equation is investigated in this paper with viscosity and weak kam theory techniques .",
    "we are confident that the results of this approach could shed light on the more elaborate infinite dimensional analogs of the jona - lasinio theory .",
    "for example , in the finite dimensional case , using asymptotic theory of viscosity solutions we are able to prove that the right hand member of the finite - dimensional h - j equation @xmath6 is the ma critical value , which is zero in the present case , as we resumed in prop.[prop1 ] .",
    "the need of setting equal to zero the right hand member of @xmath7 is not obvious in the jona - lasinio formulation .",
    "next , for the gradient type ode @xmath3 we compute explicitly the quasi potential @xmath8 and we show that it coincides with potential energy @xmath9 whose gradient @xmath10 gives the gradient reduced dynamics .",
    "moreover , in sect.[confronto ] we propose a comparison between the infinite dimensional free energy @xmath0 and a finite dimensional analog of it -see @xmath11- which is expressed in terms of the quasi - potential @xmath8 .    as a final remark",
    ", we want to draw attention on the fact that our finite - dimensional gradient equation describes the evolution of projection over a finite dimensional subspace of and evolutive pde , that gives rise to a finite dimensional ode .",
    "the abstract nature of this ode is on the one hand the major limit to extend the comparisons between the initial physical problem and its reduced dynamic and on the other hand the source of its effectiveness to give a `` thermodynamic type '' description of the system in terms of `` a few '' collective variables",
    "let @xmath12 be the elliptic laplace - beltrami operator on a closed riemann manifold @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 be the potential energy function .",
    "our aim is to reconsider the reaction - diffusion equation @xmath16 thought as a simplified prototype model for the balance law governing the evolution of the field in the macroscopic theory of driven diffusive systems in non stationary thermodynamics , see @xcite , equation @xmath17 below . even though ( [ rd ] ) does not admit a standard variational formulation , the search of its equilibria does",
    "indeed , considering the following real valued functional ] @xmath18 , @xmath19dx\\ ] ] the variational principle @xmath20 produces the euler - lagrange equation @xmath21    moreover , again by using @xmath22 , equation @xmath23 can also be read in a distributional @xmath24 weak format , as an infinite dimensional gradient system @xmath25 whose solutions would be ` running ' to the equilibria solutions of ( [ el ] ) .",
    "the equation ( [ rd - w ] ) appears as a _ gradient descent _ equation and its equilibrium solutions are the critical points of ( [ pf ] ) .",
    "notice that the ` static ' functional @xmath22 in ( [ pf ] ) plays the natural role of candidate lyapunov functional :    @xmath26      suppose that the @xmath12-spectral representation of @xmath27 does work , @xmath28 and then consider an ` a priori ' cut - off @xmath29 , @xmath30 @xmath31 denoting by @xmath32 the unique solution to the poisson equation ( the so - called @xmath33 ) @xmath34 we translate ( [ el ] ) into a fixed point problem : @xmath35 and consider the following decomposition of ( [ el1 ] ) , @xmath36 look at ( [ dec]@xmath37 : we will check that if @xmath38 is _ globally lipschitz _ , @xmath39 then we can choose the cut - off @xmath40 such that the following map , from @xmath41 into itself , for any fixed @xmath42 , is a contraction : @xmath43 @xmath44 to see this , we have that for any @xmath45 , recalling ( [ g ] ) , @xmath46 and since the sequence @xmath47 is growing and unbounded , we can choose @xmath40 so that @xmath48 denote by @xmath49 the unique fixed point function such that , for any @xmath50 , @xmath51 finally , we see that the solutions of the finite part ( [ dec]@xmath52 are related to a finite variational setting . indeed , defined the real valued function @xmath53 we see that @xmath54 @xmath55    @xmath56 @xmath57    @xmath58    in other words , the critical points @xmath59 of @xmath9 are _ exactly _ the solutions of ( [ dec]@xmath52 .",
    "moreover , we can say that all the solutions of the variational principle @xmath60 , are obtained by the above finite reduction @xmath61 : insert a solution @xmath59 of ( [ dec]@xmath52 in ( [ fp ] ) , obtaining ( [ dec]@xmath37 , then add @xmath59 to the resulting @xmath49 , recovering @xmath62 , solution of @xmath60 .",
    "the proposal of finite reduction of the dynamic equation ( [ rd ] ) , recalling ( [ eli ] ) , ( [ fr ] ) and ( [ fin ] ) , goes as follows .",

    "eventually , we have obtained @xmath70 we see that ( [ dec2]@xmath52 , in view of ( [ fin ] ) , is precisely @xmath71 we point out that for the above outlined reduced equation the set of critical points is in a one - to - one correspondence with the equilibria of the original reaction  diffusion equation .",
    "if @xmath72 is a critical point , minimum for @xmath9 , then @xmath9 is a ( local ) lyapunov function for the ode dynamics ( [ gra ] ) around @xmath72 : @xmath73    a main feature of this approximate reduction is that it preserves the gradient - like character of the pde ( [ rd ] ) .",
    "we point out that it can be interpreted as a sort of `` quasi - static '' thermodynamic version of ( [ rd ] ) , precisely for the presence of `` zero '' in the l.h.s . of ( [ dec2]@xmath37 .",
    "it turns out that the finite exact reduction scheme introduced above has strong connections with the theory of inertial and approximate inertial manifolds developed by r. temam and coworkers @xcite . in order to compare the effectiveness of both theories to deal with our problem",

    ". this can be rephrased by saying that equation ( [ rd ] ) must be automatically satisfied along @xmath81 .",

    "secondly , @xmath242 since @xmath168 is a compact manifold , any @xmath62 must have at least one critical point @xmath211 , @xmath243 .",
    "then @xmath244 and @xmath245 . because this holds for any @xmath62 , therefore @xmath246",
    "in order to prove @xmath233 , for any @xmath62 , by evaluating at @xmath247 , we see that @xmath248 , and we conclude .",
    "we recapitulate the theory developed so far : starting from a deterministic ode @xmath3 , which gives the approximate evolution of our reaction - diffusion system , we introduced the associated sde @xmath171 by adding a gaussian noise term @xmath249 .",
    "the set of stochastic ( continuous ) trajectories can be equipped with a probability density which satisfies a large deviation principle : the probability of a path is exponentially decreasing around the deterministic trajectory corresponding to vanishing noise .",
    "the associated rate function @xmath250 is the _ action functional _ of the friedlin - wentzell theory .",
    "an analogous large deviation results holds for the probability density @xmath251 of the associated fokker - planck equation . in this latter case , the associated rate function , called the _ quasi potential _",
    ", can be obtained as the solution of an hamilton - jacobi type pde @xmath252 .      in a series of papers @xcite g. jona - lasinio and coworkers",
    "expose a theory of thermodynamic systems in a stationary non equilibrium state ( driven diffusive systems ) in terms of a finite number of space  time macroscopic fields representing thermodynamic variables .",
    "it turns out that strictly analogous objects to those above discussed , like the action functional , the quasi potential and the hamilton - jacobi type equation do arise in the theory of driven diffusive systems developed by g. jona - lasinio et al . ,",
    "albeit in an infinite - dimensional setting",
    ". moreover the quasi - potential is interpreted as the non - equilibrium free energy of the system ( see sect.[mfd ] below ) .",
    "therefore , the reduced dynamic and its associated stochastic version presented in this paper may be interpreted as a sort of finite dimensional skeleton of the theory of driven diffusive systems .    in what follows",
    "we will sketch the results of this approach using the single scalar space time field of the macroscopic density @xmath253 , @xmath254 .",
    "the theory has an axiomatic format that stems from a paradigmatic consideration of lattice gas models .",
    "* axiom * ( @xcite ) _ the macroscopic evolution of the field @xmath255 is given by the continuity equation [ axiom1 ] _",
    "t + j = 0 together with the constitutive equation for the associated current @xmath256 [ axiom2 ] j ( ) = -d ( ) + ( ) e where @xmath257 and @xmath258 are respectively the diffusion and mobility coefficients and @xmath259 is the applied external field . _",
    "the key point is that , when considering the lattice gas model , the above introduced continuity equation is the hydrodynamic limit equation for density @xmath261 which in turn is the limit of the empirical density @xmath262 of particles in a given point @xmath263 on the lattice @xmath264 with @xmath265 particles .",
    "jona - lasinio and coworkers shows that in the thermodynamic limit @xmath266 the empirical density @xmath267 satisfies a large deviation principle . to introduce the associated rate function , we set [ aaa ] i_t [ ] = _ 0^t dt _ [ _ t + j ( ) ] k()^-1[_t + j()]dx 0 where the positive operator @xmath268 is the analog of the diffusion coefficient @xmath187 in the finite - dimensional friedlin - wentzell theory and @xmath269 is defined by @xmath270 the functional @xmath271 represents the extra - cost necessary to follow the trajectory @xmath272 and it is zero along the solutions of the continuity equation above .",
    "given a stationary solution @xmath260 of the continuity equation , and another system evolution @xmath66 we set ( we omit here the space dependence in the fields for simplicity s sake ) [ enlibera ] ( ) = -_()\\ { i _ [ ]  ( 0 ) = , _",
    "t(t ) = } jona - lasinio and coworkers identify @xmath273 as the _ free energy of the system in the dynamic state _ @xmath272 .",
    "this last point is particularly interesting since a commonly accepted definition of free energy for a general system in a non equilibrium state is actually lacking in the literature .",
    "* note that in the simplest case @xmath274 the continuity equation @xmath275 above reads [ axiom3 ] _ t = - d+ ( e ) which is of the type considered in @xmath23 although with a different source term . *",
    "also , the lagrangian density function in @xmath276 is the equivalent of the lagrangian associated to the action functional in the finite dimensional ( ode ) friedlin - wentzell theory and the quantity @xmath273 in @xmath1 can be seen as the infinite - dimensional analog of the quasi potential @xmath277 in @xmath5 . *",
    "the above defined free energy function @xmath0 parallels the definition of the quasi potential @xmath278 , which is interpreted as the generating function of a canonical transformation in the friedlin - wentzell theory .",
    "therefore @xmath0 can be seen as the solution of an infinite dimensional hamilton - jacobi equation of the form ( see @xcite ) [ infinite ] ( ) - j ( ) = 0 where angular brackets stands for integration on the spatial domain @xmath168 . * as a matter of fact , in the finite dimensional case , see @xmath6 , using asymptotic theory of viscosity solutions we are able to prove that the right hand member of the finite - dimensional h - j equation is the ma critical value which is zero in the present case .",
    "the need of setting the right hand member of @xmath7 equal to zero is not obvious in the jona - lasinio format .      in this paragraph",
    "we want to draw attention to an interesting interpretation of the functional form of the non equilibrium free energy introduced in @xmath276 .",
    "let @xmath263 be the phase space point of a thermodynamical system and @xmath279 the energy .",
    "it is well known that for a discrete thermodynamical system of average energy @xmath280 in equilibrium with a thermal bath at temperature @xmath281 its statistical description is afforded by the boltzmann - gibbs distribution ( here @xmath282 is boltzmann constant ) [ bg ] p(z ) = z(t)^-1e ^- , z(t ) = e ^-dz and",
    "its associated equilibrium free energy is [ eqfreen ] ( t ) = _ p(e)- k_bt h(p ) = - k_bt z where @xmath283 is shannon entropy . note that the above definition of @xmath284 is perfectly meaningful also for a different probability density therefore we can define the _ non - equilibrium free energy _ as [ freen ] ( p ) = _ p(e ) - k_b t h(p ) and it is easy to prove that @xmath285 =   \\int p(z)\\ln \\frac{p(z)}{\\hat p(z ) } dz = { h } ( p\\vert\\ , \\hat p ) \\geq 0\\ ] ] where @xmath286 is precisely the relative entropy ( [ re ] ) .",
    "the relative entropy is therefore the quantity that measures the variation in free energy due to a fluctuation @xmath287 from the equilibrium @xmath288 .",
    "since @xmath289 is a non negative quantity , we recover the well known fact that the free energy has a minimum in the stationary state with respect to finite deviations .",
    "if we consider the system described by the sde @xmath171  @xmath290 , we see that the equilibrium density @xmath291 in @xmath290 has the form of the boltzmann - gibbs distribution @xmath292 if , at least formally , we identify @xmath293 the potential energy @xmath294 of @xmath290 with the system energy @xmath279 and @xmath295 the diffusion coefficient @xmath187 with the temperature @xmath296 . concerning @xmath295 , using the einstein - smoluchowsky relation @xmath297 where @xmath298 is the ( system dependent ) mobility , we are allowed to interpret , up to a constant , the diffusion term @xmath187 as a stochastic temperature and hence to _ define _ the equilibrium free energy @xmath299 of the stochastic system as @xmath300 and the _ out of equilibrium free energy _ @xmath301 as @xmath302 in the neighborhood of an equilibrium point @xmath199 of @xmath9 , we have -see @xmath5 and @xmath303- that @xmath304 hence the out of equilibrium free energy of our stochastic system is [ enlibera2 ] _ ( p)= _ p(v^eq_)- h(p ) to be compared with @xmath1 .",
    "it is worth noticing , however , that this proposed free energy functional is , in this form , a function of the probability density and not of the macroscopic parameters ( pressure , volume , etc . )",
    "that define the thermodynamic state . this last step can be carried over by e.g. applying the maximum entropy principle where the probability density @xmath305 is a function of the observed macroscopic parameters . in this way we have a complete correspondence , at least in principle , between @xmath1 and @xmath11 .",
