    "high gain free - electron lasers ( fels ) are able of generating ultra short x - ray pulses with a duration in the femtosecond range @xcite . in order to provide an optimal operation of the fel for pump - probe experiments or for seeding using external laser systems",
    ", the arrival - time of the bunches has to be synchronized with femtosecond precision .",
    "an accurate measurement of the bunch arrival - time , thus , is essential for the synchronization process .    currently , there are few bunch arrival - time monitors ( bams ) available , which achieve or have the potential to achieve sub-@xmath3  fs time resolution .",
    "an arrival - time monitor using a cavity as a beam pickup and a radio frequency ( rf ) based phase detection is described in @xcite .",
    "such a detection scheme is realized at the lcls free - electron laser at slac .",
    "it allows for a sub-50 femtosecond synchronization between a laser and the x - rays for pump - probe experiments @xcite .",
    "another type of arrival - time monitor featuring an electro - optical crystal inside the beam pipe for measuring the cross - correlation of the coherent terahertz radiation generated by the undulator and an external laser pulse is presented in @xcite .",
    "this type of monitor can be applied only at the end of an undulator .    at the free - electron laser at desy , hamburg ( flash ) ,",
    "the installed bams have an intrinsic time resolution better than 10 fs for bunch charges above @xmath4  pc @xcite .",
    "these arrival - time monitors combine a transient beam induced pickup signal with an electro - optical signal detection scheme as proposed in @xcite . in this scheme",
    "the achievable time resolution is proportional to the steepness of the output voltage at the first zero - crossing .",
    "the steepness in turn scales with the bunch charge leading to significant performance degradations for low charge fel operation .",
    "details are presented in @xcite .    with the extension of flash   and the european x - ray free electron laser project ( xfel ) , a low charge operation mode with bunch charge of @xmath2  pc",
    "is planned . in order to satisfy the sub-@xmath3  femtosecond resolution demands for high and low charge operation , the current bam design needs to be upgraded .    in this paper",
    "we present the design and the realization of high bandwidth cone - shaped pickup electrodes as a part of the bam .",
    "the proposed pickup electrodes enable high resolution arrival - time measurements for the low bunch charge as well as for high bunch charge mode of operation .",

    "[ cabling ] .",
    "the requirements on the pickup , which need to be fulfilled for low and high charge operation are given in table  [ tab : param ] .",
    "an output voltage slope at the first zero - crossing of more than @xmath5  mv / ps is required . in frequency domain",
    "this corresponds to a cutoff frequency of 40 ghz .",
    "the ringing of the voltage signal is defined as    @xmath6    where @xmath7 is a freely chosen time offset with respect to the zero crossing , @xmath8 is the peak - to - peak voltage , and @xmath9 is the simulation time .",
    "this definition of the ringing is adapted from the design specifications .",
    "these require the ringing to be less than @xmath10% of the peak amplitude after @xmath11  ns , which corresponds to the minimum bunch spacing for the european xfel .",

    "the reflection coefficient curves are in good agreement except for port two ( s@xmath13 ) , which deviates from the other curves in the frequency range from @xmath14 to @xmath3  ghz , and from @xmath2 to @xmath15  ghz .",
    "reflections higher than @xmath16  db for low frequencies occur due to calibration uncertainties .",
    "the cause of the deviation for reflection at port  2 was investigated .",

    "it is difficult to determine whether there are manufacturing deviations of the system .",
    "the rf properties in this case are dominated by the dimensions of the aperture of the beam pipe , which behaves like a cavity .",
    "the contribution of the pickup , which acts as a coupling probe , is rather small .",
    "the maximum level of cross - talk between the ports is @xmath18  db .",
    "this is sufficient to attenuate the reflected signal .",
    "the resonant peaks at both plots correspond to the one obtained from a resonator with length equal to twice the distance between the ports , respectively .    for validating the measurement procedure including the defect ,",

    "is conducted via phase matched cables ( @xmath19 at @xmath0  ghz ) and a combiner with a phase unbalance lower than @xmath20 up to @xmath0  ghz . to prevent the eoms from damage a limiter and a step attenuator will be used .",
    "the cable assembly will be done with silicon dioxide cables which offer high radiation resistance of more than 10000 gray and a temperature coefficient of delay of about @xmath21  fs  @xmath22 .",
    "a slope degradation will occur at the output of the combiner due to a total cable and the combiner phase mismatch of @xmath23 .",
    "the expected slope degradation at the output of the combiner is in the order of @xmath24% at a frequency of @xmath0  ghz .",

    "a high bandwidth cone - shaped pickup for the bams for free - electron lasers is introduced .",
    "the proposed design provides an output voltage slope of @xmath25  mv / ps and a bandwidth of more than @xmath0  ghz , which is well inside the specifications .",
    "this makes it suitable for enabling a sub-@xmath3  fs time resolution for high and low bunch charge operation of the fels .",
    "a tolerance study was performed providing the sensitivity of the pickup output signal with respect to geometry parameters .",
    "this allowed for setting manufacturing tolerances . for validating the obtained results we have built a non - hermetic model of the pickup and conducted a series of measurements .",
