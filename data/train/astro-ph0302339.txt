    "the first sources of ionizing radiation to condense out of the dark , neutral , opaque igm reheated and reionized it between @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "weak , r - type ionization fronts surrounding each source swept outward thru the igm , overtaking smaller - mass virialized halos , called _ minihalos _ , and photoevaporating them .",
    "high - redshift sources of ionizing photons may have found their sky covered by these minihalos .",
    "the photoevaporation of minihalos may therefore have dominated consumption of ionizing photons during reionization@xcite . in this paper",
    ", we focus on the currently favored @xmath0cdm model ( @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 ) . in this model ,",
    "the universe at @xmath22 was already filled with minihalos capable of trapping a piece of the global , intergalactic i - fronts , photoevaporating their gaseous baryons back into the igm .",
    "prior to their encounter with these i - fronts , minihalos with @xmath5 were neutral and optically thick to hydrogen ionizing radiation .",
    "n - body simulations in a cubic volume @xmath23 on a side ( see fig .",
    "1a , b ) reveal that at @xmath7 minihalos with @xmath5 ( i.e. @xmath24 ) were separated on average by only @xmath25 while their geometric cross section together covered @xmath26 of the area along every @xmath23 of an average line of sight @xcite . if the sources of reionization were large mass halos with @xmath27 , then these were well - enough separated that typical reionization photons were likely to have been absorbed by intervening minihalos .    to demonstrate this in a statistically meaningful way with more dynamic range than n - body results , we combine the press - schechter ( ps ) prescription for deriving the average number density of halos with the truncated isothermal sphere ( tis ) halo model@xcite , to determine which halos are subject to photoevaporation and how common they are , as function of their redshifts .",
    "we then compute the fraction of the sky @xmath28 , as seen by a source halo of a given mass , which is covered by opaque minihalos located within the mean volume per source halo . if halos with @xmath29 are the reionization sources , their minihalo covering fraction is close to unity and increases by a factor of a few if we take account of the statistical bias by which minihalos tend to cluster around the source halos ( see fig .",
    "we have performed radiation - hydrodynamical simulations of the photoevaporation of a cosmological minihalo overrun by a weak , r - type i - front in the surrounding igm , created by an external source of radiation@xcite .",
    "minihalos are modeled as tis of cdm + baryons @xcite .",
    "we consider 3 different source spectra : ( 1 ) qso - like : @xmath30 ( @xmath31 ) ; ( 2 ) stellar blackbody : @xmath32 ; ( 3 ) `` no metals '' stellar @xmath33 .",
    "the i - front encounters the minihalo at redshifts @xmath34 .",
    "the flux levels are @xmath35 ( where @xmath36 ionizing photons @xmath37 , and @xmath38 ) . the halo masses are @xmath39 ( where @xmath40 corresponds to @xmath41 at @xmath7 ) .",
    "the minihalo shields itself against ionizing photons , traps the r - type i - front which enters the halo , causing it to decelerate inside the halo to close to the sound speed of the ionized gas and transforms itself into a d - type front , preceded by a shock .",
    "the side facing the source expels a supersonic wind backward toward the source , which shocks the igm outside the minihalo .",
    "the wind grows more isotropic with time as the remaining neutral halo material is photoevaporated . since the gas itself was initially bound to a dark halo with @xmath42 , photoevaporation proceeds unimpeded by gravity .",
    "figure  2 shows the structure of the photoevaporation flow 60 myr after the global i - front first overtakes a @xmath10 minihalo .",
    "the evaporation time per halo , @xmath43 , and the number , @xmath44 , of ionizing photons absorbed per minihalo h atom during this evaporation time have important implications for the reionization of the universe .",
    "we summarize in figure  3 the dependence of these quantities on the value of the @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 , and the source spectrum , based on our simulation results .     for individual minihalos ( top panels ) and",
    "total number of ionizing photons absorbed per minihalo h atom during this photoevaporation ( bottom panels ) .",
    "different panels show the variation in these quantities with the input parameters which label the horizontal axes : @xmath48  minihalo mass , @xmath49  redshift when i - front first encounters minihalo , and @xmath50  dimensionless ionizing photon flux , with spectrum which is either a stellar blackbody , with @xmath51 , ( circles ) or @xmath52 ( squares ) , or else qso - like ( triangles ) .",
