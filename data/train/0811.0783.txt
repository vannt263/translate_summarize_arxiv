    "the fact that not all pairs of quantum observables are jointly measurable is usually mentioned as one of the characteristic features of quantum mechanics .",
    "joint measurability means that measurements of two given observables can be interpreted as originating in a measurement of a single ( joint ) observable .",
    "joint ( non-)measurability is hence related to the limitations of measuring and manipulating quantum objects .    traditionally , joint measurability was taken to be synonym for commutativity .",
    "this is indeed the case if observables are represented solely by selfadjoint operators .",
    "however , nowadays it is recognized that the correct mathematical representation for quantum observables is given by positive operator valued measures @xcite , @xcite , and selfadjoint operators correspond only to a specific class of ideal observables ( here called sharp observables ) .",
    "this generalization leads to the conclusion that commutativity is only a limited criterion for joint measurability in this more general setting @xcite , @xcite .",
    "namely , commutative observables are jointly measurable but the converse need not be true .",
    "there are numerous studies on joint measurements of some special collections of observables , the most prominent cases being the position  momentum pair and spin observables along different axes . in these notes",
    "we are interested in the general features of joint measurability rather than any special case . however , the conclusions we obtain are based on recent progress in the above mentioned examples .    unlike in the case of sharp observables ( projection valued measures or equivalently selfadjoint operators ) , there is no general theory for joint measurability of general observables ( positive operator valued measures ) .",
    "two sharp observables are jointly measurable if and only if they commute , but this kind of a simple criterion is not known for general observables .    for sharp observables the following facts hold : ( i ) if we have a collection of sharp observables and each pair of them is jointly measurable , then they are jointly measurable all together ; ( ii ) if two sharp observables are jointly measurable , then their joint observable is unique and it gives the greatest lower bound for the effects corresponding to the observables ; ( iii ) if we have two sharp observables and their every possible two outcome partitionings are jointly measurable , then the observables themselves are jointly measurable .",
    "these properties are often useful .",
    "namely , property ( i ) implies that to test the joint measurability of a collection of observables , it would be enough to test them pairwisely .",
    "property ( ii ) simplifies the problem by fixing the form of a joint observable , while property ( iii ) implies that joint measurability of two observables reduces to joint measurability of certain two outcome observables .    in sections",
    "23 we first define the needed notions and then provide some examples .",
    "we then study the properties ( i)(iii ) ( in sections 46 , respectively ) and we show that , in general , they do not hold .",
    "we , however , also suggest some possible candidates which would accompany joint measurability and replace the apparently useful properties ( i)-(iii ) .",
