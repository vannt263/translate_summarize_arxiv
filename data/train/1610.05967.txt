    "over the past decade holography has become an important tool to describe strongly coupled condensed matter systems . since many real world systems of interest",
    "are non - relativistic , there has been growing interest in constructing gravitational models that exhibit non - relativistic galilean or lifshitz symmetries . in this paper",
    "we will focus on dual lifshitz theories , where boost invariance is broken and space and time scale in an anisotropic way @xmath4 .",
    "the dynamical exponent @xmath5 in general will differ from unity .",
    "a field theory with this type of symmetry is thought to describe quantum critical points , which characterize zero temperature phase transitions associated with quantum fluctuations @xcite .",
    "on the gravitational side , it was shown that einstein gravity with various additional matter fields in the bulk can have solutions with asymptotic lifshitz scaling @xcite . in these cases",
    "the dual gravitational theory is of course relativistic , with local lorentz invariance .",
    "the lifshitz scaling emerges only as feature of a special class of solutions , supported by the exotic matter fields .",
    "a more natural , alternative dual description is in terms of a gravity theory with a preferred frame @xcite .",
    "one such theory is einstein - aether theory @xcite , where in addition to the metric there is a dynamical unit timelike vector field acting as an  aether \" .",
    "einstein - aether theory has been studied extensively as an alternative theory of gravity ( i.e. focusing on asymptotically flat and cosmological solutions ) , for a review see @xcite .",
    "another theory is hoava - lifshitz gravity , or hoava gravity for short , which has attracted much attention as a possibly renormalizable quantum theory of gravity @xcite .",
    "hoava gravity can be thought of in the low energy limit as einstein - aether gravity restricted to the case where the aether is hypersurface orthogonal , defining a preferred time .",
    "in @xcite the authors showed that hoava gravity ( with negative cosmological constant ) is a viable setting for non - relativistic lifshitz holography and worked out some aspects of the holographic dictionary . in holography ,",
    "thermal states in the field theory are dual to black hole solutions in the bulk gravitational theory . therefore to study lifshitz hydrodynamics",
    "we need to find black hole solutions and their associated thermodynamics .",
    "however , in a theory of gravity with a preferred frame the loss of relativistic causality leads to the existence of apparently multiple horizons , which clashes with the laws of black hole thermodynamics see e.g. @xcite .",
    "a potential resolution is to define a black hole via the existence of a  universal horizon \" , a spacelike surface where even modes of arbitrary speed do not reach infinity @xcite .",
    "the universal horizon is defined in terms of the preferred time foliation , in particular it is the surface where the preferred time @xmath6 .",
    "several works have shown that one can indeed define a notion of temperature and a first law for the universal horizon @xcite .",
    "asymptotically lifshitz black holes with regular universal horizons have previously been found in hoava gravity . in particular , in the special case where @xmath7 there is an analytic black hole solution @xcite in four dimensions .",
    "one can perturb this solution in the context of the fluid - gravity correspondence and read off some of the transport coefficients of the dual theory @xcite .",
    "however , the generic @xmath0 cases are of the most interest .",
    "recently , @xcite found a numerical solution in three dimensions for @xmath1 and special choice of coupling constants .    in this paper",
    "we show numerically that there exist a wide class of solutions with regular universal horizon for @xmath1 and @xmath2 in both three and four dimensions . near infinity , these solutions have non - analytic behavior , where series expansions are in terms of non - integer powers .",
    "we also explore the interior and show there is oscillatory behavior in the aether field , just as in asymptotically flat cases .",
    "curiously , for @xmath3 no solutions of this type appear to exist .",
    "the structure of this paper is as follows . in section",
    "ii we briefly review einstein - aether theory and how hypersurface orthogonal solutions are also solutions of hoava gravity . in section iii",
    "we discuss asymptotic lifshitz solutions , which can have analytic and non - analytic behavior when @xmath0 . in section iv",
    ", we discuss generic features of black hole solutions , including how one imposes regularity . in section",
    "v we present our results .",
    "we conclude with a discussion and areas for future research .",
    "the action for einstein - aether theory with a negative cosmological constant @xmath8 is @xmath9 where @xmath10 , with @xmath11 and @xmath12 this turns out to be the most general effective action for a timelike unit vector field at 2nd order in derivatives ( a term proportional to ricci tensor contracted with two aether vectors is a combination of the @xmath13 and @xmath14 terms above ) .",
    "varying this action with respect to the metric , vector field , and the lagrange multiplier @xmath15 , one finds the following field equations @xmath16 the aether stress tensor is given by @xmath17 \\ , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "the aether field equation is @xmath20 one can show that solutions of einstein - aether theory where the aether is hypersurface orthogonal are also solutions of hoava - lifshitz gravity @xcite . in this case the aether foliation defines a preferred time foliation in the spacetime .",
    "first note that when the aether field is hypersurface orthogonal , the twist @xmath21 } \\\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] vanishes .",
    "one can show that @xmath22 since squared twist must also vanish , adding it to the action does nt affect the solutions . due to the fact that this scalar twist is a combination of the @xmath23 , @xmath14 and @xmath24 terms",
    ", we can use the freedom to add @xmath25 to eliminate one of @xmath23 , @xmath14 or @xmath24 in the action .",
    "a convenient choice is to eliminate @xmath23 , therefore we take @xmath26 from this point forward .",
    "secondly , hypersurface orthogonality implies the co - vector is the gradient of a scalar @xmath27 if we choose coordinates such that @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is the preferred foliation of time , then in this gauge the einstein - aether action reduces to the generic @xmath30 form of the hoava - lifshitz action ( e.g. @xcite ) @xmath31 here @xmath32 is the extrinsic curvature of the preferred time slices , @xmath33 the spatial metric on the slices , @xmath34 the intrinsic ricci scalar and @xmath35 is the lapse function , @xmath36 .",
    "the mapping between the constants is given by @xmath37 in einstein - aether theory there are five propagating degrees of freedom with spin-2 , spin-1 , and spin-0 helicities @xcite . in hoava - lifshitz",
    "the spin-1 mode is non - propagating .",
    "the squared speeds of the remaining modes are given in general space dimension @xmath38 by @xcite @xmath39",
    "we begin to characterize solutions by considering the following ansatz for the metric and aether in terms of eddington - finkelstein like coordinates @xmath40 here the aether field is hypersurface orthogonal ( vanishing twist ) , so that solutions will satisfy both the einstein - aether and hoava - lifshitz field equations . in practice",
    ", we will work with the einstein - aether field equations .",
    "plugging the ansatz into these equations leads to a complicated set of second order ordinary differential equations for the functions @xmath41 , @xmath42 , and @xmath43 .",
    "one can take solutions in this case and re - express them in a gauge where @xmath44 only has time component . in this frame",
    ", the solution will also satisfy the hoava - lifshitz field equations .    in holography ,",
    "the coordinates @xmath45 are identified with the dual field theory , while @xmath46 is the bulk radial coordinate .",
    "lifshitz scaling by definition is an anisotropic scaling of space and time in the field theory : @xmath47 . in the full bulk metric we require an invariance under this scaling , with @xmath48",
    "this leads to the asymptotic form as @xmath49 @xmath50 when @xmath7 we have the standard ads asymptotic metric .",
    "if we plug this generic form into the field equations , one finds the following consistency conditions for it to be a solution @xcite , @xmath51 asymptotically lifshitz solutions were first studied in detail in @xcite in four - dimensional spacetime ( @xmath52 ) by expanding the field equations in a power series around @xmath53 .",
    "it was found that the behavior of solutions separates into two classes depending on if @xmath7 or @xmath0 . in the @xmath7 case",
    "there is a solution characterized by two free parameters @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
    "the series solution for @xmath42 and @xmath41 truncates and it was ultimately shown that there is a full analytic solution for general @xmath46 given by @xmath56 this solution depends only on @xmath14 . note that for @xmath7 , @xmath57 .",
    "in the @xmath0 case there appears to be no analytic solution for general @xmath46 .",
    "the behavior of asymptotic solutions was determined to be dependent on the analyticity properties of the solution ansatz .",
    "if we assume the functions @xmath41 , @xmath42 , and @xmath43 are of the form of their leading asymptotics ( [ asymptotics ] ) times an analytic function , then the resulting series solution depends generically only on one free parameter . on general grounds",
    "@xcite there should be a two parameter family of solutions near infinity .",
    "this indicates this ansatz is a restrictive special case that does not reflect the general properties of the asymptotic solutions .",
    "instead @xcite noted that one can allow for non - analytic behavior by imposing @xmath58 substituting into the field equations , it was found that @xmath59 restricting attention to non - negative cases . in general @xmath60",
    "is not an integer . in this way it was found that @xmath0 solutions are indeed characterized generically by two free parameters which are the coefficient of @xmath61 in the expansion for @xmath43 and the coefficient of @xmath62 in the expansion of @xmath41 .",
    "note that in special cases where @xmath0 one can choose @xmath13 so that @xmath60 in ( [ deltacondition ] ) is an integer . in this particular case one",
    "has an analytic power series solution around infinity that depends on two free parameters .",
    "recently , @xcite studied asymptotic lifshitz solutions for the three - dimensional case ( @xmath63 ) .",
    "they imposed the following condition of analyticity on the power series solutions around infinity @xmath64 where @xmath65 and @xmath66 is the timelike killing vector field . in order to have a non - zero and finite adm - like mass it was found that @xmath67 .",
    "the field equations imply that there is a restriction to a subset of solutions with particular @xmath13 .",
    "the relevant condition on the couplings is @xmath68 where @xmath69 is an integer @xmath70 .",
    "the solution again depends on two free parameters .",
    "the advantage of these power series solutions is that one can define and read - off the total mass ( per unit volume ) of the black hole and then construct a first law of thermodynamics based on the temperature and entropy of a universal horizon .",
    "however , in the following we will show in many cases that there are regular black holes with universal horizons that do not necessarily have analytic behavior near infinity .",
    "asymptotically lifshitz solutions are generally characterized by two free parameters . however , there is no guarantee that these solutions are regular everywhere in the bulk interior .",
    "singularities generically arise at the location of the horizon associated with the spin-0 mode @xcite . in the @xmath7 case",
    ", the speed of the spin-0 mode ( [ speeds ] ) is infinite , so the horizon in this case coincides with the universal horizon .",
    "the universal horizon is defined as the spacelike surface where @xmath66 is orthogonal to the aether , i.e. @xmath71 . for the @xmath52 global analytic solution , imposing regularity at the universal horizon amounts to one additional condition relating @xmath54 to @xmath55 , @xcite i.e. @xmath72 where @xmath73 is the location of the universal horizon .",
    "@xmath74 is proportional to the total mass per area of the black hole .",
    "therefore one is left with parameter family of regular black hole solutions . an analogous solution in the @xmath63 case",
    "was later found in @xcite .",
    "we now want to determine numerically whether other one parameter families of regular solutions exist when @xmath0 . following @xcite",
    "the idea is to impose regularity at the spin-0 horizon and then integrate outwards to infinity , demanding the lifshitz asymptotic conditions ( [ asymptotics ] ) . practically , to implement this we redefine @xmath75 where @xmath76 and @xmath77 should approach a constant plus corrections near infinity , while @xmath78 goes to unity .",
    "asymptotic values of @xmath79 and @xmath80 depend on a choice of initial conditions at the spin-0 horizon , which is a reflection of the scaling freedom in the time coordinate @xmath81 . under this rescaling @xmath82 but the combinations @xmath83 and @xmath84 are invariant .",
    "thus asymptotically lifshitz conditions are imposed universally by demanding these combinations of functions approach unity at infinity .    for simplicity ,",
    "the next step is to fix @xmath85 so that the location of the spin-0 horizon coincides with the usual metric / killing horizon in the bulk which is where @xmath86 .",
    "fixing @xmath5 fixes @xmath24 and then this condition can be used to solve for @xmath13 @xmath87 this choice can be made without loss of generality by making the following field redefinition of the metric and the aether for a theory with arbitrary @xmath88 @xmath89 which maps @xmath90 into @xmath88 and has the effect of mapping arbitrary @xmath91 into @xmath92 .    to impose regularity at the horizon we consider a series solution ansatz @xmath93 where @xmath94 is the location of the spin-0 horizon .",
    "using the time rescaling freedom discussed above we can fix one value , say @xmath95 , at the horizon . plugging into the field equations , we find that the values of @xmath96 , @xmath97 and @xmath98 are determined ( in a very complicated form using maple ) in terms of @xmath94 and @xmath99 .",
    "thus , there is a two parameter family of regular spin-0 horizon solutions in the lifshitz case , which agrees with the earlier @xmath100 results in @xcite .",
    "these local solutions of course will not generically be asymptotically lifshitz .",
    "to find regular lifshitz black holes we use the shooting method .",
    "we fix a small value of @xmath101 and use the series solution above to find the initial radial values .",
    "then we integrate the field equations , a set of ordinary differential equations , out to infinity .",
    "the initial values depend on @xmath99 and we tune this value until the combinations @xmath102 and @xmath103 approach unity at very large values of @xmath46 , say @xmath104 . if the procedure finds a solution we will have a fixed numerical value of @xmath105 , meaning that the asymptotic condition has eliminated an additional free parameter .",
    "the resulting solution will depend on one free parameter @xmath94 ( similar to the schwarzschild solution in gr , asymptotically flat einstein - aether black holes in @xcite and finally the @xmath7 solution found in @xcite ) . to determine the solution in the interior",
    ", we then take the value of @xmath99 and use the series solution for small negative @xmath106 to provide the necessary initial data to integrate inwards .",
    "first we study the three - dimensional hoava - lifshitz theory can focus first on the @xmath1 case .",
    "@xmath107 is likely the case of most relevance for physical systems since in field theory the symmetry group can be enhanced to include galilean symmetries . for a range of @xmath14 up to about @xmath108",
    "we find regular solutions . in the shooting process",
    "one can see that for a range of @xmath99 the values of @xmath102 and @xmath103 are @xmath109 for very large @xmath46 while for others they become @xmath110 .",
    "the tuning leads to the set of values displayed in table 1 where the asymptotic conditions are met .",
    ".[bhproperties ] values of the shooting parameter for several @xmath14 values in @xmath63 , in units with @xmath111 . [ cols=\"^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the behavior of the functions for @xmath112 is shown in figure 1 .",
    "we have chosen the standard normalization / gauge where @xmath79 and @xmath80 approach unity at infinity .",
    "+    we performed a non - linear curve fit of this data to the asymptotic forms @xmath113 the results yielded @xmath114 , @xmath115 , @xmath116 , which differs from the fall - off condition ( [ mattingly ] ) in ( @xcite ) and is consistent with non - analytic ( non - integer expansion ) in @xmath105 and @xmath77 .",
    "while the solutions have a regular spin-0 horizon , for there to be a black hole in hoava - lifshitz gravity , modes of arbitrary speed must be trapped , so we require a universal horizon .",
    "a universal horizon is located where @xmath117 vanishes . for @xmath118 @xmath119",
    "is negative . a plot of @xmath120 versus @xmath121 in the interior is shown in figure 2 .",
    "+    at @xmath122 , @xmath119 vanishes so there is indeed a universal horizon present .",
    "in addition , note that the @xmath119 function tends to oscillate , so additional interior universal horizons appear at for example @xmath123 and @xmath124 .",
    "this is the same type interior oscillation found in @xcite for asymptotically flat solutions in four - dimensions . to see this behavior more clearly",
    ", we plot the function @xmath102 versus @xmath121 in figure 3 .",
    "+    again this is qualitatively the same type of behavior noted previously in the asymptotically flat cases .",
    "the only noticeable change in the functions with @xmath14 is that as its value increases , the size of the interior peak(s ) in @xmath78 tends to decrease and the oscillation tends to smooth out .",
    "see figure 4 .",
    "+    at and beyond @xmath125 no solutions appeared to exist generically .",
    "however , this particular value range may be an artifact of numerical errors or inaccuracies in our simple first order series solution around the horizon .",
    "solutions may exist for somewhat larger values . also for larger @xmath14 there may be special solutions present . in @xcite ,",
    "a regular black hole solution was found numerically with @xmath126 , which satisfies ( [ 3dcondition ] ) for @xmath127 . for this choice of @xmath14",
    ", we indeed found a nearly regular solution , at a very fined tuned value of the shooting parameter .",
    "a singularity appeared at large @xmath128 , which seems likely to be due to numerical errors or an inaccuracy .",
    "now we will consider cases with larger values of the dynamical exponent @xmath5 .",
    "first we examined @xmath129 . in this case for a range of @xmath14 the behavior of the solutions was different than in @xmath1 . as we tuned the value of @xmath99",
    "the asymptotic values of @xmath102 and @xmath103 tended to remain very close to unity but always below it .",
    "for example , for @xmath130 for @xmath99 between 0.94 and 1.75 the value of @xmath102 varied from 0.9843 to 0.9705 .",
    "below @xmath131 the initial conditions become complex .",
    "there was never a case where the asymptotic values became greater than unity .",
    "we found the same type of behavior for @xmath132 and also @xmath133 .",
    "this indicates there are generically no regular asymptotically lifshitz black holes for @xmath3 , but it would be useful to probe this regime in more detail .",
    "perhaps @xmath1 is another special value ( like @xmath7 ) where solutions exist . to check this we considered the case where @xmath2 .",
    "here we found again regular solutions for a range of @xmath88 , similar to the @xmath1 case . in figure 5 , we have plotted the solution @xmath112 , which shows similar behavior to the @xmath1 case ( with less oscillation of @xmath78 )     +      now we consider four - dimensional black hole solutions .",
    "the behavior in this case throughout is qualitatively similar to the three - dimensional case .",
    "first , for a range of @xmath14 ( here up to about 0.4 ) we found regular @xmath1 solutions .",
    "an example is shown in figure 6 .     +    performing",
    "a non - linear curve fit of our data for @xmath78 to @xmath134 leads to a reasonable agreement between @xmath60 ( @xmath135 ) and the value obtained in ( [ deltacondition ] ) ( @xmath136 here ) required by the non - analytic expansion around infinity .",
    "in the interior , there are universal horizons associated with the same type of oscillations appearing in @xmath63 oscillations , and as @xmath14 increased the behavior of the functions was the same as in the @xmath63 case .",
    "we again consider @xmath3 , following the same methods as in the three - dimensional case . as we tuned the value of @xmath137 the asymptotic values of @xmath102 and @xmath103 again tended to remain very close to unity but always below it .",
    "for example , for @xmath130 and for @xmath137 between 1.605 and 0.919 the value of @xmath102 varied from 0.999179 to 0.9995 .",
    "below @xmath138 the initial conditions become complex .",
    "we again conclude that no asymptotic lifshitz solutions of this type exist .",
    "finally , we again found solutions for @xmath2 which are qualitatively similar to the @xmath2 solutions in @xmath63 .",
    "an example is plotted in figure 7 .",
    "we found numerically a new class of @xmath0 asymptotically lifshitz black hole solutions in three and four dimensional hoava - lifshitz gravity .",
    "this class of solutions is distinguished by the non - analytic behavior of the solution near infinity .",
    "in particular , for @xmath1 and @xmath139 , solutions exist for a range of @xmath14 .",
    "we also studied the properties of the solution inside the horizon and showed there is oscillatory behavior in the aether field , just as in the asymptotically flat case .",
    "interestingly , for @xmath3 , there seem to be generically no solutions of this type , although particular solutions with special values of @xmath88 parameters are likely to exist .    in the future , it would be interesting to understand the nature of the non - analytic asymptotic solution in these cases .",
    "while a regular universal horizon exists , it is not clear whether one can define a corresponding adm - like mass for these solutions that can used to study black hole thermodynamics , such as the first law .",
    "are there other distinguishing properties of solutions , such as stability or instability ? from the point of view of holography ,",
    "these black holes describe the thermal state of a dual field theory with @xmath0 .",
    "what does the nature of the asymptotic solution here tell us about the properties of the dual theory ? finally , for other holographic applications , these solutions ( in four - dimensions ) may also be useful as background one can perturb in the fluid - gravity setting , following @xcite .",
    "for example , it would be interesting use these black holes to study the characteristics of fluid transport coefficients in cases where @xmath0 .",
