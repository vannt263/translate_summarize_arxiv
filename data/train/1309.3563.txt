    "a prolonged , quiescent period followed the creation of the universe . eventually , minuscule dark matter density perturbations initiated the collapse of dark matter , forming gravitational potential wells and giving rise to the condensation of primordial gas clouds ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "this process furnished the universe with the earliest building blocks , laying the foundation for cosmological structure .",
    "separate building blocks ( i.e. , gas fragments ) underwent independent chemical enrichment before conglomerating to form larger systems .",
    "evidence of this hierarchical formation @xcite remains observable today through the accretion of satellite systems onto the milky way halo .",
    "although the formation history of the galaxy is tangled and chaotic , it serves as an excellent  and more importantly , accessible  laboratory to investigate the evolution of the universe since the earliest times .",
    "many stars in our galaxy have formed in - situ , but a significant fraction have also been added through the accretion of smaller systems onto the milky way ( for a review see * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "as these satellite systems move in towards the galaxy s gravitational potential , they are disrupted by tidal forces , causing loosely gravitationally bound stars to be strewn in forward and trailing directions as tidal tails or ` stellar streams ' .",
    "the observational evidence for ongoing accretion has significantly increased in the last decade since the discovery of the sagittarius dwarf spheroidal undergoing tidal disruption @xcite .    amongst the known substructures in the halo , the orphan stream is particularly interesting .",
    "@xcite and @xcite independently discovered the stream , spanning over @xmath2 in the sky from ursa major in the north to near sextans in the south , where the sdss coverage ends .",
    "the stream has properties that are unique from other halo substructures .",
    "it has an extremely low surface brightness , ranging from 32 - 40mag arcsec@xmath3 , and a full width half - maximum of @xmath02@xmath4 on sky . at a distance of @xmath020kpc @xcite",
    ", this corresponds to @xmath0700pc .",
    "the cross - section and luminosity of the stream are directly related to the mass and velocity dispersion of the parent satellite @xcite .",
    "the orphan stream width is significantly broader than every known globular cluster tidal tail @xcite and larger than the tidal diameter of all known globular clusters ( * ? ? ?",
    "* edition ) .",
    "as @xcite notes , if the cross - section of the stream is circular , then in a simple logarithmic potential with @xmath5 km s@xmath6  a reasonable first - order approximation for the milky way  the expected random velocities of stars would be required to be @xmath7 km s@xmath6 in order to produce the stream width .",
    "such a velocity dispersion is significantly larger than the expected random motions of stars that have been weakly stripped from a globular cluster , implying that the orphan stream s progenitor mass must be much larger than a classical globular cluster .",
    "photometry indicates the stream is metal - poor , implying that negligible star formation has occurred since infall began several billion years ago . for a stream of this length to remain structurally coherent over such a long timescale ,",
    "the progenitor is also likely to be dark - matter dominated . in their discovery papers , @xcite and @xcite concluded that the likely parent of the orphan stream is a low - luminosity dwarf spheroidal ( dsph ) galaxy .",
    "@xcite were able to map the distance and velocity of the stream across the length of the sdss catalogue using blue horizontal branch ( bhb ) and f - turnoff stars .",
    "they found the stream distance to vary between 19 - 47kpc , extending the 20 - 32kpc distance measurements made by @xcite , and has been extended to 55kpc by @xcite .",
    "@xcite note an increase in the density of the orphan stream near the celestial equator @xmath8 , proposing the progenitor may be close to this position .",
    "the authors attempted to extend their trace of the stream using southern survey data ( e.g. supercosmos * ? ? ? * ) , but to no avail ; the stream s surface brightness is lower than the survey faint limit .",
    "it is still unclear whether the stream extends deep into the southern sky . @xcite",
    "observe an increase in surface brightness near the celestial equator , but given the stream is closest near the celestial equator @xcite , an increase in stream density may be expected given a constant absolute magnitude .",
    "nevertheless , with sdss photometry and radial velocities from the segue catalog , @xcite were able to derive a prograde orbit with an eccentricity , apogalacticon and perigalacticon of @xmath9 , 90kpc and 16.4kpc respectively .",
    "the ability to accurately trace the orphan stream to such extreme distances would make a powerful probe for measuring the galactic potential ( e.g. see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . from their simulations ,",
    "@xcite find a halo and disk mass of @xmath10 , and similarly @xcite find @xmath11 , which is @xmath060% lower than that found by @xcite and @xcite , and slightly lower than the virial mass of @xmath12 derived by @xcite .",
    "metallicities derived from segue medium - resolution spectra confirm photometric estimates indicating that the stream is metal - poor .",
    "a mean metallicity of [ fe / h]@xmath13dex is found from bhb stars , with a range extending from @xmath141.3 to @xmath153dex @xcite .",
    "@xcite also find a wide range in metallicities by tracing rr lyrae stars along the stream : [ fe / h ] = @xmath16 to @xmath17dex .",
    "however if f - turnoff stars from the @xcite sample are included , the metallicity distribution function extends more metal - rich from @xmath153 to @xmath140.5dex .",
    "the situation is complicated by interlopers and small number statistics , so the full shape of the metallicity distribution function ( mdf ) is unknown . to this end , @xcite observed low - resolution spectroscopy for hundreds of stars towards the stream at the celestial equator .",
    "the authors targeted the less numerous k - giants ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* where a mere 1.3 red giant branch stars are expected per square degree ) and found a very weak detection of the stream from kinematics alone . using wide selections in velocity , distance , proper motions , metallicities , and surface gravity , they identified nine highly likely orphan stream giants .",
    "the velocity dispersion of their candidates is within the observational errors ( @xmath18 km s@xmath6 ) , suggesting the stream is kinematically cold along the line - of - sight .",
    "like @xcite ( and independently confirmed by @xcite ) , they also found an extended range in metallicities : two stars below [ fe / h ] @xmath19 and two stars near [ fe / h ] @xmath20dex , all of which are consistent with stream membership .",
    "the mean metallicity of their sample was [ fe / h]@xmath21dex , with a wide dispersion of @xmath22 } ) = 0.56$]dex .",
    "it appears the orphan stream may have an extremely wide range in metallicity , consistent with the internal chemical enrichment typically observed in dwarf spheroidal ( dsph ) galaxies @xcite .",
    "as the name suggests , the orphan stream s parent satellite has yet to be found . in an effort to identify a progenitor ,",
    "a number of systems have been identified as being plausibly associated with the orphan stream .",
    "these include the linear complex a hi clouds , as well as the globular clusters palomar 1 , arp 2 , terzan 7 and ruprecht 106 .",
    "these systems were all identified along the great circle path of the stream .",
    "the low - luminosity dwarf satellites segue 1 and ursa major ii also lie along the great circle , although segue 1 was considered an extended globular cluster until recently @xcite .",
    "@xcite first noted a possible association between the orphan stream , ursa major",
    "ii and complex a. @xcite and @xcite explored the possible association between the orphan stream with complex a and ursa major ii , respectively . in the best - fitting complex a model , the predicted heliocentric velocities",
    "did not match those found by @xcite , or later observations by @xcite .",
    "the expected distances were also under - estimated by a factor of @xmath233 when compared with observations , making the association with complex a tenuous at best . in the ursa major ii scenario , the stream s on - sky position was required to exactly overlap with a previous wrap , a somewhat contrived and unlikely scenario .",
    "@xcite found that the ursa major ii - orphan stream connection was also not compelling , as the observed stream kinematics were not consistent with the ursa major ii model .",
    "simulations involving the complex a and ursa major ii associations introduced an a priori assumption that the object ( e.g. ursa major ii or complex a ) was related to the orphan stream , and consequently found an orbit to match .",
    "in contrast , @xcite approached the problem by fitting an orbit to a single wrap of the data , without assuming a parent satellite a priori .",
    "their @xmath24-body simulations were inconsistent with either a complex a or ursa major ii association . instead",
    ", the authors favor a progenitor with a luminosity @xmath25 or an absolute magnitude @xmath26 , consistent with the observation by @xcite of @xmath27 .",
    "simulations by @xcite suggest the progenitor may be similar to the present - day ` classical ' milky way dwarfs like carina , draco , leo ii or sculptor , but would be very close to being fully disrupted , which they suggest has occurred over the last 5.3 gigayear .",
    "time of infall is a critical inference .",
    "longer timescales produce streams that are too wide and diffuse , whereas shorter timescales do not reproduce the @xmath2360@xmath4 stream length .",
    "the degeneracies between these simulation parameters are important to note , but in any case , there are robust conclusions that can be drawn irrespective of those degeneracies . for example , @xcite note that a globular cluster has a central density too high ( @xmath28kpc@xmath29 ) to be fully disrupted along their orphan stream orbit within a hubble time . given this constraint , and the lower limit on luminosity ( @xmath30 ) , a globular cluster progenitor seems unlikely from their models .",
    "in addition to the work by @xcite , @xmath24-body simulations by @xcite exclude all known halo globular clusters as possible progenitors .",
    "they conclude with the postulation of two possible scenarios : the progenitor is either an undiscovered satellite located between @xmath31 and @xmath32 , or segue 1 is the parent system .",
    "segue 1 , an ultrafaint dwarf galaxy @xcite , resides at a similar distance ( @xmath023kpc ) along the great circle path of the orphan stream .",
    "segue 1 also shares velocities that are consistent with the orphan stream at its nearest point .",
    "moreover , both segue 1 and the orphan stream exhibit low velocity dispersions : on the order of @xmath04 km s@xmath6 . the similarities in position , distance , and velocities between the two systems are indeed striking . however , it is not the only system alleged to be associated with the orphan stream .",
    "given the extended apogalaction of 90kpc in the stream orbit found by @xcite , @xcite reasoned the stream may be the tidal tail of the massive globular cluster ngc 2419 .",
    "this system is the most distant and luminous outer halo globular cluster known ( @xmath085kpc , @xmath33 ) .",
    "it is unlike any other globular cluster in the milky way .",
    "spectroscopic studies have confirmed photometric observations by @xcite that the system is metal - poor ( [ fe / h ] @xmath34 ) , and identified a remarkable anti - correlation between mg and k abundances @xcite .",
    "the level of magnesium depletion ( [ mg / fe ] @xmath35 ) is not seen anywhere else in the galaxy or its satellite systems , neither is the enhanced potassium enrichment ( up to [ k / fe ] = 2 ) at the opposite end of this peculiar mg - k anti - correlation . if ngc 2419 is the parent of the orphan stream , then this unprecedented chemical signature ought to exist in disrupted stream members as an example of chemical tagging ( e.g. , see * ? ? ?",

    "three of the selected stream candidates have high probability of membership to the orphan stream .",
    "one target was classified with medium probability , and another with a low probability of membership .",
    "initially we planned to observe many more high - priority targets .",
    "however , after our last exposure of target star oss 18 , inclement weather forced us to relinquish the remainder of our observing time .",
    "the data were reduced using the carpy pipeline written by d. kelson .",
    "every reduced echelle aperture was carefully normalised using cubic splines with defined knot spacing .",
    "extracted apertures were stacked together and weighted by their inverse variance to provide a continuous normalised spectrum for each object .",

    "the forbidden oxygen region was sufficiently dominated by telluric absorption such that we deemed even a robust upper limit to be indeterminable .",
    "the [ mg / fe ] abundance ratios for the orphan stream targets are noticeably lower than any of the other @xmath1-elements .",
    "in fact , oss 18 and 3 exhibit solar or sub - solar [ mg / fe ] abundances , and the mean [ @xmath1/fe ] abundances in the lower panel of figure [ fig : alpha - fe ] are most affected by [ mg / fe ]",

    "the ignition of these burning phases occurs both from type ii sn of massive stars , and once an accreting white dwarf exceeds the chandrasekhar limit , causing spontaneous ignition of carbon and an eventual type ia supernova .",
    "the abundance of the fe - peak elements with respect to iron in the milky way are typically either flat ( i.e. , [ x / fe ] @xmath0 0 ; crii , ni ) or trend positively ( sc , cri , mn , cu ) with overall [ fe / h ] ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "scandium absorption profiles have appreciable broadening due to hyperfine splitting .",
    "as such , we have determined sc abundances for all stars from spectral synthesis with hyperfine splitting taken into account . however , for oss3 we found the broadening due to hyperfine structure to be negligible , and the variance in our synthesis measurements was larger than our abundance measurements . the mean scii abundance to be @xmath59 from synthesis of 5 lines , where the ews of 11 scii lines yields @xmath60 . therefore in the case of oss3 , we have adopted the scii abundances from ews .",
    "other fe - peak elements with hyperfine structure ( e.g. v , mn , co , cu ) have been synthesised with the relevant isotopic and/or hyperfine splitting included .",
    "the random measurement scatter in v , cr , and mn abundances is typically low ( @xmath610.05dex ) for all the standard and program stars .",
    "however for co , there was a noticeable increase in line - to - line scatter for the orphan stream stars compared to the standard stars .",
    "there is a factor of @xmath06 difference in @xmath40 ratio between the two samples which can explain this variance . in the orphan stream stars , no synthesised co profiles were sufficiently ` worse ' than each other to qualify exclusion .",
    "the case was quite different for ni , where a plethora of clean lines ( without appreciable hyperfine structure ) are available , and the uncertainties in @xmath62 abundances due to the uncertainties in stellar parameters generally cancel with @xmath63 , yielding excellent measurements of [ ni / fe ] .",
    "cu abundances and upper limits are derived from the synthesis of a single neutral cu line at 510.5 nm .",
    "the inclusion of hyperfine structure was most important for cu , as a cu abundance measured directly from an ew produced a systematically higher @xmath64 , on the order of + 0.4dex .",
    "zn abundances were calculated directly from the ews of the 472.2 nm and 481.0 nm transitions where available .",
    "all of our fe - peak abundances with respect to iron are consistent with the observed chemical trends in the milky way @xcite .",
    "the atomic absorption lines of these heavy elements have appreciable broadening due to hyperfine structure and isotopic splitting . where applicable , the relevant hyperfine and/or isotopic splitting has been employed , and solar isotopic compositions have been adopted .    sr and y are elements of the first @xmath65-capture peak . while only one line ( 421.5 nm ) was synthesised for srii ,",
    "generally three unblended y lines were available .",
    "when no y lines were detected above @xmath66 , an upper limit was ascertained from the 520 nm line  the strongest in our line list .",
    "sr and y abundances generally agree with each other in our stars , with the exception of high probability stream candidates oss 6 and oss 8 . in these cases",
    "only upper limits could be determined for yii , and those limits are @xmath00.6dex lower than our measured srii abundances .",
    "the remaining high probability candidate , oss 14 , also has an upper limit for yii ( [ y / fe ] @xmath67 ) but this limit is much closer to our srii measurement ( [ sr / fe ] = @xmath68 ) . the y upper limits for our high probability orphan stream stars results in lower limits for [ ba / y ] , which for oss 6 and oss 8 , are well in excess of the milky way trend ( figure [ fig : ba - y ] ) .",
    "lanthanum and neodymium abundances for our stars are consistent with the chemical evolution of the milky way .",
    "europium , a @xmath69-process dominated element , has been measured by synthesising the 664.5 nm euii transition .",
    "although the spread in [ eu / fe ] abundances for our stars is wide , no significant @xmath69-process enhancement is observed .",
    "although the standard error about the mean ( @xmath70 ) abundance in table [ tab : chemical - abundances ] can be quite low , the uncertainties in stellar parameters will significantly contribute to the total error budget for any given abundance .",
    "furthermore , the total uncertainty in abundance ratios ( e.g. , [ a / b ] ) depends on how the uncertainties in elements a and b are correlated with stellar parameters .",

    "the resultant covariance is given as :    @xmath76    covariance between @xmath48 and @xmath50 is calculated in the same manner .",
    "the total abundance uncertainty with respect to h and fe ( e.g. , @xmath77[x / h ] ) , @xmath51([x / fe ] ) ) for all species is given in table [ tab : chemical - abundance - uncertainties ] .",
    "these total uncertainties have been adopted in all figures throughout this text . due to the cancellation of systematic effects ,",
    "some abundance ratios with respect to iron have lower uncertainties than their quoted absolute abundance uncertainties .",
    "given the low surface brightness of the orphan stream , separating true members from interlopers can be particularly challenging . before inferring any properties of the undiscovered parent satellite from our sample",
    ", we must examine whether our targets are stars truly from the disruption of the orphan stream progenitor .",
    "when compared against the mean of our high priority targets , the velocities of the low and medium probability candidates are + 6.2 and @xmath78 km s@xmath6 different , respectively . given this region of the stream has a low intrinsic velocity dispersion @xcite , the significantly lower velocity of the medium - probability target , oss 18 , is intriguing .",
    "perhaps more concerning is that the low and medium probability candidates are markedly more metal - rich than the high - priority targets : [ fe / h ] = @xmath79 and @xmath80dex for oss 3 and oss 18 , a difference of @xmath81 and @xmath360.28dex from the low - resolution measurements , respectively .",
    "spectroscopic studies suggest the stream is significantly more metal - poor than [ fe / h ] @xmath82dex @xcite , making the association between the orphan stream and oss 3 or oss 18 tenuous .",
    "it is also worth noting that these targets are the farthest candidates ( @xmath83@xmath4 ) from the best - fit orphan stream orbital plane deduced by @xcite . on the basis of the observables we deduce that the lower probability members , oss 3 and oss 18 , are unlikely to be disrupted orphan stream members .    the three high - probability targets ( oss 6 , 8 and 14 ) have velocities within 2.4 km s@xmath6 of each other , consistent with the orphan stream velocity . these velocities from high - resolution spectra",
    "confirm the very low line - of - sight velocity dispersion in this part of the stream .",
    "the metallicities of these targets are also in reasonable agreement with those found from low - resolution spectroscopy , implying the candidates are @xmath020kpc away  at approximately the same distance as the orphan stream . for the remainder of this discussion , we consider oss 6 , 8 and 14 , to be true disrupted members of the orphan stream .",
    "although the sample size is small , the three orphan stream members have a wide range in metallicity , ranging from [ fe / h ] = @xmath84 to as metal - poor [ fe / h ] = @xmath85 . from three members not much can be said about the metallicity distribution , other than to say it is wide , and inconsistent with a mono - metallic population ( e.g. , a globular cluster ) .",
    "@xcite and @xcite found the stream to have a mean metallicity of [ fe / h ] @xmath86 from bhb and rr lyrae stars . according to the metallicity gradient along the stream reported by @xcite , we might expect a higher mean metallicity than [ fe / h ] @xmath87 in our sample closer to the celestial equator .",
    "we note that our metallicity spread of [ fe / h ] = @xmath84 to @xmath85 is consistent with that of @xcite : [ fe / h ] = @xmath16 to @xmath17 , and the somewhat wider spread found by @xcite : [ fe / h ] = @xmath88 to @xmath89 .",
    "a total metallicity spread as wide as @xmath01dex , or a standard deviation of @xmath22 } ) = 0.56 $ ] @xcite , is consistent with the stochastic chemical enrichment of the present - day dsph galaxies @xcite .",
    "this is also compatible with the constraints from the dynamical constraints placed inferred by the arc and width of the stream , which suggest the progenitor is a dark matter - dominated system .",
    "the abundance trends of individual elements track the star formation history of a cluster or galaxy . in the milky way ,",
    "this is most evident by the evolution of @xmath1-element abundances with increasing metallicity .",
    "the @xmath1-elements are produced in massive stars before being ejected to the interstellar medium by type ii supernovae . at later times ,",
    "type ia supernovae begin to contribute to the galaxy s chemical enrichment .",
    "type ia supernovae expel iron ( like type ii ) , but do not produce significant amounts of @xmath1-elements . as such , a net decrease in [ @xmath1/fe ] is observed upon the onset of type ia supernovae .",
    "this inflexion occurs in the milky way near [ fe / h ] @xmath90 , decreasing towards solar - like values .",
    "@xcite first noted that stars in the present - day dsph galaxies were separated in [ @xmath1/fe ] from the majority of the milky way stars . in the dsph galaxies ,",
    "a significant contribution of type ia supernovae is observable in [ @xmath1/fe ] abundance ratios near [ fe / h ] @xmath91dex , with the exception of draco , which shows low [ @xmath1/fe ] at all metallicities .",
    "some dwarf spheroidal stars also have a large range in [ @xmath1/fe ] values , increasing up to values seen in field stars .",
    "the orphan stream stars have low [ @xmath1/fe ] abundance ratios ( @xmath00.22 ) with respect to the milky way sample ( @xmath00.40dex ) .",
    "the low- and medium - probability members  which we deem to be field interlopers  also have low [ @xmath1/fe ] abundance ratios , but given their overall metallicity these @xmath1-element ratios are consistent with the thick disk enrichment of the milky way . since our orphan stream members ( i.e. , the high - probability members oss 6 , 8 and 14 ) are metal - poor , we can be confident we are not confusing their low-@xmath1 signature for the standard chemical enrichment of the milky way .",
    "we stress that [ @xmath1/fe ] , on its own , should never be used as a litmus test for accretion on to the milky way .",
    "one must carefully select candidates that appear to be stream members based on all the observables , and then examine their detailed abundances in order to infer the chemical evolution of the disrupted host .",
    "we are already quite confident these stars are truly disrupted orphan stream members , and as such , we can say that the low [ @xmath1/fe ] abundance ratios observed in the orphan stream are consistent with the low @xmath1-element enhancement of the present - day dsph galaxies .",
    "differences in [ ba / y ] ratios between the present - day dsph stars and the milky way have been observed by a number of groups @xcite . a number of possible explanations",
    "have been proposed to explain this offset , including changes in sne ii yields  or by changing the frequency of sne ii explosions via adjustments to the initial mass function  or altering the influence of @xmath1-rich freeze - out ( e.g. , see * ? ? ?",
    "* for a discussion ) .",
    "abundance ratios for the orphan stream stars and field standards . milky way and dsph data compiled by @xcite",
    "is also shown .",
    "markers and colours are the same described in figure [ fig : alpha - fe ] . ]    arbitrarily adjusting sne ii yields between two different nucleosynthesis sites appears a somewhat unlikely scenario . by employing sn frequency corrections in addition to using adjusted yields",
    ", @xcite can reproduce the low [ ba / y ] trends in the galaxy , but not the high [ ba / y ] ratios observed in the dsph galaxies . leaving sne ii yields unchanged",
    ", these offsets could alternatively be reproduced by simply adjusting the frequency of sne ii events through the truncation of the upper initial mass function ( imf ) . in effect , massive stars would be less numerous , which are thought to be the primary production sites for the first @xmath65-capture peak elements ( e.g. , yttrium in this case ) . because higher @xmath1-element yields are also expected for massive stars",
    ", this may affect both the [ ba / y ] abundance and the overall [ @xmath1/fe ] abundance .",
    "however , whether the upper imf differs between the dsph and the milky way remains an open question .",
    "we have lower limits in [ ba / y ] for all orphan stream stars .",
    "this is because y was not detected in any of the stream stars .",
    "the standard stars and lower probability stream targets all have [ ba / y ] ratios that are consistent with the milky way for their given overall metallicity .",
    "this is shown in figure [ fig : ba - y ] .",
    "although we have only lower limits for [ ba / y ] , in oss 6 and oss 8 these are @xmath0 + 0.5dex offset from the main component of the milky way . this is a similar offset as that observed in the present - day dsphs , as compiled by @xcite .",
    "for the most metal - poor stream star , oss 14 , our limit on y abundance yields a weak  but consistent  lower limit of [ ba / y ] @xmath92dex .",
    "we note that robust lower limits for [ ba / y ] in the most metal - poor dsph stars ( [ fe / h]@xmath93 ) are difficult to ascertain .      a number of associations have been proposed between the orphan stream and known milky way satellites .",
    "however , most have been shown to be either unlikely or implausible .",
    "here we discuss the possibility of association between the orphan stream and ngc 2419 , as well as segue 1 .",
    "the width and length of a tidal tail are a clear indication to the nature of the parent satellite .",
    "for the case of the orphan stream , these characteristics favor a dark - matter dominated system ( e.g. , a dwarf galaxy ) .",
    "however , given the large apogalacticon of 90kpc for the orphan stream , a relationship has been proposed between the orphan stream and ngc 2419 @xcite .",
    "ngc 2419 is the most distant ( @xmath94kpc )  and most luminous ( @xmath95 )  globular cluster in the milky way halo ( @xmath96kpc ) . just like the orphan stream ,",
    "the system is also quite metal - poor : [ fe / h ] = 2.15    stars in globular clusters are known to exhibit peculiar chemical patterns , most notably in an anti - correlation between sodium and oxygen abundances ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "following this , ngc 2419 is particularly special because it shows an unusual anti - correlation between magnesium and potassium , even stronger than the classical na - o anti - correlation .",
    "this chemical signature is so far unique to ngc 2419 , and illustrates the most extreme cases of mg - depletion and k - enhancement seen anywhere in the milky way , or its satellite systems @xcite .    ) and @xcite ( @xmath97 ) .",
    "standard stars and orphan stream candidates are shown with the same markers used in figure [ fig : alpha - fe ] . ]",
    "we do not find any orphan stream stars to be extremely depleted in [ mg / fe ] or enhanced in [ k / fe ] ( figure [ fig : mg - k ] ) , as found in ngc 2419 @xcite . if we consider two sub - populations in ngc 2419 : a mg - poor , k - rich and a mg - normal , k - poor sample , then a two sample kolmogorov - smirnoff test demonstrates that we can be at least 99.7% confident that our orphan stream members are inconsistent with being drawn from the mg - poor ngc 2419 population .",
    "we can not make such statements about the mg - normal population , since abundances for that sample are typical for the milky way .",
    "the mg - poor and mg - normal sub - populations each comprise about half of the observed ngc 2419 population @xcite .",
    "given the uniqueness of the mg - k anti - correlation , a single orphan stream star with significant mg - depletion or k - enhancement would have provided an exciting hint for the orphan stream parent .",
    "however , given the stream s large metallicity spread @xcite , this indicates the stream is unlikely to be associated with ngc 2419 given the cluster s small dispersion in overall metallicity ( 0.17dex ; * ? ? ?",
    "we therefore firmly rule out any association between ngc 2419 and the orphan stream .",
    "the only known satellite system with an ambiguous association with the orphan stream is segue 1 .",
    "the system resides in a particularly crowded region of the sky : it lies extremely close to the perigalacton of the orphan stream , and just south of the bifurcated sagittarius stream .",
    "the original discovery of segue 1 by @xcite suggested the system was an extended globular cluster , until recent studies showed the system was an ultrafaint dwarf galaxy @xcite .",
    "the similarities between segue 1 and the orphan stream are striking .",
    "in addition to being nearby on the sky , segue 1 s distance of 23kpc is consistent with the closest portion of the orphan stream .",
    "the velocities between the two systems are also coincident : + 114 km s@xmath6 for segue 1 and @xmath0 + 120 km s@xmath6 for the nearest portion of the stream .",
    "additionally , both systems exhibit extremely low velocity dispersions , on the order of 3 - 8 km s@xmath6 .",
    "however , stars linking the two systems have yet to be found .",
    "the association between the two is not obvious . as @xcite summarises , ` _ are they just ships passing in the dark night ? _ '    the characteristics of the orphan stream are clues to the nature of its progenitor : the arc length and intrinsic width suggests the parent system must be dark matter - dominated .",
    "segue 1 is the most dark matter - dominated system known , such that it has become a prime focus for indirect dark matter detection experiments @xcite .",
    "however , there are some doubts as to whether segue 1 has experienced any tidal effects @xcite .",
    "segue 1 is well within the galactic tidal field , and initial indications of east - west tidal effects @xcite seem to have been complicated by the crowded region bordering the system @xcite .",
    "presently , no stars or tails clearly connecting the two systems have been found .",
    "the chemistry of segue 1 is particularly relevant here .",
    "segue 1 hosts an extremely wide range in stellar metallicities : the mean is found to be [ fe / h ] @xmath98 and the spread extends from [ fe / h ] = @xmath99 to @xmath100dex @xcite .",
    "there is significant overlap between the metallicity distributions reported for segue 1 and the orphan stream .",
    "the high - resolution spectra in this study confirm the wide metallicity range of orphan stream members found by @xcite , and independently reported by @xcite ( [ fe / h ] @xmath101 to @xmath17 ) .",
    "thus , in addition to on - sky position , distances , velocity , and velocity dispersion , segue 1 and the orphan stream share a wide and consistent range in metallicities .",
    "in contrast to these observables , @xcite and frebel et al .",
    "( submitted ) find segue 1 members to be extremely @xmath1-enhanced ( [ @xmath1/fe ] @xmath102 ) , unlike what we observe in disrupted orphan stream members .",
    "we note that although the two systems appear to be related in some respect , if segue 1 were the ` parent ' of the orphan stream , the differing [ @xmath1/fe ] abundances and lack of tidal features surrounding segue 1  after extensive examination  is somewhat puzzling .",
    "furthermore if segue 1 is the disrupted host , and if the stream metallicity gradient presented by @xcite is correct , that implies the stream becomes more metal - rich at greater distances from the parent system , contrary to what is typically observed .",
    "we present a chemical analysis of five orphan stream candidates , three of which we confirm are true members from the disrupted orphan stream parent satellite .",
    "the two non - members were both originally identified to have ` low ' or ` medium ' probability of stream membership from the low - resolution spectroscopy by @xcite .",
    "we encourage high - resolution spectroscopic follow - up of the remaining high - probability orphan stream members presented in @xcite .",
    "this work demonstrates the first detailed chemical study of the orphan stream from high - resolution spectra .",
    "a large metallicity spread is present in the orphan stream members , confirming the work by @xcite and @xcite that the orphan stream is not mono - metallic .",
    "the spread in overall metallicity is consistent with the internal chemical evolution of the present - day dwarf galaxies .",
    "detailed chemical abundances confirm this scenario .",
    "low [ @xmath1/fe ] element ratios are observed in the stream stars , and lower limits of [ ba / y ] are ascertained , which sit well above the bulk component of the milky way for two of the three stream members .",
    "thus , we present the first detailed chemical evidence that the parent of the orphan stream is a dwarf galaxy .    on the basis of chemistry",
    ", we exclude the extended globular cluster ngc 2419 as a plausible parent to the orphan stream . no firm link between segue 1 and",
    "the orphan stream has been identified . while the wide range in metallicities adds to the phase - space similarities between the two systems , the substantial difference in [ @xmath1/fe ] abundance ratios places doubt on any association .",
    "it appears the disrupting dwarf galaxy parent may reside in the southern sky , just waiting to be discovered .",
