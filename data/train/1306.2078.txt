    "<S> the ground states and collective excitations of trapped fermion gases consisting of atoms with magnetic dipole moment are studied using a time - dependent density - matrix approach . </S>",
    "<S> the advantages of the density - matrix approach are that one - body and two - body observables are directly calculated using one - body and two - body density matrices and that it has a clear relation to the hartree - fock ( hf ) and time - dependent hf theory . </S>",
    "<S> the hf calculations show the magnetization of the gases when the dipole - dipole interaction is strong . it is shown that the tensor properties of the dipole - dipole interaction are revealed in the excitation modes associated with spin degrees of freedom . </S>"
