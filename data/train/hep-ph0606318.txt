    "( 0,0 ) ( 120,110 )    in the next year the large hadron collider at cern will start operating at the up to now unreached tev energy scale .",
    "apart from putting our theoretical understanding of the electroweak symmetry breaking mechanism under scrutiny , new effects beyond the standard model that occur in this energy region can also be explored @xcite . a successful quantitative analysis and comparison of the lhc data with theoretical predictions",
    "will crucially rely not only on precise predictions for a variety of signal cross sections , but also on a sufficiently precise knowledge of the various backgrounds .",
    "although in some favourable cases the standard model backgrounds can be measured directly , for other important search channels this is not possible and backgrounds have to be determined through theoretical predictions .",
    "this is especially worrisome , as qcd predictions for multi - particle processes are plagued by large uncertainties arising from high powers of @xmath0 .",
    "large scale uncertainties make it mandatory to include radiative corrections beyond the leading order in qcd . unfortunately , due to the complicated singularity structure of qcd and the general combinatorial complexity of multi - scale problems , one - loop computations with more than four external partons / particles are a highly non - trivial and time - consuming task .",
    "fortunately , at the dawn of the lhc era , this research direction is very actively pursued by multiple groups @xcite .    in this",
    "talk i present our approach to this problem .",
    "the aim of our collaboration is to build a flexible and reliable tool , which allows for the evaluation of one - loop multi - leg amplitudes .",
    "it is based on a combination of algebraic and numerical methods .",
    "the corresponding project is called golem ( general one - loop evaluator for matrix elements ) and will be discussed in the next section .",
    "section 3 is dedicated to first applications of these methods relevant for lhc phenomenology .",
    "a general one - loop evaluator for matrix elements ( golem ) should proceed from a feynman diagrammatic representation of a given scattering amplitude to a computer code which provides a numerically stable and accurate answer for the desired cross section .    in a first step each amplitude",
    "can be represented in terms of irreducible lorentz tensors which correspond uniquely to gauge invariant operators : @xmath1 the mapping of the diagrammatic input onto such a tensorial basis can be accomplished with algebraic manipulation programs .",
    "we generally use form 3.1 @xcite .",
    "each feynman diagram @xmath2 can be projected onto these sub - amplitudes : @xmath3 the coefficients @xmath4 of the gauge invariant operators are momentum space integrals where free lorentz indices are contracted with external momentum vectors . in a third step these coefficients , which depend on mandelstam variables @xmath5 only , are expressed in terms of some integral basis to be discussed below : @xmath6 in a forth step , the coefficients have to be exported to some numerical programming language .",
    "optionally they can be simplified beforehand using algebraic programs like maple or mathematica : @xmath7 & &",
    ".                                            \\nonumber      \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    we now discuss the integral basis used for our reduction algorithms .",
    "following @xcite one can represent any given tensor integral by feynman parameter integrals in shifted dimensions : @xmath8 by applying differentiation by parts in parameter space and @xmath9 kinematical identities @xcite one can map all these integrals to the following basis without the need for higher dimensional scalar integrals with @xmath10 : @xmath11 and scalar integrals @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 .",
    "we call this basis the golem basis . note that any @xmath16-point function can be mapped to this basis without introducing inverse gram determinants , i.e. @xmath17 with @xmath18 , @xmath19 , which occur in passarino - veltman reduction .",
    "there are three alternatives for evaluating the basis elements :    * algebraic reduction to the one - loop master integrals @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath15 , * semi - numerical reduction to scalar + integrals , * direct numerical evaluation .    in this context ,",
    "semi - numerical means that the same reduction formulas as in 1 .",
    "are applied at the numerical level . in case 1 . and 2 .",
    "gram determinants are reintroduced .",
    "the direct numerical evaluation is chosen whenever numerically critical phase space regions are approached . for the numerical evaluation of the golem basis integrals",
    "two different methods have been developed .",
    "the first is based on contour deformation in feynman parameter space @xcite and the second on performing the cauchy integration explicitly @xcite .",
    "the latter method is faster , since ( at most ) 2- rather than 3-dimensional representations are used .",
    "we have tested the robustness of the numerical routines for large samples of realistic phase space points .",
    "the algebraic / numerical algorithms are implemented in the flexible fortran 90 code ` golem90 ` .",
    "using the algorithms discussed above , several computations relevant for lhc phenomenology have been carried out so far .",
    "we present three examples here , others can be found in @xcite .",
    "this process contributes to the dominant irreducible background to the higgs production process @xmath21 .",
    "it is also relevant below the @xmath22 threshold .",
    "the gluon - vector boson interaction is mediated by a quark loop . on - shell production results with massless @xcite and massive quarks",
    "@xcite have been known for a long time . for on - shell @xmath23 bosons , a phenomenological analysis can be found in @xcite .",
    "we have now a full calculation for off - shell @xmath23-pairs , where the first two quark generations are treated massless , but the bottom and top masses in the third generation are kept . in the latter case",
    "the amplitude contains six different scales : the mandelstam variables @xmath24 , @xmath25 , the @xmath23-virtualities @xmath26 , @xmath27 and the quark masses @xmath28 , @xmath29 . for this amplitude , it is possible to reduce algebraically down to master integrals , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 .",
    "the amplitude is represented by nine independent gauge - invariant structures .",
    "each coefficient can be written as a linear combination of 27 basis functions .",
    "the algebraic simplification results in amplitude representations which have at most one inverse gram determinant .",
    "the gram determinant is related to the transverse momentum of the @xmath23 bosons by @xmath33 . in this computation",
    "there is a tiny phase space region @xmath34 gev , @xmath35 which is numerically problematic , but it does not contribute sizably to the relevant cross sections @xcite . in tab .",
    "[ tab : gg2ww ] we show typical lhc cross sections for two massless generations and including the third generation .",
    "we also compare to the full nlo result for @xmath36 , which is computed using mcfm @xcite .",
    "cross sections without selection cuts ( tot ) , with standard lhc cuts ( std ) and higgs search cuts ( bkg ) are given ( see @xcite for details ) .",
    ".[tab : gg2ww ] background cross sections in fb for charged lepton pair production in gluon fusion @xmath37 .",
    "results for two and three quark generations are shown for different selection cuts .",
    "the last column shows the importance of the gluon fusion process ( 3 gen . )",
    "relative to the quark induced channel in nlo qcd . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     we find , up to an overall phase , @xmath38 the evaluation time for this point with our code is about 0.2 sec on a standard pc ( pentium 4 , 2.8 ghz ) .",
    "the evaluation of the full 6-quark amplitude including real emission corrections is in progress .",
    "in this talk we presented our golem approach for the evaluation of one - loop multi - leg processes relevant for precise lhc phenomenology .",
    "the formalism allows in principle for the evaluation of general @xmath16-point processes with massive and/or massless particles .",
    "the algebraic / numerical reduction and evaluation techniques are implemented in the fortran 90 code ` golem90 ` . as applications ,",
    "recent results for the gluon - induced processes @xmath20 , @xmath39 and the hexagon process @xmath40 were presented .",
