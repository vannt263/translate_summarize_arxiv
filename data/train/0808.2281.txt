    "much effort has been expended in fabricating deep sub - micron patterned magnets with the thin - film geometry . from the scientific point of view , such a small magnet is a good model system to study basic magnetism via a direct comparison with an idealized theoretical prediction . from the application point of view , a steady progress of the patterning technology for fabricating a smaller cell has led to magnetic devices such as spin - valve read sensors for the hard disk drive and magnetic random access memories ( mrams ) utilizing the spin - transfer torque ( stt )  @xcite into a higher density , i.e. a smaller magnetic volume .    thermal agitation of a magnetization becomes more and more important as the magnetic volume of a unit cell decreases . in the spin - valve read sensor ,",
    "the so - called `` mag - noise '' is a manifestation of the thermally excited ferromagnetic resonance in the sensor stack  @xcite . in the stt - mram",
    ", thermal agitation hinders a continuous miniaturization of the device because it can cause spontaneous changes of magnetization direction from one stable state to another .",
    "thermal relaxation time is a statistical time - scale for which a magnetization escapes from an initial local minimum state over an energy barrier .",
    "the thermal relaxation time @xmath0 of a magnetization is described by the nel - brown model  @xcite in the high energy barrier asymptote , @xmath1 $ ] where @xmath2 is the attempt frequency , @xmath3 is the energy barrier measuring the difference between a local minimum and a saddle point , @xmath4 is the boltzmann constant , and @xmath5 is the temperature in kelvin .    experimental studies on the thermal relaxation of magnetization generally assume a constant attempt frequency  @xcite . however , brown showed theoretically that the attempt frequency is not constant but depends on many parameters such as the damping constant and the magnetic properties  @xcite .",
    "followed by brown s initial work  @xcite , theoretical formulae of the attempt frequency for different potential symmetry were proposed  @xcite .",
    "accurate theoretical formulae of the attempt frequency are necessary for modeling experiments and predicting quantitatively the superparamagnetic limit for device applications .",
    "however , it is not easy to experimentally verify the theoretical formulae because i ) an experimentally measurable quantity such as the switching field is mostly governed by the energy barrier , not by the attempt frequency , and ii ) the damping constant , a key factor affecting the attempt frequency , of a small magnet is not definite in general  @xcite .    in this work , by means of a numerical study based on the stochastic landau - lifshitz - gilbert ( llg ) equation  @xcite , we investigate the validity of the proposed theoretical formulae .",
    "it is found that for a nanomagnet with the thin - film geometry , theoretically predicted values for the universal case are in excellent agreement with numerical estimates whereas theoretical values for the intermediate - to - high damping limit and the very low damping limit fail to reproduce numerical ones in practically meaningful ranges of the damping constant .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",

    "dependence of the attempt frequency on the damping constant for a non - axially symmetric potential was first theoretically predicted for two limiting cases ; i ) intermediate - to - high damping ( ihd ) case  @xcite , and ii ) very low damping ( vld ) case  @xcite .",
    "later , the universal theoretical equation  @xcite which is valid for all values of the damping constant was derived by extending the meshkov - melikov depopulation factor to the magnetic case  @xcite . in this work , numerical estimates of the attempt frequencies",

    "the magnetic potential @xmath6 of the sample a is axially symmetric since @xmath57 , whereas @xmath6 of other samples are non - axially symmetric since @xmath58 .",
    "the numerical results of the attempt frequency for the nanomagnet with an axially symmetric potential ( sample a ) are shown in fig .",
    "[ fg3](a ) . to our knowledge , the eq .",
    "( [ brown1 ] ) was tested once by adopting the same way used in this work  @xcite , and it was reported that the theoretical value of attempt frequency is different from the numerically estimated value by an order of magnitude .",
    "this inconsistency may have prevented further numerical studies on the attempt frequency .",
    "however , we found excellent agreement between the eq .",
    "( [ brown1 ] ) and numerically estimated values ( see fig .",
    "the difference between the result in the ref .",
    "@xcite and ours originates from the sign of @xmath21 in the eq .",
    "( [ brown1 ] ) .",
    "the @xmath21 should be negative since the magnetization is initially in a shallower local energy minimum , whereas it was assumed to be positive in the ref .",
    "the excellent agreement verifies the validity of our numerical approach to estimate the attempt frequency in this work .",
    "[ fg3](b ) , ( c ) , and ( d ) show the dependence of the attempt frequency on the damping constant for the sample b , c , and d , respectively .",
    "two features are worth mentioning .",
    "first , the attempt frequency increases with increasing @xmath59 . for instance , the attempt frequency of sample d is an order of magnitude higher than that of sample a in the wide range of damping constant ( fig .  [ fg3 ] ) .",
    "second , when the potential landscape is non - axially symmetric , there are two regimes of the damping constant where the attempt frequency shows an explicitly different dependence on the damping constant . at low damping ( @xmath60 ) , the attempt frequency increases with the damping constant whereas at high damping ( @xmath61 ) , it slightly decreases .    considering the increase of attempt frequency with @xmath59 , it should be noted that both eqs .",
    "( [ brown2 ] ) and  ( [ kilk ] ) contain @xmath62 which is an averaged curvature of potential at the local minimum .",
    "other terms do not vary much with @xmath59 .",
    "the @xmath24 is given by @xmath63 which is a constant for all four samples since both effective in - plane anisotropy field @xmath19 and external field @xmath7 are assumed to be constants .",
    "the @xmath25 is given by @xmath64 where @xmath65 ( @xmath66 ) is the demagnetization factor along the in - plane hard ( out - of - plane hard ) axis .",
    "the @xmath25 significantly varies with the sample shape since @xmath67 term is dominant .",
    "therefore , an important parameter to determine the attempt frequency is the coefficient @xmath25 which measures the curvature of potential along the direction cosine @xmath68 and is related to the out - of - plane demagnetization effect",
    ". a larger curvature of potential at a local minimum results in a higher attempt frequency .",
    "it is because the magnetization moving away from a local minimum due to a thermal random force experiences an instantaneous restoring force proportional to the curvature .",
    "the curvature @xmath25 becomes smaller and smaller as the aspect ratio of sample @xmath59 approaches the unity . among the tested samples",
    ", the sample d provides the largest @xmath25 and thus , the highest attempt frequency .    in order to understand dependence of the attempt frequency on the damping constant , we compare numerical results with the theoretical formulae ( eq .",
    "( [ brown2 ] ) ( ihd ) , ( [ kilk ] ) ( vld ) and ( [ cross ] ) ( universal ) ) from the fokker - planck equation for the nel - brown model . in the whole range of damping constant , the numerical results are in good agreements with the eq .",
    "( [ cross ] ) multiplied by factor 2 .",
    "the equations were derived for the escape of magnetization over only one shallower barrier assuming different barrier height between in - plane clockwise switching and counter clockwise one . in our case ,",
    "the two energy barriers are identical since no symmetry breaking exists , validating the multiplication by factor 2 .",
    "the theoretical values obtained from the eq .",
    "( [ brown2 ] ) ( ihd ) partially coincide with the numerical results in high damping regime ( @xmath69 ) , whereas the eq .",
    "( [ kilk ] ) ( vld ) predicts much higher attempt frequencies than the numerical results in the tested range of damping constant ( @xmath70 ) .    in the vld",
    ", the escape rate is evaluated from the energy loss per cycle of a particle on the escape rate trajectory  @xcite .",
    "the assumption made in deriving the eq .",
    "( [ kilk ] ) , replacing the energy loss per cycle of the almost periodic motion at the barrier energy by the barrier height , is necessarily crude and only applies when the damping constant is less than about 0.001 .",
    "the failure of eq .",
    "( [ kilk ] ) to estimate the attempt frequency is also found in the ref .",
    "@xcite where comparisons among the ihd escape rates , the vld escape rates , the universal solution based on the meshkov - melinkov depopulation factor , and the exact escape rate based on the continued fraction solution of the fokker - planck for the lowest eigenvalue were made . in the ref .",
    "@xcite , it is shown that the vld asymptote begins to fail for the damping constant of the order of @xmath71 even if the action on the escape trajectory is evaluated exactly whereas the universal solution provides a reasonably accurate approximation throughout the whole range of damping .",
    "therefore , it is obvious that the universal escape rate ( eq .  ( [ cross ] ) ) provides an accurate description of the behaviour of the exact escape rate provided that the barrier height is sufficient to allow one to define an escape rate .",
    "furthermore , since the damping constant in a typical nanomagnet with the thin film geometry is in the range between 0.005 to 0.03  @xcite where the vld and the ihd approximations show evidently wrong predictions for the attempt frequency , the eq .",
    "( [ cross ] ) should be used to design experiments and to interpret experimental results performed at non - zero temperatures .",
    "in a nanomagnet with the thin - film geometry , the demagnetization energy along the magnetic hard axis is a a main factor affecting the attempt frequency . comparing numerical estimates of the attempt frequency of magnetization with the theoretically predicted values",
    ", we verify the validity of the theoretical formula of the attempt frequency for the universal case",
    ". however , the theoretical formulae in the low damping limit and the intermediate - high damping limit fail to reproduce numerical values for the typical range of the damping constant .",
