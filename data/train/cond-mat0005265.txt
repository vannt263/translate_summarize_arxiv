    "early in life we perceive that everything around us , inanimate objects , animals and human beings undergo a variety of changes that accompany the passage of time .",
    "everything suffers a progressive deterioration with time .",
    "this phenomenon is called ageing or senescence and it is characterized by a decline in the physical capabilities of the individuals .",
    "several theories ( see @xcite and references therein ) have been suggested to explain why there is senescence , when it occurs and what are the biological processes responsible for it .",
    "usually , these theories are divided into three classes : biochemical , evolutionary and telomeric .",
    "the first invokes damages on dna , cells , tissues and organs and connect senescence with imperfections of the biochemical processes .",
    "one kind of this biochemical imperfection is the presence of free radicals which can cause death of the cells or may even lead to cancer @xcite .",
    "the evolutionary theory @xcite , on the other hand , explains the senescence as a competitive result of the reproductive rate , mutation , heredity and natural selection . in the telomere hypothesis @xcite",
    ", senescence depends on the cumulative number of cell divisions .",
    "the replication of a normal cell is followed by a telomeric shortening .",
    "this acts as a counting mechanism which controls the number of divisions .",
    "evolutionary theories of ageing are hypothetico - deductive in character , not inductive .",
    "they do not contain any specific genetic parameter , but only physiological factors and constraints imposed by the environment .",
    "there are two kinds : the optimality theory and the mutational theory . in the optimality theory @xcite ,",
    "senescence is a result of searching an optimal life history where survival late in life is sacrificed for the sake of early reproduction .",
    "for the mutational theory @xcite , on the other hand , ageing is a process which comes from a balance between darwinian selection and accumulation of mutations .",
    "the natural selection efficiency to remove harmful alleles in a population depends on when in the lifespan they come to express .",
    "alleles responsible for lethal diseases that express late in life , escape from the natural selection and accumulate in the population , provoking senescence .",
    "nevertheless , if the natural selection is too strong then deleterious mutations might not accumulate in the population and the eternal youth could be reached .",
    "an evolutionary model with such characteristics was recently studied and solved by onody and de medeiros @xcite .",
    "a simple evolutionary model of ageing is the partridge - barton model@xcite .",
    "it was introduced to illustrate the optimality theories of ageing .",
    "its principal feature is the inclusion of the antagonistic balance mechanism @xcite .",
    "this mechanism arises out from processes which enhance the lifespan early in life , but have deleterious effects latter .    in this work",
    ", we find an exact solution for the whole dynamics of the partridge - barton model .",
    "when only deleterious somatic mutations and pleiotropy are present the time evolution of the model can be formulated in a matricial form .",
    "explicit analytic expressions can be written for the mean survival probabilities and the growth rate . for large time @xmath0 ,",
    "the system behavior is dominated by the matrix largest eigenvalue .",
    "the existent integrals can be solved by the saddle point approximation , allowing us to determine precisely the steady state values of the survival probabilities .",
    "a time expansion for the population s mean age shows that it converges to a constant value according to a @xmath1 power law , a result which was first obtained by ray @xcite .",
    "all the results were confirmed by some monte carlo simulations that we performed .",
    "in the partridge - barton model there are only three ages .",
    "the population consists of babies @xmath2 , juveniles @xmath3 and adults @xmath4 .",
    "the survival probabilities from infancy to juvenile is @xmath5 and from juvenile to adulthood is @xmath6 .",
    "reproduction is permitted only to juveniles and adults , with rates @xmath7 and @xmath8 , respectively .",
    "babies do nt have offsprings and adults are eliminated from the population after reproduction .",
    "the population grows at a steady rate @xmath9 .",
    "the malthusian growth exponent @xmath9 is related to the other parameters of the model through a discrete version of the euler - lotka equation @xcite @xmath10 the antagonistic pleiotropy @xcite arises when the same gene is responsible for multiple effects .",
    "for example , genes enhancing early survival by promotion of bone hardening might reduce later survival by promoting arterial hardening .",
    "partridge and barton implemented the basic ideas of the antagonistic pleiotropy by adopting the constraint , @xmath11 , between the survival probabilities @xmath5 and @xmath6 . the parameter @xmath12 is a real positive number whose value depends on the kind of population we are dealing with .",
    "the pleiotropic condition states that it is impossible to sustain simultaneously both high juvenile and adult survivals . for the particular case in which @xmath13 and @xmath14 , partridge and barton found @xmath15 and @xmath16 as the values which maximize the growth rate @xmath9 .",
    "also the action of deleterious or helpful mutations can be added to the model .",
    "using monte carlo simulations , stauffer @xcite studied the case in which the pleitropic constraint @xmath17 is accompanied by random somatic mutations .",
    "his results clearly show that the survival probabilities @xmath5 and @xmath6 move rapidly to stationary values with @xmath18 .",
    "this fact means that the model exhibits senescence , in the sense that the adult survival is lower than the juvenile . in the absence of mutations , @xmath5 and @xmath6",
    "tend towards @xmath19 and @xmath20 in accord with the partridge - barton conclusions .",
    "however , it is not clear how the system drives itself towards these optimal values .",
    "in this section we obtain the exact time solution of the partridge - barton model in the presence of pleiotropy and somatic mutations .",
    "let @xmath21 be the number of individuals at age @xmath22 ( @xmath23 ) with survival probability between @xmath24 and @xmath25 at time @xmath0 .",
    "we choose , as initial condition , a population with the profile    @xmath26    that is , in @xmath27 there are only @xmath28 babies with the survival probabilities @xmath29 uniformly distributed in the interval @xmath30 $ ] .    at time @xmath0 ,",
    "all babies are equally submitted to somatic and deleterious mutations with strength @xmath31 ( @xmath32 ) .",
    "their survival probabilities @xmath33 are changed to @xmath34 .",
    "subsequently , all these babies pass through natural selection in a such way that , on average , the number of juveniles with survival probability @xmath5 at the instant @xmath35 is given by @xmath36 since the mutation is restricted to be",
    "_ somatic _",
    ", each one of the @xmath37 juveniles will give birth to exactly @xmath7 offspring with survival probability @xmath33 .",
    "now , the probability with which a juvenile will reach adulthood must take into account the antagonistic pleiotropy and the somatic deleterious mutations .",
    "as pleiotropy is not affected by the somatic mutations , a juvenile with survival probability @xmath5 ( formerly , a baby with survival probability @xmath33 ) will change its survival probability to @xmath38 , where @xmath12 is a real positive number and a measurement of the pleiotropic constraint . under the action of a deleterious somatic mutation , described by a parameter @xmath39 ( @xmath40 , fixed ) ,",
    "the new survival probability can be written as @xmath41 .",
    "submitting all juveniles to natural selection we get , on average , the number of adults with survival probability @xmath6 which is given by @xmath42 each one of these adults will generate @xmath8 descendants with survival probability @xmath33 since the mutations are _ not inherited_.    in general , the number of babies with survival probability @xmath29 is given by @xmath43 where @xmath34 and @xmath41 .",
    "if we substitute equation ( 5 ) into ( 3 ) we can write the following recursive matricial equation @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the matrix @xmath46 iterating the equation above and using the initial condition , we get for @xmath47 @xmath48 with @xmath49 meaning the identity matrix .    the complete dynamics of the partridge - barton model can be obtained by diagonalizing the matrix @xmath45 .",
    "we have , explicitly ( for @xmath47 ) @xmath50,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath51,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath52 are the eigenvalues of the matrix @xmath45 , @xmath34 and @xmath53 .",
    "let us point out that the time evolution of the babies distribution @xmath54 , can be calculated using equations ( 5 ) , ( 8) and ( 9 ) .",
    "having the expressions above , we can determine the evolution of many other quantities like the total number of inviduals at age @xmath22 @xmath55 or their _ mean survival probabilities _ @xmath56 .",
    "the given _ input parameters _ are the initial population @xmath28 , the birth rates ( @xmath57 and @xmath58 ) , the mutation strengths ( @xmath31 and @xmath39 ) and the pleiotropic constraint ( @xmath12 ) .",
    "before taking the asymptotic limit , we observe that @xmath59 is the largest eigenvalue for _ all _ possible values of the input parameters .",
    "once these parameters are fixed and @xmath60 , @xmath59 is in the last instance a function of @xmath61 . from the equation ( @xmath62 )",
    "we have , asymptotically    @xmath63}.\\ ] ]    by integrating in @xmath61 the expression above , we can get the total number of juveniles @xmath64 .",
    "it is convenient to change the integration variable @xmath61 for a new variable @xmath65 ( a monotonically increasing function of @xmath61 ) , @xmath66 , such that    @xmath67 } } { \\pi(1+y^2)}dy.\\ ] ]    for large time @xmath0 , this integral can be evaluated by the saddle point approximation .",

    "the optimization process was achieved by a direct ( and not well explained ) maximization of the growth rate . here , in our formalism , it is a simple and a natural consequence of taking the asymptotic time limit in the exact evolving equations .",
    "further , the growth rate or the malthusian exponent is simply given by @xmath72 $ ] .",
    "to have deepest insight in the dynamics , let us determine the probability density @xmath73 of finding a juvenile at time @xmath0 with survival probability between @xmath61 and @xmath74 .",

    "clearly , at the asymptotic limit , the distribution probability @xmath79 approaches the dirac delta function @xmath80 and the mean survival probability at age @xmath81 , is simply given by @xmath82 .",
    "similar results can be obtained for the ages @xmath83 and @xmath84 . another interesting quantity which can be calculated",

    "so we rederive , in a quite simple way , the power law decayment first found by ray @xcite .",
    "we solved exactly in this paper the partridge - barton model under the action of arbitrary pleiotropic constraints and deleterious somatic mutations . through a matricial formalism",
    "we were able to predict the complete time evolution of the population .",
    "we derived analytic expressions for the time dependence of the mean survival probabilities and the malthusian exponent . since for large time @xmath0",
    "the system behavior is controlled by the largest eigenvalue , it was possible to obtain the steady state values of the survival probabilities and to demonstrate , in a simple way , that the population mean age has a power law @xmath1 decayment to its final constant value .    for comparison with our analytical results",
    ", we also performed some monte carlo simulations . in these simulations , the natural selection is implemented by discarding any individual with survival probability smaller than a random number ( generated from a uniform distribution ) .",
    "the deleterious somatic mutations and the antagonic pleiotropy can be easily incorporated into the computer program .",
    "more difficult is to avoid an explosion of the computer s memory due to the unlimited growth of the population . to take this problem into account , we resort to the verhulst factor @xcite which is commonly used in such circumstances .    in figure 1",
    "we put together the analytical solution and the monte carlo result .",
    "the exact solution was plotted by inserting equations ( @xmath62 , @xmath90 and @xmath91 ) into the expressions for the mean survival probabilities @xmath92 and by integrating them using the software maple @xcite .",
    "we conclude that the monte carlo simulations confirm very well the theoretical results .",
    "finally , let us to point out that , unfortunately , the technique developed here can not be applied to the case in which mutations are hereditary .",
    "the main reason for this come from the fact that the equation ( @xmath93 ) is no longer valid .",
