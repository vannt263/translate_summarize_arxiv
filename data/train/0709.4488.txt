    "supernovae ( sne ) play a major role in the recent revival of observational cosmology .",
    "it is through comparison of high - redshift type ia supernova ( sn  ia ) magnitudes with those at low - redshift @xcite that two teams independently found the present rate of the universal expansion to be accelerating @xcite .",
    "this astonishing result has been confirmed in subsequent years out to redshift @xmath2 @xcite , but also at higher redshifts where the universal expansion is in a decelerating phase @xcite .",
    "currently , two ongoing projects have the more ambitious goal to measure the equation - of - state parameter , @xmath3 , of the `` dark energy '' that drives the expansion : the essence ( equation of state : supernovae trace cosmic expansion ; @xcite ) and snls ( supernova legacy survey ; @xcite ) projects .",
    "both teams have published their initial results , which indicate that @xmath3 , if constant , is consistent with a cosmological constant ( @xmath4 ) .",
    "the success of these cosmological experiments depends , among other things , on the assurance that the supernovae in the sample are of the correct type , namely , sne  ia . the classification of supernovae is based on their optical spectra around maximum light ( for a review see @xcite ) . at high redshifts , obtaining sufficiently high signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) spectra of such objects requires 12hr integrations at 6.510m - class telescopes ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , and constitutes the limiting factor for these experiments .",
    "recently , alternative classification methods based on photometry alone have been suggested @xcite , in anticipation of the next generation of wide - field all - sky surveys optimized for the detection of transient events ( dark energy survey , @xcite ; pan - starrs , @xcite ; skymapper , @xcite ; alpaca , @xcite ; lsst , @xcite ) .",
    "inclusion of supernovae that are of a different type leads to biased cosmological parameters @xcite .",
    "exclusion of genuine sne  ia from the sample leads to increased statistical errors on these same parameters .",
    "the secure classification of supernovae is a challenge at all redshifts , however .",
    "even with high s / n spectra , the distinction between supernovae of different types ( or between subtypes within a given type ) can pose problems .",
    "this points to the inadequacy of the present purely empirical sn classification scheme in establishing distinct classes of supernovae , whose observational properties can be directly traced back to an explosion mechanism and a progenitor system .",
    "the two major types of supernovae are defined based on the presence ( type ii ) or absence ( type i ) of hydrogen in their spectra , a distinction that does not reflect the differences in their explosion mechanisms and progenitors : through the thermonuclear disruption of a carbon - oxygen white dwarf star ( type ia ) , or through the collapse of the degenerate core of a massive star ( types ib , ic , and ii ) . for the latter case",
    ", it is now thought that a there exists a continuity of events between the types ii@xmath5ib@xmath5ic , corresponding to increasing mass loss of the outer envelope of the progenitor star prior to explosion @xcite .",
    "sne  iib are an intermediate case between type ii and type ib , and illustrate the tendency of some supernovae to `` evolve '' from one type to another .",
    "sne  ic supernovae are only defined by the _ absence _ of elements ( hydrogen and helium ; although see @xcite for the presence of hydrogen in sne  ib / c ) in their atmospheres and thus form a heterogeneous class which includes the supernovae associated with gamma - ray bursts @xcite .",
    "the classification scheme is further complicated by `` peculiar '' sub - classes of events associated with the four types ( ia , ib , ic , and ii ) .",
    "nonetheless , this classification scheme provides a means to keep track of general spectroscopic properties associated with the many supernovae discovered each year ( more than 550 in 2006 according to the international astronomical union ) and is useful for comparative studies of supernovae with similar characteristics .",
    "the spectrum of a supernova also contains information on its redshift and age ( defined as the number of days from maximum light in a given filter ) .",
    "knowledge of the sn redshift is necessary for the use of sne  ia as distance indicators ( although see @xcite for redshift - independent distances ) , and is usually determined using narrow lines in the spectrum of the host galaxy .",
    "when such a spectrum is unavailable , one has to rely on comparison with sn template spectra for determining the redshift , although we note that @xcite has recently presented a purely photometric redshift estimator for sne  ia , albeit with 35 times larger errors . the sn age is usually determined ( to within 1 day ) using a well - sampled light curve , but a single spectrum can also provide a good estimate ( to within 23 days for sne  ia ; @xcite ) , since the relative strengths and wavelength location of spectral features evolve significantly on the timescale of days .",
    "knowledge of the age of the supernova and its apparent magnitude and color at a single epoch can yield a distance measurement accurate to @xmath6 @xcite . moreover ,",
    "comparison of spectral and light - curve ages of high - redshift supernovae can be used to test the expected time - dilation factor of @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the redshift , in an expanding universe @xcite .",
    "we have developed a tool ( supernova identification [ ] ) to determine the type , redshift , and age of a supernova , using a single spectrum .",
    "the algorithm is based on the correlation techniques of @xcite , and relies on the comparison of an input spectrum with a database of high - s / n template spectra .",
    "fundamental to the success of the correlation technique is its application to objects that have counterparts in the template database .",
    "we briefly describe the cross - correlation technique in the next section , before presenting the algorithm for determining the redshift (   [ sect : z ] ) .",
    "we then briefly comment on the composition of our spectral database (   [ sect : sniddb ] ) , before testing the accuracy of correlation redshifts and ages using  in   [ sect : zt ] .",
    "last , in ",
    "[ sect : type ] , we tackle the issue of supernova classification by focusing on specific examples , some of which are particularly relevant to sn searches at high redshifts .",
    "the cross - correlation method presented in this section is extensively discussed by @xcite , where it is exclusively applied to galaxy spectra .",
    "we reproduce part of this discussion here to highlight the specificity of determining supernova ( as opposed to galaxy ) redshifts .",
    "sections [ sect : defs ] and [ sect : xcorz ] are rather technical , while ",
    "[ sect : preproc ] presents the more practical aspects of spectrum pre - processing necessary for the cross - correlation method .",
    "the correlation technique is straightforward : a supernova spectrum @xmath9 whose redshift @xmath10 is to be found is cross - correlated with a template spectrum ( of known type and age ) @xmath11 at zero redshift .",
    "we want to determine the @xmath12 wavelength scaling that maximizes the cross - correlation @xmath13 , where @xmath14 denotes the cross - correlation product . in practice , it is convenient to bin the spectra on a logarithmic wavelength axis . multiplying the wavelength axis of @xmath11 by a factor",
    "@xmath7 is equivalent to adding a @xmath15 shift to the logarithmic wavelength axis of @xmath11 , i.e. a ( velocity ) redshift corresponds to a uniform linear shift .",
    "supposing we bin @xmath9 and @xmath11 into @xmath16 bins in the range @xmath17 $ ] , each wavelength coordinate @xmath18 is given by    @xmath19    where @xmath20 is the size of a logarithmic wavelength bin , and assuming @xmath21 runs from 0 to @xmath16 .",
    "we then have :    @xmath22    where @xmath23 and @xmath24 . in what follows",
    "we assume that @xmath9 and @xmath11 have been normalized such that their mean is zero ( see   [ sect : preproc ] ) .    for computational ease and for pre - processing purposes ,",
    "the cross - correlation is computed in fourier space .",
    "let @xmath25 and @xmath26 be the discrete fourier transforms of the supernova and template spectra , respectively ( @xmath27 is the wavenumber ) :    @xmath28    let @xmath29 and @xmath30 be the rms of the supernova and template spectrum , respectively :    @xmath31    the _ normalized _ correlation function @xmath32 is defined as    @xmath33    such that if the supernova spectrum is the same as the template spectrum , but shifted by @xmath34 logarithmic wavelength bins i.e. @xmath35 , then @xmath36 .",
    "the fourier transform of the correlation function is    @xmath37    where @xmath38 denotes the complex conjugate of @xmath26 .",
    "following @xcite we assume that @xmath9 is some multiple @xmath39 of @xmath11 , but shifted by @xmath34 logarithmic wavelength bins :    @xmath40    unlike @xcite , however , we do not need to assume that @xmath41 is further convolved with a broadening symmetric function [ @xmath42 in @xcite , their eq .",
    "6 ] that accounts for galaxy stellar velocity dispersions and spectrograph resolutions .",
    "while there exists a velocity dispersion residual in @xmath32 primarily due to differences in the dynamics of the expanding envelope for different supernovae , this residual carries important information on the age of the supernova , which we also want to determine ( see   [ sect : zt ] ) , and on the specificity of @xmath9 , which is important for more general comparative supernova studies .",
    "second , the nominal doppler width of a supernova spectral `` feature '' is @xmath4312 orders of magnitude greater than the resolution of a typical low - resolution spectrograph .    to estimate @xmath39 and @xmath34 , we need to minimize the following expression :    @xmath44 ^ 2 \\\\ \\label{eqn : chi2exp } \\rightarrow \\chi^2(\\alpha,\\delta ) & = & \\alpha^2 n \\sigma_t^2 - 2\\alpha n \\sigma_s \\sigma_t c(\\delta ) + n \\sigma_s^2,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    using eqs .",
    "[ eqn : sigma2 ] and [ eqn : cnorm ] .",
    "we then obtain the condition for minimizing @xmath45 with respect to @xmath39 :    @xmath46 = 0,\\ ] ]    from which we derive @xmath47 satisfying the above :    @xmath48    substituting this value for @xmath39 back into eq .",
    "[ eqn : chi2exp ] , we obtain a new expression for @xmath45 :    @xmath49.\\ ] ]    as expected , minimizing @xmath45 is equivalent to maximizing the normalized correlation function @xmath50 .",
    "thus , the input supernova spectrum @xmath9 is cross - correlated with a template spectrum @xmath11 , and a smooth function ( here a fourth - order polynomial , as in @xcite ) is fitted to the highest peak in @xmath32 , whose height and center determine @xmath39 and @xmath34 , respectively .",
    "the cross - correlation redshift is then trivially computed as    @xmath51    where @xmath52 is the logarithmic wavelength bin defined in eq .",
    "[ eqn : dllog ] .",
    "the width of the peak is a measure of the error in @xmath53 and is of the order of the typical width of a supernova spectral feature , modulated by the signal - to - noise ratio of the input spectrum ( see   [ sect : zerr ] ) .",
    "it is important to note that we assume the noise per pixel to be constant in the input spectrum .",
    "this is clearly not the case for ground - based optical spectra , where sharp emission features from the sky background leads to increased noise at specific wavelengths .",
    "recently , @xcite found that scaling the input spectrum by the inverse - variance yielded a dramatic improvement in the derived cross - correlation redshifts ; specifically , @xcite rewrite eq .",
    "[ eqn : chi2 ] as    @xmath54 ^ 2,\\ ] ]    where @xmath55 is the noise per pixel of @xmath9 , and find that this is equivalent to simply scaling @xmath9 by @xmath56 .",
    "this modification is well suited for determining galaxy redshifts , since sharp features in the variance spectrum ( due to sky noise ) have widths comparable to galaxy lines and hence will affect the fourier transform of the correlation function , @xmath57 , at similar wavenumbers .",
    "however , we have found no such improvement for determining supernova redshifts .",
    "this is expected since supernova spectra consist of overlapping doppler - broadened lines whose widths ( @xmath58 ) are 12 orders of magnitude greater than sky emission features . however , noise from an underlying galaxy continuum can yield power at similar wavenumbers as @xmath57 and can significantly degrade the redshift accuracy when the fraction of galaxy light in the supernova spectrum is high ( see   [ sect : zt ] ) .",
    "as already mentioned , the input and template spectra are binned on a common logarithmic wavelength scale , characterized by @xmath59 ( eq .",
    "[ eqn : dllog ] ) .",
    "we show the result of mapping an input supernova spectrum onto a logarithmic wavelength axis with @xmath60@xmath61@xmath62 in fig .  [",
    "fig : lnlambda]_a , b_. the size of a logarithmic wavelength bin in this case is @xmath63 , from eq .",
    "[ eqn : dllog ] .",
    "so a shift by one bin in @xmath64 space corresponds to a velocity shift of @xmath65 .",
    "this is 1 order of magnitude less than the typical width of a supernova spectral feature , doppler - broadened by the @xmath66expansion velocity of the sn ejecta .",
    "the next step in preparing the spectra for correlation analysis is continuum removal @xcite . for galaxy spectra ,",
    "the continuum is well defined and is easily removed using a least - squares polynomial fit . in supernova spectra , however , the apparent continuum is ill - defined due to the domination of bound - bound transitions in the total opacity @xcite .",
    "dividing out a 13-point cubic spline fit to the spectrum ( over the entire 250010000wavelength interval ) is akin to removing a _ pseudo _ continuum from the supernova spectrum .",
    "we then subtract 1 from the resulting spectrum and apply a normalization constant for the mean flux to equal zero ( fig .",
    "[ fig : lnlambda]_c _ ) .",
    "this effectively discards any spectral color information ( including reddening uncertainties and flux mis - calibrations ) , and the correlation only relies on the _ relative _ shape and strength of spectral features in the input and template spectra .",
    "we note that continuum division is also used by @xcite for measuring the goodness - of - fit between supernova spectra .",
    "we see below (   [ sect : zt ] ) that the loss of color information has surprisingly little impact on the redshift and age determination .",
    "continuum removal also minimizes discontinuities at each end of the spectrum , which would cause artificial peaks in the correlation function .",
    "further discontinuities are removed by apodizing the spectra with a cosine bell ( @xmath67 at either end ) .",
    "the final step is the application of a bandpass filter . while it is actually applied at a later stage , directly to the correlation function , we show its effect on the input spectrum in fig .  [",
    "fig : lnlambda]_d_. the goal is to remove low - frequency residuals left over from the pseudo - continuum removal and high - frequency noise components .",
    "formally , the fourier transform of the normalized correlation function , @xmath57 ( eq .  [ eqn : c(k ) ] ) , is multiplied by a real bandpass function ( so that no phase shifts are introduced ) @xmath68 , such that    @xmath69 & \\textrm{for $ k_1 < k < k_2 $ } \\\\ 1 & \\textrm{for $ k_2 \\le k \\le",

    "supernova spectral lines have typical widths of @xmath43100150 , due to the large expansion velocities of the ejecta ( @xmath58 ) .",
    "the mean size of a logarithmic wavelength bin with @xmath71@xmath61@xmath62 is @xmath72 , so a typical sn line will have a width @xmath73 1421 logarithmic wavelength bins . in fourier space ,",
    "most of the information will be at wavenumbers @xmath74 812 . since sn spectra consist of overlapping spectral lines",
    "@xcite , a typical sn feature may have a lower width ( @xmath75 ) .",
    "this translates to @xmath76 , so most information is at wavenumbers less than 25 and almost everything above wavenumber @xmath77 is noise .",

    "in this section we introduce the correlation height - noise ratio @xmath81 (   [ sect : r ] ) and the spectrum overlap ( @xmath82 ) parameter (   [ sect : lap ] ) , the product of which ( the @xmath83 quality parameter ) conveys quantitative information about the reliability of a cross - correlation redshift output by .",

[",
    "eqn : tshift ] is supposed to give a correlation peak of height @xmath89 at the exact redshift ( corresponding to a shift @xmath34 in logarithmic wavelength units ) , while the second part can distort the peak .",
    "since @xmath90 is symmetric about @xmath91 , the antisymmetric part of @xmath32 about @xmath91 equals the antisymmetric part of @xmath87 about @xmath91 .",
    "we further assume that the symmetric part of @xmath87 has roughly the same amplitude as its antisymmetric part and that the symmetric and antisymmetric parts of @xmath87 are uncorrelated . in that case , the rms of @xmath87 is @xmath92 times the rms of its antisymmetric component .",

    "this way we can determine the time difference ( in the _ observer _ frame ) between maximum light , ( @xmath247 ) and the time the spectrum was obtained ( @xmath248 ) and compare this time interval with the _ rest - frame _ age ( @xmath249 ) determined through cross - correlation with local sn  ia templates . for this comparison to make sense we must correct the light - curve age for the @xmath7 time - dilation factor expected in an expanding universe @xcite .",

    "we base our investigation on a simple frequentist approach as opposed to a more elaborate bayesian one , but we discuss the future implementation of the latter in  in   [ sect : comparison ] .    in what follows we focus on five distinct examples , the first three being particularly relevant to ongoing high - redshift sn  ia searches : the distinction between 1991t - like sne  ia and other sne  ia (   [ sect:1anorm1a91 t ] ) ; the distinction between sne  ib / c and sne  ia at high redshifts (   [ sect:1cnorm1a ] ) ; the identification of peculiar sne  ia (   [ sect:1apec ] ) ; finally , the distinction between sne  ib and sne  ic and between sne  iib and both sne  ii and ib (   [ sect : otheregs ] ) , more relevant to ongoing nearby ( @xmath259 ) supernova searches .",
    "we used the same simulation setup as in   [ sect : simulation ] , except we consider correlations with all supernova types in the database .",
    "the reader must keep in mind that , while the age distribution of sn  ia templates is close to optimal in the current  database ( see   [ sect : ztcovar ] ) , those for supernovae of other types are most certainly not . while the results presented in this section are encouraging , they are no doubt biased by the relatively low number of sn  ib / ic / ii templates with respect to sne  ia .",
    "it can be challenging to distinguish the subtypes of sne  ia from one another .",
    "1991t - like sne  ia have a peak luminosity at the bright end of the sn  ia distribution and although their light curves still obey the width - peak luminosity , or `` phillips , '' relation @xcite , it is useful to have an independent confirmation of their high intrinsic luminosity from their spectra . spectra of 1991t - like sne  ia are characterized by the near - absence of  and  lines in the early - time spectra , and prominent high - excitation features of  not found in normal sne  ia .",
    "the , and  features develop during the post - maximum ages and by @xmath260 weeks past maximum the spectra of `` 1991t - like '' objects are similar to those of normal sne  ia @xcite .    in the top panels of figure  [ fig : ia91 t ]",
    "we illustrate the ability of  to identify 1991t - like sne  ia at @xmath232 .",
    "the input spectrum is a `` ia-91 t '' template in the  database ( table  [ table : sndb ] ) in the age interval @xmath261 , i.e. when the spectroscopic differences with normal sne  ia are most apparent .",

    "the negative noise spikes around @xmath266 are statistical noise due to the small number of templates with @xmath83 values in excess of that cutoff .",

    "the differences between 1991t - like and normal sne  ia are less apparent ( see the rightmost panel ) and the impact on the ability of  to distinguish between the different ia subtypes is readily apparent . in the absence of constraints on redshift or age , the fraction of ia-91 t templates reaches a peak of @xmath268% , while it increases to 100% with constraints on redshift and age .",
    "the variation for @xmath269 is again statistical noise due to the limited number of templates with such good correlations .",
    "the difficulty of distinguishing between normal and 1991t - like sne  ia at high redshift could partly explain the apparent lack of 1991t - like sne  ia at high redshifts ( @xmath270% in the sn  ia sample published by @xcite ) with respect to the fraction expected locally ( up to @xmath271% according to @xcite ) .",

    "a particular concern is the contamination of high - z sn  ia samples with sne  ib / c . at redshifts",
    "@xmath272 , the defining @xmath273 absorption feature of sne  ia ( also present , although somewhat weaker , in sne  ic ) is redshifted out of the range of most optical spectrographs and one has to rely on spectral features blueward of this to determine the supernova type . some of these features , such as the  h and k @xmath274 doublet , are common to both sne  ia and sne  ib / c .",
    "other features characteristic of sn  ia spectra around maximum light ( e.g.  @xmath275 ) are generally weak and can be difficult to detect in low - s / n spectra .",
    "one has to invoke external constraints , such as the sn color evolution , light - curve shape , host galaxy morphology ( only sne  ia occur in early - type hosts ; @xcite ) , or the expected apparent peak magnitude : sne  ib / c at maximum light are often @xmath276  mag fainter than sne  ia ( @xcite ; although @xcite have reported on one sn  ic with an absolute magnitude similar to normal sne  ia ) and hence are only expected to `` pollute '' magnitude - limited samples of sne  ia at the lower - redshift end . if the redshift is not known , sne  ib / c can be a serious contaminant for high - redshift sn  ia searches .    in the top panels of figure  [ fig : icnorm ] we illustrate the ability for  to identify sne",

    "a constraint on age only reduced the cross - over @xmath83 between sne  ia and sne  ib / c from @xmath280 to @xmath281 but leads to less correlations with @xmath177 ( hence the noise spikes in the recovered template fractions ) .",
    "a combined constraint on redshift and age yields a 100%  sn  ib / c fraction for @xmath282 , but no correlations with @xmath283 .    at @xmath232 ,",
    "the results are essentially unchanged from @xmath231 , although the absolute number of good correlations ( @xmath177 ) is generally less .",

    "some sne  ia , which we refer to as peculiar , do not belong to any of the normal , 1991t - like , or 1991bg - like categories .",

    "snls-03d3bb ( sn  2003fg ) at @xmath286 @xcite , on the other hand , illustrates the limitations of the cross - correlation approach in determining the sn type , when applied to objects that are not part of the library of spectral templates .",
    "its spectrum ( at + 2 days ; a.  howell , private communication ) is unique among supernova spectra and we have no similar examples in our database . in the absence of constraints , the best - match template is the 1991t - like sn  1999dq @xcite at @xmath293 days ( @xmath294 ) . with constraints on age or redshift ,",

    "we next focus on two further specific examples , relevant to the spectroscopic classification of supernovae in nearby ( @xmath297 ) sn searches : the distinction between sn  ib and ic , and that between sn  iib and ii / ib .",
    "sn  ib and ic are often difficult to tell apart and are sometimes referred to as `` sne  ib / c '' in the literature ( e.g. , sn  1999ex ; @xcite ) and iau circulars .",
    "this difficulty is inherent to the sn classification scheme , rather than from a physical mis - conception of these events , both of which are believed to originate in the core collapse of a massive star , stripped of its outer layers through either stellar winds or interaction with a binary companion @xcite .",

    "[ fig : ib ] , we show the result of cross - correlating sn  ib spectra at low redshift ( @xmath233 ) within 10 days from @xmath298-band maximum with sne of all types in the  database : type ib ( excluding type iib ; _ solid line _ ) , type ic ( _ dashed line _ ) , and other sn types ( _ dotted line _ ) .",

    "some supernovae `` evolve '' from one type to another as they age .",

    "the previous examples illustrate the ability of  to recover a significant fraction of supernovae in the database corresponding to the input sn type .",
    "while figs .  [ fig : ia91t][fig : iib ] are informative , they do not provide a unique answer to the following : how does one use  to determine the type of an sn spectrum and can one relate the @xmath83 quality parameter to a formal confidence that an input spectrum is of a certain type ( and , sometimes more importantly , that it is not of another type ) ?",
    "the answer is far from settled , and its resolution will probably involve a more sophisticated bayesian approach ( see next section ) .",
    "nevertheless , we have tested the following classification schemes :    * the sn type ( subtype ) is simply determined as the type ( subtype ) of the best - match template(s ) for @xmath83 greater than some cutoff value @xmath305 . * the sn type ( subtype ) is the one corresponding to the highest fraction of templates corresponding to a given type ( subtype ) for @xmath306 , with the possible additional requirement that this fraction exceeds some cutoff . *",
    "the sn type ( subtype ) is the one whose fraction increases most with increasing @xmath83 ( i.e. the lines shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : ia91t][fig : iib ] that have the highest positive gradient for @xmath306 ) , with the possible additional requirement that this gradient exceeds some cutoff .",
    "the first of these is the one commonly used for the identification of supernovae , at both low and high redshift . in iau circulars ,",

    "[ fig : ia91 t ] ) and the large spectral database used in  offers the possibility to use the statistical power of correlations exceeding a certain @xmath83 cutoff . this second classification scheme has already been used for the classification of high-@xmath8 sn  ia spectra using  @xcite .",
    "a drawback of such an approach is that the determination of the sn type depends on the completeness of the sn database which comprises few template spectra of core - collapse sne ( ib , ic , and ii ; see   [ sect : sniddb ] ) .",
    "thus , for instance , it is not possible to identify peculiar sne  ia this way ( fig .",
    "[ fig : iapec ] ) .",
    "last , the `` gradient method '' for classification is generally more robust , but also requires some other constraint on either the template fraction or the type of the best - match template(s ) .",
    "we are extensively testing these different combinations , to optimize the type determination for all sn types , at varying @xmath8 , @xmath308 , and s / n , although we suspect that a more elaborate bayesian treatment will be required to properly account for the probability of an input spectrum to be of a certain type ( as well as _ not _ being of some other type ) .",
    "several other methods are used to determine the type , redshift , or age of a supernova spectrum .",
    "we briefly describe them here , with a distinction between cross - correlation and `` @xmath45-based '' methods .",
    "last , we comment on the alternative bayesian approach to supernova classification only applied so far to photometric measurements and its possible implementation in .",
    "other spectral classification methods involve principle component analysis ( pca ) , possibly in combination with artificial neural networks .",
    "these are beyond the scope of this paper and we do not discuss them here , although the pca method has already been applied to sn  ia classification by @xcite .",
    "we are aware of two other algorithms based on the cross - correlation techniques of @xcite .",
    "both are aimed at determining redshifts of galaxies ( or stars ) in large surveys , but could easily be tuned ( e.g. , by modifying the shape of the bandpass filter and including age information ) to supernovae as in .",
    "xcsao @xcite is a program part of the iraf rvsao package , aimed at obtaining redshifts and radial velocities from digital spectra .",
    "it has been used extensively in the past for redshift surveys ( for references see @xcite ) and is currently used in the smithsonian hectospec lensing survey ( shels ; @xcite ) .",
    "the basic algorithm is the same as that described in ",
    "[ sect : xcorform ] , although some important differences exist .",
    "first , the overlap in wavelength between the input and template spectra at the correlation redshift ( the @xmath82 parameter discussed in   [ sect : lap ] ) is not taken into account explicitely ; rather it is maximized by including spectral templates at different redshifts .",
    "second , xcsao directly selects the best peak in the correlation function , rather than looking at the 10 best peaks individually .",
    "last , the reported correlation redshift is that associated with the best - match template ( i.e. , the one with the highest correlation height - noise ratio , @xmath81 ) , rather than being the median of all redshifts above a certain cutoff @xmath309",
    ". it may be that not including the @xmath82 parameter is less important for galaxy redshift determination , due to the narrower widths of spectral lines in galaxy spectra and the iterative scheme implemented in xcsao ensures that an optimal correlation redshift is computed ( d.  mink 2007 , private communication ) . for supernova spectra ,",
    "however , the inclusion of the @xmath82 parameter is fundamental to obtain reliable redshifts ( see   [ sect : zreserr ] ) .",
    "the other two differences are of a less fundamental nature .",
    "another algorithm based on the correlation techniques of @xcite is runz @xcite , a program used by members of the 2df galaxy redshift survey @xcite and the 6df galaxy survey @xcite .",
    "an essential difference with  is the scaling of the input spectrum by its inverse - variance ( see   [ sect : xcorz ] ) , which leads to improved cross - correlation redshifts for galaxy spectra . as mentioned earlier in ",
    "[ sect : xcorz ] , no such improvement is found for supernova redshifts , since the power spectrum of a typical variance spectrum ( for ground - based observations ) peaks at higher wavenumbers than for sn spectra .",
    "one advantage of runz over  is the implementation of gaussian constraints on redshift , a feature that will be part of a future version of .",
    "an alternative to cross - correlation techniques involves the minimization of a @xmath45-like quantity at discrete redshift intervals , to find the best match between an input and template spectrum .",
    "such techniques do not enable a formal evaluation of the redshift error as in  ( see   [ sect : zerr ] ) .",
    "an elaborate implementation of this approach is `` superfit '' @xcite , in which an input spectrum is compared to a combination of a ( possibly reddened ) template supernova spectrum and a template galaxy spectrum at a given redshift .",
    "a similar program to superfit is @xmath310-fit ( @xcite ; see also discussion in @xcite ) .",
    "the number of free parameters means that the execution time is 23 orders of magnitude greater than for . for this reason we could not test superfit in the same way we conducted the simulations presented in the previous sections .",
    "the advantage of this technique lies in the evaluation of the fraction of galaxy light in the input spectrum and its subsequent subtraction to obtain a `` pure '' supernova spectrum .",
    "consequently , supernovae can be classified even when the galaxy contamination fraction is high ( @xmath238 ; @xcite ) .",
    "given the impact of galaxy contamination on correlation redshifts ( fig .",
    "[ fig : zvar_gf ] ) , we expect more accurate redshifts when this contamination is removed from the input spectrum . however , the typical errors on redshift are similar to those in   @xcite .",
    "this suggests that the redshift accuracy is limited by physical properties of supernovae ( namely , the velocity location of their prominent spectral features ) rather than by differences in algorithm .",
    "the accuracy on the age determination is similar to that in , with a @xmath197-day dispersion about the one - to - one correspondence with the light - curve age @xcite .",
    "we note that the current version of superfit has not been extensively tested for redshift and age determination and has not been tested at all for type determination ( a.  howell 2006 , private communication ) .",
    "a variant of the @xmath45 approach implemented in superfit is the spectral feature aging ( sfa ) algorithm of @xcite , used to determine the age of a normal sn  ia of known redshift . in sfa",
    ", the input spectrum is divided up into several wavelength intervals ( typically eight ) and each of these spectral regions is compared with corresponding ones in a database of template spectra .",
    "the age accuracy is similar to that in but is largely sensitive to the wavelength intervals of the spectral regions used to divide up the input spectrum @xcite .",
    "another tool , based on the sfa algorithm , plans to extend the age determination to spectra of all types @xcite .",
    "recently , several authors have presented bayesian methods to determine the type of a supernova based on a single - epoch photometric measurement ( potentially in multiple bands ; @xcite ) , or on multiband light curves @xcite .",
    "the motivation behind these purely photometry - based approaches is the planned next - generation of wide - field all - sky surveys ( such as pan - starrs and lsst ) , for which many sn  ia candidates will be too faint for spectroscopy .",
    "however , these techniques are in principle applicable to ongoing high - redshift sn  ia surveys , which are limited by the amount of available spectroscopy time @xcite .",
    "in fact , @xcite already adopt a bayesian approach in fitting high-@xmath8 sn  ia light curves with batm ( bayesian adapted template match ; @xcite ) .",
    "these bayesian - based approaches assign a probability for a supernova to be of a certain type , based on a set of measurements ( e.g. , light curve points in a given photometric band ) and given a model or template , that depends on a set of parameters .",
    "as pointed out by @xcite , when computing this probability it is generally assumed that the input is indeed a supernova of a known type , although in principle one could extend the formalism to incorporate all known astrophysical objects . moreover , such methods invoke `` marginalization over type , '' which poses some conceptual problems , since it assumes the sn classification scheme to be both complete ( i.e. to include all possible sn types ) and hermetic . yet",
    ", there appears to be a continuum of properties relating different sn types ( e.g. , type ib and ic ) , some supernovae evolve from one type to another ( e.g. , type iib ) and others still seem to defy classification ( such as the `` peculiar sne  ia '' sn  2002cx or sn  2005hk )",
    ".    the current version of  does not incorporate such a methodology in its supernova classification .",
    "nevertheless , the change in the relative fraction of templates of a given type as a function of the @xmath83 quality parameter could be folded in as an extra constraint on the sn type in a bayesian framework .",
    "we have presented an algorithm , based on the correlation techniques of @xcite , that can be used to determine the redshift and age of a supernova spectrum and place constraints on its type .",
    "we develop a diagnostic , the @xmath83 quality parameter , to quantify the reliability of a given correlation between the input and a template spectrum .",
    "this parameter is simply the product of the @xcite correlation height - noise ratio ( @xmath81 ) and the overlap in rest - frame @xmath64 space between the input and template spectrum at the correlation redshift ( @xmath82 ) .",
    "this @xmath83 diagnostic has the advantage of enabling the formal computation of the redshift error , proportional to @xmath311 .",
    "we show , based on simulations , that for @xmath312 , the typical error on redshift and age is @xmath313 and @xmath1 days , respectively . the former accuracy on redshift is confirmed through a comparison of correlation redshifts with host - galaxy redshifts ( determined from narrow lines in the spectrum ) out to redshifts @xmath314 .",
    "the latter accuracy on age is confirmed through a comparison of ( rest frame ) spectral ages using  and ( observer frame ) light curve ages corrected for the @xmath7 time - dilation factor expected in an expanding universe .",
    "the fact that both age estimates agree so well is itself a verification of the cosmological nature of redshifts , previously tested with multiepoch sn  ia spectra @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the success of  in determining the redshift and age of the high - redshift sn  ia spectra in our sample shows that these are similar to low - redshift counterparts .",
    "we present first results of an impartial and effective spectroscopic classification of supernovae , based on the fraction of correlations exceeding a certain @xmath83 cutoff .",
    "we illustrate this through various examples , three of which are relevant to ongoing sn  ia searches at high redshift : we are able to distinguish 1991t - like sne  ia from other sne  ia at @xmath232 ; we identify sne  ib / c as such at both @xmath231 and @xmath232 .",
    "the identification of peculiar sne  ia , on the other hand , proves easier at @xmath232 than @xmath231 , although this result remains to be verified with more peculiar sn  ia spectral templates . in all cases we assume the galaxy contamination fraction , to which  is _ not _ sensitive , to be negligible .",
    "these examples both illustrate the success and limitations of such an automated classification scheme and highlight the complementarity between spectroscopic and photometric observations in determining the supernova type .",
    "we are currently testing various combinations of other classification schemes to improve the classification of all sn types using .",
    "supernova discoveries will continue to increase dramatically with the advent of wide - field imaging telescopes optimized for the detection of transient events , such as pan - starrs and lsst .",
    "these experiments are expected to find tens to hundreds of thousands of new supernovae each year , few of which will have spectroscopic confirmation . thus , most identifications will have to rely solely on photometric properties , a difficult task in view of the present difficulty of distinguishing between sn types ( and subtypes ) with spectra .",
    "it is likely that those experiments will have to rely on a simpler classification scheme , focusing on the main sn types ( type ia , ib / c , & ii ) with little or no distinction between the associated subtypes .",
    "future planned space - based high - redshift sn  ia surveys within the nasa / doe joint dark energy mission ( adept , destiny , snap ) will incorporate a spectrograph and could benefit from a tool such as .",
    "a secure identification of sne  ia in such experiments will require sufficient rest frame wavelength coverage beyond @xmath315 , as the distinction between sne  ia and ic ( and between sn  ia subtypes , including peculiar events ) is otherwise problematic ( figs .",
    "[ fig : ia91t][fig : iapec ] ) .    the current version of  will be made available to the community and we will set up a web - based interface for instantaneous supernova typing ( including redshift and age determination ) .",
    "future versions of  will include a wavelength- and age - weighted spectrum overlap parameter , @xmath290 , an explicit treatment of the covariance between redshift and age and a bayesian approach to type determination , as currently used for photometric classification of supernovae @xcite .",
    "moreover , more spectral templates are continuously being included in the  database through the cfa supernova program ( more than 3000 spectra of over 700 supernovae since 1997 ) , which directly impact the ability of  to securely identify input spectra .",
    "this further enables comparative studies of sn spectra and quantitative evaluation of synthetic spectral fits to observations .",
