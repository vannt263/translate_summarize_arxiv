    "the paper is devoted to the asymptotic study of the flow in the hele - shaw cell with presence of moving obstacle in the flow .",
    "the hele - shaw problem ( @xcite ) deals with the description of the free boundary encircling the domain occupied by incompressible fluid in the so called hele - shaw cell ( see , e.g. @xcite , @xcite ) , i.e. in a narrow space between two parallel plates .",
    "different driving mechanisms can be considered for the fluid flow , e.g. presence of a source / sink in the fluid domain .",
    "various physical assumptions lead to different formulations of the respective boundary value problems .",
    "a comprehensive discussion on this topic can be found in the recent book by gustafsson and vasilev @xcite .",
    "there exist two basic mathematical models for the flow in the hele - shaw cell .",
    "the _ complex - analytic model _ is formulated as a nonlinear mixed boundary value problem with respect to a family of conformal mappings of the canonical domain onto the domain occupied by the fluid .",
    "this approach goes back to the work by polubarinova - kochina @xcite and galin @xcite .",
    "the proof of the existence ( locally in time ) and uniqueness of analytic solutions to this model was done by kufarev @xmath1 vinogradov @xcite ( rediscovered later by richardson @xcite ) on the basis of the method of successive approximations .",
    "simplified proof of existence and uniqueness of an analytic solution was given by reissig @xmath1 von wolfersdorf @xcite ( see also @xcite , @xcite ) . in this work",
    "the model was interpreted as a special case of an abstract cauchy - kovalevsky problem , which was solved by a variant of the cauchy - kovalevsky theorem ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "see also @xcite and references therein for the survey of recent results on the complex - analytic hele - shaw problem in doubly connected domains .",
    "let us note that there are some similarities between movement of the rigid body and movement of bubbles in the flow ( for the discussion of the latter process we refer , e.g. , to the article @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "in our study we use the _ real - variable model _ proposed by gustafsson @xcite the flow is described by a family of parametrizations of the boundary of fluid domain ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "this model was generalized to multi - dimensional case by begehr @xmath1 gilbert @xcite . among variants of the proof of existence and uniqueness for this model we have to point out the papers by reissig @xcite and by escher @xmath1 simonett @xcite . in the most general form ,",
    "the proof of the existence , uniqueness of the classical solution and the regularity of the fluid boundary was given by antontsev , gonalves and meirmanov @xcite , @xcite .",
    "_ variational _ formulation of the hele - shaw model was proposed by gustafsson @xcite , who proved the weak solvability of the problem ( see also @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the classical ( real - variable ) hele - shaw model can be reinterpreted as a mixed boundary value problem for laplace equation with respect to unknown parametrization of the boundary and corresponding green s function of this problem in the reference domain .",
    "when assuming the presence of a moving obstacle in the flow , we have to add an additional equation describing this movement .",
    "the aim of our work is to perform an asymptotic analysis for such a variant of the model and to construct an efficient and robust numerical routine to tackle the problem .",
    "application of asymptotic methods to approximation of green s function goes back to the classical paper by j.  hadamard @xcite , where the method of regular perturbation was performed .",
    "recently , v.  mazya and a.  movchan obtained a number of asymptotic formulas for green s function related to different boundary value problems for a number of differential operators in the case of singular perturbations of the domains ( see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "those results were used in @xcite to model the hele - shaw flow with a fixed circular obstacle . to construct the computational scheme , we choose green s formula with the neumann condition on the external boundary of doubly connected domain , and with dirichlet condition on its internal boundary .",
    "then a preliminary transformation @xmath2 was made , which led to creation of a system of differential equations for the original problem approximation .",
    "the existence of the reformulated hele - shaw problem follows immediately from the results of the paper escher - simonett ( 1997b ) .",
    "the approximate system defined in this way was reduced to the system of first order odes , and tackled by a proposed numerical scheme .",
    "this approach proved its ability to solve the analyzed hele - shaw problem , providing sufficiently good accuracy of computations .",
    "however , the scheme itself exhibited some disadvantages :    \\1 ) in the case of sink the life - time of the approximate process was very short ;    \\2 ) in the case of source we get numerical result only on a bounded interval of time .",
    "the first difficulty could have been expected from the theory of the hele - shaw problem , but the second one is a consequence of the numerical scheme instability . in the case of moving obstacle",
    "this led to even worse results .",
    "in this paper we consider the hele - shaw flow with a rigid inclusion moving in the direction of the flow without rotation .",
    "the friction between the limiting planes and the obstacle is accounted for . to avoid problems",
    "appeared in the case of the fixed obstacle , we use here the same mazya - movchan approach , but with different uniform asymptotic formula for green s function ( without making any preliminary transformations , and thus interchanging the role of boundary conditions ) .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "2 describes the problem s geometry and presents the ( real - variable ) hele - shaw model in a domain with a moving obstacle .",
    "the model is further reduced to the form containing an unknown parametrization of the boundary of the fluid domain , an unknown green s function of the corresponding mixed boundary value problem for the laplace operator and unknown trajectory of the inclusion .",
    "therefore we have to consider a system of equations consisting of the equation for the free boundary ( the standard hele - shaw equation ) and the equation of motion for the obstacle . in sec .",
    "3 we present uniform asymptotic formula by mazya - movchan and describe its components . in sec .",
    "4 we determine the values of the components of the mazya - movchan formula corresponding to the considered model .",
    "the final form of the approximate system of differential equations is presented in subsec .",
    "4.4 . finally , in sec .",
    "5 the aforementioned system is implemented in a numerical scheme which illustrates the obtained results . the numerical scheme to obtain the solution employs reduction of the system of governing equations to the system of odes of the first order , where the velocity of the inclusion is introduced as an additional dependent variable .",
    "in order to solve the dynamic system we utilize the standard ode solver of matlab package : ode45 .",
    "respective conformal mappings of the boundary curve are performed by means of the schwartz - christoffel toolbox .",
    "the derivatives of the mapping along the free boundary are computed by our own subroutines , based on the spline approximation .",

    "the relative deviations of the radius vector from respective reference ( benchmark ) values are shown in fig .",
    "[ ro_dev_track ] .",
    "naturally , the variant with the sink gives more pronounced deformation of the final shape , as the distance between the inclusion and the boundary is much smaller than in the opposite case .",

    "the traces of inclusion for both considered cases are shown by markers in fig .",
    "[ mov_incl_track ] .",
    "it should be emphasized that the imposed initial conditions do not imply kinematic equivalence between both variants of the problem .",
    "it is a consequence of different initial accelerations resulting from equations - . as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ a_t ] , fig .",
    "[ a_t_abs ] , although the magnitudes of initial accelerations are very close to each other , their vectors directions are almost opposite .    the curvatures of the tracks ( bend directions ) and the signs of respective components of acceleration are determined by the source / sink activity . in the case of domain expansion the fluid flow direction magnifies the velocity of obstacle .",
    "thus the distance covered is greater than that for fluid sink . obviously , for other configurations of the initial velocity vector one can expect different trends .",
