    "jets of active galactic nuclei ( agn ) are among the most fascinating objects in the universe . from the time when the term  jet \" was first introduced by @xcite until today",
    "it is still unclear how these jets are created and formed .",
    "a prime source to gain insight into the physics of extragalactic jets is the broad - line radio galaxy 3c111 ( pks b0415 + 379 ) at @xmath9 = 0.049 and @xmath10 @xmath11 ; @xmath12 ) ] .",
    "the object can be described with a classical fr ii morphology ( @xcite ) exhibiting two radio lobes with hot spots and a single - sided jet ( @xcite ) .",
    "untypical for radio galaxies , a small inclination angle of only @xmath13 to our line of sight has been determined on parsec scales ( @xcite ) .",
    "moreover , 3c111 has a blazar - like spectral energy distribution ( sed ) ( @xcite ) and shows one of the brightest radio cores in the mm - cm wavelength regime of all frii radio galaxies .",
    "superluminal motion was detected in this radio galaxy by and @xcite making this source one of the first radio galaxies to exhibit this effect .",

    "a major flux - density outburst in 1997 was investigated by @xcite with 10 years of radio monitoring data ( 19952005 ) .",
    "in addition @xcite and @xcite report on a possible connection between the accretion disk and the jet of 3c111 .",
    "+ in this paper a new major flux density outburst from 2007 and the associated jet kinematics will be discussed with data from the very large baseline array ( vlba ) , the university of michigan radio astronomy observatory ( umrao ) and the f - gamma program .",
    "the broad - line radio galaxy 3c111 has been part of the vlba 2 cm survey program since its start in 1995 ( @xcite ) and its successor mojave ( monitoring of jets in active galactic nuclei with vlba experiments , @xcite ) in 2002 .",
    "twenty - four epochs of data have been taken from 2006 to 2010 within the mojave program of this source .",
    "phase and amplitude self - calibration as well as hybrid mapping by deconvolution techniques were performed as described by @xcite . utilizing the program difmap ( @xcite ) ,",
    "two - dimensional gaussian components have been fitted in the ( _ u , v_)-plane to the fully calibrated data of each epoch .",
    "we refer to the inner @xmath15mas as the `` core '' region , which can usually be modeled with two gaussian components .",
    "all models have been aligned by assuming the westernmost components to be stationary and all component positions are measured with respect to it .",
    "conservative errors of 15% are assumed for the flux densities of the model - fit components accounting for absolute calibration uncertainties and formal model - fitting uncertainties ( @xcite ) . within the umrao radio - flux - density monitoring program ( @xcite ) ,",
    "more than three decades of single - dish flux - density data have been collected for 3c111 at 4.8ghz , 8.0ghz , and 14.5ghz . in addition , 3c111 is observed monthly by the f - gamma program ( @xcite , @xcite ) at multiple frequencies throughout the cm- and mm - bands since 2007 .",
    "figure [ lc_umrao ] ( left ) shows the long - term radio lightcurve of 3c111 at 4.8ghz . since the start of the measurements",
    "the source has been in a low activity state for almost two decades with only minor activity .",
    "the source showed a major outburst in 1996/1997 ( @xcite ) . starting in 2004 , minor outbursts",
    "are observed and the flux density level increases .",
    "a major flux density outburst starts in early 2007 at high frequencies ( see figure [ lc_umrao ] , right ) , peaking @xmath16 and is subsequently seen at lower frequencies .",
    "a secondary outburst starts mid 2008 at high frequencies .",
    "the overall flux density level at 4.8ghz has been decreasing since the major outburst .      in this work ,",
    "we focus on the time period 2006 through 2010 , which contains 24 mojave epochs with an average image rms noise of 0.2mjy@xmath17 and a maximum of 0.4mjy@xmath17 .",
    "the restoring beams of different epochs are very similar with an average of ( 0.84 @xmath18 0.58 ) mas at p.a .",
    "a peak flux density of 6.54jy was measured in may 2008 .",
    "figure [ evolution_3c111 ] shows the evolution of the parsec scale jet of 3c111 observed within the mojave vlba program at 15ghz since may 2008 ( excluding six epochs before the ejection of the primary component ) . a major bright feature appears in may 2008 and is travelling downstream .",
    "the source brightness distribution was modelled with the clean algorithm by within difmap .      in figure [ distvsmjd ] , the radial distances to the stationary component in the core region",
    "are plotted for every component as a function of time .",
    "the identification throughout the epochs is based on the comparison of the positions and flux densities of these model components .",
    "this identification is preliminary and will be discussed in more detail in a forthcoming paper . in the context of this paper we focus on the components which can be associated with the major flux density outburst of 2007 ( see fig .",
    "[ lc_umrao ] ) .",
    "+ a linear regression fit has been performed to measure component speeds and ejection dates ( see figure [ distvsmjd ] ) .",
    "the ejection dates of a primary component and a secondary component are quasi identical ( @xmath16 ) within the errors and were found to coincide with the peak of the outburst at high frequencies ( see figure [ lc_umrao ] , right ) .",
    "the components flux density evolution ( see figure [ core_x10x11_fluxvsmjd ] ) shows that the core region was extremely bright during the time of the outburst but dropped significantly after ejecting the bright primary and secondary component .",
    "the determined apparent speed for the primary component is @xmath20 and for the secondary component @xmath21 .",
    "+ the primary component remains at a constant flux density of @xmath22 until mid 2009 .",
    "after that , the component is splitting into multiple parts : a new leading component with trailing components in its wake .",
    "+ the secondary component has a higher flux density than the primary in the beginning of its lifetime which rapidly decays .",
    "this decay suggests that this component disappeared in mid 2009 though an identification with the first trailing component is possible based on position alone .",
    "the calculated apparent speed of the new leading component after mid 2009 is @xmath23 with the flux density decreasing .",
    "the first trailing component has an apparent speed of @xmath24 and shows a constant flux density evolution .",
    "the second trailing component was first observed 2010.53 with a flux density of @xmath25 and could be modeled until 2010.91 with a flux density of less than 100mjy .",
    "the flux density evolution of the second trailing component suggests that this component faded away and thus could not be modeled in epoch 2010.98 .",
    "an association of this second trailing component with the 2008 component is possible based on the flux density evolution and position but needs further investigation of the 2008-outburst . + a similiar behaviour with a leading , secondary and trailing",
    "components has been seen in the evolution of the components associated with the outburst from 1997 by @xcite .",
    "the components were interpreted as a forward and backward shock with the backward shock fading very fast . in this model ,",
    "the plasma of the forward shock entered a region of rapidly decreasing external pressure allowing it to expand into the jet ambient medium and accelerate . in the following ,",
    "the plasma recollimated and trailing features were formed in the wake of the leading component ( ) . +          with the addition of the `` core '' region , presented by stars .",

    "in this paper , the ejection of new jet components on parsec scales were associated with a major flux density outburst of 3c111 in 2007 .",
    "it was shown that the major flux density outburst can be associated with the ejection of a primary jet component and secondary component .",
    "the evolution of the leading component suggests a split into multiple components .",
