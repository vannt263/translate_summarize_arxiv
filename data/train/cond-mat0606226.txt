    "in 1962 , brian josephson predicted the josephson effect @xcite by considering the quantum effect of two superconductors separated by a thin insulator .",
    "the josephson effect is a natural quantum phenomenon for two coherently superposed macroscopic quantum objects .",
    "the subsequent experiments verified the josephson effect and also lent support to the bcs theory about the physical mechanism of superconductors .",
    "the josephson effect has been used in the invention of novel devices for extremely high - sensitivity measurements of currents , voltages , and magnetic fields . up to date",
    ", there are still considerable interests in the fundamental physics and applications of this effect . similarly to the case of superconductors , the ideal josephson effect was also observed by investigating the flow of superfluid @xmath0 through an array of micro - apertures @xcite .",
    "recent experiments @xcite also observed clear josephson current and especially self - trapping phenomenon @xcite for bose condensates in dilute gases .",
    "about twenty years ago , p. w. anderson raised a famous question anderson that when two initially separated superfluids are connected , whether the two superfluids would show a relative phase and therefore josephson current . in the ordinary physical picture of josephson effect",
    ", the initial quantum state is regarded as a coherent superposition of two macroscopic phase coherent quantum objects . in anderson s question ,",
    "however , before connecting two superfluids , the two superfluids are completely independent . to answer anderson s question",
    ", we shall consider the problem that during the connection process or with the development of time after the connection process , whether the quantum state of the whole system will become a coherent superposition of two macroscopic quantum superfluids .",
    "after the experimental realization of bose - einstein condensate in dilute gases @xcite , there are a lot of interesting studies about the splitting of a condensate and merging of two independent condensates , which relate closely to the above anderson s question . the former question about the formation of a fragmented condensate during the splitting process of a condensate has been studied intensively @xcite .",
    "the quantum merging of two independent condensates ( i.e. , the inverse process of the splitting ) was also investigated recently by considering carefully the role of dissipation @xcite , and by considering both the adiabatic and nonadiabatic merging @xcite based on the well - known two mode approximation @xcite .",
    "most recently , the splitting and the following merging of an elongated condensate @xcite is considered by including the finite - temperature effect . on the experimental side ,",
    "a continuous condensate source was created by periodically replenishing a condensate with new condensates @xcite .",
    "this striking experiment also gives strong motivation to study theoretically the merging of independent condensates .",
    "to describe the essential quantum feature of a bose superfluid , penrose and onsager @xcite proposed the idea of off - diagonal long - range order ( odlro ) which gives the general criterion of a bose superfluid .",
    "the odlro plays a very important role in the description of the bose superfluid , especially because it has no classical analog @xcite . for a single superfluid , if the one - particle density matrix @xmath1 can be factorized , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath2 , there is an odlro for the superfluid , and the superfluid can be regarded as a macroscopic quantum object which has stable spatial coherence property @xcite . for two initially independent superfluids , here we investigate theoretically the dynamic process of the whole system when the barrier separating two superfluids is decreased adiabatically so that the two initially separated and independent superfluids are weakly connected .",
    "based on the calculations of the one - particle density matrix of the whole system , it is found that there is an interaction - induced quantum merging process for initially independent superfluids .",
    "after two initially independent superfluids merge into a single condensate , it is shown that @xmath3 with @xmath4 being an effective order parameter of the whole system .",
    "the effective order parameter has the property that it is a coherent superposition of two macroscopic wave functions . for weakly interacting bose superfluids ,",
    "we find that the evolution of @xmath4 can be described very well by the ordinary gross - pitaevskii ( gp ) equation @xcite , and thus there is also josephson current when two initially independent superfluids are weakly connected .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we introduce the effective order parameter of the whole system when the one - particle density matrix is calculated for the general situation . in section iii",
    "we give the expression of the overall energy and the evolution equations based on the action principle . a brief summary and discussion",
    "is given in section iv .",
    "for two independent bose superfluids at zero temperature shown in fig . 1a , the number of particles @xmath5 and @xmath6 in each of the two superfluids are fixed , and the corresponding quantum state is @xmath7where @xmath8 is a normalization constant to assure @xmath9 .",

    "the quantum depletion is omitted .",
    "thus , this initial quantum state is valid when @xmath14 with @xmath15 and @xmath16 being respectively the scattering length and mean distance between particles .",
    "one should note that for two initially coherently - separated superfluids , the state is @xmath17 with @xmath18 being a creation operator which creates a particle with the single - particle state @xmath19 with @xmath20 . as shown in fig .",
    "1b , we consider the dynamic evolution process of the whole system when two initially independent superfluids are weakly connected__. _",
    "_        as shown in the following , after two independent bose superfluids are connected , @xmath12 and @xmath13 will overlap and especially become non - orthogonal in the presence of interparticle interaction .",
    "thus , we consider the general case for @xmath21 from the beginning . we first give the general expression of the one - particle density matrix @xmath22 for this general case .",
    "generally speaking , @xmath23 .",
    "however , after straightforward calculations , it is shown clearly that the nonzero value of @xmath24 can play important role in the one - particle density matrix for @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",

    "we see that @xmath27 and @xmath35 are not commutative any more for @xmath36 being a nonzero value .",
    "it is well - known that the field operator should be expanded in terms of a complete and orthogonal basis set . generally speaking",

    "the above one - particle density matrix is obtained based on the second quantization method .",

    "the first term is the external potential due to a magnetic trap or an optical trap , while the second term is the central barrier due to a laser beam separating two condensates .",
    "when the central barrier separating two condensates is sufficiently high so that there is no tunneling current , one may prepare two completely independent ( rather than coherently separated ) condensates by directly cooling the dilute gases in the double - well trap . in the last ten years ,",

    "first we get the ground state wave functions @xmath168 and @xmath13 at the initial time .",
    "then , by numerically calculating the coupled equations ( [ evo - equation ] ) , we obtain the evolution of @xmath169 based on the numerical results of @xmath168 and @xmath13 . from @xmath169 ,",
    "we give the evolution of @xmath100 in fig.4 .",
    "we have also confirmed in the numerical calculations that , for @xmath170 , the numerical result of @xmath171 can be regarded as zero because it is smaller than @xmath172 .",
    "this shows clearly that the nonzero value of @xmath173 physically arises from the interatomic interaction , rather than the error in the numerical calculations .",
    "in fact , if we assume that @xmath169 is always zero with the development of time , it is easy to show that this is an inconsistent assumption because with this assumption we prove both in the numerical calculations and analytic analysis that @xmath171 will increase from zero after the overlapping between two condensates . in the inset of fig.4 , we give the numerical result of @xmath174 which shows clearly the josephson effect .",
    "our numerical results show that @xmath175 is always equal to @xmath95 with an error below @xmath176 which confirms further our numerical calculations .     and the josephson effect .",
    "the evolution of @xmath177 shows clearly the josephson effect . due to the particle current between two initially independent condensates , as shown in the inset , @xmath178 decreases significantly with the development of time . at @xmath179 , @xmath180 , thus two initially independent condensates",
    "have merged into a single condensate . ]",
    "although the josephson effect shown in fig.4 is the numerical results of eq .",
    "( [ evo - equation ] ) , one can understand easily this effect with the effective order parameter . due to the quantum merging process",
    ", when the central barrier separating two independent condensates is decreased , two initially independent condensates will merge into a single condensate described by the effective order parameter @xmath4 whose evolution is determined by gp equation ( [ app - equation ] ) .",
    "thus , it is natural that there is coherent josephson current for two initially independent interacting condensates .",
    "in summary , we investigate the dynamic process of the whole system when the barrier separating two initially independent bose superfluids is adiabatically decreased so that the two initially separated and independent superfluids are weakly connected .",
    "when the interparticle interaction is considered , we show that there is an effective order parameter for the whole system under appropriate condition .",
    "compared with previous interesting studies @xcite about quantum merging , in the present work , we consider this problem by stressing the non - orthogonal property between the wave functions for different condensates after their overlapping and in the presence of interparticle interaction .",
    "in particular , it is found that the effective order parameter satisfies the ordinary gross - pitaevskii equation , which means that there is also josephson effect for two initially independent bose superfluids .",
    "this result for the effective order parameter makes our theory can be tested and applied directly in future experiments about quantum merging process , such as the experiment about josephson effect for independent bose superfluids .",
    "we stress here again that , in our theory , the quantum depletion originating from the elementary excitations at zero temperature is omitted in the initial state ( [ initial - state ] ) . based on the bogoliubov theory of the elementary excitations @xcite , the number of particles due to the elementary excitations is of the order of @xmath181 and thus the quantum depletion is negligible for bose condensate in dilute gases .",
    "there is another reason why the elementary excitations can be omitted in the effective order parameter .",
    "a simple analysis shows that @xmath182 and @xmath183 ( here @xmath184 is the normalized wave function of the elementary excitations ) are of the order of @xmath185 with @xmath186 and @xmath187 being respectively the wave number of the elementary excitations and spatial size of the bose superfluid .",
    "this exponential decay of @xmath188 and @xmath189 originates from the integral where there is spatially oscillating phase factor in the wave functions of the elementary excitations and bose superfluid .",
    "thus , even there are elementary excitations , its contribution to the effective order parameter is negligible .",
    "although the present theory can not give quantitative predication for liquid superfluid of @xmath190 because the quantum depletion is very important , we believe that the quantum merging process means that after two separate tanks are connected by a pipe , two superfluids of @xmath190 can merge into a single superfluid .    for the quantum state given by eq .",
    "( 1 ) , with the development of time , the wave functions @xmath12 and @xmath13 are no more orthogonal in the presence of interparticle interaction .",
    "if we use the orthogonal bases @xmath191 and @xmath39 , the quantum state of the whole system is @xmath192 .",
    "we see that the number of particles in the orthogonal modes @xmath12 and @xmath39 are no more definite .",
    "this quantum state becomes a superposition of different number of particles in the orthogonal modes @xmath12 and @xmath39 .",
    "this implies strongly that in some sense our theory is equivalent to the gutzwiller type approach @xcite where the coupling between different modes leads to the coherent transfer of particles between different orthogonal modes .",
    "it is straightforward to generalize the present work to the quantum merging process of several independent bose superfluids .",
    "it is possible that this quantum merging process contributes to our understanding of the bose condensation process . during the evaporative cooling process , firstly there would be a series of independent subcondensates formed from the thermal cloud . due to the quantum merging process , these independent subcondensates will overlap and finally merge into a single condensate with well spatial coherence property . during the evaporative cooling process , due to the thermal equilibrium of the whole system",
    ", the thermal atoms continuously jump into the ground state .",
    "the quantum merging process has the effect that the atoms in the ground sate merge into a single condensate which has well spatial and phase coherence property ."
