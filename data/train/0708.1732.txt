    "the iib matrix model is one of the proposals for non - perturbative string theory @xcite . in the original interpretation",
    ", it naturally describes type iib string theory . in @xcite , the light - cone hamiltonian for type iib string field theory",
    "is derived from schwinger - dyson equations for wilson loops . on the other hand ,",
    "matrix string theory describes type iia string theory @xcite . in this theory , the diagonal elements of the eight scalars form coordinates of the light - cone strings .",
    "this interpretation correctly reproduces the world - sheet action and the joining and splitting of type iia strings @xcite .",
    "however , it has not been clarified whether a matrix model can produce two or more perturbative string theories , although a non - perturbative string theory should include all perturbative vacua .    in the large n limit of the iib matrix model , configurations of simultaneously diagonalizable matrices form a moduli space at least in the one - loop level . here",
    "we discuss stability of such configurations . in a naive reduced model given by @xmath4 ^ 2 $ ] ( @xmath5 ) ,",
    "the one - loop effective action for the diagonal elements @xmath6 is given by @xmath7 .",
    "therefore , if @xmath8 extended configurations of the diagonal elements are unstable because they collapse to a point . in a supersymmetric case ,",
    "if one ignores the diagonal elements of fermionic matrices , the one - loop effective action for the diagonal elements of bosonic matrices is given by @xmath9 , and there is no force between them .",
    "however , one can not ignore the diagonal elements of fermions when the dimensions of a theory is less than one .",
    "in fact , the one - loop effective action for the diagonal elements of both the bosonic and fermionic matrices in the iib matrix model is given by @xmath10 where @xmath11 @xcite . by integrating out @xmath12",
    ", we have a complicated interaction among @xmath13 @xmath14 which is estimated as follows . in the last expression , for each pair of i and j we have three choices @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , which carry 0 , 8 , 16 powers of @xmath12 , respectively .",
    "because we have 16n dimensional fermionic integral @xmath18 , the number of factors other than 1 should be less than or equal to 2n .",
    "therefore , the effective action for @xmath13 is expressed as a sum of terms consisting of less than or equal to @xmath19 factors : @xmath20 where @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 are polynomials .",
    "this should be compared to the effective action in the bosonic case , which is of order @xmath24 we see that supersymmetry reduces the attractive force by order @xmath25 at least in the one - loop level . if this is true to all orders , in the large n limit any of the simultaneously diagonalizable configurations is stable and represents an independent vacuum as in the case of a moduli of scalar fields in the ordinary field theory corrections into account .",
    "this would correspond to instability of perturbative vacua of string theory when non - perturbative corrections are included . ] .",
    "contributions from such vacua are approximately of the same order in the path - integral of the iib matrix model .    instead of integrating over the moduli space",
    ", we can consider each of the simultaneously diagonalizable configurations as a background and set the fluctuations of the diagonal elements to zero .",
    "such procedure is known as quenching in the context of the large n reduced model . in this paper",
    ", we show that type iia string emerges as a vacuum of the iib matrix model , if we introduce such interpretation .",
    "more precisely , we show that the iib matrix model quenched appropriately is equivalent to matrix string theory , which gives type iia string theory .",
    "the moduli space of the iib matrix model also includes other perturbative vacua .",
    "for example , we can show that the iib matrix model quenched in another way gives four - dimensional @xmath26 super yang - mills theory , thus produces type iib string theory on the @xmath27 .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows . in section 2 , we show that by introducing a proper quenching the iib matrix model becomes equivalent to the two - dimensional @xmath0 super yang - mills theory on a cylinder , which is nothing but matrix string theory . in section 3 , we find relations between the coupling constant @xmath28 of the iib matrix model and the string coupling @xmath29 , through matrix string theory . as a result",
    ", we find how we should take the large n limit in the iib matrix model . in section 4 , we summarize and discuss our results .",
    "in general , zero - dimensional matrix models are obtained by dimensional reduction of gauge theories .",
    "such models can reproduce the gauge theories in the large n limit by quenching the diagonal elements to uniformly distributed values @xcite .",
    "if we consider feynman diagrams , the diagonal elements behave as the momenta in the gauge theories , and sums over indices become integrals over the momenta in the large n limit . in this way , the quenched matrix models and the gauge theories are equivalent . therefore",
    ", the iib matrix model can produce the maximally supersymmetric large n gauge theories by quenching the diagonal elements of some matrices to uniformly distributed values and those of the other matrices to zero . as a generalization ,",
    "if we quench the diagonal elements to discrete values instead of continuous ones , the matrix model corresponds to a toroidally compactified gauge theory , because the discrete momenta are conjugate to compactified coordinates .    in the following ,",
    "we show that the iib matrix model quenched in an appropriate way gives the two - dimensional @xmath0 super yang - mills theory on a cylinder , whose bosonic sector is given by @xmath30 ^ 2 \\right ) , \\label{2dimsym}\\ ] ] where @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",

    "the total action is given by @xmath48 where @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath32 and @xmath51 . from this form",
    ", we can see that there is a one - to - one correspondence between the feynman rule for this action and that for ( [ 2dimsym ] ) .",
    "for example , the propagators are given by @xmath52 where @xmath53 .",
    "note that the diagonal elements @xmath54 , @xmath55 and @xmath56 do not appear because of the quenching .",
    "in addition to the one - to - one correspondence between the feynman rules , we can show that in the large n limit the free energy of the matrix model equals that of the yang - mills theory per volume @xmath57 .",
    "if we assume that @xmath58 is finite , planer diagrams dominate when @xmath59 is kept fixed both in the matrix model and yang - mills theory . therefore , the two theories are equivalent under the condition @xmath60    as an example , we compare the values of the feynman diagram depicted in fig .",
    "[ bubble ] .        on the matrix model side , we have @xmath61 where c is a combinatorial factor . in the large n limit , @xmath62 is replaced by @xmath63 because @xmath64 and @xmath65 are uniformly distributed in @xmath66 and @xmath67 , respectively .",
    "then , @xmath68 is rewritten as @xmath69 where @xmath70 .",
    "if we define @xmath71 , @xmath72 and @xmath73 , we have @xmath74 , and thus @xmath75 and @xmath76 are factored out .",
    "finally , we obtain @xmath77    on the other hand , for yang - mills theory ( [ 2dimsym ] ) , we have the free energy per unit volume given by @xmath78 therefore , we have @xmath79",
    "we have shown that the iib matrix model quenched in a proper way is equivalent to the two - dimensional @xmath0 super yang - mills theory on a cylinder , which can be regarded as matrix string theory .",
    "therefore , type iia string theory emerges as a vacuum of the iib matrix model .",
    "this vacuum is specified by two parameters @xmath58 and @xmath80 as in ( [ region ] ) . in this section ,",
    "we discuss how the string coupling @xmath29 is expressed in terms of @xmath28 , @xmath58 and @xmath80 and how we should take a large n limit to obtain type iia string theory .    in order to compare ( [ 2dimsym ] ) with matrix string theory",
    ", we introduce the following redefinition :    @xmath81    where @xmath82 is the string scale .",

    "first , substituting ( [ relation ] ) to ( [ b2relation ] ) , @xmath29 is expressed in terms of the parameters of the matrix model , @xmath85 next , we relate the string coordinates to matrices .",
    "the diagonal elements of @xmath86 are string coordinates in the light - cone gauge @xcite .",
    "the relation between @xmath86 and @xmath87 is given by the second equation of ( [ c2relation ] ) .",
    "when showing the equivalence of ( [ 2dimsym ] ) and ( [ quenched ] ) , we have identified @xmath88 with @xmath89 , which is nothing but @xmath90 by ( [ fields ] ) .",
    "thus we find that the @xmath91-th components of @xmath92 defined by @xmath93 represent the string coordinates .",
    "in other words , an operator as @xmath94 corresponds to the emission vertex of a state with momentum @xmath95 , where @xmath96 is an appropriate polynomial .",
    "now we discuss the manner to take the large n limit . from ( [ relation ] ) and ( [ constants ] )",
    "we find that @xmath28 and @xmath80 should be tuned in the large n limit as@xmath97 note that we have assumed that @xmath59 and @xmath58 is kept finite ( [ planer ] ) . in this limit ,",
    "the uv cut - off @xmath98 ( [ uvcut ] ) goes to infinity as @xmath99 , which guarantees type iia string theory is produced from the iib matrix model .",
    "the iib matrix model has a freedom of redefining the overall scale of the matrices .",
    "that is , the form of the action ( [ iibaction ] ) is unchanged under @xmath100 where @xmath101 is a constant .",
    "here we consider @xmath92 defined in ( [ scale1 ] ) as fundamental variables .",
    "then the parameters @xmath28 , @xmath58 and @xmath80 become @xmath102 , @xmath103 and @xmath104 which are given by @xmath105 here the second and third equations follow from the fact that @xmath58 and @xmath106 specify the eigenvalue distributions of @xmath107 , and thus scale in the same way as @xmath107 . by substituting ( [ prepre ] ) to ( [ pre ] ) , we find how the large n limit should be taken in order for @xmath108 to represent the string coordinates :    @xmath109    where @xmath110 is defined by @xmath111 using ( [ relation ] ) , we can rewrite @xmath110 as @xmath112 , which indicates that @xmath110 is invariant under the redefinition ( [ redef ] ) .",
    "so far we have discussed the leading order in the large n limit . as we discussed in the introduction , although we can freely fix eigenvalues of the matrices by hand in this order , 1/n corrections should determine their distribution dynamically @xcite .",

    "finally , we discuss how @xmath82 and @xmath103 are expressed in terms of @xmath102 and @xmath117 . from ( [ tune1 ] )",
    "we have @xmath118 substituting ( [ stringlength ] ) to ( [ tune2 ] ) , we obtain @xmath119 these results ( [ stringlength ] ) and ( [ volume ] ) are expected to hold for any vacuum because the way of taking the large n limit should not depend on the vacuum .",
    "in fact , they are consistent with the results of some other analyses @xcite .",
    "in the iib matrix model , simultaneously diagonalizable configurations are stable and form a moduli space in the leading order of the large n limit . if we consider fluctuations around each of them with the diagonal elements being quenched , we obtain a perturbative vacuum of string theory .",
    "actually , type iia string theory and type iib string theory on @xmath27 emerge , if we consider fluctuations around appropriate configurations .",
    "therefore , the moduli space should represent at least a part of perturbatively stable vacua of string theory .",
    "we have given a detailed analysis on the case of type iia string theory .",
    "we have shown how the string coupling @xmath29 and the string scale @xmath82 are related to the coupling constant @xmath28 and the range of the eigenvalue distribution @xmath58 in the iib matrix model . as a result",
    ", we find that type iia string theory emerges if the large n limit is taken with @xmath120 and @xmath121 being fixed . here the freedom of overall rescaling of the matrices is fixed such that the matrices represent the string coordinates .",
    "any perturbative string should emerge in the same limit , because the way of taking the large n limit is expected not to depend on the vacuum .",
    "furthermore , if we assume these relations still hold when the eigenvalue distribution is dynamically determined , @xmath82 and @xmath58 are expressed as @xmath122    let us discuss how interactions of type iia superstring are derived in our new interpretation of iib matrix model .",
    "the authors in @xcite show that half - bps classical solutions of matrix string theory determine world - sheets with definite genera when they derive the green - schwartz action . in this sense ,",
    "the world - sheet genus expansion is not directly related to the ordinary 1/n expansion .",
    "although correlation functions of wilson loops factorize in the large n limit , strings are not simply represented by wilson loops in our case .",
    "therefore there is a possibility that interactions of strings can be reproduced only by planer diagrams . in order to examine this possibility",
    ", we need a more precise analysis on the string states , which we intend to report in future publications .",
    "space - times emerge in various manners in the iib matrix model .",
    "first , in the original picture , matrices appear as a regularization of the schild action of type iib string theory @xcite , and they represent the space - time coordinates .",
    "second , in the interpretation we have introduced in this paper , two matrices correspond to conjugate momenta of the world - sheet coordinates , whereas the other eight correspond to the light - cone coordinates of type iia string .",
    "third , as shortly discussed in this paper , the iib matrix model produces the four - dimensional large n @xmath26 super yang - mills theory , and thus produces type iib string theory on the @xmath27 background through the ads / cft correspondence @xcite . in this case , six matrices correspond to the radial coordinate of the @xmath123 and the coordinates of the @xmath124 , whereas the other four matrices correspond to the conjugate momenta of the angular coordinates of the @xmath123 .",
    "fourth , the matrices can be regarded as the covariant derivatives on curved space - times @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to study the relations among these ways of representing space - times .",
