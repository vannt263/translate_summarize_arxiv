    "since it was proposed by etnyre @xcite and first implemented by etnyre and honda @xcite , the most common strategy for classifying legendrian knots in a given knot type @xmath0 has been to approach the problem in two steps .",
    "first , find all legendrian representatives of @xmath0 with maximal thurston ",
    "bennequin invariant , then attempt to show that all other legendrian representatives of @xmath0 can be destabilized to one of these maximal examples .",
    "this method has proven quite effective , but , as observed by etnyre and honda @xcite , not all nondestabilizable legendrian knots have maximal thurston  bennequin invariant .",
    "thus , one needs a means for determining which legendrian knots are nondestabilizable .",
    "a candidate for identifying nondestabilizable legendrian knots is legendrian contact homology , which has been one of the most powerful nonclassical invariants of legendrian knots since it was defined by chekanov @xcite and eliashberg @xcite .",
    "this invariant , which takes the form of a differential graded algebra @xmath1 and is a specialized variant of symplectic field theory @xcite , vanishes for stabilized legendrian knots and is nonvanishing for every nondestabilizable legendrian knot for which it has been computed .",
    "all such examples to date have had maximal thurston  bennequin invariant , but in theorem  [ thm : m10161 ] we show that the legendrian contact homology is nonvanishing for a certain nondestabilizable legendrian knot with nonmaximal thurston",
    " bennequin invariant .",
    "we do this by showing that a related invariant , the characteristic algebra , is nontrivial .",
    "characteristic algebra _ was defined by ng @xcite as @xmath2 and is an invariant of the legendrian knot @xmath3 up to tame isomorphism . here",
    "@xmath4 is a front diagram for @xmath3 , @xmath5 is the free , noncommutative , unital @xmath6-algebra generated by the crossings and right cusps of @xmath4 , and @xmath7 is the two - sided ideal generated by the image of the contact homology differential .",
    "ng conjectured that the characteristic algebra of a nondestabilizable legendrian knot is nonvanishing ( * ? ? ?",
    "* conjecture 6.4.1 ) , which would imply that the legendrian contact homology for such knots is also nonvanishing ( see proposition  [ pro : ca_to_ch_nonvanish ] ) .",
    "we give some evidence for ng s conjecture by providing the first example of a legendrian knot with nonvanishing characteristic algebra which does not have maximal thurston ",
    "bennequin invariant .",

    "a similar argument to that given in the proof of theorem  [ thm : m10161 ] shows that the contact homology and characteristic algebra of chongchitmate and ng s nondestabilizable legendrian @xmath9 are also nonvanishing .",

    "nonvanishing over @xmath6 implies nonvanishing in the more general @xmath10 $ ] setting .",
    "the general situation is still far from clear , however , as we also provide some evidence against ng s conjecture .",
    "chongchitmate and ng exhibited a legendrian @xmath11 which does not have maximal thurston ",
    "bennequin invariant and which they conjectured , based on computational evidence , is nondestabilizable and sits atop its own peak in the @xmath12@xmath13 mountain range . in section  [ sec : char_alg_m10_139 ]",
    "we prove :    [ pro : vanish ] the contact homology and characteristic algebra of chongchitmate and ng s legendrian @xmath11 vanish identically over @xmath10 $ ] .    assuming this knot is actually nondestabilizable",
    ", this would provide the first example of a nondestabilizable legendrian knot with vanishing characteristic algebra or contact homology .",
    "this suggests the following :    [ conj : vanishing ] there exist nondestabilizable legendrian knots with vanishing contact homology .",
    "for background information on legendrian knots and legendrian contact homology , we refer the reader to etnyre s survey @xcite .",
    "we would like to thank john etnyre for suggesting that we explore the relationship between the thurston  bennequin invariant and legendrian contact homology .",
    "thanks also to lenny ng and wutichai chongchitmate for their work creating the legendrian knot atlas @xcite , dylan thurston for his helpful suggestion , and david fithian for his time - saving _ mathematica _ program .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , etnyre and honda @xcite presented the first example of a nondestabilizable legendrian knot whose thurston ",
    "bennequin invariant is nonmaximal for its knot type .",

    ", it is not difficult to derive the plat diagram for the @xmath8 appearing in figure  [ fig : ng ] .    ]",
    "the braid word defining the plat diagram in figure  [ fig : ng ] is : + @xmath16 + in figure  [ fig : ng ] there are a total of 35 crossings and 5 right cusps .",
    "the crossings are labeled @xmath17 through @xmath18 from left to right and the right cusps are labeled @xmath19 through @xmath20 from top to bottom . therefore , for this front diagram for the @xmath8",

    "the full boundary map is given in appendix [ sec : the_differential ] .",
    "we begin with a straightforward observation relating ( non)vanishing properties of the characteristic algebra to contact homology .    [ pro : ca_to_ch_nonvanish ] let @xmath3 be a legendrian knot in the standard contact 3-sphere . if the characteristic algebra of @xmath3 is nontrivial , then so is its contact homology .",
    "suppose that the contact homology @xmath24 of @xmath3 is trivial ( here @xmath25 denotes the two - sided ideal generated by the image of the boundary map inside @xmath26 ) .",
    "then , since @xmath27 , it must be the case that the unit element @xmath28 is contained in @xmath25 .",
