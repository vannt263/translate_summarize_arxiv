    "below we provide a brief summary of the survey and its data .",
    "the dls covers five @xmath14 fields ( hereafter f1-f5 ) . f1 and f2 are in the northern sky , and observed with the kitt peak mayall 4-m telescope / mosaic prime - focus imager ( muller et al .",

    "table 1 lists the coordinates of the five fields .",
    "each mosaic imager provides a @xmath15 field of view with a @xmath16 array of 2 k@xmath17 4 k ccds ( @xmath18 per pixel ) .",
    "we divide each @xmath14 dls field into a grid of @xmath19 array .",
    "each @xmath20 subfield , slightly larger than the camera field of view , was covered with dithers of @xmath21 .",
    "the dls data consists of 120 nights of @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , and @xmath25 imaging .",
    "a priority was given to the @xmath24 filter , where we measure our lensing signal , whenever the seeing was better than @xmath26 .",
    "the mean cumulative exposure time in @xmath24 is about 18,000s per field whereas it is about 12,000s per field for each of the rest of the filters .",
    "the typical exposure time per visit is about 900s .",
    "we applied initial bias , flat , and geometric distortion correction to the dls data with the iraf package mscred .",
    "external astrometric calibration was performed by matching astronomical objects in each exposure to the usno - b1 star catalog using the msccmatch task .",
    "the residual uncertainty in the global coordinate system relative to the usno - b1 catalog is less than @xmath27 .",
    "the mean rms error per object is @xmath28 .",
    "the limiting factor for this scatter per object is believed to be the internal accuracy of the usno - b1 catalog .",
    "internal astrometric calibration between different epoch data was carried out using the common high s / n stars present in the overlapping region .",
    "precise registration is essential in precision weak - lensing analysis because a small @xmath29 pixel error can create a noticeable correlation of object ellipticity over a large scale .",
    "we verify that the mean rms error per object is less than @xmath30 pixel and the scatter is isotropic , which indicates that the scatter is dominated by photon noise .",
    "we found an initial non - negligible ( 10@xmath3120% ) residual flatfielding error in the final stack image after the application of the sky - flat correction .",
    "this is further refined to the 2@xmath315% level using the  bercal \" method ( padmanabhan et al .",
    "interested readers are referred to wittman et al .",
    "( 2012 ) for details of our  ubercal \" implementation and performance .",
    "our team has developed two pipelines ( pipeline i and ii ) for the creation of the final mosaic .",
    "pipeline i is optimized for photometry and consists of independently implemented standalone programs ( wittman et al . in preparation ) .",
    "it performs psf - matched photometry to minimize the systematics in photometric redshift estimation ( schmidt & thorman 2012 ) .",
    "pipeline ii is optimized for weak lensing and controls the flow of the scamp and swarp programs .",
    "we process only r - band data with this second pipeline .",
    "these two pipelines share the above procedures , but differ in that the weak - lensing pipeline uses the subset ( with better seeing and less astrometric issues ) of the dls data and creates a large @xmath14 mosaic image per field whereas pipeline i produces nine ( @xmath19 ) subfield images to cover each @xmath14 field . in [ section_psf_reconstruction ]",
    "we describe this weak - lensing pipeline in detail in the context of the psf reconstruction .      ] .",
    "the eight shaded rectangles depict the eight ccds of the camera .",
    "here we did not clean up outliers ( e.g. , cosmic - ray hit stars , binary stars , etc . ) , and they do not represent real psfs .",
    "a similar degree of psf variation complexity is commonly present in dls data , albeit typically with a smaller amplitude .",
    "[ fig_psf_pattern_focal_plane],width=321 ]    the spatial variation of the psf is substantial and complicated for both the mayall and blanco telescopes .",
    "an example of this psf pattern is displayed in figure  [ fig_psf_pattern_focal_plane ] .",
    "although this particular pattern is observed on 24 february 2001 from the blanco telescope , a similar degree of psf variation complexity is commonly present in all of our dls data .",
    "it is difficult to interpolate the variation over the entire focal plane with a single set of polynomials .",
    "thus , polynomial interpolation should be limited to a smaller area , where the variation is slow and tractable .",
    "hence , we choose to model the psf variation on a ccd - by - ccd basis .",
    "this chipwise approach was investigated by jee et al .",
    "( 2011 ) for the lsst , where the small @xmath32-ratio of the optics makes the potential aberration highly sensitive to ccd flatness , giving rise to a sudden , noticeable jump in psf patterns across ccd boundaries .",
    "for the mayall and blanco telescopes , we often found a somewhat smaller , but clear discontinuity across the ccd gaps , although in principle the relatively large @xmath32-ratio of the two telescopes should make the ccd - to - ccd flatness much less important .",
    "as most lensing signals come from distant , faint galaxies , which sometimes are not even detected in single exposures , these source galaxies are commonly examined after multi - epoch data are combined to produce the deep stack image ( i.e. , single 900s exposure vs. cumulative 18,000s exposure ) .",
    "therefore , it is important that the psf modeling closely mimics the image stacking procedure ( e.g. , offsets , rotations , geometric distortion corrections , etc . ) .",
    "figure  [ fig_psf_overlap ] schematically illustrates how image stacking complicates the psf pattern .",
    "after stacking is performed , across the image boundaries of input frames we often observe a discontinuous change of psf as displayed .",
    "this discontinuity prohibits us from interpolating psfs based on the information obtained only from the final stacked image .",
    "hence , in our dls weak lensing analysis , the psf modeling is performed with the following two steps to address the issue .",
    "first , we construct a psf model for each ccd image using a pca method .",
    "then , the psf on the final mosaic image is computed by weighted combination of all contributing psfs from each ccd image .",
    "below we provide the details for each step .",
    "a @xmath14 mosaic image for each dls field is created with the scamp / swarp software .",
    "the scamp program automatically refines wcs headers of images by first cross - identifying astronomical objects with external standard catalogs and then by  tweaking \" the wcs information of each header in such a way that internal consistency is maximized . because the astrometric solution is already obtained in the photometric pipeline to the weak - lensing precision , we feed the pipeline i catalogs into scamp as an external catalog .",
    "the swarp program utilizes the series of these refined wcs headers to define the global wcs for the final mosaic .",
    "then , the input images are resampled and combined to create the final mosaic .",
    "we use the lanczos3 interpolation kernel , which mimics the ideal sinc kernel and is known to suppress the correlation between pixels .",
    "we estimate that the covariance between adjacent pixels is about 7% of the variance .",
    "this inter - pixel correlation leads to underestimation of both photometric errors and shape errors .",
    "the slight shift in shape errors also changes the weight in our shear correlation computation . in principle",
    ", we can remedy the situation by increasing our rms map to compensate for this underestimation .",
    "however , we conclude that this step is unnecessary because the resulting change in weight distribution is small and well within the interval of the shear calibration marginalization ( [ section_shear_calibration ] ) .",
    "what we should potentially be concerned about is the systematics ( multiplicative ) in shear calibration .",
    "the inter - pixel correlation somewhat smears the galaxy profile and on average circularizes the shapes .",
    "fortunately , since we use the same lanczos3 kernel in image simulations for our shear calibration ( [ section_shear_calibration ] ) , the resulting multiplicative factor already includes this effect .",
    "the swarp program provides an option to keep the intermediate resampled images ( hereafter resamp images ) .",
    "we use these resamp images to identify stars and model psfs because they are properly rotated , shifted , and distortion - corrected .",
    "some frames are found to possess rather large ( @xmath33 pix ) systematic offsets with respect to the stacked image .",
    "in addition , the psf of some frames are significantly larger than our criterion ( fwhm=@xmath34 ) .",
    "about 5% of the data fall into this group , and we exclude these images for the creation of the final stack .",
    "the @xmath14 mosaic image for each field consists of more than @xmath35 ccd images .",
    "consequently , we construct and verify an automated procedure to select high s / n isolated stars and apply pca to them .",
    "our star - selection algorithm relies on the size versus magnitude relation with some important fail - safe procedures .",
    "the algorithm starts with an initial guess of the half - light radius and magnitude range of the `` good '' stars .",
    "of course , because of the variation in telescope seeing and exposure time , the stellar locus shifts exposure by exposure .",
    "thus , we search the two - parameter space iteratively for the stellar locus in the half - light radius range from 1.4 pixels to 5.5 pixels and the magnitude range whose minimum value ( maximum flux ) is adjusted depending on the saturation level of the input frame .",
    "we discard stars if their sextractor ( bertin & arnouts 1996 ) flags are not zero or if their normalized profiles are significantly different from the median . the resulting clean stars are used to derive the principal components ( eigenpsf ) , and the coefficients ( i.e. , amplitude along the eigenpsf ) are computed .",
    "to determine the number of basis functions for a compact description of the psf , we examine fractional data variance for different number of basis functions ( figure  [ fig_pca_variance ] ) .",
    "the total variance does not increase rapidly after five , and thus the choice is somewhat arbitrary .",
    "we choose to keep 20 eigenpsfs , which accounts for @xmath36% of the total variance .",
    "/acs psfs , we observe that the growth slows down notably after @xmath37 ( jee et al . 2007 ) .",
    "for the psf of the 4-m mayall / blanco telescopes , this happens at @xmath38 .",
    "the simpler profile of the ground - based psf ( as opposed to complex , diffraction limited psf of @xmath39 ) requires fewer basis functions .",
    "however , because of the larger fwhm variation ( i.e. , atmospheric seeing ) , the total variance remains slightly lower than in the case of @xmath39/acs ( @xmath36% vs. @xmath40% at 20 ) .",
    "the psf reconstruction of the mayall / blanco telescopes does not show any significant difference in quality as long as the number of eigenpsfs is @xmath41 . in the current study",
    ", we choose to keep 20 eigenpsfs .",
    "[ fig_pca_variance],width=332 ]    after we obtain these 20 eigenpsfs , the @xmath42 star image is decomposed as @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the normalized pixel value of the @xmath42 star image at the pixel coordinate @xmath45 , @xmath46 is the @xmath47 eigenpsf , @xmath48 is the projection of the @xmath42 star in @xmath46 , and @xmath49 is the mean psf . because @xmath46 s are orthogonal to one another , one can determine @xmath48 by multiplying the corresponding eigenpsf to the mean - subtracted star image .",
    "approximately 50 - 200 stars are available per ccd per exposure depending on galactic latitude , and we fit 3rd order polynomials to the spatial variation of the coefficients to enable interpolation at any arbitrary position within the ccd .",
    "when we experiment with 4th order polynomials instead , the interpolation becomes occasionally unstable for some frames , where the number of high s / n stars is not sufficient . in addition , we find that the interpolation by 2nd order polynomials slightly underfit the spatial variation with respect to the 3rd order polynomial result , increasing the amplitude of the residual correlation by 10%-20% .    the psf solution on each ccd on each exposure is iteratively refined by comparing the model psf with the observed star and eliminating significant outliers .",
    "this procedure is justified because we expect the spatial variation of the dls psf to be continuous across each ccd ; in the long - exposure limit the psf variation is dominated by instrumental aberration .",
    "the iteration improves the purity of the stars by removing compact galaxies accidentally included in the initial size - magnitude - based selection , although the contamination rate is already low because we target bright objects .",
    "inevitably , some galaxies may remain after the iteration if their surface brightness profiles closely resemble those of stars .",
    "however , in practice these objects can be treated as legitimate point sources and thus help our psf sampling rather than bias the resulting psf model . as a sanity check ,",
    "we create a color - color plot ( @xmath50 vs. @xmath51 ) using our star candidates and compare their loci with stellar and galaxy tracks .",
    "less than 1% of the data points fall outside the main sequence track .",
    "our visual inspection of these off - the - main - sequence objects show that their morphologies are still indistinguishable from point sources , which reassures that galaxy contamination is negligible in our psf sampling .",
    "the psf models for individual resamp images are inverse - variance weight - averaged to create the psf on the mosaic image , where the weak - lensing signal is measured .",
    "the image header of the resamp file contains the shift information ( i.e. , integer offsets ) . for each object , we need to loop over the list of the resamp files to stack psfs . in order to determine whether or not an object is observed by a given resamp image and also to find the exact weight value used in co - adding , we utilize the corresponding `` projected '' weight map generated by swarp . if the object is found to be within the weight map , we compute the psf at the shifted location ( remember that the resamp images are already rotated to properly align with the final stack ) and applied the corresponding weight .",
    "figure  [ fig_psf_entire ] and  [ fig_psf_entire_model ] illustrate that the above psf stacking scheme closely reproduces the observed ellipticity pattern in f2 . in figure",
    "[ fig_psf_entire ] , the whiskers show the ellipticity distribution of the stars directly measured from the @xmath14 mosaic image .",
    "the psf ellipticity change pattern mimics the @xmath19 pointing pattern of the dls observation .",
    "in addition , it is easy to see that across the exposure boundaries ( where the level of the shade changes ) the psf ellipticity often exhibits a sudden change .",
    "the whiskers in figure  [ fig_psf_entire_model ] display the ellipticity of the model psfs evaluated ( interpolation + stacking ) at the location of these stars .",
    "the similarity in both the size and direction of the whiskers across the entire field is remarkable .    despite this seemingly nice agreement in the psf on the stacked image , however , we find that this initial psf model must be  tweaked \" to remove the psf - induced anisotropy to our satisfaction .",
    "this tweaking is carried out in two steps , for which we provide the details as follows .",
    "first , the model psf tends to have systematically lower ellipticity by @xmath52 with respect to the data psf .",
    "this is because the procedure in the psf sampling from noisy stars slightly circularizes the model psf .",
    "using this imperfect psf model for our galaxy shape measurement leads to non - negligible under - correction .",
    "hence , we compensate for this circularization by increasing the ellipticity ( without altering the position angle ) of the model psf by @xmath52 .",
    "this `` re - stretching '' is implemented by shearing the psf image in real space , and the applied shear is a constant ( fixed for each dls field ) fraction of the psf ellipticity .",
    "the exact amount of re - stretching for this first - level tweaking is determined using the following two diagnostic functions proposed by rowe ( 2010 ) : @xmath53 where @xmath54 and @xmath55 are the ellipticity of the data and model psfs , respectively in complex notation ( see [ section_shear ] ) .",
    "consequently , @xmath56 and @xmath57 show the residual autocorrelation and the data - residual cross - correlation , respectively .",
    "rowe ( 2010 ) suggests that a combined use of these two functions provides an insight into systematics of the model . in figure  [ fig_psf_correlation ]",
    "we display @xmath58 and @xmath59 for f2 .",
    "the left panel displays the result directly obtained from our psf stacking whereas the middle panel shows the result when this psf model on the left panel is re - stretched to compensate for the psf circularization .",
    "the improvement is more noticeable in @xmath59 . when comparing the amplitudes of @xmath56 and @xmath57 , one should remember that @xmath59 is in general more sensitive to the presence of systematics than @xmath58 in part because @xmath59 is a sum of two data - residual ellipticity correlation functions ( in order to cancel the imaginary part ) , and in part because the ellipticity of the psf is higher than that of the residual .",
    "for other possible reasons , we refer readers to rowe ( 2010 ) .",
    "the small residual correlation functions in the middle panel of figure  [ fig_psf_correlation ] suggests that the above re - stretched psf model is an excellent description of the data .",
    "however , we notice that the shapes of galaxies obtained with this re - stretched psf ( middle ) tends to be still under - corrected . in other words , collectively speaking , galaxy shapes are still biased toward the initial anisotropy of the psf .",
    "we suspect that this phenomenon is in part related to the so - called centroid bias mentioned by bernstein & jarvis ( 2002 ) and kaiser ( 2010 ) , where it is argued that even a perfect psf model will not remove the psf bias completely because the centroid of the object is more uncertain along the elongation of the psf .",
    "this bias does not go away even if we treat the centroid as free parameters because the psf - induced pixel correlation still makes the resulting centroid distribution anisotropic .",
    "this is the reason that we need a second - level tweaking mentioned above .",
    "we address this issue by further stretching the model psf so that the ellipticity increases by additional @xmath60 .",
    "the amount of this additional stretching is also a fixed ( for each dls field ) fraction of the psf ellipticity , and the first - order value is determined mainly utilizing our image simulations , where galaxies are randomly oriented ( i.e. , no shear is present ) .",
    "we adjust the stretching factor until the psf - induced residual shear signal vanishes .",
    "then , we refine this factor by making sure that the amplitude of star - galaxy correlations ( [ section_star_galaxy ] ) and b - mode signals ( [ section_b_mode ] ) also decreases simultaneously . the right panel of figure  [ fig_psf_correlation ] shows the resulting @xmath58 and @xmath59 diagnostic functions when this second - tweak is applied to the first - tweak psf model shown in the middle panel .",
    "note that this increases the deviation of @xmath59 from zero at @xmath61 , although this final psf removes the psf - induced anisotropy from galaxy images most satisfactorily among the three cases shown here .",
    "figure  [ fig_star_galaxy_tweak ] displays the star - galaxy correlation functions ( see [ section_star_galaxy ] for the definitions ) for the three cases shown in figure  [ fig_psf_correlation ] .",
    "it is obvious that the psf model that we obtain from the second tweak gives the smallest amplitude for star - galaxy correlations , although the amplitude of the diagnostic function ( especially @xmath57 ) of this psf is not the smallest .",
    "finally , we show the impacts of this psf tweaking on b - mode signals in figure  [ fig_b_mode_tweak ] .",
    "although the difference is somewhat small compared to the test results carried out with the residual psf and star - galaxy correlation , we observe that the b - mode signals are closest to zero when we use the second - tweak psf model . here",
    "we display the b - mode signals in aperture mass statistics , and thus the negative b - model signals at @xmath62 represent not residual systematics , but artifacts arising from the missing data on small scales ( see [ section_equations ] and [ section_b_mode ] for the definition of the aperture mass statistic and the discussion of aliasing artifacts , respectively )",
    ".    one should not be misled into thinking that our psf - tweaking removes any arbitrary b - mode signal .",
    "systematics arising from non - centroid bias can not be made to disappear by simply increasing the ellipticity of every model psf uniformly by a constant factor .",
    "in addition , the above psf - tweaking can not arbitrarily get rid of intrinsic alignment signals .",
    "there exist a number of algorithms for galaxy shape measurement in the context of weak lensing . depending on the approaches to removing psf effect",
    ", we can classify the existing algorithms into moments - based methods and profile - fitting methods .",
    "the former methods measure second - moments for both galaxies and psfs and use them to estimate the pre - seeing ellipticity .",
    "this approach was pioneered by kaiser , squires , & broadhurst ( 1995 ; ksb hereafter ) and fischer & tyson ( 1997 ) , and many variations exist .",
    "the latter algorithms approximate the surface profile of galaxies with some analytic profiles .",
    "these analytic profiles are convolved with psf models before being fit to the images rather than fit to a deconvolved image .",
    "while the classic , moments - based methods continue to be popular and updated , cosmic shear studies are relying more on the second , profile - fitting approach to overcome the potential limitations ( kaiser 2000 ) of the moments - based approach .",
    "our shape measurement algorithm belongs to the second category .",
    "we fit a psf - convolved elliptical gaussian to a galaxy image .",
    "of course , an elliptical gaussian profile is not the best approximation of galaxy profiles .",
    "this sub - optimal fitting is termed  underfitting \" ( bernstein 2011 ) and has been shown to cause some bias in shear estimation .",
    "however , we find that this bias is only multiplicative and thus can be calibrated out with careful image simulations ( discussed in [ section_shear_calibration ] ) .",
    "our experiments with srsic profiles show that although this multiplicative factor is reduced , the measurement uncertainties increase .",
    "this increase in ellipticity uncertainty is attributed to the following two facts .",
    "first , srsic profile fitting takes into account more pixels farther from the object center , introducing larger noise .",
    "second , srsic profile fitting involves more free parameters to marginalize over .",
    "we want to include as many faint galaxies as possible for shear measurement as long as the net noise ( quadratic sum of systematic and statistical noise ) goes down , and we find that using gaussian over other more sophisticated profiles increases the overall s / n of our cosmic shear signal .    formally , a description of a galaxy image with an elliptical gaussian requires the following seven free parameters : normalization , semi - major and semi - minor axes , position angle , background level , and two parameters for the centroid .",

    "our dls shear calibration hereafter is purely based on our image simulation studies , which are described in detail below .",

    "second , ellipticity measurement is a noisy process .",
    "as most lensing signals come from faint galaxies , this measurement noise significantly dilutes the signal .",

    "the purpose of this modified image simulator is to calibrate the conversion of ellipticity to shear .",
    "given the same galaxy profile , the size and intrinsic ellipticity of the psf are the most important factors affecting this calibration parameter .",
    "the main difference in the psf between lsst and the two 4-m telescopes comes from 1 ) different f - ratios ( f/1.24 and f/2.7 for lsst and mayall , respectively ) , 2 ) exposure time ( 15 s vs. 900 s ) , and 3 ) atmospheric seeing ( @xmath93 versus @xmath94 ) .",

    ", the delivered dls psf is severely circularized by atmosphere ( longer exposure and large atmospheric psf ) . after this modification",
    ", we obtain a distribution of psf ellipticity ranging from 2% to 7% , matching the dls data",
    ". another important question might be whether or not the resulting spatial variation within a single dls ccd is realistic .",
    "if our simulated psf lacks a small scale variation compared to that of the data , the psf model in the simulation may be easier to describe than in real situations .",
    "we find that the residual psf correlation for both simulation and data shows a similar residual amplitude , which suggests that the spatial variation of the psf on both simulated images and dls data possess a similar level of complexity .",

    "as this multiplicative factor is determined from the galaxies in the udf , it is possible that the above shear calibration may need to be refined further for the dls data .",

    "currently , the udf images are the only available space - based images that contain virtually noiseless galaxy images down to the limiting magnitude of the dls . therefore , to assess the effect of the sample variance",
    ", we perform another suite of lensing image simulations , but this time with an analytic description of galaxy profiles .",
    "we utilize two publicly available software packages stuff and skymaker , which create astronomical catalogs and images , respectively .",
    "the default generation of the ellipticity distribution in the stuff catalog is rather unrealistic , and thus we modify the output in such a way that the ellipticity distribution per component matches the one in the udf data . because the exact ellipticity correlation between bulge and disk is unknown , we choose to align bulge and disk with an identical axis ratio as a conservative measure .",
    "gravitational lensing shear is applied at the catalog level by altering the object ellipticity .",
    "this allows us to minimize the dilution of the lensing signal from the interpolation noise .",

    "therefore , we adopt the difference in @xmath117 as the maximum deviation due to the sample variance , and we marginalize over @xmath118 with a flat prior in our cosmological parameter estimation .",
    "we did not participate directly in previous community shear calibration efforts such as step and great , although it is worth mentioning here that our elliptical gaussian fitting method is similar to the bernstein & jarvis ( 2002 ) method where the authors propose to shear a galaxy image iteratively until it matches a circular gaussian .",
    "these shear calibration programs provided important contributions by raising the public awareness regarding the key issues of future weak - lensing surveys . however , our independent simulations include the following real - world features that both step and great have not fully addressed yet .",
    "first , our training set data include a spatially varying psf and its estimation through noisy stars .",
    "no spatially varying psf was addressed in step and great08 ( bridle et al .",
    "great10 ( kitching et al .",
    "2012 ) addressed the issue but only in a limited way . in the galaxy challenge",
    "where the participants are asked to measure pre - seeing ellipticity , the spatially varying psf was given as a known function . in the separate challenge",
    "called the star challenge , the psf at star positions was also provided as a known function . the only challenge in the latter is to interpolate / extrapolate the psf to the galaxy location using the known psfs at star positions .",
    "in real - world weak - lensing analysis the psf must be estimated from a finite number of noisy stars , and this imperfect model psf is then applied when measuring pre - seeing galaxy shapes .",
    "second , we address the effect of galaxy morphology on shear measurement by using both real galaxy images and analytic profiles . as mentioned above , our simulation finds that in extreme cases the difference in the multiplicative factor is @xmath114% ( i.e. , 1.08 vs. 1.05 ) .",
    "since the dls is deep , it is important to include many faint ( @xmath119 abmag ) galaxies , whose high s / n proxy images are only available in the udf data .",
    "third , we simulate the effect of object blending .",
    "both great and step have assumed that a galaxy is isolated from the rest of the objects . however , when a survey goes deep as the dls , a significant fraction of the objects overlap with one another .",
    "obviously , the details of how one treats this blending of objects in source detection and shape measurement affect shear calibration .",
    "since we use the same source detection and shape measurement algorithm for both dls and training - set data , our shear calibration bias from blended objects is not an issue .      since the strength of gravitational lensing signal depends on the distance ratios between the observer , lens , and source , one s ability to characterize the amount of bias in photometric redshift estimation is as critical as the ability to control shear systematics for any precision cosmic shear analysis .",
    "because the lensing kernel is broad , individual galaxy photo-@xmath25 estimation errors are of less concern than a skewed probability distribution .",
    "on the other hand , substantial effort should be made to address catastrophic errors , which can bias knowledge of the overall redshift distribution .",
    "the photometric redshift catastrophic errors often arise when there are multiple peaks in the estimated probability distribution @xmath120 . in many cases ,",
    "these catastrophic errors are inevitable because of the inherent degeneracy between galaxy colors and redshift . in order to properly interpret the cosmic shear signal amplitude , it is important to understand the direction of the bias and quantify the fraction of catastrophic outliers",

    "one , if not the most , critical source of systematics in weak lensing is the inaccurate removal of the psf effects from shear measurements .",
    "the problem arises either because the psf model is in error or because the removal procedure is suboptimal despite the correct model . in any case",
    ", the effects of this psf correction error can be classified into two kinds : shear calibration and residual anisotropy .",
    "the degree of the shear calibration and anisotropy systematics are often parameterized by the following multiplicative @xmath211 and additive factors @xmath212 , respectively : @xmath213 where @xmath214 and @xmath92 are the weight - averaged ellipticity and true shear , respectively .",
    "the multiplicative factor @xmath211 can also be affected by the degree of complexity in galaxy shape modeling , but we do not distinguish the effect of psf from that of the galaxy shape modeling in this study .",
    "instead , we determine the global value of @xmath211 from the image simulations described in [ section_shear_calibration ] .",
    "the additive error is mostly caused by imperfect psf - induced anisotropy removal .",
    "a useful diagnostic of the additive error @xmath212 is the following star - galaxy correlation ( bacon et al .",
    "2003 ) : @xmath215 where @xmath216 is the ellipticity of uncorrected stars .",
    "the intrinsic size of the psf ellipticity depends on many conditions and varies widely .",
    "equation  [ eqn_star_galaxy ] makes sure that the amplitude of the star - galaxy correlation @xmath217 is normalized by this intrinsic size of the psf ellipticity to enable a fair comparison with other observations .",
    "however , occasionally the intrinsic psf correlation @xmath218 crosses zero where the transitions between positive and negative correlations occur . in these cases ,",
    "@xmath219 can rise abruptly because of the small denominator if @xmath217 is indeed uncorrelated with @xmath218 .",

    "note that at @xmath221 , the star - galaxy correlation amplitude in f5 is comparable to the statistical errors .",
    "however , the sample variance error is still much larger even in this rare case .",
    "it is important to remember that the galaxy shapes used here are measured with the second - tweak psf discussed in [ section_psf_stacking ] .",
    "these small star - galaxy correlations strongly suggest that the residual systematics after psf correction will be a highly subdominant source of uncertainty in this dls cosmic shear study .      as mentioned in [ section_equations ] , the b - mode statistics provide useful insights into the residual systematics in gravitational lensing .",
    "however , the evaluation of equations  [ eqn_tophat ] , [ eqn_ap_mass ] , and [ eqn_xi_enb ] formally requires the measurement of @xmath185 on large and/or small scales inaccessible to the dls data .",
    "this is a well - known problem in cosmic shear studies . according to kilbinger et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , the missing data on large scales make the @xmath180 statistics valid only up to an offset over the entire range whereas those on small scales suppress the @xmath222 statistics on small scales .",

    "this predicted offset in @xmath228 is @xmath229 for the wmap7 cosmology , which is in excellent agreement with the observed value @xmath230 when we carry out the e-/b - decomposition with the finite - field dls data .",
    "although the exact value of the offset depends on the assumed cosmology , the variation within @xmath231 is comparable to the sample variance of the dls .",
    "therefore , in our presentation of the @xmath232 statistics hereafter we show the results obtained by supplementing @xmath189 at @xmath233 with theoretical predictions for the given redshift distribution .",
    "the addition of the synthetic data at @xmath233 precisely cancels the @xmath229 offset .",
    "this is justified because the result is virtually cosmology - independent .",

    "for example , @xmath241 in f2 is nearly a factor of two higher at @xmath244 than the signal in the other fields , and this is consistent with the rather unusually large number of structures in f2 seen by both red sequence distribution and convergence map ( kubo et al .",
    "these structures are known to be at @xmath245 and @xmath246 , and their angular scales are consistent with the @xmath247 scale of excess shear correlation . because we do not exclude the data in f2 in our cosmological parameter estimation , it is possible that the results are slightly shifted toward high normalization , although the dls fields were randomly chosen . the signal from @xmath248 statistics is similar to @xmath241 except that the data points are less correlated . as expected , the field to field variation in signal is the largest in aperture mass @xmath249 , and the correlation between the data points is the least among the three statistics shown here .",
    "therefore , although the s / n of @xmath242 for each data point is lower than the other two statistics , the information content as a whole is in fact comparable .    in order to maximize the constraining power of our dls data on cosmology , we need to combine the measurements @xmath238 and @xmath239 from all five fields with a careful choice of weighting scheme",
    "the errors are dominated by statistical errors on small scales whereas the sample variance is more important on large scales . for our dls data ,",
    "the transition of this error dominance occurs at @xmath250 ( see figure  [ fig_star_galaxy ] ) .",

    "in addition , no constant offset is observed in @xmath178 and @xmath180 because we supplement the dls data with the synthetic data at @xmath259 .",
    "finally , we display the ring statistic @xmath260 in figure  [ fig_dls_rr ] .",
    "the plot confirms that the b - mode signal is also consistent with zero in this statistic that does not require any synthetic data .",
    "together with the star - galaxy correlation presented in [ section_star_galaxy ] , the absence of the b - mode signals here supports our success controlling weak - lensing systematics .",

    "the various lines represent the predicted signal for different @xmath240 values while we assume the wmap7 cosmology for the rest of the parameters .",
    "the comparison of these predicted values with the data points indicates that the dls data may favor a slightly higher normalization than the wmap7 prediction ( i.e. , @xmath261 ) .",

    "cosmological parameter estimation is performed by comparing observed signals with those predicted by full simulation of the survey in different cosmologies . as discussed in [ section_equations ] , the key component in model predictions is the shear power spectrum @xmath268 , which is obtained by integrating the matter power spectrum @xmath203 along the line of sight weighted by lensing efficiency . using a nonlinear matter power spectrum",

    "it appears that the excess of our dls cosmic shear signal at @xmath262 mentioned in [ section_b_mode ] may contribute to the overall s / n , making contours slightly tighter .",
    "examination of figures  [ fig_dls_tophat]-[fig_dls_xi_enb ] shows that the statistical errors in our cosmic shear data at @xmath326 are very small . because our systematic errors are under good control , the signal on this large scale provides significant constraint limited only by the sample variance . to illustrate the point , we show two additional @xmath322 contours in figure  [ fig_omega_m_vs_sigma_8_additional ] .",
    "when we use the data vectors only at @xmath327 , we can not rule out the combination of an extremely high @xmath240 value and an extremely low @xmath199 value .",
    "such a combination predicts a relatively large cosmic shear signal at @xmath328 ( this is in disagreement with our data ) .",

    "had there remained substantial systematics in our cosmic shear analysis , the contribution from the signal in the @xmath329 range would have been insignificant .      in the regime where cosmic shear data become sample - variance - limited , the role of the cosmology - dependent covariance is critical . to facilitate this discussion",
    ", we show parameter constraints with different covariance matrices in figure  [ fig_impact_of_cov ] .",
    "we consider four cases here : 1 ) a fixed covariance matrix obtained by ray - tracing from the s11 numerical simulation [ ( @xmath199,@xmath330,@xmath240)=(0.238,0.762,0.76 ) ] , 2 ) a fixed covariance matrix obtained by ray - tracing from the millennium run ( mr ; hilbert et al . 2009 ) [ ( @xmath199,@xmath330,@xmath240)=(0.25,0.75,0.9 ) ] , 3 ) a fixed covariance matrix analytically derived by the h11 log - normal approximation [ ( @xmath199,@xmath330,@xmath240)=(0.279,0.721,0.81 ) ] , 4 ) a cosmology - dependent covariance derived using the h11 covariance by first measuring the ratio of non - gaussianity to gaussianity and then applying it to the cosmology - dependent gaussian covariance . for the first three cases where we fix the covariance matrix for a particular cosmology , the result always favors a high-@xmath240/low-@xmath199 combination .",
    "by contrast , the scdc implementation with the h11 covariance in the last case gives the parameter constraints closely resembling the scdc result with the s11 covariance .",
    "as mentioned above , the low amplitude of the signal at @xmath326 plays a critical role in disallowing low @xmath199/high @xmath240 combinations .",
    "however , figure  [ fig_impact_of_cov ] shows that the parameter constraint can only benefit from this large scale cosmic shear signal when the covariance is allowed to vary during the mcmc run .",
    "one may argue that the impact of the scdc on the @xmath0 constraint shown in figure  [ fig_impact_of_cov ] is somewhat counter - intuitive because a cosmology with a large @xmath240 might reduce @xmath322 and thus the scdc might favor a large @xmath240 cosmology . however , we find that a large @xmath240 cosmology also substantially alters the off - diagonal elements of the covariance and the net effect is in fact toward increasing the @xmath322 value for that cosmology .      +      .",
    "the light green contours are obtained when we add the cross terms @xmath296 ( [ section_covariance ] ) between shape noise and shear correlations .",
    "the blue contours are the results for the case when we drop the determinant @xmath331 in the likelihood ( equation  [ eqn_likelihood ] ) .",
    "[ fig_mixed_term],width=332 ]    note that the two scdc implementations with h11 and s11 give a slight difference in contour sizes ( lower right panel in figure  [ fig_impact_of_cov ] ) .",
    "this is because the covariance of h11 is higher than s11 by @xmath332% in the gaussian regime ( @xmath333 ) ( when scaled to the same cosmology ) .",
    "the difference in the gaussian regime is mainly due to the difference in the finite field effect correction between the two methods ( s11 vs. h11 ) .",
    "currently , no consensus has been reached as to which method more accurately corrects for the effect .",
    "one should not be misled into thinking that in the absence of the cosmology - dependent covariance the result always favors a high-@xmath240/low-@xmath199 combination . from our  mock \" data simulations ,",
    "we have seen opposite cases where the result is skewed toward a low @xmath240/high-@xmath199 combination . for these cases",
    ", we also observe that the use of our scdc tends to shift the contours in the correct direction .",
    "of course , there are cases where both fixed and varying covariance matrices yield similar results . however , the number of our mock data simulation runs is not sufficiently large to generalize this observation .",
    "kilbinger et al . (",
    "2012 ) find that the impacts of the cosmology - dependent covariance on parameter constraints are small in their cfht cosmic shear study . because their implementation of the cosmology - dependent sample covariance is different from ours , our speculations on the underlying causes are limited . to begin with",
    ", we do not claim that using fixed sample covariance always leads to a large bias as seen in our dls study .",
    "as mentioned above , in our mock simulation we have seen cases where both fixed and varying covariance matrices yield similar contours .",
    "in addition , the  banana \" of kilbinger et al . is significantly larger than ours ( the 1-@xmath334 contour spans from @xmath335 to @xmath336 while ours ranges from @xmath335 to @xmath156 ) .",
    "therefore , it is possible that the relative impact may become smaller in their study .    in figure",
    "[ fig_mixed_term ] , we demonstrate that the impact of the cross - terms @xmath296 ( [ section_covariance ] ) are negligible in our parameter constraint .",
    "the green contours are obtained when we add the cross - terms @xmath296 to the s11 covariance .",
    "we use equation  35 of joachimi et al .",
    "( 2008 ) to estimate the values for the gaussian case and modified it for the non - gaussian case using the s11 scaling relation .",
    "kilbinger et al .",
    "( 2012 ) report that in their 2d cosmic shear analysis the role of the cross - term is not negligible in contrast to our result . to a first order ,",
    "the ratio of the cross - term to the sample variance is inversely proportional to the product of the amplitude of the non - linear shear power spectrum and the source density .",
    "hence , it is possible that both greater depth ( i.e. , higher amplitude of the shear power spectrum ) and higher source density make this term insignificant in dls cosmic shear analysis .",
    "also plotted in figure  [ fig_mixed_term ] is the result when we run our mcmc without updating the determinant @xmath331 in the likelihood ( equation  [ eqn_likelihood ] ) .",
    "although it shrinks the size of the contours slightly , the difference with respect to the reference is insignificant .",
    "this indicates that the moving determinant is not the main driver causing the difference between the fixed and varying covariance results .",
    "comparison of our dls cosmic shear results with those in previous studies requires some caution .",
    "the following issues make it difficult to track down origins of discrepancies .",
    "first , previous cosmic shear studies obtained relatively long  banana \" shapes in their @xmath0 constraints .",
    "therefore , comparisons should be made at a fixed value of either @xmath240 or @xmath199 . because the slope of the  banana \" can also be different , the choice of the reference will affect the level of agreement .",

    "2000 ; van waerbeke et al .",
    "2000 ; kaiser et al .",
    "different methods of estimating the nonlinear power spectrum affect the normalization of the cosmic shear signal non - negligibly ( @xmath337% in our case ) .",
    "in addition , early cosmic shear studies use gaussian covariance matrices , which may lead to substantial underestimation of parameter uncertainties .",
    "perhaps , counteracting this underestimation is the finite field effect discussed in [ section_covariance ] .",
    "absence of this correction can overestimate the parameter uncertainties .",
    "third , different authors marginalize over different ranges of nuisance parameters for their target parameter estimation .",
    "both the number of nuisance parameters and their ranges sensitively affect the parameter estimation .",

    "<S> we present a cosmic shear study from the deep lens survey ( dls ) , a deep _ bvrz _ multi - band imaging survey of five 4 sq . degree fields with two national optical astronomy observatory ( noao ) 4-meter telescopes at kitt peak and cerro tololo . for both telescopes , </S>",
    "<S> the change of the point - spread - function ( psf ) shape across the focal plane is complicated , and the exposure - to - exposure variation of this position - dependent psf change is significant . </S>",
    "<S> we overcome this challenge by modeling the psf separately for individual exposures and ccds with principal component analysis ( pca ) . </S>",
    "<S> we find that stacking these psfs reproduces the final psf pattern on the mosaic image with high fidelity , and the method successfully separates psf - induced systematics from gravitational lensing effects . </S>",
    "<S> we calibrate our shears and estimate the errors , utilizing an image simulator , which generates sheared ground - based galaxy images from deep _ hubble space telescope _ archival data with a realistic atmospheric turbulence model . for cosmological parameter constraints , we marginalize over shear calibration error , photometric redshift uncertainty , and the hubble constant . </S>",
    "<S> we use cosmology - dependent covariances for the markov chain monte carlo analysis and find that the role of this varying covariance is critical in our parameter estimation . </S>",
    "<S> our current non - tomographic analysis alone constrains the @xmath0 likelihood contour tightly , providing a joint constraint of @xmath1 and @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> we expect that a future dls weak - lensing tomographic study will further tighten these constraints because explicit treatment of the redshift dependence of cosmic shear more efficiently breaks the @xmath0 degeneracy . combining the current results with the wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe 7-year ( wmap7 ) likelihood data , we obtain @xmath3 and @xmath4 . </S>"
