    "if we plot the radio - to - optical flux ratio of quasars , we see two populations , the radio quiet and the radio loud quasars with a few sources , radio intermediate quasars ( riqs ) , between them",
    ". whilst in total flux , riqs appear to be part of the radio - loud distribution , their low extended flux indicates that they might rather be part of the radio - weak distribution .",
    "falcke et al .",
    "( 1996 ) and miller et al .",
    "( 1993 ) proposed that the riqs might be relativistically boosted radio - weak quasars .",
    "iii  zw  2 ( pg 0007 + 106 , mrk 1501 , @xmath3=0.089 ) is one of the riqs and also is one of the most extremely variable radio sources .",
    "it was initially classified as a seyfert 1 galaxy ( e.g. , arp 1968 ; khachitikian & weedman 1974 ; osterbrock 1977 ) but was later also included in the pg quasar sample ( schmidt & green 1983 ) .",
    "iii  zw  2 most likely has a spiral host galaxy ( hutchings & campbell 1983 ; taylor et al .",
    "it is a core - dominated agn with highly inverted synchrotron spectrum with a spectral peak due to self - absorption at 43 ghz ( falcke et al .",
    "1999 ) in outburst and faint extended structure typical for seyfert galaxies .",
    "iii zw 2 is variable up to a factor of 30 within two years with major flares roughly every five years ( see fig .",
    "1 ) . in 1997 , iii zw 2 started a new outburst and we started to monitor this source with the vla and vlba .",
    "we observed iii zw 2 in 27 epochs with the vla in six frequencies ranging from 1.4 to 43 ghz and in 6 epochs with the vlba at 15 and 43 ghz .",
    "the spectral peak stayed constant at 43 ghz during the slow and smooth rise in flux density and we detected no structural change on vlbi scale at 43 ghz during this time ( see first three epochs of fig.3 ) .    in december 1998 , the flux density started to drop rapidly , 2.5 times faster than it rose . at the same time the spectral peak dropped quickly from 43 ghz to 15 ghz during a few months ( see fig.2 ) . applying a simple equipartition jet model we predicted a very rapid expansion during this time .",
    "indeed the fifth epoch of vlba observations showed a drastic structural change on milliarcsecond scales with an apparent expansion speed of @xmath4 ( brunthaler et al .",
    "this expansion speed increases to @xmath5 if one considers the time range during which the drop in peak frequency occurred . after this phase of superluminal expansion and rapid spectral evolution",
    ", the expansion stopped and the spectral evolution slowed down .",
    "however , at 15 ghz the picture is completely different .",
    "iii  zw  2 shows a slow expansion ( @xmath2 ) during the first four epochs , no expansion during the decrease in flux density and again slow expansion when the expansion at 43 ghz stopped again ( see fig .",
    "this apparent contradiction can be explained by optical depth effects in an inflating - balloon model.",
    "in this model , the initial phase of the flux density rise can be explained by a relativistic jet interacting with the interstellar medium or a torus that creates a shock .",
    "a relativistic shock was proposed earlier by falcke et al .",
    "( 1999 ) due to synchrotron cooling times of 14 - 50 days which is much shorter than the duration of the outburst .",
    "the ultra - compact hotspots are pumped up and powered by the jet and are responsible for the flux - density increase .",
    "the post - shock material expands with the maximum sound speed of a magnetized relativistic plasma of @xmath6 .",
    "since the source is optically thick at 15 ghz , one necessarily observes the outside of the source , i.e. the post - shock material expanding at the sound speed . at 43 ghz ,",
    "the source is optically thin and one can look inside the source and see the stationary hotspots .",
    "the rapid expansion at 43 ghz thereafter has marked the phase where the jet breaks free and starts to propagate relativistically into a lower - density medium until it stopped again .",
    "the unique and simple structure and timescales of such outbursts within 5 years makes iii  zw  2 an ideal source to study radio - jet evolution relevant also to radio galaxies , especially those that appear as csos and gpss .",
    "iii  zw  2 remains an extremely unusual object .",
    "so far all relativistically - boosted jets with superluminal motion and typical blazars have been detected in early type galaxies ( e.g. , scarpa et al .",
    "we detected for the first time superluminal motion in a spiral galaxy and the good agreement between structural and spectral evolution demonstrates that we are dealing with real physical expansion and not only a phase velocity .",
    "since one has to look very carefully with frequent time sampling to detect this superluminal motion , it is possible that other seyferts and radio quiet quasars also have relativistic jets in their nuclei .",
    "the fact that the sub - pc jet could be relativistic while they appear sub - relativistic at larger scales ( roy et al .",
    "2000 ) , raises the question : are seyfert - jets decelerated on the pc - scale ?"
