    "we have grown graphene on the si - face of sic .",
    "our 4h sic wafers were hydrogen - etched before insertion into ultra high vacuum ( uhv ) . to remove residual oxygen impurities we deposited si from a commercial electron beam evaporator at a substrate temperature of 800@xmath9c until a sharp ( 3@xmath273 ) low energy electron diffraction ( leed ) pattern was observed .",
    "we graphitized the samples by direct current heating at elevated temperature .",
    "the sample temperature was measured with an optical pyrometer at an emissivity of 63@xmath28 .",
    "an annealing temperature of 1100@xmath9c for five minutes is sufficient for the formation of the zero layer ( zl ) , a pure carbon layer , where every third c - atom forms a chemical bond to a si - atom in the layer below .",
    "this zl has no graphene properties , in particular , instead of the linear dispersion at the @xmath5-point of the surface brillouin zone there are two non - dispersing bands at @xmath6ev and @xmath7ev initial state energy . upon further annealing at 1150@xmath9c for five minutes a purely sp@xmath1-hybridized carbon layer forms on top of the zl which shows the linear band structure characteristic of massless charge carriers in graphene .",
    "this graphene layer is referred to as the conventional monolayer ( cml ) in the following .",
    "we deposited gold from a commercial knudsen cell at room temperature on a graphene zl and annealed the sample at 800@xmath9c for five minutes .",
    "after this annealing step the linear dispersion characteristic for graphene is clearly visible around the @xmath5-point of the surface brillouin zone .",

    "the angular resolution of 0.4@xmath9 offers a momentum resolution of 0.023@xmath16 at the fermi level .",
    "this is comparable to the offset that was subtracted in fig .  2 a ) of the manuscript for the cml and the pml@xmath13 .",
    "the fermi surfaces for the cml and nml@xmath13 were measured with a step size of 0.25@xmath9 along the @xmath30 direction . as the linewidth for the pml@xmath13 is narrower than for the cml and the nml@xmath13 we had to reduce the stepsize to 0.1@xmath9 to allow for reasonable data fitting .        the images in fig .",
    "3 a ) of the manuscript were measured with a room temperature scanning tunneling microscope ( stm ) .",
    "the sic samples with a zl or cml on top were transferred to the stm chamber in air .",
    "annealing of the samples at 800@xmath9c was sufficient to remove any adsorbates from the surface .",
    "au was deposited _ in situ _ from a commercial electron beam evaporator .",

    "the image for the cml shows the graphene ( 10 ) spot surrounded by satellite peaks from the ( @xmath8)r30@xmath9 reconstruction .",
    "the graphene ( 10 ) spot and the two left lower satellite spots have roughly the same intensity . for the zl",
    "there is no graphene spot visible at 126ev , only the satellite spots are there .",
    "the pml@xmath13 has a very bright graphene spot , whereas the satellite peaks are considerably reduced in intensity .",
    "furthermore , the distance between the satellite peaks and the graphene peak is smaller than for the cml indicating a larger lattice constant of the superstructure .",
    "this can be related to the strain release in the pml@xmath13 that was revealed in the raman measurements in fig .",
    "3 b ) of the manuscript .",
    "the strain release results in a new commensurate periodicity in agreement with the stm measurements in fig .  3 a ) of the manuscript that show an increase of the superlattice constant by about a factor of two when comparing cml and pml@xmath13 .",
    "the leed image for the nml@xmath13 is very similar to that of the cml indicating a similar influence of the underlying substrate in both cases .",
    "the raman spectra shown in the manuscript were measured under ambient conditions using an argon ion laser with a wavelength of 488 nm .",
    "the laser spot size was 400 nm in diameter and the laser power was 4mw .",
    "the measured graphene signal is rather weak and superposed by the signal from the sic substrate . for the raman data shown in fig .",
    "3 b ) of the manuscript we subtracted the substrate contribution so that the graphene peaks become clearly visible [ 2 ] .",
    "the raman spectra are characterized by three main graphene contributions : the g peak corresponds to an in - plane vibration of the two sublattices with respect to each other .",
    "the d and 2d peak come from a double resonance scattering process [ 3 ] .",
    "the 2d peak is always visible , whereas the d peak only appears in the presence of defects .",
    "both g and 2d peaks shift as a function of doping [ 4 - 6 ] and strain [ 7,8 ] .",
    "therefore , it is difficult to determine charge carrier concentration and strain directly from the raman data .",
    "however , the doping induced shift is strongest for the g peak [ 5,6 ] , whereas the effect of strain is more pronounced for the 2d peak [ 7 ] .",
    "if the effect of the charge carrier concentration can be determined by another procedure ( in this case arpes data ) , the raman data provide useful information about strain ."

    "<S> [ figure1 ] b ) , the most striking difference is the absence of replica bands for the pml@xmath13 and nml@xmath13 . even on the logarithmic color scale of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ figure1 ] b ) the replica bands are invisible , indicating a reduced influence of the ( @xmath8)r30@xmath9 reconstruction . low energy electron diffraction ( leed ) images ( shown in the epaps ) reveal a strong decrease of the intensity for spots related to the ( @xmath8)r30@xmath9 reconstruction for the pml@xmath13 as compared to the graphene - related spots . </S>",
    "<S> for the nml@xmath13 , however , the ( @xmath8)r30@xmath9 spots have a similar intensity as for the cml . </S>",

    "<S> we attribute this to an increased graphene - to - substrate distance as will be discussed later in this paper .    to analyze the band structure in more detail and gain access to the relevant scattering mechanisms we determined the full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) of the bands by fitting momentum distribution curves ( mdcs ) along the @xmath15 direction with lorentzian lineshapes and a constant background . </S>",

    "<S> is mainly determined by the experimental resolution ( see epaps ) . for the nml@xmath13 , however , the linewidth offset is significantly larger than the limit set by the experimental resolution . in this case </S>",
    "<S> the offset is determined by impurity scattering which gives a constant contribution to the linewidth at all energies .    </S>",
    "<S> there are three main contributions to the quasiparticle lifetime in graphene @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the increase in linewidth around 200mev is caused by electron - phonon coupling which depends on the size of the fermi surface . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , its influence is largest for strongly n - doped graphene ( nml@xmath13 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the pronounced maximum near the dirac point is attributed to electron - plasmon scattering . </S>",
    "<S> the third contribution to the line width is electron - electron scattering , which has been found to be proportional to @xmath17 , where @xmath18 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the fwhm for our cml is in good agreement with the data reported in ref.@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> also , the cml and the nml@xmath13 have a similar linewidth . the main difference between the two is the position of the plasmon peak which is determined by the position of the dirac point and hence the doping level . </S>",
    "<S> the pml@xmath13 , however , has a much lower linewidth over the whole range of energies indicating a reduced electron - electron scattering . </S>",
    "<S> as the fermi surface for the pml@xmath13 is rather small ( see fig .  [ figure1 ] b ) the electron - phonon contribution to the linewidth is negligible . </S>",
    "<S> the local maximum in linewidth around @xmath19ev initial state energy for the pml@xmath13 is not located at the dirac point . therefore </S>",
    "<S> , we do not interpret this as originating from plasmons within the graphene layer according to @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we tentatively attribute this peak to plasmons localized mainly in the au clusters on top of the pml@xmath13 that interact with the electrons in the graphene layer . </S>",
    "<S> varykhalov et al . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite found a similar feature for graphene / au / ni(111 ) which they attributed to an interaction between au and graphene . </S>",
    "<S> the overall much smaller linewidth for the pml@xmath13 corroborates the conclusion from leed that the pml@xmath13 is decoupled from the substrate . as mentioned before , the measured linewidth for the pml@xmath13 near the fermi level is mainly determined by the experimental momentum resolution of @xmath20@xmath16 . </S>",
    "<S> this allows us to estimate a lower limit for the carrier lifetime using @xmath21 . with @xmath22ev , we find that @xmath23fs which is the same order of magnitude as the value reported for multilayer graphene on the c - face of sic @xcite .    to gain a deeper insight into the structure of the pml@xmath13 and nml@xmath13 , we measured the au @xmath24 core level spectra using a photon energy of 150ev . </S>",
    "<S> the spectra in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ figure2 ] b ) for the pml@xmath13 ( blue ) and the nml@xmath13 ( green ) show two different contributions to the au @xmath24 core level . </S>",
    "<S> the doublet at higher binding energy was attributed to au - si bonds before @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the doublet at lower binding energy belongs to au - au bonds @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the peak positions are summarized in table [ table ] .    combining these observations with the band structures in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ figure1 ] , we can deduce a schematic as depicted in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ figure2 ] c ) . </S>",
    "<S> the appearance of a linear dispersion typical for graphene implies that the c - si bonds between zl and substrate break and a completely sp@xmath1-hybridized carbon monolayer is created . </S>",
    "<S> the core level spectra show the existence of au - si bonds for both the nml@xmath13 and the pml@xmath13 . </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that the au atoms intercalate between the zl and the substrate replacing the c - si bonds by au - si bonds . from the core level peak intensity for the nml@xmath13 </S>",
    "<S> , we find about one third monolayer of au intercalated ( one monolayer corresponds to two au atoms per graphene unit cell ) . </S>",
    "<S> this is consistent with the observation that every third carbon atom in the zl forms a c - si bond @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> for the pml@xmath13 , about one monolayer of gold is intercalated . from atomic force microscopy ( afm - not shown here ) and stm measurements </S>",
    "<S> , we find that additional au atoms are not intercalated , but form au clusters on top of the graphene layer . despite the fact that a complete monolayer of gold is intercalated for the pml@xmath13 </S>",
    "<S> the substrate does not become metallic . </S>",
    "<S> apart from the graphene bands , there are no other states visible at the fermi energy .    </S>",
    "<S> the doping behavior for different au coverages has been addressed by the theoretical work of giovannetti et al .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite who predicted p - type doping for graphene on a au substrate . reducing the au - graphene distance to @xmath25 , however , will lead to n - type doping . </S>",
    "<S> the larger amount of intercalated au for the pml@xmath13 should increase the distance between graphene and substrate . </S>",
    "<S> this is consistent with the observed doping behavior as well as the reduced influence of the ( @xmath8)r30@xmath9 interface reconstruction on the fermi surface and the leed images of the pml@xmath13 .    </S>",
    "<S> the peak position for the au @xmath24 doublet associated with au - si bonds shifts by about 860mev from nml@xmath13 to pml@xmath13 . </S>",
    "<S> this can be related to the observed difference in the doping and a small change of the work function . </S>",
    "<S> the au - au component , on the other hand , shifts only by about 520mev . </S>",
    "<S> we attribute the au - au bonds to au clusters on top of the graphene layer . </S>",
    "<S> these clusters have an average size of a few nanometers ( see fig .  [ figure3 ] a ) . for such nanoparticles </S>",
    "<S> the position of the core levels depends rather sensitively on the size of the particle @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the shift of the au - au component of the au @xmath24 core level is most likely related to the size of the particular au clusters .    as both leed and arpes average over a rather large area on the sample surface , we used stm to gain access to the structure of the surface on an atomic scale . </S>",
    "<S> fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ figure3 ] a ) shows topographic images of the cml and the pml@xmath13 . </S>",
    "<S> the cml shows a honeycomb lattice with a ( @xmath8)r30@xmath9 modulation imposed by the zl . </S>",
    "<S> the graphene lattice of the pml@xmath13 is well ordered with single defects ( black ) and some gold clusters ( white ) . </S>",
    "<S> the pml@xmath13 shows a superstructure of parallel stripes with a width of about 3 nm as marked by blue arrows in the right panel of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ figure3 ] a ) . </S>",
    "<S> this superstructure could be of similar origin as the one reported in @xcite despite the fact that the samples in @xcite were prepared by depositing au on a cml . </S>",
    "<S> the change of the lattice constant of the superstructure between cml and pml@xmath13 is also visible in leed measurements ( see epaps ) .    to further investigate the degree of decoupling of the pml@xmath13 , fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ figure3 ] b ) shows raman scattering data measured for the cml and the pml@xmath13 . </S>",
    "<S> the substrate contribution to the raman data was subtracted from the spectra so that the graphene peaks are clearly visible @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the raman spectrum for the zl ( not shown here ) does not show any graphene related features . </S>",
    "<S> the 2d peak of the pml@xmath13 ( blue ) appears at 2685 cm@xmath16 . </S>",
    "<S> it is red - shifted by 50 cm@xmath16 as compared to the 2d peak of the cml . </S>",
    "<S> as the 2d peak position is only weakly dependent on charge doping @xcite , we attribute the shift of the 2d peak to an increase of the lattice constant in agreement with the leed data ( see epaps ) . the compressive strain present in the cml </S>",
    "<S> is apparently released in the pml@xmath13 . </S>",
    "<S> this confirms the strongly reduced interactions observed in the analysis of the arpes linewidth . the data in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ figure3 ] b ) also suggest that the d : g peak intensity ratio has decreased for the pml@xmath13 ( blue ) . </S>",
    "<S> the d peak only exists in the presence of defects in the graphene lattice . </S>",
    "<S> a reduced d : g peak intensity ratio therefore indicates an improved crystalline quality .    we have shown that it is possible to decouple the graphene zl formed on the si - face of sic from the substrate by au intercalation . </S>",
    "<S> this new slightly p - doped graphene has an improved quality and is only weakly influenced by the underlying substrate . </S>",
    "<S> our arpes measurements for the pml@xmath13 reveal a considerable reduction in linewidth . </S>",
    "<S> our estimation for the carrier lifetime is of the same order of magnitude as the value for multilayer graphene on the c - face of sic . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , we expect a considerable increase in carrier mobility for the pml@xmath13 and correspondingly the transport properties of our pml@xmath13 to be closer to those for multilayer graphene on the c - face of sic .    </S>",
