    "the graphene is a single - layer honeycomb lattice of carbon atoms coated on the surface of some materials.@xcite the dirac cone structure in the energy spectrum is responsible for some of the unusual properties of the system.@xcite study of the behaviors of electrons in graphene is one of the currently focused areas in the condensed - matter physics . in the theoretical investigations ,",
    "most of the calculations are based on the continuous model with simplified dirac cone dispersion,@xcite and the coulomb interactions between electrons are treated in the random - phase approximation ( rpa ) . since the interactions are correctly taken into account in the long wavelength limit , this approach should reasonably describe the low energy behaviors of the electrons within the validity of rpa .",
    "in such a model , however , the lattice - structure effect and the short - range part of the coulomb interaction have been completely neglected .",
    "thus , it is desirable to explore this problem by a more realistic approach including the effect of the graphene lattice and a self - consistent scheme beyond the rpa .    in this paper",
    ", we use the tight - binding model defined on the two - dimensional honeycomb lattice to formulate the green function theory of electrons in graphene . in the self - energy of electron green function ,",
    "the coulomb interactions are taken into account with the renormalized - ring - diagram approximation ( rrda ) .",
    "this approximation is well known to satisfy the microscopic conservation laws.@xcite our recent investigation of the two - dimensional electron system@xcite shows that the rrda can accurately reproduce the result of the fixed - node - diffusion monte carlo simulation for the ground - state energy.@xcite it is therefore expected that the rrda could give more reliable description for the behaviors of electrons in graphene .",
    "for readers convenience , we here briefly review the structure of a honeycomb lattice and its reciprocal lattice.@xcite for the sake of numerical computation , we will also present the mapping between coordinates defined on the basic vectors of the honeycomb lattice and the orthogonal coordinates .",
    "the graphene lattice is of the honeycomb structure as shown in fig .",
    "a set of basic displacement vectors of the lattice is @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the lattice constant .",
    "we will chose @xmath1 as the unit of length , and thereby set @xmath2 hereafter .",
    "the area of the unit cell is @xmath3 in unit of @xmath4 .",
    "the whole lattice can be viewed as a quadrilateral lattice consisting of the unit diamond cells .",
    "there are two sites in each unit cell : black and green . with @xmath5 and @xmath6",
    ", we then define the unit vectors of the reciprocal lattice shown in fig .",
    "they are given by @xmath7 where * z * is the unit vector in the direction of @xmath8 .",
    "the basic displacement vectors of the reciprocal lattice are @xmath9 and @xmath10 . the first brillouin zone ( bz )",
    "is the hexagon .",
    "the diamond enclosed by the red dashed lines in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] is an equivalent first bz that is a convenient choice for numerical calculation .    for the use of numerical calculation",
    ", we here write down the transform between the coordinates on the basis of \\{@xmath11 } and the orthogonal axes in real space . consider a vector @xmath12 in the representation of \\{@xmath11}. we denote this vector in the orthogonal coordinate system as @xmath13 .",
    "then the correspondence between these two sets of coordinates is given by @xmath14 the matrix @xmath15 of the transform @xmath16 is therefore given by @xmath17 where the first and second columns are the coordinates of vectors @xmath5 and @xmath6 respectively .",
    "analogously , in the momentum space , we obtain the transform between the coordinates of a vector @xmath18 defined in the orthogonal system and its projections @xmath19 on the basis \\{@xmath20}. denoting the transform as @xmath21 , we have @xmath22 where the first and second columns are respectively the vectors @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "the two matrices @xmath15 and @xmath25 are related by @xmath26 with @xmath27 the transpose of @xmath15 .    for the later use",
    ", we here discuss the fourier transform .",
    "the function @xmath28 defined on the honeycomb lattice sites can be expanded as @xmath29 where the @xmath18-integral is over the first bz with @xmath30 its area , the components of @xmath31 and @xmath18 are given in the orthogonal coordinate system , and @xmath32 is the fourier component of the function @xmath28 .",
    "( a function and its fourier component are distinguished by their arguments in this paper .",
    "we also adopt the convention that a capital vector implies its components defined in the orthogonal coordinate system , while a lowercase vector means that its components are given in the basis \\{@xmath33 } in real space or \\{@xmath34 } in the momentum space ) . in the basis \\{@xmath11 } , the function @xmath28 is given by @xmath35 . from eq .",
    "( [ f ] ) , we get the expansion for the function @xmath36 , @xmath37 therefore , the fourier component of @xmath38 is given by @xmath39 .",
    "this relationship is useful for the fourier transform of the coulomb interaction .",
    "for describing the electron system , we use the tight - binding model in which the nearest - neighbor hopping and the coulomb interaction are taken into account .",
    "firstly , we consider the hopping term , @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the hopping parameter , @xmath42 means the nearest - neighbors , @xmath43 ( @xmath44 ) is the creation ( annihilation ) operator of electrons at site @xmath45 with spin @xmath46 . with the basis of \\{@xmath11 } , we hereafter designate the coordinates of an unit cell as that of the black site at the left lower corner of the cell as shown in fig .",
    "the position of a site can then be denoted as @xmath47 where @xmath48 implies @xmath48-th unit cell and @xmath49 corresponds to black ( green ) site .",
    "the electron operator , for example the annihilation one , should be then denoted as @xmath50 .",
    "expanding the operator with the plane waves , we have @xmath51 with @xmath52 as the number of total unit cells of the lattice , and @xmath53 as the position vector of the @xmath48-th unit cell .",
    "under such a convention , we can easily rewrite @xmath54 in momentum space .",
    "the result is @xmath55 here the electron operators are given by spinors , @xmath56 with the first and second components denoting electrons respectively at the black and green sublattices , @xmath57 with @xmath58 s as the pauli matrices , and @xmath59 with @xmath60 and @xmath61 as the components of the electron momentum @xmath62 in the basis of \\{@xmath20}.    the special feature of graphene is in the energy dispersion .",
    "the eigenvalues of @xmath63 are @xmath64 with @xmath65 in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , we show the energy dispersion of upper band . clearly , @xmath66 depends on @xmath62 linearly only when @xmath62 closes to @xmath67 where it vanishes . in the continuous model ,",
    "the energy dispersion is approximated by simple cones .    .",
    "[ fig3 ]    we next consider the coulomb interaction .",
    "the interaction @xmath68 between two electrons respectively at positions @xmath69 and @xmath70 is given by @xmath71 where @xmath72 denotes the position of the @xmath45 ( @xmath48)-th unit cell , @xmath73 is the static dielectric constant due to the screening by the electrons of carbon core and the substrate , and @xmath74 is the vector from the black site to green site in an unit cell as shown in fig .",
    "1 . the on - site interaction @xmath75 is the coulomb repulsion between electrons of anti - parallel spins , leading to the short - range antiferromagnetic correlations ( afc ) .",
    "since the afc is not significant in graphene , @xmath75 should not be too large . in our calculation , we set @xmath76 which is double of the nearest - neighbor interaction .",
    "for the long - range coulomb interacting system , the final result should not sensitively depend on such a small but reasonable @xmath75 . by taking into account only the charge fluctuations ( with the spin fluctuations neglected ) , the interaction term of the hamiltonian in momentum space",
    "is given by @xmath77 where @xmath78 is the electron density operator , and @xmath79 is the fourier component of the coulomb interaction .",
    "since the total charge of the electrons is neutralized by the background of positive charges , the @xmath80 term is excluded from the summation .",
    "the elements of @xmath79 are given in appendix a.",
    "the green function of electrons is defined as @xmath81 where @xmath82 is the imaginary time , and @xmath83 means the statistical average of the @xmath82-ordered product of the operators . in the frequency space , @xmath84 is given by @xmath85^{-1 } , \\label{g}\\ ] ] where @xmath86 with @xmath87 the chemical potential , @xmath88 is the fermionic matsubara frequency , and @xmath89 is the self - energy . for brevity ,",

    "the chemical potential @xmath87 is determined by the electron density ( that is the electron number per site ) , @xmath102 from equations ( [ g])-([mu ] ) , the green functions can be self - consistently determined . using the pad",
    "approximation,@xcite we obtain the retarded self - energy @xmath103 and then the green function @xmath104 under the analytical continuation @xmath105 .    in order to do an effective numerical calculation , it is necessary to get a clear understanding of the symmetry of the green functions , and this is shown in appendix b.    on the other hand , we need to pay attention to the behavior of the screened interaction @xmath106 .",
    "since it approaches to the bear coulomb interaction @xmath107 in the limit @xmath108 , @xmath106 can be separated into two parts , @xmath109 , where @xmath110 is the induced interaction from the ring diagrams . the contribution of @xmath107 in the self - energy yields the exchange part . here ,",
    "an important point is that the behavior of @xmath110 in the limit @xmath111 by rrda is very different from that by rpa . for the sake of illustration",
    ", we use the descriptions for @xmath107 and @xmath98 by their pauli components . in the limit @xmath111",
    ", we have @xmath112 where @xmath113 . for @xmath110 in the same limit , we get @xmath114 with @xmath115 $ ] . in rpa , @xmath116 vanishes for @xmath117 .",
    "however , in rrda , @xmath118 , it means the dynamic screening effect in the long - wavelength interactions .",
    "as is well known , the ring diagrams in the rpa include the contribution of plasmon excitations .",
    "the plasmon frequency @xmath119 is determined by the long - wavelength behavior of the charge polarizabilty @xmath120_{rpa } \\propto q^2 $ ] at @xmath111 .",
    "this polarizability is calculated in the absence of interactions . under the rrda ,",
    "the corresponding polarization diagram of @xmath121 is calculated with renormalized green functions , and it does not have such a behavior as in rpa .",
    "the renormalized - ring - diagram summation does not result in the desired plasmon excitations .",
    "the correct way to obtain the plasmon excitations is to calculate the two - particle green function in which the vortex corrections need to be considered . under the rrda that is a conserving approximation for the single - particle green function ,",
    "the kernel of the equation for the two - particle propagator is generated from the functional derivative of the self - energy diagrams with respect to the green function.@xcite the calculation of the two - particle propagator needs a more complicated mathematical procedure and is beyond the scope of the present approach .",
    "under the present approximation , the screening effect is negligible only at sufficient large matsubara frequencies .",
    "this requires a considerable amount of numerical calculations . to save the computer time , the summations over the matsubara frequencies in eqs .",
    "( [ se ] ) and ( [ chi ] ) need to be performed with special method .",
    "we have developed a super - high - efficiency algorithm for the series summations.@xcite in the present calculation , we have used the parameters @xmath122 = [ 2,15,5]$ ] for selection of the matsubara frequencies distributed in @xmath123 successively connected blocks each of them containing @xmath124 frequencies with @xmath125 the integer - parameter that the stride in the @xmath126-th block is @xmath127 .",
    "the total number of the frequencies selected here is @xmath128 .",
    "the largest number @xmath129 is about @xmath130 for the cutoff frequencies @xmath131 and @xmath132 . for the lowest temperature considered here , @xmath133",
    ", we have @xmath134 . at the frequencies larger than the cutoff",
    ", @xmath110 is negligible small . for illustrating the numerical method , an example for calculation of the element @xmath135 is given in appendix c.    on the other hand , the momentum integrals in eqs .",
    "( [ se ] ) and ( [ chi ] ) are convolutions . these integrals can be efficiently carried out by fourier transforms . here",
    "again , we should pay attention to @xmath110 .",
    "it should be carefully transformed from @xmath136-space to @xmath137-space since it has a sharp peak at @xmath80 as indicated by eq .",
    "( [ walv ] ) .",
    "this long - wavelength singular part should be subtracted from @xmath110 and can be treated especially .",
    "it saves computer time to perform the transform of this singular part in the orthogonal coordinate system because where it is isotropic and the @xmath138-integral within a circle close to the origin can be reduced to a one - dimensional one . only within this circle ,",
    "we need a very fine mesh for the integral . in the rest part of the hexagon brillouin zone",
    ", one can use a crude mesh doing the two - dimensional integral because where the integrand is not singular .",
    "the remained part of @xmath110 should be a regular function except there may be some undulations close to @xmath80 due to the subtraction .",
    "another point we should take care about is that the green function varies drastically around and close to the fermi surface at low temperatures .",
    "since the band structure is not flat at the fermi energy , the mesh for @xmath136-space integral should be fine enough around and close to the fermi surface .",
    "we here give an example for sampling the points in momentum space .",
    "this example is for the zero - doping . under the same consideration",
    ", the sampling for finite doping cases can be planed similarly .",
    "we divide the range @xmath139 $ ] in each axis in momentum space into four blocks shown as in fig .",
    "there are @xmath140 equal meshes in the @xmath45-th block and @xmath140 s are given by @xmath141 the finest mesh is for the third block @xmath142 $ ] which is centered with @xmath143 . in the brillouin zone , this leads to a very fine mesh around the dirac points @xmath67 .",
    "the second finest mesh is for the first block , which is designed for dealing with the undulations of the remained part of @xmath110 ( after the subtraction of the sharp peak ) when it is fourier transformed from @xmath136-space to @xmath137-space .",
    "the rest two blocks have relatively crude meshes because the green function is smooth there .",
    "our numerical algorithm considerably saves the computer memory and time . the similar method and its accuracy",
    "have been demonstrated by a recent study on the two - dimensional electron system with infinite band width and long - range coulomb interaction.@xcite with our numerical algorithm , we have solved the above equations by iteration .",
    "the system is characterized by the coupling constant @xmath144 that is defined by the ratio between the overall - average interaction energy @xmath145 and the hopping energy @xmath41 , @xmath146 the parameters @xmath41 = 2.82 ev and @xmath1 = 2.4  are known from the experimental observations.@xcite by choosing @xmath147 , we have @xmath148 0.5 .",
    "therefore , the graphene is a moderately - coupled coulomb system .",
    "firstly , we present the result for the spectral density that is defined by @xmath149 where @xmath150 . in the non - interacting case , @xmath151 reduces to the @xmath152-functions representing the energy dispersions of the two bands . in the present case ,",
    "the energy levels are broadened because of the many - body effect . shown on the left panel in fig .",
    "[ fms ] is an intensity map of the spectral density in the energy - momentum plane at the doping concentration @xmath153 = 0.02 and temperature @xmath154 = 0.02 .",
    "this map exhibits the energy distribution of the states as a function of momentum along the high symmetry directions @xmath155-m - k-@xmath155 in the brillouin zone . for comparison ,",
    "the free - particle energy dispersion @xmath156 ( with @xmath157 the chemical potential of the non - interacting system ) is also depicted as the solid curve . clearly , because of the coulomb effect , the energy distribution has finite width , implying the finite life times of quasiparticle .",
    "in addition , the scale of the energy band is enlarged .",
    "the dashed curve is a rescale of the solid one . with comparing to the non - interacting dispersion",
    ", the energy band is magnified with a factor about 1.1 .",
    "actually , the exchange self - energy results in an additional hopping of the electrons , which renormalizes the kinetic energy.@xcite to see this , we express the exchange self - energy in real space , @xmath158 where @xmath159 is the coulomb interaction between electrons at sites @xmath45 and @xmath48 . [ here @xmath45 and @xmath48 mean the positions of the lattice sites . ] with the quantity @xmath160 , one can define the additional hopping parameter , @xmath161 .",

    "[ fms ] , we show the map of the spectral density obtained by integration over the energy window of @xmath166 around the chemical potential .",
    "the orbits of strong intensity correspond to the fermi surfaces which are apparent not circles as compared with those from the simplified dirac cone model .",
    "the structure of the fermi surfaces is symmetrical under any rotation of angle @xmath167 around the origin .",
    "all these results are comparable with the arpes experimental observations.@xcite for @xmath162=0.0 , we expect that the fermi surfaces in fig .",
    "[ fms ] shrink into dirac points .",
    "the broadening of energy distribution of quasiparticle is described by the imaginary part of the self - energy . to be specific ,",
    "we analyze the green function @xmath168 .",

    "the value at @xmath179 = 0 is very small and should vanish at zero temperature . at a region of larger energy",

    "the magnitude of @xmath182 is , however , small compared with @xmath181 .",
    "the reason is clear . at the fermi surface ,",
    "the states of energy @xmath179 is far from the corresponding states of the same momentum @xmath62 at the lower band .",

    "[ se02 ] , the rpa result for the self - energy of upper band is also shown for comparison . the magnitude of @xmath184 by rpa is larger than that by the rrda .",

    "each fermi surface is a dirac point in this case , the fermi momentum for fig .",
    "[ se0 ] is chosen as @xmath185 .",
    "firstly , at the dirac point , because the state is the common state of the upper and lower bands , the self - energies of both bands coincide . at small energy ,",
    "apart from a small value at @xmath179 = 0 due to the finite temperature effect , all the results for @xmath184 show a quadratic dependence on @xmath179 .",
    "out of the small energy region , @xmath184 linearly depends on @xmath179 to certain limit . for the purpose of comparison ,",

    ", our numerical results based on the rrda demonstrate that the imaginary parts of the self - energies fixed at the fermi momentum are always varying as quadratic in energy close to the fermi level , regardless the system is doped or not doped .",

    "this results in lowering the density of states and smearing the peaks . with comparing to @xmath191 , the two peaks in @xmath190 shift to larger energy because of the energy band enlarged by the exchange interaction .",
    "we next consider the distribution function @xmath193 .",
    "for the graphene , @xmath193 should be defined as @xmath194 as we have encountered in eq .",
    "( [ spect ] ) , @xmath193 is determined only by @xmath195 .",
    "further more , since the green function @xmath195 can be divided into parts of the upper and lower bands , we therefore define the distribution functions for these two bands as @xmath196 the total distribution function is given by @xmath197 . in fig .",

    "the distribution @xmath199 drops drastically at the fermi surface .",
    "the occupation at the lower band is not flat .",
    "close to each dirac point ( the corner of the hexagon brillouin zone ) , the behavior of @xmath200 looks like a sink .",
    "the depression of @xmath200 comes from two aspects .",
    "one is the temperature effect .",
    "the distribution @xmath200 reaches its minimum at the dirac points because where the energy ( dirac energy ) is the highest for states in the lower band .",
    "since the doping concentration is small , the dirac energy is close to the fermi level .",
    "therefore , @xmath200 has an apparent drop at the dirac points .",
    "another reason is due to the many - body effect .",
    "because of the coulomb interaction , an amount of electrons can be redistributed from the lower band to upper band .    at zero doping , each fermi surface shrinks to a point .",
    "the distribution functions are shown in fig .",
    "[ dist2 ] .",
    "the distribution @xmath201 at upper band concentrates at the dirac points . at lower band",
    ", there is a obvious depression of @xmath200 at the point .",
    "to see the many - body and temperature effects in the zero - doping case , we show the total distribution @xmath193 at and close to the dirac points as functions of temperature .",
    "very close to the dirac points , @xmath193 increases drastically with decreasing temperature . at zero temperature",
    ", the total distribution at the dirac points @xmath202 can be expected .",
    "this is very different from the non - interacting distribution .",
    "the latter is constant 1 because the zero - energy levels of both bands are half occupied and at the momentum different from the dirac points only the lower band is fully occupied . under the coulomb interactions ,",
    "some of the electrons around each dirac point in the lower band are gathered to the upper band close to the dirac point , resulting in a higher distribution at and close to the point . from the increasing tendencies of @xmath203 and @xmath204",
    ", we can infer there is an abrupt drop in @xmath193 close to each dirac point .",
    "therefore , the zero - doping distribution function at zero temperature is consistent with the fermi liquid behavior .    for the negative doping ,",
    "the fermi surface opens again . in this case , the fermi level is at the lower band .",
    "since the upper and lower bands are symmetric about the zero energy , at zero temperature , the electron distribution at the upper band corresponds to the hole distribution at the lower band , and vice versa .",
    "therefore , the distributions at negative doping can be obtained from that of positive doping .",
    "for example , at @xmath162 = -0.02 , by flipping fig .",
    "[ dist1 ] upside down , we obtain the image of distributions .",
    "the shape of each fermi surface is the same as that at @xmath162 = 0.02 .",
    "however , the fermi area is outside of the surface where the lower band is near fully occupied .",
    "finally , we give the ground - state energy per electron @xmath205 . at low temperatures , @xmath206 ,",
    "the numerical results for the energy per electron are almost a constant . by extrapolation ,",
    "we then obtain @xmath205 .",
    "the results for the two doping cases are , @xmath207 for @xmath208 , and @xmath209 for @xmath210 .",
    "in summary , using the tight - binding model with long - range coulomb interactions defined in a honeycomb lattice , we have presented the green - function formulation for the electron in graphene .",
    "the interactions between electrons are treated with the renormalized - ring - diagram approximation .",
    "the integral equations for determining the green function are solved self - consistently using our high - efficiency numerical algorithm .",
    "the obtained spectral densities are comparable with the experimental observations .",
    "since the imaginary part of the self - energy of the electron green function fixed at the fermi momentum varies as quadratic in energy near the chemical potential for both doped and undoped systems , we conclude that electrons in graphene follow the fermi liquid like behavior .",
    "in addition , we also calculated the density of states and the distribution functions .      in this appendix",
    ", we present the fourier transform of the coulomb interaction between electrons on the honeycomb lattice .",
    "because it is long - range interaction , the accurate result can not be obtained from the direct summation by definition with numerical calculation .",
    "we must seek a fast converging scheme for summation over the lattice sites . to do this , we separate the interaction @xmath211 into short - range and long - range parts , @xmath212 with @xmath213 where @xmath1 is a free parameter of positive quantity , and @xmath214 . at @xmath215 , @xmath216 , therefore it is a short - range interaction .",
    "its fourier transform can be obtained by the direct summation , @xmath217 on the other hand , @xmath218 is long ranged .",
    "direct summation for the fourier transform of it converges very slow .",
    "however , this function can be expressed as @xmath219 where the @xmath18-integral is over the whole momentum space , and @xmath220 the integral in eq .",
    "( [ vl ] ) can be written in a summation over the integrals each of them over a brillouin zone .",
    "shifting all these brillouin zones to the first brillouin zone by the corresponding reciprocal lattice vectors @xmath221 s , we have @xmath222 the order of integral and summation can be changed .",
    "express @xmath31 as @xmath223 where @xmath224 is the position of @xmath48-th unit cell of the honeycomb lattice , and @xmath225 is a vector within the unit cell .",
    "we get @xmath226 where use of @xmath227 has been made . from this equation",
    ", we recognize the fourier transform of the function @xmath228 defined on the honeycomb lattice with @xmath225 a parameter , @xmath229 where the factor @xmath230 comes from the ratio between the area of the first brillouin zone of the honeycomb lattice and that of the square lattice @xmath231 .",
    "since @xmath232 decreases exponentially at large @xmath233 , the @xmath234-summation converges very fast .",
    "we are now ready to express the elements of the interaction matrix @xmath235 . with the above functions , we have @xmath236 where @xmath237 maps the vector @xmath19 under the basis @xmath238 into the one in the orthogonal coordinate system .    for doing numerical calculation , it is necessary to understand the symmetry of the green function .",
    "we start the discussion with the definition of the green function in real space , @xmath239 which describes a particle of spin-@xmath46 propagating from position @xmath70 to @xmath69 .",
    "firstly , this function has the following property , @xmath240 because that the configuration for a particle propagating from @xmath70 to @xmath69 is the same as in the inverse process .",
    "therefore , the diagonal green functions are even under @xmath241 . denoting @xmath242",
    ", we obtain @xmath243 on the other hand , for the off - diagonal part , we get @xmath244 though the off - diagonal green functions have no definite parity , they can be separated into even and odd functions . for @xmath245 , we have @xmath246 where @xmath247 and @xmath248 are even and odd functions of @xmath249 , respectively .",
    "now , we can express the green function matrix in terms of pauli matrix , @xmath250 where the pauli components as functions of @xmath249 have their definite parities .",
    "obviously , in momentum space , as functions of @xmath62 , they have the same parities . using the property of parity ,",
    "the fourier expansions of these components are given by @xmath251 where the @xmath62-integrals are over the half brillouin zone : @xmath252 and @xmath253 .",
    "further more , in the half brillouin zone , we can separate the green functions @xmath254 s into even and odd functions of @xmath61 , @xmath255 with the superscripts @xmath256 denoting the parities , @xmath257/2.\\ ] ] correspondingly , in real space , @xmath258 s are separated into even and odd functions of @xmath259 .",
    "we have @xmath260 where the @xmath62-integrals are now over the first quadrant of the first brillouin zone : @xmath252 and @xmath261 .",
    "we next consider the property of the green functions under the exchange of the coordinates @xmath262 . since the system is symmetric under this exchange , we have @xmath263 from the above definitions",
    ", one can obtain that the pauli components @xmath264 are symmetric about the exchange but @xmath265          for the readers convenience , we here give an example for calculation of @xmath267 .",
    "for the briefness , we present only the result for @xmath268 .",
    "the results for other elements and the method for calculation of the self - energy elements @xmath269 can be obtained immediately with the same consideration .",
    "as has been mentioned in the main text , the momentum convolution of two green functions in @xmath270 can be evaluated by fourier transform . in real space , it is given by @xmath271 where the @xmath234-summation for the matsubara frequencies is over @xmath272 .",
    "using the property of the green function , @xmath273 , we take the summation only for @xmath274 , @xmath275}_{n=1}g_0(\\vec r , i\\omega_m - i\\omega_n)g_0(\\vec r ,-",
