    "non perturbative tools and in particular lattice qcd can eventually provide the required precision . in this letter",
    "we address the determination at finite momentum transfer of the form factor that enters in the semileptonic heavy meson decay rate . in the infinite quark mass limit",
    "it is parametrized by the isgur - wise function  @xcite . in particular",
    ", we calculate the matrix elements entering the determination of @xmath2 .",
    "the calculation that we present misses the effects of dynamical fermions and is not the final one .",
    "nevertheless , it accomplishes for the first time the calculation at finite momentum transfer and at the physical values of the heavy quark masses , allowing to compare experimental data without additional model dependent extrapolations .",
    "we use a method  @xcite already applied successfully to the determination of heavy quark masses and decay constants  @xcite , called the step scaling method ( ssm ) , and special boundary conditions , called flavour twisted  @xcite , that shift by an arbitrary amount the discretized set of lattice momenta ( see also  @xcite ) .",
    "the step scaling method allows to reconcile large quark masses with adequate lattice resolution and large physical volumes ; the flavour twisted boundary conditions allow to perform a calculation at non zero momentum transfer with good accuracy .",
    "we present the main results of our computation and stress their phenomenological implications ; a more detailed discussion on technical aspects will be presented elsewhere  @xcite .",
    "the semileptonic decay of a pseudoscalar meson into another pseudoscalar meson is mediated by the vector part of the weak @xmath3 current .",
    "the corresponding matrix element can be parametrized in terms of two form factors . among possible parametrizations we chose the following one @xmath4 where @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the meson masses and @xmath7-velocities .",
    "the form factors depend upon the masses of the initial and final particles and upon @xmath8 @xmath9 in the case where @xmath10 is the @xmath11 meson mass and @xmath12 is the @xmath13 meson mass the maximum value of @xmath14 is around @xmath15 . in the infinite mass limit",

    "the function @xmath1 , @xmath23 is needed in order to extract @xmath2 by the measurement of the decay rate .",
    "previous lattice calculations by the fermilab collaboration  @xcite quote the value of @xmath1 only at zero recoil where it can be extracted with good statistical accuracy by using the so called `` double ratio '' technique . in the following we calculate @xmath1 in the range @xmath24 that includes values of @xmath14 where experimental data are available .",
    "we have carried out the calculation within the @xmath25 improved schrdinger functional formalism  @xcite with @xmath26 and vanishing background fields . in order to fix the notations ,",

    "for the heavy flavours ; in particular we have used @xmath40 leading to @xmath41 and ordinary periodic b.c . in the other spatial directions and for the light quarks .",

    "this definition of @xmath14 is noisier than the one that can be obtained in terms of ratios of two point correlation functions ; however it leads to exact vector current conservation when @xmath55 and reduces the final statistical error on the form factors .",

    "we consider the form factor @xmath56 as a function of @xmath14 , the volume , @xmath69 , and identify heavy meson states by the corresponding rgi quark masses that in the infinite volume limit lead to the physical meson spectrum  @xcite ; the rgi quark masses are measured by the lattice version of the pcac relation and are not affected by finite volume effects ( see  @xcite for further details ) .",

    "the physical value @xmath75 is obtained by a smooth extrapolation in @xmath76 that relies on the hqet expectations and upon the general idea that finite volume effects , measured by the @xmath77 s , are almost insensitive to the high energy scale .",

    ". moreover , finite volume effects are already very small at @xmath85  fm , in particular at zero recoil .",
    "we present results already extrapolated to the chiral and continuum limits .",
    "we have simulated three different lattices for @xmath71 and two for the other volumes ( see table  [ tab : sims ] ) observing small @xmath25 effects on the form factor and on the step scaling functions .",
    "further details on the continuum extrapolations will be given in ref .",
    "@xcite . concerning the chiral behaviour",
    ", our results do not show any sizable dependence upon the light quark mass , as shown in figure  [ fig : chiral ] for @xmath70 .",
    "the same feature is observed for all the combinations of heavy quark masses and on all the volumes that we have simulated .",
    "nevertheless we make a linear extrapolation to reach the chiral limit ; the resulting error largely accounts for the systematics due to these extrapolations .    as discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : notations ] , we used two definitions of the form factor that , at finite volume , differ by the finite volume effects . a check of the convergence of our ssm can be obtained by comparing these two definitions on the smallest volume ( figure  [ fig:2defs ] upper plot ) and on the largest one ( figure  [ fig:2defs ] lower plot ) . we see that , while the small volume results differ , the final ones converge to a common value giving us confidence of a correct accounting of finite volume effects .",
