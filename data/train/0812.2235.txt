    "recent developments around three - body systems with two mesons and one baryon using chiral dynamics have brought new light into the nature of the @xmath13 baryonic resonances .",
    "the study of such systems with strangeness @xmath14 produced resonant states which could be identified with the existing low lying baryonic @xmath13 resonances , two @xmath15 and four @xmath16 states @xcite . similarly , in the case of the @xmath17 sector the @xmath3 appears neatly as a resonance of the @xmath18 system , with or without including its coupled channels within su(3 ) @xcite .",
    "developments along the same direction produced a resonant state of @xmath19 @xcite which could be identified with the x(2175 ) resonance reported at babar @xcite and later on at bes @xcite .",
    "the study of the three - body systems was done using faddeev equations ( fe ) in the coupled channel approach .",
    "while most conventional studies of three - body systems use potentials in coordinate space , usually separable potentials to make the solution of the fe feasible , the approach of @xcite used two particle amplitudes generated within the unitary chiral approach in momentum space .",
    "yet , the most novel finding in these works was the realization that , for s - waves and in the su(3 ) limit , there was an exact cancellation between the off shell part of the two - body amplitudes and the three - body forces generated by the same chiral lagrangians . to be more precise",
    ", the on shell amplitude means that the s - wave amplitude is calculated as a function of the mandelstam variable @xmath20 imposing @xmath21 for the external momenta of the two body amplitudes .",
    "when these lines are inside the faddeev diagrams where some line can be off shell , the full amplitude is separated into this  on shell \" part plus and  off shell \" part which goes as @xmath22 for mesons and @xmath23 for baryons and vanishes when the external lines are on shell .",
    "this off shell part contains an inverse particle propagator and cancels one particle propagator rendering a faddeev diagram with two two - body t - matrices into a three - body contact term , which has the same topology as genuine three - body interactions that stem from the chiral lagrangians and cancel them exactly . as a consequence",
    ", one needs only the on shell two - body t - matrices and can ignore these three - body forces .",
    "this finding is novel for such studies and simplifies the work technically , although not much , since loops involve a changing s - variable , and consequently the s - dependent t - matrices must be inserted into the loop functions .",
    "this makes this approach different and technically more involved than the study of the two body interaction , where using arguments of the n / d method one can factorize on shell amplitudes outside the loop functions which involve only two hadron propagators @xcite .",
    "the strongest value of that finding in the three - body problem is that the results do not depend upon the off shell extrapolations of the amplitudes which is a source of uncertainty in the three - body calculations that rely upon a potential .",
    "indeed , it is well known that given a certain physical amplitude , on shell by nature , one has an infinite number of potentials that give this amplitude upon solving the schrdinger equation .",
    "the differences between the different potentials will only show in the off shell extrapolation of the amplitudes .",
    "however , this information enters the solution of the faddeev equations and , hence , different potentials leading to the same on shell amplitude will provide different results upon solution of the faddeev equations .",
    "the problem stated above is most probably the main reason why recent works dealing with the @xmath24 system lead to quite different results in the binding and the width . in this sense",
    ", we find a series of works based on faddeev equations which lead to relatively large binding , of the order of @xmath25 mev @xcite , while other works based on variational methods lead to smaller bindings of the order of 20 - 30 mev @xcite .",
    "the widths also vary from @xmath26 mev .",
    "the arbitrariness of the off shell amplitude is also well known in field theory , where the implementation of unitary transformations of the fields in the lagrangian maintains the same on shell amplitudes but changes their off shell extrapolation . in this sense",
    "it is interesting to note that , although the off shell versus three - body cancellation discussed here is not explicitly shown in other three - body works using also chiral dynamics @xcite , the approach is invariant upon these transformations , indicating that the mentioned cancellations apparently occur in the full calculation @xcite .",
    "a similar independence on the off shell extrapolation has been shown in different reactions like the @xmath27 reaction @xcite and the study of the interacting two pion exchange in the @xmath28 interaction @xcite .",
    "however , the explicit realization of the off shell versus three - body forces indicates that one can neglect the three - body forces from the beginning , certainly simplifying the approach , and use only the two - body on shell amplitudes .",
    "even more , these on shell amplitudes can be obtained from experiment and one can omit having to do a theory for the two - body interaction .",
    "there is a small caveat there , since sometimes in the loops one will need  on shell \" amplitudes below threshold .",
    "this looks like a contradiction , but we made it clear the meaning on the on shell amplitude needed in the faddeev equations , which is the one where @xmath21 for the external momenta .",
    "provided one has a suitable parameterization of the amplitude , the extrapolation below threshold fulfilling this condition is not a difficult task to accomplish . in many cases , like in the present one that we shall discuss here",
    ", one needs the information well within the physical range and the extrapolation is not even needed .",
    "this picture presented here is rather novel and the purpose of the present paper is to show how it works and how it can help whenever the theoretical models are not accurate enough .    with the perspective given above we shall tackle here the investigation of three - body systems with two mesons and a baryon with strangeness @xmath17 .",
    "the problem was already discussed in @xcite , where the @xmath3 was found as a resonant state of @xmath18 .",
    "it was also found there that the implementation of other coupled channels barely changed the results obtained with the base of the @xmath18 states alone .",
    "yet , there are other @xmath29 states , like the @xmath30 and the @xmath31 , which do not appear with that base and the use of the amplitudes obtained with the lowest order chiral lagrangians . from the work of @xcite",
    "we know that the chiral unitary approach using the lowest order chiral lagrangian provides a fair amplitude up to @xmath32 but fails beyond this energy .",
    "for instance , the @xmath33 does not appear in the approach . as a consequence , any three - body states which would choose to cluster a @xmath2 subsystem into this resonance",
    "would not be obtained in the approach of @xcite . in the present work",
    "we shall give the step to use experimental @xmath2 amplitudes and will show that in this case we reproduce the @xmath3 resonance without practically any modification with respect to @xcite , but the use of a more realistic @xmath2 interaction at higher energies leads also to the generation of the @xmath30 and the @xmath31 resonances as three - body systems of two mesons and one baryon in coupled channels .",
    "we follow the method developed in @xcite to calculate the three - body @xmath34-matrix and search for resonances . in @xcite",
    "a coupled channel bethe - salpeter equation is solved to calculate the required two - body @xmath1-matrices with the potentials obtained from chiral lagrangians .",

( [ eq : f ] ) the @xmath68 superindex on @xmath69 indicates that the definition of this invariant mass depends on the loop variable .",

    "the present work benefits from the previous study of the @xmath0 system and coupled channels @xcite , where the dynamical generation of the @xmath3 was found .",
    "this state was found when the total isospin @xmath9 three - body @xmath34-matrix was evaluated by adding a nucleon to the two pions interacting in isospin zero in the energy range of the @xmath71-resonance .",
    "the @xmath3 was thus interpreted as a resonance in the @xmath0 system , where the two pions rearrange to form the @xmath71-resonance .",
    "the total energy range studied in @xcite corresponded to a variation of the invariant masses of the @xmath2 pairs up to @xmath72 1550 mev .",

    "we use the relations @xmath85    using these @xmath2 @xmath1-matrices as input for eqs .",
    "( [ fa ] ) , we can extend the model for the @xmath0 interaction of @xcite to higher energies where the invariant masses of the @xmath2 subsystems can be varied around @xmath86 mev .    at this point",
    "we would like to discuss the cancellation between the off - shell part of the @xmath1-matrices in the faddeev equations and the three - body forces , which justifies the use of the experimental amplitudes in our approach .",
    "these cancellations have been illustrated in all detail in the appendix of @xcite for the systems of two mesons and one baryon and in the appendix of @xcite for the one vector - two pseudoscalar systems .",
    "the proof proceeded taking the potentials ( tree level amplitudes ) derived from the lowest order chiral lagrangians .",
    "the extention of the proof made in the appendices of @xcite to the corresponding one using @xmath1-matrices is straight forward , since the @xmath1-matrices would be generated by further iterations of the tree level amplitudes in the faddeev diagrams , as done in @xcite , where the off - shell part of the potential in these iterations is reabsorbed in constants of the on - shell potential .",
    "hence the cancellations are guaranteed when iterations are done to obtain faddeev diagrams in terms of @xmath1-matrices rather than potentials .",
    "this was discussed in @xcite .",
    "one could wonder if such a cancellation would also occur in those cases where the higher order terms of the lagrangian would be necessary .",
    "technically our assertion , that one can use only the on - shell amplitudes , is rigorous as long as the amplitudes obtained with the lowest order chiral lagrangian , upon unitarization , can reproduce the experimental data .",
    "this seems to be the case , for example , in s=-1 systems , for the energy range considered here .",
    "indeed , calculations done in @xcite using higher order terms of the lagrangians show that the results obtained by using the lowest order lagrangian fall well within the accepted uncertainties in the model . the situation is different for @xmath17 , since , as mentioned in the introduction , the results of the calculations done with the lowest order chiral lagrangian already fail beyond the total energy of 1600 mev of the @xmath2 system",
    ". thus we could formally make no claims in this region about cancellations between the off - shell part of the @xmath87-matrices and the three - body forces .",
    "however , we also insist on the fact that the results can not depend on the off - shell part of the amplitudes , because these are unphysical .",
    "the finding of the exact cancellation of the off - shell part with the three - body forces is very useful because it implies that the faddeev equations can be solved using only the physical information , that is the on - shell amplitudes .",
    "this feature certainly must sustain even when one goes beyond that realm where the lowest order chiral lagrangian reproduces the experimental data",
    ". it would be interesting to study cancellations similar to those found in @xcite for the present case by using higher order lagrangians but this is beyond the scope of the present work",
    ".    it should be also said , when using higher order terms in the lagrangians , that although the elimination of the off - shell ( unphysical ) part is guaranteed , because the results can not depend on unphysical amplitudes , it is not clear that the cancellation mentioned above would not leave some finite remanent part .",
    "it is also not guaranteed that , apart from three - body forces originating from the chiral lagrangians , there are no other genuine three - body forces which would remain after necessary cancellations of off - shell terms .",
    "however , let us make the following observation .",
    "we used a theory suited to the study of the @xmath0 system up to @xmath88 mev and concluded that one can study the system using only on - shell amplitudes , which one can get from experiments .",
    "although proved within a certain theory , the conclusion that `` one can solve faddeev equations with experimental amplitudes '' is not linked to any model . with this in mind",
    "we make an ansatz that this conclusion should not be linked to the theory used to prove it and should be a characteristic of the dynamics of these systems for a wider range of energies than the one where we could establish a proof based on a particular theoretical framework .",
    "afterall we will only extend our region of energies up to @xmath89 2200 mev which is not too far from the energies at which the calculations were made earlier . although certainly it is an ansatz at these higher energies , a posteriori , our assumption that one can rely solely upon the on - shell amplitudes in the faddeev approach gets a strong support from the results that we obtain in the present work .",
    "we first study the @xmath0 system with total charge zero considering @xmath90 , @xmath91 , @xmath92 , @xmath93 and @xmath94 as coupled channels .",
    "we label them as particle @xmath95 , @xmath64 and @xmath65 in the order in which they are written above .",
    "we calculate the three - body @xmath96 matrices ( eqs .",
    "( [ fa ] ) ) by using , for the @xmath2 interaction : ( a ) experimental amplitudes , i.e. , eq .",
    "( [ texp ] ) with the phase shifts and inelasticities shown in figs .",

    ", we obtain the total @xmath103-matrix defined as @xmath104 ( see @xcite for this definition ) . in order to identify the nature of the resulting states , we project the @xmath103-matrix on the isospin base .",
    "an appropriate base is the one where the states are classified by the total isospin of the three particles `` @xmath105 '' and the total isospin of a subsystem `` @xmath106 '' .",
    "we thus label the states in the isospin base as @xmath107 .",
    "obviously transitions between states with same total isospin but different isospin of a subsystem are possible .",
    "the peaks in the amplitudes are nevertheless seen more clearly for some particular isospin of the subsystem , indicating that the dominant structure of the state found in the three - body system has a certain value of the total isospin and that of the isospin of a subsystem .",
    "we can thus write our @xmath103-matrix in the isospin base , in general , as @xmath108 .    in order to be consistent with our previous work @xcite , we first check if we find an evidence for the @xmath109 . for this , we obtain the amplitude for total isospin of the three particles @xmath105=1/2 and for the isospin of the @xmath97 subsystem , denoted by @xmath110 , being equal to zero , i.e. , we calculate @xmath111 ( see eqs .",

    "[ n_1910 ] for the @xmath149 channel .     in the @xmath157 channels .",
    "]    this state is about @xmath179 mev below the @xmath149 threshold ( assuming an average mass for the kaons of @xmath180 mev and @xmath181 mev for the nucleon ) .",
    "therefore , this result indicates that the @xmath155 system gets bound at around @xmath10 mev .",
    "this possibility has been already suggested by the authors in @xcite , in which they study the @xmath149 channel using effective two - body potentials to describe the @xmath182 , @xmath183 , @xmath184 interactions .",
    "they find that the @xmath149 system can get bound while the @xmath159 subsystem acts like the @xmath185 .",
    "our result is , thus , in agreement with the suggestions in @xcite .",
    "interestingly , the existence of a @xmath186 @xmath120 resonance around @xmath187 mev has also been proposed earlier @xcite on the basis of a study of the data on the @xmath188 reaction in an isobar model , although other theories @xcite which include explicitly resonances up to @xmath189 mev can reproduce these data ( though further work along these lines to include higher mass resonances is under way @xcite ) .",
    "since this peak found at @xmath10 mev is below the three - body threshold and , in the two - body problem , the poles for the @xmath160 and @xmath162 appear below the @xmath159 threshold , the three particles in the system have associated complex momenta in the momentum representation . to avoid the use of unphysical complex momenta in the three - body system , which will lead to imaginary energies in the real plane , we give a minimum value , around 50 mev , to the momentum of the particles .",
    "we have check the sensitivity of our results to the mentioned choice by changing the minimum momentum from 50 mev to 100 mev and we find the peak and width to remain almost unchanged .",
    "we also made the total isospin @xmath9 combination of the @xmath173 system by considering the @xmath174 subsystem in isospin 0 in the initial and the final state , i.e. , considering the @xmath190 component of the @xmath173 channel . in this case too , just as in the amplitude for @xmath11 , we find a peak around @xmath191 mev with a width of @xmath192 mev and another one around @xmath193 mev with a width of @xmath194 mev .",
    "the magnitude of the @xmath190 amplitude around @xmath10 mev is very similar to the one of the @xmath155 amplitude ( i.e. , the one shown in fig . [ n_1910 ] ) , but the magnitude of @xmath190 amplitude around 2050 mev is bigger than the magnitude of the @xmath155 amplitude .    from the whole study we would conclude that there are two @xmath120 s with @xmath4 in the energy region @xmath195 mev .",
    "the peaks obtained in this approach are very neat and we associate them to physical resonance states . in the two body scattering it is customary to look for poles in the second riemann sheet to associate them to resonances .",
    "the issue of poles for the three body problem within our formalism was addressed in the section vi of @xcite .",
    "the difficulty to work with two complex variables , @xmath63 and @xmath196 which induce complex three momenta needed in the evaluation of integrals are obvious . yet , in @xcite an approximate method was devised , which is suitable for the present context too , for the case when a subsystem of two particles can be treated as a resonance . therefore the three - body system can be interpreted as a system of a particle and a resonance .",
    "this was the case for @xmath197 in @xcite and the systems where resonances have been found in the present work can be treated similarly , for example , the @xmath157 system where a resonance around 1920 mev is found can be treated as a @xmath198 system .",
    "in such cases , the problem can be reduced to a two - body scattering and usual poles can be identified in the complex energy ( @xmath63 ) plane . in as much as the resonances found here",
    "follow an approximate breit - wigner shape , as in @xcite , the poles in the second riemann sheet are guaranteed , as was shown in @xcite .",
    "the amplitudes obtained in the present case indeed follow approximate breit - wigner distributions , and as in @xcite , they should have the corresponding poles in the @xmath63 complex plane .",
    "to summarize , we have extended our previous study of the @xmath0 system and coupled channels @xcite , where the generation of the @xmath3 was found , to higher energies . in this work the new input is the experimental data on the @xmath2 interaction where the information on excitation of both the @xmath73 and the @xmath33 is present , the latter of which was absent in our previous work @xcite . here ,",
    "apart from confirming the @xmath3 , we find evidence for the other @xmath186 @xmath120 , i.e. , the @xmath30 , and also for the @xmath186 @xmath8 resonance .",
    "the findings reported here indicate that the inclusion of the @xmath33 in the interaction of the @xmath2 subsystem is essential to generate these higher mass @xmath186 resonances .",
    "we have first made a search taking only the @xmath0 channels where a resonance having the properties of @xmath30 was found .",
    "later we included the @xmath121 , @xmath122 and @xmath199 channels where the same resonance is produced but with larger magnitude and narrower width , indicating the addition of more channels to which the resonance couples strongly .",
    "no isospin @xmath74 resonances is found in the study of the @xmath0 channels alone .",
    "however , the @xmath31 is found on inclusion of the @xmath121 , @xmath122 and @xmath199 channels .",
    "further , we have investigated the @xmath149 , @xmath148 and @xmath150 channels where the @xmath200 subsystem rearranges itself as a @xmath160 resonance , while @xmath201 acts like the @xmath162 .",
    "we obtain a new peak at @xmath202 mev , apart from the one corresponding to the @xmath30 , with a strong coupling to @xmath155 and @xmath190 .",
    "finally , we conclude this work by stating that the study of three - body systems , for the cases where a complete theoretical two - body input is not available , is also possible in our formalism using on shell experimental amplitudes .",
