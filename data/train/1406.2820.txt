    "this paper stems from two research lines which blend in the effective solution of certain eigenproblems for companion  like matrices arising in polynomial rootfinding .",
    "the first one begins with the exploitation of the structure of companion - like matrices under the qr eigenvalue algorithm .",
    "in the recent years based on the concept of rank structure many authors have provided fast adaptations of the qr iteration applied to small rank modifications of hermitian or unitary matrices . however , despite the common framework , there are several significant differences between the hermitian and the unitary case which makes the latter much more involved computationally .",
    "the second line originates from the treatment of the unitary eigenproblem .",
    "it has been observed in the seminal paper @xcite that the cmv - like banded form of a unitary matrix rather than its hessenberg reduction leads to a qr  type algorithm which is ideally close to the hermitian tridiagonal qr algorithm as it maintains the band shape of the initial matrix at any step .",
    "the present work lies at the intersection of these two strands and is specifically aimed to incorporate the cmv technology for the unitary eigenproblem in the design of fast qr  based eigensolvers for companion  like matrices .",
    "the first fast structured variant of the qr iteration for companion matrices was proposed in @xcite .",
    "the invariance of the rank properties of the matrices generated by the qr scheme is captured by means of three rank ",
    "one matrices which are easily updated under the iterative process .",
    "since the representation breaks down for reducible hessenberg matrices the price paid to keep the algorithm simple is a progressive deterioration in the limit of the accuracy of computed eigenvalues .",
    "overcoming this drawback is the main subject of many subsequents papers @xcite , where more refined parametrizations of the rank structure are employed .",
    "while this leads to numerically stable methods , it also opens the way to involved algorithms which exhibit worse timing performance and are difficult to generalize to the block matrix / pencil case .",
    "this is astonishingly unpleasant when compared with the simplicity and the effectiveness of adjusting the qr scheme for perturbed hermitian matrices @xcite .",
    "the approach pursued here moves away from the classical scenario where nonsymmetric matrices are converted in hessenberg form for eigenvalue computation , focusing instead on a preliminary reduction of a companion matrix @xmath0 into a different staircase form .",
    "more specifically , recall that @xmath0 can be expressed as a rank ",
    "one correction of a unitary matrix @xmath1 generating the circulant matrix algebra .",
    "the transformation of @xmath1 by unitary congruence into a cmv  like form @xcite induces a corresponding reduction of the matrix @xmath2 into an upper block hessenberg form with a certain specified staircase pattern .",
    "the cmv - like form of a unitary matrix is particularly suited for the application of the qr eigenvalue algorithm @xcite .",
    "the staircase shape also reveals invariance properties under the same algorithm @xcite .    from these properties",
    "it follows that the matrices generated by the shifted qr method applied to the transformed companion matrix inherit a simplified rank structure which can be expressed in terms of two rank  one matrices .",
    "this yields a data sparse parametrization of each matrix which at the same time is able to capture the structural properties of the matrix and yet to be very easy to manipulate and update for computations .",
    "we shall develop a fast adaptation of the qr eigenvalue algorithm for companion matrices that exploits this parametrization and requires @xmath3 arithmetic operations per step .",
    "the main complexity of the algorithm lies in updating the narrow diagonal staircase of each matrix .",
    "the results from numerical experiments indicate that the proposed approach works stable and efficient .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2 ,",
    "we first recall some preliminaries about cmv  like representations of unitary matrices and then introduce the considered reduction of a companion matrix .",
    "the structural properties of the modified matrix under the shifted qr iteration are analyzed in section 3 . in section 4",
    "we present our fast adaptation of the shifted qr algorithm for companion matrices and report the results of numerical experiments . finally , in section 5 the conclusion and further developments are drawn .",
    "for a given pair @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 , we set @xmath7 \\oplus i_{n - k-1 } \\in \\mathbb c^{n\\times n},\\ ] ] where @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "similarly , if @xmath10 then denote @xmath11 observe that @xmath12 , @xmath13 , is a unitary matrix . given coefficients @xmath14 and @xmath15 we introduce the unitary block diagonal matrices @xmath16 and define @xmath17 as the cmv matrix associated with the prescribed coefficient list @xcite . the decomposition of a unitary matrix",
    "was first investigated for eigenvalue computation in @xcite .",
    "the staircase shape of cmv matrices is analyzed in @xcite where the next definition is given .",
    "a matrix @xmath0 has cmv shape if the possibly nonzero entries exhibit the following pattern where @xmath18 denotes a positive entry : @xmath19 , \\quad",
    "\\quad   ( n=2k),\\ ] ] or @xmath20 , \\quad   \\quad ( n=2k-1).\\ ] ] obviously , cmv matrices have a cmv shape and , conversely , a unitary matrix with cmv shape is cmv @xcite . by skipping the positivity condition in @xcite the fairly more general class of cmv  like shaped matrices",
    "is considered . there",
    "it is shown that the block lanczos method can be used to reduce a unitary matrix into the direct sum of cmv  like shaped matrices .",
    "staircase matrix patterns can be exploited for eigenvalue computation @xcite .",
    "the shifted qr algorithm @xmath21 is the standard algorithm for computing the schur form of a general matrix @xmath22 @xcite .",
    "the matrix @xmath2 is said to be staircase if @xmath23 , @xmath24 , where @xmath25 the staircase form is preserved under the qr iteration in the sense that @xcite @xmath26 for hermitian and unitary matrices the staircase form also implies a zero pattern or a rank structure in the upper triangular part .",
    "the invariance of this pattern by the qr algorithm is proved in @xcite for hermitian matrices and in @xcite for unitary cmv  shaped matrices .",
    "an alternative proof for the unitary case that is suitable for generalizations is given in @xcite by relying upon the classical nullity theorem @xcite .",
    "[ nullycons ] suppose @xmath0 is a nonsingular matrix and @xmath27 and @xmath28 to be nonempty proper subsets of @xmath29 .",
    "then @xmath30 where , as usual , @xmath31 denotes the cardinality of the set @xmath32 .",
    "the design of efficient numerical methods for eigenvalue computation of almost hermitian and unitary matrices has recently attracted a lot of attention ( see @xcite and the references given therein ) .",
    "a motivating application is given by matrix methods for polynomial rootfinding . from a given @xmath33th degree",
    "polynomial @xmath34 we can set up the associated companion matrix @xmath35 in upper hessenberg form , @xmath36.\\ ] ] as @xmath37 is satisfied , thus we can obtain approximations of the zeros of @xmath38 by applying a standard eigenvalue method to the associated companion matrix @xmath39 .",
    "this is exactly the approach taken by the matlab function roots .    in the recent years many fast adaptations of the qr iteration applied to an initial companion matrix @xmath40",
    "have been proposed @xcite , based on the decomposition of @xmath39 as a rank ",
    "one correction of a unitary matrix , that is , @xmath41 - \\left[\\begin{array}{c } 1\\\\0\\\\\\vdots\\\\0 \\end{array}\\right]\\left[\\displaystyle\\frac{p_{n-1}}{p_n } ,   \\displaystyle\\frac{p_{n-2}}{p_n},\\ldots,\\displaystyle\\frac{p_{0}}{p_n}+1\\right].\\ ] ] in this paper we further elaborate on this decomposition by developing a different structured representation .",
    "let @xmath42 , @xmath43 be the permutation matrix associated with the permutation given by @xmath44 then it can be easily verified that the matrix @xmath45 is a cmv  like shaped matrix . indeed , we have that the nonzero entries of @xmath46 are precisely @xmath47 , @xmath48 and those of the form @xmath49 and @xmath50 for @xmath51 .",
    "for instance in the case @xmath52 the nonzero pattern looks as follows : @xmath53.\\ ] ] moreover , since @xmath54 it follows that , denoting by @xmath55 we have @xmath56 is a rank  one correction of a unitary cmv  like shaped matrix in staircase form . in the next section",
    "we investigate the properties of the shifted qr iteration applied to @xmath57 for the computation of the zeros of @xmath38 .",
    "to put our derivation on a firm theoretical ground , in this section we perform a thorough analysis of the structural properties of @xmath57 which are maintained under the shifted qr iteration .    [ rem1 ] several different properties can easily be checked by assuming that the matrix @xmath58 in and , hence , a fortiori @xmath59 is invertible .",
    "clearly , this might not always be the case but , however , it is well known that the one  parameter matrix function @xmath60 is analytic in @xmath61 and an analytic qr decomposition @xmath62 of this analytic matrix function exists @xcite . for any given",
    "fixed initial pair @xmath63 we can find a branch of the analytic qr decomposition of @xmath60 that passes through @xmath63 . following this path",
    "it makes it possible to extend the proof of the properties that are closed in the limit .",
    "this is for instance the case of the rank properties .",
    "it has already been noticed above that the staircase form of @xmath40 is preserved under the shifted qr iteration .",
    "this means that each unitary matrix @xmath64 is also in staircase form .",
    "in particular , if @xmath65 \\oplus i_{n - k-1 } \\in \\mathbb c^{n\\times n } , \\quad 1\\leq k\\leq n-1,\\ ] ] where @xmath66 and @xmath67 , denote generalized givens reflectors then the matrix @xmath68 can be expressed as @xmath69 where @xmath70 and @xmath71 for an even @xmath72 and @xmath73 if , otherwise , @xmath72 is odd .    since from @xmath74",
    "we find that @xmath75 where @xmath76 theorem   describes the structure of the unitary matrix @xmath77 , for any @xmath78 .",
    "we need the following result characterizing the structure of the @xmath79 factor appearing in the @xmath80 factorization of @xmath81 , @xmath78 .",
    "[ 0shift ] the unitary factor @xmath79 generated by means of a qr factorization of @xmath81 , @xmath82 , has both a lower and upper staircase profile .",
    "specifically , it holds @xmath83    it has already been observed that since the staircase form of @xmath84 is preserved under the shifted @xmath80 iteration  , the unitary factor @xmath79 , corresponding to the unitary matrix involved in a @xmath80 iteration without shift has a lower staircase profile . to prove that @xmath79 has also an upper staircase profile , observe that the matrix @xmath84 is such that @xmath85 , @xmath86 . from the argument stated in remark [ rem1 ]",
    "it follows that this rank constraint is preserved under the qr iteration and , specifically , we have @xmath87 , @xmath86 , for any @xmath82 . the same property is also inherited from the unitary factor @xmath68 generated by means of the qr factorization of @xmath81 , i.e. , @xmath88 . from theorem [ nullycons ]",
    "we obtain that @xmath89 hence , by combining the constraint @xmath90 with the staircase shape of @xmath79 one deduces that @xmath91 which implies @xmath92 equivalently , the relation says that @xmath93 is a zero matrix and this concludes the proof .",
    "lemma [ 0shift ] can be used to exploit the rank properties of the unitary matrices @xmath77 , @xmath82 .",
    "[ 1theo ] we have @xmath94 moreover , if @xmath84 is invertible then @xmath95 where @xmath96 is a rank one matrix .",
    "let @xmath97 be a qr factorization of the matrix @xmath81 assumed invertible .",
    "from @xmath98 we obtain that @xmath99 using the sherman ",
    "morrison formula @xcite yields @xmath100 which gives @xmath101 since @xmath102 is upper triangular we have that @xmath103 has the same upper staircase shape as @xmath79 and , therefore , from lemma [ 0shift ] we conclude that @xmath94 the argument stated in remark [ rem1 ] extends this property to a possibly singular @xmath84 and a fortiori @xmath81 , @xmath82 .    [ rem2 ] it is worth pointing out that although the rank structure of @xmath77 is closed in the limit its parametrization via generators is not @xcite .",
    "this means that the rank one representation of the entries of @xmath77 located in the upper triangular portion does not hold in the general case where the starting matrix @xmath84 can be singular .    from the previous theorem",
    "we derive a structural representation of each matrix @xmath81 , @xmath82 , generated under the qr process applied to @xmath57 given as in . in the next section we provide a fast adaptation of this process based on the relations , , and .",
    "in this section we devise a fast adaptation of the qr iteration applied to a starting invertible matrix @xmath104 given as in by using the structural properties described above .",
    "let us first observe that each matrix @xmath81 , @xmath82 , generated by can be represented by means of the following sparse data set of size @xmath3 :    1 .",
    "the nonzero entries of the banded matrix @xmath105 obtained from @xmath81 according to @xmath106 2 .",
    "the vectors @xmath107 and @xmath108 , and @xmath109 .",

    "the next procedure performs a structured variant of the qr iteration applied to an initial matrix @xmath104 given as in .",
    "the factored form of @xmath64 makes it possible to execute the steps @xmath116 and @xmath117 simultaneously by improving the efficiency of computation .",
    "the matrix @xmath81 is represented by means of four vectors and a diagonally structured matrix @xmath110 encompassing the band profile of @xmath81 .",
    "this matrix could be stored in a rectangular array but for the sake of simplicity in our implementation we adopt the matlab sparse matrix format . due to the occurrences of deflations",
    "the qr process is applied to a principal submatrix of @xmath81 starting at position @xmath118 and ending at position @xmath119 , where @xmath120 at beginning . at the core of @xmath121",
    "there is a structured adaptation of the qr iteration applied to @xmath122 .",
    "in particular , we compute the givens reflector @xmath123 of equation   based on the shit @xmath124 computed in step 1 , and we perform the similarity transformation @xmath125 this is done by using only the representation of @xmath126 , that is the portion of the four vectors @xmath127 , @xmath128 , @xmath129 , @xmath130 with indices between @xmath118 and @xmath119 and @xmath131 , and acting only on the first two rows and columns of them .",
    "then , defining @xmath132 the dimension of @xmath126 and for @xmath133 we compute the matrices @xmath134 as the unitary factor of a @xmath80 factorization of the @xmath135 diagonal blocks @xmath136 , and updating @xmath137 as follows @xmath138    as in equation  , the last unitary transformation @xmath139 is computed in a different way in the odd and in the even case .    despite the simplicity of this scheme we have to deal carefully with the representation of @xmath126 in order to update the banded matrix and the four generators .",
    "the computation of the shift @xmath124 at the first step of @xmath121 can be carried out by several strategies @xcite . in our implementation",
    "we employ the wilkinson idea by choosing as a shift one of the roots of the trailing 2-by-2 submatrix of @xmath140 ( the one closest to the final entry ) . for an input companion matrix expressed as a rank  one correction of a unitary cmv  like shaped matrix this technique ensures zero shifting at the early iterations .",
    "it has been observed experimentally that this fact is important for the correct fill in both in the rank  two structure in the upper triangular part and in the band profile of @xmath81 . incorporating the wilkinson shifting within the explicit shifted @xmath80 method @xmath141 and implementing a step of @xmath80 iteration on the representation as just described , yields our proposed fast cmv  based eigensolver for companion matrices .",
    "the algorithm has been implemented in matlab and tested on several examples .",
    "this implementation can be obtained from the authors upon request .    in order to check the accuracy of the output",
    "we compare the computed approximations with the ones returned by the internal function eig applied to the initial companion matrix @xmath142 without the balance option . specifically , we match the two lists of approximations and then find the average absolute error @xmath143 .    for a backward stable algorithm in the light of the classical perturbation results for eigenvalue computation",
