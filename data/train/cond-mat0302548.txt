    "measurement of conductance peak heights in a coulomb - blockaded quantum dot is one of few experimental tools to access properties of single - electron wavefunctions in quantum dots .",
    "experimentally , the probability distribution of the conductance peak heights in quantum dots with an irregular shape was found to be in good agreement with predictions from random - matrix theory ( rmt ) ,  @xcite both without magnetic field and in the presence of a time - reversal symmetry breaking magnetic field .",
    "@xcite according to random - matrix theory , wavefunctions in a chaotic quantum dot have a universal distribution , independent of details of the dot s shape or mean free path , and wavefunction elements are independently gaussian distributed real or complex numbers depending on the presence or absence of time - reversal symmetry , respectively .",
    "there are no long - range correlations within a chaotic wavefunction and no correlations between different wavefunctions .",
    "@xcite    it is known that non - universal correlations between different wavefunctions and , hence , correlations between conductance peak heights exist in both ballistic and diffusive dots .",
    "@xcite in ballistic quantum dots , such correlations are the result of wavefunction scarring ,  @xcite which causes a slow modulation of the variance @xmath0 and the position @xmath1 , although the rmt prediction for peak - height statistics remains valid for peaks at nearby energies .",
    "@xcite the scarring effect disappears in the limit of large quantum dots , and is absent in quantum dots with scatterers smaller than the fermi wavelength . in disordered quantum dots ( mean free path @xmath2 much smaller than dot size @xmath3 ) ,",
    "correlations between conductance peak heights are found to be of relative order @xmath4 ,  @xcite where @xmath5 is the thouless energy of the quantum dot and @xmath6 the mean level spacing .    here , we address two other mechanisms for peak - height correlations . on the one hand , we investigate correlations at a weak perpendicular magnetic field that only partially breaks time - reversal symmetry .",
    "these correlations follow from underlying correlations of wavefunctions , which were reported previously by waintal , sethna , and two of the authors .",
    "@xcite on the other hand , we also find correlations between peaks corresponding to different wavefunctions at two different values of a large magnetic field that fully breaks time - reversal symmetry .",
    "unlike the two other causes for peak - height correlations , the source of correlations under investigation in this paper is universal and survives in the limit of large quantum dots .",
    "furthermore , these correlations are not only of direct experimental relevance when coulomb - blockade peaks are measured as a function of an external magnetic field , but our results also pertain to the case of quantum dots with weak spin - orbit scattering .",
    "we elaborate on this aspect at the end of the paper .",
    "our paper is organized as follows : in section [ sec : model ] , we introduce the pandey - mehta hamiltonian , which is the rmt hamiltonian appropriate for our calculations .",
    "we then proceed in section [ sec : corr ] to formulate the problem in terms of orthogonal invariants of the pandey - mehta hamiltonian and derive a general expression for the wavefunction correlator distribution function .",
    "this result is employed to calculate the actual peak height correlator distribution function whose first moment is compared to numerical rmt simulations , both for the case of a weak magnetic field ( sec . [",
    "sec : wmf ] ) and different large magnetic fields ( sec .",
    "[ sec : lmf ] ) . finally , we apply our results to correlations in presence of spin - orbit coupling and to `` spectral scrambling '' in section [ sec : appl ] .",
    "at temperatures @xmath7 , the maximum conductance @xmath8 of a coulomb - blockade conductance peak is a function of the wavefunction @xmath9 of the resonant state @xmath10 only ,  @xcite @xmath11 here , @xmath12 is the area of the quantum dot , @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the positions of the tunneling contacts connecting the dot to source and drain reservoirs ( cmp . fig .

    "note that throughout the magnetic - field range of interest , correlations between peaks are positive : small peaks are more likely to be surrounded by small peaks , and large peaks attract more large peaks .",

    "although our calculations were performed for peak height correlations that resulted from an external magnetic field or a change in the external magnetic field , they can also be of relevance as an effective description of correlations due to spin - orbit scattering in gaas quantum dots or due to `` spectral scrambling '' .    in two - dimensional gaas quantum dots ,",
    "spin - orbit scattering is described by the following two - dimensional effective hamiltonian :  @xcite @xmath124.\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here , @xmath125 are pauli - matrices , and @xmath126 , @xmath127 are length scales associated with spin - orbit coupling along the directions @xmath128 and @xmath129 that span the plane in which the dot is formed . in the limit",

    "@xcite    the peak - height correlations for a weak magnetic field calculated in section [ sec : wmf ] thus provide a good description of intrinsic peak - height correlations for a quantum dot with weak spin - orbit scattering in the absence of an external magnetic field . on the other hand ,",

    "conductance peaks correspond to resonant tunneling for one of the two spin directions .",
    "our calculations in section [ sec : lmf ] show that peaks originating from resonances with the same spin direction , i.e. @xmath140 , will have uncorrelated heights , whereas peaks originating from resonances with opposite spin will have correlated heights , corresponding to the case of large magnetic fields with magnetic - field strength difference @xmath141 .",
    "`` scrambling '' is the effect that each electron added to the quantum dot causes a small change to the self - consistent potential in the dot .",
    "@xcite hence , every conductance peak is taken at a slightly different realization of the dot s potential . while this leads to a _",
    "decorrelation _ of peak heights corresponding to the same orbital state , scrambling also causes a positive correlation between peak heights corresponding to different orbital states , as we have shown above for the case of a large applied magnetic field .",
    "( in the unitary ensemble , a change in potential has the same effect as a change in the applied magnetic field .",
    "the situation at zero applied magnetic field would correspond to the orthogonal ensemble of random - matrix theory , for which the calculation proceeds along the same lines and gives similar results .",

    "while such correlations may be of numerical importance , its dependence on the ratio @xmath145 is the same as that of the non - universal peak - height correlations in a disordered dot .",
