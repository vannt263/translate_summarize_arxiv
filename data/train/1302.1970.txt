    "there exists a rich and wide variety of distributions covering a large range of applications  @xcite .",
    "those having a power law behaviour have attracted considerable attention in physics in recent years but there is a a long history in other fields such as biology and economics  @xcite .    in high energy physics power law distributions have been applied in  @xcite to the description of transverse momenta of secondary particles produced in @xmath2 collisions .",
    "indeed the available range of transverse momenta has expanded considerably with the advent of the large hadron collider ( lhc ) .",
    "collider energies of 8 tev are now available in @xmath2 collisions and transverse momenta of hundreds of gev are now common .",
    "applications of the tsallis distribution to high energy @xmath3 annihilation has been considered previously in  @xcite .",
    "a recent review of power laws in elementary and heavy - ion collisions can be found in  @xcite .",
    "the tsallis distribution has the advantage of being connected , via the entropy , to thermodynamics which is not the case for other power - law distributions  @xcite . in this paper",
    "the focus is on the energy dependence of the tsallis parameters describing the transverse momenta at mid - rapidity in high energy @xmath2 collisions .",
    "the rapidity distributions contain more dynamics , e.g. strong longitudinal expansion , and will not be considered in this paper which is limited to mid - rapidity .",
    "in the analysis of the new data , a tsallis - like distribution gives excellent fits to the transverse momentum distributions as shown by the star  @xcite and phenix  @xcite collaborations at rhic and by the alice  @xcite , atlas  @xcite and cms  @xcite collaborations at the lhc . in this paper",
    "we review the parameterization used by these groups and propose a slightly different one which leads to a more consistent interpretation and has the bonus of being thermodynamically consistent .    in the framework of tsallis statistics  @xcite the particle number , @xmath4 , the energy density @xmath5 and the pressure @xmath6",
    "are given by corresponding integrals over the tsallis distribution @xmath7^{-\\frac{q}{q-1 } } , \\label{number } \\\\",

    "these expressions are thermodynamically consistent , e.g. it can be easily shown  @xcite that consistency relations of the type @xmath11 are indeed satisfied . the parameter @xmath0 might be treated as a sort of an anomalous dimension , while the parameter @xmath1 characterizes a soft dimensionfull scale .",
    "note the extra power of @xmath0 compared to other forms of the tsallis distribution , this is necessary in order to have thermodynamic consistency .",
    "the motivation for using the above expressions has been presented in detail in  @xcite and will not repeated here .",
    "other proposals have been made in the literature , see e.g.  @xcite and using a mean field approach  @xcite .",
    "the particular form of the tsallis distribution presented above has been referred to as tsallis - b distribution in  @xcite . following from  ,",

    "this formula can also be understood as an interpolation between low transverse momenta exponential fall - off and high momenta qcd power law behaviour  @xcite .",
    "this corresponds to substituting @xmath23 and @xmath24 after this substitution eq .",
    "becomes @xmath25^{-q/(q-1)}\\nonumber\\\\ & & \\left [ 1 + ( q-1)\\frac{m_t}{t } \\right]^{-q/(q-1 ) }   .",
    "\\label{alice2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] at mid - rapidity @xmath26 and zero chemical potential , this has the same dependence on the transverse momentum as   apart from an additional factor @xmath27 on the right - hand side of  . however , the inclusion of the rest mass in the substitution eq .",
    "is not in agreement with the tsallis distribution as it breaks @xmath27 scaling which is present in eq .   but not in eq .  .",
    "the inclusion of the factor @xmath27 leads to a more consistent interpretation of the variables @xmath0 and @xmath1 . + it is to be noted the variables @xmath28 in the distribution function eq .",

    "comparing eq .",
    "written for @xmath32 and the same equation written for finite values of @xmath8 , we obtain @xmath33 , \\qquad   \\mu\\leq\\frac{t}{q-1 } , \\label{t0 }   \\\\     v_0 & = & v   \\left[1-(q-1 ) \\frac{\\mu}{t } \\right]^{\\frac{q}{1-q } } \\label{v0}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] therefore , the variables @xmath1 and @xmath9 are functions of @xmath8 at fixed values of @xmath0 and they can be calculated if the parameters @xmath34 and @xmath0 are known .",
    "this redundancy is not present when @xmath35 , which is the case relevant for the lhc due to the particle - antiparticle symmetry .",
    "a very good description of transverse momenta distributions at rhic has been obtained in refs  @xcite on the basis of a coalescence model where the tsallis distribution is used for quarks . in this paper",
    "we use the tsallis distribution for hadrons , not for quarks . +",
    "a tsallis fit has also been considered in ref .",

    "+ the energy dependence of the transverse momentum spectra has been studied on the basis of gluon collisions in ref .",
    "the energy dependence in @xmath2 collisions can be determined by studying data at beam energies of 0.54  @xcite , 0.9 , 2.36 and 7 tev  @xcite .",
    "these involve distributions summed over charged particles .",
    "the fits were performed using a sum of three tsallis distributions , the first one for @xmath36 , the second one for @xmath37 and the third one for protons @xmath38 .",
    "the relative weights between these were simply determined by the corresponding degeneracy factors , i.e. 1 for for @xmath36 and @xmath37 and 2 for protons .",
    "the fit was taken at mid - rapidity and for @xmath35 using the following expression : @xmath39^{-\\frac{q}{q-1}},\\ ] ] where @xmath40 and @xmath41 , @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "the factor @xmath44 in front of the right hand side of this equation takes into account the contribution of the antiparticles @xmath45 .",
    "the resulting values of the parameters are shown in table 1 .",
    "the tsallis parameter @xmath0 has a tendency to increase slowly but clearly with increasing energy .",
    "the radius is listed instead of the volume @xmath9 in eq .   and is defined as @xmath46^{1/3}$ ] .",
    "note that the volume can contain dynamical factors , e.g. for a cylindrical expansion along the beam axis the volume could be interpreted as the transverse surface multiplied by the lifetime , @xmath47 , of the system , e.g. @xmath48 as would be more appropriate for a scenario with longitudinal scaling  @xcite .",
    "the value of @xmath49 should therefore not be considered in a full dynamical model .",
    "it is not necessarily related to the size of the system as deduced from a hbt analysis  @xcite but serves to fix the normalization of the distribution . the radius ( volume ) and",

    "the extremely large range of @xmath13 described by tsallis distribution makes it applicable in the region usually considered to be the domain of qcd hard scattering .",

    "may be considered as an effective theory allowing for an extension of the region of applicability of perturbative qcd from large to low @xmath13 .",
