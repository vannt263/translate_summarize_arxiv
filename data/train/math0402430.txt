    "point vortex systems on the sphere , introduced by bogomolov @xcite , provide simple models for the dynamics of concentrated regions of vorticity , such as cyclones and hurricanes , in planetary atmospheres . in this paper",
    "we consider a non - rotating sphere , since the rotation of the sphere induces a non - uniform background vorticity which makes the whole system infinite - dimensional .    as in the planar case ,",

    "phase space reduction shows that the three vortex problem is completely integrable on both the plane and the sphere : the motion of three vortices of arbitrary vorticity on a sphere is studied in @xcite .",
    "the stabilities of some of the relative equilibria given in @xcite are computed in @xcite and numerical simulations are presented in @xcite .",
    "the existence of relative equilibria of @xmath0 vortices is treated in @xcite , and the nonlinear stability of a latitudinal ring of @xmath0 identical vorticities is computed in @xcite , and independently in the present paper .",
    "it follows that the linear stability results obtained by @xcite are in fact lyapunov stability results .",
    "the stability of a ring of vortices on the sphere together with a central polar vortex is studied in @xcite , and again independently in the present paper .",
    "the existence and nonlinear stability of relative equilibria of @xmath0 vortices of vorticity @xmath1 together with @xmath0 vortices of vorticity @xmath2 are studied in @xcite .",
    "it has also been proved in @xcite that relative equilibria formed of latitudinal rings of identical vortices for the non - rotating sphere persist to relative equilibria when the sphere rotates .",
    "finally , studies of periodic orbits of point vortices on the sphere can be found in @xcite .",
    "our study of the stability of relative equilibria is based on the symmetries of the system , and especially the isotropy subgroups of the relative equilibria .",
    "the hamiltonian is invariant under rotations and reflections of the sphere and permutations of identical vortices .",
    "however , some of these symmetries ( eg reflections ) are not symmetries of the equations of motion : they are _ time - reversing _ symmetries . from noether s theorem ,",
    "the rotational symmetry provides three conserved quantities , the components of the momentum map @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the phase space .",
    "relative equilibria are dynamical trajectories that are generated by the action of a 1-parameter subgroup of the symmetry group .",
    "more intuitively , they correspond here to motions of the point vortices which are stationary in a steadily rotating frame . in other words , the motion of a relative equilibrium corresponds to a rigid rotation of @xmath0 point vortices about some axis ( which we always take to be the @xmath5-axis ) . in the same way as equilibria are critical points of the hamiltonian @xmath6 , relative equilibria are critical points of the restrictions of @xmath6 to the level sets @xmath7 .",
    "section [ intro ] is devoted to a description of the system of point vortices on the sphere , and to an outline of stability theory for relative equilibria .",
    "the appropriate concept of stability for relative equilibria of hamiltonian system is lyapunov stability _",
    "modulo a subgroup_. the stability study is realized using on one hand the _ energy momentum method _ @xcite which consists of computing the eigenvalues of a certain hessian , and leads to _ nonlinear _ stability results , and on the other hand a linear study computing the eigenvalues of the linearization of the equations of motion . to this end , we block diagonalize these matrices using a suitable basis , the _ symmetry adapted basis _ ( section [ basis ] ) , which makes use of the specific dihedral isotropy subgroup of the relative equilibrium .",
    "the remaining five sections each treat one of five different types of relative equilibria , consisting of rings of identical vortices together with possible vortices at the poles , whose existence were proved in @xcite .",
    "the notation for the different configurations is taken from the same source and is described at the end of the introduction .",
    "we now outline the main stability results .",
    "we begin in section [ 1ring - stability ] by computing the stability of the relative equilibria consisting of a single ring of identical vortices , a configuration denoted @xmath8 ( figure [ cnvrevpolesch3c](a ) ) .",
    "we show in theorem [ polvani ] that for @xmath9 , they are unstable for all co - latitudes of the ring , while for @xmath10 there exist ranges of lyapunov stability when the ring is near a pole .",
    "these results are not new @xcite , but serve to demonstrate the method used in later sections .    in section [ rp - stability ] , we study the stability of the relative equilibria @xmath11 ( figure [ cnvrevpolesch3c](b ) ) which are configurations formed of a ring of @xmath12 identical vortices together with a polar vortex .",
    "for @xmath9 they are all unstable if the vorticity @xmath13 of the polar vortex has opposite sign to that of the ring .",
    "however if the vorticities have the same sign then for each co - latitude of the ring there exists a range of @xmath13 for which the relative equilibrium is lyapunov stable .",
    "adding polar vortices can therefore _ stabilize _ the unstable pure ring relative equilibria .",
    "the detailed results are contained in theorem [ ring+pole / stab ] , its corollary and the following discussion .",
    "our results are consistent with those of @xcite , though our methods give more regions of stability than theirs  see remark [ rmk : cms ] .",
    "( @xmath14 has a vortex at the south pole as well . )",
    "[ cnvrevpolesch3c ]    in section [ r2p ] we obtain analytic ( in)stability criteria for the relative equilibria @xmath14 which are configurations formed of a ring of @xmath12 identical vortices together with _ two _ polar vortices , but only with respect to certain modes ( @xmath15 ) . as in the case of a single polar vortex , the two polar vortices play the role of control parameters for the stability .",
    "the details are contained in theorem [ ring+2poles / stab ] .",
    "a numerical investigation is needed for the remaining ( @xmath16 ) mode in order to provide stability criteria ; this is being pursued separately .",
    "finally , in sections [ 2r ] and [ rr ] we investigate configurations formed of two rings of arbitrary vorticities ( each ring , as always , consisting of identical vortices ) . in @xcite",
    "it was shown that two rings of @xmath12 vortices can be relative equilibria if and only if they are either aligned or staggered .",
    "these two arrangements are denoted @xmath17 and @xmath18 respectively ( see figure [ cnv2rrprimech3c ] ) . here",
    "we show that for almost all pairs of ring latitudes there is a unique ratio of the ring vorticities for which these configurations are relative equilibria .",
    "numerical computations of their stabilities suggest that these relative equilibria can only be stable if @xmath19 , and in the aligned case the two rings must be close to opposite poles , and hence have opposite vorticities . in some cases",
    ", staggered rings may also be stable when in the same hemisphere .",

    "the symmetry group of the system is of the form @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is a group of permutations , and a particular configuration with symmetry , or isotropy , subgroup @xmath22 is denoted @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the projection of @xmath25 to @xmath26 and @xmath27 represents the way @xmath25 permutes the point vortices .",

    "we single out configurations consisting of concentric rings of identical vortices , with the same number of vortices in each ring , and with possible polar vortices .",
    "these configurations have cyclic symmetry ( in the `` horizontal plane '' ) , and the schnflies - eyring notation for this subgroup of @xmath26 is @xmath28 .",
    "in fact we only consider the cases where the rings are either aligned ( the vortices lie on the same longitudes ) or staggered ( they lie on intermediate longitudes , out of phase by @xmath29 ) . in this case the symmetry group is the larger _ dihedral _ group @xmath30 ( @xmath12 being the number of vortices in each ring , and @xmath31 denoting the fact that there are vertical planes of reflection ) .",
    "for such configurations , we write @xmath32 to mean that there are @xmath33 rings and @xmath34 polar vortices .",
    "the difference between @xmath35 and @xmath36 is that the @xmath37 rings r are aligned and the @xmath38 rings @xmath36 are staggered with respect to the first ( and so aligned with each other ) . of course @xmath39 or 2 .",
    "in this section we briefly recall that the system of point vortices on a sphere is a @xmath12-body hamiltonian system with symmetry and we review the stability theory for relative equilibria .",
    "consider @xmath12 point vortices @xmath40 with vorticities @xmath41 .",

    "if we consider @xmath51 as a subset of @xmath52 , so the vortices @xmath53 , then we obtain @xmath54 @xmath55 it follows that @xmath6 is invariant under the action of @xmath26 .",
    "the symplectic form is @xmath56 invariant and so @xmath49 is @xmath56-equivariant .",
    "the reflections in @xmath26 reverse the sign of the symplectic form and so are time - reversing symmetries of @xmath49 .",
    "moreover @xmath6 , @xmath57 and @xmath49 are all invariant or equivariant with respect to permutations of vortices with equal vorticity .",
    "the rotational symmetry implies the existence of a momentum map @xmath58 : @xmath59 which is conserved under the dynamics . in other words",
    "each of the three components of @xmath60 is a conserved quantity .",
    "a point @xmath61 is a relative equilibrium if and only if there exists @xmath62 ( the angular velocity ) such that @xmath63 is a critical point of the function @xmath64 , where the pairing @xmath65 between @xmath52 and its dual is identified with the canonical scalar product on @xmath52 .",
    "equivalently , relative equilibria are critical points of the restriction of @xmath6 to @xmath7 , since the level set @xmath7 are always non - singular for point vortex systems of more than two vortices .",

    "_ augmented hamiltonian_.    since the momentum is conserved , we can choose a frame for @xmath52 such that @xmath67 is parallel to the @xmath5-axis ( provided the momentum is non - zero ) .",
    "it follows from the symmetry that the angular velocity @xmath68 is also parallel to the @xmath5-axis .",
    "we can therefore identify @xmath69 and @xmath67 with their @xmath5-components and the augmented hamiltonian becomes simply @xmath70 .",

    "finally , one can show that if @xmath63 is a relative equilibrium with angular velocity @xmath69 , then @xmath66 is a @xmath79-invariant function .",

    "the _ energy momentum theorem _ of patrick @xcite holds since @xmath56 is compact , and so we have :    _ if @xmath84 is definite , then @xmath63 is lyapunov stable modulo @xmath90 .",
