    "in order to push brightness limits given by transverse space charge effects , one can modify the longitudinal bunch shape .",
    "reducing the peak line charge density decreases the space charge tune spread and the beam becomes less prone to betatron resonances located near the working point .",
    "the standard approach to flatten the bunch profile makes use of double harmonic rf systems in bunch lengthening mode . in this paper",
    "we show that hollow longitudinal distributions provide a viable alternative .",
    "circular accelerators usually feature the strongest space charge impact at injection .",
    "ideally , bunches should arrive with an already flattened longitudinal profile .",
    "hollow bunches can be created in the upstream accelerator and then transferred into a single harmonic rf system .",
    "our experiment applies this concept to the cern proton synchrotron booster ( psb ) which provides beams to the proton synchrotron ( ps ) . for the double - batch filling scheme ,",
    "first four bunches are injected into the ps and circulate at the injection energy while the second batch is being prepared in the psb .",
    "after the second batch is injected and the ps acceleration ramp starts . during this period , transverse space charge effects can result in transverse emittance growth and/or beam losses and therefore become a performance limitation for high brightness lhc beams @xcite .",
    "we present a reliable procedure to create hollow distributions during the psb acceleration ramp involving minimal changes to the current operational cycle .",
    "finally , we compare emittance blow - up during the ps injection plateau between these hollow bunches and standard parabolic bunches .",
    "these efforts build on the experience from past hollow bunch experiments @xcite .",

    "assuming also the momentum distribution to be gaussian normal distributed yields the well - known expression @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the normalised beam emittance and @xmath14 the root mean square of the relative momentum distribution .",
    "nb : eq .   is no longer valid for beams with a momentum distribution that significantly deviates from a gaussian .",
    "longitudinally hollow phase space distributions address two aspects of eq . to reduce @xmath15 compared to gaussian or parabolic bunches .",
    "they project to    1 .",
    "intrinsically flat bunch profiles ( reduced @xmath16 ) and 2 .   broader momentum profiles (",

    "a longitudinal dipolar parametric resonance is excited by phase modulation @xcite . to this end",
    "we use the phase loop feedback system , which aligns the rf reference phase @xmath18 with the centre - of - gravity of the bunch .",
    "we modulate the phase loop offset around the synchronous phase @xmath19 : @xmath20 to excite the beam , the driving frequency @xmath21 needs to satisfy the resonance condition @xmath22 where @xmath23 denotes the angular synchrotron frequency .",
    "the integer numbers @xmath24 and @xmath25 characterise the @xmath26 parametric resonance . the actual synchrotron frequency of any particle within the rf bucket decreases with its synchrotron amplitude due to increasingly non - linear synchrotron motion towards the separatrix .",
    "below transition , as in the psb , longitudinal space charge additionally reduces @xmath23 .",
    "by driving the @xmath27 resonance at a frequency slightly below the linear synchrotron frequency , @xmath28 , the particles in the bunch core are excited to higher synchrotron amplitudes .",
    "figure [ fig : simulations ] shows the depletion of the bunch centre within a few synchrotron periods leading to hollow longitudinal phase space distributions .",
    "higher order resonances create two or more filaments spiralling outward from the bunch centre and are thus less effective for depletion .    the synchrotron frequency spread between the inner- and outer - most particles leads to a filamentation - like angular spread .",
    "the modulation duration determines the azimuthal span to which the excited particles surround the depleted bucket centre .",
    "the optimal duration distributing the particles as evenly as possible depends in descending importance on the excitation amplitude @xmath29 , the ratio between longitudinal emittance and bucket acceptance , and the beam intensity .",
    "the latter dependency becomes evident during intensity scans and is explained by decoherence suppression due to longitudinal space charge , which reduces the frequency spread over the particles and may prevent the filamentation process @xcite .",
    "the final longitudinal emittance @xmath30 varies with the bunch intensity , excitation period and amplitude . to reach a specific @xmath30 , modifying",
