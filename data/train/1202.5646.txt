    "we impose the conditions that the family and color algebras have fine substructures which are irreducible under the action of the permutation group s@xmath2 .",
    "this condition works to degrade the family and color algebras which are responsible for the quartet structures into fine algebras with trio plus solo ( 3 + 1 ) conformations . as a result",
    ", we are able to interpret that the component fields of the triplet field are composed of the ordinary three families and an additional fourth family of the tricolor quark and colorless lepton modes .    to reproduce all the successful results of the standard model and go beyond it , we introduce two types of triplet fields , a left - handed doublet and right - handed singlets of electroweak iso - spin , and apply the weinberg - salam theory originally formulated for the electron and its associated neutrino to these triplet fields .",
    "the ordinary gauge fields and higgs field of electroweak su(2 ) symmetry are assumed to interact with these triplet fields , and the gauge interactions of color su(3 ) symmetry ( baryon minus lepton @xmath5 charge ) are set to take effects between internal quark modes ( for quark and lepton modes ) of the triplet fields .",

    "one superior aspect of this formalism is calculability of the yukawa coupling constants as matrix elements between different family modes .",
    "it is possible to qualify the yukawa interaction and to make a new interpretation of its coupling constants with cp - violating phase naturally in an intrinsic mechanism of the triplet field formalism .",
    "the ordinary higgs mechanism results in new and unique dirac mass matrices which can explain all of the experimental data of the quark mass spectra and weak mixing matrix .",

    "so far , only one kind of higgs field @xmath248 of the standard model in ( [ ordinaryhiggs ] ) is chosen to describe the weinberg - salam mechanism .",
    "the main reason for this restriction is to severely suppress the appearance of the flavor - changing - neutral - current . to explain the smallness of the neutrino masses , however , it is required to introduce a different type of scalar field which brings about the seesaw mechanism by creating the so - called majorana masses",
    "further , we must introduce an extra higgs field which works to break down the u@xmath249 symmetry and metamorphose the gauge field @xmath202 to a vector field with a sufficiently large mass .",
    "this higgs field is assumed to couple solely to the solo family so that the fourth fermions acqurie sufficiently heavy masses compared with the ordinary trio fermions .",
    "we can expect that physics of the solo family sector can naturally be related to rapidly developing lhc experiments and astrophysics .",
    "there exist plausible candidates for the dark matter in the hitherto - unobserved solo family sector .",
    "such possibilities must be pursued in the triplet field formalism .",
    "last but not least . in this article , we have identified the internal algebra @xmath43 with the centralizer of the algebra for the lorentz transformation in ( [ ain ] ) as @xmath250 this choice turns out convenient to find the algebra of the family degrees of freedom through the decompositions of the chiral projection operators in ( [ loperator ] ) and ( [ roperator ] ) which are impossible in the external algebra @xmath30 .",
    "however , once we found the projection operators @xmath251 to the four family modes and the relations in ( [ nonchiraltochiral ] ) which allow to regenerate the chiral operators @xmath252 , it is possible to use the centralizer of the external algebra @xmath253 as an alternative definition of the internal algebra .",
    "mathematically , this simple choice which satisfies the relation @xmath254 seems relevant since it is faithful to the coleman - mandula theorem@xcite insisting that the spacetime and internal symmetries can not be combined in any but a trivial way .",
