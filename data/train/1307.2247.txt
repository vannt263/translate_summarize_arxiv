    "however , if the chevalier ( 1982 ) solutions are still valid on average , our results are correct , as they depend on the global ( average ) properties of the csm and ejecta .",
    "therefore , we conclude that our main result that the mass in the csm of sn2010jl is in excess of about 10m@xmath2 is robust .",
    "finally , we note that svirski et al .",

    "we note that the measurement of @xmath249 is not affected by the nature of the break .",

    "nevertheless , the steep value of @xmath301 probably means that if @xmath302 , @xmath188 .",
    "we note that in this case , the shock will accelerate , and at late times we expect @xmath303kms@xmath4 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : csm_prop_r ] ) .",

    "given the solution presented in figure  [ fig : tbo_vbo_m ] ( using @xmath241 ) , integration of the mass to the break radius gives @xmath304m@xmath2 .",
    "normal sn explosions have an ejecta mass that is similar , to an order of magnitude , to our derived csm mass .",
    "therefore , it is likely that the ejecta collected a csm mass which is equivalent to its own mass and the system reached the snow - plow phase , hence there is a natural explanation to the change in @xmath38 without changing @xmath151 ( at least not in a major way ) .",
    "of course , it is possible that during @xmath75 the values of both @xmath146 and @xmath151 are changing .",

    "2012 ) , while we observed @xmath306 .",
    "there are several possibilities to explain this .",
    "first , at late times ( a year after peak brightness ) there may be significant evolution in the bolometric correction .",
    "interestingly , the late - time spectra ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : sn2010jl_spec ] ) suggest that the sn becomes bluer at late times .",
    "we note , however , that these late - time measurements are affected by the underlying star - forming region and are therefore uncertain .",
    "in addition , the missing radiation may be emitted in the x - ray band .",
    "we find that if the intrinsic unabsorbed x - ray luminosity of the sn is @xmath307 times higher than observed , the contribution of the x - ray luminosity to the bolometric light curve will modify @xmath301 to about @xmath308 .",
    "a second possibility is that the system is approaching the slow cooling stage and some of the energy is not released efficiently as optical photons .",
    "our estimate suggests that at late times the cooling time scale is increasing to about 10% of the dynamical time scale ( fig .",
    "[ fig : csm_prop_r ] ) .",
    "therefore , it is possible that the shock starts to be nonradiative , hence explaining the steeper than expected power - law slope . to summarize the issue",
    ", we suggest that the most likely explanation to the discrepancy between the observed and predicted value of @xmath301 , is that at late times there is a substantial bolometric correction , and possibly the shock is becoming nonradiative .",
    "unfortunately , we do  not have reliable multi - band or spectroscopic observations during the second year .    based on our simple model , figure  [ fig : csm_prop_r ]",
    "shows the evolution of the various parameters as a function of time .",
    "panel ( b ) indicates that even at late times , about three years after maximum light , the density of the csm at the shock radius is of order a few times @xmath309@xmath198 .",
    "interestingly , the thomson optical depth above the shock , three years after maximum light , is decreased to roughly unity .",
    "this may explain why the visible - light spectrum of the sn is becoming bluer , as the region heated by the shock is becoming more exposed and the photons emitted in the shock region are affected by less and less processing .",
    "day and @xmath74 ( black lines ) .",
    "the gray lines are for @xmath310 , while the dashed - gray line is for @xmath311 .",
    "the black - dashed vertical lines show the breakout time scale ( @xmath173 ) , the time of the optical light - curve break ( 300days ; @xmath75 ) , the times of the first two _ chandra _ epochs ( @xmath312 and @xmath313 ) , and the _ xmm_@xmath26_nustar _ epoch ( @xmath314 ) .",
    "the different panels show the following : ( a ) csm mass within the shock radius , ( b ) density of the csm at the shock radius , ( c ) column density between the shock and the observer , ( d ) free - free cooling time scale divided by the time at the shock radius , ( e ) thomson optical depth between the shock radius and the observer , ( f ) 10ghz free - free optical depth , ( g ) ionization parameter ( eq .  [ eq : xi ] ) , ( h ) shock velocity , and ( i ) shock - radius evolution .",
    "time is measured relative to maximum @xmath28-band light minus @xmath173 .",
    "we note that panel ( g ) shows an additional dashed black line ; it represents the minimal ionization parameter ( for @xmath74 ) as estimated by replacing the luminosity in equation  [ eq : xi ] by the observed x - ray luminosity ( @xmath315ergs@xmath4 )",

    "therefore , naively , radio emission is not expected in the near future . however ,",
    "if the electron temperature just above the shock is significantly higher and the csm cocoon is terminated at a few times the shock radius , then @xmath317 can be small enough and radio emission would be detected .",
    "finally , we note that the cooling time scale divided by the hydrodynamical time scale [ panel ( d ) ] suggests that at late times , the system may approach slow cooling , so some energy losses ( not in optical radiation ) are expected .",
    "an interesting point to note is that figures  [ fig : sn2010jl_temprad_spec ] and [ fig : sn2010jl_temprad_uvot ] show that at late times the effective black - body radius is decreasing .",
    "svirski et al . (",
    "2012 ) argue that at late times the fraction of the energy released in x - rays is increasing ( as seen in sn2010jl ) . in this case",
    ", the optical photons will deviate from a black - body spectrum as fewer photons are available in the optical , and this can generate an apparent decrease in the effective black - body radius . in general , this effect should caution against the use of black - body fits to estimate the photospheric radius of such explosions .      we still do  not have a good theoretical understanding of the expected x - ray spectral evolution from optically thick sources ( e.g. , katz et al .",
    "2011 ; chevalier & irwin 2012 ; svirski et al .",
    "another problem is that the x - ray spectral observations are hard to model .",
    "the reasons are the low number of photons , contamination from nearby sources , and the degeneracy between the free parameters in the various models .",
    "nevertheless , it is interesting to compare the rough expectations with the observations . given these issues , our approach is to use the model we constructed based on the optical data to make some predictions for the x - ray band , and to compare the x - ray observations with these predictions .",
    "especially interesting are the _",
    "nustar_@xmath26_xmm _ observations which cover a large energy range and were taken when the thomson optical depth is expected to be relatively low , @xmath318 . here",
    "we discuss the bound - free absorption , the x - ray flux , and the x - ray spectrum .",
    "figure  [ fig : csm_prop_r ] shows that the predicted column density above the shock is very large , @xmath319@xmath23 during the shock breakout , dropping to @xmath320@xmath23 during our _ xmm_@xmath26_nustar _ observations .",
    "these predicted column densities are larger , by about two orders of magnitude , than the bound - free column densities suggested by chandra et al .",
    "( 2012 ) at early times .",
    "a plausible explanation is that the csm above the shock is ionized by the sn radiation field . indeed ,",
    "panel ( g ) in figure  [ fig : csm_prop_r ] suggests that at early times the ionization parameter ( eq .  [ eq : xi ] ) is @xmath321ergcms@xmath4 , and possibly as high as @xmath219ergcms@xmath4 .",
    "such a large value is enough to ionize all the metals in the csm ( chevalier & irwin 2012 ) .",
    "however , at late times , the ionization parameter is only @xmath322ergcms@xmath4 , which may leave some bound electrons in heavy elements .",
    "the next simple test is to use the order of magnitude estimate in equation  [ eq : lx ] to predict the x - ray flux as a function of time .",
    "the prediction is shown in figure  [ fig : sn2010jl_xlc_meane ] as a gray line . at early times , about 100days after the sn maximum visible light , the prediction is consistent with the observations . about a year",
    "later , the x - ray prediction is a factor of four higher than the observations , while around 2.5yr after maximum visible light , the predicted x - ray luminosity is a factor of two higher than observed .",
    "we note that equation  [ eq : lx ] is an order of magnitude estimate of the luminosity in the entire x - ray band [ including soft and hard ( @xmath323kev ) x - rays ] , and that it does  not take into account the bound - free absorption , which even if not very high , still can affect the emission of soft x - rays considerably . for example , for @xmath324@xmath23 , the bound - free optical depth ( e.g. , morrison & mccammon 1983 ) at 0.5kev ( 1kev ) is 7.3 ( 2.4 ) , which will decrease the observed x - rays at this energy by a factor of 1600 ( 11 ) .",
    "according to svirski et al .",

    "figure  [ fig : t_ecut ] suggests that the _ nustar_@xmath26_xmm _ observation measures the shock temperature , and hence the shock velocity .",
    "the three models in table  [ tab : xspec ] in which the faint nearby sources were removed suggest a shock velocity with 1@xmath25 confidence interval in the range 19004500kms@xmath4 .",
    "we suggest that the most physically motivated model is the power - law model with exponential cutoff , in which the power - law index is set to @xmath326 .",

    "quataert & shiode ( 2012 ) propose that dissipation of gravity waves originating from the stellar core can unbind large amounts of mass .",
    "chevalier ( 2012 ) suggest that a common - envelope phase just prior to explosion may be responsible for the csm .",
    "soker & kashi ( 2013 ) argue for outbursts driven by binary star periastron passages , and arnett & meakin ( 2011 ) show that shell oxygen burning in massive stars gives rise to large fluctuations in the turbulent kinetic energy that in turn may produce bursts .",
    "the most thoroughly explored mechanism is probably the pulsational pair instability ( rakavy , shaviv , & zinamon 1967 ; woosley , blinnikov , & heger 2007 ; waldman 2008 ) , which predicts that some massive stars will eject material several times before their final and last explosion .",
    "given the large amount of csm involved , it is possible that sn2010jl is a result of multiple pulsational pair instabilities taking place over the past several decades .",
    "multiple mass ejection events are required in order to explain the average @xmath7 csm radial distribution over a factor of 20 in radii .",
    "however , other explanations may exist ( e.g. , quataert & shiode 2012 ; chevalier 2012 ) .    e.o.o .",
