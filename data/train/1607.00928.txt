    "there is a general consensus that seyferts , low - ionization nuclear emission - line regions ( liners ) , radio galaxies and some transition galaxies contain supermassive black holes ( bhs ) accreting at moderately low accretion rates @xcite .",

    "llagns have properties distinctly different from bright agns , see @xcite for a review .",
    "in particular , the spectra of llagns generally do not have big blue bumps , but instead peak in the mid - infrared @xcite . also , the optical  x - ray spectral index , @xmath13 @xcite , the radio loudness @xcite and the x - ray photon index , @xmath14 ( @xcite , hereafter e12 ; @xcite ) , are all observed to anti - correlate with the eddington ratio ( reported either for the bolometric or x - ray band ) in llagns , while they correlate positively in bright agns .",
    "these differences show that llagns are not simply bright agns scaled down in the accretion rate .",
    "the leading theoretical picture of llagns is the accretion ",
    "jet scenario .",
    "this model utilizes three components @xcite , namely a cold geometrically - thin shakura - sunyaev disc ( ssd ; @xcite ) truncated at certain transition radius , @xmath15 , a hot accretion flow within this radius , and a jet . the hot component can either be an advection - dominated accretion flow ( adaf ; @xcite ) when the accretion rate , @xmath16 , is low or a luminous hot accretion flow ( lhaf ; @xcite ) when @xmath16 is intermediate .",

    "the radio is from the jet , and unless the source is sufficiently faint the x - rays will emit from the hot accretion flow .",

    "the strength of the magnetic field in the flow is given by the ratio of the gas - to - magnetic pressures , @xmath83 .",
    "the dominant radiative cooling mechanism of lhaf is inverse compton scattering of synchrotron photons .    the radiative efficiency , @xmath84 , of hot accretion flows has been studied by @xcite , who found the efficiency of lhafs to be very sensitive to the accretion rate , with @xmath85 .",
    "such steep relation is mainly a consequence of strong inverse compton at moderately optical depths .",
    "this feature is a key motivation for us to propose , following the work on the radio / x - ray correlations in bhbs @xcite , that ngc  7213 is in the ( type i ) lhaf regime when it shows a flat radio / x - ray correlation ( cf .",

    "we find that a change of @xmath132 by about 15 per cent results in a small change of @xmath0 but a change of @xmath1 by a factor of 3 . for the latter regime",
    ", we find that we can reproduce a steep correlation with @xmath371.4 ( cf .",
    "we show these results in fig .",
    "[ rx_corr ] , respectively , by the magenta and blue crosses . here",
    "we assume the mass flow ratio between ejection and accretion , @xmath133 , to follow @xmath134 in the lhaf regime and @xmath135 const in the two - phase regime .",
    "these two relationships are motivated both theoretically @xcite and by the shape of the observed radio / x - ray correlation .",
    "considering the uncertainties in observations , the flat branch is consistently reproduced . for the steep branch , our theoretical model",
    "also roughly reproduce the correlation slope , but the normalization is admittedly lower .",
    "this is because , the normalization of the @xmath29 profile is taken by the radio and x - ray data of the composite sed , where the radio is the _ averaged _ one of the whole atca observations .",
    "obviously , the radio flux will be lower than the actual value at that given @xmath1 , cf .",
    "the magenta cross with @xmath112 and the corresponding grey circles .",
    "apart from the slope of the radio / x - ray correlation , the average radio and x - ray luminosities of ngc  7213 agree with the prediction of the fp , while the flat correlation branch in systems like h1743322 lies well below the fp .",
    "possibly , this difference can be explained by the relativistic beaming effect @xcite in ngc  7213 , where the viewing angle is small , and which is classified as radio - intermediate ( b11 ; e12 ) .      as shown in fig .",
    "[ gamma_l ] and section [ sec : globs ] , ngc  7213 likely exhibits a v - shaped index  luminosity relation ,",
    "i.e. , its x - ray spectrum shows a harder - when - brighter behaviour when @xmath1 is low , and an opposite behaviour when @xmath1 is high .",
    "below we follow @xcite to discuss the @xmath14@xmath1 relationship .",
    "theoretically the photon index is positively correlated with the ratio between the power received by the seed photons , @xmath136 , and that received by the electrons , @xmath137 ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . the key factor to determine the sign of",
    "the correlation is the origin of seed photons for compton scattering . in the lhaf and adaf regimes ,",
    "the seed photons are dominated by the synchrotron emission .",
    "as @xmath16 increases , a corresponding increase of @xmath136 is slow due to synchrotron absorption effect , and slower than the increase of @xmath137 .",
    "thus , we obtain a negative @xmath14@xmath138 correlation . on the other hand ,",
    "the seed photons in two - phase accretion regime are quasi - thermally emitted by the cold clumps .",
    "as @xmath16 increases , more and more clumps will be formed .",
    "consequently , @xmath136 increases faster compared to @xmath137 , and we obtain a positive @xmath14@xmath138 correlation.@xmath1 branch are the thermal emission of inner cold disc . ]",
    "detailed numerical results are shown in fig .",
    "[ gamma_l ] , where the magenta ( connected by solid line ) and blue ( connected by dashed line ) crosses correspond to the lhaf and two - phase accretion regimes .",
    "these theoretical predictions are in good agreement with the data .       as a function of @xmath139 .",
    "the dashed horizontal line intersects @xmath140 of the peak value , which is adopted to estimate the spread ( in @xmath139 ) of the radio emission site .",
    "the emission from the counterjet , multiplied for clarity of display by a factor of 10 , is shown by the red dashed curve . ]    in the accretion - jet model , the bulk of x - rays come from a central region of the hot flow with the radius of @xmath141@xmath142 , while the radio comes from the jet .",
    "a fluctuation in mass accretion rate @xmath16 will have two consequences .",
    "first , it result in a flux change in x - rays .",
    "secondly , the fluctuation will propagate into the jet , and will cause a change in @xmath91 .",
    "thus , we will observe a correlated flux variability with changes in the radio range lagging those in x - rays .",
    "if the jet radio emission is partially self - absorbed , the bulk of emission at a given frequency comes from the distance where the emission becomes optically thin to synchrotron self - absorption @xcite . in a conical jet , both the electron density and the magnetic field strength decrease with the height @xcite .",
    "thus , we also expect that emission at lower frequencies will lag those at higher ones .",
    "both effects are confirmed by observations ( section [ sec : rxobs ] ) .    in our model",
    ", the jet is launched from the surface of the hot accretion flow ( in this case the lhaf ) at @xmath141@xmath143 .",
    "because of the large aspect ratio @xmath144 of lhaf , we may safely argue that there is no time delay for part of the material in the dominate x - ray emitting region to enter into the jet .",
    "consequently , the time lags between radio and x - rays , @xmath145 and @xmath146 , allow us to measure the propagation time within the jet itself . for a simple conical jet with constant velocity ,",
    "the bulk of emission at a given @xmath147 is occurs at the distance @xmath148 .",
    "we then have @xmath149 .",
    "this is consistent with the observed value @xmath150 .",
    "the time lag can be applied to constrain the jet bulk lorentz factor .",
    "the observed , @xmath147 , and emitted , @xmath151 , frequencies are connected by the doppler factor , @xmath152 $ ] , with @xmath153 .",
    "the distance from the bh of the bulk of the emission at a given @xmath147 is then approximately @xmath154 .",
    "the observed time lag implies that the emission site at 8.4 ghz ( observer frame ) is at ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) @xmath155 where we assumed @xmath156 .",
    "another independent constraint comes from the upper limit on the size of the plasma emitting at 8.4 ghz , @xmath45 ( section [ broadband ] ) .",
    "we can write @xmath157 , where @xmath158 defines the spread of the emission site in the @xmath139-direction .",
    "then the upper limit constraint in @xmath45 indicates that @xmath159 and @xmath160 .    together with the spectral modelling , we find that @xmath161 is required in order to obtain plausible jet parameters , where the upper limit of @xmath158 plays a key role .",
    "we set based on the data available for ngc 7213 . ]",
    "@xmath162 ( @xmath163 , @xmath164 ) .",
    "correspondingly , @xmath165 ( cf .",
    "equation [ eq : z84 ] ) . in fig .",
    "[ fig : zloc ] , we show the emission distribution at 8.4 ghz , @xmath166 , of both approaching ( shown as the black solid curve ) and receding ( red dashed ) jets , along the jet direction @xmath139 . from this figure , we estimate @xmath167 . besides , if we adopt @xmath1681/4 the peak emission to constrain the spread of the radio emission in the @xmath139-direction , then @xmath158 @xmath168 1@xmath169 .",
    "both values are consistent with current observations .",
    "as discussed above , the radio / x - ray correlation in ngc  7213 appears to be similar to that observed in a number of bhbs classified as outliers . also , the apparent change of the slope of @xmath14@xmath138 correlation in ngc  7213 , from negative to positive , is similar to that found in many bhbs ( e.g. , @xcite and references therein )",
    ".    however , there appears to be no other agn with such index  luminosity behaviour .",
    "this is probably because the evolutionary time - scale of agns are much longer than that of bhbs .",
    "consequently , the dynamical range in @xmath138 is usually much smaller than that in bhbs .",
    "an object showing some similarities is the bright agn ngc  4051 .",
    "although this source mainly stays at the positive index ",
    "luminosity correlation branch ( correspondingly the two - phase accretion regime in our model ) , _ xmm  newton _ observations hint at a turnover at its faintest @xmath1 , see the bottom panels of figs 9 and 10 in @xcite .",
    "thus , it may also enter into the ( type i ) lhaf regime there .",
    "however , the very large array and _ chandra _ monitoring on this source at high x - ray fluxes , i.e. at the positive @xmath14@xmath1 branch , shows a null ( or possibly a weak negative ) correlation between the radio and x - rays @xcite , which is inconsistent with the steep radio / x - ray correlation predicted by the two - phase model .",
    "thus , ngc  7213 remains a unique agn so far . with its low @xmath170 and the radio / x - ray and index/@xmath171 correlations with two branches each",
    ", it provides a unique opportunity to test the accretion theory .",
    "our main results are as follows .",
    "we compile an exhaustive set of the observational properties of ngc  7213 . these include its average broad - band spectrum , the relationships between its x - ray luminosity with the radio luminosity and the x - ray spectral index covering a broad range of @xmath1 , and the radio properties .",
    "we successfully model these properties through the accretion - jet model , which includes three components , i.e. a truncated cold disc , an inner hot flow and a jet .",
    "the inner hot flow changes its mode from the lhaf to two - phase accretion , which explains the changes of the slopes in the radio / x - ray and index / flux correlations .",
    "the critical 210 kev luminosity at which the change of accretion mode occurs is @xmath172 .",
    "the model parameters of the composite sed with @xmath112 are listed in table 1 .",
    "the most important parameter determined by us is the viscosity parameter , which is found to be relatively small .",
    "more explicitly , we have @xmath173 , where the uncertainties in @xmath12 and/or @xmath21 are taken into account .",
    "this low @xmath50 value allows the accretion flow to be in the lhaf regime at a relatively low bolometric luminosity .",
    "this determination is in agreement with @xcite , who proposed that systems with hybrid radio / x - ray correlation have small @xmath50 values .",
    "based on the observed time lags , the radio flux and the radio size constraint , we find the jet lorentz factor to be small , @xmath174 .",
