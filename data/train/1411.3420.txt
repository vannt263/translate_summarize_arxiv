    "indicates the state is completely the polar state while @xmath81 is a fully ferromagnetic state . from fig.4",
    ", we observe that the value of @xmath82 becomes nonzero which oscillates with time . in fig.4(a ) without initial perturbation , the emergence and disappearance of the ferromagnetic part is very small , i.e. , @xmath83 . in fig.4(b ) with initial perturbation , a relatively large ferromagnetic part @xmath84 emerges .",
    "this situation can be understand as follows : once the system starts to evolve , the initial polar state with the well - defined @xmath54-vector and inhomogeneous density will induce a nonzero polarization @xmath78 , leading to the mixing dynamics of the polar and ferromagnetic states .",
    "the dynamical evolution of @xmath78 forms a competition with the @xmath54-vector , yielding a reciprocation of growth and reduction of the state that is close to the ideal polar state .",
    "since the static solution is the exact and energetically stable , it does not show a large oscillation , in contrast to the 2d skyrmion case in antiferromagnetic spin-1 bose - einstein condensate which is energetically unstable@xcite .",
    "a recent paper has studied the hydrodynamics theory of spin-1 bec with the initial state defined solely within the ferromagnetic or antiferromagnetic manifold@xcite .",
    "it concludes that the system evolve into a mixture of the two manifolds , regardless of the sign and strength of the spin - dependent interaction .",
    "the analysis also applies to our case . in return , our results in the soc spinor condensate manifest the theory of ref.@xcite .",
    "in summary , we have analytically presented static and moving solitonic solutions to the soc spinor becs .",
    "we find that the static solution is the ground state and the moving solution exhibits number oscillation among the hyperfine states . due to the unique feature of the spin-1 bec ,",
    "the dynamics is distinct to the two - component bec .",
