    "it is helpful to identify which degree of freedom of electrons plays a role .",
    "an efficient way is to analyze the fluctuations . for a continuous phase transition , when approaching the critical point from the high - symmetry phase , a particular fluctuation diverges corresponding to the symmetry breaking , which provides the information of the relevant degree of freedom in the phase transition . even in the case of a first - order phase transition",

    ", we present a systematic study of the dominant fluctuation in the charge , spin , and orbital coupled systems .",
    "our method is twofold : the construction of the tight - binding model by _ ab initio _ calculations and the perturbation theory for electron correlations . in the first step , we perform band structure calculations on the basis of the relativistic local density approximation ( lda ) , and estimate the tight - binding parameters by the maximally - localized wannier function ( mlwf ) analysis . in the second step ,",
