    "layered structures consisting of alternating magnetic materials , have been subject of many experimental study .",
    "these experimental studies have shown that the magnetisation enhancement exists in multilayered films consisting of magnetic layers .",
    "the most commonly studied magnetic multilayers are those of ferromagnetic transition metal such as @xmath5 or @xmath6 .",
    "several experiments have shown that the magnetisation enhancement exists in multilayered films consisting of magnetic layers .",
    "it was found that ferromagnetic coupling can exist between magnetic layers . from the theoretical point of view",
    ", great interest has been paid to spin wave excitations as well as critical phenomena [ 1 - 3 ] .",
    "the study of thin films is partly motivated by the development of new growth and characterisation techniques , but perhaps more so by the discovery of many exciting new properties , some quite unanticipated .",
    "these include , more recently , the discovery of enormous values of magnetoresistance in magnetic multilayers far exceeding those found in single layer films and the discovery of oscillatory interlayer coupling in transition metal multilayers .",
    "these experimental studies have motivated much theoretical work .",
    "indeed , several methods have been used to study the layering transitions in ising magnetic films .",
    "benyoussef and ez - zahraouy have studied these layering transitions using a real space renormalization group [ 4 ] , and transfer matrix methods [ 5 ] . using the mean field theory , hong [ 6 ] , have found that depending on the values of the exchange integrals near the surface region , the film critical temperature may be lower , higher than , or equal to that of the bulk . using the perturbative theory , harris [ 7 ] have showed the existence of layering transitions at @xmath7 in the presence of a transverse magnetic field .",
    "the effect of finite size on such transitions has been studied , in a thin film confined between parallel plates or walls by bruno @xmath8 [ 8 ] taking into account the capillary condensation effect . by applying monte carlo simulations on thin ising films with competing walls , binder _ et al . _ [ 9 ] , found that occurring phase transitions belong to the universality class of the two - dimensional ising model and found that the transition is shifted to a temperature just below the wetting transition of a semi - infinite fluid [ 10,11 ] .",
    "hanke @xmath8 [ 12 ] showed that symmetry breaking fields give rise to nontrivial and long - ranged order parameter profiles for critical systems such as fluids , alloys , or magnets confined to wedges .",
    "we showed in one of our earlier works [ 13 ] the existence of layering transitions under the effect of a variable surface coupling .",
    "moreover , for an ising film with a wedge , we found in ref .",
    "[ 14 ] the intra - layering transitions under the geometry effect consisting on the existence a wedge .",
    "when the film is subject to a random transverse magnetic field [ 15 ] , we found the layer - by - layer transitions when increasing the concentration @xmath9 above a critical value @xmath10 for each layer @xmath11 .",
    "the aim of this work is to study the interface disorder coupled to layering transitions in a spin@xmath12 film in interaction with a spin@xmath13 film , using monte carlo simulations .",
    "the paper is organised as follows . in section @xmath14 , we give the model and the method used . in section @xmath15 we present results and discussions .",
    "we are studying two coupled magnetic films : a spin-1/2 film denoted @xmath0 formed with @xmath16 square ferromagnetic layers ; and a spin-1 film denoted @xmath1 formed with @xmath17 square ferromagnetic layers , fig .",
    "1 . each layer is a square of dimension @xmath18 spins . @xmath19 and @xmath20 being the number of spins in the @xmath21 and @xmath22 directions , respectively .",
    "the juxtaposed plans of the two films are coupled ferromagnetically via a constant @xmath2 , so that the hamiltonian governing the system is given by : @xmath23 where , @xmath24 are the spin variables in the film @xmath0 and @xmath25 are the spin variables in the film @xmath1 .",
    "the spins of the film @xmath0 are subject to an external magnetic field @xmath26 , whereas @xmath3 is the crystal field acting only on spins of the film @xmath1 .",
    "the sum @xmath27 ( resp .",
    "@xmath28 ) is performed on nearest neighbour spins of the film @xmath0 ( resp . of the film @xmath1 ) .",
    "the interaction @xmath29 between the spins of the film @xmath0 as well as between the spins of the film @xmath1 , is assumed to be constant .",
    "values of the interface coupling constant @xmath2 will be discussed in all the following .",
    "a preliminary study showed that , when performing monte carlo simulations under the metropolis algorithm , the relevant calculated quantities did not change appreciably for the film thickness : @xmath30 and @xmath31 layers ; and when varying the number of spins of each layer from @xmath32 to @xmath33 .",
    "where @xmath34 and @xmath20 are the number of spins , of each layer , in the @xmath21 and @xmath35directions , respectively .",
    "taking into account the above considerations , in all the following we will give numerical results for a film thickness @xmath36 layers , and @xmath37 spins for each layer .",
    "the geometry of the system we are studying is summarised in fig .",
    "1 , where the two films are coupled via the constant @xmath2 .",
    "each layer of the film @xmath0 is subject to the external magnetic field @xmath26 ; whereas the layers of the film @xmath1 are under the crystal field @xmath3 .",
    "although the model and established equations are valid for arbitrary values number of layers @xmath16 and @xmath17 , numerical results will be given in this work for @xmath36 layers . also the temperature fluctuations will not be taken into account and will be fixed at the value @xmath38 in all the following . in order to outline the effect of the external magnetic field , we plot in figs . @xmath39 and @xmath40 the layer magnetisation behaviour in each film : @xmath16 and @xmath41 for a fixed crystal field @xmath42 .",
    "the former figure , plotted for a small coupling constant value @xmath43 , shows that only the layers of film @xmath44 ( spin@xmath45 ) transit when increasing the external magnetic field , including the interface layer @xmath46 .",
    "hence for small values of the parameter @xmath2 the layering transitions are absent in the film @xmath1 ( spin@xmath47 ) for all values of the external magnetic field .",
    "but for higher values of the coupling constant @xmath2 the layering transitions begin to occur in the film @xmath1 , as it is shown in fig .",
    "@xmath40 for @xmath48 . when increasing the amplitude of @xmath2 more and more all the layers of the film @xmath1 transit , following the layering transitions present in the film @xmath0 .",
    "this means that for sufficiently large values of the coupling constant @xmath2 , the effect of the magnetic field @xmath26 acting on the film @xmath0 is propagated to the film @xmath1 layers . on the other hand",
    ", one can ask if the crystal field @xmath3 , applied on the film @xmath1 and disordering its layers , can affect the layers of the film @xmath16 . to answer this question , we plot in figs . @xmath49 and @xmath50 the layer magnetisation behaviour in each film as a function of the crystal field @xmath51 for a fixed value of the external magnetic field @xmath52 and two values of the coupling constant @xmath2 . indeed , the only disordering layer of the film @xmath0 is that one belonging to the interface : @xmath53 .",
    "the disorder of this specific layer is affected neither by small values of the coupling constant : @xmath43 in fig .",
    "@xmath49 ; nor by higher values : @xmath48 in fig . @xmath54 .",
    "hence , the disorder of the film @xmath1 does not affect the layers of the film @xmath0 except the special layer directly connected to the interface between the two films .",
    "on the other hand , the effect of the interface coupling constant is summarised in figs . @xmath55 and @xmath56 corresponding to a low crystal field value @xmath57 and a higher value @xmath58 , respectively .",
    "it is found that starting from a totally disordered film @xmath1 for low values of @xmath3 , when increasing the coupling constant @xmath2 values , all the layers of the film @xmath1 undergo non null magnetisations ( keeping the sign of the film @xmath59 layers ) , see fig . @xmath55 . while for higher values of the crystal field @xmath51 , see fig .",
    "@xmath56 , the increasing coupling @xmath2 values does not affect , neither disorder of the film @xmath1 layers , nor the layer magnetisations of the film @xmath0 .",
    "indeed , the special layer @xmath53 disordered for the high crystal field value @xmath58 at low values of the coupling @xmath2 , is not affected by increasing the coupling @xmath2 between the two films . in the following",
    "we will focus our interest on the particular layers of the interface of the films : @xmath53 belonging to the spin-@xmath60 film @xmath0 , and @xmath61 belonging to the spin-@xmath62 film @xmath1 . indeed , concerning the transition of the layers @xmath53 for a fixed crystal field value @xmath63 we show in fig",
    "@xmath64 the effect of increasing coupling @xmath2 on this layer .",
    "it is shown that the transition of the layer @xmath53 inside the film @xmath0 is not affected by increasing the coupling @xmath2 from low values @xmath65 , @xmath66 to a higher value @xmath67 .",
    "whereas , under the same conditions , the transition of the layer @xmath68 is strongly affected by increasing the coupling @xmath2 , see fig .",
    ". this layer does not transit for @xmath70 and any value of the external magnetic field @xmath26 . on the other hand ,",
    "the layer @xmath53 disorders for @xmath71 , see fig .",
    "@xmath72 , for any coupling @xmath2 value ; whereas the layer @xmath68 disorders for @xmath70 at @xmath73 , for @xmath74 at @xmath75 and for @xmath48 at @xmath76 , fig .",
    "this means that the crystal field needed to disorder these layers depends on the coupling @xmath2 of the interface between the two films . a scenario of this dependence is plotted in fig .",
    "@xmath78 for the layer @xmath53 and a fixed external magnetic field @xmath52 .",
    "it is seen , from this figure , that to disorder the layer @xmath53 for low values of the coupling @xmath2 , small values of the crystal field are needed . when increasing the coupling @xmath2 , the crystal field @xmath4 undergoes a maximum value at @xmath79 , and decreases when increasing the coupling @xmath2 more and more .",
    "the disorder and transitions of the interface between an ising spin-1/2 film denoted @xmath0 , and an ising spin-1 film denoted @xmath1 , has been studied using monte carlo simulations .",
    "the effects of both an external magnetic field , responsible on the interface transition , and a crystal magnetic field needed to disorder the interface are studied for a fixed temperature .",
    "it is found that for low values of the coupling @xmath2 , the layers of the film @xmath0 undergo a first order layering transition .",
    "these transitions are also found in the film @xmath1 , for higher values of the coupling @xmath2 between the two films . on the other hand , the layers of the film @xmath1 disorder when increasing the crystal magnetic field for any coupling @xmath2 value , but",
    "the only disordering layer of the film @xmath0 is that one belonging to the interface between the films @xmath0/@xmath1 . on the other hand",
    ", we show the existence of a critical value of the crystal field @xmath4 , above which this particular layer of the film @xmath0 is disordered at given values of the interface coupling @xmath2 .    1 .",
