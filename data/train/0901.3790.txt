    "electromagnetically - induced transparency ( eit ) in three - level @xmath0-systems is a phenomenon in which an initially absorbing medium is rendered transparent to a resonant weak probe laser when a strong coupling laser is applied to a second transition @xcite .",
    "it is based on quantum interference effects involving coherence between the two lower states of the @xmath0 .",
    "the quest has been on for simple room - temperature systems capable of demonstrating eit for applications ranging from narrow transparencies to switchable and controlled broadband delays , and slowing of light @xcite for use in quantum - information processing .",
    "room - temperature atomic vapors have been found to be attractive candidates for such applications , necessitating a treatment of the phenomenon taking into account effects of atomic motion and collisions .",
    "there are some early studies @xcite of doppler - broadening effects in eit for a system of moving atoms . in the limit of vanishing probe field and under the assumption that all atoms are trapped in the dark state ( which is a coherent superposition of the two lower levels of the @xmath0 )",
    ", it was found that power - broadening of the eit linewidth takes place : @xmath2 ( where @xmath3 is the rabi frequency of the coupling field and @xmath4 is the doppler half - width at half - maximum ) , which is similar to the well - known result for a homogeneously - broadened system : @xmath5 ( where @xmath6 is the homogeneous linewidth ) .",
    "this dependence was experimentally verified in ref.@xcite . in the limit of relatively low probe field intensity , @xmath7 , and under the same assumption of full coherent",
    "trapping ( i.e. , neglecting the two - photon coherence decay ) , other workers @xcite have derived the following result for the eit linewidth : @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the rabi frequency of the probe field .",
    "for eit in a room - temperature gas , the decay of two - photon ( raman ) coherence is caused by several mechanisms , such as transit - time broadening , population exchange , and atom - atom and atom - wall collisions .",
    "insight into the most significant decoherence mechanism can be gained by measuring the width of the eit resonance as a function of the coupling field intensity .",
    "an existing theoretical treatment of eit in doppler - broadened gases @xcite , assuming the population exchange between the lower levels to be the main source of decoherence , predicts a _ nonlinear _ dependence of the eit width @xmath10 on the coupling beam intensity for weak coupling powers . in the limit of very large coupling intensity",
    ", it is shown to reduce to the power - broadening case .",
    "et al_. @xcite consider a closed atomic model scheme and argue that such a model gives a description almost equivalent to the one for an open system in which atoms decay ( out of the interaction region ) with the rate @xmath11 , and atoms come into the interaction region with equally populated lower levels .",
    "though it is a theory for eit in a doppler - broadened medium , the role of collisions is completely neglected in ref.@xcite .",
    "most existing experiments in atomic vapors @xcite have shown the dependence of the width of the eit resonance on the coupling field intensity ( @xmath12 ) to be _ linear _ , even for weak coupling powers ( with the exception of the work by ye and zibrov @xcite which was performed without a buffer gas and with a very small beam diameter ) . as an example , we focus on the data of our recent demonstration @xcite that metastable @xmath1he ( he * ) at room temperature is a simple system capable of yielding eit and slow light . for the coupling field strengths used ,",
    "@xmath10 is expected to evolve linearly with @xmath3 according to ref.@xcite , with a slope depending on @xmath11 . the lower - level relaxation in a gas is mainly determined by the transit time of the atoms through the laser beam  different beam sizes would lead to different transit times and hence different values of @xmath11 .",
    "our experimental results @xcite have clearly shown that ( i ) @xmath10 evolves quadratically with @xmath3 , and ( ii ) the slope of this evolution is the same for different beam sizes , i.e. , for different values of @xmath11 . the suggestive role played by collisions between metastable and ground - state atoms in yielding this experimental result is not described by the theory of ref.@xcite .",
    "if all the atoms across the entire doppler profile are assumed to be initially optically pumped by the coupling beam to the probe ground level , a calculation @xcite of the response of the medium up to first order in the probe field leads to a linear dependence of the eit linewidth on the coupling beam intensity @xcite . to obtain this result",
    ", one also supposes that the decoherence in the lower states is caused by pure dephasing , contrary to the assumptions of population exchange in ref.@xcite . in a realistic situation",
    ", the special initial condition of the entire atomic population being in the probe ground level does not hold good  the population is equally likely to be in the probe and the coupling ground levels initially .",
    "thus , population exchange between the two lower levels can not be ignored .",
    "also , a treatment in first ( linear ) order in the probe field can not possibly give results when the coupling field is small , viz .",
    "of the order of the probe field .    in this paper , we address this deficiency in the existing theory of eit and slow light in a hot atomic vapor , and attempt a complete , realistic analysis taking into account all the relevant decoherence processes , for arbitrary strengths of the probe and the coupling fields , and without assumptions of any special initial condition .",
    "we consider the influx of fresh atoms in the lower levels and the outflux from all the levels at a diffusive transit rate in the gas .",
    "we allow for unequal rates of influx in the lower levels to take into account optical pumping by the control field and return of coherently - prepared atoms into the interaction region .",
    "the phase - interrupting and velocity - changing collisions ( vccs ) of active atoms are also modeled effectively .",
    "apart from the transparency width discussed so far , there are other features of interest associated with eit . for non - zero detunings of the coupling field from the center of the doppler - broadened transition frequency ,",
    "the transmitted intensity profiles become asymmetric about the two - photon resonance ( raman detuning = 0 ) @xcite .",
    "this fano - like feature is a signature of the two - photon process of eit , and emerges naturally from our model .",
    "the narrow spectral hole in the absorption profile of the eit medium is accompanied by a strong dispersion of the index of refraction according to the kramers - kronig relations , inducing a low group velocity .",
    "the evolutions of the peak transmission and the group delay with the coupling beam intensity predicted from our analysis faithfully reproduce the experimentally observed behaviors .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec.ii ,",
    "all the different relaxation processes for eit in a three - level @xmath0-system are discussed .",
    "the fraction of atoms that come back to the beam from outside being still coherently - prepared are suitably modeled in this section . in sec.iii ,",
    "vccs are dealt with separately , and the density matrix equations are written with various relaxations including that due to vccs .",
    "the steady - state solutions for the density matrix elements are presented in the strong - collision approximation with a model for the vccs under rapid vcc coverage .",
    "this is followed by our theoretical results in sec.iv on the doppler - averaged fano - like eit profiles , the variation of the eit width , the peak transmission and the group delay with the coupling intensity , all of which agree very well with the experimental data for the he * system . the general dependence of these features on the vcc parameter , the unequal atomic influx parameter , the raman decoherence rate and the initial transmission are also probed .",
    "it is shown that the unequal feeding back of atoms into the lower levels , more being in the coherently - prepared dark state @xmath13 , has an important effect on various characteristics of an eit medium .",
    "it is also shown that the impact of vccs is distinct and can not be incorporated by simply modifying the transit time decay ( and hence the raman coherence relaxation ) rate .",
    "the conclusions are presented in sec.v .",
    "consider a @xmath0 atomic system as in fig.[lambda ] . levels @xmath14 and @xmath13 are coupled by a weak probe field , the interaction energy being given by its rabi frequency @xmath9 .",

    "the probe detuning is @xmath16 with @xmath17 as the probe frequency , and likewise , the coupling field detuning is @xmath18 with @xmath19 as the coupling frequency .",
    "the raman detuning is @xmath20 the probe and the coupling fields propagate in the same direction , and the frequency difference @xmath21 is small enough so that the residual doppler shift @xmath22 can be ignored @xcite . for eit , the system should be prepared by optical pumping so that the initial population is entirely concentrated in the dark state @xmath23 .",
    "the coupling field creates a quantum interference between the probability amplitudes of transition @xmath13 @xmath24 @xmath14 via two different channels , ( i ) a direct absorption process from @xmath13 to @xmath14 , and ( ii ) an indirect stimulated raman process from @xmath13 to @xmath14 to @xmath15 to @xmath14 . under the appropriate condition of two - photon resonance @xmath25",

    "this describes the atomic coherence or the atomic polarization .",
    "hence , it is important to investigate the different relaxation processes affecting the optical coherence as well as the raman coherence of the two lower levels that lead to the dark state and eit .",
    "it is known that collisions of active atoms , which only perturb the phase or amplitude of an oscillating atom without changing its velocity , lead to homogeneous line - broadening and a shift of its line center . but collisions can also result in changes in the velocity of active atoms , in addition to being phase - interrupting , and affect atomic coherences of the system under consideration @xcite .",
    "the present theoretical analysis examines the density matrix equations for a three - level @xmath0-system interacting with two fields , in the presence of the following different sources of relaxation :    1 .",
    "the spontaneous decay from the excited state @xmath14 transfers atoms to the ground states with equal decay rates @xmath32 , 2 .",
    "the transit of the atoms through the laser beam at a rate @xmath33 replaces atoms ( in all states ) in the laser interaction region by fresh atoms arriving ( only in the lower states ) from the volume outside that region .",
    "the transit rate depends on the pressure ( diffusion coefficient ) of the gas .",
    "all the populations and coherences are affected because of this motion .",
    "but it is the lower - state relaxation that is mainly determined by the transit rate @xmath33 , 3",
    ".   the collisions ( phase - interrupting ) damp the atomic polarizations and coherences , 4 .",
    "the collisions also change velocities of the active atoms without changing their internal state .    in our example of the he * system , the atom - wall collisions are not very significant for the dynamics",
    ". de - excitation of he * on collision with cell walls leaves inert he atoms in the ground state ( 1@xmath34s@xmath35 ) , which can not be detected : there are no background atoms to contribute to noise , unlike experiments which use true ground - state atoms such as the alkali metals .",
    "thus , with our system , there is an advantage of collisions of the active atoms with the walls of the cell which result in quenching .",
    "the decay for the optical coherences is : @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the collisional dephasing due to pressure , and the raman coherence decay for @xmath38 is : @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the collisional term proportional to gas pressure , and @xmath41 is the dephasing due to inhomogeneity in residual magnetic field and other possible dephasing mechanisms .",
    "the mean free - path of the he * atoms is , in a hard sphere model , of the order of 0.1 mm . if we consider that the atoms cross the beam in a one - dimensional random walk , we can see that , at 300 k , they experience about 10@xmath1 collisions during their trip across a 1-cm - diameter beam , leading to a diffusive transit time @xmath42 of the order of 0.5 ms . according to a rigorous calculation by fitzsimmons @xcite , the diffusion constant at 1 torr and 300 k is @xmath43 = 500 @xmath44/s .",

    "the rates at which the atoms return to the lower states @xmath13 and @xmath15 are not likely to be equal , since inside the beam , the populations in these two states are made unequal by the control - field optical pumping from @xmath50 to @xmath51 , and hence the population diffusing outside is also likely to be unbalanced .",

    "@xmath71 is related to the differential scattering cross - section , and @xmath72 is related to the corresponding total scattering cross - section .    since the collision interaction depends on the internal atomic states of the atoms , a complete description requires a separate collision kernel for each atomic state population and each coherence . in general",
    ", an excited atom has a slightly larger collisional cross - section than a ground - state atom because excited atoms are bigger than the ground - state atoms , and therefore the excited atoms suffer a stronger collisional damping of speeds .",
    "the opposite holds true for the case of active alkali atoms colliding with neon where an excited atom has a slightly lower collisional cross - section than a ground - state atom .",
    "however , in a low - pressure regime where the decay rate @xmath73 ( @xmath74 10@xmath75 s@xmath76 ) at the optical transition ( @xmath77 or @xmath78 ) is larger than the collision rate @xmath79 ( @xmath74 10@xmath80 ) , the transport of coherence in the optical transition from one velocity group to another is of not much importance .",
    "for the lower - state coherence , the situation is different , as the effective lower state relaxation ( @xmath74 10@xmath1 s@xmath76 ) is smaller than the collision rate .",
    "we can thus assume that the collision kernel is zero for the optical coherences , is approximately the same for all populations , and is different for the lower - state coherence : @xmath81 thus , for the three - level @xmath0 system , the added vcc contributions are : @xmath82_{\\mathrm{vcc } } & = & - \\gamma_{0\\mathrm{vcc } } \\rho_{ii}(v ) + \\int k_0(v ' \\rightarrow v ) \\rho_{ii}(v')~ dv ' , ~~(i = a , b , c ) , \\label{eq8 } \\\\",

    "as @xmath142 is a deviation from the complete polarization - conservation by vcc , it should not depend on the beam size .",
    "we choose a value of @xmath146 , which helps us to obtain good fits to the measured evolutions with the coupling intensity for each of eit width , peak transmission and group delay , for all the measured beam diameters , with @xmath147 , which is simply the number of collisions per second as mentioned earlier .",
    "the excess incoming rate , @xmath148 to state @xmath13 over @xmath15 also has a distinct impact on the various features .",
    "in particular , the parameter @xmath55 = 0.1 gives satisfactory results in comparing the theoretical results with the experimentally measured evolutions . with the precisions of our measurements in he * , a constant value of @xmath55 is found to fit well for all beam diameters .",
    "the choice of the best - fit values of the parameters @xmath142 and @xmath55 for the he * system has been elaborated using the group delay plots in subsection d below .",
    "there was a slight over - estimation of the initial transmission @xmath143 for the eit experiments in he * , reported in ref.@xcite directly from the measured values , which included an effect of partial saturation by the probe power .",
    "this has been adjusted in the present paper .",
    "when the coupling beam frequency is no longer at the center of the doppler profile , transmitted intensity profiles become asymmetric .",
    "this is similar to the fano profiles obtained in the case of eit in a homogeneously - broadened medium and which have been shown to be due to interferences between a direct process and stimulated raman scattering in the overall transition probability @xcite .",
    "however , here , these profiles are modified by the fact that they have to be convoluted with the inhomogeneous doppler profile .",
    "figure [ fig2 ] shows the evolution of the transmission versus raman detuning @xmath25 for different values of the detuning @xmath149 of the coupling beam with respect to the center of the doppler profile . on the left - hand side , the measured values through a he * cell with initial transmission at resonance @xmath143 = 0.56 for a beam diameter of 1.5 cm",
    ", a coupling power of 11 mw and a probe power of 140 @xmath48w are reproduced from ref.@xcite .",
    "the base of the symmetric ( black ) curve at resonance corresponds to a transmission higher than 0.56 , because of partial saturation of the medium by the probe intensity .",
    "theoretically , the transmission profiles are generated from the imaginary part of the susceptibility at different detunings @xmath149 of the coupling beam with respect to the center of the doppler profile mentioned above .",
    "the corresponding plots on the right - hand side of fig.[fig2 ] are obtained for a beam diameter of 1.5 cm corresponding to different values of @xmath149 , with the same initial transmission , coupling and probe powers as in the experiment , using @xmath150 = 4.3 khz , @xmath151 = 0.41 khz , @xmath146 , and @xmath55 = 0.1 .",
    "the transmission profiles at all values of @xmath149 increases slightly with an increase in @xmath55 .",
    "this is also seen in the behavior of peak transmission shown in subsection c. this has been checked for a range of @xmath55 from 0 to 0.1 .",
    "there is a distinct and sensitive dependence on @xmath142 , as the tip of each profile decreases slightly with an increase of @xmath142 , and the effect is the largest on the resonant profile . as a result",
    ", there is also a change in the relative placement of the profiles .",
    "this has been checked for a range of values of @xmath142 from 10@xmath152 to 0 .",
    "the reason for this is simple .",
    "since a deviation of the value of @xmath142 from 0 indicates a loss of coherence , the transmission at resonance will be greater for @xmath142 closer to 0 , because the system is more coherent as @xmath142 approaches 0 .",
    "additionally , the effect will be more pronounced when the atomic system is in resonance with the two fields , which is the condition for a perfect eit .",
    "we thus find that the predictions from our model indeed agree very well with the experimental results .",
    "the mechanism of decoherence in eit in a room - temperature gas can be probed by measuring the width of the eit resonance as a function of the coupling beam intensity . as mentioned in the introduction ,",
    "the theoretical treatment of eit in doppler - broadened gases @xcite , assuming the population exchange between the lower levels to be the main source of decoherence , predicts a _ nonlinear _ dependence for weak coupling powers : the eit width is expected to evolve with the coupling beam rabi frequency @xmath3 @xcite according to : @xmath153 where @xmath154 gives the effective width over which the atoms are pumped into the probe ground state for a fixed value of @xmath3 . in the case when @xmath155 , @xmath154 is dependent on @xmath3 and @xmath11 : @xmath156 , and the coherent population trapping is shown to be velocity selective , i.e. , it occurs only for those atoms whose frequencies are close to resonance with the coupling field . in the opposite regime , when @xmath157 , ref.@xcite predicts that @xmath158 , i.e. , in the limit of very large intensity , it is reduced to the power - broadening case .",
    "in contrast , in ref.@xcite it is assumed that all the atoms across the doppler profile are initially optically pumped by the coupling beam to the probe ground level , and the decoherence in the lower states is caused by pure dephasing , and not population exchange .",
    "then the response of the medium up to first order in probe field yields the following _ linear _ dependence of the eit linewidth on the coupling beam intensity : @xmath159    an example of the evolution of the eit width versus the intensity of the coupling beam is displayed in fig.[fig3](a ) . in the experiment with he",
    "* @xcite , the logarithm of the transmitted intensity is calculated and its full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) is then measured , in order to determine precisely the width of the susceptibility @xmath160 of the medium .",
    "the measured sub - natural ( @xmath161 ) widths for a beam diameter of 1.5 cm , a probe power of 100 @xmath48w and an initial transmission @xmath143 = 0.46 are shown as dots .",
    "theoretically , the imaginary part of the susceptibility is fitted with a lorentzian to obtain the fwhm corresponding to a particular coupling intensity .",
    "the continuous line in fig.[fig3 ] is the best fit from our model with the same parameters as in the experiment , using @xmath162 = 4.3 khz , @xmath163 = 0.41 khz , @xmath146 , and @xmath55 = 0.1 .",
    "the eit width @xmath10 is seen to evolve linearly with the coupling beam intensity , i.e. , quadratically with the coupling beam rabi frequency @xmath3 .    with the experimental parameters ( @xmath164 at 1 torr , @xmath165 , @xmath166 ghz ) @xcite , one obtains @xmath167 . since the maximum rabi frequencies @xmath3 used in the experiment are smaller than @xmath168 , the measurements are in the first regime of @xcite , where @xmath169 .",
    "thus @xmath10 is predicted to evolve linearly with @xmath3 @xcite , with a slope depending on @xmath11 , but these predictions are violated in the experiment . if we use eq.([javan ] ) to fit the linear evolution of @xmath10 versus the coupling intensity , we obtain @xmath170 , which is of the same order of magnitude as @xmath171 , showing that a major part of the doppler profile takes part in the eit process .    in our model we achieve the straight line feature of @xmath10 versus coupling intensity as in ref.@xcite , but without any assumptions of special initial conditions .",
    "moreover , if the data are fitted to the straight line given by eq.([lvovsky ] ) , the resulting estimate of @xmath150 does not reproduce accurately the measured evolutions of the peak - transmission and delay @xcite .",
    "our present model fits the straight line data for atomic @xmath172rb vapor at temperatures 60 - 100@xmath173c given in ref.@xcite , with appropriate values of the parameters for the optically thick system .    keeping all other parameters constant",
    ", a change in the initial transmission @xmath143 , and hence in the number density of the participating atoms in the cell , does not affect the evolution of the eit width with coupling intensity in our model .",
    "likewise , a change in the unequal feeding parameter @xmath55 does not produce any visible change in the eit width .",
    "this has been checked for a range of values of @xmath174 0 to 0.5 .",
    "this is understandable as these two parameters do not affect the raman coherence lifetime but affect the pumping efficiency ( e.g. the fraction of atoms that participate in the eit phenomenon ) .",

    "it clearly shows that the slope of the evolution is the same for different values of @xmath11 . note that different laser beam diameters would lead to different transit times of the atoms through the beam , and hence different @xmath33 .",
    "the motion of the atoms through the beam is assumed to be diffusive , as stated previously , because of the large number of collisions they undergo .",

    "the beam diameters are generally not precisely known , because the beam emerging from the acousto - optic modulators is not perfectly gaussian .",
    "this affects the precise determination of the transit times as well as beam intensities ( the probe and coupling powers measured before the he * cell were , of course , their average values ) and rabi frequencies .",
    "we have , however , checked that the experimental data for different beam sizes yield the @xmath33 values following the diffusive transit scenario .",

    "the inset shows that the measured data fit better with @xmath145 and @xmath176 .",

    "as pointed out earlier , in the density - matrix equations , the vcc contribution gets added to the transit time decay ( and hence the raman coherence relaxation ) rate as @xmath178 , except in the inhomogeneous term signifying atomic influx in the populations in the lower levels at the transit rate @xmath33 which has no contribution from the vcc . it is therefore not surprising that the net effect of @xmath142 can not be taken care of by @xmath33 or @xmath11 .",

    "the slope of the line changes inversely with changes in the values of @xmath4 and @xmath73 .",

    "it is clear that a lower decoherence rate @xmath11 leads to a more coherent system , and thus @xmath150 = 3.2 khz ( dashed curve ) yields the highest peak transmission compared to the rest shown in this plot .",

    "figure [ fig4](d ) shows the effect of different values of the initial transmission @xmath143 .",
    "it is obvious that a higher initial transmission @xmath143 would lead to a higher peak transmission for non - zero coupling intensities .",

    "a decrease in the initial transmission in the absence of the coupling field signifies a proportionate increase in the number of participating atoms .",
    "@xmath143 , however , does not affect the eit width .",
    "thus the delay - bandwidth product , which is a figure of merit for a delay / storage medium , turns out to be proportional to the number density of the medium .    in comparison to the width and the peak transmission plots shown in figs.[fig3 ] and [ fig4 ] respectively",
