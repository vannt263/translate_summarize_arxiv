    "the dynamics of how superconducting order develops , and the possibility of enhancing it under nonequilibrium conditions , has become an active area of research spanning solid - state systems  @xcite and cold - atomic gases  @xcite .",
    "these modern experiments have been complemented by intense theoretical activity attempting to understand dynamics of superconducting systems following an interaction quench  @xcite and also the possibility of driving a normal system superconducting via nonequilibrium lattice vibrations  @xcite .",
    "most theoretical studies of nonequilibrium superconductivity , with a few exceptions  @xcite , assume that only one superconducting order is relevant .",
    "however realistic systems are on a lattice which in turn allows for several competing superconducting orders that correspond to different irreducible representations of the crystal point group . in this paper",
    "we therefore ask the following question : is the symmetry of the superconducting order developing under nonequilibrium conditions , such as after a quench , the same or different from the one favored by the system in thermal equilibrium ?    in this paper , we identify the dominant pairing symmetry following an interaction quench in a hexagonal lattice , both in the presence and absence of time - reversal ( tr ) symmetry . for the tr - preserving system we study doped graphene , while for the tr - broken system we consider doped graphene subjected to a high frequency circularly polarized laser .",
    "we always assume that the system before the interaction quench is in the normal state , and then study dynamics of an infinitesimal superconducting fluctuation following the sudden switch on of an attractive interaction .",
    "the time - evolution of the initial superconducting fluctuation is studied within linear response , the goal being to simply identify the most unstable mode . eventually heating effects arising due to the energy injected in the quench , and also due to the laser , could prevent true order to develop at the longest times .",
    "we do not address this long time behavior here .",
    "thus our theoretical treatment assumes collisionless or prethermal dynamics .",
    "graphene subjected to a circularly polarized laser has been shown to be equivalent to the haldane model  @xcite .",
    "in fact deviations from the haldane model are found to be small even when accounting for how the quasi - energy bands are occupied , provided the laser is of sufficiently high frequency and weak amplitude  @xcite .",
    "thus for this paper , we will model the tr - broken system as the haldane model , and study its pairing susceptiblity following an interaction quench .",
    "studying the onset of superconducting instabilities in hexagonal lattices is also of experimental relevance due to the realization of such lattices using cold - atomic gases with tunable interactions  @xcite .",
    "moreover , recent experiments in bilayer graphene have shown that a strong non - linear coupling to phonons can be achieved  @xcite further increasing the possibility of inducing superconductivity .",
    "superconductivity in graphene has a long history  @xcite .",
    "for example , it has been predicted that graphene , with sufficient doping so that one is near the van - hove singularities , can realize superconducting order  @xcite . in particular this order can be either of the @xmath4 or @xmath5 kind .",
    "however unlike @xmath6 orders that have nodes , the spontaneously tr symmetry breaking chiral @xmath7 order opens up a gap everywhere on the fermi surface .",
    "thus from purely energetic arguments , the preferred state in thermal equilibrium is one of the two chiral @xmath3 wave states  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath0-wave order , while an allowed symmetry of the lattice , is always associated with a lower @xmath8 than the chiral @xmath3-wave order , so that the latter is the preferred phase in thermal equilibrium . in the rest of the paper , for notational convenience we will denote @xmath7 by @xmath9 .    the above equilibrium results for graphene will form a backdrop for comparing our results for the superconducting order following an interaction quench .",
    "firstly we will show that for the haldane model realized from graphene subjected to a high frequency laser , the broken tr symmetry naturally lifts the degeneracy between the two chiral modes , @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "secondly , due to band flattening caused by the laser , one need not dope the haldane model to the same degree as graphene to achieve the same @xmath8 .",
    "thirdly , and the main result of the paper , the interaction quench amplitude can influence which superconducting order parameter is preferred by the system .",
    "thus although for weak interaction quenches , the symmetry of the order parameter is the same as in thermal equilibrium , for larger quench amplitudes , a smooth crossover to a phase with a different superconducting order is found .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ model ]",
    "we describe the model , and outline the derivation of the pairing susceptibility and the equation of motion of the superconducting order parameter . in section  [ dopedgr ]",
    "we discuss the order parameter symmetries for graphene , while in section  [ dopedhaldane ] we do the same for the haldane model .",
    "we present our results for the time evolution of superconducting fluctuation after an interaction quench in both graphene and the haldane model in section  [ results ] , and discuss the phase diagram in terms of the interaction quench amplitude and temperature of the initial state , for a particular choice of doping . finally in section  [ concl ] we present our conclusions .",
    "the system we will consider is a hexagonal lattice with nearest neighbor hopping , such as graphene , with and without a circularly polarized laser .",
    "in addition we will consider interactions as our goal is to explore superconductivity .",
    "writing the full hamiltonian as @xmath10 , where @xmath11 denotes the kinetic energy and @xmath12 the interactions , the kinetic part is @xmath13 above @xmath14 is the crystal momentum , @xmath15 denotes the electron spin , @xmath16 is the bare tunneling amplitude between the neighboring @xmath17 sites , @xmath18 are electron annihilation operators for the @xmath17 sub - lattices respectively , @xmath19 $ ] denotes the circularly polarized laser of amplitude @xmath20 and frequency @xmath21 .",
    "@xmath22 are the three nearest - neighbor vectors of the hexagonal lattice , @xmath23 above we have implicitly performed the replacement @xmath24 in order to restore the periodicity of the unit - cell .",
    "thus @xmath25 are the translation vectors of the hexagonal lattice , @xmath26    a convenient way to probe the interactions non - perturbatively is to employ the @xmath27-@xmath28 model , where the interactions become  @xcite @xmath29,\\label{veq}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath30 and @xmath31 being respectively the spin and number operators on site @xmath32 , and the interactions are only between nearest - neighbor sites .",
    "these operators act on a restricted hilbert space that excludes doubly occupied states .",
    "periodic drive and interactions will eventually lead to heating  @xcite , however we are interested in very high frequency @xmath33 non - resonant driving , where the time scales for heating processes are exponentially long  @xcite . with this in mind , in the next sub - section ,",
    "we derive an effective time - independent hamiltonian by performing a high - frequency expansion , and retaining only the leading term that captures the effective tr symmetry breaking due to the circularly polarized laser .",
    "let us fourier transform the two off - diagonal elements of @xmath11 in eq .",

    "the above high frequency expansion shows that in general a periodic drive generates longer ranged matrix elements such as the next to nearest - neighbor tunneling terms appearing on the diagonal of @xmath43 .",
    "in addition , these tunneling matrix elements carry non - trivial phases that depend on the polarization of the drive .",
    "the generation of the term proportional to @xmath45 in @xmath43 indicates the broken tr symmetry due to the application of the circularly polarized laser .    for the interaction it is sufficient to keep the @xmath46 term in the high - frequency limit .",
    "the interaction @xmath12 is given by eq .  , which we can rewrite as ,  @xcite @xmath47 where , @xmath48 is the spin - singlet creation operator at position @xmath32 .",

    "an attractive interaction of magnitude @xmath28 is switched on at @xmath55 .",
    "as the system evolves in time under the influence of this interaction quench , we would like to study the tendency of the system to become superconducting .",
    "in particular , we plan to study the time - evolution of superconducting order perturbatively in the interaction .",
    "we consider a singlet superconducting order , @xmath56 where @xmath57 denote the three nearest neighbor bonds to the site @xmath32 . for a uniform order parameter",

    "is written in the sub - lattice basis , it can also be written in the energy band basis where the kinetic energy is diagonal . in that basis",

    "we will keep track of both the inter- and intra- band pairing amplitudes .",
    "the equation of motion of the order parameter is , @xmath59 where the operators obey heisenberg time - evolution , @xmath60 .",
    "c    using eq .  , and to leading order in perturbation theory in @xmath28 , @xmath61\\biggr\\rangle.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] after performing the averages with respect to the initial state denoted by @xmath62",

    "for some small , initial randomly chosen @xmath80 . since @xmath81 takes three values , we denote the superconducting order as a vector @xmath82 .",
    "growing and decaying solutions in time will indicate whether the system is susceptible to pairing .",
    "in addition , how the three components @xmath83 of the order parameter grow will indicate the preferred symmetry of the superconducting order parameter .",
    "c    it might seem that the only place the chemical potential appears is in the distribution function .",
    "however the superconducting order parameter has an uncertain phase which we can treated as a variational parameter tuned so that the long time decay of an initial fluctuation is the slowest . in performing the time - integrals in eq .  , this decay is the slowest when the phase factor is @xmath84 , which is equivalent to measuring all the energies with respect to the chemical potential @xmath71 .",
    "thus in eq .",
    "we will denote the energy of the upper band @xmath85 , and that of the lower band as @xmath86 .",
    "although eq .   was derived perturbatively in @xmath28 , yet the solution of the integral equation is non - perturbative in @xmath28 . to see this note that if initially at @xmath55 we had a small seed order parameter @xmath87 , then the first order correction from eq .",
    "is @xmath88 .",
    "the second order correction is obtained from substituting this back in eq .   to obtain @xmath89 , and so on .",
    "thus the solution for eq .   can be recast as an integral equation @xmath90 where @xmath91 . from usual complex analysis",
    "this implies that locations of zeros of @xmath92 in the complex frequency plane will determine the growth or decay rate of the order parameter .",
    "thus for later discussions we will find it convenient to interpret the results of the time evolution in terms of the location of the zeros of @xmath92 in the complex frequency ( denoted by @xmath93 ) plane . the explicit form for @xmath94 is , @xmath95 .",

    "since graphene has only nearest neighbor hopping , @xmath96 , the modes are , @xmath97 is defined in eq .  .",

    "the diagonal component of the pairing susceptibility @xmath115 is of the last form . thus the @xmath114 symmetry implies @xmath116 .",
    "other components of @xmath117 may be written as , @xmath118 the above implies @xmath119 .",
    "this together with the fact that @xmath120 gives @xmath121 and @xmath122 .",
    "in fact the above symmetries hold at any instant of time @xmath27 , so that @xmath64 has the general form , @xmath123    from the structure of eq .",
    "it follows that the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the @xmath64 matrix at any instant of time are @xmath124,\\\\ & & \\lambda_{d_1}(t ) = \\lambda_{d_2}(t)= \\pi_{11 } - \\pi_{12 } , \\nonumber\\\\ & & \\delta_{d_1 } = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{6}}\\left[2,-1,-1\\right ] ; \\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\ , \\delta_{d_2 } = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2 } } \\left[0,1,-1\\right].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] while the eigenvalues depend explicitly on time , the eigenvectors do not .",
    "thus all throughout the time - evolution , there are three mutually orthogonal directions that remain the same .",
    "these directions correspond to a non - degenerate @xmath0-wave solution and a doubly degenerate @xmath3-wave solution .",
    "any random initial condition for the superconducting order parameter evolves independently along these three directions .",
    "we track the time - evolution , and the fastest growing order parameter determines the nature of the superconductor at steady state . due to the degeneracy of the two @xmath3-wave modes , the growth rate of the two @xmath3-wave orders , or any linear combination of the two d - wave orders will be identical .    here",
    "we should mention that in equilibrium the superconducting phase and its symmetry is determined from @xmath125 .",
    "this treatment  @xcite gives the largest eigenvalue , and therefore the dominant instability to correspond to @xmath3-wave .",
    "since this is doubly degenerate , the order parameter symmetry is not uniquely determined . instead",
    ", energetic considerations indicate that the tr breaking combination @xmath126 $ ] ( or its complex conjugate @xmath127 ) will be favored .",
    "this is because the chiral order parameter has no nodes .    for the case of the quench ,",
    "such energy minimization considerations no longer hold .",
    "instead if the time - evolution shows the @xmath3-wave to be the fastest growing order parameter , the precise order parameter could be any linear combination in the degenerate sub - space .",
    "if the fastest growing order parameter is the @xmath0-wave , then the order parameter symmetry is uniquely determined . for the haldane model ,",

    "thus we find that there are no degenerate eigenvalues for the haldane model as broken tr prefers one of the chiral @xmath3-wave modes over the other .    just as for graphene , here too the eigenvalues of @xmath64 are time - dependent , while the mutually orthogonal directions stay static .",
    "we again study the time - evolution of an initial random but small vector @xmath82 , project the evolution along the three mutually orthogonal directions corresponding to the eigenvectors of @xmath64 , and determine the phase from the fastest growing mode .    before we present the results for the quench , we point out that in equilibrium , the haldane model obtained from taking graphene and shining a laser on it , is more susceptible to pairing than graphene .",

    "we project the time - evolution along the three mutually orthogonal eigenvectors of the pairing susceptibility @xmath64 . for graphene",

    "the slopes are proportional to the growth rate , and for the parameters chosen , @xmath1 grows faster than @xmath2 , followed by @xmath0-wave . for this case",
    "we therefore conclude that the preferred superconducting phase is @xmath1 .",
    "the time - evolution for doped graphene is similar to fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] except that the slopes for @xmath1 and @xmath2 are the same , reflecting the degenerate eigenvalues of @xmath64 .",
    "c    as the quench amplitude increases , the @xmath3-wave order parameter growth rate increases .",
    "however , after some critical value of @xmath28 , the @xmath0-wave order parameter begins to grow faster , eventually out growing the @xmath3-wave order parameter .",
    "how the growth rate difference of the @xmath3-wave and @xmath0-wave order parameters vary with quench amplitude is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] . initially the @xmath3-wave becomes more unstable as the interaction parameter increases .",
    "this result is expected as in general the growth rate of any order parameter is slowest at the critical point , and grows ( decays ) faster as one moves further into ( away ) from the ordered phase .",
    "however , we find that after a critical @xmath28 , the difference between the growth rates of the two order parameters rapidly approaches zero , with the @xmath0-wave growing faster than the @xmath3-wave beyond a critical quench amplitude .    c    the phase diagram determined by the fastest growing order parameter is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] for doped graphene , and figures  [ fig4 ] and  [ fig5 ] for the haldane model .",
    "for all these figures , the transition from the disordered ( i.e , normal ) to the @xmath3-wave ordered phase obtained from the time - evolution , coincides with an equilibrium calculation based on identifying the @xmath70 and @xmath28 values at which @xmath146 .",
    "however for larger values of @xmath28 ( i.e. , as the quench amplitude increases ) , eventually the @xmath0-wave grows faster .    this result can be understood as follows . for smaller quench amplitudes ,",
    "the dynamics is primarily from quasi - particle excitations in the vicinity of the fermi surface .",
    "thus the equilibrium phase predicting @xmath3-wave order is recovered .",
    "in contrast , for larger quench amplitudes , the dynamics is governed by highly excited quasi - particles .",
    "these quasi - particles cause an effective dephasing , leading to an averaging over the entire brillouin zone ( bz ) .",
    "this averaging favors an @xmath0-wave rather than a @xmath3-wave because the latter order parameter changes sign in the bz , so that its magnitude is effectively averaged out to zero by the dephasing .",
    "note that the boundary between the @xmath3-wave and @xmath0-wave phases in figures  [ fig3 ] ,  [ fig4 ] and  [ fig5 ] is rather flat as a function of temperature .",
    "this is simply reflecting the fact that since quasi - particles everywhere in the bz are participating in the dynamics , these are not sensitive to the details of the initial distribution function .",
    "the location of the flat line between the d - wave and s - wave phases does however depend on the initial state through the doping level .",
    "c    in all the three figures  [ fig3 ] ,  [ fig4 ] and  [ fig5 ] , we plot the phase diagram up to the temperatures where the @xmath3-wave and the @xmath0-wave growth rates at linear response are clearly different . at higher temperatures ,",
    "all the order parameter growth rates are degenerate within linear - response , and the @xmath28 values at which we expect ordering become too large for a reliable perturbative treatment .",
    "we make our observation regarding the favored superconducting order more quantitative by noting that the growth or decay rate of an initial order parameter fluctuation is determined by the location of the zeros of @xmath147 in the complex @xmath93 plane ( see eq .   and discussion above it ) .",
    "indeed , in equilibrium , the critical temperature @xmath8 for a given @xmath28 is one where the zeros approach @xmath148 linearly in the deviation from the critical temperature or critical coupling .",
    "for an interaction quench deeper and deeper into the ordered phase , the pole shifts further out into the complex plane , indicating that the order parameter grows faster .",
    "this behavior can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] where the growth rate is determined by value of @xmath93 for which @xmath149 intersects with the real part of @xmath150 .",
    "in addition , fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] clearly shows that as @xmath28 increases , first the @xmath3-wave grows faster .",
    "but for larger values of @xmath28 , eventually the @xmath0-wave order grows fastest .    in @xmath151",
    ", @xmath93 has both real and imaginary parts . in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] , for simplicity we allow @xmath93 to be purely real , and so we assume that the zeros fall entirely on the imaginary axis .",
    "we look for solutions where @xmath152 $ ] . in principle",
    "the real and imaginary parts of @xmath93 should be tuned together to satisfy the two conditions @xmath153=0 , { \\rm im}[\\pi^r(z)]=0 $ ] .",
    "inspite of not doing this analysis in the full complex plane , the growth rate and critical couplings agree quite well with the full time evolution .",
    "the growth of superconducting order under nonequilibrium conditions is an active area of research . in this paper",
    "we give an explicit example of how two competing superconducting states behave after an interaction quench .",
    "we show that tuning the interaction quench amplitude can favor one superconducting state over the other .",
    "this result is relevant to experiments in cold - atom gases where interaction quenches into the superconducting phase can be easily performed .",
    "recent experiments in pump - probe spectroscopy make these results also relevant to the solid - state .",
    "in fact a laser can modify the lattice parameters , and through it the effective interactions in the @xmath27-@xmath28 model used by us to study superconductivity .",
    "thus even in the solid - state , a laser quench can effectively give rise to an interaction quench .    while our study was for a hexagonal lattice with and without tr symmetry ,",
    "our result showing how the dominant phase can be tuned by nonequilibrium conditions , such as an external laser and interaction quenches , is rather general and applicable to a wide range of lattice models where different ordered phases compete .",
    "our study treated the effect of the tr symmetry breaking laser within a high frequency expansion .",
    "the dynamics in the presence of a resonant low - frequency laser is expected to be even richer , and is left for future studies .    _",
