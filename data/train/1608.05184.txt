    "almost every galaxy with a central bulge contains a supermassive black hole ( smbh ) ( @xmath1 ) at its centre @xcite .",
    "the smbh acquires such a large mass through accretion of matter from its surrounding and the merger of the host galaxies .",
    "these processes trigger the active galactic nuclei ( agn ) phase of the smbh during which the accretion rates are high and the accreting material emits large fraction of its rest energy .",
    "the luminosity of the agn may surpass the total light from the galaxy and drive strong galactic outflows .",
    "the evidence of such a feedback from the agn is present in massive galaxies , groups and clusters .",
    "simulations @xcite as well as analytical studies @xcite show that , in the absence of any agn feedback , it is difficult to reproduce various observations such as the gas mass fractions , x - ray luminosity scaling relations , heating of cooling flows of galaxy clusters , gas pressure profiles .",
    "the cluster gas entropy also holds key to agn feedback , which can be directly linked to non - gravitational energy deposited and remaining in the intracluster medium @xcite .",
    "these studies give indirect but strong evidence of the presence of the agn and support the importance of agn driven feedback in the evolution of the galaxies .",
    "in addition to giving rise to the outflows , agns are strong x - rays emitters and form a dominant part of the extragalactic x - ray sky .",
    "erosita ( extended roentgen survey with an imaging telescope array ) which is a future x - ray satellite with all sky coverage will not only provide a large sample of x - ray agn , it will also cover a significant range of angular scales due to its large sky coverage and improved angular resolution ( @xmath2 ) compared to the rosat all sky survey ( rass ) , which was the last all sky x - ray survey with angular resolution @xmath3 .    in this paper , we first compute the angular auto - correlation power spectrum of the x - ray emission coming from agns , which are expected to be resolved by erosita survey , using a halo model approach .",
    "there are two main ingredients of this approach : 1 ) a model that describes the x - ray emission from agns .",
    "it can be obtained using the x - ray luminosity function ( xlf ) of agns which represents the luminosity distribution of agns as a function of redshift .",
    "here we use the xlf given in @xcite ( hereafter a15 ) .",
    "2 ) we also need a model that describes how agns populate dark matter halos ( dmh ) .",
    "large efforts have been invested into probing how the dmh affect the distribution and energetics of agns @xcite .",
    "the clustering measurement of x - ray agns suggest that agns occupy halos with mass @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "agn clustering measurements can also be used to construct the halo occupation distribution ( hod ) model of agns ( @xcite , hereafter r13 ) . in this formalism , the number of agn ( central+satellite ) is modeled in terms of the mass of the host dmh .",
    "the hod analysis describes how agns populate the dmh , which can be used to construct the agn power spectrum .",
    "specifically , we use the hod model described in r13 .",
    "this hod model however lacks a redshift dependence , which is expected from the redshift dependence of agn xlf and the host halo properties . here , we study the constraints that can be put on the redshift evolution of the hod model with erosita and large synoptic survey telescope ( lsst , @xcite ) using the x - ray auto - correlation power spectrum and x - ray - lensing cross - correlation power spectrum of the resolved agn .",
    "the choice of the x - ray - lensing cross - correlation power spectrum is motivated by the fact that the hod formalism connects the distribution of the agns with the host dmh mass and lensing signal is direct tracer of the mass .",
    "other important components of the x - ray sky are x - ray binaries , the hot gas present in our own galaxy and the extragalactic hot gas . amongst these x - ray sources , the large hot gas reservior ( @xmath5 )",
    "filling the space between the galaxies in the clusters , known as the intracluster medium ( icm ) , has been observed in its x - ray emission for a long time @xcite .",
    "however , the hot gas ( @xmath6 ) present in the form of circumgalactic medium ( cgm ) in massive galaxies ( @xmath7 ; @xcite ) is less explored in x - rays due to its fainter x - ray emission .",
    "some of the recent observations and studies @xcite indicate that the cgm can account for a good fraction of the baryons in these galaxies .",
    "the x - ray emission from the cgm , therefore , is a promising tool to put strong constraints on the distribution and energetics of the gas @xcite with erosita . at energies above 2 kev",
    ", the extragalactic point sources like agn completely dominate the x - ray sky @xcite .",
    "even below 2 kev , where the x - ray emission from the hot gas in the icm and cgm is significant , the major contribution to the observed x - ray sky comes from agn @xcite .",
    "therefore , studying the x - ray emission from the agn is crucial to understand the origin and evolution of the agn as well as to extract the x - ray signal from the subdominant components .",
    "we thus also compute the angular power spectrum of the unresolved agn which are expected to contribute to the diffuse x - ray background of erosita and contaminate the angular power spectrum due the icm / cgm in the 0.5 - 2 kev ( soft ) x - ray band .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in",
    "section-[sec - resolved ] , we describe the methodology and various ingredients required for the calculation of the x - ray power spectrum from the resolved agn . in section-[sec - clmz ] , we show the redshift and halo mass dependence of the power spectrum . in section-[sec - forecast ] , we forecast the constraints on the hod parameters and their redshift evolution .",
    "in section-[sec - unresolved ] , we compute the x - ray auto - correlation power spectrum due to the unresolved agn , its redshift and halo mass dependence . finally , we summarize our main conclusions in section-[sec - conc ] .",
    "the cosmological parameters used in this paper are taken from @xcite .",
    "presently , due to the small sky coverage of the ongoing x - ray surveys , the clustering of agn are usually studied only through their two point correlation function ( 2pcf ) .",
    "but , with the launch of erosita , it will be possible to explore the power spectrum of these agn in great detail .",
    "therefore , we choose to deal with the number weighted power spectrum of agns that are expected to be resolved by erosita i.e. agns lying above the flux resolution limit of erosita .    the angular power spectrum of the x - ray selected agn or simply the agn power spectrum represents the total contribution of the agn residing in a halo , convolved with the dmh mass function , integrated over mass and redshift , as a function of mutipole @xmath8 .",
    "the agn angular auto - correlation power spectrum is the sum of two terms , @xmath9 where @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the poisson and clustering terms , respectively .",
    "+      the poisson term ( independent of @xmath8 ; also known as shot noise ) of the agn angular auto - correlation power spectrum is given by @xmath12 the above equation also represents the number of agns per unit solid angle . here",

    "the lower luminosity limit in the above integral is determined by the sensitivity limit of the telescopes .",
    "we assume that all agns above the flux limit @xmath23 ( which is the flux resolution limit of erosita for point sources ) will be resolved by erosita .",
    "the agn xlf is defined as the comoving number density of agns per unit logarithmic x - ray luminosity is , i.e. @xmath24 . to compute it",

    "the values of the model parameters are shown in table-[tab - lade ] .",
    "note that this xlf corresponds to luminosities integrated in the 2 - 10 kev ( hard ) energy band in the rest frame of the agn .",
    "therefore , one has to take into account the band correction to estimate the xlf in different x - ray bands .",
    "the differential number counts i.e. the number of agns per unit flux and solid angle in the soft band is @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the differential comoving volume .",

    "we show the redshift dependence of the poisson , 1-halo and 2-halo clustering terms of the agn auto - correlation power spectrum in figure-[fig - clz ] . since , the poisson term is essentially the number of agn , its redshift dependence is identical to the solid red curve in figure-[fig - dndz ] , with a peak near @xmath74 1.2 .",

    "the 2-halo term , comes from the correlation of two distinct halos , and so depends on the angular difference between two halos , and hence smaller angular separation ( or higher @xmath76-value peaks at higher z. for the 1-halo , similar to the 2-halo clustering terms , the reason of increasing contribution from high redshift agn with increasing @xmath8 value is that the larger @xmath8 values correspond to smaller angular scales and the distances at higher redshifts appear smaller on the sky .",

    "the 1-halo term peaks near @xmath77 in the @xmath8-range @xmath78 and the peak shifts only slightly to smaller masses with increasing @xmath8 as smaller objects contribute more at large @xmath8 .",
    "there is negligible contribution coming from low mass halos ( below @xmath79 ) to the 1-halo term as expected from the agn mof .",
    "massive halos contribute the most due to the large number of satellite agn residing in them .",
    "however , we note that the mass dependence of the 1-halo term is really sensitive to the relation between the satellite agn mof and the host halo mass . since , the average number of satellite agn increases rapidly with the halo mass ( @xmath80 ) , most of the contribution to the power spectrum comes from the high mass end of the galaxy population where the number of galactic halos decreases exponentially .",
    "also , there is a large uncertainty in the determination of @xmath51 ( hence in the determination of @xmath35 ) , as shown in r13 .",
    "therefore , the power spectrum as well as its mass distribution may change significantly with a different value of @xmath51 .",
    "the 2-halo term shows a prominent double peaked structure in its mass distribution due to the different mass dependencies of central and satellite agn .",
    "the lower mass peak ( @xmath81 ) comes from the central agn contribution , whereas , the higher mass peak ( @xmath82 ) comes from the satellite agn contribution to the 2-halo term .",
    "the relative strength of these two peaks depend on the @xmath8 value . for small @xmath8 values ( i.e. large scales )",
    "major contribution comes from the massive halos , whereas , at large @xmath8 values ( i.e. small scales ) the low mass halos rule the 2-halo term .",
    "therefore , at small @xmath8 , the higher mass peak is more prominent than the smaller mass peak and at large @xmath8 smaller mass peak overshadows the higher mass peak .",
    "there are the following four free parameters in the agn hod model : @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath51 and @xmath50 , where @xmath48 is the halo mass at which @xmath83 , @xmath49 is the width of softened step function used for the central agn mof , @xmath51 is slope of power law relation between the satellite agn mof and the halo mass and @xmath50 is the mass scale at which @xmath84 . the agn auto - correlation power spectrum can be directly related to the hod parameters through simple power laws ( varying one parameter at a time and keeping all others fixed ) in a broad range around the fiducial values of these parameters .",
    "for example , @xmath85 has power law dependence on these parameters as follows : @xmath86 @xmath87 , @xmath88 and @xmath89 with little to no change in the power law index as a function of @xmath8 .",
    "however , the variation of @xmath90 with @xmath51 can not be fit by a single power law .",
    "the 1-halo term has @xmath91 in its integrand and the satellite mof itself is proportional to @xmath92 . consequently , the power spectrum is highly biased towards the massive halos as discussed in section-[sec - clmz ] .",
    "however , varying the value of @xmath51 can significantly alter the power spectrum due to the presence of the @xmath91 term . increasing the value of @xmath51 results in a large increase in the power spectrum causing the sensitive dependence of the power spectrum on the value of @xmath51 . for @xmath93 , @xmath94 , whereas in the range , @xmath95 , @xmath96 , at @xmath97 .",
    "similarly , @xmath98 is proportional to @xmath99 and @xmath100 , and are nearly independent of @xmath8 . however , in the case of @xmath101 , the power law index depends on the fiducial value of @xmath50 as well as the value of @xmath8 . at @xmath102 , near the fiducial value of @xmath50 , @xmath103 .",
    "analogous to the 1-halo term , the relation between the 2-halo term and @xmath51 is really sensitive to the value of @xmath51 as well as @xmath8 with @xmath104 for @xmath105 and @xmath106 for @xmath107 , at @xmath97 .",
    "figure-1-(b ) of r13 shows @xmath108 and @xmath109 with their 1-@xmath110 uncertainties . there is a large uncertainty in @xmath108 at low halo masses ( @xmath111 ) and in @xmath109 throughout the entire mass range",
    "this is due to the current large uncertainties in the determination of the model parameters , especially for the satellite agns . also , the x - ray agn sample @xcite used to construct the hod model in r13 spans a broad redshift range ( 0 - 4 ) with a median redshift , @xmath112 .",
    "therefore , this hod model represents the agn population at the median redshift , an average over the redshift range of the agn sample and it lacks any redshift dependence .",
    "other studies ( eg . @xcite ) involving the x - ray agn clustering measurement also indicate that the hod may have a weak redshift dependence . however , it is not possible to put strong constraints due to the small sample sizes . in this section ,",

    "for the purpose of this study , we choose following fisher parameters .",

    "we show the forecasted constraints on the parameters in table-[tab - uncertainty ] .",
    "note that the no priors , fixed hod and no redshift evolution cases correspond to no priors on any of the fisher parameters , no change in the fiducial values of the hod parameters and no redshift evolution of the hod parameters , respectively . using this method",
    "we find that the redshift evolution of the hod parameters can be constrained to @xmath126 , @xmath127 , @xmath128 and @xmath129 , with erosita and fixed hod parameters . since , the agn power spectrum is more sensitive to the satellite agn compared to the central agn , @xmath130 and @xmath131 are better constrained than @xmath132 , @xmath133 .",

    ". the x - ray - lensing cross - correlation analysis can alone constrain @xmath175 and @xmath131 to approximately , 0.5 and 0.9 , respectively . the uncertainty on @xmath175",
    "is much better for the cross correlation signal compared to the auto - correlation signal , whereas , the uncertainty on @xmath131 is similar for the two cases .",
    "the reason of the loose constraint on @xmath175 as compared to @xmath131 coming from the x - ray auto - correlation power spectrum is that the x - ray auto - correlation power spectrum is much more sensitive to the satellite agn mof , hence @xmath131 in comparison to the central agn mof , hence @xmath175 ( see equation-[eqn - p1h - ss ] and [ eqn - p1h - cs ] ) . on the contrary",
    ", the x - ray - lensing cross - correlation power spectrum has similar dependence on the central as well as satellite agn mof ( see equation-[eqn - clak1h ] ) , resulting in similar constraints on the corresponding fisher parameters .",
    "in addition , this difference in dependence of the auto and cross - correlation power spectra on the central and satellite terms give rise to distinct directions of degeneracy in @xmath175 and @xmath131 uncertainty contours , as shown in figure-[fig - fisher ] .",
    "consequently , the constraints obtained by combining the x - ray auto and x - ray - lensing cross - correlation power spectra fisher matrices is much better than their individual constraints .",
    "the constraints obtained from the combined as well as individual fisher matrices are shown in table-[tab - uncertainty ] .",
    "depending on the limiting resolution of the x - ray telescope , a fraction of agns may remain unresolved in the x - ray map .",
    "these unresolved x - ray agn are the prime source of contamination while studying the diffuse x - ray emission from the hot gas in the icm and cgm .",
    "therefore , modeling the unresolved agn appropriately is essential to extract the x - ray emission from the hot gas and hence the gas physics . in this section",
    ", we estimate the flux weighted angular power spectrum , the redshift and halo mass dependence of the power spectrum for the unresolved agn , assuming that these agn are also described by the same luminosity function and the hod model .",
    "the reason for the choice of flux weighted power spectrum is that it is not possible to identify the source of these x - ray photons as their hosts are not resolved by the x - ray telescope which rules out the number weighted power spectrum .",
    "but for the unresolved agn.,width=453 ]      analogous to the resolved agns , the flux weighted power spectrum of the unresolved agns is the sum of poisson and clustering terms .",
    "the poisson term is given by ,    @xmath176    in contrast to the resolved agn , the lower luminosity limit in the above integral is set to zero and the upper luminosity limit is fixed by the sensitivity limit of the x - ray telescope for the unresolved agn .",
    "again , the clustering term is composed of 1-halo and 2-halo terms given by equation-[eqn - p1h ] and [ eqn - p2h ] , respectively , with @xmath177 replaced by , @xmath178    in figure-[fig - cl - unresolved ] , we show the flux weighted auto - correlation power spectrum for agns lying below the flux resolution limit of erosita . similar to the resolved agn , at lower multipoles , the clustering term is dominant whereas at large multipoles , the poisson term takes over the total power spectrum .",
    "however , this takes place near @xmath179 2000 in the case of unresolved agns , compared to @xmath179 1000 for the resolved agns .",
    "another visible difference between the resolved and the unresolved agn power spectrum is that the 2-halo clustering term is always smaller than the 1-halo clustering term for the resolved agn , whereas , the 2-halo term is slightly larger than 1-halo term in the @xmath8-range 10 - 100 for the unresolved agn .      in figure-[fig - clz - un ] , we show the redshift dependence of the poisson , 1-halo clustering and 2-halo clustering power spectra of the unresolved agn .",
    "the redshift distribution of the unresolved agn power spectra have small but non - negligible contribution from the higher redshift agn compared to the resolved agn , with similar shape of the overall distribution .",
    "the poisson term peaks at @xmath74 1.5 .",
    "this peak is at slightly higher redshift compared to the redshift distribution of the resolved agn ( see figure-[fig - dndz ] ) which peaks near @xmath180 1.2 , due to the simple fact that a high redshift agn with the same luminosity as a low redshift agn , corresponds to a lower flux and hence may remain unresolved depending on the telescope s resolution . for the 1-halo clustering term , the power spectrum peaks near @xmath180 0.2 , for @xmath181 10 and the peak shifts only slightly to higher redshifts with increasing value of @xmath8 .    the 2-halo clustering term peaks at @xmath74 0.5 , for @xmath181 10 and the peak shifts significantly with increasing value of @xmath8 . for @xmath181 1000 , the 2-halo clustering power spectrum is dominated by @xmath74 1.5 agns . since",
    ", the total power spectrum is controlled by clustering term at @xmath182 and poisson term at @xmath183 , the overall power spectrum is governed by low to intermediate redshift agn ( @xmath74 0.2 - 1.5 ) .    the mass dependence of the unresolved agn power spectrum is shown in figure-[fig - clm - un ] .",
    "the 1-halo clustering term of the unresolved and resolved agn ( figure-[fig - clm ] ) have almost identical halo mass dependence , with a peak near @xmath184 due to the highly biased mof of the satellite agn towards massive halos .",
    "the 2-halo clustering power spectrum also show a double peaked mass distribution similar to the one observed in case of resolved agn .",
    "however , the low mass peak ( @xmath81 ) is more prominent than the high mass peak ( @xmath82 ) , even at @xmath102 . at higher @xmath8 values ,",
    "most of the contribution to the 2-halo term comes from @xmath185 halos .",
    "in this work , we divided the agns into two categories : 1 ) resolved agns , which lie above the flux resolution limit of erosita , and 2 ) unresolved agns , lying below this limit .",
    "we computed the number weighted and flux weighted angular power spectra for the resolved and unresolved agn , respectively , in the soft x - ray band .",
    "we used the lade model for the x - ray agn luminosity function described in a15 ( which matches well with the observed agn number counts ) and the hod model for the x - ray agn by r13 , which describe the luminosity distribution and halo mass dependence of the agns , respectively .",
    "we also calculated the luminosity and redshift dependence of the resolved agn finding that the maximum contribution to the agn luminosity and redshift distribution comes from @xmath186 and @xmath187 , respectively .",
    "we computed the number density of the x - ray agn using the xlf as well as the hod formalism and found that the two approaches are in good agreement with each other in a wide range of redshift ( especially at @xmath188 ) .",
    "the x - ray auto - correlation power spectrum has the following features .    1 .",
    "the power spectrum of the resolved agns is dominated by low redshift agn ( @xmath189 ) at low multipoles ( @xmath70 ) due to the dominant contribution from the 1-halo clustering term at these multipoles .",
    "however , at large multipoles ( @xmath69 ) , where the poisson term controlls the total power spectrum , the redshift dependence of the power spectrum peaks at intermediate redshifts ( @xmath190 ) . the 1-halo term is larger than the 2-halo term down to @xmath191 , though at low multipoles these two terms have similar amplitudes .",
    "2 .   for the unresolved agn",
    ", the power spectrum is dominanted by poisson term and hence @xmath192 agns at @xmath183 . in the range @xmath193 , where the 1-halo clustering term is dominant",
    ", the total power spectrum is governed by @xmath194 agns . at @xmath195 , the power spectrum",
    "have major contribution from @xmath196 agns due to significant contribution from 2-halo as well as 1-halo clustering terms .",
    "the hod model that we use in this work predicts a large number of satellite agns in massive halos .",
    "this mass dependence shows up in the mass dependence of the agn power spectrum ( resolved as well as unresolved ) .",
    "both the 1-halo and 2-halo terms show peaks at the high mass end ( @xmath197 ) of the dmh .",
    "interestingly , the 2-halo term shows an additional peak at lower halo mass ( @xmath198 ) , which is due to the contribution from the central agn .",
    "the low mass peak becomes more prominent than the high mass peak at large multipoles i.e. small angular scales , especially in case of the unresolved agn .",
    "we also investigated the role of erosita in constraining the redshift evolution of the hod parameters , which play a crucial role in determining the agn power spectrum , using the fisher matrix analysis .",
    "we assumed a simple power law dependence of the hod parameters on the redshift and found that the uncertainties in the determination of these power law indices vary significantly with and without any priors on other hod parameters . without any priors ,",
    "the x - ray auto - correlation power poorly constraints these parameters ( shown in table-[tab - uncertainty ] ) . to improve upon this",
    ", we included x - ray - lensing cross - correlation power spectrum , which is motivated by the fact that lensing traces the total halo mass and that the hod model describes the relation between the host halo mass and agn .",
    "the cross - correlation power spectrum can alone put much better constraints on the model parameters ( except for the satellite agn parameters in some situations ) and combining the auto and cross - correlation power spectra improves the uncertainties further .",
    "for example , @xmath199 , which describes the redshift evolution of the relation between the satellite agn mof and the host halo mass , can be constrained to @xmath200 and 0.16 , using the x - ray auto and x - ray - lensing cross - correlation power spectra , respectively , and the constraint improves to @xmath128 with the auto and cross - correlation power spectra combination , without any prior information on any other parameter .",
    "adding prior information on the fisher parameters can significantly reduce their uncertainties .",
    "the uncertainty on @xmath199 coming from the x - ray auto - correlation power spectrum only , reduces to @xmath201 , if the uncertainties on the fiducial values of the hod model parameters are reduced to zero .",
    "other parameters also follow the same trend depending on the sensitivity of the power spectrum considered , with respect to the parameter .",
    "our power spectrum analysis suggest that the present constraints on the agn hod parameters will improve significantly with the availability of erosita and lsst . at the same time , due to the potential of erosita to probe the hot gas in galaxies , such an analysis is expected to play a crucial role in separating the contribution from the agn and the hot gas .",
