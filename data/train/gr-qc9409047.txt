    "a benchmark for numerical relativity has been the computation of the gravitational radiation waveforms generated by the collision of two schwarzschild throats starting from rest@xcite .",
    "this description of the starting configuration is not complete .",
    "one can choose initial data in many ways to fit this verbal description .",
    "what remains to be specified can be said to correspond to the initial mutual distortion of the holes or the long - wavelength radiation present on the initial hypersurface .",
    "( initial short wavelength radiation would presumably be `` obvious . '' ) when the initial separation of the throats is sufficiently small , a single nearly - spherical horizon surrounds both throats , and the exterior geometry can be thought of as a perturbation of a single schwarzschild throat .",
    "recent studies@xcite show that this viewpoint is reasonably successful even when the horizon is highly distorted or is even split into two disjoint horizons .",
    "the extent to which the initial geometry mixes its `` two throat '' and `` one throat '' nature is the key to understanding this perturbation approach which promises to be important in the future .",
    "one would like to get a feeling for how this changes with changing separation of the throats , with different choices of initial data for a given separation , etc .",
    "for these , and many other reasons , it would be very useful to have a direct way of visualizing initial data .",
    "indeed , computer visualization would seem most appropriate for data that has been the starting point for so much intensive numerical computation .",
    "this would certainly seem possible in principle .",
    "the initial data under discussion are all momentarily stationary , so  in appropriate 4-dimensional coordinates  the initial time rate of change of the metric is zero ; the initial data then consists only of the initial 3-geometry . since that geometry is rotationally symmetric about the symmetry axis along which the holes will move , we can take a slice through that axis .",
    "the initial data is then fully specified by the spatial 2-geometry on that slice .",
    "a curved 2-geometry can , at least locally , be represented isometrically by a curved surface in flat euclidean 3-space . due to the nature of the black hole initial data",
    "one supposes such a surface to have the general shape of a pair of trousers .",
    "such pictures in fact are commonly drawn , but the actual surface , to our knowledge , has never been computed .    in the present paper",
    "we discuss the generation of an embedding diagram for the most commonly used black hole initial data , the `` misner data '' @xcite . on",
    "rather general grounds we show that the generation of the embedding can not proceed smoothly .",
    "we show explicitly that for the misner geometry the breakdown takes the form of the mathematical equivalent of shock waves in the embedding surface .",
    "this breakdown occurs , however , only quite near the crotch of the trousers and does not stop us from computing most of the embedding surface .",
    "this `` partial '' embedding is sufficient for most aspects of visualization of the initial data . in a subsequent paper",
    "we will report on the extent to which it is possible to overcome the obstacles to a global embedding .",
    "the remainder of the paper is organized as follows : section 2 introduces the mathematical preliminaries for the general problem of embedding a curved 2-dimensional geometry in euclidean 3-space .",
    "special emphasis is given to the case where the equations are everywhere hyperbolic since that turns out to be the case for the misner geometry , which is described in sec .",
    "numerical results are given in sec .",
    "4 along with a description of how the solution of the embedding breaks down at the formation of a `` shock . '' in sec .  5",
    "we discuss whether these shocks are inevitable and , if they are , how the incomplete embedding diagrams can be of use . as a specific example , we show how they aid in the understanding of the range of validity of perturbation theory .",
    "consider a positive - definite , 2-dimensional geometry described in terms of local coordinates @xmath0 and line element @xmath1 we would like to realize this abstract 2-geometry as a curved surface in flat euclidean 3-space , subject to the condition that the line element induced on the surface by the flat euclidean geometry agrees with that of ( [ eq : ds^2 ] ) .",
    "we want , in other words , to find three functions @xmath2 such that @xmath3 when @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 are substituted into the left hand side of the above equation .",
    "this requirement leads to three conditions @xmath7 where @xmath8 means partial derivative of @xmath9 with respect to @xmath10 , etc .",
    "the functions @xmath2 are called embedding funtions , and the mapping @xmath11 defines a 2-dimensional surface in the @xmath12 euclidean 3-space . a set of functions",
    "@xmath2 satisfying ( [ eq : e])-([eq : g ] ) is referred to in the mathematical literature as a locally isometric embedding . our goal is to find such an embedding for the 2-geometry corresponding to the misner initial data .    rather than try to solve the above system of nonlinear , first - order partial differential equations ( pdes ) for the unknowns @xmath2 , we will take a different approach originally due to darboux .",
    "( see , for example , @xcite . )",
    "this will lead to a single , nonlinear , second - order pde for the embedding function @xmath13 .",
    "although the resulting equation is nonlinear in the second partial derivatives of @xmath14 , it is of a special type and can be reduced to a characteristic system of five quasilinear , first - order pdes .",
    "it is this system of equations which we then try to solve numerically .",
    "once we find @xmath14 , the other embedding functions @xmath9 and @xmath15 are determined , in terms of @xmath14 , by means of quadratures .",
    "the purpose of the remainder of this section ( and the appendix at the end of the paper ) is to make these statements more precise .",

    "( we can always perform a euclidean transformation  i.e . , a translation and rigid rotation  to guarantee that this is actually the case . )",
    "since @xmath20 is positive - definite , and hence nondegenerate , in a neighborhood of that point , it follows that ( [ eq : ds^2 ] ) must be nondegenerate for it to be be locally embeddable .",
    "the left hand side of ( [ eq : flat2 ] ) is also flat , and hence has vanishing gaussian curvature .",
    "( there are no additional geometric constraints . in two dimensions ,",
    "the riemann curvature tensor is determined completely by the scalar curvature , and the gaussian curvature equals one - half the scalar curvature . )",
    "if we express the gaussian curvature of ( [ eq : flat2 ] ) in terms of the appropriate first and second partial derivatives of the components @xmath21 we find @xmath22 where @xmath23 are complicated functions of @xmath24 and their first and second partial derivatives , and of the first partial derivatives @xmath25 and @xmath26 of @xmath14 .",
    "( see the appendix for explicit expressions for @xmath27 . ) here @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 are shorthand notations for the second partial derivatives @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 .",
    "all third derivatives of @xmath14 cancel when calculating the gaussian curvature of ( [ eq : flat2 ] ) .",
    "a second - order pde of the general form ( [ eq : maeqn ] ) , with @xmath34 independent of @xmath35 , is said to be of the monge - ampre type .",
    "it differs from the general , second - order pde in that the only nonlinearity in @xmath35 occurs in the combination @xmath36 .",
    "this special feature results in a number of important simplifications below . in the context of the embedding problem  with @xmath27 depending on @xmath24 as in the appendix  equation ( [ eq : maeqn ] ) is called the darboux equation .",
    "if we write the general , nonlinear , second - order pde for the unknown @xmath13 as @xmath37 then the characteristic curves @xmath38 are those for which @xmath39 the discriminant @xmath40 determines whether real solutions exist for @xmath38 .",
    "an equation is said to be hyperbolic for regions in which @xmath41 , so that two directions exist for characteristics at each point in the region .",
    "the equation is said to be elliptic for @xmath42 , and parabolic for @xmath43 .    in the case of the monge - ampre equation",

    "the darboux equation is elliptic , so there are no characteristic curves .",
    "this means that features on one part of the embedding surface influence all other parts of the embedding . as we will show in the next section and in the appendix",
    ", the 2-geometry for the misner initial data has everywhere - negative gaussian curvature . in this case",
    ", the darboux equation is hyperbolic , and features , such as the choice of boundary conditions for the embedding , propagate along characteristics and remain fairly localized .",
    "a geometric meaning for the characteristics of the darboux equation emerges if we use ( [ eq : qt])-([eq : qr ] ) and the expressions for @xmath53 given in the appendix to rewrite ( [ eq : quadf ] ) as @xmath54.\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath55 are the @xmath0-components of the extrinsic curvature tensor @xmath56 for the embedding ( see the appendix ) .",
    "the characteristic directions for the 2-geometry of ( [ eq : ds^2 ] ) are thus seen to be the zero vectors ( i.e. , asymptotic directions ) of @xmath56 ; they are the vectors @xmath57 for which @xmath58 .",
    "clearly , for @xmath59 there are two principal curvatures of opposite sign .",
    "the principal directions are orthogonal in the geometry of ( [ eq : ds^2 ] ) and it is easy to see that the characteristic directions must be symmetrically arranged with respect to the principal directions .",
    "that is , a principal direction must bisect the angle between a pair of characteristics .",
    "since we are guaranteed that there exist two characteristics through any point , we can use the characteristics themselves as coordinates .",
    "we label one family of characteristics ( i.e. , one family of solutions of ( [ eq : quadf ] ) ) with @xmath60 and the other family with @xmath61 .",
    "the darboux equation can then be reformulated in terms of five unknown functions @xmath62 of the variables @xmath63 .",

    "it turns out , as shown in the appendix , that the remaining steps to complete the embedding are fairly straightforward .",
    "once the solutions to ( [ eq : cs1])-([eq : cs5 ] ) are found , the remaining embedding functions @xmath67 are determined in terms of @xmath14 by means of quadratures .    to close this section , we point out that the method of darboux described above is only one of many approaches to solving the embedding problem .",
    "there is an extensive russian mathematical literature on locally isometric embeddings for negative gaussian curvature 2-geometries which describes the method of riemann invariants .",
    "interested readers should see the review article by poznyak and shikin for more information .",
    "also , a paper by bernstein@xcite describes an iterative numerical scheme for computing isometric embeddings .",

    "a measure of the separation of the throats is @xmath72 , the proper distance from @xmath73 to @xmath74 , which can be shown to be @xmath75 the constant @xmath76 is a scaling factor that sets the size of both @xmath77 and @xmath72 , but not the ratio @xmath78 , and does not affect the `` shape '' of the geometry .",
    "the only parameter affecting the shape is @xmath79 , which is an increasing function of @xmath78 .",
    "for @xmath80 there is a single , nearly spherical , initial horizon ; for @xmath81 the geometry represents two widely separated throats , each with an initial horizon .",
    "the transition from a single horizon to a split horizon with two disjoint segments occurs at @xmath82 .",
    "the misner 3-geometry is rotationally symmetric ",
    "i.e . , it is independent of the the azimuthal angle @xmath83 .",

    "a numerical study of the gaussian curvature @xmath47 of this 2-geometry ( [ eq : misner2 ] ) shows that the gaussian curvature is everywhere - negative .",

    "the 2-geometry ( [ eq : ds^2conformal ] ) is approximately that of a single , central schwarzschild throat , and @xmath98 plays the role of the schwarzschild isotropic radius .",
    "@xmath98 is related to the schwarzschild curvature radius @xmath99 via @xmath100 where @xmath77 is the total adm mass ( [ eq : mtot ] ) of the single , central schwarzschild throat .",

    "our numerical approach is a finite - difference solution to the characteristic equations in ( [ eq : cs1])-([eq : cs5 ] ) . on the @xmath104 initial value surface ,",
    "grid points are chosen to be equally spaced in @xmath105 .",
    "a pair of @xmath63 characteristics is then started from each initial grid point",
    ". equations ( [ eq : cs1])-([eq : cs5 ] ) are used to propagate @xmath62 forward along the characteristics .",
    "the two axes of bilateral symmetry of the misner geometry are used to reduce the size of the numerical grid by a factor of four .",
    "the infinite sums were approximated by finite sums from @xmath106 to @xmath107 , with @xmath107 large enough so that the omitted terms were negligible .",
    "equations ( [ eq : cs1])-([eq : cs5 ] ) were solved numerically , and from the results , solutions were constructed for @xmath108 . with these solutions and the solution for @xmath109 ,",
    "the two families of characteristics in the @xmath12 space are known .",
    "the results are shown in fig .  1 in the three cases @xmath110 which correspond to @xmath111 . in these figures and in all those below , the value of the scaling constant @xmath76 was chosen , for each value of @xmath79 , so that @xmath112 .",
    "the @xmath113 coordinates therefore measure distances in units of @xmath77 , so that in the figures we are always visually comparing spacetimes with the same total mass , but with throats at different separation .",
    "an immediately apparent , and crucial , feature of the figures is that the characteristic net does not cover the complete @xmath113 interior to the @xmath104 initial value surface .",
    "the numerical solution inevitably breaks down at the boundary of an oval region that includes the throats .",
    "this is not a numerical artifact ; extensive numerical testing confirmed that the location of the breakdown was reasonably independent of numerical step size .",
    "a breakdown is , in fact , mathematically inevitable .",
    "this can most easily be seen by imagining the characteristics at the midpoint of the @xmath113 plot .",
    "since the underlying 2-geometry is symmetric about the rotation axis , the embedding diagram must be reflection symmetric about the horizontal line through the midpoint .",
    "the symmetry axis , then , must be a principal direction of the extrinsic curvature .",
    "the zero directions of @xmath56 , and hence the directions of the characteristics , must be symmetrically arranged about the principal direction .",
    "the nature of the characteristics must therefore be that shown in fig .  2 .",
    "but what direction along these characteristics is the `` forward '' direction of propagation of information from the boundary ?",
    "a choice of direction along these characteristic segments violates the symmetry of the boundary .",
    "the direction of forward propagation must be ill - defined at the midpoint .",
    "an extension of this argument shows that this must be a problem not only at the midpoint but also , at least , on the symmetry axis joining the throats .",
    "the inescapable conclusion is that the characteristic net emanating from the @xmath104 boundary can not smoothly and continuously cover the entire region inside the boundary and outside the throats .",
    "this conclusion , in fact , does not depend on the symmetry of the misner geometry , but only on its general topological character .",
    "we can shrink the @xmath104 boundary , and the throats , so that the embedding region becomes a 2-sphere with three singular points , representing the boundary and each of the throats .",
    "let us suppose that we can put a single family of characteristics on this 2-sphere , starting from the boundary and ending only at the throats .",
    "the tangent vectors to the characteristics ( pointing in the direction of propagation of the solution ) constitute a vector field having no singularities or zeroes except at the boundary and at the throats . at the boundary , the tangent vectors all point outward , while at the throats , they all point inward ( if the specification of additional boundary conditions is to be advoided )",
    ". the index of the vector field@xcite would then be + 1 at each of these points , and the total index of the vector field would equal 3 .",
    "but the poincar index theorem@xcite requires that the index of a vector field on a manifold equal the euler characteristic @xmath114 of the manifold . for a 2-sphere",
    ", the euler characteristic @xmath115 , so the tangent field to the family of characteristics is impossible",
    ". a simple generalization of this argument shows that problems must develop in the embedding of negative gaussian curvature initial data for any number of holes other than unity .",
    "it remains to determine the precise nature of the inescapable breakdown in the propagation of the characteristics .",
    "it can not be due to a geometric singularity .",
    "the _ intrinsic _ geometry of the embedded surface is fixed , of course , by the requirement that it be isometric to the nonsingular misner 2-geometry .",
    "we are carefully studying the _ extrinsic _ geometry of the embedded surface that we generate numerically , and we have found no evidence , so far , that any singularity is developing as the characteristics approach the point of breakdown .",
    "the actual nature of the breakdown is suggested by our argument above about the incompatible directions of characteristics .",
    "the breakdown occurs when characteristics of the same family cross each other , as in the classic example of shocks in gas flow .",
    "at such crossings there are three characteristic directions ( two from the crossed characteristics , and one from the characteristic of the other family ) and the propagation of the solution can not proceed .",
    "figure 3 shows a detail of the numerical results for the propagation of characteristics in the extreme case @xmath116 . to the left of the crossing at @xmath117 the results are valid ; to the right , the results are meaningless .",
    "although the development of these `` embedding shocks '' ( i.e. , characteristic crossings ) block the computation of the embedding in an inner region of the geometry , we can still compute the outer region and obtain most of the visually useful information .",
    "figure 4 shows the outline of the embedded surface ( a view along the @xmath118 axis ) for the cases @xmath119 and @xmath120 .",
    "a clear geometric distinction is apparent . for the @xmath120 case , the structure close in ( in the region @xmath121 )",
    "is that of two throats . on a larger scale",
    "the geometry takes on the character of a single schwarzschild throat .",
    "the shape of the @xmath119 case is quite different .",
    "though it has the same `` trousers '' topology as that of @xmath120 , the steep sides of the embedding near @xmath122 mean that there is no region in which the individual throats look like more - or - less isolated holes . a 3-dimensional plot of the @xmath120 geometry is presented in fig .",
    "the development of  embedding shocks \" is the most interesting feature of the problem of embedding the everywhere - negative gaussian curvature misner 2-geometry .",
    "the primary question to be asked about them is whether it is inevitable that a  forbidden region \" develop towards the crotch of the embedding , cut off from the outer region by the embedding shock .",
    "the topological arguments of the previous section clearly establish that _ something _ must go wrong with the characteristics , but the failure could be confined to the symmetry axis joining the throats , at which the characteristics meet with incompatible directions of forward propagation . in effect , the",
    " forbidden region \" could be degenerate , with zero area .",
    "this is not , of course , what our numerical results show , but the location of the embedding shock depends on the initial data .",
    "a correct small change in the initial data might shift the location of the embedding shock inward , reducing the area of the forbidden region ; the precisely correct initial data might even reduce the forbidden region to a line .",
    "we have numerically studied the effect on the shock location of the precise form of the initial data .",
    "the results strongly suggest that no improvement of the cauchy data can significantly reduce the size of the forbidden region .",
    "[ there is an additional point that must be added in connection with this .",
    "part of the problem in the oval - shaped breakdown may be a technical difficulty that develops when the generated surface becomes vertical",
    ". this would be most expected near the @xmath123 plane at the outer edge of the throats .",
    "this problem , however , is causally disconnected from the breakdown near the @xmath124 plane , so the breakdown can not wholly be a simple technical flaw in the approach .",
    "we are also studying this point , and developing a numerical technique for avoiding this problem , which may be inherent to the darboux approach . ]",
    "suppose that somehow or another we _ were _ able to reduce the size of the forbidden region to that of zero area . what would be the implication of such a degenerate embedding shock ?",
    "it would mean that the embedding diagram is uniquely determined by the initial data on the ( approximately ) circular outer boundary .",
    "that information would propagate inward unambiguously creating the embedding surface in its wake , until it hits the central degenerate shock . whether the surface generated from one side and that generated from the other",
    "meet smoothly at this line is not guaranteed .",
    "the degenerate embedding shock would then be a sort of zero measure failure of the local isometric embedding to be global .",
    "this leads us to point out that theorems on the existence of global embeddings are notoriously nonexistent .",
    "there is no _ a priori _ reason to suspect that a global embedding of the misner geometry either does or does not exist .",
    "if a global embedding does not exist , then an attempt to start at an outer circular boundary and propagate inward is doomed to incompleteness .",
    "we could , of course , start with inner data , and propagate the embedding diagram outward . but to discuss why we choose not to do this , it is useful at this point to review what we are trying to accomplish with the embedding . to help in the visualization of the physics , the embedding diagram must have the character of a single throat at large radii , and in some sense must represent the idea of two holes at smaller radii .",
    "if a global embedding is impossible , then a diagram started from the central region would be guaranteed , at large radii , to look nothing like the embedding diagram of a single schwarzschild throat . while there might be some uses to a diagram which represents the inner regions of the misner geometry , at least for the visualization of initial data for black hole collisions",
    ", it would seem much more important to have the desired features at large radii , than in the inner region .    in the discussion above",
    ", we have assumed that the forbidden region surrounded by the embedding shock can be reduced to a line , but this may very well not be the case .",
    "what if the embedding shocks are unavoidable features that separate the outer region from a nondegenerate inner region ?",
    "the mathematical parallel between such embedding shocks and the more familiar shocks in gas flow are revealing . in the simplest gas shocks ,",
    "called `` kinematic shocks , '' the equation of continuity , along with a relation between propagation velocity and density , leads to a crossing of characteristics@xcite .",
    "one then argues that the mathematical description is only an approximation to the true physics , and that the approximation breaks down at the shock formation . in principle , one can turn to a more complete description of the physics , such as the navier - stokes equation , to arrive at a mathematical formulation without singularities .",
    "the simpler approximate mathematics will be adequate on both sides of the shock ; the more complete mathematical description will tell us how to `` cross '' it .",
    "that is , how to make the physically appropriate match of the two approximate solutions across the shock .",
    "this sort of strategy is inapplicable to embedding shocks .",
    "the darboux equation is not an approximation ; there is not a more complete geometric description that can tell us how to cross the shocks `` correctly . ''",
    "but there is another view of shock - crossing conditions that may be of use . without reference to a more complete description of the physics , the crossing conditions for gas shocks can be inferred from conservations laws . in the simple case of kinematic shocks ,",
    "the crossing conditions follow when mass - conservation at the shock is invoked . the resulting solution ( without reference to more detailed physics )",
    "is then understood to be a `` weak '' solution  i.e . ,",
    "one which contains singularities , but for which the differential equation is satisfied when it is integrated over any region , including the region of the shock front@xcite .",
    "what then is the geometric analogy in the case of embeddings ?",
    "this question is presently being investigated .",
    "for now we can only point to some interesting speculations .",
    "we note that for a sufficiently smooth surface , with extrinsic curvature everywhere defined and continuous , there can be no shocks , whether crossed correctly or not .",
    "it is interesting , however , to consider an embedding function @xmath125 in which there are special curves along which the second derivatives of @xmath14 are bounded but discontinuous .",
    "such a surface would be smooth ( i.e. , it would have no creases ) but along the special curves , the extrinsic curvature would be discontinuous .",
    "at these special curves the directions of the characteristics ( which are constrained by the extrinsic curvature ) would be multiple - valued .",
    "one might imagine that such a surface would be a local isometry to the misner geometry except along the special curves , and it is tempting to think that this , or some related geometric phenomenon , would represent a weak solution to the embedding problem and the analogy of gas shocks .",
    "for the present , we point out that the embedding shocks do not preclude a partial solution of the embedding problem , which is potentially useful for visual and physical insight .",
    "an example is the question of the applicability of perturbation theory to black hole collisions .",
    "if the black holes are initially close together ( i.e. , if @xmath79 is sufficiently small ) the initial geometry _ outside the horizon _ is nearly spherical .",
    "the highly nonspherical geometry inside the horizon does not influence the time evolution of the spacetime ouside , so the evolution , and the generation of outgoing gravitational radiation , can be treated as a problem in perturbations of the spherical geometry of a single schwarzschild throat .",
    "an important question is : how small must @xmath79 be for perturbation theory to be valid ? as @xmath79 decreases below @xmath126 the topology of the horizon on the initial cauchy hypersurface changes from that of two disjoint spheres ( one around each throat ) to that of a single 2-sphere surrounding both throats . only for @xmath79",
    "significantly less than 1.8 will the horizon be reasonably spherical .",
    "yet we know , from comparison with supercomputer evolution of the fully nonlinear equations@xcite , that perturbation theory works rather well for values of @xmath79 even somewhat larger than 1.8 .",
    "the explanation would seem to lie in the the fact that nonsphericity just ouside the horizon disappears down the horizon . in the theory of perturbations of the schwarzschild geometry@xcite",
