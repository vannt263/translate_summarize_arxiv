    "the accuracy of the experimental results is generally within a factor of 2 , which is of the same order of the typical discrepancy between theory and experiment .",

    "concerning the prefactor of the ziman formula , since one has @xmath117 ( jensen s inequality for convex functions ) and assuming that this dependence overcomes the one from the scattering cross - section , the resistivity averaged over scs is expected to be larger than the one obtained from the aa model .",
    "however , it is important to keep in mind the fact that the latter prefactor should not be @xmath118 but rather @xmath119 , which could impact the results .",

    "the calculations do not use any model potential , dielectric function or structure data , but proceed via first - principle calculations based on density - functional theory in the local - density approximation .",
    "the electronic structure of an average scatterer is determined solving schdinger s equation .",
