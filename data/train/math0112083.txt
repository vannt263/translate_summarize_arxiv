    "the rapid progress in constructing high performance computers gives great impetus to the development of innovative high order computational methods for solving problems in computational fluid dynamics ( cfd ) . with high - order numerical methods ,",
    "complex flow structures are expected to be resolved more accurately in both space and time . for flow problems with sophisticate structures ,",
    "high resolution is a must in order for the structural information to be correctly extracted .",
    "high order numerical resolution is of crucial importance in all kinds of simulations of turbulence .",
    "for example , direct numerical simulation ( dns ) of turbulence is one of the typical situations where high resolution schemes are definitely required because the amplitude of the fourier response of the velocity field is continuously distributed over a wide range of wavenumbers .",
    "the situation is more complex in the large eddy simulation ( les ) , where the energy spectrum is not only continuous , but also slow decaying at sufficiently high wavenumbers . unlike a linear problem , the numerical error of the @xmath0th order",
    "finite difference scheme is not linearly scaled with the power of grid size @xmath1 .",
    "thus numerical errors have to be strictly controlled by choosing a grid which is much smaller than the smallest spatial structure in turbulent motion@xcite .",
    "the simulation become more difficult as the reynolds number increases . for incompressible euler flows , although the total kinetic energy is conserved , its spectral distribution of the solution could move towards the high frequency end with respect to the time evolution . as a consequence ,",
    "the integration will collapse at a sufficiently long time with a finite computational grid due to the limited high frequency resolution of a given scheme .",
    "nevertheless , a higher resolution scheme can dramatically improve the stability of the numerical iterations compared with a lower resolution one because of its ability to better resolve the high frequency components . using three candidate schemes ,",
    "i.e. , a second - order finite difference scheme , a forth - order finite difference scheme and a pseudospectral scheme , browning and kreiss@xcite demonstrated that in the long - time dns of turbulence , only the forth - order scheme can yield results comparable with those of the pseudospectral scheme .",
    "apart from the dns and les of turbulence , computational aeroacoustics ( caa ) is another area where high resolution schemes are highly demanded for the simulation of waves with large spectral bandwidth and amplitude disparity@xcite . for an imperfectly expanded supersonic jet",
    ", the strouhal number ranges from @xmath2 to @xmath3 .",
    "the velocity fluctuation of the radiated sound wave can be four orders of magnitude smaller than that of the mean flow .",
    "therefore , the real space and time numerical simulation of turbulence flow and sound wave interaction in an open area and long time process is still a severe challenge to practitioners of caa .",
    "obviously , high resolution schemes can be used to alleviate the demanding on a dense mesh in this situation .",
    "the concept of high resolution is subjective . for a given scheme",
    ", it might provide a relatively high resolution for one problem but fail doing so for another problem .",
    "yang et al@xcite show that for the heat equation , a local scheme delivers higher accuracy than the fourier pseudospectral method , while the latter achieves better accuracy in solving the wave equation .",
    "essentially , the pseudospectral method possesses the highest numerical resolution for approximating bandlimited periodic @xmath4 functions .",
    "however , it might not be the most accurate method for other problems .",
    "it is noted that much argument given to the numerical resolution of computational schemes in the literature is analyzed with respect to the discrete fourier transform .",
    "such a resolution should be called _ fourier resolution _ and differs much from the numerical resolution in general .",
    "it is commonly believed that a scheme of high fourier resolution , i.e. , it provides a good approximation to the fourier transform of the derivative operators over a wider range of wavenumbers , will perform well in numerical computations .",
    "although the results of discrete fourier analysis might be consistent with the numerical resolution and be useful for a large class of problems , they are strictly valid only for bandlimited periodic @xmath4 functions .",
    "for example , the fourier resolution of the standard finite difference schemes is not very high as given by the fourier analysis . however , the standard finite difference schemes are the exact schemes for approximating appropriate polynomials .    there are two approaches to obtain high resolutions in a numerical computation .",
    "one is to employ a spectral method , such as the pseudospectral or chebyshev method . in general spectral methods",
    "provide very high numerical resolution for a wide variety of physical problems . however , they often have stringent constraints on applicable boundary conditions and geometries .",
    "the other approach is to modified the coefficients of the standard finite difference scheme so that the high frequency components of a function are better approximated under the cost of the approximation accuracy for the low wavenumbers .",
    "typical examples include the compact scheme @xcite and dispersion relation preserving ( drp ) scheme @xcite .",
    "fourier analysis of the both schemes indicates that they can give a better representation in a broader wavenumber range than their central difference counterparts .",
    "therefore , they might yield a good resolution for small flow structures in a more stable manner .",
    "these modified finite difference schemes are very popular and give better numerical results for many physical problems .",
    "the presence of shock waves adds an extra level of difficulty to the seeking of high resolution solutions .",
    "formally , a shock will lead to a first - order error which will propagate to the region away from the discontinuity in a solution obtained by using a high order method@xcite .",
    "therefore , the attainable overall order of resolution is limited .",
    "however , for a given problem , the approximation accuracy achieved by using a high resolution scheme can be much higher than that obtained by using a low resolution scheme . in the context of shock - capturing",
    ", high resolution refers this property not only in smooth regions but also in regions as close to the discontinuity as possible .",
    "one of popular high order shock - capturing schemes is an essential non - oscillatory ( eno ) scheme@xcite .",
    "the key idea of the eno scheme is to suppress spurious oscillations near the shock or discontinuities , while maintaining a higher - order accuracy at smooth regions .",
    "this approach was further extended into a weighted essentially non - oscillatory ( weno ) scheme@xcite .",
    "the weno approach takes a linear combination of a number of high - order schemes of both central difference and up - wind type .",
    "the central difference type of schemes has a larger weight factor at the smooth region while the up - wind type of schemes plays a major role near the shock or discontinuity .",
    "the arbitrarily high order schemes which utilize the hyperbolic riemann problem for the advection of the higher order derivatives ( ader)@xcite and monotonicity preserving weno scheme@xcite are the most recent attempts in developing higher - order shock - capturing schemes .",
    "these schemes are very efficient for many hyperbolic conservation law systems .",
    "one of the most difficult situations in the cfd is the interaction of shock waves and turbulence , which occurs commonly in high speed flows such as buffeting , air intaking and jet exhaust .",
    "many high order shock - capturing schemes are found to be too dissipative to be applicable for the long - time integration of such flows@xcite . in the framework of free decaying turbulence ,",
    "the effect of a subgrid - scale model was masked by some high - order shock - capturing schemes .",
    "excessive dissipation degrades the numerical resolution and smears small - scale structures .",
    "typically , there are two ways to reduce the excessive numerical dissipation .",
    "one is to rely on shock sensors for switching on - off dissipative terms locally .",
    "the spatial localization of the sensors is crucial to the success of the approach . in the framework of synchronization ,",
    "a set of interesting nonlinear sensors was proposed@xcite for achieving optimal localization automatically .",
    "the other approach is to develop low dissipation schemes , such as filter schemes .",
    "in fact , a filter , or a dissipative term , can be extracted from a regular scheme , such as the eno .",
    "such a term can be combined with another high - order non - dissipative scheme , such as a central difference scheme , to construct a new shock - capturing scheme @xcite .",
    "the overall dissipation of the new scheme can be controlled by using an appropriate switch .",
    "numerical experiments have shown that these schemes can be of higher accuracy and less dissipative than the original shock - capturing schemes@xcite .",
    "recently , a conjugate filter oscillation reduction ( cfor ) has been proposed as a nearly optimal approach for treating hyperbolic conservation laws@xcite .",
    "the cfor seeks a uniform high resolution both in approximating derivatives and in filtering spurious oscillations .",
    "the conjugated filters are constructed by using the discrete singular convolution ( dsc ) algorithm , which provides a spectral - like resolution in a smooth region .",
    "moreover , the accuracy of the dsc algorithm is controllable by adjusting the width of the computational support . from the point of signal processing ,",
    "the dsc approximations of derivatives are high - pass filters , whereas , spurious oscillations are removed by using a conjugate low - pass filter , without resort to upwind type of dissipative terms .",
    "the low - pass and high - pass filters are conjugated in the sense that they are generated from the same dsc kernel expression .",
    "the resolution of the cfor scheme is therefore determined by the common effective frequency band of the high - pass and low - pass filters .",
    "the effective frequency band is the wavenumber region on which both low - pass and high - pass filters have correct frequency responses . although , the errors produced at a discontinuity are still of the first order , their absolute values are very small due the use of the high resolution cfor scheme .",
    "there are a variety of dsc kernels that can be used for realizing the cfor scheme@xcite .",
    "in fact , these kernels might exhibit very different characteristic in numerical computations , in particular , for shock - capturing .",
    "the latter is very sensitive to the property of dsc kernels .",
    "so far , the most widely used kernels is the regularized shannon kernel ( rsk)@xcite . the success of the rsk in numerical computations , particularly , in shock capturing , motivates us to search for new dsc kernels which might have more desirable features for certain aspects of shock - capturing . indeed , hermite kernel ( hk )",
    "is a very special candidate@xcite . compared with the rsk , the hermite kernel has a narrow effective frequency band but its low - pass filter better approximates the idea low - pass filter .",
    "as such , we speculate that the hermite kernel should have a resolution similar to the rsk in the smooth flow region and might have better overall performance in the presence of shock .",
    "extensive numerical tests are given in this paper to explore the utility and potential of the cfor - hermite scheme .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we give a brief introduction to the dsc algorithm and hermite kernel . the cfor scheme based on the hermite kernel",
    "is also described in this section .",
    "the time marching schemes are discussed .",
    "extensive numerical results are presented in section iii to demonstrate the use of the cfor - hermite and to explore its resolution limit .",
    "concluding remarks are given in section iv .",
    "this section present the spatiotemporal discretizations of a flow equation .",
    "fourier analysis is carried out for both the low - pass and high - pass filters generated from the hermite kernel .",
    "time marching schemes are described after the introduction to the discrete singular convolution ( dsc ) and conjugate filter oscillation reduction ( cfor ) scheme .",
    "discrete singular convolution ( dsc ) is an effective approach for the numerical realization of singular convolutions , which occurs commonly in science and engineering .",
    "the dsc algorithm has been widely used in computational science in recent years . in this section",
    "we will give a brief review on the dsc algorithm before introducing a new kernel , the hermite kernel .",
    "for more details of the background and application of the dsc algorithm in partial difference equations , the reader is referred to refs .",
    "@xcite .    in the context of distribution theory ,",
    "a singular convolution can be defined by @xmath5 where @xmath6 is a singular kernel and @xmath7 is an element of the space of test functions .",
    "interesting examples include singular kernels of hilbert type , abel type and delta type . the former two play important roles in the theory of analytical functions , processing of analytical signals , theory of linear responses and radon transform . since delta type kernels are the key element in the theory of approximation and the numerical solution of differential equations , we focus on the singular kernels of delta type @xmath8 where superscript @xmath9 denotes the @xmath0th - order `` derivative '' of the delta distribution , @xmath10 , with respect to @xmath11 , which should be understood as generalized derivatives of distributions . when @xmath12 , the kernel , @xmath13 , is important for the interpolation of surfaces and curves , including applications to the design of engineering structures . for hyperbolic conservation laws and euler systems , two special cases , @xmath12 and @xmath14",
    "are involved , whereas for the full naiver - stokes equations , the case of @xmath15 will be also invoked . because of its singular nature , the singular convolution of eq .",
    "( [ dsc1 ] ) can not be directly used for numerical computations .",
    "in addition , the restriction to the test function is too strict for most practical applications . to avoid the difficulty of using singular expressions directly in numerical computations , we consider a sequence of approximations of the form @xmath16 where @xmath17 are a family of parameters which characterize the approximation and @xmath18 are generalized limits .",
    "at least one of the parameters in eq .",
    "( [ deltakn2 ] ) has to take a limit .",
    "one of the most commonly used dsc kernels is the regularized shannon kernel ( rsk ) @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the grid spacing and @xmath21 characterizes width of the gaussian envelop .",
    "the regularity of the kernel approximation can be improved by using a gaussian regularizer .",
    "obviously , for a given @xmath22 , the limit of @xmath23 reproduces the delta distribution . numerical approximation to a function @xmath24 ( low - pass filtering ) and its @xmath0th derivative ( high - pass filtering ) are realized by the following discrete convolution algorithm @xmath25 where @xmath26 are a set of discrete grid points which are centered at @xmath11 , and @xmath27 is the computational bandwidth , or effective kernel support , which is usually smaller than the entire computational domain .    in this work",
    ", we consider the hermite function expansion of the delta distribution@xcite @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the usual hermite polynomial .",
    "the delta distribution is recovered by taking the limit @xmath30 .",
    "the hermite function expansion of the dirac delta distribution was proposed by korevaar@xcite over forty years ago and was considered by hoffman _",
    "al . _ for wave propagations@xcite .",
    "further discussion of its connections to wavelets and the dsc algorithm can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite(b ) . just like other dsc kernels , the expression ( [ hermite ] ) is a low - pass filter , see fig .",
    "[ compfig1 ] .",
    "its approximation to the idea low - pass filter is effectively controlled by the parameter @xmath21 .",
    "the @xmath0th order derivative is readily given by the analytical differentiation of expression ( [ hermite ] ) with the use of recursion relations @xmath31 in numerical applications , optimal results are usually obtained if the gaussian window size @xmath21 varies as a function of the central frequency @xmath32 , such that @xmath33 is a parameter chosen in computations . in fig .",
    "[ compfig1 ] , we plot the frequency responses of both the regularized shannon kernel ( rsk ) and hermite kernel ( hk ) .",
    "it is seen that the effective frequency band of the rsk is slightly wider than that of the hk .",
    "the most distinctive difference of these two kernels occurs in their low - pass filters .",
    "compared with the rsk , the hk low - pass filters decay fast at high wavenumbers and thus better approximate the ideal low - pass filter . as a result , they are expected to remove high - frequency errors much more efficiently .",
    "the ramification of these differences in numerical computations is examined extensively in the next section .",
    "the essence of the cfor scheme is the following .",
    "since the dsc high - pass filters have a limited effective frequency band , short wavelength numerical errors will be produced when these high - pass filters are used for numerical differentiations .",
    "conjugate low - pass filters are designed to remove such errors .",
    "the resulting solution should be reliable over the effective frequency band , i.e. , the low wavenumber region on which both high - pass and low - pass filters are very accurate .",
    "a total variation diminishing ( tvd ) switch is used to activate the low - pass filter whenever the total variation of the approximate solution exceeds a prescribed criteria . by adjusting the parameter @xmath34 in the low - pass filter which determines the effective frequency band with a given dsc kernel",
    ", the oscillation near the shock can be reduced efficiently .",
    "since the dsc - hermite kernel is nearly interpolative , the low - pass filter in the cfor scheme is implemented via prediction ( @xmath35 ) and restoration ( @xmath36 ) @xcite .",
    "the cfor scheme with the rsk has been successfully applied to a variety of standard problems , such as inviscid burgers equation , sod and lax problems , shock - tube problems , flow past a forward facing step and the shock / entropy wave interaction@xcite .      in this work ,",

    "more detail of the scheme can be found ref .",
    "for all the other systems , a standard forth - order runge - kutta scheme is employed for time integrations .",

    "in this section , a few benchmark numerical problems , including , the incompressible 2d euler flow , a 1d wave equation , 1d and 2d compressible euler systems , are employed to test shock - capturing capability of the proposed cfor - hermite scheme and to examine the numerical resolution of the scheme .",

    "the extension of this problem to the test of resolution can be found in ref .",
    "since the viscous term leads to the dissipation of the initial wave , the long - time evolution accuracy of a numerical scheme can be masked by the viscous decay . in the present computation",
    ", we consider the incompressible euler version of this problem , i.e. taylor problem without the viscous term .    with a periodic boundary condition , the 2d time dependent incompressible euler equation admits the following exact solution @xmath43 [ taylorsol ] where @xmath44 denote the velocity in @xmath11- and @xmath45-directions and the pressure , respectively .",
    "here @xmath46 is the wavenumber of the velocity solution .",
    "note that the wavenumber of the pressure is twice as much as that of the velocity .",

    "the ppw is a good measure of the numerical resolution for many problems of wave nature .",
    "comparison is also carried out between the regularized shannon kernel ( rsk ) and the hermite kernel , since we speculate that for this smooth problem the rsk should have a better performance with a high wavenumber due to its wider effective frequency band as shown in fig .",
    "[ taylorfig1 ] .",
    "the results in table [ taylortab1 ] exhibit high accuracy of the dsc algorithm , realized both by the rsk and hk .",
    "it is not surprising that with the increase of the wavenumber @xmath46 , the accuracy of the numerical scheme degrades due to the finite effective frequency band . in fig .",

    "the accuracy of the final results is eventually limited by the fourier resolution , i.e. , the effective frequency band of the kernel .",
    "first , we note that results in table [ taylortab1 ] are qualitatively consistent with the analysis in fig .",
    "[ taylorfig1 ] .",
    "for example , the analysis indicates that the rsk has a better fourier resolution than the rk .",

    "the errors of numerical results are also about @xmath54 and thus match the fourier analysis .",
    "in general , there is a good consistence between the prediction of fourier analysis and the experimental results for the rsk . in a dramatic case ,",
    "the ppw ratio is reduced to 2.1 , which is very close to the nyquist limit of 2 .",
    "it is noted that the cfor - rsk still performs very well for this case .",
    "this confirms the spectral nature of the cfor - rsk scheme .    for the hermite kernel ,",
    "the errors at @xmath55 and 26 are slightly smaller than those predicted by the fourier analysis .",
    "this discrepancy is due to the fact that the actual errors measured are for the velocity rather than for the pressure .",
    "the pressure error might not _ fully _ propagate to the velocity because only the pressure gradient contributes to velocity changes . comparing with the rsk",
    ", the hermite kernel has a narrow effective frequency band , and thus performs not as well as the rsk .",
    "however , a careful examination on the fig .",
    "[ compfig1 ] reveals that the hermite kernel has a sharp decay in its conjugate low - pass filter as the wavenumber increases .",

    "extensive numerical examples are employed to access the accuracy , test the stability , demonstrate the usefulness and most importantly , examine the resolution of the present cfor - hermite scheme .",
    "our test cases cover four types of flow systems : 2d incompressible euler systems , 1d linear advective equation , 2d compressible euler systems and 1d shock / entropy wave interaction .",
    "comparison is made between the rsk and hermite kernel for the 2d incompressible flow .",
    "the dsc - rsk scheme performs better than the dsc - hermite for smooth initial values .",

    "it is about @xmath109 times more accurate than some popular shock - capturing schemes in the advancement of a 2d isentropic vortex flow .",
    "its advantage over the cfor - rsk scheme is exemplified in predicting the shock / entropy wave interaction , where reliable results are attained at about 5 ppw .",
