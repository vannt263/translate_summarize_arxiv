    "scattering of composite projectiles such as the deuteron off a composite target nucleus can in principle be described by the n - body scattering theories ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) , which allow the simultaneous treatment of all reaction channels ( including partial and complete breakup ) in an exact , unique , n - particle - unitarity - preserving manner .",
    "these n - body equations can be reduced to two - cluster equations , as proposed for the first time in ref .",
    "@xcite , the only input necessary being the elementary two - body transition amplitudes .",
    "however , due to the inherent complexity of the resulting equations it is always desirable to take resort to some kind of simplifying approach . for reactions in which , besides two - body , also three - body channels are known to be important a promising candidate is the three - body faddeev integral equations theory written in the alt - grassberger - sandhas ( ags ) form @xcite .",
    "but even the three - body ags equations are so complicated that a more simplified cdcc approach became quite popular in the last 30 years ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "of course , this approach does no longer constitute a rigorous theory , the approximative character becoming the more apparent the more important the internal degrees of freedom are which can be excited in the energy domain under consideration .",
    "if the internal structure of the target can no longer be neglected , in order to still be able to work with the manageable three - body theory , the possibility of excitation must - at least approximately - be taken into account . for the first time it has been done in @xcite .",
    "deuteron stripping processes off a target nucleus consisting of @xmath1 nucleons were treated within the framework of the generalized few - body faddeev integral equations theory written in the ags form .",
    "generalization of the ags equations is achieved by taking into account the excitation of the target . to reduce the @xmath2-particle problem to the much simpler three - body problem all the operators acting in the @xmath2-particle space were projected onto the three - particle space .",
    "obtained generalized faddeev equations couple all rearrangement ( reaction ) , inelastic and elastic amplitudes .",
    "the transition amplitudes for all interesting three - body processes were obtained , whether the target nucleus is in its ground or in some excited state before and/or after the collision .",
    "the practical application was done for the deuteron stripping reaction @xmath5 at the deuteron bombarding energies of @xmath6 and @xmath7 mev .",
    "the two - body - type t - operators for the nucleon - nucleus subsystem were calculated from multichannel equations to account for the excitation and de - excitation of the nucleus in nucleon - nucleus scattering . when inserted in the three - body - type integral equations this feature",
    "is automatically introduced also into the three - body dynamics .",
    "the complexity of the ags equations is significantly reduced by using separable potential approach for @xmath4 and @xmath8 interactions . however , the coulomb @xmath9 interaction was neglected when solving the ags equations and was taken into account only approximately by multiplying each calculated purely nuclear , partial wave reaction amplitudes by the initial- and final - state coulomb distortion factors before summing up the partial wave series .",
    "definitely , in such an approach we neglect the coulomb - modified vertex form factors describing the subsystem @xmath9 and effective potentials in the ags approach described by the triangular diagrams containing the coulomb @xmath9 scattering amplitude as the four - ray vertex .",
    "after our work @xcite a significant advance in the application of the faddeev three - body approach was achieved in works @xcite , where ags equations for stripping reactions on different targets were solved with realistic potentials . in works",
    "@xcite the ags calculations were compared with the adiabatic distorted wave approach ( adwa ) for deuteron stripping reactions to estimate the accuracy of the conventional adwa , which provides a simplified but practical version of the cdcc @xcite .",
    "the advantage of these works compared to our work @xcite was usage of the realistic potentials .",
    "also the coulomb interaction was included using the screening procedure , which has been applied earlier in our work for @xmath10 scattering @xcite .",
    "inclusion of the screening procedure requires higher screening radii when charge of the target increases to get the convergence .",
    "that is why the application of the coulomb potential screening procedure was successful only for targets with charge @xmath11 .",
    "besides , the screening procedure can not be always a reliable remedy to solve problems with charged particles , because limiting the range of the potential may lead to the loss of information about the very nature of the field creating the coulomb potential .",
    "neglect of the internal structure of the target is another setback in the ags calculations in @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we present a new formulation of the generalized faddeev equations in the ags form for the deuteron stripping , which includes explicitly the coulomb interactions and target excitations .",
    "the coulomb interaction in the ags approach appears in the three - ray vertex form factors in the effective potentials and in the four - ray vertex in the triangular diagrams .",
    "applying the two - potential equation allows us to remove the non - compact singularity in the triangular diagram describing the elastic scattering and containing the @xmath9 coulomb scattering amplitude . besides the ags equations can be rewritten in the coulomb distorted wave representation @xcite , in which the reaction amplitudes and the effective potentials are sandwiched by the coulomb distorted waves in the initial and final states . applying the regularization procedure",
    "we obtain the expression for the effective potentials in the ags equations , which are free of the singularities caused by the coulomb distortions in the initial and final states .",
    "we also investigate the off - shell coulomb scattering amplitude and show that the coulomb - modified form factors in the transfer amplitudes and in the triangular diagrams do nt contain non - integrable singularities .",
    "the target excitation is taken into account following the formalism developed in @xcite .",
    "the final generalized matrix ags equations are written in the form which includes explicitly coulomb interactions , target excitations and spins of the particles . because the solution of the ags equations is greatly simplified for separable potentials , we use separable potential approach assuming that the adopted separable potentials will approximate realistic potentials @xmath4 and @xmath8 potentials . the calculations of the obtained equations and comparison with the experimental data will be presented in the following up papers .",
    "it is important to underscore that ags equations in the coulomb distorted wave representation have been derived for the first time .",
    "previously possibility of derivation of these equations in the coulomb distorted wave representation was considered in @xcite , but obtained equations were not genuine integral equations because the amplitudes under the integral and on the left - hand side were different functions . here ,",
    "using a different off - shell continuation we derive genuine ags equations in the coulomb distorted wave representation .",
    "another important topic of our research is investigation of the singularities of the integrals containing the off - shell coulomb scattering amplitude .",
    "the compactness of the ags equations for charged particles with repulsive interactions was proved in @xcite .",
    "however , the practical application of this result requires regularization of the integrals containing the off - shell coulomb scattering amplitudes .",
    "note that in the case under consideration , when only two particles are charged , only one off - shell coulomb scattering amplitude of the proton - nucleus scattering is needed .",
    "regularization of the integrals containing the off - shell coulomb scattering amplitude is also important because in a standard procedure involving the screening of the coulomb potential is tacitly assumed that , in the limit of the screening radius @xmath12 , all the integrals containing coulomb scattering amplitude have well - defined limits and that the coulomb screening affects only the coulomb distorted waves in the initial and final states .",
    "we show how to deal with all the integrals containing the coulomb off - shell t - matrix .",
    "the obtained equations are suitable for calculations and the results will be presented in the following up papers .",
    "the advantage of the developed approach is that , owe to the explicit including of the coulomb interaction , it can be applied for analysis of the deuteron stripping on heavier nuclei .",
    "such reactions provide a unique tool to study @xmath13 processes on exotic nuclei , which are important for nuclear astrophysics and applied physics .",
