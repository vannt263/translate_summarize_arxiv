    "learning to solve the geodesic and geodesic deviation equations is an integral part of a first course on general relativity .",
    "however , most texts on general relativity@xcite do not contain a sufficient number of solvable examples that illustrate the behavior of geodesics in a nontrivial geometry .",
    "this lack is largely due to the fact that the geodesic equations as well as the geodesic deviation equations are not easy to solve exactly in most of the standard geometries of interest .",
    "a traditional example is the case of the line element on the surface of a two - dimensional sphere for which the geodesic and the geodesic deviation equations can be solved analytically .",
    "some other exactly solvable examples in two dimensions include rindler spacetime , the line element on a cylinder and the hyperbolic plane .    in this article",
    ", we will discuss a two - dimensional example ( with a diagonal line element of lorentzian signature ( @xmath0@xmath1 ) , i.e. of the form @xmath2 , with @xmath3 everywhere negative and @xmath4 , positive ) , for which , like the sphere , there are exact solutions for geodesics as well as geodesic deviation .",
    "the line element for this example arises in the context of the stringy black holes.@xcite in fact , this is the geometry of the first stringy black hole discovered in the early nineties by mandal et al.@xcite we will not go into the details of how this line element is obtained .",
    "interested readers may read the original references@xcite to enlighten themselves on this aspect .",
    "for our purposes here , the line element represents a geometry that is given to us , and we see that there are exact solutions for geodesics and geodesic deviation for test particles moving in this geometry .",
    "we begin by writing down the line element of interest@xcite : @xmath5 where m is equivalent to @xmath6 with the choice of units @xmath7 and @xmath8 . similarly @xmath9 is required to have dimensions of length squared in order to render the metric coefficient @xmath10 dimensionless .    the domain for the radial coordinate is @xmath11 and @xmath12 is allowed to vary from @xmath13 .",
    "the physical meaning of the constants @xmath14 and @xmath9 can be explained in the context of two - dimensional string theory . for completeness ( and also with the risk of introducing some unexplained jargon ) , we mention that @xmath14 is related to mass and @xmath9 to the central charge parameter .",
    "several purely geometrical facts about this line element are worth noting . at @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 . if @xmath18 , the signs of @xmath19 and @xmath10 are interchanged .",
    "readers familiar with some general relativity ( say , the schwarzschild solution ) would call @xmath15 the horizon and thereby , characterize the line element as a black hole provided there exists a singularity ( which is the case here , as we shall see later ) inside the horizon ( that is , in the region @xmath18 ) .",
    "as the title of this article suggests , the geometry represents a two - dimensional black hole .",
    "as is common knowledge , a black hole is a region from where nothing can escape .",
    "if an object falls into a black hole ( that is , the object crosses the horizon ) , the object ends up getting stretched and torn apart by the gravitational forces within .",
    "this distortion is quantified through the deviation of geodesics .",
    "the ultimate fate is collapse into a singularity where the matter density is infinitely large , thereby being a region of extreme curvature .",
    "we shall concern ourselves with the @xmath20 region .",
    "the pathology in the line element ( that is , @xmath21 ) at @xmath15 is entirely a coordinate artifact ( a poor choice of coordinates ) .",
    "in addition , it is worth noting , that unlike the case for similar but four - dimensional line elements where the horizon is a sphere or some other two - dimensional surface , here it is a point and falling into a black hole is manifest in crossing this point and entering the region of no return .",
    "the spacetime here is undoubtedly very similar to the two - dimensional @xmath22@xmath12 section of the static , spherically symmetric four - dimensional black holes ( like the schwarzschild metric ) .",
    "many of the features of black holes can be understood via this example .",
    "in fact an extensive research literature exists on two - dimensional black holes where interesting phenomena such as hawking radiation and information loss have been discussed ( see ref .   and references therein and ref .  ) .",
    "the line element in eq .",
    "( [ 1 ] ) also can be written in the following form@xcite : @xmath23 where we have used the coordinate transformation @xmath24 .",
    "notice that the singular nature of the metric function @xmath4 at @xmath15 is no longer there in this form of the line element .",
    "a third form of the line element is the kruskal extension or the maximal analytical extension done exactly in the same way as for the schwarzschild metric .",
    "( for details on how to construct kruskal coordinates see any standard text on general relativity . )",
    "if we introduce the coordinates @xmath25 and @xmath26 defined by :    [ 3 ] @xmath27    and @xmath28 , @xmath29 , we can rewrite the line element as : @xmath30    in eq .",

    "in particular , fig .",
    "4 shows the actual radial trajectory @xmath82 as a function of time .",
    "it is not possible to write @xmath22 as an explicit function of @xmath12 because of the nature of the functional dependence of @xmath12 on @xmath40 .",
    "however , we may write @xmath85 by inverting @xmath61 to @xmath86 and then using this function in @xmath87 .",
    "notice that for @xmath88 , the trajectory hovers around the horizon ( extending only up to @xmath89 ) , reaching the value @xmath90 only asymptotically .",
    "however , for @xmath91 there is no such restriction and the trajectory can extend from @xmath14 to @xmath32 .",
    "it should be mentioned that the `` discontinuities '' in some of the plots arise because of the choice of the parameter ( @xmath92 implies that @xmath93 ) and , consequently , the allowed domain of the independent variable .",
    "they are not real discontinuities of the functions , as is apparent from the solutions .",
    "we now consider the geodesic deviation equation in order to analyze the behavior of the spreading of the geodesic curves obtained in sec .",
    "before we discuss the geodesic deviation in the black hole line element , we briefly recall some of the basic notions of geodesic deviation.@xcite    in a curved spacetime geodesics are not the straight lines of our euclidean intuition .",
    "for instance , the geodesics on the surface of a sphere are the great circles . to understand how geodesics are spread out in a spacetime of nontrivial curvature",
    ", we consider a bundle of geodesics around a specific geodesic ( called the central geodesic ) . at every point on this central geodesic",
    "we erect little normals .",
    "this normal is the connecting vector , so - called because as we move along the connecting vector .",
    "we reach neighboring geodesics .",
    "the reader might ask why normal deformations only ?",
    "the answer is that tangential deformations are taken into account through the reparametrisation of the affine parameter @xmath40 , or , in other words , they do not _ deform _ the trajectory to a neighboring one .",
    "it is obvious that the nature of the connecting vector ( or deviation vector ) in a nontrivial spacetime depends crucially on the properties of the spacetime , or more importantly , as it turns out , on its curvature properties .",
    "for instance , on the surface of a sphere , if we look at two neighboring great circle arcs connecting the north and south poles , the distance between them increases , reaches a certain value at the equator , and then decreases untill it reaches a zero value at the other pole .",
    "the deviation vector essentially measures this effect , which is dictated by the properties of the riemann tensor @xmath94 given by : @xmath95 the ricci tensor and the ricci scalar are obtained from the above riemann tensor by appropriate contractions with the metric tensor ( ricci tensor , @xmath96 and ricci scalar , @xmath97 ) .",
    "we know from einstein s general relativity that geometry is equivalent to the presence of a gravitational field .",
    "thus the deviation of trajectories from each other is a measure of the relative gravitational force between the objects moving on these separate , neighboring , trajectories .",
    "we now state the geodesic deviation equation and solve it for the geodesics in the black hole line element , eq .",
    "( [ 1 ] ) , discussed here .    given a geodesic curve ,",
    "we identify the tangent and normal to it as the vectors @xmath98 and @xmath99 respectively .",
    "these satisfy the orthonormality conditions :    [ 20 ] @xmath100    we make the assumptions :    [ 21 ] @xmath101    note that other choices can be made and thus the above definitions in eq .",
    "( [ 21 ] ) are by no means unique . if we substitute the assumptions in eq .",
    "( [ 21 ] ) into the orthonormality conditions eq .",
    "( [ 20 ] ) , we obtain the following relations for @xmath102 and @xmath103 :    @xmath104    therefore the normal vector @xmath105 takes the form :    @xmath106    the equation for the normal deformations @xmath107 ( where @xmath108 , @xmath109 being the deviation vector ) is given by : @xmath110 the nonzero components of riemann tensor in the coordinate frame are given by :    @xmath111    there is actually only one independent component of the riemann tensor in two dimensions ( recall that in @xmath112 dimensions , the number of independent components is @xmath113 ) .",
    "the nonzero ricci tensor components in the coordinate frame ( @xmath114 ) and the ricci scalar ( @xmath115 ) are    @xmath116    the riemann tensor components and ricci scalar diverge as @xmath117 .",
    "the geometry becomes singular as @xmath117 .",
    "however , @xmath118 does not seem to be a preferred point ( in comparison to @xmath119 say ) , a fact that re - emphasizes the point that the pathology at @xmath15 in the line element in eq .",
    "( [ 1 ] ) is largely a coordinate artifact .",
    "of course , the special nature of @xmath15 is that it is a horizon with the metric signature changing sign as we move from @xmath11 to @xmath18 .    if we substitute the riemann tensor components for the two - dimensional black hole line element and use the normal and tangent mentioned in eq .  [ 21 ] , we find that the deviation equation reduces to the following equations for the three cases discussed earlier .",
    "* case 1 : @xmath57*. @xmath120 where @xmath121 .",
    "the two linearly independent solutions to eq .",
    "( [ 27 ] ) are @xmath122    * case 2 : @xmath59*. @xmath123 the solutions are @xmath124    * case 3 : @xmath58*. @xmath125 where @xmath126 . in this case , the solutions are @xmath127 in eqs .",
    "( [ 28 ] ) , ( [ 30 ] ) , and ( [ 32 ] ) , @xmath128 and @xmath129 are separate arbitrary constants in each case .",
    "these constants should be determined by the initial conditions ( that is , the value of the initial separation between a pair of geodesics at a specific value of the affine parameter and the value of the rate of change of the initial separation at the same value of @xmath40 , similar to the conditions for obtaining particular solutions of second - order , linear , ordinary differential equations ) .    now that we have obtained @xmath107 for each case , it is easy to write down the deviation vectors , which are given by @xmath130 ( where @xmath131 ) .",
    "let us now discuss a representative case , say @xmath132 .",
    "the range of @xmath40 ( for @xmath133 ) is between @xmath134 and @xmath135 .",
    "if we consider a pair of neighboring geodesics at say @xmath136 and assume @xmath137 is positive , then we are forced to choose the solution for @xmath107 to be proportional to @xmath138 .",
    "the evolution of @xmath107 then suggests that as we move further and further to larger positive @xmath40 , the geodesics spread out ( diverge ) .",
    "on the other hand , if we assume @xmath137 to be negative , then we must choose the @xmath139 solution , which says that for larger @xmath40 ( which corresponds to larger @xmath22 as well ) , the geodesics converge , at least locally .",
    "however , as we go to larger @xmath40 , @xmath137 also becomes smaller and approaches zero as @xmath140 ( @xmath141 ) .",
    "therefore , ultimately the geodesics become parallel to each other .",
    "it is also useful to note that @xmath142 , the measure of the gravitational force , is like a relative force which acts to change the separation between a pair of neighboring geodesics .",
    "we can easily substitute the values of @xmath40 ( or @xmath143 ) from the expressions of @xmath61 in the geodesic deviation equations  ( [ 27 ] ) , ( [ 29 ] ) , and ( [ 31 ] ) to analyze the nature of the force . as an example , let us consider the case @xmath132 . for @xmath144 ,",
    "the relative force is constant throughout and is given by : @xmath145 whereas for @xmath146 , we have @xmath147 equation  ( [ temp ] ) tells us that the force vanishes as @xmath22 goes to infinity ( recall that the geometry is flat in this limit and the geodesics will become parallel to each other ) , whereas for @xmath148 , it has the value @xmath149 .",
    "a similar analysis can be carried out for the cases with @xmath150 and @xmath151 .    a point worth mentioning here ( without proof )",
    "is that in the above geometry , the geodesics do not seem to converge to a point within a finite value of @xmath40 in any of the cases because of the fact that the ricci scalar is non - negative ( it is zero only when @xmath152 ) . in two dimensions , timelike geodesics",
    "do not converge to a point ( focus ) within a finite value of the affine parameter unless @xmath153.@xcite",
    "in summary , the exact solutions of the geodesic deviation equation can provide us with a better understanding of the nature of the separation between geodesics .",
    "readers can further investigate the deviation vectors in the cases not discussed above in order to improve their understanding of geodesic deviation .",
    "trajectories in two dimensions are of the form @xmath82 .",
    "the nontrivial curvature of the spacetime is responsible for their difference from the usual ` straight lines ' in minkowski spacetime  the solutions to the geodesic equation obtained in the above line element",
    "provide examples .",
    "if we take pairs of trajectories it is obvious that they may converge towards or diverge away from each other  a measure of this effect is geodesic deviation .",
    "we have illustrated this effect in our example above .",
    "our aim has been to provide an example where the geodesic and geodesic deviation equations can be _ exactly _ solved .",
    "it has been shown that for the line element of a two - dimensional black hole , exact , reasonably simple solutions do exist .",
    "we hope that the relevance of the line element , as well as the simplicity of the solutions will attract students and teachers to use this example when teaching a first course in general relativity .",
    "we also mention that , as far as we know , the exact solutions to the geodesic and the geodesic deviation equations do not exist in the literature and might be of some interest to researchers as well .",
    "there are innumerable solutions representing black holes and cosmologies in two - dimensional gravity , most of which have appeared largely in the last decade and a half .",
    "we believe that a carefully chosen section of these line elements can be used as worthwhile teaching tools in a first course on general relativity .",
