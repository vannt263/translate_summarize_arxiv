    "the interplay between different many - body phenomena , such as superconductivity , ferromagnetism , or the kondo effect , has recently attracted a lot of experimental and theoretical attention . a recent experiment of buitelaar  @xcite _ et al .",
    "_ nicely demonstrated that kondo correlations compete with superconductivity in the leads .",
    "the interplay between kondo correlations and itinerant electron ferromagnetism in the electrodes , has theoretically been intensively studied within the last years ,  @xcite initially leading to controversial conclusions .    for effectively single - level quantum dots ( i.e. dots with a level spacing much bigger than the level broadening @xmath0 ) , consensus was found that a finite spin asymmetry in the density of states in the leads results ( in general ) in a splitting and suppression of the kondo resonance .",
    "this is due the spin dependent broadening and renormalization of the dot level position induced by spin - dependent quantum charge fluctuations . in terms of the kondo spin model",
    "it can be treated as an effective exchange interaction between a localized spin on the dot and ferromagnetic leads . moreover",
    ", it was shown that a strong coupling kondo fixed point with a reduced kondo temperature can develop  @xcite even though the dot is coupled to ferromagnetic leads , given an external magnetic field  @xcite or electric field  @xcite ( gate - voltage ) is tuned appropriately .",
    "obviously , in the limit of fully spin polarized leads , when only one spin component is present for energies close to fermi surface ( half - metallic leads ) , the effective screening of the impurity _ can not _ take place any more and the kondo resonance does _ not _ develop .",
    "a part of these theoretical predictions have recently been confirmed in an experiment by pasupathy  @xcite _ et al_. the presence of ferromagnetic leads could also nicely explain the experimental findings of nygrd  @xcite _ et al_.    since the interplay between ferromagnetism and strong correlation effects is one of the important issues in spintronics applications , there are currently many research activities going on in this direction .",
    "the goal is to manipulate the magnetization of a local quantum dot ( i.e. its local spin ) by means of an external parameter , such as an external magnetic field or an electric field ( a gate voltage ) , with a high accuracy .",
    "this would provide a possible method of writing information in a magnetic memory.@xcite since it is extremely difficult to confine a magnetic field such that it only affects the quantum dot under study , it is of big importance to search for alternative possibilities for such a manipulation ( e.  g.  by means of a local gate - voltage as proposed by the authors  @xcite ) .    in this paper",
    "we push forward our previous work by performing a systematic analysis on the dependence of physical quantities on different band structure properties . starting from the simplest case we add the ingredients of a realistic model one - by - one allowing a deeper understanding of the interplay of kondo model and itinerant electron ferromagnetism . in this paper",
    "we extend our recent studies carried out in this direction  @xcite and illustrate the strength of the analytical methods by comparing the results predicted by them to the results obtained by the exact numerical renormalization group ( nrg ) method.@xcite while in refs .",
    "[ ] the dot was attached to ferromagnetic leads with an unrealistic , spin - independent and flat band - with a spin - dependent tunneling amplitude - we generalize this treatment here by allowing for arbitrary density of states ( dos ) shapes .",
    "@xcite in particular , we carefully analyze the consequences of typical dos shapes in the leads on the kondo resonance .",
    "we explain the difference between these shapes and provide simple formulas ( based on perturbative scaling analysis  @xcite ) that explain the numerical results analytically .",
    "we study both the effect of a finite leads spin polarization _ and _ the gate voltage dependence of a single - level quantum dot contacted to ferromagnetic leads with three relevant dos classes : ( i ) for flat bands without stoner - splitting , ( ii ) for flat bands with stoner - splitting and ( iii ) for an energy dependent dos ( also including stoner - splitting ) . for this sake",

    "magnetic order of typical band ferromagnets like fe , co , and ni is mainly related to electron correlation effects in the relatively narrow @xmath34 sub - bands , which only weakly hybridize with @xmath35 and @xmath36 bands @xcite .",
    "we can assume that due to a strong spatial confinement of @xmath37 electron orbitals , the contribution of electrons from @xmath37 sub - bands to transport across the tunnel barrier can be neglected @xcite .",
    "in such a situation the system can be modeled by noninteracting @xcite @xmath38 electrons , which are spin polarized due to the exchange interaction with uncompensated magnetic moments of the completely localized @xmath37 electrons . in mean - field approximation one can model this exchange interaction as an effective molecular field , which removes spin degeneracy in the system of noninteracting conducting electrons , leading to a spin - dependent dos .    _ parallel and antiparallel leads magnetization .  _ in experiments very frequently the electronic transport measurements are performed for two configurations of the leads magnetization direction  @xcite : the parallel and antiparallel alignment . by comparison of electric current for these two configurations one can calculate the tunneling magnetoresistance ( tmr ) important parameter for the application of the magnetic tunnel junction  @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we restrict the leads magnetization direction to be either ( i ) _ parallel _ , i.e. the left and right lead have the dos @xmath39 and @xmath40 respectively , so the total dos corresponding to the total dispersion @xmath41 ( @xmath42 $ ] ) is given by @xmath43 .",

    "for the special case of both leads made of the same material in the parallel alignment @xmath49 and in the antiparallel alignment @xmath50 .",
    "therefore for the antiparallel case it gives the total dos to be spin independent @xmath51 . in a such situation one can expect the usual kondo effect as for normal ( non - ferromagnetic ) metallic leads , however , the conductance will be diminished due to mismatch of the density of states described by the prefactor of the integral in eq .",
    "( [ spin_res_cond ] )      in this paper we will consider different type of total spin - dependent band structures @xmath52 independently of the particular magnetization direction of leads . the particular magnetization configuration will affect only the linear conductance @xmath53 due to the dos mismatch for both leads as discussed in detail later .",
    "the simplest situation , where one can account spin asymmetry in is a flat band with the energy - independent dos @xmath54 .",
    "then the spin asymmetry can be parameterized just by single parameter the spin imbalance in the dos at the fermi energy @xmath55 . for flat bands",
    "the knowledge of the spin - polarization @xmath56 of the leads , defined as [ def_p ] p= , is sufficient to fully parameterize @xmath52 ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : dos_flat_noshift ] ) .",
    "this particular dos shape is a special due to the fact , that the particle - hole symmetry is conserved in the electrodes leading to particular behaviour for the symmetric anderson model .",
    "this type model of the leads will be considered in sec .",
    "[ sec_flatband_noshift ] .",
    "one can generalize this model and break the particle - hole symmetry by taking the stoner splitting into account .",
    "a consequence of the conduction electron ferromagnetism is that the spin - dependent bands are shifted relative to each other ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : dos_arbitrary ] ) . for a finite value of that shift @xmath57 , the spin-@xmath58 band ranges between @xmath59 ( with the original bandwidth @xmath60 ) . in the limit @xmath61 only energies within the interval",
    "@xmath62 $ ] are considered , a scheme usually used in the nrg calculations  @xcite .",

    "[ fig : dos_flat_constshift ] ) . the flat band model with a stoner splitting and consequences of the particle - hole symmetry braking is considered in sec .  [ sec_flatband_shift ] .",
    "since the spin - splitting of the dot level is determined by the coupling to all occupied and unoccupied ( hole ) electronic states in the leads , the shape of the whole band plays an important role .",
    "therefore it is reasonable to consider arbitrary dos shape , which can not be parameterized by a particular set of parameters as the imbalance between @xmath64- and @xmath65-electrons at the fermi energy or a stoner splitting ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : dos_arbitrary ] ) . therefore in sec .",
    "[ sec_arb_bands ] we will consider a model with a more complex band structure and in the next sec .  [ sec_nrg_mapping ] we will develop the nrg technique for arbitrary band structure .     with an additional spin - dependent shift @xmath57 .",
    "to perform the logarithmic discretization a generalized bandwidth @xmath48 is defined .",
