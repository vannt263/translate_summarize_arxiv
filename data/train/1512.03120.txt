    "the cubic unit cells of @xmath8 and the two cells representing the alloy @xmath54 are shown in figure  [ unitcell ] . in the body - centered - cubic structure ( bcc ) of @xmath8 , the mo , sb(1 ) , and sb(2 ) atoms occupy crystallographic sites 12e , 12d , and 16f .",
    "prior studies of @xmath83 have shown , using neutron diffraction and ab initio computations of energetics , that te substitution occurs preferentially at the 12d site as opposed to 16f @xcite .",

    ". there are multiple possible choices for placing six te atoms on the sb(1 ) sites . to limit the computational requirements , we chose two configurations ( case 1 and case 2 ) , illustrated in figure  [ unitcell ] . to compute phonons for the alloy , @xmath80 supercells of the two alloy cells in each case (",
    "the two phonon supercells contained 320 atoms ) . to construct the force - constant matrix using the finite displacement approach , we computed 5 , 26 and 36 independent atomic displacements for the undoped cell , case 1 , and case 2 , respectively .",
    "the atomic displacement amplitude was one hundredth of the lattice constant .",
    "the neutron - weighted phonon dos from ins are shown in figures  [ dos_mo3sb7 ] and  [ dos_doped ] for @xmath25 and @xmath24 , respectively , at the different temperatures measured and for the two incident energies used . a clear softening of phonons ( shift to lower frequencies )",
    "is observed over the full phonon dos when increasing temperature , but with quite different magnitudes in the doped and undoped compounds . to analyze this softening ,",
    "we have compared the mean phonon energy @xmath84 with the expected softening upon thermal expansion within the quasi - harmonic ( qh ) approximation .",
    "we use an average thermodynamic grneisen parameter @xmath85 , where @xmath86 is coefficient of linear thermal expansion , @xmath87 is the unit cell volume , @xmath88 the iso - thermal bulk modulus , and @xmath89 the heat capacity at constant volume ( per unit cell ) .",
    "the iso - thermal bulk modulus was obtained from the phonon group velocities at 300k derived from our ixs measurements ( table  [ elastic_modulus ] ) , while @xmath90 was calculated from the phonon dos measured at t=6k , in the harmonic approximation , and magnetic and electronic contributions to the specific heat were added at low temperatures @xcite .",
    "we obtain @xmath91 and 0.70 for @xmath25 and @xmath24 , respectively .",
    "it can be observed from figure  [ phonon_softening]-b , that , while both materials deviate from the qh approximation for @xmath92k , this deviation is more pronounced in the undoped system at low temperatures @xmath93 .",
    "while @xmath24 follows the qh behavior fairly well at low @xmath94 , @xmath25 displays an unusual temperature dependence and softens much faster , in agreement with the data reported by candolfi _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite . as we will show later , this pronounced softening in @xmath25 is due to the electron - phonon coupling , which strongly influences phonon energies , lifetimes , and group velocities .",
    "we point out that the ins data on powders do not show much change across the 53k phase transition in @xmath25 .",
    "we could not detect any magnetic scattering intensity at low @xmath95 ( see figure  [ sqe ] ) .",
    "the nw phonon dos curves also show little change between 40k and 65k ( figure  [ dos_mo3sb7 ] ) , indicating a relatively weak effect of magnetic correlations on the overall lattice dynamics ( force - constants ) in this system . however , the magnetic fluctuations and the distortions from pairing of mo dimers are likely to lead to increased phonon scattering rates ( increased linewidths ) , which would not be easily detectable in the phonon dos .",
    "our analysis of thermal transport based on phonon group velocities reveal this effect more clearly ( see below ) .",
    "figure  [ comparison_dos ] illustrates the effect of te alloying .",
    "a significant stiffening @xmath961.0mev is observed upon introduction of te , and results from a combination of decrease in lattice parameter upon te doping and of reduction in carrier concentration ( from @xmath97 @xmath98 in @xmath25 to @xmath99 @xmath98 in @xmath24 @xcite ) .",
    "importantly , the contraction in lattice parameter with te doping ( @xmath100 @xcite ) only accounts for 0.35% of the observed phonon dos stiffening .",
    "thus , additional mechanisms such as the change in bonding and suppression in electron - phonon coupling could explain the large observed stiffening .",
    "the stiffening with te doping occurs at all temperatures and remains fairly constant with temperature ( see figure  [ phonon_softening](f , g , h ) ) .    interestingly , by examining figure  [ comparison_dos ] , one can observe that the magnitude of phonon energy shifts upon te doping is not uniform across the entire dos .",
    "in particular , the phonon peak at @xmath3214 mev is most sensitive to doping ( @xmath101% ) while the peaks at @xmath3219mev and @xmath3228mev stiffen by about 5% and 6% , respectively .",
    "we identified the origin of this difference by determining which atomic sites are predominantly involved in these different frequency regions of the phonon dos , based on our dft simulations .",
    "as can be seen in figure  [ dos ] , in the simulated partial phonon dos , the modes at @xmath3214 , 19 , and 28mev correspond predominantly to vibrations of sb(12d ) , sb(16f ) , and mo(12e ) atoms , respectively .",
    "thus , the 14mev peak is most sensitive to the te doping , owing to the preferred te substitution on the ( 12d ) site .",
    "this behavior also reveals a larger bonding change around the te dopants ( 12d ) , rather than an average renormalization of force - constants .",
    "we discuss this point in more details below .",
    "to investigate the modifications in chemical bonding responsible for the observed changes in vibrational properties , we first examine the electronic density of states ( edos ) of @xmath25 and @xmath54 obtained with dft , shown in figure  [ edos_all ] .",
    "as can be seen in this figure , the two doped supercells ( case 1 and case 2 ) have a very similar edos , indicating that the particular location of te dopants among 12d sites does not impact the results strongly . in both of the doped cells ,",
    "the fermi level ( origin of energy axis ) is pushed up towards the top of the valence band , compared to @xmath25 , with little distortion of the edos .",
    "this rigid band shift is rationalized as the filling of holes by the extra @xmath102 electrons of te .",
    "because of the slope in the edos , this shift of @xmath103 decreases the number of electronic states at the fermi level ( @xmath104 ) , in agreement with previous observations by candolfi _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite and xu _ et al . _",
    "@xcite .",
    "this decrease in edos at fermi level originates from @xmath102-states of mo(12e ) , and @xmath9-states of sb(12d ) , sb(16f ) , and te(12d ) atoms , with the projected edos showing suppressions at the fermi level of about    @xmath105@xmath3218% , @xmath106@xmath3214% , @xmath107@xmath3218%    , and    @xmath108 @xmath3277%    , respectively .    in order to evaluate these changes , we have averaged the edos of supercells in case 1 and case 2 .    in previous studies , some of us showed that sharp features in the edos near the fermi level can result in a strong sensitivity of the electron - phonon coupling on either temperature or doping @xcite . a similar behavior is observed in the present case of @xmath25 , with its strong sensitivity to band filling ( te doping ) . at low temperature , @xmath24 follows the qh model , while the significantly larger electronic density at the fermi level in @xmath25 leads to a large deviations from qh behavior .    the change in density at the fermi level impacts the effectiveness of screening of forces on the ion cores .",
    "our first - principles lattice dynamics simulations of @xmath25 and @xmath54 illustrate this effect very clearly .",
    "as we can observe from figure  [ dos_mo3sb7 ] ,  [ dos_doped ] , and  [ dos ] , our simulations capture the lattice dynamics of the two compositions very well , including the overall shape of the spectrum , as well as the frequencies of phonon peaks , and also the relative stiffening with te doping .",
    "in particular , we observe the pronounced shift of the te - dominated peak at @xmath109 mev in both simulations and measurements .",
    "a very good agreement is also achieved between our ixs measurements of phonon dispersions and our dft simulations , as will be discussed below .",
    "given the reliability of our dft simulations , we can rationalize the effects of te doping observed experimentally by investigating the behavior of interatomic force - constants .",
    "table  [ bvk_comparison ] lists the born - von karman ( bvk ) force constants of two compositions for first - nearest - neighbor ( 1nn ) bonds between different pairs of atoms ( see illustration in figure  [ bvk_bonds ] ) .",
    "the values reported in table  [ bvk_comparison ] correspond to the @xmath110 norm of the @xmath111 bvk force - constant matrix for each nearest pair of atoms . since in the alloy supercell case 2 , we replaced sb with te at 12d sites that are far apart , a direct comparison with 1nn force - constants is not possible .",
    "thus , we limit ourselves to comparing case 1 with the undoped @xmath25 cell . as can be seen in table  [ bvk_comparison ] , the increase in force - constants with te doping is large , in particular for the bonds mo(12e)-mo(12e ) , sb(12d)-sb(12d ) , and sb(16f)-sb(16f ) .",
    "a slight decrease ( @xmath112 ) of the stiffness of the mo(12e)-sb(12d ) 1nn bond is observed with te doping .",
    "however , the mo(12e)-te(12d ) bond is comparatively much stiffer , effectively stiffening the average mo(12e)-te / sb(12d ) bond in the alloy @xmath54 , in comparison to mo(12e)-sb(12d ) in the pure compound @xmath25 .",
    "accounting for the respective number of bonds in the alloy , we determine that the average mo(12e)-te / sb(12d ) bond stiffness increases by 108% , compared to the undoped system .",
    "the large stiffening of this bond is reflected in the experimentally observed 10% stiffening of the @xmath113 mev phonon peak ( figure  [ phonon_softening ] ) , which is dominated by sb / te(12d ) atomic motions , as seen in the partial phonon dos ( figure  [ dos ] ) .",
    "similarly , the @xmath114 stiffening of the bond stiffness for mo(12e)-mo(12e ) and @xmath115 stiffening for sb(16f)-sb(16f ) lead to the observed @xmath112 and @xmath116 stiffening of phonon peaks at @xmath3228 and 19 mev , respectively . the change in local bonding upon te substitution",
    "can also be seen by computing the stiffness of the local potential energy surface with dft .",
    "figure  [ local_bonding ] shows the potential curves for small displacements of the sb or te atom from the 12d site , revealing a much stiffer bonding in the case of te .",

    "@xcite and yan _ et al . _",
    "we attempted to include this extra source of phonon scattering with a resonance - scattering term @xcite , but the pronounced dip in experimental curves could not be reproduced .",
    "it is likely that the unusual @xmath6 of @xmath25 near @xmath164k is closely related to its structural instability induced by the competing magnetic interactions @xcite , but a more complex phonon scattering model , beyond the scope of the present study , would be required to describe this effect . to summarize the present discussion",
    ", we emphasize that at temperatures ( @xmath165 ) , the increase in @xmath6 with te doping is primarily arising from the reduction in electron - phonon coupling , which significant increases the phonon group velocities and relaxation times .",
    "we have investigated phonons in the candidate thermoelectric material @xmath0 , using inelastic neutron and x - ray scattering , as well as dft simulations . the phonon dos exhibits a strong overall stiffening upon alloying with te , which is well reproduced in our dft simulations of alloy supercells .",
    "we also observed that the phonon dos for both @xmath25 and @xmath24 shows a significant softening with increasing temperature , beyond the effect of thermal expansion in the quasi - harmonic approximation .",
    "our first - principles phonon simulations for @xmath0 reveal that te doping leads to strong local perturbations of the bonding environment and interatomic force - constants .",
    "in particular , the bonds sb(12d)-sb / te(12d ) , mo(12e)-mo(12e ) , and sb(16f)-sb(16f ) stiffen by as much as @xmath32108% , 65% , and 45% , respectively , upon substitution of te at the sb(12d ) site . as a result of this strong local perturbation , the phonon spectrum stiffens in a non - uniform manner .",
    "furthermore , our phonon dispersion measurements with ixs , combined with dft simulations , reveal that the suppression in electron - phonon coupling upon te - doping largely accounts for the increase in lattice thermal conductivity .",
    "this suppressed electron - phonon coupling increases the phonon group velocities and phonon relaxation times , despite the introduction of significant impurity scattering from force - constant disorder .",
