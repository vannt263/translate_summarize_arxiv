    "many people get recommendations for movies , music , articles , and products through their social connections both online and off .",
    "online , we often think of sharing primarily as a public broadcast through tweets , status updates , and the like .",
    "much online sharing , however , is narrower , targeted at specific audiences ( as with google+ circles or pinterest boards ) or _ directed _ @xcite at specific individuals through email , chat , and person - to - person messages ( e.g. suggesting movies on netflix @xcite ) .",

    "these models can be used to support sharing online by suggesting which items to share and who to share them with @xcite . however , while there is extensive research on understanding people s rating behavior and predicting their preferences for items @xcite , little is known about people s online sharing behavior and its predictability .    from past research on word - of - mouth product sharing and information sharing on the web , we know that people share items for many reasons : enhancement of personal image , personal interest in the item , helping others , a desire to help or harm the item s producer , seeking advice , and so on @xcite . on balance , these motivations can be seen as special cases of two primary drivers of sharing proposed by ho and dempsey : _ individuation _ , the need to establish a distinct identity for oneself , and _ altruism _ , the desire to help others @xcite .    based on the primary motivations of individuation and altruism , we can expect people to share content that is some balance of their own and others interests . what that balance is , and how it comes to be so , however , is an open question and our main focus in this paper .",
    "a recent study on twitter suggests that the balance is tilted toward the self : around 80% of people",
    "primarily share content about their activities and opinions , while only 20% share informational content more likely to be useful to others @xcite . however , this may be because of the broadcast nature of sharing on twitter where in the absence of a specific audience , sharing becomes an expression of one s thoughts and ideas @xcite .",
    "when people share to specific recipients , they may be more likely to think about usefulness for the recipient ( and thus be more altruistic ) than when they share to larger groups @xcite .",
    "* present work . *",
    "to study the relative effects of individuation and altruism , we conducted an empirical study where pairs of friends were independently shown the same set of movies and asked to rate those movies and/or share them with their friend .",
    "ratings for movies by the sharer can be considered as a proxy for her preference in movies , which in turn is expected to reflect her self - image ( individuation ) .",
    "similarly , we regard sharing movies that align with the recipient s preferences as other - oriented altruistic behavior .",
    "87 pairs of facebook friends took part in the study , providing rating and sharing data along with answers to open - ended questions about their sharing behavior .",
    "our results provide several concrete findings about person - to - person sharing .",
    "first , individuation is the dominant factor for sharing items .",
    "shared items are rated significantly higher by senders than items that are nt shared .",
    "further , senders ratings are significantly higher than recipients ratings for shared items .",
    "second , participants describe customizing their recommendations based on the recipient , consistent with results from earlier studies @xcite .",
    "we argue that these two seemingly contrary results  people claiming to personalize but still sharing items that they themselves like  can be best explained by the following decision process : people choose items to share based on their preferences and context , then decide to share or not depending on the recipient .",
    "we formalize this process as the _ preference - salience _ model of sharing and provide some evidence for it .",
    "third , we show that we can ( noisily ) predict which items a person might share .",
    "a model using sharers and recipients preferences for movies along with sharers promiscuity can predict shares by study participants with more than 75% precision .",
    "we also find that item characteristics such as average rating and popularity play little role in predicting sharing decisions compared to people s own preferences for an item .",
    "our goal of better understanding of sharing behavior is situated between existing work around word - of - mouth sharing , recommender systems , and diffusion in social media .",
    "we discuss each in turn , along with a key question related to that body of work .",
    "when communicating with others , people customize their message based on their estimation of the audience s knowledge or attitudes @xcite . at the same time , much word - of - mouth sharing is driven by people s desire to share items that closely align with or enhance their self - image @xcite .",
    "our first question addreses how people balance customization with self - expression .",
    "this dual motivation between _ self _ and _ other _ has also been found to drive sharing activities in online contexts .",
    "research in online word - of - mouth referrals has shown individuation and altruism as two dominant motivations for sharing @xcite .",
    "studies of knowledge sharing in online professional communities reveal a similar pattern : people share knowledge to enhance their professional reputation or when they enjoy helping others @xcite .    when sharing items such as movies , these two motivations of individuation and altruism can be mapped to sharing based on one s own interests or the audience s .",
    "these , in turn , can be estimated from the rich preference data available online , then used to study the relative influence of these factors .",
    "* rq1 : * to what extent do people tend to share items that they like themselves ( individuation ) versus those that they perceive to be relevant for the recipient ( altruism ) ?",
    "studying sharing behavior also allows us to ask how well people can recommend content for others ; such directed suggestions can provide a useful complement to algorithmically - generated recommendations @xcite .",
    "most studies in this space have focused on the question of influence , using recipients acceptance of recommendations as a proxy for how influential the sender is .",
    "for example , network influence @xcite , the relationship with the sender @xcite , the explanation accompanying the content @xcite , and the susceptibility of an individual towards shared items @xcite have all been shown to affect people s likelihood of accepting suggestions .",
    "however , little is known about whether people make suggestions that receivers would actually like .",
    "the study most related to this question compared people s ability to predict a stranger s movie ratings based on part of that person s rating profile to predictions from a standard collaborative filtering algorithm @xcite . on balance , people were not as accurate  and , interestingly , got worse as the profile became more similar to their own .    in this paper , we study how well people s suggestions match the recipient s interests when they share items with known friends and compare their results with algorithmic recommendations . instead of making inferences from profile information @xcite , people rely on their own knowledge about a friend to choose which items to share , which we see as a more natural recommendation scenario .",
    "for consistency in terminology , we use recommendations to refer to algorithmic recommendations and shares to refer to human - generated directed recommendations in the rest of the paper .",
    "* rq2 : * do people share items to friends that are well - liked compared to recommendations ?      in computer science ,",
    "sharing is most commonly studied as a component of information diffusion models @xcite .",
    "these models simulate the spread of items in a network , where people adopt an item through either probabilistic transfer between connected people or based on a threshold number of adoptions in a person s neighborhood .",
    "however , these models do nt actually explain most adoption in social media @xcite because the viral analogy breaks down .",
    "sharing is a _ voluntary _ process shaped by social forces such as people s willingness to diffuse @xcite , attention to targets needs @xcite , and relations between sharer and target including tie strength @xcite and homophily .",
    "the present work aims to build models of sharing that account for this voluntary decision - making .",
    "if successful , these models can explain how people weigh their own and recipients preferences when sharing items and present a computational framework for predicting future shares .",
    "this model can be used to estimate sharing probabilities for different recipients and items ; diffusion models can leverage these probabilities to better account for these influences and make more accurate predictions around diffusion .    * rq3 : * how well can we predict whether an item is shared using readily available information about people s preferences and properties of people and items ?",
    "to tackle the above questions , we conducted an experiment that asked pairs of friends on facebook to rate and share items .",
    "we chose movies as the item domain for several reasons .",
    "movies are a common domain in recommender systems research and an important cultural item that people often share and discuss , making them a natural domain for studying sharing .",
    "they are also fairly popular to like on facebook @xcite ( among our participants , @xmath0 ) , allowing us build reasonable user profiles for making recommendations .",
    "* study logistics .",
    "* figure  [ fig - user - flow ] shows an overview of the experiment , which proceeded in three main stages . in the first stage , a participant ( a ) signs up for the study and invites one of her facebook friends as a partner ( b ) through email sent by our system .",
    "when person b accepts the invitation , the second stage starts .",
    "person b is shown a set of movie recommendations which he is asked to rate and/or share with person a , followed by a questionnaire that asks about b s relationship with a and his practices around sharing items in general .",
    "person a then gets a notification and , in the third stage , performs the same tasks on the same items , then answers the same questions as person b.    showing both partners the same items allows us to get overlapping sharing and rating data to address the research question .",
    "the asynchronous design allows partners to participate independently , making the study easier to complete . to minimize explicit social influence that might affect sharing and rating behaviors @xcite",
    ", participants do not see information about their partner s ratings or shares .",
    "figure  [ fig - rec - suggest ] shows a screenshot of the interface , designed to broadly resemble other systems that recommend lists of items .",
    "participants were free to choose the movies to rate or share among the movies shown .",
    "all ratings are on a likert scale from 0.5 - 5 , with half ratings allowed .",
    "movies are shared by clicking on the recommend button and providing a short message explaining the recommendation .",
    "the system showed the study partner as the default choice for sharing ; all but four shares were to their partner so we removed those four shares from the dataset .",
    "after the rating and sharing task , participants completed a short questionnaire asking how close they were to their study partner , as well as open - ended questions about how and why they suggest items , and how and when they receive suggestions from others .",
    "* computing recommendations . * for each user , we computed recommendations based on likes within their ego network .",
    "we first selected the user s @xmath1 most similar friends based on jaccard similarity of their likes with the user .",
    "we then computed a score for each movie based on its similarity - weighted popularity among the @xmath2 friends : @xmath3 where @xmath4 is 1 if friend @xmath5 likes @xmath6 and 0 otherwise .",
    "this algorithm gives comparable results to using data from thousands of facebook users using a generic k - nearest neighbors algorithm @xcite .",
    "the ten highest scoring movies for each user that were not already liked by her were chosen as recommendations .",
    "some users may have less than 10 recommendations because they do not have enough friends or enough likes in their profile to compute recommendations .",
    "further , facebook api errors and rate limits prevented some users likes from being fetched .",
    "thus , participants saw between 0 and 20 movies ; we pruned those who saw less than 10 .",
    "recommendations for both partners were computed and stored in the second stage , ensuring that both saw the same set .",
    "each pair s recommendations were combined and presented in a randomized order to minimize presentation order effects .",
    ".aggregate statistics for participants recruited from amazon mechanical turk and the university . about a third of the participants were recruited through mechanical turk .",
    "there was no significant difference in study activity between the two populations . [ cols=\"<,>,>,>\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "we can use a similar analysis for comparing recipients rating for shared and recommended movies .",
    "our null model would be the same as before . @xmath7 the full model would include information about whether the movie was shared or recommended .",
    "@xmath8 table  [ tab - lme - recipient ] shows the comparison between the two models above .",
