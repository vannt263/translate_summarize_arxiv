    "the idea is now to count rational points of bounded height on the fibres @xmath76 and @xmath77 , uniformly for points @xmath74 of height @xmath75 .",
    "this is the strategy adopted by salberger in his proof of .    in the present situation , with the quadratic form ,",
    "the fibres that we need to examine have the shape @xmath78 for coprime @xmath79 .",

    "the reduction of the counting problem to one involving the family of conics is carried out in ",
    "[ s : prelim ] , where we have avoided using the height machinery by doing things in a completely explicit manner .",
    "as is well - known there is a group homomorphism @xmath82 , which to a divisor class @xmath83 associates the intersection number of @xmath84 with a fibre .",
    "the kernel of this map is generated by the `` vertical '' divisors , which up to linear equivalence are the irreducible components of the fibres .",
    "since the non - singular fibres are all linearly equivalent , it follows that @xmath17 has rank @xmath85 , where @xmath86 is the number of split singular fibres above closed points of @xmath87 . in our case",
    "there are three closed points , corresponding to the irreducible factors @xmath88 and @xmath89 of @xmath90 .",
    "since each singular fibre is split it follows that @xmath91 , as previously claimed .",
    "roughly speaking , as one ranges over values of @xmath92\\in { { { \\mathbb{p}}_{{\\mathbb{q}}}^1}}({\\mathbb{q}})$ ] of height @xmath75 , one expects there to be about @xmath93 rational points on @xmath94 with height restricted to appropriate intervals .",
    "the preliminary reduction to @xmath92\\in~{{{\\mathbb{p}}_{{\\mathbb{q}}}^1}}({\\mathbb{q}})$ ] of height @xmath75 is absolutely pivotal here : it is only through this device that we can cover @xmath95 with a satisfactory number of divisors .",
    "were we charged instead with establishing an upper bound like  , our analysis would now be relatively straightforward , thanks to the control over the growth rate of rational points on conics afforded by the second author s joint work with heath - brown ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem  6 ) .",
    "a key aspect of this estimate is that it is uniform in the height of the conic , becoming sharper as the discriminant grows larger . in  [ s : ham ] we will take advantage of these arguments to eliminate certain awkward ranges for @xmath96 in .    obtaining an asymptotic formula",
    "is a far more exacting task . using the large sieve inequality ,",
    "serre @xcite has shown that most plane conics defined over @xmath0 do nt contain rational points .",
    "this phenomenon might pose problems for us , given that we want a uniform asymptotic formula for a zariski dense set of rational points on the fibres .",
    "our choice of surface has been tailored to guarantee that this does nt happen , since the corresponding fibres always contain the rational point @xmath97.\\ ] ] in the classical manner we can use this point to parametrise all of the rational points on the conic , which ultimately leads us to evaluate asymptotically the number of points belonging to a @xmath98-dimensional sublattice @xmath99 which are constrained to lie in an appropriate region @xmath100 . both @xmath101 and @xmath102",
    "depend on the parameters @xmath103 and @xmath104 , so this estimate needs to be achieved with a sufficient degree of uniformity .",
    "assuming that @xmath102 has piecewise continuous boundary , we would ideally like to apply the familiar estimate @xmath105 where @xmath106 denotes the perimeter of @xmath102 .",
    "unhappily this estimate is too crude for our purposes .",
    "we will use poisson summation to make the error term explicit .",
    "the reduction of the problem to a lattice point counting problem is carried out in  [ sec : par ] and its execution is the subject of   [ sec:1][s:2 ] .",
    "the one outstanding task , which is the focus of  [ s:3 ] , is to evaluate asymptotically the main term arising from the lattice point counting problem .",
    "it turns out that this involves a sum of the shape @xmath107 for a certain multiplicative arithmetic function @xmath108 that is very similar to the ordinary divisor function @xmath109 .",
    "the problem of determining the average order of the divisor function as it ranges over the values of polynomials has enjoyed considerable attention in the literature . in the setting of binary forms current technology",
    "has limited us to handling forms of degree at most @xmath11 . when @xmath110 daniel @xcite has dealt with the case of irreducible binary quartic forms .",
    "we need to extend this argument to deal with a more general class of arithmetic functions and to binary quartic forms that are no longer irreducible .",
    "we have found it convenient to corral the necessary estimates into a separate investigation @xcite , which is of a more technical nature .",
    "the facts that we will need are recalled in  [",
    "s : tech ] .",
    "our main goal in this paper is to outline a general strategy for proving the manin conjecture for non - singular del pezzo surfaces of degree @xmath11 equipped with a conic bundle structure admitting a section over @xmath0 . in order to minimise the length and technical difficulty of the work , which is already considerable , we have chosen to illustrate the approach by selecting a concrete surface to work with .",
    "it is likely that the argument we present can be adapted to handle other conic bundle surfaces .",
    "for example , consider the family of surfaces , with @xmath111 it is easy to check that @xmath3 will be non - singular if and only if @xmath112 and @xmath113 .",
    "as we ve already mentioned , our success with is closely linked to the existence of an obvious rational point on all of the fibres .",
    "this is equivalent to the map @xmath114 being surjective . a necessary and sufficient condition for ensuring this is that the morphism @xmath115 should admit a section over @xmath0 .",
    "this fact has a long history and can be traced back to work of lewis and schinzel @xcite .",
    "even when the conic bundle surface admits a section , however , there remains considerable work to be done in handling a general diagonal form @xmath116 as above .",
    "the corresponding fibres will take the shape @xmath117 for binary forms @xmath118 and @xmath119 .",
    "thus , at the very least , one needs analogues of our investigation @xcite for the case in which @xmath120 factors over @xmath0 as the product of two quadratic forms or splits completely .    throughout our work @xmath121 will denote the set of positive integers . if @xmath122 then we write @xmath123 for the greatest common divisor of @xmath96 and @xmath92=ab/\\gcd(a , b)$ ] for the least common multiple .",
    "we set @xmath124 for the odd part of the greatest common divisor , and use the symbol @xmath125 to indicate a summation in which all the variables of summation are restricted to odd integers .",
    "furthermore , our work will involve the arithmetic functions @xmath126 finally , in terms of the parameter @xmath127 , we set @xmath128 we will reserve @xmath37 for a generic absolute positive constant , whose value is always effectively computable .",

    "our work requires a number of auxiliary results , ranging from basic estimates using the geometry of numbers to more sophisticated results concerning the divisor problem for binary quartic forms .",
