    "since its identification as a highly luminous galaxy in the infrared ( @xcite ) arp  220  =  ic  4553/4 has undergone extensive observational studies with the recognition that it is the closest of the ultraluminous infrared galaxies ( @xcite ) .",
    "its bolometric luminosity of 1.2@xmath4 is in the range of quasar luminosities , but most recently arp  220 has been cited as a prototype for the appearance of forming galaxies at high redshifts ( @xcite ) .    the most striking property of arp  220 is the very strong infrared emission that rises rapidly from @xmath20.5  jy at 12  @xmath0 m to @xmath210  jy at 25  @xmath0 m to a peak flux density of @xmath2100  jy at 60  @xmath0 m ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "this emission is generally attributed to thermal emission by dust heated by an underlying luminosity source ; the dust emission at these wavelengths accounts for more than 98% of the bolometric luminosity of the source .",
    "wynn - williams & becklin ( 1993 ) showed that the size of the source at 32  @xmath0 m was @xmath52@xmath1 , and that the source was centered on the optically obscured nucleus of the galaxy .",

    "the observations reported here were obtained primarily with the mirlin mid - infrared camera ( @xcite ) at the f/40 bent cassegrain visitor port of the keck ii telescope of the w. m. keck observatory .",

    "a chopping secondary with a square wave chop , an amplitude of 6@xmath1 in the north - south direction and a frequency of approximately 4 hz was employed for fast beam switching .",
    "the frames at each chop position were coadded in hardware resulting in two images . after an interval of approximately a minute ,",
    "the telescope was nodded east - west by 6@xmath1 and a second set of two images was obtained in order to cancel residuals in the sky and subtract telescope emission .",

    "the data were reduced by differencing the two images obtained within the chop pairs at each nod location , and then coadding the resulting four positive images , with their positions appropriately adjusted to a common location , to yield a positive image centered in a field approximately 6@xmath13 .",

    "the photometric measurements of @xmath14  tau , and of the five stars made at different wavelengths throughout the night , are consistent to @xmath15 with previous ground - based measurements and the color corrected iras point source catalog flux densities .",
    "the flux density corresponding to 0.0 mag was taken to follow the prescription given in the explanatory supplement to the iras catalogs and atlases ( joint iras science team 1989 ) , and is listed in table  1 .",
    "in addition to observations at wavelengths @xmath16 7.9  @xmath0 m , observations at high spatial resolution at 3.45  @xmath0 m ( @xmath17 ) were obtained of the nucleus of arp  220 using the cassegrain infrared camera on the 200-inch hale telescope of palomar observatory on 20 may 1997 in non - photometric conditions .",
    "thirteen pairs of observations each with 70 sec of integration ( 1000 coadded 0.07 sec frames ) on the galaxy and on nearby sky were obtained with a 64@xmath1864 pixel sub - array of the insb array camera .",

    "the centroid of the western nucleus has been set in the same position in each frame on the assumption that the centroid of this source is spatially coincident at all wavelengths . as noted by scoville et al .",
    "( 1998 ) this is a dubious assumption at the shorter wavelengths due to the presence of heavy extinction in the nuclear region . to facilitate a comparison of the morphologies at all wavelengths , the location of the peak of the eastern component in the image obtained at 24.5  @xmath0 m has been marked by a plus sign at the same relative location on all the images .",
    "since these observations were made using the chopping secondary and nodding , the images are not sensitive to structure on spatial scales @xmath21 .    at all wavelengths",
    "the western nucleus is detected strongly .",
    "an eastern nucleus is also present except at 9.7 and 10.3  @xmath0 m where the signal to noise ratios are not adequate to confidently locate it .",
    "while the apparent peak of the eastern emission is at the same location at 7.9 , 8.8 and 17.9  @xmath0 m , the peak brightness lies to the northeast of the 7.9  @xmath0 m centroid at 3.45 and 11.7  @xmath0 m , while it appears to be to the south by about 0.2@xmath1 at 12.5 and 24.5  @xmath0 m . at 3.45  @xmath0 m , the eastern nucleus seems to be at the same location as the dominant eastern source seen by scoville et al .",
    "( 1998 ) at 1.1 to 2.2  @xmath0 m , while at the longer wavelengths , the dominant eastern component apparently agrees in location more with a faint source seen at 2.2  @xmath0 m to the southeast by scoville et al . and with the center of the radio continuum sources seen by smith et al .",
    "( 1998 ) . the 3.45",
    ", 7.9 and 8.8  @xmath0 m images show that the eastern peak is itself elongated at a position angle of @xmath215 @xmath22 ; this is quite similar to the structure revealed in the nicmos images ( @xcite ) .",
    "this structure might also be present at 11.7 and 12.5  @xmath0 m , but is not clearly evident at longer wavelengths . at 24.5  @xmath0 m ,",
    "the two nuclei are separated by 0.94@xmath23 at a position angle of 102 @xmath24 in excellent agreement with the separation of the mean of the radio peaks given by smith et al .",
    "of 0.94 @xmath25 at a position angle of 102@xmath26 .",
    "the complicated structure of the nuclear region makes accurate photometry of its constituents impossible .",
    "in addition to the 4@xmath1 diameter circular beams , photometry was obtained on two smaller areas within the nuclear region  a 0.8@xmath1 diameter circular beam centered on the western nucleus and a rectangular beam 0.7@xmath27 located as outlined in figure  1a . for the smaller beams ,",
    "whose dimensions are in some cases comparable to the size of the sources , the sensitivity was adjusted by applying a similar beam to the star observed just prior to the arp  220 observations .",
    "an additional correction of 33% was applied to the 0.8@xmath1 diameter photometry of the western source at 24.5  @xmath0 m and , on the assumption the source is the same size at 17.9  @xmath0 m as at 24.5  @xmath0 m , at 17.9  @xmath0 m to account for the fact that the source was extended while the psf was not .",
    "the accuracy of this correction depends on the observation that the 24.5  @xmath0 m observations throughout the night were diffraction limited despite the variability of the seeing at shorter wavelengths .",
    "the uncertainties given in table  2 are dominated by photon statistics and do not include systematic uncertainties .",
    "the calibration of the magnitude of the standard star and the zero points are probably uncertain at the 10% level .",
    "the uncertainties in the small beam relative to each other and to the large beam measurements are in the 1020% range due primarily to the uncertainties in the detected source sizes .",
    "the western source appears to be marginally resolved .",
    "the measured fwhm of the western nucleus and the fwhm of a star observed at each wavelength just prior to the observations of arp  220 are given in table  2 and are shown by the clear and hatched concentric circles respectively in each panel of figure  1a . in all cases except 17.9  @xmath0 m",
    ", the fwhm of the western nucleus exceeds that of the psf star indicating that the western source is resolved .",
    "the 17.9  @xmath0 m measurement , where the source fwhm is smaller than that of the psf , apparently reflects a fluctuation in the seeing and the discrepancy can perhaps be taken as an indication of the uncertainties in any size determination presumably caused by seeing variations .",
    "figure  1a suggests that a low level of extended emission extends beyond the two nuclei and has an overall extent of @xmath2823@xmath1 ( 7001000  pc ) at most wavelengths .",
    "the photometric measurements indicate this emission is small .",
    "a comparison of the various measurements given in table  2 indicates that at most 10% of the emission at wavelengths longer than 3.45  @xmath0 m is in this extended component while a comparison between the emission at 24.5  @xmath0 m and the 25  @xmath0 m iras measurements indicates that to within the uncertainties of the calibration , the emission within the 1@xmath29 5@xmath30 iras beam is contained in the source area shown in figure  1a .",
    "figure  2 shows the spectral energy distribution of the entire source within the 4@xmath1 diameter beam as well as of the individual components within the two smaller beams described above .",
    "the spectral energy distributions show deep minima near 10  @xmath0 m which presumably indicate strong absorption ( smith , aitken & roche 1989 ) .",
    "other than the depth of the absorption , the overall spectral energy distributions of the two locations are quite similar within the uncertainties .",
    "the appearance of the nucleus of arp  220 in the mid - infrared is complex because of the interplay of background light , embedded energy sources and wavelength dependent emission and absorption by dust .",
    "this complexity is already clearly apparent in the 1.1 , 1.6 and 2.2  @xmath0 m nicmos images of scoville et al .",
    "( 1998 ) which show the effects of large and highly variable extinction on the background starlight emission from the nuclear environments . the mid - infrared data , and the 24.5  @xmath0 m data in particular , are , however , important in developing a picture of arp  220 because a significant fraction of the total luminosity of the system is emerging at these wavelengths .",
    "further , the strong absorption , presumably due to silicates ( see e.g. , smith , aitken & roche 1989 ) , that is apparent in the spectral energy distributions of both nuclei implies that there is a significant column of intervening cooler material in the line of sight to those regions .",
    "the relative locations of the western and southeastern peaks at 24.5  @xmath0 m are the same to within the uncertainties as the relative locations of the western clump of unresolved radio sources to the southeastern clump ( smith et al .",
    "thus we associate the peaks seen at 24.5  @xmath0 m with the radio peaks seen by condon et al .",
    "( 1991 ) , baan & haschick ( 1995 ) and smith et al . with this assumption ,",
    "the southeastern peak is located within 0.1@xmath1 of the area associated with the largest dust absorption as inferred by scoville et al .",
    "based on the agreement between the separation and position angles of the eastern and western nuclei at 24.5  @xmath0 m and 1.3  mm ( downes & solomon 1998 ; sakamoto et al .",
    "1998 ) we also assume that the peaks at these wavelengths are spatially coincident .",
    "the agreement between the distribution of 24.5  @xmath0 m flux and the continuum at 1.3  mm is important since the 1.3  mm emission is presumably optically thin so it traces the total dust column density in the nuclear regions in this system .",
    "we attribute the strong dip near 10  @xmath0 m ( figure 2 ) to absorption by silicates .",
    "the eastern region has a significantly deeper absorption than the western source around 10@xmath0 m .",
    "the observations at 17.9  @xmath0 m show a dip , a further signature of silicates , in both regions , but especially in the eastern source .",
    "the ground - based 10  @xmath0 m spectra of smith , aitken & roche ( 1989 ) as well as the iso spectra of klaas et al .",
    "( 1997 ) show evidence for aromatic hydrocarbons ( pah ) in emission .",
    "the present data do not have adequate spectral resolution to distinguish silicate absorption from an underlying silicate / blackbody / pah continuum , although the observations of smith , aitken & roche and klaas , et al .",
    "do suggest that pah emission does contribute to the continuum that is being absorbed .",
    "the images where the northeast elongation clearly appears were taken at wavelengths where the very strong infrared emission features attributed to pah emission are known to appear ; i.e. , 3.4 , 7.8 , 8.7 and 11.5  @xmath0 m in arp  220 [ 3.3 , 7.7 , 8.6 and 11.3  @xmath0 m in the rest frame ] ( willner et al .",
    "it is possible that the extended structure in arp  220 is traced most strongly in these features .",
    "the interpretation of the 3.4524.5  @xmath0 m observations depends critically on the size derived from the 24.5  @xmath0 m observations .",
    "the measured size of the western nucleus at 24.5  @xmath0 m , 0.73@xmath1 , includes a significant component from the diffraction limit of the telescope or 0.62@xmath1 .",
    "subtracting 0.62@xmath1 in quadrature from the observed size leads to a source size of 0.39@xmath1 . while the measured size of the psf was consistently 0.62@xmath1 during the observations reported here and we believe the observations are nearly diffraction limited , there is a possibility that seeing fluctuations could have increased the apparent size of the source .",
    "the seeing contribution , as extrapolated from the measured seeing at 12.5  @xmath0 m , could be as large as 0.3@xmath1 .",
    "if seeing contributed 0.3@xmath1 to the image diameter at 24.5  @xmath0 m , the source diameter is 0.25@xmath1 .",
    "thus a range of source diameters at 24.5  @xmath0 m of 0.25@xmath1 to 0.39@xmath1 is possible .",
    "the 24.5  @xmath0 m emission of the western source is approximately three times that of the eastern source .",
    "while the absorption is greater in the eastern source , the overall spectral energy distributions of the two nuclei do not suggest the eastern source is at a significantly different temperature than the western one , and there is no strong evidence that the eastern source is contributing very differently to the total luminosity of the system than inferred directly from the observed 24.5  @xmath0 m emission . for simplicity ,",
    "in the following discussion we will therefore assume that the western and eastern nuclei have similar spectral energy distributions .",
    "the emission at wavelengths longer than 20  @xmath0 m can be modeled in several ways . in the first scenario",
    "we assume the largest source diameter , 0.39@xmath1 , and an optically thick nucleus that is unobscured at 24.5  @xmath0 m .",
    "this size is just large enough to contain all of the vlbi radio point sources in the western nucleus ( smith et al .",
    "1998 ) , suggestive that this size is appropriate for the compact western nucleus .",
    "if the measured 24.5  @xmath0 m flux density in the western source is due to an optically thick source of diameter 0.39@xmath1 , the 24.5  @xmath0 m brightness temperature is 85  k. an 85  k blackbody of diameter 0.39@xmath1 emits 365  mjy at 1.3  mm .",
    "the dust continuum emission from the western source measured at 1.3  mm by sakamoto et al .",
    "( 1998 ) is @xmath2140  mjy thus implying that the emissivity of the source is 0.5 at 1.3  mm , consistent with it being optically thick at submillimeter wavelengths .",
    "if the eastern source has a similar spectral energy distribution as the western source , the two nuclei together account for essentially all of the flux density measured at 24.5  @xmath0 m in a 4@xmath1 diameter beam or by iras at 25  @xmath0 m , but only 42  jy or 40% of the 104  jy observed at 60  @xmath0 m by iras ( joint iras science team 1989 ) .",
    "similarly , an extrapolation to the far infrared implies that the nuclei together produce @xmath25@xmath1810@xmath31 or @xmath240% of the bolometric luminosity of arp  220 .    in this model , the remaining continuum flux at 60100",
    "@xmath0 m must come from the surrounding environment .",
    "this surrounding region can not contribute significant flux at 24.5  @xmath0 m or 1.3  mm , must be transparent at wavelengths shorter than 17.9  @xmath0 m and yet must contribute @xmath260% of the bolometric luminosity of the system .",
    "this would be an extended starburst region of prodigious luminosity ( @xmath32 ) .",
    "we will assume that @xmath121015% of the emission at 24.5@xmath0 m and 1.3  mm , i.e. , flux densities @xmath121  jy and @xmath1230  mjy respectively , would go undetected and could be in this component .",
    "we can fit the spectral energy distribution around 60100  @xmath0 m with a source having a dust temperature of 40  k and an emissivity @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the frequency of the emission . to provide the excess flux of @xmath270 jy at 100 @xmath0 m",
    "the source must be larger than @xmath22@xmath1 in diameter .",
    "this size is also consistent with the source size measured for arp  220 at 350  @xmath0 m by benford ( 1998 ) . if the diameter of this source is taken as 2.6@xmath1 , or @xmath2900  pc , consistent with the observed size of the extended co emission in the source ( scoville , yun & bryant 1997 ) , the optical depth at 100  @xmath0 m is 0.7 . the steep emissivity law , @xmath33 , is necessary to reduce the predicted dust continuum at 1.3  mm to levels that would not be detected in the existing maps ( sakamoto et al . 1998 )",
    "; the fit predicts a flux density of 30  mjy for the 40  k component at 1.3  mm .",
    "this emissivity behavior is physically reasonable based on a lack of resonances at wavelengths @xmath35  100  @xmath0 m in the grains producing the submillimeter continuum .",
    "if the 40  k component is distributed in a disk  like structure , as will be discussed below , it can be nearly optically thick at 100@xmath0 m while allowing more compact structure to be seen at shorter wavelengths .",
    "the low emission of a blackbody of this low temperature in the mid - infrared precludes using the present observations to define this component better . the large extent and luminosity of this component are also consistent with the distribution of the co emission , which places 70% of the molecular gas outside the compact nuclei ( sakamoto et al . ) and with seeing both of the nuclei in absorption at 10  @xmath0 m .",
    "the apparent diffuse emission at @xmath36 17.9@xmath0 m requires that dust significantly warmer than 85  k surrounds the compact nuclei .",
    "this dust is almost certainly heated externally to the compact nuclei , probably as a result of a large extended starburst environment .",
    "this provides a natural explanation of the low level extended mid - infrared emission associated with this region .",
    "it is reasonable that the excitation of the pah emission seen in arp  220 ( smith , aitken & roche , 1989 ; klaas , et al .",
    "1997 ; genzel et al .",
    "1998 ) is associated with the distributed starburst in the same way that similar features are seen in other starburst galaxies such as m82 ( e.g. willner et al 1977 ) .",
    "the observed 7.9 and 8.8  @xmath0 m flux densities in arp  220 from table  2 imply that the 8  @xmath0 m luminosity @xmath374@xmath38 . under the simple assumption that @xmath39/@xmath40 in this extended starburst region is the same as that in m82 ( willner , et .",
    "helou et al 1998 ) , we estimate a bolometric luminosity for this region of 14@xmath41 if the optical depth at 8  @xmath0 m is negligible",
    ". an optical depth at 8  @xmath0 m of @xmath20.51.5 would then be consistent with the observed flux .",
    "such an 8  @xmath0 m optical depth is consistent with the 10  @xmath0 m optical depth of @xmath427 for arp  220 attributed to silicate absorption by smith , aitken & roche .",
    "one possible problem with the extended starburst model is the faintness of the brackett-@xmath14 line .",
    "depoy , becklin & geballe ( 1987 ) observed a faint extended line with a 5@xmath1 diameter beam .",
    "when they corrected for a reddening of 50 mag of visual extinction , the strength of the line corresponded to a starburst luminosity of about 23@xmath1810@xmath43 ( see table  1 of depoy et al . ) which is substantially below the luminosity of @xmath32 discussed above .",
    "further , the amount of extinction to an extended starburst region could be comparable to a@xmath44  =  50  mag if @xmath45 0.7 .",
    "an a@xmath44 of 50  mag is the extinction inferred from the silicate absorption feature corresponding to the total extinction in the central two sources .",
    "the second scenario we present , which can not be distinguished from the first on the basis of these observations , follows from the assumption that there is absorption at 24.5  @xmath0 m , so the intrinsic emission of the nuclei is attenuated by an opacity @xmath46  12 .",
    "the attenuating material is assumed to be in the proximity of the nuclei and is heated and reradiates as well , so that the compact sources provide the luminosity of arp  220 . in support of the assumption that @xmath471 at 24.5  @xmath0 m is the fact that there appears to be silicate absorption at 17.9  @xmath0 m most clearly visible in the eastern component ( figure  2 ) . in order for the compact nuclei to provide the total luminosity of arp  220",
    ", the temperature of the western source must be between 102  k , if the source diameter is 0.39@xmath1 , and 128  k , if the diameter of the source is 0.25@xmath1 . in the former case ,",
    "the extinction to the source is @xmath48  =  1.2 at 24.5 @xmath0 m ; in the latter case it is @xmath48  =  1.5 .",
    "the eastern nucleus has been assumed to have the same spectral energy distribution as the western nucleus and suffer similar extinction . in order to match the observations at 1.3  mm ,",
    "the material surrounding the nuclei must become optically thin at that wavelength ; the calculated values of emissivity are very similar to those proposed for the previous model .",
    "since in this scenario the total bolometric luminosity is provided by the compact nuclei , the need for an extended ( starburst ) region is much diminished , but the long wavelength radiation comes from the absorbing material in the neighborhood of the nucleus .",
    "the overall energetics of the second model are shown in figure  3 ; the gross appearance is much the same as for the first scenario discussed .",
    "the figure emphasizes the fact that , however the luminosity is generated , the 24.5  @xmath0 m observations require a component at a temperature 3050  k and size measured in arc - seconds to radiate some significant fraction of the luminosity of arp  220 . since both models are carefully contrived to fit the present data , we can not distinguish between the two models on the basis of the available observations .",
    "the correct picture is probably some combination of the two pictures described above and involves some extinction at 24.5  @xmath0 m and some starburst activity extended on a 23@xmath1 scale providing some of the luminosity of arp  220 .      independently of the details of the models , the observations of compact sources at 24.5  @xmath0 m and 1.3  mm and the inference that even at 100  @xmath0 m the sources must have substantial optical depth and comparatively small size lead to the conclusion that we are seeing a wide range of source temperatures and sizes with sources that are optically thick at all observed wavelengths shorter than 25  @xmath0 m .",
    "the nuclear disks inferred from the millimeter co observations of sakamoto et al ( 1998 ) and downes and solomon ( 1998 ) present a natural way to accommodate these observations as well as the global feature from figure  1a that the images at all wavelengths from 3.4524.5  @xmath0 m show the same qualitative structure .",
    "if the east and west sources are both disks viewed such that both are reasonably close to the plane of the sky ( i.e. significantly away from edge on ) , the apparent global morphology will be the same at all wavelengths , the size will increase with wavelength and at each wavelength the source can appear to have significant optical depth . if the disks are warped and thick , the outer disk could provide the apparent cold silicate absorption through which the hotter material is seen .",
    "thus we conclude that the infrared observations of arp 220 are entirely consistent with the tilted disks suggested from the millimeter co data .",
    "the observed emission at wavelengths @xmath517.9  @xmath0 m is well in excess of that predicted for either of the scenarios described above .",
    "specifically , at 12.5  @xmath0 m an 85  k blackbody of 0.39@xmath1 diameter emits 75  mjy , compared to the observed emission of 269  mjy , while if the attenuation keeps increasing @xmath49 , the emission from an attenuated 100130  k blackbody is @xmath51  mjy . because dust opacity increases to shorter wavelengths",
    ", this can not be a result of seeing deeper into a uniform distribution of material .",
    "undoubtedly , the nuclear region is geometrically complex and must include non - uniform extinction over both nuclei .",
    "the disks seen by sakamoto et al .",
    "( 1998 ) provide a natural means of allowing visibility into regions that appear optically thick at long wavelengths while allowing radiation at shorter wavelengths to escape .    in any viable model",
    ", the luminosity of arp  220 , or a significant fraction of it , is generated in a volume @xmath210@xmath50  pc@xmath51 , with an energy output per unit volume @xmath52100 times that in the extended nuclear starburst in m82 .",
    "no direct observational evidence has been presented for a non - stellar origin of the luminosity originating in the nuclei of arp  220 .",
    "high excitation infrared fine structure lines such as [ o iv ] 24  @xmath0 m and [ ne v ] 14  @xmath0 m have not been detected in arp  220 in recent observations with iso sws ( genzel et al . 1998 ) .",
    "the present results show that the nuclei in arp  220 are probably optically thick even at 24.5  @xmath0 m , and therefore the existence of a central agn in these nuclei can not be probed even with these mid - infrared lines .",
    "high spatial resolution imaging of the nuclear regions of arp  220 from 3.4524.5  @xmath0 m has shown that the central source consists of at least two compact sources with diffuse emission surrounding them .",
    "both compact sources are heavily obscured at 10  @xmath0 m due to silicate absorption .",
    "the western nucleus is marginally spatially resolved and provides , depending on the detailed structure , at least 3070% of the bolometric luminosity of arp  220 .",
    "the source that generates this luminosity must have a luminosity density @xmath52100 times that of the starburst region in m82 .",
    "the optical depth inferred for this source implies that there is likely no meaningful probe of the power source short of radio wavelengths .",
    "the large number of supernova remnants reported by smith et al .",
    "( 1998 ) clearly demonstrates that young stars must be contributing significantly to the luminosity of this source . the eastern nucleus appears to contribute about one - third the luminosity of the western nucleus , and appears to be spatially extended in the northeast direction .",
    "despite the fact that there is significant extinction of 3.4524.5  @xmath0 m radiation in arp  220 , the presence of emission at 3.4512.5  @xmath0 m indicates that there are lines of sight to hotter regions relatively free of extinction .",
    "the two models we have proposed , one in which the majority of the total luminosity is produced in an extended star formation region and another in which the majority is produced in two compact but extincted regions , both allow a geometry in which short wavelength emission can escape .",
    "disks of material with the range of temperatures described here which are inclined to our line of sight provide a natural mechanism for achieving this .",
    "if the extinction to the western source at 24.5  @xmath0 m is small , the western source has a brightness temperature at 24.5  @xmath0 m of 85  k ; if the extinction is actually higher , it will be hotter .",
    "both models must therefore include hot ( t  @xmath3585  k ) embedded sources , and hence the radiative transfer in both implies that the colder surrounding material , which will emit most strongly at wavelengths greater than 60  @xmath0 m , must be extended .",
    "if most of the luminosity is generated in the compact sources , this extended emission will have a size @xmath521@xmath1 in radius whereas if most of the luminosity is generated outside the nuclei , this colder extended region must be at least 50% larger .    both of these models can reproduce the bolometric luminosity of the galaxy if the flux is extrapolated to 60100  @xmath0 m where the bulk of the luminosity of arp  220 is observed .",
    "both are also consistent with the measured sizes of the nuclear region in co and continuum dust emission .",
