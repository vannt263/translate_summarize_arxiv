    "one of the characteristics of classical gravitation is the existence of horizons , surfaces which divide spacetime into causally distinct regions .",
    "the most striking example is the black hole horizon , the boundary which hides the events within from the outside world .",
    "cosmological models also possess horizons of a different sort ; a given observer generally can not see all of the other observers in the universe at a given time .",
    "if the expansion rate in comoving time is less than linear , then previously unseen objects enter the observer s horizon .",
    "if it is faster than linear ( inflationary expansion ) , then objects leave the horizon .",
    "horizons are of course lightcones , and the notion of an event being within or without a horizon means being at a timelike or a spacelike separation , respectively .",
    "it is expected that quantum metric fluctuations should smear out this precise distinction , and hence smear out the classical concept of a horizon .",
    "information could presumably leak across the horizon in a way that is not allowed by classical physics .",
    "bekenstein and mukhanov @xcite have suggested that horizon fluctuations could lead to discreteness of the spectrum of black holes .",
    "several other authors @xcite have recently made proposals for models which describe the horizon fluctuations . in this paper , we will propose a different model , in which quantized linear perturbations of the gravitational field act as the source of the underlying metric fluctuations .",
    "our analysis will be based on the formalism for the study of lightcone fluctuations proposed in ref .",

    ". we will also give a critical assessment of the previous attempts @xcite to estimate the horizon fluctuations .",
    "@xcite , henceforth i , a model of lightcone fluctuations on a flat background was developed .",
    "it was assumed that the quantized gravitational field is in a squeezed vacuum state .",
    "this is the natural quantum state for gravitons produced by quantum particle creation processes , as for example in the early universe . here",
    "we wish to generalize this formalism to the case of curved background spacetimes .",
    "consider an arbitrary background metric @xmath0 with a linear perturbation @xmath1 , so the spacetime metric is @xcite @xmath2 for any pair of spacetime points @xmath3 and @xmath4 , let @xmath5 be one half of the squared geodesic separation in the full metric , and @xmath6 be the corresponding quantity in the background metric .",
    "we can expand @xmath5 in powers of @xmath1 as @xmath7 where @xmath8 is first order in @xmath1 , ect .",
    "we now suppose that the linearized perturbation @xmath1 is quantized , and that the quantum state @xmath9 is a `` vacuum '' state in the sense that we can decompose @xmath1 into positive and negative frequency parts @xmath10 and @xmath11 , respectively , such that @xmath12 it follows immediately that @xmath13 in state @xmath9 . in general , however , @xmath14 , where the expectation value is understood to be suitably renormalized .",
    "this reflects the quantum metric fluctuations .",
    "we now wish to average the retarded green s function , @xmath15 , for a massless field over the metric fluctuations . in a curved spacetime",
    ", @xmath15 can be nonzero inside the future lightcone as a result of backscattering off of the spacetime curvature",
    ". however , its asymptotic form near the lightcone is the same as in flat spacetime : @xmath16 we will ignore the backscattered portion , and average this delta - function term over the fluctuations , following the method of i. the result is @xmath17 the effect of the averaging has been to replace the delta - function by a gaussian with a finite width determined by the magnitude of the quantity @xmath18 , which is the measure of the lightcone fluctuations .",
    "the operational meaning of the smeared lightcone can be understood by considering a source and a detector of photons .",
    "if we ignore the finite sizes of photon wavepackets , then in the absence of lightcone fluctuations , all photons should traverse the interval between the source and the detector in the same amount of time .",
    "the effect of the lightcone fluctuations is to cause some photons to travel slower than the classical light speed , and others to travel faster . the gaussian function in eq .",
    "( [ eq : retav ] ) is symmetrical about the classical lightcone , @xmath19 , so the quantum lightcone fluctuations are equally likely to produce a time advance as a time delay .    in order to find the magnitude of the lightcone fluctuations in a particular situation ,",
    "it is necessary to calculate @xmath20 for the metric in question , as well as @xmath18 in the appropriate quantum state .",
    "this enables one to find @xmath21 , the mean time delay or advance ( measured in a suitable reference frame ) .",
    "this is an ensemble averaged quantity , not necessarily the expected variation in flight time of two photons emitted in rapid succession . to find the latter quantity , one must examine a correlation function",

    "we have @xmath29 and hence the geodesic length between a pair of points in the perturbed metric is @xmath30 , where @xmath31 thus @xmath32 and hence @xmath33 . if we average over the metric fluctuations , the result is @xmath34 where @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "an analogous expression holds for the case of a spacelike geodesic , in which the integrations are over the proper length parameter of the geodesic : @xmath37 where now @xmath38 is the tangent to the geodesic , and @xmath39 is the proper length .",
    "here we have @xmath40 .    as noted previously , the quantity @xmath18 is formally divergent and needs to be renormalized .",
    "this may be done by defining the graviton two - point function , @xmath41 using , for example , the hadamard renormalization scheme proposed by brown and ottewill @xcite .",
    "these authors give a detailed prescription for expanding the singular , state - independent parts of the scalar and vector two - point functions in an arbitrary curved spacetime .",
    "hadamard renormalization consists of subtracting this expansion from a given two - point function .",
    "this procedure seems not to have been developed in detail for the graviton two - point function , but there seems to be no barrier in principle to doing so .",
    "et al _ @xcite have applied the hadamard renormalization method to the graviton two - point function in the vicinity of a cosmic string . in this paper , we will be content with simple approximations or order of magnitude estimates , and will not require the full renormalization machinery .",
    "consider a spatially flat robertson - walker universe , for which the metric may be written as @xmath42 in general , this spacetime has `` particle horizons '' associated with the comoving observers across which other observers may appear or disappear . in the case of a radiation or matter dominated universe with an initial singularity ( @xmath43 or @xmath44 , respectively ) ,",
    "a given observer at a given time has not yet received any light signals from distant observers , who are said to be outside of the first observer s horizon . in the case of de sitter space ( @xmath45 ) ,",
    "a given observer eventually ceases to receive signals from other comoving observers , and views them as having moved outside of the horizon .",
    "clearly , these cosmological horizons are observer dependent in a way that black hole event horizons are not , and are basically the past lightcone of a given observer at a given time .",
    "nonetheless , it will be of interest to estimate the magnitude of the quantum fluctuation of these horizons in various models .    we must first study timelike and spacelike geodesics in the limits in which these approach null geodesics over some interval . because the lightcone fluctuations are symmetrical , we may focus our attention on the timelike case .",

    "only the purely spatial components of @xmath64 are nonzero , and they each satisfy the wave equation for a massless , minimally coupled scalar field in this metric .",

    "the horizon fluctuations are more strongly suppressed .",
    "note that the proper time required for the infalling observer to pass from @xmath200 to @xmath209 is @xmath213 .",
    "this is always large compared to @xmath208 for large black holes : @xmath214 thus the only outgoing photons which manage to cross the classical horizon are part of an extreme tail of a gaussian distribution .",
    "[ figure 3 ]    an observer falling across the future horizon , @xmath215 , of a black hole emits photons which reach @xmath171 . in the presence of metric fluctuations ,",
    "these photons need not follow the classical lightcone ( solid line ) , but rather may follow timelike or spacelike paths in the background geometry ( dotted lines ) .",
    "the characteristic variation in emission time , as measured in the frame of the infalling observer , of photons which reach @xmath171 at the same point is @xmath208 .    as in sect .",
    "[ sec : desit ] , we may express the time delay or advance in terms of the variation in frequency seen by the observer at infinity .",
    "in the black hole case , the analog of eq .",
    "( [ eq : freqvar ] ) is @xmath216 thus as the source approaches @xmath217 , the fractional variation in frequency observed at infinity goes to zero , and the observed frequency approaches that predicted by classical relativity .",
    "let us now turn to the question of whether horizon fluctuations are capable of invalidating the semiclassical derivation of the hawking effect .",
    "first let us recall the essential features of this derivation , as given in hawking s original paper @xcite .",
    "consider the spacetime of a black hole formed by gravitational collapse ( figure 4 ) .",
    "the null ray which forms the future horizon leaves @xmath170 at advanced time @xmath218 .",
    "the modes into which the outgoing thermal radiation will be created leave @xmath170 at values of @xmath52 slightly less than @xmath219 , pass through the collapsing body , and reach @xmath171 as outgoing rays , on which the retarded time @xmath220 is constant .",
    "hawking shows that the relation between the values of @xmath52 and of @xmath220 is @xmath221 where @xmath222 is a constant .",
    "thus @xmath223 as @xmath224 .",
    "as seen by an observer at infinity , these outgoing rays must hover extremely close to the horizon for a very long time .",
    "if one starts with a black hole with a mass @xmath174 large compared to the planck mass , the semiclassical description should hold for the time required for the black hole to lose most of its original mass .",
    "let @xmath225 be this characteristic evaporation time .",
    "the basic problem posed by the horizon fluctuations is that they may cause an outgoing ray to either fall back into the black hole , or else to prematurely escape . in either case",
    ", the semiclassical picture of black hole radiance would need to be modified at times less than @xmath226 .",
    "[ figure 4 ]    the spacetime for a black hole formed by gravitational collapse .",
    "the shaded region is the interior of the collapsing star .",
    "a null ray which leaves @xmath170 with advanced time @xmath219 becomes the future horizon , @xmath215 . a ray which leaves at an earlier time @xmath52 passes through the collapsing body and reaches @xmath171 at retarded time @xmath220 .",
    "the dashed line is the worldline of a observer who falls into the black hole after its formation .    at a large distance from the black hole , @xmath227 . if the observer at `` infinity '' is at a fixed value of @xmath160 ( e.g. @xmath228 ) , then @xmath229 for most of the black hole s lifetime . thus , in order not to invalidate the semiclassical treatment , outgoing rays with @xmath230 need to be uninfluenced by the horizon fluctuations",
    "in order to investigate this question , let us consider an infalling observer with @xmath231 .",
    "from eq .",
    "( [ eq : drdt ] ) , we have that near @xmath217 @xmath232 and hence @xmath233 this equation may be integrated to yield @xmath234 where @xmath235 is a constant .",
    "this relation tells us the value of @xmath160 at which the infalling observer crosses a given constant @xmath220 line .",
    "the constant @xmath235 is determined by which infalling observer we consider . here",
    "we are interested in observers who fall into the black hole not long after its formation , and we can set @xmath236 .",
    "let @xmath237 be the value of @xmath160 at which this observer crosses the @xmath238 line , given by @xmath239 near the horizon , eq .",
    "( [ eq : drdtau ] ) tells us that @xmath240 along the worldline of the infalling observer . thus the proper time",
    "required for this observer to cross from @xmath238 to the classical horizon at @xmath217 is @xmath241 we should compare this quantity with @xmath208 , where @xmath242 is evaluated at @xmath243 , so @xmath244 .",
    "thus , @xmath245 and hence so long as @xmath246 , @xmath247 . from this result",
    ", we conclude that the horizon fluctuations do not invalidate the semiclassical derivation of the hawking effect until the black hole s mass approaches the planck mass .",
    "this is the point at which we would expect the semiclassical treatment to fail .",
    "the presence of frequencies far above the planck scale , in the form of the modes leaving @xmath170 , has concerned numerous authors .",
    "there have been suggestions that one might be able derive the hawking effect in a way that transplanckian frequencies do not arise , using some form of `` mode regeneration '' @xcite .",
    "so far , it has not been possible to implement these suggestions in detail . as seen from the our analysis of horizon fluctuations ,",
    "the semiclassical treatment is remarkably robust .",
    "in the preceeding sections , we have analyzed the horizon fluctuation problem using a formalism which takes account of the effects of quantized linear perturbations of the gravitational field upon lightcones . in the case of the cosmological models treated in sect .",
    "[ sec : cosmo ] , the resulting horizon fluctuations were found to be of planck dimensions for both de sitter space and a radiation filled universe with a planck density of gravitons at the planck time .",
    "these fluctuations are measured as fluctuations in the time of emission of a photon as measured in the frame of a comoving observer .",
    "the order of magnitude of the results is what one might have guessed before doing the calculation .    in the case of black hole horizon fluctuations ,",
    "the results are somewhat more subtle .",
    "whether the time scale which characterizes the horizon fluctuations ( the time delay or advance ) is of planck dimensions or not depends crucially upon the frame of reference .",
    "it is indeed of planck dimensions as measured by an observer at infinity .",
    "however , as measured by an infalling observer , this time is much less than the planck scale , and vanishes as the infalling observer approaches the classical event horizon at @xmath173 .",
    "we further found that this suppression of the horizon fluctuations is exactly what is needed to preserve hawking s semiclassical derivation of black hole radiance for black holes of mass large compared to the planck mass .",
    "our result seems to conflict with the arguments of sorkin @xcite and of casher _ et al _ @xcite .",
    "these authors claim that the horizon fluctuations are much larger than found in the present manuscript .",
    "it should be noted , however , that the physical mechanisms being postulated in refs . @xcite and @xcite",
    "are quite different from that of the present paper .",
    "furthermore , in our opinion , the physical basis of both of these calculations seems to be open to question .",
    "et al _ obtain large gravitational perturbations of the horizon by postulating an `` atmosphere '' of particles near the horizon in large angular momentum modes .",
    "this arises by decomposing the physical quantum state of an evaporating black hole ( the unruh vacuum ) into two pieces which separately have divergent stress tensors on the horizon , the contribution from the boulware vacuum state and a term which these authors call the `` atmosphere '' of particles .",
    "the large stress tensor fluctuations arise in the casher _ et al _ analysis when this `` atmosphere '' undergoes thermal fluctuations .",
    "our objection to this procedure is that the fluctuations of the boulware vacuum energy density are not being considered .",
    "the splitting of the finite unruh vacuum energy density into two singular parts seems rather artificial .",
    "if one chooses such a splitting , then care must be taken to prove that fluctuations in one part are not cancelled by correlated fluctuations in the other part .",
    "et al _ have not done this .",
    "sorkin @xcite uses a newtonian treatment to estimate the gravitational field of a mass fluctuation near the horizon , and its effects on the schwarzschild geometry .",
    "one can certainly question whether a newtonian analysis can be trusted in black hole physics .",
    "however , our primary objection to sorkin s treatment is that the dominant contribution to the horizon fluctuations comes from modes whose wavelength is very small compared to the size of the black hole . the same line of reasoning would seem to lead to large stress tensor fluctuations , and hence large lightcone fluctuations , in all spacetimes including flat spacetime .",
    "in our view , a more reasonable result is one in which significant fluctuations arise only on scales characterized either by the spacetime geometry , or else the chosen quantum state .",
    "an approach to defining stress tensor fluctuations on a flat background which has this property was given in ref .",
    "@xcite . here",
    "the stress tensor fluctuations are defined in terms of products of operators which are normal ordered with respect to the minkowski vacuum state .",
    "recently , the fluctuations of the hawking flux , as measured in the asymptotic region , have been computed @xcite by a similar approach .",
    "it was found that this flux undergoes fluctuations of the same order as its average value over time scales of the order of @xmath174 .",
    "this average flux is of order @xmath248 , so the characteristic associated black hole mass fluctuation is of order @xmath249 .",
    "the corresponding metric fluctuation near the horizon is then of order @xmath250 . for macroscopic black holes ,",
    "this is much smaller than the metric fluctuations due to the quantized linear perturbation , estimated in eq .",
    "( [ eq : hsq1 ] ) to be of order @xmath249 .",
    "this analysis does not rule out the possibility of much larger stress tensor fluctuations in the vacuum energy near the horizon .",
    "however , the diagonal and off - diagonal components of the expectation value of the stress tensor in the unruh state near the horizon are of the same order @xcite .",
    "it is thus plausible that the fluctuations in these various components near the horizon are also of the same order .",
    "if so , then the effects of quantized linear perturbations of the gravitational field dominate over those of stress tensor fluctuations .",
    "it must be emphasized that all of the conclusions obtained in the present manuscript are in the context of a model of linearized quantum gravity .",
    "furthermore , much of our discussion is of a heuristic , order - of - magnitude nature .",
    "if the basic picture of horizon fluctuations which we have drawn is correct , much work remains to be done to make the picture more precise .",
    "we would like to thank tom roman , alex vilenkin and serge winitzky for helpful discussions .",
    "this work was supported in part by the national science foundation under grant phy-9507351 and by conselho nacional de desevolvimento cientifico e tecnolgico do brasil ( cnpq ) .",
    "units in which @xmath251 will be used in this paper .",
    "thus the units of mass , length and time differ by factors of @xmath252 from the usual definitions of the planck mass , planck length , and planck time .",
    "as most of the discussion in this paper deals with order of magnitude estimates , this should not cause any confusion .",
