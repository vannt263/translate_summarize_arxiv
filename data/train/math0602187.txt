    "the dynamics of solitons in the presence of external potentials has been studied in high velocity or semiclassical limits following the work of floer and weinstein @xcite , and bronski and jerrard @xcite  see @xcite for recent results and a review of the subject .",

    "see @xcite .    the proof of the two theorems , given below in  [ proof][resolution ] , proceeds by approximating the solution during the `` interaction phase '' ( the interval of time during which the solution significantly interacts with the delta potential at the origin ) by the corresponding linear flow .",
    "this approximation is achieved , uniformly in @xmath29 , by means of strichartz estimates established in  [ ros ] .",
    "the use of the strichartz estimates as an approximation device , as opposed to say energy estimates , is critical since the estimates obtained depend only upon the @xmath0 norm of the solution , which is conserved and _ independent _ of @xmath30 .",
