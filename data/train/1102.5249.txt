    "for a bipartite system prepared in an entangled state , a local measurement on one of the two subsystems will affect the other subsystem owing to the nonlocal features  of the entanglement@xcite . however , entanglement is not always necessary for illustrating the non - localities in a quantum system@xcite . in 1998 , a model of deterministic quantum computation with one qubit ( dqc1 ) is proposed for quantum computing by using highly mixed states@xcite , which has been experimentally implemented in 2008@xcite . it is a good example illustrating that some highly mixed states , even fully separable , contain intrinsic quantum correlations , and have potential applications in the quantum computing",
    "furthermore , quantum correlation is found to be more robust than entanglement in a noisy environment , which makes the quantum algorithms based only on quantum correlation more robust than those based on entanglement@xcite .",
    "if a bipartite quantum state is in a product state , @xmath0 , with @xmath1 ( @xmath2 ) being the reduced density matrix of subsystem a ( b ) , the state has no quantum correlation .",
    "however , a state with zero quantum correlation is not always a product state .",
    "the quantum correlation of a bipartite state is usually measured by quantum discord , introduced by ollivier and zurek in ref.@xcite .",
    "the question of how to find out whether a quantum state has zero quantum discord or not is fundamentally important ; it is the first step to distinguish the quantum features of a bipartite state from the classical . for example",
    ", it is shown that zero quantum discord between a quantum system and its environment is necessary and sufficient for describing the evolution of the system through a completely positive map@xcite .",
    "in addition , a quantum state can be locally broadcasted if and only if it has zero quantum discord @xcite . recently",
    ", a necessary and sufficient condition for nonzero quantum discord was proposed@xcite , with the help of a correlation matrix , derived from the density matrix , and its singular value decomposition . in this paper",
    ", we present a simpler method for judging zero quantum discord , where we only need to partition the density matrix into @xmath3 block matrices ( @xmath4 : the dimension of one subsystem ) , and check some properties of these block matrices .",
    "this method is valid for arbitrary bipartite states and easy to implement .",
    "an example with a scheme to experimentally realize it , is proposed in order to test this criterion .",
    "based on this new criterion , we also prove that the positive operator - valued measurement ( povm ) @xcite can not extinguish the quantum correlation of a bipartite state with nonzero quantum discord .",
    "ollivier and zurek introduced the concept of quantum discord to quantify the quantum correlation of a bipartite state , which is defined as the difference between two conditional entropies ( classically equivalent quantities)@xcite , @xmath5,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath6 is calculated by @xmath7 with @xmath8 and @xmath9 , and @xmath10 is the von neumann entropy of the quantum state @xmath11@xcite . here",
    "the subsystem a is regarded as the system and b as the apparatus . @xmath12",
    "represent a set of local projectors on b , rather than the povm used in ref.@xcite . in the calculation , different set of projectors will give out different values of quantum discord for the same quantum state . how to find out the set of local projectors which yields minimum quantum discord is very difficult@xcite .",
    "in a given basis , @xmath13 ( @xmath14 and @xmath15 ) , arranged as @xmath16 , an ab bipartite quantum state can be described by the following density matrix , @xmath17 which has zero quantum discord if and only if it can also be written as@xcite @xmath18 with @xmath19 being real or complex numbers and @xmath20 ( @xmath21 ) being a particular set of local projectors on b. the quantum state in the form of eq.([equ3 ] ) is called pointer state@xcite , in which one can locally access the information in the system without changing the whole density matrix . since the evaluation of quantum discord is asymmetric , and depends on which subsystem",
    "is chosen as the system and which one is the apparatus , the zero quantum discord of the quantum state ( [ equ3 ] ) with the subsystem b being the apparatus , does not guarantee the zero quantum discord for a being the apparatus .    the @xmath22 matrix in eq.([equ2 ] )",
    "can be partitioned into @xmath3 blocks , @xmath23 with each block being an @xmath24 matrix , @xmath25 which means the state([equ2 ] ) or ( [ equ4 ] ) is equivalent to , @xmath26 we rewrite the quantum state eq.([equ3 ] ) in the basis @xmath13 , @xmath27 where the local unitary transformation @xmath28 connects @xmath12 and @xmath20 through the relation @xmath29 . in order to make eq.([equ6",
    "] ) have the same form of eq.([equ7 ] ) , all block matrices @xmath30 must be able to be diagonalized by the same unitary transformation @xmath28 , @xmath31u^{\\dag},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which gives us the following relation , @xmath32=0.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the matrix satisfying eq .",
    "( [ equ8 ] ) or ( [ equ9 ] ) is called normal matrix@xcite .",
    "in addition , since all @xmath30 are diagonalized by the same unitary matrix @xmath28 , @xmath33 they have the same eigen - vectors .",
    "any two normal matrices have the same eigenvectors if and only if they commute with each other@xcite .",
    "consequently , we can conclude the criterion for zero quantum discord now : all @xmath3 blocks @xmath30 in eq.([equ4 ] ) are normal matrices ( satisfying eq.([equ9 ] ) ) , and must commute with each other .",
    "this criterion has the advantage that we can directly work on the matrix eq.([equ2 ] ) in any tensor product basis , without the need to find out the particular basis , @xmath20 , required in the criterion of eq.([equ3 ] ) .",
    "as we all known , a bipartite state with zero quantum discord , see eq.([equ3 ] ) , must be a separable state .",
    "based on the new criterion , we can conclude that if a density matrix is composed of diagonal block matrices , it represents a separable state , which is valid for bipartite systems in any dimension .",
    "however , inverse case is not true . a separable state does not necessarily to have a density matrix composed of diagonal block matrices . given a high dimensional bipartite or multipartite quantum state , how to efficiently verify its separability or entanglement is still an open question .",
    "we stress here that although commutation relations are used to describe the criterion of zero quantum discord , just as done in ref.@xcite , the present criterion has no direct connection with that in ref.@xcite .",
    "the number of commuting matrices used in ref.@xcite , denoted as @xmath34 , is equal to the rank of the correlation matrix , which is smaller than or equal to the minimal one between the two squared dimension degrees of the two subsystems a and b , i.e. , @xmath35 .",
    "however , the number of commuting matrices used in our criterion is fixed as @xmath3 , with @xmath4 being the dimension of the subsystem a. furthermore , all the commuting matrices used in ref.@xcite are hermitian operators , while the commuting matrices in our criterion can be non - hermitian or hermitian , which depend on the density matrix itself .",
    "if a quantum state @xmath36 has been verified to have zero quantum discord , we can obtain @xmath28 and @xmath20 by diagonalizing any non - zero one of the block matrices @xmath30 in eq.([equ5 ] ) . from eqs .",
    "( [ equ6 ] ) and ( [ equ10 ] ) , we have @xmath37 with the diagonal matrix @xmath38 , which tells us that the reduced matrix @xmath2 can also be diagonalized by the unitary matrix @xmath28 .",
    "let us now consider an example .",
    "given a class of two - qubit x - state in the basis of @xmath39 , @xmath40\\right),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we can check whether the above states have zero quantum discord through three steps .",
    "+ ( 1 ) partition the density matrix ( [ equ14 ] ) into four blocks : @xmath41 + ( 2 ) check whether the four blocks are normal matrices ( satisfying eq.([equ9 ] ) ) : yes here .",
    "+ ( 3 ) check whether all of them commute with each other : as    @xmath42     + @xmath43 +    the equality @xmath44 holds true only when @xmath45 , @xmath46 or @xmath47 . in the case of @xmath48 , the unitary transformation @xmath49 diagonalizes the four matrices in eq.([equ15 ] ) , and the local projectors @xmath20 in the pointer state are @xmath50 and @xmath51 . for @xmath45 and @xmath47 , the four matrices in eq.([equ15 ] ) are already diagonal(or zero matrix ) , and @xmath52 is just the set of local projectors used in the pointer state .",
    "the quantum discord of this state can directly be calculated by using the results in refs.@xcite , which is @xmath53\\text{log}_2[0.5+(-1)^k\\sqrt{2x(1 - 2x)}].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the zero quantum discord occurs only when @xmath45 , @xmath46 or @xmath47 , which is the same as predicted by using our criterion .",
    "now we propose an experimental scheme to test the criterion based on the above x - state ( [ equ14 ] ) , which can be generated through the following procedure .",
    "the entangled photon pairs from the type - i parametric down conversion are in the state , @xmath54 is the angle of the pump polarization direction with respect to the vertical orientation , and the two optical axis of the non - linear crystals are arranged in horizontal and vertical orientations ( h and v)@xcite , respectively , see fig .",
    "an electro - optical modulator ( eom ) in path a , switched on ( acting as a half - wave plate ) or off ( performing nothing ) through the control of a random number generator ( rng ) , convert , with probability @xmath55 , the polarization of the photon in path a from v to h , or vice versus@xcite",
    ". the quantum state after the eom is ,    [ equ18 ] @xmath56 latexmath:[\\ ] ] and thus the above statement can be easily proven through the commutation relations among the blocks of the original density matrix @xmath36 , and also of the density matrix @xmath74 .",
    "therefore , the above criterion for zero quantum discord is valid for all types of local measurement , including povm .",
    "to summarize , we derive a new criterion for zero quantum discord of arbitrary bipartite states , which is easy to be implemented with three steps : ( 1 ) partition the density matrix of the @xmath75 quantum state into @xmath3 block matrices ; ( 2 ) check whether every block is a normal matrix ( commuting with its hermitian transpose ) ; ( 3 ) check whether all block matrices commute with each other . for a bipartite state with zero quantum discord , we can find out the set of projectors , which do not change the whole state after being imposed on one of the subsystems , by diagonalizing any non - zero block matrix of its density matrix .",
    "this set of projectors provides a way to locally access the information in the system without disturbing the whole state . a class of two - qubit x - state is used to test the criterion , which can be experimentally implemented .",
    "it is also shown that povm ca nt extinguish the quantum correlation of a bipartite state with nonzero quantum discord , although it may have an effect on the evaluation of non - zero quantum correlation .",
