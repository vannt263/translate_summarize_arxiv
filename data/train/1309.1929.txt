    "many celestial bodies ( planets , stars , galaxies ... ) possess their own magnetic field , either by induction from an external field , or by a natural dynamo mechanism . up to now",
    ", only two kinds of natural forcing have been identified as dynamo - capable in celestial bodies : ( i ) thermo - solutal convection @xcite , which is the standard mechanism generally applied to all planetary configurations even if it is not proved to be always relevant ; and ( ii ) precession @xcite , a purely mechanical forcing that may drive dynamos in some planets and moons @xcite , despite a well - known controversy on its energetic budget ( see @xcite for critisms of this hypothesis , and @xcite for its rehabilitation ) . on earth today , the magnetic field is very likely generated by thermochemical convective motions within the electrically conducting liquid core , driven by the solidification of its inner core .",
    "however , the origin of the magnetic field in the early earth , in the moon , in ganymede or in mars is more uncertain , and leads to the consideration of alternative dynamo mechanisms @xcite .",
    "the recent discovery of fast magnetic reversals on the extra - solar star tau - boo @xcite , which may be related to strong tidal effects due to the presence of a massive close companion @xcite , also requires to re - evaluate classical models of convective dynamos .",
    "indeed , even when the dynamo is of a convective origin , the role of other driving mechanisms can be very important in the organization of fluid motions .",
    "in addition to convection and precession , two other mechanisms have also been proposed to be of fundamental importance to drive cores flows , and consequently to influence planetary magnetic fields : libration and tides . as recently shown in @xcite ,",
    "both these forcings are indeed capable of extracting huge amount of rotational energy to create complex three - dimensional motions through the excitation of a so - called elliptical instability , also called tidal instability in the astrophysical context .",
    "the elliptical instability is a generic instability that affects any rotating fluid whose streamlines are elliptically deformed ( see for instance the review by * ? ? ?",
    "a fully three - dimensional turbulent flow is excited in the bulk as soon as ( i ) the ratio between the ellipticity @xmath0 of the streamlines and the square root of the ekman number @xmath1 is larger than a critical value of order one and ( ii ) a difference in angular velocity exists between the mean rotation of the fluid and the elliptical distortion . in a planetary context , the ellipticity of streamlines is related to the tidal deformation of the planetary layers .",
    "a differential rotation is generically present between the core fluid and the dynamic tides in non - synchronized systems ; it also appears between the static bulge and the core fluid because of librations in synchronized ones .",
    "the elliptical instability is then refereed to tide driven elliptical instability ( tdei ) and libration driven elliptical instability ( ldei ) , respectively .",
    "so far , magneto - hydrodynamic ( mhd ) simulations of stellar or planetary flows have been performed in spherical , and recently spheroidal ( i.e. axisymetric around the rotation axis ) , geometries , which facilitate and accelerate the computations but also prevent the growth of any elliptical instability .",
    "because of the small amplitudes of tidal bulges , this approximation could be thought to be correct .",
    "but since the elliptical instability comes from a parametric resonance , even an infinitesimal deformation can lead to first order modifications of the flow @xcite . to study its mhd consequences ,",
    "we have thus developed the first numerical mhd simulations in a triaxial ellipsoidal geometry , which are presented below .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : num ] , the numerical method used to solve mhd flows in a non - axisymmetric geometry is described . in section [ sec : valid ] , validations of our method are presented , considering kinematic dynamos with different mesh elements and boundary conditions , but also a thermally driven dynamic dynamo following the standard benchmark proposed by @xcite . in section",
    "[ sec : mhd_elliptic ] , the code is finally used to study induction processes by the elliptical instability .",
    "these simulations are then used to systematically study the decay rates of the magnetic field when the external magnetic field is suddenly shut down .",
    "since the pioneering work of @xcite , numerical simulations have more and more deeply studied how a convective dynamo process can generate a magnetic field in a rotating shell .",
    "many comparisons with the observational data , mainly obtained on earth but also on other planets of the solar system , have been done to confirm the relevance of these simulations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* for a review ) .",
    "some key features like the dipole dominance , the westward drift and the occasional reversals of the magnetic field , are recovered by various codes . however , due to computational costs , the dimensionless parameters used in numerical simulations are very different from the realistic values of planetary cores @xcite . to get as close as possible to the real parameter values",
    ", the numerical codes are optimized and massively parallel .",
    "usually , numerical simulations of magneto - hydrodynamic flows in planetary cores benefit from their spherical geometry to use fast and precise spectral methods . however , since global communication is required ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , such methods are difficult to parallelize . following the precursory work of @xcite , some studies have been performed using local methods , more easily adapted to parallel architectures , and thus more suitable for massively parallel computations : see for instance the works of @xcite using finite - element methods ; the works of @xcite using finite - volume methods ; and the work of @xcite using spectral elements .",
    "besides , even if all these previous studies have been performed in spheres , local methods also have the great advantage of providing robust and accurate solutions for arbitrary geometries , which is of direct interest for our study of flows driven in triaxial ellipsoidal geometries .",
    "we consider a finite volume of conducting fluid of kinematic viscosity @xmath2 , density @xmath3 , magnetic diffusivity @xmath4 and electrical conductivity @xmath5 , rotating with a typical rate @xmath6 and enclosed in a rigid container of typical size @xmath7 . using @xmath7 as a lengthscale , @xmath8 as a time scale , and @xmath9 as a magnetic field scale , where @xmath10 is the vacuum magnetic permeability , the magnetohydrodynamics equations in the non - relativistic limit ( equivalently , considering only timescales greater than the relaxation time of the charge carriers ) write @xmath11 where @xmath12 are",
    "respectively the velocity , pressure and magnetic fields , and @xmath13 is the total magnetic field accounting for a possible constant and uniform @xmath14 , representing the imposed external magnetic field in induction problems .",
    "the right - hand side term @xmath15 in equation ( [ u1 ] ) corresponds to the so - called laplace ( or lorentz ) force .",
    "dimensionless numbers are the ekman number @xmath16 , and the magnetic reynolds number @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the magnetic prandtl number . in this work",
    ", the no - slip boundary condition is systematically used for the fluid . note that a coriolis force @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the rotation vector of the working frame of reference , is introduced here for generality and will be used in section [ valid4 ] .",
    "once the magnetic field is solved , the maxwell s system of equations allows us to deduce the current density @xmath21 , the electric potential @xmath22 and the charges distribution @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the electric permittivity of the fluid .",
    "usually , numerical simulations of magneto - hydrodynamic flows in planetary cores benefit from their spherical geometry to use fast and precise spectral methods . in our case",
    "however , we do not consider any simple symmetry .",
    "our computations are thus performed with a standard finite - element method , widely used in engineering studies , which allows to deal with complex geometries and to simply impose the fluid boundary conditions . however , solving the magnetic field with local methods gives rise to some difficulties that we have to cope with . in the finite - element community ,",
    "the mhd simulations are usually done with a formulation in terms of magnetic potential vector defined by @xmath25 ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which ensures that the field remains divergence free at any time . equations ( [ induc_b]-[div_free ] ) are thus replaced by @xmath26 naturally , the two mhd equations ( [ induc_b]-[div_free ] ) can be recovered from equations ( [ induc_a]-[induc_a2 ] ) . the absence of gauge , usually introduced in potential vector formulation ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , prevents us from dealing with purely insulating domain .",
    "indeed , in such domains , the electric field is the lagrange multiplier associated with the constraint @xmath27 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "this imposes to use a supplementary variable @xmath28 , which is a lagrange multiplier to ensure the gauge @xmath29 .",
    "the variable @xmath28 is equivalent to the pressure @xmath30 for the velocity field .",
    "consequently , since we do not impose any gauge , we can not use perfectly insulating materials in the following .",
    "thus , we model them by very weakly conducting domains compared to the metallic ones .",
    "the non - local nature of the magnetic boundary conditions is a long - standing issue in dynamo modeling . usually with spectral methods ,",
    "the matching of the magnetic induction at the boundaries with an outer potential field is easily tractable .",
    "however , using local methods , a main issue remains regarding the conflict between local discretization and the global form of the magnetic boundary conditions . as reviewed in @xcite ,",
    "different solutions have been proposed in the literature to cope with this problem .",
    "the so - called quasi - vacuum condition @xmath31 ( @xmath32 being the local normal vector ) , which is a local condition representing for instance an outside domain made of a perfect magnetic conductor ( @xmath33 ) , has been used by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the immersion of the bounded domain into a large domain where the magnetic problem is also solved has been used by @xcite and improved by @xcite in using the potential vector .",
    "the combination of the local method with an integral boundary elements method ( bem ) has been introduced by @xcite by coupling a finite volume method with the bem . here ,",
    "following @xcite , we choose solutions ( i ) or ( ii ) , depending on the considered problem .",
    "when the solution ( ii ) is used , we impose on a distant external spherical boundary the magnetic condition @xmath34 , which corresponds to @xmath35 .",
    "to solve the complete mhd problem , we use the commercial software comsol multiphysics^^. for the fluid variables , the mesh element type is the standard lagrange element @xmath36 , which is linear for the pressure field and quadratic for the velocity field . note that higher order elements such as @xmath37 would have a better convergence rate with the number of mesh elements but would impose a significant supplementary computational cost . for a given computational cost , the use of @xmath36 elements allows to use a finer mesh .",
    "lagrange elements are nodal elements , well adapted to solve for the velocity field .",
    "however , as reminded by @xcite , the use of this kind of elements in a straightforward nodal continuous galerkin finite - element method is known to lead to the appearance of spurious , non - physical solutions ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* for a review ) .",
    "their origin has several interpretations such as a poor representation of the large null space of the involved operator ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) or the generation of solutions that violate the divergence conditions , which are typically not imposed directly @xcite .",
    "another difficulty is that the singular component of the solution may be not computed if the interface between a conductive medium and a non - conductive medium is not smooth ( see the lemma of * ? ? ?",
    "finally , difficulties appear on the coupling of fields across such an interface . a first way to overcome these difficulties is to use specific method such as interior penalty discontinuous galerkin methods ( e.g. * ? ? ? * for mhd applications ) .",
    "a second way to solve this problem is to construct elements adapted to the operator . in a pionnering work",
    ", @xcite shows that the use of special curl - conforming elements @xcite allows to overcome the problem of spurious modes .",
    "finite - element methods based on such curl - conforming elements , also called ndlec s edge ( or vector ) elements , constitute now the dominating approach for solving geometrically complex problems ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "an important advantage of edge elements is that they ensure the continuity of tangential field components across an interface between different media , while leaving the normal field components free to jump across such interfaces , which is a typical property of electromagnetic problems ( see also * ? ? ? * for details ) .",
    "this also implies that the curl of the vector field is an integrable function , so these elements are suitable for equations using the curl of the vector field , such as the potential vector .    in this work ,",
    "the mesh element type employed for the magnetic potential vector is thus the ndlec edge element , either linear or quadratic depending on the considered problem .",
    "the number of degrees of freedom ( dof ) used in most simulations of this work ranges between @xmath38 dof for kinematic dynamos and @xmath39",
    "dof for full mhd problems with a magnetic reynolds number about @xmath40 .",
    "we use the so - called implicit differential - algebraic solver ( ida solver ) , based on backward differencing formulas ( see hindmarsh et al .",
    "2005 for details on the ida solver ) .",
    "the integration method in ida is variable - order ( and variable - coefficient bdf ) , the order ranging between 1 and 5 . at each time",
    "step the system is solved with the sparse direct linear solver pardiso ( www.pardiso-project.org ) . up to know ,",
    "the commercial software comsol multiphysics^^ was not parallelized , and all computations were performed on a single workstation with 96 go ram , and two processors intel^^ xeon^^ e5520 ( 2.26 ghz , 8 mb cache ) .",
    "note that each numerical simulation presented in this work typically requires 64 go ram and was performed on a single processor , which leads to typical cpu times of half a day for kinematic dynamos and induction calculations and cpu time of weeks when the full dynamo problem is solved .",
    "note also that the latest version of comsol multiphysics^^ delivered in the summer 2011 should allow parallelized calculations and we hope to access to a significantly increased numerical power very soon .",
    "in addition to their purely scientific interest , results presented in this paper should thus be considered as a first step towards solving mhd numerical problems with this commercial software .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     we validate here these results by considering the so - called @xmath41 mode of the elliptical instability , which is oscillating @xmath42 times faster than the rotation rate of the flow . to do so",
    ", the length @xmath43 of the ellipsoid is fixed to @xmath44 ( see * ? ? ? * for details ) . the typical magnetic field induced by the mode ( 1,3 )",
    "is represented in figure [ cebronfig71]a . in figure",
    "[ cebronfig71]b , the excellent agreement between the theoretical and numerical growth rates of the instability confirms the general validity of the joule damping @xmath45 .",
    "the viscous damping coefficient is found to be equal to @xmath46 in our simulations , which is in the expected range .",
    "the expression ( [ mhd_eq ] ) is compared with the numerical data in figure [ cebronfig72]a on both the spin - over mode and the mode ( 1,3 ) .",
    "we defined @xmath47 , where @xmath48 is the quadratic mean value of the magnetic field defined by ( [ eq : brms ] ) , @xmath49 and where the wavelength @xmath50 is equal to @xmath51 for the spin - over mode and @xmath52 for the mode ( 1,3 ) .",
    "the typical velocity @xmath53 corresponds to the amplitude @xmath54 of the @xmath41 mode , which is determined by @xmath55 , where the brackets indicate an average on time and @xmath56 is the base flow before the destabilization of the elliptical instability .",
    "this method is less accurate than the method used in the section [ spinover ] for the spin - over but is more generic because it can be used for any excited mode .",
    "the collapse of the numerical induced magnetic fields @xmath57 for the spin - over mode and the mode ( 1,3 ) at a same distance from the threshold , and the very close values of the amplitude of the flow and the magnetic field in both cases , confirm the validity of ( [ mhd_eq ] ) . finally in figure [ cebronfig72]b , the phase angle shift suggested by ( [ mhd_eq ] ) between the velocity and the induced magnetic field is validated .",
    "a recent paper by @xcite shows the apparition of the elliptical instability in a librating rigid triaxial ellipsoid , i.e. in the case where the whole ellipsoid is rotating at a modulated angular rate @xmath58 . here , @xmath59 is the angular amplitude of libration in radians and @xmath60 is the angular frequency of libration . using the mean equatorial radius @xmath7 as the length scale and @xmath8 as the time scale , the dimensionless angular rate reads @xmath61 , with the dimensionless libration frequency @xmath62 and the forcing parameter @xmath63 .",
    "note that this situation is reminiscent of the flow dynamics in the core of synchronized bodies on average , such as for instance the galilean moons europa and io .",
    "as demonstrated theoretically in @xcite , a libration driven elliptical instability ( ldei ) grows in certain ranges of libration frequencies . in presence of an imposed magnetic field",
    "@xmath14 parallel to the rotation axis , this analysis gives the theoretical growth rate of the ldei in the limit of large wavenumbers @xmath64 and for @xmath65 @xmath66 with the elsasser number @xmath67 and a viscous damping coefficient @xmath68 $ ] . in an astrophysical context",
    ", the joule damping term can significantly modify the stability property of the flow , and the induced field can participate in the magnetic fluctuations measured for instance in the vicinity of europa , which is probably the most unstable of the jovian moons @xcite    our purpose here is to validate these theoretical predictions . to do so , we use the hydrodynamic numerical model first presented in @xcite .",
    "note in particular that we work in the frame rotating with the ellipsoid , which leads to add the so - called poincar force to the navier - stokes equation ( [ u1 ] ) .",
    "in addition to this previous study , a uniform magnetic field is imposed along the rotation axis , whereas the ellipsoid is immersed into a sphere of radius @xmath69{abc}$ ] where the motionless medium is @xmath70 times less electrically conductive than the fluid . as in section [ spinover ]",
    ", we use a magnetic prandtl number @xmath71 . in order to favorize the apparition of the ldei ,",
    "we choose @xmath72 , @xmath73 , @xmath74 , @xmath75 , and the ekman number @xmath76 is fixed at @xmath77 ( see * ? ? ?",
    "the expression of the growth rate ( [ eq : sigldei ] ) shows that a small ekman number is needed to reach the threshold , because the destabilizing term @xmath78 is of order two .",
    "the increased computational cost imposed by the value of the ekman number allows us to perform only three simulations , for @xmath79 .",
    "the excited mode of the ldei in these simulations appears to be a spin - over mode with an oscillating direction .",
    "the obtained numerical growth rates are shown in figure [ cebronfig8 ] and confirm the validity of the joule damping term .",
    "concerning the magnetic field strength , at the point of radius @xmath80 and longitude @xmath81 in the equatorial plane ( @xmath82 ) , already considered in figure [ cebronfig2]b , the magnetic field is radial and equal to @xmath83 for @xmath84 , and @xmath85 for @xmath86 . considering that the theory presented in section [ spinover ] is still valid for this slightly oscillating spin - over , the theoretical values obtained for the same parameters @xmath0 and e are respectively @xmath87 and @xmath88 , which are close to the numerical values .",
    "ccc +   +    following our induction studies , the next step of our numerical study is to determine whether or not the elliptical instability is dynamo capable . to answer this question , and starting from an induction configuration",
    ", we can suddenly shut down the externally imposed magnetic field and report the decay / growth rate of the induced magnetic field as a function of the magnetic reynolds number .",
    "figure [ cebronfig9 ] shows our first numerical results .",
    "we are restricted to magnetic reynolds numbers @xmath17 lower than @xmath89 .",
    "indeed , the mesh needed to solve higher magnetic reynolds numbers leads to a large computational cost , up to now inaccessible .",
    "figure [ cebronfig9]a shows the typical dipolar decaying magnetic field for the spin - over mode .",
    "figure [ cebronfig9]b shows the systematic report of the decay rate for the spin - over mode and the mode ( 1,3 ) , at various ekman numbers , using an insulating outer medium ( ratio of conductivities @xmath90 ) .",
    "the collapse of the points along the scaling law @xmath91 shows that the relevant control parameter is as expected the magnetic reynolds number .",
    "this indicates also that a purely diffusive behaviour is obtained in this range of magnetic reynolds numbers . note that this does not preclude a dynamo capability of the flow .",
    "indeed , for comparison , the decay rates for a full numerical mhd simulation of a sphere precessing at an angle of @xmath92 and a precession rate @xmath93 ( which corresponds to the case studied in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) are also reported for @xmath94 . according to @xcite ,",
    "the dynamo threshold is obtained for @xmath95 , at least if the role of the small inner core present in his study is negligible .",
    "the points represented in figure [ cebronfig9]b are close to the points corresponding to elliptical instability flows and do not allow to predict such a dynamo capability .",
    "note that these results are also close to the decay rate reported by @xcite in his study of the kinematic dynamo ability of the poincar flow in a precessing spheroid of aspect ratio @xmath96 .",
    "figure [ cebronfig9]c is the same as figure [ cebronfig9]b except that pseudo - vacuum conditions are used at the outer boundary .",
    "most of the points follow the purely diffusive trend",
    ". however , the mode ( 1,3 ) seems to leave the purely diffusive behaviour for the larger @xmath97 , which is very encouraging .",
    "such a trend leads to expect a dynamo capability of the flow .",
    "in conclusion , numerical simulations of dynamo are tractable with the commercial software comsol multiphysics^^ , based on a finite - element method .",
    "successfull validations have been obtained for kinematic dynamos on a ponomarenko - like problem and a von karman flow , and also on the thermally driven dynamic dynamo of the @xcite benchmark .",
