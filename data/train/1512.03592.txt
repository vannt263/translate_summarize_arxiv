    "one natural question concerning stick knots may be the _ stick number _ @xmath0 of a knot @xmath1 which is defined to be the minimal number of sticks for construction of the knot type into a stick knot .",
    "since this representation of knots has been considered to be a useful mathematical model of cyclic molecules or molecular chains , the stick number may be an interesting quantity not only in knot theory of mathematics , but also in chemistry and physics .",
    "although it seems to be not easy to determine @xmath0 completely for arbitrary knot @xmath1 , which is usual for any other minimality invariats of knots , there are some literatures in which the range of @xmath0 was theoretically investigated @xcite .",
    "especially , in 1991 , negami found upper and lower bounds on the stick number of any nontrivial knot @xmath1 in terms of the crossing number @xmath2 @xcite : @xmath8 here the crossing number @xmath2 is the minimal number of double points in any generic projection of the knot type into the plane @xmath9 . in @xcite",
    "it was questioned whether it is possible to improve the negami s inequalities : to describe specifically ,    1 .",
    "is there any knot satisfying @xmath10 ?",
    "2 .   is there any knot satisfying @xmath11 other than the trefoil knots ?",
    "the negami s lower bound was slightly improved by calvo @xcite .",
    "and recently elifai showed that the answer for the first question is negative for the knots with @xmath12 @xcite .",

    "it is known that the _ right - handed trefoil knot _ in figure [ fig1 ] and its mirror image(called _ left - handed trefoil _ ) are the only knot types with @xmath17 . and their stick numbers are exactly six . therefore , from our theorem , we can conclude that the second question is negative for any knot type other than the trefoil knots .    in the rest of this paper we will prove theorem [ thm : main ] by investigating the relation among stick number @xmath0 , crossing number @xmath2 and another minimality quantity , _ arc index _ @xmath18 .",
    "we introduce some definitions necessary for the proof of theorem [ thm : main ] . a continuous map from the unit circle into @xmath19",

    "we construct another stick knot @xmath55 in which the @xmath56-coordinate of each @xmath40 may be changed into some integer @xmath57 , while its @xmath58-coordinates are preserved . concretely , if we denote the @xmath50-th horizontal stick of @xmath55 by @xmath59 , then @xmath60 and @xmath61 in @xmath62 . the height @xmath57",
