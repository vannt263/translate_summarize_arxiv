    "one of the most striking properties of quantum mechanics is that it is intrinsically random . moreover , if there exist only a slightly random processes , then also entirely free ones do @xcite .",
    "random number generation is an important issue in computer science .",
    "random numbers have many applications in such topics as cryptography , authentication @xcite , gambling and system modeling .",
    "most of the random number generators ( rngs ) are basing on purely algebraical manipulation on initial seed .",
    "since the series of numbers produced by such generators are created in a deterministic manner , these rngs are called pseudo  random number generators ( prngs ) .",
    "there also exist rngs basing on some chaotic classical physical processes such as electric or atmospheric noise or by estimating the entropy of hardware interrupts ( for example in @xmath0 rng on linux systems ) . to make sure that given source of numbers is reliable",
    ", some statistical tests may be applied @xcite .",
    "still , these tests can never give a guarantee that the numbers were indeed trustworthy , that is they can not be predicted by an adversary .    in this situation",
    "it is natural to try to use properties of quantum mechanics in order to generate entirely random sequences of numbers .",
    "there were efforts making use of such quantum processes like nuclear decay ( for example hotbits @xcite ) or photons hitting a semi  transparent mirror ( for example i d quantique rngs @xcite ) .",
    "however when using one of the commercially available quantum random number generators ( qrngs ) we still have to trust the vendor of the device .    therefore many efforts have been made in the quantum information theory to attain a reliability while not trusting the device and even not knowing how does it work .",
    "such an approach , introduced in @xcite , is called device independent . instead of investigating the internal working of the device in some case",
    "it is sufficient to perform tests on its outputs .",
    "recently the violation of certain bell inequalities as a certificate of randomness for series from rng has been used within the device independent approach@xcite .",
    "these protocols were randomness expanders , as they use some initial amount randomness to obtain more more of it . in @xcite as a certificate of randomness the violation of the chsh bell inequality@xcite was used , while in @xcite the ghz correlations were used instead .",
    "suppose there is a honest vendor that wants to produce and sell qrngs .",
    "his problem is the lack of trust among his potential customers .",
    "since he does not wants to cheat his clients , he can make the design of his device open .",
    "but still some parties may distrust that the device is construed in declared manner .",
    "the laws of quantum mechanics give him a way to convince his customers , that they do not need to know the internal working of the device to be sure that they get secure randomness .",
    "using some form of bell inequalities , they may check , after some statistical tests , that the device produces certain amount of randomness , regardless of the way it has been constructed .",
    "therefore , our honest vendor can propose that his costumers use the protocol described in @xcite .",
    "however , he still needs to decide which bell inequality to use as a certificate .",
    "this device will consist of three parts : two measurement apparatuses and a source of entangled states .",
    "the vendor s technology limits the quality ( purity ) of the states that his source can produce .",
    "let s assume that they are werner states @xmath1 , that is singlets with admixture of white noise .",
    "the question that we try to answer in this paper is : which certificate allows to guarantee most randomness for the given quality of the source measured by @xmath2 ? using it will allow our vendor to maximally exploit the source he has .    all bell inequalities considered in this paper are maximally violated with pure singlet states . in the noisy case values attainable by bell operators are multiplied by @xmath2 .    in this paper",
    "we first make a short inspection of min  entropy and bell inequalities .",
    "then we present @xmath3 operators , that in noiseless situation may certify two bits of randomness . @xmath4 of them are based on known bell inequalities , braunstein ",
    "caves family @xcite , chsh @xcite and @xmath5 @xcite . after that we describe a method we used to find other certificates",
    ". then we give @xmath4 most interesting examples found this way . using semi ",
    "definite programming we compare the robustness of presented certificates .",
    "finally we investigate the potential of using chsh inequality to improve presented protocols .",
    "one of commonly used measures of randomness is min ",
    "entropy @xcite , denoted @xmath6 . for",
    "given discrete probability distribution @xmath7 it is defined as @xmath8    note that min ",
    "entropy is directly related to the guessing probability of the value of a particular variable with distribution @xmath9 with strategy when one guesses the most probable result . in the context of guessing cryptographic keys ,",
    "entropy is a measure of the difficulty of guessing the easiest single key in a given distribution of keys @xcite .",
    "having some string of characters from a source with given min ",
    "entropy per character it is possible to _ extract _ it s randomness , that is create a shorter string with higher min  entropy per character @xcite .",
    "we use min - entropy as the measure of the efficiency of the protocol throughout the paper .",
    "in this paper we investigate the applicability for randomness certification of selected bell operators , described below .",
    "since we are working in device independent scenario , it is worth to notice that we have no insight into the workings of the device .",
    "we do not know what how alice s and bob s measurements are carried out , which results may even have outcomes predetermined by the constructor of the apparatus .",
    "the only thing we have access to , are outcomes that alice and bob get .",
    "we assume that alice s and bob s devices are separated during the measurements .",
    "this assumption is essential , since only in this case the violation of bell inequality has any meaning .",
    "the separation may be for example space  like , if we assume that the signal may not travel between alice s and bob s part before the results are collected .",
    "if we want the randomness not only to be fair ( for example for gambling and system modeling purposes ) , but also to be confidential ( for example for cryptography or authentication ) , we also have to assume that the untrusted device do not communicate with the world outside . without this assumption",
    "even the fair rng may send the results to the adversary .",
    "we will measure the randomness of a given pair of settings using min  entropy .",
    "for each pair @xmath10 of choices of alice s and bob s measurement settings , there exist a distribution @xmath11 of pairs of outcomes .",
    " entropy of the pair of @xmath10 is the min ",
    "entropy of the distribution @xmath12 .    in the following",
    "we assume that all measurements give results @xmath13 or @xmath14 .",
    "we denote by @xmath15 alice s projector on results @xmath13 and @xmath14 respectively , and similarly @xmath16 for bob .",
    "since outcomes are binary we have @xmath17 , and the same for bob s projectors .",
    "then @xmath18 is the correlation operator .",
    "we denote by @xmath19 the correlations between the binary results obtained by alice when she chooses measurement @xmath20 with bob s results with measurement settings set to @xmath21 .",
    "if @xmath22 is the state describing the whole device ( including alice s and bob s parts , which may be entangled ) , then @xmath23 and @xmath24 may be estimated by collecting statistics of subsequent measurement results .",
    "the measurement settings and the device have to be independent .",
    "one of the ways to assure that is to choose these settings randomly . since in such a situation initial randomness is needed , protocols described below are randomness expanders .    from theoretical point of view",
    "it is important to mention the possibility , that from fundamental point of view both measurement choices and results are predetermined .",
    "this loophole in bell inequalities is called superdeterminism and makes all efforts towards generation of randomness pointless .    below",
    "we present @xmath3 different randomness certification protocols .",
    "first of them is based on a well known braunsein ",
    "caves bell inequalities .",
    "second one makes use of a pair of bell operators , which are a decomposition of chsh inequality .",
    "third one consists of three bell inequalities , with two of them being chsh .",
    "three remaining protocols make use of other bell inequalities described below .      in @xcite a family of chained bell inequalities",
    "was introduced . the general formula for @xmath25 braunstein  caves operator",
    "is @xmath26    the maximal value obtainable in quantum mechanics for @xmath25 braunstein  caves inequality is @xmath27 .",
    "in particular @xmath28 is limited by @xmath29 .",
    "if we consider the source s quality measured by @xmath2 , then the maximal value is multiplied by @xmath2 .",
    "we check the min ",
    "entropy guarantied by the violation of braunstein  caves inequality for the following three cases :    * for @xmath30 for the min - entropy of @xmath31 setting for alice and @xmath32 setting for bob and @xmath33 . ] , * for @xmath34 of settings @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "] , * for @xmath39 of settings @xmath40 .      in this case",
    "instead of taking only a single operator corresponding to some bell inequality , we use more than one for randomness certification .",
    "single chsh operator may be decomposed into other bell operators .",
    "let us consider the following two operators :    [ es ] @xmath43    from uffink s inequality@xcite it follows that the maximal values of [ es ] lie on a circle of radius @xmath44 .",
    "taking into account symmetries of these operators , their maximal values obtainable in quantum mechanics may be parameterized in the following manner :    [ esmax ] @xmath45    with @xmath46 $ ] .",
    "the classical limit for the sum of values of these operators is @xmath44 .",
    "thus for @xmath47 classical and quantum limits are equal .",
    "similarly like for previously described bell operators , if the noise @xmath2 occurs , then the values in [ esmax ] have to be multiplied by this value . in such cases the quantum limit of the sum of [ es ] may be achieved for a wider range of values of @xmath48 .    later in this paper we will examine the min ",
    "entropy for measurement settings pair @xmath49 as a function of @xmath48 for maximal values of the operators [ es ] for different values of noise",
    ". then we will find the optimal angle @xmath48 as a function of noise .",
    "let us note that this protocolcertificate requires both alice s and bob s parts of the device to have only @xmath44 possible measurement settings .",
    "it is the smallest requirements among all presented protocols .",
    "let us consider a scenario in which alice has @xmath51 possible measurement settings and bob has @xmath4 , each having @xmath44 possible outcomes .",
    "in @xcite the following bell operator was used : @xmath52    now let us take two additional bell operators , which are identical to chsh with certain choices of settings :    [ chshs ] @xmath53    the maximal value of [ t3 ] that may be obtained in quantum mechanics is @xmath54 , and for [ chshs ] is @xmath55 .    if we impose on the device a condition that both operators [ chshs ] achieve the value of at least @xmath56 ,",
    "then the maximal value of [ t3 ] is a function of @xmath57 , @xmath58 .",
    "we require the device to obtain this maximal value . in the case",
    "when we cope with noise or imperfections of the device , where @xmath59 , then we have to multiply all [ t3 ] and [ chshs ] by @xmath2 .",
    "assuming these conditions we will check the lower bound on the min ",
    "entropy , as a function of @xmath57 with maximal possible value of [ t3 ] , for alice s setting @xmath60 and bob s @xmath4 .",
    "the three previous cases were chosen by us because they rely , at least to some extent on known bell inequalities . in order to learn more about bell operators certifying randomness",
    "we have used some randomized method of finding them .",
    "most of the known interesting operators are in form @xmath61 where @xmath62 , @xmath63 enumerates alice s settings , and @xmath64 bob s settings .",
    "we have considered operators that have this form with @xmath51 settings for alice and @xmath4 settings for bob . in this case",
    "there is around half a million different operators and we have randomly chosen a representative sample of around 25 thousand for further studies .",
    "then , for each choice we have computed min  entropy with noise parameter @xmath65 using semi",
    " definite programming ( which method is described in more details in section [ sec : results ] with results ) .",
    "the histogram presenting the number of operators that certify given randomness is shown in table [ tab : histogram ] .",
    ".number of bell inequalities that have been randomly chosen depending on the min ",
    "they certify under noise @xmath65 .",
    "[ cols=\">,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "in this paper we presented several certificates for randomness generation protocols . we find that there is no unequivocally most efficient one for all the amounts of noise . on the other hand",
    "some are clearly better than the others .    for low noises ( @xmath66 )",
    "the most randomness may be obtained using the certificate [ prot : bc ] based on braunstein  caves inequality .",
    "this protocol requires @xmath4 binary measurements for alice and for bob and uses only one inequality .    in the case of intermediate noise ( @xmath67 )",
    "the protocol [ prot : modchsh ] with additional chsh condition ( [ sec : chsh ] ) certifies most randomness .",
    "it requires @xmath44 binary measurements for alice and @xmath4 for bob .",
    "protocol [ prot : e0e1 ] based on a pair of operators , @xmath41 and @xmath42 , certifies most randomness among all the compared protocols for high noises ( @xmath68 ) .",
    "it requires @xmath44 binary measurements for both alice and bob and has a parameter @xmath48 that has to be chosen for a particular noise @xmath2 for optimal results .",
    "a comparison of these three protocols is shown on figure [ fig : bestchartlarge ] .",
    ".,scaledwidth=40.0% ]    the conclusion of this paper is that a honest vendor of qrngs should use one of these three protocols , depending on the amount of noise he is expecting the device will have to cope with .    the first interesting fact that our research has revealed",
    "is that there is no single optimal certificate .",
    "but what is even more remarkable is that the three best ones fall into three distinct categories .",
    "certificate [ prot : bc ] is just a bell operator ; [ prot : modchsh ] is a combination of two ; and @xmath41 and @xmath42 are not even bell inequalities , furthermore they have to be considered with different weights .",
    "this proves that there is more than one place to look for optimal certificates and although bell inequality violation is a necessary condition for device independent certification of randomness it is not always a good measure of it .",
