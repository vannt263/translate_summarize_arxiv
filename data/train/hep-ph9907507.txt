    "the investigation of the heavy quark production in high energy hadron collisions provides a method for studying the internal structure of hadrons .",
    "realistic estimates of the cross section of the heavy quark production , as well as their correlations , are necessary in order to plan the experiments on existing and future accelerators .",
    "qcd is the theory of quark and gluon interactions .",
    "the description of hard hadron collisions is possible only at the phenomenological level , reducing the hadron interactions to the parton - parton ones , treated in terms of the hadron structure functions .",
    "the hard process cross section is expressed as the convolution of the parton distributions in the colliding hadrons with the cross section of the elementary sub - process given by the square of the matrix element , calculated in the perturbative qcd .",
    "such an approach can be justified only in the leading logarithmic approximation ( lla ) in the leading order ( lo ) , or in the next to leading order ( nlo ) and so on .",
    "strictly speeking , it is in disagreement with the quantum field theory , where the amplitudes , rather than the probabilities , should be added and/or multiplyed .",
    "thus all theoretical approaches to the high energy hadron interactions are in some sense phenomenological ones .",
    "there are several phenomenological approaches to the calculations of hard processes cross sections in hadronic reactions .",
    "the most popular and technically simplest approach is the so - called qcd collinear approximation , or parton model ( pm ) . in this model",
    "all particles involved are assumed to be on mass shell , having only longitudinal components of the momenta , and the cross section is averaged over two transverse polarizations of the incident gluons .",
    "the virtualities @xmath1 of the initial partons are taken into account only through their densities ( structure functions ) .",
    "the latter are calculated in lla using dglap evolution equation and available experimental data .",
    "the probabilistic picture of `` frozen '' partons underlies this way of proceeding .",
    "the cross sections of qcd subprocess are calculated usually in the lo , as well as in the nlo @xcite .",
    "however the transverse momenta of the incident partons are neglected in the qcd matrix elements in the direct analogy with the weizsaecker - williams approximation in qed .",
    "it allows to describe quite reasonably the experimental data on the total cross sections and one - particle distributions of produced heavy flavours , however it can not @xcite reproduce , say , the azimuthal correlations @xcite of two heavy quarks , as well as the distributions over the total transverse momentum of heavy quarks pairs @xcite , which are just determined by the transverse momenta of incident partons .    the simplest way to incorporate the transverse momenta of the incident partons for the proper description of heavy quark correlations",
    "was suggested in @xcite , as the random shift of these momenta according to certain exponential distribution .",
    "however , this procedure has no serious theoretical background . while the shift of the order of @xmath2 ( @xmath3 300  mev ) looks to be reasonable as having an origin in confinement forces at large distances",
    ", the value @xmath3 1  gev or more should be explained in terms of the perturbative qcd .",
    "moreover , the averaged value of the shift seems to be dependent on the initial energy , kinematical region , etc . the simultaneous description of one - particle distributions over the transverse and longitudinal momenta seems to be impossible @xcite .",
    "another natural method to account for the incident parton transverse momenta is referred to as @xmath0-factorization @xcite , or the theory of semihard interactions @xcite . here",
    "the feynman diagrams are evaluated for the virtual incoming partons with all possible polarizations .",
    "since there are no reason to neglect the gluon transverse momenta @xmath4 and @xmath5 in comparison with the quark masses and transverse momenta in the small @xmath6 domain , the qcd matrix elements of the sub - processes become more complicated .",
    "we obtain them in the lo , the nlo calculations being much more technically hard in this approach than in the conventional pm . on the other hand , the essential and , most probably , the major part of the nlo ( and part of nnlo ) corrections to the lo pm related to the finite values of parton transverse momenta",
    "are already included into lo contribution in case of @xmath0-factorization .",
    "thus one can hope that nlo , nnlo ...",
    "corrections will not be too large in @xmath0-factorization , making it to be more constructive .",
    "the matrix element describing collision of the off - shell partons is not , of course , gauge invariant .",
    "this is the shortness of @xmath0-factorization .",
    "one can use it only in a `` physical '' ( axial or planar ) gauge , where the lo feynman graphs responsible for the parton ( dglap or bfkl ) evolution take a ladder - like form , and the hard cross section can be factorized , that is written as a convolution of the initial parton wave functions with the hard sub - process matrix element squared .",
    "recall , that an unintegrated parton distribution in this case is given not just by the derivative of the integrated parton density with respect to the scale , but includes the double logarithmic ( sudakov ) form factor as well .",
    "this point has been discussed in more detail in @xcite ( see also sect .  3 of the present paper ) .",
    "in feynman gauge this double logarithmic contribution comes from the graphs where the soft gluons embrace the `` hard '' blob , as it is shown , for example , in fig .",
    "1b ( contrary to the pm case shown in fig .",
    "1a ) .    note , that when the initial energy grows , the momentum fraction @xmath6 carrying by the `` active '' ( participating in hard interaction ) parton decreases .",
    "as a rule the smaller @xmath6 the larger number of steps the parton passes in the evolution . having emitted a lot of evolution gluons the parton gains a large transverse momentum @xmath0 .",
    "it explains why a large phenomenological @xmath0 shift is needed to describe the high energy data in terms of the pm .",
    "today it is clear that the @xmath0-factorization approach is self - consistent and predicts the results in reasonable agreement both with the experimental data and with the collinear approximation when the last one can be applied . however , the detailed numerical analysis of hard processes in the framework of @xmath0-factorization is not provided yet .",
    "the predictions of all phenomenological approaches depend significantly on the quark and gluon structure functions .",
    "the last ones are more or less known experimentally from the data of hera , but unknown at very small values of bjorken variable @xmath7 .",
    "however it is just the region that dominates in the heavy quark production at high energies = 1.4gev , at lhc , @xmath8 = 14 tev , the product @xmath9 of two gluons ( both @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the integral variables ) is equal to @xmath12 and the applicapability of the existing structure functions at so small @xmath6 is not clear , see discussion in @xcite . ] .",
    "the main goal of this paper is to compare the results of the conventional parton model and the @xmath0-factorization approach and to explain the source for the differences in their predictions .",
    "we present the main formalism of these approaches as well as the numerical results . to clarify the results we consider very high energies , including the non - realistical one @xmath8 = 1000 tev , and use the simple `` toy '' gluon structure function of the nucleon .",
    "the conventional parton model expression for the heavy quark hadroproduction cross sections has the factorized form @xcite : @xmath13 where @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the structure functions of partons @xmath16 and @xmath17 in the colliding hadrons @xmath18 and @xmath19 , @xmath20 is the factorization scale ( i.e. virtualities of incident partons ) and @xmath21 is the cross section of the subprocess calculated in the perturbative qcd .",
    "it can be written as a sum of lo and nlo contributions , @xmath22 \\biggr ) \\ ; , \\label{shat}\\ ] ] where @xmath23 is the renormalization scale , and the functions @xmath24 , @xmath25 as well as @xmath26 actually depend only on a single variable @xmath27 the expression ( [ pm ] ) corresponds to the process shown schematically in fig .  1a . the main contribution to the heavy flavour production cross section at small @xmath6 is known to come from gluons , @xmath28 .",
    "the principal uncertainties of any numerical qcd calculation are the consequences of unknown scales , @xmath20 and @xmath23 and the heavy quark mass , @xmath29 .",
    "both scales ( sometimes they are assumed to be equal ) are to be of the order of hardness of the treated process , however which value is better to take , @xmath29 , @xmath30 or @xmath31 , remains to be unknown .",
    "principally , the uncertainties should not be essential because of the logarithmical dependence on these parameters .",
    "unfortunately the masses of @xmath32 and @xmath19 quarks are not large enough and it leads to numerically large uncertainties ( see e.g. @xcite ) at the existing energies for fixed target experiments .",
    "another principal problem of parton model is the collinear approximation .",
    "the transverse momenta of the incident partons , @xmath33 and @xmath34 are assumed to be zero , as is shown in fig .  1a , and",
    "their virtualities enter only via structure functions ; the cross section @xmath35 is assumed to be independent on the virtualities .",
    "this approximation considerably simplifies the calculations .",
    "the conventional nlo parton model approach with collinear approximation works quite reasonably for one - particle distributions and the total cross sections ; at the same time there is the serious disagreement with the data on azimuthal correlations and on the transverse momentum distributions of the heavy - quark pair .",
    "the reason is quite clear .",
    "consider the processes of the fusion of two partons , having transverse momenta @xmath4 and @xmath5 , into @xmath36 pair with transverse momenta @xmath37 and @xmath38 . in lo parton model @xmath39 , and the distribution on the transverse momenta of the quark pair coinsides with the distribution on the total transverse momentum of the initial partons .",
    "nlo gives a correction , numerically not very large because the shapes of @xmath40 distribitions in lo and nlo are rather close to each other , see @xcite . in this case the qualitative features in nlo should be the same as lo ones , so the final transverse momentum distributions of the heavy - quark pair only slightly differ from @xmath41-functions , being in contradiction with the existing data @xcite .",
    "it was shown @xcite , that the conventional nlo parton model can describe the experimental data on azimuthal correlations and the momentum distributions of the heavy - quark pair , assuming the comparatively large intrinsic transverse momentum of incoming partons ( @xmath0 kick ) about 1  gev / c .",
    "this procedure is , to a large extent , arbitrary .",
    "let @xmath42 be the total transverse momentum of the pair . for each event",
    "the heavy quark pair , @xmath36 , is boosted firstly to the rest in the longitudinal direction",
    ". then a second transverse boost is performed , giving the pair a transverse momentum @xmath43 ; @xmath44 and @xmath45 are the transverse momenta of the incoming partons , which are chosen randomly , with their moduli distributed according to @xmath46 alternatively , one can proceed as in the previous case , but giving the additional transverse momentum @xmath47 to the whole final - state system ( at the nlo in qcd , this means the @xmath36 pair plus a light parton ) , and not to the @xmath36 pair only .",
    "these two methods lead to similar results @xcite .",
    "however the @xmath0 kick method has no good theoretical background . the general phenomenological expression for the heavy quark production",
    "can be written as a convolution of the initial transverse momenta distributions , @xmath48 and @xmath49 , with squared modulo of the matrix element , @xmath50    here there are two possibilities : + i ) the typical gluon transverse momenta are much smaller than the transverse momenta of produced heavy quarks , @xmath51 , or + ii ) all transverse momenta are of the same order , @xmath52 .    in the first case one",
    "can replace both initial distributions @xmath53 by @xmath41-functions .",
    "it reduces the expression ( [ ge ] ) to the simple form ( collinear approximation ) : @xmath54 in total agreement with weizsaecker - williams approximation .    in the second case we can",
    "not a priory expect good results from the weizsaecker - williams approximation .",
    "however it gives the reasonable numerical results in some cases .",
    "the @xmath0 kick @xcite discussed above effectively accounts for the transverse momenta of incident partons .",
    "it is based on the expression which symbollically reads @xmath55 the main difference from the general qcd expression , eq .  ( [ ge ] ) , is that due to the absence of @xmath33 in the matrix element the value @xmath56 in eq .",
    "( [ kd ] ) has to be differently taken for different processes ( say , for heavy flavour production with comparatively small or large @xmath40 ) .",
    "the reason is that the functions @xmath53 in general qcd expression decrease for large @xmath57 as a weak power ( see next sect . ) , i.e. comparatively slowly , and the @xmath57 dependence of the matrix element is more important .",
    "consider another approach , when the transverse momenta of the incident gluons in the small-@xmath6 region result from the diffusion in the parton ( gluon ) evolution .",
    "the diffusion is described by the function @xmath59 giving the gluon distribution at the fixed fraction of the longitudinal momentum of the initial hadron , @xmath6 , and the gluon virtuality , @xmath1 .",
    "it is approximately determined by the derivative of the usual structure function . although generally it is the function of three variables , @xmath6 , @xmath60 and @xmath1 , the transverse momentum dependence is comparatively weak since @xmath61 for small @xmath6 in lla in agreement with @xmath1-dependences of structure function .",
    "note that due to qcd scaling violation the value @xmath59 for the realistic structure functions increases with decreasing of @xmath6 , and @xmath60 becomes important in the numerical calculations .",
    "the exact expression for @xmath60 gluon distribution can be obtained as a solution of the evolution equation which , contrary to the parton model case , is nonlinear due to interactions between the partons in small @xmath6 region .",
    "the calculations @xcite of the @xmath60 gluon distribution in leading order using the bfkl theory @xcite result in difference from our @xmath59 function only about 10 - 15% .",
    "here we deal with eq .",
    "( [ ge ] ) with the matrix element accounting for the gluon virtualities and polarizations .",
    "since it is much more complicated than in the parton model we consider only lo of the subprocess @xmath62 which gives the main contribution to the heavy quark production cross section at small @xmath6 , see the diagrams in fig .",
    "2 . the lower and upper ladder blocks present the two - dimensional gluon functions @xmath63 and @xmath64 . in terms of the conventional dglap parton distributions",
    "they can be determined as @xcite @xmath65 } { \\partial q^2}\\ .\\ ] ] such a definition of @xmath59 makes it possible to treat correctly the effects arising from the gluon virtualities .    strictly speaking we have to include double logarithmic sudakov - like form factor under the derivative in eq .",
    "( 8) @xcite .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that the probability to find a parton with a given longitudinal momentum fraction @xmath6 and transverse momentum @xmath66 within the lla may be written as @xmath67\\ , \\ ] ] where @xmath68 ; @xmath69 is the double logarithmic ( dl ) sudakov form factor and @xmath70    the first factor in ( 9 ) is evident .",
    "it corresponds to the real contribution / emission in the dglap evolution .",
    "changing the scale from @xmath71 to @xmath72 one produces a new parton with @xmath73 between @xmath71 and @xmath72 .",
    "so @xmath74\\ .\\ ] ] next factor @xmath75 ( @xmath76 for the quarks and @xmath77 for the gluons ) accounts for the virtual loop dglap contribution , which is needed to provide an appropriate normalization of the parton wave function and to satisfy the sum rules ( i.e. the conservation of momentum , flavour , etc . ) .",
    "@xmath69 plays the role of survival probability , i.e. the probability not to emit an extra partons ( gluons ) with the transverse momenta @xmath78 $ ] .",
    "note that in dglap equation , written for the integrated ( including all @xmath79 ) partons , there was a cancellation between the real and virtual soft gluon dl contributions .",
    "emitting a soft gluon with the momentum fraction @xmath80 one does not change the @xmath6-distribution of parent partons .",
    "thus the virtual and real contributions originated by the @xmath81 singularity of a splitting function @xmath82 cancels each other .",
    "contrary , in unintegrated case the emission of soft gluon ( with @xmath83 alters the transverse momentum of parent ( @xmath84-channel ) parton .",
    "( 9 ) includes for this effect through the derivative @xmath85 .    thanks to this last derivative",
    "one obtains a positive unintegrated distribution @xmath86 even at rather large @xmath6 , where ( due to the virtual term in dglap ) the integrated parton density @xmath87 decreases with @xmath71 .",
    "unfortunately , the factor @xmath69 is known with the dlog accuracy only . when @xmath88 there are no double logarithms at all .",
    "so for @xmath88 we put @xmath89 .    in terms of feynman diagrams in a physical ( axial ) gauge the factor @xmath69 comes from the self - energy graphs .",
    "in feynman gauge the self - energy contribution has no double logarithms .",
    "such a double logarithms come from the graphs with the gluons which embrace the hard blob ( an example is shown in fig.1b ) .",
    "any diagram with a soft gluon emitted from one external line of hard blob ( say , gluon @xmath90 ) and absorbed on another external line has the same double logarithm , except of the colour factor .",
    "the sum of colour factors , corresponding to all three graphs ( soft gluon is absorbed by the heavy quark , antiquark or gluon @xmath91 ) , is equal to the colour factor for self - energy diagram .",
    "this way one obtains in feynman gauge the same expression ( 9 ) .",
    "thus the true probability to find a parton with the momentum fraction @xmath6 and transverse momentum @xmath92 is given by the eq .",
    "( see @xcite for more detail ) . to simplify the discussion",
    "we postpone the more exact eq .",

    "kinematic @xmath104 so @xmath105 ( the more accurate relations are @xmath106 , @xmath107 but we are working in the kinematics where @xmath108 ) .",
    "the matrix element @xmath109 is calculated in the born order of qcd without standart simplifications of the parton model . in the axial gauge @xmath110 the gluon propagator takes the form @xmath111",
    "@xmath112    for the gluons in @xmath113channel the main contribution comes from the so called `` nonsense '' polarization @xmath114 , which can be picked out by decomposing the numerator into longitudinal and transverse parts : @xmath115 the other contributions are suppressed by the powers of @xmath116 .",
    "it is easy to check that in axial gauge ( [ prop ] ) @xmath117 and @xmath118 .",
    "thus we effectively get @xmath119 another way to obtain the same result is to use the transversality condition . since the sum of the diagram fig .",

    "both these equations for @xmath127 can be used but for the form ( [ trans1 ] ) one has to modify the gluon vertex slightly ( to account for several ways of gluon emission ",
    "@xcite ) : @xmath128\\ .\\ ] ] as a result the colliding gluons can be treated as aligned ones and their polarization vectors are directed along the transverse momenta .",
    "ultimately , the nontrivial azimuthal correlations must arise between the transverse momenta @xmath37 and @xmath38 of the heavy quarks .    from the formal point of view",
    "there is a danger to loose the gauge invariance in dealing with the off mass shell gluons .",
    "say , in the covariant feynman gauge the new graphs ( similar to the `` bremsstruhlung '' from the initial or final quark line , as it is shown in fig .",
    "2d ) may contribute in the central plato rapidity region .",
    "however this is not the fact . within the `` semihard '' accuracy ,",
    "when the function @xmath59 collects the terms of the form @xmath129 with @xmath130 , the triple gluon vertex ( [ geff ] ) includes effectively all the leading logarithmic contributions of the fig .",
    "2d type @xcite .",
    "for instance , the upper part of the graph shown in fig .",
    "2d corresponds in terms of the bfkl equation to the @xmath84-channel gluon reggeization .",
    "thus the final expression is gauge invariant ( except a small , non - logarithmic , @xmath131 corrections ) . we can completely eliminate the leading logarithm terms arising from fig .",
    "although the situation considered here seems to be quite opposite to the parton model there is a certain limit @xcite , in which our formulae can be transformed into parton model ones , namely when the quark transverse momenta , @xmath96 , are much larger than the gluon ones , @xmath100 .",
    "( [ spp ] ) enables to calculate straightforwardly all distributions concerning one - particle or pair production . to illustrate the difference between our approach and the conventional parton model we present first of all the results of calculations of charm production ( @xmath132 = 1.4 gev @xcite ) with high @xmath40 at three energies , @xmath8 = 1  tev , 10  tev and 10@xmath133  tev and with the same value of @xmath134 i.e. @xmath40 = 10  gev , 100  gev and 10@xmath135  gev for the above energies .",

    "these results are confirmed by those presented in fig .  6 , where we reproduce the data from fig .  3 for lo parton model and @xmath0-factorization approach with the condition @xmath152 . for comparison",
    "we show by stars the @xmath0-factorization predictions for all values @xmath4 with the only condition @xmath174 , versus @xmath153 .",
    "the last results are above the lo parton model even at not too large @xmath5 because the peaks , discussed above , are included into the integral over @xmath4 .",
    "let us note that the calculation of @xmath170 at @xmath8 = 10 tev , @xmath151 = 0.02 , and with restriction @xmath175 ( see fig .",
    "5c ) gives only about 2% of the total value of @xmath170 .",
    "it is necessary to note that the essential values of @xmath100 increase in our calculations when the transverse momentum , @xmath40 of the detected @xmath32-quark increases . at initial energy",
    "high enough , @xmath176 . in the @xmath0 kick language",
    "it means that the @xmath177 value also increases .",
    "the values @xmath178 are presented in fig .",
    "the lower dashed curves correspond to the lo parton model , solid curves  to the @xmath0-factorization approach with unintegrated gluon function @xmath59 given by the simplified expression ( 8) while the dottted and dash - dotted curves embody the double - logarithmic @xmath69-form factor ( 12 ) and use eqs .",
    "( 9 ) and ( 10 ) ( see the discussion in section 3 ) .",
    "recall that from the diagram viewpoint the @xmath69-factor sums up the diagrams containing in the feynman gauge the gluon lines embracing the hard blob as it is shown in fig .",
    "1b . in the axial gauge",
    "the corresponding double log contribution comes from the parton ( gluon ) self - energy insertion , i.e. from the term proportional to @xmath179 in the dglap evolution equation .",
    "the @xmath69-factor reproduces a large part of the virtual nlo corrections with respect to the conventional pm and diminishes the cross section .",
    "it suppresses the contribution coming from small values of parton virtualities , @xmath180 in eq .",
    "( [ spp ] ) .",
    "such a suppression becomes more important at very large @xmath40 as in this case the pm contribution , which is collected from the logarithmically large interval of @xmath181 @xmath182 , starts to dominate .",
    "recall that before we have no `` scale '' problem within the @xmath0-factorization approach since we deal with the explicit integral ( [ spp ] ) over the parton virtualities @xmath183 .",
    "the dependence of qcd matrix element @xmath184 on the @xmath100 values provides the convergency to the integral `` automatically '' fixing the `` scale '' @xmath20 .",
    "after @xmath69-factor is `` switched on '' one gets the problem of scale back .",
    "the scale @xmath71 is not fixed in ( [ sud ] ) at lo accuracy .",
    "the reasonable @xmath71 values are expected to be somewhere between @xmath185 and @xmath186 .",
    "the numerical difference between these values is very small , as one can see from fig.7 .",
    "the rapidity distributions of prodiced charm quark is presented in fig .",
    "again the dashed curves are the results of lo parton model calculations , the solid curves show the results of the @xmath0-factorization approach with unintegrated gluon function @xmath59 given by the simplified expression ( 8) , while the dotted curves embody the double - logarithmic @xmath69-form factor ( [ sud ] ) with @xmath187 and use eqs .",
    "( 9 ) and ( 10 ) .",
    "one can see that the last form factor decrease the cross section calculated in the @xmath0-factorization approach about 1.5 times .",
    "we have compared the conventional lo parton model ( pm ) and the @xmath0-factorization approach for heavy quark hadroproduction . in order to concentrate on the specific features of the approach and not to deal with the pecularities of the parton distributions a simple gluon density ( [ toy ] ) has been chosen .",
    "it has been shown that the contribution from the domain with strong @xmath60 ordering ( @xmath188 ) coincides in @xmath0-factorization approach with the lo pm prediction .",
    "however a very numerically large contribution comes besides this in @xmath0-factorization from the region @xmath189 .",
    "it is kinematically related to the events where the transverse momentum of heavy quark @xmath190 is balanced not by the momentum of antiquark @xmath191 but by the momentum of the nearest gluon .",
    "this configuration is associated with nlo ( or even nnlo , if both @xmath192 ) corrections in terms of the pm with fixed number of flavours , i.e. without the heavy quarks in the evolution .",
    "indeed , as it was mentioned in @xcite , up to 80% of the whole nlo cross section originates from the events where the heavy quark transverse momentum is balanced by the nearest gluon jet .",
    "thus the large `` nlo '' contribution , especially at large @xmath40 , is explained by the fact that the virtuality of the @xmath84-channel ( or @xmath166-channel ) quark becomes small in the region @xmath193 and the singularity of the quark propagator @xmath194 in the `` hard '' qcd matrix element , @xmath184 , reveals itself .    including the double logarithmic sudakov - type form factor @xmath69 into the definition of unintegrated parton density ( [ b ] ) one takes into account an important part of the virtual loop nlo ( with respect to pm ) corrections .",
    "thus we demonstrate that @xmath0-factorization collects already at lo the major part of the contributions which play the role of the nlo ( and even nnlo ) corrections to the conventional pm .",
    "therefore we hope that the higher order ( in @xmath195 ) correction to the @xmath0-factorization would be rather small .",
    "another advantage of this approach is that a non - zero transverse momentum of @xmath196-system ( @xmath197 ) is naturally achieved in @xmath0-factorization .",
    "the typical value of this momentum ( @xmath0-kick ) depends on the parton structure functions / densities .",
    "it increases with the initial energy ( @xmath0-kick increases with the decreasing of the momentum fractions @xmath198 carried by the incoming partons ) and with the transverse momenta of heavy quarks , @xmath40 .",
    "thus one gets a possibility to describe a non - trivial azimuthal correlation without introducing a large `` phenomenological '' intrinsic transverse momentum of the partons .",
    "the main part of the presented calculations were carried out in ictp .",
