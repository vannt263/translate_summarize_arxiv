    "the qze predicts that the decay rate of a system can be slowed down by measuring it frequently enough pra-41 - 2295,pra-42 - 5720,pra-44 - 1466,pascazio .",
    "however some systems are predicted to have an enhancement of the decay due to the frequent measurements , namely the aze or inverse zeno effect @xcite .",
    "the qze and aze have been observed in an unstable system prl-87 - 040402 .",
    "recently , the qze - aze crossover in quantum brownian motion model was investigated @xcite , where a system of damped harmonic oscillator interacts with a bosonic reservoir in thermal equilibrium .",
    "it was found @xcite that controlling the system - environment coupling by an artificially - controllable engineered environment ( e.g. , nature-407 - 57,nature-403 - 269 ) would allow one to monitor the transition from the qze to the aze dynamics .",
    "the qze and aze of a nanomechanical resonator measured by a quantum point contact detector ( non - equilibrium fermionic reservoir ) also was studied @xcite .",
    "therefore , modulating the system and reservoir parameters can induce the qze - aze crossover .    in cavity qed ,",
    "the coupling between the qubit and the cavity , in which the electromagnetic field modes are concentrated around the cavity resonant frequency , depends on the cavity frequency . for an excited qubit located in a cavity ,",
    "the cavity mode is the dominant one available for the qubit to emit photons .",
    "if the qubit energy level spacing is resonant with the cavity mode , the rate of decay into the particular cavity mode is enhanced .",
    "otherwise , it is inhibited .",
    "therefore , one may manipulate the qubit decay rate by varying the central frequency of the cavity mode in or off resonance with the qubit level energy spacing .",
    "the variation of the qubit decay pra-81 - 062131,pra-54-r3750 in the cavity is an increasingly important topic for experimental and theoretical studies prl-85 - 2272,prl-101 - 180402,pra-81 - 062131 .    in this paper",
    ", we propose to modulate the qubit s decay rate in cavity qed by the qze , which means invoke the frequent measurements in the qubit and achieve the transition between qze and aze .",
    "we study a model of a qubit in a cavity , and investigate the occurrence of either the qze or aze by varying the cavity central frequency .",
    "we insert frequent projection measurements in the qubit decay process and find that the normalized decay rate depends on whether the central frequency of the cavity mode is in resonance with the qubit energy level spacing or not . in the resonant case ,",
    "the normalized decay rate is lower than 1 , so the qze of the qubit occurs .",
    "however , when the cavity mode is detuned from the energy level spacing of the qubit , the normalized decay rate is larger than 1 and the qubit exhibits aze .",
    "the variation from the qze to the aze , by varying the central frequency of the cavity mode , should help distinguishing these two kinds of effects .",
    "moreover , we consider the case when both the qubit s intrinsic bath and the cavity bath are simultaneously present . and find the dependence of the behaviors ( the qze and the aze ) on the coupling strength of the qubit - cavity and the cavity central frequency .    the qze - aze crossover may be achieved in a superconducting qubit coupled to a transmission line cavity jqyou , prl-103 - 147003,pra-81 - 042304,pra-69 - 062320 .",

    "[ fig5 ] , only in the short - time regime ( about @xmath221 ) , the normalized effective decay rate of the qubit shows obviously the transition from the qze to the aze .",
    "when the measurement interval @xmath113 increases to @xmath222 , although the transition still exists , @xmath173 for the aze is slightly larger than 1 , which is mainly in the region between @xmath223 and @xmath224    in figs .",
