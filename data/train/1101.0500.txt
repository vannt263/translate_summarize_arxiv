    "the nature of the _ quantum chromodynamics _ ( qcd ) phase diagram as a function of temperature ( @xmath0 ) and baryon chemical potential ( @xmath1 ) has been studied extensively over the last few years @xcite . for @xmath2 ,",
    "finite - temperature calculations have been complemented by first - principle approaches like lattice qcd simulations @xcite . however , for @xmath3 , the lattice simulations are limited to small values of @xmath1 @xcite . in qcd with two massless quarks ,",
    "the chiral phase transition is expected to be second - order at zero baryon densities . in nature , the light quarks are not exactly massless and the sharp second - order transition is replaced by a smooth crossover .",
    "this picture is consistent with lattice qcd simulations with a transition temperature @xmath4 mev @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "calculations based on different effective models show that the transition becomes first - order at large @xmath1 and small @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "this means that the phase diagram will have a _ tricritical point _",
    "( tcp ) , where the first - order chiral transition becomes second - order ( for vanishing quark masses ) or ends ( for non - vanishing quark masses ) .",
    "the location of the tcp ( @xmath5 , @xmath6 ) in the phase diagram and its signature has been been under intense investigation , both theoretically and experimentally @xcite .",
    "heavy - ion collision experiments at high energies produce hot and dense strongly - interacting matter , and provide the opportunity to explore the phase diagram of qcd .",
    "the high-@xmath0 and low-@xmath1 region has been explored by recent experiments in the _ relativistic heavy ion collider _ ( rhic ) .",
    "this region will also be studied by planned experiments in the _ large hadron collider _ ( lhc ) .",
    "further , future heavy - ion collision experiments like the _ beam energy scan _ at rhic , _ fair _ in gsi , and _ nica _ in dubna plan to explore the high - baryon - density region of the phase diagram , particularly around the tcp @xcite .",
    "the experiments at the rhic provide clear signals that nuclear matter undergoes a phase transition to partonic phases at sufficiently large values of the energy density .",
    "however , the nature and kinetics of this transition remains an open question .",
    "we note here that lattice qcd assumes that the system is in equilibrium , whereas heavy - ion experiments are essentially nonequilibrium processes . therefore , information about which equilibrium phase has the lowest free energy is not sufficient to discuss the properties of the system .",
    "one also has to understand the kinetic processes which drive the phase transition , and the properties of the nonequilibrium structures that the system must go through to reach equilibrium .    in this paper",
    ", we study the kinetics of chiral transitions in quark matter .",
    "we focus on far - from - equilibrium kinetics , subsequent to a quench from the disordered phase ( with zero quark condensate ) to the ordered phase .",
    "this rapid quench renders the disordered system thermodynamically unstable .",
    "the evolution to the new equilibrium state is characterized by spatio - temporal pattern formation , with the emergence and growth of domains of the preferred phases .",
    "this nonlinear evolution is usually referred to as _ phase ordering dynamics _ or _ coarsening _ or _ domain growth _ @xcite .",
    "previous studies of ordering dynamics in quark matter , which we review shortly , have primarily focused upon early - time kinetics and the growth of initial fluctuations .",
    "the present paper is complementary to these studies .",
    "we investigate the universal properties ( e.g. , growth laws , scaling of correlation and structure functions , bubble dynamics , etc . ) in the late stages of chiral kinetics .",
    "these properties are robust functions of the evolution dynamics , and only depend upon general features , e.g. , scalar vs. vector order parameters , defect structures , conservation laws which govern dynamics , relevance of hydrodynamic effects , etc . our results in this paper",
    "are obtained using a _ time - dependent ginzburg - landau _ ( tdgl ) model , which is derived from the _ nambu - jona - lasinio _ ( njl ) model with two light flavors @xcite .",
    "however , we expect that our results apply to a much larger class of systems belonging to the same _ dynamical universality class_.    to place our work in the proper context , we provide an overview of studies of dynamical properties of quark matter . these focus on either ( a ) _ critical dynamics _ ,",
    "i.e. , time - dependent behavior in the vicinity of the critical points , or ( b ) _ far - from - equilibrium dynamics _ , which was explained above . in studies of critical dynamics ,",
    "much interest has focused on the tcp .",
    "static universality class _ of the qcd transition ( for non - vanishing quark masses ) is believed to be that of the @xmath7 ising model , but there is debate regarding the dynamical universality class .",
    "for example , the tcp dynamics was argued @xcite to be in the class of _ model c _ in the hohenberg - halperin classification scheme @xcite .",
    "essentially , the argument was that critical dynamics is described by a nonconserved order parameter ( the quark condensate @xmath8 ) , in conjunction with conserved quantities like the baryon number density .",
    "if one includes the mode coupling between the quark condensate and the baryon density , the appropriate universality class is _ model h _ with a different dynamical exponent @xcite . however , it was also argued that reversible couplings can play a crucial role in qcd critical dynamics , which may then differ from that of _ model h _ @xcite .",
    "in related work , koide and maruyama @xcite have derived a linear langevin equation for the chiral order parameter .",
    "this is obtained by applying the _ mori projection operator technique _ to the njl model .",
    "these authors study the solution of the langevin equation , and investigate _ critical slowing down _ in the vicinity of the tcp .",
    "let us next turn our attention to studies of far - from - equilibrium dynamics in quark matter .",
    "sasaki et al .",
    "@xcite have emphasized the importance of _ spinodal decomposition _ in understanding the chiral and deconfinement transitions in heavy - ion collisions .",
    "their study was based on a mean - field approximation to the njl model , as well as a phenomenological landau theory .",

    "( we follow a similar approach in this paper . )",
    "this langevin equation can be derived from a microscopic field - theoretic model of kinetics of the chiral order parameter @xcite .",
    "fraga and krein studied the early - time dynamics of spinodal decomposition in this model both analytically and numerically , and focused upon the effect of dissipation on the spinodal instability . in recent work ,",
    "bessa et al .",
    "@xcite studied bubble nucleation kinetics in chiral transitions , and the dependence of the nucleation rate on various parameters .",
    "skokov and voskresensky @xcite have also studied the kinetics of first - order phase transitions in nuclear systems and qgp .",
    "starting from the equations of non - ideal non - relativistic hydrodynamics ( i.e. , navier - stokes equation , continuity and transport equations ) , they derived tdgl equations for the coupled order parameters .",
    "these tdgl equations were studied numerically and analytically in the vicinity of the critical point . skokov - voskresensky focus upon the evolution of density fluctuations in the metastable and unstable regions of the phase diagram , and the growth kinetics of seeds .",
    "they clarify the role of viscosity in the ordering kinetics . finally , we mention the recent work of randrup @xcite , who has studied the fluid dynamics of relativistic nuclear collisions .",
    "the corresponding evolution equations reflect the conservation of baryon charge , momentum and energy .",
    "randrup studied the amplification of spinodal fluctuations and the evolution of the _ real - space correlation function _ and the _ momentum - space structure factor_. ( we will study the scaling of these quantities in sec .",

    "randrup s work mostly focused upon the evolution in the linearized regime , where there is an exponential growth of initial fluctuations .",
    "this paper is complementary to refs .",
    "@xcite , and investigates the late stages of phase - separation kinetics in quark matter .",
    "the system is described by nonlinear evolution equations in this regime : the exponential growth of initial fluctuations is saturated by the nonlinearity .",
    "we study the coarsening dynamics from disordered initial conditions , and the scaling properties of emergent morphologies .",
    "we consider an initially disordered system which is quenched to the symmetry - broken phase through either the second - order line ( relevant for high @xmath0 and small @xmath1 ) or the first - order line ( relevant for small @xmath0 and large @xmath1 ) in the njl phase diagram .",
    "we study domain growth for both types of quenching , and highlight quantitative features of the coarsening morphology .",
    "we also study the evolution kinetics of single droplets , and the dependence of the front velocity on system parameters .",

    "[ pdct ] , we will also discuss the corresponding landau description of chiral transitions . in sec .",
    "[ kct ] , we introduce the tdgl equation which describes the evolution of the chiral order parameter , and use it to study the kinetics of chiral transitions . as mentioned earlier , we focus on pattern formation in the late - stage dynamics , which is characterized by scaling of the evolution morphologies , and the corresponding domain growth laws .",
    "finally , we end this paper with a summary and discussion in sec .",
    "[ summary ] .",
    "our investigation has several novel features from the perspective of both qcd and domain growth studies .",
    "these can be highlighted as follows .",
    "first , we demonstrate a quantitative mapping between the phase diagrams of the njl model as an effective model of qcd at low energy and the @xmath10-landau potential .",
    "this mapping enables us to identify the relevant time - scales and length - scales in chiral transition kinetics .",
    "second , we clarify the quantitative features of the coarsening morphology , e.g. , correlation functions , growth laws , etc . , in chiral transitions .",
    "these universal features are independent of system and model details , and can be measured in experiments on quark - gluon plasma .",
    "third , the chiral transition provides a natural context to study ordering dynamics in the @xmath10-potential , which has received little attention . to date , most studies of domain growth have focused on the @xmath11-potential , which has a much simpler phase diagram .",
    "finally , as we will discuss elsewhere , chiral dynamics also provides a framework to study the effect of inertial terms in phase ordering kinetics .",
    "studies of domain growth have almost entirely focused on dissipative overdamped dynamics @xcite .",
    "for the consideration of chiral symmetry breaking , we denote the perturbative vacuum state with chiral symmetry as @xmath12 .",
    "we then assume a specific vacuum realignment which breaks chiral symmetry because of interactions .",

    "we have studied the kinetics of chiral phase transitions in quark matter . at the microscopic level , these transitions are described by the nambu - jona - lasinio ( njl ) model . in the njl model with zero current quark mass",
    ", there can be either first - order ( i ) or second - order ( ii ) transitions between a massless quark phase and a massive quark phase .",
    "the lines i and ii meet in a tricritical point . at the coarse - grained level",
    ", chiral transitions can be modeled by a landau potential with an @xmath115-functional .",
    "we have shown that there is a quantitative agreement between the njl free energy as a function of @xmath116 and the landau potential with an appropriate choice of parameters . near the phase boundary",
    ", we can identify the coefficients of the landau energy for different values of ( @xmath117 ) .",
    "however , we often consider parameter values far from the phase boundary , and it is more appropriate to interpret the landau coefficients as phenomenological quantities .",
    "we studied the kinetics of chiral transitions from the massless ( disordered ) phase to the massive ( ordered ) phase , resulting from a sudden quench in parameters .",
    "we model the kinetics using the _ time - dependent ginzburg - landau _ ( tdgl ) equation , which describes the overdamped relaxation of the order parameter field ( scalar condensate density ) to the minimum of the corresponding ginzburg - landau ( gl ) free - energy functional .",
    "we consider quenches through both the first - order and second - order lines in the phase diagram .",
    "there have been some earlier studies of the tdgl equation in this context , as discussed in the introductory sec .",
    "[ intro ] .",
    "however , these have primarily discussed the growth of initial fluctuations in the framework of a linearized theory . on the other hand",
    ", this paper focuses on the late stages of pattern formation where nonlinearities in the tdgl equation play an important role .    for quenches through ii ,",
    "the chirally - symmetric phase is spontaneously unstable and evolves into the broken - symmetry phase via _",
    "spinodal decomposition_. the evolution morphologies show self - similarity and dynamical scaling , and can be quantitatively characterized by the _ order - parameter correlation function _ or its fourier transform , the _ structure factor_. the domains of the massive phase grow as @xmath118 .    for deep quenches through i",
    ", the above scenario applies again .",
    "however , for shallow quenches , the chirally - symmetric phase is metastable .",
    "then , the system evolves via the _ nucleation and growth _ of bubbles or droplets of the preferred massive phase . in this case , the early - stage dynamics is dominated by the appearance of bubbles .",
    "the growth and merger of these bubbles results in late - stage domain growth which is morphologically similar to that for spinodal decomposition .",
    "the correlation function , structure factor and growth law show a crossover , having different functional forms in the nucleation and coarsening regimes .    before concluding , it is important to discuss the relevance of these results for qcd phenomenology and experiments . in the context of heavy - ion collisions , we make the following observations . within the uncertainities regarding values of dimensional quantities for quark matter ( e.g. , surface tension , dissipation ) ,",
    "it is not clear whether the system equilibrates completely within the life - time of the fireball .",
    "if the system is nearly - equilibrated , the features of the coarsening morphology will be similar for quenches through both first- and second - order lines in the phase diagram .",
    "however , if the equilibration time - scale is much larger than the fireball life - time , the morphology is very different for quenches through the first - order line , with the system evolving through nucleation of bubbles .",
    "consequences of such a first order transition have potential relevance since they imply the existence of a critical end point ( cep ) in the qcd phase diagram . as a matter of fact",
    ", experimental studies of such signatures may be more convenient than directly searching for the cep via critical fluctuations .",
    "the latter approach has not provided conclusive evidence of the existence of a cep , presumably due to the smallness of the critical region .",
    "we also stress that relating our results to heavy - ion collision experiments requires information about the source size apart from its life - time . in this context ,",
    "two - particle momentum correlations ( i.e. , the _ hanbury - brown - twiss _ or hbt effect in heavy - ion collisions ) could be relevant . in such two particle correlations ,",
    "the inverse width of the correlation function in the `` out '' direction measures the life - time of the source , whereas the same in the `` side '' direction measures the transverse size of the source @xcite .",
    "thus , the results presented here regarding domain growth and nucleation of bubbles can , in principle , be investigated through two - particle hbt correlations .",
    "this is similar to the study of the hbt effect for particle production from inhomogeneous clusters of qgp fluid @xcite .",
    "finally , the spatial inhomogeneities due to the order - parameter evolution could also have measurable effects on the spatial distribution and integrated inclusive abundances of various hadrons @xcite .",
