    "on the night of 2004 january 23 , jay mcneil discovered a new reflection nebula in the l1630 cloud in orion ( mcneil 2004 ) .",
    "his amazing discovery is now recognized as a newly visible reflection nebula surrounding a * young star *  mcneil s nebula .",
    "new object * ( v1647 ori ) * seems to be a faint optical counterpart to the infrared source catalogued as that has gone into outburst , producing a large reflection nebulosity ( reipurth & aspin 2004 ; abrahm et al .",
    "2004 ; briceo et al .",
    "2004 ; vacca , cushing & simon 2004 ; andrews , rothberg & simon 2004 ; * walter et al .",
    "little is known about the source .",
    "the discovery was announced by b. reipurth in the star formation newsletter no .",
    "136.reipurth/newsletter.htm ] reipurth & aspin ( 2004 ) reported that nir images taken with the gemini 8 m telescope show that the object has brightened by about 3 magnitudes in jhk , relative to the 1998 2mass measurements .",
    "gemini spectra reveal strong features of co and br@xmath3 in emission in the ir ; in the optical , h@xmath4 shows emission with a p cygni profile ( reipurth & aspin 2004 ) .",
    "the mcneil s source at the apex of the nebula was also observed to brighten dramatically in x - ray and optical wavelengths .",
    "the x - ray data from _ chandra _ gives strong evidence that the probable cause of the outburst is the sudden infall of gas onto the surface of the star from an orbiting disk of gas ( kastner et al .",
    "2004 ) .",
    "in this letter we present the infrared morphology of mcneil s nebula as well as infrared monitoring of its central source , especially , in a short ( about one week ) timescale . both of these pieces of information will be useful to understand the nature of this enigmatic source .",
    "we carried out simultaneous jhk@xmath0-band photometry of the mcneil s nebula during five nights from 2004 feb 17 to march 14 and report a significant variation in the source brightness of mcneil s nebula within a period of one week .",
    "these observations also show a new look at mcneil s nebula in nir wavelengths . in ",
    "2 we present the details of observations and data reduction procedures .  3 deals with the results and discussion on short time variability of the star that * illuminates * mcneil s nebula and describe the details of infrared nebula .",
    "we then summarize our conclusions in  4 .",
    "the imaging observations of the mcneil s nebula region in the nir wavelengths j ( @xmath5 = 1.25 @xmath6 m ) , h ( @xmath5 = 1.65 @xmath6 m ) , and k@xmath0 ( @xmath5 = 2.15 @xmath6 m ) were obtained on 2004 february 17 ( 22:00 ut ) , 23 ( 18:36 ut ) , 25 ( 17:55 ut ) , 29 ( 17:48 ut ) , and 2004 march 14 ( 17:51 ut ) with the infrared survey facility ( irsf ) 1.4 m telescope situated at the south african astronomical observatory , sutherland and sirius ( simultaneous three - color infrared imager for unbiased surveys ) , equipped with three 1024@xmath71024 hgcdte arrays .",
    "the field of view in each band is @xmath1 7.7 @xmath7 7.7 , with a pixel scale of 0.45 .",
    "further details of the instrument are given in nagashima et al .",
    "( 1999 ) and nagayama et al .",
    "( 2003 ) .",
    "* for the photometry of the bright nir source , we obtained 10 dithered exposures * of the target centered at ( @xmath4 , @xmath8)@xmath9 = ( @xmath10 , , each 1s long to avoid the saturation , simultaneously for each band during all four nights .",
    "total on - target integration times in each of the bands were 10s for the photometry of bright nir counterpart on all four nights .",
    "we also obtained 10 dithered exposures on 2004 feb 17 each 30s long , 15 dithered exposures on 2004 feb 23 and 25 each 10s long , and 45 dithered exposures each 20s long on 2004 feb 29 and march 14 of the target to study the morphological details of * the reflection nebula*. total on - target integration times in each of the bands were 300s , 150s , 150s , 900s , and * 900s on 2004 feb 17 , 23 , 25 , 29 , and march 14 , respectively*.    the observations on 2004 feb 23 , 25 , and 29 were done under good photometric sky conditions .",
    "the nir images were obtained at high airmass ( @xmath1 1.9 ) and in poor seeing condition ( fwhm @xmath2 2 ) on 2004 feb 17 and the sky condition was not photometric during 2004 march 14 .",
    "therefore we use these observations for the study of the morphological details only .",
    "the average seeing sizes ( fwhms ) in all the bands were 2.2 , 1.6 , 0.9 , 1.4 , and 0.9on 2004 feb 17 , 23 , 25 , 29 , and march 14 , respectively during the observations .",
    "the observations were made at airmasses between 1.2 and 1.4 during 2004 feb 23 - 29 .",
    "dark frames and twilight flats were obtained at the beginning and end of the observations .",
    "the photometric calibration was obtained by observing the standard star 9116 in the faint nir standard star catalogue of persson et al .",
    "( 1998 ) at air masses closest to the target observations .",
    "data reduction was done using the pipeline software based on noao s iraf package tasks .",
    "twilight flat - fielding and sky subtraction with a median sky frame were applied .",
    "identification and photometry of point sources were performed by using the daofind and daophot packages in iraf , respectively .",
    "we used an aperture radius of 16 pixels ( @xmath1 7 ) for the photometry of the mcneil s source .",
    "the local sky was evaluated in an annulus with an inner radius of 64 pixels and a width of 12 pixels .",
    "the composite color images are constructed from the sirius j , h , and k@xmath0-band images ( j represented in blue , h in green , and k@xmath0 in red ) obtained on different seeing ( fwhms ) conditions and are shown in fig .",
    "1 . the lower right panel ( fig .",
    "1d ) shows the rhk@xmath0 ( r : blue , h : green , k@xmath0 : red ) composite color image * of mcneil s * nebula after adjusting the spatial resolutions .",
    "r - band image was acquired using gmos - n camera on the gemini north telescope ( reipurth & aspin 2004 ) . the cometary infrared nebula is clearly seen extending toward north from the nir source ( see figs .",
    "1a , 1b and 1c ) .",
    "* it has a strong morphological resemblance to a ring - shaped nebula , rno 54 , which is associated with an h@xmath4-emission star ( goodrich 1987)*. * the mcneil s nebula * is blue ( bright in j ) and has a cavity structure with two rims extending toward north - east and north - west .",
    "the north - east rim is brighter and sharp , while the north - west rim is diffuse .",
    "the north - east rim can be traced out to @xmath1 40  or @xmath1 16000 au at a surface brightness of k@xmath0 @xmath1 18.2 mag arcsec@xmath11 ( where we assume the distance to l1630 is 400 pc ; anthony - twarog 1982 ) .",
    "this kind of morphology can be probably seen when the eruption has cleared out some of the dust and gas in the envelope surrounding the young star , allowing light to escape and illuminate a cone - shaped cavity carved out by previous eruptions ( reipurth & aspin 2004 ) .",
    "counter cavity structure is not seen toward the south in our image .    in fig .",
    "2 we show the contour diagram of the region around * v1647 ori * as seen in our deep k@xmath0-band image obtained on 2004 feb 29 . the star is surrounded by a compact reflection nebulosity that has a * curved tail ( north - east rim ) characteristic * ( see also reipurth & aspin 2004 ) . there is a southward continuation of the extended nebula that is shown in the psf subtracted image of fig .",
    "is confirmed by comparing the psf of the nir central source which is the counterpart of the iras source with the psf of the star located about 30  south - west of the iras source ( fig .",
    "we thus find that the compact nebula that encloses all the nebular structure including the two rims has an apparent diameter of about 70 . *    the ir / optical comparison of the region surrounding mcneil s nebula ( see figs .",
    "1d and 4 ) shows that the position of the bright infrared source is coincident with that of an optical source at the apex of the nebula that is illuminating the fan - shaped cloud of gas , or nebula ( reipurth & aspin 2004 ) .",
    "it is interesting to compare the morphology of the optical nebula ( see figs . 1d , 4 and fig .",
    "1 of reipurth & aspin 2004 ) and our ir nebula ( figs . 1 - 4 ) .",
    "the optical nebula is more widely and predominantly extended to the north , while the ir nebula is relatively confined but definitely extended to the south , too .",
    "in fact , the ir nebula well matches the reddest parts of the optical nebula .",
    "the bluest portion of the optical nebula is not seen in ir including the blue knot hh 22 to the north - east and the blue patch to the north .",
    "there is a clear color gradient from north to south , as well as from inside to outside the cavity .",
    "the gradient is very steep near the central star and the southern extension of the nebula is seen only at ir .",
    "this large color gradient and the sudden absence of optical nebula to the south is suggestive of a large scale disk - like structure ( or envelope ) surrounding the central source which hides the southern nebula .",
    "this is often the case for the ysos associated with a cometary nebula ( e.g. , tamura et al . 1991 ) .",
    "nir photometry * of mcneil s * source obtained on three nights is listed in table 1 .",
    "a comparison of the jhk@xmath0 magnitudes of * v1647 ori * shows that the source has varied over the time of observation between 2mass ( oct 1998 ) and irsf ( feb 2004 ) .",
    "reipurth & aspin ( 2004 ) have first shown that the object has become brighter by @xmath1 3 mag in j , h , and k@xmath0 bands ( table 1 ) .",
    "our photometry is more accurate ( @xmath12 m @xmath1 0.03 ) than their measurements , although the values are consistent within 0.1 mag error of the gemini data .",
    "we also see a significant variation in the source brightness ( @xmath12j = 0.16 mag , @xmath12h = 0.18 mag , and @xmath12k@xmath0 = 0.22 mag ) during a period of one week ( 2004 feb 23 - 29 ; table 1 ) .",
    "since the difference in magnitudes is much larger than the photometric errors , we believe that this is real . to examine this",
    ", we also did the photometry of three bright reference stars in our ir fov ( see table 2 ) .",
    "as seen in table 2 , we do not see a large variation in the magnitudes of the reference stars .",
    "this further proves that the brightness variation in * v1647 ori * during a period of one week is real .",
    "it also shows that the variability is larger at longer wavelengths than shorter ones and the brightness decreased by about 0.2 mag at j , h and k@xmath0-bands during 2004 feb 23 - 29 ( table 1 ) .",
    "walter et al . (",
    "2004 ) have followed the source in optical and nir wavelengths over the 25 nights ( 2004 feb 11 - may 7 ) and also found a general decline in brightness of about 0.3 - 0.4 magnitudes during these 87 days based on the differential light curves .",
    "they presented the differential photometry * of mcneil s * source in nir wavelengths with respect to the only available comparison star ( 2mass 05461162 - 0006279 ) in their smaller ir fov .",
    "we also examined this 2mass source and found that the brightness of the 2mass source is fairly constant during a period of one week ( see table 2 ) . therefore",
    ", our observations give absolute value to the mcneil s source variability and are more reliable .",
    "5 shows a j - h / h - k color - color ( cc ) diagram . for the purpose of plotting the sirius data in cc diagram ,",
    "we have converted them into the california institute of technology ( cit ) system using the color transformations between the sirius and cit systems ( nakajima et al .",
    ", in prep),sirius/about/color@xmath13e.html ] that have been obtained by observing several of the red standard stars of persson et al .",
    "we notice the changes of the infrared colors from before ( 1998 ) to after the eruption ( 2004 ) .",
    "the star has moved precisely along a reddening vector due to the intrinsic brightening of the star between six years as well as between one week and is moving toward the tip of the locus of classical t tauri stars ( meyer et al .",
    "this suggests that the central source has an nir color similar to a dereddened t tauri star .",
    "it is to be noted that the seeing is almost the same for the data points 1 and 3 but different for point 2 ( fig . 5 and table 1 )",
    "therefore , the comparison between 1 and 3 is more reliable .",
    "the j - h and h - k values indicate that the circumstellar matter of a@xmath14 @xmath1 8 mag was cleared probably in the eruption , in less than six years since the 2mass observations .",
    "there is still a significant amount ( a@xmath14 @xmath1 6 mag ) of circumstellar matter if its original colors are assumed to be those of t tauri stars .",
    "variability in low - mass ysos is known ( e.g. , hartmann 1998 ) .",
    "the total luminosity depends on the mass accretion rate and low mass ysos like fuor and exor types of objects have shown variability of several magnitudes in the optical and nir wavelengths ( @xmath12 m @xmath1 3 - 4 mag ) ( bell et al .",
    "1995 , and references therein ) .",
    "it is possible that we have witnessed an fu orionis kind of behavior as the source has about the right amplitude ( reipurth & aspin 2004 ) . on the other hand exor eruptions , which may occur repeatedly in a given star , have amplitudes that can be comparable to those of fuors but with much shorter durations ( reipurth & aspin 2004 ) .",
    "our data show a significant variation in the source brightness within a period of one week ( table 1 ) .",
    "so far , there have been no infrared data showing such significant variation within a period of one week or so .",
    "further photometric monitoring of the object is required to settle the class of eruptive variables to which source of mcneil s nebula belongs .",
    "in this letter we have presented the short time variability and the new look of the mcneil s nebula in nir wavelengths .",
    "we carried out deep simultaneous nir observations of the mcneil s nebula during five nights . from the analysis of nir images we derive the following conclusions :    \\1 ) the mcneil s nebula has a cavity structure with two rims as seen in the nir images .",
    "this might have been produced by the eruption that has cleared out a part of the envelope surrounding the young star .",
    "2 ) the ir / optical comparison of the mcneil s nebula shows that the optical nebula is more widely and predominantly extended to the north , while the ir nebula is relatively confined but definitely extended to the south , too .",
    "this color gradient of the nebula is most likely due to the presence of a large scale disk around the young star .",
    "\\3 ) the nir photometric data show a significant variation in the source brightness within a period of one week .",
    "4 ) based on the nir photometry , a post outburst extinction ( a@xmath14 ) to mcneil s source appears to be about 6 mag , if the intrinsic jhk@xmath0 colors of the central star are the same as that of a t tauri star .",
