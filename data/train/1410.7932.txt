    "cooper pairs may penetrate into a normal metal ( n ) from a superconductor ( s ) attached to this metal . as a result ,",
    "the latter can also sustain a non - vanishing supercurrent and demonstrate a number of other properties inherent to a superconductor @xcite .",
    "this superconducting proximity effect may be interpreted in terms of the well known phenomenon called `` andreev reflection '' @xcite : cooper pairs reaching the ns interface get converted into subgap quasiparticles which further diffuse into the normal metal maintaining the information about a macroscopic phase of the superconducting condensate . at non - zero temperatures",
    "this macroscopic quantum coherence of single electrons in the n - metal can , however , be destroyed by thermal fluctuations at a typical length of order @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the electron diffusion coefficient .",
    "it follows immediately that at sufficiently low temperature the whole normal metal can become essentially superconducting and such phenomena as , e.g. , meissner effect in ns strucures @xcite , josephson effect in sns junctions @xcite as well as subgap electron transport across ns interfaces @xcite can be observed .",
    "interesting features of the latter phenomenon will be investigated in our present work .    at sufficiently low values of the ns interface transmission",
    "its subgap ( andreev ) conductance @xmath0 is proportional to the second order in the barrier transmission @xcite and , hence , typically it remains rather small .",
    "on the other hand , in the low energy limit @xmath0 can be strongly enhanced due to non - trivial interplay between disorder and quantum interference of electrons in the normal metal @xcite . in the limit of low voltages and temperatures",
    "this effect yields the so - called zero - bias anomaly ( zba ) @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "it is important to note that all these results remain applicable only provided electron - electron interactions in the n - metal can be totally disregarded .",
    "though in some cases this assumption is indeed justified , in general coulomb effects can play a significant role and need to be properly accounted for .",
    "various aspects of subgap electron transport across ns interfaces in the presence of such effects were studied in a number of papers @xcite .",
    "for instance , it was demonstrated @xcite that electron - electron interactions yield _ dephasing of cooper pairs _ in the normal metal which , in turn , can significantly influence the subgap conductance of ns systems . in simple terms",
    "this phenomenon can be interpreted as an effect of fluctuating electromagnetic field produced by fluctuating electrons in a disordered normal metal .",
    "it turns out that such fluctuating field destroys macroscopic coherence of electrons penetrating from a superconductor at a certain characteristic length @xmath7 , thereby imposing fundamental limitations on the proximity effect in ns hybrids at low temperatures @xmath8 . at such temperatures",
    "the penetration depth of superconducting correlations into the n - metal is not anymore determined by the thermal length @xmath9 , but is limited by the dephasing length @xmath10 which  unlike @xmath9  does not diverge at @xmath11 .",
    "it is also worthwhile to point out that the dephasing length @xmath10 obtained for ns systems @xcite up to a numerical prefactor coincides with zero temperature decoherence length derived within a completely different theoretical framework @xcite for the weak localization ( wl ) correction to the conductivity of a disordered normal metal .",
    "this agreement emphasizes fundamental and universal nature of low temperature dephasing by electron - electron interactions in different types of disordered conductors , including ns hybrids analyzed here . at the same time , it was demonstrated @xcite that dephasing of cooper pairs by electron - electron interactions is in several important aspects different from that for single electrons in n - metals .",
    "these aspects will also be illustrated below .    in this work",
    "we will theoretically analyze a combined effect of electron - electron interactions and of an external magnetic field on subgap electron transport in diffusive sn structures .",
    "we will demonstrate that low temperature transport experiments with sn hybrids allow to directly probe the dephasing length of cooper pairs in such systems .     and the diagram describing conversion of a cooper pair into a pair of electrons propagating inside the normal metal . ]",
    "in what follows we will analyze a hybrid sn structure which consists of a normal metallic wire with cross - section @xmath12 and length @xmath13 attached to bulk superconducting and normal electrodes , see fig .",
    "we will assume that the normal wire and the superconducting electrode are connected via a tunnel barrier of the same cross - section @xmath12 and resistance @xmath14 strongly exceeding the wire resistance @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the wire drude conductivity , @xmath17 is the electron charge and @xmath18 is the density of states per spin direction .",
    "we will also assume that a comparatively weak uniform magnetic field @xmath19 is applied to the system .    for our analysis we will employ the keldysh version of the nonlinear @xmath20-model @xcite extended to describe sn structures @xcite .",
    "the keldysh effective action for such systems defined on the time contour with forward ( f ) and backward ( b ) parts is expressed as a sum of two terms @xmath21 which account respectively for diffusive motion of electrons in the wire , @xmath22=\\frac{i\\pi\\nu}{4}\\operatorname{tr}[d(\\check\\partial \\check q)^2-\\check\\xi(4\\partial_t+2i\\omega_z)\\check q+4i\\check\\phi\\check q ] , \\label{swire}\\ ] ] and electron tunneling across the junction @xcite , @xmath23=-\\frac{i\\pi}{4e^2    r_{\\rm i}a^2}\\operatorname{tr}_{\\rm i}[\\check q_{\\rm sc}\\check q ] , \\label{si}\\ ] ] where @xmath24 and @xmath25 are defined on respectively superconducting and normal sides of the insulating barrier , the quantity @xmath26 ( with @xmath27 being the product of a @xmath28-factor and the bohr magneton ) accounts for zeeman splitting , and `` @xmath29 ''   indicates the trace over the matrix indices and the integration over both time and coordinate variables . the covariant derivative is defined as @xmath30 , \\quad \\check\\xi=\\left(\\begin{array}{cc } \\hat \\sigma_z &   0 \\\\ 0 & \\hat\\sigma_z \\end{array}\\right),\\ ] ] where @xmath31 $ ] is the commutator and @xmath32 denotes the set of pauli matrices .",
    "both parts of the action ( [ swire ] ) and ( [ si ] ) contain the @xmath33 dynamical matrix field @xmath25 satisfying the standard normalization condition @xmath34 as well as the scalar and vector potentials @xmath35 and @xmath36 which account for the effect of electron - electron interactions as well as the effect of an external magnetic field @xmath37 . these potentials are defined on the keldysh contour and , hence , one can introduce the variables @xmath38 and @xmath39 and define the matrices @xmath40    as we are merely interested in evaluation of the subgap ( andreev ) conductance it suffices to restrict our consideration to energies well below the superconducting gap . in this limit we set @xmath41 in order to proceed",
    "we will employ the so - called @xmath42-gauge trick @xcite and perform the gauge transformation @xmath43 which eliminates the linear terms in both electromagnetic potentials and deviations from the normal metal saddle point @xmath44 this goal is achieved if one chooses the @xmath42-field to obey the following equations @xmath45 with @xmath46 and @xmath47 . as a result of this transformation the total action retains its initial form provided one substitutes @xmath48",
    ", @xmath49 and @xmath50 .    treating the tunneling term ( [ si ] ) perturbatively and performing the integration over the @xmath25-field , analogously to @xcite we recover the so - called andreev contribution to the effective action @xmath51\\operatorname{tr}_{\\rm i}[\\check q_{\\rm sc}\\check q]\\rangle_q , \\label{sa}\\ ] ] which accounts for all processes of andreev reflection at the sn interface .",
    "the dependence of @xmath52 on the electromagnetic potentials is contained both in @xmath24 and in the average of the @xmath25-fields . in order to evaluate this average",
    "it is necessary to parametrize the deviations of the @xmath25-matrix from the metallic saddle point @xmath53 . here",
    "we will make use of the parametrization @xcite @xmath54 where @xmath55 and @xmath56 , @xmath57 are respectively the diffuson and the cooperon fields .",
    "inserting this expansion into @xmath58 and collecting all terms up to the second order in @xmath59 one arrives at the effective action for diffusons and cooperons interacting with the electromagnetic field .",
    "higher order terms of the above expansion generate interactions between diffusons and cooperons and will be ignored further below .",
    "we also note that turning from the integration over the @xmath25-variable to that over @xmath59-variable one introduces the jacobian which  in the above parametrization  does not influence the second order terms .",
    "we will get back to this discussion in the next section .    in order to evaluate the andreev action it is sufficient to keep only the first order terms in @xmath59 under each trace which only depend on the cooperon fields . introducing the notations @xmath60 @xmath61 @xmath62 we rewrite the trace in the form @xmath63\\approx",

    "one observes that this expression depends only on the combination @xmath65 which has a clear physical meaning .",
    "one can show that the cooperon can be represented as a sum of the impurity ladder diagrams involving retarded ( @xmath66 ) and advanced ( @xmath67 ) green functions . as cooper pairs are spin - singlets , the spin structure of the corresponding cooperon relevant for the proximity induced superconductivity is either @xmath68 or @xmath69 .",
    "one can check that @xmath70(@xmath71 ) cooperon field corresponds to the @xmath72 spin configuration .",
    "it follows from eq .",
    "( [ trc ] ) that only antisymmetric combination enters into all the expressions derived in the leading order .",
    "note that the cooperon analyzed here differs from that of the cooperon encountered , e.g. , in the wl problem , as the latter is described either by @xmath73 or by @xmath74 spin configuration . in the next section we will demonstrate that  depending on its spin structure  the cooperon behavior can differ substantially already at the level of the first order perturbation theory in the electron - electron interactions .",
    "we proceed by expanding the action @xmath58 up to the second order in both the diffuson and the cooperon fields .",
    "then we get @xmath75 where the terms @xmath76 contain @xmath1-th power of the electromagnetic potentials and @xmath77-th power of @xmath59 .",
    "it is straightforward to verify that the term @xmath78 depends only on the diffuson fields and , hence , is irrelevant for the problem under consideration .",
    "the remaining terms read @xmath79,\\end{gathered}\\ ] ]    @xmath80\\end{gathered}\\ ] ]    and @xmath81.\\end{gathered}\\ ] ]        here we also defined @xmath82 . making use of these expressions",
    "one can proceed with the perturbation theory . defining the cooperons as @xmath83 where @xmath84",
    ", one can derive the corresponding dyson equation with the self - energy that consists of three different contributions .",
    "the first one , @xmath85 , turns out to be proportional to @xmath86 . on the diagrammatic level it originates from the diagrams with retarded and advanced lines connected only by the impurity lines .",
    "the second contribution @xmath87 is expressed as a sum of all irreducible diagrams with non - crossed retarded and advanced lines connected by interactions .",
    "finally , the the third contribution @xmath88 corresponds to diagrams with crossed retarded and advanced lines .",
    "examples of these different types of diagrams are displayed in fig .",
    "2 .    for simplicity",
    "let us consider an infinite system and take the limit @xmath89 . in this case",
    "the dyson equation for the cooperon can be written as    @xmath90    where @xmath91    @xmath92    note that while deriving these equations we employed the symmetry of the term @xmath93 .",
    "the above equations can be diagonalized by expressing them in terms of the two fields @xmath94 and @xmath95 , where a symmetric one is @xmath96 whereas an antisymmetric field was already defined in eq .",
    "( [ asymm ] ) . with thin in mind and making use of eq .",
    "( [ coop ] ) we introduce a symmetric and an antisymmetric versions of the cooperon , respectively @xmath97 and @xmath98 , which satisfy the following integral equations @xmath99 @xmath100 note that an extra minus sign in front of one of the terms in the second equation arises because each crossing of retarded and advanced lines exchanges the spins .",
    "it is straightforward to demonstrate that the symmetric version of the cooperon @xmath97 coincides with that encountered , e.g. , within the wl problem . at the same time , the antisymmetric cooperon @xmath98 responsible for the proximity effect studied here turns out to be different .",
    "hence , in general the results derived for the wl problem @xcite do not yet allow one to draw any definite conclusion about dephasing of cooper pairs by electron - electron interactions . a striking difference between @xmath97 and @xmath98",
    "is observed already in the first order perturbation theory in the interactions . while the first order diagrams for the cooperon @xmath97 ( see fig .",
    "3 ) cancel each other exactly in the limit @xmath11 , @xmath101 and @xmath102 , the same diagrams for the cooperon @xmath98 do not cancel at all in this limit .     and @xmath98 . ]",
    "the above observation implies that  unlike in the wl problem  non - vanishing zero temperature dephasing of cooper pairs occurs already in the first order in the electron - electron interactions . if one is tempted to estimate the magnitude of the dephasing effect encountered within the first order perturbation theory , one could  assuming purely exponential decay of correlations  simply exponentiate the first order result and arrive at the the equation @xmath103 which defines the perturbatively evaluated zero temperature dephasing time for cooper pairs @xmath104 . in the universal limit of strong interactions",
    "this equation yields @xmath105 .",
    "note that this first order result can not be considered as a correct one simply because all higher order terms of the perturbation theory need to be taken into account . as it was repeatedly explained elsewhere",
    "@xcite , the problem in question is essentially non - perturbative and , hence , it is an imperative to sum up the perturbation theory to _ all _ orders .",
    "this goal is accomplished within the semiclassical analysis in the next section .",
    "the non - perturbative semiclassical approach in the keldysh technique amounts to expanding the exact effective action in the so - called quantum components of the fluctuating fields defined as a difference between the fields on forward and backward parts of keldysh contour .",
    "this approximation is effectively equivalent to dropping coulomb blockade effects which are negligible in the limit of large conductances of a normal wire @xmath106 except at exponentially low voltages and temperatures .",
    "e.g. one can show @xcite that in this limit the terms @xmath107 give negligible contribution to andreev conductance as compared to that of the terms @xmath108 .",
    "thus , in the main approximation one can simply drop the fields @xmath109 , @xmath110 , and @xmath111 and represent the cooperons ( before averaging over fluctuating electromagnetic fields ) @xmath112 as a solution of the diffusion - like equation    @xmath113    resolving eq .",
    "( [ coop2 ] ) in presence of an external weak magnetic field @xmath19 , for the antisymmetric cooperon we obtain @xmath114    where @xmath115 is the well known expression for the electron decoherence time due to an external magnetic field .",
    "note that within this approximartion the symmetric cooperon @xmath97 turns out to be identical to @xmath98 .",
    "the difference between these two objects ( encountered , e.g. within the perturbation theory ) shows up only in the subleading terms containing at least one of the quantum fields , e.g. , the @xmath109-field .",
    "the above representation of the cooperon in terms of a path integral over diffusive electron trajectories proves to be very useful , as it enables one to easily perform the gaussian average over the fluctuating electromagnetic field .",
    "let us now employ the above formalism and evaluate the current @xmath116 flowing across the insulating barrier between the superconductor and the normal metal .",
    "it reads @xmath117 assuming that our system is biased by an external voltage @xmath118 and neglecting all terms containing @xmath109 and @xmath110 , we find @xmath119 where    @xmath120    performing a straightforward gaussian average over the @xmath121-fields , after additional averaging over diffusive trajectories in the case of quasi-1d @xmath122-metal wires ( see fig .",
    "1 ) for the differential andreev conductance @xmath123 we obtain @xmath124 with @xmath125 , where @xmath126 is the second jacobi theta - function and @xmath127 is the thouless time . in the limit",
    "@xmath89 the above expression for @xmath0 reduces to one derived in our previous work @xcite .",
    "the function @xmath128 describes dephasing of cooper pairs . in the interesting for us",
    "low temperature limit @xmath129 this function reduces to @xmath130 where @xmath131 and @xmath132 is an effective junction capacitance .",
    "the first term in eq . ( [ flim ] ) is due to spatially uniform fluctuations of the scalar potential @xcite .",
    "the remaining terms in this equation originate from non - uniform in space fluctuations in the normal metal wire and determine the cooper pair decoherence time @xmath133 as well as the cooper pair decoherence length @xmath134 , where @xmath135 sets a short time cutoff @xcite and also @xmath136 .",
    "it is important to observe that  that up to an unimportant prefactor of order one  this dephasing time @xmath137 coincides with that for single electrons evaluated , e.g. , for the wl problem @xcite .",
    "turning to concrete results it is worthwhile to first recall the expressions for the andreev conductance derived in the absence of the magnetic field @xcite . in that case",
    "an important physical ingredient of the problem is a competition between the two fundamental length scales , the temperature length @xmath138 and the decoherence length @xmath10 .",
    "the smallest of these two scales limits the proximity effect and influences both the linear conductance the zba peak .",
    "e.g. in the limit @xmath139 and @xmath140 one finds @xcite @xmath141     as a function of external voltage @xmath118 and the magnetic field ( in units of @xmath142 ) for @xmath143 nm , @xmath144 @xmath145/s . for these parameter values",
    "one finds @xmath146 k and @xmath147 @xmath148 m . ]    turning on the magnetic field @xmath19 , from eq .",
    "( [ finres ] ) we observe that its effect is twofold .",
    "firstly , the magnetic field causes additional dephasing of cooper pairs .",
    "this effect can be accounted for in eq .",
    "( [ b0 ] ) by the substitution @xmath149 secondly , zeeman splitting between states with opposite spins also influences the subgap conductance . from eq .",
    "( [ finres ] ) we obtain @xmath150 this result implies that in the presence of the magnetic field the zba peak gets additionally smeared due to zeeman splitting . the behavior of the nonlinear conductance @xmath151 in the presence of an external magnetic field and for @xmath152 is displayed in fig .",
    "the dependence of the linear subgap conductance on the magnetic field is illustrated in fig .",
    "our results are qualitatively consistent with experimental findings @xcite which demonstrate an effective suppression of the low temperature magnetoconductance of sn structures with increasing magnetic field @xmath19 . in this experiment",
    "the electron decoherence length @xmath10 was extracted from independent weak localization measurements and was found to be temperature independent in the regime @xmath153 .",
    "the data @xcite also confirm that at low enough @xmath154 the subgap conductance of sn structures is determined by phase coherent electron paths with lengths restricted by the temperature independent value @xmath10 rather than by the thermal length @xmath9 diverging in the low temperature limit .    in summary",
    ", we have demonstrated that even at @xmath11 electron - electron interactions yield effective dephasing of cooper pairs penetrating from a superconductor into a diffusive normal metal . at low temperatures",
    "this phenomenon fundamentally affects the proximity effect in sn hybrids restricting the penetration length of superconducting correlations into a normal metal to a @xmath154-independent value @xmath10 . in the presence of an external magnetic field the subgap conductance of sn structures",
    "gets reduced due to a combination of two effects  additional temperature independent dephasing and zeeman splitting between the states with opposite spins .",
