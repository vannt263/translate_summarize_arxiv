    "the original approach in proving the index theorem in the work of atiyah and singer @xcite is based on the following clever strategy .",
    "the invariance of the index under homotopy implies that the index ( say , the _ analytic index _ ) of an elliptic operator is stable under rather dramatic , but continuous , changes in its principal symbol while maintaining ellipticity .",

    "using @xmath16-theory , a topological invariant ( say , the _ topological index _ ) with the same transformation properties under these global operation is built from the symbol of the elliptic operator .",
    "it turns out that the global operations are sufficient to construct enough vector bundles and elliptic operators to deduce the atiyah ",
    "singer index theorem ( i.e. , _ analytic index = topological index_)_. _ with the aid of bott periodicity , it suffices to check that the two indices are the same in the trivial case where the base manifold is just a single point .",
    "a particularly nice exposition of this approach is found in e. guentner s article @xcite following an argument of p. baum .    not long after this first proof ( given in quite different variants ) , there emerged a fundamentally different means of proving the atiyah  singer index theorem , namely the _ heat kernel method_. this",

    "this depends on the background and tastes of the beholder .",
    "geometers and analysts ( as opposed to topologists ) are likely to find the heat kernel method _ _  _ _ appealing , because k - theory , bott periodicity and cobordism theory are avoided , not only for geometric operators which are expressible in terms of twisted dirac operators , but also largely for more general elliptic pseudo - differential operators , as melrose has done in @xcite .",
    "moreover , the heat method gives the index of a `` geometric '' elliptic differential operator naturally as the integral of a characteristic form ( a polynomial of curvature forms ) which is expressed solely in terms of the geometry of the operator itself ( e.g. , curvatures of metric tensors and connections ) .",
    "one does not destroy the geometry of the operator by taking advantage of the fact that it can be suitably deformed without altering the index .",
    "rather , in the heat kernel approach , the invariance of the index under changes in the geometry of the operator is a consequence of the index formula itself rather than a means of proof .",
    "however , considerable analysis and effort are needed to obtain the heat kernel for @xmath764 and to establish its asymptotic expansion as @xmath765 . also , it can be argued that in some respects the k - theoretical embedding / cobordism methods are more forceful and direct .",
    "moreover , in @xcite , we are cautioned that the index theorem for families ( in its strong form ) generally involves torsion elements in k - theory that are not detectable by cohomological means , and hence are not computable in terms of local densities produced by heat asymptotics .",
    "nevertheless , when this difficulty does not arise , the k - theoretical expression for the topological index may be less appealing than the integral of a characteristic form , particularly for those who already understand and appreciate the geometrical formulation of characteristic classes .",
    "all disputes aside , the student who learns _ both _ approaches and formulations will be more accomplished ( and probably older ) .",
    "the classical geometric operators such as the hirzebruch signature operator , the de rham operator , the dolbeaut operator and even the yang - mills operator can all be locally expressed in terms of chiral halves of twisted dirac operators .",
    "thus , we will focus on index theory for such operators .",

    "this @xmath64-form ( or `` index density '' ) is expressed in terms of forms for characteristic classes which are polynomials in curvature forms .",

    "it follows at once that @xmath1605 ( and @xmath1606 ) admit a meromorphic extension to the whole complex plane .",
    "however , it is not clear at all how to characterize the operators for which the eta function ( and the zeta function ) have a finite value at @xmath276 , the _ eta invariant _ ( resp .",
    "the _ zeta invariant _ ) .    historically , the eta invariant appeared for the first time in the 1970s as an error term showing up in the index formula for the aps spectral boundary value problem of a dirac operator @xmath2 on a compact manifold @xmath17 with smooth boundary @xmath408 ( see our subsection [ ss : apsindexthm ] ) .",
    "more precisely , what arose was the eta invariant of the tangential operator ( i.e. , the induced dirac operator over the closed manifold @xmath408 ) .",
    "even in that case it was hard to establish the existence and finiteness of the eta invariant .",
    "strictly speaking , one can define the eta invariant as the constant term in the laurent expansion of the eta function around the point @xmath276 . for various applications",
    "this suffices .",
    "many practical calculations , however , are much facilitated when we know the regularity _ a priori_.    basically , there are three different approaches to establish it : the original proof by atiyah , patodi , and singer , worked out in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* corollary 22.9 ) and summarized in our subsection [ ss : apsindexthm ] ; it is based on an assumption about the existence of a suitable asymptotic expansion for the corresponding heat kernel on the infinite cylinder @xmath1607 .",
    "an intrinsic proof can be found in gilkey ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 3.8 ) .",
    "it does not exploit that @xmath408 bounds @xmath17 , but requires strong topological means .    for a compatible ( ! ) dirac operator over a closed manifold bismut and freed @xcite",
    "have shown that the eta function is actually a holomorphic function of @xmath177 for @xmath1608 .",
    "they used the heat kernel representation which implies that the eta invariant , when it exists , can be expressed as @xmath1609 it follows from that the estimate @xmath1610 implies the regularity of the eta function at @xmath276 .",
    "in fact , bismut and freed proved a sharper result , using nontrivial results from stochastic analysis . inspired by calculations presented in bismut and cheeger ( * ?",
    "* section 3 ) , wojciechowski gave a purely analytic reformulation of the details of their proof .",
    "this provides a third and completely elementary way of proving the regularity of the eta function at @xmath276 .",
    "the essential steps are :    [ t : bismut_freed ] let @xmath1611 denote a compatible dirac operator over a closed manifold @xmath408 of odd dimension @xmath506 .",
    "let @xmath1612 denote the integral kernel of the heat operator @xmath764 .",
    "then there exists a positive constant @xmath75 such that @xmath1613 for all @xmath1614 and @xmath1615 .",
    "we recall the definition of the ` local ' @xmath1616 function .",
    "let @xmath1617 be a discrete spectral resolution of @xmath2 .",
    "then we define @xmath1618    under the assumptions of the preceding theorem the ` local ' @xmath1616 function @xmath1619 is holomorphic in the half plane @xmath1620 for any @xmath1614 .    in the decade or so following 1975",
    ", it was generally believed that the existence of a finite eta invariant was a very special feature of operators of dirac type on closed manifolds which are boundaries , and then , more generally , of dirac type operators on all closed manifolds . only after the seminal paper by douglas and wojciechowski @xcite",
    "was it gradually realized that globally elliptic self - adjoint boundary value problems for operators of dirac type also have a finite eta invariant .",
    "once again , there are quite different approaches to obtain that result .",
    "the work by wojciechowski and collaborators is based on the duhamel principle and provides complete asymptotic expansions of the heat kernels for the self - adjoint fredholm extension @xmath1553 where @xmath700 belongs to the smooth self - adjoint grassmannian .",
    "we recall from our review of the atiyah ",
    "singer index theorem that the duhamel principle allows one to study the interior contribution and the boundary contribution separately and identify the singularities caused by the boundary contribution .",
    "it seems that wojciechowski s method is only applicable if the metric structures close to the boundary are product .",
    "based on joint work with seeley , grubb @xcite also obtained nice asymptotic expansions of the trace of the heat kernels in and .",
    "contrary to the qualitative arguments of the duhamel ",
    "wojciechowski approach , grubb s approach requires the explicit computation of certain coefficients in the expansion . some of them have to vanish to guarantee the desired regularity .    for a slightly larger class of self - adjoint fredholm extensions , brning and",
    "lesch @xcite also studied the eta invariant .",
    "however , the authors had to deal with the residue of the eta function at @xmath276 which is not present in the duhamel ",
    "wojciechowski approach .    in spite of the differences between the various approaches and types of results",
    "it seems that one consequence can be drawn immediately , namely there must be a deeper meaning of the eta invariant beyond its role as error term in the aps index formula .",
    "happily , such a meaning was found by singer in @xcite for the eta invariant on closed manifolds and successively generalized by wojciechowski and collaborators for manifolds with boundary , namely the identification of the eta invariant as the phase of the zeta function regularized determinant .",
    "we shall explain this now , and postpone our main topic , the pasting formulas for the eta invariant on partitioned manifolds .",
    "several important quantities in quantum mechanics and quantum field theory are expressed in terms of _ quadratic functionals _ and _ functional integrals_. the concept of the determinant for dirac operators arises naturally when one wants to evaluate the corresponding path integrals . as itzykson and zuber report in the chapter on _ functional methods _ of their monograph @xcite : `` the path integral formalism of feynman and kac provides a unified view of quantum mechanics , field theory , and statistical models .",
    "the original suggestion of an alternative presentation of quantum mechanical amplitudes in terms of path integrals stems from the work of dirac ( 1933 ) and was brilliantly elaborated by feynman in the 1940s .",
    "this work was first regarded with some suspicion due to the difficult mathematics required to give it a decent status . in the 1970s",
    "it has , however , proved to be the most flexible tool in suggesting new developments in field theory and therefore deserves a thorough presentation . ''",
    "we shall restrict our discussion to the easiest variant of that complex matter by focusing on the partition function of a quadratic functional given by the euclidean action of a _ dirac operator _ which is assumed to be elliptic with imaginary time due to wick rotation and coupled to continuously varying vector potentials ( sources , fields , connections ) , for the ease of presentation in vacuum .",
    "we refer to bertlmann , @xcite and schwarz , @xcite for an introduction to the quantum theoretic language for mathematicians and for a more extensive treatment of general aspects of quadratic functionals and functional integrals involving the relations to the lagrangian and hamiltonian formalism .",
    "there are various alternative notions of `` path integral '' around , some more sophisticated than others . a mathematically rigorous formulation of the concept of `` path integrals '' , as physicists typically `` understand '' it in quantum field theory is flimsy at best . for fields on minkowski space , they are not mathematical integrals at all , because no measure is defined . for fields on euclidean space ( with imaginary time ) , one can construct genuine measures in limited settings which are not entirely realistic .",
    "even then there is the issue of continuing the integrals back to real time which is generally ill - defined on a curved space - time .",
    "many physicists do not care about such matters .",
    "indeed , such physicists use path integrals primarily as compact generators of recipes to produce feynman integrals which when regularized and renormalized yield coefficients in a formal power series in coupling constants for physical quantities of interest .",
    "however , no one has ever proved that these series converge , even for quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) .",
    "indeed the consensus of those who care is that these are only asymptotic series .",
    "adding first few terms of these renormalized perturbation series yields remarkable 11-decimal point agreement with experiment , and qed is thereby hailed as a huge success .",
    "for many mathematicians and a few physicists , the great tragedy is that these recipes work so well without a genuine mathematical foundation .",
    "although path integrals may not make precise sense per se , not only do they generate successful recipes in physics , but they can motivate fruitful ideas and precise concepts . in mathematics ,",
    "path integrals have motivated the @xmath1621-regularized determinant for the ( euclidean ) dirac operator , as a mathematically genuine canonical object , independent of particular choices made for regularization , which can be precisely calculated in principle .",
    "a special feature of dirac operators is that their determinants involve a _ phase _ , the imaginary part of the determinant s logarithm .",
    "as we will see now , this is a consequence of the fact that , unlike second - order semi - bounded laplacians , first - order dirac operators have an infinite number of both positive and negative eigenvalues .",
    "then the phase of the determinant reflects the spectral asymmetry of the corresponding dirac operator .",
    "the simplest path integral we meet in quantum field theory takes the form of the _ partition function _ and can be written formally as the integral @xmath1622 where @xmath1623 denotes functional integration over the space @xmath1624 of sections of a euclidean vector bundle @xmath514 over a riemannian manifold @xmath390 .    in quantum theoretic language ,",
    "@xmath390 is space or space - time ; a @xmath1625 is a position function of a particle or a spinor field .",

    "typically @xmath1631 is a dirac operator and @xmath1632 is the action @xmath1633 .",
    "mathematically speaking , the integral ( [ e : partitionf ] ) is an oscillating integral like the _ gaussian integral_. it is ill - defined in general because    * as it stands , it is meaningless when @xmath1634 ( i.e. , when @xmath1635 ) ; and , * even when @xmath1636 ( i.e. when @xmath1637 and @xmath390 consists of a finite set of points ) , the integral @xmath1638 diverges unless @xmath1639 is positive and nondegenerate .    nevertheless , these expressions have been used and construed in quantum field theory . as a matter of fact , reconsidering the physicists use and interpretation of these mathematically ill - defined quantities , one can describe certain formal manipulations which lead to normalizing and evaluating @xmath1638 in a mathematically precise way .",
    "we begin with a few calculations in _ case ii _ , inspired by adams and sen , @xcite , to show how _ spectral asymmetry _ is naturally entering into the calculations even in the finite - dimensional case and how this suggests a definition of the determinant in the infinite - dimensional case for the dirac operator .",

    "<S> we emphasize various ( occasionally overlooked ) aspects of rigorous definitions and explain the quite different stability properties . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , we utilize the heat equation approach in various settings and show how these topological and spectral invariants are mutually related in the study of additivity and nonadditivity properties on partitioned manifolds .        * introduction *    for many decades now </S>",
    "<S> , workers in differential geometry and mathematical physics have been increasingly concerned with differential operators ( exterior differentiation , connections , laplacians , dirac operators , etc . ) </S>",
    "<S> associated to underlying riemannian or space  time manifolds . </S>",
    "<S> of particular interest is the interplay between the spectral decomposition of such operators and the geometry / topology of the underlying manifold . </S>",
    "<S> this has become a large , diverse field involving index theory , the distribution of eigenvalues , zero sets of eigenfunctions , green functions , heat and wave kernels , families of elliptic operators and their determinants , canonical sections , etc .. moreover , donaldson s analysis of moduli of solutions of the nonlinear yang  </S>",
    "<S> mills equations and seiberg  </S>",
    "<S> witten theory have led to profound insights into the classification of four  manifolds , which were not accessible by techniques that are effective in higher dimensions .    </S>",
    "<S> we shall touch upon many of these topics , but we focus on three invariants characterizing the asymmetry of the spectrum of operators of dirac type : the _ index _ which gives the chiral asymmetry of the kernel or null space ( i.e. , the difference in the number of independent left and right zero modes ) of a total dirac operator ; the _ spectral flow _ of a curve of dirac operators that counts the net number of eigenvalues moving from the negative half line over to the positive ; and the _ eta invariant _ which describes the overall asymmetry of the spectrum of a dirac operator . </S>",
    "<S> the three invariants appear both for dirac operators and curves of dirac operators on a closed manifold or on a smooth compact manifold with boundary subject to suitable boundary conditions .    </S>",
    "<S> index and spectral flow can be described in general functional analytic terms , namely for bounded and unbounded , closed fredholm operators and _ curves _ of bounded and unbounded self  adjoint fredholm operators . </S>",
    "<S> correspondingly , stability properties of index and spectral flow and their topological and geometric meaning are relatively well understood . </S>",
    "<S> there is , however , not an easily identifiable operator class for eta invariant , and its behavior under perturbations is rather delicate .    </S>",
    "<S> most significant differences between the behavior of these three invariants are met when we address splitting properties on partitioned manifolds ( with product metrics assumed near the partitioning hypersurface ) . </S>",
    "<S> it is well known that the index can be described in local terms . </S>",
    "<S> this is one aspect of the atiyah </S>",
    "<S>  singer index theorem . </S>",
    "<S> so , splitting formulas for the index are relatively easily obtainable , once one specifies and understands boundary and transmission conditions for the gluing of the parts of the underlying manifold . in this process </S>",
    "<S> , precise additivity is obtained only for a few invariants , euler characteristic and signature , which actually can be characterized by cutting and pasting invariance . in general , </S>",
    "<S> an error term appears which can be expressed either by spectral flow or , equivalently , by the index of a boundary value problem on a cylinder over the separating hypersurface or , alternatively , by the index of a suitable fredholm pair .    </S>",
    "<S> surprisingly , simple splitting formulas can be obtained also for the spectral flow and eta invariant . </S>",
    "<S> this is particularly surprising for the eta invariant where we only have a local formula for the first derivative . now </S>",
    "<S> the integer error terms are expressed by the maslov index for curves of cauchy data spaces . </S>",
    "<S> these formulas relate the symmetric category of self  adjoint dirac operators over closed partitioned manifolds ( and self  adjoint boundary value problems over compact manifolds with boundary ) to the symplectic analysis of lagrangian subspaces ( the cauchy data spaces ) .    </S>",
    "<S> one message of this review is , that index , spectral flow , and eta invariant , in spite of their quite different appearance , share various features which become most visible on partitioned manifolds . roughly speaking </S>",
    "<S> , one reason for that is that the spectral flow of a path of dirac type operators ( say , on a closed manifold ) with unitarily equivalent ends @xmath0 equals the index of the induced suspension operator @xmath1 on the underlying mapping torus ( see ( * ? ? ? </S>",
    "<S> * theorems 17.3 , 17.17 , and proposition 25.1 ) ) . </S>",
    "<S> another reason is that the integer part of the derivative of the eta invariant along a path of dirac operators or boundary problems can be expressed by the spectral flow ( see , e.g. , @xcite , lewo96 , and ( * ? ? ? </S>",
    "<S> * section 3 ) ) .    </S>",
    "<S> we also summarize recent discussion on additivity and non  additivity of the zeta regularized determinant . </S>",
    "<S> it should be mentioned that the various splitting formulas all depend decisively on the well  established unique continuation property ( ucp ) for operators of dirac type . </S>",
    "<S> we give a full proof of weak ucp below in section [ weakucp ] . moreover ( modulo some technicalities for the computation of the index density form , to appear in our forthcoming book @xcite ) , </S>",
    "<S> we provide proofs of the atiyah  singer and atiyah  patodi  singer index theorems in important special cases using heat equation methods . that we explain concrete calculations only for the case of the atiyah  patodi </S>",
    "<S>  singer ( spectral  `` aps '' ) boundary condition is no big loss of generality since each admissible boundary condition for an operator of dirac type @xmath2 with tangential part @xmath3 can be written as the aps projection of a perturbed operator @xmath4 ( see below lemma [ l : grubb ] , following a recent result , gerd grubb @xcite ) .    </S>",
