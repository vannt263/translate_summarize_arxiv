    "hidden sectors are an essential ingredient of simple and natural models of supersymmetry ( susy ) breaking .",
    "the unifying idea is that susy is assumed to be broken in the hidden sector and then communicated to the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) by messenger interactions which are flavor blind .",
    "this structure results in flavor - universal scalar masses and solves the susy flavor problem .    in the context of extra dimensions with branes",
    "such hidden sectors are very natural .",
    "if  for example  the mssm and the susy breaking sector are confined to two different parallel 3-branes embedded in extra dimensions , then the separation in the extra dimensions forbids direct local couplings between the `` visible '' mssm fields and the hidden sector .",
    "however , fields on separated branes can still communicate by exchanging bulk messenger fields .",
    "couplings which arise from such non - local bulk mode exchange are suppressed . for a messenger of mass @xmath1 and brane separation",
    "@xmath2 the suppression factor is @xmath3 , which is the yukawa propagator of the messenger field exchanged between the two branes .",
    "this suggest a very simple scenario for communicating susy breaking to the mssm which guarantees flavor - universal scalar masses .",
    "if all light bulk fields have flavor blind couplings then the soft susy breaking parameters generated by exchange of these messengers preserve flavor .",
    "heavy bulk modes may violate flavor maximally but the resulting non - universal contributions to the scalar masses are exponentially suppressed @xcite .",
    "the two obvious candidates for bulk fields which can communicate susy breaking to the standard model fields in a flavor - blind way are gravity and the standard model gauge fields .",
    "gravity as a bulk messenger ( `` anomaly mediation '' @xcite ) leads to a very simple and predictive model which unfortunately predicts negative slepton masses and is therefore ruled out in its simplest and most elegant form . the alternative , standard model gauge fields as messengers ( `` gaugino mediation '' ) , has been proposed recently by d.e .",
    "kaplan , kribs , and schmaltz @xcite as well as by chacko , luty , nelson , and ponton @xcite and was found to work perfectly . in gaugino mediation the mssm matter fields ( quarks , leptons and superpartners ) live on a `` matter brane '' , while susy breaks on a parallel `` susy breaking brane '' , and the mssm gauge superfields live in the bulk .",
    "because the gaugino fields are bulk fields they couple directly to the susy breaking and obtain soft masses .",
    "the mssm scalars are separated from susy breaking by the distance @xmath2 and therefore obtain much smaller masses from non - local loops with high momentum modes of the bulk gauge fields @xcite .",
    "thus at the compactification scale the theory matches onto a four - dimensional theory with gaugino masses and negligibly small scalar masses .",
    "vanishing scalar masses and non - vanishing gaugino masses at a high scale , as in no - scale models @xcite , is very attractive because evolving the theory to low energies via the renormalization group equation generates flavor - universal and positive soft scalar masses .",
    "consistent electroweak symmetry breaking also requires a @xmath0 term of size comparable to the gaugino masses .",
    "thus a minimal version of gaugino mediation has only three high energy parameters , m_1/2 , m_c  .",
    "[ parameters ] here @xmath4 is the common gaugino mass at the unification scale , and @xmath5 is the compactification scale where the higher dimensional theory is matched onto the effective four - dimensional theory . since we wish to preserve the successful prediction of @xmath6 from gauge coupling unification in the mssm we limit @xmath7 .    in section [ pheno ] of this paper we show that this scenario , which we call `` minimal gaugino mediation '' ( ) , with only the parameters in eq .",

    "the minimal scenario which we advocate here differs from the more general models in @xcite in that we do not introduce soft supersymmetry breaking mass parameters in the higgs sector of the theory at @xmath5 .",

    "for example , the mass which is generated for the right - handed sleptons from running below the gut scale is very small because they only couple to hypercharge .",
    "above the gut scale , sleptons are unified into larger gut representations and the associated larger multiplicity factors more then compensate for the smaller log .",

    "the only remaining model dependence is in the gauge interactions above the gut scale .",
    "the predictions depend on the choice of unified gauge group , and we present predictions for both @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "furthermore , there is also a weak dependence on the running of the unified gauge coupling above the gut scale .",
    "we perform our renormalization group analysis assuming a minimal set of gut representations ( @xmath20 for the case of @xmath18 and @xmath21 for @xmath19 ) .",

    "solves the supersymmetric cp problem : this is easy to understand by realizing that at the compactification scale ( where @xmath97 ) the phases in @xmath4 and @xmath0 can be removed by phase redefinitions of the gaugino fields and the higgs superfields , respectively .",
    "therefore , the theory has no new phases beyond the phases in the yukawa couplings and no supersymmetric cp violation .",
    "this does not solve the strong cp problem however .",
    "is very predictive and therefore testable : the model has only two free parameters which implies that there are many relations between the masses of the superpartners and higgses which can be tested experimentally",
    ".    has a great cold dark matter candidate : the lsp of  is almost a pure bino for most of the parameter space .",
    "this makes the calculation of the relic neutralino ( bino ) density relatively easy , because in this scenario neutralino annihilations are dominated by the t - channel exchange of the right - handed sleptons .",
    "if one ignores the small ( but interesting ) region of parameter space where the stau and neutralino are degenerate to within 5@xmath42 ( and where co - annihilations are important  @xcite ) the relic neutralino abundance is given by @xcite _",
    "[ abundance ] this formula is accurate to about 20@xmath42 over the whole parameter space plotted in figure [ fig : exclusion ] except for where neutralinos and staus are almost degenerate ( a narrow band surrounding the `` stau lsp '' excluded regions ) . for  eq .",
    "( [ abundance ] ) yields abundances which generically are cosmologically safe and often lie within the cosmologically interesting regime @xmath98 as is evident from figure [ fig : exclusion ] .",
    "is theoretically well motivated : separation of susy breaking and the mssm matter fields onto two different branes naturally gives rise to the gaugino mediation boundary condition .",
    "if the higgs fields also live on the mssm matter brane then all supersymmetry breaking soft higgs mass parameters vanish , giving .",
    "the model is very economical and unifies .",
    "we believe that the model is sufficiently `` conservative '' , successful in solving all the problems of supersymmetry , and elegant that it has a real chance of describing nature .",
