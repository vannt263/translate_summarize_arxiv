    "@xcite the robustness of the topological surface states makes this avenue an attractive alternative to traditional methods for realizing quantum computation .",
    "@xcite    a topological superconductor must have a full superconducting gap in the bulk with odd parity pairing , and the fermi surface must enclose an odd number of time reversal invariant momenta in the brillouin zone , i.e. the fermi surface must contain an odd number of high symmetry points such as @xmath3 , z , x , etc .",

    "@xcite there are some reports of surface andreev bound states through the observation of zero bias conductance peak ( zbcp )  @xcite , but other reports that the zbcp can be removed with gating .",
    "@xcite recent works using scanning tunneling spectroscopy also did not observed the zbcp .",

    "@xcite the continual interest in cu@xmath0bi@xmath1se@xmath2 and surmounting controversy of its exotic phase motivates this study for a more complete look at quantum oscillations in magnetization .",
    "this work is a continuation and expansion on our previous study of the de haas - van alphen effect in cu@xmath4bi@xmath1se@xmath2  @xcite and now includes several samples at a variety of doping levels and complete angular dependence .    from mapping out the fermi surface ,",

    "single crystals of cu@xmath0bi@xmath1se@xmath2 were grown by melting stoichiometric mixtures of high purity elements bi ( 99.999% ) , cu ( 99.99% ) , and se ( 99.999% ) in a sealed evacuated quartz tube then slowly cooling the mixture from 850@xmath5c down to 620@xmath5c at which point the crystal was quenched in cold water .",
    "the doping level was determined according to the mole ratio of the reactants used in the crystal growth , but the nominal doping did not end up corresponding with the measured carrier concentration leaving the precise number under suspicion .",
    "therefore , in this study , we look at how parameters evolve with increased carrier concentration rather than the unreliable nominal doping .",

    "oscillations in magnetization , the de haas - van alphen effect ( dhva effect ) , arise from the quantization of the fermi surface into landau levels .    to measure quantum oscillations in magnetization , @xmath7 , we employed a highly sensitive torque magnetometry method .",

    "we further measured the temperature dependence of the oscillation amplitude at two different angles up to 25 k. a detailed analysis of the temperature and angular dependence of the quantum oscillations revealed the following features : 1 ) resolved quantum oscillations up to 90@xmath5 at low carrier concentration shows a closed ellipsoidal fermi surface , 2 ) the fermi surface gets progressively elongated in the z - direction as carrier concentration increases and becomes open at high carrier density , 3 ) there is a strong effective mass anisotropy , and 4 ) the fermi velocity is unchanged with increased carrier concentration supporting previous reports of a linear , dirac - like dispersion in cu@xmath0bi@xmath1se@xmath2 .",

    "most of the samples are fit well by a closed , ellipsoidal fermi surface ; however , for the highest carrier concentration sample , a closed fermi surface fitting yields @xmath25 = 4.69 nm@xmath26 , which is longer than the brillouin zone height  @xcite of  3.28 nm@xmath26 .",
    "thus , it is clear that the fermi surface becomes open at high carrier concentration - which was not seen in previous dhva studies where there was only one sample of lower doping .",
    "@xcite    the angular dependence of the quantum oscillation frequency provides the size of the fermi pocket . from the onsager relation ,",
    "the frequency of the quantum oscillation is proportional to the cross - section area given by @xmath27@xmath28@xmath29 , with @xmath30 and @xmath31 two semi - axes of the elliptical fermi surface . thus @xmath23 yields @xmath28 = @xmath32 and the eccentricity gives @xmath25 . for sample 4a ,",

    "the sample with the lowest carrier concentration shows a superconducting transition with a 16% superconducting volume as seen in fig .",
    "[ figsupercon ] .",
    "two of the higher carrier concentration samples showed no superconducting transition suggesting either that the sample quality deteriorates with time and exposure or the superconducting phase is killed in the over - doped regime .    at high carrier concentration ,",
    "the fermi surface becomes quasi - cylindrical and contains both the @xmath3 and z points .",
    "this indicates that a topological superconducting state does not exist at high carrier concentration since the fermi surface must enclose an odd number of time reversal invariant momenta in the brillouin zone for a topological superconductor .",
    "however , since superconductivity coexists with the closed fermi surface ( which can only contain the @xmath3 point ) in the low carrier density sample , a topological superconducting state can still exist in the lower carrier density samples of cu@xmath0bi@xmath1se@xmath2 .",

    "the sample from the previous dhva study had a dingle temperature of 23.5 k much like the other samples and it also exhibited superconductivity .",
    "@xcite therefore , it is not the case that superconductivity only occurs in the extreme case of highly disordered samples , rather we suggest that sample 4 had undergone the least amount of degradation and just happened to be the sample with the highest disorder .",
    "quantum oscillations in magnetization were resolved using highly sensitive torque magnetometry up to 31 t. a single fermi pocket was observed to be increasingly elongated with added carriers .",
    "the effective mass has strong anisotropy , and the fermi velocity remains unchanged with increasing fermi momentum suggesting a linear , dirac - like dispersion .",
    "the nature of the transition of the fermi surface topology is an interesting question . at higher concentration",
    ", the elongated 3d ellipsoidal fermi surface touches the fermi surface in the neighboring brillouin zone , mandating the transition from the 3d fermi surface to a 2d quasi - cylindrical one .",
    "such an dramatic change of the fermi surface topology suggests a lifshitz transition as the cu brings it extra carriers .",
    "two experimental consequences are essential to confirm the dimensionality change and probe the nature of the transition . first , at higher @xmath34",
    ", the quasi-2d fermi surface shall have two quantum oscillation frequencies , a large one from the belly , and a small one from the neck .",
    "the large frequency is what we observed in our dhva measurement ,  @xcite and confirmed by the sdh measurements .",
    "@xcite in contrast , the small neck frequency was not observed either in our dhva measurements , nor in the sdh results .",
    "@xcite this point is in particular puzzling , though ref .",
    "@xcite reports that the signal arising from the small neck may be too small do to large effective mass effects .",
    "therefore , the quantum oscillation measurements at dilution refrigerator temperature range is called to resolve the second oscillation frequency to confirm the 2d to 3d transition",
    ".    another interesting experiment would be to the enhancement of thermopower near the 3d to 2d transition .",
    "a topology change in the electronic state usually leads to a large thermopower , a typical signature of lifshitz transition .  @xcite",
