    "<S> we have measured the center - of - mass structure factor @xmath0 of liquid para - hydrogen by neutron diffraction , using the d4c diffractometer at the institute laue langevin , grenoble , france . </S>",
    "<S> the present determination is at variance with previous results obtained from inelastic neutron scattering data , but agrees with path integral monte carlo simulations .    among the simple liquids , the microscopic structure factor , @xmath0 , of liquid hydrogen has been one of the most jealously kept secrets of nature </S>",
    "<S> this is a consequence of several experimental problems . due to the small number of electrons , </S>",
    "<S> an x - ray determination of the hydrogen structure factor is not an easy task . on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> a neutron diffraction experiment is particularly difficult because of the relevance of inelastic scattering events : their size , mainly determined by the ratio between the neutron and the nuclear mass @xcite , makes the standard correction techniques unsuitable to hydrogen . due to the doubled nuclear mass , the experiment analysis is less demanding for deuterium . </S>",
    "<S> nonetheless , the first reliable neutron diffraction measurement of the microscopic structure of liquid deuterium is relatively recent and was carried out using a small - angle , time - of - flight , diffractometer ( sandals , at isis , uk ) that was specifically built for light mass liquids . using this instrument , the structure factor of liquid @xmath1 was measured in the vicinity of the triple point @xcite and close to the freezing transition @xcite . by combining the data of ref .   with those measured in a further diffraction experiment , performed on a reactor source ( 7c2 diffractometer at laboratoire lon brillouin , saclay , france ) @xcite , </S>",
    "<S> an improved determination of the structure factor of liquid deuterium was obtained . </S>",
    "<S> this turned out to be in excellent agreement with path integral monte carlo ( pimc ) simulation results @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the knowledge of @xmath0 for deuterium is not easily transferred to hydrogen , due to the different role played by quantum effects @xcite . on the other hand , for the case of hydrogen </S>",
    "<S> , the overwhelming ratio between the incoherent and coherent neutron scattering cross section of the proton makes it extremely difficult to extract the intermolecular response , which carries the structural information , from the large intramolecular contribution . the first successful attempt to obtain structural information on liquid hydrogen , carried out on sandals , allowed us to determine the thermodynamic derivatives of @xmath0 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these were found in a rather good quantitative agreement with the pimc simulation results @xcite .    due to the well recognized experimental difficulties , alternative methods have been suggested to determine @xmath0 for liquid hydrogen . </S>",
    "<S> bermejo and co - workers @xcite have reported a determination of the structure factor of liquid para - hydrogen using the results of an inelastic neutron scattering experiment and the sum rule which relates the dynamic structure factor , @xmath2 , to the static one , @xmath0 , @xcite :    @xmath3    the results were qualitatively reasonable , but not fully convincing on a quantitative basis @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , the main peak of @xmath0 appeared rather high , exceeding the value of 2.85 which marks , according to the hansen  </S>",
    "<S> verlet criterion @xcite , the onset of the freezing transition . </S>",
    "<S> even though hansen and verlet formulated this rule for simple model systems ( classical monatomic particles interacting through a lennard - jones potential ) it is hard to believe that for hydrogen , a genuine quantum system for which one expects an overall broadening and damping of the structural features , @xmath0 should reach such a large value in the liquid phase .    </S>",
    "<S> more recently , the same method , i.e. integrating the dynamic structure factor at constant @xmath4 , was applied by pratesi _ </S>",
    "<S> et al . </S>",
    "<S> _ @xcite using the x - ray inelastic scattering data obtained on the id16 beamline at the european synchroton radiation facility ( grenoble , france ) . </S>",
    "<S> their results for @xmath0 , taken at @xmath5 k and molecular number density @xmath621.5  nm@xmath7 , were not much extended in @xmath4 , barely exceeding the main peak position of the structure factor , and with rather large error bars . however , the peak height turned out considerably lower than the neutron data of ref . and consistent with their pimc simulation results . the x - ray diffraction measurement , carried out in parallel @xcite , showed much smaller error bars and still a good agreement with the pimc simulation </S>",
    "<S> however , in this case , the accessed @xmath4-range did not even reach the peak position of @xmath0 .    in this context </S>",
    "<S> , we have carried out a new experiment aiming to determine directly , for the first time by neutron diffraction , the center - of - mass structure factor of liquid para - hydrogen and the results constitute the object of the present letter . </S>",
    "<S> the measurements were carried out using the d4c diffractometer of the institut laue langevin ( grenoble , france ) in its standard configuration with an incident wavelength @xmath8  . </S>",
    "<S> of the four thermodynamic states investigated , we report here the results at @xmath9 k and @xmath10 bar ( @xmath11 nm@xmath7 @xcite ) . the liquid hydrogen sample was condensed directly in a vanadium cylindrical container ( 6 mm internal diameter , 0.2 mm wall thickness ) imbedded in the low pressure buffer gas of an _ orange _ cryostat . at the bottom of the vanadium container , out of the neutron beam </S>",
    "<S> , we had inserted some powder of a paramagnetic catalyst made of cr@xmath12o@xmath13 on an al@xmath12o@xmath13 substrate , in order to speed up the conversion from ortho- to para - hydrogen . </S>",
    "<S> the relative concentration of the two species was monitored looking at the low momentum transfer portion of the diffraction pattern @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> twenty - four hours of conversion time were allowed to stabilize the sample . </S>",
    "<S> then , the stability of the low-@xmath4 portion of the diffraction pattern confirmed that the sample had reached the thermodynamic equilibrium concentration , calculated to be 99.96% rich in para - hydrogen . in order to check the overall stability of the experimental setup , as well as of the sample , for each thermodynamic point we took several measurements in repeated runs .    in order to properly subtract the background contribution from the raw data , </S>",
    "<S> we have carried out an additional measurement , without changing the experimental setup and filling the sample container with a small amount of gaseous @xmath14he . </S>",
    "<S> the density of the gas was chosen such as to match the scattering power of the liquid para - hydrogen sample with the absorption power of @xmath14he . </S>",
    "<S> the details of the procedure can be found in ref .  . </S>",
    "<S> we used the value @xmath15 barn , obtained from ref .  </S>",
    "<S> , for the molecular hydrogen scattering cross section at the incident neutron wavelength . in fig .  1 </S>",
    "<S> , we show the diffraction pattern of liquid para - hydrogen after subtraction of background and container scattering , properly corrected for attenuation </S>",
    "<S> . the diffraction spectrum is dominated by the _ self _ molecular part , which is produced by the intramolecular structure . </S>",
    "<S> the _ distinct _ coherent contribution , containing the required information on the intermolecular structure factor , appears as a tiny undulation superimposed on the much larger intramolecular structure in the region @xmath16 @xmath17 . </S>",
    "<S> the difference between the experimental and calculated patterns ( see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 1 ) is mainly due to multiple scattering effects .    the data treatment needed to extract the structure factor requires the calculation of the self part of the molecular double differential neutron cross section of para - hydrogen . </S>",
    "<S> this can be done using the young and koppel ( yk ) theory @xcite . here , </S>",
    "<S> the intermolecular interactions are totally neglected and the hydrogen molecules are modeled as a set of non - interacting particles possessing their relevant internal degrees of freedom . thus , each molecule is considered separately and the intramolecular roto - vibrational modes , and spin correlations , are explicitly taken into account . </S>",
    "<S> the vibrational modes are considered harmonic and the rotations are free . </S>",
    "<S> this model applies well to our case because , at low temperatures , only the ground vibrational state is populated and , using thermal neutrons , no vibrational transition is allowed . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , as long as the system is in the liquid phase and is not subject to high pressures , the anisotropic components of the intermolecular potential are negligible @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the vibrational - rotational coupling can be accounted for , in an effective way , using the experimental values for the roto - vibrational levels . </S>",
    "<S> within the applicability limits of this model , a rigorous calculation of the double differential neutron cross section is possible .    </S>",
    "<S> it is well known @xcite that for hydrogen , due to quantum effects , the average center - of - mass kinetic energy is different from the classical value @xmath18 and depends on density @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this quantity can be directly measured from an inelastic neutron scattering experiment @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we have shown @xcite that a modified young and koppel ( myk ) model can be defined to account for this property , using an effective temperature in the width of the ideal - gas gaussian that describes the dynamic structure factor of the molecular centers of mass . by means of the myk model , </S>",
    "<S> the _ self _ portion of the double differential neutron cross section could be integrated , at each scattering angle @xmath19 , over the energies of the scattered neutrons . </S>",
    "<S> the result , properly normalized as described below , is represented by the dashed line in fig .  1 .    as far as the multiple scattering effects are concerned , we carried out a monte carlo ( mc ) simulation using , as input , the calculated myk cross section . </S>",
    "<S> we found that the multiple scattering contribution to the cross section is a rather smooth function of @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> however , since its intensity is larger than the intermolecular part ( see fig .  1 ) , the accuracy of a typical multiple scattering calculation might be insufficient for a reliable extraction of @xmath0 . on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> the similarity between the measured diffraction pattern and the calculated intramolecular cross section suggests to consider an overall , rather unstructured , generalized background , that includes the multiple scattering and should be represented by a low - order polynomial function @xmath20 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , instead of attempting a difficult evaluation of the multiple scattering , we applied a different procedure where the order and coefficients of the polynomial , as well as the overall normalization constant , were obtained from a fit . </S>",
    "<S> a model function , including @xmath20 and the calculated intramolecular diffraction pattern , was fitted to those data points measured at @xmath21values where an independent knowledge of the intermolecular structure factor is available : namely , we used @xmath22 at low @xmath4 , as is typical of a dense liquid ( with @xmath23 related to the isothermal compressibility ) , and @xmath24 for large @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath4-range that contains the experimental information on the sought - for structure factor was excluded from the fit . </S>",
    "<S> we found that a fifth order polynomial is sufficient to give a satisfactory description of the generalized background function which turned out to be in a semiquantitative agreement with the mc evaluation of the multiple scattering intensity .    </S>",
    "<S> the fitted polynomial has been subtracted , together with the calculated intramolecular contribution , from the experimental diffraction pattern . </S>",
    "<S> the result gives , after normalization , the intermolecular term in the measured cross section that can be written as :    @xmath25,\\ ] ]    where @xmath26 is the paalman and pings attenuation coefficient and @xmath27 is the molecular form factor @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it is worthwhile to note that , in the data analysis , we have taken into account self absorption as well as the finite dimensions of sample and detectors . </S>",
    "<S> the final result for @xmath0 is reported in fig .  2 . </S>",
    "<S> the error bars account for both the propagated statistical errors from the raw spectrum and an estimate of the systematic errors coming from the fitting procedure . for example , we have taken into account , among other things , the effect of the variation of the fitting intervals in the determination of the polynomial background . in the same figure , we compare the present experimental neutron diffraction results with the corresponding quantity obtained from a pimc computer simulation @xcite using the norman , watts , and buck @xcite ( nwb ) intermolecular potential . </S>",
    "<S> the simulation conditions were @xmath28 k and @xmath29 nm@xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> the agreement is not perfect but still is rather good and both the experimental and simulation data consistently show no trace of an anomalously high main peak in @xmath0 , as it might have been inferred from ref .  .    </S>",
    "<S> we compare the present results with a corresponding analysis carried out on liquid deuterium , in similar thermodynamic conditions and using the same intermolecular potential ( nwb ) . in that case , the agreement between simulation and experiment was extremely good , and data were of such a quality to allow a good discrimination among different intermolecular interaction functions , namely nwb and lennard - jones @xcite . in the present case , an overall quantitative agreement with simulation is also found , although the experiment is much more difficult . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , the resulting uncertainties are larger , and do not allow us to clearly discriminate among various choices of the intermolecular potential .    in order to be more specific </S>",
    "<S> , we examined the structural information that is obtained from the simulations , using two different potential functions . </S>",
    "<S> to this aim , we compared the present simulation data at @xmath28 k and @xmath30 nm@xmath7 , based on the nwb potential , with existing pimc data at @xmath31 k and @xmath32 nm@xmath7 @xcite , obtained using the silvera and goldman ( sg ) intermolecular potential . </S>",
    "<S> the only observed difference was a lower main peak , by @xmath33 in @xmath34 $ ] , for the simulation results based on the sg potential function . </S>",
    "<S> considering that temperature and density differ , in the two simulations , by @xmath35 and @xmath36 respectively , we can mainly attribute to the different choice of the interaction potential the found deviation of @xmath33 . </S>",
    "<S> this , in turn , is a little smaller than the present size of the error bars in the main peak region .    finally , on closer inspection of fig .  2 </S>",
    "<S> , data seem to suggest a slightly narrower main peak than in the simulation . </S>",
    "<S> we exclude that such an effect could be assigned to the particular choice of the intermolecular potential . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , by comparing the nwb and the sg simulations , no observable difference in the main - peak width could be evidenced . </S>",
    "<S> of course , we could attribute this effect to some remaining systematic experimental error that we were unable to get rid of . </S>",
    "<S> however , it is interesting to note that a similar qualitative result , concerning the width of @xmath0 , was also found in ref .   and attributed to the presence , in the real liquid , of significantly longer range correlations than those depicted by the simulation . </S>"
