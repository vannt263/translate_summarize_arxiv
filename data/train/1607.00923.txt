    "many phenomena in maritime or fluvial hydraulics involve free surface flows in shallow waters .",
    "the so - called shallow water equations were introduced by saint - venant in 1871 @xcite for studying floods and tides . since then , the model has been widely extended and is used in the modelling and numerical simulation of a number of natural or manmade phenomena such as river flow @xcite , flood forecasting @xcite , pollutant transport @xcite , dam - break @xcite , tsunami @xcite , overland flow @xcite , soil erosion @xcite .",
    "the shallow water system can be obtained from the incompressible navier - stokes equations under several hypotheses , the main one being that the characteristic wavelength is much larger than the water depth .",
    "two consequences follow then : the hydrostatic pressure law , and the viscosity vanishing in the horizontal direction .",
    "next , to proceed from navier - stokes to shallow water , we integrate the equations along the vertical direction . at this point",
    ", we have to be careful about the vertical velocity profile , which on the one hand has to be approximated to deal with nonlinearities , but on the other hand drives the bottom boundary condition , hence the friction phenomena .",
    "two classical assumptions on the velocity profile lead to explicit integrations .",
    "first , a viscous poiseuille - like ( i.e. parabolic ) profile on the whole water depth gives rise to a linear ( with respect to the mean velocity ) friction term , sometimes referred to as laminar friction .",
    "even simpler , the constant vertical profile , somehow corresponding to an ideal fluid , has the main drawback that by construction the boundary condition at bottom disappears ( non penetration for an ideal fluid ) .",
    "hence there is no friction term in the integrated equations .",
    "this corresponds to the original model proposed by saint - venant , which he obtained by completely different means .",
    "friction has to be added afterwards , using empirical laws ( manning , chzy, ... )@xcite .",
    "the main drawback of these two points of view is the non - adaptability of the viscous term due to large velocity variations , so that the assumed profiles ( parabolic or flat ) do not hold .",
    "we propose here a more flexible coupled system based on a supplementary viscous layer study .",
    "more precisely the aim of this paper is to understand how the viscous no - slip boundary condition gives rise to the friction term in the integrated system .",
    "this is done by assuming the existence of a viscous layer above the ground , with thickness quantified by a parameter @xmath2 , which is related to the inverse of the reynolds number of the fluid . here",
    "@xmath3 will be small but not necessarily vanishing as in classical boundary layer analysis . above this layer",
    "lies an ideal fluid . integrating the incompressibility equation under this assumption leads to the same conservation equation on the fluid depth . on the contrary ,",
    "the integration of the momentum equation exhibits major differences .",
    "indeed , it turns out that the order of magnitude of the friction term , which results from the parietal constraints , is precisely @xmath3 , while the above mentioned poiseuille profile leads to a @xmath4 order of magnitude ( see part [ subsec : sw ] ) .",
    "motivated by this precise quantification of the intensity of friction , we introduce a new closure for the flux momentum .",
    "it can be interpreted as an additional pressure law , with the same magnitude @xmath3 , so that both terms vanish for an ideal fluid , that is @xmath5 .    at this stage , we obtain a system of two equations which are similar in structure with the usual shallow water system , but involving several additional unknowns functions precisely related to the viscous layer .",
    "following classical methodology in aerodynamics , see e.g. @xcite , the second step consists therefore in a careful analysis of this layer , through the prandtl equation , which is integrated along the vertical axis to obtain the so - called von krmn equation .",
    "it drives the evolution of the so - called displacement thickness @xmath6 ( see figure [ fig : domain ] ) , which is involved in the definition of the corrective pressure mentioned above , and can be interpreted as some physical thickness of the viscous layer .",
    "the system has to be complemented by the velocity equation of the ideal fluid , since it is involved in the von krmn equation .",
    "together with some assumptions on the vertical velocity profile in the viscous layer , this leads to a system of four equations . in practice",
    "we will discuss the effects for flows over short bumps .",
    "the acceleration induced by the bump will change a lot the basic flow so that the shape velocity profile is no longer a half poiseuille nor a flat one .",
    "this study aims to understand this kind of flows which are not taken into account by the shallow water equations themselves .",
    "the major limit of the following theory is the necessity of the ideal fluid / viscous layer decomposition .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows . in a first section we recall the navier - stokes system , and state the long wave approximation which is convenient for shallow water approximation .",
    "next we turn to the viscous layer analysis , and derive prandtl and von krmn equations .",
    "vertical velocity profiles are also introduced .",
    "the third section is devoted to the derivation of the extended shallow water system leading to our new model ( [ finalmass])-([finalideal ] ) . in section 4",
    "we derive some formal properties of the model , together with analytical steady state solutions .",
    "finally , we evidence several properties of the model by numerical simulations , the purpose of the paper not being to develop sharp discretizations .",
    "in this section we recall how classical models for shallow waters are obtained from navier - stokes equations .",
    "the first assumption is a long wave approximation , stating that indeed we deal with a thin layer of water .",
    "next , we integrate along the vertical direction , assuming a given velocity profile on the whole water depth .",
    "we consider a fluid in a time - dependant domain @xmath7 ( see figure [ fig : domain ] ) , where the first dimension @xmath8 is horizontal and with infinite extension , the second one @xmath9 is vertical .",
    "the fluid is limited by the ground , represented by a function @xmath10 , and some free surface @xmath11 .",
    "the ground is a given function ( no erosion or ground modification ) , whereas the free surface is an unknown of the problem .",
    "the water height is @xmath12 . in this study ,",
    "the properties of the air above the free surface are completely neglected .",
    ", the bottom is a given function @xmath13 and @xmath14 is the free surface .",
    "two families of velocity profiles for the flow over the topography , first with the usual half - poiseuille description ( dashed ) ( see [ subsec : sw ] for the explanations ) , and second with the flat profile with a boundary layer ( plain ) . note the shear ( slope of the velocity at the wall ) is completely different in both descriptions.,width=415 ]    our starting point to describe the liquid layer is the dimensionless navier - stokes equations for an incompressible newtonian fluid in laminar flow @xcite : @xmath15 where    * @xmath16 is the velocity vector * @xmath17 is the reynolds number expressing the ratio between the inertia force and the viscosity * @xmath18 is the froude number , ratio between the kinetic and potential energies * @xmath19 is the pressure    nondimensionalization has been made with the same characteristic length for the abscissa and the ordinate , and corresponds for instance to the mean water depth @xmath20 , that appears in the reynolds and froude numbers .",
    "we consider in this work only laminar flows because the asymptotics from the navier - stokes equations is clearer , and moreover the resulting description is quantitative .",
    "a similar study can be made with a modified reynolds tensor and we can hope it leads at least to some qualitative description .    the system is complemented with the following boundary conditions :    * bottom : no - slip @xmath21 for @xmath10 * free surface @xmath11 * * kinematic boundary condition : @xmath22 * * continuity of the stress tensor : @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the stress tensor and @xmath25 is the normal to the free surface .      up to now , no hypothesis has been taken into account for the size order of the characteristic quantities @xmath26 .",
    "we have in mind applications to rivers or coastal flows where the following conditions may be observed :    * the horizontal velocity has small variation along the vertical ; * the reynolds number is large ; * the vertical velocity is small compared to the horizontal velocity .",
    "let us start by investigating the third one , which justifies the following scaling for the velocities : @xmath27 then the mass conservation equation ( [ mass ] ) enforces also a scaling for the space variables @xmath28 since @xmath29 hence there are two options for the variable scaling :    1 .   long wave hypothesis .",
    "we introduce the aspect ratio of the system @xmath30 .",
    "the scaling is @xmath31 this scaling is the same as a nondimensionalization of the navier - stokes equations with a characteristic length @xmath32 for the domain and a characteristic physical height @xmath20 .",
    "this scaling has to be complemented with @xmath33 .",
    "so , the long wave hypothesis needs a long time study .",
    "furthermore , since @xmath34 , we have @xmath35 and so the physical slope needs to be small enough .",
    "thin layer scaling : @xmath36 this scaling restricts the study of small vertical velocity only to a thin water depth which tends to zero when @xmath37 .",
    "it is the classical scaling used in the boundary layer approach .",
    "so , the only scaling which is compatible with a small vertical velocity compared to the horizontal velocity is the long wave scaling . let us see the consequences for the set of equations ( [ mass])-([momentum2 ] ) and the boundary conditions .",

    "propose in @xcite to consider in the long - wave approximation of both euler and navier - stokes system several layers and integrate over each layer . similarly to finite volume numerical methods , matter and momentum fluxes",
    "are taken into account at each interface between the layers .",
    "therefore they are faced with a superposition of shallow water systems each one interacting with its neighbours .",
    "this can be interpreted as a discretization in the vertical direction of the two - dimensional systems .",
    "our method is different in that the two layers have different status , based on physical motivations .",
    "the relative thickness of each part is not fixed but evolves in time .",
    "the aim of this paragraph is to recall the classical way to obtain shallow water equations by vertical integration over the whole water depth , first in the long - wave approximation of the euler equations , then in the long - wave approximation of the navier - stokes equations .",
    "averaging the euler system ( [ eqflupcl1])-([eqflupcl5 ] ) over the water depth leads to the so - called shallow water model without friction .",
    "we introduce the natural averaged velocity .",
    "[ meanvel ] the averaged velocity @xmath51 is defined by @xmath52 .    with this construction , @xmath51",
    "is defined @xmath53-a.e .",
    "( i.e. only for @xmath54 )",
    ". then straightforward computations ( see section [ sec : esw ] below for details ) lead to @xmath55 the momentum equation above requires some closure for the flux .",
    "this can be achieved by assuming a flat velocity profile over the water depth , which is compatible with the ideal fluid assumption .",
    "this leads to @xmath56 , hence the momentum equation becomes @xmath57 equations and correspond to the equations derived by de saint - venant by completely different means , with the additional topography term .",
    "if we proceed in an analogous way from the navier - stokes equations in long wave scaling , we obtain a viscous shallow water where the water depth conservation is the same as before , but the momentum equation becomes @xmath58 once again , without the presence of complementary equations , a closure is needed for the @xmath59-profile over all the water depth .",
    "explicit formul  are given in @xcite depending of the flow index of the fluid .",
    "focusing on a newtonian fluid with a negative constant slope , the balance between the friction and the driving force of the slope gives a parabolic solution for @xmath59 , the half - poiseuille or nusselt solution : @xmath60 with @xmath61 a positive constant .",
    "in the general case , even if the invariance is not conserved , a similar form is chosen for the velocity profile but the deviating is expressed with a variable amplitude instead of a constant one : @xmath62 .",
    "nevertheless , the explicit integration gives the following system : @xmath63 the friction term which naturally appears in this derivation is @xmath64 .",
    "it is indeed linear with respect to the mean velocity @xmath51 , and is usually referred to as the laminar friction term .    an alternative way to reintroduce some viscosity in the inviscid shallow water equations ( [ swcm])-([swcmo ] ) is to put a posteriori some friction term similar to the one in the poiseuille - shallow water .",
    "a general form for such a friction term is @xmath65 to be consistent with the previous equation , but a large family of empirical friction laws involves a @xmath66 depending on @xmath51 as well , for instance chzy , manning , see @xcite for a bibliographical study .",
    "we turn now to the main step towards the model we look for .",
    "it mainly consists in dividing the fluid in two layers    * an ideal fluid layer dealing with the free surface ; * a thin viscous layer with the no - slip condition at the bottom",
    ".    between these layers lies an interface which connects the velocities and will be described below . in the first layer we take advantage of the explicit integration along the vertical , in the second we take into account the viscosity in the vertical direction ,",
    "hence we recover some friction in the integrated equations .",
    "this section is devoted to the study of the viscous layer .",
    "we introduce a small parameter @xmath67 , whose magnitude will be specified below .",
    "it is related to the thickness of the viscous layer , but does not correspond to its actual physical value .",
    "we follow the classical strategy used in the so - called boundary layer theory , see e.g. @xcite,@xcite , except that in that case @xmath68 , whereas we keep a finite value here .",
    "the first step is to derive a set of equations , sometimes referred to as rnsp ( reduced navier - stokes / prandtl ) equations @xcite .",
    "since they are yet two - dimensional , the next step consists in writing another equation , by integrating the prandtl system over the viscous layer height .",
    "this leads to the so - called von krmn equation , where extra unknowns are introduced . to obtain a closed form",
    ", some assumptions have to be done on the vertical velocity profile , which are discussed in the last paragraph .",
    "starting from the navier - stokes equations with long wave scaling , we introduce the following change of variables , referred to as the prandtl shift : @xmath69 as a consequence , we have the relations @xmath70 velocities must be scaled in order to preserve the mass conservation , which rewrites here @xmath71 hence we choose @xmath72 and @xmath73 .",
    "the complete prandtl shift is therefore @xmath74 then equations , , and become @xmath75 equation together with leads to @xmath76 this leads to several possible scalings for @xmath77 in terms of @xmath46 , namely    * if @xmath67 verifies @xmath78 , we recover the ideal fluid equations ; * if @xmath67 satisfies @xmath79 , we obtain @xmath80 .",
    "this equation is explicitly solved and from the continuity of the stress tensor and the adherence on the ground we obtain @xmath81 .",
    "so we do not consider this trivial case ; * the last possibility is @xmath82 .",
    "this analysis preserves as many as possible terms in the equations , and hence most of the physical phenomena described by those terms .",
    "it is referred to as `` dominant balance '' .",
    "this is why in what follows , we consider the scaling @xmath83 with this hypothesis , we obtain the prandtl equations written in viscous layer variables :    _ xu+_y v=0&[eccl1 ] + _ t u+u _ x u + v _ y u = -_x p - + _ y^2 u & [ eccl2 ] + _ yp=-&[eccl3 ] + u = v=0 y=0 & [ eccl4 ]    the prandtl equations we obtain are in the same form as those obtained directly with a boundary layer scaling on the navier - stokes equations ( @xcite , ch .",
    "vii ) except for the topography term in .",
    "[ remgradp ] notice that implies that @xmath84 in does not depend on @xmath85 .    up to now",
    ", we do not have enough boundary conditions for the viscous layer .",
    "the natural connection consists in assuming that the velocity at the `` top '' of the viscous layer , that is for @xmath86 , coincides with the ground velocity for the ideal fluid , defined by @xmath87 , where @xmath16 is the velocity vector for the ideal fluid .",
    "more precisely , we impose the required boundary condition at infinity as @xmath88 this is meaningful since in the prandtl shift @xmath89 and @xmath90 .",
    "note that in classical boundary layer theory the limit known as `` asymptotic matching '' is used : @xmath91 .",
    "therefore we conclude this paragraph by giving the behaviour of @xmath92 , which is an easy consequence of equations and .",
    "[ eque ] the horizontal component @xmath92 satisfies the following equation : @xmath93      the von krmn equation ( see schlichting @xcite ) expresses the defect of velocity between the ideal fluid and the viscous layer . a classical way to obtain such an equation",
    "consists in writing the prandtl equation , then introducing the velocity defect @xmath94 , and finally integrating it on the viscous layer .",
    "following @xcite we introduce the following two integrated quantities .",
    "[ def : delta1 ] let @xmath51 be the averaged velocity ( definition [ meanvel ] ) .",
    "we define    * the displacement thickness @xmath6 , defined by @xmath95 * the momentum thickness @xmath96 , defined by @xmath97    the displacement thickness expresses the distance by which the ground should be displaced to obtain an ideal fluid with velocity @xmath92 with the flow rate @xmath98 . in the same way , the momentum thickness accounts for the loss of momentum in the viscous layer .",
    "a simple computation leads to the following expressions for these quantities : @xmath99 thus we can recover the classical formul  in the boudary layer scaling @xmath100 ( see @xcite ) @xmath101    [ vkcond ] the displacement and momentum thicknesses are ruled by the so - called von krmn equation : @xmath102 where @xmath103 and @xmath104 denotes the parietal constraints : @xmath105    notice that in this single equation three new unknowns are actually introduced , namely @xmath6 , @xmath96 and @xmath104 .",
    "we postpone the presentation of the closure assumptions until the next section .",
    "first we notice that together with the prandtl shift rewrites @xmath106 where we have used to rewrite the right - hand side .",
    "the difference between this equation and ( [ eccl2 ] ) gives @xmath107 through ( [ eccl1 ] ) and ( [ eccl4 ] ) , we can rearrange the term @xmath108 .",
    "furthermore with the addition and withdrawal of @xmath109 , we get @xmath110 the last term in the left - hand side is rewritten @xmath111 now we integrate over @xmath85 the resulting equation between @xmath112 and @xmath113 using the boundary condition : @xmath114 the last three terms of the left - hand side can be rewritten as @xmath115 .",
    "so , using also definition , the equation becomes : @xmath116 finally , since @xmath92 is independent of @xmath85 , we have the relations @xmath117 and since all the unknowns are independent of @xmath85 and @xmath118 , we can drop as well the bars in the derivatives . with all this , we obtain equation ( [ equedelta ] ) .      the von krmn equation together with the equation on @xmath92 give only a partial representation of the boundary layer , since they involve four unknowns , namely @xmath92 , @xmath6 , @xmath96 , and @xmath119 which represents the parietal forces . to proceed further towards an integrated model ,",
    "we need a closure for this system of equations . by definition ,",
    "the viscous layer is the layer where the velocity @xmath120 varies from @xmath112 on the floor to @xmath92 .",
    "therefore we introduce a profile function @xmath121 as well as a scaling factor @xmath122 , chosen in such a way that @xmath123 quantifies the physical thickness of the viscous layer . as a general rule",
    "we wish to have @xmath124 therefore we choose @xmath125 , and @xmath126 such that @xmath127 hence @xmath128 therefore choosing @xmath123 amounts to fixing the form factor @xmath129 defined in ( e.g. @xmath130 corresponds to @xmath131 ) .",
    "now we can readily obtain a relationship between @xmath6 and @xmath96 : @xmath132 finally , the parietal constraints can also be expressed in terms of the profile @xmath121 : @xmath133    the collection of all the preceding relations leads to put the von krmn equation ( [ equedelta ] ) on the following form : @xmath134    at this stage , several shapes can be used for the profile , including turbulent ones .",

    "we are now in position to obtain the extended model we are looking for .",
    "the first step consists in integrating the mass and momentum conservation equations , as in the usual way to derive the shallow water equations from navier - stokes , see for instance @xcite .",
    "the resulting mass equation is the same , but several differences occur for momentum .",
    "indeed , the parietal constraints arise in the right - hand side at order @xmath147 in @xmath3 , motivating a new closure for the momentum flux .",
    "the momentum equation thus depends on the unknowns @xmath6 and @xmath96 , so the system has to be coupled with the von krmn equation we derived above .",
    "we recall that the natural averaged velocity in viscous shallow water is @xmath148 . from the incompressibility equations we recover the usual balance equation on the water depth @xmath53 .",
    "the mass conservation in its integrated form is @xmath149    we integrate the conservation equation between @xmath13 and @xmath14 @xmath150 now from the no - slip boundary condition we get @xmath151 , and the kinematic one gives @xmath152 since the ground is independent of time , and we recognize ( [ consvmassint ] ) .",
    "we turn now to the momentum balance equation .",
    "the main point to notice at this stage is the appearance of the parietal constraint @xmath104 with prefactor @xmath3 .",

    "a consistent expression with the model is obtained through the velocity profile , see above .",

    "+      * bump amplitude . *",
    "not very surprisingly , the bump amplitude has a direct influence on the amplitude of variation of @xmath6 and @xmath104 . on the one hand , as it is seen in figure [ ampb ] , the smaller the amplitude , the closer @xmath6 is to the blasius solution . on the other hand",
    ", it can be observed that the solution departs from the blasius one after the bump when the amplitude increases .",
    "this phenomenon becomes important for large values of the amplitude ( see figure [ fig : boum ] ) , and might be bound with the boundary layer separation when the downstream slope of the bump becomes too high ( see for instance @xcite ) .",
    "we can not , with the chosen profiles here compute boundary layer separation .",

    "the variation of the bump amplitude brings out another property for the displacement thickness .",
    "as far the amplitude is sufficient , the displacement thickness catches up always the same curve around the bump and that , for different initial values . in all the previous examples",
    ", @xmath6 was initialized by @xmath300 .",
    "this choice of a small value for @xmath6 was intended to observe the development of the viscous layer . starting with a constant value not morally equal to zero",
    "is interpreted as an established viscous flow in entry . in the figure [ entree ]",
    ", this initial value varies with a given bump . even if the blasius behavior described by the equation [ bla / ray ] begins at different values , around the bump",
    "the four curves are gathered .",
    "so there is an independence of the solution around the bump with respect to the initial value for the displacement thickness , even if the phenomenon can not be observed for every entrance and is limited by the bump amplitude choice .",
    "* bump width .",
    "* the bump width is quantified by the standard deviation @xmath301 in the gaussian profile . increasing the width of the bump increases as well the extent of the response of both @xmath6 and @xmath104 , see figures [ width ] and [ widthtau ] .",
    "the amplitude is also slightly decreased .",
    "but the most interesting phenomenon is that the local maximum of the friction moves upstream from the top of the bump",
    ". nevertheless , since the response of the displacement thickness spreads with the bump width , a too much broad bump leads only to an inflection point .",
    "rescaling functions in figures [ width ] and [ widthtau ] are more appropriated to observe the phenomenon .      as we have seen in the section [ sec : viscprof ] , a key role for the esw model",
    "is played by the velocity profile @xmath121 .",
    "several choices can be made for a better answer when the viscous velocity significantly varies .",

    "the parabolic profile presents an advanced reaction , in relation to the top of the bump , compared to the linear profile .",
    "the phenomenon is clearer for the displacement thickness than the friction term .",
    "this difference is explained by the expression of @xmath302 .",

    "the boundary layer acts as a new topography for the model ( eq . [ finalcloseflux ] ) .",
    "this model is an example of `` interactive boundary layer '' or `` viscous inviscid interaction '' .",
    "the flux in the momentum equation contains not only the hydrostatic pressure term @xmath303 but an additional correction term of the same order of magnitude as the friction .",
    "the friction term is no longer a combination of velocity and depth ( as in usual laws such as darcy or manning ) but the result of a viscous boundary layer like approach ( eq . ) .",
    "as it is , it actually depends on the topography , as evidenced by the examples provided in the last part of the work .",
    "in particular its maximum is reached before the summit of a bump .",
    "this effect is limited here , and it is a limitation of this work , because the velocity profiles used lead to constant shape and friction coefficients . as a consequence , possible boundary layer separation with recirculation downstream of the bump can not be observed .",

    "<S> shallow water equations are widely used at several scales for liquid flows when the depth is smaller than the longitudinal scale . </S>",
    "<S> they are based on assumptions on the velocity profile which allow to estimate its shape factor and the shear stress at the wall to close the system of equations . </S>",
    "<S> we present here a two layers decompositon between an ideal fluid and a viscous layer , in the spirit of ibl ( interactive boundary layer ) or ivi ( inviscid viscous interaction ) introduced in aeronautics . </S>",
    "<S> it means that the two layers interact . </S>",
    "<S> the displacement thickness of the viscous layer and the order of magnitude of the shear stress at the wall are supposed small and of same order of magnitude . </S>",
    "<S> we use this small parameter for expansion and obtain a coupled system of two interacting layers , the viscous layer being then a kind of apparent topography due to the displacement thickness . </S>",
    "<S> we show the link with classical shallow water equations . </S>",
    "<S> the assumption on the velocity profile shape is rejected in the viscous layer , which makes assumptions on profiles ( shape factor and wall shear stress ) more precise . </S>",
    "<S> we test the final system on some classical cases like the starting flow , the flow over bump at several froude regimes . </S>",
    "<S> we finally focus on the flow over a bump in subcritical flows . </S>",
    "<S> the computed wall shear stress in this configuration presents some characteristic features of the influence of the boundary layer , it depends on the topography , and moreover its maximum is reached before the top of the bump , which is impossible in classical shallow water equations . also , an additional term with the same magnitude as the shear stress appears in the system , which can be interpreted as a correction to the pressure .    </S>",
