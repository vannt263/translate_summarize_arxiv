    "systematic studies of the dependence of galaxy properties on environment began with analyses of the relation between galaxy morphology and local density ( oemler 1974 ; dressler 1980 ) .",
    "it later became evident that star formation is more strongly affected by environment than morphology ( hashimoto et al .",
    "large surveys , for example the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; york et al .",
    "2000 ) and the two - degree field galaxy redshift survey ( 2dfgrs ; colless et al .",
    "2001 ) provided samples large enough to study the effects of local galaxy density on a multiplicity of galaxy properties .",
    "it was shown that the star formation and structural properties of galaxies depend strongly on their mass ( e.g. kauffmann et al .",
    "2003 ; shen et al .",
    "2003 ; baldry et al .",
    "because of this , and because galaxy mass is itself correlated with environment , it is important to bin galaxies by mass before studying how their properties vary with local density .",
    "several analyses showed that at fixed mass , the dependence of colour / star formation on density is stronger than that of structural properties such as concentration index and stellar surface mass density ( kauffmann et al .",
    "2004 ; li et al . 2006a ; bamford et al . 2009 ; skibba et al .",
    "this suggests that environmentally - driven processes lead to cessation of star formation in a galaxy , but do not strongly affect its structure .    an alternative way of quantifying environmental effects is to study how the properties of galaxies vary as a function of distance from the centers of groups and clusters .",
    "the `` center '' is usually defined as the position of the brightest galaxy in the system and the distance is usually scaled to the virial radius .",
    "one result that has emerged from such studies is that at fixed clustercentric distance , galaxy properties do not depend strongly on the mass of the group ( balogh et al .",
    "2004 ; van den bosch et al .",
    "this does not agree with a scenario in which the ram - pressure effects are responsible for removing the cold interstellar medium in galaxies and shutting down star formation .",
    "ram - pressure depends on the square of the velocity at which a galaxy is moving through the surrounding gas , so it should operate more efficiently in galaxies in more massive dark matter halos .    in 1980 ,",
    "larson , tinsley & caldwell suggested that the gas _ envelopes _ surrounding disks are most easily stripped by ram - pressure effects when they fall into a cluster .",
    "after a few gyr , the galaxy will have converted its available cold gas into stars and because there is no infall of new gas , the galaxy will `` starve '' and stop forming stars .",
    "this mechanism has long been part of semi - analytic models of galaxy formation ( e.g. kauffmann et al . 1993 ) . in recent years , the predictions of these models",
    "have been compared with data from sdss and it has been found that the fraction of red satellites is _ higher _ in the models than in the data ( kimm et al .",
    "2009 ; weinmann et al .",
    "star formation quenching timescales must therefore be quite long ( 2 - 3 gyr ) in satellite galaxies ( wang et al . 2007 ) . in the optical astronomy community , `` slow gas starvation '' has thus come to be accepted as the main physical process determining how galaxies evolve in dense environments .",
    "we note , however , that optical studies present a biased picture of how environment affects galaxies . in disk galaxies , atomic gas generally extends to substantially larger radii than the stars .",
    "ram - pressure will act primarily on low density atomic gas in the outer regions of galaxies , rather than the dense molecular gas in their central regions .",
    "the first systematic studies of the dependence of the atomic gas content of galaxies on environment ( haynes , giovanelli & chincarini 1984 ; giovanelli & haynes 1985 ; gavazzi 1987 ) found that disk galaxies in clusters exhibit a deficiency in hi content that strongly increases towards the cluster centre and that matches the predictions of the the ram - pressure stripping model introduced by gunn & gott ( 1972 ) .",
    "integrated co observations of cluster galaxies suggested that there is no deficiency of molecular gas in hi - deficient galaxies ( kenney & young 1989 ) , but resolved studies showed some evidence of co depletion when the hi is stripped to within the optical disk ( vollmer et al .",
    "2008 ; fumagalli et al .",
    "both results support the idea that ram - pressure stripping primarily affects gas in the outer regions of galaxies , proceeding inward .",
    "subsequent work by gavazzi ( 1989 ) , cayatte et al .",
    "( 1990 ) , kenney , van gorkom & vollmer ( 2004 ) , chung et al .",
    "( 2009 ) emphasized the frequent presence of cluster galaxies with truncated hi disks which , together with examples of disturbed hi morphologies and one - side tails , also support the mechanism of ram - pressure .",
    "finally , sph simulations ( abadi , moore & bower 1999 ; vollmer 2009 ) of galaxies orbiting through the intra - cluster medium then demonstrated that ram - pressure can in fact be responsible for distorted hi disks similar to those seen in the observations .",
    "the degree to which ram - pressure may affect the interstellar medium of galaxies outside the rich cluster environment is not yet well understood .",
    "available samples have generally been too small to quantify environmental effects across a large dynamic range in local density or dark matter halo mass .",
    "the state - of - the - art blind hi survey , the arecibo legacy fast alfa survey ( alfalfa ; giovanelli et al .",
    "2005 ) , does detect hi in galaxies in environments spanning a range of environments from voids to rich clusters , but alfalfa is still a shallow survey so it will only detect gas - rich galaxies at redshifts greater than @xmath3 . in this paper , we employ the stacking technique described in fabello et al .",
    "( 2011a , hereafter paper i ) to study the _ average _ cold gas content of galaxies as a function of local density for a sample of @xmath4 galaxies with redshifts in the range @xmath5 .",
    "by comparing the variation of the hi gas fraction with environment with the variation of their total and central specific star formation rates , we aim to constrain the environments in which ram - pressure stripping effects become important",
    ". as we have discussed , ram - pressure stripping will preferentially affect the low density outer disks of galaxies , which are dominated by atomic gas where star formation is inefficient ( bigiel et al .",
    "2010 ) .",
    "we begin by describing the data and the density estimator that we use in this analysis .",
    "we then compare the _ relative _ decrease in hi gas fraction and specific star formation rate as a function of local density and compare our results with the results of semi - analytic models implemented on the millennium ii simulation ( boylan - kolchin et al .",
    "discussion and conclusions are presented in the final section .",
    "our galaxies are selected from the `` parent sample '' of the galex arecibo sdss survey ( catinella et al .",
    "2010 ) , which is a volume - limited sample of @xmath612000 galaxies selected from the sdss main spectroscopic sample with stellar masses greater than @xmath7 and redshifts in the range 0.025@xmath80.05 , and which lie in the intersection of the footprints of the sdss data release 6 ( adelman - mccarthy et al .",
    "2008 ) , the galex medium imaging survey ( martin et al . 2005 ) and the alfalfa survey .",
    "we make use of _ sample a _ defined in paper i , which consists of 4726 galaxies in the alfalfa 40% dataset ( haynes et al .",
    "only 23% of _ sample a _ targets are detected by alfalfa .",
    "we employ a stacking technique , which allows us to include the many non - detections .",
    "we refer the reader to paper i for a comprehensive description of the stacking method ; in this paper , we only provide a brief summary . before proceeding",
    ", we also describe the parameters used in this analysis ; these include stellar mass , global and fibre specific star formation rates ( @xmath9[ssfr_par ] ) , and our adopted environmental tracer ( @xmath9[s : tracer ] ) .",
    "alfalfa is a blind hi survey that used the alfa multibeam receiver at the arecibo telescope to scan 7000 deg@xmath10 of the sky over the velocity interval v[km@xmath11s@xmath12\\simeq$][-2500 ; 18000 ] ( i.e. out to z@xmath60.06 ) .",
    "the data acquired are stored as smaller three dimensional cubes of dimension 2.4@xmath132.4@xmath14 on the sky and 5500 km@xmath11s@xmath15 in velocity `` depth '' .",
    "the stacking process that we apply to alfalfa data includes a series of steps , which can be summarized as follows : + * a. create a catalogue of hi spectra * + all our targets are selected from the sdss spectroscopic survey , so we know their position on the sky and their redshift .",
    "we select the alfalfa data - cube which contains the target and integrate the signal from the galaxy over a sky region of 4@xmath164@xmath17 ( our targets are always smaller than the telescope beam , whose fwhm is @xmath63.5@xmath17 ) . for each spectrum",
    "we measure the root mean square ( _ rms _ ) noise , which is used later as a weight .    *",
    "b. stack spectra * + we co - add the signals from n different sources located at different redshifts .",
    "first , we shift each spectrum to the target galaxy rest frequency , so each spectrum is centered at zero velocity .",
    "we stack together the spectra @xmath18 ( i=1, .. n ) using their @xmath191/__rms__@xmath10 as a weight , so that the final spectrum @xmath20 is : @xmath21 if we recover a signal in the stacked spectrum , we measure the integrated emission between the two edges of the hi profile , which are defined manually for each spectrum .",
    "if there is no detection , we evaluate an upper limit , assuming a 5@xmath22 signal with a width of 300 km@xmath11s@xmath15 , smoothing the spectrum to 150 km@xmath11s@xmath15 .",
    "* c. evaluate hi gas fractions * + our aim is to compute the average hi content of a given sample of galaxies , so we are interested in converting our recovered signal into an hi mass and subsequently into an average hi gas fraction .",
    "once we measure an hi flux , we estimate the corresponding hi mass using : @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the luminosity distance and @xmath25 the integrated hi flux . the hi gas fraction is simply defined as m@xmath26/m@xmath27 .",
    "note that we weight each spectrum before stacking by m@xmath27@xmath28 , to convert it into a measure of `` gas fraction '' ( see also the discussion in paper i , appendix a ) .",
    "+ at the median redshift of _ sample a _ , the size of the arecibo telescope beam corresponds to physical scales of 0.15 mpc and may include more galaxies than the targeted one . for our gas fractions to be reliable , we apply a correction for contamination from close companions , as described in detail in appendix a. in summary , for each galaxy which lies inside a region of the beam size @xmath29km@xmath11s@xmath15 around the main target , we estimate its gas fraction from photometry using the relation between colour , stellar mass surface density and hi gas fraction found by zhang et al .",
    "( 2009 ) , and subtract it from the hi mass of the target galaxy .",
    "the corrections are always smaller than a few percent even in the highest density bins .",
    "the optical parameters we use are drawn from the mpa - jhu sdss dr7 release of spectrum measurements or from structured query language ( sql ) queries to the sdss dr7 database server .",
    "we use uv / optical colours derived from convolving the sdss images to the same resolution as the galex images ; this is described in more detail in wang et al .",
    "( 2010 ) .",
    "the parameters used in this paper are the following .",
    "* stellar masses m@xmath27 * : :    are derived from sdss photometry using the spectral energy    distribution ( sed ) fitting technique described in salim et al . (",
    "2007 )    with a chabrier ( 2003 ) initial mass function . * specific star formation rates ( ssfr ) * : :    are defined as the star formation rate per unit stellar mass ,    sfr / m@xmath27 [ yr@xmath15 ] .",
    "we use two    different measures of ssfr to trace different regions of the galaxies :    a fibre and a global specific star formation rate .",
    "1 ) the _ fibre    specific star formation rate _ is measured inside the 3-arcsecond sdss    fiber , and is therefore characteristic of the inner regions . at the    median redshift of the sample ( @xmath31 ) ,",
    "the 3 arcsecond    diameter fiber subtends a physical length scale of 2.1 kpc .",
    "the radius    enclosing 50% of the @xmath32-band light for galaxies with    stellar masses between @xmath33    m@xmath2 ranges from 2 to 3 kpc .",
    "so the fraction of the    total galaxy light going down the fibre will be around 5 - 10% .",
    "we    acquire the fibre specific star formation rates from the mpa - jhu sdss    dr7 release of spectrum    measurements .",
    "briefly , they are evaluated from the spectrum emission lines , to which    a grid of photo - ionization models from @xcite is fitted , following    the methods described in @xcite . for objects",
    "whose signal is    contaminated by agn emission or for objects with low s / n emission    lines , the sfrs are derived indirectly from the 4000  break strength .",
    "2 ) the _ global specific star formation rate _ is obtained by applying a    spectral energy distribution ( sed ) fitting technique to the five    optical and two galex uv total flux measurements .",
    "a more thorough    discussion of this procedure is presented in saintonge et al .",
    "( 2011 ) .      [",
    "cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     we also caution that the analysis presented in this work is only statistical in nature .",
    "when stacking , it is not possible to distinguish between the effects of starvation or ram - pressure mechanisms in individual galaxies . without resolved gas maps , we have no information on the spatial extent or the morphology of the atomic gas in the galaxies in our sample , which would more clearly diagnose ram - pressure stripping in individual systems .",
    "it would also be very interesting to study relative trends in gas and stars not only as a function of local density , but as a function of dark matter halo mass .",
    "this could be done by correlating the available alfalfa data with group catalogues generated from the sdss ( yang et al .",
    "2007 ) . with the full alfalfa data set",
    ", it will be possible to measure the decrease in hi for increasing group / clustercentric distance , which would put stronger constraints on ram - pressure stripping mechanisms . eventually , the all - sky surveys planned at the westerbork telescope ( apertif ; verheijen et al .",
    "2008 ) and at the australian ska pathfinder telescope ( askap ) will scan the sky in the 21 centimeter line with much better sensitivity and resolution than currently possible and produce datasets that are ideal for studying the environmentally - driven processes that are important in understanding galaxy evolution .",
    "the arecibo telescope is a single dish of 305 m in diameter and has a fwhm beam of @xmath63.5 arcminutes at 21 cm , which corresponds to a physical scale of 150 kpc at the mean redshift of the galaxies in our sample ( @xmath34 ) .",
    "confusion of signals coming from different galaxies within the beam at similar redshift is thus of possible concern .",
    "an example of such a case is shown in figure [ fig : appb : eg ] , where two additional companion galaxies are located within the beam .",
    "the sdss image of the galaxy is shown on the left and the yellow circle indicates the arecibo beam size . in the right upper panel ,",
    "the resulting spectrum obtained with arecibo is shown .",
    "the vertical lines flag the expected central velocities of the three objects from their sdss redshifts .",
    "as discussed in paper i , @xmath93 , we visually inspected each spectrum and discarded the ones with a strong signal close to the galaxy but not centered at the expected redshift , so the galaxy shown in [ fig : appb : eg ] will actually be discarded from the sample . in our analysis , confusion will arises from the stacking of non - detected hi emission , or if the companion and main target have almost exactly the same redshift .        in previous work ( paper i , fabello et al .",
    "2011b ) we did not apply any correction for possible confusion . for the environmental analysis ,",
    "confusion may be larger , especially in the high density bins where galaxies are more clustered . in order to identify confused objects ,",
    "we search the mpa - jhu spectroscopic sample of galaxies with m@xmath27@xmath35m@xmath2 for objects with projected distance smaller than the beam fwhm and velocity separation smaller than 300 km@xmath11s@xmath15 . if the velocity difference is larger than this value , the hi signals will not overlap .",
    "companions at large velocity separation may increase the noise in the baseline , but do not affect the measured gas content . around",
    "20% of _ sample a _ targets have at least one companion that meet these criteria .",
    "in order to correct for confusion , we proceed as follows :    * we estimate the expected gas content of each companion , using the relation between colour , stellar mass surface density and hi gas fraction derived by zhang et al .",
    "( 2009 ) : @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the surface brightness in the @xmath38-band , and @xmath39 and @xmath32 are sdss magnitudes corrected for galactic extinction . *",
    "we estimate the actual signal contaminating the stacked spectrum .",
    "first , we apply a correction factor to the emission from the companion ( @xmath40 ) using the projected distance between the target and the companion .",
    "the beam profile can be approximated with a 2d gaussian with @xmath41arcminutes and @xmath42arcminutes , so that its response decreases at the edges .",
    "the bigger companion in figure [ fig : appb : eg ] , for example , lies at a projected distances of @xmath43arcminutes , and @xmath44arcminutes from the target .",
    "therefore , @xmath45$]=0.8 of its flux would be recorded .",
    "+ likewise , only part of the signal from the companions will actually overlap with the main target in velocity space . to estimate this second correction factor ( @xmath46 )",
    ", we calculate the expected hi line widths of both the main target ( @xmath47 ) and the companion ( @xmath48 ) , assuming a box - shape profile . to evaluate the observed width we use a tully - fisher relation as in paper i ( @xmath493.2 ) , where : @xmath50 , and @xmath51 is evaluated following the relation from giovanelli et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , and using the sdss @xmath38-band magnitude , @xmath52-corrected and corrected for galactic and internal extinction ( as in equations 11 and 12 in giovanelli et al .",
    "the correction factor @xmath46 is given by the velocity overlap ( @xmath53 ) between @xmath47 and @xmath48 : @xmath54 .",
    "as an example , in figure [ fig : appb : eg ] ( bottom spectrum ) the dashed regions represent how we would have modeled the three signals contributing to the spectrum . in the example",
    ", the entire flux from the green companion contributes to the measured signal ( @xmath55 ) , because it overlaps fully with the main target emission ( black region ) .",
    "in contrast , the pink companion contributes only a very small fraction of its emission to the signal ( overlap of @xmath56 ) . * for companions with separation from the main target @xmath57km@xmath11s@xmath15 , we check that the hi mass predicted using eq .",
    "a1 lies below the alfalfa upper limit .",
    "if above , such companions should have been flagged during visual inspection of the spectrum .",
    "failure to detect such a companion actually implies that the zhang et al .",
    "estimate of the hi content is too high ; we then reset our estimate of the gas mass of the companion to the actual alfalfa upper limit . *",
    "finally , we subtract the contributions from all the confused companions to the hi mass measured from the stacked spectrum , as follows .",
    "+ because of the weight we apply to the spectra of the individual galaxies , a gas fraction measured from the stacked spectrum is ( paper i , @xmath493.3 ) : @xmath58 where @xmath24 is the luminosity distance , @xmath59",
