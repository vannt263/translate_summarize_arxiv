    "any physical associations discovered between planetary nebulae ( pne ) , the short - lived but spectacular late evolutionary stage of small and intermediate mass stars ( between 18 m@xmath2 ) , and star clusters would be a valuable discovery that provides a means of establishing accurate astrophysical parameters for the nebulae through fixing distances and progenitor ages from cluster isochrones .",
    "accurate distances are particularly useful , from which one can infer pne physical properties such as the absolute magnitude of the central stars , accurate physical dimensions and fluxes .",
    "also , they would provide excellent calibrators for the surface brightness ",
    "radius relation ( frew & parker 2006 , frew 2008 ) . whereas pne have been found in 4 globular clusters of the milky way ( m15 , m22 , pal 6 and ngc  6441 ; jacoby et al .",
    "1997 ) , none has been reported in the literature as an unambiguous member of a much younger open cluster ( oc ) .",
    "the interest in the latter case is not only due to being able to determine independent distances to individual nebulae , but also because in a young open cluster the progenitor of a now - visible pn will be a reasonably constrained higher mass star than those in globular clusters .",
    "this fact offers the opportunity to calibrate the initial - to - final mass relation of stars on a broad range of masses , usually done by modelling white dwarf populations in open clusters ( e.g. weidemann 2000 , dobbie et al .",
    "2006 ) .",
    "recently , majaess , turner & lane ( 2007 ; mtl07 ) and bonatto , bica & santos jr ( 2008 ; bbs08 ) have performed detailed investigations of possible physical associations between pne and ocs .",
    "mtl07 considered the cluster membership for 13 pne that are located in close proximity to open clusters lying in their lines of sight and listed another 16 pne / open cluster coincidences , which might contain physically associated pairs .",
    "however , they noted that we have yet to establish a single association between a pn and an open cluster based on a correlation between their full set of physical parameters , including the three key parameters of radial velocity , reddening , and distance that need to be in good agreement if an association is to be viable .",
    "bbs08 used near - infrared colour - magnitude diagrams and stellar radial density profiles to study pn / open cluster association for four pairs .",
    "they concluded that the best , but still only probable , cases are those of ngc  2438/m46 and pk  167@xmath301/new cluster 1 . however , parker et al .",
    "( in prep . ) have uncovered another compelling case in an old open cluster that may prove the best candidate yet for a true oc - pn association .",
    "ngc  2438 is a well - known annular pn located about 8 arcminutes from the core of the bright open cluster m46 ( = ngc  2437 ; bbs08 ) . despite its brightness , the cluster was relatively unstudied until recently ( e.g. cuffey 1941 ; stetson 1981 ) .",
    "recently published cluster parameters are relatively well - determined , e.g. @xmath4=0.10 - 0.15 , d = 1.5 - 1.7 kpc and an age of 220 - 250 myr ( sharma et al .",
    "2006 , mtl07 , bbs08 ) .",
    "the estimated turnoff mass is about 3.5 m@xmath2 ( bbs08 ) .",
    "in addition to the possible association with ngc  2438 , m46 is also thought to host the well - studied post - agb candidate oh  231.8 + 4.2 ( jura & morris 1985 ) .",
    "early studies of the radial velocity of ngc  2438 and m46 ( cuffey 1941 ; odell 1963 ) indicated a difference of @xmath530 km  s@xmath0 between the pn and cluster stars , which suggested that the pair constitues a spatial coincidence only .",
    "three red giants in the cluster have systemic velocities ( mermilliod et al . 1989 , 2007 ) identical to that of cluster dwarf members obtained by cuffey ( 1941 ) .",
    "however , pauls & kohoutek ( 1996 ) rekindled interest in the possibility of the pn / open cluster association when they found similar velocities for both , although based on a small number of stars .",
    "both mtl07 and bbs08 pointed out the importance of measuring sufficient stellar radial velocities for the cluster and the pn to establish if the proximity is real or only chance superposition .",
    "previous distance estimates to the cluster and pn gave similar results though the distance estimates to the oc are far more accurate than the crude statistical estimates for the pn distance provided by zhang ( 1995 ) .",
    "a distance can be estimated based on the h@xmath6 surface brightness  radius ( sb-@xmath7 ) relation observed for pne ( e.g. frew & parker 2006 ; frew 2008 ) . using an updated version of the relation first presented in pierce et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , a distance of 1.4@xmath10.4 kpc is estimated .",
    "using instead the relation applicable to bipolar and bipolar core pne ( frew , parker & russeil 2006 ) , d = 1.9 @xmath1 0.5 kpc .",
    "these values are in broad agreement with other recent sb - r determinations in the radio domain , e.g. van de steene & zijlstra ( 1995 ) , d = 1.7 kpc , zhang ( 1995 ) , d = 2.1 kpc , phillips ( 2004 ) , d = 1.2 kpc , and stanghellini , shaw & villaver ( 2008 ) , d=1.2 kpc , and are all compatible with the cluster distances ( mtl07 , bbs08 ) .",
    "because of the recently revived interest in possible oc - pn associations , we obtained new multi - object spectroscopic observations of m46 and ngc  2438 , where a putative association has still not been satisfactorily resolved due to ambiguities and confusion in the literature . here",
    "we present a statistically significant radial velocity sample of 586 stars within 0.5 degrees of the cluster centre .",
    "the data leave no doubt that the pn is not a member of the cluster .",
    "we used the aaomega double - beam spectrograph on the anglo - australian telescope in siding spring , australia on february 17 , 2008 .",
    "the seeing on that night was about 1.5 - 2@xmath8 . in the blue arm we used the 2500v grating , providing @xmath9 spectra between 4800   and 5150  .",
    "these were important for measuring the mean and expansion velocities of the pn from the h@xmath10 and [ oiii ] lines . in the red arm we used the 1700d grating that has been optimized for recording the ca  ii infrared triplet region .",
    "these spectra range from 8350   to 8790  , with @xmath11 .",
    "this setup has the highest spectral resolution available with aaomega and hence the red spectra were used to measure stellar radial velocities ."
