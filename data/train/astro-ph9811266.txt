    "the hypothesis that gamma ray bursts ( grb ) might be responsible for the origin of ultra high energy cosmic rays ( uhecr ) has been proposed by waxman @xcite , who assumed cosmic ray acceleration by momentum diffusion ( 2nd order fermi acceleration ) , or at internal shock waves ( 1st order fermi acceleration ) within the expanding wind .",
    "we investigate here in some more detail the problems and consequences of this idea , in particular under reference to the internal shock scenario @xcite , where the observed variability in grbs is explained by the presence of shocks in an unsteady outflow which occur when expanding subshells of different velocity catch up and merge .",
    "the energy of protons accelerated at internal shocks in grbs is essentially constrained by two conditions : ( 1 ) confinement in the acceleration region , @xmath1 ; ( 2 ) balance of acceleration and synchrotron cooling , @xmath2 . here",
    ", @xmath3 is the observed variability time scale , and @xmath4 is the bulk lorentz factor of the wind ; primed quantities refer to the comoving frame .",
    "it can be shown that energy losses due to photohadronic interactions and other cooling processes are less relevant @xcite . expressing the magnetic field relative to its equipartition value with the radiation , @xmath5",
    ", the maximum proton energy has to satisfy the conditions    [ e : rachen : epmax ] e_p,20 & & 3 ( l_51_b)^1/2 _ 2 ^ -1 + e_p,20 & & 13 ( l_51_b)^-1/4 t_-1 ^ 1/2 _ 2 ^ 5/2    quantities are expressed in canonical units : @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and @xmath9 .",
    "these equations can be rewritten to express the minimum requirements on the physical conditions in the grb wind in order to produce the highest energy cosmic rays :    [ cond ] _ 2 & & e_p,20 ^ 3/4 t_-1 ^ -1/4 + _ b & & 0.2e_p,20 ^ 7/2 t_-1 ^ -1/2 l_51 ^ -1    since the highest energy cosmic rays are observed with energies up to @xmath10 @xcite , grb winds must have bulk lorentz factors @xmath11 and require @xmath12 .",
    "the first condition is remarkably close to the canonical value assumed for grbs in the internal shock scenario @xcite .",
    "the latter condition is reasonable if the cosmic ray energy density dominates about that of relativistic electrons , @xmath13 , because the magnetic field could still be in equipartition with the total energy density in relativistic particles , @xmath14 .",
    "for cosmic ray acceleration at internal shocks , the acceleration site is placed within a relativistically expanding wind .",
    "the acceleration takes place typically at radii @xmath15 , while the expansion continues until the wind hits the decelerated material behind the external shock at radii @xmath16 . in a pointing dominated flux , the magnetic field decreases as @xmath17 and",
    "is largely transversal , because the longitudinal component decays with @xmath18 .",
    "magnetic reconnection can , however , maintain isotropy of the magnetic field , leading to @xmath19 @xcite , consistent with the generic approach of a matter dominated flow where some mechanism keeps the magnetic field in equipartition with the thermal gas . in a decreasing magnetic field ,",
    "charged particles suffer adiabatic energy loss due to the constancy of the adiabatic invariant @xmath20 , which leads to an energy evolution of the nonthermal particle component with @xmath21 .",
    "the condition for adiabaticity is that the time scale of particle gyration is much shorter than the expansion time scale , @xmath22 , which is equivalent to the confinement condition during acceleration for protons sufficiently below the maximum energy defined by @xmath23 . during expansion",
    ", @xmath24 if @xmath25 , and confinement during acceleration implies that even the most energetic protons remain confined in the expanding shell and cool adiabatically . for @xmath19 , @xmath26 remains constant and adiabaticity applies only for protons with @xmath27 , but some cooling should be also expected for @xmath28 ( this requires further calculations ) .",
    "when the material hits the outer shell at @xmath29 , its bulk lorentz factor , @xmath4 , drops as a power law to values close to unity @xcite . in this deceleration phase",
    ", the magnetic field confinement may break up and the energetic particles can be released .",
    "their energy in the comoving field is then @xmath30 , if @xmath31 , and @xmath32 would additionally reduce the energy in the observers frame .",
    "hence , we expect a reduction of the energy of most protons _ at ejection _ by some orders of magnitude compared to their observer frame energy immediately after acceleration . this would essentially rule out a dominant contribution of grbs to the uhecr spectrum above @xmath33 .",
    "the problem of adiabatic losses can be circumvented if the ejection of neutral particles is considered , because they are not coupled to the magnetic field .",
    "the obvious candidates are here neutrons , which are produced by protons in charged current photomeson - production , e.g.  @xmath34 .",
    "this is the same process which is also responsible for the production of neutrinos as a result of the pion decay , @xmath35 , @xmath36 .",
    "neutrinos are produced with an energy @xmath37 ; the neutrino energy can be considerably below this limit , if energy losses of pions and muons are relevant , which is the case in grbs @xcite . the neutrino flux produced by this mechanism was recently proposed to reach observable levels above @xmath38 @xcite .",
    "one can show that the conditions for the acceleration of protons to @xmath39 implies that neutrinos up to @xmath40 must be produced @xcite .",
    "the neutrons are left with about @xmath41 of the proton energy and carry therefore cosmic ray energy efficiently .",
    "the production spectrum of neutrons depends on the both the proton spectrum and the spectrum of background photons .",
    "the relevant photon energies for the reaction are @xmath42 ; for @xmath43 this is below the break energy of grb spectra , so that the integrated number of photons above the reaction threshold rises only slowly with lorentz factor .",
    "the neutron spectrum would than be expected to follow the proton spectrum , which is canonically assumed as @xmath44 ; the same is the case for the accompanying neutrino spectrum ( for details see ref .",
    "@xcite ) .    in order to escape from the grb shell",
    ", neutrons must fulfill two conditions : their decay time in the lab frame , @xmath45 , must be considerably larger than the total time of the burst , and the probability of reabsorption by a @xmath46 reaction must be small .",
    "it is easy to see that the first condition is satisfied in grbs , since @xmath47 for @xmath48 ; for @xmath49 , it may even leave any possible stronger magnetized environment of the grb before undergoing @xmath50-decay .",
    "less trivial is the second condition : the probability of a neutron to leave the grb shell , which has a thickness @xmath51 , is @xmath52 where the integral covers the range of distances of the point of the production of the neutron to the border of the shell .",
    "this probability is directly related to the probability of the neutron to be produced , @xmath53 , where @xmath54 is the time scale for adiabatic cooling of the protons . in the relativistically expanding grb shell we have @xmath55 .",
    "consequently we can write the probability @xmath56 for a uhecr proton to be ejected from the grb as a neutron as @xmath57 ^ 2\\quad.\\ ] ] the characteristic ratio involved in this expression can be expressed by canonical grb parameters , @xmath58 . the probability @xmath56 as a function of @xmath59 is shown in fig.[f : rachen ] , together with the lower limits on @xmath60 to produce uhecr protons .",
    "we see that the same conditions which make grbs perfect proton accelerators , makes them also to almost perfect `` neutron bombs '' with ejection efficiencies of order @xmath61 .",
    "under the assumption that grbs produce protons with an energy density comparable to the radiation , and that each proton produces about 1 pion during its lifetime , i.e.  transferring about @xmath62 of the cosmic ray energy to neutrinos , waxman and bahcall @xcite have shown that grbs can produce a diffuse background flux of neutrinos above @xmath38 , which would lead to about 10 to 100 grb correlated events per year in a @xmath63 underground neutrino detector .",
    "this flux should be easily detectable above the background due to the possibility of a correlation in both direction and time with the grb .",
    "the same conditions would suffice to contribute a large fraction of the observed uhecr flux @xcite , but the connection of cosmic ray and neutrino ejection efficiencies depends in the grb parameters .    here",
    ", we have argued that energetic protons can not be emitted directly from a grb without losing most of their energy in adiabatic expansion , but that neutrons produced in charged current photohadronic interactions can escape the grb and contribute to the cosmic ray proton spectrum after @xmath50-decay , provided that every proton produces on average one pion or less .",
    "this `` one - pion - requirement '' constrains the physical parameters of grbs , but allows the acceleration of @xmath64 protons , however , with a strongly decreasing ejection efficiency for larger energies .",
    "one conclusion might be that only the most luminous grbs can produce cosmic rays of the highest energies , @xmath65 .",
    "the neutrino flux is then one - to - one correlated to the emitted cosmic ray flux , thus vhe neutrino observations could test the hypothesis of uhecr origin from grbs ; non - observation of a grb correlated neutrino flux at the level predicted by waxman and bahcall @xcite would rule out this hypothesis for standard assumptions of uhecr propagation .",
