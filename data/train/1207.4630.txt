    "_ qcd sum rules _ relate observable hadronic properties to the parameters of qcd , the qft responsible for the formation of the bound states , by evaluating appropriate correlators of interpolating currents on the hadron level and on the level of quarks and gluons , the qcd degrees of freedom . all nonlocal products of currents may be expressed as series of local operators by wilson s _ operator product expansion _ ; as a consequence of this at qcd level correlators obtain perturbative and nonperturbative contributions , the latter involving the universal vacuum condensates .",
    "_ borel transformations _ to new variables  called the borel parameters  serve to suppress impacts of both excitations and continuum , and to remove existing subtraction terms . by rephrasing the perturbative parts of qcd - level correlators as dispersion integrals over spectral densities , our ignorance about higher hadronic states can be hidden by invoking the concept of _ quark  hadron duality _ : beyond certain effective thresholds , all the perturbative qcd contributions are _ assumed _ to cancel those of hadron excitations and continuum . for _ infinitely large _ borel ( mass ) parameters , all contributions of nonperturbative qcd vanish and one ends up with qcd sum rules in the limit of _ local duality _ ( ld ) ; these ld sum rules constitute famous tools for the analysis of form factors .",
