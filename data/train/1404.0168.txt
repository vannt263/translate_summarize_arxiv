    "by generating an equation of state with a significant negative pressure before the radiation epoch , inflation @xcite solves a number of cosmological conundrums , such as the horizon , monopole , entropy problems . after almost thirty - five years of extensive research , inflation",
    "is now considered to be a crucial part of the cosmological history of the universe , having affected indelibly its observational features . in the simplest inflation model ,",
    "the early inflating universe is driven by a scalar field called inflaton , which is classically rolling down the hill of its potential .",
    "inflation predicts a nearly scale - invariant primordial scalar perturbation , which is regarded as the seed of the large scale structures in present .",
    "furthermore , there could be also a primordial tensor perturbation during the inflation time in principle , which is a signal of testing the primordial gravitational waves .",
    "all of these are essentially from the quantum fluctuations of the scalar field and the curvature of the universe @xcite .",
    "these small fluctuations are amplified by the nearly exponential expansion , yielding the scalar and tensor primordial power spectra , which can be observed by measuring the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) , such as the satellite - based wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( wmap ) @xcite and _ planck _ @xcite experiments .",
    "although the observed cmb temperature fluctuations , which are generated by scalar perturbations , already helped us to constrain many inflation models , there are still many compelling models that predict almost the same parameter values , which are consistent with observations . a large number of current cmb experiment efforts now target b-_mode _ polarization , which could be only generated by tensor perturbations .",
    "recently , a ground - based `` background imaging of cosmic extragalactic polarization '' experiment has reported their results ( bicep2 ) .",
    "they have shown that the observed b-_mode _ power spectrum at certain angular scales is well fitted by a lensed-@xmath0cdm + tensor theoretical model with tensor - to - scalar ratio @xmath1 , and @xmath2 is disfavoured at @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "in fact , although there are many inflation models , we still do not known what is the inflaton field . as a candidate for the theory of everything",
    ", string theory should tell us how a successful theory of cosmology can be derived from it .",
    "general relativity might break down due to the very high energies during inflation , and corrections from string theory might be needed . in the non - perturbative string / m theory ,",
    "any physical process at the very short distance take an uncertainty relation , called the stringy space - time uncertainty relation ( ssur ) : @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the string length scale , and @xmath6 , @xmath7 are the uncertainties in the physical time and space coordinates .",
    "it is suggested that the ssur is a universal property for strings as well as d - branes @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , we now have no ideas to derive cosmology directly from string / m theory .",
    "brandenberger and ho @xcite have proposed a variation of space - time noncommutative field theory to realize the stringy space - time uncertainty relation without breaking any of the global symmetries of the homogeneous isotropic universe . if inflation is affected by physics at a scale close to string scale , one expects that space - time uncertainty must leave vestiges in the cmb power spectrum@xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we shall study the power - law inflation in the noncommutative space - time with a different choice of the @xmath8 functions defined below . in this model",
    ", it is much more clear to see the effect of noncommutative space - time and much easier to deal with the perturbation functions .",
    "a linear contribution to the power spectra of the scalar and tensor perturbations is given in this model .",
    "we also confront this model with latest results from the _ planck _ and bicep2 experiments , and we find this model is well consistent with observations . this paper is organized as follows . in next section , we will briefly review cosmological perturbation theory in the noncommutative space - time ; in sec.[sec : power ] we calculate the power spectra of the power inflation model in the noncommutative space - time , and compare with observations . in the last section , we will draw our conclusions and give some discussions . and also , in the appendix.[app : beta ]",
    ", we presents the detail calculations and discussions on the ssur algebra and @xmath8 functions .",
    "given a non commutative space - time , the cosmological background will still be described by the einstein equations since the background fields only depend on the time variable . assuming a homogeneous and isotropic background , in the following",
    ", we will take the friedmann - robertson - walker metric : @xmath9 for a spatially flat universe ( @xmath10 ) .",
    "thus the ssur relation ( [ equ : ssur ] ) becomes : @xmath11 which is not well defined when @xmath12 is large , because the argument @xmath13 for the scale factor on the r.h.s .",
    "changes over time interval @xmath12 , and it is thus not clear what to use for @xmath14 in eq.([equ : ssur1 ] ) .",
    "the problem is the same when one uses the conformal time @xmath15 defined by @xmath16 .",
    "therefore , for later use , a new time coordinate @xmath17 is introduced as @xmath18 such that the metric becomes @xmath19 and the ssur relation is now well defined : @xmath20    the action of the perturbations in @xmath21-dimension space - time could be given as the following @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the total spatial coordinate volume and the prime denotes the derivatives with respect to a new time coordinate @xmath24 defined as @xmath25 here we have defined @xmath26 and @xmath27 is the so - called `` mukhanov variable '' . here we have taken a different form of the @xmath8 functions , which is equivalent to that used in the literatures by the mean of integration , see the appendix.[app : beta ] for detail calculations and discussions .",
    "it is now much more easier to deal with the equations of motion for the field @xmath28 : @xmath29 which could be derived from the action ( [ equ : action31 ] ) . here",
    "the mode function is defined by @xmath30 . to calculate the power spectrum of the scalar perturbation",
    ", we have @xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is the curvature perturbation .",
    "while to calculate the power spectrum of the tensor perturbation , we have @xmath35 , @xmath36 and @xmath37 , where @xmath38 denotes the independent degree of the tensor mode , @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "therefore , the power spectrum of the metric scalar and tensor perturbation are given by @xmath41 and @xmath42",
    "the power - law inflation scenario is driven by an exponential potential @xmath43 where @xmath44 and @xmath45 are some constant . for slow - roll inflation",
    ", the parameter @xmath45 should be large enough . here",
    "and after we work in the unit @xmath46 .",
    "the corresponding solution of the friedmann equation is exactly the power - law form @xmath47 which is equivalent to the solution when an idea fluid is given with a constant equation of state parameter @xmath48 : @xmath49^{1/(n+1 ) } \\,.\\ ] ] the hubble parameter @xmath50 is given by @xmath51 during inflation ( @xmath45 is large ) , we have @xmath52 where @xmath53 denotes the value of @xmath54 during inflation . by using the definition of @xmath15 and @xmath55 in eqs.([equ : teta1 ] ) and ( [ equ : beta1 ] ) , we get @xmath56 and @xmath57 by using the friedmann equation @xmath58 , we have @xmath59 , thus we get @xmath60 .",
    "so that the solution of eq.([equ : eom ] ) for the scalar perturbation is the same with that for the tensor perturbation , then we get the tensor - to - scalar ratio @xmath61 the coefficient of the third term in the perturbative equation ( [ equ : eom ] ) is then given by @xmath62 where we have defined @xmath63 which decreases with time @xmath17 .    in the appendix.[app : beta ] , we have shown that all the modes with wave number @xmath64 are created when the ssur is saturated . from eq.([equ : k0 ] ) , we get the upper bound of the comoving wave number in the power - law inflation as @xmath65 which means at time @xmath17 , a mode with comoving wave number @xmath66 is created .",
    "then the correspond parameter @xmath67 during inflation ( @xmath68 ) is given by @xmath69 where @xmath70 is the hubble horizon , see eq.([equ : hinf ] ) . as we discussed earlier , @xmath5 measures the uncertainty between the space and time though ssur ( [ equ : ssur ] ) .",
    "for example , when one have a determined time @xmath17 , there is at least an uncertainty @xmath5 when one measures the distance @xmath71 .",
    "however things are different in the case of an horizon existing . in such case",
    ", one can not measure the distance larger than the horizon , e.g. @xmath70 since the causality losts and even if @xmath72 is also larger than the horizon , one can totally lost the prediction of the distance .",
    "this is equivalent to the case when @xmath73 , which can not be imaged in a real word .",
    "therefore , in the following , we will focus on the case @xmath74 , or @xmath75 , one shall see that it is consistent with observations . since @xmath67 decreases with time @xmath17 ,",
    "see eq.([equ : lambda ] ) , then @xmath76 during the inflation time .",
    "therefore , in the following , we will regard @xmath67 as a small free parameter in the model , and keep up to the first order of @xmath67 in calculations .",
    "at the same time when a mode is created ( [ equ : k01 ] ) , the wave number cross the comoving hubble horizon is given by @xmath77 therefore , during inflation when @xmath68 , we have @xmath78 which means all the modes are created inside the horizon in the power - law inflation scenario .",
    "thus , the power spectrum will be calculated at the time when the mode crosses the hubble horizon ( @xmath79 ) .",
    "the equation of motion([equ : eom ] ) could be rewritten as @xmath80 where @xmath81 up to the first order of @xmath82 and @xmath67 . with the initial bunch - davies vacuum condition : @xmath83 we get the solution to eq.([equ : eomapp ] ) @xmath84 where @xmath85 is the hankel s function of the first kind . at",
    "the superhorizon scales the solution becomes @xmath86 then the power spectrum of the scalar perturbation is given by eq.([equ : scalar ] ) as follows @xmath87 ^ 2",
    "\\left(\\frac{h}{2\\pi}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{k}{ah}\\right)^{3 - 2\\nu } \\bigg|_{k = ah } \\approx \\frac{n}{8\\pi^2 } \\frac { h^2 } { m_{pl}^2}\\bigg|_{k = ah}\\,,\\ ] ] while the power spectrum of the tensor perturbation is given by eq.([equ : tensor ] ) as follows @xmath88 ^ 2",
    "\\left(\\frac{h}{2\\pi}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{k}{ah}\\right)^{3 - 2\\nu } \\bigg|_{k = ah } \\approx \\frac{2}{\\pi^2 } \\frac { h^2 } { m_{pl}^2}\\bigg|_{k = ah}\\,\\ ] ] therefore the spectrum index of the power spectrum for scalar @xmath89 and tensor perturbations @xmath90are given by @xmath91 the consistency relation becomes @xmath92 when @xmath93 , it reduces to the one in the commutative case , i.e. @xmath94 .",
    "one shall see that with the help of @xmath67 term in the above equation , the power - law inflation in noncommutative space - time may be more consistent with observations than that in the commnutative case .      in the following",
    ", we will constrain the noncommutative power - law inflation by using the analyse results from data including the @xmath95 cmb temperature likelihood supplemented by the wmap large scale polarization likelihood ( henceforth @xmath95+wp ) . other cmb data extending the _ planck _ data to higher-@xmath96 ,",

    "<S> in this paper , we propose a new method to calculate the mode functions in the noncommutative power - law inflation model . in this model , all the modes created when the stringy space - time uncertainty relation is satisfied are generated inside the hubble horizon during inflation . </S>",
    "<S> it turns out that a linear term describing the noncommutative space - time effect contributes to the power spectra of the scalar and tensor perturbations . confronting this model with latest results from _ planck _ and bicep2 , </S>",
    "<S> we constrain the parameters in this model and we find it is well consistent with observations . </S>"
