    "as expected , when the magnetic field value approaches the critical point , the potts spin correlation length @xmath196 becomes larger ( the details are not presented here ) .",
    "consequently , the spin - spin correlations in the three - state quantum potts model ( [ ham1 ] ) with antiferromagnetic coupling @xmath88 show characteristic behavior , i.e. , algebraic decay to zero for the massless phase @xmath166 and exponential decay to zero for the massive phase @xmath123 .",
    "von neumann entanglement entropy has been demonstrated here to be an effective tool for estimating the quantum critical point of the mixed ferro - antiferromagnetic three - state quantum potts model ( [ ham1 ] ) . the critical point estimate @xmath0 gives an improved estimate for two kosterlitz - thouless transitions in the antiferromagnetic region of the @xmath4@xmath5 phase diagram of the quantum version of the three - state chiral clock model ( [ clock1 ] ) .",
    "the first transition point is located at @xmath197 for @xmath9 between disordered and incommensurate phases .",
    "the second transition point is located at @xmath6 for @xmath93 between incommensurate and commensurate phases .",
    "the latter point is deep within the phase diagram of the chiral clock model and follows from the duality transformation @xmath90 , @xmath198  @xcite .",
    "we also used the von neumann entropy with the correlation length to calculate the central charge of the underlying conformal field theory in the massless phase @xmath11 .",
    "our estimate @xmath12 indicates that the known exact value @xmath95 at the particular point @xmath13 ( the purely antiferromagnetic three - state quantum potts model ) extends throughout the massless phase of the mixed ferro - antiferromagnetic model , and thus into the massless phase of the three - state quantum chiral clock model for @xmath3 .",
    "this is an interesting feature of the @xmath4@xmath5 phase diagram of the three - state quantum chiral clock model .",
    "previously it was demonstrated that the ferromagnetic three - state potts model plays a key role in the ferromagnetic region @xmath199 of the phase diagram  @xcite .",
    "it was not clear however , to what extent the antiferromagnetic three - state potts model featured in the antiferromagnetic region @xmath200 of this phase diagram .",
    "here we have seen that although the antiferromagnetic three - state potts model does not make a direct appearance in the @xmath4@xmath5 phase diagram  in contrast to the ferromagnetic three - state potts model ",
    "it rather manifests itself indirectly through the value @xmath95 of the central charge in the massless incommensurate phase .",
    "this is consistent with a recent dmrg study of the three - state quantum chiral clock model ( in terms of different variables ) where it has been shown that the value @xmath95 extends deep into the incommensurate phase  @xcite .",
    "we conclude by noting that the estimated continuously varying spin - spin correlation exponent @xmath14 in the parameter range of the massless phase shown in fig .",
