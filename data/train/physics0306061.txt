    "the reliable and accurate _ ab initio _",
    "methods for atomic calculations are necessary not only for atomic physics and quantum chemistry , but also for application of atomic physics to the investigation of the fundamental interactions . for example",
    "precision calculations of cs were necessary to test electroweak theory on the level of radiative corrections at low energy ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "recent search for the possible variation of the fine structure constant @xmath2 @xcite in space - time also required large - scale atomic calculations @xcite .    at present",
    "there are several widely used methods for calculations of many - electron atoms . for atoms with one valence electron above the core",
    "the many - body perturbation theory ( mbpt ) appears to be very effective @xcite . for the atoms with more than one valence electrons",
    "the accuracy of the conventional mbpt techniques is not satisfactory mainly because of the poor convergence of the mbpt for the valence - valence correlations . because of that non - perturbative methods are usually preferable @xcite .",
    "however , the core - valence correlations can still be effectively treated with mbpt .",
    "because of that it was suggested to combine mbpt for the core - valence correlations with the configuration interaction ( ci ) for valence - valence correlations within the ci+mbpt method @xcite .    in this method",
    "ci calculation for valence electrons is done with the effective hamiltonian @xmath0 .",
    "this hamiltonian accounts for core polarization and screening of the two - electron interaction between valence electrons .",
    "it may be formed within the brillouin - wigner variant of mbpt . in practice",
    "most of the calculations were done within the second order mbpt @xcite .",
    "the operator @xmath0 is defined for valence electrons only .",
    "therefore , ci+mbpt method is equivalent to the multi - reference mbpt with the model space coinciding with the whole valence space .",
    "the use of the brillouin - wigner variant of mbpt allows to avoid problems with intruder states , but leads to the energy - dependent effective hamiltonian  @xcite .",
    "ci+mbpt method has several important limitations :    1 .",
    "the number of valence electrons should not be large .",
    "the accuracy of the ci method rapidly decreases when this number exceeds 3 or 4 . 2 .",
    "only the lower part of the valence spectrum can be presented accurately . for the energies above the excitation energy of the core the effective hamiltonian has poles and results of the ci+mbpt method may become unreliable  @xcite .",
    "the accuracy of the calculations is limited because the effective hamiltonian does not account for the higher order core - valence correlations . with the second order effective hamiltonian the typical accuracy for the transition frequencies is of the order of a percent .",
    "the first two limitations are intrinsic to the method . in order to address the third one it is necessary to go beyond the second order mbpt .",
    "one obvious way to do this is the order - by - order approach .",
    "however , it is known that for atoms with one valence electron the third order calculations are often even less accurate than the second order ones . besides , for atoms with more than one valence electron the third order is already too complicated for practical use .",
    "the arguments given above lead us to one of the variants of the all - order methods .",
    "the coupled - cluster method is one of the most widely used  @xcite .",
    "it gives the nonlinear system of equations for cluster amplitudes . in order to truncate this system",
    "it is often restricted to sd excitations . the linearized version of the coupled - cluster equations in the sd - approximation are also known as pair equations , or sd - method @xcite .",
    "it was used for the calculations of the atoms with one valence electron and proved to be significantly more accurate than the second order mbpt  @xcite .",
    "so , we suggest to use ci+sd method instead of ci+mbpt for the calculations of the atoms with few valence electrons .    in order to use the sd - method for the effective hamiltonian",
    ", we developed the brillouin - wigner variant of these equations and added equations for the two - electron amplitudes , which were absent in the one - electron atoms . that allowed us to form the effective hamiltonian for valence electrons in sd - approximation .",
    "as a test system for the ci+sd method we study a toy model of a 4-electron atom with two valence electrons above the core @xmath1 .",
    "we use a very short basis set , for which the 4-electron full ci is possible .",
    "that allows to test the method without addressing such questions as saturation of the basis set and the role of the breit interaction , which we do not include here .",
    "this model was recently considered in  @xcite and appeared useful for the study of the higher orders in the residual core - valence interaction .",
    "it is well known that if we split the total many - electron hilbert space in two subspaces @xmath3 and @xmath4 , @xmath5 , the full schrdinger equation can be equivalently rewritten in a following form : @xmath6 where @xmath7 eq .",
    "( [ heff12 ] ) shows , that the effective hamiltonian in the subspace @xmath3 has the form : @xmath8 note that this @xmath9 expansion is formally equivalent , for example , to the exclusion of the small component from the dirac equation . for practical purposes the particular choice of the subspace",
    "@xmath3 is very important . for atoms with few valence electrons",
    "it is natural to associate this subspace with the valence one .",
    "in other words @xmath3 subspace corresponds to the frozen - core approximation @xmath10 .",
    "this means that core - core and core - valence correlations are accounted for on the stage of formation of the operator @xmath0 , while _ all _ valence correlations are treated explicitly when solving  eq.([heff12 ] ) .    of course ,",
    "for many - electron atoms the exact form of the operator @xmath11 is not known and some approximations should be used . in principle , mbpt gives consistent procedure for finding an order - by - order expansion of this operator in powers of the residual two - electron interaction . in the lowest ( second ) order @xmath11",
    "is substituted by @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is a one - electron operator .",
    "this leads to the second order effective hamiltonian for valence electrons , which was used in calculations @xcite .",
    "the complete form of the third order expansion for @xmath0 is still unknown and is probably to complicated for practical use .",
    "the most simple and compact variant of the mbpt expansion corresponds to the choice , when @xmath13 is equal to the dirac - fock operator of the core @xmath14 . at least for atoms with one or two valence electrons",
    "this may be also an optimal choice  @xcite . for",
    "more valence electrons one may want to include , at least partly , the field of the valence electrons in @xmath13 .",
    "this leads to many new terms in the mpbt expansion @xcite , but gives better initial approximation . in our calculations we use the dirac - fock code @xcite , which allows for the flexible choice of the self - consistent field .    in the end of this section",
    "we want to mention that sometimes the whole wave function ( [ heff6 ] ) is needed",
    ". then we can recover it from the solution of ( [ heff12 ] ) with the help of relation : @xmath15 we again can use mbpt expansion for @xmath11 here . if we need @xmath16 to calculate some atomic amplitudes , we can use eq.([heff11 ] ) to define corresponding effective operator in the subspace @xmath3 . for",
    "the effective operators one can use the random phase approximation with additional two - electron terms instead of the order - by - order mbpt  @xcite .",
    "this technique was used in calculations of @xmath17-transitions @xcite , polarizabilities @xcite , and hyperfine constants  @xcite .",
    "as we mentioned above , the accuracy of the ci+mbpt method is limited because of the neglect of the higher order corrections to @xmath0 . the sd - method allows to sum to all orders the mbpt terms , which correspond to the one and two holes in the core in all intermediate cross - sections of the goldstone diagrams .",
    "technically this leads to the substitution of the one- and two - electron matrix elements in @xmath0 with corresponding sd - amplitudes .",
    "the explicit form of the sd - equation depends on the choice of the one - electron operator @xmath13 , which is used for the initial approximation .",
    "the simplest form corresponds to @xmath18 , which we assume below .",
    "we expect that in analogy with the ci+mbpt , this variant of the ci+sd method should be good at least for one- and two - electron atoms .    the system of equations for sd - amplitudes splits in three parts .",
    "the first subsystem includes only amplitudes for core excitations .",
    "therefore , these amplitudes do not depend on core - valence and valence amplitudes and should be solved first @xcite . the graphic representation of this subsystem is shown in fig .  [ fig1 ] and  [ fig2 ] .",
    "note that all equations are presented in a form , suitable for iterative solution . at first iteration",
    "we put all sd - amplitudes on the right - hand - sides to zero .",
    "that leaves the single non - zero term in the equation for the two - electron sd - amplitude fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] . as a result we get non - zero two - electron amplitude , but",
    "the one - electron sd - amplitude is still zero . on the next iteration both right - hand - sides in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] and  [ fig2 ] are non - zero .    on the next step",
    "the one electron valence amplitudes and two - electron core - valence amplitudes should be found from the system of equations shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] and  [ fig4 ] .",
    "it is seen that they depend on each other and on the core amplitudes , which were found on the previous step .",
    "this system again can be solved iteratively .",
    "iteration processes on the first and the second steps converge rather rapidly because the energy denominators for _ all _ diagrams are large , because they include the excitation energy of the core .",
    "the latter grows with the number of valence electrons , so we can expect faster convergence for the atoms with more valence electrons .",
    "the one - electron valence sd - amplitudes , which are found from the equations on fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] can be already used for the construction of @xmath19 . however , on this step we still do not have two - electron valence amplitudes .",
    "these can be found by calculating diagrams from fig .",
    "corresponding diagrams depend only on the amplitudes , which are already found on previous steps , so we can calculate two - electron valence sd - amplitudes in one run .",
    "therefore , the third step is rather simple and this is the only new step , which was not used in calculations of one - electron atoms  @xcite .",
    "it means that the sd - method is easily generalized for the many - electron case .",
    "there are several questions , which we did not address above .",
    "first is the energy dependence of the sd - amplitudes . that can be accounted for in a same way , as it was done in ci+mbpt method .",
    "second , we prefer to have hermitian effective hamiltonian , while the valence sd - amplitudes as given by fig .  [ fig3 ] and  [ fig5 ] are non - symmetric .",
    "thus , we need to symmetrize them somehow . these questions will be discussed elsewhere in detail . here",
    "we prefer to give an example of the application of the ci+sd method to a model system , which can be solved ` exactly ' and the accuracy of the ci+sd approximation can be therefore well controlled and compared to that of the ci+mbpt method .",
    "here we consider the atom with @xmath20 and 4 electrons in a very short basis set of 14 orbitals @xmath21 , @xmath22 , and @xmath23 . because of such a short basis set , we can not compare our results with the physical spectrum of c  iii .",
    "instead , we can do the full ci for all 4 electrons and use it as an ` exact ' solution . alternatively",
    ", we can consider the same atom as a two - electron system with the core @xmath24 $ ] . in this case",
    "we can use both ci+mbpt and si+sd methods and compare their results with the known ` exact ' solution .    as an even simpler test systems we can also consider the same system with 2 and 3 electrons .",
    "the core equations fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] and  [ fig2 ] are the same for all three cases .",
    "after they are solved , we can immediately find the correlation correction to the core energy by calculating two diagrams from fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] . the same correction can be found with the help of the full ci for two electrons .",
    "note that sd - method for the two electron system is exact , so both result should coincide . in this way we can effectively check the system of equations for core amplitudes ."
