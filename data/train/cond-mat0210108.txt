    "relaxor ferroelectric based morphotropic phase boundary ( mpb ) ceramics like @xmath9-xpbtio_3 ( pmn - xpt)$ ] @xcite and @xmath10-xpbtio_3 ( pzn - xpt)$ ] @xcite show much higher electromechanical response about their mpbs in comparison to the well known @xmath11 ( pzt ) system @xcite .",
    "the reason why relaxor based mpb systems have much higher electromechanical response is still not very clear eventhough recent theoretical and experimental developments in pzt have improved our understanding of the phase stabilities in the vicinity of the mpb @xcite .",
    "noheda et al have discovered that the tetragonal phase of pzt with compositions ( @xmath12 ) close to the mpb transforms to a monoclinic phase with space group cm at low temperatures @xcite .",
    "ragini et al @xcite and ranjan et al @xcite have discovered yet another low temperature phase transition in which the cm monoclinic phase transforms to another monoclinic phase with cc space group @xcite .",
    "the cm to cc phase transition is an antiferrodistortive ( afd ) transition leading to superlattice reflections which are observable in the electron @xcite and neutron @xcite diffraction patterns only and not in the xrd patterns as a result of which noheda et al missed the cc phase in their high resolution xrd studies at low temperatures .",
    "the tetragonal to cm , and cm to cc transitions are accompanied with pronounced anomalies in the elastic constant and dielectric constant @xcite .",
    "it has been argued @xcite that the monoclinic cm phase provides the path for polarization rotation between tetragonal ( p4 mm ) and rhombohedral ( r3 m ) phases .",
    "x - ray rietveld analysis by ragini et al @xcite , has , however , revealed that the hitherto believed rhombohedral phase of pzt for @xmath13 @xcite is indeed monoclinic ( cm ) with very small domain size leading to composition dependent anomalous broadening of various reflections .",
    "thus the mpb in the pzt system separates the stability fields of tetragonal and monoclinic cm phases @xcite . on application of dc field ,",
    "these monoclinic domains get aligned and merged as a result of which some of the xrd peaks showing anomalous broadening in the unpoled state start exhibiting splittings characteristic of the cm phase in the poled state .",
    "thus , according to ragini et al @xcite , the field induced rhombohedral to cm transition reported by guo et al @xcite is really a transition from a small - domain cm phase to large - domain cm phase .",
    "based on rietveld analysis of the xrd data , ragini et al @xcite have also shown that the tetragonal and monoclinic ( cm ) phases coexist across the mpb in the composition range @xmath14 due to nucleation barrier to the first order transition between the high temperature tetragonal and the low temperature monoclinic cm phases @xcite .",
    "these recent developments in pzt have been followed up by similar studies on the structure of mpb phases in the pmn-@xmath1pt @xcite and pzn-@xmath1pt @xcite systems . in these systems also , the structure of the morphotropic phase in the unpoled state is monoclinic but with a space group pm @xcite , which is different from that in the pzt system .",
    "the pm space group proposed by singh and pandey @xcite and kiat et al @xcite in the mpb region of the pmn - xpt system has recently been confirmed in the high resolution powder xrd studies by noheda et al @xcite contradicting an earlier report of cm space group by the same workers for a similar composition @xcite . however in the pzn-@xmath1pt system , the possibility of monoclinic pm @xcite or orthorhombic bmm2 @xcite structures in the mpb region continues to be debated .",
    "more interestingly , noheda et al @xcite and ohwada , et al @xcite have observed a field - induced irreversible rhombohedral to pm monoclinic phase transition in pzn-0.8pt through the cm monoclinic phase .    using eighth - order expansion of devonshire theory ,",
    "vanderbilt and cohen @xcite have predicted different regions of stability for the monoclinic pm and cm phases that are designated as @xmath4 and @xmath15 , respectively , in their paper .",
    "although both @xmath16 and @xmath3 phases belong to the cm space group , the difference lies in the magnitudes of the components of the polarization ( @xmath17 ) corresponding to the pseudocubic cell . for the @xmath16 phase @xmath18 with @xmath19 , while for the @xmath3 phase , @xmath18 with @xmath20 . as per the phase diagram of vanderbilt and cohen @xcite",
    ", one expects a narrow stability field of the @xmath3 phase between the rhombohedral and @xmath4 phases .",
    "the present work was undertaken to verify the existence of the cm ( @xmath3 ) phase for compositions in between those for the rhombohedral and monoclinic ( pm ) phases using rietveld analysis of x - ray powder diffraction data on pmn-@xmath1pt samples with @xmath1 varying from 0.26 to 0.39 at an interval of @xmath21 = 0.01 . from a careful study of the variation of the dielectric constant and crystal structure with composition ( @xmath1 ) on unpoled pmn-@xmath1pt ceramics ,",
    "we show that the dominant phases in the composition ranges @xmath7 0.26 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath8 are rhombohedral ( r3 m ) , monoclinic @xmath3 ( cm ) , monoclinic @xmath4 ( pm ) and tetragonal ( p4 mm ) , respectively , in reasonable agreement with the predictions of the vanderbilt and cohen s theory @xcite .",
    "samples used in the present work were prepared by a modified solid state route @xcite .",
    "one of the common problems associated with the solid state synthesis of pmn-@xmath1pt ceramics is the appearance of an unwanted pyrochlore phase @xcite . to get rid of this unwanted phase , off - stoichiometric compositions , with excess of mgo and pbo ,",
    "are used @xcite .",
    "for example , noheda et al @xcite have used 15.5 and 2wt@xmath22 excess of mgo and pbo for getting pure perovskite phase .",
    "this naturally perturbs the phase stabilities in the vicinity of the mpb where the crystal structure is very sensitive to even small variations in the composition because of nearly degenerate nature of various phases . in order to bring out the intrinsic features of the pmn-@xmath1pt system ,",
    "it is imperative to prepare pyrochlore phase free pmn-@xmath1pt ceramics in stoichiometric compositions ( i.e. , without using any excess of pbo and mgo ) .",
    "we have achieved this by using @xmath23 and @xmath24 , instead of pbo and mgo , respectively , and introducing one more step in the reaction sequence for mixing of @xmath25 @xcite . in the present work ,",
    "ar grade @xmath26 ( 99.95 % ) , @xmath25 ( 99 % ) , @xmath27 ( 99% ) , @xmath28 ( 99 % ) and ammonium carbonate were used . @xmath24 and",
    "@xmath23 were prepared from @xmath27 and @xmath28 by precipitation .",
    "mixing of various ingredients in stoichiometric proportions was carried out for 6 hours using a ball mill ( retsch , japan ) with zirconia jars and zirconia balls .",
    "ar grade acetone was used as the mixing media .",
    "heat treatments for calcination were carried out in alumina crucibles using a globar furnace .",
    "the columbite precursor @xmath29 ( mn ) @xcite was prepared by calcining a stoichiometric mixture of @xmath30 and @xmath26 at @xmath31 for six hours . at the next stage ,",
    "stoichiometric amount of @xmath25 was mixed with @xmath29 and the mixture was calcined at @xmath31 for six hours to obtain @xmath32mgnb_2o_6-(x)tio_2 $ ] ( mnt ) precursor .",
    "this mnt precursor was then mixed with stoichiometric amount of @xmath23 and calcined at @xmath33 for six hours .",
    "the powder obtained at this stage consists of pure perovskite phase of pmn-@xmath1pt free from the pyrochlore phase .",
    "cold compaction of calcined powders was done using a steel die of 12-mm diameter and an uniaxial hydraulic press at an optimised load of 65 kn .",
    "2 % polyvinyl alcohol ( pva ) solution in water was used as binder .",
    "the green pellets were kept at @xmath34 for 10 hours to burn off the binder material and then sintered at @xmath35 for 6 hours in sealed crucibles with controlled pbo atmosphere .",
    "density of the sintered pellets was higher than 98% of the theoretical density .",
    "sintered pellets were crushed into fine powders and then annealed at @xmath34 for 10 hours to remove the strains introduced during crushing for x - ray characterizations .",
    "xrd measurements were carried out using a 12kw rotating anode ( cu ) based rigaku powder diffractometer operating in the bragg - brentano geometry and fitted with a graphite monochromator in the diffracted beam .",
    "fired - on silver paste was used for electroding the sintered pellets .",
    "the dielectric measurements at 1khz were carried out using a hioki 3532 lcr hitester .",

    "this upward trend continues upto @xmath67 and thereafter shows a plateau region for @xmath68 .",
    "kelly et al @xcite have also observed a similar plateau region but in poled pmn-@xmath1pt samples .",
    "the dielectric constant again shows an upward trend leading to a peak around @xmath69 and thereafter it decreases monotonically with increasing @xmath1 .",
    "the results shown in this figure correspond to averaging over at least 5 samples for each composition .",
    "the sample to sample variation of dielectric constant for each composition was less than 1% for various pmn-@xmath1pt samples .",
    "fig.1 reveals the presence of four different regions . for correlating these regions with a corresponding change in the crystal structure as a function of composition ( x ) , we present in fig.2 the powder xrd profiles of the 200 , 220 and 222 pseudocubic reflections for various pmn-@xmath1pt composition .",
    "for the composition range @xmath70 , the 200 is a singlet , while 220 and 222 are doublets with weaker reflections occurring on the lower 2@xmath71 side .",
    "this characterizes a rhombohedral phase that is stable for @xmath72 . for @xmath73 , the width of the 200 profile increases eventually leading to an asymmetric tail on the higher 2@xmath71 side which has become quite apparent for @xmath74 and 0.30 .",
    "as shown in the next section , rietveld analysis of the xrd data reveals that the structure of the dominant phase in the composition range @xmath75 is monoclinic ( @xmath3 type ) with cm space group .",
    "the nature of the 200 profile again changes around @xmath76 leading to the appearance of a shoulder on the higher 2@xmath71 side which eventually becomes a distinct peak with increasing @xmath1 as can be seen from fig . 2 for @xmath6 .",
    "in this composition range , the dominant phase is monoclinic ( @xmath4 type ) with pm space group @xcite . for @xmath77 , the profiles shown in fig",

    "the refined structural parameters and various agreement factors are given in table1 .",
    "for compositions with @xmath81 , the 200 reflection becomes broader which can not be accounted for in terms of the rhombohedral structure for which 200 is a singlet .",

    "the anomalous broadening is absent for @xmath72 as can be seen from the excellent fit shown in the insets ( b ) to fig . 3 for the 200 profile .",
    "to determine the true symmetry in the composition range @xmath5 , we first carried out rietveld refinements using various plausible space groups i.e. , rhombohedral r3mh , monoclinic cm , monoclinic pm and orthorhombic bmm2",

    "4(a ) ] , we see that the mismatch between the observed and calculated profiles is quite prominent for 200 and 310 pseudocubic reflections , which is also confirmed by highest value of the agreement factors . thus r3mh space group is simply ruled out . for the space group pm ,",
    "the misfit between the observed and calculated profiles for the 220 and 222 pseudocubic reflections is very large . in particular , for the 222 pseudocubic profile , the observed and calculated peaks are appearing at different 2@xmath71 values ruling out the possibility of the pm phase .",
    "a similar misfit for the 220 and 222 profiles is observed for the bmm2 space group also as can be seen from fig .",

    "rietveld analysis for @xmath77 confirmed that the dominant phase of pmn-@xmath1pt for these compositions has got tetragonal structure .",
    "very good fit between the observed and calculated profiles were obtained using tetragonal p4 mm space group as can be seen from fig.8 for @xmath91 .",
    "the refined structural parameters are listed in table 4 along with the agreement factors for this composition .",
    "one often observes coexistence of neighbouring phases in the mpb region due to extrinsic factors like compositional fluctuations @xcite and intrinsic factors like a first order phase transition between the low and high temperature phases @xcite .",
    "the results of the previous section show that in the pmn-@xmath1pt system , there are three phase boundaries occurring around @xmath92 , @xmath93 and @xmath94 separating the stability fields of rhombohedral and cm , cm and pm , and pm and tetragonal phases , respectively . in order to see",
    "if further improvements in the agreement factors can result from a consideration of the coexistence of a minority neighbouring phase , we carried out rietveld refinements for the composition ranges @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath95 using various plausible coexisting phases .",
    "it was found that in the composition range @xmath5 , consideration of a minority rhombohedral phase led to higher agreement factors while minority monoclinic pm phase decreased the agreement factors .",
    "the fits between observed and calculated profiles have improved for the ( cm + pm ) model as can be seen from a comparison of fig . 4 ( e ) with fig .",
    "similarly , for the composition range @xmath6 , consideration of a minority tetragonal phase decreased the agreement factors whereas the minority cm phase increased the agreement factors .",
    "the presence of minority tetragonal phase improves the fit , especially on the lower 2@xmath71 side of the 200 pseudocubic profile , as can be seen from a comparison of fig.6 ( c ) with 6(d ) .",
    "further , monoclinic pm phase was found to coexist as a minority phase in the tetragonal region @xmath95 in agreement with the results of ref .",
    "the molar fractions of the minority and majority phases obtained by rietveld refinement are plotted in fig.9 as a function of pt content ( x ) .",
    "it is evident from this figure that pure r3 m phase exists for @xmath96 .",
    "for @xmath97 , the structure corresponds to that of pure cm phase .",
    "on increasing the pt content ( x ) , the cm phase fraction decreases while the fraction of minority pm phase increases.however , on crossing the cm - pm phase boundary at @xmath98 , the fraction of the pm phase increases abruptly . for @xmath76 ,",
    "the structure corresponds to pure pm phase . on increasing @xmath1",
    "further ( @xmath99 ) , the fraction of the majority pm phase decreases while that of the minority p4 mm phase increases with increasing x in the composition range @xmath100 . for compositions with @xmath101 ,",
    "the p4 mm phase becomes the majority phase whose fraction increases with @xmath1 while the fraction of the minority pm phase continuously decreases .",
    "variation of lattice parameters with composition ( x ) for the majority phase is plotted in fig .",
    "10 for @xmath2 . the [ 100 ] and [ 010 ] directions of the tetragonal phase correspond to the [ 010 ] and [ 100 ] directions of the pm phase respectively .",
    "the [ 001 ] direction of the pm phase deviates slightly from [ 001 ] direction of the tetragonal phase towards the [ 100 ] direction of the pm phase giving rise to a monoclinic cell with unique b- axis .",
    "the [ 100 ] and [ 010 ] directions of the cm phase , on the otherhand , are along the @xmath102 directions of the pm and tetragonal phases .",
    "the cell parameters @xmath103 , @xmath104 of the cm phase are related to the elementary perovskite cell parameters @xmath105 , @xmath106 as : @xmath107/@xmath108 and @xmath109/@xmath108 . for the sake of easy comparison with the corresponding cell parameters of the tetragonal and pm phases , we have plotted @xmath105 and @xmath106 instead of @xmath103 , @xmath104 for the cm phase in fig.10 . in order to maintain the polarization rotation path @xcite in going from tetragonal to pm to cm phases for which @xmath110 ( @xmath111 ) , @xmath112 ( @xmath113 ) and @xmath114 , @xmath110 , respectively , the @xmath115 axes of the pm phase become @xmath106 , @xmath116 , @xmath105 , respectively , of the cm phase .",

    "the @xmath117 and @xmath118 parameters of the pm phase are nearly independent of composition but the b- parameter increases continuously with decreasing @xmath1 .",
    "further the monoclinic angle @xmath121 decreases continuously with decreasing x in the pm phase field .",
    "the @xmath122 and @xmath123 parameters of the pm phase , which become @xmath116 , @xmath106 and @xmath105 of the cm phase , do not show any discontinuity at the pm - cm phase boundary .",

    "table 5 lists the lattice parameter values of the majority phases for all the compositions studied by us .",
    "the phase diagram of vanderbilt and cohen @xcite for an eight order expansion of the free energy predicts the stability regions of three types of monoclinic phases , @xmath16 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 , in addition to the tetragonal(t ) , rhombohedral(r ) and orthorhombic(o ) phases(see fig.11 ) .",
    "the r-@xmath16-t sequence of phase transition observed in pzt as a function of composition has been attributed to the region near @xmath124 , @xmath125 by vanderbilt and cohen .",
    "for the pmn-@xmath1pt system , we have shown that the stable phases in the composition ranges @xmath96 , @xmath75 , @xmath126 and @xmath101 correspond to r , @xmath3 , @xmath4 and t phases , respectively . in the phase diagram shown in fig.11 , the r- phase region",
    "is followed by a narrow stability region of the @xmath3 phase in broad agreement with our observations . however , as per this phase diagram , the @xmath3 and @xmath4 regions should be separated by a very thin orthorhombic ( o ) phase region . according to our rietveld analysis results , the @xmath127 phase boundary occurs around @xmath98 .",
    "interestingly , in the rietveld refinement for @xmath128 , which is near this phase boundary , we found that @xmath3 , @xmath4 and o phases give the same value of @xmath129 ( 12.92 ) but the @xmath130 is the lowest for the o phase ( @xmath130 = 12.84 , 10.04 , 9.92 for the @xmath3 , @xmath4 and o phases , respectively ) raising the possibility of the existence of the o phase in between the @xmath3 and @xmath4 phase regions .",
    "thus the phase transition sequence @xmath131 predicted by vanderbilt and cohen for @xmath132 may indeed correspond to the pmn-@xmath1pt system . obviously , the structure of the pmn-@xmath1pt system in the mpb region is much more complex as compared to that in the pzt system with a simple @xmath133 sequence of phase transitions .",
    "although vanderbilt and cohen s theory predicts that @xmath134 phase boundary to be of first order type , our rietveld analysis does not reveal any coexistence of r and @xmath3 phases .",
    "however , since the nature of the xrd profiles for the two phases are quite similar , except for the anomalous broadening of h00 and hh0 reflections for the @xmath3 phase , it may never be possible to settle the issue of coexistence of these two phases in a reliable fashion .",
    "the coexistence of @xmath4 and t phases revealed by our rietveld analysis is not expected on the basis of the vanderbilt and cohen s theory since the corresponding boundary is of second order type .",
    "this could be due to the limitations of the eight order truncation of the free energy expansion .    in the pzn-@xmath1pt system",
    ", there is some controversy about the structure of the mpb phase . according to orauttapong et al @xcite ,",
    "the sequence of phase transition in unpoled samples is r - o - t which is expected for @xmath135 in the vanderbilt and cohen s phase diagram .",
    "kiat et al have @xcite , however , shown that the structure of pzn-@xmath1pt in the mpb region for @xmath136 corresponds to the @xmath4 phase . if it is so , we suspect the existence of @xmath3 phase and possibly o phase also interposed between r and @xmath4 phases , similar to what we have observed in the present study on the pmn-@xmath1pt system .",
    "it is likely that the relaxor ferroelectric based mpb systems may have similar sequence of phase transitions .",
    "further , we suspect that the higher electromechanical response of these relaxor based mpb systems may be linked with the ease of polarization rotation in the presence of @xmath3 , @xmath4 and probably o phases in the morphotropic phase boundary region as compared to the presence of only one phase ( @xmath16 ) in the pzt system .",
