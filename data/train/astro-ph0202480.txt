    "the discovery of a diffuse background radiation in the x - ray sky dates back to the birth of x - ray astronomy : the first evidence was obtained by @xcite during the same rocket experiment which led to the discovery of sco x-1 , the first extra - solar x - ray source .",
    "later observations have demonstrated that the bulk of cosmic x - ray background ( cxb ) above energies of @xmath02 kev is of extragalactic origin , due to sources below the detection threshold .",
    "the first wide band measures of the cxb were made by heao@xmath11 ( 1977 ) : the cxb spectrum in the 2@xmath210 kev range was well described by a simple power law with photon index @xmath0 1.4 ( @xcite ) .",
    "more recently , several investigations ( asca gis@xmath3sis : @xcite , @xcite ; rosat pspc : @xcite ; sax lecs / mecs : @xcite ) have confirmed the spectral shape but have shown differences of order 30% in the normalization .",
    "@xcite showed that cosmic variance can not account for the differences among the previous measures of the cxb intensity ; such an uncertainty seriously affects the modelling and the interpretation of the cxb ( see e.g. @xcite ) . a new , reliable measure of the cxb is thus required to improve the overall understanding of its nature .",
    "+ the xmm - epic instruments ( @xcite ; @xcite ) have appropriate characteristics to study extended sources with low surface brighteness , offering an unprecedented collecting area ( @xmath4 @xmath5 ) and good spectral resolution ( 2% @ 6 kev ) over a broad energy range ( 0.2@xmath212 kev ) and a wide field of view ( @xmath0 15 arcmin radius ) .",
    "however these cameras suffer a rather high instrumental background ( non x - ray background , nxb ) .",
    "a correct characterization and subtraction of the nxb component is thus the crucial step in order to study the lowest surface brighteness source of the sky .",
    "+ in this work we deal only with the epic _ mos _ cameras ; the _ pn _ camera , having different characteristics , will require a different approach .",
    "the epic nxb can be divided into two parts : an electronic noise component , which is important only at the lower energies ( below @xmath00.3 kev ) , and a particle - induced component which dominates above 0.3 kev and is due to the interaction of particles in the orbital environment with the detectors and the structures that surround them .",
    "the particle - induced nxb is the sum of two different components :    1 .",
    "a _ flaring _ component . clouds of low - energy ( @xmath0 100 kev ) particles ( believed to be protons ) in the magnetosphere can be focused by the telescope mirrors , reaching the detectors .",
    "these unpredictable episodes cause an up to 100 times ( or even more ) increase of the quiescent background rate .",
    "data collected during these intervals are almost unusable , especially for the study of extended sources , and must be rejected with good time interval ( gti ) filtering .",
    "2 .   a _ quiescent _ component . it is mostly due to the interaction of high energy ( e @xmath6 a few mev ) particles with the detectors and the surrounding structures . to characterize the quiescent nxb",
    "we have analyzed a set of observations performed with the filter wheel in closed position : * the temporal behaviour is stable within an observation time scale ; we have hints for a secular decrease in the period covered by the dataset ( orbits 20@xmath284 ) ; * the spectrum is characterized by a flat continuum , with several fluorescence emission lines from materials in the detectors or the surrounding structures ( see fig .",
    "[ adeluca - f_fig : spec1 ] ) ; * the spatial distribution has a radially flat profile ( within 10 % ) , but al - k and si - k line emission are highly anisotropic due to an illumination effect .",
    "further closed observation are now being collected to improve the quiescent nxb characterization .",
    "a standard recipe to remove the nxb recovering the `` pure '' cxb spectrum could be sketched as follows :    1 .",
    "standard processing and event reconstruction ; 2 .",
    "rejection of hot pixels and bad columns ; 3 .",
    "gti filtering ( removing the flaring nxb component ) ; 4 .",
    "extraction of the spectrum from a selected area ; 5 .",
    "subtraction of quiescent nxb spectrum .",
    "this algorithm is indeed quite dangerous , since gti filtering possibly leaves a low level soft proton ( sp ) nxb component unrejected ; such a component could affect the cxb spectrum determination . in order to avoid this",
    ", we developed a simple diagnostic .",
    "+ since sp are focused by the mirrors , we have studied the correlation between counts extracted from the regions of the detectors which are inside ( in fov ) and outside ( out fov ) the field of view of the telescopes .",
    "we applied to the out fov event lists the same gti computed for the corresponding in fov data . for each observation we extracted the counts ( pattern 0 @xmath2 4 ) in the @xmath7 kev band ( where the cxb is negligible wrt .",
    "the nxb ) from appropriate regions : in the in fov region we rejected ccd 1 , where possibly cxb is not negligible , and we applied geometric masks to screen the brightest sources ; in both the in fov and the out fov regions we further applied geometric masks to reject the region spatially coincident with the underlying ccd 1 readout node ( au line emission ) .     + the main results are contained in figures [ adeluca - f_fig : cts ] and [ adeluca - f_fig : ratio ] .",
    "figure [ adeluca - f_fig : cts ] shows that a good correlation exists between counts in fov and out fov ; however some scatter is present , possibly associated with anomalous counts in fov .",
    "figure [ adeluca - f_fig : ratio ] shows that the ratio ( counts in fov)/(counts out fov ) strongly correlates with the count rate in fov : the cluster of points in the lower left part of the graph represent the correct behaviour , while the correlation of the scattering points with the count rate in fov is a possible demonstration of the presence of some sp contamination .     + these results can be used in two ways .",
    "first , we select the observations having a stable ratio ( in fov)/(out fov ) , within a maximum scatter of 15% , rejecting pathological cases .",
    "second , if we suppose that the contaminating component has a spectral shape similar to the quiescent nxb ( from closed observations ) , the value of the ratio ( in fov)/(out fov ) can be used to try a renormalization of the quiescent background spectrum to be subtracted , in order to have @xmath8",
    "this work is based on a set of commissioning , performance verification and gt observations selected among high galactic latitude ( @xmath9 ) pointings in order to avoid contamination by our galaxy ; we discarded magellanic clouds pointings and observations of very bright sources .",
    "the closed observations collected during the very early orbits ( @xmath10 40 ) were rejected , possibly being not fully reliable .",
    "+ we used the xmm - newton science analysis system ( xmm -sas ) v.5.0 to perform the standard processing of the raw event lists .",
    "the linearized event lists were then cleaned from hot pixels and bad columns using an ad - hoc developed procedure which uses cosmic ray iraf tasks to localize the pixels to be rejected in each ccd and xmm - sas task @xmath11 to remove them .",
    "next step was gti filtering to avoid flaring nxb intervals : we set a threshold of 0.29 cts / s in the energy range 8@xmath212 kev , rejecting also the time bins having 0 counts .",
    "the event files from closed observations were merged in a single list for each camera . + for each observation a geometric mask was created and applied to reject an eventually present bright central source . the diagnostic described in [ adeluca - f_sec : sub ]",
    "was then applied to verify the level of sp contamination . for each selected observation",
    ", we defined the best area to extract the cxb spectrum by a simple signal to noise ratio optimization ( we remember that the signal of cxb is vignetted , while the instrumental nxb is not , so the s / n decreases with increasing off - axis angles ) .",
    "the spectrum were then extracted using an ad - hoc developed task which corrects for the telescope vignetting on an event - by - event logic , using the most recent vignetting function determinations and accounting for the azimuthal modulation induced by the rga .",
    "the same routine is used to extract the nxb spectrum from the closed event list ; the region of extraction is chosen in order to coincide in detector coordinates to the one used for the corresponding observation of the sky . + for each observation a tentative `` pure '' cxb spectrum is obtained with a simple subtraction of the nxb spectrum .",
    "a second spectrum is obtained after a renormalization of the nxb spectrum according to the prescription described in sect .",
    "[ adeluca - f_sec : sub ] .",
    "the selected observations were 13 for mos1 for a total good exposure time of 200 ks and 14 for mos2 ( 210 ks ) . the cxb spectrum obtained for each observation",
    "was fitted using an absorbed power law model in the energy band 1.8 - 8 kev , setting n@xmath12 to @xmath13 @xmath5 ; the normalization was computed at 4 kev .",
    "we computed the mean values of the cxb spectrum slope and intensity for each camera by a straight @xmath14 minimization .",
    "figure [ adeluca - f_fig : lock ] shows the cxb spectrum extracted from an observation of the lockman hole field as seen by mos1 ( black ) and mos2 ( red ) ; exposure time is @xmath0 30 ks per camera , the best fit power law model is superposed .",
    "the same analysis was performed separately using the raw nxb spectrum and the renormalized one .",
    "the results are shown in table 1 .",

[ adeluca - f_sec : intro ] ) ; this means that the nxb spectrum has been properly characterized .",
    "the simple renormalization of nxb spectrum reduces by 30% the cxb intensity , but the results suggest that a more sophisticated procedure may be required .",
    "our study of the cosmic x - ray background is currently in progress . we obtained a characterization of the different nxb components for the mos cameras .",
    "we showed that the standard gti filtering to remove the flaring component possibly leaves a low - level sp nxb unrejected , and that the correlation of counts ( in fov)/(out fov ) can provide a good diagnostic to identify and evaluate this effect , allowing to reject pathological cases .",
    "we tried to correct for sp contamination by means of a simple renormalization of the quiescent nxb spectrum .",
    "the preliminary results show that the cxb spectral shape is correct , but the intensity is too high by @xmath0 30% .",
    "the renormalization approach is encouraging , but will require further study ."
