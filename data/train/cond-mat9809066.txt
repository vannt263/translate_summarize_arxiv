    "the physics of mesoscopic systems has reached its maturity within the semiconductor community over the past few years@xcite .",
    "a similar revolution is nowadays taking place in superconductivity where superconducting device miniaturization is moving forward at a fast pace@xcite . in both communities",
    "the concept of mesoscopics is directly linked to that of low - dimensionality .",
    "a system is called low - dimensional when at least one of the dimensions in which its carriers live becomes comparable to some relevant length scale intrinsically associated to bulk properties of those carriers . in semiconductors the most relevant length scale one can think of is the fermi wavelength @xmath0 . in superconductors there are two fundamental length scales .",
    "one is the penetration length @xmath1 over which an externally applied magnetic field @xmath2 is screened into the superconducting condensate .",
    "the other one is the coherence length @xmath3 which , in a simple - minded picture , can be thought of as the size of the cooper pairs and which limits the distance over which the superconducting order parameter can vary appreciably . when one of the dimensions of a semiconductor becomes comparable to @xmath0 , the other two being much larger",
    ", a two - dimensional electron gas ( 2deg ) is formed@xcite .",
    "similarly , typical superconducting thin films@xcite can have a width comparable to either @xmath1 or @xmath3 , or to both of them . if , in semiconductors , two out of the three dimensions become comparable to @xmath0 one forms a quantum wire@xcite .",
    "a thin strip@xcite can be thought of as the superconducting counterpart .",
    "when the three dimensions become comparable to either @xmath0 in semiconductors and to @xmath1 and/or @xmath3 in supercondutors one speaks of zero - dimensional systems called quantum dots@xcite and thin disks@xcite , respectively . when the dimensions of the superconducting device become much smaller than @xmath3 (",
    "as can be the case in very small metallic grains ) the very notion of superconductivity needs to be revised@xcite .",
    "the above classification , far from being unique and rigorous , only pretends to serve as a guide for the non - specialized reader .",
    "it has been known for a long time that , in addition to the well - understood type - i superconductors where @xmath4 , superconductors with @xmath5 are also possible ( high-@xmath6 materials are the most exotic example of them@xcite ) .",
    "this seemingly inocent relation between the two fundamental lengths gives rise to type - ii superconductivity which is characterized by the appearance of vortices in the superconducting condensate at values of @xmath2 lying between a lower critical field @xmath7 and an upper critical field @xmath8 .",
    "an isolated vortex extends over a distance of the order of @xmath1 and exhibits a normal core of radius of the order of @xmath3@xcite .",
    "a macroscopic number of vortices generically form a triangular lattice@xcite which presents two well - characterized regimes or states : ( i ) a dilute vortex state ( dvs ) at low fields in which @xmath1 governs the inter - vortex distance and ( ii ) a dense vortex state ( dvs ) at high fields in which the fundamental length scale is given by @xmath3 since the vortices are closely packed and their cores overlap strongly . in extreme type - ii superconductors , characterized by @xmath9 , the crossover from the dvs to",
    "the dvs takes place at rather low fields @xmath10@xcite which gives an idea of the relative importance of both regimes .",
    "the dvs has been thoroughly studied over the years in all possible low - dimensional systems , both theoretical and experimentally .",
    "many experimental techniques are sensitive to the vortex lattice in this regime , mainly due to the strong spatial modulation of the associated magnetic induction@xcite . on the theory part , vortices in the dvs can be treated as classical , logarithmically - interacting , point - like particles which renders the calculation of the vortex structure free energy rather feasible in many different geometries@xcite .",
    "by contrast , the structure of the dvs in nanostructures is difficult to unveil , partially due to the invisibility of this state to the usual experimental techniques and to the difficulty in minimizing the free energy associated to this highly compacted vortex state when interfaces are present .",
    "motivated by very recent advances in transport@xcite and magnetometry techniques@xcite , which we review in sec .",
    "ii , we focus in this work on the theoretical study of the structural and magnetic properties of the dvs in superconducting thin disks or quantum dots . in sec .",
    "iii we show how to do this within the traditional framework of the ginzburg - landau functional in a rather analytical fashion . finally , in sec .",
    "iv we present our conclusions .",
    "one the most remarkable achievements in low - dimensional semiconductor physics has been the fabrication of the quantum dot or single - electron transistor where the electrons travel through the system one at a time and where the number of them present in the device can be tuned at will even down to a single electron@xcite .",
    "these systems have been also given the name of artificial atoms since their generic properties are determined by both the quantum confinement and the interaction among the electrons much the same as in real atoms .",
    "many analogies can be drawn between these artificial atoms and superconducting mesoscopic disks in perpendicular magnetic fields .",
    "cooper pairs in disks can also experience the effects of quantum confinement and this becomes visible in the superconducting - normal phase boundary@xcite .",
    "as far as the interaction is concerned the role of the electron is now played to some extent , not by the cooper pair , but by another fundamental entity : the vortex .",
    "when the dimensions of the disk are comparable to @xmath1 in the dvs or to @xmath3 in the dvs only few vortices can coexist in the disk .",
    "in contrast to the usual triangular arrangement in bulk , complex and unique vortex structures are expected to occur due to the competition between the geometrical confinement and the vortex - vortex interaction .",
    "transport experiments contributed in a decisive way to unveil the electronic structure of artificial atoms@xcite .",
    "similarly , conductance measurements@xcite in individual mesoscopic disks gave us the first experimental evidence of the structure of the order parameter in these systems .",
    "based on the onset of the disk resistance , oscillations of the critical temperature @xmath6 as a function of the external magnetic field were measured and correctly accounted for by the quantization of the angular momentum @xmath11 of the cooper pair wavefunction . in more traditional words , they were observing transitions between giant vortex states with a different number @xmath11 of fluxoids .",
    "these oscillations were clearly reminiscent of those observed in the famous little - parks experiment@xcite .",
    "transport measurements are necessarily bound to give only information about the critical phase boundaries since they are based on measuring the resistance of the non - fully superconducting state of the disk .",
    "hall magnetometry@xcite , on the other hand , is revealing itself as a powerful tool for obtaining information of the order parameter away from the supercondutor - normal phase boundary .",
    "thin superconducting al disks are placed on top of a series of typical hall probes created in a 2deg . in the ballistic regime",
    "the hall resistance is directly proportional to the average value of the magnetic field through the junction which , in turn , is determined by the magnetic state of the disk lying right above the junction .",
    "magnetization ( @xmath12 ) curves for different disk sizes can thus be obtained to exhibit a variety of unexpected phase transitions .",
    "for very small disks a first - order transition at a critical @xmath13 , which is what one expects for a type - i superconductor as al , is absent . for larger sizes",
    "this transition appears , but , on increasing further the disk radius the familiar second - order phase transition for a type - ii superconductor , namely , an steady decrease of the magnetization beyond a certain critical @xmath7 , becomes notorious . on top of this steady decrease ,",
    "the magnetization exhibits many jumps corresponding to first - order transitions which present an irregular and decreasing height as a function of @xmath2 .",
    "all this seems to indicate that the quantum confinement is also patent in this experiment and that the al disks are behaving like type - ii superconductors rather than type - i , possibly due to the expected enhancement of the effective magnetic penetration length in such a geometry .    in the next section",
    "we show how many of these unexpected features can be obtained and explained within the traditional , phenomenological ginzburg - landau theory .",
    "the theoretical analysis of the peculiar supercondutor - normal phase boundary measured in ref . does not present any difficulty since it simply implies solving the linearized ginzburg - landau equations@xcite .",
    "the theoretical efforts to calculate the properties of the superconducting condensate in a disk well into the superconducting phase have been mostly restricted to the dvs@xcite .",
    "as far as the dvs is concerned , recent work is being done in the direction of solving numerically the ginzburg - landau equations either under the simplifying assumption of an order parameter with a well - defined @xmath11@xcite or without any symmetry restrictions@xcite . for type - ii disks , the assumption of an order parameter with axial symmetry ( well - defined @xmath11 ) does not hold .",
    "more precisely , it is only expected to hold in the meissner state , which is associated to an @xmath14 order parameter , and above @xmath8@xcite where , close to the surface of the disk , the superconductivity can survive up to a higher critical field @xmath15@xcite .",
    "this surface superconductivity is referred to as a condensed state of vortices or giant vortex@xcite . for @xmath16",
    "it was argued@xcite and recently shown in numerical simulations@xcite that the order parameter can form complex structures of single - fluxoid vortices , i.e. , a  budding \" abrikosov lattice . from our more analytic standpoint",
    "the appearance of these structures necessarily implies an order parameter without a well - defined angular momentum @xmath11 .",
    "recent work in which this condition is explicitly taken into account has been presented in ref .   and also in ref .  .",
    "part of the results presented here have already appeared in ref .   .",

    "before proceeding any further we must stress a not fully appreciated fact : even for small values of @xmath26 ( @xmath27 ) , the magnetic induction is weakly varying in space down to fairly low fields ( @xmath28)@xcite .",
    "thus , it is a very good approximation to consider a uniform magnetic induction [ @xmath29 down to @xmath28 and to expand the order parameter in the lowest landau level ( lll ) : @xmath30 in this expansion @xmath31 are complex coefficients and @xmath32 are normalized eigenfunctions of the kinetic energy operator in eq .",
    "( [ g - l ] ) plus the boundary conditions of zero current through the surface of the disk@xcite .",
    "( we only consider disk thicknesses smaller than the coherence length so that the order parameter can be taken constant in the direction of the field . ) strictly speaking , these eigenfunctions are not lll eigenstates .",
    "however , their radial part @xmath33 , which may be found numerically , is nodeless and coincides with the radial function of the symmetric lll eigenfunctions for small @xmath11 .",
    "figure [ bands_nij ] shows the cooper pair band structure , i.e. , the corresponding eigenvalues @xmath34 at different values of the external field for a disk of radius @xmath35 and @xmath36 ( this implies @xmath37 ) .",
    "the horizontal lines represent @xmath38 which can be thought of as the chemical potential for the cooper pairs . the formation of the dispersionless lll in the center of the disk as the magnetic length @xmath39 becomes smaller than @xmath40 is clearly visible .",
    "the bending of the band close to the surface is a consequence of the boundary condition and allows the nucleation of surface superconductivity ( or the formation of a giant vortex ) even when the bulk remains in the normal state ( @xmath41 ) .",
    "the expansion ( [ expansion ] ) captures both the simplicity of the macrovortex ( above @xmath8 ) when only one @xmath42 is expected to be different from zero and the full complexity of the order parameter ( below @xmath8 ) when several components or harmonics must participate .",
    "direct substitution of such an expansion into eq .",
    "[ g - l ] and subsequent numerical minimization of the resulting expression is a daunting task bound to fail due to the large number of unknown variables involved . instead , it is preferable to consider expansions in restricted sets @xmath43 of few @xmath44 components where @xmath45 .",

    "the terms proportional to @xmath24 contain the condensation and kinetic energy of the cooper pairs .",
    "all the other terms , which are proportional to @xmath54 , account for the `` interaction '' between cooper pairs .",
    "there appear four types of these terms : ( i ) those proportional to @xmath55 , reflecting the interaction between cooper pairs occupying the same quantum state @xmath11 , ( ii ) those proportional to @xmath56 , reflecting the interaction between cooper pairs occupying different quantum states , and ( iii ) the ones proportional to @xmath57 and proportional to @xmath58 which , along with the phases @xmath59 , are responsible for the spatial correlation between vortices and the detailed structure of the dvs ( see below ) .",
    "the non - linear dependence on @xmath53 of these integrals [ as well as that of @xmath50 ] comes from the existence of the disk surface .    in order to find the minimum gibbs free energy for a given set we have to minimize with respect to the moduli @xmath61 , the phases @xmath62 of the coefficients , and with respect to @xmath53 .",
    "the minimum - energy set of components is picked up at the end .",
    "the advantage of doing this selective minimization resides in our expectation that a small number of components will suffice to describe the order parameter for disks with radii of few coherent lengths . as illustrative and relevant examples we consider in the detail the solutions with one and two components . for @xmath63 the energy functional",
    "is invariant with respect to the phase of the only coefficient so one can minimize analytically with respect to @xmath64 to obtain @xmath65 ^ 2}{\\kappa^2 b r^2 i_l}+(b - h)^2 , \\label{1c}\\ ] ] where we have dropped the implicit @xmath53-dependences .",
    "finally , the minimal value of @xmath53 and the minimum gibbs free energy for each @xmath11 must be found numerically .",
    "the 2-component solutions @xmath66 can be dealt with in a similar way .",
    "the energy functional is invariant with respect to the phases so one can minimize analytically with respect to @xmath67 and @xmath68 to obtain @xmath69 ^ 2 i_{l_2}+ [ 1-b\\epsilon_{l_2}]^2 i_{l_1}-4[1-b\\epsilon_{l_1}][1-b\\epsilon_{l_2}]i_{l_1l_2 } } { \\kappa^2 b r^2 [ i_{l_1}i_{l_2}-4i_{l_1l_2}]}+(b - h)^2 \\label{2c}\\ ] ] and numerically with respect to @xmath53 to obtain the minimum energy for the given pair of components .",
    "the superconducting condensate looks generically like an @xmath70-vortex ring .",
    "it is important to notice that @xmath24 disappears from the final expressions ( [ 1c ] ) and ( [ 2c ] ) which leaves us with @xmath26 as the only adjustable parameter when comparing with experiments .",
    "( this is also true for the more complex cases discussed below ) . for 3-component solutions ( two vortex rings ) the energy functional is still invariant with respect to all the three phases whenever @xmath71 , and , once again , the minimization with respect to @xmath67 , @xmath68 , and @xmath72 can be done analytically . however ,",
    "if @xmath73 , the two rings have the same number of vortices and their relative angular positions come into play through the term depending on the phases .",
    "there is , however , an obvious choice for these phases : @xmath74 .",
    "this choice gives a negative contribution to the free energy which reflects a lock - in position between the vortex rings .",
    "in general , the minimum - energy solutions for disks are expected to have strongly overlapping components which invalidates any perturbative treatment of the terms that contain the phases@xcite .",
    "moreover , unlike simpler geometries@xcite , there is no direct connection between number of components in which we expand the order parameter and number of vortices .",
    "this prompts us to seek solutions through numerical minimization with respect to the moduli and @xmath53 for the 3-component cases just mentioned , and , for @xmath75 , with respect to the moduli , the phases , and @xmath53 whenever the terms involving phases are present . for the disk sizes like the ones used in the experiment of ref .   2 and 3-component solutions suffice to capture the relevant physics .",
    "figure [ mag_nij ] shows the magnetization as a function of @xmath2 for two disks with @xmath76 .",
    "the components or harmonics with significant weight corresponding to the minimum - energy order parameter at each magnetization step are also shown .",
    "for the smaller disk of radius @xmath77 we obtain a series of first - order transitions . here",
    "all the minimal solutions correspond to giant vortices which contain @xmath11 fluxoids .",
    "whenever @xmath11 changes by one the magnetization presents a ( non - quantized ) jump whose magnitude evolves _ monotonously _ with @xmath11 . for the larger @xmath78",
    "disk @xmath79 solutions appear below @xmath8 . in this case , allowing more components in the expansion of the order parameter has a fundamental effect : it splits the giant vortex into a complex vortex glass structure of many single - fluxoid vortices [ see figs .",
    "[ glass_nij](a ) to ( c ) ] .",
    "this glass structure reflects in the magnetization curves by changing the regular evolution of the magnitude of the jumps into an irregular one .",
    "whenever a vortex is added or removed from the disk the symmetry of the new vortex configuration changes which , in turn , expels the field in a different way . the total number of vortices is always given by the largest @xmath80 which does not depend on the value of @xmath11 of the other harmonics : only the internal arrangement of vortices does .",
    "there usually exist configuration switches for a given number of vortices ( i.e. , for a given @xmath80 ) , but these changes _ do not _ reflect in the magnetization ( see fig  [ mag_nij ] ) . on top of the first - order transitions the overall slope in the magnetization clearly changes at @xmath8 , i.e. , at the transition between the giant vortex and the vortex glass structures .",
    "this transition is reminiscent of the second - order transition at @xmath8 for bulk samples where @xmath12 vanishes .",
    "finally , we point out that the magnetization measured by geim et al . in ref .",
    "presents features that are in good agreement with our results despite of the fact that the disks are made out of a strong type - i material as al .",
    "it is well known that the bulk value of @xmath26 can increase in the plate geometry@xcite . to compare with the experiment",
    ", we simulate this fact by using a higher value of @xmath26 than the nominal one . in fig .",
    "[ exp_nij ] we show the data for a disk of nominal radius @xmath81 and thickness @xmath82 .",
    "we have obtained a reasonable good agreement in the number and magnitude of the jumps , and overall shape of the magnetization using @xmath83 and @xmath84 ( the dotted line is a good example ) .",
    "this is consistent with an effective penetration length longer than expected and , possibly , with a coherence length shorter than the bulk nominal one .",
    "although , due to the smallness of the disk , it is difficult to point at a second - order phase transition , the non - monotonous evolution of the magnitude of the magnetization jumps is notorious over a large range of fields which , as we have shown , is an indication of the formation of vortex glass structures . in our approximation",
    "the magnetic induction is uniform in space , but , given the good agreement with the experimental curve , this does not seem to be an important restriction .",
    "after reviewing some of the state - of - the - art experiments in mesoscopic superconductivity we have shown how to calculate the dense vortex matter structure and associated magnetization for type - ii superconducting mesoscopic disks .",
    "we have found that the magnetization exhibits generically a first - order phase transition whenever the number of vortices changes by one with @xmath2 .",
    "it also presents two well - defined regimes : a _ non - monotonous _ evolution of the magnitude of the jumps signals the presence of a vortex glass structure which is separated by a second - order phase transition at @xmath8 from a condensed state of vortices ( giant vortex ) where the magnitude of the jumps changes monotonously .",
    "we have compared our results with the hall magnetometry measurements in ref .   and claimed that the magnetization exhibits clear traces of the presence of these vortex glass states .",
