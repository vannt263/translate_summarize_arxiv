    "quantum tunneling is one of the most important phenomenon with wide range of applications in modern technology . in spite of its remarkable success in various applications , there still remains the fundamental question , namely , how much time does a particle take to traverse the barrier ?",
    "( so called tunneling time problem ) .",
    "this problem has been approached from many different viewpoints , but still there is a lack of consensus about the existence of simple expression for this time @xcite .",
    "this is due to the fact that there is no hermitian operator associated with this time .",
    "the various time scales proposed in the literature are based on different operational definitions and physical interpretations .",
    "they may represent different complimentary aspect of tunneling process .",
    "some of them include dwell time , larmor time , complex times , buttiker- landauer times , sojourn times @xcite , time scale based on bohm s view @xcite , phase delay time , etc .    in our present work",
    "we concentrate mainly on the concept of wigner phase delay time .",
    "this time is usually taken as the difference between the time at which the peak of the transmitted packet leaves the barrier and the time at which the peak of the incident gaussian wave packet arrives at the barrier . within the stationary phase approximation the phase time can be calculated from the energy derivative of the ` phase shift ' in the transmitted or reflected amplitudes .",
    "this phase delay time is also related to various physical quantities such as partial density of states @xcite . in the case of a quantum tunneling",
    "it has been shown that in the opaque barrier limit the phase delay time does not depend on the barrier width .",
    "this phenomenon is called as the hartman effect .",
    "this implies that for sufficiently large barriers the effective velocity of the particle can become arbitrarily large , even larger than the speed of light in the vacuum ( superluminal ) .",
    "this may be further regarded as the evidence of the fact that quantum systems seem to behave as non - local .",
    "experiments have clearly demonstrated @xcite that  tunneling photons \" travel with superluminal group velocities .",
    "their measured tunneling time is practically obtained by comparing the two peaks of the incident and transmitted wave packets .",
    "it is important to note that these observations do not violate ` einstein causality ' , i.e. , the signal velocity or the information transfer velocity is always bounded by the velocity of light .",
    "theoretically hartman effect has been generalized to different cases including double barriers , various geometric structures and in the presence of aharonov - bohm flux .",
    "mystery surrounding this effect has also been addressed recently by winful .",
    "he argues that the short time delay observed is due to energy storage and release and has nothing to do with propagation .",
    "since the stored energy or the probability density in the evanescent field decreases exponentially with the distance in the barrier , after certain decay distance it does not matter how much more length the barrier has .",
    "for details we refer to @xcite .    in our present work",
    "we study the above mentioned effect in a simple quantum system consisting of a circular loop connected to a single wire of semi - infinite length as shown in fig  [ system ] .",
    "in addition we impose aharonov - bohm flux through the loop .",
    "we also focus on the following situation .",
    "there is a potential barrier ( or barriers ) inside the loop , while the potential in the connecting lead is set to zero .",
    "the incident energy of the free propagating electron @xmath0 in the semi - infinite wire is less than the barrier potential height @xmath1 .",
    "the impinging electron on the loop in the sub barrier region travels as an evanescent wave in the loop before being reflected .",
    "we analyze the phase time of the reflected wave .",
    "we show that this phase time in the opaque barrier regime becomes independent of the length of the circumference of the ring and the magnitude of the aharonov - bohm flux , thereby generalizing the hartman effect beyond one dimension and in the presence of magnetic flux .",
    "we have also extended this effect by including an additional potential well in the circular ring .",
    "interestingly the saturated delay time becomes independent of the length of the potential well ( in the large length limit ) in the off resonant case .",
    "the potential well can support many resonant states .",
    "this result is regarded as a  space collapse or space destroyer \" @xcite . even though in the potential well inside the loop electronic wave can travel as a free propagating mode ( and not as a evanescent mode ) , surprisingly the saturated delay time is independent of the length of the well ( as if it does not count ) .    in the sections to follow",
    "we first give the description of the theoretical treatment .",
    "for this we make use of the quantum waveguide approach well known for the electronic transport problems .",
    "the classical relativistic helmholtz equation for the electromagnetic wave propagation is formally identical to non relativistic stationary schrdinger equation .",
    "hence conclusions obtained using quantum tunneling theory are equally valid in the case of electromagnetic phenomenon ( photon tunneling ) . in the later sections",
    "we will discuss our results and conclusions .",
    "we approach this scattering problem using the quantum wave guide theory  @xcite . in the stationary case the incoming particles",
    "are represented by a plane wave @xmath2 of unit amplitude .",
    "the effective mass of the propagating particle is @xmath3 and the energy is @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the wave vector corresponding to the free particle .",
    "the wave function in different regions ( which are solutions of the schrdinger equation ) in the absence of magnetic flux are given below @xmath6 with @xmath5 being the wavevector of electrons in the lead and in the intermediate free space between two barriers inside the ring .",
    "@xmath7 and @xmath8 are the wavevector respectively for propagating electrons in the barriers of strength @xmath9 and @xmath10 inside the ring .",
    "the origin of the co - ordinates of @xmath11 and @xmath12 is assumed to be at @xmath13 and that for @xmath14 and @xmath15 are at @xmath16 and @xmath17 respectively . at @xmath16 , @xmath18 , at @xmath17 , @xmath19 and at @xmath13 , @xmath20 , where @xmath21 and @xmath22 are the length of the two barriers separated by a well region of length @xmath23 inside the ring",
    ". total circumference of the ring is @xmath24 .",
    "we use griffith s boundary conditions  @xcite @xmath25 and @xmath26 at the junction @xmath13 .",
    "all the derivatives are taken either outward or inward from the junction  @xcite .",
    "similar boundary conditions are held at @xmath16 and @xmath17 _ i.e. _ @xmath27    we choose a gauge for the vector potential in which the magnetic field appears only in the boundary conditions rather than explicitly in the hamiltonian  @xcite .",
    "thus the electrons propagating clockwise and anticlockwise will pick up opposite phases .",
    "the electrons propagating in the clockwise direction from @xmath13 will pick up phases @xmath28 at @xmath16 , @xmath29 at @xmath17 and @xmath30 at @xmath13 after traversing once along the loop .",
    "the total phase around the loop is @xmath31 , where @xmath32 and @xmath33 are the magnetic flux and flux quantum , respectively .",
