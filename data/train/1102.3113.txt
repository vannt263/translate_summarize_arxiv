    "recently , an anomalous tunneling phenomenon has been extensively discussed in the field of bose gas superfluids  @xcite . in this phenomenon , the bogoliubov mode tunnels through a barrier without reflection in the low energy limit .",

    "the anomalous tunneling phenomenon occurs even in the presence of a finite superflow , except in the critical supercurrent state . in the critical current state ,",
    "tunneling of the bogoliubov mode is accompanied by a finite reflection in the low energy limit  @xcite . since the bogoliubov mode is a collective nambu - goldstone ( ng ) mode associated with",
    "the broken u(1 ) gauge symmetry in superfluid phases , the anomalous tunneling phenomenon may be considered as a fundamental property that bose superfluids generally have .    while the bogoliubov mode dominates over low energy properties of a ( spinless ) scalar bose ",

    "it is an interesting problem whether or not such spin wave modes also exhibit anomalous tunneling behaviors as in the case of the bogoliubov mode . in particular , in the ferromagnetic spinor bec  @xcite , in addition to the ordinary bogoliubov mode , there is a gapless transverse spin wave mode with a quadratic dispersion @xmath5 ( where @xmath6 is the momentum of the spin wave ) , which is similar to the magnon in a ferromagnet  @xcite .",

    "this fact implies that the perfect transmission ( or the anomalous tunneling phenomenon ) of a nambu - goldstone mode is strongly affected by the barrier that breaks the symmetry related to the origin of the mode . to see this in a simple manner",

    "to summarize , we have investigated tunneling properties of the collective bogoliubov mode , as well as spin wave excitations ( transverse spin wave and quadrupolar mode ) , in the ferromagnetic state of a spin-1 spinor bose - einstein condensate . within the framework of the mean - field theory at @xmath0 , we have calculated the tunneling probability across a barrier potential of each mode as a function of the incident momentum , to see whether or not anomalous tunneling phenomenon occurs .",
    "we showed that , as in the case of a scalar bec , the bogoliubov mode also exhibits the anomalous tunneling phenomenon in the ferromagnetic state of a spin-1 spinor bec in the presence of a barrier that couples only to local density .",
    "namely , perfect transmission always occurs in the low energy limit , even in the presence of supercurrent , unless the superflow is in the critical supercurrent state . in the critical supercurrent state ,",
    "tunneling of the bogoliubov mode is accompanied by a finite reflection .",
    "all these results are the same as the case of a scalar bec .    the transverse spin wave , which is the other nambu - goldstone mode associated with the broken spin rotational symmetry , also shows the anomalous tunneling phenomenon in the presence of a barrier that couples only to local density .",
    "however , while this phenomenon occurs in the long wavelength limit in the case of the bogoliubov mode , perfect transmission of the transverse spin wave is realized when the momentum of the spin wave coincides with that of supercurrent .",
    "in addition , this phenomenon still occurs in the critical supercurrent state , which is also to be contrasted with the case of the bogoliubov mode . on the other hand , when perfect transmission occurs , the wave function of the transverse spin wave has the same form as the condensate wave function in the current carrying state .",
    "this property is shared with the bogoliubov mode in the long wavelength limit .",
    "this result is important in the context described below .",
    "the perfect transmission of the transverse spin wave in the current - flowing state provides much simpler example of anomalous tunneling , compared to earlier cases . in the earlier cases ( the bogoliubov mode  @xcite , the transverse spin wave in the absence of supercurrent  @xcite ) , the anomalous tunneling always occurs in the limit where the wavenumber @xmath2 approaches zero . in the present case ,",
    "on the other hand , anomalous tunneling occurs at a finite wavenumber .",
    "when we discuss the tunneling problem in the limit @xmath163 , we have to calculate the transmission rate for finite @xmath2 first , and then consider the limit @xmath163 .",
    "this limiting procedure is unnecessary when we consider the tunneling problem of particles with finite wavenumber .",
    "this is the reason why the proof of perfect transmission for @xmath240 presented in sec .",
    "ii is simpler than those for @xmath100 given in @xcite and appendix a in the present paper . owing to this simplicity of the perfect transmission of the spin wave in the current - flowing state",
    ", we can prove the perfect transmission of the spin wave for a general potential barrier and @xmath240 as a direct consequence of the coincidence of wave functions between the spin wave and the flowing condensate .",
    "we have also examined tunneling properties of the quadrupolar mode .",
    "this collective mode has a finite excitation gap , and is not the nambu - goldstone mode .",
    "in contrast to the above two nambu - goldstone modes , the quadrupolar mode does not exhibit the anomalous tunneling behavior .",
    "the tunneling properties of excitations are determined by the properties of potentials as well as characters of excitations .",
    "when a barrier potential locally destroys a symmetry that is spontaneously broken in the spinor bec , the anomalous tunneling phenomenon of the corresponding nambu - goldstone mode disappears . indeed ,",
    "perfect transmission of the transverse spin wave does not occur , when the barrier potential depends on spin and locally breaks spin rotation symmetry .",
    "similarly , perfect transmission of the bogoliubov mode does not occur either , when the barrier potential depends on the local phase of the condensate wave function and locally breaks u(1 ) gauge symmetry .",
    "the presence of the symmetry breaking potential inhibits the wave function of a nambu - goldstone mode from coinciding with the condensate wave function .",
    "these results indicate that the symmetry that the barrier potential possesses is crucial for the anomalous tunneling phenomena of nambu - goldstone modes .",
    "we infer that anomalous tunneling occurs in a nambu - goldstone mode only in the presence of symmetry - preserving barrier potentials .",
    "this result shown in sec .",
    "[ secv ] is significant because this is the first study on relation between anomalous tunneling and symmetry - property of potentials .",
    "the present paper has treated the tunneling problem for all the three excitations separately .",
    "it seems to be difficult to create an excitation as a single mode from the spin-1 bec to examine tunneling properties of excitations experimentally ; but , this difficulty can be overcome by making use of the bragg scattering and a strong magnetic field  @xcite .",
    "the bragg scattering can selectively create an excitation with a certain momentum @xmath6 and a certain energy @xmath128 .",
    "when energies of the three collective excitations at small momenta are well separated from each other by using the zeeman effect under a strong magnetic field , one would be able to selectively create one of the three excitations as a single mode .",
    "since low energy properties of the ferromagnetic spinor bec are dominated by the three collective excitations , our results would be useful for understanding dynamical properties in this superfluid phase .    in this paper",

    "we found that the anomalous tunneling phenomenon of the spin wave modes occurs unless the system is in the critical current state .",
