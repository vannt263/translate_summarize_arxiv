    "the existence of the charged black hole described by the reissner - nordstrom solution reflects the fact that a black hole can possess a massless monopole vector ( electromagnetic ) field .",
    "it gets rid of all higher multipoles through radiative processes dominated by quasinormal ringing at intermediately late times and by power - low or exponential tails at asymptotically late times .    since bekenstein s paper @xcite , it is well - known that a black hole can not possess even a monopole massive vector field",
    ". therefore the black hole has to radiate away the massive vector field with some quasinormal frequencies governing this radiation .",
    "nevertheless , the massive vector quasinormal modes of a schwarzschild black hole were not studied so far , and , as we shall show in this paper , the problem is qualitively different from that for a massive scalar field , leading to quite unusual quasinormal behaviour .",
    "first of all , let us briefly review what we know about massive scalar and massless vector field perturbations .",
    "the massless vector perturbations of the schwarzschild background was considered for the first time in @xcite . there",
    "the maxwell field perturbations were reduced to a single wave - like equation for some gauge invariant function @xmath4 , @xmath5 here @xmath6 is the black hole mass and @xmath7 is the multipole number .",
    "note , that this equation is valid only for @xmath8 , while for @xmath9 ( monopole , or spherically symmetrical perturbations ) the maxwell equations in schwarzschild background do not exhibit dynamical degrees of freedom .",
    "this signifies about existence of non - radiative electromagnetic monopole hair , i.e. about existence of a black hole charge .",
    "the quasinormal modes and late time behaviour stipulated by this effective potential were found in a lot of papers ( see recent papers @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and references therein ) , and are well - studied . in particular , we know that massless vector quasinormal modes @xcite are qualitatively similar to those of scalar or gravitational fields @xcite , except for limit of asymptotically high overtones : @xmath10 approaches zero for vector field and is @xmath11 for scalar and gravitational fields @xcite .    on the other hand , the massive term corrects the effective potential , and for simplest case of scalar field it leads to the wave - equation @xmath12 here one can take @xmath13 and re - cover the massless case .",
    "the corresponding quasinormal frequencies were found in @xcite for massless and in @xcite for massive case .",
    "massive scalar quasinormal modes proved to show quite peculiar properties .",
    "thus when one increases the mass of the field @xmath0 , the damping rates of the qn modes decrease strongly , so that existence of infinitely long living modes called `` quasi - resonances '' @xcite becomes possible .",
    "when increasing @xmath0 , lower overtones , one by one , transform into `` quasi - resonances '' , while all the other higher modes remain `` ordinary '' , i.e. damped @xcite .",
    "( for this to happen one needs to deal with relatively large values of @xmath0 , so that in a more realistic picture considering backreaction of the scalar particle onto a black hole , existence of such quasi - resonances is questionable . ) .",
    "on the other hand , in 1992 coleman , preskill and wilczek stated that the classical vector monopole field is determined by the mass of the field itself , and not by the mass of the black hole @xcite .",
    "this stimulated the consideration of the late - time behaviour of the monopole massive vector field in the schwarzschild background in @xcite where the suggestion of @xcite was supported by asymptotic treatment .",
    "one of the earliest papers dealing with massive vector field perturbations was that by galtsov , pomerantseva and chizhov @xcite , where it was shown that massive particles around black holes have quasi - stationary states with hydrogen - like spectrum . that was different from behaviour of the proca field in coulomb potential , where bounded states can not be formed @xcite . in the paper @xcite",
    ", the perturbations equations were deduced for the first time , yet , as the system of equations for general value of multipole number @xmath7 can not be decoupled , the solution was obtained in the region far from a black hole @xcite . on the contrary in @xcite ,",
    "the perturbation equations were reduced to a single wave - like equation , but only for the case of spherically symmetrical perturbations and zero cosmological constant .",
    "we are interested now to know what will happen with massive vector perturbations in a black hole background . in this case",
    "the situation is qualitatively different from the known massless vector or massive scalar cases .",
    "first , the wave equation for monopole massive vector perturbations can not be reduced to that one for the massless vector field , just because the massless vector field does not have radiative monopole .",
    "another distinctive feature : the corresponding effective potential is not positive definite everywhere outside the black hole , so one must check the stability of perturbations .",
    "the most unexpected feature we have found in the present paper is that when increasing the mass of the field , the lowest frequency and the higher overtones behaviour is qualitatively different : the fundamental mode decreases its damping rate what results in appearance of infinitely long living modes , while , on the contrary , all higher modes decrease their oscillation frequencies , leading to appearance of almost non - oscillatory damping modes .",
    "the paper is organised as follows : in sec i we deduce the wave equation for perturbations of the proca field in the background of schwarzschild , schwarzschild - de sitter and schwarzschild - anti - de sitter black holes . in sec .",
    "ii the stability of monopole perturbations is proved .",
    "iii deals with quasinormal spectrum for massive vector perturbations of schwarzschild , and schwarzschild - anti - de sitter backgrounds , including obtaining of the asymptotically high overtone limit . in the conclusion",
    "we give a summary of obtained results .",
    "we shall consider here the schwarzschild black hole solution with a @xmath14 - term , i.e. schwarzschild , schwarzschild - de sitter and schwarzschild - anti- de sitter backgrounds in which the massive vector field propagates .",
    "the black hole metric is given by @xmath15 where @xmath16    the vector field is described by a four - potential @xmath17 , which is supposed to interact with gravitational field minimally , i.e. the field equations are generally - covariant analogs of the vector field equations in minkowskian space - time .",
    "therefore , the proca equations @xmath18 in curved space - time , read @xmath19    from here and on the coordinates @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , and @xmath23 will be designated as @xmath24,@xmath25 , @xmath26 , and @xmath27 respectively .    with respect to angular coordinates we imply adequate expansion into spherical harmonics .",
    "then , the field perturbations can be described by four scalar functions of the radial coordinate and time @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 , and @xmath31 : @xmath32 @xmath33 @xmath34 @xmath35    considering eq .",
    "( 5 ) with @xmath36 , @xmath25 and substituting eqs . ( 6)-(9 ) we arrive at the following equations :    @xmath37    @xmath38    where @xmath39 . here",
    "we got rid of the function @xmath40 , so that the final perturbation dynamic can be described by the three independent functions of @xmath21 and @xmath20 .",
    "the other two equations of ( 5 ) , corresponding to @xmath41 , @xmath27 , result in a pair of equations with both even and odd spherical harmonics . let us differentiate ( 10 ) with respect to @xmath21 and ( 11 ) with respect to @xmath20 . then , consider the particular case of spherically symmetrical perturbations . thereby taking @xmath42 , i.e. , implicitly",
    ", discarding all terms containing derivatives with respect to angular variables , and introducing the new function @xmath43 we obtain the following equation : @xmath44 @xmath45    assuming @xmath46 , after introducing of @xmath47 and using of the tortoise coordinate @xmath48 : @xmath49 , we get the radial wave - like equation :    @xmath50    with the effective potential @xmath51 when the @xmath14-term vanishes , the wave equation ( 14 , 15 ) reduces to that obtained recently in @xcite with the help of the newman - penrose tetrad formalism .",
    "@xmath52 corresponds to asymptotically de - sitter ( anti - de sitter ) solutions .    yet , for perturbations of general multi - polarity , all four equations of ( 5 ) can be reduced to the matrix equation for three scalar functions @xmath53 , @xmath54 , @xmath55 and the matrix @xmath56 can not be diagonalized by the @xmath21-independent transformations of the vector @xmath53 , i.e. the set of equations ( 16 ) can not be reduced to the wave - like equations ( 14 ) .",
    "even though we are limited now by spherically symmetric perturbations , one can hope it is possible to judge about stability of the system against massive vector field perturbations , because usually , if a system is stable against monopole perturbations , it is stable also against higher multipole perturbations . the effective potential for different values of field mass @xmath0 is given on fig . 1 . , 2 and 3 for schwarzschild , schwarzschild - de sitter and schwarzschild- anti - de sitter black holes respectively .",
    "to prove the stability of perturbations governed by the wave equation ( 14 , 15 ) we need to show , that the corresponding differential operator @xmath57 is positive self - adjoint operator in the hilbert space of square integrable functions of @xmath48 , so that there is no normalizable growing solution .",
    "this provides that all found quasinormal modes are damped .",
    "for massless scalar , vector and gravitational perturbations ( as well as for a massive scalar perturbations ) of a four - dimensional schwarzschild , schwarzschild - de sitter , and schwarzschild - anti - de sitter black holes , the effective potential is manifestly positive , and therefore the positivity of the self - adjoint operator is evident . as a result ,",
    "the corresponding quasinormal modes for these cases are damped . yet , for massive vector perturbations , as we see from fig .",
    ", 2 and 3 , the effective potential has negative values near the event horizon . nevertheless , the effective potential is bounded from below and we can apply here the method used in @xcite , which consists in extension of @xmath58 to a semi - bounded self - adjoint operator in such a way , that the lower bound of the spectrum of the extension does not change . for this to perform ,",
    "let us , following @xcite , introduce the operator @xmath59 and we know that @xcite : @xmath60 where @xmath61 thus , we need to find the function @xmath62 which would make the effective potential @xmath63 positive .",
    "after investigation of the form of the effective potential one can see that there is a set of functions @xmath62 satisfying this requirement .",
    "for instance , the function @xmath64 creates the following potential : @xmath65 using mathematica , one can show that this potential is positive outside the event horizon of a black hole .",
    "thus a symmetric operator @xmath58 is positive definite outside the black hole for positive and zero cosmological constant , and so is the self - adjoint extension . yet , for the case of asymptotically anti - de sitter black hole , the range of the tortoise coordinate is incomplete . at the same time , since the effective potential is divergent at spatial infinity the dirichlet boundary conditions @xmath66 is physically motivated .",
    "then , the boundary term in ( 19 ) does not contribute to the spectrum , and we obtain the positive self - adjoint extension of @xmath58 .",
    "thereby , we have proved that the schwarzschild , schwarzschild - de sitter and schwarzschild - anti- de sitter space - times are stable against monopole massive vector field perturbations .",
    "it means that there are no growing quasinormal modes in the spectra of these perturbations . in the next section",
    "we shall compute the quasinormal modes for the asymptotically flat and ads cases , and show , that all found modes are damped implying the stability .",
    "we shall be restricted here by consideration of quasinormal modes of asymptotically flat and ads black holes as those which are most physically motivated .",
    "qnms of asymptotically flat black holes may be observed by future generation of gravitational antennas @xcite , while asymptotically ads black holes have direct interpretation in the conformal field theory in the regime of strong coupling @xcite .",
    "let us start with asymptotically flat black holes .",
    "the effective potential ( 17 ) approaches constant values both at event horizon and spatial infinity in this case .",
    "therefore the standard qn boundary conditions @xmath67 ( @xmath68 ) are reasonable . more accurately , taking into consideration the sub - dominant asymptotic term at infinity , the qn boundary conditions are @xmath69 @xmath70 note that the sign of @xmath71 is to be chosen to remain in the same complex plane quadrant as @xmath72 .    following the leaver method",
    ", one can eliminate the singular factor from @xmath73 , satisfying the in - going wave boundary condition at the event horizon and ( 23 ) at infinity , and expand the remaining part into the frobenius series that are convergent in the region between the event horizon and the infinity ( see @xcite for more details ) .",
    "the frobenius series are : @xmath74 @xmath75    substituting ( 24 ) into ( 14 ) we find a three - term recurrence relation : @xmath76    then , using algebra of continued fractions we can find the quasinormal modes as those values of @xmath72 for which @xmath77 @xmath78 as this procedure is described in many papers ( see for instance @xcite and references therein ) , we shall not describe it here in details , and , go over directly to the obtained results .",

    "note , that as we consider a vector field minimally interacting with gravity , i.e. back reaction of the vector field on the metric is not considered we can not consider large values of @xmath0/@xmath6 .",
    "we see from table i that as the overtone number is increasing the difference between qnms for different values of @xmath0 is decreasing and becomes small even at around tenth overtone .",
    "thus , one can conclude ( and we check this by computing high overtones ) , that high overtone behaviour does not depend on the mass term @xmath0 coming into the effective potential ( 15 ) , that is in agreement with previous study of high overtones for massive scalar field in @xcite .",
    "let us remind , that asymptotic limit of the qn spectrum for massive vector field does not reduce to that for the massless case , because the effective potential ( 15 ) , does not have physical meaning in the limit @xmath13 .",
    "the most unexpected feature of the quasinormal spectrum we found ( see fig .",
    "4 ) is that the fundamental mode shows correlation with mass of the field @xmath0 , totally different from all the remaining higher overtones .",
    "thus , as the mass @xmath0 is increasing , the real part of the fundamental mode is increasing , while the imaginary part is falling off to tiny values , leading thereby to existence of the so - called quasi - resonant modes , i.e. of infinitely long living oscillating modes @xcite , @xcite . on contrary , the second , third ( see fig .",
    "4 ) and higher overtones have their real part decreasing to tiny values , and , the imaginary part is growing when the mass @xmath0 is growing .",
    "thus higher overtones can lead to existence of almost pure imaginary modes which just damp without oscillations .",
    "we do not know examples of such a different behaviour between the fundamental mode and higher overtones , for massless fields of any spin @xcite or for massive scalar field @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , at least for asymptotically flat or de sitter black holes .",
    "the infinitely long living modes can exist for massive scalar field perturbations @xcite , but for _ all _ modes @xcite , not only for the fundamental one .",
    "note however , that for massless vector perturbations of asymptotically ads black holes under dirichlet boundary conditions , the fundamental mode is pure imaginary ( see for instance @xcite and references therein ) , what represents the hydrodynamic mode in the dual conformal field theory @xcite .",
    "so , the qualitative difference between fundamental and higher overtones is not absolutely new phenomena , yet , completely unexpected for asymptotically flat space - times .",
    "note also , that despite the fact that we have two tendencies : approaching @xmath1 the constant value @xmath82 , when @xmath83 is growing , and at the same time approaching zero , when @xmath0 is growing , there is no contradiction : to approach the limit @xmath82 , real part of @xmath72 should increase again after some certain @xmath84 @xcite .",
    "we can observe it on the table i. ( third column ) , where we can observe the `` local maximum '' of @xmath1 at @xmath85 .",
    "the modes in table i and fig .",
    "4 were found with the help of the above described frobenius technique . for lower overtones",
    ", one can use , alternatively , the wkb approach suggested in @xcite and consequently developed to 3th @xcite and 6th @xcite wkb orders beyond the eikonal approximation .",
    "the wkb formula has been used recently in a lot of papers @xcite and comparison with accurate numerical data in many cases @xcite shows good accuracy of the wkb formula up to the 6th wkb order . here",
    "we can compare the results with wkb values , but only for the fundamental overtone , because for higher ones : @xmath86 , and the wkb method can not be applied .    note also , that an effective potential takes negative values near the event horizon , and , the wkb formula does not take into consideration `` sub '' scattering by the local minimum of the potential and should not be so accurate as in the case of the ordinary positive definite potential .",
    "for example , for @xmath87 we get @xmath88 with the help of the frobenius method , and @xmath89 by wkb formula @xcite .",
    "the larger @xmath0 is , the worse convergence of the wkb method .",
    "generally we see that the accuracy of wkb approach is not satisfactory here because the wkb formula is actually good only for @xmath90 .",
    "now let us go over to asymptotically high overtones .",
    "it is known @xcite , that the mass term does not change the infinitely high overtone asymptotic of the schwarztschild black hole .",
    "thus it is natural to expect that the same will take place for a massive vector field . yet , as there are no monopole dynamical degrees of freedom for massless vector perturbations , we can not formally take @xmath13 in the considered effective potential .",
    "therefore , using the nollert s method @xcite , we computed numerically high overtones for non - vanishing values of @xmath0 ( see fig .",
    "5 ) . from fig . 5",
    "one can learn that as @xmath83 is growing , the real part approaches @xmath11 , while the spacing in imaginary part approaches constant : @xmath91    it is different from the asymptotic limit which takes place for higher multipole perturbations of massless vector field @xcite : because for the latter case the real part of @xmath72 asymptotically approaches zero @xcite . to see better",
    "that in the obtained plot @xmath1 approaches @xmath92 let us make fit on values @xmath93 . in a similar fashion with nollert s approach ,",
    "we see that fit in powers of @xmath94 is better then in powers of @xmath95 , and gives @xmath96 this is very close to @xmath97 . when increasing the number of overtones , the obtained fit is closer to @xmath98 .    following the arguments of @xcite , it is straightforward to reproduce numerically obtained asymptotic ( 28 ) in an analytical way .",
    "for this it is enough to remember that the effective potential ( 15 ) , has the following asymptotic behaviour in the origin : @xmath99 and at the event horizon @xmath100 therefore the general asymptotic solution near the origin is @xmath101 then , repeating all relevant steps of @xcite and taking into account that near the event horizon the wave function has the following asymptotic @xmath102 and equating the two monodromy ( which look similar to those in @xcite ) one gets ( 28 ) .",
    "we see that the high overtone asymptotic ( 28 ) is the same as for gravitational perturbations .",
    "this is easily understood , because the effective potential looks like that for gravitational perturbations with formally taken @xmath103 plus massive term times f(r ) . then , as we have shown here for vector and in @xcite for scalar fields , the massive term does not contribute in high overtone asymptotic .",
    "the quasinormal behaviour of sads black holes is essentially dependent on radius of a black hole : one can distinguish the three regimes of large ( @xmath104 ) , intermediate ( @xmath105 ) , and small ( @xmath106 ) ads black holes . from detailed previous study of massless fields",
    ", one can learn that qnms of large ads black holes are proportional to the black hole radius , and therefore to the temperature @xcite .",
    "qnms of intermediate ads black holes do not show simple linear dependence on radius @xcite .",
    "finally , qnms of small ads black holes approach normal modes of empty ads space - time @xcite . in the limit of asymptotically high",
    "damping , qnms show equidistant spectrum with the same spacing between nearby modes for different massless fields ( scalar , electromagnetic and gravitational ) @xcite .    using the horowitz - hubeny method",
    ", we obtain the quasinormal frequencies for sads black hole numerically . as this method",
    "is described in a lot of recent works , we shall outline only the key points of it here .",
    "the schwarzschild - ads metric function can be written in the form @xmath107 where @xmath108 is the anti - de sitter radius .",
    "the corresponding effective potential is divergent at infinity and is polynomial function of @xmath21 .",
    "therefore , one can expand the wave function @xmath73 near the event horizon in the form : @xmath109    here @xmath110 is the largest of the zeros of the metric function @xmath111 .",
    "the dirichlet boundary conditions , we shall use here , imply that @xmath112 then we need to truncate the sum ( 34 ) at some large @xmath113 , in order to observe the convergence of the values of the root of the equation ( 35 ) @xmath72 to some true quasinormal frequency .",
    "the fundamental quasinormal frequencies are shown in table ii for large , intermediate , and small sads black holes for different values of @xmath0 . from table",

    "there one can see that , indeed , in concordance with analytical formula ( 34 ) , one has @xmath141 at a sufficiently high @xmath83 , the above formula is valid independently of the value of the mass field @xmath0 .",
    "it is also valid for any large @xmath110 because in the regime of large black holes the qnms are proportional to the black hole radius @xmath110 for massive fields as well .",
    "one could say that a quasinormal mode at high damping consist of two contributions .",
    "one is proportional to an overtone number @xmath83 and thereby equals to a spacing between nearby modes ; it is called `` gap '' .",
    "another contribution does not depend on @xmath83 in the limit @xmath142 , called `` offset '' .",

    "this should be true also for intermediate and small ads balck holes , yet to check this numerically one needs considerable computer time , because of the slow convergence of the series for small black holes .",
    "all numerical computations in this paper were made with the help of _",
    "fortunately the monopole perturbations of the proca field in the schwarzschild-(a)ds black hole background can be reduced to the wave - like equation with some effective potential . even though the effective potential is not positive definite everywhere outside black hole ,",
    "we have proved that spherically symmetrical perturbations of massive vector field is stable , i.e. there are not growing modes in this case .",
    "this is confirmed by numerical computations of the qnms spectrum , which is done for schwarzschild and schwarzschild - ads black holes .",
    "quite unexpected property , we found , is that the behaviour of the fundamental mode and all higher overtones ( for asymptotically flat case ) are qualitatively different : when increasing the field mass @xmath0 , the damping rate of the fundamental mode goes gradually to zero , leading to appearing of infinitely long living mode , while all higher overtones , on contrary , decrease their @xmath1 what results in existence of almost pure imaginary modes , i.e. damping modes without oscillations .",
    "asymptotics of infinitely high overtones for schwarzschild balck holes are the same as for corresponding gravitational ( massless ) perturbations .",
    "in particular , for schwarzschild black hole , real oscillation frequency approaches @xmath144 , while damping rates become equidistant with spacing equal @xmath145 .",
    "this value of high damping asymptotic , which coincides with that for massless scalar and gravitational fields for schwarzschild black holes can be easily explained by two factors : 1 ) the mass term does not contribute to the limit of infinite damping of the quasinormal spectrum , and 2 ) when formally taking the limit @xmath13 in the effective potential which governs the evolution of massive vector perturbations , one has the potential which looks qualitatively like that for gravitational perturbations .",
