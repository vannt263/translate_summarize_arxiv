    "pressure field radiation and diffraction from a source with a circular aperture and its propagation through elastic medium is quite well known and a well studied subject in acoustics@xcite,@xcite,@xcite .",
    "paraxial approximation has been successfully applied @xcite to study such phenomena .",
    "this approximation neglects @xmath2 term ( the second derivative of pressure with respect to propagation axial co - ordinate ) in the helmholtz equation , as the term is of higher order in beam angle @xmath3 which is very small ( @xmath4 ) .",
    "but when @xmath3 is not so small , paraxial approximation is no longer valid .",
    "some good works has already been done in optics in such nonparaxial correction @xcite,@xcite,@xcite .",
    "but , in acoustics , such work is still missing .",
    "this paper concentrates on the propagation of the acoustic beam transmitted from a monochromatic source from a circular aperture in nonparaxial far - field zone , through a comparatively general approach employing the angular spectrum distribution and the stationary phase method .",
    "gaussian and plane piston are taken as the initial source .",
    "the paper begins with a discussion of an analytic nonparaxial formalism with analytical results .",
    "this is followed by a presentation of numerical results .",
    "discussions with conclusions are the final feature of this paper .",
    "the governing equation for spatial part of pressure field is given by the helmholtz equation @xmath5 in any plane @xmath6 , let us assume the field can be represented by a fourier integral as @xmath7 which when substituted in eq.1 yields @xmath8 and then differentiating under integral sign , we find that @xmath9\\nonumber\\\\ \\times e^{ik(ux+vy)}dudv=0\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for any values of @xmath10 and @xmath11 , the term under bracket will go to zero .",
    "hence the function @xmath12 will satisfy the following differential equation @xmath13 where @xmath14 .",
    "when @xmath15 , @xmath16 . again , when @xmath17 , then @xmath18 .",
    "+ the general solution of the partial differential equation ( 5 ) is @xmath19 where @xmath20 and @xmath21 are arbitrary functions of @xmath22 and @xmath23 . on substitution of equation",
    "( 2 ) , we obtained @xmath24 if we do nt consider reflection mode , then @xmath25 ( soft baffle case ) .",
    "otherwise for rigid baffle , the pressure will be doubled due to reflection .",
    "so @xmath26 here @xmath20 is defined as : @xmath27 let , the source function be defined as @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the window function for circular aperture defined as @xmath30 therefore @xmath20 can be determined by @xmath31 transforming from cartesian coordinate to cylindrical coordinate system i.e. @xmath32 and @xmath33 , and assuming the source is axially symmetric ( fig.1 ) , the integral becomes @xmath34 using the identity @xmath35 @xmath36 thus @xmath37 is @xmath38      the integral over u and v on the right hand side of eq.(16 ) @xmath39 may be approximated by by method of stationary phase . here @xmath40 as @xmath41 , @xmath42 . as the evanescent or exponentially decaying wave does not give any significant contribution in far field zone , we have avoided another condition @xmath43 in our problem .",
    "now let us specify some other variables @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 where @xmath48 , @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "the critical stationary points for this integral will be @xmath51 , @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "hence in this approxination one obtains@xcite @xmath54 where @xmath55 @xmath56 , @xmath57 , @xmath58 etc .",
    "therefore equation(16 ) becomes @xmath59",
    "sources with gaussian amplitude is often been used because of its functional form and invariant nature in different integral transforms .",
    "let , the source function be    schematic diagram of the geometry of circularly apertured beam at @xmath60 in cartesian co - ordinate system . ` - - - '",
    "line for gaussian source , ` .... ' line for piston source.,height=226 ]    @xmath61    where @xmath62 peak amplitude of the source .",

    "eq.(26 ) is the basic analytical result for far - field behavior of nonparaxial gaussian beam with cirlcular aperture .",
    "paraxial result can be obtained from this result by expanding @xmath70 and retaining the first term in amplitude part , and retaining up - to the second term in phase part , @xmath71 so that , eq.(26 ) simplifies to @xmath72}\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty}(-1)^n(ka)^{2n}\\nonumber\\\\ & & \\times\\left(\\frac{x^2+y^2}{4z^2}\\right)^m\\frac{[\\gamma(1+n,1)-n!]}{(n!)^2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] eq.(28 ) is the fraunhofer diffraction formula for apertured gaussian beam with a circular aperture in paraxial regime .",
