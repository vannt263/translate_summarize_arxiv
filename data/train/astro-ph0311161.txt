    "2002 , wilson & yang 2002 ) .",
    "x - ray synchrotron emission implies radiative lifetimes @xmath7 1 - 10 years , and thus requires _ in situ _ acceleration .    all this evidence suggested the possibility of shorter - timescale variability in the m87 jet . indeed , recently harris et al .",

    "observations ; the _ chandra _ data will be discussed in an upcoming paper ( harris et al . , in prep . ) .",
    "our _ chandra _ data reduction procedures were detailed in paper i. all _ hst _ observations were reduced in iraf and pyraf with the best available flat fields , biases , darks and illumination correction images .",
    "dithered images were combined using pydrizzle , which combines drizzling ( fruchter & hook 2002 ) with cosmic ray and hot pixel removal , geometric correction and mosaicing .",
    "galaxy subtraction was done on the f475w and f814w data using ellipse , bmodel and imcalc .",

    "we applied a standard galactic extinction law and assumed @xmath10 to correct the fluxes for reddening .",
    "polarized light images were combined into stokes parameters in aips , using standard formulae .",
    "considerable effort was expended to estimate uncertainties .",
    "we accounted for several error sources , including zero - point and slope errors in the synphot calibration , flat - fielding errors , and poisson errors in the data and in modelling and subtraction of the galaxy .",
    "errors were propagated by adding in quadrature . the cumulative error in the _ hst",
    "_ photometry is typically 3 - 4% , and is dominated by the flat - fielding and zero - point errors .",

    "the nucleus does not show strong energy - dependence in either the x - rays ( @xmath67 and @xmath68 ) or optical ( @xmath69 and @xmath70 , but the departure from zero in the latter measurement is due entirely to the lower significance of the fall in f220w during 2003 feb .- apr . ;",
    "further , note that the drop accelerated after monitoring in f475w and f814w ceased ) . by comparison",
    ", hst-1 does show energy - dependent behavior in the x - rays , with @xmath71 and @xmath72 .",
    "but in the optical , our data are less constraining , giving @xmath73 and @xmath74 .",
    "s behavior in the x - rays agrees with the predictions of a simple synchrotron model .",
    "but such a model can not easily account for the comparable optical and x - ray variability timescales .",
    "two other models can explain such behavior .",
    "the first is that the flare was caused by adiabatic compression , followed by expansion on a dynamical timescale of @xmath75 days .",
    "this would allow radiative losses dominate at high energies , where @xmath76 , while expansion losses would dominate at low energies .",
    "the x - ray variability behavior then requires @xmath77 mg .",
    "however , this model has difficulty explaining x - ray and optical increases and decreases that do not exactly coincide in time ( figure 1 ) .",
    "alternately , the x - ray flare could be triggered by shock compression ( as suggested by the polarimetry , ",
    "3 ) , with the optical emission representing the shocked plasma s downstream propagation . this model requires a @xmath78 stronger magnetic field downstream of the shock to explain the similar 0.5 kev and 220 nm variability timescales .",
    "the nearly energy - independent variability behavior of the nucleus disagrees with simple synchrotron models , although some can not be excluded formally because of the large error bars .",
    "one could account for the energy independence either by adiabatic compression and expansion , or a helical trajectory , where flux would change with viewing angle ( suggested by urry et al .",
    "1993 to explain the nearly energy - independent variability of pks 2155@xmath79304 in 1991 ) .",
    "but perhaps the most attractive model is that the varying region has @xmath80 light - days , so that the light - crossing time controls the variability behavior ( e.g. , chiaberge & ghisellini 1999 ) . in this case",
    "we would require @xmath81 mg .",
    "the flares of the nucleus and hst-1 ( figure 2 ) resemble those of blazars , albeit on longer timescales .",
    "can we explain blazar flares ( @xmath82 days ; ulrich , maraschi & urry 1997 ; pian 2002 ) , as highly beamed versions of these events ?",
    "timescales lorentz - transform as @xmath83 , so @xmath84 days requires @xmath85 ( also consistent with the luminosities seen in blazar flares , e.g. , giebels et al . 2002 ) , while @xmath86 day requires @xmath87 . for reasonable @xmath28",
    ", this requires @xmath88 , at the lower end of the range considered for hst-1 in paper i , and implies @xmath89 .",
    "consistency with hst-1 s @xmath29 ( biretta et al . 1999 ) , then requires @xmath90 and @xmath91 , much tighter constraints than in previous works .",
    "a timescale @xmath84 days then requires @xmath92 and @xmath93 if @xmath94 ) , while @xmath86 day requires @xmath95 and @xmath96 , plus smaller @xmath97 .",
    "unified schemes usually constrain @xmath28 and @xmath98 less tightly ( e.g. , @xmath99 and @xmath100 , urry & padovani 1995 ) .",
    "however , one can imagine a range of @xmath101 or stronger magnetic fields ( e.g. , li & kusunose 2000 , kataoka et al .",
    "2000 , bttcher et al .",
    "2003 ) .",
    "blazars can show either energy - dependent or energy - independent behavior , even within the same campaign .",
    "often , energy - dependent behavior includes one band leading the other . with our data ,",
    "any discussion of delays is premature , although there are possible indications in the data .",
    "monitoring of m87 continues , and we will discuss this subject in a later paper .",
    "do we also see spectral variability in these components ?",
    "figure 3 shows broadband spectra in three epochs , representing both high and low states .",
    "the nucleus has @xmath102 and @xmath103 , in agreement with the fit value of @xmath104 hz found using historical data ( perlman et al .",
    "but in all epochs , @xmath105 , where @xmath106 and @xmath107 are , respectively , the spectral indices in the optical , optical - x - ray and x - ray bands .",
    "thus for standard synchrotron models , the x - ray emission must come from a component distinct from that responsible for the optical emission , since a single electron population can not produce spectral hardenings blueward of @xmath108 .",
    "the nucleus displays only modest spectral variability , with the 2002 december points ( a low optical state ) having flatter @xmath109 but steeper @xmath110 .",
    "this is consistent with a significant ssc contribution .",
    "by contrast , hst-1 has @xmath111 in all epochs , with @xmath112 for epochs ( 2003 april , 2002 december , 2003 february ) , similar to that seen in 1998 , when it was @xmath113 fainter in optical ( perlman et al .",
    "these values of @xmath109 are consistent with shock injection .",
    "the optical to x - ray spectrum steepens in low states and flattens in high states , as expected for synchrotron flaring .",
    "interestingly , the 2003 april high state has a clearly harder spectrum than that seen in 2002 december .",
    "here and in paper i we have found strong optical and x - ray variability in the nucleus of m87 , and knot hst-1 in its jet .",
    "is it possible to link the variability of the nucleus and hst-1 in any way ?",
    "perhaps the flaring in hst-1 was triggered by a density enhancement travelling down the beam of the jet . if we assume a near - constant apparent speed of @xmath29 for this material , its ejection would have occurred @xmath114 years ago .",
    "such an episode could plausibly have caused a radio flare in the nucleus .",
    "interestingly , deyoung ( 1971 ) detected @xmath115% variations in the nuclear radio flux in 1969 - 1971 .",
    "it is possible ( but speculative ) to link the flaring in the nucleus in @xmath116 to the current behavior of hst-1 .",
