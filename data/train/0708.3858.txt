    "kepler s supernova of 1604 @xcite was the most recent well - observed galactic supernova .",
    "the supernova type has been controversial for decades ; the galactic latitude ( @xmath2 ) implies a distance above the galactic plane of 470 pc for a distance of 4 kpc @xcite , arguing for a type ia ( population ii ) progenitor , but optical observations @xcite show radiative shocks in dense knots , suggestive of circumstellar material ( csm ) shed by the progenitor .",
    "bandiera ( 1987 ) proposed that the progenitor was a massive runaway star with a strong wind ; kepler s bright n rim suggests a bow shock directed away from the galactic plane .",
    "x - ray observations of young supernova remnants can give powerful constraints on progenitor models and explosion mechanisms ; whether kepler had a type ia or core - collapse origin , the detailed distribution of ejected material and the composition of csm could be used to test sn models .",
    "we undertook a long observation of kepler with the _ chandra _ x - ray observatory to study the composition and distribution of ejecta and csm , to search for any compact object , and to search for convincing evidence of the sn type .",
    "we observed kepler s snr for 741 ks with the _ chandra _ x - ray observatory acis - s ccd camera as a large project in six installments between april and july 2006 . in all six ,",
    "kepler was positioned ( slightly differently ) on the s3 back - illuminated chip .",
    "data were processed using ciao v3.4 and calibrated using caldb v3.1.0 .",
    "a large background region to the n of the remnant ( covering most of the remaining area on the s3 chip ) was used for almost all spectra except when local backgrounds were called for , as described below .",
    "spectral analysis was performed with xspec v.12 @xcite .",
    "we used the nonequilibrium - ionization ( nei ) v2.0 thermal models , based on the apec / aped spectral codes @xcite and augmented by addition of inner - shell processes @xcite .",
    "we obtained about @xmath3 source counts , with fewer than 3% background ( though some of those may be dust - scattered source photons ) .",
    "s / n permitting , spectra were extracted between 0.3 and 8 kev .",
    "images were smoothed using platelets with a default smoothing parameter @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "figure  [ totx ] shows the full observation , with red for energies between 0.3 and 0.72 kev ( including primarily o ) , green for 0.72  1.7 kev ( primarily fe l - shell transitions , also including ne and mg k@xmath0 complexes ) , and blue for 1.7  8 kev ( with a strong contribution from si k@xmath0 ) .",
    "immediately evident is the absence of dominantly soft - spectrum regions , and the hardness of emission at the periphery",
    ". a few regions do show reddish colors ; representative spectra are discussed below .",
    "no central point source is obvious .",
    "the bright central knot is resolved , and several fainter central knots , though perhaps unresolved , also have spectra of shocked gas . a faint source could be concealed under bright extended emission . our conservative estimate assumes a high total background of 860 cts per acis s3 pixel , appropriate for the bright central band of emission .",
    "a 5@xmath5 detection of a point source within the 80%  encircled power radius of @xmath6 ( 6 px area ) would require 400 cts , or @xmath7 cts s@xmath8 .",
    "the compact central object in cas a @xcite , if placed within kepler and using the absorbing column density determined below , would produce 0.18 cts s@xmath8 .",
    "we conclude that we would detect such a source even if its luminosity were @xmath1 times fainter .    .",
    "regions from which spectra of figs .  [ spectra1 ] and [ spectra2 ] were extracted are shown .",
    "[ totx ] ]    for spectral analysis , we fixed the absorbing column density at @xmath9 @xmath10 , a value we found by fitting lineless regions in the se with an absorbed synchrotron model srcut using @xcite abundances .",
    "we used the three - color image of fig .",
    "[ totx ] to aid in identifying small , relatively homogeneous regions of contrasting spectral character .",
    "we identified and examined about 100 regions .",
    "the vast majority show prominent lines of fe l - shell transitions , he - like si , s , ar , and ca , and fe k@xmath0 , and a handful had contrasting properties .",
    "we found that the spectra can be separated into three main classes .",
    "over 90% of the regions showed fe- and si - rich spectra ; we identify these with sn ejecta .",
    "a few regions showed spectra with o and mg emission consistent with solar- or near - solar abundances ; we identify these with csm . finally , a few regions showed continuum - dominated spectra .    examples of ejecta spectra ( regions 1  3 on fig .",
    "[ totx ] ) are shown in fig .",
    "[ spectra1 ] and the top spectrum ( fe l region , 6 ) in fig .",
    "[ spectra2 ] .",
    "in particular , fig .  [ spectra1 ] shows spectra of three outer knots , where we might expect to find the lightest nucleosynthetic products at the largest distances , specifically the o that should indicate a cc explosion .",
    "all of them , however , show strong si , s , and fe l emission ; prominent ar , ca , and fe k@xmath0 lines are also present in the bright n knot 1 .",
    "the western and southern knots 2 and 3 have comparable si and s emission , but they differ in their fe l - shell emission .",
    "knot 3 is well modeled by a heavy - element plane shock @xcite with velocity @xmath11 of 1010 km s@xmath8 ( [ 889 , 1120 ] km s@xmath8 90%  confidence interval ) , shock ionization age @xmath12 @xmath13 s , si / fe and s / fe ratios ( by number ) of 2.64 ( 2.35,2.92 ) and 2.24 ( 1.59,2.87 ) , respectively . the knot is clearly composed of ejecta .",
    "a trace amount of mg ( mg / fe @xmath14 [ 0.003,0,10 ] ) has been included , because it formally improves the fit , but its presence is much in doubt in view of deficiencies in fe l atomic data .",
    "a synchrotron component ( constrained by the absence of radio flux from the knot [ delaney et al .",
    "2002 ] ) improves the fit quality .",
    "we assumed no collisionless heating at the shock ; if such heating were present , @xmath11 could be substantially less .",
    "si and s are the primary constituents of the southern knot , but a significant ( @xmath15 by mass ) amount of fe is present .    in the western knot 2 ,",
    "the shock speed is lower ( @xmath16 $ ] km s@xmath8 ) and the ionization age is longer ( @xmath17 \\times 10^{10}$ ] cm @xmath18 s ) but most significant are much higher si / fe and s / fe ratios , 11.6 ( 8.9,14.5 ) and 14.7 ( 10.2,21.1 ) , respectively .",
    "there is noticeably less fe ( 6%  by mass ) in this knot ; different fe contents of knots 2 and 3 partially account for their different fe l - shell emission strengths . finally , in knot 1",
    "the relative strengths of si , s , and fe l - shell emission are similar , so this is also a si- and s - rich knot containing fe .",
    "( because a simple plane shock model failed to provide a satisfactory fit at high energies , we have not attempted a detailed abundance analysis for knot 1 ) .    .",
    "top ( red ) : bright si- and s - rich knot 1 in the n. fe l shell , fe k@xmath0 , ar , and ca emission are also strong",
    ". middle ( blue ) and bottom ( green ) : knots in the s ( 3 ) and w ( 2 ) , with plane shock model fits shown .",
    "[ spectra1 ] ]    the striking lack of obvious o features in the vast majority of the regions we examined led us to search specifically for soft - spectrum regions that might be expected to have a different composition .",
    "we found a few ( all showing a pink color in fig .",
    "[ totx ] ) with discernible o features ; two are shown in fig .",
    "[ spectra2 ] .",
    "they constitute our second class of spectral region .",
    "the central knot has optical and ir counterparts @xcite , implying that it is composed of ambient csm .",
    "we obtained the spectrum shown in fig .",
    "[ spectra2 ] after subtracting a local background from the bright e - w band nearby . in the plane - shock model",
    "fit shown in fig .",
    "[ spectra2 ] , we allowed the abundances of ne , mg , si , and fe to vary ( with s and ni tied to si and fe , respectively ) .",
    "the poor spectral resolution of ccd s and the uncertain calibration at low energies , combined with deficiencies in fe l atomic data , do not allow us to determine reliable absolute abundances with respect to h and he , or even a relative n abundance , but supersolar abundances for all elements except n are ruled out .",
    "we assumed near solar composition by setting the o abundance to its solar value , and determined relative abundances with respect to o. we assumed a supersolar ( by a factor of 3 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) n abundance .",
    "we obtained a temperature @xmath19 kev ( 0.59,0.70 ) , @xmath20 @xmath13 s , and abundances with respect to solar of ne = 0.64 ( 0.41 , 0.91 ) , mg = 0.83 ( 0.61 , 1.1 ) , si ( tied to s ) = 1.4(1.0 , 1.9 ) , and fe ( tied to ni ) = 1.1 ( 0.94 , 1.4 ) .",
    "when n was allowed to vary , the best - fit n abundance is 3.2 ( 1.9 , 4.6 ) , where errors do not include systematic uncertainties particularly important at low photon energies .",
    "the model underestimates the continuum near the si and s k@xmath0 lines , most likely because of the presence of multitemperature plasma in the central knot , so abundances of these elements may be somewhat overestimated .",
    "the central knot spectrum is consistent with the same n - enhanced near - solar abundance composition found from optical spectra of the csm in kepler .",
    "[ spectra2 ] also shows another soft - spectrum knot , 5 ; its spectrum is consistent with that of the central knot .",
    "finally , a few regions , primarily in the se , showed featureless or almost featureless spectra ( one example , region 4 , is shown in fig .",
    "[ spectra2 ] ) .",
    "these are well - described by models of synchrotron emission extending from the radio @xcite ; they form our third class of region , and will be described more fully in a future publication .    .",
    "top ( blue ) : fe l region 6 .",
    "no o or mg features are evident .",
    "second from top ( green ) : soft - spectrum knot 5 .",
    "an inflection at 0.6 kev is o ly@xmath0 , and a feature at mg k@xmath0 is labeled .",
    "third from top at 0.8 kev ( red ) : bright central knot .",
    "note o and mg features .",
    "bottom at 0.8 kev ( magenta ) : synchrotron - dominated region 4 at rim in se .",
    "only a faint si feature is apparent .",
    "[ spectra2 ] ]",
    "spectral regions 1 , 2 , 3 , and 6 in our first , si- and fe - rich class are almost certainly ejecta , of a composition completely inconsistent with a cc event , but expected for a thermonuclear explosion .",
    "in fact , they resemble si- and fe - rich compact ejecta knots in the vicinity of the eastern blast wave in tycho @xcite .",
    "ejecta knots far ahead of the blast wave with such an advanced nuclear burning composition have not been found so far in any cc snrs , even cas a ; except for the narrow jet , o is instead the most common element in the outermost ejecta @xcite . only about 5% of our regions fell into the second class of roughly solar o / fe and perhaps elevated n , as expected for csm .",
    "we can state with confidence that nowhere in kepler are there spectral regions consistent with the expected cc o / fe ratio of 70 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; it is very difficult to locate o spectral features at all . where strong fe and si indicate ejecta , o is absent .",
    "however , the dense csm shown in optical observations and now identified in a few regions in x - rays is not expected for a type ia progenitor . in view of the unusual nature of our result , we collect the evidence on kepler s progenitor type .    *",
    "1 . integrated x - ray spectrum and ejecta . * the integrated spectrum ( which resembles region 6 , fig .  [ spectra2 ]",
    "top ) , as well as most of our spectral regions , shows very strong fe l , no apparent o or mg , strong si and often strong fe k emission .",
    "these elements are all identified with ejecta .",
    "( o and mg lines can be seen in the rgs spectrum ; ballet 2004 . )",
    "even knots 1 , 2 , and 3 at the farthest periphery show evidence of strong nuclear processing .",
    "the spectra resemble the integrated spectrum of the ia remnant of tycho s snr ( badenes et al .",
    "2006 ) , but are totally unlike that of the young o - rich cc remnant , 1e0102 - 70.4 , which is dominated by o and ne emission lines ( sasaki et al .",
    "previous work with _",
    "asca _ and _ xmm - newton _ ( kinugasa & tsunemi 1999 , cassam - chena et al .",
    "2004 ) , derived substantial masses of shocked fe , 0.1 - 0.3 m@xmath21 @xcite .    *",
    "2 . scarcity of o. * by contrast , there is little evidence for o in kepler s snr .",
    "it is seen in only a few regions with spectra quite different from the ejecta knots in having relatively weak fe l emission .",
    "most of these regions are coincident with optical knots which have been identified with csm of roughly solar abundances except for elevated n. the x - ray knots do not require enhanced n abundance , but are consistent with the optical abundances .",
    "in particular , o / fe is roughly solar . in sn ejecta of type ia",
    ", o / fe is expected to be only 0.3 - 0.7 by number , whereas in cc explosions , it is about 70 ( e.g. , iwamoto et al . 1999 ) .",
    "none of the spectra we examined had the high o / fe ratios required for cc ejecta .",
    "( several poorly - understood luminous type ib / c sne listed by @xcite could be an exception , because their o / fe ratios are much less than typical for cc explosions . without detailed explosion models for these sne confirming their cc origin , we can not exclude such possible extreme cc events on the basis of the o / fe ratio alone , but they are ruled out by arguments below . )",
    "we conclude that regions with detectable o are csm .    *",
    "3 . central source . * no central point source is seen , with a limit at least 100 times fainter than the source in cas a.    we find the x - ray evidence for kepler s origin in a thermonuclear event to be compelling .",
    "however , additional evidence can be found from optical observations .    *",
    "4 . balmer - dominated shocks .",
    "* @xcite discovered substantial emission from nonradiative , balmer - dominated shocks .",
    "such shocks demand the presence of partially neutral upstream material , ruling out most cc scenarios . a hot ( i.e. , compact ) progenitor of a stripped cc type ib / c",
    "sn would have a strong ionizing flux before the explosion , while a cooler star would be larger at the time of the explosion , resulting in a large ionizing flux at shock breakout .",
    "the presence of neutral h sets an upper limit to the progenitor radius @xmath22 of @xmath23 @xcite , where @xmath24 ev ( @xmath25 ) is the mean energy of an ionizing photon , and @xmath26 and @xmath27 are the shocked csm and ejecta masses . since @xmath26 is only @xmath28 @xcite , explosions of red supergiants with @xmath29 are ruled out , including not only type iip and type iil sne with full and partially - stripped h envelopes , respectively , but also type iib sne like 1993j with only a residual ( @xmath30 ) h envelope left on its he core @xcite .",
    "while an exotic stripped cc event , resulting from a star with a residual hydrogen envelope of low ( @xmath31 ) mass but large radius , might avoid ionizing the csm before or during the explosion , such events become even less probable than a type ia with csm interaction . an additional problem with a stripped cc progenitor",
    "is a large expected mechanical luminosity of its stellar wind , since radio observations of circumstellar interactions in type ib / c sne are consistent with wr winds ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "a powerful wr - like wind would have accelerated and swept away any dense csm to distances of many pc from the sn , in obvious conflict with observations .",
    "* 5 . light curve .",
    "* @xcite summarize the historical data .",
    "kepler s observed peak magnitude of @xmath32 gives @xmath33 ( using the observed @xmath34 to obtain @xmath35 ) , brighter than most cc events but typical for sne ia ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) . the light curve ,",
    "though resembling a normal ia , could also describe a sn iil ( but see above ) .",
    "sn 1987a - like events ( fairly compact blue stars with massive h envelopes ) produce light curves that are far too broad , and are subluminous as well .",
    "we believe that x - ray and optical evidence points compellingly to the conclusion that kepler resulted from a thermonuclear event . however , our deep _",
    "chandra _ observations also confirm that kepler s blast wave is encountering material with at least solar metallicity , coincident with optically emitting n - enhanced material ",
    "most likely circumstellar material lost by a fairly massive star , either the progenitor of the white dwarf or the companion , or both . interaction with csm is unexpected for type ia events .",
    "some type ia sne have shown signs of csm interaction in the form of narrow h lines , like sn 2002ic @xcite and sn 2005gj @xcite , but the interpretation of these objects remains controversial ( benetti et al .",
    "2006 ; but see prieto et al .",
    "patat et al .  (",
    "2007 ) give spectroscopic evidence that sn 2006x is a normal type ia sn with csm interaction .",
    "evidence for csm interaction in snrs appears to be relatively more widespread , and in some cases can be associated with type ia events .",
    "prominent fe emission in dem l238 and dem l249 , two lmc snrs , indicates a type ia origin .",
    "however , the brightness and location of that fe , at small radii with a large ionization age , can not be explained with standard type ia explosions into a uniform ism ( borkowski et al 2006 ) ; interaction with a nonuniform csm seems to be required .",
    "relatively bright central emission dominated by fe is common in lmc snrs @xcite , suggesting that this class of snrs is not a negligible population . n103b",
    "@xcite also shows strong fe and si emission and evidence for csm interaction .",
    "kepler s snr could just be the nearest example of a class of thermonuclear supernovae interacting with dense csm from the progenitor system .",
    "the required csm might indicate an origin in a younger , more massive population .",
    "three recent studies of extragalactic sne ia @xcite propose the presence of a `` prompt '' population ( delay @xmath36 yr ) in addition to an `` old '' population ( delay @xmath37 gyr ) in later - type galaxies . if stars with initial masses less than about 8 @xmath38 produce white dwarfs , the minimum latency for a thermonuclear supernova would be only about 50 myr .",
    "a substantial number of remnants of type ia supernovae should come from the `` prompt '' population .",
    "however , kepler s origin remains problematic .",
    "the elevated csm abundances rule out a very old population , but the systemic velocity ( @xmath39 km s@xmath8 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) seems to indicate either a halo population , inconsistent with the abundances , or a runaway , probably inconsistent with a binary system .",
    "( the galactic bulge population would not extend to kepler s galactocentric distance of 4.5 kpc . ) the total csm mass of @xmath40 @xcite requires too large an initial mass for an extreme halo population .",
    "could kepler have resulted from the thermonuclear explosion of a single star ?",
    "current conventional wisdom requires that all agb stars eject most of their envelopes to leave a sub - chandrasekhar white dwarf ; if that ejection were occasionally impeded , a single - star type ia supernova might result ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "if kepler s progenitor were a single star liberated from the galactic plane by the core - collapse explosion of its companion about 3 myr ago , its maximum lifetime would only be of order 50 myr , also arguing for a more massive progenitor .",
    "our conclusion that kepler resulted from a type ia event with csm interaction has important implications .",
    "models of sn ia progenitor systems make widely varying predictions for the nature of any csm ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; these predictions may now be testable .",
    "similarly , sn ia explosion models can now be tested in detail against the abundances and spatial distribution of elements in kepler , and can be contrasted with tycho s snr , apparently the result of a conventional sn ia encountering only low - density , more or less uniform ism @xcite . the existence of a more massive subclass of sne ia with properties that may be systematically different has obvious important implications for cosmological use of sne ia , as it predicts a redshift - dependent mix of the two types .",
    "since the use of sne ia for cosmology requires correction of peak magnitudes from light - curve shapes with a relation calibrated locally , the application of that same relation to more distant sne ia may raise concerns .",
