    "substantial fluxes of cosmic - ray photons at ultra - high energy ( uhe ) , above 10@xmath0  ev , are predicted by non - acceleration ( top - down ) models of cosmic - ray origin ( for example , see  @xcite ) . at a smaller level , uhe photons",
    "are also expected to be produced in acceleration ( bottom - up ) models  @xcite .",
    "uhe photons can be detected through the particle cascades they initiate in the atmosphere .",
    "so far , upper limits on the photon flux were set  @xcite . the large exposure expected to be collected during the next years , in particular by the pierre auger observatory  @xcite , will enormously increase the sensitivity for detecting uhe photons  @xcite .",
    "contrary to the case of hadron primaries , uhe photons around 10@xmath2  ev can interact with the magnetic field of the earth before entering the atmosphere  @xcite .",
    "this process is commonly called geomagnetic cascading or preshower and leads to a dramatic change of the air shower development for primary photons  @xcite .    the probability of magnetic @xmath3 pair production ( `` photon conversion '' ) and , in case of conversion , the synchrotron emission by the produced electrons depend on the particle energy and on the transverse component of the local magnetic field  @xcite .",
    "photon conversion can occur at altitudes up to several thousand kilometers above the ground , i.e.  well above the atmosphere ( @xmath4100  km altitude ) .",
    "a preshower consists mostly of the secondary photons emitted by the electrons .",
    "a secondary photon of sufficiently high energy may additionally convert in the magnetic field and produce another electron pair .",
    "the number of preshower particles depends on the specific conditions and can fluctuate strongly ; it can range from a few particles to a few thousand .",
    "nevertheless , as we demonstrate in this paper , the preshower formation can be fairly well inferred from characteristics of the observed extensive air shower .",
    "the spread of the preshower particles in transverse distance from the shower axis and in arrival time at the atmosphere is well below the resolution of current shower experiments  @xcite .",
    "hence , also in case of geomagnetic cascading , the subsequent air shower would be observed as one event by the experiments .",
    "since the probability of photon conversion and the synchrotron emission spectrum depend on the local transverse magnetic field , characteristics of the preshower process ( such as conversion probability , or the energy spectrum of the preshower particles ) depend strongly on the specific trajectory through the magnetosphere . for a given experimental site",
    ", this leads to a large directional dependence of preshower characteristics within the local coordinate system of zenith @xmath5 and azimuth @xmath6 .",
    "in addition , as already noted in the work of mcbreen and lambert 25 years ago  @xcite , a dependence is expected on the location of the experiment : experimental sites at different geomagnetic latitudes have different local magnetic field conditions , which can affect preshower characteristics for uhe photons .",
    "the comparison of preshower characteristics of uhe photons expected at two sites located at different hemispheres of the earth is of particular current interest due to the construction of the pierre auger observatory .",
    "the southern part of the observatory ( `` auger south '' ) is situated near malargue ( argentina ) at 69.2@xmath7  w , 35.2@xmath7  s. the construction of auger south is approaching completion and first results were obtained , including an upper limit to uhe photons  @xcite . to achieve full sky coverage , the northern site ( `` auger north '' )",
    "is planned in colorado ( usa ) at 102.7@xmath7  w , 37.7@xmath7  n. at auger south , the magnetic field of @xmath424.6  @xmath8 points upward to @xmath9 . at auger north , the magnetic field of @xmath452.5  @xmath8 points downward from @xmath10 .",
    "means east , @xmath11 north etc . ]",
    "previous works in the literature focused rather on the directional dependence of preshower characteristics of uhe photons for one given site than comparing the conditions at different sites .",
    "examples of magnetic field strengths at various sites were given in  @xcite .",
    "in that work , the observable of shower size ( total number of electrons at ground ) was studied .",
    "it was noted that azimuth regions of smaller ( or stronger ) preshower effect can be identified that may differ between the sites . in  @xcite ,",
    "the altitude dependence of the transverse component of the magnetic field was compared for the two auger sites for a few directions , and preshower particle spectra were studied .",
    "e.g.  in  @xcite , it was pointed out that at auger north , due to the larger magnetic field , the preshower effect starts at a lower energy .",
    "a particular focus of that work was the study of observables for the ground array , where differences in the detector signals for converted and unconverted primary photons were found .    in this work , making use of our preshower code  @xcite linked to conex , a fast shower simulation program  @xcite",
    ", we perform a dedicated comparison of the preshower characteristics of uhe photons for the conditions of the auger north and auger south sites .",
    "the geomagnetic field in preshower is described by the igrf model  @xcite .",
    "we find that the transition range in energy from small to large conversion probabilities is larger at auger north , starting at smaller but ending at higher energy .",
    "we study how the differences of the preshower characteristics between the two sites can be used to perform a complementary search for uhe photons .",
    "in particular , the situation may arise where a possible uhe photon signal detected at auger south requires an independent cross - check . as will be shown",
    ", such a cross - check could come from auger north .",
    "in fact , making use of the uhe preshower effect by observing from a different experimental site seems the most elegant and natural way for cross - checking an uhe photon signal claim .    while the study is performed for the specific case of the two auger sites , the general findings hold for any two sites with sufficiently different local magnetic field conditions .",
    "the results shown for auger north hold , to a good extend , also for the hires  @xcite and telescope array  @xcite sites , both of them being located in utah .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows . in section  [ sec - preshower ] ,",
    "preshower features are discussed , and in section  [ sec - eas ] , the corresponding air shower features are studied . in section  [ sec - scenarios ] , uhe photon scenarios and their observation at the two different sites are investigated . in particular , it is worked out how observations at the two sites can complement each other .",
    "conclusions are given in section  [ sec - conclusion ] . in appendix  [ app - a ] it",
    "is shown how the transverse component of the geomagnetic field in the igrf model varies along different particle trajectories . in appendix",
    "[ app - b ] we show a collection of conversion probability sky maps supplementing section [ subsec - convprob ] .",
    "a key parameter to characterize the fate of an uhe photon in the earth s magnetic field is the conversion probability @xmath12 .",
    "given the local differential probability of a photon to convert into an electron pair , @xmath12 results from an integration along the particle trajectory .",
    "small values of @xmath12 indicate a large probability of the uhe photon to enter the atmosphere without conversion and to keep its original identity . in turn ,",
    "uhe photons would almost surely undergo geomagnetic cascading for values of @xmath12 close to unity .",

    "one can see that at 40  eev , photon conversion is already important at auger north for a large part of the sky .",
    "in contrast to this , at auger south conversion is very unlikely for 40  eev photons independent of their arrival direction .",
    "the energy above which photon conversion becomes important , is expected to be smaller at auger north due to the larger local magnetic field strength . to quantify this ,",
    "we show in figure  [ fig - pofce ] a sky map of photon energies for a fixed conversion probability of @xmath19 . it can be seen that photon conversion starts at a factor @xmath42 higher energy at auger south compared to auger north .    at energies of 100  eev ,",
    "also for auger south photon conversion is important for a sizeable part of the sky ( figure  [ fig - pc ] , right ) .",
    "as expected , small conversion probabilities are found for sky regions around the pointing direction of the local magnetic field vector .",

    "it is clear from this that cuts on the local shower arrival direction can be introduced to select regions of the sky where @xmath12 is larger ( or smaller ) at one site compared to the other site . applying the same cuts to data from the two sites , event sets with enriched ( for the one site ) and",

    "for instance , the energy at which @xmath19 is reached changes at auger north by a factor @xmath415 over the sky , at auger south only by a factor @xmath44 . in other words , the sky pattern for geomagnetic cascading is more `` inhomogeneous '' at auger north ( larger transition range in energy from small to large conversion probability ) than at auger south .",
    "in fact , while the preshower effect starts at smaller energies for a larger part of the sky at auger north , the transition range to full conversion extends to even _ higher _ energies at auger north , see figure  [ fig - pofce ] ( bottom ) , sky map for @xmath21 . as an example",
    ", a 250  eev photon ( @xmath18ev)=20.4 ) has a conversion probability @xmath22 for all directions at auger south , while at auger north a small window with @xmath23 still exists ( see figure  [ fig - app3 ] ) .    at first glance",
    "this seems unexpected .",
    "as the magnetic field strength is a factor two larger at auger north , one would rather expect photon conversion at smaller energies at auger north .",
    "however , this feature is again related to the different locations within the geomagnetic field , with auger north being considerably closer to the magnetic pole : in this case , the local magnetic field lines are less curved when following them from ground to higher altitudes .",
    "correspondingly , the _ transverse _ projection of the magnetic field vector , which determines the local conversion probability , remains small out to considerably larger distances from the earth compared to the situation at auger south .",
    "thus , the fact that auger north is closer to the pole results in a larger transition region for photon conversion , starting at smaller energies compared to auger south ( due to the _ larger strength _ of the local magnetic field ) and ending at higher energies compared to auger south ( due to the _ smaller bending _ of the magnetic field lines with distance ) . to summarize , the different positions of the sites in the geomagnetic field translate into a spatial shift of the conversion patterns at the sky according to the pointing of the local magnetic field vector and into modifications of the transition energy range .",

    "one could imagine in one case a relatively small transverse magnetic field extending over a larger distance , while in the other case relatively close to the earth , a stronger magnetic field contributes",
    ". the same integrated conversion probability could be reached , but the spectrum of preshower particles may differ ( for instance , the synchrotron emission spectrum gets harder with stronger magnetic field ) .    in figure  [ fig - espek ] , averaged spectra of preshower particles at the top of the atmosphere are shown , weighted by the particle energy , for different directions at auger north and south . in both cases , @xmath24 .",
    "one can see that both spectra look quite similar ; most energy is carried by particles of @xmath27  ev . a shift between the distribution of about a factor 1.6 in energy",
    "can be noted , however . performing air shower simulations for these two directions , a difference in the average depth of shower maximum @xmath28 of the converted events of @xmath29  g  @xmath30",
    "is obtained .",
    "this difference is much below the shift in @xmath28 comparing converted and unconverted photon showers to each other ( see next section ) . for other directions of same integrated conversion probability , differences are typically smaller than shown here . for our purposes in this work , we conclude that the differences in conversion probabilities are a sufficient measure for the different preshower characteristics when comparing the two sites .",
    "in this section , we study the basic features of air showers initiated by converted and unconverted photons , with particular emphasis on the _ differences _ between these two classes of events .",
    "the reasoning is that the differences between auger south and north in the sky patterns for photon cascading , studied in the preceeding section , translate into differences of the air shower features that are well observable .",
    "it is well known that unconverted showers , contrary to converted , have a considerably delayed shower development due to the lpm effect  @xcite .",
    "additionally , event - by - event fluctuations can be extraordindarily large due to a positive correlation of the suppression of the cross - section with air density ( a photon traversing a certain depth @xmath31 without an interaction has a larger probability for traversing an additional @xmath31 due to the larger air density ) .",

    "secondly , a study of @xmath28 distributions ( which provides a measure of the relative shower age at ground ) provides us with most relevant information for investigating possible complementary features of both sites .",
    "we now give an illustration of how advantage could be taken of the complementarity between the preshower characteristics at auger north and south . as examples ,",
    "we consider a diffuse photon signal , a signal from a source region , and the absence of photons ( i.e.  determining upper limits ) .      in this example , we assume an isotropic primary flux with the all - particle energy power low spectrum with index -2.84 . such a spectrum is consistent with the first estimate from the auger south observatory  @xcite .",
    "it should be noted that a deviation from this power law , for instance a suppression of the flux above the energy of the speculated gzk cut - off , would result in a correspondingly modified all - particle flux at highest energies .",
    "the existence of such a hypothetic suppression will not affect the conclusions of this section : discussed differences between photon showers observed at auger north and south depend only on the local geomagnetic field ( see below for a quantitative example of applying a simple cut - off to the energy spectrum ) .",

    "the input fraction of photons as a function of primary energy follows the results from a topological defect model in  @xcite .",

    "in particular , the peak in the distributions at @xmath34  g  @xmath30 comes from protons , at @xmath35  g  @xmath30 ( at auger north ) from converted photons , and at @xmath36  g  @xmath30 ( at auger south ) from unconverted photons . , height=328 ]    the @xmath28 distribution of events ( as projected from the scatter plot shown in figure  [ fig - xmaxvseln ] ) is given for 50@xmath16100  eev primary energies in figure  [ fig - xmaxdistln ] .",
    "at auger north , the events with large @xmath28 ( unconverted photons , present at auger south ) , are mostly lacking .",
    "instead , events accumulate at @xmath35  g  @xmath30 ( converted photons ) . to see the effect of a hypothetic gzk suppression of the energy spectrum at high energies",
    ", we applied a simple cut - off at e = 80  eev ( @xmath20ev )  =  19.9 ) to the data set . as expected , all the characteristic peaks of the @xmath28 distribution remain at the same positions as in case of spectrum _ without _ cut - off plotted in figure  [ fig - xmaxdistln ] .",
    "the only difference is the heights of the peaks corresponding to converted and unconverted photons with respect to the proton peak : they decrease by 10 - 20% in case of spectrum _ with _ cut - off .",
    "this is due to the larger fraction of photons at higher energies in the assumed model .",
    "an observation of such different characteristics at auger north and south ( signal at different values of @xmath28 , behaviour of average @xmath28 and @xmath28 fluctuations as a function of energy ) , would be an unambiguous confirmation of a photon signal detection .",
    "so far , the local northern sky was studied . as expected ,",
    "a similar but _ opposite _ behaviour is found for the local southern sky ( not shown ) when selecting , for instance , shower arrival directions from azimuth angles between 210@xmath16330@xmath7 .",
    "since this occurs at a somewhat higher energy , the event statistics is reduced in this case due to the steep primary flux spectrum .",
    "let s now regard a hypothetical scenario of a photon signal coming from a certain source region .",
    "localized hadron - accelerating sources are expected to produce photons at an energy typically 10 times smaller than the maximum energy of accelerated hadrons .",
    "detection of the currently highest energy event at @xmath37  ev provides a motivation for the investigation of photons at not much lower energies produced by a localized source .",
    "the sky region accessible to both auger sites is limited to source declinations @xmath38 . requiring a maximum zenith angle of @xmath39 for shower observations at both sites ,",
    "the range of accessible declinations is @xmath40 .",
    "the conversion probability of uhe photons from the direction of a certain source can change with time even at one site only , depending on the source declination .",
    "examples are given in figure  [ fig - decl ] for @xmath41  ev and @xmath42  ev photons .",
    "for instance , for a source at the celestial equator conversion probabilities between 0@xmath1675% are covered at @xmath41  ev at auger north .",
    "it is interesting to note that for the same conditions , the conversion probability is negligible at auger south . thus , characteristic differences when observing events from the same sky region exist that again could be used for a complementary study of uhe photons .",
    "a special case is the scenario of a source region observed _ at the same time _ from auger north and south . also here , differences exist in the _ instantaneous _ conversion probability of photons .",
    "this can be seen in figure  [ fig - decl ] by comparing the curves at auger north and south for the same source declination as a function of time .",
    "for instance , the instantaneous difference in the conversion probabilities for @xmath42  ev photons from a source at the celestial equator can reach , in the extreme case , almost 100% .",

    ", title=\"fig:\",height=302 ]      if the photon flux is below the detection limits of current experiments , upper limits are deduced by comparing the data to expectations for showers initiated by primary photons .",
    "the signatures from photon showers differ between auger north and south due to geomagnetic cascading .",
    "thus , even in case of _ observing no photons _ at both sites , differences arise in the _ analysis _ of the data since the photon hypothesis tested when deriving a limit is different at each site .",
    "upper limits obtained at auger south can , to some extend , be cross - checked this way at auger north .    in photon limit studies ,",
    "simulations are used to optimize the analysis cuts and to calculate the acceptance to photons . due to the generally larger @xmath28 ,",
    "the acceptance to photons can be smaller than that to nuclear primaries when requiring the @xmath28 to be above ground .",
    "then , an efficiency correction to the photon limit may be needed . to keep the correction small ,",
    "a fiducial volume cut was applied in  @xcite , requiring a minimum zenith angle of 35 - 42 deg ( depending on energy ) .    this condition could be relaxed at auger north due to the onset of the preshower effect at smaller energies . on the one hand ,",
    "the power of shower - to - shower discrimination is reduced for events from these arrival directions , as converted photon showers are more similar to proton - induced showers than unconverted ones . on the other hand ,",
    "the result is a gain in instantaneous aperture at auger north .",
    "the effective gain is largest at energies around @xmath20ev)@xmath419.8 where for a sizeable part of the sky , photons already can convert at auger north , contrary to auger south . for",
    "identical experiments and requiring @xmath28 to be above ground , the aperture is increased at auger north by @xmath430% ( 20% ) when allowing zenith angles up to 60@xmath7 ( 75@xmath7 ) at @xmath20ev)@xmath419.8 .",
    "the difference of conversion probabilities is a convenient and effective parameter to estimate the complementarity between two sites for searching for uhe photons . regarding the two sites of the pierre auger observatory , auger north and auger south , significant differences in the preshower features of uhe photons exist .",
    "the sky patterns of the preshower features are shifted due to the different pointing directions of the local magnetic field vectors .",
    "in addition , auger north is located closer to the magnetic pole .",
    "this leads to a larger transition range in energy from small ( @xmath44 ) to large ( @xmath1 ) conversion probabilities compared to auger south .",
    "more specifically , photon conversion starts at auger north at smaller energies due to the larger magnetic field , but conversion probabilities @xmath1 are reached for the whole sky at higher energies due to the smaller bending of the field line with distance .",
    "these differences in the preshower characteristics result in different rates of ( un-)converted photons from the same ( both in local and astronomical coordinates ) regions of the sky .",
    "air showers initiated by converted and unconverted photons can be well distinguished by current experiments .",
    "the main difference is related to the position of depth of shower maximum @xmath28 , which is typically @xmath4200@xmath16300  g  @xmath30 smaller for converted photons .    for a variety of uhe photon flux scenarios ( diffuse photon flux ; photons from source regions ; absence of photons ) , the different preshower characteristics at the experimental sites can be used for a complementary search for uhe photons .",
    "most important , a possible detection of uhe photons at auger south may be confirmed in an unambiguous way at auger north by observing the well predictable change in the signal from uhe photon showers .    _",
