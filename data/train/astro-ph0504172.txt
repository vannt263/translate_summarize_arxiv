    "damped  absorbers ( dlas ) , which cause the strongest absorption lines found in quasar spectra , have neutral hydrogen ( ) column densities greater than @xmath14  @xmath15 .",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "they contain more  than all the absorption line clouds in the  forest combined ; and in an @xmath16 universe , they contain as much hydrogen as the comoving mass density of stars in disk galaxies today .",
    "this led @xcite to put forward the hypothesis that dlas are large , thick gaseous disk galaxies .",
    "this hypothesis has been debated since .",
    "on one hand , absorption - line velocity profiles of low - ionization species of dlas seem to be consistent with those expected from lines of sight intercepting rotating thick gaseous disks @xcite .",
    "@xcite argue that the most likely rotation velocity is @xmath17  , i.e. , that dlas are typically as massive ( @xmath18 ) as @xmath19(@xmath20 ) galaxies . on the other hand , @xcite and @xcite",
    "have shown that a large range of structures and morphologies , rather than a single uniform type of galaxy , can account for the observed dla kinematics . at least at low redshifts ( @xmath21 ) , this is supported by observations @xcite .",
    "early predictions of dla properties were made using cosmological simulations @xcite and semianalytical simulations of galaxy formation @xcite .",
    "then , @xcite extended the results of @xcite to predict the dla statistics ( e.g. , @xmath22 ) accounting for the limited resolution of those simulations .",
    "they developed a semianalytical method to correct the numerical predictions for the contribution of unresolved low - mass halos and found that roughly half of these systems reside in halos with circular velocities @xmath23  , and half in halos with @xmath24  .",
    "interestingly , @xcite found that `` a cdm model with @xmath25 , @xmath26 gives an acceptable fit to the observed absorption statistics , '' whereas other models did not match the observations so well .",
    "more recently , @xcite found that there was an anti - correlation between the absorber cross section and the projected distance to the nearest galaxy , and that dlas arise out to 1015 kpc .",
    "indeed , they found that the mean cross section for dla absorption is much larger than what one would estimate based on the collapse of the baryons into a centrifugally supported disk . to match the observed dla abundances , they required an extrapolation of the mass function to small halos down to a cut - off of @xmath2780  .",
    "other work , such as that of @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite , indicates that dlas are mostly faint ( sub - l@xmath28 ) galaxies in small dark matter halos with @xmath29  .",
    "however , the exact fraction of dlas in such halos is a strong function of resolution , as shown by @xcite .",
    "@xcite and @xcite used cross section arguments and reached similar conclusions .",
    "for instance , @xcite argued that the observed lyman break galaxy ( lbg ) number density alone ( @xmath30   mpc@xmath31 down to 0.1  @xmath32 ) can account for all dla absorptions at @xmath33 if the cross section for dla absorption is @xmath34 with @xmath35  kpc , much larger than the luminous parts of most lbgs @xcite .",
    "however , @xcite pointed out that the cross section can be much smaller than this , if a fraction of dla systems arise in outflows or if @xmath36 is much larger ( i.e. , there are many lbgs or other galaxies not yet detected ) . in the semianalytical models of @xcite ,",
    "dlas arise from the combined effects of massive central galaxies and a number of smaller satellites within 100  @xmath37  kpc in virialized halos . from all these studies",
    ", it appears that the low - mass hypothesis is favored against the thick gaseous disk model of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "a strong constraint on the nature of dla will come from a measure of the typical dla halo mass .    in order to constrain the mass of @xmath38 dlas , several groups",

    "are using lyman break galaxies ( lbgs ) as large - scale structure tracers to measure the dla - lbg cross - correlation , given that in hierarchical galaxy formation models , different dla masses will lead to different clustering properties with the galaxies around them .",
    "specifically , the dla - galaxy cross - correlation yields a measurement of the dark matter halo mass associated with dlas relative to that of the galaxies .",
    "in particular , if the galaxies are less ( more ) correlated with the dlas than with themselves , this will imply that the halos of dlas are less ( more ) massive than those of the galaxies .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to use cosmological simulations in order to demonstrate that cross - correlation techniques will uniquely constrain the mean dla halo mass , and to compare the results with observations .",
    "the advantage of using cosmological simulations is that one can check the reliability of the clustering results given that the mean halo mass of any population is a known quantity in the simulations . as we show , we find that the dla - galaxy cross - correlation implies a mean dla halo mass ( logarithmically averaged ) of @xmath39 close to the @xmath40 expected from the dla halo mass distribution .",

    "each gas particle is projected onto the grid in correct proportions to the pixel(s ) it subtends given its smoothing length . since dlas occur in dense regions , however , the smoothing lengths are typically equal to or smaller than the pixel size .",

    "we refer the reader to @xcite and @xcite for a detailed discussion of the dla halo mass distribution in numerical simulations .",
    "typically , in order to match the observed dla statistics , they require an extrapolation of the dla mass function below the mass resolution . here",

    "a widely used statistic to measure the clustering of galaxies is the galaxy autocorrelation function @xmath68 .",

    "we computed @xmath2 with the estimator @xmath107 where @xmath108 is the observed number of galaxies between @xmath109 and @xmath110 from a dla and @xmath111 is the expected number of galaxies if they were uniformly distributed , i.e. , @xmath112 where @xmath113 is the galaxy surface density .",
    "@xmath114 denotes the average over the number of selected dlas ( @xmath115 ) . in counting the pairs",
    ", we took into account the periodic boundary conditions of the simulations .",
    "there are several reasons not to use other estimators such as the ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ls ) estimator .",
    "first , we want to duplicate as closely as possible the method ( and estimator ) used in the observations of @xcite and bl04 .",
    "but , more importantly , the ls estimator is symmetric under the exchange of the galaxies with the absorbers , whereas here and for the observations of bl04 , the symmetry is broken .",
    "this is due to the absorber redshift being well known , while galaxies have photometric redshifts with larger uncertainties and , therefore , are distributed along the line of sight .",
    "this broken symmetry is also fundamental in the derivation of equations  [ eq : auto : result][eq : cross : result ] .",
    "had we used spectroscopic redshifts and @xmath93 instead of @xmath90 , the ls estimator would be superior .",
    "given that we use the galaxy surface density @xmath113 to estimate the unconditional galaxy density ( see eq .",
    "[ eq : cross ] ) , the integral of @xmath116 over the survey area @xmath117 will be equal to the total number of galaxies , i.e. , @xmath118 . as a consequence , @xmath119 , and",
    "the correlation will be negative on the largest scales , i.e. , biased low .",
    "this is the known `` integral constraint '' . in the case of our @xmath120",

    "there are several ways to compute @xmath123 in practice .",
    "the proper way to compute @xmath123 would be to resample the dlas , since this would include the uncertainty due to the finite the number of lines of sight .",
    "however , this is valid for independent lines of sight , as in the case of an observational sample ( provided that @xmath115 is large , say greater than @xmath125 ) , and will not be correct here given that we have only one simulation and that we have to use the same galaxies for each simulated line of sight .",
    "the uncertainty @xmath123 must then reflect that we used only one realization of the large - scale structure .",
    "for this reason , we elected to use the jackknife estimator @xcite , i.e. , by dividing the @xmath126  mpc@xmath59 area into nine equal parts and each time leaving one part out .",
    "this will accurately reflect the uncertainty in @xmath127 due to the one large - scale structure used , but the signal - to - nois ratio ( s / n@xmath128 ) will not increase with @xmath129 as expected ( appendix b ) : it will saturate after a certain value of @xmath115 .",
