    "this suggests that in the line configurations a coordinate singularity occurs .",
    "by contrast , the unphysical situation of all particles in a point represents a true curvature singularity , as @xmath78 vanishes there .",
    "in order to find the metric in the space of orbits in terms of the distances @xmath19 we start from the degenerated metric ( 32 ) of * i*. then we pass to the basis associated with the coordinates @xmath79 where @xmath80 .",
    "the relevant part of the transformation matrix is given by @xmath81 the @xmath82 block with the basis in the 1-forms @xmath83 then is transformed to the basis @xmath84 through the relations ( [ coordist ] ) .",
    "finally we get : @xmath85 the covariant form of the metric has a more complicated expression .",
    "( [ 3metric ] ) is the induced metric in the space of orbits .",
    "it is not surprising , that @xmath86 is manifestly symmetric in both masses and distances , because the overall translational and rotational degrees of freedom have been suppressed .",
    "remarkably , the metric @xmath86 has a conformal symmetry .",
    "indeed , ( [ 3metric ] ) is unchanged under multiplying all distances with the same factor , thus @xmath86 is homogeneous of degree zero in @xmath87 .",

    "the distance in the metric @xmath93 of any point from the origin is the length of the corresponding conformal killing vector ( [ kd ] ) .",
    "thus the curvature scalar ( [ r3p ] ) is just 6 divided by the square of this distance .",
    "whenever one has a metric @xmath86 with a conformal symmetry , by an appropriate rescaling a new metric @xmath94 can be found which has the property , that the conformal killing vector of @xmath86 is a true killing vector of the metric @xmath95 . in our case the scaling function was found to be @xmath96 . choosing an adapted coordinate system the metric @xmath95 does not depend on @xmath97 .",
    "such a coordinate system is given by @xmath98 in which the conformal killing vector of @xmath86 takes the simple form @xmath99 .",
    "thus the metric @xmath86 is expected to have the form : @xmath100 unfortunately the attempts to write the metric in terms of the radial coordinate @xmath97 , supplemented by any two angular coordinates , have resulted in less symmetric forms .    in the search for angular variables which give a reasonably simple form of the metric , we have found a convenient ( but redundant ) set given by the sines @xmath101 of the three angles @xmath102 ( fig.2 . ) .",
