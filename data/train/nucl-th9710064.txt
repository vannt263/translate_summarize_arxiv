    "this offers the unique opportunity to study the possible existence of multiple charmed objects .",
    "it is remarkable , that hadrons with two or more charm quarks , like the @xmath1 and the @xmath2 have not be seen so far ( for a summary see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "certain exotic states with charm quarks have been discussed intensively in the literature .",
    "multiquark states have been studied in potential models using meson exchange @xcite .",
    "the tetraquark with two heavy quarks of mass @xmath3 and two light ( u , d , s ) quarks is bound in the limit of @xmath4 , but the situation for the charm quark with @xmath5 gev is less clear ( see e.g.  @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "a recent investigation finds that the heavy tetraquark system is bound when using pseudoscalar - meson exchange contributions @xcite . the pentaquark with one anticharm quark and four light quarks was proposed independently by lipkin @xcite and by gignoux and coworkers @xcite .",
    "this state is bound by an enhanced color magnetic binding energy .",
    "hexaquark and heptaquark states with charm have been discussed also @xcite .",
    "there are proposals to search for the tetraquark and pentaquark in pp collisions ( for an overview see e.g.  @xcite ) at charm2000 and cern compass .",
    "other exotics , especially for more than two charm quarks , have not been considered so far .    here , we investigate the structure of multiply charm objects ( charmlets ) , as well as their masses and stability .",
    "first , estimates are given for the production rates of these objects at rhic using a simple coalescence approach .",
    "then , the properties of charm bulk matter are discussed .",
    "a modified bag model is introduced in section three which is able to describe hadrons with and with out charm in the same approach the color electric and magnetic interactions for charmlets are investigated in section four . finally , we give a summary and an outlook .",
    "the first and most basic question we have to address is , if there is any chance to detect multi - quark exotics in heavy ion collisions .",
    "we will try to answer this question in this section in the case of @xmath6 collisions at rhic .",
    "first we estimate very crudely the production probability of multi  charmed hadrons and then compare this production probability to detailed calculations within the cascade model hijing @xcite using a coalescence code as afterburner .",
    "an early estimate of heavy baryon production at rhic and lhc within a simple statistical model can be found in @xcite .",
    "the first scale we have to determine is the total number of events @xmath7 at the rhic collider in an average year .",
    "every production rate or probability @xmath8 has to be compared to this number . only in cases",
    "for which @xmath9 we have a fair chance to measure the exotic .",
    "given the luminosity at rhic @xmath10 @xmath11 s@xmath12 and the geometric cross section of gold nuclei @xmath13 barn , we find that there can be up to @xmath14 heavy ion collision events per year .",
    "this number has to be reduced by several factors .",
    "first , the accelerator will run only part of the year .",
    "in addition , the detectors will only cover a small fraction of the full solid angle and one has to face all kind of inefficiencies . finally , there is the branching ratio of the exotic state to measurable ( charged ) final states .",
    "guided by the proposal for the experiments charm2000 and cern compass designed to measure charmed exotics in pp collisions @xcite , one might be able to recover as little as @xmath15 of the actual data . combining these reduction factor with the integrated luminosity for a month or so",
    ", we obtain a very conservative estimate for the expected number of events at rhic per year @xmath16 .",
    "we can expect , that an experimental observable occuring with a likelihood larger than @xmath17 can be detected .    a simple method to estimate the production probability of charmed hadrons is the coalescence model @xcite . in its basic version",
    "this model implies , that the production probability of a multi - quark state should be proportional to the product of the ratios of the number densities of its constituents normalized to the total density of the surrounding matter . in hot and dense hadronic matter charmed quarks",
    "are mainly formed via pair creation .",
    "the cross section for this pair creation process for proton nucleus collisions has been measured @xcite and is in the order @xmath18 mb for a lab energy of @xmath19 gev .",
    "extrapolated to the bombarding energy available at rhic of @xmath20 gev one gets @xmath21b @xcite .",
    "this amounts to about 10 @xmath22 pairs in one single central collision of gold nuclei at rhic !",
    "the charm pair production cross section has to be compared to the total nucleon nucleon cross section of @xmath23 mb . as a first guess , we find that an exotic containing @xmath24 charmed quarks is produced with a probability proportional to @xmath25 .",
    "this guess neglects the light quark content of the exotic .",
    "actually , in equilibrated hadronic matter the charmed quark ",
    "anti - quark pairs would annihilate again and we would end up without any charmed hadrons .",
    "only the surrounding light quarks can combine with the charmed quarks to form @xmath26mesons , @xmath27baryons etc . in this way",
    "we maintain the charmed quarks , prevent their annihilation and enhance the probability that these type of singly charmed objects combine with itself or other hadrons to multi - charm and multi - baryon number carrying exotics .",
    "high light quark density is therefore essential to assure the production of these kind of exotics .",
    "the central rapidity region should be the best area to find them experimentally .",
    "an estimate of both , the light quark and baryon number density , is the number of nucleons @xmath28 of the collision normalized by the number of pions @xmath29 expected for collisions at rhic , i.e.  several thousand .",
    "the probability to find an charmed exotic with baryon number @xmath30 is therefore proportional to the ratio @xmath31 . at central rapidity",
    "this might be around @xmath32 .",
    "the suppression factor for forming a deuteron is then about @xmath33 .    putting these results together , we find that the production probability of a charmed exotic with charm number @xmath24 and baryon number @xmath30 is @xmath34 from this estimate we gain a first feeling what possibly could be detected at rhic .",
    "( [ eq : prob ] ) gives one deuteron in 10 events and 10 d - mesons per event .",
    "combined with the supposed sensitivity of @xmath35 the inequality @xmath36 for the detectability of multiply charmed exotics emerges . a single charmed exotic carrying baryon number three , a double charmed exotic with baryon number two , or a triple charmed exotic with baryon number one ( the @xmath2 , the charmed analog to @xmath37 ) , seems to appear in enough events to be visible in the detectors .",
    "let s solidify this result with a simulation .",
    "for a first estimate we used the momentum distribution of charm quarks from the event generator hijing @xcite as input for a simple coalescence model .",
    "charm quarks sitting in within a certain radius of momentum @xmath38 are supposed to form a multiply charmed exotic .",
    "we assume , that the main penalty comes from the coalescence of charm quarks and neglect the penalty of finding light quarks within the same area as they are abundantly produced at such high energy .",
    "recent investigations of charm quark production at rhic indicate a sizable energy loss of charm quarks during the expansion stage especially in transverse momentum .",
    "a so called quench incorporates the energy loss of the charm quarks by rescattering with the surrounding particles after being produced in a heavy - ion collision .",
    "this makes the phase space distribution of the charm quarks narrower than in the unquenched case ( for a more detailed discussion about this point see @xcite ) .",
    "[ fig : prod1 ] shows the number of produced charmed exotics for various charm numbers as a function of the coalescence parameter @xmath38 .",
    "here we choose the case with shadowing and a quench , the case for no shadowing without a quench is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : prod2 ] . in both cases ,",
    "the production of double and triple charmed objects seems to be detectable at rhic , i.e.  the production rate is above @xmath35 per event .",
    "a quench enhances the formation of charmed matter as the heavy quarks are closer together in phase space .",
    "we find indeed , that for the quenched case , the production rate is higher and less sensitive to the coalescence parameter @xmath38 as the charm quarks .",
    "another scenario was recently discussed in @xcite which will also enhance the production rates of charmed matter droplets . within a cascade hydrodynamical model",
    ", they find that charmed particles feel drag and diffusion forces within quark - gluon plasma droplets so that the charm quarks resides inside the droplet .",
    "this mechanism resembles very much the separation mechanism for strange quarks : the quark - gluon plasma droplet gets enriched with strangeness as it is energetically more favorable to keep the strange quark inside the droplet @xcite .",
    "here we point out that the distillation mechanism proposed for the formation of strangelets @xcite will also work for charmed matter , as the d - meson is much lighter than the lightest baryon with charm @xmath39 .",
    "this effect will furthermore enhance the charm fraction of the droplet during cooling down by emitting d - mesons and carrying away anticharm quarks , therefore enriching the plasma droplet with charm .",
    "nevertheless , this implies a baryon - rich regime or strong fluctuations of baryon number which one might expect at rhic energy @xcite .",
    "therefore , charmed exotics of @xmath40 might well be produced in measurable amounts if a quark - gluon plasma forms .",
    "hence , we will investigate in the following the properties of charmed objects for @xmath40 , too .",
    "first , let us discuss the properties of charm matter in bulk .",
    "strange matter gets enhanced stability compared to two flavor matter by introducing a new degree of freedom and a lowering of the fermi energy @xcite .",
    "this is possible , as the strange quark mass is still light enough . for the charm quark with a mass of the order of 1.5 gev",
    ", the fermi energy can not be lowered at reasonable density .",
    "calculations for hybrid stars with charm quarks conclude that this quark is probably too heavy to appear in the core of a neutron star @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", the potential generated by an effective one - gluon exchange gets attractive and gives an enhanced stability for heavy quarks .",
    "this potential is repulsive for massless quarks and is evident from the energy density for massless quarks which reads @xmath41 here @xmath42 is the strong coupling constant and @xmath43 is the chemical potential of the up and down quarks . note that for values of @xmath44 the correction from one - gluon exchange is bigger than the zeroth order .",
    "usually , bag model fits to hadron spectra yield @xmath45 @xcite indicating a highly non - perturbative potential .",
    "this is a problem for bulk matter , as the pressure gets negative because @xmath46 therefore , the parameters extracted from a fit to hadron spectra can not be used for bulk matter calculation .",
    "this indicates that the bag model is an effective model and that the parameters change when going to higher density and/or strangeness numbers .",
    "the situation changes for a finite quark mass . the energy density for quarks with a finite mass",
    "is given by @xcite @xmath47\\ ] ] with @xmath48 . here",
    "the interaction gets attractive for large enough quark mass @xmath49 .",
    "this can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : energy ] , where the total energy per baryon number ( minus the mass ) is plotted versus the charm fraction @xmath50 for increasing values of the strong coupling constant @xmath42 . for @xmath51",
    ", charm matter is bound by 55 mev at @xmath52 .",
    "hence , the charm quark is heavy enough to feel an attractive interaction from the effective one - gluon exchange . for comparison ,",
    "the case for strange matter indicated by @xmath53 is also shown , then as a function of the strangeness fraction @xmath54 .",
    "only the case @xmath55 can be seen on the plot . adding the one - gluon exchange contribution results in a repulsive term , so that the curves for the strange quarks are shifted up and are lying outside the range displayed in the figure .    in general ,",
    "charm matter consists of strange quarks also .",
    "we plot the areas , where charm matter is bound in a contour plot as a function of the charm and strangeness fraction in fig .",
    "[ fig : matter ] for different values of the strong coupling constant @xmath42 .",
    "note that charm matter can not exist for @xmath56 by definition ( one can not have more than three quarks per baryon number ) .",
    "the calculation was done for a bag parameter of @xmath57 mev taken from a fit to charmonium levels @xcite which is in accordance with estimates from qcd sum rules @xcite .",
    "also shown is the case for the parameters taken from a fit to the hadron spectra ( denoted by fit ) which we will discuss in the following section .",
    "this is the area in the lower right corner of the figure with a much lower bag parameter of @xmath58 mev .",
    "note that the pressure is negative for the massless quarks in this case as @xmath59 !",
    "charm matter is bound when the total energy per baryon is lower than the sum of the corresponding hadron masses .",
    "the masses of the hadrons with @xmath60 are not known and taken from the bag model calculation ( see table  [ tab : masscharm ] ) .",
    "strange matter along the line for @xmath61 is unstable for this bag parameter @xcite except for the parameters taken from the fit .",
    "nevertheless , charm matter demonstrates to be stable for a wide range of charm and strangeness fraction of @xmath62 and @xmath63 even for this high bag parameter .",
    "hence , charm matter might be stable while pure strange matter is not .",
    "the next step is to calculate the masses of finite charm matter for low baryon numbers .",
    "this will be done in the following sections after introducing the modified bag model for multiply charm quark bags .",
    "at present our technical skills in solving qcd do not suffice to accurately predict boundstate energies of multi  quark states .",
    "instead we have to rely on simple model calculations and estimates .",
    "a very simple , controllable and relatively reliable model for our purposes is the bag model @xcite .",
    "we think the results of this model give us a qualitative first impression of the stability of multi  quark states .",
    "more detailed calculations can be performed both through potential interactions and on the lattice .",
    "we modify the commonly used version of the bag model in two essential ways .",
    "first , we evaluate the bag energy by setting the strong coupling @xmath42 to zero @xcite , effectively neglecting all color electric and magnetic contributions .",
    "both contributions are evaluated after minimization of the bag energy , then added to the bag mass , and therefore treated as true lowest order corrections . in this way we take only the gluon exchange contribution into account and our bag is locally color charged , while globally color neutral .",
    "we postulate that all other color electric and color magnetic corrections can be accounted for by adjusting the parameters of the model . and secondly , we treat all quarks on the same footing , i.e.  we do not distinguish between heavy and light quarks , rather demand flavor symmetry which is broken by the explicit masses of the quark species .",
    "this simplifies our approach . a very heavy quark , like the bottom is thus not treated non  relativistically and is not sharply localized at the center of the bag .",
    "instead it is distributed , with the maximum of the distribution being closer to the center of the bag than the one of the light quarks .",
    "both of these modifications are ad hoc and can only be justified by the success of the phenomenological model in describing the experimentally measured hadronic masses .",
    "we are interested in a first crude estimate of the binding energy of a multi  quark state with @xmath64 quarks .",
    "all quarks are confined inside a spherical bag of radius @xmath65 .",
    "the energy or mass of such a state is to zeroth order in the strong coupling @xmath42 given by @xmath66 where @xmath67 is the eigenenergy of the @xmath68-th quark confined within the bag , @xmath69 is the casimir energy of the bag @xcite absorbing all effects @xmath70 and @xmath71 is the bag constant .",
    "minimization of the bag energy determines the bag radius @xmath65 .",
    "the confined @xmath68-th quark has to satisfy both the free dirac equation and the linear boundary condition at the bag radius @xmath65 which leads to the constraint for the single particle energy @xmath72 of a quark @xmath73 where @xmath49 is the mass and @xmath67 the total energy . in fig .",
    "[ fig : density ] we plot the probability density @xmath74 of a quark of flavor @xmath75 for a bag of radius @xmath76 fm as a function of the scaled radius @xmath77 .",
    "the probability density is proportional to the sum of the square of the spherical bessel functions @xmath78 the heavier the quark , the more localized is the density at @xmath79 and the smaller are the values for the spherical bessel functions .",
    "the minimization of the bag energy in eq .",
    "( [ bage ] ) fixes the bag radius @xmath65 .",
    "we use this radius to determine the color electric and color magnetic corrections to order @xmath42 .",
    "both corrections were discussed by many authors , e.g.  @xcite and we quote only the results .",
    "the color electric correction @xmath80 is @xmath81 where the @xmath82 are the color matrices of particle @xmath68 and the density @xmath83 is given by @xmath84- m_i\\,[\\sin(x\\,u)\\,\\cos(x\\,u)-\\sin^2(x\\,u)/x\\,u]}{\\omega_i\\,[x-\\sin^2(x)/x ] -m_i\\,[\\sin(x)\\,\\cos(x)-\\sin^2(x)/x]}\\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] note , that the summation is performed over all quark pairs in the bag ( @xmath85 ) . in the original mit bag model ,",

    "therefore , the original mit bag model can not describe the mass of j/@xmath89 , as it is mainly bound by the coulomb - like color electric potential . in our case , the sum runs only over unequal quark pairs ( @xmath85 ) , therefore , the color electric potential turns out to be @xmath90-\\frac{16}{3}\\right ) \\times e_{cc } = -\\frac{16}{3 } e_{cc}\\ ] ] i.e.  nonvanishing and strongly attractive , as needed to describe the masses of @xmath91 and @xmath92 correctly .",
    "this procedure allows now for a _ local _ color charge ( there is an intrinsic color charge inside the bag ) , but the overall color charge still vanishes as the sum over all quarks in the bag gives @xmath93 here @xmath94 is the casimir operator of the quark flavor @xmath95 .",
    "hence , light quarks and heavy quarks can have a color charge and do not need to be color neutral separately , but of course the sum of all color charges gives an overall color neutral object .",
    "this new color degree of freedom will be important for the enhanced stability of multiquark states which we will discuss later in more detail .",
    "the color magnetic correction @xmath96 is @xmath97 where the @xmath98 are the spin matrices and the magnetic moment @xmath99 of the quark eigenmode given by @xmath100 the summation runs again over all quark pairs in the bag .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : electric ] we plot the electric interaction @xmath101 and the magnetic interaction @xmath102 between two quarks with flavor @xmath103 as a function of the bag radius @xmath65 .",
    "we see that the largest contribution to the total electric interaction energy within the bag is given by the interaction between two heavy quarks . in contrast , the largest contribution to the total magnetic interaction energy within the bag is given by the interaction between two light quarks .",
    "a multi - quark bag becomes therefore more stable the more heavy charmed quarks we add , due to the increase in the electric interaction energy , and it becomes more stable the more flavor antisymmetric we arrange the light quarks ( u , d , s ) .",
    "this property will allow us to simplify the study of the group structure of multi  quark bags in the next section .    as a test of our modified bag model",
    "we calculate first the measured masses of the light hadrons built up from @xmath104 and @xmath105 quarks .",

    "[ tab : masses ] we list our results for the light hadrons .",
    "we reach satisfactory agreement for the heavier hadrons , but have problems with the lightest mesons like the @xmath115 system and light strange mesons like the @xmath116 and the @xmath117 .",
    "we attribute this to their role as goldstone bosons of chiral symmetry .",
    "the slightly larger error of the @xmath118 might be due to its non  spherical shape .    in the next step",
    "we include the two heavier quarks and check if our model continues to perform reasonably well .",

    "[ tab : masscharm ] and [ tab : massbeauty ] good agreement between the experimental measured masses and our masses . in most cases",
    "we have a relative deviation from the measured masses of less than @xmath124 .",
    "the predicted masses of @xmath1 and @xmath2 are a little bit higher than estimates from potential models @xcite . with this in mind",
    "we can proceed in the next section to analyze the color and spin assignments for multi - charmed exotics and use then our modified bag model to predict their masses .",
    "as seen in the previous section , quark bags can be bound by either the color magnetic force or the color electric force .",
    "the former one is dominant for light quarks , while the latter one is most pronounced for the heavy quarks c and b ( see figs .",

    "@xmath102 is the matrix element defining the strength of the interactions .",
    "the potential depends on the dimensions of color - spin su(6 ) and color su(3 ) following the notation of @xcite . from eq .",
    "( [ eq : lalamag ] ) one sees , that the representation with the highest casimir operator @xmath128 will be mostly bound .",
    "generally , the representation which is mostly symmetric in color - spin will have this feature @xcite .",
    "it turns out that the [ 56]-plet is the most symmetric and will be more bound than baryons . but",
    "this one is color charged and does not exist in nature then .",
    "now we include heavy quarks , like the charm quark , which will have a negligible contribution to the color magnetic term due to its heavy mass",
    ". then one can make the [ 56]-plet of light quarks color neutral by adding e.g  three charm quarks ( or antiquarks ) and gain this additional binding energy .",
    "this is of course in line with the discussion about the hyperfine interaction for pentaquark states introduced by lipkin @xcite but from a slightly different point of view .",
    "one can estimate the binding energy by assuming that the matrix element @xmath133 is the same for all light quarks ( i.e.  setting @xmath134 ) and independent of the radius of the bag .",
    "then one gets for the binding energy @xmath135 the necessary values for the casimir operators can be found in @xcite .",
    "we note that the [ 56]-plet is a singlet in flavor , as overall fermi statistics require that the most symmetric one in su(6 ) color - spin must be most antisymmetric in su(3 ) flavor .",
    "hence , the proposed exotic states would have a quark content of \\{udsccc } ( the @xmath136 dibaryon ) and \\{udsccc } ( similar to a bound state of two d - mesons and one d@xmath137 meson ) .",
    "the same line of argumentation can be repeated for four light quarks , which are in a [ 210]-plet and are color neutral by adding an anticharm quark ( this is the well known pentaquark @xmath138 @xcite ) or two charm quarks ( the @xmath139 dibaryon with \\{uudscc } , \\{uddscc } ) or = \\{udsscc } ) .",

    "this does not support the possibility for the bound exotics @xmath143 .",
    "for the heptaquarks \\{uuddscc } , \\{uudsscc } , \\{uddsscc } the situation is different as @xmath144 as the two charm antiquarks combine to two d - mesons without any gain in the color magnetic energy .",
    "the case for @xmath145 gives @xmath146 the line of argumentation stops here as it is just the famous case for the h - dibaryon @xcite which is color neutral by itself .",
    "hence , the exotics \\{uuddssccc } and \\{uuddssccc } only exist , if the h - dibaryon is bound and/or the interaction between heavy and light quarks is attractive enough .",
    "the discussion of the color electric term is simpler , as it involves only color su(3 ) . between",
    "the charm quarks one finds the color electric potential @xmath147 where @xmath148 is the matrix element for the color electric interaction .",
    "this is the coulomb - like potential used in e.g.  charmonium potential models .",
    "this potential increases linearly with the number of heavy quarks hence giving an enhanced stability for multiply charmed objects ! in addition , we calculate also the color electric potential between the charm quark and the light quarks : @xmath149 as the contribution is quite sizable ( see fig .

    "fig : electric ] ) .",
    "interestingly , this interaction does not depend on the number of light and heavy quarks .",

    "one notes , that for certain candidates , like \\{3q3c } , the coefficients for the potentials for the candidate and its decay product are just the same .",
    "hence , these candidates are not likely to be bound . in four cases ,",
    "only the color magnetic term is larger for the candidate than for the decay products ( \\{cc4q},\\{6c6q } , the pentaquark \\{c4q } , and \\{6c6q } ) .",
    "other candidates get additional binding energy from the magnetic term and one of the color electric terms depending on the color charge representation . for the cases of different color states for the charm quarks",
    ", one observes that the one with the higher dimension in color su(3 ) gives less binding for the magnetic term and the electric term @xmath148 but more binding for the electric term between the heavy and the light quarks @xmath153 . as the latter term is the most dominant contribution to the overall binding energy (",
    "see tables  [ tab : cand ] and [ tab : anticand ] ) , it might well be that multiply charmed objects are bound in a higher representation of color su(3 ) !    to clarify this , we estimate the matrix element from figs .",
    "[ fig : electric ] and [ fig : magnetic ] to @xmath154 mev , @xmath155 mev and @xmath156 mev and calculate the binding energy .",
    "table  [ tab : esti ] shows the result .",
    "indeed , for some cases the higher color charge representation turns out to be more stable : for \\{3c6q } , \\{cc2q } , \\{cc5q } , and \\{cc6q}. accidentally , it comes out to be the same for two cases ( \\{cc4q } and \\{4c4q } ) .",
    "note , that we predict on this basis , that the tetraquark \\{cc2q } will be more bound , if the charm quark is sitting in the higher color su(3 ) representation , i.e.  in the color sexplet instead of the usually assumed color triplet .",
    "the tetraquark is then bound by the electric interaction between the heavy and light quarks and not by the coulomb - like potential between the heavy quarks !",
    "the binding energy is quite sizable but will be diminished by flavor su(3 ) breaking effects and finite size effects due to the different radii of the candidate and the decay products .      for the flavor breaking case",
    ", one has to calculate the coefficient for every quark - quark combination . in the following ,",
    "we take into account the finite strange quark mass and consider three different quarks species : @xmath157 .",
    "the color electric contribution between the same quark species in the color state defined by @xmath158 is given by @xmath159 where the sum runs only over the quark species @xmath160 .",
    "hence , for the charmonium one gets @xmath161 , but for a baryon with two charm quarks it is @xmath162/2 - 16/3 = -8/3 $ ] , a factor of two lower , often encountered in potential models .",
    "the case of three different quark species can be found by using the definition of the quadratic casimir operator for color su(3 ) @xmath163 where the casimir operator of color su(3 ) for the two quark species is just the one of the remaining quark species @xmath164 due to color neutrality .",
    "this results in @xmath165 the same procedure can be done for the color magnetic interaction , here for su(6 ) .",
    "defining @xmath166 gives @xmath167 + \\frac{1}{2 }   c^k_3 + \\frac{4}{3 } s(s+1)\\ ] ] for equal quarks , otherwise @xmath168 where @xmath132 denotes the total spin of the subsystem of the quark species @xmath160 and @xmath169 . from fig .",
    "[ fig : magnetic ] one sees , that one can neglect the color magnetic contribution for the charm quark .",
    "then one can calculate the color magnetic interaction for the light quarks for the different possible cases of spin and color by taking care of the overall fermi statistics .",
    "for example , for three light quarks \\{uds } in a color octet state one gets @xmath170 , @xmath171 , @xmath172 , @xmath173 or @xmath174 , @xmath175 , @xmath171 , @xmath176 , @xmath177 , respectively . here",
    "@xmath178 stands for up- and down- quarks .",
    "for the color singlet case , only one combination is possible with @xmath170 , @xmath179 , @xmath172 which is just the case for the @xmath180 hyperon . with the coefficients determined above",
    ", we calculated the masses of all possible charmlet candidates within the modified bag model up to 6 light and 6 charm quarks .",
    "the result is shown in table  [ tab : bagcand ] for charm quarks and in table  [ tab : baganticand ] for anticharm quarks . only in two case , indicated by a star ,",
    "the threshold mass for the strong decay is known experimentally .",
    "all the other threshold values are estimated within the same bag calculation .",
    "as it is evident from the tables , none of the candidates has a mass lower than the ( estimated ) threshold mass , hence they are all unstable",
    ". the bag calculation might be accurate within 3% guided by our fit to the hadron spectra .",
    "there are four candidates which have a mass within this range of 3% above the threshold mass , three with baryon number two : \\{cssudq } with charge + 1 or 0 , \\{ccsudq } with charge + 2 or + 1 , \\{ccssud } with charge + 1 , and one with baryon number three : \\{cccssuudd } with charge + 2 .",
    "none of the anticharm candidates comes so close to the threshold .",
    "the reason is that the decay products of the latter ones are d - mesons , which have a bigger binding energy than @xmath39 baryons due to their smaller radius .",
    "the dependence of the color magnetic and electric potential is quite sensitive to the radius of the bag .",
    "a larger bag feels therefore a smaller attractive potential than a smaller one .",
    "secondly , the finite mass of the strange quark also decreases the color magnetic interaction .",
    "these effects can then result in an unbound candidate , which was bound in the flavor symmetric case .",
    "nevertheless , there is another more important term , which determines whether or not a multi quark bag is bound .",
    "this is the so called casimir energy which is proportional to @xmath181 as also discussed in @xcite . as the decay products will involve at least two bags , this attractive term alone",
    "will raise the multi quark bag considerably . in the case of equal radii ,",
    "say 1 fm , one gets an additional shift of @xmath182 mev ! in reality , this shift will be even higher , as the radius increases proportional to the number of quarks sitting in the bag .",
    "note , that this term is purely phenomenological and absorbs all effects proportional to @xmath183 for the hadron spectra .",
    "this might change considerably for multi quark states , but can not be determined within this simple bag model .",
    "all the charmed candidates below a mass of 8 gev are lying within 300 mev above the threshold .",
    "for the anticharm candidates , only the pentaquarks and the tetraquarks fulfill this constraint .    furthermore , the bag model assumes a spherical symmetric shape and an uniform radius for all quark species .",
    "this assumes , that the charm quarks are sitting in the core surrounded by the light quarks . as demonstrated in the previous sections",
    ", the color electric term between the light and heavy quarks might be the dominant one .",
    "this will cause the charmlet to form a highly nonspherical configuration , as the light quarks are located around each charm quark , while the charm quarks , feeling a repulsive potential between each other , are separated from each other .",
    "this structure has to be studied in a fully three - dimensional model which is beyond the scope of the present investigation .",
    "we demonstrate that charm matter can be produced at the coming rhic collider in reasonable amounts .",
    "we estimate the production rates of these exotic new form of matter at rhic in a simple coalescence approach and find , that about 10100 multiple charmed exotics can be measured per year .",
    "energy loss of the charm quarks and hydrodynamical effects can enhance these production rates considerably .",
    "we investigate the properties of charmed matter and finite multiple charmed objects .",
    "the one - gluon exchange in bulk matter gets attractive for a sufficiently high mass of the charm quark , much more than for the lighter strange quark .",
    "charm matter is bound with respect to strong decay to hadrons within an area of charm fraction of @xmath62 and a strangeness fraction @xmath63 even if strange matter is unstable .",
    "we introduce a modified bag model where the parameters are fitted to hadron masses .",
    "the model can describe the masses of hadrons with and without charm on the level of a few percent .",
    "the predictions of the masses for multiply charm hadrons are a little bit higher than the ones from potential models .",
    "we discuss then the color magnetic and color electric potentials for multi quark states with charm . for finite systems , we show that in the limit of su(3 ) flavor symmetry the color magnetic interaction can be more attractive than for the corresponding hadron with a similar quark content .",
    "systems with 3 and 4 light ( u , d , s ) quarks have an enhanced color magnetic term compared to ordinary hadrons when adding heavy quarks .",
    "the constraint of color neutrality can be released for the light quarks as the heavy charm quarks neutralizes the overall quark bag .",
    "this allows for an additional freedom for the spin and color structure of the light quarks , therefore enhancing the binding energy .",
    "in addition , the color electric interaction between the charm quarks is also attractive and increases with the number of charm quarks .",
    "it turns out that the dominant contribution to the binding of multi charm objects comes from the color electric term between heavy and light quarks which depends solely on the internal color structure .",
    "these effects result in an enhanced stability of multiply charmed exotics .    for flavor symmetry and ignoring finite size effects , several charmlet candidates have binding energy of more than 100 mev .",
    "a full calculation within the modified bag model does not give a bound candidate .",
    "also the pentaquark and the tetraquark are not bound in our approach .",
    "for some other cases the masses are lying just a few percent ( within our range of uncertainty , i.e.  less than 3% ) above threshold .",
    "these candidates are : the hexaquarks \\{cssuud } , \\{cssudd } with charge + 1 and 0 , \\{ccsuud } , \\{ccsuud } with charge + 2 or + 1 , \\{ccssud } with charge + 1 , and one candidate for @xmath184 \\{cccssuudd } with charge + 2 .",
    "these candidates might be bound , if one replaces the charm quarks with the heavier bottom quarks , as the attractive color electric forces will increase for heavier quarks .",
    "note , that the tetraquark is bound in the limit of @xmath4 .",
    "we checked this for the above candidates but found that the candidates with bottom quarks are still lying above the estimated threshold .",
    "the main reason for the sudden instability of the candidates in the full bag model is , that the effective energy correction @xmath181 shifts multi quark states up by at least @xmath185 mev .",
    "another reason is that non - spherical solutions might exist which are lying lower in energy .",
    "this picture is supported by the strongly attractive potential between light and heavy quarks which will cause the charm quarks to be separated and not sitting in the center of the bag as assumed in our calculation .",
    "this can only be addressed in full three - dimensional calculation .",
    "further investigations along this line using other models , like potential models or lattice calculations , are certainly needed to clarify this question . in this context , it is interesting to note that meson exchange contributions are important for binding multiquark systems as pointed out by several authors @xcite .    as the charmed hadrons live on a timescale around @xmath186 a vertex detector",
    "is needed for their detection which must be sitting extremely close to the target .",
    "micro - strip detectors are used for the charm200 and cern compass experiments which are looking for pentaquark and tetraquark states in pp collisions .",
    "similar techniques can be used for searches at the rhic collider .",
    "charm exotics as well as hadrons with two or three quarks can be well produced at this energy .",
    "hence , truly heavy ion collisions at rhic opens the unique and tantalizing opportunity of producing and detecting multiply charm objects .",
    "they can possibly be detected by looking for a cascade of several weak decays of the charm quarks .",
