    "in neutron - rich nuclei , various exotic phenomena appear because of excess neutrons .",
    "one of the current issues concerning exotic excitation modes in neutron - rich nuclei is low - energy dipole excitations @xcite . for stable nuclei ,",
    "isovector giant dipole resonances ( gdr ) have been systematically observed in various nuclei by measurements of photonuclear cross sections ( for example , ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the gdr is understood as opposite oscillation between protons and neutrons and microscopically described by coherent 1p-1h excitations .",
    "peak structure of strength function of the gdr has been often discussed in relation with nuclear deformation . in neutron - rich nuclei ,",
    "low - energy dipole resonances have been suggested to appear because of excess neutron motion against a core .",
    "the so - called soft dipole resonance , which is the enhanced e1 strength observed in the extremely low - energy ( @xmath10 mev ) region in neutron halo nuclei such as @xmath9he and @xmath11li , has been intensively studied by experimental and theoretical groups and often discussed in relation with two - neutron correlation @xcite . more generally the low - energy e1 strength typically in @xmath12 mev region is predicted in various nuclei in a wide mass region , and the one decoupling from the gdr is called pigmy dipole resonance .",
    "the role of excess neutrons in and the collectivity of these low - energy dipole excitations are topics of interest in theoretical studies .",
    "the low - energy e1 strength has been also discussed in relation with neutron skin thickness and density dependence of the symmetry energy , though the correlation between pigmy dipole strength , neutron skin thickness , and the symmetry energy is under debate @xcite .",
    "the experimental measurements of the low - energy e1 strength in @xmath0be by photodisintegration have been performed mainly in astrophysical interests @xcite . in these years , precise data of the e1 strength for low - lying positive - parity states of @xmath0be have been reported @xcite . moreover , the recently measured photodisintegration cross sections of @xmath0be indicate the significant low - energy e1 strength around @xmath13 mev exhausting about 10% of the",
    "thomas - reiche - kuhn ( trk ) sum rule @xcite , consistently with the bremsstrahlung data @xcite .",
    "the experimental data of the e1 strength of @xmath0be are available in a wide energy region from low energy to high energy : the e1 strength for the positive - parity states in @xmath14 mev @xcite , the significant e1 strength around @xmath13 mev @xcite , and the e1 strength in @xmath3 mev for the gdr @xcite .",
    "our aim is to investigate isovector and isoscalar dipole strengths in @xmath0be and @xmath1be to understand the low - energy dipole modes .",
    "i try to clarify the role of excess neutrons and the decoupling mechanism of the low - energy dipole modes from the gdr .",
    "the low - lying states of @xmath0be are understood by @xmath15 cluster structures as discussed in cluster models @xcite .",
    "the photodisintegration cross sections in very low - energy region of @xmath0be have been theoretically investigated by two - body ( @xmath16be+@xmath17 ) and three - body ( @xmath15 ) cluster models with continuum states @xcite",
    ". however , such cluster models are not able to describe the high - energy dipole strength of the gdr , to which coherent 1p-1h excitations may contribute . to investigate the pigmy and giant dipole resonances in general nuclei , shell model and mean - field approaches have been applied .",
    "the former may not be suitable for such largely deformed nuclei as be isotopes having cluster structures .",
    "the latter is usually based on the random phase approximation ( rpa ) with and without continuum .",
    "although the rpa calculation is successful for a variety of collective excitations in heavy mass nuclei , it is a small amplitude approximation neglecting large amplitude motion .",
    "moreover , in most of current mean - field approaches , the rpa calculation is based a parity - symmetric mean field in a strong coupling picture without the angular - momentum and parity projections , and the coupling of single - particle excitations in the mean - field with rotation and parity transformation is not taken into account microscopically .    to take into account the coherent 1p-1h excitations and the large amplitude cluster mode as well as the angular - momentum and parity projections , we develop a method of antisymmetrized molecular dynamics ( amd ) @xcite .",
    "the time - dependent amd , which was originally developed for study of heavy - ion reactions @xcite , was applied to investigate e1 and monopole excitations @xcite . however , in the time - dependent amd approach , the angular - momentum and parity projections are not performed , and therefore , ground state structures and the coupling of single - particle excitations with the rotational motion are not sufficiently described . instead of the time - dependent amd , we superpose the angular - momentum and parity projected wave functions of various configurations including the 1p-1h and cluster excitations .",
    "we first perform the variation after the angular - momentum and parity projections in the amd framework ( amd+vap ) @xcite to obtain the ground state wave function .",
    "then we describe small amplitude motions by taking into account 1p-1h excitations on the obtained ground state wave function with the shifted amd method as done in ref .",

    "to investigate dipole excitations , i incorporate 1p-1h excitations on the ground state wave function with the shifted amd method .",
    "i also perform the @xmath2-cluster gcm calculation combined with the shifted amd to see how the @xmath2-cluster mode affects the dipole excitations . in this section ,",
    "i explain the formulation of the amd+vap , the shifted amd , and the @xmath2-cluster gcm calculations , and also describe the definition of the dipole strengths .",

    "the @xmath26th single - particle wave function @xmath27 is written by a product of spatial , spin , and isospin wave functions as @xmath28 @xmath29 and @xmath30 are the spatial and spin functions , respectively , and @xmath31 is the isospin function fixed to be up ( proton ) or down ( neutron ) .",
    "the width parameter @xmath32 is fixed to be the optimized value for each nucleus . to separate the center of mass motion from the total wave function @xmath33 , the following condition should be satisfied , @xmath34 in the present calculation",
    ", i keep this condition and exactly remove the contribution of the center of mass motion .",
    "accordingly , an amd wave function is expressed by a set of variational parameters , @xmath35 , which specify centroids of single - nucleon gaussian wave packets and spin orientations for all nucleons . in the amd framework ,",
    "existence of clusters is not assumed _ a priori _ because gaussian centroids , @xmath36 of all single - nucleon wave packets are independently treated as variational parameters .",
    "nevertheless , a multi - center cluster wave function can be described by the amd wave function with the corresponding configuration of gaussian centroids .",

    "i call this method `` the shifted amd '' ( samd )",
    ". the spin - nonflip version of the samd has been applied to investigate monopole excitations of @xmath18o in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "i choose an enough small value of the spatial shift @xmath51 , typically @xmath72 fm , so as to obtain @xmath51-independent results .",
    "the model space of the samd contains the 1p-1h excitations that are written by a small shift of a single - nucleon gaussian wave function of the ground state wave function . in the intrinsic frame before the angular - momentum and parity projections , the ground state amd wave function is expressed by a slater determinant , and therefore , the samd method corresponds to the rpa in the restricted model space of the linear combination of shifted gaussian wave functions .",
    "however , since the projected states are superposed in the samd , the coupling of the 1p-1h excitations with the rotation and parity transformation is properly taken into account . therefore , the samd contains , in principle , higher correlations beyond the rpa in mean - field approximation .",
    "note that , the shift @xmath73 of the gaussian wave packet can be expressed by a linear combination of harmonic oscillator ( h.o . ) orbits at @xmath74 .",
