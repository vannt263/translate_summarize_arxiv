    "there has been an increasing interest  @xcite in the fabrication and properties of nanostructured magnetic materials not only from a fundamental but also from a technological point of view , owing to their potential applications in magnetic recording media  @xcite , biosensors and magnetic sensors based on the giant magneto - resistance effect  @xcite .",
    "the ultimate density of recording media depends on the size of the individual magnetic elements .",
    "the miniaturization of the latter can now be realized through the electrodeposition of nanodots or nanowires into self - assembled arrays , such as track - etched polymer membranes and anodic alumina filters .",
    "structural and magnetic characterization of arrays of nickel ( ni ) nanowires produced by electrodeposition in polycarbonate membranes with diameters in the ( 15 - 100 nm ) range and @xmath0 m average length are made .",
    "the nanowires made within polycarbonate membranes , with various diameters ( 15 nm , 50 nm , 80 nm , 100 nm ) , are used to study the influence of the various parameters such as pore geometry and deposition process on the magnetic properties .",
    "magnetization curves with various magnetic field orientations and nanowire diameters were determined at room temperature by magnetometry . according to the form of hysteresis loop measured , about four ranges of values of pore diameter control the orientation of easy axis of magnetization with respect to the wire axis . reducing the diameter of the nanowires from 100 to 15 nm leads to increasing coercive fields from 347 to 590 oe .",
    "the measured coercivity as a function of angle ( @xmath1 ) between the field and wire axis reveals that the coercive field decreases ( increases ) with angle , peaking at @xmath2 , for nanowire diameters smaller ( larger ) than 50 nm .",
    "`` template synthesis '' is an elegant chemical approach to the manufacturing of nanostructured materials , in particular for different kinds of nanowires  @xcite . in this paper , arrays of ni nanowires",
    "have been obtained by filling a porous polycarbonate membrane , wich contains a large number of cylindical holes with a narrow size distribution .",
    "characterization and understanding of the magnetic properties of nanowire arrays have been a challenge for years .",
    "some problems remain unclear .",
    "for example , there are still open questions about the mechanisms responsible for the magnetization reversal .",
    "the intrinsic propeties of nanowire arrays are directly related to the properties of the nanoporous template such as the relative pore orientations in the assembly , pore size and its distribution , as well as interpore distance .",
    "two reversal modes have been suggested as being important : curling and coherent rotation .",
    "the critical diameter between coherent rotation and curling is @xmath3 , ( @xmath4 is also called the coherent diameter ) , @xmath5 erg / cm is the exchange stiffness constant  @xcite , @xmath6 the saturation magnetization and q is a solution of a bessel equation  @xcite ( see section 3.1 ) .    for wire diameter @xmath7 ,",
    "the stoner - wohlfarth coherent rotation model applies  @xcite .    on the other hand for wire diameter @xmath8 ,",
    "the reversal occurs by inhomogenous reversal ( curling ) .",
    "increasing further the diameter until @xmath9 , domains may form within the wire and the magnetization reversal , thus , may occur by domain wall motion  @xcite .",
    "as other extrinsic or hysteretic properties , coercivity ( or coercive field ) @xmath10 , is strongly real - structure dependent .",
    "it is one of the most important properties of magnetic materials from the viewpoint of their technological utilization  @xcite and the understanding of its intrinsic mechanism is a permanent challenge . as different magnetization reversal mechanisms would give a different angular dependence of the coercivity @xmath10 , the measurement of @xmath11 would provide helpful information about the rotation mechanisms . here",
    ", @xmath12 is defined as the angle between the field direction and the wire axis ( fig.1 ) .",
    "for anisotropic , perfectly oriented polycrystalline magnets based on noninteracting particles , the coercive field @xmath10 should be equal to the anisotropy field @xmath13 .",
    "it is known  @xcite , however , that the coercive field measured in permanent magnet materials is typically one order of magnitude lower than the anisotropy field .",
    "it is basically accepted that the origin of this discrepancy lies in the distribution of local alterations of the magnetic properties due to a variety of microstructural features giving rise to magnetization reversal through a process wich includes a succession of mechanisms , as well as in the role played by interactions , either dipolar and/or exchange , during demagnetization .    aside from coherent rotation",
    ", important coercivity mechanisms are , curling , localized nucleation , and domain - wall pinning . with increasing size ,",
    "the nucleation mechanism in perfect ellipsoids of revolution changes from coherent rotation to curling .",
    "however , both coherent rotation and curling greatly overestimate the coercivity of most magnetic materials .",
    "nucleation refers to the onset of magnetization reversal and determines the coercivity in nearly defect - free magnets .",
    "most works have concentrated on individual wires  @xcite , few  @xcite reported on detailed measurements of @xmath11 for nanowire arrays .    in this work , we set out to study the magnetic properties of various types of nanowires possessing different diameters .",
    "nanowires used in this work are fabricated in polycarbonate membranes , with various diameters ( 15 nm , 50 nm , 80 nm and 100 nm ) in order to study the influence of the parameters such as pore shape and deposition process on the magnetic properties .",
    ", showing angles , @xmath14 and @xmath12 that @xmath15 and @xmath16 make with wire axis along @xmath17 , @xmath18.,width=326,height=285 ]    we infer from our study that basically four ranges of diameter values are important to determine the orientation of the easy axis with respect to the nanowire axis .",
    "the nanowire samples are prepared by electrodeposition into the pores of nuclear - track - etched polycarbonate membranes pcte ( see fig .",
    "2 ) using an autolab potentiostat employing a three - electrode configuration and an electrolyte contaning ion of the metals to be deposited  @xcite .        during sputtering ,",
    "a copper layer was sputter - deposited on one side of the polycarbonate membrane and used as the working electrode to fabricate an array of ni nanowires .",
    "a carbon plate and ag / agcl are used as the counter electrode and reference electrode , respectively .",
    "the work was carried out at a constant potential @xmath19 ( ag / agcl ) at room temperature .",
    "the following aqueous electrolytes used was nickel sulfate salt ( niso@xmath20.h@xmath21o)(44g / l ) in a boric acid solution ( h@xmath22bo@xmath22 ) ( 40g / l ) .",
    "the latter was used as a buffer .",
    "the study of the magnetic properties of the wire demanded that deposition should stop when there is no covering of the upper surface of the membrane by a polluting layer of the magnetic material . during the deposition process",
    ", the time dependence of electrical current was monitored and recorded .",
    "hence , the current intensity - time curve recorded during the electrodeposition process revealed four different regions ( see fig.3 ) :    - region i : coverage of the pore walls by the ions .",
    "+ - region ii : filling of the pore interior by the growth .",
    "+ - region iii : fast variation triggered by growth at the upper extremity of the pore and subsequent outgrowth beyond the pore .",
    "this occurs when the pores are completely filled with the material , and the electrodeposited material begins to form hemispherical caps over the nanowire ends ( see fig .",
    "+ - region iv is percolative growth outside the pores .",
    "+ attention has been focused on the region labeled ii because it is always the most complicated to reproduce .        to understand the mechanism of growth materials in porous membrane , and to estimate the time of filling in the pores , a small comparative study between two electrodes was made .",
    "we tack two copper electrodes in the same area , which was stuck on the first porous membrane ( electrode1 ) . according to the nickel growth curves on two electrodes ( current versus time )",
    ", we can clearly see the difference between the two curves because on the first membrane electrode ( electrode 1 ) , the deposit is made on small surfaces while on the another takes place over the entire surface .",
    "after some time , the two curves intersect in a single point , which shows that the pores are filled by materials and it is time for the emergence of a film on the surface of the membrane ( region iv , fig.3 ) .",
    "this also indicates that deposition occurs on two equal surfaces ( fig .",
    "figure 5b shows an image of a sample in which all the nanowires are misaligned perpendicularly to the polycarbonate membrane plane .",
    "the majority of nickel nanowires tilt randomly a few degrees , with respect to the polycarbonate membrane plane normal .",
    "the magnetic properties of the ni nanowire array are studied by vsm ( vibrating sample magnetometer ) , measurements which are performed at room temperature .",
    "the hysteresis loops at different angles between the magnetic field and the axis of the wires were measured .",
    "figure 6 shows four cases for the hysteresis loops with the external field @xmath23 , perpendicular and parallel to the sample plane ( i.e. parallel and perpendicular to the axis of the nanowires ) for 4 samples with different diameters of ( a ) @xmath24 , ( b ) @xmath25 , ( c ) 80 and ( d ) 100 nm respectively .",
    "the hysteresis loops and the coercivities change smoothly with the change in the applied field direction .",
    "the saturation field , when the field is applied parallel to the axis of the nanowire , is greater than that when the applied field is perpendiculary to the nanowire for the 15 nm diameter sample . on the other hand",
    "we see the opposite case for 80 and 100 nm diameter samples . for the 50 nm sample",
    "the parallel and perpendicular saturation fields are equal .",
    "( see fig .",
    "the coercivity dependence on the angles is shown in ( fig .",
    "7a ) demonstrating that coercivity decreases with the angle for nanowires that have 15 and 50 nm in diameter .",
    "in contrast , this is not the case of nanowires with 80 and 100 nm diameters .",
    "fig.7 ( a - b ) show the angular dependence of @xmath11 and @xmath26 ( squareness ) for ni nanowire arrays in pcte membranes , respectively .    however , @xmath11 shows a quite different behavior for , @xmath27=15 nm , 50 nm and @xmath27=80 nm , 100 nm ( fig .",
    "7a ) . for @xmath27=15 nm and 50 nm ,",
    "we observe a bell - type @xmath11 variations , but for @xmath2880 nm and 100 nm a bowl shape @xmath11 curve is observed .",
    "these results imply that there is a crossover transition in magnetization reversal mechanisms for @xmath29 50 nm .    as shown in ( fig .",
    "7b ) , for the two samples , 80 and 100 nm diameters , the squareness @xmath30 of ni nanowire array decreases with increase of angle , peaking at @xmath2 , which is the easy axis of the arrays as can be seen from the magnetization curves ( fig .",
    "6 ) .    on the other hand , for the sample of 15 nm diameter",
    "the easy axis is perpendicular to the wire axis .",
    "for the 50 nm diameter sample , easy magnetization axis is off to an angle of @xmath31 of the wire axis .",
    "in this work we can infer that single domain in the nanowires , and magnetization reversal modes can be modeled by homogeneous rotation when there is a critical size below which a particle remains in a single - domain state during switching , or inhomogeneous space dependent reversal @xmath32 when the particle size is larger then the critical size , but still in the single - domain regime .",
    "we assume that all our samples are in the single - domain regime  @xcite .      in principle , the magnetization configuration in a magnetic nanowire can be determined from the brown equations by minimizing the total free energy  @xcite . in bulk ferromagnetic materials ,",
    "the energy of the system can be minimized by forming multiple magnetic domains within which the magnetic moments are aligned .",
    "however , there is a critical size below which a particle remains in a single - domain state during switching .",
    "approximating our single domain by an ellipsoid of revolution , the critical radius @xmath33 ( minor axis , @xmath34 ) for a single - domain particle can be expressed  @xcite , and calculated by comparing the exchange energy averaged over the ellipsoid volume to the magnetostatic energy ; [ appendix a ] .",

    "the critical radius for a single - domain particle is dependent on the material parameters @xmath38 .",
    "if we consider the infinite cylindre case @xmath39 , in the single domain case there is a critical size between the two magnetization reversal processes .",
    "when the magnetic easy axis is aligned with the applied field , the critical radius @xmath40 for the transition between coherent and curling effect is defined by  @xcite :    @xmath41    where @xmath42 for a cylinder is the first maximum of the bessel equation @xmath43 , where @xmath44 is the ordinary .",

    "hence :    @xmath46    coherent and curling model rotation are illustrated in fig.8        for the theoretical explanation of these two magnetization modes , we consider the elongated single - domain particle with uniaxial anisotropy shown in fig.1 .      in the stoner - wohlfarth ( sw )",

    "still in the single - domain regime , magnetization reversal occurs by curling  @xcite . in the curling model ,",

    "these results suggest that the interwire coupling can not be neglected even for pcte membranes .",
    "in the case of a single domain wire , we have to consider three different field acting on the wire  @xcite :    @xmath97    where @xmath98 is the demagnetization field ( shape ) , @xmath13 is the effective anisotropy field and @xmath99 is the average dipolar field between the wires .    the demagnetization field ( shape ) @xmath98 of the individual wire",

    "therefore , the magnetization reversal was determined mainly by the curling mode , as shown in ( fig .",

    "the curling is predicted for @xmath114 nm , this value agrees with prior work on ordered ni nanowire arrays in alumina  @xcite where the critical diameter was 40 nm .",
    "the coherent rotation will occur for @xmath24 and 50 nm wires , which is consistent with results in ( fig .",
    "6a ) . in the same way",
    ", the squareness @xmath30 of hysteresis loops is measured for different orientations of wires as a function of the applied magnetic field .",
    "it can be seen that for large wire diameters the maximum @xmath30 is found when the magnetic field is applied parallel to the axis of the wire and the minimum occurs when the applied field is perpendicular to the axis of the wire ( see fig .",
    "this concurs with the abovementioned idea that for the larger wire diameters , the easy axis of magnetization is parallel to the axis of the wires . on the other hand , for the 50 nm of diameters of wires ( see fig .",
    "6.b ) , the behavior of @xmath30 indicates that we are in the crossover region where the axes begin to rotate from parallel to perpendicular to the wire axis .",
    "but in the wires of 15 nm of diameter , the behavior of @xmath30 indicates that we are in the perpendicular to the axes of the wires becomes the dominant easy axis of effective anisotropy .",
    "in conclusion , by means of theoretical studies and experimental measurements , we have investigated the reversal processes in ferromagnetic nanowires .",
