    "this paper builds on the previous papers @xcite which consider the problem of robust stability analysis for open quantum systems subject to perturbations in either the system hamiltonian or coupling operator , which together define the dynamics of the quantum system .",
    "the results of these papers can be regarded as extensions of the classical small gain theorem for robust stability to the case of quantum systems .",
    "the main contribution of this paper is a result which can be regarded as an extension of the classical popov criterion for absolute stability to the case of open quantum systems . in particular , we extend the result of @xcite , in which the perturbations to the system hamiltonian are uncertain quadratic perturbations , to obtain a corresponding popov robust stability result .",
    "the small gain theorem and the popov criterion for absolute stability are two of the most useful tests for robust stability and nonlinear system stability ; e.g. , see @xcite . both of these stability tests consider a lure system which is the feedback interconnection between a linear time invariant system and a sector bounded nonlinearity or uncertainty .",
    "the key distinction between the small gain theorem and the popov criterion is that the small gain theorem establishes absolute stability via the use of a fixed quadratic lyapunov function whereas the popov criterion relies on a lyapunov function of the lure postnikov form which involves the sum of a quadratic term and a term dependent on the integral of the nonlinearity itself .",
    "the small gain theorem can be used to establish stability in the presence of time - varying uncertainties and nonlinearities whereas the popov criterion only applies to static time - invariant nonlinearities . however , the popov criterion is less conservative than the small gain theorem .",
    "hence , we are motivated to obtain a quantum popov stability criterion in order to obtain less conservative results .",
    "the study of quantum feedback control theory has been the subject of increasing interest in recent years ; e.g. , see @xcite . in particular , the papers @xcite consider a framework of quantum systems defined in terms of a triple @xmath0 where @xmath1 is a scattering matrix , @xmath2 is a vector of coupling operators and @xmath3 is a hamiltonian operator .",
    "the paper @xcite then introduces notions of dissipativity and stability for this class of quantum systems . as in the papers @xcite , the results of this paper build on the stability results of @xcite to obtain robust stability results for uncertain quantum systems in which the quantum system hamiltonian is decomposed as @xmath4 where @xmath5 is a known nominal",
    "hamiltonian and @xmath6 is a perturbation hamiltonian , which is contained in a specified set of hamiltonians @xmath7 .    for this general class of uncertain quantum systems ,",
    "the paper first obtains a general abstract version of the popov stability criterion which requires finding a lyapunov type operator to satisfy an operator inequality .",
    "the paper then considers the case in which the nominal hamiltonian @xmath5 is a quadratic function of annihilation and creation operators and the coupling operator vector is a linear function of annihilation and creation operators .",
    "this case corresponds to a nominal linear quantum system ; e.g. , see @xcite . also , it is assumed that the perturbation hamiltonian is quadratic but uncertain . in this special case ,",
    "a robust stability stability criterion is obtained in terms of a frequency domain condition which takes the same form as the classical popov stability criterion .    the remainder of the paper proceeds as follows . in section [ sec : systems ] , we define the general class of uncertain quantum systems under consideration . in this section , we also present a general popov type stability result for this class of quantum systems . in section [ sec : quad_pert ]",
    ", we consider a class of uncertain quadratic perturbation hamiltonians . in section [ sec : linear ] , we specialize to the case of linear nominal quantum systems and obtain a robust stability result for this case in which the stability condition is a frequency domain condition in the same form as the classical popov stability condition . in section [ sec : example ] we present an illustrative example involving a quantum system arising from an optical parametric amplifier . in section [ sec : conclusions ] , we present some conclusions .",

    "the triple @xmath0 , along with the corresponding generators define the heisenberg evolution @xmath13 of an operator @xmath14 according to a quantum stochastic differential equation ; e.g. , see @xcite .",
