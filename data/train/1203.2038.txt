    "photoionization of atoms and molecules is one of the most fundamental quantum processes .",
    "it played a key role in the early days of quantum mechanics and has ever since been paving the way towards an improved understanding of the structure and dynamics of matter on a microscopic scale . today",
    ", kinematically complete photoionization experiments allow for accurate tests of the most sophisticated ab - initio calculations . besides , photoionization studies in a new frequency domain are currently becoming feasible by the availability of novel xuv and x - ray radiation sources @xcite , giving rise to corresponding theoretical developments ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "various photoionization mechanisms rely crucially on electron - electron correlations .",
    "prominent examples are single - photon double ionization as well as resonant photoionization .",
    "the latter proceeds through resonant photoexcitation of an autoionizing state with subsequent auger decay . in recent years",
    ", a similar kind of ionization process has been studied in systems consisting of two ( or more ) atoms .",
    "here , a resonantly excited atom transfers its excitation energy radiationlessly via interatomic electron - electron correlations to a neighbouring atom leading to its ionization .",
    "this auger - like decay involving two atomic centers is commonly known as interatomic coulombic decay ( icd ) @xcite .",
    "it has been observed , for instance , in noble gas dimers and water molecules @xcite . in metal oxides ,",
    "the closely related process of multi - atom resonant photoemission ( marpe ) was also observed @xcite .",
    "we have recently studied resonant two - center photoionization in heteroatomic systems and shown that this ionization channel can be remarkably strong @xcite . in particular",
    ", it can dominate over the usual single - center photoionization by orders of magnitude .",
    "besides , characteristic effects resulting from a strong coupling of the ground and autoionizing states by a relatively intense photon field were identified .",
    "also resonant two - photon ionization in a system of two identical atoms was investigated @xcite .",
    "we note that photoionization in two - atomic systems was also studied in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the inverse of two - center photoionization ( in weak external fields ) is two - center dielectronic recombination @xcite .     in the presence of an external laser field and two neighbouring atoms @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "apart from the direct photoionization of @xmath0 there are interatomic channels via resonant photoexcitation of the `` molecular '' system @xmath1-@xmath2 and subsequent icd .",
    ", scaledwidth=45.0% ]    in the present contribution , we extend our investigations of electron correlation - driven interatomic processes by considering photoionization of an atom @xmath0 in the presence of _ two _ neighbouring atoms @xmath1 ( see figure 1 ) .",
    "all atoms are assumed to interact with each other and with an external radiation field .",
    "we show that the photoionization of atom @xmath0 via photoexcitation of the system of two neighbouring atoms @xmath1 and subsequent icd can be by far the dominant ionization channel .",
    "moreover , we reveal the characteristic properties of the process with regard to its temporal dependence and photoelectron spectra . in particular , by comparing our results with those for photoionization in a system of two atoms @xmath0 and @xmath1 , we demonstrate the influence which the presence of the second atom @xmath1 may have .",
    "atomic units ( a.u . ) are used throughout unless otherwise stated .",
    "let us consider a system consisting of three atoms , @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 , where @xmath1 and @xmath2 are atoms of the same element and @xmath0 is different .",
    "we shall assume that all these atoms are separated by sufficiently large distances such that free atomic states represent a reasonable initial basis set to start with .",
    "let the ionization potential @xmath3 of atom @xmath0 be smaller than the excitation energy @xmath4 of a dipole - allowed transition in atoms @xmath1 and @xmath2 . under such conditions ,",
    "if our system is irradiated by an electromagnetic field with frequency @xmath5 , the ionization process of this system ( i.e. , essentially of the atom @xmath0 ) can be qualitatively different compared to the case when a single , isolated atom @xmath0 is ionized .",
    "indeed , in such a case @xmath0 can be ionized not only directly but also via resonant photoexcitation of the subsystem of @xmath1 and @xmath2 , with its consequent deexcitation through energy transfer to @xmath0 resulting in ionization of the latter .    in the following ,",
    "we consider photoionization in the system of atoms @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 in more detail . for simplicity",
    ", we suppose that the nuclei of all atoms are at rest during photoionization . denoting the origin of our coordinate system by @xmath6",
    ", we assume that the nuclei of the atoms @xmath1 and @xmath2 are located on the @xmath7-axis : @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "the coordinates of the nucleus of the atom @xmath0 are given by @xmath10 .",
    "the coordinates of the ( active ) electron of atom @xmath11 with respect to its nucleus are denoted by @xmath12 , where @xmath13 .",
    "the total hamiltonian describing the three atoms embedded in an external electromagnetic field reads @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the sum of the hamiltonians for the noninteracting atoms @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "we shall assume that the ( typical ) distances @xmath16 between the atoms are not too large , @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the speed of light , such that retardation effects in the electromagnetic interactions can be ignored .",
    "if transitions of electrons between bound states in atoms @xmath1 and @xmath2 are of dipole character , then the interaction between each pair of atoms @xmath19 ( with @xmath20 ) can be written as @xmath21 where @xmath22 and @xmath23 is the kronecker symbol .",
    "note that in ( [ inter_atomic ] ) a summation over the repeated indices @xmath24 and @xmath25 is implied .    in ( [ inter_atomic ] ) , @xmath26 denotes the interaction of the atom @xmath11 with the laser electromagnetic field .",
    "the latter will be treated as a classical , linearly polarized field , described by the vector potential @xmath27 , where @xmath28 , @xmath29 is the angular frequency and @xmath30 is the field strength .",
    "the interaction @xmath26 then reads @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the momentum operator for the electron in atom @xmath33 .",
    "our treatment of photoionization will be based on the following points :    oscillator strengths for dipole - allowed bound - bound transitions can be very strong .",
    "this means that , provided that the distances between all the atoms in our system are of the same order of magnitude , the interaction between atoms @xmath1 and @xmath2 is much more effective than the interaction between atoms @xmath0 and @xmath1 ( or @xmath0 and @xmath2 ) .",
    "besides , atoms @xmath1 and @xmath2 will , in general , couple much more strongly to a resonant laser field than atom @xmath0 . in what follows , we shall assume that the intensity of the laser field is relatively low such that the interaction between atoms @xmath1 and @xmath2 changes the states of the system more substantially than the coupling of these atoms to the laser field .",
    "therefore , we shall begin with building states of the @xmath1-@xmath2 subsystem in the absence of the field . the second step of our treatment will be to include the interaction of the @xmath1-@xmath2 subsystem with the laser field and , in the third step , we complete the treatment of ionization by considering the interaction of atom @xmath0 with both the laser field and the field - dressed subsystem of atoms @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "i. we denote the ground and excited states of the undistorted atoms @xmath1 and @xmath2 by @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath36 , @xmath37 , respectively .",
    "let the corresponding energies of these states be @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "the state @xmath40 of the @xmath1-@xmath2 subsystem can be expanded into the `` complete '' set of undistorted atomic states represented by the configurations ( i ) @xmath41 , ( ii ) @xmath42 , ( iii ) @xmath43 and ( iv ) @xmath44 . in the approximation , which neglects the interatomic interaction , the configurations @xmath42 and @xmath43",
    "are characterized by exactly the same value of the ( undistorted ) energy @xmath45 .",
    "the latter , in turn , strongly differs from the energies @xmath46 and @xmath47 which are characteristic for the configurations @xmath41 and @xmath44 , respectively .",
    "therefore , provided that the distance between the atoms is not too small , the interaction @xmath48 will strongly mix the configurations ( ii ) and ( iii ) only , while the other configurations ( i ) and ( iv ) will be affected only very weakly . taking this into account , it is not difficult to find the states of the subsystem of interacting atoms @xmath1 and @xmath2 which read @xmath49 these two - atomic states are normalized and mutually orthogonal .",
    "they posses energies given by @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 and @xmath53 , respectively , where @xmath54 .",
    "note that , for definiteness , @xmath55 has been assumed to be real and negative here , as will always be the case in our examples below ( see section  3 ) .",
    "let us now consider two interacting atoms @xmath1 and @xmath2 embedded in a resonant laser field .",
    "one can look for a state of such a system by expanding it into the new set of states given by eq .",
    "( [ states_of_bb ] ) , @xmath56 inserting the expansion ( [ bb_in_laser_1 ] ) into the corresponding wave equation , we obtain a set of coupled equations for the unknown time - dependent coefficients @xmath57 , @xmath58 , @xmath59 and @xmath60 : @xmath61 the system of equations ( [ bb_in_laser_2 ] ) can be greatly simplified by noting the following .",
    "first , all transition matrix elements of the interaction with the laser field , which involve the asymmetric state @xmath62 , are equal to zero and , thus , only the remaining three states can be coupled by the field .",
    "second , if we suppose that the frequency of the laser field is resonant to the transitions @xmath63 and that the field is relatively weak such that the non - resonant transitions @xmath64 are much less effective than the above resonant ones , the system ( [ bb_in_laser_2 ] ) effectively reduces to @xmath65 which can be readily solved by using the rotating wave approximation . assuming that the field is switched on suddenly at @xmath66",
    ", we obtain two solutions @xmath67 \\ ,",

    "the two solutions in ( [ bb_in_laser_5 ] ) correspond to two different initial conditions : at @xmath66 the system is either in the state @xmath73 or in @xmath74 .",
    "they are orthogonal to each other and form a `` complete '' set of field - dressed states of the subsystem @xmath1-@xmath2 .",
    "note also that we have neglected the spontaneous radiative decay of the excited state @xmath74 which , in our case , is justified as long as @xmath75 , where @xmath76 is the radiative width of @xmath74 .",
    "now , as the last step , we shall add atom @xmath0 to our consideration .",
    "let @xmath77 and @xmath78 , where @xmath79 is the electron momentum , be the ground and a continuum state of a single , isolated atom @xmath0 .",
    "the wavefunction of the total system @xmath0@xmath1-@xmath2 can be expanded into the following `` complete '' set of states @xmath80 here , the initial conditions are given by @xmath81 , @xmath82 and @xmath83 .",
    "the coupling of atom @xmath0 to both the subsystem @xmath1-@xmath2 and the laser field involves bound - continuum transitions which are normally much less effective than the bound - bound ones . for this reason",
    ", we may assume that the interactions of @xmath0 with the laser field and the @xmath1-@xmath2-subsystem is weak and consider ionization of atom @xmath0 in the lowest order of perturbation theory in these two interactions .",
    "as a result , by inserting the expansion ( [ ioniz_of_a_1 ] ) into the corresponding schrdinger equation we obtain @xmath84 where @xmath85 is the energy of the electron in the initial state @xmath77 of atom @xmath0 and @xmath86 is the electron energy after the emission .",
    "the probability for ionization of the three - atomic system , as a function of time , then reads @xmath87 note that equations ( [ ioniz_of_a_2 ] ) are readily solved analytically .",
    "however , the resulting expressions are somewhat lengthy and will not be given here .",
    "based on the results obtained in the previous section , let us now turn to the discussion of some aspects of photoionization in a system consisting of one lithium and two helium atoms .",
    "we suppose that in our three - atomic system the positions of the lithium and helium atoms are given by the vectors @xmath88 , @xmath89 and @xmath90 , respectively .",
    "our system is initially ( at time @xmath66 ) in its ground configuration and is irradiated by a monochromatic laser field .",
    "the field is linearly polarized along the @xmath7-axis and its frequency is resonant to the @xmath91 - @xmath92 transition in the he - he subsystem , i.e. , @xmath93 .",
    "choosing @xmath94 a.u .",
    "we obtain that the energy spitting @xmath95 between the states @xmath74 and @xmath62 of the he - he subsystem is @xmath96 ev . assuming a field strength of @xmath97 a.u . , the corresponding rabi frequency amounts to @xmath98 ev which is much less than @xmath99 .        in figure [ time - develop ] , we present the probability for ionization of our system as a function of time .",
    "the probability shows a non - monotonous behaviour in which time intervals , when the ionization probability rapidly increases , are separated by intervals , when the probability remains practically constant , reflecting oscillations of the electron populations with the rabi frequency @xmath100 between the ground and excited states of the he - he subsystem in a resonant electromagnetic field .    for comparison ,",
    "we also show in figure [ time - develop ] results for ionization of a single ( separated ) li atom and for ionization in a two - atomic li - he system . in the latter case ,",
    "the lithium atom is located at the origin ( @xmath88 ) and the coordinates of the helium atom are @xmath101 . the frequency of the laser field is assumed to be resonant to the @xmath102@xmath103 transition frequency of the corresponding bound states of a single he atom .",
    "in contrast to the single - atom ionization , in both the two- and three - atomic cases the ionization probability demonstrates a step - wise temporal development in which time intervals of rapid probability growth are followed by intervals of almost constant probability .",
    "we point out that in the three - atomic case , however , the size of these time intervals is shorter by a factor of @xmath104 .    compared to ionization of a single li atom , ionization in the two - atomic system is very strongly enhanced @xcite .",
    "when the three - atomic system is irradiated , the enhancement increases even further . in the range of small values of @xmath105 , where all ionization probabilities still increase monotonously ,",
    "this additional enhancement is equal to a factor of @xmath106 . at larger @xmath105 , however , when the two ionization probabilities exhibit step - wise behaviours , this additional enhancement due to the presence of the second he atom is reduced to a factor close to @xmath107 on average , as can also be seen in figure  [ time - develop ] .",
    "all the above features can be understood by noting the following :    \\i ) for the chosen set of parameters of our two- and three - center systems , the indirect channels of ionization , which involve two- or three - atomic correlations , are substantially stronger than the direct one .",
    "therefore , these correlations have a dominating effect on the ionization .",
    "\\ii ) at small @xmath105 , ionization in the two- and three - atomic systems is basically a two - step process : the first step is photoexcitation in the he or he - he subsystem and the second step is a consequent energy transfer to li . in each case , both these steps are described by basically the same dipole transition matrix element of the subsystem . since , compared to a single he atom , this dipole element in he - he is by @xmath104 larger than in he , one obtains a factor of 2 for the enhancement in the ionization amplitude , leading to a factor of @xmath106 in the ionization probability ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "\\iii ) at larger @xmath105 , when rabi oscillations show up , the second step `` saturates '' in the sense that the averaged probability to find the corresponding subsystem in the excited state becomes equal to 50% . therefore , the ionization probability in the three - atomic system is now larger ( on average ) by a factor of @xmath107 only .",
    "\\iv ) the origin of the step - wise behaviours of the ionization probabilities for the two- and three- atomic systems lies in the oscillations of the population between the ground and excited states in the he atom ( for the two - atomic case ) or in the he - he subsystem ( for the three - atomic case ) .",
    "the scale of these oscillation is set by the rabi frequency and , because in the he - he subsystem the latter is larger by a factor of @xmath104 , the corresponding time intervals are shorter by the same factor .",
    "additional information about the ionization process can be obtained by considering the energy spectrum of emitted electrons .",
    "such a spectrum is shown in figure [ spectra ] for the same systems and parameters as in figure [ time - develop ] and for a pulse duration of @xmath108 ps .    in panel ( a ) , we compare the energy spectra of electrons emitted in the process of photoionization of li - he - he and li - he systems . in both cases ,",
    "the main feature is the presence of three pronounced maxima .",
    "the origin of these peaks is similar to the splitting into three lines of the energy spectrum of photons emitted during atomic fluorescence in a resonant electromagnetic field @xcite .",
    "in such a field , the ground and excited levels of the he and he - he subsystems split into two sub - levels , which differ by the corresponding rabi frequency @xmath109 . as a result ,",
    "the resonant electronic correlations between these subsystems and the li atom lead to an energy transfer to the li which peaks at @xmath110 and @xmath111 .",
    "since , as was already mentioned , the rabi frequencies of these subsystems differ by a factor of @xmath104 , the magnitude of the separation between the corresponding maxima in panel ( a ) of figure [ spectra ] also differs by this factor .",
    "note also that the widths of these main maxima as well as the appearance of additional multiple maxima , seen in the figure , are related to the finiteness of the pulse duration ; the distance between the latter is roughly given by @xmath112 .",
    "the distinct influence , which the interatomic electron - electron correlations exert on the shape of the photoelectron spectra , is further highlighted in panel ( b ) of figure [ spectra ] .",
    "it compares the energy spectra of photoelectrons emitted from our li - he - he system and an isolated li atom . in the latter case ,",
    "there is only one main maximum , while the two main side peaks are missing , as one would expect ( the additional multiple maxima are related again to the finiteness of the pulse duration ) .",
    "we have studied resonant photoionization in a system @xmath0-@xmath1-@xmath2 consisting of three atoms , with two atoms @xmath1 of the same element and one different atom @xmath0 .",
    "we have shown that the mutual correlations among the atoms can largely enhance the ionization probability and distinctly modify also other properties of the process in a characteristic manner .",
    "in particular , as compared to the case of resonant photoionization in a two - atom system @xmath0-@xmath1 , it has been demonstrated that the presence of a second atom @xmath1 can ( i ) further enhance the photoionization process , ( ii ) change the time dependence of the ionization probability and ( iii ) move the side peaks in the photoelectron spectrum further apart .",
