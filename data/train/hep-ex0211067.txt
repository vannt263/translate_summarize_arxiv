    "the measurement of magnetic moments has been important in advancing our knowledge of sub - atomic physics since the famous 1921 paper of stern,@xcite which laid out the principles of what we now call the `` stern - gerlach experiment '' .",
    "the experimental and theoretical developments in the study of the electron s anomalous magnetic moment represent one of the great success stories of modern physics .",
    "the experimental accuracy has reached a relative accuracy of @xmath1 parts in @xmath2 ( parts per billion),@xcite and the theory is constrained by our knowledge of the fine - structure constant @xmath3 , rather than by the eight - order and tenth - order qed calculations.@xcite    the gyromagnetic ratio @xmath4 is defined by @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the spin angular momentum , and @xmath7 is the magnetic moment resulting from this angular momentum .",
    "the dirac equation for point particles predicts that @xmath8 , but radiative corrections increase the value at the part per mil level .",
    "the magnetic moment @xmath9 is defined as as @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the anomalous magnetic moment ( or simply the anomaly ) .",
    "when e821 began in the early 1980s , @xmath12 was known to 7.3 parts per million ( ppm).@xcite the e821 collaboration has reported four new measurements with relative accuracies of 13 , 5 , 1.3 and 0.7 ppm respectively.@xcite    to the level of the experimental accuracy , the electron anomaly can be described by the qed of @xmath13 and photons , with the contribution of heavier virtual particles entering at a level of around 3 ppb .",
    "the larger mass of the muon permits heavier virtual particles to contribute , and the enhancement factor is @xmath14 .",
    "the cern measurement observed the effect on @xmath12 of virtual hadrons at the 8 standard deviation level.@xcite the standard model value of @xmath12 consists of qed , strong interaction and weak radiative corrections , and a significant deviation from the calculated standard model value would represent a signal for non - standard model physics . at this conference",
    "we have heard much discussion of the theory of @xmath0,@xcite so it will not be discussed further in this talk.@xcite",
    "the method used in the third cern experiment and the bnl experiment are very similar , save the use of direct muon injection into the storage ring which was developed by the e821 collaboration .",
    "these experiments are based on the fact that for @xmath15 ( or more precisely @xmath16 ) the spin precesses faster than the momentum vector when a muon travels transversely to a magnetic field .",
    "the larmor and thomas spin - precession and the momentum precession frequencies are @xmath17 and the difference frequency gives the frequency with which the spin precesses relative to the momentum ,",
    "@xmath18 which is proportional to the anomaly , rather than to the full magnetic moment .",
    "a precision measurement of @xmath12 requires precision measurements of the precession frequency @xmath19 and the magnetic field , which is expressed as the free - proton precession frequency @xmath20 in the storage ring magnetic field .",
    "the muon frequency can be measured as accurately as the counting statistics and detector apparatus permit . the design goal for the nmr magnetometer and",
    "calibration system was a field accuracy of about 0.1 ppm .",
    "the @xmath21 which enters in eq .",
    "[ eq : omeganoe ] is the average field seen by the ensemble of muons in the storage ring , @xmath22 @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the azimuthal angle around the ring , @xmath25 are the coordinates at a single slice of azimuth centered at the middle of the 90 mm diameter muon storage region .",
    "@xmath26 is the moment ( multipole ) distribution of the muon beam , and couples multipole by multipole with the magnetic field multipoles . in the analysis , the field",
    "is averaged over the data collection time as well .",
    "the need for vertical focusing implies that a gradient field is needed , but the usual magnetic gradient used in storage rings is ruled out in our case . a sufficient magnetic gradient for vertical focusing would spoil the ability to use nmr to measure the magnetic field to the necessary accuracy .",
    "furthermore , it is very difficult to obtain adequate information on the higher moments of the muon distribution in the storage ring , so the presence of higher multipoles in @xmath27 is also undesirable for this reason .",
    "a round beam - profile was chosen , since sharp corners would imply large higher moments for @xmath26 .",
    "an electric quadrupole is used for vertical focusing , taking advantage of the `` magic ''  @xmath28 at which an electric field does not contribute to the spin motion relative to the momentum . in the presence of an electric and a magnetic field ,",
    "the spin difference frequency is given by @xmath29 , \\label{eq : tbmt}\\ ] ] which reduces to eq .",
    "[ eq : omeganoe ] in the absence of an electric field .",
    "note that for muons with @xmath30 in an electric field alone , the spin would follow the momentum vector .",
    "the arrangement of a magnetic dipole field combined with an electric quadrupole field is called a penning trap in atomic physics .",
    "however with a 14 m diameter and @xmath31 t weight , the scale of our trap is quite different from the usual one.@xcite    in order to meet the conditions discussed above , a goal of @xmath32 ppm uniformity of the @xmath27-field over the storage region was set and met .",
    "given the projected knowledge of the muon distribution , the allowable strength of the quadrupole and higher magnetic multipoles was also determined .",
    "a kick of about 0.1 tm is needed to bring the beam onto a stable orbit .",
    "this is achieved with three 1.7 m long ferrite - free kickers,@xcite which can be thought of as single - loop pulsed magnets carrying a current of 4,200 a. the minimum inductance achievable of 1.6 @xmath9h limited the peak current to 4200a , and resulted in a current - pulse width @xmath33 times greater than the cyclotron period of 150 ns .",
    "the phase space mis - match between the size of the inflector exit and the storage region , and multiple scattering in the inflector end , reduces the calculated injection efficiency to @xmath34% .",
    "the less than optimal kicker pulse further reduces the injection efficiency to about 7.3% .",
    "nevertheless the effective data rate per fill is almost a factor of 100 over that available in the final cern experiment,@xcite a factor of 10 coming from muon injection , and a factor of 10 coming from the ags intensity . with direct muon injection ,",
    "the injection - related background seen by the detectors is down by a factor of 50.@xcite    the @xmath0 ring functions as a weak focusing storage ring with the field index @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the electric quadrupole gradient .",
    "several @xmath37  -  values were used for data acquisition : @xmath38 and 0.122 , the latter two having been used for @xmath39 .",
    "the horizontal ( radial ) and vertical betatron frequencies are ( approximately ) given by @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the cyclotron frequency and the numerical values assume @xmath42 .",
    "the experimental signal is the @xmath13 from @xmath43 decay , which were detected by lead - scintillating fiber calorimeters.@xcite the time and energy of each event was stored for analysis offline .",
    "muon decay is a three - body decay , so the 3.1 gev muons produce a continuum of positrons ( electrons ) from the end - point energy down . since the highest energy @xmath13 are correlated with the muon spin , if one counts high energy @xmath13 as a function of time , one gets an exponential from muon decay modulated by the @xmath0 precession .",

    "fg : ft5pm ] ) shows a number of frequency components which can be understood from the beam dynamics in the ring.@xcite the most prominent frequencies in the residuals come from the coherent oscillation of the beam .    ) .",

    "[ fg : cbocartoon],width=166 ]    while the frequencies given in eq .",
    "[ eq : betafreq ] describe the motion of a single beam particle , the aperture mis - match between the inflector exit and the storage aperture , along with an imperfect kick and momentum dispersion in the ring , will cause the beam to undergo coherent radial oscillations .",
    "the detector acceptance depends on the radial position of the muon when it decays , so any coherent radial beam motion will amplitude modulate the decay @xmath13 distribution",
    ". the principal frequency will be the `` coherent betatron frequency '' @xmath47 which is the frequency a single fixed detector sees the beam moving coherently back and forth .",
    "this motion can be understood by the cartoon in fig .",
    "[ fg : cbocartoon ] .",
    "it is this cbo frequency and its sidebands from beating with the @xmath0 frequency which are clearly visible in the fourier spectrum of fig .",
    "[ fg : ft5pm ] .",
    "@xmath48 was chosen to avoid storage ring resonances , however the resulting cbo frequency was close to the second harmonic of @xmath49 putting the difference sideband close to @xmath50 .",
    "the @xmath37-value was changed for the 2001 data collection period to reduce our sensitivity to this difficulty .",
    "the cbo modified the positron time spectrum by @xmath51 @xmath52 where @xmath53 @xmath54 the terms @xmath55 and @xmath56 can cause artificial shifts in @xmath19 up to 4 ppm in individual detectors when not accounted for in the fitting procedure .",
    "the final fitting proceedure included these , and other effects such as pulse pile - up , detector gain changes and muon losses from the ring other than by decay .",
    "carried out with direct muon injection into the storage ring .",
    "the relative uncertainties are @xmath57 ppm ( 98 ) , @xmath58 ppm ( 99 ) , @xmath59 ppm ( 00 ) , where the number in parentheses is the year when the data were collected .",
    "all measurements are for @xmath60 .",
    "the three theory points use the lowest order hadronic contribution from dh98@xcite and the separate dehz evaluations@xcite from @xmath61 and @xmath62 hadronic data .",
    "the dh98 evaluation includes both @xmath61 and @xmath62 data .",
    "[ fg : results],width=326 ]    after consistent results were obtained in four independent ( and three different ) analysis procedures for @xmath19 , and two independent studies of @xmath20 , the offsets were removed and the value @xmath63 was obtained.@xcite excellent agreement was found with the previous measurements from brookhaven and from cern .",
    "the e821 results are displayed graphically in fig .",
    "[ fg : results ] along with the davier - hcker(98)@xcite first order hadronic contribution , and the most recent results from @xmath61-decay and @xmath62 annihilation reported at this conference.@xcite    now that the @xmath61-decay value of @xmath64 disagrees with the value obtained from electron positron annihilation , the situation is somewhat confused . while the path from hadronic electron - positron annihilation to a value of @xmath65 is somewhat more theoretically direct than from hadronic tau decay , the extraction of @xmath66 from tau - decay data has been carefully studied , with all the expected effects included .",
    "however , as we have heard at this meeting , there are systematic differences between other quantities when @xmath62 annihilation and @xmath61-decay are compared . since the low - energy @xmath62 data are dominated by the recent precise data from novosibirsk , it is fortunate that further work on @xmath62-annihilation is being carried out at frascati , belle and babar , and they will either confirm or disagree with the recent novosibirsk data .",
    "comparison with the new dehz evaluations@xcite shows either a 1.6 or 3 standard deviation discrepancy .",
    "an independent analysis@xcite of the @xmath62 data agrees well with the equivalent dehz analysis .",
    "thus the significance for an indication of new physics will have to wait for clarification of the correctness of the hadronic contribution .    nevertheless , a recent very conservative evaluation of the impact of @xmath0 on the constraining of supersymmetry parameters shows that even with the current uncertainties , @xmath0 already rules out a `` substantial region of ( susy ) parameter space ... that has not been probed by any previous experiment''.@xcite    the e821 collaboration has one additional data set , which was taken with @xmath39 in the ring",
    ". the experimental uncertainty will be on the order of 0.8 ppm .",
    "obviously we will have to stay tuned for further clarification on the hadronic contribution , and the analysis of the @xmath39 data ."
