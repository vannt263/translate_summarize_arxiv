    "spacetimes with more than three spatial dimensions have been attracting interest for long time .",
    "first proposals go back to kaluza and klein @xcite , in their attempt to unify electromagnetism with einstein gravity by proposing a theory with a compact fifth dimension of a size of the order of the planck length . later on",
    "the emphasis shifted to a ",
    "brane world \" picture @xcite with our world being confined to a subspace of higher - dimensional spacetime .",
    "more recently it was put forward , inspired also in @xcite , that at energy scales of the standard model matter can not propagate into extra dimensions whilst gravity on the other hand can permeate all over . within brane worlds extra dimensions may be compact but large @xcite , or infinite and warped @xcite .",
    "they have opened a rich and interesting phenomenological model - building aiming at solving long standing problems like the hierarchy and cosmological constant problem within high - energy physics @xcite , as well as testing models with observational data at the cosmological level @xcite .",
    "we should stress at this point that to implement the brane scenario one looks for physical mechanisms which localize higher dimensional fields to a lower dimensional brane .",
    "localization of gauge fields has turned out to be more difficult than that of scalar and spinors , however , some mechanisms have been developed in @xcite .",
    "the one in @xcite is a particularly simple scenario that was probed to localize electromagnetic fields .",
    "it consists of a single ( 3+@xmath0)-brane embedded in a ( 3+@xmath0 + 1)-dimensional space containing @xmath0 compact extra dimensions and one infinite and warped .",
    "this is a ( 5+@xmath0)-dimensional brane world that we refer to as a randall - sundrum ii model modified by @xmath0 extra compact dimensions ( rsiin ) . as for fermions some mechanisms",
    "have been developed in @xcite .",
    "we shall combine some of these ideas for our purposes below .",
    "it is generally assumed within brane models that relevant effects appear at high energies @xcite whereas low - energy effects have no chance to become relevant .",
    "this is not necessarily the case since some high - precision tests may be sensible to such tiny effects or else , at worst , it may be possible to set bounds for the different parameters of the models @xcite . in this paper",
    "we investigate two low - energy effects for rsiin .",
    "the first one involves determining the electromagnetic potentials of point charge in uniform motion in a 3-dimensional subspace of the single ( 3+@xmath0)-brane . considering that experiments in atomic physics are sensitive to small frecuency shifts down to 1 mhz @xcite , one can in principle use the atom as an instrument to measure the anti - de sitter radius @xmath1 .",
    "the second problem we investigate is a hydrogen atom , localized on the brane , where the binding electromagnetic field is just the one obtained in the first part .",
    "we have calculated the @xmath2 splitting coming from the presence of the extra dimensions that corresponds to the lamb shift associated to qed .",
    "this has allowed us to set bounds for the parameter of the scenario , namely the anti - de sitter radius or , equivalently , the tension of the brane . in the present work we provide details and extend some of the results of a previous letter @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we describe the rsiin brane world and describe the localization mechanism for the electromagnetic and spinor fields .",
    "section iii is devoted to calculate the effective electromagnetic potentials for a test point charge in uniform motion thus providing details and generalizing the static results of @xcite . in section",
    "iv the @xmath2 shift of a localized hydrogen atom is calculated completely . finally in section",
    "v we focus on the discussion of our results as well as some perspectives .",
    "now we describe the brane world we use in the present work . looking for a localization mechanism for gauge fields as due to the gravity associated with the brane it was proved in @xcite that the following setting would accomplish such task : a single ( 3+@xmath0)-brane embedded in a ( 3+@xmath0 + 1)-dimensional space so that space - time is ( @xmath3)dimensional with @xmath0 compact dimensions and one infinite and warped .",
    "we call such a scenario rsiin .",
    "much as in the case of the randall - sundrum models to solve einstein equations the brane tension and the negative bulk cosmological constant must be fine - tuned .",
    "the resulting metric is @xcite @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the four - dimensional minkowski metric , @xmath6 @xmath7 @xmath8 $ ] are compact coordinates and @xmath9 are the sizes of the compact dimensions .",
    "@xmath1 is the anti - de sitter radius .",
    "since our purpose is to study low energy - physics effects and hence the situation where electromagnetic fields and spinors are localized to a 3-dimensional subspace of the ( 3+@xmath0)-brane we next describe how this works in rsiin .",
    "there has been extensive discussion about the localization of gauge fields in brane - worlds @xcite .",
    "here we just reproduce the proposal in @xcite for the rsiin scenario .",
    "consider a gauge field @xmath10 , with action @xmath11 for low - energies , hence @xmath9 small , and in the background ( [ ecu : fon ] ) , we truncate this action to the zero kaluza - klein modes of the compact @xmath0 dimensions .",
    "the effective 4-dimensional electromagnetic action turns out to be @xmath12 hence @xmath13 is normalizable , up to a normalization factor proportional to @xmath14 . if @xmath15 there is no localized gauge field , but for @xmath16 the gauge field localizes on the brane and electrodynamics on it becomes 4-dimensional at large distances @xmath17 .",
    "we proceed next to discuss the spinor localization in rsiin .      as in the case of the electromagnetic field in rsiin ,",
    "the observed 4-dimensional fields are the zero modes of higher dimensional ones . for explicit calculations we shall be considering @xmath0=1,2 , namely 6- and 7-dimensional spacetime unless we specify otherwise , and hence 8-component spinors .",
    "the analysis should hold with the adequate generalizations for arbitrary @xmath0 .",
    "we combine the localization mechanism of @xcite designed to work in 5-dimensional spacetime for massive fermions with the projection analysis of @xcite that allows one to identify 4-component spinors out of the higher dimensional ones .    to begin with a domain wall",
    "is considered to be produced by some scalar field @xmath18 .",
    "the domain wall separates two regions in the non - compact extra dimension @xmath19 .",
    "explicitly the region @xmath20 , @xmath21 separates from @xmath22 , @xmath23 .",
    "one introduces a yukawa coupling between the spinor and the scalar @xmath24 . for a given sign of the yukawa coupling @xmath25 the zero modes have chirality defined .",
    "in general there is no dependence on the details of the profile of the scalar field across the wall .",
    "it turns out to be convenient to organize the chiral spinors into one field @xmath26 .",
    "the mass term is given by @xmath27 . at low - energies , and",
    "hence small @xmath9 , we truncate this action to the zero kaluza - klein modes of the compact @xmath0 dimensions .",
    "the resulting fermion action reads , after an adequate internal rotation @xcite , @xmath28+g\\chi \\tau_1+\\mu\\tau_2\\right)\\psi , \\\\",

    "we restrict to the cases @xmath33 . in this way @xmath34 are six @xmath35 dirac matrices . the dirac equation which follows from this action in the background ( [ ecu : fon ] )",
    "has the form @xmath36\\psi=0 \\,.\\ ] ] since the details of the profile of the scalar filed across the wall play no role for the localization of fields , we use an infinitely thin wall approximation . in this limit",
    "one has @xmath37sign@xmath38 .",
    "the components @xmath39 are given in terms of the frames components through @xmath40 . where the only non zero frames components are @xmath41 with @xmath42 , the indices in the coordinate @xmath43 refer to @xmath33 and underlined indices refer to the orthonormal frame .",
    "the non - vanishing ones are @xmath44 when @xmath45 and @xmath46 there are no true localized modes but a metastable massive state @xcite .",
    "we assume such conditions hold for our @xmath18 and ( [ ecu : dir1 ] ) becomes @xmath47\\psi=0 \\,.\\ ] ] we proceed now by choosing dirac matrices in the following form : @xmath48 , @xmath49 and @xmath50 . a convenient rearrangement for @xmath26 is @xcite : @xmath51 because of the presence of @xmath52 , from the point of view of 3-dimensional space , the spinor represents a quantum point - like particle .",
    "now , the fundamental representation for @xmath26 corresponds to the eigenvalues @xmath53 and @xmath54 for @xmath55 , thus we use @xmath56 as in @xcite . in terms of @xmath57",
    "the equation([ecu : dir2 ] ) translates into a set of coupled equations , @xmath58 by taking @xmath59 and after eliminating @xmath60 in the system ( [ ecu:1])-([ecu:2 ] ) one obtains a second order equation for @xmath61 that is given by @xmath62    > from here on the same argument of @xcite holds and there is a metastable state .",

    "one has @xmath68 overall , for a given scalar field fulfilling the conditions above , that is to say @xmath69 , it is possible to envisage a long life - time for the spinor to be localized on the brane .",
    "we assume this is the case and hence the role of the extra dimensions in rsiin at low - energies for a localized hydrogen atom we are interested in is reduced to an effective electromagnetic potential for a point - like proton which we describe in the following section .",
    "as a first step in the calculation of the energy levels corrections for hydrogen atoms one has to find the effective electrostatic potential that replaces the coulomb potential . in @xcite we have presented the electrostatic potential produced by a point charge localized in the single brane .",
    "a uniformly moving 4d point charge source will be considered as follows @xmath70 here @xmath71 is the charge density and @xmath72 is the velocity of the source and @xmath73 is a parameter that turns out to be useful in regularizing a delta product later on so we are interested at the end in the limit @xmath74 .",
    "for completeness we briefly recall the calculation leading to the photon green s function as given in the reference @xcite . for the background ( [ ecu : fon ] ) the maxwell equations on the right to the brane yield @xmath75 here we use the gauge @xmath76 , @xmath77 .",
    "@xmath78 and @xmath79 is the 4d dalambertian .",
    "the term containing @xmath80 is pure gauge on the brane so we just drop it from now on .",

    "namely , by assuming a null result from the experiment that could be directly associated to the extra dimensions we have @xcite @xmath182 and with the use of the explicit formulae obtained above we can estimate bounds for @xmath1 .",
    "notice this has the advantage with respect the use for comparison of the uncertainty in the measurement that one does not need to consider other important effects as the charge radius of the proton , recoil effect , among others , which are indeed less than @xmath183 @xcite . using the value of @xmath184 @xcite",
    "the following results follow : @xmath185 for @xmath33 , respectively .",
    "in this work we have investigated low - energy effects associated to the presence of extra dimensions .",
    "the brane world considered here is a randall - sundrum like containing a @xmath186-brane embedded in a @xmath187 space with @xmath0 compact and one warped infinite extra dimensions or rsiin . apart from its hybrid character having both compact and non - compact extra dimensions this model is interesting because it localizes the zero mode gauge field due to the presence of the compact dimensions @xcite .",
    "the effects we have considered are i ) the effective electromagnetic potentials of a point charge moving uniformly along the non compact directions of the @xmath186-brane and ii ) the lamb shift for a hydrogen atom localized in the same subspace .",
    "we took a test point charge as seen from the 4d spacetime perspective , moving uniformly along a timelike straight geodesic spatially contained along the non compact directions of the @xmath186-brane .",
    "some comments regarding the stability of such geodesic are in order . although unstable such geodesics are interesting whenever the tunneling time into the extra dimensions is large enough .",
    "as it is clear from our discussion above for the spinor localization based on @xcite for rsiin this can be the case quantum mechanically .",
    "it has also been proved for other similar scenarios in @xcite .",
    "thus it is reasonable to think in terms of a semiclassical approximation leading to such a tunneling effect with long life - time for our uniformly moving particle .",
    "we assume then that our description of the classical test charge is the leading order of the corresponding semiclassical approximation for the quantum situation .",
    "moreover , at high enough energies , a particle gets excited along the compact extra dimensions and in this case the instability of the geodesic is removed .",
    "our results summarize as follows . at low energies our point charge in uniform motion produces electromagnetic potentials given by the zero mode regarding the compact extra dimensions but include light massive modes associated to the non - compact dimension .",
    "they reduce to the standard liennard - wiechert potentials in 4d minkowski spacetime at long distances , as determined by the characteristic scale of the scenario @xmath1 . remarkably below this scale",
    "they differ from the standard ones and become finite at the position of the point charge .",
    "they can easily be seen to produce finite self energies for the point particles as calculated in 4d namely @xmath188 and @xmath189 .",
    "the details of the potentials for short distances depend on the number of extra dimensions @xmath0 .",
    "it is tempting to explain the finiteness of the electromagnetic potentials and self energy due to the fact that our charge looks point - like in 3d but it is actually effectively smeared along the compact extra dimensions at low energies due to the zero mode approximation in the compact dimensions for the electromagnetic fields .",
    "indeed as @xmath190 in ( [ ecu : po1 ] ) and ( [ ecu : po2 ] ) such finiteness is lost .",
    "however it must be observed that for finite @xmath134 actually the standard divergences for the coulomb potential and self - energy are regained in the limit @xmath191 .",
    "so the finiteness is better described as a combined effect of the presence of the compact and warped extra dimensions . indeed not having compact dimensions",
    "amounts to an impossibility of localizing the particle s electromagnetic field to the brane .    as for the hydrogen atom model",
    "we take a dirac equation in rsiin for which we have adopted the localization mechanism of the spinor as given in @xcite . here",
    "we pick the zero mode in both compact and non - compact extra dimensions for the localized spinor and couple it with the static form of the time component of the effective liennard - wiechert potential we have determined in the present work , eqs .",
    "( [ ecu : po1 ] ) and ( [ ecu : po2 ] ) . for the static case",
    "the effective potential can be seen as differing from the standard 4d coulomb potential by an additive term containing a different power of the spatial separation between the point like charges .",
    "the power depends upon the number @xmath0 of compact extra dimensions . by making use of a perturbation analysis in terms of this deviation from the coulomb potential it was possible to calculate a @xmath2 shift which we compared with experimental lamb shift data @xmath184 @xcite . assuming the effect of the extra dimensions @xmath192 is smaller than the lambs s @xmath183 yields the bounds to the length scale of the scenario : @xmath193 for @xmath33 , respectively .",
    "notice we estimated such bounds by comparing it with the lamb shift itself and not with the experimental uncertainty in its measurement .",
    "so no other effects like the charge radius of the proton or the recoil effect , among others , are relevant since they are indeed less than @xmath183 .",
    "of course one could insist on using such uncertainty but no significant improvement is obtained because although the bounds improve one has then to incorporate the afore mentioned extra effects that essentially cancel the improvement .",
    "furthermore our upper bounds for @xmath1 lie in the fermi range so no conflict with macroscopic electromagnetism tests is expected . to go beyond such scale",
    "say scattering experiments one would actually require a quantum field approach or qed on rsiin which remains an interesting open problem .",
    "overall both of our results add evidence on how known low - energy phenomena can be used to probe models with extra dimensions that were originally thought to be testable only at high energies while being automatically compatible with standard low - energy physics .",
    "remarkably , finiteness of the electromagnetic potentials and self - energy has led in the past to new ideas as for instance the proposal that gravity regulates the self - energy of a point particle @xcite or a non linear electrodynamics of born and infeld @xcite implementing the finiteness of the electric field @xcite . in light of our results it would be of interest to study other singular problems in standard electrodynamics as the radiation reaction problem . in this regard",
    "higher dimensional flat spacetimes have been considered @xcite but curved hybrid scenarios like rsiin have not to the best of our knowledge . as for the quantum extensions it would be interesting to study further the finite character we have found here for the potentials and self - energy of a point charge quantum mechanically and its possible bearing on qed in particular high precision tests @xcite or possibly other gauge fields of the standard model @xcite to see whether they may add something to realistic brane world models @xcite .",

    "<S> we found that the electromagnetic potentials of the point charge match standard liennard - wiechert s at large distances but differ from them close to it . </S>",
    "<S> these are finite at the position of the charge and produce finite self - energies . </S>",
    "<S> we also studied a localized hydrogen atom and take the deviation from the standard coulomb potential as a perturbation . </S>",
    "<S> this produces a lamb shift that is compared with known experimental data to set bounds for the parameter of the model . </S>",
    "<S> this work provides details and extends results reported in a previous letter . </S>",
