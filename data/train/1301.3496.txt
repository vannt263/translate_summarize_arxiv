    "an implicit caveat on any experimental implementation of this proposal is that all experimental runs must be independent and the results after a statistically significant number of runs must represent an unbiased sampling from the joint probability distribution ( [ eq : hiddenvariabledistribution ] ) ; in the case where the latter is tailored to the nine projective measurement constructed from ( [ eq : nineprojectors ] ) .",
    "later we will discuss how losses and detector inefficiencies may allow a joint probability distribution conditioned on a hidden variable to violate inequality ( [ dagandpawelcorrelationineqaulity ] ) . in both scenarios",
    "we use a single photon heralded source which will alow us to monitor photon losses .",
    "previous experiments , @xcite , produce pairs of polarization entangled photons in the singlet state via parametric down conversion and subsequently rerouted one photon to an auxiliary detector ` detector @xmath35 ' .",
    "post selecting on whether this auxiliary detector clicks creates a heralded single photon , see the supplementary material for a detailed schematic .",
    "any desired initial state can be synthesized using polarizing beam splitters to combine the two spatial modes and half wave plates to transform the polarization components inside a single spatial mode .",
    "we introduce a single detector for each mode ( we will use the label : detector @xmath36 , for @xmath37 ) .",
    "two scenarios are considered : in the first scenario there are no losses and detector @xmath36 will click whenever a photon is in the corresponding mode @xmath38 . in the second scenario",
    "we will allow for inefficient detectors .",
    "we revisit this scenario later .",
    "it is convenient to identify the three orthogonal modes with rays @xmath39 and @xmath40 from equation ( [ eq : nineprojectors ] ) .",
    "if detector @xmath36 clicks then we record @xmath41 and using equation ( [ eq : dichotomus ] ) we assign a value @xmath42 to the corresponding dichotomous observable .",
    "the correlations of two dichotomous observables are given by : @xmath43 the second line follows because ( with unit probability ) either both @xmath4 and @xmath22 are equal to @xmath44 or alternatively precisely one of them is equal to @xmath31 .",
    "we only count results from experimental runs where a single detector clicks coincidentally with detector @xmath35 .",
    "this implies that in all events contributing to equation ( [ eq : correlations ] ) the sum of the measurement outcomes for the dichotomous observables ( during a single run ) is equal to @xmath31 ( in the first instance @xmath45 ) .",
    "furthermore when @xmath4 and @xmath22 correspond to orthogonal modes we discount experimental runs where @xmath46 causing @xmath47 . in these circumstances",
    "it is pertinent that the projectors @xmath48 , @xmath49 and @xmath50 in equation ( [ eq : nineprojectors ] ) form a complete basis for the 3-dimensional hilbert space .",
    "when sampling only from events where a single detector clicks , the measured correlations : @xmath51 obey the completeness relation . under these experimental circumstance",
    "it is optional whether the above correlations need to be measured .",
    "a similar relation holds for the complete basis @xmath52 , @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "we clarify that this completeness relation is not a fundamental assumption for deriving equation ( [ dagandpawelcorrelationineqaulity ] ) , rather it is an optional simplification of the experiment which is available because these types of experiments post select on events where a single detector clicks coincidentally with detector @xmath35 .",
    "this is a natural assumption in most experiments .",
    "repeated runs of this experimental configuration can be used to measure the correlations @xmath55 , @xmath56 and @xmath57 . a full experiment capable of measuring all the correlation in inequality ( [ dagandpawelcorrelationineqaulity ] ) can be obtained by adding standard optical elements ; specifically half wave plates and polarizing beam splitters .",
    "if we pass the input modes @xmath48 , @xmath58 and @xmath59 through a series of half wave plates and polarizing beam splitters then we can output the orthogonal modes for any three rays @xmath60 and @xmath61 which are a linear combination of @xmath39 and @xmath40 , and form a basis for the 3-dimensional hilbert space . at every stage of the experiment each detector",
    "is aligned to detect photons in a single mode .",
    "it is assumed that this detector will click if the photon is in the corresponding mode .",
    "a schematic of the sequence of optical elements and measurements needed to obtain all the correlations in inequality ( [ dagandpawelcorrelationineqaulity ] ) is depicted in figure [ fig : schematic ] .",
    "the physical implementation of this experiment will require exact details regarding the sequence of half wave plates and polarizing beam splitters needed to appropriately mix the two different polarization modes within a single spatial mode and subsequently mix the spatial modes .",
    "we leave the nuances of the setup to the discretion of an experimental group .",
    "however in the supplementary material we give a more detailed account of an explicit realization as a proof of principle that the schematic given in figure [ fig : schematic ] is physically realizable using an adaptation of lapkiewicz et al.s design @xcite .",

    "this follows from equation ( [ eq : cycles ] ) .",
    "the precise sequence of optical elements @xmath62 are recorded in the supplementary material . in this",
    "schematic when two consecutive stages of the experiment involve measuring the same mode , @xmath38 , and the beam line of mode @xmath38 is unobstructed between the points at which these two measurements are made , we assume the physical implementation will measure the ( same ) mode @xmath38 in two different contexts . ]    it is implicitly assumed that at any stage of the experiment ; if a given mode s beam line is not interrupted by an optical element then there is perfect transmission of any photon ( amplitude component ) in this mode . this occurs regardless of whether the other two modes pass through a half wave plate or are obstructed .",
    "notice that according to figure [ fig : schematic ] , we first measure the mutual correlations of the dichotomous observables , @xmath64 corresponding to orthogonal modes @xmath48 , @xmath58 and @xmath59 . subsequently in subfigure 5 ) we need to measure @xmath65 , however during the intermediary stages the beam line of mode @xmath58 has been interrupted .",
    "this introduces a source of error .",
    "we must recreate the mode @xmath58 before measuring @xmath66 .",
    "we can not be certain that in both instances we are measuring the precisely the same orthogonal mode @xmath58 .",
    "correspondingly we introduce a new label @xmath67 to distinguish between the observable @xmath17 in subfigure 1 ) and the observable @xmath67 measured in subfigure 5 ) of figure [ fig : schematic ] .    in order to find the correlation term @xmath66 we set up the experiment with the intention of measuring @xmath67",
    "however we create a time delay , @xmath68 , for all photons in mode @xmath58 by increasing the optical path length at the point where mode @xmath58 is first created .",
    "this will ensure that photons originally in mode @xmath58 will reach a detector @xmath68 seconds later than the click of the heralding detector , @xmath69 . whereas photons originally in modes @xmath48 and @xmath59 will result in detection events where @xmath69 clicks coincidently with one of the other three detectors .",
    "we now can calculate the correlation term @xmath66 using equation ( [ eq : correlations ] ) and assigning outcome @xmath70 and @xmath71 to all runs where detector @xmath2 clicks coincidently with the auxiliary detector @xmath69 , and analogously letting outcome @xmath72 and @xmath73 correspond to all runs where one of the other two detectors clicks @xmath68 seconds later than the auxiliary detector @xmath69 .",
    "this procedure generalizes to measuring the correlations @xmath74 and @xmath75 , see the schematic [ fig : schematic ] .",
    "we highlight that the physical implementation of this scheme will involve changing the ( path length of the ) beam line depicted in subfigure 5 ) of figure [ fig : schematic ] . in theory",
    "any operation preformed on a photon originally created in mode @xmath76 will have no effect on the outcome of the compatible observable @xmath77 ; in practice imperfect reconstruction of mode @xmath78 ( and the orthogonal mode @xmath79 ) may lead to violation of the no - disturbance principle . as a result",
    "there should be a careful analysis of the number of events where detector @xmath2 clicks @xmath68 seconds later than the heralding detector .",
    "these events where the photon is recoded to have been in both modes @xmath58 and @xmath79 , equivalently @xmath80 , indicate a violating of the exclusivity condition .",
    "finally we highlight that equation ( [ eq : cycles ] ) implies we do not need to collect data during the experimental stages depicted in subfigures 1 ) and 3 ) of figure [ fig : schematic ] .",
    "we have drawn a vertical line through the detectors whenever it is not necessary to collect data .",
    "we include these stages in the schematic because it is important to comprehensively set up all the measurement configurations .",
    "we need to ensure the orthogonal modes have the same relative orientations ( and orthogonality relations ) as the projectors in equation ( [ eq : nineprojectors ] ) .",
    "this makes it essential to setup all stages of the experiment .",
    "errors will arise from imperfect alignment of half wave plates .",
    "this will cause some of the modes to be be misaligned with the rays in equation ( [ eq : nineprojectors ] ) . in this case we will be testing inequality ( [ dagandpawelcorrelationineqaulity ] ) using projective measurement along directions which do not perfectly match the list in equation ( [ eq : nineprojectors ] ) .",
    "the nine direction in equation ( [ eq : nineprojectors ] ) corresponded to a theoretically optimal set of projective measurements for testing inequality ( [ dagandpawelcorrelationineqaulity ] ) .",
    "the errors introduced by half wave plate misalignment will make it more difficult to experimentally violate this inequality .",
    "however they will not invalidate any experimental results which directly demonstrate violation .",
    "we highlight that instead of measuring the correlation term @xmath81 using the time delay of the photon to register the event @xmath72 , we could have modified inequality ( [ dagandpawelcorrelationineqaulity ] ) , @xmath82 + \\langle   a_5 a_2'\\rangle + \\langle   a_6 a_8'\\rangle + \\langle   a_6 a_3'\\rangle   +   \\langle a_9\\rangle   \\ge -1 - \\epsilon_a - \\epsilon_b - \\epsilon_c,\\ ] ] to include the error terms @xmath83 .",
    "this would allow us to treat the correlation term @xmath84 identically to all other previous measurements .",
    "however the error term @xmath85 would require us to redo the above analysis of @xmath81 in the almost identical case of @xmath86 ; again using the time delay of the photon to register an event where @xmath87 and the clicks of detector @xmath88 to record events where @xmath89 .",
    "after collecting the data we can choose to use it to evaluate inequality ( [ eq : errortermineq ] ) and/or inequality ( [ dagandpawelcorrelationineqaulity ] ) ; in practice these two experiments are equivalent up to postprocessing of the data .",
    "this approach of measuring the modified inequality ( [ eq : errortermineq ] ) closely mirrors ideas from lapkiewicz et al.s experiment @xcite . in this context",
    "it has been argued that experimentally testing inequality ( [ eq : errortermineq ] ) does not constitute a proper test of a noncontextual inequality @xcite .",
    "the controversy arises because mode @xmath58 which is originally measured in the context of modes @xmath48 and @xmath59 must be reconstructed before we measure the correlation term @xmath84 ; this has instigated a debate on whether experimental implementations of inequality ( [ eq : errortermineq ] ) do measure precisely the same observable @xmath17 in two different contexts . in the spirit of lapkiewicz",
    "et al.s experiment @xcite the condition for claiming observables @xmath17 and @xmath67 are the same measurement in two different contexts is that they return identical empirical results ; if they do not the error term @xmath85 will compensate .",
    "we note that using this approach the data collected ( and therefore correlations measured ) is identical no matter how it is post processed ; and that if there is still ambiguity then we can evaluate both inequalities to determine whether they are empirically equivalent .",
    "any implementation of this proposal faces more critical problems from the key assumption that results collected during this experiment represent an unbiased sampling from the joint probability distribution ( [ eq : hiddenvariabledistribution ] ) .",
    "this requires us to make subsidiary assumptions about the states of undetected photons unless the detection efficiency is about a minimum thresh hold value @xmath90 .",
    "a detailed calculation is given in the next section .",
    "under these conditions , the above procedure could be used to experimentally test of the inequality from ref .",
    "this implementation would probe one of the foundational principles distinguishing quantum mechanics from classical realistic descriptions of the world .",
    "furthermore if this test reveals contextual behavior in an indivisible spin one system then the behavior can not stem from entanglement .",
    "this result complements work done on the kcbs inequality @xcite as well as the thirteen projector state independent inequality from ref .",
    "we present numerical studies which indicate inequality ( [ dagandpawelcorrelationineqaulity ] ) is violated by @xmath91 of states in a 3-level system .",
    "this makes an experimental test less sensitive to state preparation .",
    "in this section we revisit the mathematical details required to derive inequality ( [ dagandpawelcorrelationineqaulity ] ) and the detector efficiency threshold needed to beat the no - detection loophole in this experiment .",
    "inequality ( [ dagandpawelcorrelationineqaulity ] ) is based on nine projective measurements whose compatibility relations are provided by orthogonality and depicted in figure [ fig : dagandpawelsgraph ] .",
    "the nine vertices in figure [ fig : dagandpawelsgraph ] can be identified with projective measurements @xmath92 , along the following nine rays in a 3-dimensional hilbert space : @xmath93 it is possible to assign values of @xmath44 or @xmath35 to the corresponding projectors @xmath94 , in such a way that the outcomes @xmath95 and @xmath96 are exclusive and if a projector , @xmath97 , appears in two different orthogonal sets then it is assigned the same consistent value in each set @xcite .",
    "it follows that for any non - contextual realistic theory , where measurement statistics can be encapsulated in a hidden variable strategy @xmath14 as in ( [ eq : hiddenvariabledistribution ] ) , these nine - projectors satisfy : @xmath98    the exclusivity relations of the dichotomic observables defined in equation ( [ eq : dichotomus ] ) are inherited directly from the exclusivity relations of the corresponding projectors , @xmath99 . hence the principles and principles and assumptions behind inequalities ( [ dagandpawelcorrelationineqaulity ] ) and ( [ eq : dagandpawelprojectorineq ] ) are equivalent .",
    "we can derive inequality ( [ dagandpawelcorrelationineqaulity ] ) directly from this result , by using equation ( [ eq : dichotomus ] ) to replace each of the projectors in inequality ( [ eq : dagandpawelprojectorineq ] ) by the corresponding dichotomous observable .",
    "we note that any violation of the exclusivity conditions may lead to higher violations of inequality ( [ dagandpawelcorrelationineqaulity ] ) @xcite .",
    "these inequalities are violated by all quantum state @xmath33 except the maximally mixed state , provided we choose the basis for the 3-dimensional hilbert space appropriately .",
    "a key assumptions in our proposed experimental test of inequality ( [ dagandpawelcorrelationineqaulity ] ) was that the results collected during a statistically significant number of runs represented an unbiased sampling from the joint probability distribution ( [ eq : hiddenvariabledistribution ] ) . in the presence of no - detection events",
    "however this assumption needs to be re - examined .    in any realistic experiment",
    "there will be runs where the photon is lost and none of the detectors click .",
    "these losses are caused by reflections off half wave plates and detector inefficiencies . in the proposed experimental scheme",
    "we only collect data from experimental runs where a single detector clicks ; this automatically discounts any non - detection events . to claim the results of the proposed experiment",
    "represent an unbiased sampling from the joint probability distribution ( [ eq : hiddenvariabledistribution ] ) we must assume the probability of loosing a photon is not correlated with the measurement outcome .",
    "in other words we must assume something about the state of the photon we never measured .",
    "here we describe how efficient the experiment must be in order to eliminate this assumption .    without loss of generality we can assume all photons",
    "are lost at the detector .",
    "we attribute an efficiency @xmath100 to each of the three detectors .",
    "we want to make our results independent of the distribution of photon modes in undetected runs . to do this we include the runs where none of the detectors click . the combined total number of runs is constituted by runs where either a single detector clicks or none of the detectors click .    in the ideal scenario where there are no losses , @xmath9 is the probability of getting outcome @xmath8 when you measure observable @xmath4 .",
    "when we include losses we use @xmath101 for the proportion of the combined total number of runs where we measure @xmath4 and get outcome @xmath8 .",
    "to uniquely specify the results of a run we must specify the outcomes @xmath102 and @xmath103 of all three dichotomous observables ( respectively @xmath4 , @xmath22 and @xmath104 ) .    when estimating the correlations in equation ( [ eq : correlations ] ) we now use the renormalized probability : @xmath105 which is the ratio of the number of runs with the given outcome ( @xmath106 ) to the number of runs where a single detector clicks .",
    "this eliminates the dependence on no detection events ( runs with outcome @xmath107 ) .    in hidden variable theories we can use ( [ eq : hiddenvariabledistribution ] ) to express @xmath108 as a function of the detector efficiency @xmath100 and probabilities in the ideal scenario where there are no losses : @xmath109 this allows us to evaluate the correlations in equation ( [ eq : correlations ] ) for a hidden variable strategy @xmath14 conditioned on @xmath13 .",
    "we find inequality ( [ dagandpawelcorrelationineqaulity ] ) is modified in the presence of detector inefficiency to @xmath110 we need @xmath111 for the right hand side of equation ( [ eq : modifiedskiinequality ] ) to be below the maximum level of quantum violation for this inequality @xcite .",
    "hence when the detector efficiency is below @xmath112 it is impossible to experimentally detect violation of inequality ( [ dagandpawelcorrelationineqaulity ] ) unless subsidiary assumptions are made about the distribution of putative outcomes ( which detector failed to click ) for undetected events .",

    "each angle corresponds to the angle of rotation in a @xmath114 rotation matrix acting on a pair of polarization modes within a single spatial path .",
    "we have chosen to give the angle characterizing the transformation rather than the precise configuration of the wave plate s optical axis because the latter will be contingent on the exact details of the experimental implementation and may be obsolete if even a small change is made .",
