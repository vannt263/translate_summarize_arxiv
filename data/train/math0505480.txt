    "one motivation for this work came from two well - known conjectures :      ( the hyperbolic ehrenpreis conjecture)(@xcite,@xcite ) let @xmath9 and let @xmath10 be two closed hyperbolic surfaces .",
    "then there exists finite - sheeted locally isometric covers @xmath11 of @xmath12 ( for @xmath13 ) such that there is a @xmath14 bi - lipschitz homeomorphism between @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "attempting to understand these conjectures led to the study of immersions of three - holed spheres into @xmath6-manifolds @xmath5 and cross products @xmath17 ; we would like to glue such immersions together to obtain an immersion of a closed surface @xmath18 or @xmath19 with tight control on its geometric structure .",
    "[ cnj : singlesurface ] given @xmath20 , for sufficiently large @xmath3 , does there exist a finite sheeted cover @xmath21 such that @xmath22 admits a pair of pants decomposition , every geodesic of which has length in @xmath23 ?",
    "another motivation for the present work comes from a desire to `` bridge the gap '' between two research areas : group growth and subgroup growth .",
    "the former concerns itself with the asymptotic number of elements in a given group of word length less than @xmath24 , the latter with the asymptotic number of subgroups with finite index less than @xmath24 .",
    "is there something in between ? among other things , here we study the asymptotic number of conjugacy classes of 2-generator subgroups of a surface group satisfying certain geometric conditions with the aim ( not yet realized ) of amalgamating these subgroups together to obtain finite index subgroups with geometric constraints .",
    "let @xmath0 be a fixed closed hyperbolic surface .",
    "regard @xmath0 as the quotient space @xmath25 where @xmath26 is a fixed lattice in the group @xmath27 @xmath28 of all orientation - preserving isometries of the hyperbolic plane @xmath29 .",

    "the closed geodesic @xmath33 in the homotopy class of this path is very close to the original segment .",
    "a calculation we will use often quantifies how close .",
    "for example , we show that there is a function @xmath34 of the position of @xmath35 relative to @xmath36 such that the distance from @xmath30 to @xmath33 along a geodesic segment orthogonal to @xmath30 equals @xmath37 , the angle at which this segment intersects @xmath33 equals @xmath38 and the length of @xmath33 equals @xmath39 . roughly speaking ,",

    "the pair @xmath42 moves by a product of hypercycle flows in the product space @xmath1 . pushing @xmath30 a distance @xmath43 amounts to flowing this pair for @xmath44 time .",
    "as @xmath3 tends to infinity , this product hypercycle flow converges to a product of horocycle flows . as a consequence of ratner s work on raghunathan s conjectures",
    "we show that if the commensurator , @xmath45 , contains only orientation preserving isometries then the latter flow is uniformly equidistributed on the product space . by definition , @xmath45 is the set of all isometries @xmath46 such that @xmath47 has finite index in @xmath26 .    to make this precise , for @xmath48 , @xmath49 , let @xmath50 be the probability measure on the set",
