    "it is widely recognized that luminous blue variables ( lbvs ) represent a post - main sequence phase in which massive stars ( m@xmath8 20 m@xmath9 , langer et al . 1994 ) lose a considerable amount of mass via giant eruptions and minor outbursts .",
    "the ejected gas and dust build up a circumstellar nebula chemically enriched by the central star nucleosynthesis . from the expansion velocity of known lbv nebulae , a dynamical age of a few 10@xmath10 years",
    "is usually inferred , which points to a very short - lived evolutionary phase .",
    "for this reason , lbvs are rare objects ; indeed , only 40 are classified as such in the whole local group ( humphreys & davidson 1994 ) .",
    "p cygni and ag carinae are considered the prototypes of the lbv class .",
    "the lbv nebulae provide us with a wealth of details about their central stars .",
    "their chemical composition is used to determine the evolutionary phase when the lbv instability triggers the nebula ejection ( cf .",

    "1997 and waters et al .",
    "1999 in the case of ag carinae ) , and their morphology constrains the physics of the central star wind . except p cygni , all lbv nebulae display an asymmetric morphology , progressing from elliptical ( e.g. ag carinae ) to bipolar ( e.g. eta carinae and hr carinae ) .",
    "nota et al .",
    "( 1995 ) reproduced the observed shapes through an interacting wind model , where a spherical stellar wind interacts with a pre - existing density contrast between the equatorial and polar direction .",
    "this density contrast could be , for example , induced by mass transfer in a binary or rotation in a single star ( cf .",

    "imaging it is also possible to estimate the ionized gas mass in the lbv nebulae which is a key parameter in the understanding of the total mass ejected and of crucial importance to constrain the evolutionary models for massive stars .",
    "unfortunately , the diagnostic power of the nebular morphology is limited by the spatial resolution accessible from the ground .",
    "coronographic imaging has so far been the observational technique achieving the highest resolution possible from the ground : it has been able to resolve the global symmetry of lbv nebulae out to the lmc ( nota et al .",
    "1995 ) and the nebular fine structure only for close by objects , such as ag carinae . however , the comparison with hydrodynamic models ( cf .",
    "frank 1997 , garcia - segura et al .",
    "1997 ) obviously requires higher levels of morphological details to properly constrain the shaping mechanism at work in lbv nebulae .",
    "further , a more complete analysis should rely on high resolution imaging of ionized / neutral gas and dust ; this would also assess the total ( gas + dust ) mass of lbv nebulae and hence the total mass lost by the central star during the outburst .",
    "for these reasons , we have re - observed a complete sample of lbv nebulae in the galaxy and in the large magellanic cloud ( schulte - ladbeck et al .",

    "1996 ) and @xmath27 ( van genderen et al .",
    "1992 ) gives @xmath28 .",

    "( 1996 ) the bulk of the nebular emission originates from an elliptical shell with major axis oriented at pa @xmath0 120@xmath29 . a larger , fainter loop is visible in the northern region , as already noted by nota et al .",

    "a significant difference with the ground based coronographic images resides in the _ texture _ of the shell , which is not uniform and homogeneous , but rather a superposition of filaments and arcs of different brightnesses , in a way that is a close reminder the ag carinae nebula ( nota et al . 1995 ) . in the new hst images we also resolve the structure of the brightest region in the shell , the southern rim , which appears fragmented , and resembles the shape of a letter _ w_. in correspondence to the vertex of the letter _ w",

    "diffuse emission is seen in the ne quadrant within the shell , between pas 10@xmath29 and 60@xmath29 : we will refer to this as the _ paddle_. the _ paddle _ is clumpy and contains knots which are very similar in morphology to the cometary - tail structures observed by hst / wfpc2 in the ag carinae nebula ( nota et al .",
    "1995 ) . a second",
    ", prominent structure can be identified in the se quadrant , which we will label the _ arm _ :",
    "a filament which extends from the star towards the edge of the shell and eventually merges with an arc on the shell at @xmath0 pa = 120@xmath30 .",

    "the image of hd 168625 taken in the v continuum light ( f547 m ) is shown in figure 2 panel b. the difference between the h@xmath5 and v images is striking : in the continuum image the shell disappears almost completely , replaced by a diffuse and filamentary nebula which has the same size of the gaseous shell .",
    "of the gaseous nebula , only the outline is barely visible , but very different in appearance : the arcs and filaments have disappeared to leave instead knots and clumps .",
    "many more features similar to the above mentioned cometary tails emerge in this image .",
    "neither loops are visible so that the _ paddle _ and the _ arm _ are left as the dominant structures of the nebula in the v continuum light . to establish whether their higher v brightness ( compared to h@xmath5 ) is intrinsic or due to different filter band - passes and exposure times , we have performed aperture photometry on both the f656n and f547 m images and for the southern edge of the shell , the _ paddle _ and the _ arm_. the aperture radius was set to 5 pixel , for a full aperture diameter of 0.@xmath245 .",
    "the aperture fluxes in units of counts have been summed overall the spatial extension of each feature , normalized by the exposure time of each filter ( 3000 s for the f656n and 800 s for the f547 m filter ) and multiplied by the filter inverse sensitivity in order to transform them into units of ergs @xmath31 s@xmath7 a@xmath7 .",

    "paddle_.    the dereddened flux in the f547 m filter has been scaled by the ratio of the f656n to the f547 m bandwidth in order to compute the continuum flux in the f656n filter under the assumption that the continuum is constant with wavelength . this has been subtracted from the dereddened flux measured in the f656n and the resulting emission in the h@xmath5 line is reported in column 4 of table 2 .",
    "column 5 indicates the percentage contribution of the emission in the h@xmath5 line to the h@xmath32 continuum flux detected in the f656n filter .",
    "it can be seen that the h@xmath5 flux is higher ( 81% ) in the shell southern edge and decreases from the _ arm _ ( 64% ) and to the _ paddle _ ( 55% ) .",
    "the southern edge of the shell and the _ paddle _ are almost at the same distance ( @xmath11 4@xmath2 , 0.05 pc ) from the star so they should be exposed to an equally diluted stellar radiation field .",
    "their difference in the h@xmath5 emission should then be due to either a different gas - to - dust ratio or to a different gas density .",
    "indeed , the h@xmath5 flux is proportional to the square of the gas density while the continuum flux is proportional to the dust density which in turn can be expressed as the product of the gas density and the dust - to - gas ratio .",
    "therefore , the h@xmath5-to - continuum flux ratio is proportional to the product of the gas density with the gas - to - dust ratio .",
    "if the gas - to - dust ratio were constant across the nebula , the flux ratio would depend on the gas density alone and hence the continuum flux .",
    "but this is not the case for the shell southern edge and the paddle : from the former to the latter the h@xmath5-to - continuum flux ratio decreases and the continuum flux increases .",
    "therefore , we may qualitatively deduce that the gas - to - dust ratio is not constant across hd 168625 .",

    "intercept the shell on both sides of the star ; the slit at pa = 120@xmath19 in particular detects both the eastern and western lobes which dominate the ir emission of the nebula .",
    "the slit at pa = 90@xmath19 cuts through the western lobe and marginally samples the northern faint end of the eastern one .",
    "the slit at pa = 0@xmath19 is centered on the southern edge of the shell where the h@xmath5 emission of the nebula peaks , but it also detects the northern loop and the fragment of the southern loop .    we have measured the radial velocity of the nebula with a spatial sampling of 2 pixels ( 0.@xmath27 ) along the cross - dispersion axis with a multi - gaussian fit of the nebular h@xmath5 and [ nii ] @xmath386584 lines in each of the three spectra .",
    "specifically , we have measured the peak wavelength and the intensity of each component in the h@xmath5 and [ nii ] @xmath386584 line profiles .",
    "radial velocities have been computed from the peak wavelengths and transformed into heliocentric .",
    "we have typically detected 2 to 3 components per position .",
    "the overall distribution of the nebular [ nii]6584/h@xmath5 ratio turns out to be bimodal , peaking at 0.51 @xmath35 0.15 and 0.22 @xmath35 0.05 .",
    "the former is associated with the shell and the latter with the northern and southern loop .",
    "figure 7 shows the shell velocity distributions in right ascension and declination where positions are relative to the star .",
    "the top panel consists of all the radial velocities measured in the spectra taken at pa = 90@xmath39 and 120@xmath39 , and the bottom panel collects the radial velocities determined in the spectra at pa = 0@xmath39 and 120@xmath39 .",
    "the filled dots are the observed data while the open circles represent the velocities obtained by fitting an expanding ellipse .",
    "the parameters of the best - fitting ellipses are listed in table 3 for both the velocity distributions in ra and dec .",
    "the centre of both ellipses is at ( 0@xmath2 , 6 km s@xmath7 ) .",
    "according to the above parameters , the shell appears to be an ellipsoid with a full linear size of 14@xmath2 ( 0.19 pc ) and 9@xmath2 ( 0.12 pc ) projected along the the ra and dec direction , respectively , and expanding at 19 km s@xmath7 .",
    "the spatial extensions derived by fitting the velocity distributions well agree with those measured on the hst images .",
    "therefore , we estimate a lower limit to the dynamical age of @xmath0 4800 yrs along the ra axis and @xmath0 3100 yrs in the dec direction .    the loop sample is restricted only to the declination axis .",
    "its velocity distribution is less well sampled than the shell , and it can be fit with either an expanding sphere or an expanding ellipse . in figure 8",
    "we have plotted the observed data ( filled dots ) and their best fits ( open circles ) . in order to match the loop sample ,",
    "a circular shell should have a radius of about 9@xmath2.5 and expand at 17 km s@xmath7 with its centre at ( 0@xmath2 , 4 km s@xmath7 ) , while an ellipse should have a semi - minor axis of @xmath0 9@xmath2 and expand at 19 km s@xmath7 ( being its centre at ( 0@xmath2 , 6 km s@xmath7 ) . the ellipse major axis ( i.e. the radial velocity axis )",
    "would also be tilted by @xmath0 27@xmath39 towards south with respect to the shell ellipsoid .",
    "the loop dynamical age would thus vary from @xmath0 7300 yrs as in the case of a sphere to @xmath0 6200 yrs if the loop were represented by a 2d ellipse .",
    "because of the low spectral resolution of their data , nota et al .",
    "( 1996 ) could not distinguish between the shell and the loop , and could only fit an expanding sphere to their velocity distribution , which in turn defined a radius of about 12@xmath2 and an expansion velocity of @xmath0 37 km s@xmath7 .",
    "we have extracted the stellar spectrum from the data at pa = 90@xmath19 , normalized its continuum to unity and plotted it in figure 9 , where the top panel shows the full flux - scale spectrum while the bottom panel is a close up of the absorption lines .",
    "two sets of lines can be identified in the stellar spectrum of hd 168625 based on their fwhm : _",
    "i ) _ the h@xmath5 p cygni line and the cii @xmath406578.1 , 6582.9  and fei 6614  characterised by a mean fwhm of 69 km s@xmath7 ; and _ ii ) _ narrow absorption lines with an average fwhm of 10 km s@xmath7 . the latter have been identified with fei , feii , cai , nii features and possibly mn and ti absorptions .",
    "these lines were also resolved in the spectrum of p cygni by stahl et al .",
    "israelian et al . (",
    "1996 ) detected dacs in the uv feii and feiii lines of p cygni which vary over a period of nearly six months and are believed to be associated with a shell ejection .",
    "therefore , the narrow absorption lines at optical wavelengths may relate to the shell ejection mechanism as well . in the case of hd 168625",
    ", it is interesting to compare the stellar spectrum in figure 8 with those obtained by nota et al .",
    "( 1996 ) in 1995 , five months apart .",
    "the discrete absorptions are present in the october spectrum but not in may ; moreover , the star modified its h@xmath5 profile from flat - topped to p cygni and underwent a variation of @xmath11 0.3 mag in the continuum and @xmath11 3000 k in t@xmath12 between may and october .",
    "this behaviour hints at a shell ejection ; the fact that the narrow absorptions are also seen in the 1999 spectrum may indicate that shell ejections are a recurrent episode in the mass - loss history of hd 168625 as for p cygni .",
    "we have used the cii @xmath406578.1 , 6582.9  and fei 6614  lines to derive the radial velocity of the star .",
    "the stellar heliocentric radial velocity is 11.7 km s@xmath7 and the corresponding lsr value is of 25.5 km s@xmath7 .",
    "multi - colour imaging of the nebula associated with hd 168625 , obtained from space with hst and iso , shows an elliptical nebula with the major axis oriented at pa @xmath11 120@xmath19 . its main structure is a shell which hst has resolved into nesting filaments . both shell morphology and size depend on wavelength :    _ i ) _ in the h@xmath5 light , the southern edge is well defined while the northern part dissolves into diffuse circumstellar matter .",
    "the shell surface brightness is higher along the southern edge and peaks between pa @xmath11 140@xmath19 and pa @xmath11 210@xmath19 .    _",
    "ii ) _ the shell disappears in the v continuum light , where it is replaced by diffuse , filamentary emission within a faint outline which traces the boundaries of the gaseous nebula . at",
    "these wavelengths ( @xmath41 5480  ) the bulk of the emission seems to originate from a substructure , the _ paddle _ , to the ne of the central star .    _",
    "iii ) _ the shell lights up again at mid - infrared wavelengths , 3.1  5.2 @xmath4 m and 10.8  11.9 @xmath4 m , but this time the emission peaks in two lobes which are adjacent to the inner edge of the shell , in correspondence to _ dark or obscured _ regions in the optical image .",
    "the _ paddle _ and the southern portion of the shell , which dominate the continuum and h@xmath5 emissions , are here far less pronounced .    _",
    "iv ) _ the size of the nebula is different at optical and mid - ir wavelengths . in the light of h@xmath5 , the nebula has an extension of 12@xmath2 @xmath6 16.@xmath27 ( 0.16 @xmath6 0.23 pc ) , if we exclude the northern loop . at 3.1  5.2 @xmath4 m",
    ", the nebula has a larger extension of 15.@xmath25 @xmath6 23.@xmath25 ( 0.21 @xmath6 0.32 pc ) , and at 10.8  11.9 @xmath4 m , an even larger size of 31@xmath2 @xmath6 35.@xmath25 ( 0.42 @xmath6 0.48 pc ) .",
    "aperture photometry of the optical images indicates that the _ paddle _ and the shell southern edge may differ in the gas - to - dust content , with the _ paddle _ more dusty and the southern edge of the shell more gas - rich .",
    "aperture photometry of the infrared images suggests that the eastern and western lobes of the shell are dominated by dust and pah molecules , in agreement with the findings of skinner ( 1997 ) and robberto & herbst ( 1998 ) who resolved the lobes up to 20 @xmath4 m .",
    "nota et al .",
    "( 1996 ) already derived for the nebula a log(n / h ) @xmath16 12 of @xmath0 8.04 , showing that the nebula is indeed n - enriched and hence of stellar origin .",
    "they could not resolve the nebula into its components , as we did in this work with the help of echelle data .",
    "the higher spectral resolution of our data has allowed us to separate the shell from the loop and measure for each component the [ nii]6584/h@xmath5 intensity ratio , that we use as a n - abundance indicator .",
    "it turns out that the [ nii]6584/h@xmath5 ratio is , on average , 0.51 @xmath35 0.15 for the shell and 0.22 @xmath35 0.05 for the loop , which means that the shell is n - enriched relative to the loop .",
    "in particular , the [ nii]6584/h@xmath5 ratio measured for the loop is very similar to what is observed for galactic hii regions .",
    "we have indeed selected a number of galactic hii regions from the sample of shaver et al .",
    "( 1983 ) which are at the same distance of hd 168625 and/or have a plasma temperature t@xmath14([nii ] ) close to what assumed for hd 168625 ( t@xmath42 7000 k , nota et al . 1996 ) .",
    "we have computed their relative [ nii]6584/h@xmath5 intensity ratios and determined the mean value of 0.26 @xmath35 0.08 , which compares well to a [ nii]6584/h@xmath43 0.22 in the loop .",
    "this therefore implies that the loop is composed of un - processed material which has been blown by the stellar wind .",
    "it is unlikely that the loop is an interstellar bubble such the one detected nw of hr carinae ( nota et al .",
    "1997 ) : its dynamical age is at most @xmath0 7300 yrs old , too young for a hii region . the possibility that the loop is a previous stellar ejection also seems improbable : in this scenario , about 3000 years ( i.e. the age difference between the loop and the shell ) would have been enough for the star to self - enrich in n by almost a factor of 2 .",
    "this time interval appears to be quite short with respect to evolutionary models of b stars ( lamers et al .",
    "therefore , we suggest that the loop is local interstellar medium swept by the stellar wind .",
    "the fact that we have been able to detect the loop only in the dec direction may imply that the loop lies preferentially on a plane , maybe the equatorial plane of the star .",
    "the radial velocities measured for the shell indicate that it is an ellipsoid expanding at 19 km s@xmath7 in both the ra and dec directions .",
    "its axes are 14@xmath2 ( 0.19 pc ) and 9@xmath2 ( 0.12 pc ) along the ra and dec directions , respectively , in agreement with that estimated from the hst images .",
    "such a morphology is very common among lbv nebulae , the best known example being ag carinae .",
    "nota et al .",
    "( 1995 ) explained the elliptical shape of ag carinae by invoking a density contrast between the stellar equator and poles which would restrict the nebula expansion on the stellar equatorial plane and produce a `` waist '' in the circumstellar nebula .",
    "the density contrast would leave the stellar polar axis as the only free direction to the nebular expansion and therefore would shape the nebula into an ellipsoid . there",
    "exist several ways to produce a density contrast ( livio 1995 ) , such as stellar rotation and stellar binarity .",
    "although no solid evidence for stellar rotation or binarity is available for hd 168625 , one of these mechanisms could be responsible for the overall morphology of the nebula associated with hd 168625 and also would preferentially direct the present stellar wind along the polar axis of the star , i.e. the ra axis of the nebular ellipsoid , so that it would interact with the `` caps '' of the ellipsoid .",
    "the interaction would destroy the co molecules and give rise to pah emission as detected by iso in the lobes of the nebula .",
    "moreover , the hst images suggest that the shell caps may be interacting with the loop and this could also produce pah emission .",
