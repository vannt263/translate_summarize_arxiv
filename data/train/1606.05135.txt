    "one of the primary contributors to global mobile traffic growth is the increasing number of wireless devices that are accessing mobile networks .",
    "over half a billion ( 526 million ) mobile devices and connections were added in 2013 and the overall mobile data traffic is expected to grow to 15.9 exabytes per month by 2018 , nearly an 11-fold increase over 2013  @xcite .    in order to address this issue , a recent trend in 3gpp is to utilize both the licensed and unlicensed spectrum simultaneously for extending available system bandwidth . in this context ,",
    "lte in unlicensed spectrum , referred to as lte - u , is proposed to enable mobile operators to offload data traffic onto unlicensed frequencies more efficiently and effectively , and provides high performance and seamless user experience  @xcite .",
    "integration of unlicensed bands is also considered as one of the key enablers for 5 g cellular systems  @xcite . however , unlike the typical operation in licensed bands , where operating base stations ( bs ) have exclusive access to spectrum and therefore are able to coordinate by exchanging of signaling to mitigate mutual interference , such a multi - standard and multi - operator spectrum sharing scenario imposes significant challenges on coexistence in terms of interference mitigation .    [ t ]    licensed assisted access ( laa ) with listen - before - talk ( lbt ) protocol has been proposed for the current coexistence mechanism of lte - u  @xcite . for coexistence in 5 g , one of the major issues is that the use of highly directional antennas as one of the key enablers for 5 g networks @xcite becomes problematic for the current coexistence mechanisms where omni - directional antennas were mostly assumed .",
    "for example , transmission by a different nearby 5 g bs or wigig access point ( ap ) may not be detected due to the narrow beam that has been used , resulting a transmission that causes excessive interference to the victim user equipment ( ue ) , e.g. , ues in the central area as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ figworstcase ] . in this regard ,",
    "the simultaneous transmission should be coordinated and exploited fully to greatly enhance the network capacity .",
    "such a mechanism is referred as beam scheduling .",
    "there has been some related work on this topic based on tdma @xcite and a concept of exclusive region is introduced in @xcite to enable concurrent transmission with significant interference reduction .",
    "however , the effect of interference aggregation is not captured .",
    "other approaches are proposed based on centralized coordination in @xcite , where the access points are coordinated in a centralized manner to reduce interferences and improve network capacity .    in this paper",
    ", we consider a multi - rat deployment where 5 g bss and other 60ghz aps , e.g. , wigig aps , co - exist , all transmitting via beamforming .",
    "we form a scheduled beam sequence containing the indices of the beams used at different time slots , and formulate an optimization problem to find the optimal scheduled beam sequence to maximize the spectral efficiency of the entire network .",
    "it is known that such a combinatorial problem is np - hard and highly computationally costly when using exhaustive search @xcite .",
    "we therefore further propose a novel distributed learning algorithm where different bss cooperatively and iteratively update the beam sequences such that near maximum spectral efficiency is achieved .",
    "it is shown that the proposed algorithm almost achieves comparable spectral efficiency to that using the exhaustive search , while at the same time having a much reduced complexity and signaling overhead .",
    "it should be noted that the proposed algorithm and analysis are general and can be easily applied to other bands , such as 28 ghz .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "system model will be introduced in the next section and the optimization problem is formulated in section iii . in section iv , we detail the proposed distributed learning algorithm and compare its complexity with that using exhaustive search and distributed greedy scheduling .",
    "simulation results are presented in section v and section vi concludes the paper .",
    "in this paper , we assume that both 5 g bss and co - existing aps employ beamforming to tackle the increased path loss in 60 ghz band . from now on , we do not differentiate 5 g bs and co - existing ap and refer to them as 5 g ap for simplicity .",
    "we also assume that each 5 g ap is only able to transmit data using a single beam at a time for simplicity and the mechanism considered here can be extended to the multi - beam case .",
    "we assume a coexistence deployment scenario with @xmath0 5 g aps , which could either be 5 g bss or co - existing aps or a mixture of both , and @xmath1 associated ues for every ap .",
    "each 5 g ap has @xmath2 transmit antennas , whilst each ue has one receive antenna . at a given time , the @xmath3th ( @xmath4 ) 5 g ap transmits to the @xmath5th ( @xmath6 ) ue using a beam @xmath7 , where @xmath7 is vector with length @xmath2 . to obtain the beamforming vector @xmath7 , we assume that the 5 g ap selects the beam configuration within a predefined beam codebook with cardinality @xmath8 that uniformly covers the azimuth directions around the ap . in particular , the codebooks at the transmitter",
    "are formed by vectors @xmath9 , with the @xmath10th length-@xmath2 vector @xmath11 denoting the beam for the @xmath10th codebook entry .",
    "the @xmath3th ap selects the @xmath12th entry in the codebook according to @xmath13 and @xmath14    we define a scheduling cycle with duration of @xmath1 time slots . within each scheduling cycle , we consider scheduling the beams for @xmath1 ues associated with a particular 5 g ap , for example , the @xmath3th ap .",
    "suppose at a given time slot @xmath5 ( @xmath6 ) , this ap is transmitting to only one of the ues via one beam in a round robin manner , which could be any one of the beams from @xmath15 , indexed as beam @xmath16 .",
    "during one scheduling cycle , the indices of the transmitted beams therefore form a beam sequence vector with a length @xmath1 , denoted as @xmath17^t$ ] , where @xmath18 $ ] .",
    "it is known that there are @xmath19 permutations of such beam sequences , whereas there may exist only one optimal sequence given particular network criterion .",
    "this paper therefore aims at finding an optimal @xmath20 for the @xmath3th 5 g ap , such that certain utility function is optimized in every scheduling cycle .",
    "in particular , we consider using the spectral efficiency as the utility function and aim to find an optimal beam sequence that maximizes the spectral efficiency .",
    "let @xmath21 denote the set that contains all @xmath22 possible beam sequences .",
    "the mathematical description of the problem is given by @xmath23 where @xmath24 is a utility function obtained when the sequence @xmath25 is chosen as the beam sequence within one scheduling cycle with duration of @xmath1 time slot .",
    "when spectral efficiency is considered , the utility function for the entire scheduling cycle is given by @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the utility function for the @xmath5th user .",
    "we then consider the problem of finding the optimal @xmath28 such that the average spectral efficiency is maximized .",
    "we now show the derivation of spectral efficiency @xmath27 .",
    "suppose at a given time slot , the @xmath5th ue is scheduled and the 5 g ap is transmitting via beam @xmath7 .",
    "the spectral efficiency for the given time slot can be expressed as @xcite @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the received signal power at the scheduled ue @xmath5 , and @xmath31 and @xmath32 are the interference and noise term , respectively .",
    "the received signal power is given by @xmath33 where @xmath34 and @xmath35 are the transmission power and beamforming gain at the @xmath3th 5 g ap .",
    "in this paper we consider a constant transmission power , given by @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is the bandwidth .",
    "in addition , the beamforming gain at the @xmath3th 5 g ap @xmath35 is calculated as @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the channel between the @xmath3th base station to the scheduled ue given in @xcite as @xmath40 in ( [ hnm ] ) , @xmath41 is the complex gain of the @xmath42th path , @xmath43 and @xmath44 $ ] are the uniformly distributed random variables representing the angles of arrival and departure , respectively , and @xmath45 and @xmath46 are the antenna array responses at the ues and 5 g aps , respectively . assuming uniform linear arrays , @xmath46 can be written as    @xmath47^t\\nonumber.\\ ] ]    for single antenna ue , we have @xmath48",
    "lastly , @xmath49 is the path loss component between the @xmath3th 5 g ap and the @xmath5th user , which is a function of the distance @xmath50 between two nodes .",
    "we now look at the interference term given in ( 5 ) , which is given by @xmath51 where @xmath52 is calculated in the same manner as @xmath53 .",
    "the noise term @xmath32 in ( 5 ) is simply white gaussian noise , given by @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the boltzmann constant and @xmath56 is the noise temperature .    having obtained the spectral efficiency , the optimization problem given in ( [ opt_problem ] ) can then be solved and the optimal beam sequence can be found .",
    "one could perform an exhaustive search in the finite set of possible beam sequences , known to yield a high computational complexity . in the following section , we propose a novel distributed learning algorithm to solve the optimization problem , which is shown to yield comparable performance than that using exhaustive search , while achieving a much reduced complexity .",
    "we first present a distributed greedy scheduling mechanism , followed by a detailed description of the distributed learning algorithm .      in the distributed greedy scheduling algorithm , at the beginning of each scheduling cycle ,",
    "@xmath25 is randomly chosen from the @xmath22 possible permutation sequences for each 5 g ap .",
    "a block - coordinate optimization algorithm is then applied to maximize the individual utility function of each 5 g ap sequentially @xcite .",
    "different from exhaustive search , where a global optimization is reached and maximum spectral efficiency is achieved for all bss , the distributed greedy scheduling mechanism maximizes the utility function with respect to @xmath25 while keeping other @xmath57 unchanged . in other words ,",
    "the @xmath3th 5 g ap computes the utility functions for all possible permutations of @xmath25 , and then greedily selects the sequence that yields the maximum utility value , i.e. , spectrum efficiency , for itself , assuming the first @xmath58 5 g aps are using the optimal sequences obtained in the previous selection process .",
    "the process continues until it reaches the last 5 g ap , which completes one iteration of greedy selection .",
    "the same iteration will be repeated @xmath59 times until a scheduling decision is made .      in this section ,",
    "we propose a distributed learning algorithm for beam scheduling . in the proposed learning algorithm",
    ", we allocate each sequence a probability at the beginning of each scheduling cycle and then update the probability and utility functions of the sequences iteratively .",
    "the optimal beam sequence is then selected at the end of the learning procedure according to such a probability . such a learning algorithm is detailed as follows .",
    "suppose the @xmath60th ( @xmath61 $ ] ) beam sequence is selected for 5 g ap @xmath3 at iteration @xmath62 , which we denote as @xmath63 .",
    "at the beginning , i.e. , @xmath64 , each sequence is assigned with the same probability @xmath65 , and one sequence @xmath66 is randomly selected for the @xmath3th 5 g ap according to this probability .",
    "the utility functions are then calculated for each 5 g ap . at the end of the @xmath62th iteration",

    "such a learning process continues until the maximum number of iteration @xmath56 is hit and then the training phase stops .",
    "the final probabilities used to choose the optimal sequence for the @xmath3th 5 g ap among all permutations is given by @xmath80    [ t ]     a flow chart of the distributed learning scheduling algorithm is given in fig .",
    "[ figflowchart ] .",
    "it is known that for exhaustive search , the statistical utility functions need to be computed for all aps and all possible beam sequences , yielding a complexity of @xmath81 , which becomes prohibitive especially with a large number of aps . for the distributed greedy scheduling algorithm , for @xmath0 aps and @xmath59 iterations ,",
    "we need to calculate @xmath82 utility functions in total , having a computational complexity of @xmath83 .",
    "the proposed distributed learning algorithm , on the contrary , computes only one utility function for each 5 g ap at a given iteration , yielding a complexity of @xmath84 , which is much smaller than the exhaustive search as well as the distributed greedy scheduling .",
    "in addition , as illustrated in the next section , the number of iterations required by the proposed leaning algorithm is also less than that of the greedy ones , i.e. , @xmath85 , leading to even less calculations .    in terms of signaling overhead ,",
    "exhaustive search requires global utility function information to be exchanged among all 5 g aps , whilst the signaling overhead of the proposed distributed learning scheduling algorithm is similar to the distributed greedy scheduling algorithm since there is no need for exchanging utility function globally .",

    "the performance of the proposed distributed learning algorithm is very close to the greed one but with significantly reduced complexity and signaling overhead as aforementioned .",
