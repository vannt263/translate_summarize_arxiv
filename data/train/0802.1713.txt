    ", they conclude that the two galaxies are certainly interacting .    despite the convincing arguments in favor of the interacting nature of the two galaxies , one could still question whether the absorption and emission lines observed in the direction of ngc 6908 are indeed from that galaxy or originate from the rotating disk of ngc 6907 .",

    "neither the optical center nor the radio center are coincident .",
    "the integration of the column density on elliptical rings along ngc 6907 provides the radial column density profile presented in figure [ fig7 ] .",
    "as expected , there is depletion of h  i on the central regions of ngc 6907 , since the molecular hydrogen is formed in a denser environments .",
    "after the peak emission at 10 kpc an exponential fall occurs up to 28 kpc , where the column density rises up to 34 kpc and falls back again .",
    "such distribution is quite common as can be seen in broeils & van woerden ( 1994 ) , and the minimum inside the galactic disk can be related to the gas redistribution in the corotation radius .        on the other hand ,",

    "nevertheless , the different levels of the peaks indicates the presence of other components in the distribution of velocities measured in the field .",
    "these effects can be attributed to the spatial velocity of ngc 6908 projected on the line - of - sight and to the intrinsic asymmetries on the velocity field of ngc 6907 .",
    "richter & huchtmeier ( 1991 ) , chengalur et al ( 1993 ) and doyle et al ( 2005 ) observed these galaxies in lower resolution with different single dishes , what can possibly account for the main differences in the registered line profiles .",
    "the mean differences are lower than @xmath47 , including the flux density ( 48.3 @xmath4 1.8 mjy.km s@xmath1 ) , suggesting that a beam smearing is the main responsible for the differences found at the flux peak .",
    "the weighted mean velocity associated with the h  i profile ( @xmath48 km s@xmath1 ) is absolutely compatible with the velocity measured by the robust mean of the entire 1st moment map ( 3183.2 @xmath4 6.7 km s@xmath1 ) .",
    "taking into account the hubble flow distance ( supposing h = ( 73 @xmath4 5 ) km / sec / mpc ) , the galactocentric distance of this galaxy is estimated as ( 44.5 @xmath4 3.1 ) mpc . using this distance a h  i mass of ( 8.3 @xmath4 0.4)@xmath49 @xmath50 was calculated .",
    "considering the distribution of velocities associated with the bidimensional emission in each frequency of the 1st moment map , then the observed velocity field of the galaxy can be extracted ( figure [ fig9 ] ) .    .",
    "dashed lines represent the part of the velocity field going away from the observer while the opposite is represented by the continuous lines .",
    "the thicker crossing lines represent the kinematical axis .",
    "the velocity field was generated using an uv range of @xmath51 and a resolution of @xmath52 , to balance the sensitivity to the diffuse emission and the spatial resolution .",
    ", width=325 ]    one can note that the velocity field is strongly oriented by the spiral arm in the internal regions .",
    "in fact , the high density of the h  i emission in the spiral arms ( from 10 to 100 times higher than the interarm regions ) could generate a bias in the observed velocity field , if the velocity from the disk does not correspond to that measured in the spiral arms .",
    "the kinematic major axis is not perpendicular to the kinematic minor axis ( figure [ fig9 ] ) . that can be easily verified by comparing the linear fit over the coordinates of the points with the systemic velocity ( minor axis ) and the coordinates of the nearest points to the minor axis of all isovelocity levels , which samples the major axis in an axisymetric rotation disk .",
    "the angle between these axis is ( 78.2 @xmath4 3.1)@xmath37 and the point where they cross each other can be used to define the kinematic center ( @xmath53=20@xmath3325@xmath3406@xmath35.40 and @xmath54=-24@xmath3748@xmath1138@xmath38.3 ) .",
    "since the the global h  i profile suggest that a rotating disk must be the main component of the movement of the system , then the rotation curve of the galaxy ngc 6907 can be extracted supposing that the elliptical fitting made on the h  i gas distribution represent the projection of the ngc 6907 disk on the sky and its gas follows circular orbits .",
    "in this situation the observed line - of - sight velocity ignoring vertical and radial movements would be :    @xmath55    taking into account that :    @xmath56    @xmath57    where @xmath58 is the kinematic center , @xmath15 is the systemic velocity , @xmath59 is the position angle of the receding semi - major axis , @xmath17 is the inclination between the normal to the plane of the galaxy and the line - of - sight and @xmath60 and @xmath61 are the polar coordinates inside the plane of the galactic disk .",
    "note that we introduce the term @xmath62 multiplying all distances measured in right ascension ( what it is not usually made in the literature ) , otherwise it would overestimate the galactocentric radius , depending on the declination of the source and the position angle of each target relative to the center of the galaxy . for the ngc 6907 these errors are predominantly of the order of 12% .    using the combination of the velocity fields made with maps covering uv - ranges from 1k@xmath39 to 40k@xmath39 , taking into account that the most reliable information about the rotation curve is extracted near the kinematic major axis ( @xmath63 )",
    ", then the previous equations can be used to determine @xmath64 , @xmath60 and @xmath61 for the receding and approaching regions of the galaxy ( see figure [ fig10 ] ) . the tilted ring model was applied to the ngc 6907 velocity field , considering the same limits used in the previous method .",
    "variations of the inclinations and the position angles with the distance are lower than the uncertainties for the position angle and inclination of the whole galaxy so its results can be ignored . a raw estimate for the dynamical mass of ngc 6907 , considering the last point in the rotation curve",
    "is @xmath65 @xmath50 .     and r@xmath11 . for the stellar rotation curve",

    "the high dispersion of individual points is related to the higher uncertainties to extract radial velocities azimuthaly far away from the major axis . in spite of that ,",
    "the mean dispersion is inferior to the limit of 50 km s@xmath1 , refereed by bosma ( 1981 ) as the limit related to large - scale asymmetries of velocity fields .",
    "the exclusion of the objects in larger azimuthal angles relative to the major axis @xmath67 provides almost the same fit .",
    "in particular , the point representing the slit which sampled ngc 6908 presents a higher velocity dispersion than the others , possibly due to the spatial motion of ngc 6908 .    )",
    "a first view on the ngc 6907 velocity field ( figure [ fig9 ] ) reveals that ngc 6908 is over the approaching part of it .",
    "the extraction of the rotation curve in this part of the galaxy reveals contributions of radial components of the ngc 6908 movement , what does not occurs in the receding part of the galaxy .",
    "this verification explains the different peak levels in the global h  i emission profile shown in figure [ fig8 ] and in the rotation curves presented in figure [ fig10 ] .",
    "taking into account that the h  i global profile preserves the behavior expected for a rotating disk and different emission profiles agree with a exponential disk , then the effects of the interaction on the velocities can be considered as local . consequently the rotation curve extracted from the receding part of the velocity field is the real ( undisturbed ) ngc 6907 rotation curve .    comparing the raw observed rotation curves from the receding and approaching parts of ngc 6907 in direction of ngc 6908 , it is possible to see that the relative emission velocity between these galaxies ( 130 @xmath4 17 km s@xmath1 , as measured by madore et al .",
    "2007 ) , coincides exactly with the expected velocity for the undisturbed rotation curve , and not with the velocity measured in radio for the approaching velocity field ( where ngc 6908 can be found ) .",
    "this apparent contradiction can be easily understood considering that the emission line velocity measured for ngc 6908 is in fact from the rotating material in the ngc 6907 disk .",
    "ngc 6908 , as a lenticular galaxy , has less gas and new hot stars to heat it .",
    "so the emission lines used by madore to measure the ngc 6908 velocity only could come from the material in the ngc 6907 disk .",
    "the idea that the emission lines come from the ngc 6907 is corroborated by the spectrum extracted in direction of ngc 6908 ( figure [ fig4 ] ) .",
    "it has a strong continuum superimposed by few emission lines , for which the radial velocity is ( 3092 @xmath4 52 ) km s@xmath1 , and by several absorption lines , associated to a radial velocity of ( 3147 @xmath4 21 ) km s@xmath1 ( table [ tbl-5 ] ) .",
    "relative velocities spectroscopically measured in relation to the ngc 6907 center ( 3209 @xmath4 10 km s@xmath1 ) are 117 @xmath4 53 km s@xmath1 for emission lines ( compatible with the ngc 6907 rotation curve in that direction ) and ( 62 @xmath4 23 ) km s@xmath1 for absorption lines , in perfect agreement with madore et al .",
    "( 2007 ) .",
    "another confirmation about the origin of the emission lines is that the broaden hydrogen absorption lines ( typical of lenticular galaxies ) contain vestiges of narrow emission lines inside it ( figure [ fig5 ] ) .",
    "these emission lines have the same radial velocity of the rotation curve of ngc 6907 at that radius .",
    "that is the reason why different references and observations do not agree with the presence of certain hydrogen lines ( they can be hidden in lower resolutions observations ) and why @xmath68 is observed in absorption while @xmath69 in emission .",
    "since @xmath69 line is more intense than @xmath68 the equivalent absorption line formed in a different source is not deep enough to hide it .",
    "verifying the distribution of h  i emission as a function of the velocity in the direction of ngc 6908 , it is possible to distinguish three tied gaussian components ( figure [ fig12 ] ) .",
    "considering the relative velocities measured with respect the radio systemic velocity expected for the nucleus ( since the spectrum extracted in direction of the slit 19 does not sample the radio nucleus ) , the centroid of each component can be interpreted as associated with different structures in the interaction between ngc 6907 and 6908 .",
    "the first one , at 3120 km s@xmath1 , is associated with ngc 6908 , since it has the same velocity of the absorption lines generated by its stellar content , the second one , at 3065 km s@xmath1 , is produced by the excited material from the disk of ngc 6907 during the interaction with ngc 6908 and the third one ( main component ) related to the higher velocity gas left behind ngc 6908 due the interaction with ngc 6907 .          using the velocity contours above the approaching velocity of 220 km s@xmath1 , it is possible to trace the disturbed regions of the velocity field and see a converging distribution of isophotes over ngc 6908 , whose gradient is higher in direction of the rotation of ngc 6907 , following the spiral arms ( figure [ fig13 ] ) .     in the approaching region of the ngc 6907 velocity field",
    "overlaying the g@xmath11 image of this galaxy .",
    "the interval between contours is 5 km.s@xmath1.,width=325 ]    the striking triangular shape of the isophotes associated with high - velocity gas could be explained by the following scenario .",
    "ngc 6908 crossed the disk of ngc 6907 in a recent past , and very probably the tidal forces created a bridge of gas between the two galaxies , similar to the magellanic stream in our galaxy .",
    "the gas left behind ngc 6908 disk by the collision explains the excess of gas approaching us . in our galaxy , at the solar galactic radius , the time required for a gas cloud launched in the direction perpendicular to the plane to revert its motion and fall back onto it is about 35 myr ( see eg . lpine & duvert , 1994 ) .",
    "this can be taken as an order of magnitude for the present case .",
    "let us now consider the velocity component of ngc 6908 in the plane of the sky .",
    "this component is directed approximately towards the center of ngc 6907 , as we can infer from the fact that presently ngc 6908 is situated closer to the center of ngc 6907 than the marks left in the gas of the disk by the crossing event . the gas stream produced by the collision",
    "must also have a component of velocity in the same ( almost radial ) direction , which explains why the triangular isophotes point towards ngc 6908 .",
    "finally , let us analyze the component of velocity of the stream in the plane of the sky , but in the direction of rotation of ngc 6907 .",
    "the stream can , in a simplified way , be considered as a mixture of gas with velocities ranging from that of ngc 6908 ( with almost zero component in the direction of rotation of ngc 6907 ) to the gas which resulted to have about the same rotation velocity of the disk of ngc 6907 .",
    "this explains the elongated shape of the isophotes in the direction of rotation , and at the same time , allows us to estimate in a new way the time elapsed since the collision .",
    "the mean de - projected distance of the two extremes of the gas with perturbed velocity in figure [ fig13 ] is about @xmath70 arcsec , where the undisturbed rotation curve has the velocity of @xmath71 km @xmath72 . assuming @xmath73 km s@xmath1/mpc , this distance is @xmath74 kpc .",
    "since the angle between the two extremes is @xmath75 , then the initial disturbed material would have traveled @xmath76 kpc azimuthally . from this",
    "we derive that the collision occurred about @xmath2 years ago , which is consistent with order of magnitude previously estimated .",
    "the combination of the gmrt radio observation and gmos / gemini optical observation provides a more complete view about the interaction between the galaxies ngc 6907 and 6908 .",
    "photometric images observed at the gemini telescope and the h  i maps observed at the gmrt reveals extended structures that can be understood as tidal debris in optical images , but resemble the continuation of the spiral arms in radio . by fitting ellipses to the last isophotes registered to each one of these observations for ngc 6907 we verified that the 21-cm emission is 2.4 times more extended than the optical emission .",
    "the orientation of the fitted ellipses provide different parameters of projection for optical and radio observations , the differences being 15.3@xmath37 for the inclination and 24.1@xmath37 for the position angle .",
    "geometric , photometric and kinematic centers are not coincident , reinforcing the evidences about the effect of an interaction in ngc 6907 .",
    "the spectra observed using the gmos spectrograph are coherent with those observed in 21-cm in the same direction of the slits .",
    "the parameters of projection in radio provides the best correspondences between the optical and radio velocities .",
    "the details of the emission and absorption lines observed in direction of ngc 6908 show that they have different origins .",
    "first , because the observed emission lines are not typical of lenticular galaxies like [ oii ] ( 3727  ) , [ oiii ] ( 4959  and 5007  ) and the hei ( 5876  ) , specially for those with low luminosity like ngc 6908 .",
    "second , because the radial velocity observed in absorption is different from the velocity emission lines , which are coherent with the undisturbed rotation curve of ngc 6907 expected for that direction . finally , because inside the hydrogen absorption lines it is possible to see traces of narrower hydrogen recombination lines with a doppler effect suitable for the ngc 6907 rotating disk , confirming their different origin .",
    "the h  i column density distribution presents a discontinuity in its radial profile which can be can be related to the gas redistribution at the corotation radius .",
    "the details of the global h  i emission profile reveals that the rotation is the main component of the h  i velocity distribution , and its asymmetry indicates the contribution of the ngc 6908 motion is local and in velocities near to those found in the ngc 6907 rotating disk .",
    "the total h  i mass obtained was @xmath77 @xmath50 .    due to the dominant contribution to the h  i emission in the spiral arms they can be the main contributors for the velocity field asymmetries , verified by the non perpendicularity of the kinematic axis ( difference of @xmath78 )",
    ".    the differences in the rotation curve extracted from the receding and approaching parts of the velocity field can be interpreted as consequence of line - of - sight components produced by the interaction with ngc 6908 .",
    "assuming that the interaction only affected the side where ngc 6908 is observed in projection , and that the velocity field of the opposite side is the real rotation curve of ngc 6907 , we were able to get a raw estimative for the dynamical mass of @xmath79 @xmath50 .",
    "looking at the h  i spectrum in direction of ngc 6908 it is possible to distinguish three emission components : one coincident with the relative velocity for ngc 6908 , another coincident with the excited gas in ngc 6907 disk and the last one in agreement with the higher relative velocities gas left behind ngc 6908 by dynamic friction . using the difference in the rotation curves extracted from the disturbed region of the velocity field and that one away from this region , we found the limits for the disturbed material on the ngc 6907 .",
    "supposing that this material has drifted inside the ngc 6907 disk , according the rotation curve , we estimated the time when the interaction started in @xmath80 years .",

    "<S> we present 21 cm radio synthesis observations obtained with the gmrt and optical images and spectroscopy obtained with the gemini north telescope of this pair of interacting galaxies . from the radio observations we obtained the velocity field and the h  i column density map of the whole region containing the ngc 6907/8 pair , and by means of the gemini multi - object spectroscopy we obtained high quality photometric images and @xmath0 resolution spectra sampling the two galaxies . by comparing the rotation curve of ngc 6907 obtained from the two opposite sides around the main kinematic axis </S>",
    "<S> , we were able to distinguish the normal rotational velocity field from the velocity components produced by the interaction between the two galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> taking into account the rotational velocity of ngc 6907 and the velocity derived from the absorption lines for ngc 6908 , we verified that the relative velocity between these systems is lower than 60 km s@xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> the emission lines observed in the direction of ngc 6908 , not typical of s0 galaxies , have the same velocity expected for the ngc 6907 rotation curve . </S>",
    "<S> some emission lines are inside their equivalent absorption lines , reinforcing the idea they were not formed in ngc 6908 . </S>",
    "<S> finally , the h  i profile exhibits details of the interaction , showing three components : one for ngc 6908 , another for the excited gas in the ngc 6907 disk and a last one for the gas with higher relative velocities left behind ngc 6908 by dynamical friction , used to estimate the time when the interaction started in @xmath2 years ago .    </S>",
