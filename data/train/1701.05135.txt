    "in recent years there has been an enormous amount of effort devoted to the search for materials with quantum spin liquid phases.@xcite a special class of quantum liquids are those where not only the spins but also the orbitals remain disordered and fluctuating at low temperatures , resulting in a spin - orbital liquid state.@xcite    recently , ba@xmath0cusb@xmath1o@xmath2 has been suggested as a promising candidate to realize spin - orbital liquid behavior.@xcite thermodynamic measurements@xcite , @xmath3sr@xcite and neutron scattering experiments@xcite find no spin ordering or spin freezing down to temperatures as low as 20mk . electron spin resonance ( esr ) and x - ray diffraction measurements find no evidence of a cooperative jahn - teller transition , implying that , not only spins , but also orbitals fail to order.@xcite furthermore , variable frequency esr measurements suggest that the jahn - teller distortions remain dynamic down to low temperatures , rather than simply freezing and forming a glass - like arrangement.@xcite this implies that the orbital degrees of freedom fluctuate at low temperature , and the esr measurement of the timescale of this fluctuation is consistent with extended x - ray absorption fine structure ( exafs ) and x - ray measurements@xcite .",
    "while the spin and orbital degrees of freedom in ba@xmath0cusb@xmath1o@xmath2 are primarily associated with the cu ions , the important sub - units of the system are cu@xmath4-sb@xmath5 charged dumbbells surrounded by oxygen bi - octahedra ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : expstr ] ) .",
    "these dumbbells form a triangular lattice and two orientations of the dumbbell are possible , with either cu or sb on top . despite intensive experimental and theoretical investigations",
    ", no clear consensus has been reached so far on the arrangement of these dumbbells .",
    "such a knowledge is necessary in order to unveil the microscopic origin of the spin - orbital liquid behavior.@xcite there have been three main proposals : ( i ) the dumbbells have all the same orientation and the cu ions thus form a triangular lattice;@xcite ( ii ) the dumbbells are disordered but form a honeycomb structure at short lengthscales;@xcite ( iii ) a stripe structure of cu spins is energetically favorable with the dumbbells freezing in a disordered state with short - range stripe - like correlations.@xcite    in this work we compare these different options via density functional theory ( dft ) calculations of idealized , long - range - ordered dumbbell arrangements with different three - dimensional stackings and show that the stripe configuration ( iii ) has the lowest energy . even though in ba@xmath0cusb@xmath1o@xmath2 the dumbbells are disordered",
    ", our results hint at stripe - like arrangements at the local level@xcite and suggest that if a real material is cooled sufficiently slowly from the synthesis temperature , one should expect a long - range stripe order of the dumbbells .",
    "finally , starting from the idealized structure with long - range dumbbell order , we discuss both the nature of the expected jahn - teller distortion and the electronic properties .",
    "a number of different arrangements of cu@xmath4-sb@xmath5 dumbbells have been proposed in the past and it is useful to summarize the evidence for each of these .    historically , ba@xmath0cusb@xmath1o@xmath2 was proposed to crystallize in the centrosymmetric space group @xmath6 , and to have a parallel alignment of the dumbbells,@xcite so that the cu ions form a triangular lattice . however",
    ", this arrangement would be associated with a large electrical dipole moment and is not consistent with pyroelectric measurements.@xcite furthermore , previous dft calculations showed that this arrangement was energetically unfavorable with respect to honeycomb dumbbell arrangements.@xcite    additional work on the refinement of the crystal structure suggested that the space group is the centrosymmetric @xmath7.@xcite the appearance of partial occupancies of cu / sb positions implies that there is no long - range ordering of the dumbbells , but one expects an equal number of dumbbells in each orientation so as to be compatible with the absence of internal dipole moments observed in pyroelectic measurements .",
    "x - ray diffraction data show no bragg peaks associated with the dumbbell ordering , confirming that the dumbbells are disordered.@xcite diffuse x - ray scattering measurements suggest short - range honeycomb order of the dumbbells , in which the central dumbbell of a hexagonal plaquette is oriented anti - parallel to the other dumbbells.@xcite however , it should be noted that the approximate domain size was found to be @xmath8  , which is less than twice the spacing between neighbouring dumbbells .",
    "the proposal of honeycomb short - range order inspired a number of theoretical studies of the spin and orbital physics , but it was found that long - range orbital order is difficult to avoid.@xcite    finally , a recent theoretical study proposed that the lowest - energy dumbbell arrangement consists of stripes , with a parallel dumbbell alignment within each stripe and antiparallel alignment between neigbouring stripes.@xcite this suggestion was based on solving a highly simplified 2d model , in which dumbbells interact only via their charge degrees of freedom .",
    "it was further discussed that the materials do not reach this ground state configuration , but instead freeze into a disordered configuration with short - range , stripe - like correlations , dubbed a `` branch '' lattice .",
    "this picture was found to be consistent with the x - ray diffraction data reported in ref .",
    "[ ] , which was initially taken as evidence of a honeycomb structure , as well as an x - ray study of the pair distribution function.@xcite in fact this `` branch '' lattice is naturally tuned to a percolation critical point and preliminary calculations suggest that this type of correlated disorder could drive the formation of a spin - orbital liquid.@xcite there is a clear need for a first - principles calculation to evaluate whether such a stripe - ordered configuration is indeed lower in energy than other competing structures .",
    "we perform dft calculations within the generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) , the spin - polarized gga and gga+u , starting from a set of idealized crystal structures with different dumbbell ordering patterns . for each structure",
    "we relax the internal coordinates@xcite using the projector augmented wave method , as implemented in the vienna ab initio simulation package ( vasp @xcite ) .",
    "as the lattice parameters have been confirmed in several measurements@xcite we keep them fixed to their experimental values .",
    "we have verified that our results remain valid also in the case of a full relaxation.@xcite the total energies were checked using the all - electron full - potential localized orbital code ( fplo @xcite ) , which was also employed to calculate the electronic band structures and density of states .    in previous dft studies",
    "correlation effects were found to play an important role , not only to achieve insulating behavior , but also to allow for the formation of distinct jahn - teller distortions of the oxygen octahedra.@xcite here we compare our gga calculations to coulomb corrected gga+u simulations , where the correlations on the cu atoms are explicitly included via a hubbard term.@xcite we choose @xmath9  ev in accordance with previous studies.@xcite the total energies are converged on a @xmath10 and @xmath11 k mesh for the stripy and honeycomb arrangement of the dumbbells , respectively .",
    "in order to discern which of the proposed dumbbell arrangements is lowest in energy , we consider four different structures with long - range dumbbell order , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : honey ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : stripy ] , relax their internal coordinates , and compare their energies .",
    "although in ba@xmath0cusb@xmath1o@xmath2 the dumbbells are not long - range ordered , the energy difference between these idealized structures will give us a strong indication as to the type of local correlations in the system .",
    "the first structure we consider , _ honey - a _ , has a ferrimagnetic honeycomb arrangement of the dumbbells in each layer in the sense that there is a 2:1 ratio between the two dumbbell orientations ( fig .",
    "[ fig : honey](a ) ) .",
    "the neighbouring layers are chosen to have the same ferrimagnetic ordering with a resulting net dipole moment associated with the configuration .",
    "this arrangement was considered in ref .  [ ] and it was found to be energetically favorable over the parallel alignment of all dumbbells .    the second structure , _ honey - b _ , has the same honeycomb arrangement in the layers as _ honey - a _ but the stacking of layers is such that there is no net dipole moment ( fig .  [ fig : honey](b ) ) .",
    "from a naive electrostatic picture this would appear to be higher in energy than _ honey - a_. however , this consideration does nt take into account the exchange energy , and , as noted in ref .  [ ] , interlayer exchange pathways between cu ions at the top of the lower layer and bottom of the upper layer are comparable with those within the layers , and thus could be important .    the third structure , _ stripy - a _ , has a stripe arrangement of the dumbbells in each layer ( fig .  [ fig : stripy](a ) ) .",
    "the interlayer stacking is chosen such as to minimize the electrostatic energy between neighbouring layers .",
    "the fourth structure , _ stripy - b _ , also has a stripe arrangement of the dumbbells in each layer ( fig .",
    "[ fig : stripy](b ) )",
    ". however , a different interlayer stacking is chosen , which is the only period-2 alternative to _ stripy - a _ , assuming that stripes in neighbouring layers run parallel to one another .        comparing the total energies of the two honeycomb structures",
    ", we find that _ honey - a _ has a considerably lower energy than _ honey - b _ of about @xmath12  mev per formula unit ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : toten ] ) .",
    "this is in agreement with naive electrostatic considerations , and shows the importance of the interlayer effects on the dumbbell structure .",
    "the _ stripy - a _ and _ stripy - b _ structures are , interestingly , considerably lower in energy than _ honey - a _ by at least @xmath13  mev per formula unit ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : toten ] ) . when using pure gga , the _ stripy - a _ structure is lower in energy than _ stripy - b _ , as expected from a simple electrostatic picture .",
    "however , spin - polarized gga and spin - polarized gga+u show that exchange effects favour the _ stripy - b _ structure , and the energy is better by approximately @xmath13  mev per formula unit .",
    "thus , _ stripy - b _ has the lowest energy , which is strongly suggestive that local correlations will be of this type in the material .",
    "one of the most interesting , and most discussed , aspects of ba@xmath0cusb@xmath1o@xmath2 is the nature of the jahn - teller effect , which is believed to provide information about the orbital occupancies .",
    "probes of the jahn - teller effect that operate on short timescales , such as exafs@xcite and raman spectroscopy@xcite see a static distortion at low temperature .",
    "however , slower probes , such as x - ray diffraction@xcite see a dynamic jahn - teller effect .",
    "these observations have been shown to be consistent by performing variable frequency esr measurements , which determine a dynamic jahn - teller timescale of about 100ps.@xcite measurements that probe the system on a shorter timescale naturally see a static distortion .    in the idealized ,",
    "long - range ordered _ stripy - b _ structure , we find that there is a static jahn - teller distortion , and this is independent of the choice of functional .",
    "one of the six cu - o bonds is considerably longer than the other five , and the bond lengths are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : jtdistloccoo](b ) .",
    "the bond opposed to the long bond is found to be slightly larger than the bonds lying in the perpendicular plane . in the _ stripy - a _ structure , the jahn - teller distortion is similar , but a little less pronounced ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : jtdistloccoo](a ) ) .",
    "dft calculations give access not only to the nature of the crystal structure , but also to the electronic band structure .",
    "common electronic properties of all considered crystal structures are : ( i ) a strong @xmath14-@xmath15 splitting of the cu @xmath16 orbitals ; ( ii ) a jahn - teller distortion which induces splitting of the partially filled @xmath14 bands ; ( iii ) the bands near the fermi level are predominantly of @xmath17 and @xmath18 character , but there are also small contributions from the oxygen @xmath19 orbitals and , due to additional distortions of the octahedra , from cu @xmath15 orbitals .    the band structure associated with the _ stripy - a _ structure is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : bands_stripynew](a ) . at the level of spin - polarized gga",
    ", there is no gap .",
    "in such a case it is not unreasonable that additional correlation effects could drive a dynamic jahn - teller distortion .",
    "the band structure of the _ stripy - b _ structure is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : bands_stripynew](b ) , and shows considerable differences from the case of the _ stripy - a _ structure , demonstrating the importance of the interlayer dumbbell arrangement . in particular , there is a gap of about @xmath20  ev between the @xmath14 bands already at the level of spin - polarized gga calculations . using the local coordinate system shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : jtdistloccoo](c ) , we observe that the band with predominantly @xmath18 character is fully occupied , while the @xmath17 minority - spin band is empty .",
    "the large energy separation between these bands suggests that a dynamic jahn - teller effect can not occur in the idealized _ stripy - b _ structure .",
    "the static jahn - teller distortion predicted for the _ stripy - b _ structure is in contrast to measurements of a dynamic jahn - teller distortion in the material.@xcite this suggests that the dynamic nature of the jahn - teller distortion is driven by the presence of dumbbell disorder , which is not taken into account in the dft calculations .",
    "while the presence of disorder does not necessarily imply a dynamic jahn - teller distortion , a plausible scenario for how it could result in a dynamic jahn - teller distortion has been proposed in ref .",
    "[ ] .    finally , we also determined via wannier functions  @xcite the tight - binding parameters associated with the different crystal structures . in both the _ stripy - a _ and _ stripy - b _ structures ,",
    "the dominant intralayer hopping path for the single hole in the @xmath14 band is along the stripe direction , and mediated by the @xmath17 orbitals .",
    "hopping between neighbouring stripes within the same layer is highly suppressed , and this is in agreement with a simple analysis of exchange pathways@xcite .",
    "the main difference between the _ stripy - a _ and _ stripy - b _ structures is unsurprisingly in the interlayer hopping . in the _ stripy - a _ the lobes of the @xmath17 orbitals in neighbouring layers point towards each other , yielding hopping integrals as high as @xmath21  mev . in",
    "the _ stripy - b _ structure this is not the case , and the interlayer hopping is highly suppressed relative to the _ stripy - a _ case .",
    "using dft we have explored how cu - sb dumbbells are arranged in the quantum spin - orbital liquid candidate ba@xmath0cusb@xmath1o@xmath2 .",
    "this involved a comparison between different idealized dumbbell arrangements , and it was found that an in - plane stripe arrangement is considerably lower in energy than other candidate structures .",
    "this strongly suggests that in real crystals , which have dumbbell disorder , the local correlations are stripe like , as predicted in ref .",
    "[ ] . we have also demonstrated the importance of the interlayer arrangement of the dumbbells , which is most noticeable in the electronic band structure .",
    "the lowest energy structure , _ stripy - b _ , has a large gap of approximately @xmath20  ev at the fermi level , and it is therefore hard to conceive that correlation effects could drive a dynamic jahn - teller distortion in the idealized crystal .",
    "this in turn suggests the importance of disorder to explain the observed dynamic jahn - teller distortion.@xcite    by clarifying the arrangement of the cu ions in ba@xmath0cusb@xmath1o@xmath2 we hope to provide a good starting point for theories that aim to understand the nature of the experimentally observed spin and orbital fluctuations .",
