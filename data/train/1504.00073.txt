    "recent studies with a variety of microscopic probes have established that the monolayer compound sr@xmath6iro@xmath7  is a mott insulator realized within @xmath24 manifolds that are reorganized by the so interaction : the @xmath24 band splits into two narrow subbands mainly composed of @xmath25 and @xmath26 spin - orbital states , where the latter is further split by the coulomb interaction ( @xmath27 ) into upper and lower hubbard bands upon half - filling.@xcite the bandwidth ( @xmath28 ) increases with the number of iro layers ( @xmath29 ) , which leads to the suppression of the mott transition ( @xmath30 ) and emergence of an anomalous metallic state in sriro@xmath8.@xcite    regarding magnetic properties , sr@xmath6iro@xmath7  is known to exhibit weak ferromagnetism below the curie temperature @xmath31 k in accordance with the mott insulating phase , which is characterized by small saturation moments ( @xmath32/ir).@xcite this is now understood to come from a canted antiferromagnetic ( af ) order within the iro@xmath6 ( @xmath33 ) plane,@xcite where the spin canting is induced by the strong so interaction mapped onto the pseudo - dipolar interaction and the dzyaloshinsky - moriya interaction between the @xmath26 isospins.@xcite while similar behavior has been reported for sr@xmath8ir@xmath6o@xmath9   ( @xmath34/ir),@xcite recent studies using resonant x - ray scattering have shown that the magnetic structure is a g - type af@xcite with @xmath35-axis collinear moments,@xcite where the spin flop from sr@xmath6iro@xmath7  to sr@xmath8ir@xmath6o@xmath9  is attributed to the three - dimensional ( cubic ) character of the @xmath26 ground state that mediates the inter - layer pseudo - dipolar interaction common to the in - plane.@xcite    however , these compounds exhibit complicated magnetic properties at low temperatures ( and under weak magnetic fields ) that do not necessarily fit into the current framework of effective theory .",
    "recent studies on sr@xmath6iro@xmath7  have revealed a magnetic anomaly at low temperatures that is quite sensitive to an external field .",
    "the magnetization is anomalously reduced below @xmath36 k at 0.05 t ( where @xmath37 is reduced to @xmath3850 k at 0.15 t ) , which suggests an enhanced antiferromagnetic correlation below @xmath37.@xcite the anomaly has also been shown to be closely linked with the charge sector ; the dielectric response exhibits crossover from relaxor - like to ferroelectric behavior as the temperature is decreased past @xmath37 .",
    "these features correlate with the reduction in the ir - o - ir bond angle , which suggests a change in spin canting induced by alteration of the exchange coupling .",
    "while the situation is not as clear for sr@xmath8ir@xmath6o@xmath9 , earlier reports in the literature have reported the observation of a rapid decease in magnetization at @xmath39 k and reversal in the basal plane below 20 k under field - cooled conditions at 0.01 t. this has only been observed at low magnetic induction ( below @xmath40 t).@xcite again , these anomalies exhibit a certain correlation with the charge sector as inferred from the sharp increase in the electrical resistivity.@xcite    in contrast to these two cases , no clear anomaly suggesting a phase transition has been observed in the bulk properties of orthorhombic sriro@xmath8  ( @xmath16 ) over the temperature range from ambient to the liquid helium temperature . the electrical resistivity is metallic above @xmath3845 k , where it exhibits a minimum , and changes to localizing behavior at lower temperatures.@xcite in addition , a positive magnetoresistance has been observed below @xmath38170 k.@xcite through a band calculation considering the so interaction and optical conductivity , the carrier has been inferred to have a large effective mass due to electronic correlation.@xcite    muon spin spectroscopy ( @xmath5sr ) is a unique probing technique for investigating the _ local _ magnetic structure and spin dynamics with extreme sensitivity , which is useful for studying magnetism arising from ir moments to which neutron diffraction techniques are difficult to apply because of the large neutron absorption cross - section of ir nuclei . in particular , once the muon site(s ) in the relevant compound is confirmed , the local magnetic field probed by the muon serves as a true measure of the order parameter because it is directly proportional to the magnitude of local magnetic moments .",
    "note that the information gained from @xmath5sr  is complementary to that from diffraction - based techniques ( x - ray and neutron scattering ) , as the latter corresponds to the information averaged over an entire crystal volume .    in this paper",
    ", we report @xmath5sr  measurements on powder samples of sr@xmath0ir@xmath1o@xmath2  ( @xmath10 and @xmath4 ) under a zero external field that establish the development of a long - range magnetic order in sr@xmath6iro@xmath7  ( @xmath41 defined by  onset \" @xmath42 k ) and in sr@xmath8ir@xmath6o@xmath9  ( @xmath43 k ) .",
    "more importantly , we demonstrate the presence of a secondary magnetic phase at lower temperatures ( below @xmath44 k in sr@xmath6iro@xmath7  and @xmath45 k in sr@xmath8ir@xmath6o@xmath9 ) that can be discerned by the increase in spontaneous local fields at muon sites located near the apical oxygen of the iro@xmath19 octahedron .",
    "this result provides a microscopic basis for understanding the magnetic anomalies observed in the bulk properties of these compounds below @xmath18 and suggests that the order parameter of the secondary magnetic phase is not solely determined by the magnitude of ir local moments .",
    "we show that the @xmath5sr result below @xmath18 is consistently reproduced by postulating the presence of small ordered moments at the apical oxygen in those two compounds , which is in line with the above anomalies in their bulk properties .",

    "it also showed the development of oxygen spin polarization below 38 k , where the dielectric constant exhibited a peak , and the origin of such multiferroic behavior was attributed to a charge redistribution around the ion nucleus in accordance with the alteration of the spin configuration , where spin polarization of the oxygen is a crucial component in the relevant theoretical model.@xcite the situation seems to be parallel with the case of sr@xmath6iro@xmath7  for which a similar anomaly in the dielectric constant was reported around 70 - 80 k , which is near @xmath18.@xcite",
    "we used @xmath5sr  to show that sr@xmath6iro@xmath7  and sr@xmath8ir@xmath6o@xmath9  exhibit clear signs of a two - stage magnetic order , whereas sriro@xmath8  stays a non - magnetic metal . provided that the predominant muon sites are located near the oxygen atoms common to these two compounds and that the effective ir moment size is 0.30.4@xmath172",
    ", the magnitude of @xmath11 in the first stage order ( @xmath173 ) closely agrees with that predicted from the magnetic structures of each compound , which were recently inferred from resonant x - ray and neutron diffraction . for the secondary magnetic phase emerging below @xmath18",
    ", we postulate that it originates from ordered magnetic moments ( @xmath380.03@xmath172 in sr@xmath6iro@xmath7  and @xmath380.09@xmath172 in sr@xmath8ir@xmath6o@xmath9 ) at the apical oxygen of the iro@xmath19 octahedron , which is induced by strong hybridization of ir @xmath22-o @xmath174 orbitals .",
    "this hypothesis provides a qualitative explanation for the reported anomalies in both the magnetic and dielectric properties over the relevant temperature range according to the earlier literature .",
    "a neutron diffraction study is currently underway to confirm the oxygen magnetic moments in those compounds .",
    "the present results demonstrate the usefulness of the @xmath5sr  technique in investigating local magnetism associated with oxygen , and it has the potential to be widely applicable to strongly correlated transition metal oxides owing to the fact that implanted muons tend to form a well - defined o-@xmath5 bonding state as interstitial pseudo - hydrogen atoms in oxides .",
