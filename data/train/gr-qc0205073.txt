    "numerical simulations of the einstein equations for situations of interest in the binary black hole problem do not run forever .",
    "the codes either stop due to the development of floating point overflows , or even if they do not crash , they produce answers that after a while are clearly incorrect .",
    "it is usually very difficult to pinpoint a clear reason why a code stops working .",
    "recently , kidder , scheel and teukolsky ( kst ) @xcite introduced a twelve - parameter family of evolution equations for general relativity . performing an empirical parameter study within a certain two - parameter subfamily",
    ", they were able to evolve single black hole spacetimes for over 1000 m , where m is the mass of the black hole , something that had been very difficult to achieve in the past .",
    "it is of interest to try to understand what makes some of the parameter choices better than others , in particular given that a twelve dimensional parameter study appears prohibitive at present .",
    "the intention of this paper is to take some steps in this direction .",
    "we will first perform a linearized analysis of the kst equations in the continuum , by considering small perturbations around flat space - time .",
    "we will observe that the stability of flat space - time is entirely characterized by the level of hyperbolicity of the system .",
    "since the latter is controlled by the parameters of the family , this provides a first analytic guidance as to which values to choose .",
    "unfortunately , the result is somewhat weak , since it just points to an obvious fact : formulations with higher level of hyperbolicity work better .    in the second part of the paper",
    "we perform a set of simple numerical tests .",
    "we consider spacetimes where all variables depend on one spatial coordinate , which we consider compactified for simplicity , and time .",
    "we are able to exhibit explicitly the various types of instabilities that arise in the system",
    ". some of the results are surprising .",
    "for the situation where the system is weakly hyperbolic , the code is strictly non - convergent , but it might appear to converge for a significant range of resolutions .",
    "we will see that the addition of dissipation does not fix these problems , but actually can exacerbate them .",
    "it is often the case in numerical relativity that discretization schemes that are convergent for strongly hyperbolic equations are applied to weakly hyperbolic formulations .",
    "the examples of this section will teach us how dangerous such a practice is and confirm the analytic results of reference @xcite .",
    "this part of the paper is also instructive in that the kst system has only been evolved with pseudo - spectral methods .",
    "we use ordinary integration via the method of lines .",
    "the plan of this paper is as follows . in the next section",
    "we will discuss several notions of stability that are present in the literature , mostly to clarify the notation . in section iii",
    "we discuss the stability of the kst equations in the continuum under linearized perturbations . in section",
    "iv we discuss the numerical simulations .",
    "the term _ stability _ is used in numerical relativity in several different ways .",
    "we therefore wanted to make the notation clear at least in what refers to this paper . sometimes the notion of stability",
    "is used in a purely analytic context , while some other times it is used in a purely numerical one . within analytical contexts , there are cases in which it is used to mean well posedness , as in the book of kreiss and lorenz @xcite . in such a context",
    "well posedness means that the norm of the solution at a fixed time can be bounded by the norm of the initial data , with a bound that is valid for all initial data . in other cases it is intended to measure the growth of perturbations of a certain solution within a formulation of einstein s equations , without special interest in whether the equations are well posed or not .    at the numerical level",
    ", a scheme is sometimes defined as stable if it satisfies a discrete version of well posedness .",
    "this is the sense in which stability ( plus consistency ) is equivalent to convergence via the lax theorem @xcite .",
    "examples of this kind of instability are present in the euler scheme , schemes with courant factor that are too large , or other situations where the amplification factor ( or its generalization ) is bigger than one .",
    "finally , the term stability has also historically been loosely used to mean that a simulation runs for a certain amount of time before crashing , or that the errors remain reasonably bounded as a function of time for a certain amount of time .    at the continuum , part of the problem we want to look at can then be stated as follows .",
    "suppose there is a certain solution @xmath0 of einstein s equations which is bounded for all times .",
    "one can prescribe the initial data @xmath1 that uniquely determines , through the use of the evolution equations , that solution .",
    "however , if one gives initial data slightly different from @xmath1 , the corresponding solution might grow without bound or even blow up in a finite amount of time",
    ". this can happen either because this is the physical situation , or because the new solution @xmath2 does not satisfy the constraints , or does satisfy them but it is in a gauge that is becoming ill defined .",
    "numerical simulations may blow up even when one tries to model physically stable spacetimes .",
    "this is the case for evolutions of schwarzschild or kerr black holes ( which are known to be at least linearly stable with respect to physical perturbations . )",
    "the time growth of solutions of a given set of partial differential equations can be classified according to whether or not it can be bounded by a time function that does not depend on the initial data .",
    "this leads to the concept of well posedness .",
    "namely , a system of partial differential equations is said to be well posed at a solution @xmath3 if there is a @xmath4 and some norm such that @xmath5 for all solutions @xmath6 with @xmath7 sufficiently close to @xmath8 . for linear equations",
    "the bound can be tightened to an exponential , but for nonlinear systems @xmath9 might be any other function that can even diverge at finite @xmath4 .",
    "the strength of equation ( [ bound ] ) characterizes the property that the bound is independent of the details of the initial data ; in particular , of their frequency components .",
    "this is important in numerical simulations , where more ( and higher ) frequency components appear when resolution is increased .",
    "well posedness is a necessary condition in order to have long term , convergent evolutions , but it is not sufficient .",
    "indeed , the function @xmath9 can grow quickly in time . in order to control @xmath9 one",
    "has to go beyond well posedness and study non - principal terms .",
    "we will now apply these ideas to the kst equations .",
    "starting from the arnowitt , deser and misner ( adm ) equations , kst derive a family of strongly hyperbolic first - order evolution equations for the three - metric ( @xmath10 ) , the extrinsic curvature ( @xmath11 ) , and the spatial derivatives of the three - metric ( @xmath12 ) , which generalizes previous well posed formulations @xcite . a priori prescribing the densitized lapse @xmath13 as a function of spacetime , the lapse @xmath14 is given by @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the determinant of the three - metric and @xmath17 a parameter . the shift vector , @xmath18 ,",
    "is also assumed to be prescribed as a function of spacetime .",
    "we define the derivative operator along the normal to the hypersurfaces as @xmath19 the vacuum evolution equations have the form @xmath20 where the constraint variables @xmath21ij}\\ , . &",
    "\\hbox{(''closedness '' of $ d_{kij}$ ) } \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] have been added to the right - hand side of the evolution equations with some free parameteres @xmath22 . here ,",
    "@xmath23 and @xmath24 , @xmath25 are defined as the traces of @xmath26 : @xmath27 the `` remainder '' terms @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 are homogeneous polynomials of degree @xmath32 in @xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath11 ( this will have direct consequences on the linear stability , as discussed below ) , where the coefficients may depend on @xmath10 .",
    "finally , the lie derivative of the symbols @xmath33 is @xmath35    the evolution system has characteristic speeds @xmath36 , where @xmath37 it should be noted that these are the characteristic speeds with respect to the @xmath38 operator .",
    "this means that @xmath39 correspond to propagation along the normal to the hypersurfaces or the light cone , respectively .",
    "the characteristic speeds @xmath40 with respect to the @xmath41 operator are obtained from these after the transformation @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the direction of the corresponding characterisitic mode .",
    "the conditions under which the system is completely ill posed ( cip ) , weakly hyperbolic ( wh ) or strongly hyperbolic ( sh ) ( see next subsection for these definitions ) were found in kst .",
    "the system is cip if any of the above speeds is complex , while it is wh if @xmath44 for @xmath45 but one of the conditions ( [ eq : sh1 ] , [ eq : sh2 ] ) below is violated . finally , the system is sh provided that @xcite @xmath46 for example , if the parameters ( @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 ) are all zero the dynamics is equivalent to the adm equations written in first order form with fixed densitized lapse and fixed shift ( which are wh ) . if @xmath51 as well , then the system is equivalent to the adm equations with fixed lapse and shift ( which are also wh ) .    in kst",
    "seven extra parameters are introduced and used to make changes of variables in @xmath11 and @xmath33 . when performing this change of variables the constraint @xmath52",
    "is also used in order to trade spatial derivatives of the three - metric for @xmath33 .",
    "thus , the equations with the new variables have different solutions off the constraint surface .",
    "however , one can see that at the linear level this change of variables does not involve the addition of constraints .      here",
    "we study the linear stability of the kst system considering perturbations of minkowski spacetime written in cartesian coordinates .",
    "that is , we assume that the background quantities are @xmath53 in fact , since both @xmath54 and @xmath18 can be freely specified , we will first fix them to their background values for simplicity ( the more general case is analyzed at the end of this section . ) because the non - principal part of the evolution equations for @xmath11 and @xmath33 depends quadratically on @xmath11 , @xmath33 and the derivatives of @xmath54 , only the principal part remains when we linearize these evolution equations . more precisely , the linearized equations have the following structure : @xmath55 where @xmath56 and @xmath57 are spatial , first order , differential linear operators with constant coefficients",
    ". furthermore , perturbations of the three - metric do not appear in the equations for @xmath11 and @xmath33 . as a consequence , it is sufficient to consider only these equations ; after having solved them , the three - metric is obtained through a time integration .",
    "so , the relevant linear evolution equations have the form @xmath58 where @xmath59 is a `` vector '' formed by the components of @xmath11 and @xmath33 ( @xmath59 has , thus , @xmath60 independent components ) ; and @xmath61 are @xmath62 matrices .",
    "since the matrices @xmath61 have constant coefficients and we want to make an analysis in the absence of boundaries , we consider a three - torus with periodic boundary conditions as a domain and analyze equation ( [ four ] ) through fourier expansion .",
    "that is , we write @xmath63 the solution to equation ( [ four ] ) is , then @xmath64 where @xmath65 , called the symbol , is defined by @xmath66 there are three different possibilities for the behavior of @xmath67 :    1 .",
    "the system is sh : @xmath68 has real eigenvalues and is diagonalizable , the solution simply oscillates in time .",
    "nevertheless , we should keep in mind that the three - metric can grow linearly in time if @xmath69 , see eqs .",
    "( [ eq - linkst ] ) .",
    "it is not difficult to see that this mode corresponds to an infinitesimal coordinate transformation .",
    "the system is only wh : @xmath68 has real eigenvalues but is not diagonalizable . besides the zero - frequency growth in the metric , the jordan blocks of dimension @xmath70 in @xmath68 allow for growth in @xmath59 that goes as @xmath71 , where @xmath72 .",
    "3 .   the system is cip : @xmath68 has at least one complex eigenvalue . besides the previous growing modes",
    ", there can be exponential frequency dependent growth , i.e.   @xmath73 .    to summarize , the linear stability properties of minkowski spacetime depend only on the hyperbolicity of the system , since the non - principal terms are zero ( except for the evolution equation for @xmath10 , but this equation decouples to linear order . )",
    "stability advantages of the choice of parameters empirically found by kst in their analysis of a single black hole spacetime can not be displayed in the example we have considered .",
    "finally , we study the effect of having a non - vanishing linearized ( maybe densitized ) lapse and shift : in this case , there are two extra terms in the evolution equation for @xmath11 and @xmath26 : @xmath74 since we assume that @xmath54 and @xmath18 are prescribed , the solutions to these equations will have the form of the sum of a homogeneous solution and a particular solution .",
    "it is not difficult to find a particular solution , because we expect that a variation of @xmath54 and @xmath18 induces an ( infinitesimal ) coordinate transformation @xmath75 with respect to which , in this case , @xmath76 in fact , if we make the ansatz @xmath77 , @xmath78 , we get a particular solution to the system ( [ eq - linkstlb ] ) if @xmath79 after a fourier decomposition , this system has the form @xmath80 where @xmath81 and @xmath82 are formed by the fourier amplitudes of @xmath83 , @xmath84 and @xmath54 , @xmath85 , respectively @xmath86 , and @xmath87 by choosing the homogeneous solution to satisfy the appropriate initial data , it is enough to consider a particular solution with @xmath88 , @xmath89 if @xmath90 ( as must be the case if the system is sh ) , the matrix @xmath91 is diagonalizable , with real eigenvalues @xmath92 , @xmath93 . since the norm of @xmath94 can be bounded by a constant that does not depend on @xmath95 nor on @xmath96 ( for example , if @xmath97 , the matrix @xmath98 is symmetric and @xmath99 is unitary ) , this implies that @xmath81 can grow at most linearly in time if @xmath82 is uniformly bounded in time .",
    "if @xmath81 grows at most linearly in time , the same will hold for the main variables @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath33 , see ( [ eq : gaugetrsf ] ) . again , we do not see any dependence on the parameters found by kst in this particular example .",
    "in @xcite we show analytically that the iterated crank  nicholson ( icn ) method with any number of iterations and the second - order runge - kutta methods do not yield convergent discretization schemes for systems of equations that are not strongly hyperbolic , even if dissipation is added . here",
    "we exemplify this through the numerical evolution of the kst system in a simple situation .",
    "we evolve ( [ eq : kst1],[eq : kst2],[eq : kst3 ] ) in one dimension .",
    "that is , all quantities in those equations are assumed to depend only on @xmath95 and @xmath100 .",
    "the sense in which stability is used in this section is that of the lax equivalence theorem , i.e. a scheme is said to be stable if the numerical solution @xmath101 at time @xmath102 satisfies @xmath103 for all initial data @xmath104 and small enough @xmath105 and @xmath106 . here",
    "the index @xmath107 corresponds to the time step and @xmath108 to the spatial mesh point .",
    "it is in this sense that stability plus consistency is equivalent , through lax s theorem , to convergence ( convergence with respect to the same discrete norm in which the scheme is stable and consistent ) .",
    "note that in this context consistency means that the discrete equation approaches the continuum one in the limit of zero grid spacing . in what follows we use the discrete norm",
    "@xmath109    we will use second order runge - kutta ( rk ) for the time evolution .",
    "the spatial derivatives were discretized with centered differences , adding explicit lower order numerical dissipation as well , the amount of it being arbitrary .",
    "most of the simulations presented here will be for rk , though the results are very similar for icn ( see the end of the section ) . in order to isolate our simulations from effects coming from boundary conditions ,",

    "the metric that we evolve , giving the corresponding initial data , is @xmath117 where @xmath118 and @xmath119 are arbitrary functions .",
    "this is an exact solution of einstein s equations that is pure gauge , i.e.  it is flat . in order to illustrate our point",
    "it is enough to make a simple choice for these functions , such as @xmath120 and @xmath121 with @xmath122 $ ] ; furthermore , for the simulations shown below we choose @xmath123 .",
    "a necessary condition in order to get well posedness within the kst system is to choose a positive densitization for the lapse , @xmath124 .",
    "furthermore , one has to take @xmath125 if one wants physical characteristic speeds .",
    "it is worth noticing that with @xmath126 and the metric ( [ plane_metric1 ] ) , the perturbation in the densitization of the lapse @xmath54 is zero ; thus , as shown in section [ kst ] , even off the constraint surface the solutions to sh formulations should only oscillate in time , except for possible zero - frequency linear growth .    in a similar way , choosing @xmath51 results in a wh system , and @xmath127 in a cip one .    densitizing",
    "the lapse is not enough for well posedness .",

    "namely , it seems that the numerical solution has the expected power law growth that the continuum linearized analysis predicts until all of a sudden an exponential growth appears .",

    "we start by considering the one - parametric kst subfamily of strongly hyperbolic formulations of eq.(2.39 ) of kst : @xmath173 this family has , for any value of @xmath174 , characteristic speeds @xmath92 or @xmath175 ( see section [ kst ] ) , for the simulations here shown we chose @xmath176 ( and @xmath177 , @xmath178 , as in the sh simulations previously discussed ) .",
    "figure [ errors_sh_ham ] shows the analog of figure [ errors_sh_dens_res ] . as before",
    ", we do have convergence .",
    "the fourier components of the solution remain constant in time , and the error comes mostly from the numerical speed difference .",
    "norm of the errors for the metric .",
    "[ errors_sh_ham],height=226 ]      here we also use the parameters given by ( [ par_sh ] ) with @xmath176 , except that now we choose @xmath179 . with this choice , @xmath180 , but @xmath181 ; therefore , as summarized in section [ kst ] , the system is wh .",
    "norm of the errors for the metric .",
    "the simulation is stopped once the determinant of the spatial metric becomes zero .",
    "[ errors_wh_ham],height=226 ]    as in the previous subsection , the difference scheme may appear to be convergent , but in fact it is not , see figure [ errors_wh_ham ] .",
    "frequency - dependent exponential growth starting at very small values accumulates and causes the instability .",
    "we have exhaustively experimented with different values for the numerical dissipation without being able to stabilize the code .",
    "next we show some plots to illustrate this . in figure [ dissipation1 ]",
    "we plot one of the fourier components of the numerical metric .",
    "we increase the dissipation parameter @xmath114 , starting from @xmath182 , and double it each time , while keeping the resolution and courant factor fixed . at the beginning",
    "the rate of the exponential growth becomes smaller when one increases @xmath183 , though it is never completely suppressed , which causes the code to be non convergent .",
    "however , when one reaches the value @xmath184 the instability is even worse than adding less dissipation , and the same thing happens if one keeps on increasing @xmath185 beyond @xmath186 .    , title=\"fig:\",height=226 ] , title=\"fig:\",height=226 ] , title=\"fig:\",height=226 ]    so we next narrow the interval in which the dissipation is fine tuned , we start at @xmath187 , and increase at intervals of @xmath188 .",
    "we find the same result , at @xmath189 there is already too much dissipation and the situation is worse .",
    "fine tuning even more , we change @xmath185 in intervals of @xmath190 around @xmath191 , but it is also found that for @xmath192 the effect of more dissipation is adverse , as also shown in figure [ dissipation1 ] .",
    "the fact that beyond @xmath193 the situation becomes worse is in perfect agreement with the discrete analysis of @xcite .",
    "there we show that a necessary condition for the von neumann condition to be satisfied is @xmath194 . here",
    "the upper limit of @xmath195 corresponds to , precisely , @xmath196 . exceeding this value results in a violation of the von neumann condition ; as explained in @xcite ,",
    "when this happens there is a numerical instability that grows explonentially with the number of gridpoints ( i.e. as in the cip case ) , much faster than when the von neumann condition is satisfied ( in which case the growth goes as a power of the gridpoints ) .",
    "finally , it is worthwhile to point out that we have also tried with smaller courant factors , using , in particular , values often used in numerical relativity , like @xmath197 and @xmath198 , without ever being able to get a completely convergent simulation .",
    "finally here also use the parameters ( [ par_sh ] ) with @xmath176 , but now we take @xmath199 , which implies @xmath200 and , thus , the system is cip .",
    "the results are as expected .",
    "there is exponential , frequency - dependent growth that makes the numerical scheme unstable , see figure [ errors_ip_constraint ] .",
    "norm of the errors for the metric .",
    "[ errors_ip_constraint],height=226 ]      performing simulations with icn instead of rk yields similar results , as predicted in @xcite .",
    "figure [ errors_icn_dens ] shows , for example , evolutions changing the densitization of the lapse , as in the first subsection , but using icn with two iterations ( counting this number as in @xcite ) .",
    "this is the minimum number of iterations that yields a stable scheme for well posed equations but , as shown in @xcite , it is unstable for wh systems .",
    "the same values of courant factor and dissipation as above were used in these runs .",
    "norm of the errors for the metric using icn .",
    "[ errors_icn_dens],title=\"fig:\",height=226 ]   norm of the errors for the metric using icn .",
    "[ errors_icn_dens],title=\"fig:\",height=226 ]    we have also tried with other values of courant factor and dissipation parameter , finding similar results . we were able to confirm the lack of convergence predicted in @xcite in every wh or cip formulation we used , including the adm equations rewritten as first order equations in time space .",
    "lack of convergence with a 3d code , using the adm equations written as second order in space and icn , for the same initial data used here , has also been confirmed @xcite .",
    "we have shown that a linearized analysis of the kst equations implies that flat space - time written in cartesian coordinates is a stable solution of the equations if the parameters are chosen in such a way that the system is strongly hyperbolic .",
    "no further restrictions on the parameters are placed by this analysis .",
    "we have also integrated numerically the kst equations and shown that the system can not be made stable ( in the sense of lax ) and therefore convergent if the parameters are not chosen in such a way that the system is strongly hyperbolic .",
    "no amount of artificial viscosity was able to fix the problem .",
    "the conclusions of section [ kst ] are , to some extent , similar to those of alcubierre _",
    "et al_. , who find that , at the linearized level , the advantages of the baumgarte  shapiro  shibata ",
    "nakamura @xcite with respect to the adm formulation come from the fact that the first one is ` more ' hyperbolic",
    ". however , since it is not ` completely ' hyperbolic , an ill posed ( zero speed , in the notation of @xcite ) mode is still present in bssn .",
    "the conformal traceless ( ct ) decomposition is therefore introduced as a way of decoupling that mode .",
    "however , one could , instead , get rid of that mode by using a different choice of lapse .",
    "more explicitly , in the analysis of @xcite exact lapse is used , but it is not difficult to see that choosing , for example , densitized lapse with , say , @xmath126 , gets rid of the ill posed mode ( indeed , certain version of bssn with densitized lapse has been recently used in a 3d evolution of a single black hole @xcite ) . moreover , as shown in @xcite , the result is much stronger : even at the nonlinear level appropriately writing bssn with densitized lapse results in a reduction ( from first to second order in space ) of certain strongly or symmetric hyperbolic formulations .",
    "the lack of convergence in evolutions of wh or cip systems with schemes that are convergent for well posed equations seems to have been overlooked in the past .",
    "if the von neumann condition is satisfied , one could be easily misled to think that the scheme is convergent , especially if coarse resolutions are used , the evolution is short , or few frequencies are present in the initial data .",
    "here we have shown that this lack of convergence does appear in concrete simulations , even in very simple ones .",
    "these numerical experiments , together with the theorem of reference @xcite should be enough evidence to cast serious doubts on any simulation performed with evolution equations that are weakly hyperbolic that are not accompanied by very detailed convergence studies .    summarizing , we do have analytical tools at our disposal to constrain schemes and predict to a certain extent their behavior under numerical evolution .",
    "in fact , the examples shown suggest that in the case of linearized equations , the analytical tools are complete : one can a priori tell if a code will work or not . in the non - linear case further tools will need to be developed to achieve the same status with respect to predicting the performance of a code before running it .",
