    "electrons behave as dirac fermions , albeit with a small `` speed of light '' , so it seems natural to look for the anomaly in condensed matter .    on a deeper level",
    ", there is a subtle problem , known as fermion doubling , which often prevents the anomaly .",
    "for example , electron states in a sheet of graphite are well described at low energies as 2-component massless dirac fermions in 2 + 1 dimensions . because the unit cell contains 2 lattice sites , there are 2 fermion species living at inequivalent fermi points in the brillouin zone .",
    "semenoff observed that a symmetry breaking mass term @xmath1 will be induced if the inequivalent sites are populated by different atoms .",
    "unfortunately , the 2 species have mass terms of opposite signs.@xcite the total anomalous current ( [ cs-1 ] ) vanishes .",
    "later , fradkin , dagotto and boyanovsky@xcite ( fdb ) suggested a possible way to circumvent the problem of fermion doubling .",
    "lead chalcogenides pbte , pbse , and pbs are semiconductors with a narrow gap ( @xmath7@xmath8 ev ) between conduction and valence bands.@xcite low - energy fermion quasiparticles are concentrated around 4 inequivalent l points in the brillouin zone , @xmath9 and three others related by cubic symmetry .",
    "the band structure near each l point is such that the quasiparticles resemble 4-component massive dirac fermions ( in 3 + 1 dimensions ) .",
    "4 components result from 2 inequivalent sites in a unit cell and 2 possible projections of a spin @xmath10 .",
    "fdb pointed out that a stack fault in a crystal creates a domain wall , on which one finds 2 + 1 dimensional massless dirac fermions . in this",
    "setting , certain perturbations can induce a mass term of _ the same _ sign in all 4 fermion species . the anomalous current ( [ cs-1 ] )",
    "does not have to vanish .    in a more detailed paper,@xcite fdb suggested that a symmetry - breaking mass term @xmath1 can be induced by a peierls distortion , which is present in some lead chalcogenides.@xcite that does not sound right : a peierls distortion violates parity but leaves time reversal intact , therefore it can not possibly induce a chern - simons current ( [ cs-1 ] ) .",
    "haldane has argued that this incarnation of parity anomaly is caused by an unphysical lattice hamiltonian used by fdb , which is ( or seems to be ) odd under time reversal.@xcite upon further reflection , this argument does not work : if a continuum limit derives from a model with lattice potential and spin - orbit interaction , it can not violate the time - reversal symmetry .",
    "then why does the fdb hamiltonian couple spin and linear momentum via the term @xmath11  that seems to break @xmath12 ?",
    "the answer : the @xmath13 matrices here are _ not _ the electron spin variables .",
    "symmetry under time reversal need not be broken .",
    "the existence of the anomalous chern - simons current is then questionable .",
    "being field theorists , fdb did nt bother to derive their hamiltonian ( nor its continuum version ) from any physical model of electrons in a lattice potential and with the spin - orbit interaction .",
    "their phenomenological hamiltonian was merely tailored to correctly reproduce the energy spectrum of the conduction and valence bands near the fermi level .",
    "therefore the @xmath13 matrices in it have nothing to do with the actual electron spin . but without knowing which physical variables the @xmath13 matrices represent , one can not learn how this or that physical perturbation ( e.g. , a peierls distortion ) couples to the fermion zero modes .",
    "then it is impossible to determine correctly the sign of charge  or the direction of hall current  induced by a symmetry - breaking perturbation .    to clear up the matter ,",
    "i have derived a correct continuum approximation for low - lying electron states both by appealing to symmetry arguments ( the easy way ) and by using the standard @xmath14 method combined with a tight - binding approximation@xcite ( see appendix ) .",
    "i have studied the behavior of massless fermions bound to a domain wall and enumerated _ all _ symmetry - breaking perturbations that raise or lower the zero modes in magnetic field , thus inducing surface charge ( [ cs-0 ] ) .",
    "the results of this study are unambiguous .",

    "the fdb hamiltonian ( in the continuum limit ) can be derived from a tight - binding model of noninteracting electrons that includes electron kinetic energy , periodic lattice potential , and spin - orbit interaction:@xcite @xmath18\\cdot { \\bf p}}{4m^2c^2}.\\ ] ] this hamiltonian is invariant under parity and time reversal .",

    "such a perturbation will contain @xmath69 , @xmath70 , or @xmath71 .",

    "one obviously needs a pseudoscalar perturbation ( odd under both @xmath26 and @xmath12 ) in order to relate a scalar ( charge ) to the pseudoscalar @xmath77 .",
    "this is why a pseudoscalar @xmath74 will work ( and a vector @xmath76 will not ) .",
    "alternatively , one can use a pseudovector @xmath72 ( e.g. , staggered field of an antiferromagnetic order parameter ) to construct a pseudoscalar @xmath78 .    to corroborate these general considerations ,",
    "i discuss in some detail several symmetry - breaking terms that might exist in a physical system .",
    "we need to add to the @xmath79 dimensional dirac hamiltonian ( [ dirac3 + 1 ] ) a term that breaks @xmath26 but not @xmath12 and does not affect electron spin .",

    "antiferromagnetic order , which violates the time - reversal symmetry , could lead to an observable chern - simons current in the system .",
    "unfortunately , the prospects of observing such an effect are rather dim : not only would this require antiferromagnetism , but also the nel order parameter must be ( anti)parallel to the applied magnetic field . in a heisenberg antiferromagnet , @xmath102 stays orthogonal to @xmath85 , in which case the entire effect vanishes .    in hindsight , this foray into the dreamworld of field theory is a reminder to a condensed - matter physicist : trust your intuition .",
