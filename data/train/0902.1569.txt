    "einstein s theory of general relativity ( gr ) has passed numerous consistency and experimental tests in a spectacular way @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , it is a general consensus that gr will get modified at some scale , if only because gr has resisted all attempts at its quantization .",
    "moreover , other theories of gravity also pass the experimental tests , some with a better `` quantum behavior '' and should be taken as serious candidates .",
    "unfortunately , the majority of these alternative theories are vastly more complex than gr in their full - fledged form .",
    "it is thus not surprising that progress in understanding the exact differences between one and the other and specially differences one can measure experimentally have been slow and mostly focusing on the weak- , far - field behavior .",
    "one of the candidates for a theory of quantum gravity is string theory @xcite .",
    "since it is still difficult to study geometrical settings in superstring theories , most analyses have been performed by using low - energy string - inspired effective theories @xcite .",
    "thus , quantum gravity predictions can be tested by studying modifications of gr due to some low - energy truncation of string theory @xcite .",
    "typically the effective theories are supergravities involving not only the metric but also a scalar field ( the dilaton ) as well as several gauge fields @xcite .",
    "one of such theories is the one - loop corrected four - dimensional effective theory of the heterotic superstrings at low energies and a simple particular case is known as einstein - dilatonic - gauss - bonnet ( edgb ) theory ( see for instance ref . @xcite and references cited therein for a nice and concise introduction to this theory ) . in edgb",
    "theory the gauge fields are neglected and only the ( spacetime - dependent ) coupling between the dilaton and the gravity is considered , with the anomaly - canceling chern - simons term also neglected ( see for instance @xcite for work taking this term into account ) . at the first order in the regge slope , @xmath0 , higher - derivative gravitational terms such as",
    "the gauss - bonnet ( gb ) curvature - squared term are present in the action , hence the name .",
    "the gb terms avoid some pathological features , for example the theory is ghost - free .",
    "since the equations of motions are still of second order , edgb theory provides one of the simplest consistent high - energy modifications to gr . even though it does not seem to be a viable cosmological model @xcite , the parametrized post - newtonian @xcite expansion of this theory is identical ( to lowest order ) to that of gr @xcite , which means that it passes all solar system - like experimental tests of gravity .",
    "differences arise only from full nonlinear effects and the ideal place to look for these is near compact objects such as black holes .",
    "dilatonic black holes ( dbhs ) do exist in edgb theory @xcite .",
    "they have a regular event horizon and the geometry is asymptotically flat at infinity ( recently dbhs in higher dimensions @xcite and with non - flat asymptotical geometries @xcite have also been studied ) . in what follows",
    "we refer to dbhs in edgb theory only .",
    "dbhs are interesting for many theoretical and practical reasons .",
    "dbhs can evade the classical  no - scalar - hair \" theorem  @xcite , and be dressed with classical non - trivial dilaton hair .",
    "this is a direct consequence of the gb term  @xcite and opens up the exciting possibility of ruling out such objects and theories by testing the no - hair theorem , either by gravitational - wave observations of ringdown @xcite or by observations of highly eccentric orbits around supermassive black holes @xcite .",
    "the lack of experimental data and some problems on the theoretical side make it very difficult to explore string theory and other theories of quantum gravity .",
    "since quantum gravity effects are expected to play a significant role in strong gravity regime such as in cosmology @xcite and in black hole physics , the investigation of bhs in edgb theory can shed new light on some aspects of quantum gravity and/or be used to develop testable predictions of the theory .",
    "our purpose here is to begin exploring differences between gr and alternative theories that could be experimentally tested through astrophysical observations , in the strong field regime .",
    "thus , even though the theory with which we will work is only a first order truncation of the full action , we will elevate it to the status of a complete theory , therefore we place no restriction on the regge slope .",
    "the first important problem concerns the stability of dbhs .",
    "credible alternatives to the schwarzschild and kerr metric of gr must be stable spacetimes . it has been shown @xcite that dbhs are stable against a small subset of all possible perturbations , linear _ radial _ perturbations . in this work",
    "we characterize completely half of the possible degrees of freedom , by studying general _ axial _ perturbations .",
    "we find that dbhs are stable also against these perturbations . by itself",
    "this is an interesting result confirming that high - energy contributions lead to viable alternatives to classical bhs arising in gr .",
    "the viability of dbhs poses the following question : can one devise observational tests to discern a dbh from a classical bh ? in classical einstein - maxwell theory bhs are characterized by three parameters @xcite : mass @xmath1 , electric charge @xmath2 and angular momentum @xmath3 .",
    "astrophysical bhs are likely to be electrically neutral because of the effect of surrounding plasma @xcite , and therefore tests of alternative theories of gravity can in general focus on rotation alone .",
    "the task is still highly non - trivial and as we mentioned earlier , strong - field effects must be searched for in theories that are not already ruled out by solar - system experimental data @xcite .",
    "most if not all of present - day astrophysical observations related to compact objects , concern directly or indirectly the motion of matter .",
    "thus , a study of geodesic motion around compact objects in alternative theories is of utmost importance .",
    "geodesics convey very important information on the background geometry .",
    "in particular circular orbits whose radius is close to the horizon may be extremely useful , because they already probe strong field regions .",
    "they can be used to compute the `` innermost - stable - circular - orbit '' ( isco ) , a notion which is very important for interpretation of the experimental data concerning astrophysical black holes . for the schwarzschild spacetime , @xmath4 , while for an extremal rotating kerr geometry , @xmath5 ,  @xmath6 for co- and counter - rotating circular orbits respectively .",
    "measurements of the isco are also useful to evaluate the angular momentum of kerr bhs @xcite .",
    "current methods to measure the isco include spectral fitting , quasi - periodic oscillations and relativistic iron line measurements @xcite . here",
    "we show that differences in the isco of slowly rotating dbhs and classical kerr black holes can be significant , depending on the coupling parameter .",
    "these differences , which may be detectable in near - future experiments , are likely to increase for highly spinning black holes ( which are unfortunately out of the scope of this work ) .",
    "in fact , it seems an exciting possibility that the gravity experiment @xcite , designed to make precision measurements of orbits of stars in the neighborhood of the black - hole in the center of our galaxy , might already be able to discriminate between these black hole solutions and gr solutions , or otherwise impose stringent bounds on the coupling parameter .",
    "current techniques to evaluate the angular momentum of astrophysical compact objects are based only on isco measurements @xcite .",
    "one needs to _ assume _ a particular theory of gravity in order to evaluate @xmath7 . thus discerning a dbh from a kerr black hole by isco measurements",
    "is not an easy task .",
    "future gravitational wave experiments will provide a viable method to measure @xmath1 and @xmath7 independently @xcite .",
    "the analysis below suggests that a _ possible _ deviation from the expected isco in gr can be explained in term of dilatonic charged bh .",
    "therefore in a near future , gravitational wave astronomy may offer a the possiblity to explore string theory - inspired modifications of gr .",
    "finally , null unstable geodesics are closely related to the appearance of compact objects to external observers @xcite and have been associated with the characteristic , or quasinormal modes ( qnms ) of bhs @xcite .",
    "quasinormal modes are very important in devising experimental tests of gr and for gravitational wave astronomy .",
    "measuring qnm frequencies may provide a definitive proof of the existence of bhs in gr and it could be useful to study corrections to gr too .",
    "thus the analysis of geodesic motion around a dbh can shed new light on various and important aspects of high - curvature corrections to gravity .",
    "other theories might also suggest a different isco location , different quasinormal modes , etc .",
    "thus , a deviation in these quantities is not a verification of a particular theory , but is a first step in understanding what different theories and scenarios predict in the strong field regime , which could potentially discriminate gr from other alternatives .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ formalism ]",
    "we briefly review the main aspects of bhs in edgb theory . in section [ stability ] we prove the linear stability of dbhs against axial perturbations .",
    "we proceed by studying slowly rotating dbhs in section [ smallrot ] .",
    "we prove that such slowly rotating solutions do exist and we characterize them , including a discussion on the ergoregion in these spacetimes .",
    "section [ geodesics ] discusses geodesics in both spherically symmetric and slowly rotating dbhs as well as the possible experimental tests which can be performed to discern a dbh from a kerr bh .",
    "we compute the isco dependence on the angular momentum and the qnm frequencies for a spherical symmetric dbh in the eikonal limit .",
    "conclusions are discussed in section [ conclusion ] . in our notation",

    "we consider the following low - energy effective action for the heterotic string @xcite s = d^4 x ( r-_^+^2_gb ) , [ eq : action ] where @xmath10 is the gb invariant , @xmath0 is the regge slope and @xmath11 is some gauge coupling constant .",

    "string - inspired @xmath13 corrections to einstein s gravitation are included in the action ( [ eq : action ] ) , while gauge fields and matter are omitted for simplicity .",

    "<S> our case study here are dilatonic black holes , which arise in the framework of gauss - bonnet couplings and one - loop corrected four - dimensional effective theory of heterotic superstrings at low energies . </S>",
    "<S> these are interesting objects as a prototype for alternative , yet well - behaved gravity theories : they evade the `` no - hair '' theorem of general relativity but were proved to be stable against radial perturbations .    </S>",
    "<S> we investigate the viability of these black holes as astrophysical objects and try to provide some means to distinguish them from black holes in general relativity . </S>",
    "<S> we start by extending previous works and establishing the stability of these black holes against axial perturbations . </S>",
    "<S> we then look for solutions of the field equations describing slowly rotating black holes and study geodesic motion around this geometry . depending on the values of mass , dilaton charge and angular momentum of the solution </S>",
    "<S> , one can have differences in the isco location and orbital frequency , relatively to black holes in general relativity . in the most favorable cases the difference amount to a few percent . </S>",
    "<S> given the current state - of - the - art , we discuss the difficulty to distinguish the correct theory of gravity from em observations or even with gravitational wave detectors . </S>"
