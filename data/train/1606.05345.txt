    "the collapse of an isolated , spherical top hat under the action of gravity is a well studied problem in large - scale structure cosmology @xcite , and a rare example of non - linear gravitational evolution that can be solved exactly . in an einstein - de sitter ( flat , @xmath6 ) cosmological model ,",
    "it is well known that this ` spherical model ' predicts that non - linear collapse should have occurred when linear theory would predict a perturbation to have reached the ` critical overdensity ' value @xmath7 .",
    "this number is the height of the barrier that must be crossed in analytical calculations of the halo mass function ( e.g.,@xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "if one additionally assumes that the top hat will virialize then the resulting halo is predicted to be @xmath8 times denser than the background .",
    "this virial criterion is used to inform halo finding algorithms in cosmological @xmath1-bodysimulations , where it is standard to define haloes as objects that are @xmath9 times denser than the background .",
    "the spherical - collapse model can be solved when @xmath10 , and deviations from the einsten - de sitter results are found .",
    "these solutions may provide insights into how gravitational collapse changes in non - standard cosmologies ( e.g.,dark energy : @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ; modified gravity : @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ; massive neutrinos : @xcite ) .",
    "the spherical - collapse calculation was first carried out for non - flat cosmologies by @xcite and for @xmath3cdmby @xcite who show that @xmath4 decreases a small amount ( by less than one per cent ) as the universe evolves to @xmath11 , while @xmath5 with respect to the background matter density , _ not _ the critical density .",
    "] increases more drastically ( approximately doubles ) .",
    "the spherical - collapse model is clearly very simplistic , and it is not obvious that accurate spherical - model calculations have a role in accurate predictions for cosmological observables such as the halo mass function or @xmath12-point statistics .",
    "should we treat the spherical model as nothing other than a provider of a general trend , or should we continue to carry out accurate spherical collapse calculations for new cosmological models ? answering these questions by investigating haloes in @xmath1-bodysimulations is complicated because halo finding algorithms often bunch particles into haloes in a way that is inconsistent with the spherical model . for example , haloes may be defined with a user - set spherical - overdensity ( so ) criterion , independent of the background cosmology , or via a friends - of - friends ( fof ) algorithm with a fixed linking length .",
    "it is not obvious that either algorithm provides the ` correct ' definition of a halo , given that so assumes sphericity where haloes are obviously not spherical , while fof can link visually distinct structures via a bridge and has non - trivial dependencies on mass resolution and halo profile @xcite .",
    "these issues contribute to conflicting claims regarding universality ; to what extent can the mass function be expressed as a redshift- and cosmology - independent function of the variance in the linear density field ?",
    "some authors have demonstrated the mass function to be a close - to - universal function , but only when haloes are identified with a fixed so threshold ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) or fixed fof linking length ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "there are conflicting claims in the literature regarding universality when different identification criteria are used .",
    "@xcite , @xcite and @xcite report a breakdown of universality , but more recently claims to the contrary have been made by @xcite who see mass function universality across a range of @xmath3cdmcosmological parameters when using @xmath5 predictions to define haloes with a so criterion .    in this paper",
    "i test the spherical - collapse model in a true cosmological setting by examining differences in @xmath1-bodysimulations that have a fixed @xmath0 linear power spectrum shape and amplitude , but that have different growth histories .",
    "the fixing of linear modes isolates non - linear differences and i question whether the spherical model is useful for understanding these residuals .",
    "the most obvious tests involve investigating haloes directly , as has been done previously ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) , but in doing so one encounters problems associated with the vagaries of halo definition .",
    "i circumvent this by comparing the matter power spectra measured from the simulations to predictions from the halo model of structure formation when i vary the halo - model ingredients .",
    "the question that i wish to address is ; does the cosmology dependence of @xmath4 and @xmath5 have any real relevance for real structure formation as the underlying cosmology is changed ?",
    "this paper is ordered as follows : in section  [ sec : spherical_collapse ] i review the spherical collapse model . in section  [ sec : halo_identification ] i discuss halo identification methods and why the spherical collapse model is difficult to test if one is tied to a particular halo definition",
    ". simulations of cosmological models with different forms of dark energy , but fixed @xmath0 linear power spectra , are then presented in section  [ sec : simulations ] and their non - linear differences are discussed . in section  [ sec : halo_model ] i discuss the halo model , which is my method of choice for comparing spherical - collapse predictions to simulations .",
    "results of these comparisons are then presented in section  [ sec : results ] , which is followed by a summary in section  [ sec : summary ] .",
    "it is possible to follow the evolution of a spherically symmetric ` top - hat ' perturbation in an otherwise featureless universe using both linear and non - linear theory .",
    "clearly the linear treatment will not be accurate once the perturbation is sufficiently developed , but successful approaches to understanding the mass function @xcite use the idea of haloes forming once the _ linear _ density field passes a threshold value , and have proved to be extremely useful in describing features of the non - linear universe .",
    "i will be interested in the matter overdensity , @xmath13 , defined relative to the background matter density via @xmath14 . under the assumption that a spherical hat remains a spherical hat throughout its evolution",
    "the non - linear equation of motion for the overdensity is : @xmath15 where a dot denotes a time derivative and @xmath16 is the hubble parameter . if @xmath6 and @xmath17 , then @xmath18 , but growth accelerates as the perturbation develops .",
    "if the perturbation is sufficiently extreme it will reach a maximum size and then collapse comes to dominate at late times a perturbation can be prevented from collapsing by the compensating outward acceleration .",
    "] , defined as the time when @xmath19 , which occurs as a result of the exact spherical symmetry . on linearising equation  ( [ eq : spherical_tophat ] ) the standard expression for the linear evolution of an arbitrary perturbation configuration is recovered : @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the linearised @xmath13 .",
    "the linear collapse threshold , @xmath4 , is defined as the value that the linear field has reached when @xmath19 in the non - linear calculation . in an einstein - de sitter cosmology @xmath22 , and",
    "the trend with cosmological parameters is that @xmath4 decreases very slightly as @xmath23 decreases .",
    "for example , @xmath24 for @xmath25 in @xmath3cdm , a decrease of @xmath26 per cent .",
    "the virialized density contrast of the collapsed hat , @xmath5 , is calculated by applying the virial theorem at the time of collapse , which sets the radius of the structure .",
    "anisotropy in any realistic perturbation will prevent it from collapsing to a singularity , and violent relaxation @xcite will then allow virilization . in an einstein - de sitter cosmology",
    "the radius of the collapsed halo is half the radius of the perturbation at turnaround , giving @xmath8 .",
    "@xmath5 changes in different cosmologies , with the trend that it increases as @xmath23 decreases in @xmath3cdm(i always define @xmath5 relative to the background matter density ) .",
    "virialization is a more tricky concept with a cosmological constant @xcite because this provides an outward radial force that counters self - gravity in a halo to some extent , meaning the halo should collapse to a smaller size to virialize . for other dark energy models , a physical model is required before virialization can be fully described @xcite . even if dark energy is taken to be exactly homogeneous , the amount of dark energy in a collapsed halo changes over time in dynamical models , meaning that virialization may never be achieved @xcite . for realistic haloes ( i.e. , not top hats )",
    "the importance of the outward force provided by dark energy will be profile dependent , and it is not obvious that a solution to virialization in the top - hat case will be relevant to real structure formation .",
    "therefore , in this paper i ignore the direct effect of dark energy on virialization and simply set the virial radius of haloes to be half the maximum perturbation radius , independently of the underlying cosmological parameters .",
    "for @xmath3cdmthis gives @xmath27 for @xmath28 , an increase of @xmath29 per cent compared to @xmath6 .",
    "if instead one includes the cosmological constant in the virilization process ( e.g. , * ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) then @xmath30 , and so the difference between these approaches is @xmath31 per cent .",
    "the spherical - collapse model makes predictions that relate to collapsed haloes , and to compare directly with @xmath1-bodysimulations haloes need to be identified from the particle distribution .",
    "typically , these are found using either a friends - of - friends ( fof ; @xcite ) or a spherical - overdensity ( so ; @xcite ) algorithm .",
    "different halo - finding techniques are compared in @xcite . in fof , a linking length is set and haloes are defined as sets of particles that are within the linking length of at least one other particle in the set .",
    "this will lead to non - spherical structures being identified as haloes , and objects that look visually like two distinct haloes may be joined by a bridge . if haloes follow an isothermal profile , @xmath32 , a linking - length in terms of the mean inter - particle separation of @xmath33 translates into an enclosed overdensity of @xmath34 , which is close to the einstein - de sitter predictions from the spherical model , and so @xmath33 is quite standard .",
    "one might be tempted to think that fixing @xmath35 translates into a surface density criterion for haloes identified from particles ; however , @xcite showed via experiments on poisson realisations of isothermal haloes that internal overdensities of fof haloes range from @xmath36 to @xmath37 in a way that depends on the number of particles resolving the halo , and that no clear iso - density surface is picked out .",
    "therefore the fof mass assigned to a halo will be a function of the mass resolution and @xcite provide a resolution - dependent correction for this effect .",
    "@xcite conduct similar experiments with the more realistic @xcite ( nfw ; @xcite ) haloes and find the average enclosed overdensity of fof haloes is also a function of the halo density profile , so the fof mass will also be profile dependent .",
    "in contrast , so algorithms pick a halo centre ( via either the centre - of - mass of an fof group , or the minimum in the density field or gravitational potential in a region , or using some iterative mix of these ) and then ` grow ' a sphere until this encloses a user - specified overdensity .",
    "the exact details of an algorithm mean that some particles may contribute to more than one halo and that aspherical particle distributions get classified as spheres , when in reality they may have a very different density structure and be strongly aspherical .",
    "so algorithms may also fail to assign some dense regions to any halo if the region falls between two parent haloes . in either fof or so gravitationally unbound particles",
    "may also be removed from a halo .",
    "one semi - obvious fact that should be borne in mind is that isolated spherical haloes with obvious boundaries do not exist in reality . from simulations",
    "one observes that an initially gaussian distribution of linear fluctuations grows and collapses into a ` cosmic web ' with sharp peaks in the density populating a cosmic skeleton .",
    "these peaks attract material and merge with one another , and the density profile around a peak changes over time .",
    "a halo only comes into existence when a somewhat arbitrary boundary is drawn around these peaks ; sometimes these boundaries will encompass multiple peaks ( e.g.,halo substructure or fof overlinking ) and sometimes a spherical shape will be forced upon an obviously non - spherical density distribution ( e.g.,so finders ) .",
    "it should also be remembered that different halo identification methods can be suitable for different tasks .",
    "for example , haloes defined using an so algorithm with @xmath38 may relate to peaks in the density field that can be identified by x - ray observations , but might not be the same haloes that are useful for understanding massive cluster abundance or the details of the small - scale matter distribution .    independently of the details of halo identification",
    ", the mass distribution function of haloes has been shown to be expressible as an approximately universal function in terms of @xmath39 , where @xmath40 is the variance in the linear density field when smoothed on a comoving scale that encloses a mass @xmath41 .",
    "successful analytical calculations of the mass function take the linear density field smoothed on successively smaller scales , and equate the tail of the distribution of overdensity beyond the critical @xmath4 with the cumulative mass function for haloes greater than that filter mass @xcite .",
    "this approach works well in explaining the broad form of the mass function , but fails in detail .",
    "the response has been the development of various fitting functions for the mass function , based on the @xcite idea , but calibrated to high resolution @xmath1-bodysimulations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the details of the mass function therefore depend on the halo identification scheme .",
    "often these mass functions are parameterised in terms of @xmath42 , rather than @xmath43 , and if @xmath4 is incorporated its cosmology dependence is often neglected . even though the changes in @xmath4 with cosmology are small ( @xmath44 1 per cent ) they can have large effects because of the exponential form of the mass function .",
    "for example , for a mass function @xmath45 , a one per - cent decrease in @xmath4 leads to a @xmath46 , @xmath47 and @xmath48 per cent increase in the abundance of @xmath49 , @xmath50 and @xmath51 objects respectively .",
    "@xcite produced the first calibrated , universal mass function by fitting to haloes identified in simulations ; the authors include the cosmology dependence of @xmath4 and identify haloes using so with a cosmology dependent overdensity criterion ( sheth & tormen , private communication ) , but error bars are large because simulations were of low resolution compared to those available today .",
    "@xcite identified haloes using fof and report a universal mass function , but only if a fixed linking length is set independently of cosmology , and their mass function is parameterised as a function of @xmath40 only ( i.e.@xmath4 is phased out ) . @xcite",
    "correct fof masses to account for the finite number of halo particles , but do not investigate the cosmology dependence of the mass function , and parameterise in terms of @xmath52 rather than @xmath43 .",
    "@xcite use fof with @xmath33 and report non - universality in the mass function ; they account for this by including the effective spectral index of the power spectrum at the collapse scale in their fitting function , making it non - universal .",
    "@xcite also note non - universality with @xmath33 fof haloes over a range of @xmath53cdm cosmologies and show that this is not alleviated by including @xmath4 in the mass function .",
    "@xcite use so to define haloes with a variety of fixed @xmath5 and also report non - universality , their mass function is parameterised as in terms of @xmath40 only and includes a universality - breaking redshift dependence .",
    "however , the authors also note that the mass function appears closer to universal if they use fof haloes  a similar conclusion is reached by @xcite .",
    "most recently , @xcite use so with the spherical - model dependence in @xmath5 to define haloes , include @xmath4 changes in their fitting functions , and report universality in the mass function across a range of @xmath3cdmcosmologies .    attempting to isolate the effect of @xmath4 on the mass function",
    "is made difficult because different cosmological models often have different linear spectrum amplitudes and shapes , which changes @xmath40 , and therefore the effect of a @xmath4 change alone is difficult to isolate . despite this",
    ", @xcite demonstrated that , for a fixed fof halo definition , universality _ is _ enhanced in dark energy models if one takes the cosmological dependence of @xmath4 into account in the mass function , but only for the most massive haloes , while deviations from universality remain at lower masses and are not remedied .",
    "the authors also note that the remaining non - universality is correlated with the spherical collapse @xmath5 prediction , but are unable to generate a universal fof mass function using the spherical model to inform the @xmath5 choice .",
    "however , it is certainly possible that enhanced universality might be obtained if more correct cosmology - dependent halo definitions were used @xcite , although due to the observations of @xcite and @xcite this is hard to implement in practice with fof .    attempting to directly compare spherical - model @xmath5 predictions to simulations is hard because one must first define a halo before asking questions about its overdensity .",
    "so algorithms set the @xmath5 threshold manually , whereas with fof one is subjected to the vagaries of the fof method that particularly affect halo size .",
    "therefore , even if one did measure the internal densities of fof haloes it would be unclear how to interpret the results .",

    "dynamical dark energy is parameterised via @xmath54 and is taken to be spatially homogeneous , thus only affecting the background expansion .",
    "all simulations use @xmath55 particles in cubes of size @xmath56 , and start from initial conditions with identical mode phases but amplitudes adjusted to ensure @xmath57 at @xmath0 .",
