    "the top quark is very different from the other five quarks because it has a mass @xcite close to the electroweak symmetry breaking scale .",
    "the top quark can therefore provide useful avenues to probe the physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) through its decay , direct production , scattering , and the associated production with other particles .",
    "since the structure or even the symmetry of the correct high energy theory is not known , the effective lagrangian approach can be used to study low energy phenomena .",
    "deviations from the sm can be studied systematically by including higher dimensional operators , which are made up of the sm fields , into the interaction lagrangian .",
    "such higher dimensional operators are suppressed by powers of the scale @xmath0 of the new physics .    in this paper , we study some anomalous couplings of the top quark , which often appear in extensions of the sm . we shall limit ourselves to as low dimension as possible because the effects of the high dimensional operators are very much suppressed at low energies . here , we concern only the dim-4 and dim-5 operators . for dimension 4",
    "we include a right - handed component into the weak decay of the top quark . although the @xmath1 structure in light quarks are more or less established , the @xmath1 structure of the top quark should be confirmed .",
    "the presence of a right - handed component , even small , will signify some new physics beyond the sm .",
    "for dimension 5 we concentrate on the anomalous chromomagnetic and chromoelectric dipole moments of the top quark .",
    "they are particularly interesting because they are directly involved in the subprocesses @xmath2 of top - pair production , and they are often nonzero on loop - level or even tree level in many extensions of the sm , e.g. , the multi - higgs doublet model @xcite .",
    "furthermore , a nonzero value for the chromoelectric dipole moment is a clean signal of cp violation .",
    "the effects of these anomalous couplings have been studied in @xmath3 production @xcite , @xmath4 production @xcite , inclusive jet production @xcite , and prompt photon production @xcite .    in this work ,",
    "we study the effects of the above mentioned anomalous couplings on the spin correlation in top - pair production .",
    "recently , a few studies @xcite showed that top - pair production is highly spin - correlated , which means that the top quark and antiquark have preferential spin polarizations .",
    "a theoretically interesting variable to quantify the spin correlation is @xcite @xmath5 where the subscripts @xmath6 and @xmath7 denote the helicities of the top quark and antiquark . at the tevatron ,",
    "the dominant subprocess of top - pair production is @xmath8 and @xmath9 , while at the lhc energy @xmath10 will dominate and @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "the measurement of @xmath12 can then serve as an indirect probe to the underlying production mechanism .",
    "although this variable is a true measure of the spin correlation , it is not directly measured experimentally .",
    "fortunately , the top quark is so heavy that it decays before it hadronizes , and , therefore , almost all the spin information is retained in the decay products of the top quark .",
    "the heavy top quark will decay preferentially into a longitudinally polarized @xmath13 boson and a left - handed @xmath14 quark . because of the conservation of angular momentum the @xmath13 boson prefers to go in the same direction as the top polarization in the rest frame of the top quark .",
    "the antilepton @xmath15 decaying from the @xmath13 boson also goes in the direction of the @xmath13 boson , i.e. , in the same direction as the spin polarization of the top quark . on the other hand , the lepton decaying from the top antiquark prefers to go in the opposite direction as the spin polarization .",
    "thus , by discriminating the directions of the lepton and antilepton we can select particular polarizations of the top quark and antiquark . since the top - quark pair is spin - correlated , the asymmetries formed by the lepton and antilepton could be nontrivial .",
    "we shall introduce a few asymmetries in the next section .",
    "the organization is as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we introduce the asymmetries and calculate them in the sm . in sec .",
    "iii we study the effects of the anomalous chromomagnetic and chromoelectric dipole moments of the top quark on the variable @xmath12 and the asymmetries , and in sec .",
    "iv we study the effects of the right - handed component in the weak decay of the top quark .",
    "we then discuss and conclude in sec .",
    "v. in this work , we concentrate on the run ii of the tevatron ( @xmath16 tev ) with a yearly luminosity of order @xmath17 @xcite .",
    "the top quark mass is chosen to be 175 gev @xcite .",
    "we use the parton distributions of cteq3l @xcite .",
    "the dominant subprocesses for the hadronic production of top quark are @xmath18 the @xmath19-initiated subprocess dominates at the tevatron energies ( @xmath20 tev for run i and 2 tev for run ii ) , while @xmath21-initiated one dominates at the lhc , because of the increasing gluon luminosity with increases in energy . at the tevatron energies ,",
    "since most of the times the top pair is produced near threshold and in the dominant subprocess @xmath22 the top pair is produced via a @xmath23 @xmath24-channel gluon , most of the @xmath3 pairs are in a @xmath25 state . by counting the spin",
    "eigenstates the ratio of the top - quark pair in the same helicities to the top - quark pair in opposite helicities is 1:2 , so the value of @xmath12 is @xmath26 . far above the threshold ,",
    "helicity conservation requires @xmath27 and @xmath28 in opposite helicities , so @xmath29 .",
    "we found that at the tevatron ( @xmath30 tev ) @xmath9 , which was first given in ref .",
    "@xcite . on the other hand",
    ", @xmath10 dominates at the lhc . near threshold",
    "the @xmath3 pair is produced in a @xmath31 state , so the @xmath27 and @xmath28 have the same helicities , with @xmath32 .",
    "hence , there is a dramatic change of @xmath12 from negative to positive when energy increases from 1.8 tev to 14 tev .    as mentioned above that",
    "although @xmath12 is not directly measured , it can be revealed in the decay products of the top - quark pair .",
    "the best analyzer of the top spin polarization is the semileptonic decay , because in other decay modes it is difficult to distinguish the up - type or down - type quark in the decay of the @xmath33 boson , and leptons are much easier to be detected .",
    "we will study three different asymmetries , two of which have been shown to be very effective @xcite .",
    "all three of them involve semileptonic decays of the top quark and antiquark .",
    "the first one , denoted by @xmath34 , is @xcite @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the cosine of the angle of the lepton in the rest frame of the parent top quark with respect to the momentum of the top in the @xmath3 center - of - mass frame .",
    "the second one , denoted by @xmath37 , is @xmath38 where @xmath39 and @xmath40 are the @xmath41-component of the 3-momenta of the lepton and antilepton in the @xmath3 center - of - mass frame .",
    "the positive @xmath41 direction is defined as the direction of incoming proton beam . in other words ,",
    "this asymmetry @xmath37 counts the number of events that the lepton and antilepton go to the same or opposite side of the plane , which is normal to the beam direction , in the @xmath3 center - of - mass frame .",
    "the third one , which we denote by @xmath42 , is exactly the same as @xmath43 described in ref .",
    "@xcite , in which @xmath43 is the best out of the four asymmetries considered . ]",
    "is given by @xcite @xmath44 where @xmath45 ( @xmath46 ) is the @xmath41-component of the 3-momentum of the antilepton ( lepton ) in the rest frame of the top quark ( top antiquark ) .",
    "the only difference between @xmath37 and @xmath42 is that the 3-momenta of the lepton and antilepton are in different frames .    to calculate these asymmetries we have to put in the decay matrix elements of the top quark and antiquark with full spin correlation .",
    "we use the helicity amplitude method @xcite to calculate the spin - polarized cross sections , and the asymmetries @xmath12 , @xmath34 , @xmath37 , and @xmath42 . with this helicity amplitude method",
    "the subsequent decays of the top quark and the @xmath33 boson can be included straight - forwardly .",
    "the necessary formulas for top - pair production and the decays are given in ref .",
    "we found that the asymmetry @xmath34 is about @xmath47 in accord with the results of ref .",
    "@xcite , the asymmetry @xmath37 is about @xmath48 , and @xmath42 is about @xmath49 , which also agrees with the results of ref .",
    "although the asymmetries @xmath37 and @xmath42 are larger than @xmath34 numerically , @xmath34 is more sensitive to the anomalous chromomagnetic dipole moment that we are going to discuss in the next section . with the asymmetries @xmath12 , @xmath34 , @xmath37 , and @xmath42 we can now study the new physics associated with top - gluon vertex and the weak decay vertex of the top quark",
    "they are , respectively , studied in the next two sections .",
    "the effective lagrangian for the interactions between a top quark and a gluon that include the chromomagnetic ( cmdm ) and chromoelectric ( cedm ) form factors is @xmath50 t \\;,\\ ] ] where @xmath51 ( @xmath52 ) is the cmdm ( cedm ) of the top quark .",
    "the feynman rules for the interactions of the top and gluon can be written down : @xmath53 t_i\\ ; g_\\mu^a \\;,\\ ] ] where @xmath54 is the incoming ( outgoing ) top and @xmath55 is the 4-momentum of the outgoing gluon .",
    "the lagrangian in eq .",
    "( [ eff ] ) also induces a @xmath56 interaction given by @xmath57 which is absent in the sm .",
    "the unpolarized @xmath3 cross sections including the cmdm and cedm couplings were calculated in ref .  @xcite .",
    "since we are interested in polarized cross sections here , we use the helicity amplitude method @xcite to calculate the polarized cross sections including the cmdm and cedm couplings . once we obtained the polarized cross sections for @xmath58 , @xmath59 , @xmath60 , and @xmath61",
    ", we can then calculate the ideal spin - correlation variable @xmath12 of eq .",
    "( [ c ] ) .",
    "we show the results of @xmath12 versus @xmath62 and @xmath63 by the solid curves in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] and fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , respectively .",
    "as expected the behavior of the curve for @xmath63 is symmetric about the @xmath64-axis because the cross sections contain only even powers of @xmath63 , while the curve for @xmath62 is not symmetric about @xmath64-axis because the cross sections do depend on odd powers of @xmath62 .",
    "since @xmath12 is so sensitive to the anomalous dipole moments , if one were able to measure @xmath12 directly and accurately enough , we could measure the cmdm and cedm of the top quark easily .",
    "however , this is not so .",
    "but it is not impossible to have indirect measurements of @xmath12 by means of the asymmetries @xmath34 , @xmath37 , and @xmath42 that we introduced before .",
    "similar to how we obtained the sm results , we decay the top quark and antiquark semileptonically with full spin correlation . the variations of @xmath34 , @xmath37 , and @xmath42 with @xmath62 and @xmath63 are also superimposed with @xmath12 onto fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] and fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] . from these two figures",
    "we can see that the rise and fall of the curves @xmath34 , @xmath37 , and @xmath42 are in accord with those of @xmath12 .",
    "it is then clear that the asymmetries @xmath34 , @xmath37 , and @xmath42 are , to a great extent , true representations of the spin - correlation @xmath12 .",
    "especially , @xmath34 is directly related to @xmath12 by @xmath65 @xcite .",
    "we also see that the asymmetry @xmath34 is more sensitive than the asymmetries @xmath37 and @xmath42 to changes in @xmath62 , while all three are more or less equally sensitive to changes in @xmath63 .",
    "nevertheless , the asymmetry @xmath37 has a larger numerical value than @xmath34 and @xmath42 at the sm point ( @xmath66 ) , which implies that it statistically needs fewer dilepton events to see the spin correlation .",
    "in dimension 4 the general charged - current couplings of the top quark is given by @xcite @xmath67 t w_\\mu^- \\ ; + \\ ; { \\rm h.c.}\\ ] ] where the parameters @xmath68 and @xmath69 are used to denote the strength of the additional left - handed and right - handed couplings , respectively . in the sm , @xmath70 . since the right - handed weak decay interaction only affects the decays of the top quark and antiquark , it has no effects on the variable @xmath12 , as @xmath12 only depends on the top - gluon couplings .",
    "but it will affect the asymmetries @xmath34 , @xmath37 , and @xmath42 .",
    "the non - standard top decay can be implemented using the helicity amplitude method @xcite , replacing the spinors of the top quark and top antiquark by @xmath71 where the 4-momenta of the particles are labeled by the particle symbols .",
    "we have used the narrow width approximation to handle the top and @xmath33 boson propagators , and we used the sm values for the width of the top quark and the @xmath33 boson . since we are dealing with the asymmetries only ( not the total cross sections ) , we do not need to include the non - standard interactions in calculating the top width @xmath72 .",
    "we have verified that changing @xmath68 alone while keeping @xmath73 would not change the asymmetries because the weak decay is still @xmath1 .",
    "therefore , we only show the results versus @xmath69 while keeping @xmath74 . in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , we show the asymmetries @xmath34 , @xmath37 , and @xmath42 versus @xmath69 from @xmath75 to 10 .",
    "we can see that all three asymmetries decrease for non - zero @xmath69 , and are symmetric about @xmath73 .",
    "even at @xmath76 ( vector coupling only ) and at @xmath77 ( axial - vector coupling only ) the asymmetries are non - zero , because non - zero spin correlation is still being fed down from top - pair production ( @xmath9 in the sm ) . as @xmath69 increases further away from zero , the asymmetries @xmath78 , @xmath79 , and @xmath80 .",
    "it would also be interesting to check the case of an entirely right - handed coupling by putting @xmath81 and @xmath76 , at which @xmath34 , @xmath37 , and @xmath42 are verified to be the same as the asymptotic values of the curves in fig .",
    "the reason why @xmath34 and @xmath42 are not quite zero yet is that the @xmath3 pairs being produced are still spin - correlated , i.e. , @xmath82 .",
    "nevertheless , the right - handed weak decay of the top quark and antiquark causes the asymmetries very difficult to be detected .",
    "we have also verified that at the point where @xmath83 , i.e. , the spins of the top pair are uncorrelated , the values of @xmath34 and @xmath42 are in fact zero for @xmath84 .",
    "* ( a ) * so far , the calculation of the asymmetries are without experimental acceptance cuts , efficiencies of reconstructing the 4-momenta of the top quark and antiquark , or the smearing of momenta due to the detector .",
    "typical acceptance cuts on the observed leptons , @xmath14 quarks , and missing transverse energy are @xmath85 which are also needed for eliminating backgrounds and for reconstructing the top quark and antiquark .",
    "we found that the cuts reduce the asymmetries by about 1520% near the sm point ( @xmath86 ) .",
    "the effects of smearing and reconstruction of the top quark and antiquark rest frame have been studied in details in ref .",
    "@xcite , so we do not repeat here . in general ,",
    "the asymmetries near the sm point are reduced by another 1015% . however , since it is only based on a parton - level monte carlo , a full monte carlo is needed to study the true effects .    0.2 in * ( b ) * the sm values for the asymmetries @xmath34 , @xmath37 , and @xmath42 are @xmath47 , @xmath48 , and @xmath49 , respectively",
    ". it would be important to check if these asymmetries can be observed above experimental uncertainties . since we do not have a full monte carlo simulation , we only take into account the statistical error .",
    "the sm cross section for @xmath3 production with the dilepton decay mode at @xmath87 tev under the cuts in eq .",
    "( [ cut ] ) is about 0.14 pb , which gives about 280 dilepton events for a @xmath17 luminosity in the run ii of the tevatron @xcite .",
    "the statistical error is then @xmath88 .",
    "therefore , the values for @xmath89 , @xmath90 , and @xmath91 should be clean to be observed , even after taking into account other systematical uncertainties , especially , @xmath42 shows a possible @xmath92 effect from an uncorrelated @xmath3 sample .",
    "thus , the spin correlation in @xmath3 production can be tested cleanly in the run ii of the tevatron . 0.2 in * ( c ) * in the following , we are going to estimate the sensitivities to or the bounds on @xmath93 , and @xmath69 using the various spin - correlation asymmetries if assuming the sm is correct . to estimate the @xmath94 sensitivity to @xmath93 , and @xmath69",
    ", we assume the sm values for @xmath34 , @xmath37 , and @xmath42 are correct and put a @xmath95 onto them to get the corresponding ranges for @xmath93 , and @xmath69 .",
    "the bounds are then given by @xmath96 where we have combined , for each of the @xmath62 s , the three ranges given by @xmath34 , @xmath37 , and @xmath42 .",
    "although these estimates are rather crude , they do give a feeling of how well the limits can be obtained using the spin - correlation .",
    "in reality , the limits should be weaker than the above because there are also systematical errors which have to be taken into account . nevertheless , the limits obtained above are comparable to those using total cross sections . moreover ,",
    "using spin - correlation is better than using the total cross section in controlling the uncertainties coming from higher order corrections , parton distribution functions , and the strong coupling constant .",
    "higher luminosities , e.g. , an integrated @xmath97 in the stretched run of the run ii or even @xmath98 in tev33 plan @xcite will certainly reduce the statistical error by the square root of the increase in luminosity .",
    "using a @xmath99 luminosity compared to a @xmath17 luminosity reduces the statistical error by a factor of @xmath100 .",
    "thus , the limits can also be improved substantially .",
    "there is also a possibility of using other decay modes of the top quark and antiquark , which can result in a larger number of events , thus reducing the statistical error .",
    "however , it is very difficult experimentally to distinguish the quark and antiquark in the @xmath33 boson decay , which then reduces the asymmetries significantly @xcite .",
    "0.2 in * ( d ) * other facilities to study the top quark are the @xmath101 colliders at 0.5 tev and the lhc . in @xmath101 collisions , since the production of @xmath3 pair is via @xmath24-channel exchanges of @xmath102 and @xmath103 , the production rate of @xmath3 actually decreases with increase in energy when the energy is well above the threshold . therefore , it would not be advantageous to study @xmath3 production in very high energy @xmath101 colliders .",
    "the @xmath3 pair produced in @xmath101 collisions will also be spin - correlated , and the studies in this paper can be applied .",
    "we can further study the variation versus the center - of - mass energy of the collisions .",
    "the lhc will be a copious source of @xmath3 pair , of order @xmath104 .",
    "there should be large number of dilepton events to measure the spin - correlation asymmetries down to one percent accuracy .",
    "furthermore , the dominant production process changes to @xmath10 , thus also changing the spin - correlation substantially , as discussed in the introduction .    in conclusions",
    ", we have studied the spin correlation of @xmath3 production and the asymmetries formed by the decay products of the top quark and antiquark at the fermilab tevatron .",
    "we also studied the effects of anomalous chromomagnetic and chromoelectric dipole moments of the top quark , and a right - handed component in the weak decay of the top quark on the spin correlation .",
    "we also estimated the limits on @xmath62 , @xmath105 , and @xmath69 that can be statistically obtained in the run ii of the tevatron if assuming the sm is correct .",
