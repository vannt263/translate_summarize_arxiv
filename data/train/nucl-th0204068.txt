    "inelastic scattering of electrons from the deuteron is an important source of information about the nuclear current , deuteron structure , and the @xmath3 force .",
    "the exclusive scattering cross section , @xmath0 , was first measured almost forty years ago @xcite , and since then it has been measured under a wide variety of kinematic conditions @xcite .",
    "there is a substantial body of data for this reaction , including cross section measurements @xcite as well as separations of various response functions @xcite which differentiate between absorption of longitudinal and transverse photons .    in this paper",
    "we survey results that might be expected from a new generation of @xmath0 coincidence measurements proposed for jefferson laboratory ( jlab ) . at jlab",
    "it is possible to carry out a comprehensive program of measurements at both high @xmath1 and large @xmath4 ( where @xmath4 is the invariant mass of the final @xmath5 state ) .",
    "a broad program of such measurements offers the best hope of independently determining effects of final state interactions and the nuclear current , permitting the extraction of important new information about the short range @xmath3 interaction .",
    "electrodisintegration of the deuteron has been studied theoretically by many groups .",
    "recently , arenhvel , beck , and wilbois @xcite have emphasized that the relativistic effects in inelastic scattering can be very large , even at modest momenta , and it is therefore particularly important to have a fully relativistic theory available for the analysis of the higher momenta data that will be measured at jlab .",
    "relativistic calculations of this reaction date back to the early work of durand @xcite and mcgee @xcite and lead up to more recent work by tjon @xcite",
    ". one of the goals of this paper is to present a fully modern , covariant treatment of this process suitable for the analysis of jlab data .",
    "this paper imbeds the dynamical calculation in the general formalism developed in ref .",
    "@xcite , where a covariant , systematic treatment of most of the polarization observables that can be measured in the @xmath0 reaction were classified and defined .",
    "there it was found that the use of transversity amplitudes ( closely related to helicity amplitudes ) gave a very efficient description of the reaction .",
    "transversity amplitudes were discussed by moravcsik @xcite , who found that they build in the constraints imposed by parity and rotational invariance in the most efficient way . in a transversity basis",
    ", the constraints imposed by these symmetries insure that half of the possible amplitudes vanish identically , so that the cumbersome linear relations needed in other formalisms @xcite are unnecessary",
    ". this economy will be essential some time in the future when large data sets exist , and it may be important to know whether or not a proposed new measurement will really be independent of amplitudes already measured .",
    "the details of the calculation are carried out using the covariant spectator theory , which has been successfully applied to the description of @xmath3 scattering @xcite and the electromagnetic form factors of the deuteron @xcite .",
    "one feature of this theory is that the deuteron bound state is described by the covariant @xmath6 vertex with one nucleon on mass - shell , and this is precisely the amplitude that is needed for the relativistic impulse approximation ( ria ) , making the theory well suited to the analysis of the @xmath0 coincidence reaction @xcite . in this first application of the covariant spectator theory using the transversity basis , we present the ria calculation only .",
    "this provides the opportunity to work out several new technical details for the simplest case , and to compare to other approximations",
    ". the inclusion of final state interactions and interaction currents will be the subject of future work .",
    "a second purpose of this paper is to estimate the size of the unpolarized @xmath0 cross sections expected over the broad range of @xmath1 and @xmath4 accessible to jlab . in preparing this survey we found that relativistic and nonrelativistic predictions for @xmath0 at high @xmath1 , where the cross section is most sensitive to the theory , often differ by as much as an order of magnitude , extending the observations of arenhvel , beck , and wilbois @xcite .",
    "since nonrelativistic calculations can not be taken seriously at such high energies , we report our results for a variety of relativistic or semi - relativistic models only . in this first exploratory study",
    "the goal is to provide only a rough survey of the landscape .",
    "the simplicity of the ria allows a uniform treatment over the entire kinematic range , but is , of course , very incomplete .",
    "it is our intention to follow up this study with complete calculations for cases where the theoretical effects look especially interesting .    our notation for the cross section and the spectator theory for the ria are reviewed briefly in sec .",
