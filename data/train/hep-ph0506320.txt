    "according to the concordance model , ordinary matter in the form of baryons represents only @xmath1 of the energy density of the universe .",
    "the rest is apparently shared between dark matter and dark energy , with @xmath2 and @xmath3 respectively @xcite .",
    "dark energy is supposed to be responsible for the accelerated expansion of the universe but otherwise its true nature eludes us .",
    "the dark matter problem is almost mundane in comparison .",
    "we have a plethora of well - motivated and well - understood particle physics candidates , the most acclaimed currently being a neutralino , and we know of the existence of at least one component of dark matter , in the form of light neutrinos .    in the present paper",
    "we would like to address a nagging puzzle related to dark matter .",
    "this is the apparently coincidental fact that the energy density in baryons and that of dark matter are nearly the same @xmath4 this similitude is generally not addressed by scenarios predicting the existence of dark matter , nor a fortiori by those concerned with baryogenesis . yet , although the ratio ( [ ratio ] ) is constant today this was not the case for all the history of the universe and , at least for conventional dark matter and baryon matter generation mechanisms , ( [ ratio ] ) is a puzzle .    by way of introduction , it is instructive to have a look at leptogenesis , the simplest mechanism which establishes a relation between dark matter ( in the form of neutrinos ) and the abundance of baryons .",
    "leptogenesis fixes the ratio of baryon to cosmic background neutrino number densities ( assuming the neutrino asymmetry itself is negligible ) and requires the neutrinos to be light majorana particles .",
    "it is well appreciated that neutrinos are too light to be the dominant form of dark matter but this is not our main concern here .",
    "more to the point is the fact that the constraints from leptogenesis on neutrinos masses are rather loose ( the range @xmath5 ev is claimed in @xcite but the range could be much broader , see @xcite ) . yet @xmath6 , where the lower bound comes from large scales structure formation ( @xmath7 ) @xcite while the upper bounds comes from neutrino oscillations ( @xmath8 ) @xcite .",
    "this is surprising , since leptogenesis has nothing to say about the baryon to neutrino mass ratio . yet",
    "the ratio of baryon to neutrino energy densities are almost similar .",
    "the above discussion illustrate a shortcoming of most attempts ( including ours ) to explain ( [ ratio ] ) _ i.e. _ that one has to understand both the particle number density ratio and the particle mass ratio .",
    "a most straightforward explanation could be that dark matter is made of antibaryons , albeit of course of an exotic , neutral and stable form , that could compensate the baryon number of ordinary matter .",
    "this is not in contradiction with nucleosynthesis or cmb fluctuations , since these observations constrain only the number of protons and neutrons ( and their bound states ) .",
    "in such a scheme one would automatically get ( [ ratio ] ) of @xmath9 with the mass of dark and visible matter related to the scale of qcd . of course we know too much about strong interactions and it seems difficult to make this idea consistent with observations",
    "( there has been however and interesting recent attempt in this direction @xcite . )",
    "this lengthly introduction brings us to the much less ambitious path that will be ours .",
    "the main idea goes back to old works of barr _ et al _ @xcite and kaplan @xcite and more recent inputs of kuzmin @xcite and kitano and low @xcite .",
    "this approach allows to fix the ratio of particle densities .",
    "the mass of dark matter particles then comes as a prediction to be tested .",
    "the basic setup assumes that there is an asymmetry in the dark sector related to the baryon asymmetry of the universe .",
    "both baryon matter and dark matter then owe their existence to a single mechanism , a sort of matter genesis .",
    "the different existing scenarios ( see @xcite ) differ in the implementation of this very idea , however there are some similarities in the conditions to be satisfied . here",
    "we outline the version of @xcite that inspired us . by necessity",
    ", there is a dark sector , composed of a set of new particles . the visible sector , which consists of , among other things , baryons , and the dark sector communicate with each other but the interactions are suppressed at low energies .",
    "the lightest of these particles is protected from decay by some discrete symmetry , analogous to r - parity .",
    "this lightest particle can not be produced thermally in the universe .",
    "if it were , the tiny asymmetry in the dark sector would be drowned by numbers .",
    "this last condition motivates the introduction of a particle in the dark sector that we call the messenger particle .",
    "this particle is strongly interacting and in thermal equilibrium in the early universe .",
    "because it is strongly interacting , it stays in thermal equilibrium even when it becomes non - relativistic and that messengers and their antiparticles begin to annihilate .",
    "the situation in the dark sector at this point is like that for ordinary baryons in the visible sector .",
    "baryons and messengers both survive to annihilation thanks to a tiny asymmetry in their respective sector . in the visible sector ,",
    "neutrons decay into protons and the chain ends . in the dark sector , the messengers decay into the lightest stable particle , that should better be electrically neutral .",
    "there are presumably many possible concrete realization of this scenario .",
    "ours differs from those pre - existing in the literature on the following points .",
    "first our prejudice will be that the mechanism responsible for matter genesis is leptogenesis .",
    "then dark matter will then be made of light , @xmath10 few @xmath11 , right - handed majorana neutrinos . last our model is based on an extension of the standard model ( sm ) which has been proposed for other purposes . the model is very constrained and , we agree , not the nicest model one would dream of .",
    "however we believe that there are some lessons to be drawn from it .",
    "as we shall discuss , the main drawback of this model and its siblings , will be that , at the end of the day , it does not look very natural .",
    "then , the mass of dark matter particles will come in as a constraint , not a prediction , but this was to be anticipated from the discussion in the introduction .",
    "finally , the kind of dark matter of the type we consider would escape all attempts of detection .",
    "the messenger particle could be observed in high energy colliders , since it is a strongly interacting particle , similar to a ( very very ) heavy quark .",
    "we have chosen to concentrate on a specific extension of the standard model that was proposed many years ago in @xcite as an alternative to the sm way of giving mass to the quarks and leptons and is known in the literature as the `` universal see - saw model '' . the gauge group is @xmath12 .",
    "the left and right - handed quarks @xmath13 and leptons @xmath14 are respectively @xmath15 and @xmath16 doublets and , in the simplest framework , there are two brout - englert - higgs ( beh ) doublets , @xmath17 and @xmath18 to give mass to the quarks and leptons , one introduces a set of @xmath19 singlet weyl fermions and a majorana fermion @xmath20 : @xmath21 note the unusual @xmath22 charge assignment of these fields .",
    "the beh bosons , for instance , have a non - zero @xmath22 charge , and there is a completely neutral field @xmath20 .",
    "the latter will play the role of the heavy majorana particle , analogous to the heavy right - handed majorana neutrinos in standard leptogenesis scenarios .",
    "this model looks nice but , unfortunately , we will need to complicate it a bit further .",
    "in particular we need to implement a discrete symmetry to protect the dark sector .",
    "we follow in that an old proposal of babu _ et al _ @xcite .",
    "first we add two beh scalars in the adjoint , whose purpose will become clear later on : @xmath23 then we impose the following @xmath24 symmetry @xmath25 all other fields transforming trivially under @xmath24",
    ". the first effect of this symmetry is to forbid a dirac mass term for the @xmath26 field and yukawa couplings to the @xmath20 ( would be neutrino dirac mass terms ) .",
    "the allowed yukawa couplings and mass terms then take the form @xmath27    this seems utterly complicated but the interesting things come with symmetry breaking .",
    "let us write @xmath28 the _ vev _ of @xmath29 and @xmath30 the _ vev _ of the triplets .",
    "then the neutrino fields are all pure majorana @xmath31 the up - like quarks and charged leptons get their mass from mixing with the heavy dirac singlets @xmath32 where @xmath33 and @xmath34 thus following the usual `` universal see - saw '' pattern .",
    "the twist is in the down - like quark sector . because there is no dirac mass term for the @xmath26 field , mixing is maximal @xmath35 and the role of the `` light '' and `` heavy '' right - handed down - like fields are so to speak exchanged . the @xmath36 particle , which couples to @xmath16 gauge bosons , will be our strongly interacting messenger particle .",
    "it is supposed to be lighter than the singlet fermions .",
    "the @xmath37 will get their mass from the _ vev _ of the @xmath16 adjoint scalar field . in the sequel",
    ", we assume that @xmath38 .",
    "( the mass of the @xmath39 and @xmath40 are not very much constrained .",
    "we will only request that the @xmath41 disappear before the electroweak phase transition . )    finally , after left - right symmetry breaking , there is a residual @xmath42 symmetry .",
    "the heavy majorana field @xmath20 , the heavy down - like quark @xmath36 , the majorana neutrino @xmath37 as well as the charged boson fields @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath45 are all odd under @xmath42 . all together , they constitute the dark sector of our model .",
    "we will assume that the initial @xmath22 asymmetry is provided by the out - of - equilibrium , cp violating decay of the heavy singlet majorana fields @xmath20 .",
    "for definiteness , we assume that decay takes place after left - right symmetry breaking .",
    "the abundance of @xmath20 s could be thermal or they could be created during reheating after inflation . note that these fields are odd under the @xmath42 symmetry and are thus the grandfather of our dark matter particles .",
    "the decay process is supposed to be dictated by higher scale interactions but we can parameterize it by dimension six effective operators like @xmath46 where the @xmath26 particle is the mass eigenstate , odd under the @xmath42 symmetry ( since there should be no confusion at this point , we drop the prime on the @xmath26 ) . assuming cp violation , these decay processes may sequestrate a @xmath22 asymmetry between the dark and visible sectors @xmath47 where @xmath48 with @xmath49      after sequestration of a @xmath22 asymmetry in the dark sector , the universe contains @xmath39 , @xmath40 and @xmath26 particles on top of the usual standard model fermions .    in the visible sector ,",
    "the @xmath40 and @xmath39 are in thermal and chemical equilibrium with the standard model fermions , and all together they carry a @xmath42-even @xmath22 asymmetry .",
    "eventually , we will require the @xmath40 and @xmath39 disappears through annihilation and decay before the electroweak phase transition , leaving only sm degrees of freedom behind . as in standard leptogenesis scenarios , baryon number violating processes that are in equilibrium give birth to a non - zero baryon asymmetry @xmath50 the constant of proportionality @xmath51 is calculated in the standard way @xcite , taking into account that the @xmath22 charge is shared between the visible and the dark sector .    in the dark sector , the messenger particles @xmath26 carry a @xmath42-odd @xmath22 asymmetry .",
    "they are heavy , @xmath52 , strongly interacting particles and when the temperature of the universe drops below their mass , they annihilate into light quarks but a small asymmetry survives @xmath53    it is crucial that we require that there are essentially no @xmath37 in the universe at this level since we want to obtain a relation between the baryon asymmetry and the density of dark matter . as we will see in section [ sec : constr ] , this condition constrains the scale of left - right symmetry breaking .",
    "it is also crucial that the messenger particles are strongly interacting so as to leave only the asymmetry as a remnant .",
    "the dominant @xmath26 decay channel is @xmath54 through the exchange of a @xmath55 .",
    "if the messenger particles were to decay before the electroweak phase transition , baryon number violating processes in equilibrium would completely erase the asymmetry ( [ basym ] ) .",
    "indeed the @xmath37 carry no @xmath22 charge in our framework and all the @xmath22 that was sequestrated in the dark sector is released in the @xmath56 and @xmath57 degrees of freedom .",
    "if @xmath26 decay takes place after electroweak symmetry breaking , the final @xmath58 asymmetry is given by ( [ basym ] ) plus the contribution from the @xmath26 decay into baryons @xmath59 the density of dark matter is simply equal to @xmath60 taking the ratio we obtain @xmath61 which implies that @xmath62 .",
    "as expected , the mass of the dark matter particle is of order of the proton mass .",
    "this scenario , the main features of which are summarized in figure [ fig : model ] , is quite involved .",
    "the main element is that a @xmath22 asymmetry is sequestrated in a sector insensitive to @xmath63 violating processes , at least as long as they are active , and is eventually released . in the present model ,",
    "this is possible thanks to an exact discrete symmetry which differentiate the dark and the visible sector .",
    "there are several constraints to put on scales and couplings for the above scenario to work .",
    "they are summarized in the present section .",
    "first , the messenger particles @xmath26 have to decay after ew symmetry breaking to protect the baryon number from erasure .",
    "moreover , since the @xmath26 decay products contributes to the baryon number , @xmath26 decay should take place before nucleosynthesis . from this",
    "we get @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the @xmath26 yukawa coupling .",
    "this is quite a nasty constraint , since it require a rather small yukawa coupling to be satisfied .",
    "second , in order to get a ratio of baryon and dark matter number density of @xmath9 , we require @xmath26 to decay after the completion of @xmath66 annihilation .",
    "this implies , using for the temperature of annihilation interactions freeze - out @xmath67 ( @xmath68 see @xcite ) : @xmath69    third , the @xmath26 asymmetry produced in @xmath20 decay must be larger than the @xmath66 relic from freeze - out .",
    "since @xmath26 annihilates through strong interactions , using the same arguments than @xcite , we obtain : @xmath70 finally , the abundance @xmath37 produced after reheating at @xmath71 must be negligible compared to the abundance from @xmath26 decay . assuming the @xmath37 are produced essentially through @xmath16 gauge bosons and taking @xmath72",
    ", we get @xmath73 all together , these constraints yield a parameters space reduced to @xmath74 this region is showed in figure [ fig : constr ] .",
    "there is a small but non - vanishing region where all the constraints can be met . in particular ,",
    "the messenger @xmath26 particles are rather light , with a mass @xmath75 , compared to the scale of left - right symmetry breaking .",
    "this result is consistent with the results of kitano and low @xcite .",
    "our dark matter candidate is , by construction , rather light @xmath76 and abundant .",
    "its cross - section is , by necessity , very small .",
    "this is essentially because our right - handed neutrinos must be non - thermal relics , with nearly the same number density as baryons .",
    "we had to pay a heavy price to achieve this result .",
    "first , the discrete symmetry of our model is not particularly natural .",
    "second , the yukawa coupling of the messenger particle is quite small .",
    "last , the mass of the dark matter candidate is fixed by hand .    on the observational side , we expect our right - handed neutrinos to be present in the core of the galaxy where they could annihilate with each other producing a heavy @xmath77 boson , or be co - annihilated with right - handed quarks or leptons .",
    "unfortunately the cross - section is way too small , @xmath78 , to give any observable signal . for a dark matter candidate with mass of @xmath79 ( see @xcite for more details about the integral signal and it s correlation with light dark matter annihilation ) . ]",
    "we expect this conclusion to be generic for dark matter candidates related to the baryon asymmetry of the universe , although we have no general proof .",
    "our dark matter candidate and the messenger have otherwise similar characteristics as in the model discussed in @xcite .",
    "in particular , baring other explanations , light right - handed neutrinos might be of interest to explain the apparent suppression in the power spectrum on small scales , having a free - steaming length @xmath80 mpc .",
    "the only hope to detect something in our model is by the production at a collider of the strongly interacting messenger particle , analog to a very heavy quark .",
    "our messenger has a mass range between @xmath81 and @xmath82 , corresponding to a life time between @xmath83 and @xmath84 .",
    "as already underlined in @xcite , at least at the very lower part of this mass range , such a particle could be produced at the lhc .",
    "we have discussed a mechanism of matter genesis , based on a left - right symmetric extension of the standard model , the basic idea being that both a baryonic and dark matter asymmetry have to be generated at some stage in the history of the universe .",
    "our dark matter candidate is a stable right - handed neutrino with mass @xmath85 .",
    "the idea , which has been proposed by several authors , is quite attractive .",
    "however we found it quite difficult to realize .",
    "although one should perhaps not try to draw a general conclusion from our model , the introduction of realistic gauge and yukawa couplings shows that such a scenario is doomed to be very constrained .",
    "this being said , the main drawback of the whole approach is still that such a candidate dark matter is essentially undetectable . on the theoretical side ,",
    "we should also pause and ask what has been gained .",
    "we have a very contrived model , with a discrete symmetry , many new degrees of freedom and new interactions and yet all we can do is to relate the baryon and dark matter particle densities .",
    "the mass of the dark matter particle has still be fixed by hand .    by way of conclusion",
    "we would like to mention a recent attempt which could confront this difficulty .",
    "this mechanism could arise in the context of scalar - tensor theories of gravity coupled to matter . since the mass of matter fields depends generically on the _ vev _ of a scalar field , the presence of matter induces an effective potential . for concreteness ,",
    "suppose that the coupling of @xmath86 to matter is such that @xmath87 with @xmath88 .",
    "then @xmath89 at the minimum of the potential ( which depends on the density of ordinary and dark matter ) .",
    "if the couplings are of the same order , one gets a dynamical relaxation of the ratio ( [ ratio ] ) .",
    "this idea is all nice and well , but again poses problems of its own .",
    "baryons masses are varying , there is an extremely light scalar field with gravitational coupling , etc .",
    "the authors in @xcite have proposed to add an extra potential term to cure these issues ( @xmath86 then behaves as a chameleon , changing mass in function of its environment ) but the potential needs some fine tuning so as not to ruin ( [ dynratio ] ) .",
    "this model is thus not very satisfying but the idea is seductive . at any rate , explaining the apparent coincidence of ( [ ratio ] ) is a challenge worth pursuing .",
