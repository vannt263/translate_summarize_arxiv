    "recently , massive ( or very large ) multiuser multiple - input multiple - output ( mu - mimo ) systems have attracted a lot of attention from both academia and industry @xcite .",
    "massive mu - mimo is a system where a base station ( bs ) equipped with many antennas simultaneously serves several users in the same frequency band .",
    "owing to the large number of degrees - of - freedom available for each user , massive mu - mimo can provide a very high data rate and communication reliability with simple linear processing such as maximum - ratio combining ( mrc ) or zero - forcing ( zf ) on the uplink and maximum - ratio transmission ( mrt ) or zf on the downlink .",
    "at the same time , the radiated energy efficiency can be significantly improved @xcite .",
    "therefore , massive mu - mimo is considered as a promising technology for next generations of cellular systems . in order to use the advantages that massive mu - mimo can offer , accurate channel state information ( csi )",
    "is required at the bs and/or the users .    in small mu - mimo systems where the number of bs antennas is relatively small ,",
    "typically , the bs can acquire an estimate of csi via feedback in frequency - division duplex ( fdd ) operation @xcite .",
    "more precisely , each user estimates the channels based on the downlink training , and then it feeds back its channel estimates to the bs through the reverse link .",
    "however , in massive mu - mimo systems , the number of bs antennas is very large and channel estimation becomes challenging in fdd since the number of downlink resources needed for pilots will be proportional to the number of bs antennas .",
    "also , the required bandwidth for csi feedback becomes very large .",
    "by contrast , in time - division duplex ( tdd ) systems , owing to the channel reciprocity , the bs can obtain csi in open - loop directly from the uplink training .",
    "the pilot transmission overhead is thus proportional to the number of users which is typically much smaller than the number of bs antennas .",
    "therefore , csi acquisition at the bs via open - loop training under tdd operation is preferable in massive mu - mimo systems @xcite . with this csi acquisition , in the uplink",
    ", the signals transmitted from the users can be decoded by using these channel estimates . in the downlink",
    ", the bs can use the channel estimates to precode the transmit signals .",
    "however , the channel estimates are only available at the bs .",
    "the user also should have an estimate of the channel in order to reliably decode the transmitted signals in the downlink .",
    "to acquire csi at the users , a simple scheme is that the bs sends the pilots to the users .",
    "then , each user will estimate the channel based on the received pilots .",
    "this is very inefficient since the channel estimation overhead will be proportional to the number of bs antennas .",
    "therefore , the majority of the research on these systems has assumed that the users do not have knowledge of the csi .",
    "more precisely , the signal is detected at each user by only using the statistical properties of the channels @xcite .",
    "some work assumed that the users have perfect csi @xcite .",
    "to the authors best knowledge , it has not been previously considered how to efficiently acquire csi at each user in the massive mu - mimo downlink .    in this paper , we propose a beamforming training scheme to acquire estimates of the csi at each user . with this scheme , instead of forwarding a long pilot sequence ( whose length is proportional to the number of bs antennas ) , the bs just beamforms a short pilot sequence so that each user can estimate the effective channel gain ( the combination of the precoding vector and the channel gain ) .",
    "the channel estimation overhead of this scheme is only proportional to the number of users . to evaluate the performance of the proposed beamforming training scheme",
    ", we derive a lower bound on the capacity of two specific linear precoding techniques , namely mrt and zf .",
    "numerical results show that the beamforming training scheme works very well in moderate and low - mobility environments .    _",
    "notation : _ we use upper ( lower ) bold letters to denote matrices ( vectors ) .",
    "the superscripts @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 stand for the transpose , conjugate , and conjugate - transpose , respectively .",
    "@xmath3 denotes the trace of a matrix @xmath4 , and @xmath5 is the @xmath6 identity matrix .",
    "the expectation operator and the euclidean norm are denoted by @xmath7 and @xmath8 , respectively .",
    "finally , we use @xmath9 to denote a circularly symmetric complex gaussian vector @xmath10 with zero mean and covariance matrix @xmath11 .",
    "we consider the downlink transmission in a mu - mimo system where a bs equipped with @xmath12 antennas serves @xmath13 single - antenna users in the same time - frequency resource , see fig .",
    "[ fig:1a ] . here",
    ", we assume that @xmath14 .",
    "we further assume that the bs uses linear precoding techniques to process the signal before transmitting to all users .",
    "this requires knowledge of csi at the bs .",
    "we assume tdd operation so that the channels on the uplink and downlink are equal .",
    "the estimates of csi are obtained from uplink training .",
    "let @xmath15 be the number of symbols per coherence interval used entirely for uplink pilots .",
    "all users simultaneously transmit pilot sequences of length @xmath15 symbols .",
    "the pilot sequences of @xmath13 users are pairwisely orthogonal .",
    "therefore , it is required that @xmath16 .",
    "denote by @xmath17 the channel matrix between the bs and the @xmath13 users .",
    "we assume that elements of @xmath18 are i.i.d .",
    "gaussian distributed with zero mean and unit variance . here , for the simplicity",
    ", we neglect the effects of large - scale fading .",
    "then , the minimum mean - square error ( mmse ) estimate of @xmath18 is given by @xcite @xmath19 where @xmath20 is a gaussian matrix with i.i.d .",
    "@xmath21 entries , and @xmath22 denotes the average transmit power of each uplink pilot symbol .",
    "the channel matrix @xmath18 can be decomposed as @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the channel estimation error .",
    "since we use mmse channel estimation , @xmath25 and @xmath24 are independent @xcite .",

    "@xmath27 elements .",
    "let @xmath28 be the symbol to be transmitted to the @xmath29th user , with @xmath30 .",
    "the bs uses the channel estimate @xmath25 to linearly precode the symbols , and then it transmits the precoded signal vector to all users",
    ". let @xmath31 be the linear precoding matrix which is a function of the channel estimate @xmath25 .",
    "then , the @xmath32 transmit signal vector is given by @xmath33 where @xmath34^t$ ] , and @xmath35 is the average transmit power at the bs . to satisfy the power constraint at the bs ,",
    "@xmath36 is chosen such as @xmath37 , or equivalently @xmath38 .",
    "the vector of samples collectively received at the @xmath13 users is given by @xmath39 where @xmath40 is a vector whose @xmath29th element , @xmath41 , is the additive noise at the @xmath29th user .",
    "we assume that @xmath42 .",
    "define @xmath43 , where @xmath44 and @xmath45 are the @xmath46th columns of @xmath18 and @xmath36 , respectively .",
    "then , the received signal at the @xmath29th user can be written as @xmath47        each user should have csi to coherently detect the transmitted signals . a simple way to acquire csi",
    "is to use downlink pilots .",
    "the channel estimate overhead will be proportional to @xmath12 . in massive mimo",
    ", @xmath12 is large , so it is inefficient to estimate the full channel matrix @xmath18 at each user using downlink pilots .",
    "this is the reason for why most of previous studies assumed that the users have only knowledge of the statistical properties of the channels @xcite .",
    "more precisely , in @xcite , the authors use @xmath48 to detect the transmitted signals . with very large @xmath12 , @xmath49 becomes nearly deterministic . in this case , using @xmath48 for the signal detection is good enough .",
    "however , for moderately large @xmath12 , the users should have csi in order to reliably decode the transmitted signals .",
    "we observe from that to detect @xmath28 , user @xmath29 does not need the knowledge of @xmath18 ( which has a dimension of @xmath50 ) .",
    "instead , user @xmath29 needs only to know @xmath49 which is a scalar value .",
    "therefore , to acquire @xmath49 at each user , we can spend a small amount of the coherence interval on downlink training . in the next section",
    ", we will provide more detail about this proposed downlink _ beamforming training _",
    "scheme to estimate @xmath49 . with this scheme ,",
    "the channel estimation overhead is proportional to the number of users @xmath13 .",
    "the bs beamforms the pilots .",
    "then , the @xmath29th user will estimate @xmath51 by using the received pilots .",
    "let @xmath52 be the pilot matrix , where @xmath53 is the duration ( in symbols ) of the downlink training .",
    "the pilot matrix is given by @xmath54 we assume that the rows of @xmath55 are pairwisely orthonormal , i.e. , @xmath56 .",
    "this requires that @xmath57 .",
    "the bs beamforms the pilot sequence using the precoding matrix @xmath36 .",
    "more precisely , the transmitted pilot matrix is @xmath58 .",
    "then , the @xmath59 received pilot matrix at the @xmath13 users is given by @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the awgn matrix whose elements are i.i.d .",
    "the received pilot matrix @xmath62 can be represented by @xmath63 and @xmath64 , where @xmath65 is the orthogonal complement of @xmath66 , i.e. , @xmath67 .",
    "we can see that @xmath64 only includes noise which is independent of @xmath68 .",
    "thus , it is sufficient to use @xmath68 for the channel estimation",
    ". let @xmath69 where @xmath70 has i.i.d .",

    "depending on the precoding matrix @xmath36 , the elements of @xmath79 can be correlated and hence , they should be jointly estimated . however , here , for the simplicity of the analysis , we estimate @xmath80 independently , i.e. , we use the @xmath46th element of @xmath81 to estimate @xmath51 . in section  [ sec : conclusion ] , we show that estimating the elements of @xmath79 jointly will not improve the system performance much compared to the case where the elements of @xmath79 are estimated independently .",

    "then , the effective channel @xmath82 can be decomposed as @xmath87 note that , since we use mmse estimation , the estimate @xmath88 and the estimation error @xmath86 are uncorrelated .",
    "in this section , we derive a lower bound on the achievable downlink rate for mrt and zf precoding techniques , using the proposed beamforming training scheme . to obtain these achievable rates",
    ", we use the techniques of @xcite .",
    "user @xmath29 uses the channel estimate @xmath89 in to detect the transmitted signal @xmath28 .",
    "therefore , the achievable downlink rate of the transmission from the bs to the @xmath29th user is the mutual information between the unknown transmitted signal @xmath28 and the observed received signal @xmath90 given by and the known channel estimate @xmath91^t$ ] , i.e. , @xmath92 .    following a similar methodology as in (",
    "* appendix  a ) , we obtain a lower bound on the achievable rate of the transmission from the bs to the @xmath29th user as : @xmath93 we next simplify the capacity lower bound given by for two specific linear precoding techniques at the bs , namely , mrt and zf .      with mrt ,",
    "the precoding matrix @xmath36 is given by @xmath94 where @xmath95 is a normalization constant chosen to satisfy the transmit power constraint at the bs , i.e. , @xmath38 .",
    "hence , @xmath96    [ pro1 ] with mrt , the lower bound on the achievable rate given by becomes @xmath97 where @xmath98 where @xmath99 when @xmath100 and @xmath101 otherwise .",

    "in this section , we illustrate the spectral efficiency performance of the beamforming training scheme . the spectral efficiency is defined as the sum - rate ( in bits ) per channel use .",
    "let @xmath0 be the length of the coherence interval ( in symbols ) . during each coherence interval",
    ", we spend @xmath15 symbols for uplink training and @xmath53 symbols for beamforming training .",
    "therefore , the spectral efficiency is given by @xmath112 where @xmath113 is given by for mrt , and for zf .    for comparison",
    ", we also consider the spectral efficiency for the case that there is no beamforming training and that @xmath114 is used instead of @xmath49 for the detection @xcite . the spectral efficiency for this case is given by @xcite @xmath115 in all examples , we choose @xmath116 and @xmath117db .",
    "we define @xmath118 .",
    "we first consider a single - user setup ( @xmath108 ) .",
    "when @xmath108 , the performances mrt and zf are the same .",
    "[ fig:1 ] shows the spectral efficiency versus @xmath119 for different number of bs antennas @xmath120 and @xmath121 , at @xmath122 ( e.g. @xmath123ms@xmath124khz ) .",
    "we can see that the beamforming training scheme outperforms the case without beamforming training .",
    "the performance gap increases significantly when the @xmath119 increases .",
    "the reason is that , when @xmath119 ( or the downlink power ) increases , the channel estimate at each user is more accurate and hence , the advantage of the beamforming training scheme grows .",
    "next , we consider a multiuser setup . here , we choose the number of users to be @xmath111 .",
    "[ fig:2 ] shows the spectral efficiency versus @xmath119 for the mrt and zf precoders , at @xmath120 , @xmath121 , and @xmath122 .",
    "again , the beamforming training offers an improved performance .",
    "in addition , we can see that the beamforming training with mrt precoding is more efficient than the beamforming training with zf precoding .",
    "this is due to the fact that , with zf , the randomness of the effective channel gain @xmath49 at the @xmath29th user is smaller than the one with mrt ( with zf , @xmath49 becomes deterministic when the bs has perfect csi ) and hence , mrc has a higher advantage of using the channel estimate for the signal detection .",
    "furthermore , we consider the effect of the length of the coherence interval on the system performance of the beamforming training scheme .",
    "[ fig:3 ] shows the spectral efficiency versus the length of the coherence interval @xmath0 at @xmath121 , @xmath111 , and @xmath125 db .",
    "as expected , for short coherence intervals ( in a high - mobility environment ) , the training duration is relatively large compared to the length of the coherence interval and hence , we should not use the beamforming training to estimate csi at each user . at moderate and large @xmath0 , the training duration is relatively small compared with the coherence interval . as a result , the beamforming training scheme is preferable .    finally , we consider the spectral efficiency of our scheme but with a genie receiver , i.e. , we assume that the @xmath29th user can estimate perfectly @xmath79 in the beamforming training phase . for this case ,",

    "we choose @xmath111 and @xmath122 .",
    "we can see that performance gap between two cases is very small .",
