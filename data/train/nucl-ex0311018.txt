    "the cooler synchrotron cosy - jlich  @xcite , which provides proton beams in the energy range @xmath11  gev , is well suited for the study of @xmath9-meson production in @xmath0 and @xmath12 reactions . in measurements with thin and windowless internal targets ,",
    "secondary processes of the produced mesons can be neglected and , simultaneously , sufficiently high luminosities are obtained . for the measurements described here ,",
    "a cluster - jet target @xcite with hydrogen or deuterium as target material has been used , providing areal densities of up to @xmath13  @xmath14 . with proton beam intensities of a few @xmath15 luminosities of @xmath16",
    "have been achieved .    the anke spectrometer  @xcite consists of three dipole magnets , which separate forward - emitted charged reaction products from the circulating proton beam and allow to determine their emission angles and momenta .",
    "@xmath9-mesons in the momentum range @xmath17 mev / c can be detected , the angular acceptance is @xmath18 horizontally and up to @xmath19 vertically .",
    "subthreshold @xmath9-production in @xmath12 reactions has been the prime motivation for building anke and the detection system for @xmath9-mesons .",
    "this is a very demanding task because of the small @xmath9-production cross sections , e.g.  39  nb for @xmath1c collisions at 1.0  gev  @xcite .",
    "the results of these measurements have been published in refs.@xcite . in subsequent experiments anke has been used to study kaon production in more elementary ( i.e.  @xmath0 and @xmath1d ) reactions as well .    from the @xmath0 data information about the production of the scalar resonance @xmath5(980 ) close to the @xmath4 threshold",
    "has been extracted , see sect .",
    "[ sec : a0f0_anke ] .",
    "this experiment can also be regarded as a successful feasibility test for a longer experimental program which has the final goal to determine the charge - symmetry breaking @xmath7-@xmath8 mixing amplitude .",
    "these measurements are motivated in sects .",
    "[ sec : a0f0_motivation ] and [ sec : a0f0_future ] and will require the use of a photon detector which is not available at cosy yet . in sect .",
    "[ sec : pn_anke ] first data from anke on @xmath9-production in @xmath1d interactions are presented .",
    "these data show that deuterium can be used as an effective neutron target for meson - production studies like , e.g. , for some of the planned measurements on @xmath6-production .",
    "the data also yield novel information about the @xmath9-production cross section in @xmath20 interactions .",
    "one of the primary goals of hadronic physics is the understanding of the internal structure of mesons and baryons , their production and decays , in terms of quarks and gluons .",
    "the non - perturbative character of the underlying theory  quantum chromo dynamics ( qcd )  hinders straight forward calculations .",
    "qcd can be treated explicitly in the low momentum - transfer regime using lattice techniques @xcite , which are , however , not yet in the position to make quantitative statements about the light scalars . alternatively , qcd inspired models , which use effective degrees of freedom , are to be used .",
    "the constituent quark model is one of the most successful in this respect ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "this approach treats the lightest scalar resonances @xmath6(980 ) as conventional @xmath21 states .",
    "however , they have also been identified with @xmath22 molecules @xcite or compact @xmath23-@xmath24 states @xcite .",
    "it has even been suggested that at masses below 1.0 gev a complete nonet of 4-quark states might exist @xcite .",
    "the existing data base is insufficient to conclude on the structure of the light scalar mesons and additional observables are urgently called for . in this context",
    "the charge - symmetry breaking ( csb ) @xmath7-@xmath8 mixing plays an exceptional role since it is sensitive to the overlap of the two wave functions .",
    "it should be stressed that , although predicted to be large long ago @xcite , this mixing has not unambiguously been identified yet in corresponding experiments .",
    "an experimental program has been started at cosy which aims at exclusive data on @xmath6 production close to the @xmath22 threshold from @xmath0 @xcite , @xmath20 , @xmath25 @xcite and @xmath26 @xcite interactions  i.e.  different isospin combinations in the initial state . during the first experiment which has been made in this context at anke ,",
    "the reaction @xmath27 has been measured exclusively at beam energies of @xmath28 and 2.83 gev , corresponding to excess energies @xmath29 and 106 mev above the @xmath4 threshold .",
    "these measurements crucially depend on the high luminosities achievable with internal targets , the large acceptance of anke for close - to - threshold reactions , and the excellent kaon identification with the anke detectors .",
    "the obtained differential spectra for the lower beam energy are shown in fig.[fig : pp2dkkbar ] @xcite .    ,",
    "@xmath30 and @xmath31 in the cms of the reaction @xmath32 .",
    "angular distributions with respect to the beam direction @xmath33 have to be symmetric around @xmath34 since the two protons in the entrance channel are indistinguishable . ]",
    "the background of misidentified events in the spectra of fig.[fig : pp2dkkbar ] is less than 10% which is crucial for the partial - wave analysis .",
    "this analysis reveals that the @xmath35 pairs are mainly ( 83% ) produced in a relative @xmath3-wave ( dashed line in fig .",
    "[ fig : pp2dkkbar ] ) , which has been interpreted in terms of dominant @xmath5-resonance production , corresponding to a total cross section of @xmath36  nb @xcite . based on these data , which are in line with model predictions for different initial isospin configurations @xcite ,",
    "it is concluded that the production cross section for the light scalar resonances in hadronic interactions is sufficiently large to permit systematic studies at cosy ( during our first beam time @xmath371000 events have been collected within five days of beam time using a hydrogen target with an average luminosity of @xmath38 ) .    the data from the second measurement at @xmath39 mev are still being analyzed . as the next step of the experimental program a measurement of the reaction @xmath40 at @xmath41 mev will be performed in feb .",
    "2004 @xcite . for these measurements",
    "deuterium will be used as target material serving as an effective neutron target the results of a similar experiment on the reaction @xmath42  demonstrating the feasibility of such experiments  are described in sect .",
    "[ sec : pn_anke ] . according to our cross - section estimates a measurement of the reaction",
    "@xmath43 should be feasible within few weeks of beam time and is foreseen for winter 2004/05 @xcite .",
    "both , the @xmath44- and the @xmath8-resonances can decay into @xmath45 and @xmath46 , whereas in the non - strange sector the decays are into different final states according to their isospin , @xmath47 , @xmath48 and @xmath49 or @xmath50 .",
    "thus , only the non - strange decay channels have defined isospin and allow to directly discriminate the two mesons .",
    "it is also only by measuring the non - strange decay channels that csb can be investigated .",
    "as described in the following , these measurements require the use of a photon detector for active @xmath51- or @xmath52-meson identification .",
    "with such a detector the strange decay channels @xmath53 should be measured in parallel and the results can be compared with those from anke for the charged kaons .",
    "figure [ fig : pp2dpieta ] shows the results from anke for the reaction @xmath54 .",
    "the measurements have been made in parallel to the ones for the decay channel @xmath55 .",
    "in contrast to these data , where the spectra contain less than 10% of misidentified particles , the @xmath56 signal is on top of a huge broad background stemming from multi - pion events ( right spectrum in fig .",
    "[ fig : pp2dpieta ] ) .",
    "this makes the analysis of this channel much more demanding and even model dependent @xcite .",
    "a total cross section of @xmath57b has been extracted from the data with a resonant contribution of @xmath58b .",
    "the data from anke indicate that with better background suppression ( i.e.  identification of the @xmath52 in the final state ) the @xmath7-resonance can be studied at cosy in the non - strange decay channels as well .",
    "thus , for the proposed measurements on the @xmath6 the detection of the photons from @xmath51 and @xmath52 decays is required . due to the larger @xmath59 values in the non - strange channels the angular acceptance of the corresponding photon detector should be as large as possible .",
    "figure [ fig : m_pi0eta_model ] shows the predicted invariant @xmath60 mass spectrum for the reaction @xmath61 @xcite assuming an `` ideal '' experiment ( i.e.  perfect @xmath51 and @xmath52 identification and no background  comparable to the current conditions at anke for @xmath9-mesons , c.f.lower left spectrum in fig .",
    "[ fig : pp2dkkbar ] ) .",
    "the @xmath44-resonance is , in fact , visible on a broad background of non - resonant @xmath60 events .",
    "note that the calculated total cross sections for the resonant and non - resonant contributions from ref.@xcite are in accord with the above mentioned experimental values from anke .",
    "since it is possible to manipulate the initial isospin of purely hadronic reactions one can identify observables that vanish in the absence of csb @xcite . the idea behind the proposed experiments",
    "is the same as behind recent measurements of csb effects in the reactions @xmath62 @xcite and @xmath63 @xcite .",
    "however , the interpretation of the signal from the scalar mesons is largely simplified as compared to the pion case .",
    "since the @xmath7 and the @xmath8 are rather narrow overlapping resonances , the @xmath7-@xmath8 mixing in the final state is enhanced by more than an order of magnitude compared to csb in the production operator ( i.e.  `` direct '' csb violating @xmath64 production ) and should , e.g. , give the dominant contribution to the csb effect via the reaction chain @xmath65 @xcite .",
    "this reaction seems to be most promising for the extraction of csb effects , since the initial deuterons and the @xmath66 particle in the final state have isospin @xmath67 ( `` isospin filter '' ) .",
    "thus , any observation of @xmath60 production in this particular channel is a direct indication of csb and can give information about the @xmath7-@xmath8 mixing amplitude @xcite . according to our cross section estimates",
    ", it should be possible to collect sufficient statistics within a few weeks of beam time if a frozen - pellet target is used offering luminosities of more than @xmath68 @xcite .    in analogy with the measurement of csb effects in the reaction @xmath69",
    ", it has been predicted that the measurement of angular asymmetries ( i.e.  forward - backward asymmetry in the @xmath70 c.m.s . ) can give information about the @xmath7-@xmath8 mixing @xcite .",
    "it was stressed in ref .",
    "@xcite that  in contrast to the @xmath62 experiment where the forward - backward asymmetry was found to be as small as 0.17% @xcite  the reaction @xmath71 is subject to a kinematical enhancement . as a consequence , the effect is predicted to be significantly larger in the @xmath7/@xmath8 case .",
    "the numbers range from some 10% @xcite to factors of a few @xcite and , thus , should easily be observable in an experiment with a large acceptance photon detector at cosy .",
    "it has been pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite that the analyzing power of the reaction @xmath72 also carries information about the @xmath7-@xmath8 mixing amplitude .",
    "this quantity can be measured at cosy as well , using the polarized proton beam and a azimuthally symmetric photon detector .",
    "experimental data on the @xmath9-production cross section from @xmath20 interactions in the close - to - threshold regime are not available yet .",
    "this quantity is , for example , crucial for the theoretical description of @xmath12 and @xmath73 data since it has to be used as an input parameter for corresponding model calculations , like transport codes .",
    "predictions for the ratio @xmath74 range from one to six , depending on the underlying model assumptions : in ref.@xcite it has been proposed that there is no difference between @xmath9 production on the neutron and proton , whereas the analysis in ref .",
    "@xcite yields @xmath75 for the total production cross sections .",
    "the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite draw an analogy between @xmath9- and @xmath52-meson production and give a ratio of six for the ratio between production on the neutron and proton .",
    "@xmath9-production in @xmath1d interactions has been investigated with anke at two beam energies , @xmath76 and 2.02 gev .",
    "figure [ fig : pd2k+x ] shows the @xmath9-momentum spectrum for the higher beam energy .",
    "based on the assumption that the @xmath9-production cross section is governed by the sum of the elementary @xmath0 and the @xmath20 cross sections , the spectra have been analyzed in a simple phase - space approach , assuming @xmath77 with @xmath78 being a free parameter .",
    "the main results of this analysis are described below , however , for further details we refer to a forthcoming publication .    in order to determine @xmath74 , phase - space distributed @xmath79 and @xmath80 events",
    "have been generated with the pluto package @xcite taking into account the intrinsic motion of the nucleons in the deuteron .",
    "the events have been generated for all reaction channels which may lead to @xmath9-production in @xmath81 interactions at our beam energy and have been weighted according to the cross - section parameterizations from ref.@xcite .",
    "each event subsequently has been tracked through the spectrometer and all detection efficiencies have been taken into account . in fig .",
    "[ fig : pd2k+x ] we show the resulting momentum spectra based on the approaches from from ref .",
    "@xcite ( dashed line labeled by `` @xmath82 '' ) and ref .",
    "@xcite ( dash - dotted line labeled by `` @xmath83 '' ) .",
    "the apparent difference between the calculated and measured cross sections can be due to the fact that the ratio @xmath78 is different than in refs .",
    "thus we repeated the simulations keeping the relative weights of the individual @xmath0 and @xmath20 channels constant ( as given by ref.@xcite ) but treating the ratio of the sum of these two contributions , i.e.  @xmath74 , as a free parameter .",
    "the best agreement between data and calculations is obtained for @xmath84 at 1.83 gev and @xmath85 at 2.02 gev ( solid line in fig .",
    "[ fig : pd2k+x ] ) .",
    "the resulting large cross - section ratio @xmath74 from the inclusive spectra is supported by the analysis of missing - mass spectra from @xmath86 events recorded during the same beam time .",
    "the spectrum for @xmath87 gev is shown in fig.[fig : pd2k+px ] and is compared with the result of the monte - carlo simulations , again for different ratios @xmath74 . in the simulations",
    "it has been taken into account that protons can either stem from the @xmath9 production processes ( e.g.  @xmath88 but not from @xmath89 ) or from the subsequent hyperon decay ( @xmath0 and @xmath20 ) . the best agreement between data and simulations",
