    "a greedy user selection algorithm combined with zero - forcing beamforming ( zfbf ) has been proposed in  @xcite as a lower complexity alternative to the capacity - achieving dirty paper coding ( dpc ) in a downlink transmission system .",
    "this scheme captures a significant fraction of the sum capacity . a similar combination of zfbf and a greedy user selection algorithm has been shown to achieve full asymptotic dpc sum rate in  @xcite .",
    "also , the authors propose a near - optimum method for moderate number of users by using lq decomposition and pruning the search space .",
    "this scheme with a lower complexity as compared to the scheme in  @xcite optimizes zfbf weight vectors ( called optimum zfbf in this context ) by using a composite channel matrix formed only from active users .",
    "most of the results on the sum rate performance analysis of zfbf with user selection have been based on asymptotic analysis and/or the combination of zfbf with dpc . however , the performance study for practical scenarios is important from an implementation point of view .",
    "a performance analysis on zero - forcing receivers has been presented in  @xcite where a base station ( bs ) with multiple antennas transmits information to a subset of users each employing zfbf with multiple antennas . for scalar and vector feedback cases ,",
    "the authors obtain analytical expressions for the sum rate .",
    "a sum rate analysis on a semi - orthogonal user selection algorithm combined with zfbf at the bs is provided in  @xcite for two transmit antennas .",
    "difficulty with zfbf performance analysis is that the subchannel gains are the inverse of the diagonal elements of a matrix which has an inverted complex wishart distribution .",
    "this joint probability density function ( pdf ) called multivariate gamma distribution has been studied for a @xmath0 matrix case in  @xcite .",
    "when some kind of user scheduling is applied , this result can not be used directly due to ordering . with the greedy user scheduling  @xcite ,",
    "another difficulty comes from the fact that the subchannel gains are dependent on each other and a decision on any scheduling step directly affects the subchannel gains of previously scheduled users .",
    "in this letter , we provide a framework to study sum rate performance of zfbf with a greedy user selection algorithm and water - filling power allocation ( wpa ) under average ( long - term ) power constraint at the transmitter , which does not exist in the literature to best of our knowledge . assuming each user has a single antenna , we derive a joint pdf expression for the scheduled users squared subchannel gains in closed - form when at most two users are scheduled .",
    "we derive cutoff value for wpa and verify our analysis with numerical results .",
    "notation : we use uppercase and lowercase boldface letters to represent matrices and vectors , respectively .",
    "the operators @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 , and @xmath6 denote norm , transpose , hermitian transpose , cardinality , set difference , and intersection of two sets , respectively .",
    "a downlink broadcast channel with @xmath7 antennas at bs and @xmath8 single - antenna users is considered with @xmath9 .",
    "the received signal at the @xmath10th user is modeled as @xmath11 for @xmath12 where @xmath13 $ ] is the channel vector , @xmath14 is the transmitted signal , and @xmath15 is additive white gaussian noise with zero mean and unit variance for @xmath10th user , respectively .",
    "we assume that channel vectors are independent and identically distributed ( iid ) and remain constant throughout one codeword transmission with independently changing between transmissions .",
    "we also assume a homogeneous network with enough spacings between the transmit antennas where the elements of @xmath16 are iid zero - mean complex gaussian random variables with unit variance .",
    "the bs with perfect channel state information schedules two users at most and forms a bf weight vector for each scheduled user such that no interference is received at any scheduled user . denoting the @xmath17th scheduled user by @xmath18 and the set of scheduled users by @xmath19 such that @xmath20 and @xmath21",
    ", the received signal at the @xmath17th scheduled user can be expressed as @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the unit - norm beamforming weight vector and @xmath24 is the unit - norm transmitted data symbol for @xmath17th scheduled user , respectively .",
    "thus , the transmitted signal can be written as @xmath25 .",
    "the transmitter is subject to an average power constraint such that @xmath26\\leq p$ ] with @xmath27 and @xmath28 representing available average transmit power and the allocated power for the @xmath17th scheduled user , respectively .",
    "the zfbf matrix @xmath29 $ ] is determined by the moore - penrose inverse of @xmath30^{t}$ ] .",
    "the complexity of the channel inversion is reduced by utilizing lq decomposition as @xmath31 where @xmath32 is a lower - triangular square matrix and @xmath33 is a matrix with orthonormal rows such that @xmath34  @xcite .",
    "hence , we have @xmath35 where @xmath36 $ ] and @xmath37 is a diagonal matrix with its @xmath17th diagonal being equal to @xmath38 .",
    "consequently , the received signal at the @xmath17th scheduled user can be written as @xmath39 power allocation is determined by wpa and given by@xmath40 .",
    "note that @xmath41 refers to @xmath42 and @xmath43 is obtained from @xmath26 = p$ ] .",
    "the resulting sum rate is given by @xmath44 the cutoff value @xmath43 depends only on the statistics of @xmath45 rather than its instantaneous realization .",
    "this fact facilitates the performance analysis in the next section . a greedy user selection algorithm quite similar to the one in  @xcite",
    "is employed to schedule two users at most .",
    "the first scheduled user is determined in such a way that it has the largest channel gain and @xmath46 is set with @xmath47 when @xmath48 .",
    "if we have @xmath49 on the other hand , no user is scheduled during that particular channel realization . in the former case ,",
    "a second user is selected from the set @xmath50 such that the sum rate expression in ( [ eq : sumrate ] ) is maximized and the corresponding @xmath51 and @xmath52 are obtained .",
    "if we have @xmath53 and @xmath54 , the algorithm schedules two users from @xmath51 .",
    "otherwise , one user from @xmath55 is scheduled .",
    "finally , zfbf matrix is obtained from the composite channel matrix of the scheduled ( active ) users  @xcite .",
    "the bf and user scheduling algorithm described above is called optimum zfbf throughout the paper .",
    "in this section , we present a framework from order statistics to obtain pdf expressions of the scheduled users squared subchannel gains .",
    "we start by introducing squared subchannel gains under random user scheduling ( no user ordering ) as @xmath56 for @xmath57 where @xmath58 represents the resulting squared subchannel gain when the @xmath10th user is randomly scheduled at the first step .",
    "similarly , @xmath59 denotes the resulting squared subchannel gain when the @xmath10th user is randomly scheduled at the second step ( assuming it is not scheduled at the first step ) .",
    "also , @xmath60 denotes a @xmath61 dimensional orthogonal projection matrix on the null space of the first scheduled user s channel vector .",
    "it is worth to mention that @xmath60 is independent from the decision at the first step for both random user scheduling and the greedy scheduling algorithm described above  @xcite .",
    "the variables @xmath62 have chi - squared distributions with @xmath63 and @xmath64 degrees of freedom , respectively .",
    "their joint pdf is given by @xmath65 likewise , the composite joint pdf of @xmath66 can be written as @xmath67 let us now apply the user scheduling and assume that it yields @xmath68 ( @xmath69 ) and @xmath70 ( @xmath71 ) for the first and second scheduling steps , respectively .",
    "defining @xmath72 , @xmath73 , @xmath74 , and @xmath75 , we can write @xmath76 with@xmath77 when the number of the scheduled users with nonzero power allocations is one and two , respectively . the joint pdf of @xmath78 is required in order to determine the average sum rate .",
    "the following theorem provides a compact way to compute this joint pdf .",
    "the joint pdf of @xmath79 is given by @xmath80 @xmath81 @xmath82 for @xmath83 . in ( [ eq : teorem ] ) , @xmath84 and @xmath85 respectively denote the gamma and upper incomplete gamma functions  @xcite .    considering the greedy user selection procedure described in the previous section , two conditions namely @xmath86 and @xmath87 must be satisfied , which correspond to the first two scheduling steps , respectively .",
    "note that since @xmath88 is common for all candidate users , it has no effect on the scheduling at the second step . additionally , @xmath89 different 2-permutations can be selected out of @xmath8 users as the first two scheduled users . consequently",
    ", resorting to order statistics  @xcite and using ( [ eq : unorderedjointpdf ] ) , the joint pdf of @xmath78 can be expressed as @xmath90 @xmath91 with @xmath92@xmath93 using @xmath94 , ( [ eq : jointpdf1 ] ) can be written as @xmath95 @xmath96 with @xmath97 . properly dividing @xmath98 into two disjoint regions and using ( [ eq : jointpdf ] ) ,",
    "we can write @xmath99 @xmath100 evaluation of the preceding integrals leads to the result in ( [ eq : teorem ] ) .    -.15 in   db , @xmath101 , and varying @xmath8.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=55.0% ]      the joint pdf derived above can be used to determine the cutoff value @xmath43 from the power constraint .",
    "only one user is scheduled with an allocated power of @xmath102 if one of two following conditions holds : @xmath103 and @xmath104 .",
    "similarly , the condition is given by @xmath105 for the case of two scheduled users with a total assigned power of @xmath106 .",
    "consequently , the power constraint can be expressed as the average of the allocated sum power values over these three disjoint regions as follows @xmath107 @xmath108 @xmath109 @xmath110 the cutoff value @xmath43 can be calculated for a given set of @xmath111 values from ( [ eq : cutoff ] ) using standard mathematical software packages . note that when the power allocation values are properly replaced by @xmath112 and @xmath52 given in ( [ eq : cu1_cu2 ] ) , the right - hand side of ( [ eq : cutoff ] ) yields the average sum rate result .",
    "greedy zero - forcing dirty - paper coding ( zf dp ) algorithm is a combination of scalar dpc , beamforming , and greedy user scheduling at the transmitter and shown to attain same slope of sum rate increase with transmit power in db as the capacity - achieving dpc  @xcite . in fig . 1",
    ", we illustrate the simulated and analytically obtained sum rate results on optimum zfbf for @xmath113 , @xmath114 db , and varying @xmath8 . the performance of greedy zf dp with wpa under a long - term power constraint is also plotted as a benchmark .",
    "the strong match between the simulated and analytical results verifies the accuracy of our analytical derivation .",
    "additionally , optimum zfbf yields a sum rate that is more than @xmath115 of the sum rate of greedy zf dp for both cases with a much lower complexity  @xcite . for both optimum zfbf and greedy zf dp , inverse of the cutoff value is plotted in fig .",
    "2 with @xmath101 , @xmath116 db , and varying @xmath8 .",
