    "the contrast , in general , is lower for the coronal hole as compared to the quiet sun , but becomes equal in the upper transition region .",
    "the maximum contrast for both the regions was found at about 0.2 mk .",
    "these results seem to suggest that the doppler velocities and widths could also be different in the network and the cell interior and also there are possible variations between quiet sun and coronal hole .",

    "observations in recent years have shown that a coronal hole has larger blueshifts and linewidths as compared to a quiet - sun region @xcite .",
    "this has been understood as due to the origin of fast solar wind in the coronal hole @xcite .",
    "the network and cell interior show large difference in their intensities @xcite and widths ( figure  2 ) and therefore we expect large differences in their velocities , which is not seen .",

    "the larger linewidths in the network as compared to the cell interior * are * expected because the network is hotter than the latter .",
    "the results also show that the evolution of the network is faster in the quiet sun than in the coronal hole .",
