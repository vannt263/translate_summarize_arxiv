    "the motion of an elastic medium across a quenched disordered background presents a simple paradigm for the understanding of several experiments@xcite .",
    "these include studies of the depinning of charge - density waves@xcite , transport measurements in the mixed phase of type - ii superconductors@xcite as well as measurements of the flow of colloidal particles across rough substrates@xcite .",
    "the issue of universality at continuous depinning transitions has traditionally dominated much of this literature , especially in the cdw context@xcite . however , the behaviour of non - universal quantities in the vicinity of the depinning transition is often of more interest to the experimenter@xcite .",
    "the nature of order , correlations and response within the moving phase are also questions which underly many recent investigations of the physics of non - equilibrium steady states , motivated in large part by the considerable experimental literature on dynamical states of flux lines in the mixed phase of driven , disordered type - ii superconductors@xcite .",
    "the canonical example of a remarkable _ non - universal _ feature of the depinning transition is the peak effect often seen in the mixed phase in the vicinity of the upper critical field @xmath0@xcite .",
    "the peak effect , a generic property of weakly disordered type - ii superconductors , describes the non - monotonic behaviour of the critical current @xmath1 as a function of the temperature @xmath2 or applied magnetic field @xmath3@xcite .",
    "this critical current measures the ( depinning ) force required to induce observable motion of the vortex line array@xcite .",
    "the peak effect is an often spectacular phenomenon , with @xmath1 rising sharply in a narrow region whose width is comparable to that of the zero - field superconducting transition@xcite .",
    "investigations of the peak effect describe a host of unusual phenomena associated with this narrow regime@xcite .",
    "these include `` finger print phenomena '' , slow voltage oscillations , history dependent dynamic response , enhanced low - frequency noise with a @xmath4 spectrum and many other remarkable features .",
    "these are often collectively referred to as `` peak effect anomalies '' @xcite .",
    "approaches to understanding the peak effect have typically followed two distinct paths .",
    "the first views the peak effect as arising solely from the softening of the flux - lattice close to h@xmath5 , as reflected in the vanishing of the shear elastic constant @xmath6 , while pinning strengths soften more gradually , as @xmath7@xcite . as suggested initially by pippard@xcite",
    ", softer lattices should be able to adapt better to random pinning@xcite . in the second class of theories ,",
    "the peak effect is a reflection of the underlying phase diagram of a weakly pinned , flux - line array in the @xmath8 plane@xcite .",
    "it has been argued that such phase diagrams should generically accomodate intermediate glassy phases close to the melting transition@xcite .",
    "the peak effect is then proposed to be associated with abrupt changes in transport across such phase boundaries , with the anomalies rationalized in terms of the glassy nature of such intermediate states@xcite .",
    "a third , as yet unexplored , alternative to these approaches which addresses the origin of the anomalies directly , combines the scenario of an underlying static phase transition with the possibility that driving such a system induces dynamical steady states with no static counterpart . with this motivation in mind ,",
    "the central questions addressed in this paper are the following : consider an underlying static phase transition in a pure system as modified or broadened by weak quenched disorder .",
    "how are signals of this transition manifest in dynamical measurements ?",
    "further , can novel dynamical states with no analog in either the pure or the disordered _ undriven _ system be obtained once the system is driven ?",
    "finally , could some of the remarkable phenomenology of the peak effect anomalies possibly originate in the properties of such states ?",
    "we recently proposed a suitable model system capable of addressing some of these issues@xcite .",
    "our model uses interacting particles in two dimensions close to zero temperature .",
    "these particles form a crystal in the absence of disorder .",
    "the interaction potential contains a simple two - body repulsive power - law interaction as well as a short - range three - body interaction .",
    "the two - body interaction favours a triangular lattice .",
    "the three - body term favours a square lattice .",
    "we tune between a square and a triangular ground state by varying the strength of a single parameter , the coefficient of the three - body interaction @xmath9 .",
    "we place @xmath10 such interacting particles in a quenched disordered background , modeled numerically in terms of a gaussian random field with specified strength and two - point correlations . after finding the ground state of the interacting particles in the disordered background using simulated annealing techniques",
    ", we apply a uniform driving force to the particles .",
    "this results , first , in a depinning transition and then a sequence of partially ordered states with varying degrees of spatial correlations as the force is increased .",
    "the advantages to such a formulation are several .",
    "signatures of phase transitions in dynamical measurements are typically overwhelmed by thermal fluctuations for purely temperature driven transitions , thereby obscuring the very effects we wish to characterize .",
    "our model of a @xmath11 transition between square and triangular phases surmounts this problem while also mirroring similar structural phase transitions in vortex lattices , typically between triangular and distorted rectangular phases , across which broadened peak effects are seen @xcite .",
    "the sequence of steady states obtained in our model as a function of the uniform external driving force @xmath12 acting on the particles , and for various values of the three - body interaction strength @xmath9 , is summarized in the dynamical `` phase '' diagram of fig .",
    "[ phasedia ] .",
    "this phase diagram extends a similar phase diagram proposed earlier to much larger values of @xmath9@xcite .",
    "the phase diagram shows a variety of phases : pinned states which may have dominantly triangular or square correlations , a plastically flowing `` liquid - like '' state , a moving anisotropic hexatic phase , flowing triangular and square states ordered over the size of our simulation cell and a dynamic coexistence regime .",

    "we assign the substantial increase in noise we see within the coexistence regime to the unusual properties of this interface , quantifying this proposal by linking measures of fluctuation magnitude to coordinations intermediate between square and triangular .",
    "we measure several quantities on the dynamical side , including the basic current - force relations , current statistics and current noise at many different points in the phase diagram .",
    "we calculate the koshelev - vinokur `` shaking temperature''@xcite , defined in detail below , to understand how disorder - induced fluctuations in the flow might provide an effective , pure - system temperature in terms of which phase behaviour can be discussed .",

    "we correlate local orientational and density fluctuations within the coexistence state to understand the origins of the anomalous noise in the coexistence regime .",
    "we compare the phenomenology of the simulations , specifically relating to the coexistence regime , to what is seen in experiments on peak effect anomalies in the mixed state .",
    "we argue that this comparison , supported by general phenomenological arguments , suggests strongly that there may be a generic explanation for peak effect anomalies .",

    "we then conjecture that behaviour analogous to what we see in the coexistence regime may be generic to all driven disordered systems in the vicinity of an underlying static first - order phase transition in the pure limit . finally , in our concluding section , section",

    "this annealing procedure involves equilibration using a nvt monte carlo scheme at fixed density and within a fixed background potential of a tunable amplitude .",

    "[ coordno ] ( e),(f ) ) and the system freezes into a triangular latttice .",
    "similar observations hold for the case of scans in @xmath12 at larger @xmath9 , with the difference that the ultimate large - force state is the flowing square lattice .",
    "configurations in the `` coexistence regime '' obtained at much larger forces ( @xmath88 for @xmath89 ) are discussed separately in the sections which follow .      for small @xmath12 the solid",
    "is pinned . in this regime , for @xmath90 , there is no centre of mass motion at the longest times we simulate .",
    "we see transient motion in the initial stages of the application of the force , which then dies down once the system optimizes its location within the background of pinning sites . as @xmath12",
    "is increased across the depinning threshold , there are long transient time - scales for motion to set in@xcite .",
    "these time - scales appear to diverge as the system approaches the transition , in agreement with expections concerning continuous depinning transitions .",
    "however , depinning appears to be hysteretic , on the length and time scales we consider _ i.e. _ the reverse path , from depinned to pinned states yields an abrupt transition between these states@xcite .",

    "the pinned phase is a phase with short - range order in both translational and orientational correlation functions .",
    "correlations typically extend to about 4 - 8 interparticle spacings at the levels of disorder we consider . at non - zero noise strength , strictly speaking , we would expect an activated creep component to the motion .",
    "this presumably lies beyond the time scales of our simulation , given the relatively low temperatures ( @xmath92 ) we work at .      upon increasing the force",
    ", we enter a regime of substantial plastic flow@xcite .",
    "this regime is one in which particle motion is extremely inhomogeneous .",
    "similar plastic flow is seen in a large number of simulations of particle motion in a random pinning background@xcite .",
    "what is unusual here , however , is the strongly non - monotonic character of the plastic flow boundary , as illustrated in the phase diagram of fig .",
    "[ phasedia ] .",
    "note that the plastic flow phase boundary in the @xmath15 plane is largely independent of @xmath12 for small @xmath9 .",
    "however , once the critical value of @xmath9 for the square - triangular transition is crossed , this boundary becomes a strong function of @xmath12 , with the plastic flow region expanding considerably before it collapses again .",

    ", no such phase is apparent in our numerics .    in the plastic flow regime ,",
    "transport properties are noisy , reflecting the underlying highly disordered nature of the phase , in agreement with previous work on such plastic flow states in systems without competing phases@xcite .",
    "we see no evidence for a two - peak structure in the velocity distribution function , unlike some previous work , provided we average enough .",
    "thus no particle is stationary over the full time - scales of our simulations .",
    "as @xmath12 is increased further , we encounter a narrow regime in which translational correlations are short - ranged while angle - averaged orientational correlations appear to decay as power laws . within this phase",
    "the circular ring in @xmath93 concentrates into six smeared peaks , as shown in fig .",
    "[ sqfigs](b ) .",
    "the presence of 6-fold order in the absence of the sharp bragg - peaks associated with crystalline ordering suggests that this phase may have hexatic orientational order .",

    ". however , to strengthen this assignment , other possible assignments , such as to a coexistence regime known to plague similar analyses of hexatics in two dimensional systems , must be ruled out@xcite .",

    "six - fold coordinated particles contribute in main .",
    "this raises the question of whether the intervening ` hexatic ' regime we observe in terms of @xmath57 and the correlation of the hexatic order parameter @xmath95 at @xmath107 , is truly hexatic or defined by a coexistence of the ` solid ' and ` disordered ' phases . if configurations resemble those at solid - fluid coexistence , the distribution would be expected to be a sum of the disordered , relatively ordered and interface distributions ( weighted with their relative areas ) .    to settle this issue",
    "we investigate the dependence of the distribution of @xmath104 on the size of the system .",
    "the distribution is obtained by dividing the system into a number of blocks and computing the distribution of @xmath104 within each block for every configuration . in this way",
    ", information over many length scales can be obtained from the same set of configurations .",
    "this provides us with the distribution of @xmath104 for various fractions of the total system .",
    "we find , as shown in fig .",
    "[ combinedscaling](b ) , that apart from finite size effects , there is not much difference between the distributions . also , the distributions for the two largest systems , _ viz . _ @xmath108 and @xmath109 ( @xmath110 being the size of the simulation box ) , coincide to within statistical errors . in the case of",
    "two - phase coexistence one would expect a strong size dependence when the size of the blocks is comparable to the size of the phase separating clusters .",
    "these observations rule out two - phase coexistence , at least of the conventional kind , as an explanation for the long orientational correlations obtained on circular averaging .    as we show below , a more detailed characterization of this phase yields the following results : long - range order in orientation is always present in the direction of drive , while remaining short - range in the perpendicular direction .",
    "when averaged over all orientations , the resulting function appears power - law - like over 2 - 3 decades _",
    "i.e. _ over length scales addressed in virtually all simulations so far .",
    "thus , while we call the intervening phase as the `` anisotropic hexatic '' , we diverge sharply from previous work in our claim that the true phase is never a true hexatic in the real sense , since it always has long - range order in the drive direction . we conclude that the apparent hexatic correlation arises , in fact , as an artefact of circularly averaging a very anisotropic correlation function , with qualitatively different decays in the longitudinal and transverse directions .      the power - law decay of orientational correlations shown in fig .",
    "[ hexcorr ] , taken together with the scaling of @xmath104 suggests that the driven system in the vicinity of @xmath111 might best be described as a hexatic , with power - law correlations in the local orientation but short - range translational order .",
    "such a state is analogous to the low - temperature phase of the 2-dimensional xy model , where the mermin - wagner theorem rules out long - range order at any finite temperature but vortex - like excitations responsible for the transition to the disordered phase exist chiefly as bound vortex - anti - vortex pairs .",
    "however , the presence of the drive direction introduces an anisotropy into the system .",
    "the consequences of this anisotropy have not , to the best of our knowledge , been explored in previous studies of putative hexatic phases in driven disordered solids@xcite .    in our studies",
    ", we have been motivated by an analogy to the physics of the xy model in an applied field , specifically by the intriguing possibility that the drive might play a role equivalent to that of the magnetic field in the xy model .",
    "renormalization group studies  @xcite of the 2-dimensional xy model in an external magnetic field with hamiltonian , @xmath112 where the external field @xmath113 points along the positive @xmath79-axis , indicate three distinct phases .",
    "these are a linearly confined phase , a logarithmically confined phase and a free vortex phase obtained as the temperature is gradually increased .",
    "vortex - antivortex pairs at low temperatures are linearly confined by a string of overturned spins . with increasing temperature these strings",
    "participate in a proliferation transition , but vortices still remain confined due to a residual logarithmic attraction . as the temperature is further increased , the vortices overcome this attraction and are finally deconfined .",
    "since the external field breaks rotational symmetry , the magnetization is non - zero in all the three phases .",
    "further , the free energy is argued to be smooth ; thus the distinction between phases can only be found in the structure and distribution of topological defects .",
    "the correlation function @xmath114 is then predicted to saturate to a constant value ( @xmath115 , say ) for @xmath116 .",
    "this constant @xmath117 since the order parameter ( @xmath118 ) couples linearly to the field @xmath119 . on the other hand , the correlation function @xmath120 which corresponds to spin fluctuations in the direction transverse to the applied field ( see eq .",
    "( 6.6 ) ) , is predicted to show an exponential decay in all the three phases .",
    "to test this possibility , we must map local orientational order to an appropriate xy - like two - dimensional vector from which defect structures can be extracted .",
    "this is done through the local hexatic order parameter , @xmath121 , defined earlier .",
    "it is convenient to identify this local quantity ( a phasor ) with a ` hexatic - spin ' with components @xmath122 $ ] and @xmath123 $ ] , thus mapping local geometrical order to a soft - spin xy degree of freedom .",
    "we illustrate this mapping from the local orientations of particles in real space to xy spins in fig .",
    "[ mapspin ] . unlike in the xy model ,",
    "such hexatic spins are not attached to a fixed lattice but associated with the moving particles .",
    "they thus encode important information concerning the equal - time orientational correlations in the driven system .",

    "these configuration maps enable the identification of topological defects in the ordering in the associated xy model .",
    "note the presence of locally aligned regions as well as vortex - like excitations of strength 1 and 1/2 .",
    "qualitatively , we find that in both the disordered liquid phase and the anisotropic hexatic phases , vortex configurations in such spin configurations appear to have little correlation with each other , suggesting that they may be either unbound or relatively weakly bound at best ( see fig .",

    "magneto - optic imaging via hall bar arrays support the surface contamination scenario .",
    "however , such methods do not access the dynamics of annealing and phase transformations directly .",

    "as parameters are varied across the peak effect , these experiments see a remarkable coexistence between a strong pinning regime and a weak pinning regime .",
    "a complex interface is seen between these coexisting states with a dynamics which is exquisitely sensitive to the field and the disorder , such coexistence is also a feature of other phenomenological approaches to this problem , which address transport measurements .",

    "however , the complex geometry of the coexisting regimes appears largely stable if the temperature and field are fixed , suggesting that thermal fluctuations are not dominant . while vortices entering from the sample boundaries",
    "do appear to contribute to this dynamics in no small measure , there is significant evidence for non - trivial dynamics in the bulk , with regions of strongly pinned phase being nucleated far from any boundary .",
    "thus , these experiments point to a more active role for the bulk than envisaged in the boundary injection scenario . in this context , the authors of ref .  @xcite",

    "how are these remarkable observations related to the model we study here ?",
    "we suggest that the link is the _ emergence of a self - organized , disorder - stabilized , dynamically sustained drive - induced coexistence phase _ seen both in the experiments and in simulations of our model system .",
    "the similarities between the two are striking : first , the coexistence itself . both the experiments and our simulations here provide incontrovertible evidence for dynamical states in driven disordered systems which resemble phase coexistence at equilibrum phase transitions , with the added complication of spatial inhomogeneities due to quenched disorder@xcite .",
    "reasoning from the experiments , the complex interconversion of one phase into the other and the spatially inhomogeneous character of the dynamics is the hallmark of vortex dynamics within the peak effect regime@xcite .",
    "this is precisely the situation which obtains in the simulations . as pointed out in the previous section ,",
    "what is unusual about the coexistence regime is that the strong disorder - induced fluctuations seen and manifest in all the dynamic properties we measure are obtained _ above _ the depinning transition , surviving even at large values of the applied force .",
    "second , the coexistence seen in the experiments is very disorder - sensitive@xcite . in experiments ,",
    "this is manifest in terms of the complex structure of differentially pinned regions in the sample , presumably reflecting a non - trivial pinning landscape .",
    "we see similar dynamical behavior within the coexistence regime , with the structure at fixed drive influenced by the underlying microscopic disorder and sensitive to even marginal changes in the pinning .",
    "thus , the nature of inhomogeneities connected to dynamical phase coexistence in this model as well as in the experiments appears to be dictated primarily by the underlying disorder .",
    "third , the slow dynamics and long relaxation times seen in the experiments , reflecting the complex dynamics of the interface separating the regimes of different pinning strength , is seen in our simulations as well@xcite . in our simulations , if the drive is switched off and the system allowed to anneal , the nuclei of one phase within the other live anomalously long , suggesting that the dynamics has stabilized long - lived metastable states , precisely as seen in the experiments . in fig .",
    "[ quenchnucl2 ] we show the dynamics of a square nucleus within a triangular background , extracted from a typical configuration within the coexistence regime , when quenched to zero drive .",
    "far from vanishing over a short time scale , the nucleus appears to be remarkably stable out to the longest time scales accessed in our simulations , providing evidence that the metastability exhibited in the coexistence regime survives even after the drive is turned off .",
    "these are reflected in the memory experiments , in which the removal of the driving transport current essentially appears to freeze the system into a metastable state from which it only recovers upon a reapplication of the drive .",

    "the substantial non - gaussian features in the noise , as obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite , indicate that a small number of fluctuators contribute ; it is tempting to assign these to a few large domains which fluctuate collectively within the coexistence regime , as suggested by the simulations .",
    "the edge contamination scenario _ assumes _ that the drive in the bulk anneals the disordered vortices injected across the boundaries into the smoothly flowing state .",
    "in contrast , we show that in the vicinity of an underlying transition , the bulk flowing state is generically inhomogeneous and dynamically non - trivial , thereby questioning this basic assumption .",
    "we believe that the edge contamination scenario should apply , more immediately , close to but away from the peak effect regime , where the drive in the bulk acts solely to smoothen flow , precisely as seen in a recent experiment@xcite .",

    "fourth , the demonstration that the _ putative driven hexatic glass phase can not have algebraically decaying orientational correlations _ , since correlations along the drive direction are always long - ranged while those along the transverse direction are generically short - ranged .",

    "possible connection to the classic problem of the origin of peak effect anomalies _ , conjecturing that the explanation might be found in the very nature of the unusual dynamical states obtained when a system close to a first - order ( structural or melting ) phase transition is driven across a quenched - disordered background .",
    "there are several realizations of non - equilbrium states of complex fluids , such as sheared lamellar phases , worm - like micelles , and driven colloidal suspensions , which exhibit remarkably non - trivial behaviour as a consequence of dynamical phase transitions@xcite .",
    "possible relations to equilibrium descriptions of systems at phase coexistence have also been outlined@xcite .",

    "<S> we propose that this anomalous behavior is directly linked to the behavior exhibited in our simulations in the dynamical coexistence regime , thus suggesting a possible solution to the problem of the origin of peak effect anomalies . </S>"
