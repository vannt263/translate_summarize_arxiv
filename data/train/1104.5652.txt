    "almost three centuries ago charles coulomb ( 1736 - 1806 ) discovered that kinetic friction does not depend on the sliding velocity  @xcite .",
    "later , more careful experiments showed that this law is only approximately valid  @xcite .",
    "friction does depend on the sliding velocity , but this dependence is far from universal : some measurements find an increase when velocity increases , while others find a decay @xcite or even a more complex non - monotonous behavior @xcite .",
    "a logarithmic dependence , often quoted , has been found for two extreme scales , friction at the tip of an afm ( see for instance @xcite ) or at the scale of a fault in the earth crust @xcite , but it is often only approximate and observed in a fairly narrow velocity range . therefore understanding the velocity dependence of kinetic friction is still an open problem , and what makes it difficult is that several phenomena contribute , the thermal depining of contacts , their aging , and the delay in contact formation .    in this study",
    "we investigate the velocity dependence of friction with a model that includes these three contributions and makes minimal assumptions on the actual mechanism of friction so that it can be applied at many scales provided the system involves multi - contact friction .",
    "our aim is to elucidate the respective role of these three contributions to the velocity dependence of friction and to provide analytical treatments in some limits , or simple numerical approaches that allow the investigation of a velocity range that may span many orders of magnitude .    at the most fundamental level multi - contact friction",
    "can be described as resulting a succession of breaking and formation of local contacts which possess a distribution of breaking thresholds .",
    "this viewpoint was first applied to describe earthquakes  @xcite and then adopted to friction by persson  @xcite .",
    "we recently developed a master equation ( me ) approach to describe the breaking and attachment events  @xcite .",
    "it splits the analysis in two independent parts : ( i ) the calculation of the friction force , given by the master equation provided the statistical properties of the contacts are known , and ( ii ) the study of the properties of the contact themselves , which is system dependent .",
    "this method is very general and allows us to calculate the velocity dependence of friction , which results from the interplay of two concurrent processes .",
    "first , at a nonzero temperature thermal fluctuations allow an activated breaking of contacts which are still below their mechanical breaking threshold .",
    "this phenomenon leads to a monotonic increase of the friction force @xmath0 with the velocity @xmath1 .",
    "second , the aging of contacts  @xcite leads to a decrease of the friction force with velocity .",
    "it includes two processes : the delay in contact formation , i.e. , time lag between contact breaking and re - making  @xcite , and the aging of a contact itself , i.e. , the change of its characteristics with the time of stationary contact . to incorporate the latter effect , the master equation must be completed by an equation for the evolution of static thresholds .    in earlier studies @xcite we considered thermal and aging effects separately , to set up the method .",
    "however , to relate the results to experiments , both contributions must be taken into account simultaneously .",
    "this is the aim of the present paper , which is organized as follows .",
    "section  [ master ] is a brief review of the master equation approach .",
    "section  [ temperature ] discusses temperature effects .",
    "whereas our earlier work @xcite focussed on time - dependent phenomena to analyze stick - slip , here we concentrate on the steady - state case ( constant velocity ) .",
    "this allows us to proceed further and derive explicit expressions for the influence of temperature .",
    "then sec .",
    "[ aging ] introduces the second effect , the aging of the contacts .",
    "it first summarizes the method introduced earlier and its main results @xcite , which only considered the @xmath2 case , and then studies the combined influence of aging and temperature fluctuations .",
    "section  [ delay ] adds the influence of the delay in contact formation after breaking , to get the full picture , allowing us to compute the velocity dependence of friction .",
    "section  [ experiments ] discusses all those results in the context of experimental data .",
    "the difficulty to apply the theory to actual experiments is to properly assess the values of the parameters that enter in the theoretical expressions , and not simply try to fit experimental curves , which would not be very significant owing to the number of parameters which are involved .",
    "therefore sec .",
    "[ experiments ] focusses on this assessment . finally , sec .",
    "[ concl ] concludes the paper with a discussion of perspectives for its further development .",
    "the earthquake ( eq ) model is the most generic model for friction due to multiple contacts at an interface .",
    "the sliding interface is treated as a set of @xmath3 `` contacts '' which deform elastically with the average rigidity @xmath4 .",
    "the contacts represent , for example , asperities for the interface of rough surfaces  @xcite , or patches of lubricant or its domains ( `` solid islands ''  @xcite ) in the case of lubricated friction .",
    "the @xmath5th contact connects the slider and the bottom substrate through a spring of elastic constant @xmath6 .",
    "when the slider moves , the position of the contact point changes , and the contact s spring elongates or shortens , so that the slider experiences the force @xmath7 from the interface , where @xmath8 and @xmath9 is the spring length .",
    "the contacts are coupled frictionally to the slider .",
    "namely , as long as the force @xmath10 is below a certain threshold @xmath11 ( corresponding to the onset of plastic flow of the entangled asperity , or to local shear - induced melting of the boundary lubrication layer ) , this contact @xmath5 moves together with the slider .",
    "when the force exceeds the threshold , the contact breaks , and then re - attaches again in the unstressed state after some delay time @xmath12 .",
    "thus with every contact we may associate the threshold value @xmath11 , which takes random values from a distribution @xmath13 having a mean value @xmath14 .",
    "the spring constants are related to the threshold forces by the relationship @xmath15 , because the value of the static threshold is proportional to the area @xmath16 of the given contact , while the transverse rigidity @xmath6 is proportional to contact s size , @xmath17 .",
    "when a contact is formed again ( re - attached to the slider ) , new values for its parameters have to be assigned .    rather than studying the evolution of the eq model by numerical simulation it is possible to describe it analytically  @xcite .",
    "let @xmath18 be the normalized probability distribution of values of the thresholds @xmath19 at which contacts break ; it is coupled with the distribution of threshold forces by the relationship @xmath20 . to describe the evolution of the model , we introduce the distribution @xmath21 of the stretchings @xmath22 when the bottom of the solid block is at a position @xmath23 .",
    "let us consider a small displacement @xmath24 of the bottom of the sliding block .",
    "it induces a variation of the stretching @xmath22 of the contacts which has the same value @xmath25 for all contacts ( here we neglect the elastic deformation of the block ) .",
    "the displacement @xmath23 leads to three kinds of changes in the distribution @xmath21 : first , there is a shift due to the global increase of the stretching of the asperities ; second , some contacts break because their stretching exceeds the maximum value that they can withstand ; and third , those broken contacts form again , at a lower stretching , after a slip at the scale of the asperities , which locally reduces the tension within the corresponding asperities .",
    "these three contributions can be written as a master equation for @xmath21 : @xmath26 q(x;x ) = r(x ) \\ , \\gamma ( x ) \\ , , \\label{q5a}\\ ] ] where @xmath27 describes the fraction of contacts that break when the slider position changes from @xmath23 to @xmath28 .",

    "( [ q5a ] ) describes the contacts that form again after breaking , @xmath32 ( the delay time is neglected at this stage ) , and @xmath33 is the ( normalized ) distribution of stretchings for newborn contacts .",
    "then , the friction force is given by @xmath34    the evolution of the system in the quasi - static limit where inertia effects are neglected shows that , in the long term , the initial distribution approaches a stationary distribution @xmath35 and the total force @xmath0 becomes independent of @xmath23 .",
    "this statement is valid for any distribution @xmath18 except for the singular case of @xmath36 .    in the present work we concentrate on the steady state ( smooth sliding ) .",

    "then , the distribution @xmath49 can be related to the distribution @xmath50 of the static friction force thresholds of the contacts .",
    "if a given contact has an area @xmath51 , then it is characterized by the static friction threshold @xmath52 and the ( shear ) elastic constant @xmath53 ( assuming that the linear size of the contact and its height are of the same order of magnitude , see  @xcite and appendix a in ref .",

    "but even in this case the lubricant film can not be ideally homogeneous throughout the whole contact area  it should be split into domains , e.g. , with different orientation , because this will lower the system free energy due to the increase of entropy . domains of different orientations have different values for the thresholds @xmath11 , i.e. , they play the same role as asperities in the contact of rough surfaces .    for the normalized distribution of static thresholds given by eq .",

    "if the film consists of @xmath265 layers , then the film thickness is @xmath266 , where @xmath267    is the diameter of the omcts molecule .",
    "let us assume that the maximal shear stress exponentially decreases with the number of layers according to the results of md simulation  @xcite , @xmath268 , where @xmath269 is a numerical constant .",
    "taking @xmath270",
    "n / m@xmath234 and @xmath271 , we obtain the dependences of the shear stress @xmath272 on the shear rate @xmath273 shown in fig .",
    "[ a05 ] , which may be compared with the experimental dependences ( fig .",
    "2a ) of bureau  @xcite .",
    "note that our approach may overestimate the value of the crossover velocity @xmath95 .",
    "first , the crossover will occur earlier if the delay and/or aging effects play a significant role .",
    "besides , at low temperatures the stiff contacts lead to higher `` viscosity '' and lower values of @xmath95 than the soft contacts considered above ( see fig .  [ a01num ] ) .",
    "second , we completely ignored the elastic interaction between the contacts .",
    "if the latter would be incorporated , a breaking of one contact may stimulate neighboring contacts to break as well , i.e. , the value of the parameter @xmath219 should describe such a cooperative `` contact '' size which may be much larger than those of individual ones .    giving a quantitative evaluation of the influence of aging on the velocity dependence of the friction coefficient",
    "is harder than for the temperature dependence due to insufficient experimental data .",
    "aging appears to cause a decrease of friction as velocity increases , and thus , when such a behavior is observed experimentally  @xcite it can be considered as a strong indication of the presence of aging .",
    "our analysis indicates that the combined effect of temperature and aging leads to a maximum in the friction coefficient versus velocity .",
    "therefore , when aging is manifested by a decreasing friction versus velocity , extending the experiments to lower velocities and temperatures might detect the maximum and thus provide some quantitative data to evaluate the aging parameters .    although the aim of our work was to find the dependence of the kinetic friction on the driving velocity , our approach allows us to find the dependence on temperature as well .",
    "however , the behavior of a real tribological system is more involved , because all parameters may depend on temperature @xmath274 in a general case .",
    "for example , the delay time @xmath12 may exponentially depend on @xmath274 if the formation of a new contact is an activated process  @xcite ; the same may be true for the aging rate @xmath128 . in this case one",
    "may obtain a nonmonotonic temperature dependence of friction with , e.g. , a peak at cryogenic temperatures  @xcite .",
    "in this study we determined the dependence of the kinetic friction force in the smooth sliding regime on the driving velocity . in a general case",
    ", the friction linearly increases with the velocity ( this creep motion may be interpreted as an effective `` viscosity '' of the confined film ) , passes through a maximum and then decreases due to delay / aging effects .",
    "the decay may be followed by a new growth in friction in the case of liquid lubricant .",
    "estimation showed that for the contact of rough surfaces , the initial growth of friction should occur at quite low velocities , @xmath275  @xmath238 m/s , so that for typical velocities the friction is independent on velocity in agreement with the coulomb law .",
    "however , for the case of lubricated friction with a thin lubricant film which solidifies due to compression , the @xmath122 dependence is essential , and the linear dependence may stay valid up to velocities @xmath276  @xmath238 m/s . at higher velocities",
    "the growth saturates and the @xmath122 dependence may be fitted by a logarithmic law .",
    "the latter velocity interval is narrow if the distribution of static thresholds is wide ; the logarithmic law may be found analytically for a wide interval of velocities when the thresholds are approximately identical , i.e. , for the singular distribution @xmath36 .",
    "we emphasize that our approach is only valid for a system with many contacts , for example , @xmath277 at least  @xcite .",
    "when the contact is due to a single atom as it may occur in the afm / ffm devices , the friction can be accurately described by the prandtl - tomlinson model and should follow the logarithmic @xmath122 dependence , @xmath278  @xcite .",
    "but if the afm / ffm tip is not too sharp so that the contact is due to more than one atom , the logarithmic dependence is only approximate and , moreover , for some systems the friction may decrease with the velocity which has to be attributed to the aging / delay effects @xcite .    in this work we had in mind that contacts correspond to real asperities in the case of the contact of rough surfaces or to `` solid islands '' for the lubricated interface",
    "however , the me approach also operates when the contact is due to long molecules which are attached by their ends to both substrates .",
    "such a system was first studied by schallamach  @xcite and then further investigated by filippov _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite , srinivasan and walcott  @xcite , and barel _ et al .",
    "_  @xcite .",
    "note that when all molecules are identical , they are characterized by the same static threshold , i.e. , this system is close to the singular one , where the logarithmic @xmath122 dependence has to have a wide interval of operation .",
    "finally , let us discuss restrictions of our approach .",
    "first of all , we assumed the somehow idealized case of wearless friction ; wearing may mask the predicted dependences . besides , the interface is heated during sliding ; this effect is hard to describe analytically as well as to control experimentally .",
    "then , we did not estimated the delay / aging parameters ; moreover , these parameters , e.g. , the delay time @xmath12 , may depend on the driving velocity @xmath1 .",
    "besides , we assumed the simplest mechanism of aging described by the smoluchowsky equation , while the real situation may be more involved , e.g. , it may correspond to the lifshitz - slzov mechanism  @xcite .",
    "also , we assumed that the reformed contacts appear in the unstressed state , @xmath279 in eq .",
    "( [ q5a ] ) , which may not be the case in real systems .    the most important issue , however , is the incorporation of the elastic interaction between the contacts as well as elastic deformation of substrates at sliding .",
    "this point certainly deserves a detailed investigation and is the topic of our future work .",
