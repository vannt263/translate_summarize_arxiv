    "social media has exploded as a category of online discourse where people create content , share it , bookmark it and network at a prodigious rate .",
    "examples include facebook , myspace , digg , twitter and jisc listservs on the academic side . because of its ease of use , speed and reach ,",
    "social media is fast changing the public discourse in society and setting trends and agendas in topics that range from the environment and politics to technology and the entertainment industry .",
    "since social media can also be construed as a form of collective wisdom , we decided to investigate its power at predicting real - world outcomes .",
    "surprisingly , we discovered that the chatter of a community can indeed be used to make quantitative predictions that outperform those of artificial markets .",
    "these information markets generally involve the trading of state - contingent securities , and if large enough and properly designed , they are usually more accurate than other techniques for extracting diffuse information , such as surveys and opinions polls . specifically , the prices in these markets have been shown to have strong correlations with observed outcome frequencies , and thus are good indicators of future outcomes  @xcite .    in the case of social media , the enormity and high variance of the information that propagates through large user communities presents an interesting opportunity for harnessing that data into a form that allows for specific predictions about particular outcomes , without having to institute market mechanisms .",
    "one can also build models to aggregate the opinions of the collective population and gain useful insights into their behavior , while predicting future trends . moreover , gathering information on how people converse regarding particular products can be helpful when designing marketing and advertising campaigns  @xcite .",
    "this paper reports on such a study .",
    "specifically we consider the task of predicting box - office revenues for movies using the chatter from twitter , one of the fastest growing social networks in the internet .",
    "twitter  , a micro - blogging network , has experienced a burst of popularity in recent months leading to a huge user - base , consisting of several tens of millions of users who actively participate in the creation and propagation of content .",
    "we have focused on movies in this study for two main reasons .    *",
    "the topic of movies is of considerable interest among the social media user community , characterized both by large number of users discussing movies , as well as a substantial variance in their opinions . *",
    "the real - world outcomes can be easily observed from box - office revenue for movies .",
    "our goals in this paper are as follows .",
    "first , we assess how buzz and attention is created for different movies and how that changes over time .",
    "movie producers spend a lot of effort and money in publicizing their movies , and have also embraced the twitter medium for this purpose .",
    "we then focus on the mechanism of viral marketing and pre - release hype on twitter , and the role that attention plays in forecasting real - world box - office performance .",
    "our hypothesis is that movies that are well talked about will be well - watched .",
    "next , we study how sentiments are created , how positive and negative opinions propagate and how they influence people . for a bad movie",
    ", the initial reviews might be enough to discourage others from watching it , while on the other hand , it is possible for interest to be generated by positive reviews and opinions over time . for this purpose , we perform sentiment analysis on the data , using text classifiers to distinguish positively oriented tweets from negative .",
    "our chief conclusions are as follows :    * we show that social media feeds can be effective indicators of real - world performance .",
    "* we discovered that the rate at which movie tweets are generated can be used to build a powerful model for predicting movie box - office revenue .",
    "moreover our predictions are consistently better than those produced by an information market such as the hollywood stock exchange , the gold standard in the industry  @xcite . *",
    "our analysis of the sentiment content in the tweets shows that they can improve box - office revenue predictions based on tweet rates only after the movies are released .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "next , we survey recent related work .",
    "we then provide a short introduction to twitter and the dataset that we collected . in section 5 ,",
    "we study how attention and popularity are created and how they evolve .",
    "we then discuss our study on using tweets from twitter for predicting movie performance .",
    "in section 6 , we present our analysis on sentiments and their effects .",
    "we conclude in section 7 .",
    "we describe our prediction model in a general context in the appendix .",
    "although twitter has been very popular as a web service , there has not been considerable published research on it .",
    "huberman and others  @xcite studied the social interactions on twitter to reveal that the driving process for usage is a sparse hidden network underlying the friends and followers , while most of the links represent meaningless interactions .",
    "java et al  @xcite investigated community structure and isolated different types of user intentions on twitter .",
    "jansen and others  @xcite have examined twitter as a mechanism for word - of - mouth advertising , and considered particular brands and products while examining the structure of the postings and the change in sentiments . however the authors do not perform any analysis on the predictive aspect of twitter .",
    "there has been some prior work on analyzing the correlation between blog and review mentions and performance .",
    "gruhl and others  @xcite showed how to generate automated queries for mining blogs in order to predict spikes in book sales . and",
    "while there has been research on predicting movie sales , almost all of them have used meta - data information on the movies themselves to perform the forecasting , such as the movie s genre , mpaa rating , running time , release date , the number of screens on which the movie debuted , and the presence of particular actors or actresses in the cast .",
    "joshi and others  @xcite use linear regression from text and metadata features to predict earnings for movies .",
    "sharda and delen  @xcite have treated the prediction problem as a classification problem and used neural networks to classify movies into categories ranging from flop to blockbuster. apart from the fact that they are predicting ranges over actual numbers , the best accuracy that their model can achieve is fairly low .",
    "zhang and skiena  @xcite have used a news aggregation model along with imdb data to predict movie box - office numbers .",
    "we have shown how our model can generate better results when compared to their method .",
    "launched on july 13 , 2006 , twitter   is an extremely popular online microblogging service .",
    "it has a very large user base , consisting of several millions of users ( 23 m unique users in jan  ) .",
    "it can be considered a directed social network , where each user has a set of subscribers known as followers .",
    "each user submits periodic status updates , known as @xmath0 , that consist of short messages of maximum size 140 characters .",
    "these updates typically consist of personal information about the users , news or links to content such as images , video and articles .",
    "the posts made by a user are displayed on the user s profile page , as well as shown to his / her followers .",
    "it is also possible to send a direct message to another user .",
    "such messages are preceded by @xmath1 indicating the intended destination .",
    "a @xmath2 is a post originally made by one user that is forwarded by another user .",
    "these retweets are a popular means of propagating interesting posts and links through the twitter community .",
    "twitter has attracted lots of attention from corporations for the immense potential it provides for viral marketing . due to its huge reach ,",
    "twitter is increasingly used by news organizations to filter news updates through the community .",
    "a number of businesses and organizations are using twitter or similar micro - blogging services to advertise products and disseminate information to stakeholders .",
    "the dataset that we used was obtained by crawling hourly feed data from twitter.com . to ensure that we obtained all tweets referring to a movie , we used keywords present in the movie title as search arguments .",
    "we extracted tweets over frequent intervals using the twitter search api  , thereby ensuring we had the timestamp , author and tweet text for our analysis .",
    "we extracted 2.89 million tweets referring to 24 different movies released over a period of three months .",
    "movies are typically released on fridays , with the exception of a few which are released on wednesday . since an average of 2 new movies",
    "are released each week , we collected data over a time period of 3 months from november to february to have sufficient data to measure predictive behavior . for consistency , we only considered the movies released on a friday and only those in wide release . for movies that were initially in limited release",
    ", we began collecting data from the time it became wide .",
    "for each movie , we define the _ critical period _ as the time from the week before it is released , when the promotional campaigns are in full swing , to two weeks after release , when its initial popularity fades and opinions from people have been disseminated .    some details on the movies chosen and",
    "their release dates are provided in table 1 .",
    "note that , some movies that were released during the period considered were not used in this study , simply because it was difficult to correctly identify tweets that were relevant to those movies .",
    "for instance , for the movie _ 2012 _ , it was impractical to segregate tweets talking about the movie , from those referring to the year .",
    "we have taken care to ensure that the data we have used was disambiguated and clean by choosing appropriate keywords and performing sanity checks .",
    "[ movie_data ]    .names and release dates for the movies we considered in our analysis . [ cols=\"^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     considering that the polarity measure captured some variance in the revenues , we examine the utility of the sentiments in predicting box - office sales . in this case , we considered the second weekend revenue , since we have seen subjectivity increasing after release .",
    "we use linear regression on the revenue as before , using the tweet - rate and the pnratio as an additional variable .",
    "the results of our regression experiments are shown in table 8 .",
    "we find that the sentiments do provide improvements , although they are not as important as the rate of tweets themselves .",
    "the tweet - rate has close to the same predictive power in the second week as the first . adding the sentiments , as an additional variable , to the regression equation improved the prediction to 0.92 while used with the average tweet - rate , and 0.94 with the tweet - rate timeseries .",
    "table 9 shows the regression p - values using the average tweet rate and the sentiments .",
    "we can observe that the coefficients are highly significant in both cases .",
    "in this article , we have shown how social media can be utilized to forecast future outcomes . specifically , using the rate of chatter from almost 3 million tweets from the popular site twitter , we constructed a linear regression model for predicting box - office revenues of movies in advance of their release .",
    "we then showed that the results outperformed in accuracy those of the hollywood stock exchange and that there is a strong correlation between the amount of attention a given topic has ( in this case a forthcoming movie ) and its ranking in the future .",
    "we also analyzed the sentiments present in tweets and demonstrated their efficacy at improving predictions after a movie has released .",
    "while in this study we focused on the problem of predicting box office revenues of movies for the sake of having a clear metric of comparison with other methods , this method can be extended to a large panoply of topics , ranging from the future rating of products to agenda setting and election outcomes . at a deeper level , this work shows how social media expresses a collective wisdom which , when properly tapped , can yield an extremely powerful and accurate indicator of future outcomes .",
    "although we focused on movie revenue prediction in this paper , the method that we advocate can be extended to other products of consumer interest .",
    "we can generalize our model for predicting the revenue of a product using social media as follows .",
    "we begin with data collected regarding the product over time , in the form of reviews , user comments and blogs . collecting",
    "the data over time is important as it can measure the rate of chatter effectively .",
    "the data can then be used to fit a linear regression model using least squares .",
    "the parameters of the model include :    * @xmath3 : rate of attention seeking * @xmath4 : polarity of sentiments and reviews * @xmath5 : distribution parameter    let @xmath6 denote the revenue to be predicted and @xmath7 the error .",
    "the linear regression model can be expressed as : @xmath8 where the @xmath9 values correspond to the regression coefficients .",
    "the attention parameter captures the buzz around the product in social media . in this article",
    ", we showed how the rate of tweets on twitter can capture attention on movies accurately .",
    "we found this coefficient to be the most significant in our experiments .",
    "the polarity parameter relates to the opinions and views that are disseminated in social media .",
    "we observed that this gains importance after the movie has been released and adds to the accuracy of the predictions . in the case of movies ,",
    "the distribution parameter is the number of theaters a particular movie is released in . in the case of other products , it can reflect their availability in the market .",
