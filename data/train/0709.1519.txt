    "<S> in - plane resistivity ( @xmath7(t ) ) shows metallic behavior down to 2 k with a @xmath8 dependence below 30 k ; while out - of - plane resistivity ( @xmath9 ) shows metallic behavior at high temperature and a thermal activation semiconducting behavior below about 12 k. striking feature is that magnetic field induces a ln(1/@xmath10 ) diverging behavior in both @xmath7 and @xmath9 at low temperature . </S>",
    "<S> the positive magnetoresistance ( mr ) could be well fitted by the formula based on multi - band electronic structure . </S>",
    "<S> the ln(1/@xmath10 ) diverging behavior in @xmath7 and @xmath9 could arise from the magnetic - field - induced 2d weak localization or spin density wave . </S>"
