    "strictly , eqs.([cost - rel ] ) are valid only for a one - dimensional configuration where the microscopic permittivity only depends on @xmath0 . in the considered situations ,",
    "the microscopic dielectric profile retains a dependence from @xmath71 which is inherited from the spatial pattern of the ir illumination within the slab .",
    "however , the chosen diffusion length @xmath80 ( characterizing the spatial spreading of the photo - carrier distribution ) is much larger than the ir wavelength so that the profile of the photo - induced carrier density @xmath81 is largely smoothed by carrier diffusion to the point that @xmath81 , and hence @xmath2 of eq.([perm_thz ] ) , can be regarded as uniform along the @xmath71-axis within the slab ( see supplementary material ) @xcite .    in order to numerically retrieve the effective parameters appearing in eqs.([cost - rel ] ) from the full - wave simulations we have averaged the fields along the @xmath0-axis and subsequently integrated such averages along the slab thickness .",
    "therefore , after integrating both sides of eqs.([cost - rel ] ) along the @xmath71-axis inside the slab , we have retrieved @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 by solving the three algebraic equations thus obtained .",
    "the general features of the retrieved thz effective parameters are reported in fig.2 where we plot their characteristic spectral profiles for an ir illumination with @xmath74 kw/@xmath75 and @xmath76 . in fig.2(a ) and 2(b ) we plot the real and imaginary parts of the effective dielectric permittivities @xmath8 , @xmath9 ; whereas , in panel ( c ) , we report the real and the imaginary part of the chiral electromagnetic parameter @xmath10 .",
    "the homogenized response is slightly birefringent ( @xmath82 ) and it shows extrinsic electromagnetic chirality ( @xmath83 ) . in the considered situation , we have chosen the ir intensity profile in such a way that the effective permittivity has a zero crossing - point within the considered frequency range ( i.e. @xmath84 for @xmath85 thz ) .",
    "note that the profile of @xmath10 shows a distinct and broad resonance - like shape in a spectral region surrounding the crossing point @xmath86 which is a consequence of the competition between semiconductor dispersion ( drude model of eq.([perm_thz ] ) ) and averaging features yielding electromagnetic chirality , as will become clearer in the following .",
    "bearing in mind that standard srr - based thz metamaterials are characterized by a narrow - band frequency response , the considered broadband magneto - electric response can be a relevant feature for different applications @xcite .",

    "the high tunability of all - photodesigned thz metamaterials is due to two significant reasons : ( i ) the incident ir profile can be easily and rapidly modified at will ( the dielectric permittivity is written , erased and rewritten even on ultrafast time scales @xcite ) , ( ii ) the possibility to achieve a continuous spatial variation of the microscopic permittivity ( grey - lithography ) greatly increases the possibilities for the effective electromagnetic behavior . in our examples , the freedom to independently set the ir intensity",
    "@xmath39 and the chirality degree @xmath40 of the considered intensity profile allow to investigate the tunability features of all - photodesigned thz metamaterials .    in fig.3 , we plot the absolute value of @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 ( panels ( a ) , ( b ) and ( c ) , respectively ) for two different optical intensities , namely @xmath74 kw/@xmath75 , @xmath89 kw/@xmath75 and @xmath76 . for both intensities , the permittivity absolute value has a minimum at the zero - crossing point .",
    "accordingly , the profile of @xmath88 shows a broad hump , due to the broad resonance of @xmath91 and @xmath92 , which for both intensities is located around the corresponding permittivity crossing - point .",
    "note that , remarkably , the higher ir intensity provides the stronger electromagnetic chirality . in fig.4 , we plot the absolute value of @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 ( panels ( a ) , ( b ) and ( c ) , respectively ) for three different chirality degrees , namely @xmath93 for the ir intensity @xmath74 kw/@xmath75 . while @xmath94 and @xmath87 are almost independent of @xmath40 , @xmath88 is effectively proportional to @xmath40 and it vanishes for @xmath47 , as it must be , since in this case the ir intensity profile is achiral . in panel ( d ) of fig.4 , for the same values of @xmath40 and @xmath39 as above , we plot @xmath95 , where @xmath96 labels the spatial average over the slab thickness and @xmath97 is the @xmath71-component of the thz electric field .",
    "note that the fact that @xmath95 is not vanishing is a key signature of the photoinduced chiral response .",
    "in fact the launched thz plane - wave normally impinging at the entrance slab facet has vanishing longitudinal component so that the matching conditions across such facet requires the vanishing of @xmath98 within the slab and the third of eqs.([cost - rel ] ) correspondingly implies that @xmath99 if @xmath100 .",

    "in order to physically grasp the basic phenomenological features of the all - photoinduced metamaterials we exploit the approach of ref.@xcite which , for a metamaterial with low dielectric contrast , provides an analytical description of the effective medium bianisotropy . such approach is suitable to describe the examples considered in this paper since the two permittivities @xmath8 and @xmath9 can be slightly different ( see fig.2 ) only if the absolute value of the photoinduced dielectric modulation @xmath103 is much smaller than @xmath104 ( @xmath105 is the spatial average of the thz permittivity ) . since we are interested in understanding the main features of the obtained numerical results , to simplify the treatment we do not consider ir propagation within the thin slab ( @xmath106 ) and we neglect both nonlinear contributions and the @xmath71-dependence of @xmath81 in eq.([rate - eq ] ) , thus obtaining for the photoinduced carried density @xmath107 where @xmath108 , @xmath109^ { - 1}$ ] , @xmath110^ { - 1}$ ] and @xmath111 . after substituting eq.([nn ] ) into eq.([perm_thz ] ) and following the approach of ref.@xcite ( see supplementary material ) , we obtain @xmath112   \\frac{\\left(g \\beta   i_0 \\right)^2 } { \\bar \\varepsilon } , \\quad \\quad \\varepsilon _",

    "] ) it is evident that the birefringence @xmath114 and the chiral parameter @xmath10 are proportional to @xmath115 and to @xmath116 , respectively .",
    "accordingly , in the spectral region around the permittivity crossing point , this proves both the slight discrepancies between @xmath8 and @xmath9 in panel ( a ) and ( b ) of fig.2 and the resonant - like shape of @xmath10 in panel ( c ) of fig.2 .",
    "therefore in the low - contrast regime , the smaller values of the average permittivity entail a larger electromagnetic chirality .",
    "physically this is due to the fact that , when the dielectric contrast is very low , the difference between the dielectric profile and its mirror image is magnified for lower values of the average @xmath105 .",
    "note that the dependence of @xmath105 on @xmath39 agrees with the metamaterial tunability features reported in fig.3 .",
    "finally , the expression of @xmath10 in the third of eqs.([approx ] ) suggests different ways for increasing the value of such chiral parameter .",
    "this can be done , for example , by shaping the ir illumination pattern with higher chiral degree @xmath40 ( as shown in panel ( c ) of fig.4 ) and with higher average intensity @xmath39 or by designing the semiconductor bulk with smaller diffusion length @xmath117 and higher ir absorption coefficient @xmath118 .",
    "in conclusion , we have introduced all - photodesigned thz metamaterials displaying 1d chirality .",
    "we have investigated the tunability of the extrinsic electromagnetic chiral response of a 1d photo - induced structure , where the magneto - electric coupling is due the 1d chiral asymmetry of the photo - carrier density profile .",
    "such 1d photo - induced structures show the same kind of electromagnetic chiral response exhibited by chiral layered media which support optical activity ( see ref.@xcite ) and therefore they can be exploited to manipulate thz radiation .",
    "the strength of electromagnetic chirality can in principle be increased by choosing highly asymmetric infrared illumination profiles , by extending our approach to photo - induced 2d structures or by resorting to femto - second laser technology to enhance the photo - induced dielectric modulation depth @xcite . in view of the high spatial and temporal reconfigurability shown by this kind of thz metamaterials",
