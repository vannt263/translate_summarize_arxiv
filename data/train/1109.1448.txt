    "specifically , we have discussed here that an _ absence _ of @xmath3-o hybridization is required to favor the ymno@xmath0 tilt pattern over the inmno@xmath0 tilt pattern ; an absence of @xmath3-o hybridization is therefore a requirement for ferroelectricity in the hexagonal manganites .",
    "earlier theoretical papers correctly noted the electrostatic origin of the `` geometric ferroelectricity '' mechanism in the hexagonal manganites;@xcite we now understand that the relative stability of ferroelectric and nonferroelectric structures is determined by a competition between electrostatics ( favoring the ferroelectric phase ) and covalency ( favoring the nonferroelectric phase ) .",
    "@xmath2 and @xmath1 structure energies relative to the equilibrium @xmath2 phase as a function of in - plane lattice constant @xmath79 by the gga and gga@xmath44 .",
    "( c),(d ) energy differences @xmath42 between the @xmath2 and @xmath1 phases .",
    "positive values indicate that the ferroelectric @xmath1 phase is stable over the @xmath2 phase .",
    "the fitted lines were obtained with fourth - order polynomials .",
    "the vertical dashed lines indicate the calculated equilibrium lattice constants of inmno@xmath0 @xmath2 phase . ]    in addition , since the polar @xmath1 and nonpolar @xmath2 phases are close in energy in inmno@xmath0 as shown in fig .",
    "[ energy_difference ] , it might be expected that their relative stability could be changed using external perturbations such as epitaxial strain .",
    "figure  [ epitaxial_strain ] shows the calculated energies of the @xmath1 and @xmath2 phases and their energy differences as a function of in - plane lattice constant @xmath79 , with the out - of - plane lattice constant @xmath78 and internal positions fully relaxed for each @xmath79 value .",
    "because the critical strain of the phase boundary depends on the @xmath43 value , we performed the calculations using both the gga and gga@xmath44 methods .",
    "we see that the @xmath42 increases with the increasing in - plane lattice constant , indicating a larger in - plane lattice constant could develop the polar @xmath1 .",
    "interestingly , the ferroelectric polarization develops in the out - of - plane direction , in striking contrast to the behavior in perovskites.@xcite therefore we anticipate that inmno@xmath0 could be tuned into the polar @xmath1 structure using tensile strain",
    ".    finally we mention that a recent transmission electron microscopy study of the domain walls in ferroelectric hexagonal tmmno@xmath0 and lumno@xmath0@xcite revealed that a domain wall structure at the edges of the sample is similar to the nonpolar @xmath2 inmno@xmath0 structure : the @xmath3 ion at the wall is at the centrosymmetric position , with one neighbor displaced in the up - direction and one in the down - direction .",
    "detailed calculations of the domain - wall structure in @xmath3mno@xmath0 are ongoing .",
    "in summary , we have proposed a different nonferroelectric ground state structure in the hexagonal manganite inmno@xmath0 , and we predict its occurrence in as - yet - unsynthesized hexagonal tlmno@xmath0 .",
    "the proposed phase has @xmath2 symmetry , and is closely related to the usual @xmath1 ferroelectric ground state but with a different pattern of polyhedral tilts that retains the center of inversion .",
    "the energy balance between the two related phases is determined by a competition between electrostatics and @xmath3-o covalency , with @xmath80 @xmath3-o covalency favoring the ferroelectric structure .",
    "thus , the _ absence _ of ferroelectricity in inmno@xmath0 reveals to us the reason for the _ presence _ of ferroelectricity ( and therefore multiferroicity ) in the other h-@xmath3mno@xmath0 compounds .",
