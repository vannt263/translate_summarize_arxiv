    "the inclusion of nanometric conductive fillers such as carbon nanotubes @xcite , nanofibers @xcite , and graphene @xcite into insulating matrices allows to obtain electrically conductive nanocomposites with unique properties which are widely investigated and have several technological applications ranging from antistatic coatings to printable electronics @xcite .",
    "a central challenge in this domain is to create composites with an overall conductivity @xmath0 that can be controlled by the volume fraction @xmath1 , the shape of the conducting fillers , their dispersion in the insulating matrix , and the local inter - particle electrical connectedness . understanding how these local properties affect the composite conductivity is therefore the ultimate goal of any theoretical investigation of such composites .",
    "a common feature of most random insulator - conductor mixtures is the sharp increase of @xmath0 once a critical volume fraction @xmath2 of the conductive phase is reached .",
    "this transition is generally interpreted in the framework of percolation theory @xcite and associated with the formation of a cluster of electrically connected filler particles that spans the entire sample .",
    "the further increase of @xmath0 for @xmath3 is likewise understood as the growing of such a cluster . in the vicinity of @xmath2 , this picture implies a power - law behavior of the conductivity of the form @xmath4 where @xmath5 is a critical exponent .",
    "values of @xmath5 extracted from experiments range from its expected universal value for three - dimensional percolating systems , @xmath6 , up to @xmath7 , with little or no correlation to the critical volume fraction @xmath2,@xcite or the shape of the conducting fillers @xcite .    in the dielectric regime of a system of nanometric",
    "conducting particles embedded in a continuous insulating matrix , as is the case for conductor - polymer nano - composites,@xcite the particles do not physically touch each other , and the electrical connectedness is established through tunneling between the conducting filler particles . in this situation ,",
    "the basic assumptions of percolation theory are , a priori , at odds with the inter - particle tunneling mechanism.@xcite indeed , while percolation requires the introduction of some sharp cut - off in the inter - particle conductances , i.e. , the particles are either connected ( with given non - zero inter - particle conductances ) or disconnected,@xcite the tunneling between particles is a continuous function of inter - particle distances . hence , the resulting tunneling conductance , which decays exponentially with these distances , does not imply any sharp cut - off or threshold .    quite surprisingly , this fundamental incompatibility has hardly been discussed in the literature,@xcite and basically all the measured conductivity dependencies on the fractional volume content of the conducting phase , @xmath8 , have been interpreted in terms of eq .",
    "assuming the `` classical '' percolation behavior.@xcite in this article , we show instead that the inter - particle tunneling explains well all the main features of @xmath8 of nanocomposites without imposing any _ a priori _ cut - off , and that it provides a much superior description of @xmath8 than the `` classical '' percolation formula .    in order to specify our line of reasoning and to better appreciate the above mentioned incompatibility ,",
    "it is instructive to consider a system of particle dispersed in an insulating continuum with a tunneling conductance between two of them , @xmath9 and @xmath10 , given by : @xmath11 where @xmath12 is a constant , @xmath13 is the characteristic tunneling length , and @xmath14 is the minimal distance between the two particle surfaces . for spheres of diameter @xmath15 , @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the center - to - center distance .",
    "there are two extreme cases for which the resulting composite conductivity has qualitatively different behaviors which can be easily described . in the first case",
    "the particles are so large that @xmath18 .",
    "it becomes then clear from eq . that the conductance between two particles is non - zero only when they essentially touch each other .",
    "hence , removing particles from the random closed packed limit is equivalent to remove tunneling bonds from the system , in analogy to sites removal in a site percolation problem in the lattice.@xcite the system conductivity will have then a percolation - like behavior as in eq .   with @xmath6 and @xmath2 being the corresponding percolation threshold.@xcite",
    "the other extreme case is that of sites ( @xmath19 ) randomly dispersed in the continuum . in this situation , a variation of the site density @xmath20 does not change the connectivity between the particles and its only role is to vary the distances @xmath21 between the sites.@xcite the corresponding @xmath0 behavior was solved by using the critical path ( cp ) method@xcite in the context of hopping in amorphous semiconductors yielding @xmath22$].@xcite for sufficiently dilute system of impenetrable spheres this relation can be generalized to @xmath23$].@xcite it is obvious then from the above discussion that the second case is the low density limit of the first one , but it turns out that the variation of @xmath8 between the two types of situations , which is definitely pertinent to nanocomposites , has not been studied thus far .    following the above considerations we turned to study here the @xmath8 dependencies by extending the low - density ( hopping - like ) approach to higher densities than those used previously.@xcite specifically",
    ", we shall present numerical results obtained by using the global tunneling network ( gtn ) model , where the conducting fillers form a network of globally connected sites via tunneling processes .",
    "this model has already been introduced in ref .",
    "[ ] for the case of impenetrable spheres , but here we shall generalize it in order to describe also anisotropic fillers such as rod - like and plate - like particles , as to apply to cases of recent interest ( _ i.e. _ , nanotube , nanofiber , nanosheet , and graphene composites ) . in particular , the large amount of published experimental data on these systems allows us to test the theory and to extract the values of microscopic parameters directly from macroscopic data on the electrical conductivity .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "[ gen ] we describe how we generate particle dispersions and in sec .  [ cond ] we calculate numerically the composite conductivities within the gtn model and compare them with the conductivities obtained by the cp approximation . in sec .",
    "[ critical ] we present our results on the critical tunneling distance which are used in sec .",
    "[ formulas ] to obtain analytical formulas for the composite conductivity .",
    "these are applied in sec .",
    "[ compa ] to several published data on nanocomposites to extract the tunneling distance .",
    "section [ concl ] is devoted to discussions and conclusions .",
    "in modeling the conductor - insulator composite morphology , we treat the conducting fillers as identical impenetrable objects dispersed in a continuous insulating medium , with no interactions between the conducting and insulating phases . as pointed out above , in order to relate to systems of recent interest we describe filler particle shapes that vary from rod - like ( nanotubes ) to plate - like ( graphene ) .",
    "this is done by employing impenetrable spheroids ( ellipsoids of revolution ) ranging from the extreme prolate ( @xmath24 ) to the extreme oblate limit ( @xmath25 ) , where @xmath26 and @xmath27 are the spheroid polar and equatorial semi - axes respectively .",
    "we generate dispersions of non - overlapping spheroids by using an extended version of a previously described algorithm@xcite which allows to add spheroids into a cubic cell with periodic boundary conditions through random sequential addition ( rsa).@xcite since the configurations obtained via rsa are non - equilibrium ones,@xcite the rsa dispersions were relaxed via monte carlo ( mc ) runs , where for each spheroid a random displacement of its center and a random rotation of its axes @xcite were attempted , being accepted only if they did not give rise to an overlap with any of its neighbors .",
    "equilibrium was considered attained when the ratio between the number of accepted trial moves versus the number of rejected ones had stabilized .",
    "furthermore , to obtain densities beyond the ones obtainable with rsa , a high density generation procedure @xcite was implemented where in combination with mc displacements the particles were also inflated .",
    "the isotropy of the distributions was monitored by using the nematic order parameter as described in ref .",
    "[ ] .    figure [ fig1 ] shows examples of the so - generated distributions for spheroids with different aspect - ratios @xmath28 and volume fractions @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the volume of a single spheroid and @xmath20 is the particle number density .",
    "in considering the overall conductivity arising in such composites , we attributed to each spheroid pair the tunneling conductance given in eq .   where , now , for @xmath31 the inter - particle distance @xmath14 depends also on the relative orientation of the spheroids .",
    "the @xmath14 values were obtained here from the numerical procedure described in ref .",
    "[ ] . on the other hand , in writing eq .",
    "we neglect any energy difference between spheroidal particles and disregard activation energies since , in general , these contributions can be ignored at relatively high temperatures,@xcite which is the case of interest here . for the specific case of extreme prolate objects ( @xmath24 )",
    "the regime of validity of this approximation has been studied in ref . [ ] .",
    "the full set of bond conductances given by eq .   was mapped as a resistor network with @xmath32 and the overall conductivity was calculated through numerical decimation of the resistor network.@xcite to reduce computational times of the decimation procedure to manageable limits , an artificial maximum distance was introduced in order to reject negligibly small bond conductances .",
    "it is important to note that this artifice is not in conflict with the rationale of the gtn model , since the cutoff it implies neglects conductances which are completely irrelevant for the global system conductivity .",
    "we chose the maximum distance to be generally fixed and equal to four times the spheroid major axis ( i.e. @xmath26 in the prolate case and @xmath27 in the oblate case ) , which is equivalent to reject inter - particle conductances below @xmath33 for @xmath34 case ( and considerably less for smaller @xmath13 values ) .",
    "however , for the high aspect - ratios and high densities the distance had to be reduced . moreover ,",
    "since the maximum distance implies in turn an artificial geometrical percolation threshold of the system , for the high aspect - ratios , at low volume fractions the distance had to be increased to avoid this effect . by comparing the results with the ones obtained with significantly larger maximum distances we verified that the effect is undetectable .    in fig .",
    "[ fig2](a ) we show the so - obtained conductivity @xmath0 values ( symbols ) as a function of the volume fraction @xmath1 of prolate spheroids with aspect - ratio @xmath35 and different values of @xmath36 , where @xmath37 .",
    "each symbol is the outcome of @xmath38 realizations of a system of @xmath39 spheroids .",
    "the logarithm average of the results was considered since , due to the exponential dependence of eq .  , the distribution of the computed conductivities was approximately of the log - normal form.@xcite the strong reduction of @xmath0 for decreasing @xmath1 shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2](a ) is a direct consequence of the fact that as @xmath1 is reduced , the inter - particle distances get larger , leading in turn to a reduction of the local tunneling conductances [ eq .  ] . in fact , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2](b ) , this reduction depends strongly on the shape of the conducting fillers .",
    "specifically , as the shape anisotropy of the particles is enhanced , the composite conductivity drops for much lower values of @xmath1 for a fixed @xmath13 .    having the above result we turn now to show that the strong dependence of @xmath8 on @xmath28 and @xmath13 in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] can be reproduced by cp method @xcite when applied to our system of impenetrable spheroids . for the tunneling conductances of eq .",
    ", this method amounts to keep only the subset of conductances @xmath40 having @xmath41 , where @xmath42 , which defines the characteristic conductance @xmath43 , is the largest among the @xmath14 distances , such that the so - defined subnetwork forms a conducting cluster that span the sample .",
    "next , by assigning @xmath44 to all the ( larger ) conductances of the subnetwork , a cp approximation for @xmath0 is @xmath45,\\ ] ] where @xmath46 is a pre - factor proportional to @xmath12 .",
    "the significance of eq .",
    "is that it reduces the conductivity of a distribution of hard objects that are electrically connected by tunneling to the computation of the geometrical  critical \" distance @xmath42 . in practice",
    ", @xmath42 can be obtained by coating each impenetrable spheroid with a penetrable shell of constant thickness @xmath47 , and by considering two spheroids as connected if their shells overlap .",
    "@xmath42 is then the minimum value of @xmath48 such that , for a given @xmath1 , a cluster of connected spheroids spans the sample .    to extract @xmath42",
    "we follow the route outlined in ref .",
    "[ ] with the extended distribution generation algorithm described in sec .",
    "[ gen ] . specifically , we calculated the spanning probability as a function of @xmath1 for fixed @xmath28 and @xmath42 by recording the frequency of appearance of a percolating cluster over a given number of realizations @xmath49 .",
    "the realization number varied from @xmath50 for the smallest values of @xmath42 up to @xmath51 for the largest ones .",
    "each realization involved distributions of @xmath52 spheroids , while for high aspect - ratio prolate spheroids this number increased to @xmath53 in order to be able to maintain the periodic boundary conditions on the simulation cell .",
    "relative errors on @xmath42 were in the range of a few per thousand .",
    "results of the cp approximation are reported in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] by dotted lines .",
    "the agreement with the full numerical decimation of the resistor network is excellent for all values of @xmath28 and @xmath36 considered .",
    "this observation is quite important since it shows that the cp method is valid also beyond the low - density regime , for which the conducting fillers are effectively point particles , and that it can be successfully used for systems of particles with impenetrable volumes .",
    "besides the clear practical advantage of evaluating @xmath0 via the geometrical quantity @xmath42 instead of solving the whole resistor network , the cp approximation is found then , as we shall see in the next section , to allow the full understanding of the filler dependencies of @xmath0 and to identify asymptotic formulas for many regimes of interest .    before turning to the analysis of the next section , it is important at this point to discuss the following issue . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , the gtn scenario predicts , in principle , an indefinite drop of @xmath0 as @xmath54 because , by construction , there is not an imposed cut - off in the inter - particle conductances .",
    "however , in real composites , either the lowest measurable conductivity is limited by the experimental set - up,@xcite or it is given by the intrinsic conductivity @xmath55 of the insulating matrix , which prevents an indefinite drop of @xmath0 . for example , in polymer - based composites @xmath55 falls typically in the range of @xmath56  s / cm , and it originates from ionic impurities or displacement currents.@xcite since the contributions from the polymer and the inter - particle tunneling come from independent current paths , the total conductivity ( given by the polymer and the inter - particle tunneling ) is then simply @xmath57.@xcite as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , where @xmath58 is plotted for @xmath59 , @xmath60 , and @xmath61 and for @xmath62 , the @xmath1-dependence of @xmath58 is characterized by a cross - over concentration @xmath2 below which @xmath63 .",
    "as seen in this figure , fillers with larger shape - anisotropy entail lower values of @xmath2 , consistently with what is commonly observed.@xcite we have therefore that the main features of nanocomposites ( drop of @xmath0 for decreasing @xmath1 , enhancement of @xmath0 at fixed @xmath1 for larger particle anisotropy , and a characteristic @xmath2 below which the conductivity matches that of the insulating phase ) can be obtained without invoking any microscopic cut - off , leading therefore to a radical change of perspective from the classical percolation picture . in particular , in the present context , the conductor - insulator transition is no longer described as a true percolation transition ( characterized by a critical behavior of @xmath0 in the vicinity of a definite percolation threshold , _",
    "i.e. _ , eq . ) , but rather as a cross - over between the inter - particle tunneling conductivity and the insulating matrix conductivity .",
    "the importance of the cp approximation for the understanding of the filler dependencies of @xmath0 is underscored by the fact that , as discussed below , for sufficiently elongated prolate and for sufficiently flat oblate spheroids , as well as for spheres , simple relations exist that allow to estimate the value of @xmath42 with good accuracy . in virtue of eq .",
    "this means that we can formulate explicit relations between @xmath0 and the shapes and concentration of the conducting fillers .",
    "let us start with prolate ( @xmath64 ) spheroids . in fig .",
    "[ fig4](a ) we present the calculated values of @xmath65 as a function of the volume fraction @xmath1 for spheres ( @xmath59 , together with the results of ref .  [ ] ) and for @xmath66 , @xmath61 , @xmath67 , and @xmath68 . in the log - log plot of fig .",

    "this holds true as long as the aspect - ratio of the spheroid plus the penetrable shell @xmath76 is larger than about @xmath77 .",
    "in addition , for @xmath78 the collapsed data are well approximated by @xmath79 [ dashed line in fig .",
    "[ fig4](b ) ] , leading to the following asymptotic formula : @xmath80 where @xmath81 for spheroids and @xmath82 for spherocylinders .",

    "as discussed in the introduction , the theory of conductivity in nanocomposites presented in the previous sections is based on the observation that a microscopic mechanism of interparticle conduction based on tunneling is not characterized by any sharp cut - off , so that the composite conductivity is not expected to follow the percolation - like behavior of eq .  .",
    "nevertheless , we have demonstrated that concepts and quantities pertinent to percolation theory , like the critical path approximation and the associated critical path distance @xmath42 , are very effective in describing tunneling conductivity in composite materials . in particular , we have shown that the ( geometrical ) connectivity problem of semi - penetrable objects in the continuum , as discussed in sec .",
    "[ critical ] , is of fundamental importance for the understanding of the filler dependencies ( @xmath1 , @xmath15 , and @xmath28 ) of @xmath0 , and that it gives the possibility to formulate analytically such dependencies , at least for some asymptotic regimes . in this respect ,",
    "the body of work which can be found on the connectivity problem in the literature finds a straightforward applicability in the present context of transport in nanocomposites .",
    "for example , it is not uncommon to find studies on the connectivity of semi - penetrable objects in the continuum where the thickness @xmath47 of the penetrable shell is phenomenologically interpreted as a distance of the order of the tunneling length @xmath13.@xcite this interpretation is replaced here by eq .   which provides a clear recipe for the correct use , in the context of tunneling , of the connectivity problem through the critical thickness @xmath106 .",
    "furthermore , eq .   could be applied to nanocomposite systems where , in addition to the hard - core repulsion between the impenetrable particles , effective inter - particle interactions are important , such as those arising from depletion interaction in polymer - base composites . in this respect , recent theoretical results on the connectivity of polymer - nanotube composites may find a broader applicability in the present context.@xcite    it is also worth noticing that , although our results on the filler dependencies of @xmath42 for prolate objects with @xmath24 can be understood from the consideration of excluded volume effects ( e.g. second virial approximation ) , the corresponding @xmath42 formulas for the oblate and spherical cases are empirical , albeit rather accurate with respect to our monte carlo results .",
    "it would be therefore interesting to find microscopic justifications to our results , especially for the case of oblates with @xmath25 , which appear to display a power - law dependence of @xmath42 on the volume fraction [ eq .  ] .",
    "let us now turn to discuss some consequences of the theory presented here . as shown in sec .",
    "[ formulas ] the cross - over volume fraction @xmath2 depends explicitly on the conductivity @xmath55 of the insulating medium , leading to the possibility of shifting @xmath2 by altering @xmath55 .",
    "formulas and were obtained by assuming that the transport mechanism leading to @xmath55 was independent of the concentration of the conducting fillers , as it is the case for polymer - based nanocomposites , where the conduction within the polymer is due to ion mobility . in that case , a change in @xmath55 , and so a change in @xmath2 , could be induced by a change in the ion concentration .",
    "this is nicely illustrated by an example where a conductive polymer composite with large ionic conductivity was studied as a material for humidity sensors.@xcite this consisted of carbon black dispersed in a poly(4-vinylpyridine ) matrix which was quaternized in order to obtain a polyelectrolyte .",
    "since the absorbed water molecules interact with the polyelectrolyte and facilitate the ionic dissociation , higher humidity implies a larger ionic conductivity . in fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] we have redrawn fig . 4 of ref .  [ ] in terms of the conductance as a function of carbon black content for different humidity levels . consistently with our assumptions , one can see that with the increase of humidity the matrix intrinsic conductivity is indeed shifted upward , while this has a weaker effect on the conductivity for higher contents of carbon black , where transport is governed by interparticle tunneling ( a slight downshift in this region is attributed to enhanced interparticle distances due to water absorption ) . the net effect illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] is thus a shift of the crossover point @xmath2 towards higher values of carbon black content .",
    "it is worth noticing that the explanation proposed by the authors of ref .",
    "[ ] in order to account for their finding is equivalent to the global tunneling network / crossover scenario .",
    "another feature which should be expected by the global tunneling network model concerns the response of the conductivity to an applied strain @xmath147 . indeed , by using eq .  , the piezoresistive response @xmath148 , that is the relative change of the resistivity @xmath149 upon an applied @xmath147 , reduces to : @xmath150 in the above expression @xmath151 for fillers having the same elastic properties of the insulating matrix .",
    "in contrast , for elastically rigid fillers this term can be rewritten as @xmath152d\\ln(\\phi)/d\\varepsilon$ ] , which is also approximatively a constant due to the @xmath42 dependence on @xmath1 as given in eqs .  , , and , and to @xmath153 .",
    "hence , the expected dominant dependence of @xmath148 is of the form @xmath154 , which has been observed indeed in refs . [ ] .    finally , before concluding",
    ", we would like to point out that , with the theory presented in this paper , both the low temperature and the filler dependencies of nanocomposites in the dielectric regime have a unified theoretical framework .",
    "indeed , by taking into account particle excitation energies , eq .",
    "can be generalized to include inter - particle electronic interactions , leading , within the critical path approximation , to a critical distance @xmath42 which depends also on such interactions and on the temperature",
    ". the resulting generalized theory would be equivalent then to the hopping transport theory corrected by the excluded volume effects of the impenetrable cores of the conducting particles .",
    "an example of this generalization for the case of nanotube composites is the work of ref .",
    "[ ] .    in summary",
    ", we have considered the tunneling - percolation problem in the so far unstudied intermediate regime between the percolation - like and the hopping - like regimes by extending the critical path analysis to systems and properties that are pertinent to nanocomposites .",
    "we have analyzed published conductivity data for several nanotubes , nanofibers , nanosheets , and nanospheres composites and extracted the corresponding values of the tunneling decay length @xmath13 . remarkably , most of the extracted @xmath13 values fall within its expected range , showing that tunneling is a manifested characteristic of the conductivity of nanocomposites .",
    "our formalism can be used to tailor the electrical properties of real composites , and can be generalized to include different filler shapes , filler size and/or aspect - ratio polydispersity , and interactions with the insulating matrix .",

    "the work of isihara @xcite enables to derive closed relations for the excluded volume of two spheroids with a shell of constant thickness and for an isotropic distribution of the mutual orientation of the spheroid symmetry axes .",

    "if now the spheroids are coated with a shell of uniform thickness @xmath164 ( @xmath165 ) , then the averaged excluded volume of the spheroids plus shell has again the form of ( [ eq : vex_gen ] ) : @xmath166 and by constructing the quantities @xmath167 , @xmath168 , and @xmath169 from their definition in ref .",

    "<S> we noted that the tunneling - percolation framework is quite well understood at the extreme cases of percolation - like and hopping - like behaviors but that the intermediate regime has not been previously discussed , in spite of its relevance to the intensively studied electrical properties of nanocomposites . following that we study here the conductivity of dispersions of particle fillers inside an insulating matrix by taking into account explicitly the filler particle shapes and the inter - particle electron tunneling process . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the main features of the filler dependencies of the nanocomposite conductivity can be reproduced without introducing any _ a priori _ imposed cut - off in the inter - particle conductances , as usually done in the percolation - like interpretation of these systems . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , we demonstrate that our numerical results are fully reproduced by the critical path method , which is generalized here in order to include the particle filler shapes . by exploiting this method </S>",
    "<S> , we provide simple analytical formulas for the composite conductivity valid for many regimes of interest . </S>",
    "<S> the validity of our formulation is assessed by reinterpreting existing experimental results on nanotube , nanofiber , nanosheet and nanosphere composites and by extracting the characteristic tunneling decay length , which is found to be within the expected range of its values . </S>",
    "<S> these results are concluded then to be not only useful for the understanding of the intermediate regime but also for tailoring the electrical properties of nanocomposites . </S>"
