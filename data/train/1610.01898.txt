    "epilepsy is a disorder of the brain characterized by an enduring predisposition to generate epileptic seizures and by the neurobiologic , cognitive , psychological , and social consequences of this condition @xcite .",
    "approximately 1% of the world s population suffers from epilepsy .",
    "an epileptic seizure is defined as a transient occurrence of signs and/or symptoms due to abnormal excessive or synchronous neuronal activity in the brain @xcite . in about 25% of individuals with epilepsy",
    ", seizures can not be controlled by any available therapy . during the last decades a variety of potential seizure - generating ( ictogenic ) mechanisms",
    "have been identified , including synaptic , cellular , and structural plasticity as well as changes in the extracellular milieu .",
    "although there is a considerable bulk of literature on this topic ( see ref . for a comprehensive overview ) the exact mechanisms are not yet fully explored . on the cellular level , bursting neurons are considered to be a potential cause of over - excitability and seizure susceptibility . in regular - firing neurons , a brief depolarization causes the generation of a single action potential , whereas a prolonged depolarization induces a series of independent action potentials . in bursting neurons , threshold depolarization triggers a high - frequency , all - or - none burst of action potentials @xcite .",
    "although a high abundance ( up to 90% ) of bursting neurons can be observed in epileptic tissue @xcite the functional impact of these neurons in extended epileptic networks is still poorly understood .    over the past few years",
    ", substantial progress has been made in modeling epileptic phenomena at different scales ( see refs . and",
    "for an overview ) .",
    "large - scale network models take into account intrinsic properties of neurons and the complex , nonrandom connectivity of cortex @xcite .",
    "findings obtained with these models stress the importance of both cellular and network mechanisms in the generation of seizure - like dynamics , which suggests that a single ictogenic mechanism alone may not be responsible for seizure generation .",
    "we here investigate numerically the influence of different neuron dynamics ( regular spiking , chattering , bursting ) on global synchrony in neuronal networks with connection topologies of lattice , small - world , and random type .",

    "we study networks of izhikevich model neurons @xmath0 which are described by the following two - dimensional map @xcite :    @xmath1    here @xmath2 is considered as membrane potential and @xmath3 specifies the total input current which is composed of three currents : @xmath4 @xmath5 is a constant current which is injected into all neurons .",
    "@xmath6 represents the synaptic coupling , and the noisy current @xmath7 is used to generate asynchronous states as initial conditions .",
    "whenever @xmath8 reaches a threshold ( here @xmath9 ) , neuron @xmath0 fires and its dynamical variables are updated in the following way : @xmath10    depending on parameters @xmath11 , and @xmath12 , the neuron model mimics the behavior of regular spiking , bursting , or chattering neurons ( cf .",
    "table [ cg - tab - neuronparams ] and figure [ cg - neurontypesbilder ] ) .",
    "we studied networks of 10.000 model neurons ( we note that we obtained similar findings for networks of 4.000 , 20.000 and 50.000 neurons ) .",
    "we considered a one - dimensional lattice on which every neuron is connected to its @xmath13 nearest neighbors ( here @xmath14 ) using a cyclic boundary condition .",
    "starting from this configuration , every directed connection was removed with probability @xmath15 $ ] and a connection between two randomly chosen , previously unconnected neurons was introduced .",
    "besides networks consisting of only a single neuron type , we built inhomogeneous networks consisting of spiking and bursting neurons and of spiking and chattering neurons and investigated the network dynamics in dependence on the fraction of different neuron types .",
    "as initial condition we chose asynchronous states , which were generated in the following way : to every neuron we assigned a binary noise input , which takes a value of @xmath16 with a probability of @xmath17 and 0 otherwise .",
    "we began with @xmath18 and repeatedly decreased @xmath19 by @xmath20 after 200 timesteps until @xmath21 .",
    "then we let these networks evolve for 10.000 time steps to ensure that transients died out .",
    "we then measured the fraction of firing neurons @xmath22 for 2.000 time steps . during this",
    "time frame @xmath22 typically exhibited regular oscillations ( alternating periods of high and low values of @xmath22 ) . to assess synchrony in the network , we used the number of concurrently firing neurons at the periods of high values .",
    "this number can be estimated ( due to the regularity ) by the maximum value of @xmath22 within the observation time @xmath23 .",
    "we investigated synchrony @xmath24 depending on the rewiring probability @xmath25 and on the coupling strength @xmath26 for both homogeneous and inhomogeneous networks .",
    "in figure [ cg - hom_cut_rho ] we show the dependence of synchrony @xmath24 in homogeneous networks on the rewiring probability @xmath25 for a fixed coupling strength @xmath26 . for spiking neuron networks , @xmath24 slightly increased for @xmath27 and then reached a plateau .",
    "for the other neuron networks , @xmath24 attained similar values for all investigated rewiring probabilities , except for @xmath28 .    in figure [ cg - hom_cut ]",
    "we show the dependence of network synchrony @xmath24 on the coupling strength @xmath26 for a fixed rewiring probability @xmath25 . for networks of chattering neurons",
    ", @xmath24 increased monotonously with increasing @xmath26 . for small coupling strength ( @xmath29 ) , @xmath24 attained similar values for networks of bursting and chattering neurons .",
    "however , for @xmath30 , @xmath24 dropped for networks of bursting neurons even below the levels observed for networks of spiking neurons . for larger values of @xmath26 ( @xmath31 )",
    "@xmath24 increased again and approached the values for networks of chattering neurons .    for networks consisting of spiking neurons , we observed @xmath24 to increase with increasing @xmath26 similarly as observed for chattering neuron networks . at @xmath32 synchrony of spiking neuron networks decreased since these neurons sometimes showed bursting behavior due to the large input currents generated by firing neurons . for even larger values of @xmath26 synchrony @xmath24 increased again .      in inhomogeneous networks we observed synchrony @xmath24 to increase with an increasing rewiring probability @xmath25 until @xmath33 and",
    "then to approximately stay constant , irrespective of the coupling strength @xmath26 ( see figure [ cg - mixedcutrho ] ) .",
    "similarly as observed for homogeneous networks , synchrony @xmath24 attained larger values for larger coupling strength @xmath26 .",
    "we also observed for @xmath34 higher values of @xmath24 for networks containing chattering neurons than for networks containing bursting neurons , which is analogous to our finding for homogeneous networks .    for a fixed rewiring probability @xmath35 and large coupling strength ( @xmath36 ) we observed an approximately linear relationship between synchrony @xmath24 and the fraction of bursting or chattering neurons in a network ( see figure [ cg - mixedcutfrac ] bottom ) . for a small coupling strength @xmath37 , we observed synchrony @xmath24 first to decrease with the fraction of bursting or chattering neurons and than to increase again(see figure [ cg - mixedcutfrac ] top ) .",
    "for the spiking - chattering neuron network @xmath24 decreased until it reached a minimum at around 40% chattering neurons and then increased to larger values of @xmath24 than for homogeneous spiking neuron networks .",
    "this was , however , not the case for spiking - bursting neuron networks .",
    "here synchrony @xmath24 decreased with the fraction of bursting neurons until it reached a minimum at about 5% bursting neurons and then increased but remained smaller than for homogeneous spiking neuron networks .",
    "this is in agreement with our findings for homogeneous networks as synchrony was larger for spiking neuron than for bursting neuron networks for coupling strength @xmath38 $ ] .",
    "we studied complex neuron networks with homogeneous and inhomogeneous local dynamics . we observed that chattering neuron networks exhibited higher levels of synchrony than bursting neuron networks which in turn exhibited higher levels of synchrony than spiking neuron networks .",
    "in addition , synchrony was higher for small - world and random network configurations than for lattice - like structures . in inhomogeneous networks , composed of both spiking and bursting neurons , we observed that synchrony may be decreased due to the influence of the bursting neurons .",
    "these observations support the notion , that under certain conditions inhomogeneity , such as in the degree ( connectivity ) distribution @xcite , in the coupling architecture @xcite , or  as shown here  with different node dynamics , hinders synchrony ."
