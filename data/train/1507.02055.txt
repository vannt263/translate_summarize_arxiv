    "the giant molecular cloud ( gmc ) w3 is rich in high - mass star activity ( e.g. , @xcite ) and its relatively proximity ( @xmath3kpc ; e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) makes it a prime target for the study of cluster and high - mass star formation .",
    "w3 contains high - mass stars in various evolutionary stages ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the eastern high density layer ( hdl ) neighboring w4 contains the most active star - forming sites : w3 north , w3 main , w3 ( oh ) , and afgl 333 .",
    "activity in most of these regions might have been triggered by nearby clusters and high - mass stars ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "more localized high - mass star formation is found in the western fields ( e.g. , the kr 140 region ) , which show indications of a more quiescent or isolated evolution with sporadic or sequential periods of star formation ( e.g. , @xcite ; see @xcite , @xcite ( paper i ) , and @xcite for a detailed description of the cloud and a review of recent literature ) .",
    "the most prominent regions in w3 have been labeled in figure  [ fig : fields ] , which shows the column density map at a resolution of @xmath4  produced with _",
    "herschel _ data ( paper i ) .        in paper",
    "i we used the column density map to investigate the nature of the most massive and highest column density structures .",
    "we found these structures to be most likely the result of feedback by high - mass stars , the combined , convergent effect of which might ultimately be responsible for the formation of the most massive trapezium - like systems and clusters .",
    "in this paper we present the second part of our _ herschel _ analysis of the w3 gmc ( @xcite ; @xcite )",
    ". results below support the conclusion from paper i that local stellar feedback appears to be a major player not only in the formation of clusters of high - mass stars but also in the overall process determining the characteristics and local evolution within a gmc .    in section  [ sec : data ] , we provide a brief introduction to the _ herschel _ datasets and analysis techniques . section  [ sec : structures ] introduces the probability density functions ( pdfs ) and cumulative mass distributions ( cmds ) and the procedure for selecting the structures associated with star formation . appendix  [ pdf_uncorrected ] discusses the effects of foreground / background ( non - gmc ) material on the analysis and appendix  [ pdf_understand ] describes some details of the interrelationship between the pdfs and cmds used .",

    "the w3 gmc was observed with _ herschel",
    "_  @xcite as part of the hobys key programme ( _ herschel _  imaging survey of ob young stellar objects ; @xcite ) . in paper",
    "i we presented the _ herschel _ observations ( spire / pacs parallel scan obsids : 1342216019 , 1342216020 ; bright mode spire obsids ( for saturation correction ) : 1342239797 , 1342239796 ) , ancillary data , and the techniques adopted to create and analyze maps of dust optical depth and temperature for this cloud .",
    "we recall that these maps were made by assuming a constant dust temperature along the line of sight and fitting spectral energy distributions ( seds ) pixel - by - pixel using the _ herschel _  dust emission maps at wavelengths @xmath5  convolved to the resolution of the @xmath6map ( @xmath736 ; @xmath70.35pc at a distance of 2kpc ) . to describe the sed we assumed a fixed dust emissivity index of @xmath8 .",
    "the optical depth and dust temperature maps were also corrected for the effects of emission from dust in the foreground / background of w3 .",
    "this process removed the non - gmc components to reveal more closely the properties of the interstellar medium within the gmc .",
    "the correction was accomplished by estimating the contribution to the emission @xmath9 at each _ herschel _  band from dust traced by atomic and molecular gas ( h  i and co emission , respectively ) ; see @xcite and appendix b of paper i for a detailed description of the steps and assumptions associated with this technique .",
    "this work uses these foreground / background interstellar medium ( ism)-corrected maps as the default for our analysis .      to convert the observable , the dust optical depth , into gas column density , @xmath10 ( figure  [ fig : fields ] ) , we assumed a dust opacity of 0.1  @xmath11  gm@xmath12 at 1  thz and a mean atomic weight per molecule of @xmath13",
    ". the latter may be as high as 2.8 @xcite but this slight inconsistency was retained here so that the column densities could be directly compared with results in other _",
    "herschel _  and hobys fields based on the same assumptions ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "while @xmath14 is not definitively known in molecular clouds and recent work points to opacity variations that should be considered @xcite , none of these systematic uncertainties in scale should impact our results significantly , nor is such an investigation within the scope of this paper .",
    "many results in the literature relevant to the topic of this paper are given in terms of magnitudes of dust extinction @xmath0 although that is not usually directly observable .",
    "for the purposes here we adopted the common approach of transforming @xmath10 to @xmath0 using @xmath15@xmath16 , although this is calibrated only for lower column densities and largely atomic lines of sight @xcite .",
    "converting directly from submillimeter dust optical depth to @xmath0 would seem more desirable / less contrived and indeed the challenges of doing this have been discussed @xcite . however ,",
    "again our conclusions here should not depend on these precise details .",
    "for the corrected maps applying to the gmc material at a common distance of 2  kpc , we can convert the column density as parameterized by @xmath0 into a mass per pixel : @xmath17 . for the 9  pixels used and the assumptions described above ( distance to w3 and mean atomic weight per molecule ) we find @xmath18m@xmath19mag@xmath12 .",

    "pdfs have been used extensively as analytical tools for describing the distribution of mass in regions of low - mass star formation ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) and in regions of high - mass star formation as well ( e.g. , hobys studies : @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",

    "what is plotted is a",
    " logarithmized \" version of the pdf , @xmath22 , where the independent variable ( for the binning ) is now @xmath23 ( base 10 ) .",
    "the shape of pdfs is not always straightforward to interpret , as various physical processes imprint on its structure .",
    "for example , interstellar turbulence likely determines the lognormal distribution of low column - densities ( see theoretical work of e.g. , @xcite , and observations of @xcite for all cloud types : quiescent , low - mass , and high - mass star - forming clouds ) . following the approach used in previous studies , the main peak in the above pdf and those below was fitted with a lognormal distribution .",
    "all fits were carried out using a non - linear least - squares minimization idl routine based on mpfit @xcite and the result plotted along with the underlying data .",
    "external compression can cause a broadening of the pdf , as predicted in models of @xcite and seen in orion b @xcite and in clouds associated with regions @xcite .",
    "the shape of the pdf might therefore be used to infer concrete basic physical properties of the cloud and individual structures whose material is traced by the pdf ( e.g. , @xcite ) .    of all processes , gravity plays the most important role at higher column densities and for low - mass star - forming regions causes a clearly defined power - law like tail in the pdf ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "high - mass star - forming regions often also show tails at high extinction that can also be accurately modelled as power - laws ( ngc6334 ; @xcite ) .",
    "such high-@xmath0 tails can also have , however , more complex shapes as well , as has been found here within w3 and in other fields ( see also @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "indeed , processes such as turbulence , gravity , feedback / compression , magnetic fields , intermittency of density fluctuations , a non - isothermal gas phase , properties of the cloud formation processes , and even line - of - sight effects , could lead to complex substructure in the pdf tails , such as  breaks \" and peaks , that might not necessarily be well represented with a simple power - law function . in the next sections , we will discuss in more detail how stellar feedback might also imprint on the pdf shape .",
    "effects on the pdfs produced by contamination from foreground / background material along the line of sight , avoided here , are described briefly in appendix  [ pdf_uncorrected ] .",
    "can be compared directly with figure  [ fig : fields ] . in terms of @xmath0",

    "column densities theorized in other studies to be associated with high - mass star formation are very high , for example @xmath24g@xmath16 to produce a star with @xmath25@xmath26 ; @xcite , which corresponds to @xmath27@xmath16 or @xmath28 in our maps and pdfs therefrom . cloud column densities of this order , typically observed only towards regions of active high - mass star formation , are rare and therefore there are often poor statistics at the high extinction end of pdfs . in our explorations we found that the cumulative form of the mass distribution , the cmd ( i.e. , the total mass above any given magnitude ; e.g. , @xcite ) , allows for a complementary and often more straightforward analysis of the higher end of the pdfs .    the large differences between neighboring regions in w3 ( e.g. , the dense and active hdl vs.  the more quiescent and diffuse western fields ; @xcite ; paper",
    "i ) make it necessary to quantify how in - cloud local conditions affect the star formation process . to this end , we have carried out an analysis of individual areas within w3 itself , these being the four fields into which we divided this cloud in paper i : the w3 main/(oh ) , afgl 333 , kr 140 , and w3  nw fields ( figure  [ fig : fields ] ) .",
    "the pdfs of each of the four fields in w3 are given in the upper panel of figure [ fig : pdf_combined_ism2 ] ; the characteristics of the global pdf of w3 in the lower panel clearly depend on the contributions from each of the four fields .",

    "+   +     +   +      while various factors can influence the shape of a pdf , the column density above which it deviates from a lognormal distribution into a power - law ( i.e. , the break ) has been commonly interpreted as the point separating the turbulent medium from the star formation regime .",
    "the pdf break can therefore be understood as the column density above which star - forming structures start to dominate over the local environment ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "this break is therefore an essential parameter for constraining the star formation properties of individual fields .",
    "we have found that such breaks can be identified and characterized by fitting linear functions to the @xmath33 of the cmd .",
    "see @xcite and appendix  [ pdf_understand ] for a more detailed description of the concepts and methodology used .",
    "although the accuracy of the estimate of the break can be affected by the binning ( @xmath34mag ) and fitting procedure ( uncertainties in linear slopes are @xmath35% ) , a major source of systematic uncertainty for the lowest breaks will arise from the corrections applied to the maps to remove line - of - sight , non - gmc material , as explained in appendix  [ pdf_uncorrected ] .    in our application of this approach ,",
    "the division into subfields from paper i was used , as it separates regions with dramatically different characteristics .",
    "our choice of subfields was determined by unique differences in column density and temperature distributions , stellar activity , and stellar content .",
    "constraining the origin of these differences is crucial for understanding the onset of high - mass star activity in the very specific regions of the hdl .",
    "the temperature differences can clearly be observed , for instance , in the temperature pdfs for each field in figure [ fig : pdf_combined_ism2_temp ] .",
    "the w3 main/(oh ) field is the most active and warmest , as well as the only one with ongoing high - mass star formation . at the other extreme , the kr 140 and w3  nw fields are cold and quiescent .",
    "the afgl 333 has intermediate properties , with some high - mass stars , and yet is much more quiescent than w3 main/(oh ) .",
    "the derived values and parameters for the linear fits ( slope and intercept of the lines used to represent the mass distributions ) are given in table  [ table : fit_params ] and the fitted lines are shown in the right panels of figures  [ fig : pdfs1 ] and [ fig : pdfs2 ] .",
    "an expanded view of the cmds in figure  [ fig : pdfs1 ] has been included in figure  [ fig : zoom ] .",
    "the figures show that the first breaks ( @xmath0(sf ) ) derived from the mass distributions approach those in the pdfs , while the shapes of the components can effectively account for visual changes ( bumps ) in the tails of the pdfs .",
    "the accuracy for determining the break clearly depends on the sharpness of the transition between the different ( linear ) regimes in the mass distributions ( i.e. , those fitted with linear functions ) .",
    "a slow transition between two regimes ( i.e. , not sharp , but progressive and occurring over a broader extinction range , as observed for those in the hdl ; figure  [ fig : zoom ] ) would result in a higher degree of uncertainty , as the identification of the end and starting points of the linear regimes becomes less clear",
    ". a higher degree of uncertainty for the first break of the kr 140 field is expected due to this effect and the fact that this field is also the one with the most severe line - of - sight ( molecular ) contamination .",
    "prominent differences can be seen between the pdfs of the two regions in the hdl and those of the western fields .",
    "w3  nw and kr 140 ( see figure  [ fig : pdfs2 ] ) show simpler , well - fitted pdfs . while a classical power - law function would not be able to reproduce the pdf tails of the western fields , our fits derived from the linear functions to the mass distributions can reproduce them well .",
    "the w3 main/(oh ) and afgl 333 fields ( see figure  [ fig : pdfs1 ] ) have much more complex tails extending to high extinction .",
    "while our fits do not manage to reproduce this complexity as accurately as those for the western fields , they successfully locate the @xmath0(sf )  break and manage to trace the overall variation of the tails with increasing extinction .",
    "note that , like for the western fields , the tails of these pdfs would not be well fitted with a classic power - law function either .",
    "the fits to the mass distributions reveal the presence of a second major break in the pdfs of the hdl fields ( defined in this work as @xmath0(htb ) , for  high - extinction transition break \" ) .",
    "this break marks the transition point between the classical power - law tail of the pdf and a ",
    "flatter \" regime , fitted in the mass distributions with a third linear function ( blue slopes ; figure  [ fig : pdfs1 ] ) .",
    "as with the first break in the kr 140 field , this second transition was found to be considerably wide and progressive ( i.e. , characterized by a smooth , slow transition ) for both hdl fields , therefore resulting in a higher degree of uncertainty when determining the true transition point .",
    "the regions traced by these intermediate ( transition ) extinctions are identified with the structures and shells in w3 main/(oh ) and the afgl 333 fields , which host the most massive ridges and clumps in the w3 gmc",
    ".    the actual break at which the flat regime at high extinctions starts to dominate in the pdf ( @xmath0(hb ) ) is marked by the point where the mass distribution is properly described by the third linear function , whose parameters have been included in table [ table : fit_params ] .",
    "this extinction is also coincident with the point where the two linear fits ( blue and red ) in the mass distributions intersect in the pdf ( figure  [ fig : pdfs1 ] ) .",
    "these points are @xmath0(hb)@xmath36mag and @xmath37mag for afgl 333 and w3 main/(oh ) , respectively .",
    "the presence and nature of this possible break is important due to its link with high column density material , including high - mass star - forming regions .",
    "while all fields have comparable total mass , those in the hdl have distributions of material at higher extinctions that distinguish them , not only from the kr 140 and w3  nw fields , but also between themselves ( e.g. , based on kolmogorov - smirnov ( ks ) probability tests ) .",
    "considering also their dramatic differences in ( high - mass ) stellar activity , characterization of the different @xmath0 regions , with the aid of the pdfs , is essential for understanding the processes driving current star formation and the history that led to these ( successful ) conditions .",
    "below , we discuss each @xmath0 range in turn .      compared with other high - mass star - forming regions ( e.g. , rosette cloud ; @xcite ) ,",
    "the properties of the pdfs / mass distributions of w3 indicate that material with extinction @xmath38mag comprises a typical gmc environment , or _ common plateau _ , on which the structures with star - forming potential are observed .",
    "note that the critical extinction for core formation of @xmath39mag @xcite relies on a filamentary environment , so the above estimate represents the environment of the filament itself .",
    "excluding w3 main/(oh ) , the only field with confirmed on - going high - mass star formation ( e.g. , hc regions ) , the actual transition point to the gravity - dominated regime in w3 is found to be @xmath40@xmath0(sf)@xmath41mag .",
    "more than @xmath42 of the class 0/i yso population @xcite is contained above the @xmath0(sf )  of a given field ( except in kr 140 , where @xmath43 of the population is below the @xmath0(sf ) ) .",
    "the pdf breaks are therefore suitable limits for identifying the major current and potential star - forming sites in the gmc , separating these from typical environmental column densities in the cloud .",
    "the amount of star - forming cloud mass in each field , based on these limits , is shown in table [ table : sf_parameters_ism ] .",
    "similarly , we can also define typical environmental temperatures , or @xmath44 , for each field .",
    "the temperatures associated with material below the @xmath0(sf )  coincide with the peaks of the temperature pdfs shown in figure [ fig : pdf_combined_ism2_temp ] ; i.e. , @xmath45k , @xmath46k , @xmath47k , @xmath47k for w3 main/(oh ) , afgl 333 , kr 140 , and w3  nw , respectively .",
    "note , however , that a key property of the youngest high - mass star - forming regions in w3 is their association with high - column density material with temperatures highly above environmental ( paper i ) .",
    "exclusion of such warm material when identifying young regions would clearly underestimate the true star - forming potential of the gmc , especially in terms of high - mass stars .",

    ", we suggest that these second breaks originate from , or are influenced by , the effects of an external dynamic process . in the case of w3 , this process is dominated by stellar feedback and associated triggering ( compression ) from high - mass stars , acting on already relatively dense star - forming structures ( e.g. , shells ) .",
    "therefore , the structure of the pdfs of w3 provide additional evidence for the convergence constructive feedback scenario of high - mass star formation ( paper i ) .",

    "is @xmath73% ( corona australis ) . compared to these low - mass star - forming clouds , w3 appears to have an anomalously high proportion of mass involved in star formation , with a very high potential to form new stars in the next @xmath74yrs @xcite despite its already significant ongoing star activity .",
    "w4 shows signatures of prominent stellar activity that has been ongoing for at least @xmath75myr @xcite .",
    "regardless of the distribution of material in the w3 region prior to the formation of w4 , the scenario of successive episodes of ( high - mass ) star formation and bubble development described by these authors suggests that w4 not only influenced the star formation process in w3 at the distance of the hdl , but also that the hdl , the densest structure in w3 , originated due to this same activity of bubble / shell expansion , redistribution , and compression of material .",
    "the idea of a triggered origin for the hdl ( e.g. , by compression ) has already been suggested in previous studies ( e.g. , @xcite ) , and is strongly supported by extensive observational evidence .",
    "its location , parallel to the w4 region , the morphological and physical characteristics of the hdl presented in this work , as well as the w4-w3 stellar age and cluster distributions ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) , indicate a clear influence of w4 on the material as well as the stellar activity in the hdl over an extended period of time .",
    "based on this result , and with the hdl dominating the contribution of dense material in the gmc , stellar feedback can therefore explain the high mass@xmath67 in the hdl and therefore in w3 as a whole .",
    "feedback as the driver distinguishing the structures in the hdl from those in the western fields is also supported by molecular observations @xcite .",
    "the key issue remains as to whether or not feedback can also explain the local differences between fields , and why high - mass star formation is exclusive to just some particular regions in the hdl ( w3 main/(oh ) ) .",
    "theoretical models and simulations predict that stellar feedback can indeed have a significant impact on the star formation process . depending on environmental conditions and the location and number of high - mass stars",
    ", feedback strongly disturbs cloud morphology , shifting and redistributing material and creating new dense regions potentially suitable for low and high - mass star formation alike ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "it can also affect the average stellar mass , by dispersing or concentrating the local material needed for accretion , while increasing the total number of young stars of a given region ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "its effects on local star formation from winds and ( especially ) ionization ( e.g. , @xcite ) are , however , dependent on distance and environmental density , with its destructive effects being highly minimized in the densest environments ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "ultimately , feedback might regulate the global star formation process at a range of spatial scales through the input of turbulence ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) and a complicated balance between destructive ( e.g. , material dispersal ) and constructive effects ( e.g. , compression , material accumulation and creation of dense structures ; e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite and references therein ) .    based on our observations and the general theoretical predictions in the above studies",
    ", we suggest that stellar feedback from high - mass stars is currently the main factor distinguishing the observed differences in star formation between fields in the w3 gmc , disrupting the local environment and altering the characteristics , onset , and evolution of the star formation process in a given region .",
    "this effect can be inferred from table [ table : ysos_params ] , which summarises the environmental differences between w3 yso populations .",
    "here we used the @xmath10 and @xmath76 of the pixel in the _ herschel _  maps coincident with the yso coordinates as representative of the local conditions in which a given yso resides ( pixel size@xmath70.1pc ) .",

    "the triggering process that originated the hdl , in combination with the activity from the local high - mass stars in w3 , have therefore provided the denser ( and warmer ) conditions suitable for the onset of the most vigorous and richest stellar activity currently observed in the w3 gmc .    similarly ,",
    "comparison of the local differences between class 0/i and class ii ysos in a particular region ( @xmath84@xmath85 , or the change in local column density with time ) , can constrain possible environmental effects on yso evolution . assuming a total lifetime for the class 0/i ( + flat sed ) and class 0/i + class ii phases of @xmath86myr and @xmath87myr , respectively @xcite , then for co - eval evolution ( same age ) class ii ysos in the hdl could leave or have their environment disrupted ( e.g. , higher external activity ) up to @xmath88 times faster than in the western fields , whose class 0/i and class ii candidates co - exist in similar ( cool ) environments and comparable column densities . in a more conservative scenario in which class ii sources in the hdl are the oldest ( 2.9myr old ) class ii population in w3 ( while those in the western fields have just been formed ;",

    ", this apparently negative effect could result in the new stellar population in the proximity of the high - mass stars in the hdl being more numerous , albeit with overall lower masses than the more localized stellar population formed in the more quiescent western fields .",
    "the hdl has , however , a significant high - mass star population and massive clusters whose origin might also be linked to the ( in this case , constructive ) effects of triggering and external events ( paper i ) .",
    "below we summarize the observational evidence from this work supporting a feedback - driven model for the local evolution of regions within the w3 gmc .",
    "these results aim to introduce the basis of a scenario ( section  [ ssec : history ] ) in which evolution is intimately linked to the balance of constructive / destructive effects of the feedback mechanism , themselves highly dependent on local environmental density .",
    "w3 main/(oh ) is the only field with ongoing ( clustered ) high - mass star formation , despite the fact that the afgl 333 is also influenced by the activity in w4 .",
    "considering the effects of stellar feedback on star / structure formation , this intense star formation , as well as the other unique properties of the w3 main/(oh ) field , might ultimately be linked to its particularly high degree of stellar feedback from current stars within w3 on a quite local parsec scale ( a few arc minutes on figure  [ fig : fields ] ) , including but certainly not exclusively high - mass stars in ic 1795 and those powering w3 main .",
    "this appears to the dominant mechanism distinguishing the current state and evolution of the different fields .",
    "the key role of local high - mass stars acting already within the w3 complex , rather than external activity from w4 , for determining the current conditions of the star - forming material within dense environments is based on the following observations :    \\1 ) w3 main/(oh ) has more extreme environmental conditions , with a @xmath44 higher than that observed for afgl 333 .",
    "this would be inconsistent with the activity in w4 being a main factor determining the in - cloud state of the hdl , as the latter is closer ( in projection ) , and more heavily irradiated by , the high - mass stellar activity in w4 .",
    "we find that @xmath89 of the afgl 333 field is below the @xmath44 of w3 main/(oh ) , excluding the pillar east of the afgl 333 ridge ( yso group 7 ; @xcite ) , and iras 02245 + 6115 , an region associated with a b - type star ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",

    "this higher break selects the shell - like structures around ic 1795 , shaped by the central cluster and its ( parsec - scale ) feedback from local high - mass stars @xcite .",
    "in addition to gravitational effects , this pdf break could therefore be directly influenced by the magnitude of external / active processes .",
    "if dynamic ( e.g. , feedback ) processes are key for anomalously enhancing the amount of star - forming ( dense ) material in w3 , shifting the position of the pdf break , and driving the high - mass star / cluster formation itself ( as suggested in paper i ) , then this common link could , in addition , explain why : i ) w3 , a high - mass star - forming cloud , has a higher mass@xmath67 than any of the low - mass star - forming clouds in the sample of @xcite , and ii ) fields classified as high - mass star - forming regions have generally a higher @xmath0(sf )  than low - mass star - forming regions ( as observed in , e.g. , @xcite ) .      in the kr 140 field , material with @xmath66@xmath0(sf )",

    "the triggered - like origin of these structures is supported by the ( asymmetric ) distribution of their yso population @xcite , and column density and temperature profiles ( e.g. , asymmetric gradients ) . a profile example for the trilobite",
    "can be seen in figure [ fig : profile_kr140n ] .",
    "the comparison between the two western fields resembles that between afgl 333 and w3 main/(oh ) , albeit in a much smaller scale . a possible cluster in the central - southern parts of the western fields ( m. rahman , priv .",
    "comm . ) might have led to a period of enhanced feedback in the kr 140 field , resulting in higher feedback and a richer stellar content than in w3  nw ; e.g. , embedded clusters @xcite , various ( late ) b stars @xcite , and the only ( confirmed ) o - star ( ves 735 ) outside the hdl ( according to simbad ) .",
    "this affected the temperature distribution accordingly , with kr 140 having a much smaller proportion of  cold \" material in any given extinction range than the w3  nw field .",
    "the western fields therefore provide observational evidence of a radically different evolutionary path with respect to those in the eastern layer . based on their properties",

    "similarly , they also lack major sources of local internal feedback comparable to that of the hdl .",
    "indeed , compared to the hdl , the localized star formation and the much lower level of local feedback in the western fields could also explain the low @xmath44 of kr 140 and w3  nw as a whole , as well as the lack of a second break in their mass distributions .",

    "black vertical line marks the coordinate center ( solid line ) . ]",
    "arising from this work is compelling observational evidence of the dramatic effects that stellar feedback can have on the evolution of a cloud .",
    "initially , dense structures with conditions particularly favorable for new star formation can be created by local ( in - cloud ) or , in the case of the hdl , external feedback effects .",
    "these initial ( past ) conditions determine the properties of the first and subsequent episodes of star formation and associated local feedback events .",
    "the cumulative effects of this sequence of events will ultimately determine the general state of the region at the current epoch being observed .",
    "quantifying the balance between destructive / constructive effects of stellar feedback , influencing ( opposing or aiding ) known physical processes associated with star formation , such as self - gravity , accretion , and turbulence , is therefore fundamental for understanding the star formation process itself , from cloud to galactic scales .",
    "our _ herschel_-based results can be used as observational constraints to construct a coherent evolutionary model of the w3 gmc , and therefore of the conditions and processes that ultimately originate the exotic high - mass stars and clusters .",
    "past studies indicate that star formation in the western fields must have been initiated at the same time as ( if not before ) the hdl ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "results from the present work suggest , in addition , that the main difference between the evolution and properties of the structures and stellar population of the different fields might be the _ magnitude _ of the local stellar feedback occurring within those fields .",
    "this difference in feedback level can , however , itself be linked to the primordial amount of mass and mean density in these fields , and therefore the initial level of star - forming activity .",
    "a lower initial star formation efficiency ( sfe ) in a relatively low density medium would result in lower efficiencies for inducing star formation in secondary events , and a lower likelihood in compressing an already low column density medium to create structures dense enough for high - mass star formation .",
    "while this local compression might still result in few , relatively isolated , high - mass stars ( e.g. , kr 140 ) and some localized star formation @xcite , the limited secondary star formation and low environmental column densities ultimately restricted the star formation capability of the western fields to a relatively low level .",
    "the situation in kr 140 and w3  nw differs from the self - enhanced process in regions with initially enhanced column densities , like the hdl .",
    "such a set - up would promote an initially high sfe , resulting in more intense ( constructive ) compression and triggering events .",
    "when acting on an already dense environment , this process would lead to the formation of new high - mass stars , as well as a richer stellar population ( e.g. , @xcite ) . in turn , this population would then be more effective in further compressing and confining nearby material and therefore further enhancing the star formation activity",
    ".    our conclusions would agree with the results of @xcite , who found that embedded clusters in the w3 region are preferentially located in triggered regions .",
    "the evidence presented in this work also resembles the  fireworks hypothesis \" presented by @xcite . in that model ,",
    "the stellar feedback by high - mass stars triggers the formation of richer stellar populations , a self - propagating mechanism that can spread through the formation of new generations of high - mass stars when dense material is available . in w3 , we suggest that this process occurs not only due to the original prime conditions created by w4 ( i.e. , the hdl ) , but also due to the generations of high - mass stars themselves , which continue creating the conditions needed for the formation of new populations of low - mass and , especially , high - mass stars and massive clusters .    the mechanism that we invoke for high - mass star formation in dense environments , and more particularly , for w3 main , was first introduced in paper i. in our proposed scenario , stellar feedback creates new dense material , but the properties of the high - mass star population and subsequent triggering events , taking place within an already triggered and therefore density - enhanced region , ensures that the new dense structures are also ( high - mass ) star - forming ones .",
    "this is achieved in part due to the active process of mass assembly and confinement of the triggering mechanism , that allows for the continuation of the star - forming process .",
    "we note that this differs dramatically from the scenarios presented in theoretical models ( e.g. , @xcite ) . in these models feedback by o stars creates dense material , but this material is incapable of forming stars efficiently because it is expelled from the potential wells that facilitate collapse .",
    "similarly , stellar feedback has been predicted in some cases to lower the mass of the new stellar population by dispersing local material and disturbing accretion , ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "while more detailed simulations are required to test the specific scenario described here at sub - parsec scales , our observations suggest that the triggering conditions and the dense environments can enhance the availability of material and aid the accretion process .",
    "the combined effects would ultimately lead to the unique population of high - mass stars and clusters in w3 main .",
    "star formation in w3 main started and progressed independently from other regions ( @xcite ; @xcite ) . in the former ,",
    "star formation was subsequently enhanced by the on - going low - mass activity and the local ( but large scale - several parsec ) triggering effect from ic 1795 ( figure  [ fig : fields ] ; age @xmath97myr ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , itself created by the original superbubble activity in w4 ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "this process led to the first generation of high - mass stars in the shell around this cluster , which ultimately led to the onset of the convergent constructive feedback in w3 main ( paper i ) .",
    "a second break in the mass distributions is a property unique to the hdl fields . in this case , that of the w3 main/(oh ) field ( @xmath0(hb)@xmath98mag ) is observed to be at an @xmath0 twice that of afgl 333 .",
    "column densities above the @xmath0(hb ) breaks are associated exclusively with the two high - mass star - forming regions w3 ( oh ) and w3 main , and the afgl 333 ridge , the only one of the three without confirmed high - mass star formation .",
    "while a lack of high - mass stars in afgl 333 might be due to a younger age ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) , the fact that the mass in the afgl 333 ridge above its @xmath0(hb ) covers an area equivalent to the area above the same extinction in the three clumps in w3 main/(oh ) combined , suggests that the lower number of high - mass stars and their farther distance from the forming structure might have led to lower densities and a smaller degree of compression and confinement .",
    "we observe that all the structures traced by the @xmath0(hb ) contour coincide with those we identified in paper i as most likely associated with a dynamic input of material .",
    "when acting on a region with already enhanced column densities ( like the hdl or the shell around ic 1795 ) , boundary high - mass stars can be particularly efficient with sub - parsec triggering ( e.g. , afgl 333 and w3 main ) .",
    "if the second break in the pdf traces those structures associated with such dynamical processes ( feedback - dominated in the case of the w3 gmc , in addition to any additional gravitational inflow of material from the local neighborhood this amount of mass might ultimately induce ) , then this feature in the pdf could act as a signpost for locating structures with enough mass at high extinction for possible high - mass star formation .",
    "note , however , that having the potential for forming high - mass stars might not necessarily translate into actual high - mass star formation itself , as this might occur only under very specific conditions ( as discussed in paper i ) .",
    "similarly , the actual @xmath0 at which the second break occurs might vary from region to region , depending on factors such as local environment , strength , and direction of the triggering event ( e.g. , afgl 333 and w3 main ) .",
    "our results link the presence of a high - extinction break in the pdf with the effects of an external ( dynamic ) effect . based on our observations",
    ", stellar feedback appears to be the major dynamic process acting within and on w3 , which is the reason why feedback has been specifically mentioned and referred to in our discussion as the major driver in the evolution of w3 .",
    "this stellar feedback - based constructive process could also be applicable to other regions ( e.g. , @xcite ) . in more general terms , conclusions from this work in terms of high - mass star formation requirements",
    "would hold when stellar feedback is replaced or aided by other external events capable of recreating similar conditions",
    ". this would be in agreement with the conclusion from the hobys study of vela c by @xcite , who suggested that the flat part of their pdfs could be the result of constructive large scale flows . like the convergent constructive feedback mechanism introduced in paper i , convergence of flows could indeed also satisfy the requirement of an active input of material that in paper i we suggested could be the key to high - mass star and cluster formation .",
    "a study of the applicability of this scenario to other regions within the galaxy , and its associated observational evidence ( e.g. , pdfs ) , is currently the focus of ongoing work ( rivera - ingraham et al .",
    "2015 ; in prep . )",
    "the w3 gmc offers a unique opportunity to investigate the formation process in a variety of environments . in this second study of w3 with _",
    "herschel _ hobys data , we have aimed to create a coherent picture of the evolution of this gmc , analyze its large - scale properties and structure , and further constrain the high - mass star formation process as first described in paper i. this study has been carried out by means of a comparative analysis of the fields in w3 based on the properties derived from the _ herschel _ column density and temperature maps .",
    "the w3 main/(oh ) and afgl 333 fields show a second break in their mass distributions .",
    "this break appears to be related to the presence of external dynamic processes acting on the observed structures .",
    "since this influence is the suggested major mechanism for forming the most massive clusters of high - mass stars ( paper i ) , this break could act as an effective signpost for identifying regions suitable for possible high - mass star formation .",
    "the actual location of this break will depend on the local environmental conditions .",
    "while the first break of the pdf is expected to be influenced by various factors ( e.g. , gravity ) , we have presented evidence that dynamic processes such as external feedback can also be responsible for altering the location of this break .",
    "if such processes are major players in both shifting the break in the pdf and high - mass star formation itself ( paper i ) , then it could explain why high - mass star - forming regions have a tendency to have a higher break than low - mass star - forming regions , as observed in previous studies .",
    "the combined evidence provided by the yso population and the _ herschel _ datasets suggest that differences in the primordial local conditions are key for determining the evolution and current structural and stellar properties of each field .",
    "a high initial surface density , mass , and column density could allow for a higher initial sfe .",
    "the combination of a high sfe acting in an already high density region ( like the hdl ) , combined with the properties of triggering as a star formation process , could result in a self - enhancing process in which subsequent triggering events lead to an increase of the very structures suitable for further star formation .",
    "this picture is supported by the anomalously high proportion of star - forming material in w3 as traced by _",
    ", compared to other low - mass star - forming clouds .",
    "the same events could then lead to a richer population , a fireworks hypothesis as suggested by @xcite , as well as more massive stars .",
    "the particularly enhanced local large scale feedback observed for the w3 main/(oh ) field could therefore explain why this is the only field with significant high - mass star formation .",
    "the western fields on the other hand show only moderate stellar feedback . this state would be commonly associated with the quiet evolution of a cloud lacking the atypical conditions provided by w4 and the hdl , which have greatly enhanced the star - forming potential of the eastern regions of w3 .    the combined effectiveness of feedback and similar dynamic processes ( e.g. , constructive convergence of flows ) in 1 ) the creation of column density structures suitable for star formation ( as shown in this work ) , and 2 ) star formation itself ( as suggested in previous studies ) ,",
    "could then support the scenario where star formation progresses simultaneously with the formation of their parent structures .",
    "this process would translate into an increasing energy output ( luminosity ) of a star - forming structure ( e.g. , core / clump ) as the structure itself is assembled ( equivalent to a diagonal evolution in the l / m diagram ) .",

    "note that this type of ",
    "double - peaked \" pdf does not correspond to the ones observed in the vicinity of regions ( @xcite ; @xcite ) where the expansion of ionized gas into the molecular cloud leads to a compressed layer of gas that shows up in the column density pdf as a second peak at higher column densities .    while the effects on the pdf depend on the amount of ism correction required for a particular field ,",
    "this correction is most important and dominant at relatively low extinctions",
    ". this higher degree of uncertainty should be taken into consideration when analyzing those regions / structures with @xmath100mag .",

    "the kr 140 field , for instance , suffers from the greatest uncertainties due to it being severely affected by considerable foreground material traced by co , therefore requiring the largest correction of all fields in w3 .",
    "indeed , this field has the largest difference in total mass before and after ism correction ( a factor of 1.6 more mass in the uncorrected maps ) , and shows the largest discrepancies in terms of mass above @xmath0(sf )  ( @xmath105 less mass in the corrected mass for the same extinction level ; table [ table : sf_parameters_ism ] ) . the mean difference in mass above @xmath0(sf )  between corrected and uncorrected maps for the other fields",
    "is @xmath106% of the total corrected mass in each field , with the uncorrected maps always having more material than the corrected ones for any given extinction limit .",
    "this situation provides an upper limit to the mass uncertainties , as some correction for line - of - sight - material is required .",
    "moreover , when dealing with uncorrected images , the @xmath0(sf )  for each field should be higher than those derived from the ism - corrected pdfs . therefore , the difference between the total mass above @xmath0(sf )  for the uncorrected and corrected maps should be smaller than those quoted here .",
    "none of these uncertainties affect the conclusions from this study .",
    "similar to the interpretation of the break from the lognormal distribution in the pdf ( section  [ ssec : break ] ) , it has been suggested that the point at which a break occurs in the cmd at low extinction separates the turbulent environment from the gravity dominated structures ( @xmath0(sf ) ; @xcite ) .",
    "linear regimes in the cmds were first selected as those regions with slow varying gradient change , relative to those with significantly rapid change that should characterize a potential transition or break .",
    "these linear regimes were fitted in the cmds with a line function and a @xmath107 minimization routine .",
    "the final slopes and intercepts in table  [ table : fit_params ] are those of the linear fits that best represent the data neighbouring the regions of maximum gradient change ( closest to the breaks ) as well as the overall shape of the cmd . by fitting the separate extinction regimes of the @xmath33 of the cmds with straight lines ( e.g. , figures  [ fig : pdfs1 ] and [ fig : pdfs2 ] ) , these breaks can be identified as the points where linear fits of adjacent regions intersect .",
    "the sharper the transition between two regimes ( with only a small region of curvature joining adjacent linear - like regimes ) the better the constraint on the value of the break .",
    "considering the complexity of the pdf tails and the difficulty of fitting them assuming the typical power - law function , in this work we explored using the cmds and the straightforward linear fitting method described above as the primary approach for locating the breaks .",
    "because a cmd is just a cumulative form derived from a pdf , however , any physical break should be recognizable when using either of the two methods .    to check for consistency of breaks derived from the cmds with features observed in the pdfs",
    ", we transferred our best linear fits of the cmds ( @xmath108 vs.  @xmath0 ) to the form of the pdfs ( linear binning ) .",
    "this transfer was done numerically .",
    "quite generally , the fraction of material ( expressed here as a probability @xmath20 ) in a given region with extinction between @xmath109 and @xmath110 ( average @xmath0 ) is @xmath111 where @xmath112 is the plotted @xmath33 of the cmd at @xmath113 , @xmath114 is the constant relating mass per pixel to extinction ( section  [ sec : data ] ) , @xmath115 is the number of valid pixels in the field , and  bin \" is the linear bin size in @xmath0 used in the pdf .",
