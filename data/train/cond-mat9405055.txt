    "for example , gaas / alas quantum well wires grown on a vicinal surface using molecular  beam epitaxy ( mbe ) @xcite have two characteristic types of disorder .",
    "the interface between the gaas and the alas regions is not smooth and , in addition , within the region of nominally pure gaas , there will be islands of alas .",
    "the question of how compositional disorder affects the transport properties of quantum wires is important .",
    "the conductance of narrow ballistic channels , or quantum point contacts in a 2d electron gas ( 2deg ) is quantized in integer multiples of @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "however , this simple step  like form for the conductance as a function of the fermi energy , occurs when the transition between the wide leads and the narrow channel is adiabatic@xcite .",
    "nonadiabatic , _",
    "i.e.  _ mode - mixing transport through the constriction produces some additional features in the conductance diagram @xcite . the conditions for adiabatic transport are readily achieved in the experiments .",
    "disorder , however , can quite easily destroy conductance quantization .",
    "poor quantization is believed to be mainly caused by backscattering .",
    "backscattering , at low temperatures , is produced by the impurities within the wire and/or by the rough wire edge .",
    "it can also be caused indirectly through resonant states trapped in the wire , which may be created by the random field of impurities outside the wire @xcite .",
    "however , forward scattering does not generally harm the conductance quantization , if all conducting modes are fully occupied @xcite .",
    "small  angle backscattering predominates in the highest subbands and is usually considered responsible for the destruction of the conductance quantization . when only the lowest 1d subband is occupied , however , the number of states into which an electron can be scattered by disorder is reduced .",
    "this gave rise to the prediction of a large electron mobility in a confined electron system @xcite .",
    "however , the conductance is very strongly influenced by the quantum interference effects which start to emerge as elastic scattering is introduced in the ballistic regime . in the quasi1d case there is a much higher probability of multiple scattering from the same site compared to the 2d or 3d case .",
    "this could cause anderson localization to become dominant .",
    "the conductance fluctuations are expected to show peculiar behaviour in narrow quantum wires @xcite . in the metallic regime",
    "all the dimensions of a sample are much larger than the mean free path @xmath1 and the electron motion is well defined in all directions .",
    "hence , the perturbation theory approach based on feynman diagrams , which yields universal conductance fluctuations ( ucf ) , is valid .",
    "however , the transverse quantization in quantum wires gives well resolved 1d subbands if the width of the wire ( @xmath2 ) is smaller than the mean free path ( @xmath1 ) and comparable to the fermi wavelength @xmath3 .",
    "therefore , in general , ucfs are not expected in quantum wires with weak disorder . on the other hand we know that in the case of strong disorder when the wire length @xmath4 becomes greater than the localization length @xmath5 , subband mixing is very strong and any quasi1d feature of a perfect system is virtually destroyed @xcite .",
    "then it becomes essential to take localization effects into account .",
    "again , application of a perturbational method @xcite ) is inappropriate .",
    "here we examine the influence of rough boundaries ( section  [ conduc - rough ] ) , impurities ( section  [ conduc - islands ] ) , and both types of disorder combined ( section  [ conduc - real ] ) on the conductance and conductance fluctuations of quantum wires at zero temperature and zero magnetic field . all calculations were done using a landauer  type formula for the conductance .",
    "our calculations of the conductance , described below , require detailed structural information about the quantum wire . a direct way of describing such a system would be by providing detailed geometric and structural information about an actual wire .",
    "such data can be represented in a convenient form as a set of probability distributions and correlation functions of some basic parameters of the wire ( _ e.g .  _ the width , width fluctuations , confining potential etc )",
    ". the detailed structure can be recovered , in a statistical sense , by generating wires using an appropriate algorithm and the set of probability distributions and correlation functions as an input . in order to examine the electronic properties of some realistic structures we have used structural information obtained in the monte - carlo simulation of vicinal surface grown quantum well wires by hugill _",

    "the quasi  ballistic regime  the wire length is comparable with the mean free path length , @xmath88 ( _ e.g .  _",
    "@xmath79 for most of the energies and for the level of disorder assumed in our samples ) ; 2 .   the mesoscopic regime where the wire length is @xmath77 ( _ e.g .  _",
    "@xmath89 ) ; 3 .   the strong localization regime - @xmath90 ( _ e.g .  _",
    "@xmath83 ) .",
    "since the elastic mean free path and the localization length are both functions of energy , a particular wire can move between these regimes as the energy is changed .",
    "the fluctuations for the case @xmath79 in fig .",
    "[ g_reflc ] show interesting similarities with the density of states for the same type of quantum wires .",
    "there is a peak near the band edge which corresponds to the peak in the dos , which is the last remaining feature of the inverse square root singularities from the dos of clean quasi1d systems ( see ref .",
    "this behaviour can be explained in the following way . for short wires ( _ i.e .  _",
    "quasi  ballistic transport ) the important length is the elastic mean free path @xmath1 . if @xmath1 increases ( as a function of energy ) in the quasi ",
    "ballistic regime , then the conductance fluctuations decrease  as the scattering in the wire is reduced , and vice versa .",
    "since @xmath1 is roughly inversely proportional to the dos ( when the dos is increased the scattering rate increases and therefore @xmath1 decreases ) , then the conductance fluctuations might be expected to mirror the dos . as @xmath4 is increased with respect to @xmath1 ( and still @xmath91 )",
    "then the fluctuations will increase towards their maximal value , which is reached in the mesoscopic regime .",
    "the quantum wires of length @xmath89 in fig .  [ g_reflc ] show a relatively wide region of energy in which the conductance fluctuations are independent of energy , with a value which is close to the universal value for quasi1d systems ( @xmath92 @xcite ) .    for long wires ( @xmath83 )",
    "we have the strong localization regime and @xmath93 follows the curve for the localization length @xmath94 ( see fig .  [ g_reflc ] ) , _ i.e.  _ the average conductance , since these are related ( eq .",
    "[ eq : gexp ] ) . that @xmath95 and @xmath96 are proportional can be understood by using the picture of ` open ' and ` shut ' channels , or ` maximal fluctuations ' , in a quantum wire in the strong localization regime @xcite .",
    "this terminology is associated with the distribution function @xmath97 for the eigenvalues @xmath98 ( @xmath99 ) of @xmath100 , where @xmath101 is the transmission matrix : it has a peak at @xmath102 , and a tail which extends to @xmath103 @xcite .",
    "each eigenvector of @xmath104 defines a conducting ` micro  channel ' with the corresponding conductance @xmath98 in units of @xmath105 @xcite . as the size of the system",
    "is increased , the peak at @xmath102 strengthens at the expense of the tail , but the shape of the tail remains the same .    for long lengths , therefore , most of the micro  channels will have conductance of order 0 since the bulk of the distribution is around 0 .",
    "only a small fraction of the channels , with values for @xmath98 of order 1 ( roughly @xmath106 ) , will contribute to the conductance .",
    "such a distribution of @xmath98 , implies that the fluctuations tend to the maximum possible value consistent with their mean .",
    "however , the moments of the conductance , @xmath107 , for 2d and 3d cases do not show the same size dependence as the moments of @xmath108 , within the metallic regime .",

    "when localization effects are important , however , the correlations between the micro  channels change and a different sort of fluctuations is observed @xcite .",
    "the statistics of a single micro  channel were found to be crucial in the strong localization regime .",
    "the average conductance of the disordered quasi1d system shows an asymptotically exponential decrease with the length @xcite .",
    "this single parameter dependence suggests that the conductance statistics of quasi1d samples , with a length much longer than the localization length , is dominated by a single channel .",
    "hence a similar size dependence for the conductance moments should be expected as for @xmath109 , since the distribution of @xmath98s is important , rather than the correlation between them .",
    "this picture of the conductance statistics in the strong localization regime shows that the conductance fluctuations are proportional to the average conductance .    in fig .",

    "the presence of both types of disorder causes a further decrease of the conductance when compared with a wire with only one type of disorder .",
    "one can say that the influence of islands is dominant for energies near the band edge , whereas the influence of edge roughness becomes dominant towards the band centre .",
    "any feature of the conductance quantization for a single sample is quickly destroyed by the presence of both types of disorder .",
    "the conductance fluctuations for nearly ballistic samples ( @xmath79 ) have similar values to the fluctuations for the case of a real wire without islands , except for energies near the band edge .",
    "however , as the wire length increases the conductance fluctuations for a real wire with islands decreases faster then for the case without islands .",
    "this is because strong localization sets in sooner in the presence of islands .",
    "it was found in ref .",
    "@xcite that the localization length of real wires with islands is usually about half of the localization length of real wires without islands ( case of @xmath122 island concentration ) .",
    "the conductance fluctuations as a function of length behave like the conductance fluctuations for the case of a perfect wire with islands for energies near the band edge , but for higher energies they are similar to the case of real wires without islands .",
    "the characteristic coherent transport regimes ( quasi  ballistic , mesoscopic  @xmath77 and strong localization ) are each affected by disorder in a similar way . for boundary roughness",
    "the influence is weak near the band edge , and increases as the energy increases .",
    "however , the influence of the island disorder is strongest on the highest propagating modes and does not depend on the mode ( subband ) number . since the total conductance increases with the number of propagating modes , then , in general , the average conductance increases with the energy . but note that the average conductance , as a function of energy , always drops when a new subband opens due to the enhanced intersubband scattering",
    "this was not observed for the case of boundary roughness only .",
    "for the quasi  ballistic regime the conductance quantization deteriorates very rapidly as the number of scattering events increases .",
    "the average conductance decays exponentially as a function of wire length ( for @xmath90 ) , for any kind of disorder , which is considered as an additional confirmation of the exponential localization of electron states .",
    "anderson localization is very effective in reducing the carrier mobility in narrow quantum wires .",
    "this effect acts strongly against the predicted high mobility for quantum wires @xcite .",
    "the conductance fluctuations of narrow quantum wires depend , in general , on the length of the wire , and are therefore not universal conductance fluctuations ( ucf ) .",
    "however , the case with rough edges can show a universal region , but only for energies in the first subband .",
    "the value for @xmath95 is not far from the ucf value for metallic quasi1d systems ( @xmath133 ) and depends on the energy .",
    "an increase in the localization length extends this region of constant fluctuations .",
    "ando and tamura @xcite have predicted that for wider wires than we have , a much broader region of universal conductance fluctuations will appear .",
    "we find , on the contrary , that for island disorder short universal regions can exist only for higher energies and the actual value for @xmath95 approaches the ucf as the energy increases .",
    "the universal region , if it exists , appears for wires of length @xmath77 , and the fluctuations reach a maximum in this region .",
    "changing the cross  section of the leads makes no qualitative difference to the conductance of a system consisting of a disordered wire attached to two perfect leads @xcite .",
    "some small quantitative changes are observed only when @xmath134 ( which will be reported elsewhere ) . in any case",
    "the conductance becomes independent of @xmath135 when @xmath136 .",
    "this should be expected , since for large values of @xmath135 , transverse modes in the leads are densely distributed , and there are many of them contributing to the total conductance @xcite .      b. j. van wees , h. van houten , c. w. beenakker , j. g. williamson , l. p. kouwenhoven , d. van der marel and c. t. foxton , , 848 ( 1988 ) ; d. a. wharam , t. j. thornton , r. newbury , m. pepper , h. ahmed , j. e. f. frost , d. g. hasko , d. c. peacock , d. a. ritchie and g. a. c. jones , _ j.  phys . :  condens .",
