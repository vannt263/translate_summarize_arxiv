    "since the discovery of the sgr dwarf by ibata et al .",
    "( 1994 ) many groups ( e.g. , johnston , hernquist , & bolte 1996 , ibata et al .",
    "1997 , ibata & lewis 1998 , g ' omez - flechoso , fux , & martinet 1999 , johnston et al . 1999 ,",
    "helmi & white 2001 ) have sought to model the sgr - milky way interaction with respect to a modest patchwork of observational constraints .",
    "recently , majewski et al . ( 2003a , hereafter `` paper i '' ) have shown that the extensive length of the sgr tidal tails can be traced by m giant stars visible in the all - sky view of the system provided by the 2mass database .",
    "spectroscopy of sgr candidate stars has allowed determination of radial velocities throughout the trailing tail ( majewski et al .",
    "2003b , hereafter `` paper ii '' ) , and these substantial new constraints can be used to develop more refined models of the sgr system .    in this contribution , we briefly describe some of the major results of such modeling .",
    "a comprehensive description of this new sgr disruption model can be found in law , johnston , & majewski ( 2003 , hereafter `` paper iii '' ) .",
    "following previous work by johnston et al .",
    "( 1996 , 1999 ) the milky way potential is represented numerically by a miyamoto - nagai ( 1975 ) disk , hernquist spheroid , and a logarithmic halo .",
    "the total mass and radial profile are fixed by requiring that the rotation curve of this model galaxy be consistent with hi & co tangent point observations ( e.g. , honma & sofue 1997 ) .    the sgr dwarf itself is represented by @xmath0 self - gravitating particles ( representing both the dark and light matter components of the satellite ) , which are initially distributed according to a plummer ( 1911 ) model .",
    "this satellite is evolved through the simulated galactic potential for five orbital periods using a self - consistent field code ( hernquist & ostriker 1992 ) .",
    "the present - day simulated dwarf is constrained to be located at @xmath1 at a solar distance of @xmath2 kpc ( paper i , ibata et al .",
    "1995 ) and have a radial velocity of @xmath3 km s@xmath4 ( ibata et al .",
    "the direction of the dwarf s space velocity vector is determined by requiring that the dwarf orbit in the orbital plane observed in paper i.    subject to these requirements , test - particle orbits ( i.e. orbits calculated for a test particle with the observed kinematical characteristics of sgr ) and n - body simulations are performed for simulated satellites with a variety of orbital speeds .",
    "these simulations can be additionally constrained using the 2mass m giant distance and radial velocity data presented in papers i and ii .",
    "1 compares the m giant data ( panels a - b , filled squares ) with the model sgr dwarf whose tidal tails best reproduce the observations ( panels c - d ) .",
    "note the close agreement between model and observed debris distances and radial velocities along the trailing debris tail ( @xmath5 - @xmath6 ) .",
    "this best - fit model is characterized by a period of 0.75 gyr with apogalacticon 52 kpc , perigalacticon 14 kpc , and a present space velocity of @xmath7 km s@xmath4 .",
    "although we do not attempt to model the sgr core in detail , it is nonetheless possible to use the width of the sgr debris stream to estimate such global characteristics as the bound mass of the dwarf . the simulated dwarf which appears to best fit the width of streams shown in fig .",
    "1 has a present mass of @xmath8 and a mass - to - light ratio @xmath9 .",
    "as demonstrated in the previous section , the tidal tails of this model provide a good fit to the all - sky view of m giants presented in papers i and ii .",
    "it is therefore possible to use this model to determine what range of milky way models permit simulated satellites to reproduce observations .",
    "particularly , n - body simulations can be used to constrain the flattening of the galactic halo ( e.g. , ibata et al .",
    "fitting an orbital plane to leading and trailing m giant debris separately , we determine that the orbital pole of sgr debris has precessed by @xmath10 over about @xmath11 of orbital longitude . repeating this calculation for n - body simulations in model dark halos with a variety of flattenings , we calculate pole precessions of @xmath12 , @xmath13 , and @xmath14 for flattenings in the halo potential of @xmath15 , and @xmath16 respectively .",
    "it therefore appears likely that the halo of the milky way can be described by an almost spherical potential .",
    "although this model provides a good match to the distances and velocities of trailing sgr debris given in papers i and ii , it does not fit recent data obtained by majewski et al .",
    "( 2003c , hereafter `` paper iv '' ) in the region of the sgr leading arm . fig .",
    "1 ( panel a , filled triangles ) plots these new data , which has velocities slower than that of the model by up to 200 km s@xmath4 in the range @xmath17 - @xmath18 . there is no simple modification of the velocity of the model satellite that serves to reproduce this new trend , and this may be an indication of such other effects as dynamical friction .",
    "however , simulations suggest that including corrections from chandrasekhar s formulation of dynamical friction should not have a substantial effect on the observed velocities of leading tidal debris for model satellites with mass @xmath19 , and we find that accurately reproducing the observed trend is difficult even for satellites with initial masses greater than this",
