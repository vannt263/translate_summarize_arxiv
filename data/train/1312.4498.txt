    "micro and nowadays nano - mechanical systems ( mems and nems ) are of current interest due to their broad field of scientific and technical applications . _",
    "all devices _ ( and evidently not only mechanical ones ) present a non - linear behavior at large drives , and a large panel of scientists from different communities is dealing today with non - linear mechanics @xcite .    from an engineer s point of view",
    ", non - linearity is a key design parameter .",
    "when used in the linear regime , non - linearity limits the dynamic range of a device @xcite .",
    "one can also exploit non - linearity with for instance frequency mixing @xcite , synchronization @xcite , amplification using bifurcation points @xcite , suppression of amplifier noise in oscillator circuits @xcite , and mass ( homodyne ) detection @xcite .",
    "moreover , the non - linear component proves to be essential to complex , useful and efficient designs , with for instance the diode in conventional electronics and the josephson junction in superconducting circuitry @xcite .    from a physicist s point of view , a mems / nems with a canonical non - linearity is a close realization of the _ duffing oscillator _ , a mechanical system with a spring force containing a term @xmath0 ( @xmath1 displacement ) .",
    "it is of ubiquitous interest in physics since many systems can be mapped on this problem @xcite .",
    "it also provides a simple mathematical model which is in many cases _ analytically _ solvable .",
    "furthermore , the simple duffing expression enables the theoretic and , with the mems / nems close implementation , the _ model experimental _ study of subtle dynamic properties like dynamical switching @xcite and memory effects @xcite .    due to the fundamental issue behind non - linear dynamics ( the physics of chaos @xcite ) and the broad panel of applications in micro / nano mechanics , which can even be extended to the _ quantum - limited _ nano - mechanical device @xcite , it is important to understand the _ nature _ of these mechanical non - linearities @xcite .",
    "the most commonly discussed cases are non - linear actuation with an electrostatic drive @xcite , and non - linear constituents ( with i.e. an @xmath2 term in the damping @xcite ) .",
    "clever designs making use of these non - linearities enable parametric amplification @xcite , and parametric drive @xcite .",
    "in particular , non - linear dampings @xcite permit the realization of a mechanical _ van der pol _",
    "oscillator @xcite .",
    "furthermore , even with perfectly _ elastic _ constituents ( young modulus and damping independent of strain / stress ) , mechanical devices do present a non - linear behavior which is effectively captured by the duffing model .",
    "this non - linearity is of pure _ geometrical _ origin @xcite , and in its most general form it will contain other terms in the dynamics equation in addition to the cubic restoring force , with a straightforward second - order force @xmath3 @xcite , and less intuitively _ inertia _ non - linear terms @xcite . to put it in crude words ,",
    "the duffing equation is , even for these perfectly elastic devices , only a convenient model describing correctly the measurements . in practice a mechanical device _ is certainly not _ a duffing oscillator .",
    "however in practice , most of the theoretical and experimental work has been done around the duffing problem ( e.g. @xcite ) , with most of the experiments done in the _ driven _ regime ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the reason behind this fact is certainly simplicity . theoretically , the full non - linear problem is extremely complex while a simple duffing modeling does capture the observed mechanical behavior .",
    "experimentally , the driven regime is easier to handle since it uses the natural amplification of the system through its @xmath4 factor .",

    "this system is usually reduced to a one dimensional problem by a galrkin - type procedure or a normal mode expansion of the linearized problem @xcite . for beams ,",
    "most of the recent work is based on the formulation of crespo da silva and glynn @xcite . in the case of thin and long beams and planar motion , extended non - linear euler - bernouilli equations",
    "are available @xcite .",
    "the classical procedure is to compute the response of a system from crespo da silva - like equations , and since even the reduced analytic writing is very complex the final step is performed numerically @xcite . in these works ,",
    "the aim is to _ predict the dynamic behavior _ of a particular device from its mechanical characteristics , the final product being a numerical curve plotted on experimental points proving good agreement . here",
    ", we adopt a radically different approach inspired from low temperature physics .",
    "our aim is to predict _ the analytical shape of the most generic dynamics equation _ for an ideally elastic non - linear mechanical device that has been reduced to a single degree of freedom .",
    "this equation shall contain a number of non - linear coefficients , each of which having a well defined meaning .",
    "but we shall _ not _ compute these coefficients , and leave them as characteristics of the devices that have to be obtained by other means .",
    "we present the exact analytical solutions of the full dynamics equation in two relevant experimental cases : harmonic drive and free decay .",
    "we demonstrate on simple cantilever mems devices that these expressions can be used to _",
    "fit experimental data _ and extract non - linear parameters .",
    "the strength of our new approach lies in _ its completely generic nature , and purely analytic formulation_.",
    "we present measurements on perfectly elastic cantilever - based mems devices extending deeply in the non - linear regime of their first resonant mode .",
    "two techniques are used : a frequency - sweep technique where the device is continuously driven with a harmonic force @xmath9 , and a time - decay method where the oscillator is suddenly released with an initial displacement / velocity ( signal recorded under @xmath10 ) . note that beyond the linear regime , the two measurements _ are not _ the fourier transform of each other anymore .",

    "it consists of two micro - mechanical goal - post silicon structures @xcite ( hereafter called big and small ) embedded one in the other .",
    "each structure is made of two cantilevers ( feet of length @xmath11 ) linked by a paddle of length @xmath12 .",
    "the measurements are performed using the magnetomotive scheme .",
    "the low temperature condition ( 4.2@xmath8k ) is a practical means to use moderately high magnetic fields , cryogenic vacuum ( @xmath13 mbar ) , and obtain low electrical noise .",
    "a static magnetic field @xmath14 is imposed along the sample while a current @xmath15 is fed through the thin ( non - superconducting ) metallic layer that covers it . a time - dependent laplace force of amplitude @xmath16 acts on each structure driving it out of the plane .",
    "their motion induces in turn a voltage @xmath17 proportional to the velocity @xmath18 of the paddles ( lenz s law ) .",
    "note that for our devices , the driving force @xmath19 is ideally linear , as opposed to electrostatic actuation @xcite .",
    "the detected signal however is weakly non - linear at large bendings , but this effect can be proven to be negligible @xcite .",
    "the double - structure design enables the simultaneous study of two very different oscillators , with very different resonance frequencies .",
    "no relevant mechanical coupling between the two could be detected , even deeply in the non - linear regime , meaning that the resonance peaks are perfectly well separated .",
    "however , the structures are electrically coupled because of their parallel wiring .",
    "the drive current splits in two according to the electric resistance @xmath20,@xmath21 of each structure , while the detected voltage is reduced by the same proportion ( kirchhoff s rules ) . the ratio of these resistances measured experimentally follows accurately the geometrical dimensions of the structures .",
    "moreover , the induced voltage that we detect ( proportional to @xmath22 ) generates in turn a loop current through the total resistance @xmath23 .",
    "this effect ( which opposes the driving force ) has to be taken into account for large magnetic fields .",
    "careful calibration of the setup enables the definition of _ absolute _ displacements @xmath1 of the paddle in @xmath24 m , and applied forces @xmath19 in pn , quoted here in _",
