    "the measurement of the exclusive semileptonic decay @xmath4 can be used to determine de cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) matrix element @xmath5 . with no flavor symmetry constraining the hadronic matrix elements , the errors on @xmath5",
    "are currently dominated by theoretical uncertainties , being a determination of @xmath5 , with well understood uncertainties , a priority of heavy flavor physics .",
    "the application of watson s theorem to the @xmath6 semileptonic decay allows one to write a dispersion relation for each of the form factors entering in the hadronic matrix element .",
    "this leads to the so - called omns representation , which can be used to constrain the @xmath2 dependence of the form factors assuming some knowledge of the elastic @xmath7 scattering amplitudes .",
    "the use of multiple subtractions will allow to combine predictions from various methods in different @xmath2 regions . in this talk",
    ", we show how this omns scheme can be used to combine the results at @xmath8 of the relevant hadron @xmath9 form factors from light cone sum rules ( lcsr ) calculations , with those obtained from a simple nonrelativistic constituent quark model ( nrcqm ) in its region of applicability , near zero recoil . in this way we end up , with an accurate description of the differential decay rate , except for @xmath10 , in the whole physically accessible @xmath2 range .",
    "we also use a monte carlo simulation to estimate the theoretical error bands of our procedure .",
    "the hadronic matrix element for @xmath11 can be parametrized in terms of two dimensionless form factors , @xmath12 and @xmath13 , of which only @xmath12 contributes for massless final leptons .    in figure  [ fig1 ]",
    "we show under `` @xmath14 '' the nrcqm prediction for @xmath12 when considering only the valence quark contribution .",
    "the description fails in the whole @xmath2 range : from the region close to @xmath15 , where a nonrelativistic model should work best , to the opposite end where the pion is ultrarelativistic and thus predictions from a nonrelativistic scheme are unreliable . as first pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite , near zero recoil the @xmath16 decay is dominated by the effects of the @xmath1 resonance , which is quite close to @xmath15 .",
    "these effects of the @xmath1 resonance must be added as a distinct coherent contribution .",
    "we have consistently evaluated within our model the @xmath1 resonance contribution to the @xmath12 form factor ( see ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein for details ) .",
    "the result is that the @xmath1 resonance plays a role only near @xmath17 , being strongly suppressed by a soft hadronic vertex outside that region .",
    "the inclusion of the @xmath1 resonance contribution to the form factor ( @xmath18 in the figure ) improves the simple valence quark contribution down to values around @xmath19 gev@xmath20 .",
    "below that the description is still poor .",
    "we have now used the omns representation to combine the nrcqm predictions at high @xmath2 with the lcsr result at @xmath8 .",
    "this representation requires as an input the elastic @xmath7 phase shift @xmath21 in the @xmath22 and isospin @xmath23 channel plus the form factor at different @xmath2 values below the @xmath24 threshold where we will perform the subtractions . with a large enough number of subtractions only the phase shift at or near threshold",
    "is needed .",
    "we can then approximate @xmath25 ( levinson s theorem ) which renders our calculation analytic .    in figure  [ fig3 ]",
    "we show with a solid line the form factor obtained using the omns representation .",
    "we have used as subtraction points five @xmath2 values between @xmath26 gev@xmath20 and @xmath15 , for which the nrcqm predictions ( valence+pole ) have been used , plus the lcsr prediction at @xmath8 .",
    "we have paid special attention to the estimation of theoretical uncertainties that come from two main sources : ( i ) uncertainties in the quark ",
    "antiquark nonrelativistic interaction and ( ii ) uncertainties on the @xmath27 $ ] product and on the input to the multiply subtracted omns representation . as a result",
    ", we obtain the @xmath28 confidence level region enclosed between @xmath29 lines .",
    "see ref .",
    "@xcite for details .",
    "comparing with the experimental decay width , we obtain @xmath30 in good agreement with a recent experimental determination by the cleo collaboration  @xcite .",
