    "since 2010 attosecond transient absorption spectroscopy ( atas ) has been used to study electronic dynamics in atoms on the attosecond time scale @xcite . during propagation through a target region affected by an infrared ( ir ) or a near - infrared ( nir ) pulse ,",
    "the spectral profile of the attosecond pulse is modified .",
    "after propagation the intensity spectrum is recorded to measure the accumulated modification .",
    "this spectrum depends on the relative phase between the attosecond pulse and the nir / ir pulse and therefore on the time delay between the two pulses .",
    "indirect temporal information about the response of the target to the nir / ir field is therefore obtained from the delay - dependent intensity spectrum .",
    "the spectral profile of the attosecond pulse is in the extreme ultraviolet ( xuv ) regime .",
    "the intensity of the xuv pulse is low , and only processes involving a single xuv photon are non - negligible .",
    "the intensity of the nir / ir pulse is in a regime where few - photon processes occur , but the intensity is too low to give rise to a signal in the xuv regime of interest .    of particular interest in atas is the time interval where the xuv and the nir / ir pulses overlap . in this region",
    "a number of spectral features arise in the spectrum as a consequence of non - linear coupling between the system and the two fields @xcite . here",
    "we focus on light - induced structures ( liss ) .",
    "liss are signatures of non - linear processes transferring population from the ground state to a state of the same parity ( a dark state ) by absorbing an xuv photon and absorbing or emitting a nir / ir photon . in atomic systems",
    "liss are therefore seen in atas spectra as pairs with each individual absorption feature located one nir / ir photon energy above ( emission of nir photon ) or below ( absorption of nir photon ) the dark state energies .",
    "the spectral width of an atomic lis is inversely proportional to the duration of the nir /",
    "ir pulse and since this pulse is often almost as long as the natural damping of the system , liss appear as relatively narrow features in the atas spectrum @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite it was shown that molecular atas spectra are to a large extend determined by molecular vibrations , and the results indicated that liss at well - defined energies are not a general molecular property .",
    "it is therefore of interest to make a careful investigation of how the liss are affected by nuclear motion .",
    "it turns out that molecular liss are extremely sensitive to the the type of nuclear dynamics supported by the electronic dark state born - oppenheimer ( bo ) curve .",
    "liss therefore lend themselves to a study of nuclear dynamics in a new setting and they form a possibility to study the combined nuclear and electronic dynamics in the otherwise hidden dark states . the main purpose of this work is to give a more complete description of liss in molecules , and show how liss can be used to classify molecular processes .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",

    "liss found in atas spectra are a consequence of the nir / ir coupling between an excited state of parity opposite from the ground state ( bright state ) and an excited state with the same parity as the ground state ; the dark state .",
    "the latter state is refereed to as a dark state since the transition from the ground state to this state is dipole forbidden and there are therefore no spectral features in the dipole response corresponding to the energy difference between dark states and the ground state . consequently these states are not observed in one - photon spectroscopy . in ref .",

    "it is assumed that the electronic dipole moment function @xmath47 is a slowly varying function of @xmath30 and therefore can be evaluated at @xmath48 .",
    "this is usually a good approximation for atas calculations ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) . inserting eq .   into eq",
    ".   shows that the energies @xmath49 disappear in the final expression for the time - dependent dipole moment , leaving terms oscillating with frequencies @xmath50 .",
    "the distribution and population of vibrational states corresponding to the bright electronic state @xmath51 does therefore not affect the dephasing of the dipole moment responsible for liss .",
    "the distribution and population of vibrational states corresponding to the dark electronic state @xmath52 are , on the other hand , crucial for the nature of liss .",
    "the more dark vibrational states that are populated , the faster the resulting dipole moment will dephase . even in the situation where a finite number of discrete vibrational states are populated , and one would expect a partial revival of the time - dependent dipole moment , the revival is often absent due to the finite duration of the nir pulse . we therefore expect liss with well - defined energies to be suppressed in the molecular atas spectrum when more than a few vibrational dark states are populated .",

    "[ fig2](c ) we observe that the removal of the highest excited dark state causes a drastic reduction in the @xmath74 oscillations in the absorption lines at @xmath59 ev and @xmath60 ev .",
    "these oscillations are a result of which - way interference , and we therefore conclude that the dark state is essential in the coupling of the two bright states which is also anticipated from , e.g. , second - order perturbation theory .",

    "from these equations we were able to conclude that liss would be broadened if more dark vibrational states were populated since this leads to a dephasing of the part of the time - dependent dipole moment responsible for liss .",
    "based on the frank - condon principle we expect that the nuclear wave function , excited to a dark state bo curve , will initially be localized around @xmath55 , but since all dark states in @xmath0 are dissociative , all the corresponding vibrational states are nuclear - continuum states .",
    "an expansion of the nuclear wave packet in vibrational dark states will therefore in principle require an infinite number of dark vibrational states . as a result",
    "we expect that the corresponding dipole signal will be damped on a very short time scale leading to extremely broad spectral features .",
    "how broad the liss are depends on the distribution of vibrational dark states populated by the combined xuv and nir pulses and therefore on the slope of the corresponding bo curve .      in many situations",

    "we see a continuous change in the molecular liss from narrow to defuse , when more and more vibrational dark states are needed in the expansion of the nuclear wave function of the ground state .",
    "the impact of nuclear motion can therefore be divided into characteristic categories including single - line molecular liss when the expectation value of the internuclear separation on the dark state curve @xmath99 is constant in time and defuse liss when the dark state curve is dissociative .",
    "in addition to the results shown in the present work , we have performed calculations on the 3d @xmath100 model of ref .",
    "it was , however , difficult to unambiguously identify liss in the spectra .",
    "there are several reasons for this .",
    "first , the only dark state curve ( ef ) in the energy range of interest is very different from the ground state curve ( x ) ( for information about the bo curves in h@xmath101 see ref .",
    "the ground state curve is a single - minimum curve with a minimum at @xmath102 while the dark state ef curve has two minima at @xmath103 and @xmath104 , respectively . as a consequence",
    "the overlap between vibrational ground states of the two bo curves are much smaller than one , and we expect the corresponding liss to be very diffuse .",
    "in contrast to the atas spectra of this paper , the spectra of h@xmath101 are very rich in structures ( see fig .",
    "( 5 ) in ref .",
    "two bright state bo curves ( b and c ) are located in the energy range where we expect to see liss and as a consequence it is nearly impossible to distinguish liss from , e.g. , which - way interference phenomena . to see clear liss the dipole matrix elements between the ground state and a bright state and between this bright state and a dark state",
    "should both be large [ see eqs .   and ]",
    "compared to dipole matrix elements describing processes responsible for other spectral features in the energy region of the liss . in h@xmath101 unambiguous identification of liss",
    "is hindered by which - way interference between vibrational states of the b and c curves since the dipole matrix elements are almost ideal for this process .",
    "tuning the coupling strengths of the system as outlined above , to circumvent the difficulties of h@xmath101 , we observe liss behaving very similarly to what we saw in sec .  [ res ] .",
    "we therefore expect that also in experiments liss may in many cases be observed and used to divide nuclear dynamics on dark bo curves into categories : stationary when single - line liss are observed , small amplitude oscillations when horizontal few - line liss are observed and large amplitude oscillations or dissociative behavior when diffuse liss are observed .",
