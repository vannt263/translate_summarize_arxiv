    "sterile neutrinos from extra dimensions are not likely to play a primary role in atmospheric and solar neutrinos  @xcite . on the contrary ,",
    "astrophysics , cosmology and rare decays still represent natural stages for their exotic performances . in this paper",
    ", we focus on the implications of a possible mixing of the electron neutrino with a kaluza - klein ( kk ) tower of sterile neutrinos in supernova ( sn ) physics .    the potential relevance of bulk fermions for neutrino physics has first been pointed out and analyzed in  @xcite .",
    "fermions propagating in large extra dimensions appear as light , dense kk towers of sterile neutrinos in 4 dimensions , possibly mixing with the standard model ones . in turn , the existence of extra dimensions much larger than the inverse electroweak scale is natural in string inspired models with a fundamental scale in the tev range  @xcite , if the standard relation between that scale and the planck scale is implemented .",
    "the basic ideas about supernova explosion and cooling , nicely confirmed by the neutrino signal from sn 1987a  @xcite , translate into significant constraints on the energy loss through invisible channels  @xcite .",
    "in fact , in order for the observed neutrino signal to be accounted for , the invisible energy loss should not cool the protoneutron star on a time scale shorter than about 10 seconds .",
    "the bulk of a large extra dimension provides at least two interesting examples of invisible channel : kk graviton emission  @xcite and mixing of standard model and bulk neutrinos , the possibility we are interested in . with respect to the case of a single sterile neutrino  @xcite , conversion into kk towers of sterile neutrinos is enhanced by the higher number of available states and especially by matter effects  @xcite .",
    "the constraints that follow on the parameter space of bulk neutrino models look at first sight quite severe  @xcite .",
    "however , those constraints are relaxed by an interesting feedback mechanism that prevents unacceptable energy loss  @xcite and affects the protoneutron star deleptonization and cooling through a non trivial interplay with diffusion . by suppressing the neutrino msw potential and then making it negative everywhere",
    ", the mechanism leads to a self - limiting of the potentially dangerous , msw - enhanced , energy loss into the bulk and requires a revisitation of the bounds in the literature .",
    "the consequences for sn physics , in particular explosion , deleptonization , cooling and spectra , are not less interesting . from this point of view what we discuss here",
    "is an example of how the standard ideas about the protoneutron star evolution can be affected in presence of new physics in an unexpected and intriguing way .",
    "the paper is structured as follows . in section  [ sec : framework ] we shortly review the salient points about ( electron ) neutrino oscillations into bulk neutrinos . section  [ sec : main ] is the central part of the paper .",
    "since a reliable study requires taking into account diffusion , we first set up in section  [ sec : assumptions ] a toy model of the protoneutron star core which , although minimal , contains all the neutrino transport physics relevant to our discussion . in section",
    "[ sec : loss ] we incorporate in the model the effect of electron neutrino and antineutrino conversion into bulk neutrinos .",
    "the effect on the evolution of the protoneutron star core is described in section  [ sec : evolution ] .",
    "the consistency with sn 1987a   is shown in section  [ sec : implications ] , where the implications for the neutrino luminosity , the flux spectrum and the shock reheating are also discussed .",
    "section  [ sec : subleading ] summarizes the constraints on subleading non self - limiting conversion probabilities , that provide one of the relevant bounds on our parameter space .",
    "we conclude in section  [ sec : summary ] .",
    "before embarking in the detailed analysis , let us shortly and qualitatively review the standard ideas about sn explosion and cooling  @xcite .",
    "type ii supernovae originate from evolved , massive stars whose iron core reaches the chandrasekhar limit and collapses under gravitational pressure . during the collapse ,",
    "neutrinos start to be produced by electron capture and get trapped when densities of order @xmath0 are reached . the inner part of the iron core has an homologous collapse that stops when , after a fraction of a second , stiff nuclear densities of order @xmath1 are reached .",
    "the free falling outer material then builds up a shock that propagates outwards .",
    "it is believed that this `` prompt '' shock has not enough energy to give rise to a successful explosion and hence stalls after @xmath2 at a radius of order @xmath3 . below the shock",
    ", the protoneutron star has a high density inner part , the inner core , with a radius of 1030@xmath4 and a bloated outer part , the mantle , that accretes mass falling through the shock .",
    "let us leave for a moment the shock to its uncertain fate and follow the evolution of the protoneutron star below it .",
    "most of the gravitational binding energy of the progenitor star , a few @xmath5 , is stored there . only @xmath6 out of that will go into explosion kinetic energy or electromagnetic radiation .",
    "most of it will be released through neutrino emission in a few tens of seconds .",
    "the stiff inner core has a mass of order of the solar mass , @xmath7 , a density of order @xmath8 , a temperature of 1030@xmath9 and a lepton fraction per baryon @xmath10 .",
    "electrons and electron neutrinos are highly degenerate in such conditions , with fermi momenta of order 300 and 200@xmath9 respectively .",
    "the mean free path of a @xmath11 neutrino is @xmath12 .",
    "this determines the time scale for neutrino diffusion and emission : @xmath13 for a neutrino at a depth @xmath14 in the inner core .",
    "analogously , the total neutrino flux and spectrum can be roughly estimated from the knowledge of the star structure and temperature where neutrinos experience their last energy exchange .",
    "the mantle looses most of its lepton number , accretes most of its mass , cools and contracts in only 0.51@xmath15 . then , as it cools , the whole protoneutron star slowly contracts to a radius of order @xmath16 .",
    "after a few tens of seconds , we are left with a proper neutron star .    since supernovae",
    "do explode , we can be confident that the shock has in the meanwhile successfully expelled the outer matter .",
    "an important contribution to the revival of the stalled shock is given by the energy deposition of the neutrino flow . a @xmath6 fraction of the energy flowing might be enough to give rise to a sufficiently energetic explosion a second or so after collapse .",
    "critical are of course the efficiency of the energy transfer mechanism and the intensity of the neutrino source .",
    "although this `` delayed shock '' mechanism is currently believed to play an important role , reproducing the explosion in computer simulations it is still non trivial at present  @xcite .",
    "this does not necessarily mean that something is missing in our general understanding .",
    "the problem is likely to originate from the complexity of the system to be modeled and the variety of the physics involved .",
    "it may just be necessary to turn to full 3d simulations able to account for non - spherically symmetric effects .",
    "convection is likely to be important in this context , since it may boost the neutrino luminosity  .",
    "moreover , the neutrino energy deposition in what was the prompt shock is likely to be just one of the several effects giving rise to the explosion  @xcite and the outcome critically depends on a number of poorly known variables like the progenitor structure , the equation of state , the details of neutrino transport , etc .",
    "we also note that a purely neutrino driven explosion is not obviously reconciliable with the indications of a non - spherical mechanism @xcite  .",
    "still , it is worth pointing out that the new physics and mechanism we discuss in this paper might also play an important role by enhancing the neutrino luminosity .",
    "this will be discussed in section  [ sec : implications ] .",
    "the basic ideas about protoneutron star deleptonization and cooling have been nicely confirmed by the observation of a neutrino signal in the superkamiokande and imb detectors in coincidence with sn 1987a  @xcite . despite the low statistics ,",
    "there is definitely a significant agreement between the measured neutrino flux duration and intensity and the estimates above .",
    "this allows to set limits on drastic departures from the described picture , in particular on invisible energy loss channels that would waste the available energy on timescales shorter than @xmath17 .",
    "we consider a kaluza - klein ( kk ) tower of sterile neutrinos living in the bulk of a single , large , flat , gravitational extra dimension .",
    "additional smaller dimensions will be in general present .",
    "what we consider is therefore an effective theory valid up to scales below the inverse scales of the smaller dimensions .",
    "the physics we are interested in involves bulk neutrinos with masses within @xmath18 .",
    "we therefore assume that the inverse scale of the additional smaller dimension is larger than @xmath19 and neglect them in the following .    as for the size @xmath20 of the extra dimension we consider ,",
    "we only require it to be in the range @xmath21 the lower bound comes from tests of the newton s law at small distances in eq .",
    "( [ eq : mixing ] ) below , it may be necessary to strengthen the lower bound to @xmath22 in order to avoid undesired effects in solar and atmospheric neutrino experiments .",
    "in fact , for @xmath23 , the first modes of the kk tower may participate to oscillations if their masses are given by @xmath24 , @xmath25 .",
    "this is not the case in presence of a dirac or majorana bulk mass @xmath26 , since in this case all bulk neutrinos are heavier than @xmath26  @xcite .",
    "values of @xmath27 as low as @xmath28 would then be automatically compatible with not having effects in the observed oscillation signals .",
    "provided that @xmath29 , such a mass term would not affect sn physics .",
    "] and the origin of the upper bound , as well as the bounds below , will become clear by the end of the section .",
    "apart from @xmath20 , which gives their density of states , all we need to know about bulk neutrinos is their mixing with the electron neutrino .",
    "we assume that the mixing @xmath30 of @xmath31 with the ( almost ) sterile @xmath32-th mass eigenstate @xmath33 is inversely proportional to its mass @xmath34 , @xmath35 a generic feature of most models in the literature  @xcite .",
    "( [ eq : mixing ] ) defines the mixing parameter @xmath36 . on @xmath27",
    "may depend on the specific model .",
    "we only assume the density of states @xmath37 to be @xmath20 at scales around @xmath38 .",
    "the parameter @xmath36 usually originates from yukawa interactions involving the 5d neutrino , the lepton doublet and an higgs field . ]",
    "we are interested in a range for @xmath36 such that @xmath39 , which ensures that all mixings @xmath30 are small , and @xmath40 the parameter @xmath41 sets the scale of all the effects we discuss .",
    "the upper bound ensures the smallness of the transition probabilities over a mean free path and values of @xmath41 smaller than the lower bound give unobservable effects . the range in eq .",
    "( [ eq : mmrrange ] ) is further restricted by the expectation that subleading contributions to the oscillation probability give rise to the bound @xmath42 , as we will discuss in section  [ sec : subleading ] .",
    "together with the upper bound on @xmath27 , the latter gives @xmath43 .",
    "we will therefore concentrate on the first four orders of magnitude of the range  ( [ eq : mmrrange ] ) .",
    "for appropriate sizes of the volume associated to the smaller dimensions , all values of @xmath27 , @xmath41 in the ranges above are consistent with the relation @xmath44 between the volume of the extra space with the 4d planck mass , for appropriate sizes of the smaller dimensions . at the same time , those values are compatible with cosmological and astrophysical bounds from kk graviton production before big - bang nucleosyntesis  @xcite and in supernovae  @xcite .",
    "having described the neutrino parameter space , we now discuss neutrino oscillations in the inner core of the protoneutron star .",
    "oscillations are dominated by matter effects . while bulk neutrinos are sterile and therefore unaffected by matter , the electron neutrinos acquire an effective squared mass @xmath45 , where @xmath46 is the msw matter potential",
    ", @xmath47 is the baryon number density and @xmath48 is the number fraction of @xmath49 , @xmath31 per baryon .",
    "more precisely , @xmath50 denotes the difference of the particle and antiparticle number densities . also , we denote by @xmath51 the total lepton fraction @xmath52 .",
    "the neutrino contribution to @xmath53 is important in the inner core . also important",
    "is the negative contribution from neutrons , that allows the potential to have both signs , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : v ] . according to the sign of the potential , matter effects will enhance neutrino or antineutrino disappearance in the bulk .",
    "the msw potential ranges between @xmath54 and @xmath55 . correspondingly , in the early stages of evolution , most electron neutrinos have an effective mass in the range @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the neutrino energy , as shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : meff ] .",
    "a resonance is met when the effective mass matches the mass of a state in the kk tower .",
    "the condition @xmath39 ensures that the width of the resonance is small compared to the distance between levels .",
    "when an electron neutrino emerges from an interaction in the inner core , its mixing with the massive states in the kk tower depends on its effective mass @xmath58 and therefore on the values of @xmath47 , @xmath59 , @xmath60 where the interaction took place .",
    "if @xmath53 is positive , @xmath31 is predominantly made of the mass eigenstate @xmath33 such that @xmath61 , with only a small component from the other eigenstates coincides with some @xmath34 within a resonance width .",
    "in such a case , @xmath31 will predominantly be made by a superposition of @xmath33 and @xmath62 .",
    "see  @xcite for a detailed discussion of mixing . ] .",
    "if @xmath63 , on the other hand , @xmath31 does not mix with the sterile states  the mixing takes place in the antineutrino sector in this case .",
    "after its interaction , the neutrino travels a distance of order of its mean free path , say about @xmath64 , before experiencing the next interaction .",
    "let us determine the probability @xmath65 that the electron neutrino has in the meanwhile oscillated into a bulk neutrino assuming that @xmath53 is positive .",
    "if @xmath53 is negative , the probability is negligible and what below applies to antineutrinos . over @xmath64 , the values of @xmath47 , @xmath59 ,",
    "@xmath60 change only slightly , but the corresponding change in the effective mass may be sufficient for the neutrino to predominantly mix with a different mass eigenstate @xmath66 .",
    "the dominant contribution to the disappearance probability @xmath65 is then given by the probability that @xmath33 has not turned into @xmath66 .",
    "this level `` non - crossing '' probability can be computed by means of the landau - zener formula  @xcite @xmath67 where @xmath68 is the number of levels crossed , @xmath69 is the adiabaticity parameter and we assumed @xmath70 , as follows from @xmath71 ( for @xmath72 , the analysis is complicated by non linear effects and back conversion of bulk neutrinos into @xmath31 ) . the landau - zener formula can be extended to the case of multiple resonances because the latter are well separated .",
    "the adiabaticity parameter is given by @xmath73 where @xmath74 is the angle between the neutrino momentum and the radial direction .",
    "the number of levels crossed over a distance @xmath75 is , not all neutrinos cross a resonance and @xmath68 should be considered as the average number of level crossed ( see below ) . ]",
    "@xmath76 we therefore conclude that [ eq : pnc ] @xmath77 the step function @xmath78 accounts for the fact that neutrinos ( antineutrinos ) do not cross any resonance if @xmath63 ( @xmath79 ) . correspondingly , we have neutrino disappearance for @xmath79 and antineutrino disappearance for @xmath63 .",
    "the probabilities depend on the neutrino parameters only through @xmath41 , to which they are proportional .",
    "the upper bound in eq .",
    "( [ eq : mmrrange ] ) ensures that @xmath80 . in obtaining the previous equation ,",
    "we have approximated the electron neutrino with the mass eigenstate of which it is predominantly made .",
    "additional subleading contributions to @xmath65 come from the small mixing with the neglected eigenstates , that amount to a fraction of order @xmath81 of the electron neutrino .",
    "their effect will be discussed in section  [ sec : subleading ] .",
    "let us now discuss the motivation for restricting the range of @xmath27 to @xmath82 .",
    "the number of resonances crossed in a mean free path can be estimated from eq .",
    "( [ eq : dn ] ) .",
    "roughly speaking , for @xmath83 most neutrinos are likely to cross at least a resonance in a mean free path  hundreds in the lower part of the allowed range . for @xmath84 ,",
    "on the other hand , resonances are met only by neutrinos with energies within @xmath85 from a set of discrete values @xmath86 in which @xmath87 .",
    "the discrete values @xmath88 are separated by @xmath89 . when @xmath84 , @xmath90 is smaller than the separation @xmath91 and the resonances are not crossed for arbitrary values of the energy anymore .",
    "however , there will always be neutrinos crossing a resonance as long as some of the energies @xmath88 fall in the neutrino spectrum .",
    "the condition @xmath92 ensures that there are at least 2050 points in the spectrum where neutrinos cross a resonance at the beginning of the evolution .",
    "it also ensures that there will be a few wells in the spectrum even when , at later stages , the product @xmath93 will decrease by a factor 1000 .",
    "we now have all the ingredients to understand how @xmath31 conversion in the inner core tends to draw the msw potential to zero everywhere through a feedback mechanism .",
    "let us consider a region in the inner core where the msw potential is positive .",
    "( [ eq : pnc ] ) shows that the neutrino conversion probability is proportional to @xmath94 . on the other hand ,",
    "once a neutrino has been lost in the bulk , @xmath53 decreases .",
    "this is because @xmath95 . as a consequence of the loss",
    ", the electron and electron neutrino number densities will readjust to restore @xmath96 equilibrium , but @xmath97 will certainly decrease .",
    "the more neutrinos are lost in the bulk the smaller @xmath53 becomes .",
    "it may happen , and we will see that it does happen , that @xmath53 approaches zero before all the lepton number and energy are lost . at this point",
    "the neutrino conversion through the msw enhanced probability  ( [ eq : pnc]a ) stops . in the region where the potential is negative , antineutrino",
    "escape would take place ( at a much slower rate ) drawing again the potential toward zero .",
    "as we will see , the possibility of reaching zero depends in this case on the local values of the thermodynamic variables .",
    "the effect we are dealing with is potentially quite interesting . besides limiting the energy loss",
    ", in fact , the condition @xmath98 represents an important constraint on the relative abundances , with significant implications for the sn phenomenology . however , several issues have to be addressed . first of all , the @xmath98 condition is spoiled by neutrino diffusion , which tends to lower @xmath53 below zero .",
    "antineutrino conversion into bulk neutrinos then tends to bring @xmath53 back to zero at the expenses of an additional energy loss .",
    "the actual evolution will be determined by an interplay of diffusion and conversion .",
    "moreover , it has to be proven that the mechanism is compatible with sn 1987a  observation . does the inner core loose all its lepton number and energy in the attempt of reaching the @xmath98 condition ? or while neutrinos try to diffuse out ?",
    "how quickly is the condition approached ? is the escape of the rare antineutrinos efficient enough ?",
    "qualitative arguments are not sufficient to reliably address the issues above , not to mention attacking the problem of implications for possible future sn observations . on the other hand ,",
    "a full , detailed simulation of the protoneutron star evolution is clearly beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "we therefore set up in the next section a toy model of inner core evolution which only incorporates the basic ingredients of neutrino diffusion but contains all the physics relevant to our study .",
    "we now discuss the equations we use to model the evolution of the inner core .",
    "we start from the case of no mixing with bulk neutrinos .",
    "we concentrate on the inner core because the bulk of energy and lepton number is stored there",
    ". moreover , the loss rates and the effectiveness of the feedback on the msw potential are highest in the core .",
    "that is because the neutrino densities are large and because the transition probability in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : pnc ] ) grows with the potential , which is proportional to the baryon density , where @xmath57 also grows with the baryon density @xmath47 .",

    "has also practical advantages .",
    "unlike the mantle , the core settles into local thermodynamic equilibrium very quickly after the collapse .",
    "the hydrodynamics is also much simpler , with the mass profile becoming essentially constant in a few hundreds milliseconds  @xcite .",
    "the mantle of the protoneutron , on the other hand , accretes matter for the first @xmath101@xmath102 and then slowly contracts .    assuming thermodynamic equilibrium and neglecting general relativity effects , the basic equations of neutrino transport in absence of mixing are  @xcite [ eq : transport ] @xmath103 where @xmath104 is the entropy per baryon and @xmath105 , @xmath106 are the lepton number and lepton energy density currents respectively . the neutrino currents are [ eq : currents ] @xmath107 where @xmath108 is the neutrino momentum , @xmath109 is the neutrino energy , @xmath110 is the neutrino mean free path ( mfp ) , which also depends on the local thermodynamic variables , and @xmath111 is the fermi - dirac distribution , @xmath112 , which depends on the temperature @xmath113 and the neutrino chemical potential @xmath114 .",

    "( [ eq : transport ] ) .",
    "we approximate them by imposing that the lepton number and energy fluxes at the border are proportional to the neutrino number and energy density .",

    "( [ eq : evolution ] ) we find the following relation between lepton fraction and the entropy variation : @xmath192 where the partial derivative is taken at a fixed position and the approximation @xmath193 holds for degenerate neutrinos .",
    "since such an approximation does hold for @xmath194 and @xmath195 , eq .",
    "( [ eq : tvsy ] ) shows that the temperature in the @xmath79 region actually grows while it deleptonizes . in turn",

    "the thick lines in fig .",
    "[ fig : fast ] can therefore be considered as the initial condition for the subsequent evolution .    before discussing the next phase ,",

    "because the simulation based on eq .",
    "( [ eq : tvsy ] ) , although it does not take into account the conditions met in the early stages of the sn , still gives a conservative estimate of the temperature variation and of the amount of the energy loss , a key piece of information for what follows . in summary , the thick profiles in fig .",
    "[ fig : fast ] can be considered realistic initial profiles for the next phase within the approximations and uncertainties associated to our approach and to core collapse models .",

    "the relevant equation is in this case @xmath202 the loss turns out to be more pronounced than in the previous phase .",
    "actually , the energy loss per unit of lepton number change is smaller , since the average antineutrino energy is @xmath203 whereas the average neutrino energy was @xmath204 .",

    "after the first , fast phase of neutrino escape and the second slower phase of antineutrino escape , diffusion begins to play a significant role .",
    "this happens on the slowest time scale @xmath178 .",
    "diffusion `` unlocks '' the energy stored in the @xmath98 region .",
    "some of it gets lost in the bulk , the rest diffuses out in the outer part and eventually is emitted mainly as active neutrinos .",
    "the diffusion regime however is different from the standard one that takes place in absence of transitions into the bulk .",
    "we have in this case a mixed regime in which the evolution is determined by an interplay of diffusion and escape .",

    "the same happens in the outer part of the core , where the effect is more pronounced because neutrino loss never took place and @xmath209 is larger during antineutrino conversion .",

    "since the total electron lepton number of those neutrinos must be 1 , there is a slight prevalence of electron neutrinos over the other species .",

    "the lepton number emitted in say the first second is 45 times larger than in the standard case , while the energy emitted is about the same . each electron neutrino emitted will be therefore accompanied in average by only a couple of neutrinos of other species .",

    "moreover , the electron neutrinos are much more effective than muon or tau neutrinos in depositing energy in the matter outside the neutrinosphere . as a consequence ,",
    "a larger @xmath31 component might help a stalling shock in ejecting the sn envelope .",
    "in fact , the heating rate of matter irradiated by a hotter @xmath31 flux is proportional to @xmath223 , which we expect not to be significantly affected by a large @xmath41 , and to the @xmath31 luminosity . as the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : loss ] shows , the total luminosity in all neutrino species ( integrated over 10 seconds , but the same holds for the luminosity itself ) is not significantly affected . therefore , an increase of the @xmath31 component has the effect of increasing the @xmath31 luminosity and , in turn , the heating rate .",
    "the enhancement can be significant and is only limited by the reduction of the @xmath224 flux and the effect on r - processes one is willing to accept .    [ fig : flux ]    [ fig : limits ]",

    "the interplay of neutrino diffusion and conversion into bulk neutrinos has an important role in the phenomenology we study and requires taking into account the relevant aspects of neutrino transport , which we did in the context of a simplified model of the protoneutron star core .    due to the large number of available states and especially to matter effects , the rate at which neutrino disappearance in the bulk cools the protoneutron star is initially dangerously high .",
    "if taken at face value , such a rate would set quite a stringent bound on @xmath41 , @xmath254 in the case of neutrino conversion .",

    "this feedback keeps @xmath51 close to @xmath198 until the temperature becomes too low to sustain the necessary antineutrino escape rate . in the region where the potential was initially negative",

    "there is not enough energy to reach @xmath98 .",

    "the implications for supernova physics are particularly interesting .",
    "although compatible with the sn 1987a  signal , the evolution of the protoneutron star is significantly affected , especially for large values of @xmath41 .",
