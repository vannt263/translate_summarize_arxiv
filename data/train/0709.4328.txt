    "over the ten past years , deeply virtual compton scattering ( dvcs ) became the most promising process to explore the partonic structure of the nucleon  . similarly to the diffusion of light by a cristal , which tells about the internal structure and organization of the material , the scattering of energetic photon off the nucleon in the bjorken regim ( @xmath3 and @xmath4 ) allows to access the generalized parton distributions ( gpds ) which describe the quark and gluon structure of the nucleon  .",
    "gpds correspond to the coherence between quantum states of different ( or same ) helicity , longitudinal momentum , and transverse position and can be interpreted in the impact parameter space as a distribution in the transverse plane of partons carrying longitudinal momentum fraction @xmath5  .",
    "the gpd framework provides a comprehensive picture of the nucleon structure which unifies within the same formalism form factors , structure functions , and partons angular momenta  @xcite .    in the jefferson laboratory ( jlab ) energy range , the bethe - heitler ( bh ) process , where the real photons are emitted either by the incoming or the scattered electrons , contributes significantly to the cross section of the electro - production of photons .",
    "however , the bh process is well - known and exactly calculable from the electromagnetic form factors of the nucleon .",
    "then , similarly to holography technique , the bh process is used as a reference amplitude which interferes with the dvcs amplitude and magnifies the underlying effects  @xcite . in jlab hall",
    "a , two experimental observables have been investigated : the total @xmath6 cross section @xmath7 and the difference of polarized @xmath0 cross sections for opposite longitudinal beam helicities @xmath8 \\nonumber \\\\ & = & { \\cal t}_{bh } \\ , \\im m \\{{\\cal t}_{dvcs}\\ } + \\re e \\{{\\cal t}_{dvcs}\\ } \\ , \\im m \\{{\\cal t}_{dvcs}\\ } \\ .",
    "\\label{eq : d5s}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] while the former gives access to the real part of the dvcs amplitude , that is the integral of a linear combination of gpds convoluted with a quark propagator , the latter is a direct measurement of its imaginary part , which relates to a linear combination of gpds in the handbag dominance hypothesis  @xcite .",
    "a dedicated experimental program   was set to investigate the dvcs reaction off the proton and off the neutron , with the aim to test factorization in the proton channel and to explore the sensitivity of the neutron channel to @xmath9 , the least known and constrained gpd .",
    "a 5.75  gev / c longitudinally polarized electron beam impinged on 15  cm liquid h@xmath10 and d@xmath10 cells , the latter serving as quasi - free neutron target .",
    "scattered electrons were detected in the left high resolution spectrometer ( hrs - l )  @xcite for several @xmath1 and constant @xmath11=0.36 .",
    "real photons were detected in a pbf@xmath10 electromagnetic calorimeter organized in an 11@xmath1212 array of 3@xmath123@xmath1218.6  @xmath13 crystals centered around the direction of the virtual photon .",
    "the calorimeter front face was 110  cm from the target center supporting the useful @xmath14 acceptance -0.5  gev@xmath15 .",
    "typical beam intensities of 4  @xmath16a yielded a 4@xmath1210@xmath17  @xmath18s@xmath19 luminosity with 76  % polarized electrons .",
    "three independent reactions were used to calibrate and monitor the calorimeter : h@xmath20 , d@xmath21 , and h , d@xmath22  @xcite . it should be emphasized that @xmath23 and @xmath24 data are taken simultaneously with dvcs data , ensuring a continuous monitoring of the calibration and the resolution of the calorimeter .",
    "rh0.50        the polarized cross section difference ( eq .  [ eq : d5s ] ) for dvcs off the proton ( p - dvcs ) was measured at three different @xmath1 ranging from 1.5  gev@xmath2 to 2.3  gev@xmath2  @xcite , and was analyzed according to the harmonic structure derived in ref .",
    "the @xmath25 and @xmath26 harmonic coefficients ( or moments ) have been separated . in the context of this experiment ,",
    "the kinematical factors entering the square of the dvcs amplitude suppress its contribution to @xmath27 as compared to the bh@xmath28dvcs interference amplitude , leading to a direct measurement of @xmath29 .",
    "the @xmath25 moment corresponds then to the imaginary part of the linear combination @xmath30 ( eq .  [ eq : tw2 ] ) of the compton form factors ( cffs ) @xmath31 , @xmath32 , and @xmath33 which relate to gpds  @xcite : @xmath34 figure  [ fig : ev1 ] shows the @xmath1 dependence of the twist-2 ( eq .  [ eq : tw2 ] ) and twist-3 ( @xmath35 $ ] ) harmonic coefficients of @xmath36 : the observed independence on @xmath1 is an indication for factorization .",
    "furthermore , the contribution of the twist-3 terms to @xmath36 was found to be small  @xcite .",
    "these features are a strong indication that factorization applies even at @xmath1 as low as 2  gev@xmath2 .",
    "rh0.45        the unpolarized h@xmath6p cross section was also measured at the highest @xmath1 point . neglecting the dvcs@xmath28dvcs term ,",
    "the real part of the dvcs amplitude ( eq .  [ eq : d5s ] ) was extracted according to the harmonic structure of ref .",
    "this leads to a @xmath37 and @xmath38 dependence , the gluon contribution - which would appear as a @xmath39 term - being negligible in the valence quark region .",
    "experimental data ( points ) are shown on fig .",
    "[ fig : ev2 ] as a function of @xmath40 for the smallest @xmath41-bin .",
    "the red curve fitting the data is the sum of the different contributions to the cross section : deviations from the pure bh amplitude ( blue solid curve ) shows that the dvcs amplitude contributes significantly to @xmath42 .",
    "this feature suggests that one should pay attention to the @xmath40-dependence of the denominator when extracting gpds from beam spin asymetries .",
    "+ in addition to the real part of the cffs combination of eq .",
    "[ eq : tw2 ] , the extracted harmonic coefficients give access to the combination @xmath43 which is independent of @xmath32 . as for @xmath44 , the contribution of twist-3 terms to @xmath42 was found negligible , supporting again factorization  @xcite .",
    "measuring the dvcs polarized cross section difference on a neutron target ( n - dvcs ) , one can access , similarly to the proton , the combination of eq .",
    "[ eq : tw2 ] .",
    "because of the smallness of the dirac form factor and the cancellation between the polarized @xmath45 and @xmath46 quark distributions in @xmath47 , eq .  [ eq : tw2 ] is dominated by the @xmath33 contribution .",
    "this spin - flip gpd , which can not be constrained by deep inclusive scattering , is of particular importance in ji s sum rule leading to the quark angular momentum  @xcite .",
    "the n - dvcs cross section difference @xmath36 was deduced from the subtraction of hydrogen data to deuterium data at @xmath1=1.9  gev@xmath2 and @xmath11=0.36  @xcite .",
    "the remaining coherent ( d - dvcs ) and incoherent ( n - dvcs ) contributions were extracted taking advantage of their @xmath48=@xmath49 kinematical separation  @xcite in the reconstructed squared missing mass , and the twist-2 ( eq .  [ eq : tw2 ] ) harmonic coefficient was obtained for several @xmath14 values , neglecting the higher twist contributions as supported by p - dvcs data . figure  [ fig : ev3 ]  @xcite shows the @xmath14-dependence of the @xmath25 moments extracted for the n - dvcs channel .",
    "they appear to be globally compatible with zero .",
    "the comparison to gpd based model calculations  @xcite shows the sensitivity of the present data to the contribution of the @xmath45 and @xmath46 quarks to the nucleon spin .",
    "the dvcs experimental program at jlab hall a delivered its first results : the factorization of the cross section was observed , and the power of neutron targets to reach quark angular momenta was proven .",
    "these features open unambiguously the era of systematic measurements of generalized parton distributions in dvcs processes at jlab 6 gev , and 12 gev in a near future .",
