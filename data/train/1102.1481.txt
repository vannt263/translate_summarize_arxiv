    "x - ray images of giant cavities in galaxy clusters associated with powerful jets from central active galactic nuclei ( agn ) suggest that agn may play an important role in the energetics of galaxy intra - cluster media ( icms ) ( _ e.g. , _ * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the estimated minimum energy required to produce cavities is often in the range of @xmath0 to @xmath1 erg @xcite .",
    "observations of icms have shown the existence of a temperature floor of approximately 2 kev ( _ e.g. , _ * ? ? ?",
    "the lack of gas below this temperature , contrary to expectations of a classical `` cooling flow '' @xcite , is historically known as the `` cooling problem '' .",
    "evidently , the energy required to suppress this cooling of the icm below 2 kev is on the same order as energy in the x - ray cavities @xcite . as a result , one popular hypothesis that has emerged to solve the cooling problem is that energy injected into the icm by agn will quench cooling and subsequent star formation in the central cluster galaxy .",
    "several numerical studies such as @xcite and @xcite have supported this hypothesis .",
    "x - ray cavity systems are evidently formed when low density , hot plasma originating from the agn inflates a bubble in the icm .",
    "the low density plasma produces a decrement in the line of sight intensity through the cavity from the normal icm x - ray emission @xcite .",
    "the cavities produce roughly elliptical brightness depressions @xmath220% to 40% below the surrounding regions @xcite .",
    "a few dozen such cavity systems are known ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "some cavities are filled with radio emission from relativistic particles and are typically found in pairs with an agn in the cluster center between them .",
    "other cavities devoid of radio emission above 1.4 ghz are referred to as radio ghosts ; ( _ e.g. , _ * ? ?",
    "the presence of multiple cavity pairs in some cases suggests a series of outbursts from the agn .",
    "hydra a , for example , contains several attached cavities filling at least 10% of the cluster volume within 300 kpc of the cluster center @xcite .",
    "work done by @xcite , however , suggests that the presence of multiple cavities may be the result of the motion of a dynamic icm .",
    "the size of cavities varies greatly from 1 kpc in diameter for m87 @xcite , for example , to over 200 kpc in diameter in hydra a @xcite .",
    "x - ray cavities are likely to be long lived structures , remaining intact for over 100 myr in hydra a , for example @xcite . on the other hand , simple hydrodynamic analyses suggest cavities filled with light gas should be unstable to rayleigh taylor ( rt ) and kelvin helmholtz ( kh ) instabilities as they form and rise in the cluster .",
    "several numerical studies have been performed , which include additional physics to stabilize the bubbles .",
    "@xcite , for example , carried out 2d calculations of bubbles with magnetic fields finding that the fields suppress instabilities .",
    "@xcite demonstrated the stabilizing effect of a braginskii viscosity mitigated by coulomb collisions .",
    "@xcite included a model for rt driven sub - grid turbulence in 3d hydrodynamic simulations of bubbles .",
    "their results show that turbulence can also prevent the break up of bubbles as a by - product of resulting icm entrainment .",
    "surveys of cavity systems and their energy of formation requirements have found that nearly half of the studied cavities show evidence for sufficient power to suppress cooling for short periods of time in their host clusters @xcite if the energy in the cavities becomes distributed in the icm .",
    "there are , however , significant uncertainties in the determination of the cavity energy contents and associated time scales . the energy content , generally assumed to be measurable in terms of the supporting pressure of the cavity , requires , for instance , accurate measurement of the cavity pressure and also its volume . the cavity volume , @xmath3 , is generally estimated from circles or ellipses fit by eye to the cluster x - ray surface brightness distribution . that two dimensional projection is then converted into a three dimensional ellipsoid by revolution around the long axis ( _ e.g. , _ * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the minimum energy required to inflate a cavity containing internal energy , @xmath4 , is taken to be the enthalpy content of the cavity , @xmath5 , based on the assumption that the cavity expanded subsonically in the icm at constant pressure , @xmath6 .",
    "the timescale needed to inflate the cavity and to measure the associated cavity power is usually estimated from buoyancy or characteristic sound crossing times arguments .",
    "a substantial amount of effort has gone into numerical studies of outflows from agn and the creation of bubbles containing hot agn generated plasma . to make direct comparisons with observations , however ,",
    "realistic synthetic observations from these calculations are needed .",
    "several authors have applied this approach with various models of jets and bubbles in a cluster ( _ e.g. , _ * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the synthetic observations of magnetically dominated cavities by @xcite were able to produce several of the observed characteristics seen in real observations including bright rims commonly found outlining cavities @xcite .",
    "@xcite were able to show consistency between their measurement of @xmath7 from synthetic observations of bubbles with sub - grid turbulence and a sample of observed cavities by @xcite .",
    "studies such as @xcite and @xcite have tested the efficiency of detecting cavity systems from x - ray observation , but to our knowledge , a detailed assessment of the reliability of the observational techniques used to determine cavity enthalpy has not been performed .",
    "synthetic observations of the complex interactions involved in the formation of x - ray cavities provide a powerful test of these methods",
    ". the primary goal of this paper is to test common observational techniques for determining cavity energetics .",
    "we employed a pair of 3d magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) simulations of jets in realistic cluster environments presented in @xcite ( henceforth , oj10 ) .",

    "we have used @xmath8 km s@xmath9 mpc@xmath9 , @xmath10 , and @xmath11 .",
    "the simulations presented , described by oj10 , were computed on a 3d cartesian grid using a 2nd order total variation diminishing ( tvd ) non - relativistic mhd code described by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "a gamma - law equation of state was assumed with @xmath12 ; radiative cooling was negligible for the conditions of these simulations and was therefore ignored .",
    "computational details are provided in oj10 .",
    "we provide here only an outline as needed to evaluate the present work .",
    "the physical extent of the computational grid was @xmath13 600 kpc , @xmath14 480 kpc .",
    "each computational zone represented one cubic kiloparsec with @xmath15 kpc .",
    "two oppositely directed jets were centered within the grid and aligned with the x - axis .",
    "a passive tracer , @xmath16 , was advected with the flow to identify jet material from ambient material .",
    "two different jet models are utilized in the present discussion ; 1 ) a so - called relic ( re ) model in which quasi - steady jets were on for 26 myr then turned off and , 2 ) an intermittent ( i13 ) model in which the jet power cycled on and off at 13 myr intervals throughout the simulation .",
    "both simulations featured bi - directed jets that had an internal mach 3 speed at full power , corresponding to a physical speed @xmath17 = 0.10c .",
    "these jets originated from a cylindrical region @xmath18 = 3 kpc in radius and @xmath19 = 12 kpc in length centered in the grid .",
    "the gas injected at the jet origin was less dense than the ambient gas by a factor of one hundred and was initially in pressure equilibrium with its local surroundings .",
    "temporal variation in the jet was controlled by an exponential ramp in density , pressure and momentum density over 1.64 myr for i13 and 0.65 myr for re .",
    "physical conditions inside the jet source region were relaxed to a volume average from a sphere surrounding the jet origin as the jet turned off , then evolved back from instantaneous volume averages for the local medium to the desired jet conditions as jet power resumed .",
    "the combined power from both jets at peak was @xmath20 erg s@xmath9 .",
    "small magnetic and gravitational energy contributions to the jet energy flux were ignored in defining the jet power .",
    "those energy terms were , however , followed explicitly in the simulations and accounted for in energy exchanges between the jets and their surroundings .",
    "the magnetic field launched from the jet was purely toroidal , @xmath21 inside a jet core region , with @xmath22 , on the perimeter of the jet core .",
    "there was a thin ` sheath' surrounding the core , through which all the jet properties , including the magnetic field transitioned to local icm conditions .",
    "the simulation cluster environments in oj10 were designed to mimic a realistic , relaxed cluster .",
    "gravitational potential and density profiles were selected to yield a temperature profile typical of clusters in hydrostatic equilibrium .",
    "a tangled ambient magnetic field with a characteristic coherence length typical of observed clusters was chosen to break symmetry over the grid . the local icm magnetic pressure averaged to about 1% of the gas pressure , although that ratio fluctuated by large factors over the volume .",

    "the scale of the fields maintains a @xmath48 100 on average over the cluster volume .",
    "the maximum magnitude of the field is @xmath49 g .",
    "the simulations included a population of relativistic cosmic ray electrons ( crs ) passively advected with the mhd quantities .",
    "the numerical details of the cr transport are given in @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "a small , fixed fraction of the thermal electron flux through shocks was injected into the cr electrons population and subjected to first order fermi acceleration according to the standard test - particle theory .",
    "downstream of shocks the crs were also subject to adiabatic and synchrotron / inverse compton radiative energy changes .",
    "the nominal cr pressure , which was neglected , was generally less than 1% of the gas pressure .",
    "crs with lorentz factors from @xmath40 10 to @xmath50 were tracked as a piecewise power law distribution .",
    "the inclusion of crs allowed us to calculate inverse compton and synchrotron emissions in a self - consistent manner .",
    "a separate analysis paper will include detailed consideration of radio synchrotron emission and high energy non - thermal x - ray ( @xmath51 10 kev ) emission .",
    "only x - rays below 10 kev are discussed in this paper .",
    "those are entirely dominated in our computations by thermal emissions from the cluster icm , although inverse compton emissions are included .",
    "the physical quantities evolved through mhd simulations of radio jets provide unparalleled intuition into the complex dynamics of mhd flows , but it has not always been intuitive to relate these quantities to observation . to make this connection and address questions raised from observations , emission processes in these simulations must be properly calculated and converted into a synthetic observation .",
    "the approach used here to model synthetic x - ray observations was based on @xcite .",
    "observations were computed for an assumed cluster redshift , @xmath52 , ( @xmath53 mpc ) corresponding approximately to the hydra cluster @xcite . in order to understand better the influence of projection effects , we carried out the synthetic observations at three representative angles , @xmath54 , between the jet axis and the line of sight .",
    "two emission mechanisms were included ; thermal bremsstrahlung and inverse compton scattering off of cmb photons . in each zone of the computational grid we calculated emissivities based on local properties of the thermal or cr electron population , then corrected them for the cluster redshift .",
    "thermal bremsstrahlung or free - free emissivity was computed as @xmath55 where @xmath56 .",
    "the free - free gaunt factor , @xmath57 , was computed by interpolation from the values calculated for plasma with typical icm properties in table 1 of @xcite .",
    "we assume a fully ionized @xmath58 hydrogen gas with an ideal gas equation of state where the average temperature per zone was @xmath59 with @xmath60 1/2 and @xmath6 and @xmath61 in cgs units .",
    "the numerical resolution of discontinuities in the simulations was a few zones .",
    "consequently , the contact discontinuity between agn ( jet ) and icm plasmas was a few zones of moderately high density , very high temperature gas .",
    "these transition regions were artificial and should not in the absence of some equivalent , real viscous mixing , contribute to line of sight intensities . to reduce this artifact , any zone with @xmath62 ( partially agn plasma ) had @xmath63 for thermal bremsstrahlung set to zero .",
    "equation [ f : brem ] was integrated numerically over a given range of frequencies to simulate finite bandwidths of real instruments .",
    "this paper focuses on energy ranges accessible to observatories typified by _",
    "chandra_. at those energies the inverse compton emission in these simulations is negligible .",
    "consequently , we omit details of their computation .",
    "assessing projection effects is critical to comparisons of these synthetic observations with real observations .",
    "we developed a parallelized ray casting engine that allows the user to define an arbitrary orientation and resolution for the output images .",
    "a ray was cast normal to the image plane through the appropriately aligned grid of emissivities .",
    "tri - linear interpolation was used at regular intervals along the ray and summed to give the total intensity along the line of sight , assuming an optically thin medium .",
    "finally , intensities were converted into fluxes per pixel by multiplying the line - of - sight intensity by the solid angle of an image pixel .",
    "the image resolution was set to 1 arc sec , which matched the simulation 1 kpc physical resolution at the selected 240 mpc source distance .",
    "synthetic x - ray observations of the re , relic simulation are shown for several times and projection orientations in figure [ fig : reobs ] . following a common practice designed to highlight agn - blown cavities , the computed brightness distribution of the icm outside of the identified cavities was fit with a double @xmath47-profile (  [ s : enthalpy ] ) and then divided out to accentuate the x - ray cavities .",
    "the double @xmath47-profile was determined independently for each synthetic x - ray observation .",
    "figure [ fig : reobs ] shows the synthetic x - ray observations in a 1.5 - 2.5 kev band divided by the best - fit double @xmath64profile in each instance",

    "shown , 26.3 myr , the jets had just turned off .",
    "each row corresponds to a different orientation , with the inclination angle of the jet with respect to the line of sight decreasing from top to bottom .",
    "there are several notable features in each observation .",
    "cavities are seen as brightness decrements from the surrounding emission .",
    "a pair of cavities is seen at 26.3 and 52.5 myr at large inclination but appear to merge into a single cavity at small inclination . presumably x - ray emission from a central galaxy would prevent the two cavities from appearing as a single cavity . our simulations , however , do not include emission from gas bound specifically to the central galaxy .",
    "all inclinations show a pair of cavities at 157.5 myr .",
    "the contrast in brightness of the cavity to the surrounding gas diminishes with both distance from cluster center and decreasing inclination . a detailed discussion on these trends can be found in @xcite .",
    "the bow shock from the jets is seen in all observations . at early times",
    "the bow shock appears as a bright rim surrounding the cavities . at later times",
    "the bow shock has moved far from the edge of the cavities and no longer appears as a bright rim .",
    "figure [ fig : i13obs ] shows a similar set of observations to those in figure [ fig : reobs ] , but for the i13 , intermittent jet simulation .",
    "several new features are seen with the introduction of jet intermittency .",
    "late times at every inclination reveal `` ripples '' between the cavities and the bow shock .",
    "these features correspond to sound waves generated at the cavity walls during periods of jet activity .",
    "similar `` ripples '' have been seen in observations of the perseus cluster ( @xcite ) .",
    "a second , related distinction from the re observations is the appearance of bright rims outlining the cavities at every epoch . at",
    "smaller inclination angles the bright rims resemble the `` arms '' seen on smaller scales in ngc 4636 @xcite .",
    "in the following analysis we attempted to apply common techniques for extracting two fundamental parameters for each cavity detected in each observation throughout the elapsed time of each jet model .",
    "every epoch for a given simulation represents a separate test for measuring both cavity enthalpy and cavity age .",
    "following this time evolution allows us to detect biases and trends in the quality of the measurements . for the remainder of this paper we refer to values measured directly from the simulation data as the `` actual '' values , while values measured from the synthetic observations are referred to as `` observed '' values .",
    "we report the fractional error on a measured quantity @xmath65 as @xmath66 for the remainder of this paper .",
    "the minimum energy required to produce a cavity is generally estimated as the total thermal energy in the cavity and the work done inflating the cavity slowly at constant pressure ; that is , the enthalpy in the cavity , @xmath67 .",
    "in particular , if the adiabatic index of the cavity plasma is @xmath68 , @xmath69 for a gas with @xmath70 , applicable to our simulations , this gives @xmath71 .",
    "estimation of cavity enthalpy , under the assumption that the cavity was inflated at its current location , requires knowledge of both the cavity volume and surrounding gas pressure .",
    "since the agn activity disturbed large volumes of the icm it is not straightforward to determine either its pressure distribution or , for that matter , the volume occupied by the agn generated cavity . a common strategy to resolve these two problems involves fitting a simple , symmetric brightness profile to regions of emission that seem not to include cavity structures . that profile",
    "can then be used to obtain estimates for the average radial icm properties .",
    "there are several variations of this strategy ( _ e.g. , _ * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "our goal was not to determine the best strategy but to use a common approach as an example .",
    "we followed a procedure similar to @xcite and @xcite to extract pressure and @xcite to extract volume from each observation .    for this exercise we used a double @xmath64profile profile ( _ e.g. , _ * ? ? ?",
    "* ) of the form @xmath72^{1/2 - 3\\beta_{1 } } +             s_{02}\\left[1 + \\left(\\frac{r_{p}}{r_{c2}}\\right)^{2}\\right]^{1/2 - 3\\beta_{2 } } \\right ) , \\label{f : dbeta}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath73 is the projected distance from cluster center , to model the brightness distribution of the x - ray emitting icm .",
    "@xcite discuss the benefits of using this profile as opposed to a single @xmath64profile .",
    "the profile was fit independently to each 1.5 - 2.5 kev synthetic x - ray observation of the re and i13 simulations .",
    "the synthetic images were divided into annular bins , each @xmath74 1 arc sec in width . to remove any effects of the x - ray cavities in characterizing the brightness profile of the cluster plasma , a set of ellipses",
    "was chosen that best fit each cavity by eye .",
    "any pixels within these ellipses were excluded from the annular bins .",
    "the average flux from the remaining pixels was used to define an azimuthally averaged brightness profile that was fit with the double @xmath47-profile .",

    "following convention , the observed icm pressure profiles were used to calculate x - ray cavity enthalpy on the assumption that the icm and cavity pressures were equal .",
    "the dotted lines in figures [ fig : repressure ] and [ fig : i13pressure ] show the average pressure in agn plasma at each radial bin .",
    "this pressure could only be observationally measured if the cavity were in exact pressure balance with the icm and the exact cluster - centric distance of the cavity was known . here",
    "we discuss how closely observation matches the agn plasma profile assuming the cavity location is known .",
    " [ s : cav_enthalpy ] discusses the effect of projection on inferred pressure .",
    "the agn plasma pressure in the re simulation , as shown in figure [ fig : repressure ] , roughly follows the icm pressure at 26.3 and 157.5 myr except for high pressure at the ends of the jets where momentum flows drive the cavities outward ( oj10 ) . at 52.5 myr ,",
    "the agn plasma pressure differs by as much as a factor of three from the actual icm pressure from 30 - 100 kpc .",
    "this discrepancy can be explained by the influence of the bow shock .",
    "referring to figure [ fig : repressure_cut ] , shocked icm material between projected distances of 30 - 100 kpc raised the average icm pressure over the lower pressure inside of the jet cocoon . the observed pressure profile , which is sensitive to the icm pressure , is @xmath114 75% greater than the agn plasma pressure within @xmath93 at this time .    for the i13 simulation at 26.3 myr in figure [",
    "fig : i13pressure ] , there is a significant difference between the agn and icm profiles from 25 - 35 kpc also due to the effects of the bow shock . at this time the observed pressure profile overestimates the agn plasma pressure by @xmath114 50% within 20 kpc . at 52.5 myr",
    ", the agn and icm profiles approximately agree with the exception at the ends of the jets . here",
    "the observed profile matches the actual agn plasma pressure to within 13% .",
    "the observed , agn , and icm profiles all agree at 52.5 myr to within @xmath114 30% except the ends of the jets .",
    "the intermittency of the jets impacts how well the observed profile reproduces the agn pressure . at 105 myr , when the jets are inactive , the observed pressure overestimates the agn pressure within 30 kpc while at 170.6 myr , when the jets are active , it underestimates it . inferring agn plasma pressure from observational measurement of the icm pressure at a specific radius was reliable only to @xmath114 75% from the re and i13 observations .",
    "cavity volumes were estimated from 1.5 - 2.5 kev observations at each analyzed epoch for both re and i13 simulations .",
    "as already noted , each cavity was fit by eye with a set of ellipses @xcite . for each projection angle , @xmath122 ,",
    "the cavities were assumed in this measurement to be in the plane of the sky in order to test the effects of an inaccurate or unknown value for the inclination .",
    "these observed cavity volumes were calculated assuming them to be ellipsoids of revolution around the major axis of each projected ellipse . by using multiple ellipses to cover each projected cavity we were better able to define the outer edge of the x - ray cavity .",
    "figure [ fig : ellipse ] shows an example of the area enclosed by the ellipses chosen for the re simulation at 131.3 myr observed at @xmath75 = 80@xmath76 . in general , it was difficult to define the edge of the cavities for the re simulation once the cavities extended past @xmath93 . for the i13 simulation the cavities",
    "were often outlined with a bright rim ( see figure [ fig : i13obs ] ) , making the edge ( taken to be the inside of the rim ) easier to find .",
    "the actual cavity volumes were computed by integrating the volume in the simulation data with @xmath62 ( partially agn plasma ) . observed and",
    "actual volumes are compared in figure [ fig : volume ] . since we expect a projection bias due to foreshortening along the jet axis ( see appendix [ a : ellipse ] ) , we plot the observed volume divided by @xmath123 , where @xmath124 is given by equation [ eq : ellipsecorr ] and @xmath125 is the actual length of a single best fit ellipse , normalized by the actual volume .",
    "the scatter in the measurements without correcting for this projection bias was @xmath114 50% .",
    "two features stand out in the comparisons in figure [ fig : volume ] .",
    "first , the @xmath123 correction reduced the scatter due to the projection bias to approximately 10 - 15% for both re and i13 .",
    "the second obvious feature of the comparison is that the observed cavity volume estimates tend to be modestly smaller than the actual volumes for re but not for i13 .",
    "the reason for this has to due with the different shapes of the cavities between re and i13 .",
    "i13 retains a nearly elliptical area at all times while re developed a non - elliptical shape ( see figures [ fig : reobs ] and [ fig : i13obs ] ) , which required many ellipses to fit .",
    "fitting ellipses will tend to underestimate a non - elliptical shape if the observer requires that none of the fits extend beyond the cavity edge . despite this limitation , and the subjective , observer - dependent nature of the process ,",
    "our observed volume estimates generally agree with the actual volumes to within about @xmath126% ( omitting the @xmath123 correction ) .    the observations used to determine cavity analysis did not include any noise representing x - ray counts or intrumental effects .",
    "low counts at large cluster centered distances would make cavity edges in those regions more difficult to identify . the long axis of all of the observed cavities , roughly aligned with the jet , would likely be underestimated given these conditions , which would reduce the measured volume by the same amount .",
    "the observational estimates for the icm pressure profile and cavity system volume presented above were used to derive the total cavity enthalpy , @xmath127 . the cavity volume enclosed by the chosen ellipses for each observation",
    "was discretized into 1 kpc@xmath128 volume elements corresponding to the 1 arc sec resolution of the images for a cluster distance , @xmath129 = 240 mpc .",
    "the pressure in each cavity volume was determined from the observed pressure profile and the projected cluster - centric distance of the volume elements .",
    "the total enthalpy in the cavity system for each observation was given by @xmath130    figure [ fig : enthalpy ] shows comparisons of the total energy added to the simulation volumes by jets , @xmath131 , the actual enthalpy in the cavity systems , @xmath132 , and the above observed cavity enthalpy estimates , @xmath127 , throughout the re and i13 simulations at three inclinations .",
    "the value for @xmath132 was computed from the pressure and total volume of each voxel in the simulation data with @xmath62 to be consistent with the synthetic observations ( see  [ s : synobs ] ) .",
    "this conservative cut meant that some icm enthalpy was included in @xmath132 values , making it possible for @xmath133 .",
    "several features stand out in comparing the various energy measures .",
    "the first feature is that @xmath127 , @xmath132 , and @xmath131 all agree with each other within about a factor of two for a given simulation and inclination angle .",
    "second , the comparisons of enthalpy , both observed and actual , and the total energy measures is better for the intermittent jet simulation , i13 , than for the terminated , re , case .",
    "this is consistent with the analysis of the simulations reported in oj10 . in particular , they noted that about 50% of the jet energy ( @xmath131 ) injected during the active phase of either the i13 or re model had been converted into icm thermal or kinetic energy by the end of the simulation .",
    "the remaining energy increment was mostly gravitational potential energy in the icm or thermal energy in the jet cocoon , which is roughly what @xmath127 measures .",
    "approximately 30% of @xmath131 ended up as gravitational potential energy in the icm for the re simulation .",
    "by contrast , a much smaller fraction , @xmath134% , of @xmath131 in the intermittent jet , i13 , simulation is converted to icm gravitational by the simulation s end .",
    "thus , we should expect a closer match between @xmath131 and @xmath132 in that case .",
    "another striking feature for both panels of figure [ fig : enthalpy ] is the consistency in @xmath127 among the inclination angles for a given simulation and epoch .",
    "this is due to two competing projections effects . in particular",
    ", the estimated volume generally decreases with decreasing inclination angle as discussed in ",
    "[ s : volume ] , while the projected distance from cluster center decreases , making a cavity appear to be in a higher pressure environment then it actually is . to see the net effect refer to figures [ fig : repressure ] and [ fig : i13pressure ]",
    "it is evident that the icm pressure profile can be approximated as a power law , @xmath135 , over the projected distances the cavities occupy ( 40 - 200 kpc ) for most of the simulated time . then , assuming a given cavity is a cylinder with radius @xmath136 extending from a projected distance @xmath137 to @xmath138 ( see appendix [ a : ellipse ] regarding the use of @xmath139 ) and estimating @xmath140 -1 we would predict that the enthalpy @xmath141 would be @xmath142 which is independent of @xmath75 .    for the re simulation on the left panel of figure [ fig : enthalpy ] @xmath127 always underestimated @xmath132 while the jets were active .",
    "recall that @xmath127 depends on the observed estimate of the icm pressure distribution and , from ",
    "[ s : pressure ] , that the observed pressure profile underestimated the agn plasma pressure ( the cavity pressure ) while the jets were active . in short , during those times the cavities are over - pressured as they drive moderate strength shocks into the icm .",
    "this is consistent with comparisons shown in figure [ fig : repressure ] .",
    "further into the simulation we see @xmath132 declining .",
    "the cavities are rising buoyantly in the cluster while maintaining approximate pressure equilibrium ( see oj10 ) . the thermal energy in the cavities dropped as this energy was transferred to gravitational potential energy .",
    "the observed values follow this trend , remaining within @xmath74 50% @xmath132 .",
    "the i13 simulation on the right panel of figure [ fig : enthalpy ] shows a different evolution of @xmath132 and @xmath127 because of the different agn history . there is a step - like growth of @xmath132 due to the intermittency of the jets .",
    "the time delay between the peaks of @xmath132 and @xmath127 at each step is due to the difference in evolution of the observed icm pressure and the actual agn plasma profiles .",
    "when the jets turn on the cavities are over - pressured with respect to the icm , but they eventually expand to approximate pressure balance .",
    "prior to the expansion of the cavities , however , the higher energy content of the cavities can not be accurately measured by the procedure described in  [ s : pressure ] .",
    "therefore , an increase of @xmath127 lags behind an increase of @xmath132 .",
    "three characteristic timescales are commonly employed for determining cavity age . for a cavity centered at a projected distance @xmath73 from cluster center , radius @xmath136 , cross section @xmath143 , drag coefficient @xmath144 , and volume @xmath3 these times are : 1 ) the buoyant rise time @xmath145 , 2 ) the `` refill time '' @xmath146 , and 3 ) the sound crossing time @xmath147 @xcite .",

    "following a procedure similar to @xcite , the value of @xmath73 was the projected distance from cluster center to the center of the cavity , the radius was given by @xmath152 , and the cross section was given by @xmath153 , where @xmath154 was half the maximum azimuthal width of the cavity .",

    "another approach may have been to assume @xmath166 1 similar to values empirically estimated by @xcite .",
    "the parameters and measurements used in a buoyant rise model are not very well constrained .",
