    "understanding typical properties of an ensemble is a useful methodology for analyzing quantum many - body systems .",
    "when we investigate typical properties of all pure states in a hilbert space , we use _ random states _ , an ensemble of pure states uniformly distributed in a given hilbert space with respect to the unitarily invariant measure .",
    "random states have been intensively studied from many aspects , e.g. , their entanglement@xcite , a relation to an appearance of the gibbs state in subsystems@xcite , a possible mechanism for black holes to have entropy@xcite , and quantum informational tasks@xcite . since",
    "random states are obtained by applying _",
    "random unitary matrices_@xcite to any pure state , quantum circuit implementations of random unitary matrices are also studied@xcite .",
    "it has been shown that the ensemble of unitary matrices simulating up to the @xmath0-th order of statistical moments of random unitary matrices , referred to as a _ unitary @xmath0-design _ , can be approximately achieved by quantum circuits@xcite .",
    "random unitary matrices themselves have many utilities in quantum informational tasks@xcite . _ phase - random states _ are restricted random states , where only phases of the expansion coefficients in a given basis are randomly distributed@xcite .",
    "they are originally introduced for investigating typical properties of time evolving states in isolated systems .",
    "it has been shown that phase - random states with a separable basis and equal - amplitudes have extremely high entanglement on average@xcite .",
    "this class of pure states have been studied in the context of locally maximally entangleable states@xcite , and in relation with mutually unbiased bases@xcite .",
    "they also reveal typical properties of states that appear in instantaneous quantum polynomial - time ( iqp ) circuits@xcite and commuting circuits@xcite , which are likely to have stronger computational power than classical computers even though they exploit only diagonal gates and a separable pure initial state .",
    "however , it had not been yet clarified whether or not the corresponding phase - random states can be efficiently generated .    in this paper , we provide quantum circuits that efficiently generate phase - random states of @xmath2 qubits with the computational basis ( tensor products of pauli @xmath7 basis ) . to this end , we introduce _ random diagonal - unitary matrices _ and _ diagonal - unitary @xmath0-designs _ , which are analogous to random unitary matrices and unitary @xmath0-designs , respectively . in particular , we consider those with the computational basis .",
    "one may think that such random diagonal - unitary matrices could be obtained by applying one - qubit diagonal gates with random phases . however , this is not the case since such random diagonal - unitary matrices generate large amount of entanglement even if an initial state is separable@xcite , but one - qubit gates can not .",
    "more precisely , only a diagonal - unitary @xmath8-design can be achieved by one - qubit diagonal gates .",

    "we show that _ phase - random circuits _ composed of two - qubit diagonal gates achieve diagonal - unitary @xmath1-designs . due to the commutativity of the gates ,",
    "the circuit becomes stationary after applying the two - qubit gates on all pairs of qubits , as long as the pairs are deterministically selected .",
    "we first explicitly show that such a stationary circuit is a diagonal - unitary @xmath1-design if we use controlled - phase gates with two - valued random phases and single qubit phase gates with three - valued random phases . on the other hand ,",
    "if we do not use random phases in a genuine two - qubit gate , e.g. , the phases in each controlled - phase gate are fixed such that it becomes the controlled-@xmath7 gate , the stationary circuit is not a diagonal - unitary @xmath1-design . hence , in the case of the phase - random circuit using the controlled-@xmath7 gates , we need to introduce extra randomness to achieve a diagonal - unitary @xmath1-design . we show that , if we apply two - qubit gates on _ randomly _ selected pairs of qubits , the phase - random circuit results in an _ @xmath4-approximate",
    "_ diagonal - unitary @xmath1-design after applying at most @xmath10 gates . in this case , the circuit does not become stationary after applying the gates on all pairs of qubits because of the random choices of the pairs .",
    "these results show that random variables in genuine two - qubit gates enhance the ability of randomizing phases .",
    "we also provide an application of the phase - random circuit , i.e. , a protocol for generating random states .",
    "we show that an exact @xmath1-design of random states can be obtained by combining the phase - random circuit with a simple classical procedure requiring @xmath6 random classical bits .",
