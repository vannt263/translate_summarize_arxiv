    "the birth of a proto - neutron star ( pns ) in a core collapse supernova is a very difficult phenomenon to model , since it requires not only accurate descriptions of the micro - physics of the collapsing matter , in particular of neutrino transport and related processes , but also of the violent dynamical processes occurring in the contracting - exploding star , which need to be treated in the framework of general relativity ( see @xcite for a recent review ) .",
    "the description of the subsequent pns evolution is also challenging , because a pns is a hot and rapidly evolving object .",
    "the physical processes which contribute to the star cooling and contraction , such as nuclear and weak interactions and energy and lepton number transport by neutrino diffusion , have to be included in dynamical simulations .",
    "thus , most simulations of gravitational core collapse to a pns end shortly after the core bounce and the launch of the supernova explosion  typically after a few hundreds of milliseconds  and only a few dynamical simulations extend to the first minute of the pns life @xcite .",
    "in this paper we are interested in this latest phase of the pns life , when shock waves , neutrino winds , convection instabilities , and accretion flows are no longer dominant and the star cooling and contraction proceed on timescales of seconds , so that the evolution is quasi - stationary .",
    "in particular , we want to study how the frequencies and damping times of the pns quasi - normal modes of oscillation depend on the star internal structure .",
    "the main motivation is that the oscillations of a newly born pns may be associated to gravitational wave signals with sizeable amplitudes , and with frequencies lower than those typical of mature neutron stars .",
    "this would favour their detection by the next generation of ground - based interferometers ligo / virgo and their future version ( et ) @xcite .    the available dynamical simulations of the post - bounce evolution of a pns indicate that , typically , the star goes through the following main steps .",
    "after the core bounce , a shock wave propagates through the outer pns mantle , leaving behind a low - entropy core in which neutrinos are trapped , surrounded by a low - density , high - entropy envelope .",
    "the mantle accretes matter from the outer layers and rapidly contracts , losing energy due to electron captures and thermal neutrino emission .",
    "the supernova explosion lifts off the stellar envelope and , in a few tenths of seconds , due to extensive neutrino losses , the lepton pressure decreases and the envelope contracts . at this stage",
    "the pns radius is about 2030  km ; the subsequent evolution can be described as a sequence of equilibrium configurations ; this quasi - stationary evolution is the phase of interest for us .",
    "simulations show that the diffusion of high - energy neutrinos ( of the order of a few hundred mev ) from the low - entropy core to the high - entropy envelope , from which they finally escape with energies of the order of a few tens of mev , generates a large amount of heat within the star , producing temperatures up to several tens of mev ; as a result , the core entropy approximately doubles , whereas the entropy of the envelope decreases . in a few tens of seconds",
    "the pns becomes lepton poor , but it is still hot .",
    "the net number of neutrinos in the interior is low , but thermally produced neutrino pairs of all flavors are abundant , and dominate the emission ; the star cools down and entropy gradients are gradually smoothed out , while the average neutrino energy decreases , and neutrinos mean free path increases ; after approximately one minute it becomes comparable to the stellar radius , and the star becomes neutrino transparent . by this time",
    ", the temperature has dropped to 15  mev ( @xmath0 15@xmath1  k ) and the star has radiated off almost all of its binding energy , becoming what we call a neutron star ( ns ) .",
    "this brief summary of the first minute of the pns life is deliberately imprecise , because the details of the evolution depend on the assumptions on which the simulation is based .",
    "for instance , in @xcite , where the first minute after the core bounce is considered , the evolution is treated as a sequence of quasi - stationary states : the thermodynamical variables and the lepton fractions are determined by solving evolution equations ( for instance boltzmann s equation to model neutrino transport ) , whereas at each time - step the stellar structure is found by solving the tolman - oppenheimer - volkov equations . in @xcite , instead , all quantities are determined through a time - evolution core - collapse code , which has been extended in order to describe the first @xmath2 s of the post - bounce processes . however , there are features which are common to different studies ; indeed , starting from an initial configuration characterized by a low - entropy core and a high - entropy envelope , due to neutrino processes the star goes smoothly through the following phases :    * the entropy increases in the core while decreasing in the envelope ; * entropy gradients gradually smooth out while the star is still hot ; * the star progressively cools down , and the overall entropy decreases ; * the evolution ends in the `` cold '' , zero entropy , neutron star configuration .",
    "we remark that both in @xcite and in @xcite the equation of state ( eos ) of baryonic matter is a finite - temperature , field - theoretical model solved at the mean field level .    in this paper , instead",
    ", we employ a microscopic eos obtained within the brueckner - hartree - fock ( bhf ) nuclear many - body approach extended to the finite temperature regime , as we shall discuss in sec .",
    "[ ss : eos ] .",
    "we stress that our aim is not to model the pns quasi - stationary evolution ; we rather want to explore how the frequencies and damping times of the pns quasi - normal modes depend on the physical quantities which characterize the quasi - stationary configurations , which are essentially the entropy profile ( which will appear to be the most important in this respect ) and the lepton composition .",
    "pns are expected to be rapidly rotating ; however in our study we neglect rotation , since we are primarily interested in the effects of the thermal and chemical evolution on the star oscillation frequencies , and in comparing the results with those of previous works which use different eoss to model the pns .",

    "different equivalent sets of equations have been derived in the literature , using different gauge choices or different combinations of the relevant equations @xcite . in this paper",
    "we use the formulation of lindblom and detweiler @xcite , consisting of a system of four first - order differential equations ( hereafter , the ld equations ) for the functions @xmath20 , where @xmath21 and algebraic relations which allow to compute the remaining functions @xmath22 in terms of the others ( see appendix [ ld ] ) . to close the system , an eos , relating the energy density @xmath23 and the pressure @xmath24 , has to be assigned .",
    "a qnm is a solution of the perturbation equations , which is regular at the center , continuous on the surface , and which behaves as a pure outgoing wave at infinity . since in general relativity",
    "a non - radial oscillation is associated to gravitational wave emission , such solutions belong to complex frequencies : @xmath25 where @xmath26 and @xmath27 is the pulsation frequency ; @xmath28 is the damping time of the mode due to gravitational wave emission .",
    "if the mode is unstable , its imaginary part is negative and @xmath29 is the growth time of the instability .",
    "the procedure to find the qnm frequencies is the following : ( i ) we choose a value of @xmath30 and a complex value of @xmath5 ( since the background is spherical , the equations do not depend on the index @xmath31 ) .",

    "the frequencies of the @xmath33-modes are lower than those of the @xmath24-modes , and the two sets are separated by the frequency of the fundamental ( @xmath34- ) mode , which is related to a global oscillation of the fluid . in general relativity there exist further modes , named @xmath35-modes @xcite , that are purely gravitational , since they barely excite the fluid motion .",
    "other classes of modes are associated to ns features which are not included in the present model , like rotation , magnetic fields , the crust rigidity .",
    "a neutron star at the end of its evolution is cold and isentropic , matter is in beta - equilibrium and can be described by a barotropic eos @xmath36 .",
    "conversely , when the star is young and hot the eos can not be expressed in a barotropic form , since the pressure depends non - trivially on the entropy and on the composition , i.e. , @xmath37 therefore , to solve the perturbed equations the profiles of entropy and particle fractions , respectively @xmath38 and @xmath39 , are also needed . in eq .",

    "@xcite .    to clarify this statement ,",
    "let us consider a fluid element oscillating with period @xmath49 about the equilibrium position .",
    "the following equation holds : @xmath50 since we are considering adiabatic perturbations , the fluid element does not exchange heat with its surroundings and @xmath51 . furthermore",

    "( [ dpcs2de ] ) and ( [ dpall ] ) then give @xmath59 for beta - stable , neutrino - trapped matter .    for the pnss in quasi - stationary evolution we consider in this paper , typical oscillation periods are of the order @xmath60 s , while weak interactions timescales are @xcite @xmath61 for modified and direct urca processes , respectively .",
    "in the first seconds of a pns life @xmath62 k , thus @xmath63 . therefore the stellar pulsations always occur in local beta equilibrium .",
    "timescales of strong nuclear reactions are even smaller .      for old , cold neutron stars ,",
    "the frequency of the @xmath34-mode , @xmath64 , is in the range 1 - 3 khz , and the damping time , @xmath65 , is of the order of a few tenths of seconds . according to the newtonian theory of stellar pulsations",

    "indeed , their presence can be traced back to the schwarzschild discriminant @xcite , @xmath67 where @xmath68 .",
    "the radial acceleration of a fluid element displaced from equilibrium by @xmath69 is @xmath70 therefore , if @xmath71 the fluid element oscillates about the equilibrium position , whereas if @xmath72 it is accelerated away from equilibrium .",
    "it follows that , if in some region of the star @xmath72 , this region is convectively unstable and the star admits a set of unstable @xmath33-modes , otherwise the @xmath33-modes are stable .",
    "if @xmath73 vanishes identically , the star does not have ( all degenerate to zero frequency ) .",
    "this is the case if the neutron star is cold and old , since the eos is barotropic and @xmath74 .",
    "similar information is contained in the brunt - visl frequency which , in a relativistic framework , is defined as @xcite @xmath75 it has been shown that , although the brunt - visl frequency changes by many orders of magnitude throughout the star , it allows to estimate some frequencies of newtonian stars .",
    "for instance , in @xcite the frequency of higher - order of main sequence stars is computed using the following formula @xmath76 where @xmath77 is the stellar radius , @xmath78 is the order of the @xmath33-mode , and @xmath79 is the effective polytropic index of the outer layers of the star . however , the brunt - visl frequency can not be used to estimate neutron star @xmath33-mode frequencies @xcite ; these frequencies can only be found by solving the perturbation equations , as we do in the present paper .",
    "nevertheless the following considerations will be useful to interpret the results we will show in the following .",
    "( [ tassg ] ) indicates that higher frequency values correspond to larger values of @xmath73 ( i.e. , of @xmath80 ) inside the star .",
    "since we shall assume @xmath81 ( see sec .",
    "[ prof ] ) , we have @xmath82 we may expect that higher @xmath33-mode frequencies correspond to larger entropy gradients",
    ".      a qnm of a pns is characterized by the pulsation frequency and by the damping time @xmath28 .",
    "its value is important because it shows how fast the pulsation energy can be dissipated through gravitational wave emission , and it must be compared to the timescale @xmath83 associated with other dissipative processes which may compete with gw emission .",

    "( phenomena which we are neglecting in our model ) . in the first minute of life of a pns , @xmath84 s @xcite",

    "we also remark that , if a qnm is unstable , the instability can grow only if @xmath86 .    as long as @xmath87 ,",
    "when a star oscillates in a qnm , the pulsation energy changes in time as @xcite @xmath88 and the power radiated in gravitational waves is @xmath89 thus , smaller qnm damping times are associated with a more efficient gravitational wave emission . in the case of cold nss ,",

    "these configurations will be used to simulate the quasi - stationary evolution of a pns , and to compute how the stellar parameters and the quasi - normal mode frequencies change during the evolution . as discussed in the introduction ,",

    "[ f : fig3 ] , the gravitational damping time of the @xmath151-mode sharply increases for @xmath152 , while the mode frequency sharply decreases . however , as discussed in sec .",
    "[ s : osc ] , as soon as @xmath153 becomes comparable to @xmath84 s , the mode becomes ineffective with respect to gravitational wave emission , since the stellar oscillations are damped by non - gravitational dissipative processes .",
    "the most interesting result which emerges from table  [ t : tab4 ] and fig .",
    "[ f : fig3 ] is that at earlier times , i.e. , for @xmath154 , the frequencies of the @xmath150 modes cluster in a small region around 1  khz , and then tend quite rapidly to the values appropriate for a cold ns ( remember that our entire sequence should cover approximately a minute of the pns evolution ) .",
    "this behaviour is similar to that found in @xcite , where the quasi - stationary evolution sequence was obtained using a finite - temperature eos derived within the mean field approach , treating neutrino transport using the diffusion approximation .",
    "the fact that in the very early stages the mode frequency is of the order of 1 khz ( or lower ) is important for gravitational wave detection , because the sensitivity of ground - based interferometers ligo / virgo decreases quite significantly at larger frequencies .",
    "another interesting point to note is that during the early evolution the damping time of all modes is smaller than 10  s. this means that gravitational wave emission is effectively competing in removing energy from the star with dissipation processes related to neutrino viscosity , diffusivity , and thermal conductivity , since typical neutrino timescales are of the order of 1020  s ( see also section 2.1 of @xcite for a detailed discussion of this point ) .    furthermore , for @xmath155 the damping times of the and are nearly coincident , showing that in the early stages the is as effective as the as a source of gravitational waves .",
    "indeed , the function @xmath156 given by eq .",
    "( [ igw ] ) , whose square integral over the star is the gravitational wave luminosity , is similar for the two modes due to a similar profile of the energy density perturbation . at later `` times ''",
    "@xmath153 becomes much larger than @xmath65 and , as the pns tends to the ns final configuration , the frequency tends to zero .",
    "in this paper we have investigated how the frequencies and damping times of the quasi - normal modes of a proto - neutron star depend on the physical quantities which characterize the stellar configurations during the quasi - stationary evolution .",
    "the most important is the entropy profile inside the star , whereas the dependence on the lepton composition is weaker .",
    "the most interesting result is that if the entropy gradient between core and envelope is large , the frequencies of the first @xmath33-mode , of the fundamental mode , and of the first @xmath24-mode tend to cluster in a small region near @xmath157 khz , whereas the damping time of the first @xmath33-mode and of the @xmath34-mode become comparable .",
    "this means that during the initial phases of the quasi - stationary evolution , when the core entropy is low and the envelope entropy is large , these two modes are competitive as far as gravitational wave emission is concerned .",
    "the damping times are of the order of a few seconds , smaller than dissipative timescales associated to neutrino processes , which are of the order of 1020  s. thus , if the star has some mechanical energy to dissipate , it is likely that it will do it through the @xmath151 and @xmath34 modes .",
