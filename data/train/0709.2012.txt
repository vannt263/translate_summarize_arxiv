    "in figure [ train - princ ] the schematic view of the licas train operating in the accelerator tunnel is presented . the train is composed of 6 cars , the distance between the centres of neighbouring cars is @xmath3 .",
    "each car is equipped with 4 ccd cameras and two beam splitters ( bs ) constituting the straightness monitor .",
    "the straightness monitor measures the transverse translation ( @xmath4 ) and transverse rotation ( @xmath5 ) with respect to a @xmath6 axis defined by the laser beam passing through all cars in a vacuum pipe .",
    "the laser beam is reflected back using the retro - reflector ( rr ) located in the last car , illuminating the upper ccd cameras of the straightness monitors .",
    "6 fsi lines placed in the same vacuum pipe between each pair of cars are responsible for the distance measurement along the @xmath6 axis ( @xmath7 ) . in addition",
    "a clinometer located on each car provides a measurement of rotation around the @xmath6 axis ( @xmath8 ) .",
