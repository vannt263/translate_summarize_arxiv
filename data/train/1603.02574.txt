    "these resonances  @xcite have been interpreted in terms of nuclear molecules  @xcite .",
    "the question of how quasimolecular resonances may reflect continuous transitions from scattering states in the ion - ion potential to true cluster states in the compound systems was still unresolved in the 1990s @xcite .",
    "in many cases , these resonant structures have been associated with strongly - deformed shapes and with @xmath0-clustering phenomena @xcite , predicted from the nilsson - strutinsky approach , the cranked @xmath0-cluster model  @xcite , or other mean - field calculations  @xcite . in light",
    "@xmath0-like nuclei clustering is observed as a general phenomenon at high excitation energy close to the @xmath0-decay thresholds @xcite .",
    "this exotic behavior has been perfectly illustrated by the famous ",
    "ikeda - diagram \" for @xmath2=@xmath3 nuclei in 1968 @xcite , which has been recently modified and extended by von oertzen @xcite for neutron - rich nuclei , as shown in the left panel of fig.2 .",
    "clustering is a general feature @xcite not only observed in light neutron - rich nuclei @xcite , but also in halo nuclei such as @xmath6li @xcite or @xmath7be , for instance @xcite .",
    "the problem of cluster formation has also been treated extensively for very heavy systems by r.g .",
    "gupta @xcite , by zagrebaev and w. greiner @xcite and by c. simenel @xcite where giant molecules and collinear ternary fission may co - exist @xcite .",
    "finally , signatures of @xmath0 clustering have also been discovered in light nuclei surviving from ultrarelativistic nuclear collisions @xcite .    in this talk , i will limit myself first to the light @xmath1c , @xmath8o and @xmath9ne @xmath0-like nuclei in section 2 , then to @xmath0 clustering , nuclear molecules and large deformations for heavier light nuclei in section 3 .",
    "the search for electromagnetic transitions and @xmath0 condensates in heavier @xmath0-like nuclei will be discussed in sections 4 and 5 , respectively , and , finally , clustering effects in light neutron - rich nuclei ( oxygen isotopes ) will be presented in section 6 before conclusions of section 7 .",
    "the renewed interest in @xmath1c was mainly focused to a better understanding of the nature of the so called `` hoyle '' state @xcite that can be described in terms of a bosonic condensate , a cluster state and/or a @xmath0-particle gas @xcite .",
    "much experimental progress has been achieved recently as far as the spectroscopy of @xmath1c near and above the @xmath0-decay threshold is concerned  @xcite .",
    "more particularly , the 2@xmath10 `` hoyle '' rotational excitation in @xmath1c has been observed by several experimental groups @xcite .",
    "the most convincing experimental result comes from measurements of the @xmath1c(@xmath11,@xmath0)@xmath12be reaction performed at the higs facility @xcite .",
    "the measured angular distributions of the alpha particles are consistent with an @xmath13=2 pattern , including a dominant 2@xmath14 component .",

    "hoyle '' state @xcite in @xmath1c is most certainly going to decay exclusively by particle emission with very small @xmath11-decay branches , thus , very efficient particle-@xmath11 coincidence techniques will have to be used in the near future to search for them .",
    "bec states are expected to decay by alpha emission to the  hoyle \" state and could be found among the resonances in @xmath0-particle inelastic scattering on @xmath1c decaying to that state . in 1967",
    "chevallier et al .",
    "@xcite could excite these states in an @xmath0-particle transfer channel leading to the @xmath18be@xmath18be final state and proposed that a structure corresponding to a rigidly rotating linear arrangement of four alpha particles may exist in @xmath8o .",
    "very recently , a more sophisticated experimental setup was used at notre dame @xcite : although the excitation function is generally in good agreement with the previous results @xcite a phase shift analysis of the angular distributions does not provide evidence to support the reported hypothesis of a 4@xmath0-chain state configuration .",
    "experimental investigations are still underway to understand the nuclear structure of high spin states of both @xmath8o and @xmath9ne nuclei for instance at notre dame and/or ithemba labs @xcite facilities .",
    "another possibility might be to perform coulomb excitation measurements with intense @xmath8o and @xmath9ne beams at intermediate energies .",
    "the real link between superdeformation ( sd ) , nuclear molecules and @xmath0 clustering @xcite is of particular interest , since nuclear shapes with major - to - minor axis ratios of 2:1 have the typical ellipsoidal elongation for light nuclei i.e. with quadrupole deformation parameter @xmath19 @xmath17 0.6 .",
    "furthermore , the structure of possible octupole - unstable 3:1 nuclear shapes - hyperdeformation ( hd ) with @xmath19 @xmath17 1.0 - has also been discussed for actinide nuclei in terms of clustering phenomena .",
    "typical examples for possible relationship between quasimolecular bands and extremely deformed ( sd / hd ) shapes have been widely discussed in the literature for @xmath20 @xmath0-conjugate @xmath2=@xmath3 nuclei , such as @xmath21si @xcite , @xmath22s @xcite , @xmath23ar @xcite , @xmath24ca @xcite , @xmath25ti @xcite , @xmath26cr @xcite and @xmath27ni @xcite .",

    "this figure has been adapted from refs .",
    "@xcite . ]    in fact , highly deformed shapes and sd rotational bands have been discovered in several light @xmath0-conjugate nuclei , such as @xmath23ar and @xmath24ca by using @xmath11-ray spectroscopy techniques @xcite . in particular , the extremely deformed rotational bands in @xmath23ar ( shown as crosses in fig .",

    "these resonances belong to a rotational band , with a moment of inertia close to that of a hd band provided by both the cranked @xmath0-cluster model @xcite and the nilsson - strutinsky calculations .",
    "the fact that similar quasi - molecular states observed in the two reactions fall on the same rotational band gives further support to our interpretation of the @xmath23ar composite system resonances .",
    "an identical conclusion was reached for the @xmath24ca composite system where sd bands have been discovered @xcite .",
    "therefore , similar investigations are underway for heavier @xmath0-like composite systems such as @xmath25ti @xcite , @xmath26cr @xcite and @xmath27ni @xcite .",
    "ternary clusterizations in light @xmath0-like composite systems are also predicted theoretically , but were not found experimentally in @xmath23ar so far @xcite . on the other hand , ternary fission of @xmath27ni  related to its hd shapes  was identified from out - of - plane angular correlations measured in the @xmath22s+@xmath28 mg reaction with the binary reaction spectrometer ( brs ) at the vivitron tandem facility of the iphc , strasbourg @xcite .",
    "this finding @xcite is not limited to light @xmath2=@xmath3 compound nuclei , true ternary fission @xcite can also occur for very heavy @xcite and superheavy @xcite nuclei .",
    "clustering in light nuclei is traditionally explored through reaction studies , but observation of electromagneetic transitions can be of high value in establishing , for example , that highly - excited states with candidate cluster structure do indeed form rotational sequences .",

    "the high - energy level scheme of @xmath8o shown in ref .",
    "@xcite indicated that this state does not @xmath0-decay because of its non - natural parity ( in contrast to the two neighbouring 4@xmath31 states at 10.36  mev and 11.10  mev ) , but it @xmath11 decays to the 2@xmath31 state at 6.92  mev ( 54.6 @xmath32 2 @xmath33 ) and to the 3@xmath34 state at 6.13  mev ( 45.4% ) . by considering all the four possible transition types of the decay of the 3@xmath31 state ( _ i.e. _ e@xmath35 and m@xmath36 for the 3@xmath31 @xmath37 3@xmath38 transition and , m@xmath35 and e@xmath36 for the 3@xmath31 @xmath37 2@xmath31 transition ) , our calculations yield the conclusion that @xmath39  ev , a value fifty times lower than known previously , which is an important result for the well studied @xmath8o nucleus @xcite .",
    "clustering effects in the light neutron - rich oxygen isotopes @xmath40o will also be discussed in section 5 .",
    "@xmath0 clustering plays an important role in the description of the ground state and excited states of light nuclei in the @xmath41 shell . for heavier nuclei , in the @xmath42-shell",
    ", cluster configurations may be based on heavier substructures like @xmath1c , @xmath7c and @xmath8o as shown by the  extended ikeda - diagram \" proposed in fig .  1 .",
    "this was already well discussed to appear in @xmath28mg(@xmath1c-@xmath1c ) and @xmath21si(@xmath1c-@xmath8o ) both theoretically and experimentally .",
    "the case of the mid-@xmath42-shell nucleus @xmath21si is of particular interest as it shows the coexistence of deformed and cluster states at rather low energies @xcite .",
    "its ground state is oblate , with a partial @xmath0-@xmath28 mg structure , two prolate normal deformed bands are found , one built on the @xmath43 state at 4.98 mev and on the @xmath44 state at 6.69 mev .",
    "the sd band candidate with a pronounced @xmath0-@xmath28 mg structure is suggested @xcite . in this band ,",
    "the 2@xmath14 ( 9.8 mev ) , 4@xmath14 and 6@xmath14 members are well identified .    in the following",
    "we will briefly discuss a resonant cluster band which is predicted to start close to the coulomb barrier of the @xmath1c+@xmath8o collision , i.e. around 25 mev excitation energy in @xmath21si . we have studied the @xmath1c(@xmath8o,@xmath11)@xmath21si radiative capture reaction at five resonant energies around the coulomb barrier by using the zero degree dragon spectrometer installed at triumf , vancouver @xcite .",
    "details about the setup , that has been optimized for the @xmath1c(@xmath1c,@xmath11)@xmath28 mg radiative capture reaction in our of previous dragon experiments , can be found in ref .",
    "the @xmath1c(@xmath8o,@xmath11)@xmath21si data clearly show @xcite the direct feeding of the prolate 4@xmath45 state at 9.16 mev and the octupole deformed 3@xmath34 at 6.88 mev .",
    "this state is the band head of an octupole band which mainly decays to the @xmath21si oblate ground state with a strong e@xmath46 transition .",
    "our results are very similar to what has been measured for the @xmath1c+@xmath1c radiative capture reaction above the coulomb barrier in the first dragon experiment @xcite where the enhanced feeding of the @xmath28 mg prolate band has been measured for a 4@xmath14 - 2@xmath14 resonance at e@xmath47 = 8.0 mev near the coulomb barrier . at the lowest energy of @xmath1c+@xmath8o radiative capture reaction , an enhanced feeding from the resonance j@xmath48 = 2@xmath14 and 1@xmath14 t=1 states around 11 mev",
    "is observed in @xmath21si .",
    "again this is consistent with @xmath1c+@xmath1o radiative capture reaction data where j@xmath48 = 2@xmath14 has been assigned to the entrance resonance and an enhanced decay has been measured via intermediate 1@xmath14 t=1 states around 11 mev in @xmath28 mg . a definitive scenario for",
    "the decay of the resonances at these low bombarding energies in both systems will come from the measurement of the @xmath11 decay spectra with a @xmath11-spectrometer with better resolution than bgo but still rather good efficiency such as labr@xmath46 crystals .",
    "in principle the nucleus is a quasi - homogeneus collection of protons and neutrons , which adopts a spherical configuration i.e. a spherical droplet of nuclear matter . for light nuclei the nucleons are capable to arrange themselves into clusters of a bosonic character .",
    "the very stable @xmath0-particle is the most favorable light nucleus for quarteting - @xmath0 clustering - to occur in dense nuclear matter .",
    "these cluster structures have indeed a crucial role in the synthesis of elements in stars .",
    "the so called  hoyle \" state  @xcite , the main portal through which @xmath1c is created in nucleosynthesis with a pronounced three-@xmath0-cluster structure , is the best exemple of @xmath0 clustering in light nuclei . in",
    "@xmath0 clustering a geometric picture can be proposed in the framework of point group symmetries @xcite .",
    "for instance , in @xmath18be the two @xmath0 clusters are separated by as much as @xmath17 2fm , @xmath1c exhibits a triangle arrangement of the three @xmath0 particles @xmath17 3fm apart , @xmath8o forms a tetrahedron , etc .",
    "evidence for tetrahedral symmetries in @xmath49 was given by the algebraic cluster model @xcite .",
    "a density plot for @xmath9ne nucleus calculated as an arrangement of two @xmath0 particles with a @xmath1c core is displayed in fig .  4 to illustrate the enhancement of the symmetries of the @xmath0 clustering .",
    "in the study of the bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) the @xmath0-particle states were first described for @xmath1c and @xmath8o @xcite and later on generalized to heavier light @xmath2=@xmath3 nuclei @xcite .",
    "the structure of the `` hoyle `` state and the properties of its assumed rotational band have been studied very carefully from measurements of the @xmath1c(@xmath11,3@xmath0 ) reaction performed at the higs facility , tunl  @xcite . at present , the search for an experimental signature of bec in @xmath8o is of highest priority . a state with the structure of the ",

    "however , any state in @xmath8o equivalent to the ' ' hoyle \" state in @xmath1c is most certainly going to decay by particle emission with very small , probably un - measurable , @xmath11-decay branches , thus , very efficient particle - detection techniques will have to be used in the near future to search for them .",

    "the attempts to excite these states by @xmath0 inelastic scattering  @xcite was confirmed recently  @xcite .",
    "another possibility , that has not been yet explored , might be to perform coulomb excitation measurements with intense @xmath8o beams at intermediate energies .",

    "4 that displays axially and reflection symmetric self - consistent equilibrium nucleon density distributions . we note the well known quasimolecular @xmath0-@xmath1c-@xmath0 structure although clustering effects are less pronounced than the ones predicted by nilsson - strutinsky calculations and even by mean - field calculations ( including hartree - fock and/or hartree - fock - bogoliubov calculations ) @xcite .    the most recent work of girod and schuck @xcite validates several possible scenarios for the influence of clustering effects as a function of the neutron richness that will trigger more experimental works .",
    "we describe in the following section recent experimental investigations on the oxygen isotopes chain .",
    "as discussed previously , clustering is a general phenomenon observed also in nuclei with extra neutrons as it is presented in an  extended ikeda - diagram \" @xcite proposed by von oertzen @xcite ( see the left panel of fig .  2 ) . with additional neutrons ,",

    "are the main ingredients . actually , the @xmath7c nucleus may play similar role in clusterization as the @xmath8o one since it has similar properties as a cluster : i ) it has closed neutron p - shells , ii ) first excited states are well above e@xmath51 = 6 mev , and iii ) it has high binding energies for @xmath0-particles .    a general picture of clustering and molecular configurations in light nuclei can be drawn from a detailed investigation of the light oxygen isotopes with a @xmath52 17 . here",
    "we will only present recent results on the even - even oxygen isotopes : @xmath53o @xcite and @xmath9o @xcite .",
    "but very striking cluster states have also been found in odd - even oxygen isotopes such as : @xmath54o @xcite and @xmath55o @xcite .",

    "the dependence of excitation energies on j(j+1 ) and the dependence of measured cross sections on 2j+1 @xcite were considered .",
    "slope parameters obtained in a linear fit to the excitation energies @xcite indicate the moment of inertia of the rotational bands given in fig .",
    "the intrinsic structure of the cluster bands is reflection asymmetric , the parity projection gives an energy splitting between the partner bands .",
    "the assignments of the experimental molecular bands are supported by both the generator - coordinate - method @xcite and the antisymmetrized molecular dynamics ( amd ) calculations @xcite .",
    "overview of 4 rotational band structures observed in @xmath9o .",
    "this figure is adapted from @xcite ]    we can compare the bands of @xmath9o @xcite shown in fig .",
    "the first doublet ( k=0@xmath56 ) has a slightly larger moment of inertia ( smaller slope parameter ) in @xmath9o , which is consistent with its interpretation as @xmath7c@xmath57he or @xmath8c@xmath58he molecular structures ( they start well below the thresholds of 16.8 mev and 12.32 mev , respectively ) . the second band , for which the negative parity partner is yet to be determined , has a slope parameter slightly smaller than in @xmath53o .",
    "this is consistent with the study of the bands in @xmath9o by furutachi et al .",
    "@xcite , which clearly establishes parity inversion doublets predicted by amd calculations for the @xmath7c@xmath59he cluster and @xmath7c-2n-@xmath0 molecular structures .",
    "the corresponding moments of inertia given in fig .",
    "5 are strongly suggesting large deformations for the cluster structures .",
    "we may conclude that the reduction of the moments of inertia of the lowest bands of @xmath9o is consistent with the assumption that the strongly bound @xmath7c nucleus having equivalent properties to @xmath8o , has a similar role as @xmath8o in relevant , less neutron rich nuclei .",
    "therefore , the ikeda - diagram @xcite and the `` extended ikeda - diagram '' consisting of @xmath8o cluster cores with covalently bound neutrons @xcite must be further extended to include also the @xmath7c cluster cores as illustrated in fig .  2 .",
    "the link of @xmath0-clustering , quasimolecular resonances , orbiting phenomena and extreme deformations ( sd , hd , ... ) has been discussed in this talk . in particular ,",
    "the bec picture of light ( and medium - light ) @xmath0-like nuclei appears to be a good way of understanding most of properties of nuclear clusters .",
    "new results regarding cluster and molecular states in neutron - rich oxygen isotopes in agreement with amd predictions are presented .",
    "consequently , the  extended ikeda - diagram `` has been further modified for light neutron - rich nuclei by inclusion of the @xmath7c cluster , similarly to the @xmath8o one . of particular interest is the quest for the 4@xmath0 states of @xmath8o near the @xmath18be+@xmath18be and @xmath1c+@xmath0 decay thresholds , which correspond to the so - called  hoyle '' state .",
    "the search for extremely elongated configurations ( hd ) in rapidly rotating medium - mass nuclei , which has been pursued by @xmath11-ray spectroscopy measurements , will have to be performed in conjunction with charged - particle techniques in the near future since such states are most certainly going to decay by particle emission ( see @xcite ) .",
    "marked progress has been made in many traditional and novels subjects of nuclear cluster physics .",
    "the developments in these subjects show the importance of clustering among the basic modes of motion of nuclear many - body systems .",
    "all these open questions will require precise coincidence measurements @xcite coupled with state - of - the - art theory .",
