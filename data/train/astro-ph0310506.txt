    "<S> we present a statistical analysis of the chandra observation of the source field around the 3c 295 galaxy cluster ( @xmath0 ) . </S>",
    "<S> three different methods of analysis , namely a chip by chip logn - logs , a two dimentional kolmogorov - smirnov ( ks ) test , and the angular correlation function ( acf ) show a strong overdensity of sources in the north - east of the field , that may indicate a filament of the large scale structure of the universe toward 3c 295 . </S>"
