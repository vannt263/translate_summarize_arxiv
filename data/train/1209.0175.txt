    "however , while they can remain at relatively high temperatures for gyr , wds are small and therefore usually faint objects , so that assembling complete catalogs of wds has historically been challenging .",
    "the last decade has seen an impressive growth in our ability to find and characterize wds , largely thanks to the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the first sdss wd catalog included @xmath7 wds @xcite ; the second nearly quadrupled that number , and included @xmath8 new , spectroscopically confirmed wds @xcite .",
    "the most recent sdss wd catalog , based on the sdss data release 7 ( dr7 ; * ? ? ? * ) , contains @xmath920,000 stars , of which 12,538 are classified as das ( kleinman et al .",

    ".    unsurprisingly , many of these wds are in binary systems .",
    "the zoo of sdss wd binaries is diverse ; among its largest pens are those containing spectroscopic wd / m - dwarf pairs ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and cataclysmic variables ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "a smaller but especially interesting pen is the one for double wd ( wdwd ) systems .",
    "depending on the composition and mass of the two wds , wdwds may be a formation channel for am cvn - type binaries ( also found in sdss ; * ? ? ?",

    "most known sdss wdwds are unresolved and/or compact binaries . by comparison , the expected population of wide , resolved wdwds remains mostly unexplored , largely because of the observational challenges these types of binaries present , whatever their component stars .",
    "wide binaries can have orbital periods that are much longer than human lifetimes",
    ". members of these systems can only be identified astrometrically and confirmed through radial velocity measurements , although in practice the latter are hard to obtain for large samples of field stars . over his 70 year career ,",
    "luyten perfected a method that relies on proper motion ( @xmath11 ) measurements to identify binary systems ( see for example the discussion in * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the resulting pairs are known as common proper - motion binaries ( cpmbs ) .",
    "this method is now commonly used and generally relies on high - proper - motion , magnitude - limited catalogs , so that searches for cpmbs tend to uncover nearby stars ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "wide binaries provide a unique perspective on stellar evolution : for those with orbital separations @xmath12 au , the coeval components are far enough apart that mass exchanges are unlikely to have significantly impacted their individual evolutions @xcite .",
    "wide binaries that include a main - sequence star and a wd can be used to determine the initial - to - final mass relation ( ifmr ) for wds ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the wd mass and cooling age are determined spectroscopically , and this age is subtracted from the main - sequence star s age to determine the wd s main - sequence lifetime and hence initial mass .",
    "wdwds , for which total ages are not generally available , can still provide robust constraints on the ifmr ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "wdwd systems can also be used to constrain the effects of mass - loss on orbital evolution , for example by comparing their separations to the distributions for binaries containing two main - sequence stars and a main - sequence star and a wd ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "unfortunately , the current sample of wide wdwd systems is small and heterogeneous , severely limiting its utility for these studies .",
    "the surveys of @xcite and ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) identified several thousand cpmbs ; of these , a few hundred were thought to contain a wd .",
    "spectroscopic follow - up allowed @xcite to confirm six as wdwds and @xcite to increase that number to 21 .",
    "since then , individual wdwds have been reported ( e.g. , those found in the palomar green survey ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but there has been no systematic search for new wide wdwds .",
    "sdss is an excellent dataset for identifying wide wdwds .",
    "the photometric survey covered a large area to unprecedented depth ( @xmath410@xmath13 deg@xmath0 and @xmath9@xmath14 mag ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and matches between sdss and usno - b have been used to generate a proper motion catalog @xcite that is integrated into the sdss database .",
    "indeed , @xcite used sdss to uncover wide companions to low - mass main - sequence stars based on common proper motions : these authors identified over 1300 cpmbs , of which 21 include one wd .",
    "we adapt the method developed by @xcite to search for widely separated wd companions to the set of spectroscopically confirmed da wds included in the forthcoming kleinman et al .  catalog . in section 2",

    "whether a wdwd is observed today as a tight or a wide binary depends primarily on the orbital separation of the binary at birth . because wd progenitors go through mass - losing giant phases , wdwd orbits may expand up to a factor of five due to conservation of angular momentum @xcite . if , however , the wd progenitors overflow their roche lobes while in a giant phase , they will likely enter unstable mass transfer , causing a rapid , order - of - magnitude shrinking of the orbit ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "we therefore expect to observe a bimodal distribution of orbital separations , with a population of wide wdwds that avoided any mass transfer phases and one of tight wdwds that underwent unstable mass transfer .",
    "we use population synthesis to characterize this distribution in detail .",
    "population synthesis is commonly used to analyze the formation and evolution of wdwds .",

    "as expected , this distribution is bimodal , with the number of systems with @xmath34 au dominating the overall population .",

    ", the two stars can be considered to have evolved independently .",
    "while the number and distribution of tight systems in figure  [ phist ] is strongly dependent upon e.g. , the prescription used to describe common envelope evolution , the existence of a population of a population of wdwds widely separated at birth is a robust prediction of our code .",
    "wdwd orbits are modified over time by gravitational wave radiation and weak interactions with other bodies in the galaxy .",
    "we use the equations of @xcite to model the first of these effects , which is most important for the tightest binaries in figure [ phist ] .",
    "we model the second effect using the fokker - planck approximation , which determines the diffusion of energy into and out of the binary system . using this approximation",
    ", @xcite found the characteristic lifetime @xmath35 of a binary consisting of two 0.6 @xmath36 wds to be :    @xmath37    the lifetime of a canonical wdwd with @xmath32 au is therefore a few gyr .",
    "we assign each zams binary a birth time uniformly distributed over the lifetime of the galactic disk ( 0 - 10",

    "shows the distribution of surviving binaries at the present day ( 10 gyr ) , after gravitational radiation and galactic interactions have caused some to merge and disrupted others .",

    "these parameters , combined with the intrinsic orbital parameters of the binary ( eccentricity , masses , and orbital separation ) define the orbital positions of the two wds . using a fiducial distance of 250 pc ,",
    "we then determine the projected angular separation ( @xmath39 ) of each wdwd .",
    "binaries with @xmath40  or @xmath410@xmath3 are eliminated because our method for identifying wdwds ( described below ) is not sensitive to these .",
    "the predicted observed @xmath39 distribution of our synthesized wdwds is shown in figure  [ cdf_sep ] .",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , wide wdwds can also be used to constrain this relation . @xcite",

    "this was added to the secondary s cooling age to obtain the total age of the system .",
    "@xcite were then able to use stellar models to estimate the primary s initial mass .",
    "the resulting data point in the initial - final mass plane has relatively small error bars and can be used to discriminate between different theoretical ifmrs .    however , most of the 45 systems in table [ tab : known_sys ] lack spectroscopic information , and many of the wds with spectra have large error bars on @xmath98 or log @xmath53 because these were derived from low signal - to - noise spectra .",
    "such errors can propagate into large uncertainties in the masses and cooling ages .",
    "while in principle these wide wdwds can be used to constrain the ifmr with a method similar to that of @xcite , we defer a full study of this question to a later paper .",
    "spectroscopic follow - up of an expanded set of wdwds , combined with ever improving wd atmospheric models , may eventually produce a large , homogeneous dataset with which to constrain the ifmr .",
    "for now , as a simple consistency check , we compare the cooling ages and masses of the wds in the eight systems for which both stars have spectroscopically derived @xmath98 and differing masses ( and that are not a potential triple system ) .",
    "we expect that in these binaries the more massive wd has a larger cooling age .",
    "our simple test holds for all eight of these systems .",
    "to expand the sample of known wdwds , we adapted the method of @xcite to search the sdss dr7 catalog for wd common proper motion companions to spectroscopically confirmed da wds out to @xmath214 .",
    "we found 41 candidate wide wdwds .",
    "these are pairs in which the secondary s colors fall within 0.5@xmath64 of the region in @xmath65 versus @xmath41 color space occupied by da wds @xcite .",
    "we then used two complementary techniques to measure the contamination of our sample by randomly aligned false matches .",
    "we first estimated the overall contamination of our sample by false binaries by shifting the positions of our primaries several times by 1@xmath101 and applying our @xmath11 and color criteria to identify false companions to the shifted primaries .",
    "we also used the monte carlo approach developed by @xcite and searched @xmath29 iterations of the line - of - sight to each of our primaries for stars whose properties randomly match those of these wds .",
    "these two tests suggest that , absent other information , the highest probability real pairs in our sample are those with @xmath215 and primaries with random matches in fewer than 1% of our rendered lines - of - sight .",
    "13 of our candidates meet these criteria ; one of these pairs has inconsistent spectroscopically derived distance and rv measurements for the two wds , so that our final sample includes 12 high - confidence wide wdwds .",
    "( three of these were previously reported as candidate wdwds . )",
    "four of these pairs have sdss spectra for both das , while two others have secondaries classified as das by @xcite .",
    "spectroscopic follow - up is clearly needed to confirm the nature of the secondaries in the remaining six systems . however ,",
    "a color selection combined with a minimum proper motion requirement returns a very clean sample of das @xcite ; furthermore , based on their reduced proper motions , all of our candidates are consistent with being wds .",
    "we therefore expect no more than one of our high - confidence pairs to contain a non - wd .",
    "these systems are a significant addition to the known population with small @xmath11 ( @xmath2200 mas / yr ) and large @xmath39 ( @xmath410 ) .",
    "@xcite estimate the completeness of wd spectroscopic coverage in sdss at @xmath944% for @xmath203 mag , and it decreases for fainter magnitudes .",
    "this is particularly unfortunate as the sdss proper motion catalog goes to @xmath216 .",
    "extending the method developed to identify the 12 pairs presented here to a photometrically selected set of primary wds could significantly increase the number of known wdwds , which is currently @xmath250 .",
    "an expanded set of wdwds and spectroscopic follow - up may eventually produce a large enough dataset for these pairs to realize their full potential as testbeds for theories of stellar evolution .",
