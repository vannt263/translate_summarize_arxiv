    "outbursts from the transient x - ray pulsar v0332 + 53 were detected in 1973 @xcite , 1983 @xcite , 1989 @xcite , 2004 - 2005 @xcite , and recently a large type ii outburst starting in june 2015 @xcite .",
    "these outbursts have typically been split into two categories , type - i and type - ii outbursts .",
    "the relatively less luminous type - i outbursts are more frequent , occurring near periastron passages and lasting a few days .",
    "type - ii outbursts have a peak luminosity near the eddington luminosity @xcite and can last for several months .",
    "the peak x - ray intensity in the giant 1973 outburst reached @xmath21.6 crab in the 3 - 12 kev band @xcite while the intensity approached @xmath21.2 crab in the 1.3 - 12.2 kev band for the 2004 - 2005 outburst @xcite .",
    "the type - ii outbursts in v0332 + 53 have typically had a duration of 2 - 3 months , with a decay time @xmath215 - 20 days longer than the rise time , and have occurred approximately once every 10 years since the first detection in 1973 .",
    "the optical companion , bq cam , is an o8 - 9 type main sequence star @xcite which has been observed to brighten in optical and ir for several months prior to the x - ray flare @xcite .",
    "the x - ray outbursts then occur due to the passage of the neutron star through the enhanced decretion disk of bq cam @xcite .",
    "the x - ray spectrum of v0332 + 53 has usually been fit by a phenomenological model composed of a power law with exponential cutoff plus cyclotron absorption line @xcite or an npex ( negative and positive power - law with exponential ) model @xcite plus cyclotron absorption lines @xcite . based on rxte observations of the 2004 event ,",
    "@xcite fit the spectrum with three cyclotron absorption lines at approximately 26 , 52 , and 74 kev , corresponding to a surface magnetic field of @xmath3 g. observations of the 2004 outburst noted that the energy of the fundamental cyclotron line decreases with increasing luminosity and that the ratio of the energy of the first harmonic to that of the fundamental line is near 2 and increases with luminosity @xcite . this has been interpreted as due either to changes in the height at which the cyclotron absorption line is produced @xcite or to reflection from the neutron star surface @xcite .",
    "@xcite and @xcite also investigated possible hysteresis of the cyclotron absorption line energy , equivalent width , and pulsed fraction between the 2004 - 2005 outburst rise and decline , which might signal a change in the physics of the accretion column or emission .",
    "they found no sign of hysteresis in the 2004 - 2005 event .",
    "however , a decrease of the line energy has been observed over the 2015 outburst and attributed to a drop in the magnetic field during the outburst @xcite .",
    "@xcite and @xcite have created color - color diagrams ( ccd ) and hardness - intensity diagrams ( hid ) for a number of be / x - ray binaries including v0332 + 53 during type ii outbursts . similar to lmxbs , the hids are characterized by two different accretion states with a `` horizontal '' branch corresponding to relatively low accretion rates and a `` diagonal '' branch corresponding to higher accretion .",
    "the transition between the horizontal and diagonal branches is interpreted to occur @xcite at the point at which the luminosity reaches the critical luminosity ( i.e. , where the inward flow becomes radiation - dominated on the diagonal branch rather than governed by coulomb interactions on the horizontal branch ) .",
    "4u 0115 + 63 and v0332 + 53 were the only sources where hysteresis was observed in the hid during the time the source was on the diagonal branch , with the spectrum becoming softer during the outburst decline @xcite .",
    "the reported hysteresis in the hid for v0332 + 53 was observed for the 2004 - 2005 outburst @xcite .    between january 2012 and february 2015 , the optical brightness of bq cam increased by @xmath20.7 mag @xcite .",
    "on june 20 2015 ( mjd 57193 ) , an x - ray outburst was then reported to begin by _ maxi _",
    "@xcite followed by _ swift",
    "the event rose to a peak of @xmath4 crab in the 12 - 25 kev energy range after approximately 50 days and decreased back to quiescence after approximately 150 days . @xcite",
    "have shown that the peak energy of the fundamental cyclotron line decreased from @xmath5 kev at the start of the event to @xmath6 kev after 56 days and then recovered to @xmath7 kev after 105 days , corresponding to a decrease in the surface magnetic field from @xmath8 g to @xmath9 g near the peak and then an increase back to @xmath10 g at the end of the event ( assuming a redshift of 0.3 corresponding to a @xmath11 m@xmath12 neutron star with radius of 10 km ) .",

    "the outburst begins near or slightly before the periastron passage at mjd @xmath29 .",
    "there is an indication that the outburst begins slightly earlier at higher energies , although because all instruments are observing near their respective noise limits , the differences in sensitivity may play a role in the observed effect .",
    "if the outburst does indeed begin earlier in the hard x - rays , this could be related to the spectral hardening observed as v0332 + 53 transitions from low - accretion states @xcite . in the hard x - rays ,",
    "the flux then increases linearly until there is a `` kink '' at mjd @xmath30 . as discussed in section [ ssec : disc_shape ] below , this kink coincides with v0332 + 53 changing from the horizontal branch of its hid track to the diagonal branch and is marked with a vertical dotted / dashed line .",
    "the flux then increases linearly across all energy ranges until the second periastron passage at mjd @xmath31 , where an uptick in flux is seen in all light curves . during the outburst decline , bat had the most complete coverage of the periastron passage at mjd @xmath32 , and there again appeared to be a change in the slope associated with the periastron passage . there is no noticeable kink in the flux as the source moved back to the horizontal branch of the hid at mjd @xmath33 as was observed in the outburst rise .    to test the hypothesis of @xcite which suggested an exponential decrease in flux throughout the outburst decline related to exponential emptying of the neutron star accretion disk , a straight line was fit to the _ swift_/bat data between the time of transition to the diagonal branch ( radiation - dominated braking ) at mjd @xmath30 and @xmath34 , where the flux started to plateau just before periastron passage at mjd @xmath31 .",
    "the reduced-@xmath35 of this linear fit was @xmath36 ( @xmath37 dof ) .",
    "an exponential fit to the same time interval produced a reduced-@xmath35 of @xmath38 ( @xmath37 degrees of freedom , dof ) .",
    "a straight line was also fit to the data between the periastron passage at mjd @xmath32 and the transition to the horizontal branch at mjd @xmath33 , with a reduced-@xmath35 of @xmath39 ( @xmath40 dof ) .",
    "an attempt to fit this interval of the outburst decline to an exponential decrease in flux was unsuccessful .",
    "the data are best fit by using a roughly linear increase and decline rather than an exponential increase or decline . in disagreement with @xcite ,",
    "this suggests that the dominant factors in determining outburst shape are the times of periastron and transitions between radiation - dominated slowing ( braking ) of the inward flow and slowing due to coulomb interactions .    in the bat and gbm energy ranges , v0332 + 53 switches between modes of braking at a lower flux level during the outburst decline than during the rise . at the lower _ maxi _ energy range ,",

    "the decrease in flux between times of transition points to a more general drop in the luminosity at these times .",

    "[ fig : hid ] , the source can be seen to move from the rising horizontal branch ( becoming harder at low intensity ) , to the rising diagonal branch ( becoming softer with increasing luminosity ) , and then down the falling diagonal branch ( becoming harder with decreasing luminosity ) and finally along the falling horizontal branch ( becoming softer at low intensity ) as the outburst comes to an end .",
    "the transition from the horizontal branch to the diagonal branch is expected @xcite to be the point at which the luminosity reaches the critical luminosity ( i.e. , where the inward flow becomes radiation - dominated on the diagonal branch rather than governed by coulomb interactions on the horizontal branch ) .",
    "this occurs at approximately mjd 57195 in the hid , corresponding to the change in slope of the light curve at the same time .",
    "the peak in the light curve ( near mjd 57238 ) corresponds to the transition from the rising diagonal to falling diagonal branch .",
    "the transition from falling diagonal to falling horizontal branch occurs at approximately mjd 57290 , where figures  [ fig : hard_lc ] and  [ fig : maxi_lc ] show slight although not conclusive indications of flattening of the light curves .",
    "figure  [ fig : hid ] shows a difference in color between the rise and decay of the outburst ( i.e. , hysteresis in the hid ) , with the source being harder during the outburst rise than during the fall . despite the incomplete observations of the outburst decline , the hysteretic behavior observed is much larger than the plotted statistical errors and",
    "can not be explained by the natural spread of the data .",
    "using the most recent orbital parameters from @xcite , specifically the times of periastron , the orbital modulation of the light curve becomes apparent .",
    "the outburst begins in the 12 - 25 kev band just prior to periastron at mjd @xmath29 . in the gbm and bat light curves , there appears to be a flattening of the light curve just before the second periastron at mjd @xmath31 followed by a steepening . during the decline",
    ", the bat light curve shows a flattening around the third periastron at mjd @xmath32 .",
    "the flux is too low at the fourth periastron to allow any definitive statement about the light curve behavior .    during the outburst rise ,",
    "the difference of a few days between periastron and the increases in flux can be roughly described by the accreted material from the decretion disk of bq cam traveling through the accretion disk of the neutron star and reaching the x - ray emission regions . for a separation between bq cam and the neutron star at periastron of @xmath42 km , with a dynamical timescale determined by the neutron star mass of @xmath11 m@xmath12 , a delay of @xmath43 days",
    "is expected @xcite .",
    "it is likely however that increases in the accretion rate would begin before the neutron star reaches periastron .",
    "it should also be noted that the accretion disk would not extend all of the way to the neutron star surface due to the large magnetic field of the neutron star pulling material from the accretion disk at the alfven radius . in this case , the energy dependence of the outburst light curve would then be determined by the details of how the accretion rate affects the soft and hard x - ray emission regions / processes .",
    "based on the dependence of the hard x - ray light curve on the mode of braking within the accretion column , we are led to conclude that at least the x - rays above @xmath44 kev ( lower limit of _ fermi_/gbm energy band ) must originate from within the accretion column to create such a dependence @xcite .",
    "no definitive conclusions based on figure  [ fig : maxi_lc ] can be made about the emission region of the softer x - rays due to the scarcity of _ maxi _ observations near the time of transition across the critical luminosity .",
    "@xcite have suggested that the 3 - 60 kev _ integral _ light curve during the decline of the 2005 outburst could be modeled by an exponential decay with a folding time of 20 - 30 days before becoming linear near the end of the outburst .",
    "they argue that the suggested behavior is similar to that in lmxbs , where a hot disk illuminated by the central star empties at a rate proportional to its mass , producing an exponential decay of the emitted flux . as in @xcite",
    ", it follows that when the disk cools and is no longer uniformly heated , the flux then follows a linear decrease .",
    "if the exponential behavior was real as suggested in @xcite , then one would expect to see this throughout the entire outburst decay .",
    "figures  [ fig : hard_lc ] and  [ fig : maxi_lc ] show a roughly linear decay between periastron at mjd @xmath32 and the transition between accretion states at mjd 57290 _ which does not support the description of exponentially decreasing flux throughout the outburst decay_. however , there is the possibility that the dips observed just before periastron in the gbm and bat light curves could still be described by an exponentially emptying accretion disk .",
    "this is supported by the outburst decline having more modulation on top of the linear decay when compared to the linear increase during the outburst rise , because the accretion disk would be more likely to only be filled partially during the decline .      in figure",
    "[ fig : hard_lc ] , the flux level of v0332 + 53 as it transitions across the critical luminosity is lower during the outburst decline than during the outburst rise .",
    "this is a signal that the critical luminosity has dropped , and by proxy , the magnetic field has also decreased .",
    "this confirms the result of @xcite that based on the decrease of the cyclotron resonance line energy the magnetic field dropped during the outburst . combining our knowledge of the times where v0332 + 53 crosses the critical luminosity with the spectra reported by @xcite",
    ", we can evaluate the drop in the critical luminosity .",
    "interpolating linearly between the spectra taken by",
    "_ swift _ on mjd 57193 and 57201 we estimate a critical luminosity of @xmath45 erg / s on 57195 .",
    "similarly , we estimate a critical luminosity of @xmath46 erg / s on mjd 57290 using the _ swift _ spectra taken on mjd 57277 and 57293 , corresponding to a @xmath47 decrease .",
    "this can be compared to the results obtained by using the fundamental cyclotron line energy to estimate the magnetic field and then the critical luminosity @xcite .",
    "a fundamental line energy of @xmath48 kev for mjd 57195 , interpolating from @xcite , corresponds to a surface magnetic field of @xmath49 g and a critical luminosity of @xmath50 erg / s . for mjd 57290",
    "we interpolate a fundamental line energy of @xmath51 kev , magnetic field of @xmath52 g , and a critical luminosity of @xmath53 erg / s , corresponding to a @xmath54 drop in the critical luminosity .",
    "we note that no correction has been made here for gravitational redshift effects .",
    "@xcite have noted that the spin - up rate is higher for a given luminosity during the rising phase than during the decline .",
    "they argue that this is the opposite of what is expected from the connection between the torque exerted on the neutron star and the accretion flow , and suggest as a result that the decrease in the cyclotron line energy may be due to a change in the size of the magnetosphere rather than to a decrease in the magnetic field . on the contrary , the consistency shown above between the critical luminosity based on the times derived from the light curves and the hid , and the critical luminosity determined from the line energies seems to support the @xcite suggestion of a direct connection between the cyclotron line energies and a decreasing magnetic field .",
    "hysteresis in the hid can be seen in figure  [ fig : hid ] , where the falling diagonal branch is softer than the rising diagonal branch .",
    "similar behavior has been observed during the 2004 - 2005 event @xcite despite the poor coverage of the outburst rise .",
    "this does not appear to be related to the decrease in magnetic field during the event suggested by the observed decrease in cyclotron line energy in 2015 , since hysteresis was observed in the hid with no observed change in the magnetic field between the rise and decay of the 2004 - 2005 event @xcite .",
    "the lack of a connection between the magnetic field and hysteresis in the hid suggests that the cause of the hysteresis is likely located outside of the central accretion column .    in our case , we see a difference between the spectral fits for _ integral _ revolutions 1565 and 1570 in the electron plasma temperature , which cools from @xmath43 kev to @xmath55 kev near the outburst peak",
    ". more efficient cooling of the electron plasma later in the outburst could be a possible explanation for the hysteresis observed in figure  [ fig : hid ] , where the hard x - rays more efficiently cool the plasma as accretion increases .",
    "the hard x - rays would be down - scattered during this process , resulting in a softer spectrum as the outburst rises to maximum .",
    "we have analyzed data from _ maxi_/gsc , _",
    "fermi_/gbm , _ swift_/bat , _ integral_/jem - x , and _ integral_/spi taken during the type ii outburst of the be / x - ray binary system v0332 + 53 in 2015 .",
    "the complex features in the light curve are correlated with the times of periastron passage , changes in the mode of braking within the accretion column , and the dynamical timescales of the accretion disk . in agreement with previous measurements ,",
    "we see an anticorrelation of the fundamental cyclotron line energy with the luminosity .",
    "we also find that the x - ray spectra are well described by an optically thick comptonization model where the electron plasma is more efficiently cooled through compton down - scattering as the outburst progresses .",
    "we track v0332 + 53 along its path on a hardness - intensity diagram throughout the outburst , observing clear indications of hysteresis ( i.e. , a softening of the spectrum ) during the outburst .",
