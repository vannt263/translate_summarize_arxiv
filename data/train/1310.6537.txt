    "the preparation of a specific quantum state is a highly nontrivial task .",
    "if the quantum dynamics is purely hamiltonian , it requires the control hamiltonian to be conditioned on the ( possibly unknown ) initial state of the system in order to end up in the desired target state . an alternative route",
    "to prepare quantum states is thus to rely on dissipation , driving the system state into a unique fixed point of the dynamics . in many experimental setups",
    "this has been accomplished by cooling the system down to its ground state .",
    "dissipative state preparation schemes instrumentalize this approach in a systematic way .",
    "the idea is to engineer the coupling of an open quantum system to its environment such that any desired target state becomes the unique stationary state of the system dynamics .",
    "if one has set up these couplings properly , one then must simply wait : any initial state is eventually attracted by the desired target state .    in principle",
    ", any pure state can be prepared dissipatively @xcite .",
    "the preparation of a pure , entangled state in a multipartite quantum system , however , requires the engineering of dissipative processes that jointly act on more than one party .",
    "while such a constructive scheme can be realized under very specific , highly engineered experimental conditions @xcite , it poses insurmountable challenges for generic multicomponent quantum systems .",
    "this severely constrains the practicability of environment engineering for entanglement control .    in the present work ,",
    "we therefore avoid engineered dissipative processes and rely , instead , on _ naturally _ occurring incoherent processes to prepare entanglement .",
    "no elaborate experimental control over the environment will be required .",
    "this obvious benefit comes at a price : in general , natural dissipation is of _ local _ nature , i.e. , it acts individually on each party of a composite quantum system .",
    "therefore , in contrast to engineered , nonlocal dissipation , it always acts adversely to entanglement . under these circumstances ,",
    "only the coherent part of the time evolution , i.e. , the system hamiltonian , can create entanglement .",
    "the aim of this work therefore is to investigate to what extent entanglement can then still be preserved in the stationary state . in particular , we seek to identify those system hamiltonians which yield the most entangled stationary state for given ( local ) dissipative dynamics .",
    "our agenda is hence to determine the prospects and limitations of entanglement control in the presence of local dissipation .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ sec : theory ] , we review the general concept of dissipative state preparation and discuss the consequences of resorting to strictly local dissipative processes . from sec .  [",
    "sec : statistics ] onward , we consider the most prominent example of a natural dissipative process , namely the spontaneous decay in two - level systems ( qubits ) .",
    "first , we study typical stationary states by drawing from an ensemble of random hamiltonians and compare them to the most entangled state among _ all conceivable _ stationary states ; the latter was derived by us previously @xcite . in sec .",
    "[ sec : optimalh ] , we explicitly provide the hamiltonian that leads to this optimal stationary state and discuss its experimental implementation .",
    "a generalization to the case of many qubits follows .",
    "finally , we conclude in sec .",
    "[ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "throughout this paper , we consider open quantum systems that evolve under a master equation of lindblad form @xcite : @xmath1 + \\sum_{k } { \\mathcal{d}}_k(\\rho ) \\quad\\quad ( \\textrm{with } \\hbar\\equiv 1).\\ ] ] the hamiltonian @xmath2 governs the coherent part of the evolution of the quantum state @xmath3 , whereas each @xmath4 describes an incoherent process , defined through a lindblad operator @xmath5 and a respective rate @xmath6 : @xmath7.\\ ] ] together , the incoherent terms define the _ dissipator _ @xmath8 .      in a dissipative state preparation scheme @xcite ,",

    "this defines , hence , a convenient preparation scheme for @xmath10 .",
    "if no restrictions are imposed on the lindblad operators @xmath5 and the hamiltonian @xmath2 , there exsists a straightforward procedure to state @xmath2 and @xmath9 such that an arbitrary pure state @xmath12 of an @xmath0 qubit quantum register results as the unique stationary state of @xmath13 @xcite : first , one chooses the hamiltonian such that @xmath14 is an eigenstate , @xmath15 = 0.\\ ] ] in a second step , one engineers the incoherent processes such that @xmath16 where @xmath17 denotes the operator @xmath18 of spontaneous decay of the @xmath19th qubit and @xmath20 is a unitary transformation defined by @xmath21 .",
    "the working principle of this scheme becomes apparent in a rotated reference frame , defined by @xmath22 . in this frame",
    ", @xmath23 is a stationary state of , because it is an eigenstate of @xmath24 , and it is annihilated by any @xmath25 .",
    "moreover , @xmath23 is the unique stationary state in the rotated frame @xcite .",
    "consequently , @xmath26 is the unique stationary state in the original frame .    as a major difficulty of this scheme ,",
    "however , the involved dissipative processes are not naturally given , but have to be designed artificially .",
    "in particular , an entangled target state @xmath14 requires the engineering of nonlocal lindblad operators .",
    "is not connected to @xmath23 via a local unitary transformation , the transformation @xmath20 does not factorize w.r.t . to the different qubits . as a consequence , at least some of the lindblad operators @xmath27",
    "act non - trivially on more than one subsystem , and hence describe non - local incoherent processes .",
    "in fact , the more sophisticated the desired kind of entanglement , the more lindblad operators must be engineered in a non - local fashion , since all the entanglement properties of @xmath14 are encoded in @xmath20 .",
    "e.g. , if one wants to entangle only two out of @xmath0 qubits , say @xmath28 , then only @xmath29 and @xmath30 are non - local , while the remaining @xmath5 s are just @xmath17 . on the other hand ,",
    "if one wants to prepare a ( linear or 2d ) @xmath0-qubit cluster state , all @xmath0 lindblad operators become non - local @xcite . ]",
    "this is , in general , an exceedingly difficult task in realistic setups . and",
    "even if such engineering is achieved , additional , uncontrolled dissipative processes remain unavoidable",
    ". they will compete with the engineered processes and reduce the performance of the preparation scheme .    in view of these obstacles , we investigate here the potential of employing naturally occurring incoherent processes for preparing entangled states , instead of resorting to artificially engineered ones . in this approach , no experimental control over the incoherent dynamics is required ; consequently , the natural incoherent processes do not compete with any expensively engineered ones , but are themselves an essential driving force of the preparation scheme .",
    "a generic property of most natural dissipative processes is their local nature .",
    "this implies that the corresponding lindblad operators @xmath5 have a strictly local structure , @xmath31 where @xmath32 acts only on the @xmath19th subsystem .    at first glance",
    ", the goal to prepare entangled target states with strictly local lindblad operators seems counterintuitive : local lindblad operators necessarily tend to a _ decrease _ of entanglement in time @xcite ",
    "so why should the stationary state exhibit finite entanglement ?",
    "this objection is resolved by recognizing that , besides the incoherent part of the dynamics , there is also the coherent part , generated by the hamiltonian @xmath2 . if @xmath2 consists of strictly local terms as well , it is easy to see that the stationary state is not entangled , as shown in appendix  [ sec : appendixproofs].[ssec : appendixproof1 ] .",
    "but if @xmath2 comprises nonlocal terms ( i.e. , interactions between the different local sites ) this is not necessarily true .",
    "the subject of the present paper is , hence , to find the optimal @xmath2 such that the stationary state is entangled in the strongest possible way .",
    "as a first result in this regard , we exclude the possibility to prepare _ pure _ entangled target states with a local dissipator :    [ [ section ] ]    _ be @xmath12 a pure state of @xmath0 qubits that is stationary state under the master equation . if one of the lindblad operators @xmath33 has the local structure , then @xmath14 is separable with respect to the @xmath19th qubit .",
    "_    a proof of this statement given in appendix  [ sec : appendixproofs].[ssec : appendixproof2 ] .",
    "note that the statement is independent of the presence of additional ( possibly non - locally engineered ) lindblad operators .",
    "it implies , in particular , separability of @xmath14 with respect to _ every _ bipartition , if there is at least one local @xmath33 for each qubit . hence , under these circumstances , a stationary state @xmath3 can not be pure and entangled at the same time .",
    "( if only one qubit is affected by dissipation , however , @xmath14 can very well be entangled with respect to the remaining qubits , as explicitly shown in an example in appendix  [ sec : appendixexamplepsient ] . ) the above statement curbs , in conclusion , the expectation to prepare pure entangled target states .",
    "it makes , however , no statement about _ mixed _ , stationary states .",
    "in fact , in the state space of all quantum states , there are weakly mixed states in the vicinity of any pure , maximally entangled state .",
    "one of the questions tackled in this work is whether such weakly mixed , highly entangled states can become stationary states under local dissipation , or whether there is a fundamental threshold that limits the entanglement of the accessible stationary states to a submaximal value .",
    "let us summarize our discussion so far : dissipative state preparation schemes employ dissipation for entanglement creation , rather than considering it as adverse . to this end ,",
    "usually both the incoherent and the coherent part of the dynamics ( represented by the lindblad operators @xmath5 and hamiltonian @xmath2 , respectively ) are engineered in a non - local fashion . as a result , both of them can act in favor of entanglement production .",
    "this way , any pure state can become the unique stationary state of the dynamics .",
    "in contrast , we focus on naturally occurring , _ local _ incoherent processes , which therefore are necessarily detrimental for entanglement . these compete with the coherent dynamics , which may include interactions between the local sites and can thus build up entanglement .",
    "this results in a stationary state that is either mixed or separable ( with respect to any site that undergoes a local incoherent process ) .",
    "however , the incoherent part of the time evolution has a second important role for dissipative state preparation , which remains untouched : it leads to a _",
    "unique _ stationary state , ensuring that any initial condition eventually evolves into the target state .",
    "this task can not be accomplished by coherent dynamics alone .",
    "in the following section , we focus on the most prominent example of a naturally occurring incoherent process : the omnipresent spontaneous decay of two - level systems with a decay rate @xmath34 .",
    "thus , we consider two qubits , with a single lindblad operator per site : @xmath35 in this case , the stationary state @xmath10 of the dynamics is unique , irrespectively of the hamiltonian @xmath2 @xcite",
    ". nevertheless , @xmath10 itself depends on the particular choice of @xmath2 .",
    "the task is hence to find the @xmath2 that results in the optimally entangled @xmath10 .",
    "there are several ways to quantify entanglement between two qubits .",
    "one possibility is to employ an entanglement measure , such as the _ concurrence _",
    "@xcite , which takes values between zero ( for separable states ) and one ( for maximally entangled states ) .",
    "if one is not only interested in high values of entanglement alone , but rather wants to specifically create one of the four maximally entangled bell states , @xmath37 the _ bell state fidelities _",
    "@xmath38 are alternative quantities of interest , ranging likewise from zero to one .",
    "their value is directly related to the fidelity of a teleportation protocol via the state @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "we will consider both , concurrence and fidelities , as entanglement quantifiers in the following .      to gain first insight on how much entanglement can be preserved in the stationary state in the presence of spontaneous decay , we consider the exemplary hamiltonian of two qubits with ising interaction @xcite , @xmath39 with local energy splitting @xmath40 and interaction strength @xmath41 .",
    "the stationarity condition can in this case be solved explicitly for the stationary state @xmath10 @xcite : @xmath42 with @xmath43 .",
    "since this state is of `` x form '' @xcite , there is a simple expression for its concurrence : @xmath44 for the bell state fidelities , one obtains @xmath45 in the limit of strong interaction [ @xmath46 , i.e. , @xmath47 , the stationary state approaches the completely mixed state @xmath48 , which is not entangled and has poor bell state fidelities @xmath49 . in the opposite case of weak interaction [ @xmath50 , i.e. , @xmath51 , we have @xmath52 , which is not entangled , either , with bell state fidelities @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "maximizing expression leads to an optimal concurrence value of @xmath55 , which is reached at the golden ratio @xmath56 , i.e. , at @xmath57 .",
    "likewise , the optimal fidelities are @xmath58 for @xmath59 , and @xmath60 for @xmath61 . fig .  [",

    "[ ssec : mcsampling ] ) .",
    "it is interesting to repeat this analysis for the xxz heisenberg interaction @xcite , i.e. , for @xmath65 for any choice of the anisotropy factor @xmath66 , the steady state of the master equation is then simply the de - excited state @xmath67 .",
    "this is because the deexcited state is annihilated by both lindblad operators @xmath29 and @xmath30 from eq .  , and it commutes with the hamiltonian .",
    "qubits , so that the steady state is always the de - excited state @xmath68 . ] due to the fact that the stationary state is unique with the given lindblad operators , and that the deexcited state is obviously not entangled , we conclude that the xxz heisenberg interaction never leads to stationary entanglement .    in summary , for two qubits with the ising hamiltonian and local spontaneous decay",
    ", it is not possible to achieve a stationary state that exceeds the values of @xmath69 , @xmath70 and @xmath60 , no matter how one adjusts the parameters @xmath40 and @xmath41 of the hamiltonian in comparison to the dissipation rate @xmath34 .",
    "the heisenberg interaction , on the other hand , leads to no stationary entanglement at all . in the following ,",
    "we investigate systematically whether there are hamiltonians which perform better than that .      as a first step towards a systematic search for the optimal hamiltonian , we study an ensemble of random hamiltonians @xmath2 and investigate the distribution of the concurrence of the resulting stationary states .",
    "this way , we explore the entanglement properties of _ typical _ stationary states .",
    "the hamiltonian is drawn from the gaussian unitary ensemble ( gue ) @xcite ; i.e. , we set @xmath71 , where @xmath72 and @xmath73 are real @xmath74 matrices with random entries that are independently drawn from a standard normal distribution . the parameter @xmath41 thus defines the energy scale of the hamiltonian .",
    "however , since the stationarity condition is independent of a scaling factor , the only parameter that determines the stationary state is the ratio @xmath62 , describing the relative strength of coherent and dissipative dynamics .    for different values of @xmath62",
    ", we generated @xmath75 realizations of @xmath2 .",
    "for each @xmath2 , we obtained the corresponding stationary state @xmath10 by numerically solving and calculated the concurrence @xmath76 and the fidelities @xmath77 and @xmath78 .",
    "[ fig : varygamma ] shows the results as a function of @xmath62 on the abscissa .",
    "the gray scale indicates , on a logarithmic scale , the probability density to find a certain value of the quantity of interest in the ensemble .",
    "hence , each column of the plots represents a histogram of the concurrence or of the fidelity at a fixed value of @xmath62 .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^ \" , ]     the solid and dashed red curves visualize the analytical results and obtained for the ising hamiltonian .",
    "regarding its ability to generate entangled stationary states , this hamiltonian appears as a generic member of the gue .",
    "e.g. , the statistical ensemble achieves the highest concurrence value of @xmath79 when coherent and dissipative dynamics are of comparable strength , i.e. , around @xmath80  similar to the ising hamiltonian , which reaches @xmath81 at @xmath82 ( for @xmath63 ) . for weak coherent dynamics , @xmath83 , the stationary state approaches the deexcited state @xmath84 , independently of the hamiltonian .",
    "hence , the concurrence of both the statistical ensemble and the ising hamiltonian vanish in this limit , whereas the bell state fidelities approach @xmath85 and @xmath86 .",
    "the most important conclusion to be drawn from fig .",
    "[ fig : varygamma ] , however , is that typical stationary states yield concurrence @xmath87 with vanishing probability , irrespectively of @xmath62 .",
    "the value of @xmath88 derived for the ising hamiltonian is therefore close to the maximal entanglement that can be expected for a generic stationary state .",
    "the same holds for the @xmath89-fidelity : the random ensemble does not exceed the threshold @xmath90 of the ising hamiltonian . only for the @xmath91-fidelity , the ensemble significantly outperforms the ising hamiltonian and reaches up to @xmath92",
    ".      the foregoing statistical investigation of typical stationary states can not exclude the existence of atypical stationary states with better entanglement properties .",
    "therefore , we derive in the following the most entangled state @xmath93 among _ all conceivable _ stationary states that can emerge in the presence of spontaneous decay .",
    "this is achieved with a general method to solve optimization problems for the stationary state of open quantum systems , which was presented in @xcite . in the following , we briefly recapitulate the main ideas of this method .    the standard procedure to find the stationary state @xmath93 that maximizes an objective function @xmath94  in our case the concurrence or the bell state fidelity  for given dissipative dynamics ( here , spontaneous decay ) requires two steps : first , one inverts the stationarity condition , such that the stationary state becomes a function of the hamiltonian , @xmath95 .",
    "second , one optimizes the objective @xmath96 over all conceivable hamiltonians @xmath2 .",
    "this procedure , however , has two drawbacks : first , @xmath97 can in general only be inverted by numerical means .",
    "second , the set of hamiltonians is unbounded , rendering the maximization difficult .",
    "therefore , we have developed a different method to tackle such optimization problems @xcite .",
    "the core idea is to optimize the quantity of interest @xmath94 over the set of _ stabilizable states _",

    "every state @xmath102 corresponds to a suitable hamiltonian @xmath2 that renders this particular state stationary .",
    "the set of stabilizable states @xmath98 itself , however , does not depend on the hamiltonian , but is exclusively determined by the dissipator @xmath101 .    as an advantage of this approach , the set @xmath98",
    ", being a subset of the state space @xmath100 , is a bounded set .",
    "this facilitates the optimization procedure .",
    "moreover , for a given state @xmath102 , it is possible to solve the stationarity condition for the corresponding hamiltonian @xmath2 in a systematic way : taking the spectral decomposition @xmath103 , and `` sandwiching '' eq . with eigenstates @xmath104 from the left and @xmath105 from the right ,",
    "one arrives at @xmath106 for @xmath107 , this leads to @xmath108 on the other hand , if @xmath109 , the dissipative matrix element @xmath110 must vanish , implying that the hamiltonian matrix element @xmath111 can be chosen arbitrarily .",
    "note that this is in particular the case for the diagonal elements @xmath112 .",
    "hence , given a stabilizable state @xmath113 , the corresponding hamiltonian is @xmath114 with arbitrary elements @xmath115 ( fulfilling @xmath116 ) .",
    "to characterize the set of stabilizable states @xmath98 , one can exploit the fact that the coherent part of the evolution , generated by @xmath117 $ ] , induces strictly unitary dynamics , which leaves the spectrum @xmath118 of @xmath3 invariant .",
