    "hence , @xmath600 and @xmath601 .",
    "this proves and , consequently , .",
    "although @xmath602 is only a set for @xmath36 , we shell use the ordering @xmath603 induced by @xmath604 on it as follows : for @xmath605 , @xmath606 as a consequence of , we have that @xmath607      next , for @xmath9 , we define a relation @xmath611 on the set @xmath612 as follows : for eligible triplets @xmath613 , @xmath614 clearly , @xmath615 is a quasiorder .",
    "the set of least elements of @xmath616 will be denoted by @xmath617 .",
    "similarly , @xmath618 will stand for the set of largest elements . and make it clear that @xmath619 it also follows from that these sets are nonempty , because @xmath620 since @xmath428 in @xmath572 , the distinguished eligible triplets @xmath621 hence , for @xmath9 , definition  [ deflofquord ] allows us to consider the quasi - colored lattice @xmath622 for @xmath123 , @xmath623 and @xmath624 are only maps between two sets .",
    "however , and , respectively , allow us to guess that these maps are monotone ; these properties are conveniently formulated in the form below and later .",
    "first , we claim that for @xmath25 and @xmath38 , @xmath625 to show this , assume that @xmath626 such that @xmath627 . by ,",
    "@xmath628 . since @xmath629 is a monotone map , @xmath630 .",
    "hence , by , we have that @xmath631 .",
    "thus , applying for @xmath632 and @xmath633 , @xmath634 which proves .",
    "second , we are going to show that for @xmath25 and @xmath38 , @xmath635 so let @xmath25 and @xmath38 . since @xmath3 is a natural transformation by theorem  [ thmcat ] , the diagram @xmath636 commutes .",
    "that is , for every @xmath637 , @xmath638 assume that @xmath639 . by , @xmath640 . by",
    ", this gives that @xmath641 .",
    "combining this inequality with and , we obtain that @xmath642 , proving .",
    "our next task is to show that @xmath643 assume that @xmath644 . by , @xmath645 .",
    "since @xmath646 , @xmath632 is @xmath179-preserving . hence , by and , @xmath647 by , this means that @xmath648 .",
    "this proves the first half of ; the second half follows in the same way .",
    "now , we are in the position to define a functor @xmath649 as follows . for @xmath9 and @xmath650 , we let @xmath651 it follows from , , , and that lemma  [ lemmahomomain ] is applicable .",
    "we are going to show that @xmath238 is a functor from @xmath0 to @xmath165 .",
    "by lemma  [ keylemma ] , definition  [ deflofquord ] , and , we have that @xmath652 . by lemma  [ lemmahomomain ] ,",
    "if @xmath654 , then @xmath624 is the identity map since @xmath655 is a functor , and it follows from and the uniqueness part of lemma  [ lemmahomomain ] that @xmath656 is the identity map @xmath657 .",
    "finally , assume that @xmath101 , @xmath658 , and @xmath659 .",
    "we have to show that @xmath660 . by and",
    "the uniqueness part of lemma  [ lemmahomomain ] , it suffices to show that @xmath661 for all eligible triplets @xmath662 , and similarly for @xmath375 . by and",
    ", we have the following rule of computation : @xmath663 we know that @xmath655 , as composite of three functors , is a functor",
    ". therefore , @xmath664 . using this equality and",
    ", we have @xmath665 thus , holds , and @xmath666 is a functor , as required .    clearly , the composite of faithful or totally faithful functors is a faithful or totally faithful functor , respectively . by theorem",
    "[ thmcat ] , @xmath1 is totally faithful .",
    "so is @xmath593 .",
    "therefore , @xmath667 is faithful , and it is totally faithful if so is @xmath215 .",
    "hence , it follows from that @xmath238 is faithful .",
    "furthermore , if @xmath215 is totally faithful and @xmath668 , then the same property of @xmath655 gives that @xmath669 is distinct from @xmath670 .",
    "hence , it follows from remark  [ remstrongfaithfconstr ] and that @xmath671 .",
    "consequently , @xmath238 is totally faithful if so is @xmath215 .",
    "finally , we are going to prove that @xmath238 lifts @xmath215 with respect to @xmath180 .",
    "the isomorphism provided by corollary  [ corolxilemma ] will be denoted by @xmath672 .",
    "that is , @xmath673 is an order isomorphism .",
    "the map @xmath674 from definition  [ defcomet ] is monotone by .",
    "this map is surjective , because @xmath675 holds for every @xmath676 , that is , @xmath677 .",
    "furthermore , if @xmath678 , then @xmath679 by , which means that the ordering @xmath603 equals the @xmath116-image of @xmath611 .",
    "hence , using a well - known fact about orders induced by quasiorders , the map @xmath680 is an order isomorphism .",
    "so is its inverse map , @xmath681 since @xmath682 , defined by @xmath683 , is also an isomorphism by , the composite @xmath684 of the two isomorphisms is also an order isomorphism .",
    "so we can let@xmath685 from @xmath686 to @xmath687 by and . as the last part of the proof , we are going to show that @xmath688 is a natural isomorphism . by",
    ", we only have to show that it is a natural transformation . to do so , assume that @xmath25 and @xmath38 .",
    "besides @xmath629 and @xmath623 , we will use the notation @xmath689 .",
    "we have to show that the diagram @xmath690 commutes .",
    "first , we investigate the map @xmath691 . for a triplet @xmath692 ,",
    "we have that @xmath693 by .",
    "analogously , @xmath694 . therefore ,",
    "applying the definition of @xmath180 for the @xmath163-lattice homomorphism @xmath695 , see and , we have that @xmath696 consider an arbitrary @xmath697 . by , , and , @xmath698 hence , yields that @xmath699 on the other hand , using for @xmath12 and @xmath700 instead of @xmath11 and @xmath387 , @xmath701 we are going to verify that and give the same principal congruences .",
    "motivated by ( c[labqa ] ) , we focus on the colors of the respective ordered pairs that generate these two principal congruences . by the construction of our quasi - colored lattices , see figure  [ fig - m33 ] and , these colors are @xmath702 , in , and @xmath703 , in . by , , and , @xmath704 hence , yields that @xmath705 and @xmath706 .",
    "thus , we conclude from ( c[labqa ] ) that and are the same principal congruences , which means that the diagram given in commutes .",
