    "the momentum of light in a medium is a fundamental question and has kept attracting extensive interest @xcite .",
    "there are different ways to define the light momentum , which all have their own merits @xcite .",
    "however in this paper , the light momentum is defined as single photon s momentum or electromagnetic ( em ) momentum . according to this definition ,",
    "the single photon s momentum and energy are the direct result of einstein light - quantum hypothesis of em momentum and energy .",
    "the plane - wave model is the simplest physical model for studying light momentum , and it can be strictly treated mathematically in the maxwell - equation frame ; however , the physical results obtained are fundamental . for example , the lorentz transformation of photon density in the isotropic - fluid model treated by sophisticated field theory is exactly the same as that in the plane - wave model @xcite .    as a fundamental hypothesis in the special theory of relativity",
    ", the principle of relativity requires that the laws of physics be the same in form in all inertial frames of reference .",
    "therefore , all inertial frames are equivalent and there is no preferred inertial frame for descriptions of physical phenomena . for example , maxwell equations , fermat s principle , and the conservation laws of global momentum and energy are all valid in any inertial frames , no matter whether the medium is moving or at rest , and no matter whether the space is partially or fully filled with a medium .",
    "for an ideal plane wave ( phase velocity equal to group velocity or energy velocity ) , the phase function characterizes the propagation of energy and momentum of light .",
    "( 1 ) the light momentum is parallel to the wave vector , and ( 2 ) the phase function is a lorentz invariant . as physical laws , according to the principle of relativity , the above two basic properties are valid in any inertial frames . from this",
    "we can conclude that the correct light momentum and energy must constitute a lorentz covariant four - vector , and the minkowski s momentum is the unique correct light momentum @xcite",
    ".    why should the light momentum be parallel to the wave vector ? conceptually speaking , the direction of photon propagation is the direction of photon s momentum and energy propagation .",
    "the plane - wave phase function defines all equi - phase planes of motion , with the wave vector as their normal vector . from one equi - phase plane to another equi - phase plane , the path parallel to the normal vector is the shortest .",
    "fermat s principle indicates that , light follows the path of least time .",
    "thus the direction of photon propagation must be parallel to the wave vector , and so must the light momentum .",
    "the phase function is lorentz symmetric , namely it has exactly the same form in all inertial frames .",
    "consequently , this property of light momentum must be valid in all inertial frames .",
    "in a recent letter by barnett @xcite , a widely - accepted total - momentum model is analyzed for resolution of the abraham - minkowski debate , where both abraham s and minkowski s momentums are shown to be the correct light momentums , with the former being the kinetic momentum and the latter the canonical momentum .    in this paper , by analyzing the total momentum model @xcite with the principle of relativity for a dielectric - medium einstein - box thought experiment ( also called `` balazs thought experiment '' ) @xcite , it is shown that the abraham s momentum and energy in a medium can not constitute a lorentz four - vector , and they consequentially break the global momentum and energy conservation laws when a photon enters the medium box from vacuum .",
    "accordingly , it is not justifiable to take the abraham s momentum as the correct light momentum .",
    "in contrast , minkowski s momentum and energy always constitute a lorentz four - vector no matter whether in a medium or in vacuum ; thus the minkowski s momentum is the unique correct light momentum .",
    "a new kind of mass , momentum - associated photon mass in a medium is exposed , which explains why the abraham s momentum is obtained in the traditional `` center - of - mass - energy '' analysis of this thought experiment @xcite .",
    "the em boundary - condition matching approach , combined with einstein light - quantum hypothesis , is proposed to analyze this thought experiment , and it is found for the first time that only from maxwell equations without resort to the principle of relativity , the correctness of light momentum definitions can not be identified .",
    "optical pulling effect is studied as well .",
    "as a physical law , according to the principle of relativity , the total momentum model @xcite should be valid in any inertial frames . when applying this model to the einstein - box thought experiment , with a slightly different process from that in @xcite , where a single photon has entered a block of transparent medium with a dimension much larger than the photon s wavelength , observed in the medium - rest frame the total momentum is equal to abraham s photon momentum , because the medium kinetic momentum is zero .",
    "however , as shown in appendix [ appa ] , the abraham s photon momentum can not be used to constitute a lorentz covariant momentum - energy four - vector ; consequently , the total momentum can not either . similarly , observed in the lab frame ,",
    "the momentum and energy of the medium box independently constitute a four - vector while the abraham s photon momentum and energy do not .",
    "thus the four - vector lorentz covariance of the total momentum and energy is questionable . + it is a well - known postulate that the total ( global ) momentum and energy are conservative for an isolated physical system @xcite , which is valid in all inertial frames .",
    "the photon and the medium box form an isolated system in the einstein - box thought experiment .",
    "based on the lorentz property of abraham s photon momentum , we have shown in above that the total momentum and energy can not constitute a lorentz four - vector after the photon has entered the medium box .",
    "in fact , by taking advantage of the initial conditions , we can further show that the abraham s photon momentum in a medium is not compatible with the momentum and energy conservation laws .",
    "the derivations are given below .",
    "+ ( 1 ) suppose that before the photon enters the medium box , the photon initially is located far away from the medium box in vacuum . thus initially",
    "the photon s abraham (= minkowski ) momentum and energy @xmath0 constitute a lorentz four - vector .",
    "+ ( 2 ) the medium box is made up of massive particles , and its kinetic momentum and energy @xmath1 constitute a lorentz four - vector no matter _ before or after _ the photon enters the medium box .",
    "+ ( 3 ) from ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) , initially the total momentum and energy constitute a four - vector , namely @xmath2 is a four - vector .",
    "+ ( 4 ) according to the momentum and energy conservation laws , the total momentums and energies are equal _ before _ and _ after _ the photon enters the box , namely @xmath3 from ( 3 ) , we know that @xmath4 is a four - vector , and thus @xmath5 also is a four - vector .",
    "further , because @xmath6   is a four - vector resulting from ( 2 ) ,  @xmath7 _ must _ be a four - vector .",
    "however @xmath7 _ can not _ be a four - vector according to the principle of relativity [ confer eq .",
    "( [ eqa3 ] ) in appendix [ appa ] ] .",
    "thus we conclude that the abraham s photon momentum contradicts the momentum and energy conservation laws in the principle - of - relativity frame , which means that the abraham s photon momentum can not make the conservation laws holding in all inertial frames  the direct physical consequences of abraham s light momentum .",
    "+ from the above relativity analysis of einstein - box thought experiment , we can see that the correct light momentum and energy must constitute a lorentz four - vector when the global momentum and energy conservation laws are taken to be the fundamental postulates @xcite , which actually is a criterion of identifying the correctness of light momentum definitions .",
    "this conclusion is completely in agreement with that obtained from a plane wave in a moving uniform medium @xcite , as stated in sec .",
    "i. + it is interesting to point out that , it is the fermat s principle and the principle of relativity that require the light momentum and energy to constitute a lorentz four - vector for a plane wave in a moving uniform medium where there is no momentum transfer taking place @xcite , while it is the global momentum and energy conservation laws that require the light momentum and energy to constitute a lorentz four - vector in the einstein - box thought experiment where there is a momentum transfer taking place when the photon goes into a medium box .",
    "it has been shown that the abraham s light momentum and energy for a plane wave in a uniform medium is not lorentz covariant @xcite .",
    "the plane wave is a strict solution of maxwell equations in the macro - scale electromagnetic theory , and this solution indicates that the minkowski s momentum density vector @xmath8 and energy density @xmath9 constitute a lorentz four - vector in the form of @xmath10 , with @xmath11 the `` em - field - cell density '' or `` photon density '' in volume @xcite , and @xmath12 the vacuum light speed .",
    "when einstein s light - quantum hypothesis @xmath13 is imposed , @xmath14 is restored to a single photon s momentum - energy four - vector , namely @xmath15 , with @xmath16 the wave vector ; thus @xmath8 denotes the unique correct light momentum . for the plane wave in a uniform medium , @xmath17 holds in all inertial frames , where @xmath18 is the refractive index and @xmath19 is the unit wave vector @xcite .",
    "now let us apply the minkowski s momentum to analysis of a plane - wave light pulse perpendicularly incident on the above transparent medium box without any reflection @xcite .",
    "the pulse space length is assumed to be much larger than the wavelength but less than the box length . to eliminate any reflection",
    ", the wave - impedance matching must be reached between vacuum and the medium @xcite , namely the wave impedance @xmath20 with @xmath21 and @xmath22 is continuous on the boundary ( confer fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] in appendix [ appb ] ) .",
    "since there is no reflection , there is no energy accumulation in the sense of time average .",
    "thus `` no - reflection '' can be expressed as `` equal energy flux density '' on the both sides of the vacuum - medium interface inside the light pulse , given by @xmath23 @xmath24    the above eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) is indeed equivalent to the wave - impedance matching condition @xmath25 when the perpendicularly - incident plane - wave boundary condition @xmath26 is considered , because in such a case we have @xmath27(\\mathbf{e}\\cdot\\mathbf{e})_{vac } \\vspace{2 mm }   \\\\ & = n_d(\\mathbf{d}\\cdot\\mathbf{e})_{vac } ,   \\end{array}\\ ] ] namely eq .",

    "( [ eq3 ] ) tells us that , after the minkowski s em momentum ( in unit area and unit time ) flows into the medium from vacuum , the momentum grows by @xmath18 times . to keep the total momentum unchanged",
    ", there must be a pulling force acting on the medium when the plane - wave light pulse goes into the medium box ( see appendix [ appb ] ) , which is the result from macro - electromagnetic theory based on the assumption of `` no reflection '' .",
    "this pulling force can be qualitatively explained as the lorentz force produced by the interaction of the dielectric bound current with the incident light pulse @xcite .",
    "now let us examine the result from einstein light - quantum theory .",
    "the photon energy ( frequency ) is supposed to be the same no matter whether in vacuum or in a medium .",
    "einstein light - quantum hypothesis requires that @xmath34 and @xmath35 , with @xmath36 the photon density in medium and @xmath37 the photon density in vacuum . inserting them into eq .",

    "( [ eq3 ] ) , we have the photon momentum in the medium , given by @xmath42 @xmath43    from eq .",
    "( [ eq6 ] ) we can see that when a single photon goes into the medium box , the medium box also gets a pulling force to keep the total momentum unchanged .    from eq .",
    "( [ eq3 ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ eq6 ] ) we find that a light pulse and a single photon in the medium - box thought experiment both have the pulling effect .",
    "how do we explain the fiber recoiling experiment then @xcite ? the recoiling could be resulting from the transverse radiation force because of an azimuthal asymmetry of refractive index in the fiber @xcite .",
    "it is worthwhile to point out that , the widely - recognized `` center of mass - energy '' argument for abraham s photon momentum @xcite is questionable .",
    "as shown in appendix [ appc ] , this argument neglects the difference between the `` momentum - associated mass '' and `` energy - associated mass '' for a photon in a medium . specifically speaking , this argument has implicitly assumed that the relation between photon s `` momentum - associated '' mass and its momentum in a dielectric is the same as that in vacuum .",
    "the photon momentum - associated mass in vacuum , formulated by @xmath44 , is derived from `` vacuum '' einstein - box thought experiment @xcite , and whether the formulation still holds in a `` dielectric '' remains to be confirmed .",
    "now that this assumption has already resulted in contradictions with the covariance of relativity , the justification of the assumption should be re - considered .",
    "in summary , by analysis of the total momentum model @xcite with the principle of relativity for a medium einstein - box thought experiment , we have shown that the abraham s light momentum and energy in a medium do not constitute a lorentz four - vector , and they break the global momentum - energy conservation law ; accordingly , it is not justifiable to take the abraham s momentum as the correct light momentum .",
    "in contrast , minkowski s momentum and energy always constitute a four - vector no matter whether in a medium or vacuum , and the minkowski s momentum is the unique correct light momentum .",
    "this result of the relativity principle is important , because only based on the maxwell equations one can not judge which formulation of light momentum is correct .",
    "for example , inserting @xmath45 and @xmath46 into eq .",
    "( [ eq3 ] ) , we directly obtain the conversion equation for abraham s momentum flux density from vacuum to medium , given by @xmath47   \\nonumber \\\\ & = \\frac{1}{n_d}[(\\mathbf{e}\\times\\mathbf{h}/c^2)_{vac}\\cdot c\\mathbf{\\hat{n } } ] , \\label{eq7}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and  similarly ,  inserting  @xmath48 , @xmath49 , and @xmath50 into above eq .",
    "( [ eq7 ] ) , we have the abraham s photon momentum in medium , given by @xmath51 @xmath52 thus in the maxwell - equation frame , the medium einstein - box thought experiment supports both light momentum formulations , instead of just abraham s @xcite",
    ". however , the two formulations can not be `` both correct '' ; otherwise it is not determinate whether the medium box gets a pulling force or a pushing force when a specific photon goes into the medium from vacuum .",
    "in other words , without resort to the principle of relativity , this thought experiment can not be used to identify the correctness of light momentum definitions .",
    "in this appendix , by analysis of the lorentz property of the total momentum model in the dielectric - medium einstein - box thought experiment @xcite , a specific proof is given of why the abraham s photon momentum and energy can not constitute a lorentz four - vector .    according to the total - momentum model @xcite , the total momentum and the total energy",

    "<S> a momentum - associated photon mass in a medium is exposed , which explains why only the abraham s momentum is derived in the traditional `` center - of - mass - energy '' approach . </S>",
    "<S> the em boundary - condition matching approach , combined with einstein light - quantum hypothesis , is proposed to analyze this thought experiment , and it is found for the first time that only from maxwell equations without resort to the relativity , the correctness of light momentum definitions can not be identified . </S>",
