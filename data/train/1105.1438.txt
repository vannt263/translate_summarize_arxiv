    "a three - level laser is a quantum optical system in which light is generated by three - level atoms inside a cavity usually coupled to a vacuum reservoir . in one model of a such laser ,",
    "three - level atoms initially prepared in a coherent superposition of the top and bottom levels are injected into a cavity and then removed after they have decayed due to spontaneous emission [ 1,2 ] . in another model ,",
    "the top and bottom levels of the three - level atoms injected into a cavity are coupled by coherent light [ 3,4 ] .",
    "the statistical and squeezing properties of the light generated by three - level lasers have been investigated by several authors [ 5 - 11 ] .",
    "it is found that a three - level laser in either model generates squeezed light under certain conditions .",
    "it appears to be quite difficult to prepare the atoms in a coherent superposition of the top and bottom levels before they are injected into the laser cavity .",
    "in addition , it should certainly be hard to find out that the atoms have decayed spontaneously before they are removed from the cavity .",
    "on the other hand , the degree of squeezing of the light generated by the three - level laser , with the top and bottom levels coupled by coherent light , is relatively large when the mean photon number is relatively small [ 4 ] .",
    "moreover , the quantum analysis of a three - level laser is usually carried out by including the interaction of the atoms inside the cavity with the vacuum reservoir outside the cavity",
    ". it may be possible to justify the feasibility of such interaction for a laser with an open cavity into which and from which atoms are injected and removed",
    ". however , there can not be any valid justification for leaving open the laser cavity in which the available atoms are pumped to the top level by electron bombardment .",
    "therefore , the aforementioned interaction is not feasible for a laser in which the atoms available in a closed cavity are pumped to the top level by means of electron bombardment .",
    "we seek here to analyze the quantum properties of the light emitted by the three - level atoms available in a closed cavity and pumped to the top level at a constant rate . thus taking into account the interaction of the three - level atoms with a resonant cavity light and the damping of the cavity light by a vacuum reservoir",
    ", we obtain the photon statistics of the cavity light and the quadrature squeezing of the cavity ( output ) light .",
    "we also determine the quadrature squeezing of the cavity ( output ) light in any frequency interval .",
    "we carry out our calculation by putting the noise operators associated with the vacuum reservoir in normal order and without considering the interaction of the three - level atoms with the vacuum reservoir outside the cavity .",
    "we consider here the case in which @xmath1 degenerate three - level atoms in cascade configuration are available in a closed cavity .",
    "we denote the top , middle , and bottom levels of these atoms by @xmath2 , @xmath3 , and @xmath4 , respectively .",
    "in addition , we assume the cavity mode to be at resonance with the two transitions @xmath5 and @xmath6 , with direct transition between levels @xmath2 and @xmath4 to be dipole forbidden .",
    "the interaction of one of the three - level atoms with the cavity mode can be described at resonance by the hamiltonian @xmath7,\\ ] ] where @xmath8 and @xmath9 are lowering atomic operators , @xmath10 is the annihilation operator for the cavity mode , and @xmath11 is the coupling constant between the atom and the cavity mode .",
    "we assume that the laser cavity is coupled to a vacuum reservoir via a single - port mirror .",
    "in addition , we carry out our calculation by putting the noise operators associated with the vacuum reservoir in normal order .",
    "thus the noise operators will not have any effect on the dynamics of the cavity mode operators .",
    "we can therefore drop the noise operator and write the quantum langevin equation for the operator @xmath10 as @xmath12,\\ ] ] where @xmath13 is the cavity damping constant . then with the aid of eq .",

    "( [ 7])-([12 ] ) are nonlinear differential equations and hence it is not possible to find exact time - dependent solutions of these equations .",
    "we intend to overcome this problem by applying the large - time approximation [ 12 ] . then using this approximation scheme",
    ", we get from eq .",

    "the three - level atoms available in the cavity are pumped from the bottom to the top level by means of electron bombardment .",
    "the pumping process must surely affect the dynamics of @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "if @xmath34 represents the rate at which a single atom is pumped from the bottom to the top level , then @xmath32 increases at the rate of @xmath35 and @xmath33 decreases at the same rate . in view of this , we rewrite eqs .",
