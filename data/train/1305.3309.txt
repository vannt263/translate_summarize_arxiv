    "the study of interface dynamics in a hele - shaw cell , where the fluids are confined between two closely spaced glass plates , has been a topic of great interest since the seminal work by taylor and saffman @xcite .",
    "more recently , the hele - shaw system was shown to have an integrable structure and to possess deep connections with other branches of mathematical physics @xcite .",
    "this rich mathematical structure lies behind the fact that numerous exact solutions have been obtained both for time - dependent interfaces ( listed in @xcite ) and for steady shapes ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "most of these exact solutions were obtained for situations where the flow domain is ( or can be mapped to ) a simply connected region .",
    "hele - shaw flows in multiply connected regions remain a problem of considerable difficulty and only a few solutions are known @xcite .",
    "one particular instance where multiply connected fluid domains naturally appear is in the case of multiple steady bubbles in a hele - shaw channel .",
    "this class of problems , besides being mathematically challenging , is also of practical interest in connection , for instance , with the problem of clustering in bubbly hele - shaw flows @xcite .",
    "periodic arrays of bubbles in a hele - shaw channel are also of interest in view of similar arrangements found in the flow of vesicles and red blood cells in microcapillaries @xcite . for example , the `` zigzag '' phase @xcite observed in the flow of red blood cells in microvessels has a counterpart in the hele - shaw system as a staggered two - file array of bubbles @xcite .    in the present paper we report exact solutions for a periodic stream of asymmetric bubbles steadily moving in a hele - shaw channel .",
    "because of the lack of symmetry , one has to deal with a fluid domain ( within a unit cell ) that is doubly connected .",
    "we tackle the problem by conformally mapping the fluid domain to an annulus in an auxiliary complex plane .",
    "an explicit solution for the bubble shape and the corresponding velocity potential is then obtained in terms of the generalized schwarz - christoffel formula for doubly connected domains , and several specific examples of bubble configurations are discussed .",
    "we emphasize that this is the first instance of exact solutions for completely asymmetric bubbles in a hele - shaw channel .",
    "it is worth noting that exact solutions for a single asymmetric bubble in a hele - shaw channel have been obtained by using either conformal mapping techniques @xcite  or riemann - hilbert methods @xcite . in this case , however , the bubble has fore - and - aft symmetry and so the flow region can effectively be reduced to a simply connected domain @xcite .",
    "solutions for multiple steady bubbles in an unbounded hele - shaw cell were reported in ref .",
    "@xcite ; here the bubbles also had fore - and - aft symmetry but the flow domain was multiply connected .",
    "an attempt at extending these solutions to include bubbles with no assumed symmetry in a channel was made in ref .  @xcite",
    "but it was subsequently found that part of the argument used there was not valid @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", it seems possible to extend the method presented herein to the case of a finite number of asymmetric bubbles in a hele - shaw channel .",
    "this requires conformal mappings between domains of arbitrary connectivity and will be presented elsewhere @xcite .",
    "we consider the problem of a periodic stream of bubbles moving with a constant velocity @xmath0 along the @xmath1-direction in a hele - shaw channel of width @xmath2 . as usual",
    ", we will work in a frame co - moving with the bubbles .",
    "the array of bubbles has a spanwise period denoted by @xmath3 , and in each period cell there are two bubbles that are mirror reflections of one another with respect to a midline perpendicular to the channel walls , chosen as the @xmath4 axis .",
    "this ensures that both the @xmath4 axis and the lateral edges , @xmath5 , of the period cell are equipotentials of the flow , which implies in turn that the problem can be reduced to a rectangular unit cell corresponding to one half , say the right half , of the original period cell ; see fig .",
    "[ fig:2a ] .",
    "we recall that the motion of a viscous fluid in a hele - shaw cell is governed by darcy s law , @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the gap between the cell plates , @xmath8 is the viscosity , and @xmath9 is the fluid pressure . since the fluid is incompressible , i.e. , @xmath10 , it follows that @xmath9 is a harmonic function @xmath11 .",
    "it is thus convenient to introduce the complex potential @xmath12 , where @xmath13 , @xmath14 is the velocity potential in the co - moving frame , and @xmath15 is the associated stream function . in terms of the complex potential @xmath16 the problem can be formulated as follows .",
    "now let @xmath17 be the domain occupied by the viscous fluid within the reduced cell and let @xmath18 be the bubble interface .",
    "the complex potential @xmath16 must then be analytic in the fluid domain @xmath17 and satisfy the following boundary conditions on @xmath19 : @xmath20 which follows from the combined facts that the bubble surface @xmath19 is a streamline of the flow , the pressure inside the bubble is constant ( taken to be zero ) , and surface tension effects are neglected .",
    "additional boundary conditions follow from the fact that the upper and lower edges of the unit cell are streamlines of the flow , that is , @xmath21 @xmath22 whereas the left and right edges of the unit cell are equipotentials:@xmath23 @xmath24 where @xmath25 is a real - valued constant whose value is related to the period @xmath26 and to the bubble area @xcite . the flow domain in the @xmath27-plane thus corresponds to a rectangle with a horizontal slit in its interior , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:2b ] .    to solve the free - boundary problem formulated in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : cc1])([eq : cc05 ] ) , it is convenient to introduce the following function : @xmath28 which corresponds to the complex potential in the lab frame . from the definition ( [ eq : tw ] ) and eqs .",
    "( [ eq : cc1])([eq : cc05 ] ) , it follows that @xmath29 satisfies the following boundary conditions : @xmath30 @xmath31 @xmath32 @xmath33 @xmath34 from these conditions , one sees that the flow domain in the @xmath35-plane is a rectangle with a vertical slit in its interior , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:2c ] .",
    "let us now consider the conformal mapping @xmath36 from an annulus , @xmath37 , in an auxiliary complex @xmath38-plane onto the fluid domain in the @xmath39-plane , in such a way that the inner circle , @xmath40 , is mapped to the bubble @xmath18 and the unit circle , @xmath41 , is mapped to the edges of our unit cell in the @xmath39-plane ; see fig .",
    "[ fig:2d ] .",
    "the corners of the rectangular cell in the @xmath39-plane are the pre - images of four points , denoted by @xmath42 , on the unit circle ( i.e. , @xmath43 , for @xmath44 ) .",
    "similarly , the rightmost , leftmost , topmost , and lowermost points on the bubble are the pre - images of four points @xmath45 on the inner circle ( i.e. , @xmath46 , for @xmath44 ) , as indicated in fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] .    defining the functions @xmath47",
    "it follows from ( [ eq : tw ] ) that the conformal mapping @xmath36 can be written as @xmath48 .",
    "\\label{eq : z}\\ ] ] we have thus reduced our original free - boundary problem to the more amenable problem of obtaining two analytic functions , @xmath49 and @xmath50 , that map an annulus onto respective rectangular domains with linear slits in their interior .",
    "the latter problem can conveniently be handled in terms of the generalized schwarz - christoffel formula for doubly connected domains , as discussed below .",
    "note furthermore that once the conformal mapping @xmath36 is known , the bubble shape can be readily computed in parametric form by setting : @xmath51 , for @xmath52 .",
    "since the conformal mapping @xmath53 maps an annulus in the @xmath38-plane onto a ( degenerate ) polygonal domain in the @xmath27-plane , an explicit solution for this mapping can be obtained by a direct application of the schwarz - christoffel formula for doubly connected regions @xcite . in this case , one finds that @xmath49 is given by the following expression : @xmath54 where @xmath55 and @xmath56 are complex constants , and the function @xmath57 is defined by @xmath58 note that the four factors of @xmath59 under the square root in ( [ eq : mapw ] ) ensure that each point @xmath42 is mapped to a right angle corner in the @xmath39-plane .",
    "similarly , the points @xmath60 and @xmath61 are mapped to the slit endpoints in the @xmath27-plane , as implied by the fact that @xmath62 at these two points .",
    "[ to see this , note that @xmath63 .",
    "the function @xmath57 is related to the jacobi elliptic functions but we shall not exhibit this relation here ; see , e.g. , @xcite . for later use , we list the following properties of @xmath57 that hold for @xmath41 : @xmath64 @xmath65 @xmath66 where the overline indicates complex conjugate .    to completely specify the solution for @xmath49 we need to determine the parameters appearing in eq .",
    "( [ eq : mapw ] ) . without loss of generality , we can set @xmath67 and @xmath68 , since this merely fixes the origin .",
    "now , recalling that the mapping function between a doubly connected domain and an annulus is uniquely defined up to a factor of modulus one @xcite , we can choose the constant @xmath56 to be purely imaginary , i.e. , @xmath69 , where @xmath70 is a real constant to be determined later .",
    "next , we note that there should be four free parameters corresponding to the four physical parameters of our solution , namely , the length @xmath26 of the unit cell , the centroid of the bubble , and the bubble area .",
    "the radius @xmath71 of the inner circle is one such free parameter , which mainly governs the bubble area . for convenience ,",
    "we choose the other three free parameters to be the points @xmath72 , @xmath73 , and @xmath74 on the unit circle .",
    "the remaining point @xmath75 is then determined by imposing the condition that the rectangle in the @xmath27-plane has the proper orientation .",
    "this can be done by requiring , for instance , that the upper edge of the unit cell in the @xmath27-plane is horizontal , a condition that can be written as @xmath76=0 \\quad\\mbox{on}\\quad \\zeta=\\exp(i \\theta ) , \\quad\\mbox{for}\\quad\\theta_2 < \\theta < \\theta_3 , \\label{eq : im1}\\ ] ] where @xmath77 .",
    "using the fact that @xmath78 on @xmath41 , eq .",
    "( [ eq : im1 ] ) becomes @xmath79 using eq .",
    "( [ eq : mapw ] ) and the relations ( [ eq : aux01 ] ) and ( [ eq : aux02 ] ) in the preceding equation , one obtains after straightforward algebra the following relation between the @xmath80 s : @xmath81 which can be solved for @xmath75 in terms of the other three ( freely specified ) parameters : @xmath82 , where we have used that @xmath83 , since @xmath84 .",
    "similarly , from the condition that the slit in the @xmath27-plane is horizontal , one obtains the following relation : @xmath85 = 0 \\quad\\text{for } \\quad \\zeta = qe^{i\\theta},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] or alternatively @xmath86 where we have used that @xmath78 and @xmath87 for @xmath88 . using eqs .",
    "( [ eq : mapw ] ) , ( [ eq : aux02 ] ) , and ( [ eq : aux03 ] ) in eq .  ( [ eq : bcn1 ] ) yields the relation @xmath89 we must also ensure single - valuedness of the function @xmath49 by applying the condition @xmath90 eqs .",
    "( [ eq : w01b ] ) and ( [ eq : w03 ] ) thus determine the parameters @xmath91 and @xmath92 .",
    "finally , the value of @xmath70 is determined by the following condition : @xmath93 as follows from fig .",
    "[ fig:2b ] .",
    "since the flow domain in the @xmath35-plane is a polygonal region with a vertical slit in its interior [ see fig .",
    "[ fig:2c ] ] , the function @xmath50 can also be obtained from the schwarz - christoffel formula : @xmath94 where , as before , we have chosen the pre - multiplying constant as purely imaginary , meaning that @xmath95 is a real constant .",
    "the requirement that the slit in the @xmath35-plane be vertical ( see fig .",
    "[ fig:2c ] ) yields the following relation : @xmath96 = 0 \\quad\\text{for } \\quad \\zeta = qe^{i\\theta},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] or alternatively @xmath97 now carrying out similar steps as those that led to eq .",
    "( [ eq : w01b ] ) from ( [ eq : bcn1 ] ) , one finds that @xmath98 which together with the single - valuedness condition , @xmath99 determine @xmath100 and @xmath101 .",
    "lastly , the constant @xmath95 is fixed by the condition @xmath102",
    "without loss of generality , we shall set @xmath103 and @xmath104 throughout this section",
    ". we also recall that solutions for any @xmath105 can be obtained by a proper rescaling of the solutions with @xmath106 @xcite .",
    "we shall thus restrict ourselves to the case @xmath106 .",
    "it is easy to verify that the general solution presented above reproduces , as a particular case , the solution obtained by burgess and tanveer @xcite for an infinite stream of symmetrical bubbles . to see this",
    ", it suffices to choose the four points @xmath42 to be symmetrically located with respect to the vertical and horizontal axes , i.e. , @xmath107 .",
    "one then finds that @xmath108 and @xmath109 , implying that the bubble is symmetric with respect both to the channel centerline and to the fore - and - aft direction , as in the burgess - tanveer solution @xcite .    ,",
    "@xmath110 , and @xmath111 , and the resulting period is @xmath112 , width=188 ]    = 0.87 , @xmath113=3.0 , @xmath114 , and @xmath71=0.5 .",
    "the resulting half - period is @xmath115.,width=188 ]    if one requires instead only that @xmath116 and @xmath117 , with no assumed relation between @xmath72 and @xmath73 , one obtains a stream of bubbles with fore - and - aft symmetry but no centerline symmetry .",
    "an example of this case is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] for @xmath118 , @xmath110 , and @xmath111 .",
    "( in this figure some streamlines of the flow are also shown for illustration purposes . )",
    "we note , in particular , that in the limit that the cell period goes to infinity , i.e. , @xmath119 , the family of solutions shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] reproduces the exact solutions for a single asymmetric bubble in a hele - shaw cell @xcite .",
    "the limit @xmath119 is accomplished in our formulation by setting @xmath120 and @xmath121 ; see fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] .",
    "similarly , a stream of bubbles with centerline symmetry ( but not with fore - and - aft symmetry ) is obtained by imposing the conditions : @xmath122 and @xmath123 .",
    "it is worth pointing out that solutions with either centerline or fore - and - aft symmetry can also be obtained by reducing the problem to a simply connected domain and applying the standard schwarz - christoffel formula @xcite .",
    "the formalism presented here , however , is more general in that it naturally accounts for asymmetric bubbles . indeed , if one chooses the parameters @xmath42 arbitrarily , i.e. , with no symmetry relations between them , then the resulting bubble has no symmetry whatsoever .",
    "one example of such solutions is shown in fig .  [ fig:4 ] for the parameters @xmath124=0.87 , @xmath113=3.0 , @xmath114 , and @xmath71=0.5 .",
    "we have presented an exact solution for a steady stream of asymmetric bubbles co - travelling in a hele - shaw channel . from the periodicity along the streamwise direction ,",
    "the original flow domain was reduced to a rectangular unit cell containing only one bubble .",
    "the complex potentials @xmath16 and @xmath125 in the co - moving frame and in the lab frame , respectively , were computed in terms of conformal mappings from an annulus in an auxiliary complex @xmath38-plane onto the respective flow domains in the @xmath27- and @xmath35-planes .",
    "both these domains turn out to be given by degenerate polygonal regions , so that the desired mappings could be constructed explicitly by making use of the schwarz - christoffel formula for doubly connected domains . as an important extension of the present work it would be interesting to consider periodic solutions with several ( asymmetric ) bubbles per unit cell , in which case one needs to employ the generalized schwarz - christoffel formula for polygonal domains of arbitrary connectivity .",
