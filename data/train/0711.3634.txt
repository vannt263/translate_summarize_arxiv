    "at metal surfaces there exist specific electronic states not present in the bulk , which can be classified as intrinsic ( crystal - induced ) surface states@xcite and image - potential ( rydberg - like ) states.@xcite intrinsic surface states are originated by the symmetry breaking at the surface , they have their maximum near the surface , and they are classified as tamm@xcite and shockley@xcite states ; in particular , intrinsic shockley surface states typically occur in the gap of free - electron - like s , p bands near the fermi level.@xcite image - potential states appear as a result of the self - interaction that an electron near the surface suffers from the polarization charge it induces at the surface , and they occur in the vacuum region of metal surfaces with a band gap near the vacuum level.@xcite    figure  [ fig : chulpot ] illustrates shockley and image - potential states in the gap of the @xmath2 projected band structure of the ( 100 ) and ( 111 ) surfaces of cu . if an electron or hole is added to the solid at one of these states , inelastic coupling of the excited quasiparticle with the crystal , which can be experimentally observed through a variety of spectroscopies,@xcite may occur through electron - electron ( e - e ) and electron - phonon ( e - ph ) scattering .",
    "the decay rate due to the e - ph interaction , which is relatively important only in the case of excited shockley holes near the fermi level , has been investigated recently by using the eliashberg function.@xcite accurate many - body calculations of the decay rate due to the e - e interaction were first carried out for image states on the ( 100 ) and ( 111 ) surfaces of cu.@xcite since then , many - body calculations of the e - e decay have been reported for a variety of simple , noble and transition metals .",
    "@xcite nevertheless , existing calculations have been typically performed within the @xmath3 approximation of many - body theory,@xcite with no inclusion of exchange and correlation ( xc ) effects .",
    "exceptions are ( i ) a calculation of the e - e decay rate of image states on the ( 100 ) and ( 111 ) surfaces of cu that incorporates xc effects in an adiabatic local - density approximation ( alda)@xcite and ( ii ) an approximate evaluation of the lifetime of shockley states in the noble metals that incorporates the exchange contribution to the self - energy.@xcite    in this paper , we report extensive calculations of the screened interaction , the self - energy , and the e - e inelastic lifetime of shockley and image states on the ( 100 ) and ( 111 ) surfaces of cu that go beyond the @xmath4 approximation .",
    "short - range xc effects are incorporated both in the description of the dynamical screening of the many - electron system [ we go beyond the random - phase approximation ( rpa ) in the evaluation of the screened interaction w ] and in the expansion of the electron self - energy in terms of @xmath5 [ we go beyond the @xmath0 approximation ] .",
    "this is the @xmath1 approximation of many - body theory,@xcite which treats on the same footing xc effects between pairs of electrons within the fermi sea ( screening electrons ) and between the excited electron and the fermi sea .",
    "mahan and sernelius@xcite showed that the inclusion , within the @xmath1 approximation , of the same vertex function in the screened interaction and the numerator of the self - energy yields results for the band - width of a homogeneous electron gas very similar to those obtained in the @xmath3 approximation , due to a large cancellation of vertex corrections .",
    "large cancellations were also observed to occur in the decay rates of image@xcite and bulk@xcite states in the noble metals , by incorporating xc effects in the alda . in the decay of low - energy bulk states below the vacuum level energy transfers @xmath6 are well below the fermi energy and momentum transfers @xmath7 are typically smaller than @xmath8 , @xmath9 being the magnitude of the fermi wave vector , so that one can safely assume that both @xmath10 and @xmath11 are small and xc effects can , therefore , be incorporated in the alda . however , in the case of shockley and image states the alda might lead to spurious results , due to the presence of small local values of the fermi wave vector in a region where the electron density is small .",
    "hence , here we use an adiabatic _ nonlocal _ xc kernel that accurately describes xc effects in the limit of a homogeneous electron gas of arbitrary density and which has been succesful in the description of the xc contribution to the jellium surface energy.@xcite    it has been argued in the past that a realistic first - principles description of the electronic band structure is of key importance in the determination of the inelastic lifetime of bulk electronic states in the noble metals.@xcite the main conclusion drawn in ref .",
    "was that in the case of the noble metals deviations from electron dynamics in a free gas of @xmath12 electrons mainly originate in the participation of @xmath13 electrons in the screening of electron - electron interactions .",
    "the role of occupied @xmath13 bands in the dynamics of excited surface - state electrons and holes on silver surfaces was later investigated via a polarizable medium giving rise to additional screening ,  @xcite and it was concluded that @xmath13 electrons do not participate significantly in the screening of the interaction between surface states ( which are located near the surface ) and the fermi gas of the solid.@xcite    in order to investigate the dynamics of shockley and image states on cu surfaces , we assume that the density of valence electrons in the solid varies only along the @xmath14 axis , which is taken to be normal to the surface . hence , our calculations start by solving the single - particle time - independent schrdinger equation of electrons moving in a physically motivated one - dimensional ( 1d ) model potential that is known to correcly reproduce the behaviour of @xmath12 valence states and accurately describes , in particular , the projected bulk band gap and the binding energy of the shockley and the first image state.@xcite the eigenfunctions and eigenvalues of such an effective single - particle hamiltonian are then used to compute the screened interaction , the @xmath1 self - energy , and the e - e decay rates of shockley and image states . for comparison ,",
    "we also compute @xmath3 , @xmath15 , and @xmath16 decay rates , with no inclusion of xc effects , with inclusion of xc effects beyond the rpa in the screened interaction @xmath5 alone , and with inclusion of xc effects beyond the @xmath3 in the expansion of the electron self - energy in terms of the rpa screened interaction @xmath17 , respectively .",
    "our results indicate that ( i ) although the use of the alda leads to spurious results for the screened interaction , a more realistic adiabatic _ nonlocal _ description of xc effects yields inelastic lifetimes of shockley and image states that esentially coincide with those obtained in the alda , and ( ii ) the overall effect of short - range xc is small and @xmath1 linewidths are close to their @xmath3 counterparts , as occurs in the case of low - energy bulk states.@xcite    the paper is organized as follows .",
