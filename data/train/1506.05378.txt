    "its proof is postponed until section [ sec : aind ] .",
    "[ thm : aind ] variables of the seed @xmath199 are algebraically independent .",
    "now we argue that as we keep applying the mutation sequences @xmath41 and @xmath42 , we keep getting seeds associated with narrow triangulations .",
    "this follows from the following lemma .",
    "assume a narrow triangulation @xmath38 contains diagonals @xmath189 , @xmath210 and @xmath211 .",
    "[ lem : locmut ] mutating all variables @xmath212 in @xmath190 results in the variables @xmath213 sitting on the diagonal @xmath214 of the narrow triangulation obtained from @xmath38 by changing one diagonal .",
    "let us identify @xmath215 with @xmath216 for any @xmath86 , and similarly @xmath217 with @xmath218 for any @xmath69 .",
    "the claim of the lemma follows from the following relation : @xmath219 this relation is nothing else but a plcker relation in a ring @xmath220 where we include all vectors @xmath221 , @xmath222 and @xmath223 , @xmath222 , ordered so that all the @xmath157-s precede all the @xmath187-s . in other words , this is just a relation in a large enough grassmannian , which one can identify with the universal cover of the original annulus .",
    "note also that because of the ordering on @xmath157-s and @xmath187-s , the signs in the relation are exactly as they are shown .    [",

    "@xmath228 , @xmath229 .",
    "proof is by induction on @xmath55 , the base case @xmath230 holding by definition .",
    "applying @xmath41 to @xmath225 means mutating at all variables @xmath231 , resulting in a seed associated with triangulation created by the diagonals @xmath227 and @xmath232 .",
    "next , applying @xmath42 means mutating at all variables @xmath233 , resulting in a seed associated with triangulation created by the diagonals @xmath234 and @xmath232 , i.e. exactly in @xmath235 .",
    "figure  [ fig : zint11 ] shows how a single application of @xmath74 looks locally .",
    "the red dot represents the variable @xmath236 , which mutates into @xmath237 .",

    "the latter can be done similarly to how it was done in @xcite .",
    "we omit the technical details .",
    "now , we can see a conceptual explanation of zamolodchikov integrability .",
    "the key is the following easy corollary of lemma [ lem : locmut ] and corollary [ cor : evol ] .",
    "we have @xmath238    this means that the tensor diagram representing @xmath239 is the tensor diagram representing @xmath240 to which one twice applied a dehn twist .",

    "indeed , any collection of @xmath244 algebraically independent variables may be taken to be mutable variables of a seed @xmath199 , while setting the coefficient variables of this seed to be @xmath49 .",

    "observe that dehn twists @xmath247 insert into tensor diagram representing @xmath245 a factor @xmath248 , @xmath86 factors total . here",
    "since @xmath250 satisfies its own characteristic polynomial of degree @xmath159 , we know that the vector space of all matrices @xmath251 is spanned by the subset of generators given by @xmath252 . since the number of such tensor monomials is finite , we conclude that for large enough @xmath253 the monomials @xmath248 , @xmath254 are linearly dependent .",

    "overall , we see that the dimension of the space is then at most @xmath260 , and thus if we take @xmath261 of the powers @xmath262 , they must be linearly dependent .    the order of linearizability that follows from this proof is too large however , i.e. the sequences in question are linearizable with a smaller order than that .",

    "the number of such monomials is @xmath265 .",
    "since it takes @xmath177 applications of @xmath44 to get to each next winding of the original tensor , we get order of the linear dependence to be @xmath266 , as desired .",

    "nevertheless , we can still define @xmath268 , in fact we can do it in two equivalent ways :    * as a result of substitution of the variables of the seed @xmath269 ( obtained from @xmath199 by a single step of time evolution @xmath74 ) into the formula expressing @xmath1 in terms of the seed @xmath199 ; * as a result of @xmath270 , where @xmath271 denotes applying the sequence of mutations @xmath267 in reverse order .",
    "[ thm : off ] the transformation @xmath74 is linearizable at @xmath1 for any cluster variable @xmath1 of the cluster algebra with the initial seed @xmath199 .",
    "[ lem : lin ] term - wise sum and term - wise product of two linearizable sequences are also linearizable .    to any linear recurrence @xmath272",
    "one can associate polynomial @xmath273 .",
    "if we have two sequences with polynomials @xmath274 and @xmath275 , their sum is easily seen to satisfy recurrence corresponding to the product @xmath276 .",

    "one can express the coefficients of @xmath279 directly through the coefficients of @xmath274 and @xmath275 using the cauchy identity @xmath282 it is easy to see that the product of two linearizable sequences with polynomials @xmath274 and @xmath275 is a linearizable sequence with polynomial @xmath279 .",
    "now we are ready to prove theorem [ thm : off ]    what made the proof of zamolodchikov periodicity in the previous section work is the following fact . each of the variables @xmath245 can be written as a concatenation of three tensor diagrams : the @xmath157-part , the connector consisting of @xmath86 kronecker tensors , and the @xmath187-part , see figure  [ fig : zint13 ] .",
    "then , each application of the square of dehn twist could be viewed as fixing the @xmath157- and @xmath187-parts , and extending the kronecker part in the middle by @xmath283 .",
    "it is clear that the same proof works for _ any _ invariant that can be represented in such a tensor form .",
    "it remains to be noted that according to theorem [ thm : procesi ] all the generators of the ring @xmath209 are representable by tensors .",
    "then so are their products , and applying lemma [ lem : lin ] we conclude that any linear combination of those products is linearizable . by theorem [ thm : ca ]",
    "this means that all cluster variables @xmath1 are linearizable .",
    "note that although linearizability is preserved by addition and multiplication , it is not preserved in general by division .",
    "for example , the sequence @xmath284 is linearizable , while @xmath285 is not .",
    "since every variable in the cluster algebra is a _ rational _ expression in the variables of seed @xmath199 , there is no a priori reason why they should exhibit zamolodchikov integrability .",
    "this suggests the following conjecture .",
    "assume a recurrent quiver exhibits zamolodchikov integrability .",
    "then so does every element of the associated upper cluster algebra .",
    "one can also treat the order of linearizability of a specific variable as a measure of complexity of this variable .",
    "we can state the following conjecture , analogous to ( * ? ? ?",
    "* conjecture 9.1 ) and ( * ? ? ?",
    "* conjecture 21 ) .",
    "if it is true , then the order of linearizability of a cluster variable should be determined by the minimal number of strands possible in the kronecker part of the associated tensor diagram .",
    "all cluster variables @xmath1 in the cluster algebra with the initial seed @xmath199 can be written as ( evaluations of ) single tensor diagrams .",
    "in this section we prove theorem [ thm : aind ] .",
    "let @xmath286 be the ring of invariants of @xmath287 vectors : vectors @xmath135 , @xmath288 ,",
    "vectors @xmath141 , @xmath288 and vectors @xmath289 , @xmath290 .      starting with a generic collection of vectors @xmath292 one can consider the map in the reverse direction , assigning @xmath293}{[u_{2n } , \\ldots , u_{2n+m}]}^{-1},\\ ] ] where @xmath294 $ ] denotes the matrix with specified columns .",
    "there is only one relation one needs to impose to get a generic set of vectors @xmath295 and a generic element @xmath182 : @xmath296 since @xmath297 is the standard plcker algebra , its dimension is well - known to be @xmath298 since we impose one algebraic relation , the dimension of @xmath286 is one smaller than that of @xmath297 , as desired .",
    "now , in order to show that the @xmath291 variables in the seed @xmath199 are algebraically independent , it suffices to prove that all generators of @xmath286 ( given by theorem [ thm : procesi ] ) can be expressed as rational functions in elements of @xmath199 .",
    "all of those generators are essentially determinants and can be presented by tensor diagrams in an annulus , as described in section [ sec : ann ] .",
    "therefore , the claim follows from the following stronger statement .",
    "any tensor diagram @xmath99 on an annulus with @xmath101 marked black vertices as above lies in the upper cluster algebra associated with @xmath199 . in particular , it can be expressed as a laurent polynomial in elements of @xmath199 .",
    "the proof is essentially verbatim to that of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 16 ) .",
    "it suffices to argue laurentness for a seed and a collection of adjacent seeds .",
    "we shall argue it for the initial seed @xmath199 , the argument for the adjacent seeds is similar .",
    "we need to show that by repeatedly multiplying @xmath152 $ ] with elements of @xmath199 we can get a linear combination of monomials in elements of @xmath199 .",
    "let @xmath189 be a diagonal connecting two marked points .",
    "the idea is to multiply @xmath152 $ ] by a sufficiently large monomial in @xmath240-s . like in the proof of (",
    "* theorem 16 ) , we need to exhibit a local relation that allows one to get rid of crossings of @xmath99 with @xmath189 one by one .",
    "once this is done , all the resulting tensor diagrams are going to be contained within individual triangles of @xmath299 .",
    "this can be shown to imply that they factor into variables of @xmath199 sitting on the sides of the individual triangles .",

    "create a quiver on the created vertices as shown in figure  [ fig : zint14 ] .",
    "we claim that the sequence @xmath320 of @xmath167 mutations at variables on the diagonal @xmath318 in the order from @xmath314 to @xmath309 changes one thus created seed into the other .",
    "this is easily verified using the skein relation for tensor diagrams . for example , the last mutation in the sequence @xmath320 has form @xmath321,u^*,[w_j , w_{j+1 } ] ] \\ ; \\langle v_i , \\ldots , v_{i+m-1 } , w_j \\rangle = \\ ] ] @xmath322 @xmath323,u^*,[w_j , w_{j+1 } ] ]   \\ ; \\langle u , v_i , \\ldots , v_{i+m-2 } , w_j \\rangle\\ ] ] and is shown in figure  [ fig : zint15 ] . here",
    "each tensor diagram @xmath99 denotes the associated normalized invariant @xmath175 $ ] .",
    "note that for odd @xmath167 the formulas hold only with the correct choice of sign for each tensor diagram .",
    "however , since the goal of the argument is to show that there exists a laurent expression for the variable @xmath324 in terms of the variables of the other seed , the exact signs do not matter .",
    "this goal is achieved , as we can reverse @xmath320 and thus obtain the needed laurent expression for @xmath324 .",
    "this completes the argument , as all the variables in the second triangulation represent tensor diagrams that do not cross @xmath189 ."
