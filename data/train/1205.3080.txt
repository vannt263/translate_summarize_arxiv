    "the ising model in @xmath0 dimensions is perhaps the most studied statistical mechanical model and has a special place in the theory of critical phenomena since the groundbreaking work of onsager  @xcite .",
    "its scaling limit at or near the critical point is recognized to give rise to euclidean ( quantum ) field theories . in particular , at the critical point , the lattice magnetization field should converge , in the scaling limit , to a euclidean random field @xmath1 corresponding to the simplest reflection - positive conformal field theory  @xcite . as such , there have been a variety of representations in terms of free fermion fields  @xcite and explicit formulas for correlation functions ( see , e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) .    in  @xcite , c.m .",

    "the purpose of the present paper is twofold , as we now explain .",
    "first of all , we provide a detailed proof of the existence of subsequential limits of the lattice magnetization field as a square integrable random variable and a random generalized function ( theorem  [ thm : subseqential - limits ] ) following the ideas presented in  @xcite .",
    "we also introduce a cutoff field whose scaling limit admits a geometric representation in terms of rescaled counting measures associated to critical fk clusters , and show that it converges to the magnetization field as the cutoff is sent to zero ( theorem  [ thm : cutoff - removal ] ) .",
    "secondly , we describe work in progress  @xcite of the author with c. garban and c.m .",
    "newman aimed at establishing uniqueness of the scaling limit of the lattice magnetization and conformal covariance properties for the limiting magnetization field .",
    "we also explain how the existence and conformal covariance properties of the magnetization field should imply the convergence , in the scaling limit , of a version of the model with a vanishing ( in the limit ) external magnetic field to a field theory with exponential decay of correlations , and how they can be used to determine the free energy density of the model up to a constant ( equation  ( [ eq : free - energy ] ) ) .",
    "we consider the standard ising model on the square lattice @xmath2 with ( formal ) _ hamiltonian _ @xmath3 where the first sum is over nearest - neighbor pairs in @xmath2 , the spin variables @xmath4 are @xmath5-valued and the external field @xmath6 is in @xmath7 . for a bounded @xmath8 , the _ gibbs distribution _ is given by @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the hamiltonian  ( [ eq : hamiltonian ] ) with sums restricted to sites in @xmath11 , @xmath12 is the _ inverse temperature _ , and the _ partition function _",
    "@xmath13 is the appropriate normalization needed to obtain a probability distribution .",
    "we are mostly interested in the model with zero ( or vanishing ) external field , and at the critical inverse temperature , @xmath14 . for all @xmath15 ,",
    "the model has a unique _ infinite - volume gibbs distribution _ for any value of the external field @xmath6 , obtained as a weak limit of the gibbs distribution for bounded @xmath11 by letting @xmath16 . for any value of @xmath15 and of @xmath6 , expectation with respect to the unique infinite - volume gibbs distribution",

    "the _ two - point correlation _ @xmath21 is a function only of @xmath22 , which at the critical point we denote by @xmath23 .",
    "we want to study the random field associated with the spins on the rescaled lattice @xmath24 in the scaling limit @xmath25 .",
    "more precisely , for functions @xmath26 of bounded support on @xmath27 , we define for the critical model @xmath28 dz = \\theta_a \\sum_{z \\in a \\ , { \\mathbb z}^2 } f(z ) s_{z / a } \\ , , \\ ] ] with scale factor @xmath29 where @xmath30 ^ 2 \\cap a \\ , { \\mathbb z}^2 $ ] and @xmath31 ^ 2 \\cap { \\mathbb z}^2 $ ] .",

    "@xmath19 , the dependence is sufficiently weak for the block magnetization to converge , as @xmath35 , to a mean - zero , gaussian random variable ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite and references therein ) . in that case , the appropriate scaling factor @xmath36 is of order @xmath37 , and the field converges to gaussian white noise as @xmath35 ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) . in the critical case ,",
    "however , correlations are much stronger and extend to all length scales , so that one does not expect a gaussian limit .",
    "a proof of this will be presented elsewhere @xcite ; in this paper we are concerned with the existence of subsequential limits for the lattice magnetization field , and their geometric representation in terms of area measures of critical fk clusters .",
    "the fk representation of the ising model with zero external field , @xmath19 , is based on the @xmath38 random - cluster measure @xmath39 ( see  @xcite for more on the random - cluster model and its connection to the ising model ) .",
    "a spin configuration distributed according to the unique infinite - volume gibbs distribution with @xmath19 and inverse temperature @xmath15 can be obtained in the following way .",

    "one may regard the index @xmath42 as taking values in the natural numbers , but it s better to think of it as a dummy countable index without any prescribed ordering , like one has for a poisson point process .",

    "since all fk clusters are almost surely finite at the critical point ( @xmath67 ) , such interfaces form closed curves , or loops , which separate the corresponding clusters @xmath66 from infinity ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : loops ] ) .",
    "there are two types of loops : ( 1 ) those with sites of @xmath57 immediately on their inside and ( 2 ) those with sites of @xmath68 immediately on their outside .",
    "we denote by @xmath69 the ( random ) collection of all loops of the first type associated with the fk clusters @xmath70 .",

    "it follows from  @xcite and the rsw - type bounds of  @xcite ( see section  5.3 there ) that , as @xmath35 , @xmath69 has subsequential limits in distribution to random collections of loops in the aizenman - burchard metric . in the scaling limit",

    "convergence in the wasserstein metric @xmath81 is equivalent to convergence in distribution plus convergence of the second moment . for brevity , we will write @xmath82 and @xmath83 , instead of @xmath71 and @xmath72 , unless we wish to emphasize the role of the metrics .",
    "we further denote by @xmath84 the space of infinitely differentiable functions on @xmath27 with compact support , equipped with the topology of uniform convergence of all derivatives , and by @xmath85 its topological dual , i.e. , the space of all generalized functions .",
    "the next theorem shows that the lattice magnetization field has subsequential scaling limits in terms of continuous functionals , in a distributional sense using the wasserstein metric @xmath81 , and in the sense of generalized functions by an application of the bochner - minlos theorem .",

    "a key step in the implementation of this idea is the construction of the intensity measure of the poisson process of marks .",

    "fk percolation is more difficult to analyze than bernoulli percolation , due to the dependencies in the distribution of fk configurations ( as opposed to the product measure corresponding to bernoulli percolation ) .",

    "the idea behind a proof of this makes use of the well - known `` ghost spin '' representation of the ising model with an external field , in which an additional site with spin that agrees with the external field is added and connected to all the sites of the square lattice .",

    "the following key observation is an easy consequence of standard properties of fk percolation . if a subset @xmath11 of the square lattice is surrounded by a circuit @xmath177 of fk bonds that belong to a cluster which also contains the site carrying the ghost spin , the fk and spin configurations in @xmath11 are independent of the fk and spin configurations outside the circuit @xmath177 .",
    "the rsw - type bounds proved in  @xcite , together with the fkg inequality  @xcite and scaling properties of the fk clusters and their area measures , imply that the probability to find such a circuit @xmath177 surrounding any bounded subset @xmath11 is one .",
    "this shows that the @xmath152-probability of any event that depends only on the restriction of the spin configuration to a finite subset @xmath11 of the square lattice has a limit as @xmath172 .",

    "it is interesting to note that the argument alluded to above also shows that @xmath156 is locally absolutely continuous with respect to the zero - field measure @xmath155 .",
    "this is in contrast to the situation in two - dimensional percolation , where the critical and near - critical measures are mutually singular  @xcite .",
    "it should be noted , however , that the ising analogue of that type of percolation near - critical scaling limit is to set @xmath19 and let @xmath178 , rather than set @xmath179 and let @xmath180 .",
    "one expects the near / off - critical field to be `` massive '' in the sense that correlations under @xmath156 should decay exponentially at large distances . to understand why this should be the case ,",
    "it is again useful to resort to the ghost spin representation discussed earlier .",
    "remember that the ising two - point function can be expressed in terms of connectivity properties of the fk clusters ( see the discussion about the fk representation preceding equation  ( [ eq : theta ] ) ) . because of that , exponential decay of correlations is equivalent to the statement that , if two sites of the square lattice , @xmath132 and @xmath181 , belong to the same fk cluster @xmath182 , the probability that @xmath182 does not contain the site carrying the ghost spin decays exponentially in the distance between @xmath132 and @xmath181 .",
    "but the scaling law for the area measures , @xmath183 for all @xmath184 , suggests that a macroscopic fk cluster of diameter at least @xmath185 ( that is , of order @xmath186 in units of the lattice spacing @xmath37 ) should contain at least @xmath187 sites , precisely enough to compensate for the small intensity of the external field @xmath160 , which determines the probability of a cluster to contain the site carrying the ghost spin via the density , @xmath176 , of fk bonds connected to that site .",
