    "type ia supernovae ( sne  ia ) are extremely important in astronomy because of their use in measuring cosmological distances and the opportunities they provide to study the physics of flames , instabilities , radiation transport , non - equilibrium systems , and nuclear and high energy physics .",
    "sne  ia are bright time - dependent events which have been seen out to redshifts of @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "although there is some variety in the absolute luminosity of these events , they have been shown to be standardizable by using characteristics of their light curves @xcite . with increasing numbers of sne  ia being discovered ,",
    "differences in spectra can be examined in order to create additional corrections to the standardization of these objects and to further hone our understanding of the progenitor systems , the cause of the explosion , and the propagation of material and energy due to the explosion .",
    "for overviews see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "the consensus is that sne  ia come from close binary systems and result from a degenerate carbon / oxygen ( co ) white dwarf ( wd ) undergoing a thermonuclear runaway @xcite .",
    "there are multiple potential progenitor systems in addition to multiple explosion scenarios . in the double degenerate ( dd )",
    "system , the binary system consists of two or more wds . in the single degenerate ( sd )",
    "system , the binary system may consist of a single wd and either a main sequence , helium star , or giant star companion @xcite . whether sne  ia occur from one or likely both of the proposed progenitor systems , the rate of sne  ia from each channel and observations of either the progenitor system or the post - explosion companion in supernova remnants ( snr ) will help solidify the overall picture of sne  ia .",
    "observations of both sd and dd candidate systems can be found in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite , and , in particular , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "aside from the makeup of the progenitor system , the explosion mechanism is also a topic of debate . in the case of two wds merging on a dynamical time - scale ,",
    "the explosion is triggered by heat release during the merging process @xcite ( only possible in a dd system ) .",
    "alternatively , the explosion can be triggered by compressional heat in an accreting wd when it approaches the chandrasekhar mass limit ( @xmath7 ) .",
    "the donor star can be a non - degenerate star or a tidally disrupted wd @xcite .",
    "scenarios with @xmath7 explosions , whether originating from sd or dd progenitor systems , seem to be favored by observations of light curves and spectra , with some additional contribution from dynamical mergers @xcite .",
    "uncertainty about the progenitor system and explosion mechanism results in questions about the wd central density , total mass attained by the wd prior to the explosion , and the density profile of the wd just prior to the explosion .",
    "the telltale indicator between the explosion scenarios is the central density of the wd at the time of the explosion . within @xmath7 models ,",
    "the central density is an additional free parameter which depends mostly on the accretion rate and history @xcite .",
    "slower accretion rates will lead to higher @xmath3 because electron conduction is able to remove heat from the wd core and delay ignition of in the core . in dynamical or violent mergers ,",
    "the time scale for merging does not allow for cooling and ignition can be triggered at a much lower @xmath3 .",
    "nuclear burning of a co wd provides the energy to overcome the binding energy and provides the kinetic energy of the explosion .",
    "the time scales and the burning products depend mostly on the local density at the time of burning .",
    "hydrodynamical instabilities may cause a redistribution of the burning products . within the @xmath7 channel ,",
    "the most likely scenario involves delayed - detonation models @xcite , i.e. , models with a transition from a deflagration front to a detonation front ( delayed - detonation transition ; ddt ) .",
    "independent of the explosion model , burning of a / mixture will produce regions of : iron group elements when burning reaches nuclear statistical equilibrium ( nse ) ; layers of /// by incomplete burning ; // as a product of explosive carbon burning ; and some unburned outer layers . in the inner layers ,",
    "nse is achieved in all current explosion scenarios .",
    "however , only in @xmath7 does burning occur under sufficiently high densities that electron capture can take place on hydrodynamical time scales which , in turn , shifts the peak of nse from to stable isotopes of the iron group .",
    "observations during the photospheric phase allow investigation of the layers of incomplete burning and the region , which determine the peak brightness and @xmath13 .",
    "however , observations of these regions provide hardly any information on the central region .",
    "the isotropic structure of the central region can be probed during the nebular phase by line profiles . to use line profiles we need an emission feature of iron that is unblended .",
    "optical and most near - infrared ( nir ) features are dominated by blends of multiple bound - bound transitions of various elements .",
    "however , the @xmath2 feature of [ ] is a sensitive tool to separate stable and radioactive isotopes @xcite . to produce an emission line , we need both the element and energy input by radioactive decay . after @xmath14 , the energy deposition is dominated by positrons , which can not excite the central low - velocity non - radioactive regions .",
    "the low - velocity emissivity produces `` flat - topped '' or `` stubby '' profiles which are a signature of @xmath7 explosions without mixing .",
    "up to about @xmath15 , the line profiles are peaked because gamma - rays contribute significantly to the energy input and excite the central , non - radioactive iron .",
    "time evolution of the line profiles after @xmath16 is sensitive to positron transport effects and , therefore , magnetic fields .",
    "time evolution of the spectrum is needed in order to separate density , asymmetry in chemistry , and magnetic fields effects on the line profiles .",
    "for the first time , a late - time evolutionary sequence of a sne  ia is presented in the nir that includes the @xmath2 line of [ ] .",
    "details of sn  2005df are presented in sections  [ sec : obs - red ] and [ sec : pre - analysis ] .",
    "reference models and rationale are outlined in section  [ sec : models ] .",
    "we develop general methods for comparing sne  ia with the reference models as well as discuss the interpretation of the sn  2005df data in terms of our reference models and the implications of the analysis in section  [ sec : results ] .",
    "we compare the entire spectra between @xmath17 to show the viability and uniqueness of the @xmath2 [ ] feature .",
    "finally , we discuss the implications of our results in section  [ sec : conclusions ] .",

    "mid - infrared ( mir ) observations of this sn ia were previously analyzed by @xcite , focusing on the [ ] emission line at @xmath18 and the [ ] and [ ] emission lines at @xmath19 and @xmath20 , respectively . reviewing the initial published photometry and spectroscopy of sn  2005df , in addition to the range of distance estimates to the host galaxy ngc  1559 , that analysis seemed consistent with a somewhat sub - luminous sn  ia @xcite .",
    "light curve data for sn  2005df in the uv were analyzed by @xcite and @xcite .",

    "@xcite found that the light curve and @xmath13 value of sn  2005df were consistent with a normal bright sn  ia , with a distance to the host galaxy larger than that used in the @xcite analysis .    for our analysis ,",
    "observational epochs are given in relation to the estimated explosion date of august 2 , 2005 , to maintain consistency with @xcite .",
    "four epochs of late - time near - ir spectroscopy , ranging from @xmath21 to @xmath22 after explosion , were observed using the gemini near infrared spectrograph ( gnirs ) at the gemini south observatory .",
    "all spectra were taken in cross - dispersed ( xd ) mode , with the last observation also including spectra taken in long - slit ( ls ) mode .",
    "the spectra taken in the xd mode are spread out into different spectral orders ; however , only orders @xmath23 have significant signal and are used in this analysis .",
    "the data from the @xmath24 observation were combined with the @xmath25 observation , because they lack accompanying standard star calibration images .",
    "the data were reduced following the standard procedure outlined in the gemini iraf package , with an exception for variance handling . because of the low signal - to - noise ratio of these data , the variance was propagated for each step in the reduction using a custom script , assuming the original variance determined by the gemini iraf package and poisson distribution of noise .",
    "this variance propagation deviates from the standard procedure during the nscombine and nsextract steps in the reduction .",
    "the telluric standard stars we use for calibration purposes are sao 248743 , used with the @xmath24 and @xmath25 observations , and sao 249308 , used with the @xmath26 and @xmath27 observations . both of these stars have a spectral type of a0 , with visual magnitudes of @xmath28 and @xmath29 , respectively @xcite .",

    "lines in the spectra are identified based on the models described in section  [ sec : models ] .",

    "<S> we present late - time ( @xmath0 ) near - infrared spectral evolution for the type ia supernova sn  2005df . </S>",
    "<S> the spectra show numerous strong emission features of [ ] , [ ] and [ ] throughout the @xmath1 region . as the spectrum ages , the cobalt features fade as would be expected from the decay of to . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the strong and isolated [ ] emission line at @xmath2 provides a unique tool to analyze near - infrared spectra of type ia supernovae . </S>",
    "<S> normalization of spectra to this line allows separation of features produced by stable versus unstable isotopes of iron group elements . </S>",
    "<S> we develop a new method of determining the initial central density , @xmath3 , and the magnetic field , @xmath4 , of the white dwarf using the width of the @xmath2 line . </S>",
    "<S> the line width is sensitive because of electron capture in the early stages of burning , which increases as a function of density . </S>",
    "<S> the sensitivity of the line width to @xmath4 increase with time and the effects of the magnetic field shift towards later times with decreasing @xmath3 . the initial central density for sn  2005df is measured as @xmath5 ( in @xmath6 ) , which corresponds to a white dwarf close to the chandrasekhar mass ( @xmath7 ) with @xmath8 and systematic error less than @xmath9 . within @xmath7 explosions , however , the central density found for sn  2005df is very low for a -accretor , possibly suggesting a helium star companion or a tidally - disrupted white dwarf companion . </S>",
    "<S> as an alternative , we suggest mixing of the central region . </S>",
    "<S> we find some support for high initial magnetic fields of strength @xmath10 for sn  2005df , however , @xmath11 can not be ruled out because of noise in the spectra combined with low @xmath3 . </S>"
