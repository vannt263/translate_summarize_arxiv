    "interactions in few - body systems consisting of more than two @xmath4h and @xmath5he nuclei can contribute to a nucleosynthesis pattern .",
    "a macroscopic medium composed of the lightest nuclei having energy of a nucleosynthesis scale can possess the properties analogous to those of dilute quantum gases of atomic physics . in this sense , few - body fusions imply a phase transition to dropsof a quantum liquid , that is , to heavier nuclei .",
    "fusions can proceed via the states corresponding to low - lying cluster excitations in forming nuclei .    on a microscopic level",
    "the phase transition can proceed through the production of quasi - stable and loosely bound quantum states . among candidates for such states",
    "one can consider the dilute @xmath6 particle bose condensate @xcite as well as radioactive and unbound nuclei along a proton drip line . at first glance",
    ", exploration of few - body transitions in the laboratory conditions seems to be impossible .",
    "nevertheless , such processes can indirectly be explored in the inverse processes of relativistic nucleus breakups in a nuclear track emulsion by selecting the excitations close to the few - body decay threshold .",
    "experimental data on charged topology for the final states of a number of light nuclei have been described in @xcite .",
    "more specific studies were performed for the leading channels like @xmath7c@xmath83@xmath6 @xcite , @xmath9o@xmath84@xmath6 @xcite , @xmath10li@xmath8d@xmath6 @xcite , @xmath11li@xmath8t@xmath6 @xcite , @xmath12b@xmath8d@xmath13 @xcite , and @xmath11be@xmath14he@xmath6 @xcite . a collection of appropriate reaction images can be found in @xcite .        in the present paper the behaviour of relativistic systems consisting of several h and he nuclei will be described in terms of invariant variables of a 4-velocity space as suggested in @xcite .",
    "the invariant presentation makes it possible to extract qualitatively new information about few - cluster systems from fragmentation of relativistic nuclei in peripheral interactions .",
    "the invariant approach is applied to the existing data on 3.3  a  gev @xmath0ne interactions in a nuclear track emulsion , as well as to new data for 2.1  a  gev @xmath1n and 1.2  a  gev @xmath15be nuclei extracted from a portion of recently exposured emulsion .",
    "the first observations of the fragment topology for neutron - deficient @xmath16b and @xmath15c nuclei in emulsion are described in this report .",
    "last emulsion exposures were performed at the jinr nuclotron in the years 2002 - 4 @xcite .",
    "the relativistic projectile fragmentation results in the production of a fragment jet which can be defined by invariant variables characterizing relative motion    @xmath17    with @xmath18 and @xmath19 being the 4-momenta and the masses of the @xmath20 or @xmath21 fragments . following @xcite",
    ", one can suggest that a jet is composed of the nuclear fragments having relative motion within the non - relativistic range 10@xmath22  @xmath23b@xmath24  10@xmath25 .",
    "the lower limit corresponds to the ground state decay @xmath16be@xmath82@xmath6 , while the upper one - to the boundary of low - energy nuclear interactions .",
    "the expression of the data via the relativistic invariant variable b@xmath26 makes it possible to compare the target and projectile fragmentation in a common form .",
    "[ fig:1 ] shows the microphotograph of a special example of a projectile fragment jet - the whitestar as introduced in @xcite .",
    "it corresponds to the case of a relativistic nucleus dissociation accompanied by neither a target fragment nor meson production .",
    "the variable characterizing the excitation of a fragment jet as a whole is an invariant mass @xmath27 defined as @xmath28 the system excitation can be characterized also by @xmath29 with @xmath30 being the mass of the ground state of the nucleus corresponding to the charge and weight of the fragment system .",
    "the variable @xmath31 corresponds to the excitation energy of the system of fragments in their c. m. s. a useful option is @xmath32 with @xmath33 being the sum of fragment masses and @xmath34 the total atomic weight .",
    "the normalized variable @xmath35 characterizes a mean kinetic energy of fragments per nucleon in their c. m. s. precision of the experimental @xmath36 and @xmath31 values is driven to a decisive degree by the angular resolution in the determination of unit vectors defining the direction of the fragment emission .",
    "due to excellent spatial resolution ( about 0.5 @xmath37 m ) the emulsion technique is known to be most adequate for the observation and angular measurements of projectile fragments down to a total breakup of relativistic nuclei . nevertheless , it has restrictions on the determination of the 4-momentum components of fragments .",
    "firstly , the fragment spatial momentum in the projectile fragmentation cone is suggested to be equal within a few percent error to the primary nucleus value when normalized to the nucleon numbers .",
    "secondly , by multiple scattering measurements it is possible to identify the mass only for relativistic h isotopes and much harder for he ones . normally , the @xmath6 particle mass is taken for the mass of doubly charged fragments in a narrow fragmentation cone .",
    "both assumptions are proven to be reasonable for light stable nuclei .",
    "a nuclear state analogous to the dilute bose gas can be revealed in the formation of @xmath39 particle ensembles possessing quantum coherence near the production threshold .",
    "the predicted property of these systems is a narrow velocity distribution in the c. m. s. @xcite . originating from relativistic nuclei",
    ", they can appear as narrow @xmath39 jets in the forward cone defined by the nucleonic fermi motion .",
    "the determination of the c. m. s. for each event is rather ambiguous while analysis of jets in the b@xmath26 space enables one to explore @xmath39 particle systems in a universal way .",
    "at our disposal there are data on 4100 events from 3.3  a  gev @xmath0ne nucleus interactions with emulsion nuclei ( presented in @xcite ) which contain the classification of secondary tracks by ionization and angles .",
    "the key feature for the @xmath0ne fragmentation consists in a suppression of binary splittings into medium charge fragments with respect to he and h cluster formation .",
    "the increase of a fragmentation degree is revealed in a growth of the @xmath6 particle multiplicity .",
    "thus , transition to the @xmath39 particle states having a high level density predominate over the binary splittings occuring at lower energy thresholds .    in the present analysis",
    ", the doubly charged particles found in a forward 6@xmath40 cone were classified as relativistic @xmath6 particles .",
    "[ fig:2 ] shows the @xmath36 distribution ( 1 ) for the fragmentation channel @xmath0ne@xmath8 @xmath39 for n equal to 3 ( 240 events ) , 4 ( 79 events ) , and 5 ( 10 events ) which is rather narrow .",
    "the distribution tailsappear to be due to the @xmath41he diffractive scattering or @xmath42he formation proceeding at higher momentum transfers .",
    "the events , satisfying the non - relativistic criterion @xmath4310@xmath25 for each @xmath6 particle pair were selected for @xmath44 equal to 3 ( 141 events ) , 4 ( 47 events ) , and 5 ( 6 events ) .",
    "[ fig:3 ] presents the normalized @xmath35 distribution ( 4 ) for them .",
    "being considered as estimates of the mean kinetic energy per nucleon in the center - of - mass of n@xmath6 system , the @xmath31 values does not exceed the coulomb barrier values .",
    "thus , in spite of the high @xmath39 multiplicity , the @xmath39 jets are seen to remain rather coldand consimilar . among 10 @xmath0ne@xmath85@xmath6 events",
    "there were found 3 white  stars .",
    "of these , in 2 goldenevents @xmath6 particle tracks are contained even within a 1@xmath40 cone .",
    "for these two events the value of @xmath35 is estimated to be as low as 400 and 600  kev per nucleon .",
    "the detection of such ultracold  5@xmath6 states is a serious argument in favor of the reality of the phase transition of @xmath6 clusterized nuclei to the dilute bose gas of @xmath6 particles .",
    "it gives a special motivation to explore lighter n@xmath6 systems produced as potential building blocksof the dilute @xmath6 particle bose gas .",
    "we are presently engaged in accumulating statistics on the interactions of 2.1  a  gev @xmath1n nuclei in emulsion impacted on white  star searches .",
    "25 white  stars have already been found among 540 inelastic events by scanning over primary tracks .",
    "such a systematic scanning allows one to estimate relative probabilities of various fragmentation modes .",
    "the secondary tracks of whitestars were selected to be concentrated in a forward 8@xmath46 cone .",

    "the predominant role of the 4-prong mode 3he+h among the white  stars is clearly seen .",
    "it implies that the exploration of the 3@xmath6 systems originated in @xmath1n fragmentation is rather promising .",
    "[ fig:4 ] allows one to compare the @xmath36 distribution for the `` white '' 3@xmath6 stars to the case of 3he+h events where a prohibition on a target fragmentation is lifted of . in both cases ,",
    "the criterion of a non - relativistic character of fragment interactions is satisfied .",
    "[ fig:5 ] shows the @xmath51 distribution in which the excitation energy is counted out from the @xmath7c nucleus mass .",
    "it can be concluded that the major fraction of entries is concentrated within a range of 10 to 14  mev covering the known @xmath7c nucleus levels .",
    "softening of the selection conditions for 3he+h events , under which the target fragment formation is allowable , does not result in a shift of the position of the 3@xmath6 excitation peak .",
    "this circumstance points out the universality of the mechanism of population of 3@xmath6 particle states . besides",
    ", one can readily estimate that the normalized values @xmath52 are of the same magnitude as in fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] .",
    "another conclusion is that the contribution of the @xmath6-@xmath3be state in the 3@xmath6 configuration does not exceed a 10% -level .",
    "this topic awaits for higher statistics allowing a reliable @xmath3be identification .",
    "the relativistic @xmath2be nucleus fragmentation is an attractive source for @xmath3be generation due to the absence of a combinatorial background .",
    "the @xmath3be nucleus reveals itself in the formation of @xmath6 particle pairs having an extremely small opening angle of the order of a few 10@xmath54 rad in the range of a few gev .",
    "the estimation of the @xmath3be production probability will make it possible to clear up the interrelation between n-@xmath3be and @xmath6-n-@xmath6 excitation modes which are important in understanding the @xmath2be structure and fragmentation of heavier nuclei .",
    "a secondary @xmath2be beam was produced through fragmentation of the primary 1.2  a  gev @xmath12b beam . in scanning emulsion layers exposed to @xmath2be nuclei ,",
    "about 200 interactions are detected with he pair produced in a forward 8@xmath40 cone .",
    "as in the previously considered cases , the @xmath36 distribution for 50 measured events , which is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:6 ] , confirms the non - relativistic behavior of the relative motion of the produced @xmath6 particles . in just the same way as in the case of the @xmath1n nuclei , softening of the criterion of selection of the 2he pairs less rigid does not lead to changes of the distribution shape .",
    "[ fig:7 ] shows the @xmath55 distribution ( 3 ) allowing one to estimate the excitation scale .",
    "there is an event concentration below 1  mev which is relevant for the @xmath3be ground state decay . besides",
    ", one can resolve a bump at around 3  mev corresponding to the @xmath3be decay from the first excited state 2@xmath56 .",
    "a zoomed part of this distribution near zero is presented in fig .",
    "[ fig:8 ] . a clear peak is seen as a concentration of 14 events around the mean value @xmath55 equal to 88 kev which is close to the decay energy of the @xmath3be ground state .",
    "thus , the achieved identification of @xmath3be production allows one to justify the spectroscopy of @xmath39 decays from the lowest decay energy .",
    "in order to expose an emulsion to @xmath3b nuclei , the use was made of fragmentation of 1.2  a  gev @xmath12b nuclei . in this case ,",
    "absence of @xmath2b nuclei among secondary fragments turned out to be good luck , resulting in a clear separation of the primary and secondary beams by their magnetic rigidity .",
    "when scanning emulsions , this fact was indirecly confirmed by the absence of white  stars with a charge topology he+h .",
    "they could be produced by background @xmath58li having the same magnetic rigidity as @xmath12b nuclei .",
    "a 15% -admixture of @xmath59be nuclei was eliminated according to the charge topology of the found white  stars .",
    "the most intensive background presented by @xmath42he nuclei was visually separated .",
    "l|c|c|c|c|c @xmath47 & 4 & 3 &  &  &  + @xmath49 &  &  & 2 & 1 &  + @xmath48 & 1 & 2 & 1 & 3 & 5 + @xmath50 & 15 & 1 & 9 & 11 & 3 +    by scanning over the incoming tracks , a total of 39 white  stars , in which the charge in the 15@xmath40-cone is equal to 5 , have been found .",
    "their distribution by the charge modes is shown in table  [ tab:2 ] in the same manner as in table  [ tab:1 ] .",
    "the significance of the @xmath3b modes can be compared with the topology of white  stars produced by the 1  a  gev @xmath12b nuclei @xcite .",
    "the fraction of the 3-prong stars @xmath12b@xmath8 2he+@xmath4h was established to be equal to 80 % with 40% deuteron clustering .",
    "the probability of the 2-prong mode @xmath12b@xmath8 @xmath15be+@xmath60h was found to be equal only to 3% .",
    "such a strong difference can be explained by the lower value of the @xmath61h binding energy .    as is shown in table 2 , an obvious distinction of",
    "the @xmath16b case consists in a high yield of the 2-prong mode @xmath16b@xmath8 @xmath59be+@xmath60h .",
    "this feature is due to the weak @xmath60h binding .",
    "thus , one can conclude that the loosely bound @xmath16b nucleus manifests its structure already in the charge - topology .",
    "further it is planned to increase statistics , identify the h and he isotopes , and reconstruct emission angles .",
    "obtaining @xmath62b beams at the jinr nuclotron makes it possible to form @xmath62c secondary beams by the use of charge - exchange reactions analogous to the @xmath59li@xmath8 @xmath59be process @xcite .",
    "this method is optimal for the emulsion technique where of importance is the simplicity of identification of incoming nuclei rather than their intensity .",
    "the existence and the cross sections of such processes will be established in a separate experiment .",
    "the suggested emulsion exposures will allow one to explore the 3-prong modes @xmath62c@xmath83he analogous to the case @xmath7c@xmath83@xmath6 @xcite .",
    "clustering in @xmath7c@xmath83@xmath6 reflects the ternary @xmath6 process study of the 3he clustering in @xmath62c fragmentation would serve as a basis for studying the possible role of the hefusion process in nucleosynthesis , that is , in media with a mixed composition of he isotopes .",
    "unfortunately , it is impossible to use the approach based on a charge - exchange reaction for the formation of a @xmath2c nucleus beam . an emulsion was exposed to a secondary beam produced in fragmentation of the 2.1  a  gev @xmath7c nuclei and having a @xmath2c magnetic rigidity .",
    "a search was made for the events in which the total charge of tracks in a forward 15@xmath40 cone is equal to 6 .",
    "the presently found 17 events are distributed as shown in table  [ tab:3 ] .",
    "the 3he mode , which dominantes the @xmath7c white  stars , is seen to be suppressed .",
    "besides , there is an indication that multiple dissociation channels predominate over possible candidates to the p+@xmath16b and p+p+@xmath11be modes .",
    "verification of this observation makes a farther increase in statistics to be particularly intriguing .",
    "the cases , which might be interpreted as 3@xmath42he , are of especial importance since they point to highly - lying cluster excitations associated with a strong nucleon rearrangement to produce the 3@xmath42he system . like",
    "the process @xmath7c@xmath83@xmath6 , this dissociation can be considered as a visible reflection of the inverse process of a ternary @xmath50he fusion .",
    "it can provide a significantly higher energy output followed by @xmath41he pair production .",
