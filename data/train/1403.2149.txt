    "longer acenes are found to be less stable and hence there are efforts to derivatize the parent tetracene and pentacene compounds to make them more soluble and stable @xcite .",
    "yutaka et al have synthesized benzopyrazine - fused tetracene compounds and found that these compounds are more photostable and have long wavelength absorption . the major aim is to tune the homo - lumo gap to assist the easy flow of positively charged holes and negatively charged electrons , either for recombination or for charge separation , depending upon the application i.e. leds or photovoltaics .",
    "one way to reduce the homo - lumo gap is to increase the conjugation length of the molecule and another is to substitute the systems with electron withdrawing and donating groups @xcite .",
    "a recent paradigm in the field of organic photovoltaics is the fission of the photoexcited singlet into two triplets @xcite .",
    "these triplets generated by fission can then undergo dissociation to yield twice the number of charge carriers that is produced by singlet dissociation .",
    "there are several conditions under which this can happen with larger probability .",
    "they are ( i ) the energy @xmath3 of the lowest excited singlet state , @xmath1 , is greater than or equal to twice the triplet energy ( @xmath4 , ( ii ) the second triplet state , @xmath5 , is above the singlet excited state , @xmath1 , i.e. ( @xmath6 ) , as this will avoid leaking of the @xmath1 state to @xmath5 via intersystem crossings and ( iii ) @xmath7 should be at least 1 ev as otherwise the operating voltage of the opvc will drop , resulting in lower efficiency .",

    "although the tddft method , in principle , can provide excited state information , it suffers from the severe drawback of lack of reliable functionals .",
    "indeed both these methods are similar in line with the well established hartree - fock ( hf ) and tdhf methods which include mean exchange and correlation potentials .",
    "all the above methods include both coulomb and exchange correlation , but only at the mean - field level . for obtaining electronic excited state properties for conjugated systems , it has been demonstrated that using a model of @xmath10- electrons and treating electron - electron interaction with a very high level theory gives accurate excited states and their properties @xcite . in this spirit , we have employed the pariser - parr - pople ( ppp ) model for describing @xmath10 electrons .",

    "the full configuration space of tetracene spans over 0.9 billion configurations for triplets , without taking into account the three fold spin degeneracy of triplets and extends dvb calculations to nearly a billion valence bond functions .",

    "the only additional term is the site energy term @xmath50 and for substitutions at sites @xmath20 and @xmath44 , the summation can be written explicitly as @xmath51 . since we impose equal donor and acceptor strengths",

    "the @xmath60 transitions are polarized along the short - axis ( y - axis ) of the molecule while the @xmath63 transitions are polarized along the long axis ( x - axis ) of the molecule .",
    "tetracene molecule has @xmath64 symmetry .",
