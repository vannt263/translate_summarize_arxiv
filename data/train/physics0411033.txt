    "<S> this distinction between the light and the emission event that produced it is necessary for the descriptions presented in this letter .    </S>",
    "<S> the coherence length is a relevant attribute of any optical device as it defines the length scales over which mutual interference occurs . </S>",
    "<S> applications such as low coherence interferometry , for non invasive medical imaging @xcite ( also known as optical coherence tomography ) and optical time domain reflectometry ( otdr ) , for ranging measurements in optical components @xcite and surface mapping in integrated circuits @xcite , rely on the coherence of source being both small enough to eliminate coherent reflections from distant objects and large enough to examine detail on the relevant length scale . </S>",
    "<S> the correlations of low coherence sources are also applicable to schemes of all - optical routing.@xcite    the variable coherence properties of rcleds @xcite make them ideal as a light source for applications where a range of length scales need to be analysed where previously , multiple light sources would have been required . </S>",
    "<S> this letter examines the physics of variable emission coherence from planar microcavities and indicates methods by which this aspect of commercial devices such as rcleds could be engineered . </S>",
    "<S> although experimental results of rcleds are used in this paper , the results are applicable to planar microcavities in general .    </S>",
    "<S> the coherence domain picture of microcavity emission requires the definition of the self coherence properties of a light source . </S>",

    "<S> @xcite @xmath6    therefore the coherence function for the microcavity can be written as a convolution expression : @xmath7    @xmath8 is the maximum microcavity enhancement for an emitter tuned to the cavity resonance at an angle @xmath9 , @xmath10    here @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the transmission and reflectivity of the front cavity mirror and @xmath13 is the reflectivity of the back mirror ; all function of @xmath4 , the internal emission angle .    </S>",

    "<S> the transfer function of the cavity , @xmath3 can also be approximated by lorentzians in the immediate vicinity of the cavity modes , @xmath14 as the free spectral range of longitudinal modes in microcavities is usually much greater than the spectral width of the source . </S>",

    "<S> the second limit , @xmath32 , has only recently become applicable in semiconductor devices with the advent of devices that have isolated single quantum dot light sources . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite the spectrally pure emission from single quantum dot sources within a microcavity will have coherence properties that vary weakly with angle since @xmath37 . </S>",
    "<S> the control over emission direction is still available by engineering the cavity s tuning .    for rcleds @xmath38 , however , the difference is not large enough to reduce the dynamics to one of the cases described above by eqns .  </S>",

    "<S> the solid line is a least squares fit of the model and the three unknown model parameters . </S>",
    "<S> the correspondence of experiment and theory is excellent for the lower angles . at large angles </S>",
    "<S> , it should be noted that optical loss from the doped regions of the rcleds may cause the deviation from the theoretical trend . </S>",
    "<S> this is supported by the observation that the deviations occur at the same spectral position , i.e. a relative shift in the deviation s angular position of @xmath48 due to the relative device tunings . </S>",
    "<S> table  [ tab1 ] shows the fitting parameter values for the rcled samples in terms of coherence time ( and spectral wavelength ) . </S>",

    "<S> in addition , the values for the detuning closely match the design values of @xmath49 nm and @xmath50 nm for tuned and detuned devices respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the trend itself is also of significant importance ; clearly interference between the cavity mode and underlying emission only resolves to a peak in coherence at the tuning angle . </S>",
    "<S> this is only visible in the case of the detuned rcled at approximately @xmath51 , corresponding to a detuning of @xmath52 nm .    in the previous study , the density of emission states within the numerical aperture of emission was taken into account . here </S>",
    "<S> , the density of off - axis states increases as @xmath53 . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , the differential change in solid angle with respect to air @xmath54 and the cavity @xmath55 must be taken into account . by integrating eqn .  </S>",

    "<S> shows the variation of coherence length as a function of na for the two rcleds under investigation evaluated using the coherence model with the parameters shown in tab .  </S>",
    "<S> [ tab1 ] . </S>",
    "<S> although experimental results for these trends are not available , they do follow the generic trend observed recently in ref . . </S>",
    "<S> the square markers show the coherence length extrema calculated from measured spectra at normal incidence and @xmath57 in an integrating sphere offering further confirmation of the result .    </S>",
    "<S> the coherence properties of planar microcavities are modelled well by the coherence formula of eqn .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eqn12 ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> consider therefore , using this formula to predict how large a range of coherence length variation can be engineered over useful numerical apertures . </S>",
    "<S> the reader will notice , that a low nas , when only a few of the transverse cavity modes are sampled , the coherence is near to that of the cavity . </S>",
    "<S> statistical fluctuations within the cavity are small since the cavity samples the emission source over a long time than its coherence time resulting in a sharper spectral line and enhanced coherence properties . </S>",
    "<S> the behaviour is also seen for all other emission angles into air as the cavity lifetime is approximately constant , however , the emission frequency does change with angle . at large nas , </S>",
    "<S> each cavity mode still samples the underlying emission over a longer time scale than the coherence time of the source , however , the sampled emission is reconstituted spectrally , reproducing to some extent the underlying statistical fluctuations . </S>",
    "<S> this appears to be a fair description given the observations . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , in order to create a larger range of coherence variation in these device , the finesse of the cavity must be increased and the coherence of the emission source must be minimised . most relevant , however , will be to increase the cavity finesse , over which most control can be achieved .    to test this concept , </S>",
    "<S> consider varying the cavity finesse in the model for the tuned device discussed above . </S>",
    "<S> fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3 ] shows the maximum and minimum coherence lengths for useful nas for the rcled device as a function of finesse and for a range of device tunings . here , </S>",
    "<S> _ useful _ </S>",
    "<S> na must be stressed : the maximum coherence corresponds to the na through which at least @xmath58 % of the device power emitted into air is sampled while the minimum coherence is limited by the limitation of coupling optics set here at an angle of @xmath59 . </S>",
    "<S> these limits are illustrated at the top left corner of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3 ] .    despite the restrictions on useful na , </S>",
    "<S> a large variation in coherence length is apparent in this extrapolated example as is evident from fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3 ] . increasing the finesse by an order of magnitude , increases the maximum coherence length by just over a factor of @xmath60 . </S>",
    "<S> the minimum na is increased by nearly a factor of @xmath61 . </S>",
    "<S> the range of coherence lengths , on the other hand goes from @xmath62 m to @xmath63 m such that it almost spans an entire order of magnitude .    </S>",
    "<S> it was evident in the result of figs .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1 ] a ) and  [ fig1 ] b ) that the maximum coherence length occurs at the tuning angle or wavelength . </S>",
    "<S> this behaviour is also seen in the results of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3 ] where the maximum coherence length occurs for a tuned sample and indeed gives the greatest variation over useful nas . </S>",
    "<S> quantitatively , this amounts to a @xmath61 fold increase in maximum coherence for a tuned device compared with a @xmath64 nm detuned , which would be used for greater power extraction into large nas . </S>",
    "<S> clearly , high finesse , tuned microcavity devices provide the greatest coherence variation over useful nas .    </S>",
    "<S> the self coherence function for planar microcavities has been modelled using an analytical formula based on the underlying self coherence functions of the emitter and microcavity . </S>",
    "<S> the correspondence of the measured coherence of two rcled samples and the coherence model described by eqns .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eqn12 ] ) and  ( [ eqn16 ] ) is compelling . </S>",
    "<S> firstly , a good function fit to the coherence lengths of fourier transformed spectra sampled at discrete angles was found . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the same fitting parameters reproduced closely , the coherence variation as a function of na , by integrating over the whole set of emission states.@xcite    the central result of this analysis is the observation that the coherence of the device is dependent on the underlying coherence of the cavity and emitter . </S>",
    "<S> indeed the underlying statistical fluctuation of the light source are exposed when varying na . at low nas , </S>",
    "<S> the coherence length is close to that of the microcavity . at large nas , </S>",
    "<S> the coherence length is closer to that of the underlying emitter . </S>",
    "<S> a key aspect of the modelling shows that the coherence properties of planar microcavities can be engineered through microcavity design and selection of an emitter with suitable coherence properties . here </S>",
    "<S> , the model was used to predict a larger range of coherence variation by increasing the finesse of the microcavity . </S>",
    "<S> coherence lengths across an order of magnitude could be achieved if these design consideration were considered carefully .    </S>",
    "<S> these observations suggest that variable coherence is a result of a filtering mechanism ; this is also the spectral domain picture of microcavity emission . </S>",
    "<S> however , in the coherence domain , it is the statistical fluctuations of the light source that are filtered by the slow microcavity sampling time . </S>",
    "<S> this is the only robust interpretation that can reconcile the difference in coherence between planar microcavity emission viewed through small and large nas and raises questions about the relationship between the emission lifetime and coherence time in any type of microcavity device .    </S>",
