    "much experimental and theoretical work has been devoted to the study of quantum phase transitions in recent years @xcite .",

    "heavy fermion ( hf ) compounds provide an opportunity to study such phenomena since a variety of ground states , from weak antiferromagnetic to pauli paramagnetic states , can be realized by tuning @xmath3 .",
    "hf physics has been long understood from the point of view of the so - called doniach phase diagram describing the competition between the formation of a non - magnetic kondo singlet and the realization of an ordered state via the rkky ( ruderman - kittel - kasuya - yosida ) interactions @xcite .",
    "renewed interest in this field has came about from precise studies of the quantum critical point ( qcp ) in itinerant magnets and the marginal behavior observed near the qcp , in particular the so - called non - fermi liquid ( nfl ) behavior @xcite .",
    "only a few studies have been performed on single crystals using inelastic neutron scattering ( ins ) .",

    ", only two systems were extensively studied near the qcp : cecu@xmath9 doped with au on the cu site @xcite and ceru@xmath2si@xmath2 doped with la on the ce site@xcite . for the latter systems experiments with rh substitution on the ru site were also performed @xcite . in these works , the magnetic excitation spectrum of two samples were studied , one in the paramagnetic phase ( @xmath10 ) and one located near the instability point ( @xmath11 ) . while these two studies bear similar experimental results : reduction of the energy scale near the qcp and increase of the correlation length , emphasise was put on different points . for cecu@xmath12au@xmath13 ,",
    "the anisotropy of the magnetic response @xcite was put forward to explain the nfl behavior observed in bulk measurements and @xmath14 scaling was found in the dynamical spin susceptibility @xcite . in the latter ce@xmath15la@xmath13ru@xmath2si@xmath2 system ,",
    "the accent was put on the self consistent renormalized spin fluctuation ( sf ) theory of moriya @xcite which allows to link the magnetic excitation spectrum to the bulk measurements and their evolution towards the qcp @xcite .    here",
    "we propose a different experimental approach starting from an antiferromagnetic compound and studying the evolution of the magnetic excitation spectrum with pressure up to 5 kbar .",
    "this spans the phase diagram through the qcp at finite temperature .",
    "the main advantage is that the same crystal is used throughout , avoiding the problem of disorder which is difficult to handle when results obtained on crystals with different concentration @xmath6 are compared .",
    "the disadvantage is that the temperature range is limited by the experimental setup ( pressure cell ) both on the lower and higher temperature sides .",
    "ceru@xmath2si@xmath2 crystallizes in the body centred tetragonal @xmath16 space group with the lattice parameters @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",

    "@xmath21 la . the crystal studied here with @xmath6=0.13 , grown by the czochralsky method , has a volume of 250 mm@xmath22 @xcite .",
    "experiments were carried out on the cold tas in14 at the ill high flux reactor , grenoble .",
    "a first set of measurements was performed in a standard orange cryostat at ambient pressure and a second set was carried out in an helium transmitting medium pressure cell made of al alloy in a large he flow orange cryostat .",
    "the experimental conditions were the same for both experiments using the constant final energy mode with k@xmath23=1.97 @xmath24 .",
    "the collimations were open-40-60-60 and a graphite filter was used in order to reduce higher order contamination . with this setup",
    "the width of the incoherent peak ( full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) of a gaussian profile ) was 0.35 mev .",
    "these conditions were chosen to minimize the background ( flat analyzer and collimations ) which appears to be crucial for the experiment in the pressure cell .",
    "a window of cadmium ( neutron absorber ) was put around the cryostat in order to cut the background of the pressure cell .",
    "measurements were performed above 2.6 k to avoid the presence of superfluid he from the flow around the pressure cell .",

    "the overall data show the reliability of the pressure cell . above 2.8 kbar",
    ", no sign of magnetic ordering is found down to 1.8 k. if the pressure variation of the nel temperature is fitted according to the relation expected for a 3 dimensionnal antiferromagnet near the qcp : @xmath32 the critical pressure is @xmath33=3.4 kbar .",
    "it is also predicted that the @xmath34=0 staggered magnetic moment @xmath35 will follow the relation : @xmath36 from our measurements , it is clear that @xmath35 does not follow a simple law like ( 2 ) .",
    "this quantity rapidly drops at low pressure and then has the tendency to saturate .",
    "such a behavior was preciselly studied for alloys of the family ce(ru@xmath15rh@xmath13)@xmath2si@xmath2 @xcite ( this is not the purpose of the present work which concentrates on the dynamics ) .",
    "it is thus difficult to extract @xmath33 from the pressure variation of @xmath35 , an upper estimate would be 2.2 kbar .",
    "another estimate of @xmath33 can be given from the bulk measurements performed on several concentrations or under pressure in this family of compounds .",
    "resitivity measurements performed for @xmath6=0.2 under pressure show that 2.4 @xmath21 of dilution corresponds to 1 kbar @xcite . for the compound studied here with @xmath6=0.13 , this will give an expected @xmath33 of 2.1 kbar . in the following , we will take the mean value of these three different estimates : @xmath33=2.6 @xmath37 0.5 kbar .",
    "the magnetic excitation spectrum is shown in fig.[raymond2 ] for several * q * vectors ( * q*=(@xmath38,1,0 ) where @xmath38 is expressed in reciprocal lattice units ( r.l.u . ) ) at 2.6 k. the corresponding wave - vector response is shown in the inset of fig.[raymond2 ] for two energy transfers of 0.8 and 1.5 mev .",
    "the signal is peaked at @xmath38=0.69 for both energies and the lineshape broadens when energy increases .",
    "the response in energy is quasielastic as shown in fig.[raymond2 ] for @xmath38=0.72 .",
    "this wave - vector is chosen to be * k*+(0.03,0,0 ) where * k * is the wave - vector of instability in order to avoid strong bragg contamination .",
    "this offset has no consequences on the determined physical quantities ( energy widths ) since the signal we measured does not vary rapidly around * k * in the energy range probed with our instrumental resolution .",
    "despite the fact that the compound is ordered , the spectrum is characteristic of sf and no well defined ( single mode ) excitations are observed .",
    "the background of the spectrometer ( determined for negative energy transfer at low temperature ) does not correspond to the background of the constant @xmath7 scan suggesting the existence of a * q * independent ( or single - site ) contribution as in other compounds of this familly @xcite .",
    "consequently , we used the same procedure as in the previous works on @xmath6=0 @xcite and @xmath26=0.075 @xcite for a quantitative analysis of the data .",
    "this procedure accounts for the background in a consistent way for both constant * q * and constant @xmath7 scans .",
    "in the first works on ceru@xmath2si@xmath2 , the single - site contribution was not taken into account @xcite since only high magnetic field studies unambiguously underline the existence of this contribution @xcite . by applying a magnetic field ,",
    "the correlated part of the signal vanishes and only the * q * independent contribution persists at the same level of intensity that was determined at @xmath5=0 . in a similar fashion to the applied external magnetic field case",
    ", we will also show that this decomposition of the magnetic scattering into single - site and correlated signal is very convenient for understanding experiments carried out under pressure . in this approach ,",
    "the neutron intensity is written :    @xmath39    where @xmath40 is the background intensity , @xmath41 is the bose factor and @xmath42 and @xmath43 are respectively the imaginary part of the single site and intersite magnetic dynamical susceptibility .",
    "the single - site contribution is assumed to be lorentzian , reflecting local @xmath44 spin relaxation :    @xmath45    where @xmath46 is the local susceptibility and @xmath47 is the local fluctuation rate .",
    "it is related to the kondo temperature @xmath48 ( @xmath49 @xcite ) . for the correlated signal",
    ", we use the following formula were * q = q-@xmath31-k * :    @xmath50    where @xmath51 is the * q * dependent part of the suceptibility , @xmath52 is the intersite fluctuation rate and @xmath53 is an inelastic energy which clearly better describes the data obtained for compounds of this familly located in the paramagnetic region @xcite . in this paper , we will focus on the response in energy at the wave vector * k * and will note @xmath54 .",
    "it is also found that @xmath53 does not depends of * q * as was already known from studies of other compositions .",
    "the single site contribution is unambiguously determined at * q*=(0.46,1,0 ) in a part of the brillouin zone where the signal is flat in * q * ( see inset of fig.[raymond2 ] ) and thus @xmath55=0 .",
    "the fit to the data is shown in fig.[raymond2 ] .",
    "since the neutron intensity is not normalized , we are only interested in the energy width , @xmath47=1.4 ( 2 ) mev .",
    "a fit at the vector * k * is also shown in fig.[raymond2 ] .",
    "we found for the offset @xmath56=0.03 ( @xmath57 ) at 2.6 k in the ordered phase , @xmath58=0.15 ( 3 ) mev and @xmath59=0.10 ( 5 ) mev .",
    "contrarily to the pure compound ceru@xmath2si@xmath2 , the determination of @xmath59 lies in the limits of the fit since it is smaller than the resolution .",
    "it is worth noting that the determined value of @xmath58 does not change much if @xmath59 is fixed to zero . for comparison ,",
    "the values obtained at 2.6 k for the compounds corresponding to @xmath6=0 and @xmath26=0.075 are shown in table 1 .",
    "the @xmath56 dependence was described by expanding    @llll x&@xmath58&@xmath59&@xmath47 + 0&0.77 ( 5)&0.5 ( 1)&2.0 ( 1 ) + 0.075&0.17 ( 2)&0.2 ( 1)&1.4 ( 1 ) + 0.13&0.15(3)&0.10(5)&1.4 ( 2 ) +    @xmath60=@xmath58(1+@xmath61 ) in ( 5 ) and assuming that @xmath62=constant @xcite .",
    "the fit to the data obtained at 0.8 and 1.5 mev are shown in the inset of fig.[raymond2 ] with a value of @xmath63=0.05 r.l.u .",
    "this corresponds to a correlation length @xmath64 @xmath65 13 @xmath20 that is around 3 lattice units .",
    "this is the correlation length of the remaining longitudinal fluctuations after magnetic order is established in this system .",
    "this must not to be confused with the correlation length introduced in phase transition theory which diverges at @xmath28 or at @xmath33 .",
    "this latter quantity needs to be measured in a double - axis configuration in order to have an energy integrated signal .",
    "the analysis was repeated for several temperatures .",
    "on increasing @xmath34 , the magnetic excitation spectrum broadens continuously .",
    "of interest is the temperature variation of @xmath58 .",
    "this quantity is shown in fig .",
    "[ raymond3 ] .",
    "the temperature variation is almost linear above @xmath28 , slowing down and eventualy saturating below @xmath28 .",
    "in contrast , the quantity @xmath47 is almost temperature independent in the studied range of 1.5 - 20 k. at higher temperature , for @xmath66 , it is expected that @xmath47 will acquire some temperature dependence @xcite .",
    "similarly to the temperature dependence studied at zero pressure , we also studied the evolution of the spin dynamics with pressure at constant temperature of 2.6 k. fig.[raymond4 ] shows the neutron intensity measured versus pressure for two energy transfers of 1 and 6 mev .",
    "the spectrometer background measured for an energy transfer of -1 mev at 2.6 k is subtracted .",
    "these data show that the low energy response decreases when pressure increases while the high energy part is not sensitive to pressure .",
    "a crossover between low energy and high energy dynamics therefore needs to be defined . in the framework of quantum phase transition and for a gapless system @xcite",
    ", this crossover energy @xmath67 is the relevant quantity to study the qcp ( i.e. @xmath68 at the qcp ) .",
    "the analysis of the dynamical spin susceptibility of this system in a single - site and inter - site contributions provides us with a natural way of defining such a crossover .",
    "indeed , the high energy part corresponds to a single - site only contribution . in the following",
    ", we will simply take @xmath69 . in this respect both pressure and magnetic field suppress the inter - site contribution in a similar ways ( see fig.8 of ref @xcite in comparison with fig.[raymond4 ] ) .",
    "fig.[raymond5 ] shows the evolution of the inter - site signal measured at * q*=(0.7,1,0 ) after subtraction of the data from the single - site signal measured at each pressure at * q*=(0.46,1,0 ) . at zero pressure ( upper frame )",
    ", a bragg contribution appears at negative energy transfer due to the choice of the focusing conditions ( offset @xmath56=0.01 ) .",
    "the inelastic signal broadens with increasing pressure and at 4.7 kbar it is very similar to the one of the pure compound ceru@xmath2si@xmath2 ( see fig.9 in ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "the pressure variation of @xmath58 is shown in fig.[raymond6]a .",
    "the data obtained at the same temperature for the alloy corresponding to the critical concentration , @xmath26=0.075 , and to the pure compound , @xmath6=0 , are shown in the same plot with the concentration - pressure conversion explained in the first section .",
    "there is an acceptable agreement with these former measurements and our present measurements under pressure .",
    "the data presented in this way exhibit some noise due to the fact that they were taken from different experiments with different setups .",
    "there is thus no correlations between the error bars for the points obtained under pressure and for the ones obtained on the alloys .",
    "all the more , the data taken under pressure lead also to higher error bars since the background is higher .",
    "nevertheless , this correct agreement stresses the validity of the analogy between concentration and pressure in the limit of small disorder .    despite the limited statistics of the data",
    ", it seems that the energy width saturates below the critical pressure @xmath33 as it does below @xmath28 at @xmath4=0 .",
    "indeed the two sets of data @xmath70 and @xmath71 are strikingly similar .",
    "the data clearly show that the increase of @xmath58 is much higher in the non - magnetic phase above 3 kbar . to reproduce this behavior",
    ", we made a global fit of these data to the phenomenological expression : @xmath72 with @xmath73=0.19 ( 2 ) mev , @xmath74=0.4 ( 2 ) mevkbar@xmath24 and @xmath75= 7 ( 2 ) kbar .",
    "this expression reproduces the saturation of @xmath58 at low pressure and is linear in @xmath4 for @xmath76 .",
    "the pressure variation of @xmath47 is shown in fig.[raymond6]b .",
    "this quantity increases only slightly in the pressure range studied .",
    "this confirms the idea that high energy dynamics do not change much with pressure .",
    "the data are phenomenologicaly described by the smooth variation @xmath77 with @xmath78=1.3 ( 1 ) mev and @xmath79=0.025 ( 5 ) mevkbar@xmath80 .",
    "finally , the pressure variation of @xmath59 is shown in the inset of fig .",
    "[ raymond6]b .",
    "it is very similar to the one of @xmath58 .",
    "the relation @xmath59",
    "0.6@xmath58 approximately holds . beyond these phenomenological descriptions ,",
    "an order of magnitude can be extracted for the pressure varition of the different characteristic energies @xmath82 ( @xmath83 or @xmath59 ) .",
    "when taken the pressure range studied @xmath84 as a whole , all these quantities increase with a quite similar rate of @xmath85 1 kkbar@xmath24 .",
    "we first discuss the nature of the excitations in the ordered phase . due to the strong ising nature of the system @xcite , the observation of spin waves by ins",
    "is precluded .",
    "the observed excitations correspond to fluctuations of the order parameter ( longitudinal fluctuations ) .",
    "this was previously established by ins on ceru@xmath2si@xmath2 @xcite .",
    "the fact that the excitations are not well - defined dispersive modes is understood from the magnetic structure of the system . for an incommensurate structure , * q * is not a good quantum number due to the lack of translational invariance .",
    "ins measurements probe the dynamical susceptibility at ( * q*,@xmath7 ) and this corresponds here to the coupling of several eigen - modes giving a broad signal @xcite .",
    "this is not the case for real antiferromagnetic structure where longitudinal well - defined dispersive modes can be observed in compounds with weak magnetic moments .",
    "such modes were measured by ins in uru@xmath2si@xmath2 @xcite .",
    "our data show similar results when the ordered phase is reached either by varying temperature or pressure .",
    "the fluctuation rate seems to reach a constant and finite value in the ordered phase .",
    "this behavior can be partly understood from the point of view of the magnetic sum rule which states that the total magnetic scattering integrated over * q * and @xmath7 is proportional to the square of the magnetic moment of the ion ( in fact @xmath86 in the quantum mechanical treatment of a spin @xmath87 ) . since the ordered moment at @xmath34 @xmath65 0 , @xmath4 @xmath65 0 ( @xmath35=1.05 @xmath29 ) does not reach the saturated value ( @xmath88 ) determined by the crystal field ground state ( @xmath65 1.7 @xmath29 ) , and since spin - waves are not present , the presence of longitudinal fluctuations is necessary in order to satisfy the magnetic sum rule . in particular , we do not observe any complete softening either of @xmath70 at @xmath33 or of @xmath71 at @xmath28 .",
    "this can also be partly understood with the same argument .",
    "this is also linked to the itinerant nature of the magnetic order , as discussed in the following subsection .",
    "our data suggest that the magnetic order has the form of a spin density wave at least down to the lowest measured temperature of 1.5 k. firstly , we are able to accurately follow the local fluctuation rate , @xmath47 as a function of pressure , which does not vanish at the qcp but smoothly decreases from the disordered to the ordered state .",
    "this quantity reflects the mechanism of local relaxation of 4@xmath89 moments that is the kondo effect .",
    "this implies that there is no breakdown of the kondo effect at @xmath33 in the ce@xmath15la@xmath13ru@xmath2si@xmath2 system .",
    "secondly , the magnetic order realized for @xmath6=0.13 is purely sinusoidal since no higher harmonics were found down to the lowest temperatures @xcite .",
    "this also points towards a sdw picture since such a pure sinusoidal modulation is typical of itinerant magnetism while squaring of the modulation occurs in localized spin systems .",
    "indeed , in ce@xmath15la@xmath13ru@xmath2si@xmath2 , higher harmonics were found to develop for @xmath90 0.2 @xcite .",
    "such a crossover from a sdw to a local magnetism is also observed in the similar ce(ru@xmath15rh@xmath13)@xmath2si@xmath2 compounds @xcite .",
    "the underlying hypothesis of an itinerant magnetism description is that a fermi surface is well defined throughout the whole phase diagram .    in the past years",
    ", neutron scattering data and bulk measurements obtained on the ce@xmath15la@xmath13ru@xmath2si@xmath2 system were self consistently analyzed in the moriya s sf theory @xcite .",
    "the finite fluctuation rate measured by neutron scattering around @xmath33 must be obviously related to the observation that the resistivity always reaches a @xmath91 dependence at the lowest temperature and that concomitently , the specific heat is always linear in @xmath34 .",
    "our new ins data confirm such a picture .",
    "the dynamical spin susceptibility , which is a phenomenological starting point of sf theory , was also recently deduced form a microscopic model taking equally into account both the kondo effect and the rkky interactions ; the ins cross section derived is very similar to the one used in this paper @xcite .      in the cecu@xmath12au@xmath13 system",
    ", the qcp is reached for @xmath92 .",
    "nfl behavior observed either at @xmath33 or @xmath26 in this system ( linear resistivity , logarithmic divergence of the specific heat ) was extensively studied by the karlsruhe group @xcite .",
    "it is believed that such a behavior implies a new theoretical treatement of the qcp in a strong coupling approach , a local picture where the fermi liquid description breaks down @xcite .",
    "the underlying idea is that both @xmath28 and @xmath48 go to zero at the qcp : the ordered phase is characteristic of local magnetism . concerning ins , the landmark of such a behavior is the so - called @xmath14 scaling of the dynamical spin susceptibility @xcite . in the description",
    "developped here , this means that @xmath58 equals @xmath93 ( no single - site signal was identified in these studies @xcite . ) .",
    "this obviously implies that ( i ) the fluctuation rate totally softens at the qcp . ] and ( ii ) @xmath7 and @xmath34 are similarly weighted in the spin dynamics . on the contrary , in the sf approach , the fluctuation rate @xmath58 is written @xmath94 @xcite where @xmath95 at the qcp and @xmath96 is constant . following this argument",
    ", @xmath97 scaling would be expected for a 3 dimensional system near the qcp ( in the cas @xmath96 @xmath65 1 ) .",
    "this difference with the observed @xmath14 scaling in cecu@xmath98au@xmath99 has a deeper meaning . in the itinerant magnetism model @xcite , a system in the vicinity of a qcp is above the critical dimension ( @xmath100=4 above which the landau theory is valid )",
    "this is linked to the increasing importance of the fluctuations in time at @xmath34=0 near the qcp .",
    "formaly , this is described by the dynamical exponent @xmath101 ( @xmath101=2 for an itinerant antiferromagnet ) and the effective dimension of the system becomes @xmath102 where @xmath103 is the geometrical dimension @xcite . on the contrary",
    ", the scaling observed in cecu@xmath98au@xmath99 implies that the system is below the critical dimension .",
    "the origin of this behavior is believed to be in the anomalous spin dynamics @xcite implying that the effective dimension is lower by 1/2 compared to the usual scenario of quantum phase transitions .",
    "these results need new theoretical treatement beyond the current understanding of the qcp .    in ce@xmath15la@xmath13ru@xmath2si@xmath2 , a complete softening of @xmath58",
    "is not observed at the qcp as already discussed . for this system , it is experimentally clear that @xmath104 at the qcp but that @xmath48 stays finite in the ordered phase .",
    "this latter quantity may collapse far in the magnetic phase .",
    "concerning the temperature variation of @xmath58 , it follows the sf prediction ( @xmath105 ) with @xmath96 @xmath65 0.2 mevk@xmath106 as measured for @xmath11 .",
    "it is important to note that the value of @xmath96 is the same for ceru@xmath2si@xmath2 and thus does not evolve with @xmath4 or @xmath6 .",
    "the same remark holds for the system cecu@xmath12au@xmath13 : the slope of the order unity found de facto in the @xmath14 scaling for @xmath58 is also found for pure cecu@xmath9 @xcite .",
    "the results obtained on the systems cecu@xmath12au@xmath13 and ce@xmath15la@xmath13ru@xmath2si@xmath2 are quite different since the former seems to be the paradigm of the strong coupling theory while the latter is the paradigm of sf theory .",
    "the behavior observed at a magnetic non - magnetic qcp is thus not universal .",
    "what still remains surprising is that pure cecu@xmath9 and ceru@xmath2si@xmath2 compounds are very similar while their respective qcp are so different .",
    "regarding the low energy scales involved in cecu@xmath9 , it is not excluded that the observed physics corresponds to the fact that the fermi surface is not yet developped at the temperatures experimentally achievable . to test this possibility , @xmath14 scaling",
    "must be searched in ce@xmath15la@xmath13ru@xmath2si@xmath2 for @xmath107 near the qcp .",
    "the idea is that such a scaling may apply in a temperature range above the @xmath108 regime experimentally observed and predicted by sf theory .",
    "this study is , to our knowledge , the first ins investigation of the qcp performed on single crystal where pressure is the control parameter for the magnetic non - magnetic phase diagram .",
    "the data obtained show a quantitative similarity between the approach of the magnetic phase versus pressure or temperature .",
    "our results are in agreement with the previous experiments performed on alloys near the qcp ( @xmath109 ) and in the paramagnetic phase @xmath10 .",
    "our overall data on the compounds of the ce@xmath15la@xmath13ru@xmath2si@xmath2 family strongly support the sf approach . in the future emphasise",
