    "the gauge / gravity correspondence is a fascinating topic in the study of string theory . a certain class of it preserving a conformal symmetry , in which a string theory is defined on an anti - de sitter ( ads ) space and its dual is a conformal field theory ( cft ) ,",
    "is called the ads / cft correspondence @xcite .",
    "a prototypical example is a duality between type iib string theory on the ads@xmath0s@xmath1 background and the four - dimensional @xmath4 @xmath5 super yang - mills theory in the large @xmath6 limit .",
    "remarkably , the integrability structure exists behind it and hence one can check the conjectured relations in a rigorous way by employing various integrability techniques ( for a big review , see @xcite ) .",
    "in particular , the ads@xmath0s@xmath1 superstring is classically integrable in the sense of kinematical integrability @xcite .",
    "the integrability exposed in this case is , however , rarely exceptional and such a good property is not equipped with general examples of the ads / cft ( or gauge / gravity ) correspondence .",
    "holographic interpretations in the gauge / gravity correspondence are usually concerned with curved string backgrounds and hence classical motions of a string are described by non - linear equations .",
    "but most of the non - linear equations are not integrable and therefore the behavior of classical string solutions should become chaotic .",
    "more intriguingly , the holographic counterpart of chaotic strings should exist on the gauge - theory side as well , but it has not been clarified yet .",
    "if it has been done , then one could open up a new frontier in the study of the gauge / gravity correspondence .",
    "a well - studied example of non - integrable backgrounds is ads@xmath7 @xcite , where @xmath8 is a five - dimensional sasaki - einstein space @xcite has been completed with a supertrace operation @xcite . ] .",
    "chaotic string solutions were found in @xcite by computing poincar sections . the chaotic behavior remains even in a near - penrose limit @xcite .",
    "similar studies have been done for many backgrounds in the preceding works @xcite .",
    "similarly , chaotic motions of d0-branes can also be studied as well as classical strings .",
    "the d0-brane dynamics is described by a matrix model proposed by banks , fischler , shenker and susskind ( bfss ) @xcite .",
    "chaotic d0-branes in the bfss matrix model were studied in @xcite by following a seminal paper on chaos in a classical yang - mills theory @xcite . in comparison to the bfss case , a matrix model on a pp - wave background , which was proposed by berenstein , maldacena and nastase ( bmn ) @xcite ,",
    "has a strong advantage that there is no flat direction and all of the trajectories are definitely bounded .",
    "classical chaos in the bmn matrix model was shown in @xcite by following @xcite .",
    "the chaos at finite temperature was also studied in @xcite in relation to the fast scrambler scenario @xcite . a very recent work @xcite investigated chaotic motions of chiral condensates in a holographic qcd setup @xcite and displayed the dependence of lyapunov exponent on the rank of gauge group @xmath6 and t hooft coupling @xmath9 .",
    "a lot of achievements have been obtained for the chaotic behavior of strings and d - branes as introduced above .",
    "motivated by this progress , we are concerned here with an application of melnikov s method @xcite in the context of the gauge / gravity correspondence .",
    "this method can show analytically the existence of chaos generated by a smale horseshoe , though its applicability is somewhat restricted . in this paper",

    "section 4 is devoted to conclusion and discussion . in appendix [ elliptic functions ] , the definitions and useful identities of elliptic functions are summarized .",
    "appendix [ apx : calc ] explains a detailed computation of melnikov function for a spinning string ansatz .",
    "in this section , we shall give a brief introduction of melnikov s method .",
    "this is an analytical method to argue the existence of classical chaos .",
    "the key ingredient in this method is the so - called melnikov function and its simple zero points are related to a discrete dynamical system , smale s horseshoe , which generates a certain class of chaos .",
    "let us concentrate on a continuous dynamical system composed of two particles which has the hamiltonian represented by a direct sum like @xmath10 .",
    "the four - dimensional phase space is spanned by the coordinates @xmath11 and the conjugate momenta @xmath12 .",
    "we are concerned with evolution of @xmath13 and @xmath12 in time @xmath14 .",
    "it is also supposed that @xmath15 has a homoclinic orbit ( fig .",
    "[ fig : separatrix ] ) with a hyperbolic saddle point @xmath16 .",
    "the existence of the homoclinic orbit is surely crucial so as to apply melnikov s method . in other words",
    ", this condition somewhat restricts the applicability of this method .",
    "phase space with a hyperbolic saddle point @xmath16 and the other two types of orbits .",
    "the concentric rings inside the homoclinic orbit describe oscillation while the open trajectories outside it come from the infinity , surround the homoclinic orbit and go away to the infinity again . ]",
    "this system is integrable because the hamiltonian is separable and one can solve the equation of motion as a one dimensional hamiltonian system .",
    "then , once a certain small perturbation is added to the integrable system , the integrability is broken and orbits near the homoclinic one are likely to be chaotic ( c.f . , kam theorem @xcite ) . when the perturbation is turned on , the homoclinic orbit opens up in general as in fig .",
    "[ fig : homoclinic - orbit ] , while the saddle point survives up to a slight deviation of the location ( i.e. , the saddle is not resolved but just moves a little bit ) . then there still remain a stable manifold @xmath17 and an unstable one @xmath18 which meats at the saddle point .",
    "the stable manifold is defined as the set of points that get infinitely close to the saddle point by time evolution .",
    "similarly , the unstable manifold is the set of points getting closer to the saddle point by the inverse evolution . in general , the two manifolds are separated after the system is perturbed , while each of them is closed at the saddle point and forms a closed loop called a homoclinic orbit ( i.e. , the degeneracy of the stable and unstable manifolds ) in the non - perturbed system .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     the idea of melnikov s method is to argue whether the stable manifold and the unstable manifold have a point of transverse intersection , i.e. , a transverse homoclinic point . when the system is perturbed by a small interaction term @xmath19 where @xmath20 is a small real parameter , the orbits on these manifolds are expressed as perturbative expansions from the original ones by an infinitesimal parameter @xmath20 .",
    "then , one can define the separation between those manifolds , which is proportional to the melnikov function .",
    "in particular , in the case that at least one transverse homoclinic point exists , a certain class of chaos is generated by smale s horseshoe ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : horseshoe phase ] ) .",
    "the saddle point expands small phase - space volume @xmath21 around the saddle point @xmath16 into long thin volume @xmath22 along the unstable manifold to @xmath16 , @xmath18 , and its end tip reaches the stable manifold @xmath17 at a transverse homoclinic point @xmath23 .",
    "then the area @xmath24 along the stable manifold is compressed into a vicinity around the saddle point , @xmath21 .",
    "this one cycle of process transforms @xmath21 to a u - shaped form , which looks like a horseshoe . to be more precise ,",
    "two horizontal strips @xmath25 and @xmath26 in @xmath21 which move to the intersections of @xmath22 and @xmath24 by successive poincar maps , are mapped into two vertical strips @xmath27 and @xmath28 in @xmath21 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : horseshoemap ] .",
    "this is smale s horseshoe map .",
    "the smale - birkhoff homoclinic theorem states that this map has a hyperbolic invariant set , which is a direct product of cantor sets . by the repetition of this map",
    ", a chaotic behavior appears near the saddle point and the transverse homoclinic points .",
    "if the melnikov function has a simple zero point , then the stable manifold and the unstable manifold have a transverse intersection and the system exhibits chaos due to the above argument .",
    "thus the criterion to determine whether chaos of smale s horseshoe type appears or not is boiled down to a simple calculation of the melnikov function .     is mapped to the red area @xmath22 , and thereafter the blue area @xmath24 is mapped to @xmath21 .",
    "note that these areas overlap with one another and the colors in the overlapping regions are different from the original ones .",
    "the entire map is regarded as a horseshoe map .",
    "a similar argument is applicable to the case with a heteroclinic orbit . ]     and @xmath26 are mapped onto the vertical strips @xmath27 and @xmath28 . in the end , the initial square is transformed to another square .",
    "these squares correspond to the region @xmath21 in the phase space . ]    in order to apply melnikov s method , it is convenient to transform a canonical pair , say @xmath29 and @xmath30 , into the action - angle variables @xmath31 and @xmath32 , while the others are kept so as to preserve the homoclinic structure .",
    "section [ sec : stand - meln - meth ] is devoted to the standard review of melnikov s method .",
    "some simple examples are presented in sec .  [ 2.2 ] .",
    "if the resulting variables do not form a canonical pair , the hamiltonian generally can not be separated into a direct sum , and hence melnikov s method has to be modified .",
    "such a case often arises in some studies of a string sigma model with an ads - like geometry .",
    "this modification of melnikov s method will be discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : spec - meln - meth ] .",
    "first of all , we will briefly introduce the reduction method of a four - dimensional system with @xmath11 and the conjugate momenta @xmath12 to a two - dimensional system , as presented in @xcite .",
    "the non - perturbed hamiltonian @xmath33 is supposed to be a direct sum of two classically integrable systems like @xmath34 and the interaction between them is turned on as a small perturbation @xmath35 , where @xmath20 is an infinitesimal real constant .",
    "that is , the total hamiltonian @xmath36 is given by @xmath37 in the following , we assume that @xmath38 is periodic in @xmath29 and @xmath15 has a homoclinic orbit . the existence of the homoclinic orbit is crucial in melnikov s method .      it is convenient to transform @xmath29 and @xmath30 into the angle - action variables @xmath32 and @xmath31 .",
    "then the hamiltonian @xmath36 can be rewritten as @xmath39 the hamilton equations are given by @xmath40 where the symbol `` @xmath41 '' stands for the derivative with respect to @xmath14 .",

    "this dynamical system is essentially three - dimensional because the energy @xmath43 is conserved . just for convenience ,",
    "the unperturbed frequency is supposed to be positive , namely @xmath44 when @xmath20 is sufficiently small , @xmath32 becomes a monotonically increasing function from the first equation in ( [ eom ] ) .",
    "then , thanks to the @xmath14-independence in the dynamical system , one can set @xmath32 as a new time for the system by deleting @xmath14 .",

    "to explain the role of the melnikov function in this method , we employ the poincar map at @xmath59 with a perturbation parameter @xmath20 by @xmath60 , where @xmath61 is a value modulo the period . by this poincar map , a point on a orbit at @xmath61",

    "let us consider a small vicinity @xmath62 around the transverse homoclinic point on the orbit .",
    "this can be mapped to a neighborhood of the saddle point @xmath21 by finite numbers of forward or backward actions of @xmath60 .",

    "therefore , what we have to do here is to show the existence of the transverse homoclinic point . to verify the condition to ensure its existence ,",

    "one can express a solution of on the stable manifold as @xmath65 for @xmath66 , and on the unstable manifold as @xmath67 for @xmath68 . here the variables @xmath69 and @xmath70 describe a separatrix solution to at @xmath71 .",

    "the argument of the melnikov function ( [ mel - t ] ) is given by @xmath61 .",

    ".      it would be helpful to see examples of computing the melnikov functions .",
    "let us show here two examples : 1 ) a dynamical system composed of a coordinate variable @xmath23 and its conjugate momentum @xmath16 with a time - dependent perturbation , 2 ) a four - dimensional dynamical system composed of two coordinate variables @xmath29 , @xmath50 and their conjugate momenta @xmath30 , @xmath51 with a time - independent perturbation .",
    "these examples are discussed in detail in @xcite and @xcite , respectively .",
    "more precisely speaking , the first example is a three - dimensional dynamical system .",
    "this case has not been covered in the previous subsection , but the computation scheme is almost the same .",
    "a central difference is that the reduction process is not necessary .",
    "it would really be instructive to study this case and to capture the essential idea of the melnikov function .",
    "we consider a pendulum system with a periodic external force described by the hamiltonian , @xmath100 and it depends on time @xmath14 explicitly .",
    "then the hamilton equations are given by @xmath101 here @xmath20 is an infinitesimal constant .",
    "note that these equations can be regarded as those of reduced systems like ( [ eq : q , p ] ) by replacing @xmath14 with @xmath32 .",
    "this point is also concerned with the footnote 5 .",
    "when the perturbation is turned off ( i.e. , @xmath71 ) and the energy @xmath43 is set to 1 , this system exhibits a separatrix solution given by @xmath102 the pendulum simply oscillates around the stable fixed point @xmath103 below @xmath104 , while the pendulum rotates all the way above @xmath104 .    then by substituting the reduced equations ( [ example1 ] ) and the homoclinic solution ( [ example1-sol ] ) into the formula ( [ melnikov fn reduced ] ) , the melnikov function can be computed as @xmath105 it has nontrivial simple zeros at @xmath106 .",
    "hence , when @xmath43 is close to @xmath107 , the pendulum behaves in a weird manner  it switches oscillation and rotation randomly .",
    "this is nothing but the origin of chaotic motion .",
    "melnikov s method tells us that this chaotic motion is generated by smale s horseshoe .",
    "as the second example , let us look at a simple pendulum - oscillator system with a small perturbation .",
    "this is a four - dimensional dynamical system composed of @xmath29 , @xmath50 and the conjugate momenta @xmath30 and @xmath51 . by taking @xmath108 as a perturbation term",
    ", the perturbed hamiltonian is given by @xmath109 here @xmath20 is an infinitesimal parameter again and @xmath110 is a frequency of the oscillator .",
    "when the perturbation is turned off ( i.e. , @xmath71 ) , the system is completely separable : the one is a simple oscillator and the other is a pendulum .",
    "the variables of the oscillator @xmath29 and @xmath30 can be transformed into the action and angle variables , @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "then the hamiltonian can be rewritten as @xmath111 for the unperturbed system , the oscillation can be written as @xmath112 , and the separatrix solution of the unperturbed subsystem with @xmath98 is the same as in the previous .    when the perturbation is turned on ,",
    "the pendulum and oscillator systems begin to interact each other weakly , and the pendulum feels the motion of the oscillator through the interaction term .",
    "this situation is quite similar to the dynamical system .",
    "thus , as in sec .",
    "3.1 , the reduction method leads to a two - dimensional dynamical system to which melnikov s method can be applied .    in the present case",
    ", one can straightforwardly employ the formula . by putting @xmath42 and @xmath113 into",

    "\\label{ex2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] it is easy to see that the melnikov function ( [ ex2 ] ) has simple zeros at @xmath115 .",
    "hence this system also exhibits chaotic motions generated by smale s horseshoe .",
    "so far , we have considered melnikov s method in the standard case . for later purpose ,",
    "however , we need to generalize it slightly .",
    "the method we discuss here is a generalization of the reduction method in @xcite .    in this subsection",
    ", we are interested in the melnikov function in more intricate dynamical systems . in general ,",
    "one of @xmath116 s may depend on the other one .",
    "namely , we have in our mind the hamiltonian of the following type @xmath117 where the entire @xmath42 is supposed to be periodic in @xmath14 hereafter .",
    "then a system composed of @xmath29 and @xmath30 continues to feel a potential due to the energy of @xmath15 , even though the perturbation is turned off , i.e. , @xmath71 . in such a system , one can formally change @xmath29 and @xmath30 to @xmath31 and @xmath32 ( keeping @xmath50 and @xmath51 unchanged ) . but @xmath31 and @xmath32 fail to be a canonical pair .",
    "the hamilton equations are given by @xmath118 now we have to take account of an additional equation coming from the explicit time - dependence of the hamiltonian : @xmath119    for a moment , let us consider the case with @xmath71 .",
    "then the variables of the system become separable .",
    "when we concentrate on @xmath38 by setting @xmath15 as a constant @xmath120 , the action - angle variables can be written as @xmath121 here @xmath31 and @xmath32 satisfy @xmath122 and inversely , @xmath123    let us return to the interacting case ( @xmath124 ) . by using the relations ( [ 2.29 ] ) and ( [ 2.31 ] ) , @xmath31 and @xmath32 can be used as new variables , instead of @xmath29 and @xmath30 , even if @xmath20 is turned on .",
    "although the new variables are not canonical , one can still track their time evolution through @xmath125 in general , @xmath126 depends on @xmath15 and is assumed to be a positive constant .",
    "furthermore , suppose that a ratio of @xmath126 and the period of @xmath42 is rational for a reason explained later .",
    "then , @xmath14 can be expressed as @xmath127 and @xmath42 is periodic in @xmath32 to the leading order in @xmath20 . since the @xmath14-dependence appears only in @xmath42 ,",
    "@xmath14 can be replaced by @xmath128 as far as the quantities are computed up to the first order of @xmath20 .",
    "when @xmath20 is sufficiently small , @xmath129 becomes positive ; hence @xmath32 may be regarded as a new time coordinate for the system again .",
    "now it is a turn to reduce the degrees of freedom from @xmath130 to @xmath131 .",
    "let us first remove @xmath14 in @xmath42 by @xmath132 and the derivative with respect to @xmath14 by @xmath133 .",

    "the first is that @xmath36 is a slow variable compared to the other two .",
    "the second is that @xmath54 and @xmath56 are periodic in @xmath32 because the ratio of @xmath126 and the period of @xmath42 has been taken to be rational .",
    "this periodicity is required in melnikov s method ; hence the rational condition has been supposed just below ( [ rational ] ) .",
    "finally when @xmath36 satisfies appropriate conditions , the reduced system ( [ reduced ] ) exhibits a horseshoe for sufficiently small @xmath20 , as we will show below .    because the energy @xmath36 is not conserved ,",
    "one needs to check whether the poincar map would map a volume element on a surface with constant energy to the same surface or another surface but close to the original .",
    "let us assume that there is @xmath63 where @xmath139 has a horseshoe .",
    "@xmath63 is related to @xmath20 , and the limit @xmath140 makes @xmath141 go zero .",

    "it is sufficient to evaluate this on the homoclinic orbit because the region where a horseshoe structure appears is close to the homoclinic orbit for small @xmath20 .",
    "now , we assume that , for a certain value of @xmath36 , @xmath143 then , @xmath139 maps the energy surface to itself to leading order in @xmath20 .",
    "this means that there exists a map from a vicinity near the saddle point to itself under this condition .    before defining the melnikov function in this case",
    ", one needs to remove the explicit @xmath32-dependence in @xmath53 and @xmath55 .",
