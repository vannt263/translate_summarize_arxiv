    "the central problem in the field of nonlinear filtering ( nlf ) is to give the instantaneous and accurate estimation of the states based on the noisy observations , if enough computational resources are provided . in 1960s , duncan @xcite , mortensen @xcite and zakai @xcite independently derived the so - called dmz equation , which the unnormalized conditional density function of the states satisfies .",
    "hence the central problem in nlf is translated into solving the dmz equation in the real time and memoryless manner .",
    "it is worthy to point out that the  real time \" and  memoryless \" are the most important properties one would like to maintain in the design of the optimal / suboptimal nonlinear filters for real applications .",
    "more specifically ,  memoryless \" refers that one only needs the latest observation to update the estimation of the states without refering back to any earlier observation history ;  real time \" means that the decision of the states is made on the spot , while the observation data keep coming in .",
    "it is well known that the exact solution to the dmz equation , generally speaking , can not be written in a closed form . with the well - posedness theory of the dmz equation in mind ,",
    "many mathematicians make efforts to seek an efficient algorithm to construct a  good \" approximate solution to the dmz equation .",
    "one of the methods is the splitting - up method from the trotter product formula , which was first described in besoussan , glowinski , and rascanu @xcite , @xcite .",
    "it has been extensively studied in many articles later , for instance @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite . in 1990s ,",
    "lototsky , mikulevicius and rozovskii @xcite developed a new algorithm ( so - called s@xmath0-algorithm ) based on the cameron - martin version of wiener chaos expansion",
    ". however , the above methods require the boundedness of the drifting term and the observation term ( @xmath1 and @xmath2 in ) , which leaves out even the linear case . to overcome this restriction , yau and",
    "yau @xcite developed a novel algorithm to solve the  pathwise - robust \" dmz equation , where the boundedness of the drift term and observation term is replaced by some mild growth conditions on @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "nevertheless , they still made the assumption that the drift term , the observation term and the diffusion term are  time - invariant \" .",
    "that is to say , @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 in are not explicitly time - dependent . in @xcite , we generalized yau - yau s algorithm to the most general settings of the nlf problems   time - varying \" case  where @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 are explicitly time - dependent .",
    "our study of solving the forward kolmogorov equation ( fke ) by the hermite spectral method ( hsm ) is closely related to the implementation of the algorithm developed in @xcite .",
    "the detailed formulation of our algorithm could be found in appendix a or @xcite .",
    "briefly speaking , in our algorithm , we start from the signal based model : @xmath4 where @xmath5 is a vector of the states of the system at time @xmath6 with @xmath7 satisfying some initial distribution and @xmath8 is a vector of the observations at time @xmath6 with @xmath9 .",
    "@xmath10 and @xmath11 are vector brownian motion processes with @xmath12=q(t)dt$ ] and @xmath13=s(t)dt$ ] , @xmath14 , respectively .",
    "the dmz equation is derived as @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the unnormalized conditional density funciton , @xmath17 is the density of the initial states @xmath7 , and @xmath18-\\sum_{i=1}^n\\frac{\\partial(f_i\\ast)}{\\partial      x_i}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] to maintain the real - time property , solving the dmz equation is translated into solving a fke off - line and updating the initial data on - line at the beginning of each time interval .",
    "let @xmath19 be a partition of @xmath20 $ ] .",
    "the fke needs to be solved at each time step is @xmath21,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath22 is defined as .",

    "thus , it is crucial to obtain a good approximate solution to . in this paper",
    ", we adopt hsm to solve fke for two reasons : on the one hand , hsm is particularly suitable for functions defined on the unbounded domain which decays exponentially at infinity ; on the other hand , hsm could be easily patched with the numerical solution obtained in the previous time step while the moving - window technique is in use in the on - line experiments .",
    "the hsm itself is also a field of research , which could be traced back to 1970s . in @xcite , gottlieb",
    "al . gave the example @xmath27 to illustrate the poor resolution of hermite polynomials .",
    "to resolve @xmath28 wavelength of @xmath27 , it requires nearly @xmath29 hermite polynomials . due to this fact",
    ", they doubted the usefulness of hermite polynomials as bases .",
    "the hermite functions inherit the same deficiency from the polynomials .",
    "moreover , it is lack of fast hermite transform ( some analogue of fast fourier transform ) . despite of all these drawbacks",
    ", the hsm has its inherent strength .",
    "many physical models need to solve a differential equation on an unbounded domain , and the solution decays exponentially at infinity . from the computational point of view , it is hard to describe the rate of decay at infinity numerically or to impose some artificial boundary condition cleverly on some faraway  boundary \" . therefore the chebyshev or fourier spectral methods are not so useful in this situation . as to the hsm , how to deal with the behavior at infinity is not necessary .",
    "recent applications of the hsm can be found in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , etc .    to overcome the poor resolution",
    ", a scaling factor is necessary to be introduced into the hermite functions , refer to @xcite , @xcite .",
    "it is shown in @xcite that the scaling factor should be chosen according to the truncated modes @xmath30 and the asymptotical behavior of the function @xmath31 , as @xmath32 .",
    "some efforts have been made in seeking the suitable scaling factor @xmath33 , see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , etc . to optimize the scaling factor is still an open problem , even in the case that @xmath31 is given explicitly , to say nothing of the exact solution to a differential equation , which is generally unknown a - priori .",
    "although some investigations about the scaling factor have been made theoretically , as far as we know , there is no practical guidelines of choosing a suitable scaling factor .",
    "nearly all the scaling factors in the papers with the application of hsm are obtained by the trial - and - error method .",
    "thus , we believe it is necessary and useful to give a practical strategy to pick an appropriate scaling factor and the corresponding truncated mode for at least the most commonly used types of functions , i.e. the gaussian type and the super - gaussian type functions .",
    "the strategy we are about to give only depends on the asymptotic behavior of the function . in the scenario where the solution of some differential equation needs to be approximated ( the exact solution is unknown ) , we could use asymptotical analysis to obtain its asymptotic behavior .",
    "thus , our strategy of picking the suitable scaling factor is still applicable . a numerical experiment",
    "is also included to verify the feasibility of our strategy .",
    "although it may not be optimal with respect to the accuracy , our strategy provides a useful guideline for the implementations of hsm . in this paper , the precise convergence rate of the hsm to fke",
    "is obtained in suitable funciton space by numerical analysis and verified by a numerical example .",
    "let us draw our attention back to the implementation of our algorithm to nlf problems . through our study of hsm to fke , the off - line data could be well prepared . however , when synchronizing the off - line data with the on - line experiments , to be more specifically , updating the initial data according to on - line , another difficulty arises due to the drifting of the conditional density function .",
    "the untranslated hermite functions with limited truncation modes could only resolve the function well , if it is concentrated in the neighborhood of the origin .",
    "let us call this neighborhood as a  window \" .",
    "unfortunately , the density function will probably drift out of the current  window \" . the numerical evidence is displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig - waterfall ] . to efficiently solve this problem , we for the first time introduce the translating factor to the hermite functions and the moving - window technique for the on - line implementation .",
    "the translating factor helps the moving - window technique to be implemented more neatly and easily . essentially speaking",
    ", we shift the windows back and forth according to the  support \" of the density function , by tuning the translating factor .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section ii introduces the generalized hermite functions and the guidelines of choosing suitable scaling factor to improve the resolution ; section iii focuses on the analysis of the convergence rate of hsm to fke and a numerical verification is displayed .",
    "section iv is devoted to the application to the nlf problems .",
    "the translating factor and the moving - window technique are addressed in detail .",
    "numerical simulations of two nlf problems solved by our algorithm are illustrated , compared with the particle filter .",
