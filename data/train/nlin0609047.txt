    "synchronized chaotic oscillations have been found in many nonlinear systems , from lasers @xcite to neural networks @xcite .",
    "many types of synchronization have been observed , including complete synchronization , phase - locking , and generalized synchronization , in the case of uni - directionally coupled systems . for an overview of the large body of work done on synchronization , and",
    "its sub - classes see for example @xcite .",
    "while extensive work has been done on mutually coupled systems , general analytic techniques for analyzing chaotic synchronization in time - delay mutually coupled systems have not been well developed . essentially , there exist two methods for analyzing synchronization in coupled systems : a lyapunov function approach @xcite and a master stability approach @xcite .",
    "time delays considerably complicate the analysis , possibly introducing infinite degrees of freedom , and resulting in new types of dynamics @xcite .",
    "the present paper proposes an approach for understanding and predicting chaotic synchronization of time - delayed mutually coupled systems , possessing internal symmetry .    in the case of internal symmetry in a system , where the equations of motion are invariant with respect to interchange of some variables",
    ", there is a solution where these variables are exactly equal @xcite .",
    "for example , for the case of three nonlinear oscillators coupled in a line , if the equations of the outside oscillators are identical , then given the same initial conditions , these oscillators will have identical dynamics , including the possibility of chaotic solutions . in that case , the system can be reduced to two coupled oscillators . if the symmetric solution is asymptotically stable to perturbations off the synchronization manifold , then the dynamics of outside oscillators are synchronized .",
    "thus the requirement for synchronization in the long time limit is that the largest lyapunov exponent , with respect to perturbations transverse to the synchronization manifold , is negative , resulting in decay of the initial perturbation back to synchronized state @xcite . in general ,",
    "lyapunov exponents have to be calculated numerically .",
    "however , as will be shown , an analytic estimate can be made in some cases by linearizing about the synchronous state .",
    "although there is extensive work on synchronization of coupled systems , studies of chaotic synchronization in time - delayed systems is much less extensive by comparison .",
    "some analysis exists on synchronization of coupled semiconductor lasers without delays @xcite .",
    "however , it remains to be explained , for example , why in a coupled three laser system , outer lasers show complete synchronization , in the presence of long time delays ( compared to the internal dynamics of each laser ) and no communication except via the middle laser , which itself is not synchronized with the end lasers @xcite .",
    "( see figure [ fig : lasers_synch ] below for an example ) .",
    "the present paper aims to explain this phenomena observed in lasers and other time - delayed systems using ideas from generalized synchronization .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section ii , the general equations for the three subsystems coupled by nearest neighbor interactions with delays are introduced , and the equations are linearized close to the synchronization manifold , using internal symmetry .",
    "section iii uses synchronization ideas developed in section ii to explain complete synchronization of semiconductor lasers in the presence of long delays and with no direct communication between the outer lasers .",
    "section iv concludes and summarizes .",
    "we deal with mutually coupled , oscillatory time - delay systems possessing internal symmetry , with respect to interchange of some variables .",

    "the delay in the coupling terms is fixed and given by @xmath9 , and the strength of coupling from the center to the outer identical subsystems by @xmath10 , while from the outer to the center by @xmath11 . due to internal symmetry of the system",

    "if the conditional lyapunov exponents calculated with respect to perturbation out of the synchronization manifold , @xmath13 are all negative , then the two outer subsystems are synchronized .",
    "this type of behavior where the two systems show identical dynamics , even chaotic ones , is called complete synchronization .",
    "figure [ fig : lasers_synch ] shows an example of complete synchronization in the case of a mutually coupled three laser system using the model in section iii @xcite . calculating lyapunov exponents is in general complicated due to the presence of time - delays in the equations .",

    "while the exact form of the function between the driver and the driven systems can be rather complicated and difficult to obtain , its existence can be inferred from the synchronization of identical systems when started from different initial conditions and being exposed to the same drive .",
    "this method of detecting generalized synchronization using identical driven systems is known as the auxiliary systems approach @xcite . in order for the driven subsystems , @xmath26 to become synchronized",
    ", their dependence on initial conditions has to `` wash out '' as a function of time .",
    "this is due to the fact that dependence on initial conditions prevents synchronization by making the dynamics of @xmath4 different from the dynamics of @xmath5 .",
    "this `` washing out '' of initial conditions is provided by the dissipation in the system , which must therefore be either present in the coupling term , or in the uncoupled dynamics of the system itself .",

    "( [ eq : lyapsum ] ) , negative lyapunov exponents sum corresponds to a contraction of phase - space of @xmath32 dynamics as a function of time . in the case of synchronization in driven identical systems , all",
    "lyapunov exponents transverse to the synchronous solution must be negative .",
    "thus there is a contraction of phase - space to a single trajectory that is a function of the dynamics of the driver , @xmath28 .",
    "this shrinking of phase - space is either caused by dissipative coupling or dissipation in the driven systems themselves .",
    "the effect of dissipation on synchronization can be illustrated using the case of a simple driven system , @xmath33 taking the difference between the two variables , @xmath34 , we get , @xmath35 , where @xmath36 in eq . (",
    "[ eq : xy ] ) is the chaotic signal provided by the driver ( it can also be a noisy signal ) @xcite .",
    "thus the difference in initial conditions between @xmath37 and @xmath38 decreases at the rate of dissipation , @xmath39 , leading to synchronization for large times .    in mutually coupled systems , @xmath40 ,",
    "the dynamics of @xmath6 are affected by @xmath4 and @xmath5 . in this case , the synchronized state , @xmath41 , may depend on the initial conditions of all of the three subsystems , @xmath42 , so that @xmath41 can not be the result of generalized synchronization , in a strict sense .",
    "however , it takes a time interval of @xmath43 for any change in the dynamics of systems @xmath26 to affect the motion of these systems via mutual coupling . during this time interval of length , @xmath43",
    ", @xmath26 can be viewed as driven by @xmath6 , since the signal @xmath26 receives during that time - interval is not affected by its dynamics on that interval .",
    "therefore , we examine the dynamics in a time period on the order of the delay time , @xmath9 .",
    "the initial dynamics of @xmath44 on the time interval @xmath45 , affect the dynamics of @xmath44 on the time interval @xmath46 via the mutual coupling term , @xmath47 ( see eqs .",
    "( 1 ) and ( 3 ) ) . for chaotic systems ,",
    "the trajectories are not correlated in time , and we assume @xmath48 for @xmath49 and @xmath50 significantly longer than the average period of oscillation .",
    "the above equation is true , in general , for non - periodic oscillations .",
    "this can be seen by expanding the signal in a fourier series : @xmath51 .",
    "then , if there is a significant periodic component in @xmath52 of amplitude @xmath53 , eq .",
    "( [ eq : corr ] ) will be proportional to @xmath54 whenever @xmath50 is a multiple of @xmath55 .",
    "thus , for example , eq .",
    "( [ eq : corr ] ) may not hold if the amplitude of an optoelectronicly coupled laser ( to be discussed in the following section ) is too close to the threshold , where the behavior can be approximated as coupled linear oscillators ( see eqs .

    "this assumption of a driver is only strictly valid on the time interval within the round - trip time , since for longer time intervals the initial conditions of the outer lasers at the beginning of the interval will affect their dynamics , via the middle system , at a later time within the interval .    by perturbing the dynamics of the outer subsystems from the synchronized state",
    ", it can be shown that complete synchronization of the end subsystems in the presence of long delays is similar to generalized synchronization , where the middle subsystem acts as the driver for the outer ones . after the symmetric subsystems synchronize , @xmath57 , one of them can be suddenly perturbed from its symmetric state to an arbitrary position in phase - space at some @xmath58 . in that case , the perturbed system , as well as the unpertubed one , will receive the exact same signal from @xmath6 as before , for @xmath59 .",
    "if the systems synchronize again at some point during @xmath59 , we will again have @xmath57 , where @xmath20 has not been affected by the perturbation during that time interval .",
    "thus the synchronized state , @xmath60 is clearly independent of perturbations of subsystems @xmath26 and must therefore be some function of the middle subsystem , @xmath6 .",
    "this however is the same as what happens in generalized synchronization , with the difference that the trajectory of @xmath6 itself may be affected by the initial starting conditions of the symmetric subsystems .",
    "the following section uses a system of semiconductor lasers as an example for application of these ideas to understand complete synchronization of the end lasers in a three laser system .",
    "the discussion of the previous section can be applied to the study of synchronization of a three laser system with delays . a schematic diagram is shown in fig . ( [ fig:3lasers ] ) , where the outer lasers are identical , while the middle laser is detuned .",

    "( see @xcite for details of the derivation form the original physical model . )",
    "the above equations are coupled via laser intensities , @xmath70 , using optoelectronic incoherent coupling that does not contain phase information , unlike the coherent coupling in fischer et al @xcite .",
    "previously , the dynamics of two electronically coupled lasers have been explored @xcite , showing lag synchronization for the case of two lasers , and isochronal synchronization if feedback is added @xcite .",
    "the above equations are scaled so that the relaxation frequency is equal to one . in the typical experimental set - up ,",
    "the relaxation oscillations are on the order of @xmath74 ns .",
    "since the delay time is scaled by the relaxation frequency , and is at least an order of magnitude higher ( for long delays ) , a typical delay time used in simulations could be about @xmath75 , which corresponds to about @xmath76 ns .    in the absence of dissipation , the uncoupled system , @xmath77 , is a nonlinear conservative system , with behavior similar to a simple harmonic oscillator for small amplitudes , and becoming more pulse - like at high amplitudes @xcite .",
    "dissipation , however , leads to energy loss , so that in the absence of coupling between lasers , the dynamics would settle into a steady state .",

    "this synchronous state is obtained by starting the outer oscillators from the same initial conditions and perturbing the system at some time , @xmath58 .",
    "the perturbation will not affect the coefficient matrix in eq .",
    "( [ eq : matrix ] ) until @xmath88 . so that in the time interval of @xmath43 the dynamics off the synchronization manifold can be viewed as driven by an uncorrelated chaotic signal @xmath89 .",

    "equation ( [ eq : w ] ) is valid over the integration interval of twice the delay : @xmath92 .",
    "this is due to the fact that it takes a time interval of @xmath43 for a perturbation in the outer laser to affect its dynamics via mutual coupling from the middle laser .",
    "thus , during the time interval of @xmath43 , the perturbed system acts like a driven system in that its dynamics do not affect the signal it receives , and therefore do not change the synchronized state , @xmath93 , making it independent of @xmath94 dynamics over the integration interval .    since the variable @xmath95 is the scaled intensity of the laser , from eqs .",
    "( [ eq : lasers1])-([eq : lasers ] ) , its minimum possible value is @xmath96 .",

    "it follows , that @xmath104 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : w ] ) averages out to zero if the integral is done over many periods of oscillation , while the dissipation term , multiplied by @xmath39 , provides a continuous negative component .",
    "if that continuous negative component builds up sufficiently over the integration interval to overcome any fluctuations in @xmath104 , we then have a continuous shrinking of the phase - space of perturbed dynamics , indicating synchronization .",

    "this integral , however , may still be significant compared to the @xmath39 term , since its fluctuations are comparable to @xmath104 , because the integration period , @xmath100 , is of order unity ( due to scaling in the equations ) , while @xmath39 multiplying the other term is small .",
    "it follows that sufficiently long integration times , @xmath106 , are required in order for the dissipation term to dominate .",
    "we can now set an upper bound for the integral on the right - hand side of equation ( [ eq : insert2 ] ) , @xmath110 where @xmath111 is the maximum fluctuation of inversion over the interval of twice the delay time .",
    "the above bound may not be valid at energies far above the threshold , when the laser behavior becomes pulse - like with a period that is significantly longer than the scaled relaxation period of @xmath112 .",
    "this may be another reason why there is a loss of synchronization at higher coupling strengths , which lead to higher amplitudes of oscillation , with lower frequencies .",

    "complete chaotic synchronization is the result of the outer systems becoming a function of the middle one , as would happen in the case of generalized synchronization . due to the symmetry of the outer subsystems ,",
    "the dynamics linearized about the synchronization manifold are independent of explicit coupling .",
    "transverse lyapunov exponents can then be calculated to determine the stability of the synchronous state . since over the time scale of twice the delay interval",
    ", the outer subsystems can be viewed as driven by a common chaotic signal from the middle subsystem , the analysis is considerably simplified , allowing for calculation of phase - space volume dynamics transverse to the synchronization manifold .",
    "the transverse phase - space volume dynamics were analyzed for the case of three mutually coupled semiconductor lasers .",
    "it was found that for sufficiently long delays , the synchronized state is stable .",
    "the sum of lyapunov exponents transverse to the synchronization manifold was found analytically and shown to have a negative linear dependence on dissipation , in good agreement with numerical calculations .",
    "this also confirmed the intuition that synchronization is the result of dissipation , @xmath39 in local dynamics of the lasers themselves , since the coupling between lasers is not dissipative .",
    "the analysis also explains the effect of various parameters on synchronization , such as coupling strengths , delay time , and dissipation , and is supported by numerical simulations over a range of parameter values .",
    "thus , it was shown analytically and confirmed numerically that after the onset of synchronization , the stability of the synchronous state ( as given by lyapunov exponents ) depends linearly on dissipation , but is independent of the delay time and coupling strength .",
