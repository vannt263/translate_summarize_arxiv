    "in 1971 , an electroweak that unifies the @xmath3 symmetry of the standard model(sm ) into @xmath0 was suggested @xcite . here",
    "each family of the sm leptons is grouped to form a @xmath0 fundamental representation which is akin to the forgotten konopinski - mahmoud @xcite assignments .",
    "the model predicts the weak mixing angle to be @xmath4 at the tree level .",
    "this is tantalizingly close to the measured value of @xmath5 .",
    "although the prediction is appealing , it was soon abandoned because the insurmountable theoretical difficulty to embed the quarks into any @xmath0 multiplet .",
    "another relevant attempt suggested by @xcite is the so called 3 - 3 - 1 model . in this model ,",
    "the gauge group is extended to @xmath6 such that the quarks can be embedded into it .",
    "this unification came with a hefty price .",
    "firstly , three extra exotic quarks were introduced to complete the @xmath0 multiplets .",
    "secondly , the scalar potential which consists of three triplets and one sextet had to be fine tuned to get the symmetry breaking pattern right . finally , the third family quarks had to be put in a representation which is different from the first two generations .",
    "recently , the development of orbifold grand unified theory(gut ) models in the extra dimension brane world scenario has opened up a new direction for model building .",
    "the old @xmath0 idea was revived by several groups @xcite by promoting it to a five dimensional ( 5d ) model .",
    "the @xmath0 is a gauge symmetry in the full 5d bulk space .",
    "it is broken to the sm electroweak @xmath7 by suitable choice of orbifold parities .",
    "then the @xmath7 symmetry is further reduced to @xmath8 via the usual higgs mechanism . in such a construction ,",
    "the tree - level prediction of @xmath9 is preserved and the quarks can be placed at the orbifold fixed point where only the sm symmetry manifests ; thus avoiding the long standing quark embedding problem .",
    "clearly a dichotomy between quarks and leptons still exists but it is no longer inconsistent",
    ". a closer look at the yukawa sector requires at least one bulk scalar in @xmath10 representation and one more bulk scalar in the symmetrical @xmath11 representation to give viable charged lepton mass pattern . as a result",
    ", the electroweak symmetry breaking pattern is controlled by the vacuum expected values(vevs ) of these two bulk scalars .",
    "meanwhile there are new developments in the area of experimental neutrino physics .",
    "there is now strong evidence for neutrino oscillations and nonzero neutrino masses provided recently by many experiments @xcite which clearly demands new physics beyond the sm for their explanation .",
    "the most popular suggestion for giving the active neutrino masses is the seesaw mechanism in guts in which one right - handed sm singlet fermion with a mass around gut scale per sm family is introduced .",
    "each right - handed singlet either belong to the fundamental representation , like in @xmath12 gut , or be put in by hand as in @xmath13 gut .",
    "usually , extra family symmetry is required to obtain neutrino masses and mixing angles that are in accord with the known experimental measurements . in extra dimensional models with right - handed bulk singlet(s ) , the small four dimensional ( 4d ) effective dirac masses can be a natural outcome of large extra dimension volume dilution effect . compared to bulk neutrino model , in a 4d model",
    ", the neutrino masses can still emerge by incorporating the right - handed singlet(s ) but extreme fine tuning is required . both of above mentioned methods require a right - handed singlet going into action .",
    "an alternative way to give light neutrino masses is through 1-loop quantum corrections .",
    "the prototype model was constructed some time ago@xcite in which the presence of a @xmath14 singlet as the lepton number violating source is crucial .",
    "the early version of this kind of model gives at most the bi - maximal mixing angle which is ruled out by the latest sno data . at the expense of introducing more exotic higgs fields this kind of models",
    "can be made to agree with observation again .",
    "however , all these constructions suffer from being ad hoc .    simultaneously confronting @xmath15 problem and recent neutrino data , we investigated a radiative mechanism for neutrino mass based on 5d orbifold @xmath0 gut @xcite .",
    "we found that it is possible to accommodate large mixing angle msw solution to the neutrino data with a minimum scalar sector , in the sense that the charged lepton mass hierarchy can be accounted for , without much fine tuning of parameters .",
    "this idea is further pursued by us and has been extended to 5d non - supersymmetric @xmath13 model @xcite .",
    "but due to the high compactification scale , @xmath16 gev , the @xmath13 version is phenomenologically less interesting .",
    "the non - supersymmetric @xmath0 model on the other hand implies a large extra dimension with the compactification scale , @xmath17 , in the range of @xmath18 tev .",
    "thus , the stability problem of the higgs sector is not as severe as many other theories .",
    "this point also justifies why the supersymmetry need not be introduced in this model . the theoretical consistency , see the discussion in section iii , sets a upper bound on @xmath17 to be around @xmath19 tev with the actual value depending weakly on a few free parameters .",
    "obviously , the low value of @xmath17 makes it interesting for colliders and low energy physics tests of the validity of the model are meaningful .",
    "interestingly , all the new physics effects appear mainly in the lepton sectors which makes it distinguishable from other gut models . for a brief review of these models",
    "see @xcite .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to carefully consider the phenomenological consequences of the 5d @xmath0 gut .",
    "nontrivial result already can be drawn from analyzing renormalization group equations ( rges ) and unification altered by the extended scalar sector .",
    "the characteristic phenomenology of @xmath0 gut arises from the presence of vector or scalar bileptons .",
    "there exists many phenomenology surveys on the general bilepton case @xcite .",
    "also there are studies that focused either on the 3 - 3 - 1 model @xcite or other guts @xcite .",
    "the presence of kaluza - klein ( kk ) excitations of bileptons or sm gauge bosons in this 5d @xmath0 model makes our study very different from the existing analysis .",
    "the kk excitations will affect the effective gauge and yukawa couplings .",
    "signatures in high energy collider experiments can come from direct production of new particles if they are light enough .",
    "they can also come from modification of the expected sm signature .",
    "depending on the mixings which can occur among the vector bileptons and also the leptons , we found the deviation of angular distributions from sm expectations can be as high as few tens percent in the bhabha and mller scatterings which could be probed by the future linear colliders . also , in low energy neutrino scattering the kk excitations play a role .",
    "current low energy leptonic experiment such as rare muon processes already impose many constraints on this model , especially on the yukawa sector as we will show .",
    "here is our plan for the paper . in the next section ,",
    "we give necessary details of the 5d orbifold @xmath0 model .",
    "the coupling of the bilepton gauge bosons to leptons will be spelled out explicitly .",
    "the rges for the gauge couplings are examined in section iii .",
    "this is done in greater detail than available in the literature .",
    "then the tree - level decay widths of kk excitations are given in section iv .",
    "the low energy constraint will be discussed in section v , where muon decay , muonium - antimuonium transition , and lepton flavor violating processes are discussed .",
    "section vi is devoted to the study of collider signatures , focusing on the bhabha and mller scatterings . also , we comment on the possible bilepton direct production in various colliders .",
    "the low energy neutrino electron scattering receives correction from the kk excitations of sm gauge bosons and the vector bileptons .",
    "this will be discussed in section vii .",
    "we give the conclusion at section viii .",
    "some handy formulas are collected in the appendix .",
    "the @xmath0 unification model is defined on the orbifold @xmath20 with the 4d minkowski space @xmath21 coordinates denoted by @xmath22 and the extra spatial dimension by @xmath23 .",
    "the latter is compactified into a circle @xmath24 of radius @xmath25 , or @xmath26 $ ] , and is orbifolded by a @xmath27 which identifies points @xmath23 and @xmath28 .",
    "the resulting space is further divided by a second @xmath29 acting on @xmath30 to give the final geometry .",
    "therefore , two parity eigenvalues , plus or minus one , can be assigned to the bulk fields under the transformations @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "the sm lepton left - handed doublet and the right - handed singlet in each family can be embedded into the @xmath0 fundamental representation as l= (    c e +   + e^c    ) _ l . in our convention , @xmath33 and @xmath34 in terms of the standard gell - man matrices and @xmath35 .",

    "<S> we study the phenomenology of a 5d @xmath0 model on a @xmath1 orbifold in which the minimal scalar sector plays an essential role of radiatively generating neutrino majorana masses without the benefits of right - handed singlets . </S>",
    "<S> we carefully examine how do the exotic scalars affect the renormalization group ( rg ) equations for the gauge couplings and the 5d @xmath0 unification . </S>",
    "<S> we found that the compactification scale of extra dimension is in the range of @xmath2 tev . </S>",
    "<S> the possibility of the existence of relatively low mass kaluza - klein excitations makes the phenomenology of near term interest . </S>",
    "<S> some possible bilepton signatures can be searched for in future colliders and in neutrino scattering experiments with intense neutrino beams . </S>",
    "<S> the low energy constraints from muon physics and lepton number violating decay process induced by bilepton are also discussed . </S>",
    "<S> these constraints can provide new information on the structure of yukawa couplings which might be useful for future model building . </S>"
