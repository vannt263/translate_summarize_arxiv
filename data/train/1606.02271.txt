    "one of the main open problems in theoretical physics is a proper understanding of the infrared behavior of non - abelian gauge theories , like quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) , and of its phase diagram ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the non - perturbative nature of the infrared region of qcd prevents one from using the standard perturbative techniques based on feynman diagrams .",
    "thus , it is necessary to rest on non - perturbative techniques and/or lattice data . in the present paper",
    ", we will combine lattice data ( both for the quarks and gluons propagators ) together with the non - perturbative effects arising from ( the elimination of ) gribov copies @xcite  ( for the gluonic sector ) to extract non - perturbative equations of state for quarks as well as gluons .",
    "we will adopt the @xmath0-function regularization technique @xcite , which allows one to write many of the physical quantities in a closed form as ( very rapidly convergent ) series of bessel functions .",
    "this technical point will play an important role in the following .",
    "the details of non - perturbative propagators of quarks and gluons are of great interest in applications .",
    "for instance , in astrophysics , there is evidence supporting the existence of quark stars ( two detailed reviews are @xcite ) . as such objects are gravitating",
    ", it is of fundamental importance to check under which conditions they can be in hydrostatic equilibrium and which is the expected upper bound on their mass . due to the great difficulty to construct analytically an equation of state ( eos ) for such extreme matter configurations , it is important to have some estimates on the mass bounds of self - gravitating objects which can be deduced by generic principles rather than from the exact form of the eos . for a neutron star",
    "this has been done by rhoades and ruffini @xcite using only very basic principles .",
    "two of the required basic principles are the absence of superluminal propagation and le chatelier s principle .",
    "the absence of superluminal propagation is necessary to enforce causality and is considered one of the most basic principles of relativistic physics .",
    "le chatelier s principle simply states that when any system at equilibrium is subjected to change , it will react in such a way to oppose to the change .",
    "this means that assuming le chatelier s principle is completely generic as , without it , it would not even be possible have a stable equilibrium .",
    "the third principle required by rhoades and ruffini is the validity of the hydrostatic equilibrium equation of general relativity . just from the above requirements",
    ", they were able to derive a bound of @xmath1 @xmath2 for a neutron star without knowing any further details of the eos ( besides its existence of course , as it will be explained in a moment ) .",
    "as it is possible to extract detailed information as regards on the non - perturbative propagators from lattice data ( as well as from the gribov - zwanziger procedure ) a natural question arises : _ will the equations of state derived from the non - perturbative quarks and gluons propagators be compatible with the basic principles stated above _ ?    in the present analysis , in order to be as generic as possible , we will drop the assumption of the hydrostatic equilibrium equation as it is specific to general relativity ( it may be that this theory acquires some corrections in some extreme range of parameters ) .",
    "the other two principles , namely causality and le chatelier s principle are , instead , quite generic and , consequently , we will consider them .    actually , before discussing these two principles , there is a more basic requirement which was implicitly assumed in @xcite ( as well as in a great part of the theoretical literature on gravitating compact objects ) : namely the _ existence _ of a well - defined eos or , in other words , the possibility to define an implicit one - to - one functional relation between pressure and energy density .",
    "the importance of such a requirement becomes obvious if one considers that , if it is not satisfied , it is not even possible to discuss the coupling with the einstein equations ( in the usual way , at least ) . that is the reason why in @xcite such a principle was not analyzed in detail ,",
    "rather it was just considered as obvious .",
    "however , the present analysis shows that the very existence of an eos depends on the precise values of the parameters appearing in the fit of the lattice propagators .",
    "remarkably , there are cases in which it is not possible at all to extract a well - defined eos from the non - perturbative propagators .",
    "this , for instance , prevents one from coupling strongly interacting quarks and gluons to einstein gravity in any obvious way .",
    "in particular , in these situations the bound derived in @xcite would not apply .",
    "usually , the fact that it is not possible to define a one - to - one relation between pressure and energy density suggests that some extra physical parameter is needed to properly label the equilibrium states in order to define an eos in the usual sense .",
    "the fact that there may not exist a well - defined eos in certain situations can be seen as follows . from the non - perturbative propagator it is possible to compute the grand partition function from which all relevant thermodynamical quantities like the pressure and energy density as functions of the temperature and of the chemical potential can be derived .",
    "taking , for example , a fixed value of the chemical potential it is possible to get a parametric equation for the energy density @xmath3 versus pressure @xmath4 curve .",
    "this curve , however , represents a single - valued function @xmath5 only when the functions @xmath4 and @xmath3 are strictly monotonous as function of the temperature @xmath6 or the shapes and ranges of non monotonicity in @xmath6 for @xmath7 and @xmath8 are exactly the same .",
    "the computation of the grand partition function from the non - perturbative lattice quarks propagator at finite temperature and chemical potential has been performed in the reference @xcite using dimensional regularization techniques . in this paper ,",
    "the @xmath0-function regularization technique is used instead and the non - perturbative gluons propagator is discussed as well .",
    "the advantage of the @xmath0-function regularization @xcite is that it reduces the number of numerical integrations ( many of the expressions are evaluated as fast converging series of bessel functions ) and , consequently , it reduces the numerical error allowing to see even very tiny effects . indeed , although our computations show that the two techniques clearly agree , using the @xmath0-function approach it is possible to see that for the values of the parameters appearing in the fit of the last lattice quarks propagator , the curve @xmath4 and @xmath3 of the pressure and energy density as a function of the temperature are non - strictly monotonic functions and have different shapes near @xmath9 .",
    "this means that for a small range of temperatures , the functional relation of pressure and energy density is not one - to - one : namely , one of the requirements of rhoades and ruffini is violated .",
    "the problem in the eos being well defined disappears by allowing a change in the fit parameters of around @xmath10 .",
    "interestingly , once the existence of an eos has been ensured , the causality and le chatelier principles turn out to be almost satisfied without any extra requirements on the parameters . for this reason",
    ", it may be interesting to explore the phenomenological consequences of allowing such changes in the fit parameters .",
    "a similar analysis reveals that the same requirement of rhoades and ruffini can be violated in the case of the non - perturbative gluons eos .",
    "the theoretical interest of the gluon case is that if one considers a gribov - zwanziger ( gz ) propagator with the inclusion of the effects of the condensates then , by allowing a change in the fit parameters of around @xmath10 , one can satisfy all the requirements of rhoades and ruffini . on the other hand ,",
    "if one does not include the condensates , then a change in the gribov mass of around @xmath10 is definitely not enough to satisfy all the requirements of rhoades and ruffini .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in the next section the relevant thermodynamic quantities for the non - perturbative quark propagator are constructed .",
    "the most relevant details of the computations related to @xmath11-function regularization technique are kept in the main text as they are fundamental in detecting the non - existence regime of the eos . in the third section , the analysis is extended to the gluonic sector .",
    "the last section is dedicated to the conclusions and perspectives .",
    "let us start the analysis with the non - perturbative quark propagator @xmath12 arising from the lattice @xcite @xmath13 where @xmath14 are the euclidean dirac matrices and @xmath15 is the @xmath16 identity matrix .",
    "such a propagator can be included in the framework of the so - called refined gribov - zwanziger ( rgz ) approach as indicated in @xcite .",
    "it is worth emphasizing here that the above propagator can be expanded into three ` standard ' fermions propagators , two of which having complex conjugated poles and the third with real poles .",
    "the physical interpretation of having complex conjugated poles is that they are a signal of confinement as propagators with complex poles in @xmath17 violate positivity .",
    "such poles are determined by the following equation : @xmath18   ^{2}=\\\\ \\left (   p^{2}+\\alpha_{1}\\right )   \\left (   p^{2}+\\alpha_{2}\\right )   \\left ( p^{2}+\\alpha_{3}\\right )   , \\label{poles1}\\ ] ] meaning that the set @xmath19 represents minus the roots of the denominator in @xmath12 .",
    "as said above , the idea to compute the grand partition function using the non - perturbative quarks propagator arising from lattice data has already been proposed in the reference @xcite .",
    "the new idea proposed in the present paper is to analyze in which range of the parameters appearing in the propagators , pressure and energy density satisfy some very basic consistency conditions of thermodynamical equilibrium configurations .",
    "such conditions appear in a very natural way in the analysis of any self - gravitating compact object ( like quark stars ) in an analogous way to the pioneering work @xcite .",
    "the first consistency condition is actually so obvious that it was not even explicitly enumerated ( but of course assumed ) in @xcite so that we will call it _",
    "condition zero_.    _ condition zero : existence of an equation of state _ in the standard general relativistic approach to self - gravitating objects , before even beginning to require some consistency conditions on thermodynamical quantities , it is necessary to have an eos ( namely , a functional relation @xmath5 of the pressure in terms of the energy density ) . if this condition is not satisfied , there would not exist any obvious way to couple non - perturbative quarks and gluons to general relativity ( nor to any reasonable generalization of general relativity ) .",
    "as there are some arguments supporting the existence of quark stars @xcite , the issue about the possibility to define an eos even in such extreme conditions is very relevant .",
    "_ condition one : causality _ as is well known , in order to enforce causality a necessary condition is to impose the requirement that no signal can travel faster than the speed of light .",
    "this means that the speed of sound inside a self - gravitating object can not be superluminal . in terms of the eos",
    "this condition takes the simple form @xmath20 .",
    "it is therefore obvious that , without condition zero , it is not even possible to enforce causality .",
    "_ condition two : le chatelier s principle _ this principle states that for any action intended to modify a given equilibrium configuration of a system , the system will react in such a way that it opposes to the change .",
    "this principle is actually equivalent to the assumption that there exists a stable equilibrium configuration . for a self - gravitating object",
    "this principle implies that there is no spontaneous gravitational collapse . in terms of the eos",
    ", this principle can be stated as @xmath21 .",
    "once again , it is worth noticing here that without condition zero being satisfied , it is not possible to enforce this principle .",
    "the condition that is prone to fail in the context of the non - perturbative quarks propagator ( as well as gluons propagator in the next section ) is _ condition zero_. indeed we will show that it exists a narrow range of temperature close to @xmath9 where the pressure is not a strictly monotonous function . very important , from this point of view ,",
    "is the fact that the @xmath0-function regularization provides results in closed analytic form as sums of ( very fast convergent ) series of suitable bessel functions ( unlike the reference @xcite in which the authors used dimensional regularization ) .",
    "the grand partition function corresponding to the non - perturbative quark propagator in equations ( [ quarkp1 ] ) and ( [ quarkp2 ] ) reads ( we will follow the notation of @xcite ) : @xmath22 where in our case @xmath23 is a suitable dimensional parameter , @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 are the matsubara frequencies for fermions , and @xmath27 it is worth to note that usually the grand partition function is written with @xmath28 instead of our @xmath29 .",
    "however , some subtraction must be done also in such a case in order to avoid the infinite part @xcite . in our case , splitting our regulator as @xmath30 in , where @xmath31 is a dimensionless constant , we obtain @xmath32 where we can use precisely the last term to absorb the infinity setting @xmath33 . at the end , this will give us the same result as @xcite .",
    "one can simplify the above expression as @xmath34 \\\\ &   = \\sum\\limits_{n=-\\infty}^{+\\infty}\\int\\frac{d^{3}p}{(2\\pi)^{3}}\\ln \\lambda^{-2}\\left [   \\frac{\\left (   \\bm{p}^{2}+(\\omega_{n}-i\\mu)^{2}\\right ) \\left (   \\bm{p}^{2}+(\\omega_{n}-i\\mu)^{2}+m^{2}\\right )   ^{2}+\\left ( m_{3}+m_{0}\\left (   \\bm{p}^{2}+(\\omega_{n}-i\\mu)^{2 } + m^{2 }",

    "so , everything reduces to find for a generic @xmath39 , the quantity @xmath40 .\\ ] ]    now , using the fact that @xmath41   = -\\lim_{s\\rightarrow0}\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial s}\\ln\\left (   \\lambda^{2}\\left [   \\bm{p}^{2}+\\alpha_{i}^{2}(\\omega_{n},\\mu)\\right ]   \\right )   ^{-s}$ ] we can write : @xmath42   \\right )   ^{-s}\\right\\ } \\nonumber\\\\ & \\nonumber\\\\ &   = -\\lim_{s\\rightarrow0}\\partial_{s}\\left\\ {   \\left (   { \\lambda}\\right ) ^{2s}\\sum\\limits_{n=-\\infty}^{+\\infty}\\frac{\\gamma(s-3/2)}{8\\pi^{\\frac{3}{2}}\\gamma(s)}\\left (   \\alpha_{i}^{2}(\\omega_{n},\\mu)\\right )   ^{\\frac{3}{2}-s}\\right\\}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] so that we get @xmath43 in order to proceed , it is necessary to have an explicit form for the @xmath39 , it can be shown that ( see appendix [ i_computation ] for details ) @xmath44 .",
    "being @xmath45 ( remember the @xmath46 are the opposite of the roots of the numerator ) the integral is convergent , thus @xmath47 with @xmath48 and @xmath49 and @xmath50 the _ jacobi @xmath51-function_. using the well - known representation for the jacobi @xmath51-function @xmath52 the integral can be reduced to @xmath53   \\right\\ } \\nonumber\\label{i_function}\\\\ &   = \\frac{(m_{i}^{2})^{2}}{32\\pi^{2}t}\\left ( \\log{\\left ( \\frac{m_{i}^{2}}{\\lambda^{2}}\\right ) } -\\frac{3}{2}\\right )   + \\sum\\limits_{n=1}^{+\\infty}\\frac{m_{i}^{2}(-1)^{n}t}{\\pi^{2}n^{2}}k_{2}\\left (   n\\frac{\\sqrt{m_{i}^{2}}}{t}\\right )   \\cosh\\left (   \\frac{\\mu n}{t}\\right ) , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we assume @xmath54 .      from the partition function , we can obtain the pressure , entropy density , number density and energy density , respectively : @xmath55 inverting the last equation , we can obtain the eos either for @xmath56 constant @xmath57 or @xmath6 constant @xmath58 .",
    "we stress here the fact that , if the pressure and energy density function in are not strictly monotonic functions in some interval @xmath59 either for @xmath6 or @xmath56 , and also the shape of non - monotonicity in @xmath60 does not coincide exactly for @xmath7 and @xmath8 , then it is not possible to define a proper eos as a function @xmath5 in the interval @xmath60 .",
    "as is shown in figure [ pres_ener_vs_temp_norm ] , using the mass fit parameters for the quark propagator , we see there is a range of @xmath61 , which we will call _ critical zone _ , where we can not find an eos .",
    "this is because when we have imaginary a component of the poles of the propagator , the modified bessel functions @xmath62 acquire , below @xmath63 , an oscillatory behavior , see appendix [ considerations ] . in our opinion",
    ", these results suggest that , at low temperature , some extra physical parameters ( which , for example , can be related to light glueballs ) suitable to properly label the equilibrium states are needed ( see appendix [ considerations ] for some considerations on this respect ) .",
    "for instance , there is not a unique value of the normalized pressure for a normalized energy density of @xmath64 .     of the quark sector ( red line ) and its energy density @xmath8 ( black dots ) as function of the temperature for @xmath65 .",
    "it is worth to note the detail of the plot due the critical zone is very narrow compared to the entire unit range and the values of negative @xmath7 is less than @xmath66 gev . ]    it is interesting to address the plot of pressure @xmath7 as a function of the energy density @xmath8 .",
    "as is shown in figure [ pres_vs_ener_crit ] , there is an eos when both @xmath8 and @xmath7 are positive .     of the quark sector as function of the energy density @xmath8 for @xmath65 .",
    "we can see if @xmath67 then the eos can not be defined . ]    on the other hand , if we change the fit parameters @xmath68 , such critical zone would disappear ( or it could even increase if we decrease the lattice parameters by @xmath69 ) , as we can compare in figure [ pres_vs_temp_norm_modif ] .    , @xmath70 , @xmath71 and @xmath72 given in [ quarkp2 ] , and a @xmath73 modification of these lattice mass parameters . ]      once we can write the eos , we may wonder if the conditions of causality ( @xmath74 ) and le chatelier s principle ( @xmath7 is monotonically growing with respect to @xmath8 ) , which appearing in @xcite , are both satisfied .",
    "as we can see in figure [ pres_vs_energy ] , le chatelier s principle holds for the mass values of the lattice data , when it is possible to define an eos @xmath5 ( see description above ) .     of the quark sector as a function of the energy @xmath8 for @xmath65 . ]    in figure [ veloc_vs_temp ] , one can see that causality holds as well .    .",
    "in this section we will check , as we did in the previous section for the quarks , whether or not the non - perturbative gluons propagator in the landau gauge arising from the lattice @xcite gives rise to an eos satisfying the three principle mentioned above .",
    "the extra benefit of this analysis is that , in the gluons case , the non - perturbative propagator arising from the lattice data can also be deduced theoretically .",
    "such a propagator is strongly related with one of the most fascinating non - perturbative effects in non - abelian gauge theories : the appearance of gribov copies @xcite . on flat ,",
    "topologically trivial , space - times ( which is the only case which will be analyzed here ) gribov copies represent a topological obstruction to define globally the gauge - fixing peculiar of the non - abelian nature of the gauge group ( for a good review see @xcite ) .    on the other hand ,",
    "both on curved spaces and on flat spaces but with non - trivial topology the pattern of appearance of gribov copies can be considerably more complicated .",
    "for instance , gribov copies can appear even in the abelian case ( see in particular @xcite ) .",
    "the results in these references suggest , as a future direction , to analyze how the equations of state of interacting gauge bosons ( _ even in the abelian case _ ) depend on the non - trivial backgrounds on which they are defined .",
    "we hope to come back on this interesting issue in a future publication .",
    "the most effective method to eliminate gribov copies ( proposed by gribov himself in @xcite and refined in @xcite ) amounts to restrict the domain of the path integral to the region in which the faddeev - popov operator is positive definite ( such region is called gribov region ) . in @xcite",
    "the authors showed that all the gauge orbits cross the gribov region .",
    "hence , the gz restriction does not lose any relevant physical configuration .",
    "a local and renormalizable effective action for yang - mills theory whose dynamics is restricted to the gribov horizon was constructed in @xcite by adding extra fields to the action .",
    "later , an improved action was proposed by considering suitable condensates @xcite , which leads to propagators and glueball masses in agreement with the lattice data @xcite . with the same action",
    ", one can also solve the old problem of the casimir energy in the mit - bag model @xcite .",
    "moreover , this approach is quite effective also at finite temperature @xcite and , at least at one - loop order , gives rise to a vacuum expectation value for the polyakov loop compatible with its role of order parameter for the confinement - deconfinement transition @xcite .      within the gz approach",
    ", the vacuum energy density at one loop can be written as ( we will follow the notation of @xcite ) : @xmath75 being @xmath23 a regularization parameter , @xmath76 and @xmath77 the spatial volume",

    "the detailed computations of are in appendix [ i_computation ] .    in principle , as we are working at finite temperature , one should first determine how the gribov mass parameter @xmath78 depends on the temperature itself ( see @xcite ) .",
    "however , this would lead to a coupled system of integral equations to be solved self - consistently and this would enormously complicate the numerical task . fortunately , as the available results clearly indicate , the gribov parameter @xmath78 changes very slowly in the range of temperatures analyzed in the present paper ( see figure 2 of @xcite where @xmath78 was computed as a function of @xmath6 , the only reasonable assumption being that the coupling constant @xmath85 does not change in a small range around @xmath9 ) so that we will work in the approximation in which @xmath78 does not depend on the temperature and is actually equal to its @xmath9 value ( see @xcite , where @xmath86 ) .",
    "in such a case , we can construct @xmath87 and the result is plotted in figure [ pressure_vs_temp_gz ] .     as a function of the temperature @xmath6 in gz approach .",
    "it can be seen a range of @xmath6 where @xmath7 is negative . ]",
    "interestingly , as was also suggested by the results on the polyakov loop @xcite , there is a range of temperatures where the pressure is negative and is not a strictly monotonic function .",
    "furthermore , if we modify the gribov parameter by @xmath88 the @xmath10 of its value , the plot remains almost the same , as we can see in figure [ pres_vs_temp_modif_gz ] .",
    "namely , within the gz approach , the zeroth consistency condition of @xcite is likely to be always violated .    in figure [ vel_vs_temp_gz ]",
    "we plotted the squared velocity as a function of temperature in the region where we can define an eos .",
    "we see le chatelier s principle and causality conditions are both satisfied .",
    "it is interesting to show if the zeroth consistency condition is fulfilled in dimensions @xmath89 and @xmath90 also with @xmath79 internal gauge group .",
    "the computation could be done using and considering for @xmath91 in dimensions @xmath89 and @xmath90 .",

    "both in @xmath89 and @xmath90 , there is a region where the eos can not be well defined in the gz approach .      in this subsection",
    ", we consider the non - perturbative gluon eos taking into account the appearance of the condensates in the propagator @xcite which is favored by lattice data @xcite ( following the same technique to compute the partition function ) .",
    "the rgz - propagator is @xcite @xmath95 @xmath96 , @xmath71 being condensate - related values , and @xmath78 the gribov mass parameter . in this case",

    "however , in this case if we change the fit parameters @xmath102 , then the result is drastically different .",
    "in fact , as we show in figure [ pres_ener_modif_rgz ] ( a ) , for a modification @xmath68 of the rgz parameters , the critical region reduces considerably . also , from figure [ pres_ener_modif_rgz ] ( b ) , we can infer that the eos can be defined for @xmath103 and for almost all @xmath6 for a modification @xmath104 of the rgz - parameters .",
    "in rgz approach . ]    in order to see how the modified parameters change the behavior of the propagator respect to the original values , we plot in figure [ propagator_modif ] the function @xmath105 defined in for different values of the condensates parameters @xmath96 , @xmath71 and gribov mass parameter @xmath78 .",
    "we can see that the curves are significantly modified for changes of @xmath106 and @xmath10 of these parameters .",
    "even more , for a change of @xmath10 ( either in the condensates or gribov mass parameter ) the real poles in the positive axis generate negatives values of @xmath105 .",
    "this means that even if by changing the parameters it is possible fix the thermodynamic problem , the corresponding propagators are quite off - scale for the lattice values . ] with respect to the lattice results .",
    "taking into account that in dimension @xmath90 there exists also the possibility to refine the gz approach @xcite , which is not the case for @xmath89 @xcite , we can perform the same analysis in three dimensions and the results are qualitatively the same as in dimension @xmath81 .",
    "in this paper , the existence and properties of the eos derived from the non - perturbative quark and gluon propagators are analyzed at one loop . in order to reduce as much as possible the number of numerical integrations ( and ,",
    "correspondingly , the numerical error ) the @xmath0-function regularization method is used .",
    "the present computations are compatible with previous results found in the reference @xcite . however , with the @xmath11-function regularization method it is possible to disclose very tiny effects that , otherwise , are difficult to disentangle from the numerical errors .",
    "indeed , in the case of quarks , the analysis reveals that , depending on the exact value of the parameters in the fit of the lattice quark propagator , the pressure as a function of the temperature ( at fixed chemical potential ) can be a non - monotonic function of the temperature .",
    "even if the effect is small , the non - monotonic behavior of the pressure in this temperature interval implies that the pressure as a function of the energy density is not single valued ( namely , one can not define an eos in the usual sense ) . by changing the fit parameters of at least @xmath68",
    ", this feature almost disappears .",
    "the physical explanation ( see appendix [ considerations ] ) of this result is the following : the non - perturbative propagators analyzed in the present manuscript can have both complex conjugated poles ( as suggested by the lattice data ) and real poles . in both cases",
    "such propagators violate positivity ( in the former case due to the complex conjugated square masses , in the latter case due to the fact that there is always a negative residue ) and so they describe confined degrees of freedom .",
    "it is true that complex conjugated poles are more natural to describe confined degrees of freedom ( as first recognized by gribov and zwanziger ) and are also supported by lattice data .",
    "however , it is interesting to explore what happens when , instead of a pair of complex conjugated poles , one gets two real poles with opposite residues . in this case , as we have explicitly shown in this manuscript , there is no pathological behavior in the thermodynamics ( despite the violation of positivity ) .",
    "the price to pay is , obviously , that it is not easy to interpret a propagator with two real poles which can be split into two terms ( one with positive and one with negative residue ) .",
    "such behavior can appear , for instance , when considering the semi - classical gribov approach at finite temperature @xcite .",
    "our personal opinion is that complex conjugated poles are clearly favored and , correspondingly , the pathologies in the thermodynamical behavior which are observed are related to the fact that some degrees of freedom ( such as light glueballs ) - which , unfortunately , are difficult to describe analytically - are missing at low temperatures . nevertheless , we think that it is an interesting observation that one can both keep alive the violation of positivity and , at the same time , solve the thermodynamical pathologies mentioned above by using real poles with opposite residues . for the sake of clarity , in the appendix [ considerations ] we present a concrete example of how the propagator changes when one moves to real poles .",
    "the same analysis has been performed for the non - perturbative gluon and ghost propagators in the gz parametrization , and the results are very similar . moreover , in this case , the present analysis is able to clearly distinguish between the scenarios with and without condensates .",
    "the reason is that , if one insists on extracting an eos in the usual sense , then it is necessary to use the refined version which includes the condensates ( and which is favored by lattice data ) .",
    "otherwise , in the case in which the only non - perturbative parameter is the gribov mass , not even a @xmath10 change in its value can guarantee the existence of an eos .",
    "the reason of this could be traced on the fact that it is not possible to avoid complex poles in the gluon propagator changing the gribov parameter @xmath94 for the gz approach .",
    "this is not the case for the rgz - approach , where one has more parameters to play with and for which could be , in principle , obtained real poles ( see appendix [ considerations ] for details ) .",
    "however , even in the case of real poles , one of the residues of the rgz - propagator has negative sign , violating positivity of the klln - lehmann spectrum representation , indicating still some sort of confinement ( see some examples of this in @xcite ) .",
    "our interpretation of the present results ( both in the quarks case and in the gluon case ) _ is not _ that it is mandatory to require the fulfillment of the three requirements mentioned in the previous sections .",
    "rather , it is that strong quantum effects could be able to violate ( the first of ) the three conditions ( the _ zeroth _ requirement of @xcite mentioned in the previous sections ) . at least in the cases analyzed here , once the condition to have a well - defined eos is satisfied",
    ", the causality and le chatelier principles are both satisfied .",
    "however , the first condition can be violated , although in small intervals , and this can have a rather big impact on the physical applications of the non - perturbative equations of state of quarks and gluons .",
    "in particular , the rhoades - ruffini bound would not be applicable anymore and one could have quark stars more massive than expected . due to the fact that already a relatively small change in the fit parameters of the lattice propagators can enforce the consistency conditions of self - gravitating qcd matter , it is of course of interest to explore the phenomenological consequences of modifications of such parameters using the mentioned consistency conditions as guideline .",
    "still it is possible that the thermodynamics at two - loop computations could have better behavior for the pressure and entropy as is the case for the massive landau - dewitt action @xcite .",
    "however , as for the ( r)gz - approach higher loops computations are very difficult , it is not easy to see what happens in the gluonic sector of this model .",
    "nevertheless , we tend to believe this behavior of the thermodynamical quantities is not just a technical issue but it is related to the lack of degrees of freedom at low temperatures ( confined phase ) .",
    "after all , we are using propagators which contain a lot of non - perturbative information ( as they come from very precise lattice fits ) .",
    "it is worth emphasizing that the existence of the eos is an assumption of great importance in the astrophysical context .",
    "for instance , a great part of the theory of gravitational hydrostatic equilibrium is based on the assumption that there is a well - defined functional relation between pressure and energy density . as there is also evidence supporting the existence of quark stars ( see the review @xcite ) , it is clear that the present results can be quite relevant in applications .",
    "on the other hand , it is a very concrete possibility that the future lattice data will confirm the actual values of the fit parameters of the lattice propagators and from an analytical point of view the thermodynamics quantities have the same behavior at two or more loops .",
    "indeed , we have also shown that the propagators with real poles ( which are free from thermodynamical pathologies ) are quite off - scale with respect to the lattice data .",
    "thus , it is unlikely that higher loops effects can take care of such a difference .",
    "in such a case , an eos ( at least in the usual sense ) would be unavailable .",
    "a non - single - valued relation between pressure and energy density suggests that there is some information missing when considering strongly interacting quarks and/or gluons .",
    "in other words , in such situations , some extra physical parameters able to properly label the equilibrium states are needed ( see appendix [ considerations ] ) .",
    "this , of course , is a quite interesting conclusion .",
    "we think that all these issues are worth to be further investigated in the future .",

    "we can write @xmath98 as the derivative with respect to some auxiliary variable @xmath114 and then taking the limit @xmath115 : @xmath116 defining a new variable @xmath117 as @xmath118 and passing to spherical coordinates , we have @xmath119 let us focus on the last integral",
    ". we can write it as @xmath120 where we used the @xmath121 property @xmath122 .",

    "we arrive at @xmath136 now , we have @xmath137 to compute the @xmath138 mode , the integral of the first term is @xmath139 where we used again the definition of the @xmath121 function .",
    "now , in order to compute the @xmath140 modes , we can show that @xmath141 the last integral can be rewritten in terms of the modified bessel function of the second kind @xmath62 @xcite : @xmath142 so we have @xmath143 defining @xmath144 and @xmath145 we arrive at @xmath146 let us compute @xmath147 first . using the properties of the @xmath121 function @xmath148 then @xmath149 taking into account @xmath150 we have @xmath151 which looks very similar to the standard dimensional regularization procedure used in quantum field theory at zero temperature @xcite .",
    "now , in order to compute @xmath152 , we observe that @xmath153 when @xmath154 , which implies @xmath155 when @xmath154 .",
    "so , in the limit @xmath154 , there only survives the term which derives from @xmath156 , i.e. , @xmath157 for the case of fermions , @xmath158 while for bosons the result is @xmath159",
    "let us analyze the expression @xmath160 considered on the quark sector after having determined the cut - off @xmath23 requiring @xmath161 .",
    "@xmath162 is simply the sum of the terms containing the bessel functions . for the sake of clarity we will stop at the first one , @xmath163 : @xmath164\\ ; , \\ ] ] where , eventually , @xmath165 . ignoring the @xmath166 term ( it is of no importance to the following ) and developing around @xmath9 , @xmath162",

    "thus , if @xmath174 is zero , @xmath162 is strictly monotonic .",
    "this is exactly what one can get , for example , changing by @xmath175 the parameters . indeed , in this case , using @xmath176 , @xmath177 , @xmath178",
    ", we get @xmath179 see equation . while , for the gluons , taking @xmath180 in equation , we get @xmath181 .",
    "obviously , as the presence of real poles over complex conjugated poles only depends on the discriminant of , one can just vary one of the three parameters keeping fixed the other two in such a way as to change the sign of the discriminant itself ( in the case of the quark propagator the analysis of the roots is more complicated as it involves a cubic equation , but , conceptually , a similar scheme can be applied ) .",
    "however , this is quite beyond the scope of the present work as our intention was just to emphasize that with real poles ( despite the violation of positivity related to the negative residue ) one can solve the above mentioned pathological behavior of the equation of state @xmath5 .",
    "the reason is that the main goal of the present paper is the analysis of the lattice propagators both of which ( quarks and gluons ) strongly favor complex conjugated poles .",
    "is it possible to obtain a strictly monotonic function even in the presence of two complex conjugate masses ?",
    "no , in this case it is possible to ensure that @xmath162 is positive .",
    "for instance , reasonable conditions to achieve this are that either @xmath182 , or @xmath183 . indeed , in these cases , assuming for example @xmath183 and @xmath184 one gets @xmath185",

    "the same will be true for the gluonic sector . in this appendix we presented a concrete example of how the propagator changes when one moves to real poles but , of course ,",
    "our main goal is to disclose the thermodynamical pathologies related to the complex poles supported by the lattice data and the necessity to include in the thermodynamical description extra degrees of freedom in order to avoid such pathologies    we conclude that in the presence of complex conjugated poles , the thermodynamical quantities as pressure and entropy are not well behaved in some region , as was already pointed out in @xcite .",
