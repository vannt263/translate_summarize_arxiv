    "double - crystal x - ray monochromators utilizing nearly perfect crystals of various semiconductor materials ( primarily si and ge ) are the primary optical devices for monochromatization of intense synchrotron radiation in the photon energy range of 5 - 30  kev .",
    "such monochromators deliver monochromatized radiation to a wide variety of x - ray experiments where relative photon energy bandwidths @xmath0 are required .",
    "besides the energy bandwidth the main performance criteria of the double - crystal monochromators are the stability and reproducibility of the photon energy scale and beam position , monochromator throughput and spectral efficiency . finally , an important criterion to address is the preservation of wavefront , which in the recent years has become increasingly important since coherence properties of x - ray sources are drastically improving . in this regard ,",
    "in - situ characterization and understanding of performance parameters of the double - crystal monochromators has become a high priority for the synchrotron community .",
    "a number of reports has been published over the years on the in - situ characterization of performance of various double - crystal monochromators .",
    "a major effort was related to minimization of thermal distortion on the first crystal of double - crystal monochromators for third - generation synchrotron sources ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "solutions involving cryo - cooling of the monochromator crystals have been found and their performance limits investigated ( e.g. , @xcite ) . to gain",
    "detailed understanding on the performance of high - heat - load double - crystal monochromators advanced characterization methods have been developed which combine finite - element analysis of thermo - mechanical response of the monochromator crystals under the heat load of synchrotron radiation with the dynamical theory of x - ray diffraction for distorted crystals ( @xcite ) .",
    "advanced in - situ characterization techniques have been applied focused on the evaluation of angular profile of the radiation beam delivered by the monochromators .",
    "the actual methods that have been used included measurements of the monochromator crystal angular reflectivity curves ( i.e. , rocking curves ) for different portions of the exit beam ( e.g. , @xcite ) , measurements using crystal analyzers @xcite , and x - ray grating interferometry @xcite .",
    "as commonly inferred , these techniques enable evaluation of the slope error on the first crystal due to the thermally induced distortion , which is a crucial step in the performance diagnostics of the high - heat - load monochromators . however , the demonstrated methods have not yet become widely spread in the community due to either a time consuming setup and measurement procedure or limited availability of specialized instrumentation such as crystal analyzers or x - ray interferometers .    a commonly used basic method for in - situ performance characterization of double - crystal monochromators involves collection and interpretation of integrated ( total ) rocking curves at variable levels of power delivered by the x - ray sources .",
    "a typical experimental setup is schematically shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : setup ] .",
    "the intensity of the exit beam dominated by the primary low - order reflection ( si 111 ) is monitored using an ionization chamber ic0 , while radiation reflected by the higher order reflection ( e.g. , si 333 ) is filtered and monitored using an additional ionization chamber ic1 . the integrated intensity detected by the ionization chamber",
    "is plotted as a function of the bragg angle of the second crystal which yields si 111 and si 333 rocking curves at various levels of power delivered by the x - ray source or power absorbed in the first crystal of the monochromator .",
    "[ fig : setup ]     in this work , an area detector ( ccd ) is placed after ic1 to produce a sequence of images of the cross section of the exit beam ( si 333 ) at various angular positions of the second crystal on its rocking curve .",
    "it is shown how imaging of the exit beam yields additional insights on the in - situ performance of the monochromator .",
    "in particular , it is shown that _ ( i ) _ thermally stabilized crystals in the double - crystal monochromators operate in the regime of weak lattice distortions where ray tracing approach is applicable , which permits unambiguous assignment of the portions of the images to the respective portions of the crystal surface ; _ ( ii ) _ at cryogenic temperatures the angular profile of the exit beam in the scattering plane directly relates to the heat - load - induced misorientation of the crystal planes along the x - ray beam footprint ; and _ ( iii ) _ sequential imaging of the cross section of the exit beam yields topographs representing local misorientation of the lattice planes and local crystal quality over the incident beam footprint .",
    "these conclusions are supported by experiments with double - crystal monochromators operated at a bending magnet beamline and an undulator beamline of the advanced photon source .",
    "the spatial resolution of the imaging method approaches the x - ray extinction depth in bragg diffraction from perfect crystals ( typically a few microns ) .",
    "empowered by diffraction imaging , rapid in - situ evaluation of the wavefront achieved in a single angular scan can facilitate design and implementation of adaptive monochromator systems where the state of the crystal is manipulated to compensate the induced thermal distortions .",
    "this can be considered as a viable approach toward wavefront - preserving high - heat - load diffracting optics .",
    "the principle of operation of the monochromator relies on the double - crystal non - dispersive geometry shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : rtrace](a ) where two identical bragg reflections with equal d - spacing are utilized . if the two crystals are perfectly aligned ( @xmath1 = 0 ) the deflection of the incident x - ray beam with a finite divergence @xmath2 due to bragg reflection from the first crystal is completely compensated by the deflection due to bragg reflection from the second crystal .",
    "the original direction of propagation centered about incident wavevector @xmath3 is preserved and the divergence of the incident x - ray beam is equal to the divergence of the exit beam ( @xmath4 ) . if an angular detuning @xmath5 of the second crystal is introduced as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : rtrace](a ) a partial overlap of the reflection regions of the two crystals takes place as shown in the corresponding dumond diagram in the wavelength - angular exit space of the first crystal which is also the entrance wavelength - angular space of the second crystal ( panel ( 1+2 ) ) .",
    "the notations on the angular axes of the dumond diagram is such that @xmath6 represents the entrance angular coordinate of the first crystal with respect to the center of its reflection region @xmath7 .",
    "similarly , @xmath8 is the exit angular coordinate of the first crystal , @xmath9 is the entrance angular coordinate of the second crystal and @xmath10 is the exit angular coordinate of the second crystal . since the second crystal is rotated clockwise @xmath11 .",
    "the wavelength axis of the dumond diagrams is given in the relative units @xmath12 .",
    "as a result of the partial overlap , the center of the reflection region in the exit space of the second crystal ( panel ( 2 ) ) shifts by @xmath1 and the central portion of the exit beam ( denoted by wavevector @xmath13 ) propagates at an angular offset @xmath14 from @xmath3 as shown in the ray tracing diagram of fig .",
    "[ fig : rtrace](a ) .",
    "the width of the rocking curve of the second crystal results from the convolution of the two identical reflection regions :    @xmath15    in this expression @xmath16 is the intrinsic angular width of the bragg reflection ( also known as darwin width ) , @xmath17 is the intrinsic relative energy width of the bragg reflection ( a quantity given by the dynamical theory of x - ray diffraction ) , and @xmath18 is the central glancing angle of incidence related to the center @xmath19 of the selected wavelength region via the bragg s law .",
    "@xmath20    where @xmath21 is the d - spacing of the working reflection .    in the practical case",
    "when the relative photon energy bandwidth of the x - ray source is greater than @xmath22 , the relative photon energy bandwidth selected by the monochromator is @xmath23    this relationship can be easily illustrated using the dumond diagram in panel ( 1 ) of fig .",
    "[ fig : rtrace](a ) .",
    "the total relative bandwidth is the combination of the intrinsic relative bandwidth @xmath22 and the divergence of the incident x - rays @xmath2 expressed in relative energy units using the linearized bragg s law .",
    "x - ray absorption of the intense incident x - ray beam in the first crystal and dissipation of the absorbed energy leads to a non - uniform temperature distribution and thermal distortion of the crystal ( known as the `` heat bump '' ) shown schematically in fig .",
    "[ fig : rtrace](b , c ) . in the following",
    "we will show that under certain conditions the image of the exit beam cross section is directly related to the thermal distortion of the first crystal along the footprint of the incident beam .    the non - uniform temperature distribution and the resulting thermal distortion lead to a variation in the d - spacing and in the local orientation of the crystal planes involved in the diffraction process .",
    "differentiation of the bragg s law yields : @xmath24    at each fixed photon energy a variation in the d - spacing @xmath25 yields an angular deviation @xmath26    the influence of such angular deviation on the resulting wavefront distortion can be neglected at cryogenic temperatures in vicinity of zero thermal expansion for the crystal material .",
    "this approximation is quite reasonable based on the fact that thermal expansion is rather small at cryogenic temperatures and an assumption that temperatures of the working crystal region do not deviate substantially from the zero thermal expansion temperature . to illustrate this approximation",
    ", we consider a si crystal of a high - heat - load monochromator under typical operating conditions at a third - generation synchrotron source .",
    "we assume that the maximum temperature variation on the first crystal along the beam footprint is on the order of 10  k in vicinity of the si zero thermal expansion point ( @xmath27  124  k ) , and that the operating photon energy @xmath28  5  kev ( @xmath29  0.4 ) .",
    "this brings the crystal close to the upper limit in the operational heat load ( @xmath30  w of absorbed power delivered by undulator a at the advanced photon source , undulator deflection parameter k  @xmath31  2 ) . taking into account the temperature dependence of the si lattice parameter @xcite eq .",
    "[ eq : dth_dd ] yields @xmath32  1  @xmath33rad , which is small compared to the characteristic divergence of the synchrotron undulator source ( @xmath34  10  @xmath33rad ) .",
    "we note that in a general case the results of measurements in the double - crystal geometry are simultaneously affected by the variations in the d - spacing and the misorientation of the reflecting planes .",
    "thus , the measured angular profile represents a gradient in the wavefront of the outgoing beam .",
    "deconvolution of the two contributions can be accomplished using monochromatization of the incident beam and application of methods of high - resolution x - ray diffraction topography ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "this however , is not practical for the in - situ performance diagnostics .    neglecting the angular deviation due to temperature - induced variation in d - spacing for each photon",
    "energy implies that the wavefront is primarily affected by the local misorientation of the bragg planes .",
    "here , we need to make another important assumption that the crystal is only weakly distorted , such that geometrical optics ( i.e. , ray - tracing ) approach is applicable .",
    "strong crystal distortions lead to generation of new wavefields due to interbranch scattering ( e.g , @xcite ) . as a result",
    "it may become difficult to draw a correspondence between a local region in the cross - section of the exit beam and a local region on the crystal surface .",
    "the physical interpretation of the criterion for the smallness of crystal distortion where the ray - tracing approach is applicable is given by authier @xcite .",
    "the lattice misorientation over the extinction length should be much smaller than the angular half - width of the intrinsic bragg reflectivity curve : @xmath35 the extinction length is a minimal characteristic length from which x - rays are dynamically reflected . in the bragg geometry it is given by the real part of the following expression .",

[ fig : fea](a ) by circles and a solid line . we note that the positive sense of rotation @xmath1 defined as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : setup ] resulted in the negative ( top - to - bottom ) shift of the exit beam in the observation plane ( see supplementary material ) .",

    "the maximum increase in the temperature with respect to this base level predicted by fea was 10  k. it was concluded that the discrepancy between the angular profiles can not be attributed to the resulting change in the d - spacing ( @xmath58rad ) induced by such small temperature deviation at this low temperature .",
    "the discrepancy could be attributed to a residual strain due to mounting of the crystal or thermal destabilization of strain - free mounting conditions due to differential thermal expansion upon cooling to the cryogenic temperatures .",

    "the result of fea suggests that the heat - load - induced slope error can be neglected .",
    "thus , the measured angular profile represents a reference level due to residual mounting - induced slope error which can be subtracted from the result of measurement at the moderate heat load ( figure  [ fig : fea](a ) ) to yield the effective heat - load - induced slope error .",
    "this difference shown in figure  [ fig : fea](c ) by circles and the solid line is compared with the difference between the corresponding fea - calculated profiles ( dashed green line ) . as seen from the figure such renormalization procedure yields a good agreement except at the downstream most portion of the beam footprint where an asymmetric deviation from the fea slope error is observed .",
    "this asymmetry could be attributed to imperfect alignment of the entrance aperture .",
    "such a likely conclusion is supported by the fact that only the bottom beam - clipping edge of the aperture was observed in the experiment .",
    "in conclusion , x - ray diffraction imaging method was applied for rapid in - situ diagnostics of double - crystal monochromators .",
    "the method is based on sequential x - ray diffraction topography of high - order bragg reflections present in the exit beam of double - crystal monochromators at synchrotron radiation facilities .",
    "the method provides visualization of the working crystal region and its properties under the heat load of intense synchrotron radiation .",

    "parameters of local rocking curves are mapped across the observation region and can be interpreted as a map of the beam footprint ( reflected intensity ) , local crystal quality ( curve width ) and wavefront distortion ( peak position ) . in the case of cryo - cooled working crystals",
    "the latter can be attributed to local misorientation of the reflecting crystal planes which can be compared to heat - load - induced slope errors derived from finite element analysis .",
