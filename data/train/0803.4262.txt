    "sher25 @xcite is an evolved blue supergiant ( bsg ) , with a @xmath4-band magnitude of 12.28 and  colour of 1.38 .",
    "it has a spectral type of b1.5  ia , similar to sk  , the progenitor of sn1987a , which was a b3  i supergiant when it exploded .",
    "sher25 is situated about 20@xmath5 north of the trapezium - like system hd97950 , at the core of the young cluster in the centre of the giant  region ngc3603 .",
    "figure  [ fig : ew ] ( lower panel ) shows part of a _ hst _ wfpc2 image of this giant galactic emission nebula with sher25 in the top left - hand corner , clearly showing its complicated emission - line nebula .",
    "sher25 was first reported by @xcite , who used photometric observations to ascertain the distance to ngc3603 and its reddening .",
    "@xcite discovered the ring - shaped nebula and apparent bipolar outflows serendipitously during a high - resolution spectral study of emission - line knots in the giant  region .",
    "the authors likened the circumstellar nebula to that of sn1987a , where the rings existed before the supernova explosion and hence appear to have been ejected by the progenitor star .",
    "@xcite , using high - resolution echelle spectra , showed that the ring and the outflow to the north - east had a high [ ] /h@xmath6 ratio , compared to the background  region . in an [ ] /h@xmath7 versus [ ] /h@xmath6 diagram ,",
    "the north - east outflow filament was clearly situated outside the location of  regions and supernova remnants .",
    "the authors interpreted this as an enhanced n abundance and concluded that the bipolar filaments consisted of stellar material that had been enriched by the cno cycle . on this basis",
    "they further suggested that sher25 was an evolved bsg that had passed through the red supergiant ( rsg ) phase , possibly a twin of the progenitor of sn1987a ( sk  ) .",
    "note that enhanced n in a stellar photosphere or circumstellar nebulae does not necessarily imply post - rsg status .",
    "the comparison with sk   is attractive , but one should note that the two central stars are rather different in luminosity and mass , sher25 ( 40 - 60 ) is more massive than sk   ( 15 - 20 ) .    in a second paper ,",
    "@xcite presented a study of the ring and bipolar outflows to investigate their physical structure and dynamics .",
    "using long - slit spectroscopic mapping of sher25 s nebula , they uncovered an asymmetric hourglass shape , with the inner ring at the waist of the hourglass .",
    "their new observations confirmed the inclination angle from @xcite , but found different expansion velocities .",
    "@xcite found far larger velocities in the bipolar outflows than in the ring , indicating that they were ejected at different times .",
    "however , @xcite found more comparable velocities and derived dynamical ages of 6,560 and 6,700  years for the ring and bipolar lobes .",
    "because of the comparable ages of the ring and the lobes , the authors concluded that _ both _ the ring and the bipolar lobes were formed from the same brief and violent mass ejection @xmath86,630 years ago .",
    "@xcite also carried out a detailed comparison of sher25 s hourglass nebula with the ring structure around sn1987a .",
    "@xcite suggested that the main differences could be attributed to the different metallicities of the regions and the main - sequence masses of the stars .",
    "they also suggested that the bipolar nebulae represented the first members of a new class of nebula around bsgs in the final stages of their evolution , somewhere between luminous blue variables ( lbvs ) and planetary nebulae .",
    "@xcite has recently discovered another galactic bsg ( hd168625 ) with a similar circumstellar ring structure .",
    "smith suggests that this could have come from an lbv - type eruption rather than being formed through a rsg - bsg wind interaction , and by implication that perhaps the sn1987a rings were formed in a similar manner .",
    "subsequently , @xcite announced two further discoveries of ring nebulae in the carina nebula , one of which encircles an early b - type supergiant .",
    "they speculate that these nebulae may be much more common than we have previously assumed .",
    "@xcite suggested that sk   had passed through a rsg phase because of large over - abundances of nitrogen ( compared to carbon and oxygen ) in early uv spectra , although their uncertainties were large .",
    "the nebular spectroscopy from @xcite seems to suggest that sher25 has also undergone a rsg phase , and is currently at a similar evolutionary stage to that of sk   before it exploded . in this scenario",
    ", sher25 evolves from a main - sequence o - type star to a rsg , at which point it undergoes convective ` dredge - up ' of cno - processed material , thereby dramatically changing the surface abundances  a major mass - ejection event at this point could then explain the n - enriched nebula .",
    "sher25 would then evolve back across the h ",
    "r diagram to greater temperatures via a ` blue loop ' , ultimately returning to the red or continuing to evolve to hotter temperatures as a wolf - rayet star .",
    "an alternative scenario to account for the n - enrichment of sher25 is that the cno - processed material was mixed from the core into the envelope via rotationally - induced mixing , while the star was on ( or near ) the main sequence .",
    "given the observed range of rotational velocities , the cno abundances seen in galactic b - type supergiants are consistent with the predictions of rotationally - induced mixing ; the results for sher25 were suggested to be similar to this population by @xcite .",
    "we also note that the massive - star population in ngc3603 appears to be predominantly coeval ( with an age of 1 - 2myr ) , but that sher25 , and one o - type supergiant , are likely to be slightly older ( @xmath84myrs ; * ? ? ?",
    "presented high - resolution optical spectroscopy of sher25 alongside a model photosphere and unified stellar wind analysis .",
    "they determined atmospheric parameters , the mass - loss rate and photospheric abundances for c , n , o , mg and si and compared them with other galactic b - type stars . they found that sher25 was not extreme or abnormal in terms of its photospheric n abundance .",
    "they also compared the c / n and n / o abundance ratios to surface abundances predicted by stellar evolutionary calculations , which assumed that the star had been through a rsg phase with convective dredge - up .",
    "the n / o abundance ratio was found to be inconsistent with the star having been a rsg and therefore the nebula was likely to have been expelled during the bsg phase instead .",
    "however , the results were found to be consistent with some degree of rotational mixing while the star was near the main sequence .",
    "the wind analysis also suggested that sher25 has a relatively normal mass - loss rate in comparison with other galactic b - type supergiants .",
    "paper  i also inspected the spectra for signs of binarity , but the exposures had insufficient temporal coverage over which to search for significant variations .    at present , the data from the star and the nebula of sher25 appear to be in conflict . paper  i did not find any evidence to suggest that the nebula was ejected during a previous rsg phase , or that sher25 had in fact been a rsg at all .",
    "moreover , no evidence for blue loops has been found in studies of b - type supergiants , nor in lbvs @xcite .",
    "however , although the higher [ ] /h@xmath6 ratios in comparison to the background ratios found by @xcite are indicative of n enrichment from the cno cycle , it is not conclusive .",
    "no quantitative abundance analysis was carried out by @xcite , as the spectra did not have sufficient wavelength coverage to determine electron densities and temperatures . in order to ascertain whether the hourglass nebula of sher25 is consistent with it having undergone a blue loop ,",
    "a detailed abundance analysis is required .",
    "the evolutionary status of sher25 has important implications for the progenitor of sn1987a .",
    "the current theory of the evolution of single stars can not account for several features of sk   and sn1987a , i.e. , the fact that sk   exploded as a bsg , the triple ring nebula , nor the chemical anomalies observed , principally the enhancement of he and cno products @xcite .",
    "this raises the question , did sk   actually go through a rsg phase",
    "? was it a completely unique star ?",
    "the observations have been reproduced by recent models of binary evolution that invoke the ` slow merger ' of a rsg with a mass of 1520  with a companion of 12 , depending on the evolutionary state of the primary at the onset of the merger @xcite .",
    "@xcite then demonstrated how this can lead to the observed triple ring structure .",
    "could the nebula around sher25 also be attributed to the presence of a companion star ?",
    "a detailed abundance analysis could also indicate the origin of the nebula .",
    "we would assume that the abundances in the nebula would be the same as those in the photosphere of the star if it had been ejected in the near past .",
    "however , if the abundances showed real differences then it would indicate that the nebula was not the result of a mass ejection from sher25 , but perhaps the result of the destruction of ( or a severe mass - loss event from ) an unseen companion .",
    "in this paper we attempt to answer some of the questions that have been raised by the previous analyses .",
    "new nebular and stellar observations are presented in section  [ sec : obs ] , followed by abundance analyses in section  [ sec : neb ] and a discussion of a potential binary companion in section  [ sec : bin ] .",
    "the implications of both the nebular analysis and the search for a companion are summarised in section  [ sec : conc ] .",
    "long - slit spectroscopy of the nebula was obtained to enable a detailed abundance analysis of the two bipolar lobes , the ring of sher25 and the background nebula of ngc3603 .",
    "the observations were taken with the eso 3.6-m telescope at la silla , chile with the eso faint object spectrograph and camera ( efosc2 ) on two consecutive nights commencing on 2003 may 7 .",
    "exposures were taken at two slit positions using grism # 11 with a 1@xmath5 slit .",
    "the slit on the first night was orientated approximately east - west ( ew ) , observing the bipolar lobes , while on the second night the slit was approximately north - south ( ns ) , observing the ring .",
    "a list of the observations is given in table  [ tab : neb ] .",
    "the slits were aligned using stars 1 and 2 , labelled in the finders in figures  [ fig : ew ] and [ fig : ns ] .",
    "the finders also show the apertures extracted along the different slit positions .",
    "the ground - based finders , shown in the top figures , are from a 10s @xmath9-band image taken with the eso multi mode instrument ( emmi ) on the eso 3.58-m new technology telescope ( ntt ) at la silla , chile .",
    "the bottom figures are @xmath10 finders of sher25 and the surrounding nebula showing the slit positions and the extracted apertures in more detail .",
    "the width of the slit in the figures does not reflect the difference in resolution of the ntt to the @xmath10 images .",
    "the final resolution of the spectra , as measured from the fwhm of the night sky lines was @xmath814 , with spectral coverage from 3550 to 7345 .",

    "the frames were debiased , then flat - fielded using normalised dome flats .",
    "six target spectra , each 1800s long , were obtained on both nights , with he - ar arcs taken before , after and during the run .",
    "unfortunately a small drift occurred during the arc exposure in the middle of the run so the processed target spectra were combined into two different sets for each night ; before and after the arc ( 1st and 2nd sets in table  [ tab : neb ] ) .",
    "the different sets were then calibrated separately and later the wavelength calibrated , extracted 1d spectra were combined .",
    "long - slit spectra suffer from geometric distortions introduced by a number of factors including differential atmospheric diffraction , the camera optics and the grism .",
    "these distortions were removed from the 2d spectra by a geometric transformation of the standards , combined arcs and the target spectra using iraf tasks within the longslit package in twodspec . using the identify and reidentify tasks spectral lines were identified in the arc spectra along the dispersion axis and reidentified at a constant interval over the whole 2d spectrum . the fitcoords task was then used to fit a 2d function to the wavelength with respect to the pixel coordinate , producing a wavelength transformation map .",
    "the geometric correction was then applied to the arc using the transform task .",
    "the wavelength map was checked by comparing the corrected arc to the original before it was applied to the standards and target spectra .    in both sets",
    "the transformation of the ew slit was not well determined in the blue near [ ]  3727 , as the spectral feature identified in the calibration arc was quite weak and unreliable .",
    "the wavelength solution in the blue was therefore slightly uncertain .",
    "no such problem , however , was encountered during the transformation of the ns slit .",
    "even with this problem , the transformation greatly improved the distortions in the spectra for both slit positions .",
    "the 2d wavelength - calibrated target spectra were then flux calibrated using the geometrically - corrected standard spectra ( extracted using apall ) .",
    "only standard star observations that were observed at a low airmass and with a larger slit - width were used for flux calibration . in both slit positions",
    "at least two standards were used .",
    "the spectra were corrected for extinction and flux calibrated using the standard iraf tasks standard , sensfunc and calibrate .",
    "the 2d spectra could not be background subtracted as the transformation at the blue end was not perfect .",
    "this was because the calibration arc had no suitable lines in the far blue , causing a small distortion to remain .",
    "the sky was instead subtracted from the extracted 1d spectra .",
    "[ fig : ap ]    the extraction apertures for the target and sky spectra , shown in figures  [ fig : ew ] and [ fig : ns ] , were identified by comparing the  emission to the stellar continuum along the slit .",
    "the exact apertures that were extracted are shown in figure  [ fig : ap ] and correspond to those in figures  [ fig : ew ] and [ fig : ns ] .",
    "the sky spectra in the ew slit were extracted from the east end of the slit where the  emission was at its lowest ( figure  [ fig : ap ] , upper panel ) .",
    "the sky from the ew slit was combined into two different spectra , sky@xmath16 and sky@xmath17 , to get a better handle on the errors associated with the sky - subtraction .",
    "sky@xmath16 and sky@xmath17 were found to differ slightly in the nebular lines , particularly in the balmer , n and o lines .",
    "the night sky lines and background features were the same in both spectra .",
    "as can been seen in figure  [ fig : ap ] ( lower panel ) the background nebulosity extends over the full length of the ns slit , so the sky spectrum was extracted from the region where the  emission dips to its lowest level .",
    "the ns and ew skies were quite similar , as we would desire , with sky@xmath16 in better agreement agreement with the ns sky spectrum .",
    "the 1d target spectra were extracted using the apall task from the wavelength and flux - calibrated 2d spectra using the brightest star as a template .",
    "the 1d spectra were then read into the spectral analysis program dipso @xcite for sky subtraction and further analysis .    as can be seen from the images of ngc3603 and",
    "figure  [ fig : ap ] , the background is highly complex and we selected the background regions for subtraction from the sher25 nebula as carefully as possible .",
    "ideally it would be desirable to sample the background adjacent to the nebular extraction window .",
    "however , at our ground - based resolution this would have led to the background often being contaminated with stellar continuum , or high regions of background flux that were not necessarily representative of the background in the nebular aperture .",
    "this is perhaps the major limitation of this ground - based study ; spectroscopy at the resolution of the _ hst _ images would undoubtedly improve this .",
    "thus , we demonstrate throughout this paper the consequence of using two different sky selections , and propagate that through the abundance analyses .",
    "the extracted 1d spectra were sky subtracted , then the first and second sets of both the ew and ns target spectra ( table  [ tab : neb ] ) were combined within dipso .",
    "the ew spectra were then sky subtracted and co - added .",
    "the night sky lines were fully subtracted in all the spectra illustrating the success of the sky subtraction .",
    "the extracted , sky - subtracted target spectra are shown in figures  [ fig : ewspec ] and [ fig : nsspec ] , and a line identification is given in figure  [ fig : ec ] .",
    "the line fluxes were measured in dipso using the emission line fitting package elf .",
    "the errors in the line fluxes were estimated from the root - mean - square ( rms ) of the continuum and were taken to be @xmath18 , where the @xmath19 represents the width of the line where the flux is 6% of the peak , i.e. the width at the base of the line .",
    "a 1% flux calibration error was also combined in quadrature .",
    "sher25 was observed using the university college london chelle spectrograph ( ucles ) on the anglo - australian telescope ( aat ) on the night of 1999 may 28 , as described in paper  i. two wavelength regions were observed , one centred at 4335 , with the other at 6560 .",
    "the ucles spectra lacked good temporal coverage , but the blue - region exposures were still check for evidence of a companion in paper  i , with no velocity shifts found at a significance greater than the estimated error of @xmath86  .",
    "sher25 has since been observed using the fibre - fed , extended range optical spectrograph ( feros ) on the 2.2-m max planck gesellschaft ( mpg)/eso telescope on 2004 july 57 and again six months later with the same instrument .",
    "feros is a fixed configuration instrument , with @xmath9 = 48,000 , giving a wide wavelength coverage of 36009200  in one exposure .",

    "we present results from re - analysis of the high - resolution ucles spectra using three contemporary model atmosphere codes ; these results now supercede those from paper  i. in the first instance we employed the photospheric code tlusty to determine atmospheric parameters and abundances in the photosphere , assuming no wind contribution to any of the optical lines .",

    "the nitrogen and carbon abundances are in reasonable agreement between the new methods ( within the typical uncertainty of @xmath780.2dex ) , however the absolute oxygen abundance is significantly lower in the cmfgen analysis than the other two . as sher25 is a very luminous supergiant with a strong wind , we favour adopting the results of either fastwind or cmfgen as the most reliable measure of photospheric abundances .",
    "we suggest that the fastwind abundances are the better estimate , as we employed all of the 15 oii and 7 nii lines that were included in the observed spectra , and for which reliable atomic data exists .",
    "the cmfgen analysis used profile fitting to a smaller number of selected lines .",
    "for example , for oxygen these were oii @xmath794069 - 4092  and @xmath794590 - 96 .",
    "the use of more lines in the fastwind analysis , and the resulting mean abundance , mitigates against systematic uncertainties in atomic data for any particular multiplet .",
    "as we want the best estimate of absolute abundances in the stellar photosphere for comparison with the nebular results and solar - like abundances , we therefore adopt the fastwind values as the best comparison .",
    "the uncertainties in the table are the standard error of the mean , and are just a measure of the statistical scatter of the results from the individual atomic transitions .",

    "however , considering the uncertainties in the absolute values of both , the difference is not significant and we consider the results to be consistent . the n / o ratio ( by number ) in the nebula and",
    "the star are also consistent within the uncertainties , and both are significantly higher than that previously reported by paper  i. the reason for the lower value in paper  i was the very high o abundance derived .",
    "as discussed above , we believe that the fastwind models produce more reliable results than the previous spherical , blanketed models .",
    "the fact that the new tlusty results , fastwind abundances , and nebular values are in good agreement supports our conclusion that the n / o of the stellar photosphere and nebula is in the range @xmath82 .",
    "the morphology of the nebula and the strength of the n emission lines were suggested by brandner et al .",
    "( 1997a , b ) to be a consequence of the star having gone through a previous rsg phase .",
    "a similar evolutionary path for sk   has been proposed to explain the hourglass - shaped nebula now seen around sn1987a .",
    "the very high n / o which is quantitatively similar in both the stellar photosphere and the nebula could be interpreted as supporting this scenario .",
    "@xcite presented the abundances that are predicted for the stellar envelope by the models of after convective mixing during the rsg phase .",
    "as discussed above , the best estimate for the initial mass of sher25 is @xmath81 .",
    "adopting a typical mass - loss rate of @xmath83 and a main sequence ( core hydrogen burning ) lifetime , @xmath84 , of 4myr , the star is likely to have lost around 820 .",
    "this would leave sher25 with 6085% of its mass at the onset of the convective mixing .",
    "@xcite plotted the logarithmic n / o abundance as a function of the remaining mass fraction for several masses .",
    "the models indicate that sher25 should have a n / o abundance in the range of @xmath85 if it had gone through a previous rsg phase , and was originally a 40 - 60  main - sequence star .",
    "hence our n / o result is just consistent with the lower end of this range , and one could interpret this as support for the star being in a post - rsg phase .",
    "similar n enhancements for stars on blue loops are found by @xcite , who find that a 25  star should show an n enhancement of around 1.0dex after having passed through rsg dredge - up .    however , we suggest that it is quite possible that the star has not been through a rsg phase and that the n enrichment we see is due to rotational mixing while the star was on the main - sequence . for example",
    "@xcite also predict the surface abundances for rotationally - induced mixing as a function of mixing time , and our abundances are more consistent with this scenario .",
    "the authors predict n / o abundances in the range of @xmath86 for weak - to - strong mixing .",
    "weak mixing has a mixing time greater than 5@xmath84 , and strong mixing less than 0.5@xmath84 .",
    "the n / o abundance of the sher25 nebula is consistent with a moderate amount of mixing , with a mixing time of 2.5@xmath87 .",
    "the n abundance is also greatly enriched by almost a factor of 30 above the background nebula and around 13 times that of the solar levels .",
    "similar values for n / o enrichment are also predicted by @xcite , although their most massive models were for 25 .",
    "the post - rsg scenario has a further problem in that a star of initial mass 50  is somewhat too massive to have been a rsg with a convective envelope .",
    "observationally we tend not to see rsgs with luminosities that would place their initial masses above 25  @xcite .",
    "theoretical tracks at 40  and above also do not reach the coolest regions where the atmospheres are certain to become convective .",
    "smith ( 2007 ) also points out this problem with the rsg origin of the nebula for sher25 citing the lack of very massive , cool supergiants in observational h ",
    "r diagrams of single stars in the local group ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the consistency we see between the nebular n and o abundances show that the nebula is of the same composition as the stellar photosphere .",
    "we would suggest that this likely due to an ejection event from sher25 when it was in the bsg phase rather than a combination of a rsg with a dense slow wind being swept up by a subsequent faster wind from the hot b - type phase @xcite .",
    "smith ( 2007 ) has also advanced dynamical arguments that the newly discovered ring structure around hd168625 was ejected in a lbv eruption while the star was in the hot blue phase rather than being a swept up rsg wind .",
    "there seems to be a body of evidence now arguing against the rsg origin for these ring nebulae and perhaps an ejection mechanism while the star is still hot .",
    "we note that hd168625 is of significantly lower luminosity and lower initial mass ( @xmath820 ) than sher25 ( @xmath850 ) , and it is interesting that such similar ring structures are found around blue supergiants of vastly different mass .",
    "a mechanism for ejection of a nebula which has bipolar lobes and a disk structure from a near critically - rotating bsg has been proposed by @xcite .",
    "this requires a pre - rsg phase and is attractive for very massive stars with circumstellar nebulae showing this type of morphology .",
    "clearly sher25 is not currently rotating near its break - up velocity ; its photospheric line - widths were given by paper  i as 98  .",
    "this is an upper limit to the @xmath88 as there is clear evidence now for a macroturbulent broadening mechanism in the atmospheres of hot supergiants @xcite .",
    "the results from these analyses would which would suggest a more likely rotational velocity for sher25 of 60  . if we assume that the rotation axis is aligned with the bi - polar lobes , then the inclination angle @xmath89 @xcite would suggest a @xmath90  , far lower than critical .",
    "however this does not rule out the possibility of very fast rotation earlier in its lifetime .",
    "as b - type supergiants are evolved from massive o - type main - sequence stars , these progenitors often are rotating very rapidly and can be near critical .",
    "the overall stellar parameters of sher25 ( temperature , luminosity , mass - loss rate and photospheric abundances ) are very much in line with those derived for other milky way b - type supergiants and the star itself does not appear anomalous in any striking way .",
    "the nebular abundances presented here support this view point . apart from its nebula",
    ", it appears as a typical b - type supergiant in a normal young star cluster .",
    "however as demonstrated clearly by melena et al .",
    "( 2008 ) , sher25 has an implied age of 4myrs which is significantly older than the most massive cluster members which are around 1myr old .",
    "sher25 also sits some 20@xmath5 from the core which contains the bulk of the most massive stars .",
    "there is one other slightly evolved supergiant ( sher23 ) , which also appears to be a similar age to sher25 .",
    "so there is some evidence of an age spread in the star - formation history of ngc3603 and the question of whether sher25 was formed in the core and ejected , or formed near were we see it now , is still open .",

    "the data was fitted by @xmath92 , which had @xmath93 , corresponding to a period of around 3d and an amplitude of 8.44  .",
    "the @xmath91 values are very low as a result of the error of 6  attached to each of the points , being large and perhaps overestimated .",

    "2004 ) for sher25 , we can put some limits on the parameters of the system to ascertain if the binary scenario is plausible .",
    "the parameters from the fit in figure  [ fig : sine2 ] , together with the lower limit of the radius ( 45 ) as the lower limit of the separation , indicate that the combined mass of the primary and secondary would have to be greater than 136 .",
    "this would suggest that the secondary would be much more massive than sher25 , contrary to what we observe .",
    "the short period , but low maximum velocity amplitude of sher25 are hence inconsistent with a plausible close binary . moving the centre of mass closer than the radius of sher25 might be attractive to slow merger hypotheses ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) . however , this is very speculative , as the dataset does not have enough temporal coverage to say one way or another .",
    "an altogether different explanation for these observations could be pulsations or some other natural variation in the stellar envelope or , given that the velocity shifts are of the same order as the uncertainties , an artifact of the wavelength calibration .",
    "note , however , the same velocity shift is not present in the interstellar caii @xmath963933  line . given this evidence , sher25 certainly warrants further spectroscopic monitoring in the future .",
    "another interesting feature of sher25 is evidence of a variable wind .",
    "figure  [ fig : wind ] shows the h@xmath6 and  profiles of the sher25 spectra , where the colours used are as follows : black = 1999 may 28 , red = 2004 july  5 , green = 2004 july  7 , blue  =  2004  december  30 , light blue = 2004 december  31 and pink = 2005 january  1 .",
    "the h@xmath6 profiles , in all cases , show a variable double peak , which is the nebular component of sher25 superimposed onto the stellar profile .",
    "the peaks of the profiles are probably varying because of the different amounts of nebular emission that made it into either the slit or the aperture , depending on their exact position , or because of the sky subtraction .",
    "the ucles ( black line ) spectra are from a single - slit spectrograph , whereas feros is a fibre - fed instrument .",
    "paper  i noted that the secondary peak bluewards of the rest wavelength of  in the ucles spectrum is a result of the imperfect nebular subtraction .",
    "feros has two fibres , each of 2@xmath5 diameter , which are separated by a fixed angular distance of 2.9@xmath97 . because of field rotation , it is highly probable that different amounts of the nebula were subtracted from different feros observations , as a result of the sky fibre being located at different positions in the extended and highly variable background nebula .",
    "the point of interest in this figure is the trough of the p - cygni profile , which varies significantly in time , indicating the variability of the wind .",
    "the resolution of the spectra is good enough to resolve the two components of the profile , therefore the variation is considered to be real , as it will not be affected by the sky subtraction .",
    "this variability is not seen in the profiles of the photospheric  lines , which have been corrected for the observed radial velocity offsets , indicating that it does indeed appear to come from the wind .",
    "+    [ fig : wind ]",
    "long - slit spectroscopy of the hourglass - shaped nebula surrounding sher25 was presented alongside that of the background nebula of ngc3603 .",
    "the nebular analysis confirmed the enhanced n abundances suggested by @xcite , but they are not enhanced enough to indicate definitively that sher25 has been through a rsg phase . however , the n abundance was enhanced by a factor of 30 above the background nebular values . a new analysis with the fastwind unified stellar atmosphere and wind code suggests that the photospheric n and o abundances in sher25 are consistent with the nebular results .",
    "we therefore conclude that the nebula was ejected from the star while it was a bsg .",
    "probable variations in the stellar radial velocity were discovered and it was shown that there was a possible binary scenario for the variation with a period and amplitude of 3d and 8.44  . using simple keplerian arguments",
    "it was shown that , if a companion exists , the combined mass of the primary and the secondary would have to be greater than 136 .",
    "this is not a plausible scenario as no massive companion is visible in the extensive imaging or spectroscopy of this object .",
    "the masses might be more plausible if the separation of the binary is less than the radius of sher25 , and we were witnessing a slow merger .",
