    "in the late eighties , optical imaging surveys for gravitationally lensed quasars have used sample of known qsos selected on the basis of apparently large absolute luminosities and high redshifts ( turner et al . 1984 , meylan et al . 1990 , swings et al .",
    "1990 , surdej et al . 1992 ) . combining all radio and optical surveys ,",
    "the number of multiple - image quasars due to gravitational lensing amounts to about twenty more or less convincing cases ( keeton and kochanek 1996 ) .    in the framework of the eso key - program on gravitational lensing ( surdej et al .",
    "1989 ) , a large sample of highly luminous quasars has been observed between 1989 and 1992 .",
    "one of the gravitationally lensed quasar candidates found is the radio - loud quasar pks  1610771 , at @xmath0 = 1.710 from hunstead & murdoch ( 1980 ) , for which preliminary poor - seeing imaging has been obtained in august 1991 by meylan & djorgovski using the eso 3.5-m new technology telescope ( ntt ) . in spite of these non - optimal seeing conditions ,",
    "the object appeared double .    in april and may 1995 , we have been able to obtain , under much better seeing conditions , new ntt @xmath1 and @xmath2 images of the field of pks  1610771 , as well as long - slit low - resolution spectra of both the quasar and its companion .",
    "these observations are presented and discussed here , together with polarimetric measurements by impey & tapia ( 1988 ) .",
    "the observations took place during the two nights of april 17 - 18 and may 16 - 17 , 1995 , using the ntt in remote control observing mode , from the eso headquarters in garching , germany .",
    "the telescope was used with emmi , the eso - multi - mode - instrument .",
    "the detector was the eso ccd # 36 , a tektroniks 2048@xmath72048 , with a pixel size of 24@xmath8 m corresponding to 0.268  on the plane of the sky .",
    "the photometric conditions were good during the two observing runs , although a few cirri present during the observations with the @xmath2 filter prevented flux calibration of these frames .",
    "= 6.7 cm    two images were obtained with the @xmath1 filter during the night of april 17 - 18 , 1995 .",
    "the final co - added frame has a total exposure time of 1,200 seconds , with a seeing of 0.85 , giving a limiting magnitude of 23.5 in @xmath1 ( 2-@xmath9 in at least 3 pixels ) .",
    "the two images in the @xmath2 filter were obtained during the night of may 16 - 17 , 1995 .",
    "the final co - added frame has a total exposure time of 1,200 seconds , with a seeing of 0.95 .",
    "1 displays part of the images in the two @xmath1 and @xmath2 bands ( upper panels ) , as well as the result of the subtraction of a double two - dimensional psf profile ( lower panels ) .",
    "the profiles of both the quasar and the star were fitted simultaneously in order to take into account relative light contamination of one object by the other .",
    "the psf subtraction was carried out using the high - performance codes written by remy ( 1996 ) to detect gravitational deflectors . in order to optimize the quality of the subtraction , the numerical psf",
    "was calculated by using four different stars , all of them as bright as the quasar and as close to the quasar as possible in order to minimize any possible psf variations across the field .",
    "the final psf is a weighted average of the individual psfs obtained from these stars .",
    "the psf subtractions are carried out on the individual 600 seconds exposures in order to avoid any psf changes due to the alignment procedure of the frames .",
    "the individual residuals are then added and are displayed in fig .  1 . +      in fig .  1",
    ", the quasar pks  1610771 appears fuzzy and clearly separated from the object located at 4.55  to the nw and suspected to be a second , lensed , image of the quasar .",
    "the latter has definitely a stellar - like profile and does not leave any significant residual after the psf subtraction . the follow - up spectroscopic observations ( see  3 below ) confirm its stellar nature and rule out the possibility that pks  1610771 is a multiple image gravitationally lensed quasar .",
    "three resolved , galaxy - like , objects ( noted a , b , and c ) surround the quasar position on the plane of the sky .",
    "an additional faint object ( noted d ) appears only after the psf subtraction ; it is detected in the two individual @xmath1 frames and their sum , as shown in fig .  1 .",
    "although with a worse seeing , significant residuals are also seen on the @xmath2 frames at the position where d is detected on the @xmath1 frames .",
    "this faint d feature is unlikely to be an artifact due to bad psf subtraction , since no significant residual can be seen after the subtraction of the psf profile from the nearby star .",
    "other applications of our psf subtraction method show it to be reliable and free of any artifacts ( magain et al .",
    "1992 , remy et al .",
    "1993 ) .",
    "table  1 gives the @xmath1 magnitudes of the objects in the field , as well as their positions relative to the quasar .",
    "flux calibration was done using the star ltt  7987 ( landolt 1992 ) observed at an airmass of 1.1 , while pks  1610771 was at a mean airmass of 1.55 .",
    "the magnitudes and positions were obtained using `` s - extractor '' , an aperture photometry program which computes the magnitudes through elliptical isophotes fitted to the objects ( bertin & arnouts 1996 ; bertin 1996 ) .",
    "two @xmath1 magnitudes are given : @xmath10 magnitudes are measured on the summed @xmath1 frame while the @xmath11 magnitudes are derived from the psf subtracted frame .",
    "the magnitudes @xmath12 are more accurate for the fuzzy objects , since they do not suffer from light contamination by the point - like bright objects .",
    "although we can not calibrate the @xmath2-band image in flux , it is possible to derive the relative brightness of the quasar and the nearby star , and to compare it with the relative brightness found in the @xmath1 band .",
    "we find @xmath13 , whereas @xmath14 , showing that the quasar is much redder than the star ( as can , in fact , be seen from the spectra shown in fig .",

    "pks  1610771 was already recognized by hunstead & murdoch ( 1980 ) as a flat - spectrum radio - source with a steep optical continuum .",
    "observed with the vlbi by preston et al .",
    "( 1989 ) , pks  1610771 appeared slightly elongated ( pa = 35 @xmath15 ) at the milliarcsecond scale . its high optical linear polarization ( p = 3.8 @xmath16 0.7 % ; @xmath17 = 78 @xmath16 5  @xmath15 ) led impey & tapia ( 1988 , 1990 ) to classify this object as a blazar , although there is no evidence for polarimetric variability .    while a few blazars display a curved continuum ( see falomo et al .",
    "1994 ) , none of them appears as steep as the one of pks  1610771 .",
    "baker & hunstead ( 1995 ) give composite spectra of quasars with various values of @xmath1 , the core - to - lobe radio flux density ratio . the composite spectrum which corresponds to the @xmath1 ratio of pks  1610771 , viz .",
    "@xmath1 @xmath4 0.3 ( impey & tapia 1990 ) , shows a strong ultraviolet - optical bump .",
    "although the blue end of the bump is well defined ( baker & hunstead 1995 ) , it is not seen in our spectra of pks  1610771 , in which the slope of the short - wavelength continuum ( blueward 6,000 @xmath18 ) is constant and much steeper than in the composite spectrum .",
    "steep continua are not uncommon in flat - spectrum radio quasars ( e.g. , rieke et al . 1979 ) .",
    "however , such continua , attributed to an extension of the synchrotron radio emission , extend from the optical to the infrared , contrary to what is observed in the spectrum of pks  1610771 .",
    "indeed , the continuum slope we measure longwards of mgii , @xmath19 , is in reasonable agreement with the radio - to - optical slope reported by impey & tapia ( 1990 ) : @xmath20 , suggesting a net deficiency of flux bluewards of @xmath21  .",
    "a most plausible explanation is dust absorption , which apparently occurs frequently in quasars ( webster et al .",
    "dust may be either internal , in a dusty torus around the nucleus or external , i.e. in the host galaxy , or in intervening galaxies on the line of sight .",
    "figure 4 illustrates a reasonable example of de - reddening using an smc - like extinction curve ( prvot et al .",
    "1984 ) with e(b - v)=0.4 and assuming the dust at the redshift of the quasar .",
    "the de - reddened spectrum shows a shape compatible with the `` usual '' shape of quasar continua , e.g. like the quasars observed in the lbqs sample ( morris et al .",
    "feii emission can also be a present , as observed for example in pg  0043 + 039 ( turnshek et al .",
    "1994 )    = 9.0 cm    the nature of the fuzzy objects ( a+d ) very near or superposed on pks  1610771 is unclear .",
    "they could constitute the quasar host galaxy : their size and brightness ( cf .",
    "table 1 ) are comparable to those of the fuzzy objects / host - galaxies found around high redshift radio - loud quasars ( hutchings 1995 ) .",
    "we can however not exclude the fact that it is a galaxy located on the line of sight , although no absorption features ( in the mgii line for example ) due to an intervening object can be unambiguously identified in our spectra , except the possible residual absorptions observed between 7,200 and 7,400  .",
    "note however that these features could as well be due to the gap between the two strong feii emission bands seen in agns spectra at @xmath22  @xmath23 and @xmath24  @xmath25 ( wills et al .",
    "even if we can not ascertain the redshift of the objects around pks  1610771 , we can give the plausible redshift range of 1 - 1.7 , comparing the magnitudes given in table 1 with the predicted ones from guiderdoni and rocca - volmerange ( 1988 ) .",
    "most interesting is the fact that the a - d fuzzy elongation is detected in the continuum and that its direction ( pa @xmath26 173@xmath27 ) is orthogonal to the @xmath3 vector of the integrated optical polarization ( @xmath17 @xmath26 @xmath28 ) measured by impey & tapia ( 1988 , 1990 ) .",
    "this property is an important characteristics of high redshift radio - galaxies ( di serego alighieri et al .",
    "1993 ) , which , in the context of agn unification models , are thought to be related to radio - loud quasars , simply being differently oriented relative to the observer .",
    "this suggests that the high polarization of pks  1610771 could be due to diffusion as in radio - galaxies , rather than to a synchrotron emission as in bona - fide blazars .",
    "note that the vlbi structure of pks  1610771 ( pa @xmath26 35@xmath29 ) is not aligned with the optical polarization , on the contrary to the majority of highly polarized radio - sources ( impey et al .",
    "the present spectroscopic observations lead to the conclusion that the quasar pks  1610771 is not gravitationally lensed .",
    "however , in addition to its quite unusual spectrum , it appears fuzzy and surrounded by a rich environment of faint galaxies ( which could magnify the quasar s luminosity ) .",
    "the quasar s spectrum shows a break at 7,600  @xmath18 ( 2,800  @xmath23 rest frame ) and an unusually steep slope blueward 7,600  @xmath23 , most likely due to strong reddening by intervening objects on the line of sight and/or by the quasar s host galaxy .",
    "our sub - arcsecond @xmath1 and @xmath2 images of the quasar show fuzzy extensions supporting the possible presence of absorbing objects on the line - of - sight .",
    "the orientation of the continuum emission of the fuzz around pks  1610771 , perpendicular to the optical polarization , suggests that the polarization of the quasar could be due to diffusion , as in radio - galaxies .",
    "pks  1610771 therefore appears as an interesting object , possibly intermediate between blazars and radio - galaxies , its core being not completely obscured and hidden , as for example in 3c  265 ( dey & spinrad 1996 ) , but highly reddened .",
    "further observations are needed to identify the exact nature and the redshifts of the fuzzy objects around pks  1610771 , its spectral energy distribution on a wide wavelength range , and more particularly which mechanism is responsible for the observed optical polarization .",
    "confirming objects a+d as the host galaxy of pks  1610771 would provide us with a unique case of highly reddened ( but not hidden ) qso in a high redshift ( z=1.7 ) radio galaxy , strongly supporting the agns unification schemes .",

    "hunstead and j. baker for helpful comments and for providing their published composite quasar spectrum , as well as e. bertin for help and comments concerning the optimal use of his photometry program .",
