    "luminous elliptical galaxies are the astronomical analog of tree rings or geological core samples  within the hot gas in these massive galaxies resides important information about the earliest stages of galaxy formation and the enrichment of the cosmos with heavy elements from the first generations of stars .",
    "the stellar density profile and low rotation of bright ellipticals indicate that they were assembled from smaller galactic objects containing stars .",
    "the most likely sites for the formation of giant elliptical galaxies are small groups of galaxies where mutual tidal interactions are strong and the likelihood of galactic merging is enhanced . in an idealized version of this formation hypothesis ,",
    "the merging process within the group comes to completion after a few dynamical times when the massive central elliptical has consumed the dark and luminous matter of many original group galaxies of moderate mass .",
    "when this happens , the merging process shuts down and the elliptical evolves passively as a group - dominant elliptical in the field or enters a large cluster . while there is clear evidence that some massive ellipticals contain younger stars and must have suffered significant mergers since the epoch of most intense galaxy formation , there is also evidence that other more venerable ellipticals have survived until the present time , relatively undisturbed by events that have occurred since their formation at early times .",
    "the hot interstellar gas in these old galaxies is most interesting since it still contains information about the earliest stages of star formation , including the heating and enrichment of the gas by supernovae .    in this paper",
    "we investigate the production of iron and silicon by type ia and type ii supernovae ( snia and snii respectively ) and follow the dynamical redistribution of these metals in the hot interstellar and intragroup gas until the present time .",
    "gas enrichment and dynamical evolution are linked since the collective energy released by type ii supernovae can expel metal - enriched gas from elliptical galaxies in a wind .",
    "the energetics of type ii supernovae during early star formation can be constrained by comparing heavy metal abundances expected from evolutionary gas dynamical calculations with abundances provided by x - ray observations of individual massive ellipticals . in a similar fashion",
    ", metal abundances observed in rich clusters of galaxies provide global enrichment constraints on early type galaxies which are generally regarded as the principal source of metals in the intracluster gas .",
    "rich clusters are thought to have retained all of the products of supernova enrichment either within galactic stars or in the hot intracluster medium . in this sense",
    "rich clusters are closed boxes . from an observational standpoint",
    "individual massive elliptical galaxies are certainly not closed boxes since most of the metals produced by supernovae have been carried out by supernova - driven winds .",
    "much of these metals now resides in low density gas at large distances from the optical galaxy where detection is difficult or where the metal enriched gas has been tidally or dynamically removed . from the standpoint of our gas dynamical models , however , individual ellipticals _ are _ closed boxes since we can accurately follow the products of supernova enrichment into distant regions of very low density .",
    "thermal x - ray emission from hot circumgalactic gas surrounding many bright ellipticals often extends far beyond the optical image of the galaxy ( mathews & brighenti 1998a ) .",
    "the large mass and extended spatial distribution of this gas can not be understood only from normal evolutionary stellar mass loss .",
    "our dynamical models indicate that the most distant gas in these galactic halos has accumulated by secondary infall into the perturbation that initially led to the formation of the group and its dominant elliptical ( brighenti & mathews 1998a , 1998b ; mathews & brighenti 1998b ) .",
    "the objective of our recent gas dynamical calculations has been to follow the evolution of the hot gas within and around massive elliptical galaxies since the time of galaxy formation . a successful model can reproduce the radial density and temperature distributions as determined from x - ray observations . in our recent models we begin with an overdensity perturbation in a simple flat cosmology . as dark matter accumulates in the core of the growing perturbation",
    ", we assume that a stationary nfw dark matter halo is formed ( navarro , frenk and white 1996 ) . exterior to this stationary halo the dark matter inflow is identical to the cosmic similarity flow of bertschinger ( 1985 ) .",
    "the baryonic gas evolves in this time - dependent potential : flowing inward , shocking at some radius and radiatively cooling near the center . at some early time , @xmath0 ,",
    "when enough baryons have accumulated in the perturbation , we form the de vaucouleurs profile of the large elliptical observed today . by this means we circumvent the complex merging processes that occurred at very early times .",
    "nevertheless , our calculation globally conserves dark and baryonic mass and treats the gas dynamics in full detail from @xmath0 to the present time . in these simple models we release the type ii supernova energy at the same time @xmath0 that the stellar system is formed but the type ia energy is released from @xmath0 to the present according to some assumed variable rate .",
    "however , there is a degeneracy in our successful solutions .",
    "we find that the hot gas density and temperature profiles typical of massive ellipticals , @xmath1 and @xmath2 , can be reproduced with different combinations of the fundamental model parameters : the time of star formation @xmath0 , the total snii energy released @xmath3 , and the universal baryon mass fraction @xmath4 as determined by big bang nucleosynthesis ( walker et al .",
    "for example , solutions with @xmath5 decreased by @xmath6 are similar to those with @xmath3 increased by @xmath7 or with @xmath0 decreased by @xmath8 gyr .",
    "much of the degeneracy involving these uncertain parameters can in principle be removed by considering the abundance and of iron and other elements produced in supernovae .",
    "the total mass of heavy elements in stars and gas today is directly related to the total number of supernovae of each type that have occurred .",
    "unfortunately , many of the essential supernova - related parameters are poorly known : the average amount of iron or silicon created in each supernova event , the total mass of these elements locked into stars today , the initial mass function ( imf ) , etc .    while we can not attempt here a definitive theoretical resolution of the enrichment history of early type galaxies",
    ", we can make progress within the limitations of current theory and observational data . in view of the uncertainties",
    "involved , however , a highly detailed gas dynamical calculation including the effects of metal enrichment seems unwarranted .",
    "the approximate results we present here can be regarded as the first step in an iterative procedure that will become better defined in the future .",
    "nevertheless , the metal enrichment history of elliptical galaxies that we describe here is sufficient to rule out several scenarios that have been widely discussed .",
    "one of our motivations for beginning this project is the apparent dissimilarity of iron abundance and gas fraction between galaxy groups and rich clusters which led david ( 1997 ) and renzini ( 1997 ) to remark that present - day , rich clusters can not be assembled from present - day groups .",
    "for example , most ( 50% - 80% ) of the mass of heavy metals in rich clusters resides in the intracluster gas where the iron mass per unit of stellar light @xmath9 consistently exceeds that in small groups or individual massive ellipticals .",
    "moreover , the lower fraction of gas mass in galaxy groups relative to clusters indicates that much of the metal - enriched gas produced in groups or individual ellipticals has been expelled into the environment by the release of supernova energy ( arnoud , et al .",
    "1992 ; david , jones , & forman 1995 ) .",
    "perhaps , therefore , the gas and iron formerly within large ellipticals and galaxy groups has been expelled by supernova - driven winds into the low density environment where it escapes x - ray detection . however ,",
    "this low density , metal - enriched gas can be followed in our gas - dynamical models . in successful models",
    "the metal rich gas remaining within the galaxy must agree with the gas abundance and abundance gradients observed in these bright galaxies .",
    "our results reported here indicate , however , that the mass of metals that has flowed out of luminous ellipticals into their low density environment is insufficient to account for the larger mass of metals observed in rich clusters .",
    "we are therefore faced with a fundamental inconsistency : parameters that allow the intracluster gas to be enriched by galactic winds from massive ellipticals are inconsistent with detailed x - ray observations of the metal content within individual ellipticals .",
    "the relative importance of snii and snia in creating the metals observed in cluster gas has been widely debated .",
    "the total iron abundance in rich clusters is too large to be produced by snii with a standard salpeter imf .",
    "many authors have suggested that snia produce enough iron to account for the additional iron required ( e.g. ishimaru & arimoto 1997 ; renzini 1997 ; wyse 1997 ) .",
    "this solution is appealing since approximately @xmath10 of the iron in our galaxy is produced by type ia supernovae ( renzini 1997 ) .",
    "however , we show here that the total silicon produced by both types of supernova , when considered along with additional gas dynamical constraints , indicates that snia produce at most only a few percent of the total iron in massive ellipticals .",
    "by contrast , if snii are the primary source of metal enrichment in rich clusters then the imf must be flatter than salpeter ; this solution to the iron problem has been suggested by david ( 1997 ) and gibson , loewenstein & mushotzky ( 1997 ) .",
    "however , the iron abundance and its radial gradient observed in massive ellipticals can not be fit with our gas - dynamical models if the number of snii exceeds the salpeter value .",
    "it would appear therefore that massive ellipticals may not be the primary source of enrichment of the intracluster gas .",
    "we begin our discussion with a review and reanalysis of the observed iron and silicon abundances in rich clusters and discuss the implications of these abundances for clusters and individual early type galaxies .",
    "the mean iron abundance observed in the hot gas in rich clusters is about 0.40 in solar units with a cosmic scatter ( 0.3 - 0.65 ) that exceeds the errors of measurement ( mushotzky 1998 ) .",
    "these values are somewhat greater than the iron abundances quoted in the x - ray literature , most of which are based on the `` photospheric '' solar iron abundance ( by mass ) @xmath11 since we assume here the lower , `` meteoritic '' , solar iron abundance @xmath12 .",
    "this distinction between `` meteoritic '' and `` photospheric '' solar iron abundance was made in the review by anders & grevesse ( 1989 ) .",
    "however , recent atmospheric models of the sun indicate that the iron abundance in the solar photosphere is similar to the so - called `` meteoritic '' value of anders & grevesse ( holweger et al . 1991 ; biemont et al .",
    "1991 ; mcwilliam 1997 ) .",
    "the implications of the lower @xmath13 for x - ray abundances has been discussed by ishimaru & arimoto ( 1997 ) and gibson , loewenstein , & mushotzky ( 1997 ) .",
    "arnaud et al . (",
    "1992 ) have shown that the total gas mass in the hot intracluster medium ( icm ) of rich clusters @xmath14 and the mass of iron in that gas are proportional to the total optical luminosity @xmath15 of all early type galaxies in the cluster .",
    "arnaud et al .",
    "find that @xmath14 is uncorrelated with the total @xmath16 from spiral galaxies in these clusters . based on these findings",
    ", it is generally assumed that early type galaxies dominate the cluster gas enrichment .",
    "the relative contributions of type ii and type ia supernovae ( snii and snia ) to the icm metal enrichment has been widely discussed .",
    "the total mass of a particular heavy element in the icm can be determined from the mass of that element produced by supernovae and the total number of supernova events in the past .",
    "the number of snii events can be inferred from the total spheroidal stellar mass in the cluster , together with an assumed initial mass function ( imf ) to determine the fraction of stars that become type ii supernovae . for snia the currently observed rate for ellipticals",
    "is poorly known and almost nothing is known about the snia rate at earlier times .",
    "the snia rate is thought to depend on mass exchange between binary stars and theory provides no unambiguous way to estimate orbital parameters and binary mass ratios .",
    "the yields of heavy metals in snia are thought to be known reasonably well from theoretical models while those from snii are uncertain because of complexities in the pre - explosion evolution , uncertain reaction rates , and the unknown amount of processed material that falls back on the stellar remnant ( woosley & weaver 1995 ; gibson , loewenstein & mushotzky 1997 ) .    in view of these difficulties , the relative influence of snii and snia in enriching elliptical galaxies and rich clusters",
    "must be determined largely from observations of the metal abundance in stars and gas .",
    "the enrichment history of individual ellipticals and associated groups of galaxies is difficult to access since the total energy released in all snii is sufficient to expel a significant fraction of metal - rich gas from these systems .",
    "however , rich clusters of galaxies are massive enough to have retained all of the material processed in supernovae over cosmic time .",
    "the `` closed box '' nature of rich clusters is supported by the relative constancy of the ratio of baryonic to total mass for cluster masses @xmath17 @xmath18 ( david 1997 ) .",
    "the data assembled by renzini ( 1997 ) indicates that metal enrichment by supernovae in rich clusters remains confined within the cluster potential ; @xmath19 and the total iron mass per unit optical light @xmath20 are nearly constant for cluster masses @xmath17 @xmath18 .",
    "clusters and galaxy groups with masses less than this have lower gas to stellar mass ratios , suggesting gaseous outflow .    in determining the past history of supernova enrichment ,",
    "the silicon abundance is more useful than the iron abundance .",
    "the silicon abundance has been observed in the icm of many rich clusters and is based on a well - understood k - line emission feature so that translation into abundances should be reliable .",
    "in addition , silicon yields from snii and possibly snia may be better determined from theoretical supernova models than those of iron .",
    "while the iron yield from snii @xmath21 increases monotonically with the pre - supernova stellar mass @xmath22 , the silicon yield @xmath23 has a pronounced maximum at @xmath24 @xmath18 provided the energy released by the supernova is not too large ( a and b models of woosley & weaver 1995 ) . because of this maximum , the imf - averaged yield @xmath25 is very insensitive to the choice of parameters for power law imfs provided the upper mass limit @xmath26 .    assuming that silicon is a reliable tracer of past supernova activity in rich clusters , we wish to construct an expression for the observed ratio of the total mass of silicon in the hot cluster gas ( icm ) to the total optical luminosity of spheroidal system stars in the cluster , @xmath27 the present mass of silicon in the icm is determined by the total mass of silicon produced by snii and snia",
    "less the amount of silicon currently within stars : @xmath28 another important observed quantity is the currently observed silicon to iron ratio in the icm , @xmath29 note that @xmath30 is the ratio of silicon to iron masses in absolute units and is not normalized with the solar ratio .",
    "we now seek expressions for @xmath31 and @xmath30 in terms of the expected number of supernovae and the average silicon and iron yields for each supernova event .",
    "if we assume that all stars more massive than 8 @xmath18 produce snii , the number of snii per @xmath18 of stars formed , @xmath32 , can be found for any assumed imf . for a power law",
    "imf @xmath33 the number of snii is equal to the total number of stars more massive than @xmath34 @xmath18 , therefore @xmath35 for example , @xmath36 snii per @xmath18 for a salpeter imf ( slope @xmath37 ) having upper and lower masses of @xmath38 @xmath18 and @xmath39 @xmath18 respectively . in recent discussions of the metal enrichment of early type galaxies and galaxy clusters",
    "it has been fashionable to consider only single power law imfs ( e.g. loewenstein & mushotzky 1996 ; ishimaru & arimoto 1997 ; gibson , loewenstein & mushotzky 1997 ) with the salpeter slope regarded as `` normal . '' however , many lines of evidence in our own galaxy suggest that the normal imf has some curvature , becoming flatter at subsolar masses ( leitherer 1998 ) .",
    "scalo ( 1998 ) suggests the following triple power law approximation for a universal imf : @xmath40 with @xmath41 evaluating the specific snii frequency for this imf we find @xmath42 which differs by less than 15 percent from the single - slope salpeter value . in view of the many larger uncertainties involved in other parameters",
    ", we shall continue to use simple power law imfs in this paper to determine the number of snii , mean type ii supernova yields and the stellar mass loss rate .",
    "the total number of snii explosions during the entire history of rich cluster stars is @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the total initial stellar mass in cluster e + s0 galaxies .",
    "the current mass of all early type galaxies in a rich cluster can be estimated from the total b - band luminosity of all cluster galaxies , @xmath45 , where @xmath46 is an average mass to light ratio for bright cluster ellipticals .",
    "assuming that star formation in ellipticals can be approximated with a single burst at time @xmath0 , the stellar mass at that time was @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the fraction of the initial mass that has been lost from the stars between @xmath0 and the present time @xmath49 .",
    "for example , if stars form with a salpeter imf at time @xmath50 gyrs and @xmath51 gyrs is the present time , then @xmath52 .    since galactic stars in rich clusters",
    "are observed to be enriched by snii ejecta , it is clear that the single burst approximation is only an approximation .",
    "however , if most of the stars are formed in several bursts concentrated near time @xmath0 , the long term stellar evolution will be little altered although the single - burst value of @xmath48 will be overestimated if some supernova - processed gas is formed into stars in nearly simultaneous multi - bursts .",
    "if a fraction @xmath53 of snii - produced metals formed into stars at time @xmath0 , then a fraction @xmath54 is still locked in stars today .",
    "the total mass of snii - produced silicon still remaining in the intracluster gas phase today is therefore @xmath55 where the mean silicon yield @xmath25 is the imf - averaged mass of silicon ( in solar masses ) generated per snii event .",
    "the total mass of iron in the icm from snii is given by the same expression with @xmath25 replaced with @xmath56 . by using the single burst assumption , modified by allowing some of the snii ejecta to form stars",
    ", we are neglecting higher order details such as second generation snii formed from stellar ejecta .",
    "the total amount of silicon produced in snia is the product of the total number of type ia supernovae and the silicon yield , @xmath57 .",
    "since the past rate of snia explosions in ellipticals is poorly known , we represent our ignorance with a power law : @xmath58 where @xmath15 is in units of @xmath59 and @xmath60 is the snia rate in snu units ( supernovae per @xmath61 per 100 years ) . the total number of snia since @xmath0 is therefore @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the number of snia per unit @xmath64 .",
    "the important parameter that governs the snia contribution to the observed ratios @xmath30 and @xmath31 is @xmath63 although we shall occasionally use the current snia rate snu@xmath65 to characterize @xmath63 , assuming particular values of @xmath66 and @xmath0 .",
    "if a fraction @xmath67 of the enriched snia ejecta was incorporated into stars at time @xmath0 , then a fraction @xmath68 remains in stars at the present time .",
    "finally , the current stellar iron abundance is given by @xmath69 where @xmath70 is the abundance of iron by mass in stars relative to hydrogen and @xmath71 is the ratio of iron mass to total mass including helium .",
    "following the notation introduced above , equations ( 1 ) - ( 3 ) can be written as @xmath72 @xmath73 and @xmath74.\\ ] ] if snia do not contribute to the enrichment of the stars , then the ratio of stellar silicon and iron must be in proportion to snii yields , @xmath75 ; equation ( 6 ) reduces to this simple expression when @xmath76 or @xmath77 . with the total number of snia regarded as a parameter",
    ", we shall solve the three equations above for the most uncertain remaining parameters : the specific number of snii , @xmath32 , the mean iron yield from snii @xmath56 , and the fraction @xmath53 of snii ejecta that has formed into stars .",
    "values for the many additional parameters in the last three equations must be determined from theoretical supernova calculations or from observation .",
    "imf - averaged theoretical supernova yields for iron and silicon have been collected and discussed by loewenstein & mushotzky ( 1996 ) and gibson , loewenstein & mushotzky ( 1997 ) . following these authors we take snia silicon and iron yields from model w7 of thielemann , nomoto & hashimoto ( 1993 ) : @xmath78 and @xmath79 , both in @xmath18 .",
    "yields for snii collected by loewenstein & mushotzky ( 1996 ) , mostly based on woosley & weaver ( 1995 ) , have a large range for different models : @xmath80 and @xmath81 while yields for the less extreme snii models discussed by gibson , loewenstein & mushotzky ( 1997 ) have a more limited range : @xmath82 and @xmath83 both evaluated with a salpeter imf .",
    "gibson , loewenstein & mushotzky ( 1997 ) discuss the uncertainties in theoretical snii yields in detail . as discussed previously ,",
    "because of the maximum in the silicon yield near progenitor mass @xmath84 @xmath18 , the mean silicon yield @xmath85 @xmath18 appears to be more securely known than @xmath56 which we regard as an unknown to be determined by solving the equations above .",
    "the stellar mass to light ratio in early type galaxies is a slowly increasing function of galactic luminosity , @xmath86 ( faber et al .",
    "1984 ) , and depends somewhat on the cluster luminosity function .",
    "for a representative value we choose @xmath87 ( in solar units ) , characteristic of typical bright ellipticals .",

    "more extensive observational data indicates that there is a significant cosmic variation in the abundances of si and fe among rich clusters ( mushotzky & loewenstein 1997 ; mushotzky 1998 ) .",
    "if real , this variation of galaxy - averaged values suggests that the imf , star formation efficiency , supernova frequency or other supernova properties may vary dramatically among cluster galaxies .",
    "nevertheless , for our purposes here we simply use average abundances from all of the clusters observed .",
    "asca observations indicate a silicon to iron ratio of si / fe = @xmath89 ( mushotzky 1998 ) in solar units . but this abundance ratio , based on the so - called `` photospheric '' solar iron abundance , becomes si / fe @xmath90 in units of the `` meteoritic '' solar ratio ( si / fe)@xmath91 adopted here .",
    "the corresponding absolute si / fe abundance ratio in equation ( 5 ) is therefore @xmath92    solutions of equations ( 4 ) - ( 6 ) for @xmath32 , @xmath56 , and @xmath53 are shown in figure 1 as functions of the total number of snia events @xmath93 and the current type ia supernova rate snu@xmath65 evaluated with @xmath94 , @xmath51 gyrs , and @xmath50 gyrs .",

    "these authors prefer models in which the overabundance of iron relative to that expected with a normal salpeter imf is due to a large additional iron contribution from type ia supernovae , corresponding to @xmath123 in figure 1",

    "possible inadequacies in treating the fe l transitions in the adopted plasma code may also influence the resulting value for the observed iron abundance .",

    "these latter values are slightly higher than the global iron and silicon abundances reported by matsushita ( 1997 ) ; this excess probably arises because the gas density in our models is slightly larger and more centrally peaked than that observed in ngc 4472 ( figure 3 ) .",
    "the approximate constancy of @xmath211 with galactic radius and its value intermediate between snii and snia yields ( @xmath212 and @xmath213 respectively ) are both attributes of recent x - ray observations of ngc 5846 by finoguenov et al ( 1998 ) .    for any given gas dynamical solution described by @xmath1 and @xmath2 at time @xmath49 ,",
    "an infinite family of interstellar abundance distributions can be generated by changing the specific number of snii @xmath32 ( or the supernova yields ) while keeping the total snii energy @xmath150 unchanged .",
    "the constancy of @xmath3 is ensured by varying the gas heating efficiency factors @xmath153 or @xmath214 to compensate for changes in @xmath32 . when following this procedure , we were surprised to discover that the iron abundance distribution shown in figure 4 disagrees significantly with matsushita s observations when @xmath32 is only varied by @xmath215 percent from that used in the standard solution .",
    "for example , if @xmath216 the iron abundance in the plateau region ( 100 - 400 kpc ) increases to @xmath217 and the central value is nearly 1.1 .",
    "these iron abundances are significantly higher than matsushita s observed values , particularly in the outer galaxy @xmath218 kpc .",

    "the global iron abundance in the gas just after snii enrichment , identical to that in the plateau region , is @xmath220 where @xmath221 is the total iron produced by snii .",
    "since the large total mass of iron in stars @xmath222 is held fixed as @xmath32 is varied to create a family of dynamically identical enrichment models , small changes in @xmath32 and therefore @xmath221 correspond to rather large changes if @xmath200 since @xmath221 is not much larger than @xmath222 . in this sense",
    "our models require a high degree of regularity in @xmath32 in order to match the negative gaseous iron abundance gradients typically observed in giant ellipticals .",

    "although our standard model , as illustrated in figures 3 and 4 , is successful in approximately reproducing all relevant observations of ngc 4472 , the value of @xmath32 that we have used corresponds to a normal salpeter imf and is therefore several times less than values required to enrich massive clusters of galaxies ( equation 8) . in spite of this important difference in @xmath32 , the gaseous iron and silicon abundances in our standard model within the current accretion shock radius @xmath204 kpc , @xmath223 and @xmath224 , are both rather similar to typical abundances in the icm of rich clusters , @xmath225 solar .",
    "the ratio of total iron mass in both stars and gas to the total baryonic mass within @xmath226 corresponds to an iron abundance of @xmath225 in solar units , again very similar to cluster values .",
    "this apparent agreement is likely to be just a coincidence , however .",
    "the important distinction between our model for ngc 4472 based on a salpeter @xmath32 and higher values of @xmath32 required to understand cluster icm abundances is in the much lower total gas mass fraction currently present in galaxies as compared to clusters . within any radius of interest out to the current accretion shock radius , the ratio of gas mass to total baryonic mass in our standard model is much lower than that found in rich clusters .",
    "if the icm in rich clusters contains additional , unenriched primeval gas at larger radii , the enrichment of cluster gas by ellipticals similar to our model for ngc 4472 is even more dramatically inadequate .",
    "therefore , our models support the contention made by renzini ( 1997 ) and david ( 1997 ) that it is impossible to build presently observed rich clusters by merging hot gas in group - dominant massive ellipticals having properties similar to our standard solution for ngc 4472 .",
    "we have made additional calculations using standard model parameters but assuming that the snii energy and enrichment occur within radii that are not equal to @xmath143 .",
    "when the enrichment region is smaller than @xmath143 , the plateau region is smaller but its iron abundance is increased so that it is no longer possible to match the current negative iron abundance gradients observed in ngc 4472 and other similar massive ellipticals . to correct for this excess iron ,",
    "the value of @xmath32 would need to be less than @xmath227 , diverging further from typical cluster values .",

    "for example , stars that form at @xmath0 beyond @xmath229 kpc in the standard solution can never enter the stellar part of the galaxy ( @xmath203 kpc ) by the present time @xmath51 gyrs ; any snii enrichment beyond this radius is unrelated to stars within ngc 4472 . in any case , even if we use a snii energy and enrichment radius equal to the maximum allowed size at @xmath0 , @xmath230 kpc , the current abundances of iron and silicon are still too large if the cluster value of @xmath32 is used .      to emphasize the disparity between optimum values for the specific number of snii in rich clusters and in single bright ellipticals ,",
    "we briefly discuss a `` cluster '' model for ngc 4472 in which @xmath32 has a larger value appropriate for rich clusters .",

    "all remaining variables and the gas dynamical solution are identical to those in the standard model previously discussed .",
    "larger @xmath32 corresponds to a lower heating efficiency @xmath153 , keeping @xmath3 and the associated gas dynamics unchanged from the standard solution .    after evolving to the current time ,",
    "the iron and silicon distributions in this model , shown in figure 6 , are clearly unable to account for gas abundances observed in ngc 4472 .",
    "iron and silicon within the galaxy are dominated by the inflow of snii - enriched gas from outside the stellar system .",
    "the total iron abundance within the optical galaxy ( @xmath203 kpc ) is much higher than observed abundances and its radial gradient is positive throughout the galaxy .",
    "this model is an example of the sensitivity of @xmath137 to the parameter @xmath32 .",
    "increasing @xmath32 by a factor of 2.36 causes the gas abundance in the plateau region to increase to 3.35 , almost 22 times greater than the abundance in this region in the standard solution . as before most of the iron mass in the gas",
    "is contained in this distant plateau region ( see figure 5 ) .",
    "we explored several variants of the `` cluster '' model in an attempt to reconcile cluster values of @xmath32 and the enrichment history of large ellipticals .",
    "the high abundances in the `` plateau '' region just beyond 100 kpc can be reduced if the radius of snii enrichment at time @xmath0 is increased or if this gas is ( rather arbitrarily ) mixed and diluted with primordial gas at larger radii . however , as discussed above , such models are unrealistic since the dynamical times at @xmath230 kpc for either of these variant models is too long .",
    "low mass stars accompanying metal - producing snii at these radii will not have joined the galaxy by the present time .",
    "we have also sought solutions in which the galaxy formation time @xmath0 is 3 or 4 gyrs in an attempt to lower the abundances by mixing snii ejecta with larger masses of unprocessed gas inside the accretion shock at these later times , but unrealistically high iron abundances are still present .",
    "we are faced with the unexpected result that the amount of metals required to fit abundances in rich clusters are incompatible with those observed in individual ellipticals .",
    "this is very curious since bulge dominated e and s0 galaxies are generally thought to be the primary source of metals in the icm of rich clusters .",
    "we now explore the possibility that snia are important contributors to the iron abundance in rich clusters and that bulge dominated galaxies are the primary sites of these snia explosions .",
    "this can be accomplished with the `` ia '' model for ngc4472 for which @xmath233 , corresponding to @xmath234 and @xmath235 in figure 1 . to achieve this high snia rate we choose @xmath236 and @xmath237 ; this is the same slope as that of ciotti et al .",
    "( 1991 ) , but our @xmath238 is only 70% of their value .",
    "all other parameters are identical to those in the standard model .",
    "since the energy deposited by snia in this model exceeds that of the standard model , the hydrodynamic solution is also different .",
    "the gas density and temperature for this model after time @xmath51 gyrs are shown with dashed lines in figure 3 .",
    "the agreement with the observed gas density in ngc 4472 is good , but the gas temperature has a minimum near 60 kpc that is not observed .",
    "this curious feature is a long - lived relic resulting from gas flows driven by snia and snii heating at times just after time @xmath0 . in",
    "earlier theoretical models for the evolution of hot gas in ellipticals in which stars are assumed to be the only source of interstellar gas , such a large energy deposition by snia would have driven a strong galactic wind .",
    "for the model we discuss here , where the young galaxy is surrounded by cosmic gas converging toward the overdensity perturbation ( secondary infall ) , early snia - driven winds are suppressed by the inertia of this ambient gas and only a modest outward redistribution of the gas occurs .    apart from the small temperature minimum in figure 3 , the general trend in the gas temperature for this model is a reasonably good fit to gas temperatures observed in ngc 4472 .",
    "however , the current iron and silicon abundances in the hot gas for this model , illustrated in figure 7 , are clearly at variance with x - ray observations . in this snia - dominant model the interstellar enrichment of iron and silicon",
    "is caused almost exclusively by snia , raising the iron abundance to @xmath239 times solar throughout the optical galaxy .",
    "the shallow positive gradient @xmath240 for @xmath203 kpc is due to a small residual gaseous outflow caused by the large energy released by snia inside the galaxy .",
    "the global value of the iron abundance and its radial gradient are both too large .",
    "this model is rather similar to the earlier result of loewenstein & mathews ( 1991 ) in their study of simpler galactic cooling flows without cosmological secondary infall ; they also found iron abundances far in excess of those observed when snia are important contributors to the overall galactic enrichment .",
    "it is also significant that the silicon abundance in this model is much higher than the global value observed in the hot interstellar gas of ngc 4472 , @xmath241 solar .",
    "most of the excess iron and silicon inside the galaxy in this model comes from type ia supernovae with a smaller contribution from stellar mass loss . because of the low - level , subsonic outflow driven by snia , iron and silicon introduced into the gas by snii at @xmath0 are unable to enter the interstellar gas interior to @xmath242 kpc .",
    "we have also explored additional high @xmath63 models in which the snia varies like a step function rather than a power law . by concentrating most of the snia energy at early times",
    ", we hoped that the large amount of metals produced then would be expelled in a powerful galactic wind .",
    "if so , the low gas abundances observed today within @xmath242 kpc might be made consistent with large snia enrichment at early times .",
    "for example , we considered a model with @xmath243 , with most of the snia exploding at very early times : snu = 24.86 for @xmath244 gyr , and snu = 0.03 for @xmath245 gyr . however , with this sort of model the gas dynamics were altered so that we were unable to match @xmath1 and @xmath2 currently observed in ngc 4472 . the iron and silicon abundance distribution are also strange in these models at the present time , with an enormous metal enrichment occurring just outside of the stellar part of the galaxy .",
    "when we began this study of the enrichment history of massive ellipticals and rich clusters , we quite mistakenly anticipated that it would be possible to find a common set of parameters that would account for evolutionary enrichment on both galactic and cluster scales .",
    "gas phase iron abundances in bright ellipticals range from @xmath246 solar , with ngc 4472 lying near the upper limit of this range , but the average may not differ greatly from the mean global iron abundance in rich clusters , @xmath225 .",
    "rich clusters typically have higher gas fractions than massive ellipticals , but this might result in part from supernova - driven outflows from the shallower potentials of member ellipticals . unlike the observational information available for hot gas in group - dominant ellipticals , our computational models are closed boxes since we can computationally follow gas - phase supernova enrichment products into regions of very low gas density and emissivity where observations are difficult or impossible .",
    "perhaps , we supposed , the large number of past supernovae required to produce metal abundances in rich clusters were at one time also present in giant ellipticals but some of these metals was dispersed by galactic winds into the low density environment , escaping observational detection . if all of this were true , it might be possible to merge small elliptical - dominated groups together with their wind - enriched gaseous environments and construct rich clusters . in developing this hypothesis , we adopted the commonly held assumption that virtually all metal enrichment in rich clusters is due to the stellar spheroidal component , i.e. in e and s0 member galaxies .",
    "as discussed in our recent paper ( brighenti & mathews 1998b ) , the observed hot gas density and temperature distributions in any massive elliptical can be fit with a range of gas dynamical models having different numbers of type ii supernovae @xmath247 , represented here by the snii number per unit stellar mass , @xmath248 , or the total energy released by all snii , @xmath150 . for a given set of cosmological parameters , hydrodynamical models for",
    "the evolution of hot interstellar gas are degenerate in the sense that a range of values of @xmath32 ( associated with different imfs ) and therefore @xmath3 can produce similar interstellar density and temperature distributions at the present time provided the time of galaxy formation @xmath0 is also adjusted . if the galaxy is assumed to form at a later time , more gas is available near the central overdense region and a larger value of @xmath3 generates approximately the same specific thermal energy ; the subsequent evolution of the gas arrives at similar @xmath1 and @xmath2 distributions at the present time .",
    "this approximate degeneracy depends only weakly on our assumption that the snii energy is deposited within the accretion shock radius at time @xmath0 , @xmath143 . as we have discussed already , the extent of the snii enrichment region @xmath249 in massive ellipticals can not be greatly different from @xmath143 . if @xmath250 , then even lower values of @xmath32 are required to reproduce abundances observed today , increasing the disagreement with the higher cluster values for @xmath32 . if @xmath251 , then the dynamical time also increases and low mass stars associated with the snii enrichment would not have enough time to enter the massive optical galaxy observed today .",
    "the important parameters that describe our evolutionary models are ( i ) the total energy released by type ii supernovae , @xmath150 which must be adjusted to achieve agreement with @xmath1 and @xmath2 in the hot interstellar gas , ( ii ) @xmath0 the time of star formation , ( iii ) @xmath32 which controls most of the gas enrichment , and ( iv ) the snia rate snu@xmath128 that supplies much of the interstellar iron in the central galaxy , @xmath252 kpc . in seeking satisfactory gas dynamical models with no attention to abundances , the main parameters are @xmath3 and @xmath0 .",
    "we have found that models for the large elliptical ngc 4472 agree with @xmath1 and @xmath2 _ and _ the abundance distribution @xmath137 if stars form at @xmath50 gyrs with a salpeter imf for which @xmath253 assuming a heating efficiency @xmath158 .",
    "if we wish to increase @xmath32 and therefore @xmath3 toward the global values indicated by rich cluster abundances , @xmath254 , @xmath0 must be increased significantly .",
    "however , such an increased @xmath0 is not possible since observations indicate that many luminous elliptical galaxies are very old : the color - magnitude diagram ( bower , lucey , & ellis 1992 ) , the small scatter in the mg@xmath255 relation ( bender , burstein , & faber 1993 ) , passive evolution of the fundamental plane ( van dokkum & franx 1996 ) , etc . with @xmath0 constrained to values @xmath256 gyrs , and @xmath3 constrained for a match currently observed @xmath1 and @xmath2 distributions",
    ", @xmath32 can be increased toward the cluster value ( @xmath257 ) only by decreasing the gas heating efficiency @xmath153 with @xmath3 and @xmath0 held fixed .",
    "this is the procedure we have considered with the `` cluster '' or high-@xmath32 model for ngc 4472 .",
    "however , as @xmath32 is increased above the standard salpeter value , the metal enrichment of the interstellar gas at the present time quickly rises far above abundances observed in ngc 4472 .",
    "the global iron and silicon abundances and the negative radial iron gradient @xmath258 in ngc 4472 ( and other large ellipticals ) can be matched only with a very narrow range of @xmath32 , all lower than cluster values .",
    "similar restrictions also apply to the total number of type ia supernovae which we assume are also more frequent in the early universe .",
    "we arrive at the following conclusions :    \\(1 ) type ii supernova production with a salpeter imf is sufficient to explain all important hot gas observations in bright ellipticals : the radial distribution of density , temperature and iron abundance as well as the global iron and silicon abundances . a small additional contribution of iron and silicon from type ia supernovae , consistent with currently observed snia rates in elliptical galaxies , can also be present . unlike the enrichment history of our galaxy , where iron production by type ii and type ia supernovae have been comparable , in ellipticals the total iron and silicon enrichment by type ia supernovae must be much less than that from snii .",
    "\\(2 ) the gas dynamic and enrichment history of massive ellipticals establishes upper limits on the total number of both type ii and type ia supernovae events .",
    "large numbers of type ii supernovae associated for example with flat imfs , often invoked to account for the iron observed in rich clusters , produce too much gas - phase iron and silicon in models of single massive ellipticals . if the total number of type ia supernovae is large enough to dynamically influence the interstellar gas in these galaxy models , the current metal enrichment greatly exceeds the gas phase iron and silicon abundances observed .",
    "\\(3 ) for fixed total snii energy @xmath3 , the iron and silicon enrichment is very sensitive to the specific number of type ii supernovae @xmath32 involved .",
    "this sensitivity may indicate that our galaxy enrichment model is oversimplified or it may be related to the wide spread in gas phase abundances observed in ellipticals and group - dominant ellipticals ( see fig .",
    "6 of renzini 1997 ) .",
    "\\(4 ) we agree with david ( 1997 ) and renzini ( 1997 ) that it is not possible to form presently observed rich clusters by simply combining stars and hot gas from a large number of presently observed elliptical - dominated groups .",
    "\\(5 ) in view of our model calculations for the evolution and enrichment of interstellar gas in massive ellipticals , _ neither _ of the currently - discussed explanations of cluster metal abundances is particularly attractive : ( i ) imfs flatter than salpeter , and ( ii ) substantial iron enrichment from type ia supernovae , as in our galaxy .",
    "these conclusions could be changed if some of the theoretical and observational parameters we have used are in error by large amounts  for example if observed metal abundances in the hot interstellar gas of ellipticals are underestimated by factors of 5 or more  but this seems unlikely .    alternatively , the different enrichment histories of large ellipticals and rich clusters could be reconciled if the cluster gas is enriched by another source not involving massive elliptical galaxies .",
    "arnaud et al .",
    "( 1992 ) show that the total mass of hot gas in clusters correlates nicely with the total optical luminosity of e and s0 galaxies within 3 mpc of the cluster centers , but there is no similar correlation with the total luminosity of the spiral galaxy component . since global gas phase",
    "iron abundances are fairly constant among clusters , a correlation with gas mass is also a correlation with the total mass of iron , most of which is in the gas phase .",
    "arnaud et al .",
    "( 1992 ) therefore concluded that e and s0 galaxies are the only significant sources of metal enrichment in the hot cluster gas .",
    "however , cluster enrichment may be more complicated than this",
    ". for example , the role of disk galaxies in icm enrichment may be more important than is currently thought .",
    "most low redshift rich clusters contain about twice as many s0 galaxies as ellipticals ( dressler 1980 ) .",
    "the fractions of s0 and spiral galaxies in clusters are inversely related while the ratio of the number of s0 plus spiral galaxies to the number of ellipticals is rather constant .",
    "this suggests that s0 galaxies may be descended from spirals .",
    "this is supported by the observation that richer clusters tend to have higher s0/spiral ratios .",
    "even more relevant , cluster observations at @xmath259 reported by dressler et al .",
    "( 1997 ) show that the fractional content of ellipticals is similar to nearby clusters but the s0/spiral ratio is very much lower .",
    "this can be naturally explained if s0 galaxies in rich clusters were spirals in their previous lives before interacting with other cluster galaxies and the icm .",
    "when stripped of their interstellar gas by the icm , s0 galaxies could have enriched the icm , perhaps with a strong snia abundance signature . if the icm enrichment were due solely to this process , however , the iron abundance in the icm should decrease systematically with redshift .",
    "mushotzky & loewenstein ( 1997 ) find no significant change in the global iron abundance in clusters out to redshifts @xmath260 , although there is considerable real scatter in the data that may have masked such a trend .",
    "while the transition of spirals into s0 galaxies is appealing as a possible explanation for the large specific supernova rates in clusters , morphological classification at large redshift is a difficult art and subject to error . in similar studies of distant clusters stanford et al .",
    "( 1997 ) and andreon ( 1998 ) find no depletion of s0 galaxies at high redshift .",
    "another less conventional cluster enrichment possibility is that some of the cluster gas metals has come from outflows from dwarf galaxies .",
    "at least one author ( trentham 1994 ) has claimed that dwarf galaxies can supply all of the gas and metal enrichment observed in rich clusters . while few would agree with this extreme hypothesis , some fractional contribution from dwarf galaxies to the icm enrichment",
    "can not be entirely dismissed .",
    "> from studies of intergalactic absorption lines in quasar spectra , cowie & songaila ( 1998 ) and lu et al . (",
    "1998 ) find evidence of an average carbon enrichment of @xmath261 solar in the intergalactic medium at high redshifts @xmath262 , even in low density voids .",
    "although this value is 100 times lower than abundances in rich clusters , it does suggest the presence of an alternative source of metal enrichment .",
    "according to cowie & songaila , `` early generations of small galaxies might be much more efficient at ejecting heavy elements ... than has previously been thought . ''",
    "maintain that the variation of the carbon abundance with column ( and physical ) density in l@xmath263 clouds rules out the possibility of ( uniform ) metal contamination of the intergalactic medium by population iii objects .",
    "in another intriguing recent observation with asca , hattori , et al .",
    "( 1997 ) have discovered an x - ray cluster at a very high red shift @xmath264 having luminosity @xmath265 erg s@xmath168 .",
    "it is most remarkable that this cluster is optically dark .",
    "after several sensitive optical searches only the central cd galaxy has been found at this redshift .",
    "other cluster member galaxies of average luminosity , if present , should have been observed and were not .",
    "this cluster is similar in all respects to those at lower redshifts ( @xmath266 ) except that its mass to light ratio , @xmath267 , is about ten times that of less distant clusters .",
    "given the apparent absence of prominent cluster galaxies , it is most astonishing that the iron abundance in the hot cluster gas ( @xmath268 kev ) is @xmath269 in solar units .",
    "one possible interpretation would be that the cluster gas is enriched by a multitude of low mass galaxies which has escaped optical detection . if dwarf galaxies created some of the metals in rich clusters , it is likely that this happened at high redshifts to account for the relative constancy of the iron abundance found by mushotzky & loewenstein ( 1997 ) at red shifts @xmath270 .",
    "some of these alternative cluster enrichment hypotheses are subject to observational test .",
    "we have already mentioned that there is a small , but real , scatter in the global iron abundance in cluster gas ( mushotzky 1998 ) .",
    "since the s0/spiral ratio also varies among clusters , a weak positive correlation of this ratio with gas phase abundance excess would be expected if s0 stripping is an important contributor to cluster gas enrichment .",
    "abundance inhomogeneities in the hot cluster gas may provide another clue to the origin of cluster metals .",
    "if only a few bright e galaxies are responsible for most of the intracluster gas enrichment , significant abundance inhomogeneities and radial gradients would be expected due to the limited previous orbital experience of these galaxies .",
    "if the cluster gas was enriched by a larger number of dwarf galaxies ( most of which may no longer be visible ) , then abundance inhomogeneities will be much reduced .",
    "such studies may become possible as the spatial resolution of x - ray detectors improves .",
    "the possibility of galactic sources of cluster enrichment other than e and s0 galaxies has been considerably strengthened by recent asca observations of cluster iron and silicon abundances . in a study of 40 clusters fukazawa et al .",
    "( 1998 ) find that the icm silicon abundance increases with cluster richness as @xmath271 increases from @xmath7 kev to @xmath272 kev , but no appreciable change in the iron abundance is indicated over this range .",
    "the explanation for this behavior is unclear at present , but it very definitely requires at least two sources of icm enrichment , otherwise the iron to silicon ratio would be the same in all clusters . for this range of cluster gas temperatures , @xmath273 kev ,",
    "the constancy of global gas and iron masses relative to cluster @xmath15 suggests closed box environments ( renzini 1997 ) .",
    "however , the sense of the silicon enrichment is opposite to that expected if more spiral galaxies in richer clusters ( high @xmath271 ) convert to s0s .",
    "nevertheless , additional sources of cluster gas metals may provide the most satisfactory resolution of the inconsistent enrichment histories of massive ellipticals and rich clusters that we have demonstrated here .",

    "* appendix *    in this appendix we briefly discuss the evolution of hot gaseous halos in ngc 4472 in the context of two different cosmologies : an open universe with @xmath174 and a flat , low density universe with @xmath174 and @xmath175 .",
    "when @xmath274 the evolution of the dark matter can no longer be described by the self - similar solutions of bertschinger ( 1985 ) .",
    "instead , we adopt a simple top hat overdensity perturbation at some early time designed to concentrate the dark mass of ngc 4472 by the current time . the dark matter is followed as a separate zero pressure fluid which builds a stationary nfw core that grows with time , conserving total dark mass . for simplicity",
    "we assume the nfw profile for ngc 4472 is identical to that in the flat universe described in the main text .",
    "since all matter in an open universe is unbound , the initial perturbation must be large and non - linear in our simple model of galaxy formation . for the @xmath174 universe we introduced a top hat perturbation of overdensity @xmath275 with @xmath276 extending to @xmath277 kpc at time @xmath278 yrs .",
    "baryons with mass density @xmath164 also participate in this top hat perturbation and by time @xmath279 gyrs enough gas is concentrated to form the stars in ngc 4472 in the usual way described in the main text .",

    "we show with a solid line the gas density and temperature distributions after time @xmath51 gyrs . although the agreement is not perfect , it is adequate to illustrate that the global evolution of extended hot halos in ellipticals in an open universe is quite similar to the solution for the flat @xmath163 universe discussed in the main text .    at 13 gyrs",
    "the transition from the stationary nfw dark halo core to the secondary infall occurs at @xmath282 kpc , which is just beyond the outermost observations of the x - ray image of ngc 4472 .",
    "since the potential has a strong slope change at this radius , this feature at the outer dark core might be visible in the outer x - ray images of some massive ellipticals if the universe were open .",
    "for open universe parameters , @xmath0 can not be much larger than @xmath283 gyr otherwise too much cold gas gathers in the perturbation potential . in the open cosmology",
    "the total baryon fraction is higher at large radii @xmath284 , similar to rich clusters ; although the final gas density is necessarily similar to that in the flat universe solution , the dark matter fraction is lower .",
    "we also computed the radial iron and silicon abundances in the gas at time @xmath51 gyrs and find a general agreement with observed abundances , although the fit could be improved with a slightly lower @xmath32 .",
    "successful solutions for ngc 4472 in the context of an open universe are incompatible with large @xmath285 required for global cluster enrichment .",
    "galaxy evolution in this cosmology was initiated with a top hat perturbation of radius @xmath286 kpc and relative overdensity @xmath287 at time @xmath288 yrs . for the supernova rates we take @xmath289 and snu@xmath281 with @xmath94 .",
    "the stars in ngc 4472 are assumed to form at @xmath290 gyrs .",
    "after 13 gyrs the gas density and temperature profiles are shown with dashed lines in figure 8 .",
    "the gas density profile is slightly too peaked but is otherwise similar to the observed variation .",
    "the gas temperature exhibits a curious undulation near @xmath291 kpc that is not apparent in the observations .",
    "nevertheless , the computed temperature profile for this model agrees with observed temperatures far better than profiles computed without secondary infall ( see brighenti & mathews 1998b ) .    our purpose in illustrating these results with alternate cosmologies is not to achieve the best possible fits to the current density and temperature distributions by careful adjustment of the parameters .",
