    "only coefficients of powers of @xmath123 will be non - zero .",
    "hence , there are no solutions with @xmath124 and the only possibility is @xmath125 where @xmath119 has degree @xmath126 and the degree of @xmath121 is less or equal to @xmath122    consider the case @xmath95 which includes the @xmath127 case for @xmath115 set @xmath128 and @xmath129 then the rational map is given by @xmath130 the inversion symmetry ( [ constraint ] ) leads to the following two constraints on the coefficients @xmath131 and @xmath132 where @xmath133 takes account of the fact that numerator and denominator can be multiplied with a common factor . taking the modulus , we obtain that @xmath134 so that @xmath135 by relabelling @xmath136 equation ( [ c2 ] ) becomes @xmath137 this is compatible with equation ( [ c1 ] ) provided @xmath138 is odd . for @xmath139",
    "we obtain the map @xmath140 performing a mbius transformation in target space to remove the phase @xmath133 this is equivalent to a mbius transformation of the axial map .",
    "similarly , for @xmath141 the rational map ( [ ratsym1 ] ) reduces to @xmath142 since in this case @xmath143 and @xmath144 this is again the axial map .",

    "the surprising fact is that this map has @xmath1 symmetry , since it is also symmetric under @xmath170 hence , imposing a @xmath165 symmetry automatically gives a family of @xmath1 symmetric maps . since rotations and isorotations act independently and can not change the magnitude of the parameter @xmath171 the moduli space of the symmetric lumps of ( [ rc ] ) has real dimension @xmath172 another way of calculating the dimension of the family of symmetry orbits of ( [ rc ] ) is as follows .",
    "a general rational map can be written as equation ( [ degn ] ) for @xmath151 : @xmath173 when we impose symmetry under a @xmath174 rotation around the @xmath113-axes in space followed by an isorotation around the @xmath113-axis in target space , one zero has to be equal to zero and the other two map into each other under @xmath175 .",
    "the symmetric rational map is then given by @xmath176 hence , this rational map is parametrised by @xmath177 and @xmath178 that is by @xmath179 real parameters .",
    "a further @xmath11 real parameters correspond to our choice of axes on @xmath180    to list all families of degree @xmath179 rational maps on the projective plane , we can also use the riemann - hurwitz formula @xcite . for a degree",

    "thus , for @xmath151 , @xmath186 implies that there are two possibilities .",
    "the first possibility is @xmath187 which fixes @xmath188 using symmetry . hence , the first family is the symmetry orbit of rational maps @xmath189 which coincides with the family of maps ( [ rinf ] ) .",
    "the second possibility is @xmath190 for @xmath191 . choosing a critical point at @xmath192 with @xmath193 and then using mbius transformations",

    "rotations and isorotations act independently and can not change the magnitude of @xmath196 hence the space is @xmath0-dimensional .",
    "this is compatible with writing the rational map as equation ( [ deg3 ] ) .",
    "a useful angular integral of a degree @xmath2 rational map @xmath46 is given by @xmath197 it can be shown that @xmath198 @xcite .",
    "this quantity @xmath199 is invariant under rotations in space and rotations in target space .",

    "[ enrdsyrc ] , and for @xmath206 the rational map becomes @xmath207 for @xmath208 the angular integral @xmath199 again takes the value @xmath209 this can be understood as follows : since the @xmath1 symmetry fixes the three axes @xmath210 @xmath211 and @xmath212 we can permute the @xmath213 axes cyclically and obtain , after a suitable isorotation , another map of the form ( [ rc ] ) , but with a new value @xmath214 this relates @xmath215 to @xmath216 which is the axial map in disguise .",

    "hence , it is sufficient to consider the interval @xmath224 and its symmetry orbits in order to parametrise @xmath225     in ( [ cali ] ) as a function of @xmath156 and @xmath169 for @xmath226 and @xmath227 respectively.,scaledwidth=76.5% ]    in appendix [ appendix ] we have constructed the mbius transformations in space and target space that are needed to transform the rational map @xmath200 in ( [ rc ] ) into the rational map @xmath226 in ( [ ra ] ) for @xmath228 the key idea of the calculation is to first map the wronskians of @xmath226 and @xmath200 into each other .",

    "then @xmath338 this isometry removes @xmath339 and @xmath340 for @xmath341 from the general possible metric equation ( [ rcmetric ] ) because for @xmath337 , we have that @xmath342 the isometry ( [ sigmaeta ] ) also results in @xmath343 and @xmath344 .",

    "we examined this moduli space using two different approaches .",

    "the symmetry requirements for @xmath425 which from a geometric point of view mean that zeros and poles have to be opposite , greatly reduce the number of allowed cyclic symmetries @xmath90 compared to general rational maps .",
    "the allowed symmetries are given in lemma [ lem2 ] , and can be compared to lemma [ lem1 ] , which states a similar results for general rational maps @xcite .",
    "we then focused on the case @xmath426 imposing a @xmath165 symmetry automatically leads to a @xmath1 symmetric map , and a cyclic symmetry @xmath152 for @xmath427 results in an axially symmetric rational map with @xmath112 symmetry . on @xmath425",
    "the symmetry group @xmath18 of rotations and isorotations acts isometrically .",

    "hence , the moduli space of charge one lumps on the two - sphere is @xmath266-dimensional and provided the motivation for our work .",
    "the riemann - hurwitz formula also decomposes @xmath289 into a @xmath246-dimensional space of maps with two ramification points of index @xmath179 and a @xmath0-dimensional space with @xmath11 ramification points of index @xmath429 and we showed that these two points of view produce the same spaces .",
    "in fact , we constructed explicitly the mbius transformations in space and target space that are needed to relate the two @xmath0-dimensional spaces . in summary ,",
    "the moduli space of charge three lumps is a @xmath0-dimensional manifold which can be described as a family of symmetry orbits of @xmath1 symmetric maps @xmath200 in ( [ rc ] ) where @xmath215 denotes the axially symmetric map .",
    "care has to be taken to avoid overcounting since the @xmath430 action produces configurations that are related by @xmath1 symmetry .",
    "furthermore , as @xmath431 or @xmath432 two lumps become increasingly spiky and collapse , as two poles of @xmath200 cancel with two zeros .",
    "the symmetry requirement that poles and zeros have to be opposite results in a more complicated lump decay , and in particular , @xmath112 symmetry prevents lump decay .",
    "the dihedral symmetry of @xmath289 allowed us to find explicit expressions of the @xmath15 metric @xcite that is induced on the moduli space by the kinetic energy .",
    "it is rare that the moduli space metric can be evaluated for topological charge greater than one .",
    "recently , the metric of hyperbolic vortices of charge two has been calculated in ref .",
    "@xcite generalising the formula obtained in @xcite .",
    "we showed that the volume of @xmath289 is finite .",
    "furthermore , we constructed a geodesic that connects the axial map to the boundary of @xmath289 which has finite length .",
    "this shows that @xmath289 is geodesically incomplete , as shown in ref .",
    "we also evaluated the volume of the space of axially symmetric maps .    by imposing the cyclic symmetry @xmath90 for @xmath117 we identified some interesting @xmath0-dimensional submanifolds with dihedral symmetry",
    "@xmath433 which have the same structure as the moduli space of @xmath151 lumps .",
    "these spaces are very similar to the moduli spaces of vortex polygons in @xcite and to the cyclically symmetric scattering of monopoles in @xcite .",
    "it is possible to evaluate the metric of submanifolds with @xmath249 symmetry in a similar way to the metric of @xmath225 when @xmath242 the symmetry approach gives the following possible symmetries : @xmath434 @xmath435 @xmath436 @xmath437 @xmath1 and @xmath165 and no symmetry .",
    "the riemann - hurwitz formula provides an alternative decomposition into @xmath246 different spaces , but now there is no obvious correspondence between the two approaches apart from the axially symmetric case .",

    "in this appendix , we show in detail how to transform the rational map @xmath439 in ( [ rc ] ) into @xmath438 in ( [ ra ] ) by constructing the relevant mbius transformations in space and target space .",
    "thereby , we prove explicitly that these two maps are in the same orbit of the symmetry group , and hence both generate the moduli space @xmath225 as a starting point , we calculate the zeros of @xmath440 that is the zeros of the wronskian @xmath441 where @xmath442 these zeros are invariant under rotations in target space . for @xmath443",
    "the zeros of the wronskian @xmath444 are at @xmath282 @xmath235 and @xmath445 note that as @xmath156 is increased from @xmath234 to @xmath235 , the zero @xmath446 moves along the positive real axis from @xmath234 to @xmath235 whereas the zero @xmath447 moves along the negative real axis from @xmath448 to @xmath236    before calculating the wronskian @xmath449 for @xmath227 it is convenient to make a change of variables . for @xmath450 we define @xmath451 which is a monotonously decreasing function of @xmath171 taking values in @xmath452 hence this map is a bijection between @xmath453 and @xmath454 and has the inverse @xmath455",
    "then the zeros of @xmath449 are given in term of @xmath456 by @xmath457 since @xmath458 the zeros ( [ zerosc ] ) are purely imaginary . for @xmath459 the zeros @xmath460 and @xmath461 tend to @xmath282 whereas the zeros @xmath462 and @xmath463 tend to @xmath464 hence , as @xmath465 the corresponding rational map tends to the axial map .",
    "we now move the zero @xmath460 to @xmath234 via the mbius transformation @xmath466 which corresponds to a rotation around the @xmath467 axis in space .",

    "hence , we rotate by @xmath468 around the @xmath113 axis , @xmath469 which leaves the zeros of the wronskian at @xmath234 and @xmath235 fixed but moves the remaining to zeros @xmath470 onto the real axis . the equation for the zeros of the corresponding wronskian can be simplified to @xmath471 which has zeros at @xmath282 @xmath235 and @xmath472 note that @xmath473 travels along the real axis from @xmath234 to @xmath235 as @xmath456 decreases . by equating the two positive roots @xmath473 and",
    "@xmath446 we can express @xmath156 in terms of @xmath456 as @xmath474 or alternatively , @xmath475 this relates the parameters @xmath156 and @xmath169 of the rational map , and as expected , @xmath156 moves along the real axis from @xmath234 to @xmath235 as @xmath169 increase from @xmath234 to @xmath295 ( or @xmath456 decreases from @xmath235 to @xmath295 ) .    in order to relate the rational maps @xmath476 and @xmath438",
    "we need to perform a mbius transformation in target space .",
    "we do this again in two steps .",
    "it can be shown that @xmath477 is purely imaginary .",
    "therefore , the mbius transformation @xmath478 given by @xmath479 is a rotation around the @xmath467 axis in target space which sets the image of the critical point at @xmath192 to @xmath282 namely @xmath480 however , now the value of this map is purely imaginary for @xmath221 and real @xmath481 so , we need the further mbius transformation @xmath482 given by @xmath483 which is a @xmath468 rotation around the @xmath113 axis in target space .",
