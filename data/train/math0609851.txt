    "the ( logarithmic ) mahler measure of a laurent polynomial @xmath0 $ ] is defined by @xmath1    because of jensen s formula , there is a simple expression for the mahler measure in the one - variable case , as a function on the roots of the polynomial .",
    "it is natural then , to wonder what happens with several variables .",
    "the problem of finding explicit closed formulas for mahler measures of several variable polynomials is hard .",
    "however , several examples have been found , especially for two and three variables .",
    "some formulas have been completely proved and some others have been established numerically and are strongly believed to be true .",
    "a remarkable fact is that in most of these examples the mahler measure of polynomials with integral coefficients can be expressed in terms of special values of l - series or polylogarithms ( that is to say , riemann zeta - functions , dirichlet l - series , l - series of varieties , zeta functions of number fields , etcetera ) .",
    "for instance , the first and simplest example in two variables was discovered by smyth @xcite : @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the character of conductor 3 .",
    "another example was computed numerically by boyd @xcite ( and studied by deninger @xcite and rodriguez - villegas @xcite ) , @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the elliptic curve of conductor 15 which is the projective closure of the curve @xmath6 and @xmath7 is the l - function of @xmath5 .",
    "deninger @xcite interpreted computations of mahler measure in terms of deligne periods of mixed motives explaining some of the relations to the l - series via beilinson s conjectures .",
    "rodriguez - villegas @xcite has clarified this relationship by explicitly computing the regulator , and relating this machinery to the cases already ( numerically ) known by boyd , proving some of them , and deeply understanding the cases with two variables .",
    "recently maillot has sketched how one could continue these ideas for more variables .",
    "it is our goal to develop these ideas and to apply them in order to understand the few known examples with three and more variables involving dirichlet l - series , riemann zeta functions and polylogarithms . in this work",
    "we describe a general situation and illustrate our explanation with a few examples . in @xcite",
    "we will show the computational power of our method by showing how to prove many other formulas of mahler measures and generalized mahler measures as well .",
    "in this section we describe some ingredients that will be used in our construction .",
    "the cases that we are going to study involve zeta functions or dirichlet l - series , but they all may be thought as special values of polylogarithms .",
    "in fact , this common feature seems to be the most appropriate way of dealing with the interpretation of these formulas .",
    "here we proceed to recall some definitions and establish some common notation .",
    "the @xmath8th polylogarithm is the function defined by the power series @xmath9    this function can be continued analytically to @xmath10",
    ". we will work with zagier s modification of the polylogarithm ( @xcite ) : @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the @xmath13th bernoulli number and @xmath14 denotes @xmath15 or @xmath16 depending on whether @xmath8 is odd or even .",

    "@xmath19 satisfies very clean functional equations .",
    "the simplest ones are @xmath20    for @xmath21 , one obtains the bloch wigner dilogarithm , @xmath22 which satisfies the well - known five - term relation @xmath23 for @xmath24 we obtain @xmath25 this modified trilogarithm satisfies more functional equations , such as the spence ",

    "for each @xmath8 we are interested in working with this group modulo the ( rational ) functional equations of the @xmath8th polylogarithm .",
    "unfortunately , the functional equations of higher polylogarithms are not known explicitly .    for @xmath31 an algebraic variety , goncharov @xcite ,",
    "has constructed some groups that conjecturally correspond to the groups in the above paragraph and they fit into polylogarithmic motivic complexes whose cohomology is related to bloch groups and is conjectured to be the motivic cohomology of @xmath31 .",
    "a regulator can be defined in these complexes and is conjectured to coincide with beilinson s regulator .    from now on we will follow @xcite .",
    "we state definitions and results , the proofs may be found in the mentioned works .",
    "given a field @xmath28 one defines inductively some subgroups @xmath32 , then lets @xmath33/\\mathcal{r}_n(f).\\ ] ] the classes of @xmath34 in @xmath29 $ ] and in @xmath35 will be denoted by @xmath36 and @xmath37 respectively .",
    "we begin by setting @xmath38 thus @xmath39 .",

    "then @xmath90 defines a morphism of complexes @xmath91 .\\ ] ]    the induced morphism @xmath92 coincides with the tame symbol defined by milnor @xmath93    let @xmath31 be a complex variety .",

    "let @xmath97 be the de rham differential on @xmath98 and let @xmath99 be the de rham differential on distributions .",

    "the relation of @xmath114 to the regulator is roughly as follows . as we mentioned in conjecture [ gonconj ] , the cohomology of the first complex corresponds to the adams filtration which is the absolute cohomology . on the other hand , a slight modification of the second complex leads to deligne cohomology .",
    "now , @xmath114 as seen as a map between the cohomologies of these two complexes is conjectured to have the same image as the regulator ( @xcite ) .",
    "we should also remark that the final goal is not to work with @xmath115 , but with @xmath31 itself .",
    "for @xmath31 a regular projective variety over a field @xmath28 goncharov @xcite describes the difficulties for defining the complex @xmath116 as opposed to @xmath117 .",
    "basically , it is known how to define @xmath116 when @xmath118 for an arbitrary field @xmath28 , @xmath31 is a regular curve over an arbitrary field @xmath28 , or @xmath31 is an arbitrary regular scheme but @xmath119 .",
    "now , in terms of the relation between @xmath114 , the regulator , and beilinson s conjectures , the picture is much less known . as an illustration , the case @xmath118 for @xmath28 a number field corresponds to zagier s conjecture @xcite , @xcite .",

    "technically one needs @xmath141 $ ] for these examples to be in the first case , otherwise @xmath138 .",

    "this condition may be rephrased as the symbol @xmath146 is trivial in @xmath147 .",

    ", we are going to examine the simplest example for the exact case in two variables .",

    "integration path for @xmath162    then @xmath163 - [ { \\xi}_6]$ ] ( where @xmath164 ) and we obtain @xmath165",
    "our goal is to extend this situation to three variables .",
    "let @xmath166 $ ] .",
    "we will take    @xmath167",
    "@xmath168 @xmath169 this differential form is defined in the surface @xmath170 minus the set @xmath126 of poles and zeros of @xmath34 , @xmath127 and @xmath171 .",
    "we can express the mahler measure of @xmath155 as @xmath172 where @xmath173 , following the previous notation , is the principal coefficient of the polynomial @xmath120[z]$ ] and @xmath174    recall @xmath137 in closed in @xmath175 since it verifies @xmath176 .",
    "typically , one expects that integral ( [ 3var ] ) can be computed if we are in one of the two ideal situations that we described before .",
    "either the form @xmath177 is not exact and the set @xmath178 consists of closed subsets and the integral is computed by residues , or the form @xmath177 is exact and the set @xmath178 has nontrivial boundaries , so stokes theorem is used .    the first case would lead to instances of beilinson s conjectures and produces special values of l - functions of surfaces .",
    "examples in this direction can be found in bertin s work @xcite .",
    "bertin relates the mahler measure of some @xmath179 surfaces to eisenstein - kronecker series in a similar way as rodriguez - villegas does for two - variable cases @xcite .    in the second case",
    "we need that @xmath177 is exact .",
    "we are going to concentrate on this case .",
    "we are integrating on a subset of the surface @xmath180 . in order for the element in the cohomology to be defined everywhere in the surface @xmath180 , we need the residues to be zero .",
    "this situation is fulfilled when the tame symbols are zero ( see section [ gonchcomplexes ] )",
    ". this condition will not be a problem for us because when @xmath137 is exact the tame symbols are zero .",
    "as in the two - variable case , theorem [ thm : cond ] implies @xmath181 where @xmath182    thus , in order to apply stokes theorem , we need to require that @xmath183 in @xmath184 for @xmath137 to be exact .",
    "an equivalent way of expressing this condition is that @xmath185 is trivial in @xmath186 .    in this case , @xmath187 where @xmath188 this set @xmath189 seems to have no boundary .",
    "however , @xmath189 as described above may contain singularities which may give rise to a boundary when desingularized .",
    "we will change our point of view .",
    "namely , assume that @xmath190 $ ] and nonreciprocal ( this condition is true for all the examples we study ) , then @xmath191 this property , together with the condition @xmath192 , allows us to write @xmath193 ( this idea was proposed by maillot ) .",
    "observe that we are integrating now on a path @xmath194 inside the curve @xmath195    in order to easily compute @xmath196 we have again the two possibilities that we had before .",
    "we are going to concentrate , as usual , in the case when @xmath197 is exact .",
    "the differential form @xmath198 is defined in this new curve @xmath130 . as before , to be sure that it is defined everywhere , we need to ask that the residues are trivial . this fact is guaranteed by the triviality of tame symbols .",
    "this last condition is satisfied if @xmath198 is exact .",
    "indeed , we have changed our ambient variety , and we now wonder when @xmath198 is exact in @xmath130 ( @xmath198 is not exact in @xmath180 since that would imply that @xmath137 is zero )",
    ".    fortunately we have @xmath199 by theorem [ thm : cond ] .",
    "the condition for @xmath198 to be exact is not as easily established as in the preceding cases because @xmath198 is not multiplicative in the first variable .",
    "in fact , the first variable behaves as the dilogarithm , in other words , the transformations are ruled by the five - term relation .",
    "we may express the condition we need as : @xmath200 in @xmath201 .",
    "assuming conjecture [ gonconj ] , this is equivalent to saying that a certain symbol for @xmath34 and @xmath127 is trivial in @xmath202 .",
    "then we have @xmath203 where @xmath204 .",
    "now assume that @xmath149 , \\quad \\epsilon_k = \\pm 1\\ ] ] where @xmath150 , @xmath151 .",
    "thus we have proved    let @xmath205 $ ] be irreducible and nonreciprocal , and let @xmath206 and @xmath207 .",
    "assume that @xmath208 in @xmath184 , and @xmath209 in @xmath201 for all @xmath210 .",
    "then @xmath211    by using zagier s conjecture ( see zagier @xcite , zagier and gangl @xcite ) , it is possible to formulate a conjecture that would imply , under certain additional circumstances , a relationship with @xmath212 in a similar fashion as boyd and rodriguez - villegas have done for the two - variable case .",
    "we will illustrate this phenomenon at the end of the example that follows .",
    "we will proceed to the study of a family of three - variable polynomials that come from the world of resultants , namely , @xmath213 .",
    "this family was computed in @xcite and the computation is quite involved , though elementary .",
    "the mahler measure of @xmath213 is the same as the mahler measure of a certain rational function .",

    "since we would like to see that @xmath177 is exact , we need to solve equation ( [ eqcond1 ] ) for this case .",
    "the equation for the wedge product becomes @xmath221    after performing stokes theorem for the first time we will have to evaluate the form @xmath198 in the following element of @xmath222 : @xmath223    we need to compute the corresponding curve @xmath130 .",
    "we take advantage of the fact that our equation has the shape @xmath224 . in order to compute @xmath130",

    "we need to be careful and take the complement of an angle if it happens to be greater than @xmath255 , ( this corresponds to the cases when the sines are negatives ) .",

    "we do not need to compute those angles .",
    "in fact , we may describe the integration path as either @xmath266 or @xmath267 it is appropriate to think of it in this way , because @xmath268 and @xmath269 change continuously around the right - angled triangles .",
    "moreover , because of this property , everything reduces to evaluating @xmath270 in @xmath271 in the cases of @xmath256 and @xmath257 and computing the difference .",
    "one could have problems when @xmath171 is zero or has a pole .",

    "the rational function has the form @xmath284 and @xmath285 where @xmath286 and @xmath287 ( in other words , @xmath288 ) .",

    "according to the conjecture , @xmath290 has rank 2 .",
