    "bipolar outflows are ubiquitous from young low - mass stars , but are difficult to observe toward high - mass stars , which typically form in crowded , physically complex regions that are quickly disrupted by ionization fronts and stellar winds .",
    "the nearest region of massive star formation is the kleinmann - low nebula in orion , at a distance of about 400 pc @xcite .",
    "measurements of h@xmath1o maser proper motions led @xcite to suggest that two distinct outflows originate from this region  a low velocity ( 18 km  s@xmath2 ) outflow along a ne  sw axis , and a high velocity ( 30100 km  s@xmath2 ) flow extending roughly nw  se . both outflows were inferred to originate within a few arcseconds of radio source  i , a young star with a luminosity of @xmath3 to @xmath4 l@xmath5 @xcite .",
    "the high velocity outflow also manifests itself as lobes of shock - excited h@xmath1 @xcite and as broad , weakly bipolar line wings in co and other molecules @xcite .",
    "source i is associated with a cluster of sio masers . from fits to @xmath6 resolution bima data , @xcite found that the j=2 - 1 v=1 sio masers were clustered along two arcs offset @xmath7 nw and se of source  i. @xcite reproduced this pattern with a model of maser emission from a rotating , expanding disk , tilted at @xmath8 to the plane of the sky .",
    "the axis of the model disk was projected at pa @xmath9 , suggesting that the high velocity outflow emerged along its poles .",
    "later observations showed that the j=2 - 1 sio line in the v=0 vibrational level also was masing @xcite in a 1000 au long hourglass - shaped region centered on source  i. because the hourglass was elongated ne  sw , it was natural to associate it with the outer regions of the model v=1 maser disk .",
    "sio linewidths were @xmath10  km  s@xmath2  across the entire hourglass , inconsistent with keplerian rotation , so @xcite suggested that the emission traced the turbulent boundary layer between an underlying , unseen , disk and the high velocity outflow .",
    "more recent observations have cast doubt on this picture .",
    "vlba observations of the 43 ghz v=1 sio masers @xcite showed that the brightest maser spots were clustered in 4 groups , rather than than in a ring as predicted by the @xcite model .",
    "a bridge of emission connecting the two southern clusters led @xcite to propose that the v=1 masers originate in a nearly edge - on disk rotating about a ne  sw axis , perpendicular to the previously hypothesized disk , and that the v=0 sio emission traces the base of the 18  km  s@xmath2  outflow .",
    "this model did not attempt to explain the high velocity outflow .",
    "proper motion measurements of source  i @xcite also pose problems for the original model .",
    "these data indicate that source  i is moving to the se at @xmath11/year , plowing through the molecular cloud at @xmath12  km  s@xmath2 . in that case a 1000 au diameter disk would rapidly be stripped away by the ram pressure of the ambient gas unless source  i were implausibly massive .",
    "in this paper we report @xmath0 ( 180 au ) resolution images of the sio v=0 j=2 - 1 line obtained with carma .",
    "the new maps provide the best evidence to date that the v=0 sio emission originates in a ne  sw outflow from source  i , as in the @xcite model .",
    "the maps also suggest that the high velocity outflow is a continuation of this compact flow .",
    "observations were made with carma in the a , b , and c arrays , providing projected antenna spacings ranging from 5 to 545 k@xmath13 .",
    "the total integration time on orion - kl was 3.4 hrs in the a - array ( 2009 jan ) , 3.7 hrs in the b - array ( 2008 feb ) , and 5 hrs in the c - array ( 2009 may ) .",
    "the correlator was configured for simultaneous observations of the j=2 - 1 sio transitions in both the v=0 ( 86.847 ghz ) and v=1 ( 86.243 ghz ) vibrational levels . for each transition",
    "the velocity coverage was 104  km  s@xmath2  and the resolution was 3.4  km  s@xmath2  after hanning smoothing .",
    "observations of quasars were used to calibrate phase and amplitude ripples across the i.f . passband .",
    "after these were removed , the visibility data were selfcalibrated using a 28  km  s@xmath2  wide channel that included all the bright v=1 maser features . only baselines shorter than 250 k@xmath13 were used in the selfcalibration because the maser is slightly resolved on the longest baselines .",
    "the integration time per data record was 4 sec in the a - array and 10 sec in the b and c arrays , allowing near - complete removal of atmospheric phase fluctuations ; phase residuals on the maser were typically @xmath14 on all baselines after selfcalibration .",
    "maps of the v=0 sio line were made with the miriad data reduction package . uniformly weighting the visibility data yielded an",
    "@xmath15 synthesized beam at pa @xmath16 . because the data were selfcalibrated using the v=1 sio masers , the maps are centered on the intensity - weighted mean maser position , which does not coincide precisely with radio source  i. an 86 ghz continuum map made with a - array data from 2009 jan showed that source  i was centered @xmath17 w and @xmath18 s of the mean v=1 maser position .",
    "we adjusted the central coordinate of the maps to place source  i at @xmath19 , @xmath20 , as derived from vla proper motion data @xcite .",
    "[ thb ]    figure  [ fig : fig1 ] presents a series of channel maps showing the v=0 sio emission in an @xmath21 box centered on source  i. the lowest contour on these images is 75 k and the peak is 3800 k.    although the maps in figure  [ fig : fig1 ] are consistent with those published by @xcite and @xcite , the higher quality carma images clearly indicate that v=0 sio emission originates in a ne  sw bipolar outflow from source  i , as in the @xcite model .",
    "the central channels show the limb - brightened edges of two cones centered on source  i ; emission in the line wings is brightest interior to these cones .",
    "although the outflow appears to lie nearly in the plane of the sky , there is a measurable red - blue asymmetry : redshifted gas at v@xmath22= 22  km  s@xmath2appears as a narrow jet to the sw , while blueshifted gas at v@xmath22= @xmath23  km  s@xmath2  is offset to the ne .",
    "this asymmetry is inconsistent with the old model in which the emission originates in the turbulent boundary layer of a disk .",
    "it is clear that the sio outflow corresponds to the 18  km  s@xmath2  h@xmath1o maser outflow identified by @xcite : toward source  i the sio line has a fullwidth at zero intensity of @xmath24  km  s@xmath2 , and both sio and h@xmath1o masers extend along a ne  sw axis .",
    "it is likely , however , that this material was accelerated by a much faster wind .",
    "source i is traveling to the se at 14  km  s@xmath2  in the plane of the sky @xcite , so gas moving outward at only 18  km  s@xmath2  would appear to be swept back into an arc with arms trailing to the nw .",
    "[ thb ]    the high signal to noise level in the maps , exceeding 100:1 on the bright maser spots , makes it feasible to enhance the resolution of the innermost region of the outflow .",
    "one can fit the position of an isolated maser feature to an accuracy of @xmath25 @xcite , where @xmath26 is the apparent fwhm of the source and snr is the signal - to - noise ratio . here",
    "the maser spots overlap heavily , however , so fitting their positions individually is difficult .",
    "instead , we cleaned the maps in the usual way , then convolved the clean components with a @xmath27 fwhm gaussian restoring beam , about half the width of the synthesized beam .",
    "figure  [ fig : fig2 ] shows the resulting sio v=0 image at v@xmath22= 5  km  s@xmath2  in the @xmath28 central region .",
    "red contours show the 229 ghz continuum emission from source  i , which is centered in the waist of the sio hourglass ; sio masers in the v=1 vibrational level are clustered along the edges of the continuum source .    the brightest v=0 sio masers lie along two bars offset @xmath29 ne and sw of the continuum source .",
    "the ends of the bars are limb - brightened , suggesting that the masers originate in two annuli .",
    "position - velocity cuts through the bars , shown in panels ( a ) and ( b ) , hint that these annuli are expanding radially at @xmath30  km  s@xmath2 , as modeled by the green ellipses .",
    "[ thb ]    what about the high velocity outflow ? in order to obtain higher sensitivity for extended emission , we tapered the weighting of the visibility data to produce a set of channel maps with a @xmath31 synthesized beam .",
    "the rms noise is 4  k , increasing to as much as 8  k in channels with strong maser emission due to limited dynamic range .",
    "figure  [ fig : fig3 ] shows the full extent of the sio emission detected in these maps , color coded to indicate the intensity - weighted lsr velocity .",
    "brightness temperatures outside the central @xmath32 hourglass are @xmath33  k , hence this emission is likely to be thermal . as in previous maps of the high velocity outflow @xcite , the strongest redshifted emission is e of source  i , while blueshifted gas is offset to the nw .",
    "figure  [ fig : fig3 ] suggests that the extended high velocity outflow is simply a continuation of the compact outflow .",
    "for example , @xmath34 ne of source  i the compact outflow twists to the e and points directly toward some of the most redshifted gas in the extended flow .",
    "the opening angle appears to broaden abruptly at this point , perhaps as the outflow breaks out of dense gas surrounding source  i. two hh objects , 152 - 228 and 152 - 229 , lie at the tip of the flow ; proper motion measurements indicate that they are moving away from source  i at 35 - 50  km  s@xmath2  @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig : fig3 ] suggests that sio velocities increase away from source  i. this is particularly evident in the redshifted gas , as shown in figure  [ fig : fig4 ] ; note the absence of high velocity gas within @xmath35 of the star .",
    "there are several possible explanations for these velocity gradients .",
    "first , sio emission may originate in dense clumps that are entrained in a fast stellar wind .",
    "the wind continues to accelerate the clumps as they move outward .",
    "evidence for such acceleration is relatively common in outflows @xcite .",
    "second , it s possible that the sio emitting gas was ejected by an explosive event that flung out material with a range of speeds .",
    "the fastest - moving ejecta now are farthest from the center .",
    "the system of shock - excited h@xmath1 fingers in orion appears to have been created by such an explosive event @xcite , perhaps as a swept - up shell was fragmented by a faster - moving wind @xcite .",
    "third , it s possible that the extended gas provides a fossil record of a precessing outflow .",
    "currently the outflow axis is ne  sw , with the ( redshifted ) sw lobe tipped slightly into the plane of the sky .",
    "approximately @xmath36 from the star , the outflow axis appears to be e  w , with the e lobe tipped into the plane of the sky .",
    "if the true outflow velocity is 100  km  s@xmath2 , this @xmath37 change in direction took place in 200 years .",
    "precession occurs because of tidal interactions in noncoplanar binary systems ; periods of a few thousand years are typical of systems with binary separations of tens of au @xcite .",
    "a secondary in an eccentric orbit can change both the outflow direction and the mass loss rate periodically , as in the model of cepa presented by @xcite .",
    "@xcite report that much of the emission from the high velocity co line wings in orion originates from filamentary structures similar to the h@xmath1 fingers , with linear velocity gradients along them .",
    "@xcite argue that the high velocity flow is not a classical stellar outflow , but instead was produced by the disintegration , about 500 years ago , of a multiple stellar system that contained source  i and bn .",
    "while this scenario is consistent with the velocity gradients evident in figure  [ fig : fig4 ] and with the vaguely filamentary character of the sio emission away from source  i , it implies that the apparently continuous transition from the 18 km  s@xmath2flow to the high velocity outflow seen in figure  [ fig : fig3 ] is illusory .",
    "we are reluctant to accept that conclusion , and suggest that perhaps the disintegration of the multiple system triggered an abrupt increase in the velocity or mass loss rate of the outflow from source  i , creating the finger system as in the model of @xcite .",
    "new maps of the sio line in the v=0 j=2 - 1 transition toward orion - kl provide some of the clearest evidence to date that radio source  i , thought to be a massive young star , drives a bipolar outflow into the surrounding molecular cloud along a ne  sw axis .",
    "this outflow contains multiple water masers and conventionally is referred to as the 18 km  s@xmath2  flow",
    ". the outflow velocity must be substantially greater than 18  km  s@xmath2 , however , or the outflow lobes would trail back to the nw owing to the proper motion of source  i. close to source  i the sio v=0 emission is masing . the strongest masers are clustered in two annuli offset @xmath38 au from source  i along the central axis of the outflow .",
    "more extended , higher velocity gas extends along a nw - se axis , almost perpendicular to the 18  km  s@xmath2  flow .",
    "the sio maps suggest that this weakly bipolar outflow is an extension of the 18  km  s@xmath2  flow , which may change direction on time scales of a few hundred years .",
    "support for carma construction was derived from the states of california , illinois , and maryland , the gordon and betty moore foundation , the eileen and kenneth norris foundation , the caltech associates , and the national science foundation .",
    "ongoing carma development and operations are supported by the national science foundation under a cooperative agreement , and by the carma partner universities .                                , l.  j. , reid , m.  j. , chandler , c.  j. , diamond , p.  j. , & elitzur , m. 2004 , in iau symposium , vol .",
