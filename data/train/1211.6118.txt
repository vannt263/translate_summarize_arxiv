    "the stellar populations and gas densities in the centers of nearby bulge - disk galaxies is not uniformly old and non - star forming .",
    "results from millimeter wave interferometers show that the centers of many bulge - disk galaxies are gas rich ( see for example @xcite ) .",
    "similarly , results from spitzer and galex show that star formation rate densities of many bulges are high and star formation is significant compared to the bulge stellar mass @xcite .",
    "also , results from stellar populations show that many bulges are young and growing @xcite .",
    "we now understand that there is a great variety in the radial distribution of molecular gas in bulge - disk galaxies .    in the main bodies of disks ,",
    "total gas density profiles are very well described by exponential decay @xcite . however , for radii smaller than @xmath425% of the optical radius there is a very large amount of scatter from galaxy - to - galaxy .",
    "@xcite shows that the gas density in galaxy centers frequently breaks from the exponential disk , and often increases in density similar to star light .",
    "these small regions in the centers of disks are the same location as bulges in the stellar light profiles .",
    "other than the special case of outflows , the gas in the centers of bulge - disk galaxies is likely in a thin layer that is only a few hundred parsecs in thickness ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    ". however , typical bulge - disk decompositions do not consider the thickness of the bulge - component , only the surface density of stars .",
    "therefore , the gas in the centers of disks that is higher in surface density than the exponential profile is likely making stars that are , from the point - of - view of bulge - disk decompositions , in the `` bulge . ''",
    "however , in this case the `` bulge '' is not a 3-dimensional spheroid at the center of a galaxy disk , rather in this paper we adopt the definition of `` bulge '' to be the centrally located high surface - density component of a galaxy surface brightness profile , in excess over the inward extrapolation of an exponential disk .",
    "this definition of bulge is clearly observationally motivated .",
    "bulges are heterogeneous in more ways than just the star formation . once thought to be uniformly similar to elliptical galaxies , observations of bulge dynamics , stellar populations structure and morphology , now show that there are at least two categories of bulges ( respectively @xcite , also see @xcite for a review ) .",
    "this dichotomy of bulge properties can be summarized as follows : some bulges have properties similar to disk galaxies , and other bulges have properties similar to elliptical galaxies .",
    "those bulges with properties similar to disks are called `` pseudobulges '' and those with properties similar to elliptical galaxies are referred to as `` classical bulges '' .",
    "note that as used in this paper the terms pseudobulge and classical bulge are observationally based , and do not make any _ a priori _ assumption about the formation mechanism .",
    "also note , that in this paper the word `` bulge '' refers to the bulge in surface brightness profiles of non - edge on galaxies .",
    "this dichotomy is not a sequence in bulge - to - total ratio ; at a constant bulge - to - total ratio bulges separate into two classes , even at small bulge - to - total ratios @xcite .",
    "also , it appears to be consistent within different means of identifying pseudobulges and classical bulges .",
    "for example , bulges with higher 3.6 - 8.0  @xmath5 m colors , indicative of higher specific star formation rates , have lower srsic index @xcite . also bulges with low velocity dispersion are more likely to be identified as pseudobulges @xcite . in this paper , we wish to directly compare molecular gas density to pseudobulge diagnostics , like srsic index .    a number of simulations show that barred gravitational potentials lead to central concentrations of gas in simulated disk galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in principle",
    ", the bar torques the gas , this torque facilitates an exchange of angular momentum @xcite . inside of corotation a common , but not universal , reponse to bar torques is a angular monentum loss , and thus the gas falls to smaller radius .",
    "@xcite shows with hydrodynamical models that indeed bars are capable of driving significant masses of gas ; this occurs due to shocks on the leading edges of bars that efficiently drive inward flows of gas .",
    "@xcite show that the motion of gas in bars is consistent with that of shocks predicted in the simulations of @xcite , and the net effect is inflow in the central parts of a barred disk galaxy",
    ". detailed studies of individual galaxies have shown that torques introduced by bars in disk galaxies are likely responsible for inward flowing gas , however the flow of gas in galaxies is often complicated by the details of the disk @xcite .",
    "these studies show that bars can drive gaseous inflows ; typical rates of inflow are of order 0.1 - 10  @xmath6 .",
    "several studies find a high - scatter correlation between the presence of a bar and high densities of gas in the central kiloparsec of disks @xcite .",
    "similarly , barred disks are more likely to have bluer ( younger ) bulges @xcite , and are star forming @xcite .",
    "the scatter in the bar - central gas density correlation is large enough to suggest that simply dividing galaxies into barred vs. unbarred is an oversimplification .",
    "a number of factors could be adding to the dispersion between the correlation of bars and central gas density .",
    "simulations show that bars can dissolve ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . also , spirals can similarly torque gas @xcite .",
    "accretion or weak interactions with neighboring galaxies could drive central concentrations of gas @xcite . indeed , @xcite show that bar driven `` secular '' evolution and evolution driven through accretion / merging is not mutually exclusive .",
    "thus far , arguments that high gas densities in bulges are increasing the stellar bulge - to - total ratio of galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) are built on the assumption that star formation in bulges is the same as in spiral arms of disks .",
    "@xcite shows that typical giant molecular clouds in nearby galaxies are of the order @xmath450 - 300  m@xmath2  pc@xmath3 .",
    "gas densities observed in the centers of disks can be an order of magnitude higher ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    ". the increased pressure from a higher density of stars could significantly affect the formation of stars ( for a discussion see * ? ? ? * ) . furthermore , emission from a nearby agn could ionize gas .",
    "it is therefore not clear if the formation of stars out of gas has similar efficiency in bulges and disks over the full range of bulge properties . in this paper",
    "we will investigate modifications to both the co - to - molecular gas conversion factor and also to the calculation of star formation rates suited to the environment of bulges , we will also investigate the star formation law of bulges to determine if star formation in bulges is , at least to low order , similar to what is observed in disks .    in this paper we will implement new methods to determine both star formation rates and gas masses in ways that are more appropriate for bulges .",
    "we will then determine what structural properties of the bulge and galaxy are associated with high gas density .",
    "the properties of galaxies in our sample are listed in table 1 .",
    "our sample is the superset of 3 surveys which map the co(1 - 0 ) in nearby bulge - disk galaxies .",
    "those surveys are the song ( described in   * ? ? ?",
    "* ) conducted on the berkeley - illinois - maryland association ( bima ) interferometer @xcite , the nuga ( described in @xcite ; pis : s. garca - burillo and f. combes ) survey conducted on the plateau de bure ( pdbi ) interferometer , and the sting ( described in @xcite ; pi : a .",
    "bolatto ) .",
    "in addition to the molecular gas mass , for each galaxy we also determine the star formation rate , stellar mass and carry out bulge - disk decompositions to the near infrared stellar light profile ( these methods are described below ) .",
    "therefore we require that all galaxies have mips data from _",
    "spitzer space telescope_. also the galaxy must have near ir data with high enough spatial resolution to accurately decompose the stellar light profile ( for a detailed discussion see * ? ? ?",
    "two galaxies are thus excluded due to lack of ancillary data .",
    "ngc  3718 does not have mips data , and ngc  6574 did not have adequate data for bulge - disk decomposition . also , we are interested in the properties of disks , so we omit those galaxies that are experiencing major mergers from the sample : ngc  5953 , ngc  1961 , ngc  4490 .",
    "the agn in ngc  1068 makes both decomposition and measurement of the star formation rate unreliable ; it is thus omitted . finally , due to galactic extinction",
    "we could not reliably estimate the mass - to - light ratio of ic  342 & ngc  1569 ( e(b - v ) = 0.558 & 0.700  mag respectively , @xcite ) ; they are thus removed from the sample .",
    "the resulting combined sample is 60 galaxies .",
    "color , absolute b mag , and optical radius .",
    "these data are taken from hyper - leda .",

    "[ fig : sample],title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=49.0% ]    we combine the multiple surveys simply to increase the number of galaxies , and thus obtain better statistics .",
    "this is especially useful for separation into sub - samples for comparison ( e.g.  barred vs unbarred or pseudo- vs classical bulges ) .",
    "however , the trade off is that our sample is not based on a uniform set of selection criteria . in fig .",
    "[ fig : sample ] we show the basic properties of our sample . for comparison",
    "we also show the distribution of basic properties of galaxies from the rc3 @xcite that cover the same range in hubble type . we have scaled the numbers of the rc3 galaxies to match our sample . in the top panel",
    "we show the distribution of morphological t - types of our sample .",
    "the sample includes spiral galaxies from sa to sd , with a preference toward intermediate types .",
    "the sample will thus favor medium size bulges @xcite , however , it should adequately cover parameter space . in the second panel",
    "we show the distribution @xmath7 optical color , and our sample adequately covers the range of @xmath7 in typical spiral galaxies . in the bottom two panels we show absolute galaxy magnitude and galaxy size .",
    "it is clear that our sample preferentially includes brighter , larger galaxies .",
    "therefore , the results we find are most applicable to massive spiral galaxies .",
    "in this paper we wish to compare gas masses of bulges , to bulge - disk decompositions , stellar masses , and star formation rates . therefore , we require data from a wide variety of sources and must employ vastly different techniques , across a wide range in wavelengths . in this section",
    "we will describe each technique employed .",
    "we take distances from the nasa extragalactic database ( ned ) .",
    "we use the ned averaged redshift independent distance . in the event that an extreme outlier exists from the average ,",
    "we remove the outlier and re - average .      for each galaxy ,",
    "we first carry out bulge - disk decomposition to the starlight .",
    "this allows us to measure the radius inside which the bulge dominates the surface brightness profile .",
    "also we will use the decomposition parameters to study how gas density scales with those properties of the starlight .",
    "our method is described in detail in several publications , including @xcite .",
    "a key part of our decomposition method is combining surface photometry from multiple data sources to construct a single 2-d surface brightness distribution .",
    "this technique reduces systematic errors in a particular data set ( e.g. sky subtraction and point - spread function ) , as well as increasing dynamic fitting range , in radius , by combining high spatial resolution ( typically hst ) data with wide field ground - based data .",
    "this method is specifically optimized to reduce the uncertainty in bulge paramaters . maximizing the dynamic fitting range in log(radius ) , not necessarily adding azimuthal information , is critical to accurately fit the curvature in the surface brightness profile , which is represented by the srsic index , for a particular bulge .",
    "our primary source of data for measuring the bulge - disk decomposition is the 2mass h - band maps .",
    "although 2mass @xmath8 band is slightly less sensitive to dust emission and variations in mass - to - light ratio , the @xmath9-band data goes much deeper in surface brightness .",
    "the improved sensitivity to the faint isophotes gives a better constraint to the disk parameters in the bulge - disk decompositions .",
    "when available we use the higher quality images from the 2mass large galaxy atlas @xcite . otherwise @xmath9-band images are taken from the 2mass archive .",
    "we also frequently add data , when available , from the osu bright galaxy survey @xcite .    for all ground - based images we calculate sky values by fitting a plane to the areas of the image not affected by galaxy light or bright stars .",
    "we then subtract the surface representing the sky from the image .",
    "as we state above , comparison of multiple data sources facilitates identification of inaccurate sky - subtraction .",
    "when a galaxy has only one source of wide - field @xmath9-band data we then carry out the surface photometry using data available from spitzer / irac at 3.6  @xmath5 m .",
    "uncertainties in sky subtraction of @xmath9-band images are typically @xmath100.1  mag .",
    "fine spatial resolution is crucial for accurate bulge - disk decomposition using the srsic function ( for a detailed discussion see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite finds that in most cases resolution of @xmath4100  pc is sufficient for robust decompositions .",
    "since 2mass has a typical resolution of @xmath42  we must include higher resolution data in decompositions of galaxies at greater distance than 10  mpc .",
    "for nearby galaxies including high resolution data significantly reduces the uncertainty in the fit .",
    "the most common source of high resolution data is publicly available images in the hst archive .",
    "hst data is always measured with the f160w filter ( h - band ) .    to calculate the 2-d surface brightness distribution",
    ", we use the isophote fitting routine of @xcite .",
    "first , interfering foreground objects are identified in each image and masked via automatic routines in source extractor @xcite .",
    "we then run multiple iterations of manual masking .",
    "isophotes are sampled by 256 points equally spaced in an angle @xmath11 relating to polar angle by @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the polar angle and @xmath14 is the axial ratio .",
    "an ellipse is then fitted to each isophote by least squares .",
    "the software determines six parameters for each ellipse : relative surface brightness , center position , major and minor axis lengths , and position angle along the major axis .",
    "we then combine the surface photometry of different data sources by averaging the profiles .",
    "all profiles are scaled to match the zero - point of 2mass data . for example , when we include spitzer  3.6  @xmath5 m data we calculate the h-3.6 color over a region that is trustworthy ( not likely affected by either point - spread - function or sky subtraction ) , and then shift the surface brightness of the 3.6  @xmath5 m to match the 2mass image .",
    "this is carried out for all data sources .",

    ". the half - light radius , @xmath21 , of the bulge is obtained by converting @xmath17 , @xmath22 where the value of @xmath23 is a proportionality constant defined such that @xmath24 .",
    "@xmath25 and @xmath26 are the complete and incomplete gamma functions , respectively .",
    "we use the approximation @xmath27 .",
    "we restrict our range in possible srsic indices to @xmath28 to ensure that the approximation of @xmath23 is accurate @xcite .",
    "a more precise expansion is given in @xcite .",
    "( also , see @xcite for a review of the properties of the srsic function . )    because the srsic parameters are only determined to fit the major axis profile , they do not include information about the azimuthal shape of the bulge or disk .",
    "we therefore adjust all luminosities by the average ellipticity in the region in which that parameter dominates the light .    despite its successes , the srsic bulge plus outer exponential disk model of bulge - disk galaxies does not account for many features of galaxy surface brightness profiles .",
    "disks of intermediate type galaxies commonly have features such as bars , rings , and lenses ( see @xcite for a description of how these manifest in surface brightness profiles ) , similar features are now well known to exist in the centers of galaxies ( e.g. nuclear rings and nuclear star clusters ) . in general there are two methods for dealing with perturbations to a fit . in some cases authors attempt to fit the extra components , other authors mask those components .",
    "we choose the later .",
    "both have advantages and disadvantages .",
    "fitting extra components ( such as bars and nuclear star clusters ) introduces degeneracies between the two components , where as masking data can introduce selection biases .",
    "detailed testing and description of our method to deal with these structures can be found in @xcite .",
    "the appendix of @xcite investigates the stability of srsic parameters to the masking of bars and nuclear clusters . in cases",
    "in which the bulge is well resolved these methods recovers bulge and disk parameters that are equivalent ( also * ? ? ?",
    "in the subsequent paragraphs we describe how we deal with these structure :    _ bars : _ we mask the isophotes that are affected by bars and rings , and they are not included in the fit .",
    "this is a subjective procedure , as it requires selectively removing data from a galaxy s profile , and undoubtedly has an effect on the resulting parameters .",
    "@xcite investigate the affects of this procedure in detail on surface brightness profiles ; see the appendix of that paper .",
    "typically , the structure of the ellipticity profile aids in identification of bars , as described in @xcite . in a galaxy in which we identify a bar ( either using the ellipticity profile or near - ir imaging ) we identify isophotes associated with the bar , then remove those isophotes , and re - fit eq .",
    "[ eq : decomp ] .",
    "we continue this process , iteratively , until the systematic deviations in the residual profile converge on a robust solution .",
    "@xcite find that the largest effect of masking larger ranges is to increase the uncertainty .",
    "the size of the bulge remains roughly constant ; there is a tendenancy for the srsic index to decrease very slightly ( @xmath29 ) .",
    "we stress that the reason we can do this is that our technique relies upon resolving the bulge well , either from the galaxy being very close or from having hst data .",
    "bulges in unbarred galaxies are larger than those in barred galaxies.this is not likeley an artifact of our method to remove bars from fits because the same result can be found in the samples of other works that carry out bulge - bar - disk decomposition .",
    "this is true both when we compare physical size , and the size of bulges that has been normalized by the size of the galaxy .",
    "we will discuss later ( in  3.6 ) that the small size difference is not what is responsible for the differences in bulge co surface brightness between either barred or unbarred galaxies or classical or pseudobulges .",
    "in our sample we find that the median size of bulges in unbarred galaxies are 1.5@xmath30 the size of bulges in bared galaxies .",
    "to check that this is not a bias introduced by our method , we compile data from both @xcite and @xcite to find a similar result ; both of these papers use 2-d decompositions , that include parameterizations for the bulge , bar , and disk .",
    "@xcite finds , similar to us that the median bulge half - light radius for classical bulges ( @xmath31 ) is @xmath32 the median r@xmath33 of pseudobulges ( @xmath34 ) .",
    "we reconfirm this with data from @xcite who also carries out bulge - bar - disk decomposition to 181 bright spiral galaxies in the osubgs @xcite .",
    "it is important to take into account the size of the galaxy ; bigger bulges may simply reside in bigger halos .",
    "so we recheck this result , this time we normalize all samples by the optical radius of the galaxy ( @xmath35 ) .",
    "we find the same result .",
    "the median bulge in an unbarred disk is @xmath36 the size of that in a barred disk ( when normalized by the disk scale - length ) .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : bar_check ] we show the distribution of srsic indices and bulge sizes for our sample galaxies .",

    "we do not see a significant offset in either @xmath20 or bulge size .",
    "the distribution of srsic indices in this sample appears to be very similar to that of @xcite ; the bimodality in bulge srsic index is clearly visible for barred and unbarred galaxies . in bulge size",
    "there is a slight preference for unbarred bulges to be larger fraction of the optical radius .",
    "but as we state above , this is likely an unavoidable physical phenomenon .",
    "we will discuss below that this difference does not bias our co surface brightness measurements . in our sample , bulges in unbarred galaxies are typically 1.5@xmath30 the sizes of bulges in barred galaxies , when normalized either by disk scale - length or @xmath38 .",
    "a few pseudobulges have very small srsic indices ( @xmath39 ) . they are ngc  0925 , 2403 , 2903 .",
    "@xcite shows that bars can have very low srsic index .",

    "a possible scenario is that if a gas - rich galaxy forms a bar , and there is no stabilizing bulge with large srsic index , the galaxy will then efficiently drive gas toward the center of the disk .",
    "the gas then forms stars in a cold - thin disk in the center of the galaxy .",
    "since the gas is at higher densities than the inward extrapolation of the exponential disk ( as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : prof ] ) , the resulting surface density of stars is higher than the exponential disk .",
    "therefore , when we carry out bulge - disk decomposition then the system is found to have a `` bulge '' in the light profile .",
    "@xcite show that bulges with low srsic index have colder stellar kinematics ; also @xcite show that bulges with lower srsic index are more likely to be flatter . in this work",
    "we have shown that bulges with low srsic index have higher gas densities .",
    "the observations we present here , therefore , do not contradict with the idea that the light that is frequently called bulge light includes a significant component of cold stars that formed though internal star formation , that frequently remains ongoing at @xmath147 .",
    "it is likely that the total mass of a particular bulge could result from multiple phenomena .",
    "for example , a galaxy could form a small bulge though a very gas rich merger ( as described in * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) or via direct accretion , and then secular evolution could add mass to the pre - existing bulge .",
    "indeed , @xcite shows a simulation in which accretion of a small - gas rich satellite instigates bar formation in a spiral disk , and then would subsequently lead to increased gas density in the center of a disk .",
    "@xcite finds a sample of bulges that are consistent with systems expectations of mixed systems .",
    "once the gas is in bulges , from our data , it appears to form stars with similar efficiency as in the main body of the disk .",
    "it is possible that multiple effects due to high pressure cancel out at these spatial scales .",
    "for example , the intense pressure in bulges could increase the efficiency of star formation inside of molecular clouds in bulges , but also this intense pressure could also generate more molecular gas in diffuse form , outside of molecular clouds @xcite .",
    "higher resolution observations than we present here are necessary to understand the star formation in bulges at the scale of molecular clouds . nonetheless , at the scale of bulges ( a few kpc ) our results suggest that the flow of gas into the center of the galaxy is the main regulating factor for star formation in galaxy centers .",
