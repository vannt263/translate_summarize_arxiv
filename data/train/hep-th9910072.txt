    "the pioneer articles of fulling and unruh @xcite showing the non - equivalence of the quantization of scalar fields in rindler and minkowski coordinates and the thermal character of the radiation were the origin of a large body of articles devoted to analyze quantum measurement processes in uniformly accelerated frames and possible interpretations thereof .",
