    "foil activation is usually used as a standard technique for neutron yield measurements in pulsed fusion sources . from the early plasma focus ( pf )",
    "research @xcite , activation of silver and indium foils have been used @xcite , although the so called silver activated geiger counter is the most known detector from both . in pf devices",
    "@xcite , depending on the filling gas , neutrons from @xmath0 reactions or @xmath1 reactions are produced with typical energies of @xmath2 and @xmath3 respectively .",
    "for fast neutrons , activation detectors usually require neutron moderation to thermal energies .",
    "notwithstanding , when neutron intensity is high enough , typically higher than @xmath4 per source pulse , activation by fast neutrons could be used as in the case of the indium or beryllium counters .",
    "detectors based on activation by thermal neutrons have usually detection limits higher than @xmath5 per source pulse @xcite .    in recent years",
    ", several groups around the world have started research programs on small scale low energy plasma focus devices , especially in the sub - kilojoule energy range @xcite and in the sub - hundredjoule energy range @xcite . as a consequence ,",
    "requirements on detector sensitivity were increased in order to characterize such devices .",
    "for the low emission regime ( @xmath6 per source pulse ) it is possible to use moderated gas proportional counters based on @xmath7 or @xmath8 filled tubes @xcite . in these detectors",
    "thermal neutron capture occurs with cross sections one order of magnitude higher than indium or silver activation cross section .",
    "therefore , detection limits in neutron proportional counters should be at least one order of magnitude lower .",
    "the disadvantage of these detectors for pulsed sources is the pulse piling - up produced during high instantaneous count rates due to the burst of fast neutrons , which make it impossible to count single neutron pulses by standard nuclear electronics . to deal with this problem two schemes of use",
    "have been proposed :    * use of high counting rate electronics and controlling of the instantaneous count rate by detector - source separation .",
    "this technique has been reported to be successful in resolving yields higher than @xmath9 per source burst @xcite .",
    "* cross calibration on the accumulated charge ( preamplifier output signal ) generated in the counter tube by the neutron burst using as neutron reference a foil activation detector @xcite .",
    "the comparison of the response of a reference detector with the proportional counter allows to obtain a calibration factor in the high emission regime .",
    "thus , by means of extrapolation , it is possible to detect yields of the order of @xmath10 in the low emission regime using the moderated proportional counters . due to the fact that detection limits are transferred by the calibration process from the reference detector , the uncertainties in single measurements are of the order of the yield or greater .",
    "thus , no improvement in measurement uncertainties is obtained for the low emission regime despite the high efficiency of neutron proportional counters tubes in comparison with foil activation detectors . however , for bursts of the order of @xmath11 , it is still possible to measure the pulsed neutron emission rate with an accuracy of the order of @xmath12 by taking averages on large samples of shots @xcite .",
    "the current state of the art in the use of proportional counters for pulsed fast neutrons lacks a calibration technique to allow reducing detection limits below @xmath5 per source burst in single shot measurements . to overcome this deficiency , in the following",
    ", a methodology is proposed for the analysis of the detector output signal to find the number of piled - up individual detected events per burst and its uncertainties , while allowing for detector efficiency to be established through the measurement of neutrons arising from an isotopic neutron source .",
    "thus , it is possible to obtain the real neutron yield .",
    "the detailed study of the pulse piling - up statistics and other sources that influence the measurement process , namely counting statistics and background , are described in what follows .",
    "in the so called continuous regime , as depicted in fig . [ esq_uso_3he ] ,",
    "detection system consists of a moderated counter tube connected to a charge preamplifier and an amplifier , and finally connected to a counting system . as a consequence from the detection process in the counter tube ,",
    "charge is produced and collected at the input terminal of the preamplifier .",
    "the output of the preamplifier is a signal whose pulse height is proportional to the integrated charge provided at the input .",
    "decay of the preamplifier output is characterized by an exponential fall and @xmath13 time constant . once in the amplifier , typically a linear amplifier ,",
    "the signal is shaped and amplified in order to make it suitable for counting systems . to allow proper counting , the count rate should in general satisfy @xmath14 . in fig .",
    "[ esq_uso_3he ] it is also shown the output in the so called pulsed regime . in this case the preamplifier output is directly connected to a digital oscilloscope . when the detection system is irradiated by an extremely short pulse of fast neutrons ( @xmath15 ) , the pulse is spread over tens of microseconds as a result of neutron moderation to thermal energies . when fluence is high enough to make the instantaneous count rate to be @xmath16 ,",
    "single neutron signals will be piled - up thus smoothing the output signal and making it impossible to count individual detected events by standard nuclear electronics .",
    "in contrast for lower fluence , when @xmath17 , signal shape is not smooth and eventually it is possible to distinguish single neutron pulses from the output signal . in both cases notwithstanding , the total number of detected events should be proportional to the output signal area . even in the case of pulse piling - up , the number of detected events could be always obtained only from the net signal area , provided that space charge accumulation in the detector tube does not impair linearity .    when detection system is set up for pulsed regime ( _",
    "`` charge integration mode '' _ ) , there are three sources of fluctuations that influence the measurement process :    1 .",
    "* counting statistics : * fluctuations arise from the detection process and are well described by the poisson distribution .",
    "* pulse piling - up statistics : * arise from the `` _ _ wall effect _ _ '' taking place inside the counter tube , which results in a very asymmetrical distribution .",
    "therefore , when pulse piling - up happens , the sum of two or more single random detected events generate overlapping distributions which give rise to differences between the true and the expected number of detected events .",
    "background : * the extracted signal from the detection system corresponds to the total charge generated in the tube , which is equivalent to the integral of the waveform acquired by the oscilloscope .",
    "thus , electrical noise acts as background .",
    "besides electrical noise , natural background is always present although in some cases it could be negligible .",
    "detection systems available in our facilities were reported previously by moreno _ et al _ @xcite . they are based on a paraffin wax moderator ( @xmath18 ) and a @xmath19he tube ( model lnd 2523 ) sheathed by a @xmath20 thick lead sheet to stop x - rays and prevent their subsequent detection .",
    "the moderator is surrounded by an external cadmium sheet to absorb thermal neutrons .",
    "the tube is connected to a preamplifier ( canberra 2006 ) and the high voltage feed is set to @xmath21 . in order improve the signal - to - noise ratio , the preamplifier is adjusted with a conversion gain of @xmath22 which produces a @xmath23 voltage output factor scale @xcite . the @xmath13 time constant",
    "is set to @xmath24 , this is the fall time for individual pulses when the input pulse risetime is less than hundred nanoseconds . when used for the pulsed regime , signal output from the preamplifier",
    "is recorded by a digital oscilloscope ( tektronix model tds 684 ) at @xmath25 input impedance , ac coupling , and @xmath26 bandwidth .",
    "horizontal scale is set in accordance with moderator decay time ( governing neutron feeding into the @xmath19he tube ) , in the case of our detectors time scale is set to @xmath27 .",
    "direct measurements of the total signal area are obtained using the internal integration oscilloscope function on a @xmath28 time window , which starts close to the trigger point .",
    "the oscilloscope is triggered by the electromagnetic pulse generated from the electrical discharge .",
    "+ detector efficiency or calibration factor ( @xmath29 ) for fast neutrons was obtained operating in the continuous regime by comparing neutron intensity from a standard isotopic source , used as neutron reference , and the registered net counting rate .",
    "the last is valid in the approximation that after many neutron scatters in the moderator the result is highly independent of the neutron input spectra ; that is , the standard source spectra or that originated at the plasma focus . to satisfy this approximation",
    "the fast neutron reference should have a neutron energy spectra as similar to the fusion spectra as possible .",
    "although @xmath0 reaction at low incident energies produces @xmath2 neutrons , observed fusion spectra around @xmath2 and extending from @xmath30 to @xmath31 have been reported in the literature @xcite . to fulfill this requirement a certified @xmath32cf isotopic source was used .",
    "this source is characterized by a mean energy between @xmath33 and its spectrum extends from @xmath34 .",
    "source neutron emision at the time of experiments was @xmath35 .",
    "measurements of count rate were carried out at different positions from @xmath36 to @xmath37 .",
    "for this purpose , the preamplifier output was connected to a tennelec tc-244 amplifier and then to a multichannel analyzer camberra multiport ii controlled by the interface genie2k .",
    "the gross counting was corrected by discounting natural background and air attenuation according to that reported by eisenhauer _",
    "_ @xcite . to account for solid angle ,",
    "the neutron intensity was corrected by the source anisotropy factors @xcite , which were previously characterized @xcite , and thus the number of neutrons arriving to the detector front face was calculated using the formula provided by gotoh _",
    "for a rectangular slit @xcite . these same measurements of count rate provided the pulse height spectrum of each proportional counter . in the following sections results",
    "are referred to one of our detection systems which is called @xmath19he-206 system .",
    "piling - up statistics was studied by means of the acceptance - rejection monte carlo method , which was used to numerically construct pulse piling - up distributions .",
    "the starting point was to obtain the waveform area spectrum for single events .",
    "due to pulse height at the preamplifier output being proportional to the accumulated charge provided at the input , then for single events waveform area is given by @xmath38 , where @xmath39 is the pulse height and @xmath40 a constant .",
    "thus , the pulse area spectrum could be obtained from the pulse height spectrum through rescaling it by the constant @xmath40 .",
    "@xmath40 depends only on the detection system . in order to characterize @xmath40 ,",
    "let us first consider a typical output signal from the preamp associated to detection of a single event , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : modelosenal ] .",
    "this signal can be modeled by the mathematical expression @xmath41    thus the signal area is given by @xmath42 where @xmath43    to obtain proper values to calculate @xmath40 , hundreds of waveforms from single neutron events were analyzed using the model of eq .",
    "[ eq : modelosenal ] and the non - linear least squares ( levenberg - marquardt method ) routine provided by the function _",
    "fit _ of the gnuplot package @xcite .",
    "results of this analysis are presented in table [ table : resultscaraterizacion_senales ] . using these results it was possible to construct the probability density function ( pdf ) and the cumulative distribution function for the proportional counter tube as shown in figure [ fig : pdfcounter ] .",
    ".characteristic preamplifier parameters for single neutron events acording to eq .",
    "[ eq : modelosenal ] in @xmath19he-206 detection system .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tab : valcarac_rangopos ]    in order to study detection limits , let us consider table [ tab : valcarac_rangopos ] where characteristic values for @xmath29 and @xmath44 of the typical positioning interval in an extremely low energy plasma focus device ( pf-50j , @xcite ) are shown .",
    "in addition , from @xmath45= y/\\bar j_c $ ] and @xmath46 the standard relative error is then calculated by @xmath47    plots from equation [ eq : final_porcerror ] are shown as a function of @xmath48 in figure [ fig : relativeerror ] .",
    "it is observed from this figure that when total neutron emission is higher than @xmath49 , uncertainties are less than @xmath50 . for @xmath51 uncertainties",
    "are of the order @xmath52 . finally , it has to be pointed out that reasonable uncertainties ( @xmath53 ) are still obtained in the range @xmath54 .",
    "the last is a direct consequence of the methodology proposed in this work .",
    "the statistics of the signal generated from pulse piling - up ( pulse piling - up statistics ) in a neutron proportional counter when used in the herein called pulsed regime has been studied .",
    "it has been found that pulse piling - up statistics converge to a normal distribution typically when the number of piled - up pulses is higher than a hundred . from the pulsed piling - up statistics , the counting statistical behaviour and background contributions",
    ", a measurement methodology for bursts of neutrons has been developed .",
    "the method is based on a counting model for the number of detected events based upon the net accumulated charge at the output of the detection system ( waveform area ) .",
    "it has been demonstrated that the model , as defined in equations [ eq : defcountingmodel ] and [ eq : modeloconteo_desvstd ] , ensures @xmath55 and @xmath56 , when @xmath57 is the true number of detected events . then by using equation [ eq : estimacionyield ] it is possible to calculate the neutron emission , bearing in mind that the model holds while space charge accumulation in the detector tube does not run so high as to impair linearity . by this methodology",
    ", it has been possible to achieve detection limits almost two orders of magnitude lower than those from state of the art techniques .",
    "the methodology is quite general and could be reproduced by other groups in order to calibrate neutron detectors based on moderated proportional counters for fast neutrons .",
