    "quantum entanglement is one of the central concepts in quantum information theory , and can be viewed as a physical resource for quantum information@xcite . characterizing entanglement is still an open question for many - body system , however , for two - qubit case , the problem is solved by using concurrence which is defined by wootters@xcite . in refs.amico,horodecki,wineland,kitagawa,toth,alekseev,soensen,pu,messikh,wang2009,yin,orgikh , it was found that spin squeezing has a close relation with entanglement , and spin squeezing parameters can be used as entanglement witnesses .",
