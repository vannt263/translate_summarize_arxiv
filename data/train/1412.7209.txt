    "quantum walks @xcite are an important framework to model quantum dynamics , with applications ranging from quantum computation to quantum transport .",
    "being the quantum mechanical analogue of classical random walks , quantum walks can outperform their classical counterparts by exploiting interference in the superposition of the various paths in a graph as well as by taking advantage of quantum correlations and quantum particle statistics between multiple walkers @xcite .",
    "in fact , for multiparticle quantum walks , interactions lead to an efficient simulation of the circuit model of quantum computation @xcite .",
    "quantum walks can be formulated in both the discrete time @xcite and continuous time @xcite frameworks , where the latter can be obtained as a limit of the former @xcite . in this article",
    "we focus on single particle continuous time quantum walks ( ctqws ) , where the knowledge of the adjacency matrix of the graph is sufficient to completely describe the walk .",
    "several interesting algorithms have been developed in this framework @xcite .",
    "in fact , ctqws in sparse unweighted graphs are equivalent to the circuit model of quantum computation , although the corresponding simulation is not efficient @xcite . besides quantum algorithms ,",
    "ctqws are applied in areas such as quantum transport @xcite and state transfer @xcite .    in most ctqw problems ,",
    "the quantity of interest is the population ( or probability amplitude ) at a particular node of the graph .",
    "for example , in the spatial search algorithm @xcite , the purpose is to maximize the probability amplitude at the solution node in the shortest possible time . in the glued trees algorithm demonstrated in @xcite , which has an exponential speed up over its classical counterpart",
    ", the walker traverses the graph therein in order to find an exit node . on the other hand , quantum transport problems involving a single excitation , for example , exciton transport in photosynthetic complexes ,",
    "can be modelled by ctqws @xcite . in such cases ,",
    "the figures of merits are typically the transport efficiency or the transfer time to a special node , known as the _ trap_. as for state transfer , the task is to send a qubit from one point of a spin - network to another with maximum fidelity @xcite . in many of these problems ,",
    "the graph in which the walk takes place possesses some symmetry @xcite which implies that the dynamics of the walker is restricted to a subspace that is smaller than the complete hilbert space spanned by the nodes of the graph . in this work ,",
    "we use invariant subspace methods , that can be computed systematically using lanczos algorithm @xcite , to obtain a reduced model that fully describes the evolution of the probability amplitude at the node we are interested in .",
    "this method involves obtaining the minimal subspace which contains this node and is invariant under the unitary evolution .",
    "this is simply the subspace that contains the node of interest @xmath0 , and all powers of the hamiltonian applied to it , also known as a krylov subspace .",
    "henceforth , this subspace will be denoted by @xmath1 .",
    "this subspace can be systematically obtained without taking into consideration the symmetries of the hamiltonian , using , for example , lanczos algorithm @xcite .",
    "this algorithm iteratively obtains the basis for the invariant subspace : the first basis element is the special node @xmath0 ; the @xmath2th basis element is calculated by applying the hamiltonian to the @xmath3th element and orthonormalizing with respect to the previous basis elements . when expressed in the lanczos basis ,",
    "any hermitian matrix becomes a tridiagonal matrix .",
    "thus , _ any problem in quantum mechanics _ wherein the dynamics is described by a time independent hamiltonian can be mapped to a ctqw on a weighted line , where the nodes are the elements of the lanczos basis . in this way ,",
    "we explore the notion of invariant subspaces to systematically reduce the dimension of the hamiltonian that completely describes the dynamics relevant to our problem .",
    "we use this method to obtain new results on several ctqw problems , as well as re - derive some other known results in a simpler manner .",
    "first , we consider the spatial search algorithm @xcite , which searches for an element contained in one of the @xmath4 nodes of the graph in @xmath5 time , which is optimal @xcite . this algorithm is known to hold optimally for structures such as the complete graph , hypercubes , lattices of dimension greater than four and more recently , for strongly regular graphs @xcite . in two dimensional lattices , the lower bound of @xmath6",
    "could only be achieved when the dispersion relation of the spectrum is linear at a certain energy , i.e. , it contains a dirac point , as in honeycomb ( e.g. graphene ) lattices @xcite , and crystal lattices @xcite .",
    "however , the characteristics that a graph must possess , in general , for this algorithm to run optimally remains an open question .",
    "in fact in @xcite , where the authors present a different spatial search algorithm based on the divide and conquer approach , their main criticism towards the ctqw version of the spatial search was the fact that an upper bound on the running time is unknown even if `` minor defects are introduced '' . here , we show that the algorithm runs optimally on the complete graph with imperfections in the form of broken links , and also for complete bipartite graphs ( cbg ) . in both cases ,",
    "the graphs are , in general non - regular , i.e. not all the nodes of the graph have the same degree .",
    "a particular case of the cbg is the star graph where @xmath7 nodes are connected only to a central node , which is a planar structure with link connectivity one .",
    "thus , this example shows that high connectivity is not a requirement for optimal quantum search .",
    "moreover , on removing @xmath8 links , such that @xmath9 , from a star graph , the emerging graph is robust as it preserves its star connectivity and search is still optimal provided that the broken link does not contain the solution . in all the graphs mentioned thus far , the hamiltonian of dimension @xmath4 , describing the dynamics of the algorithm , can be reduced to a hamiltonian of dimension at most four .",
    "the dynamics , driven by this reduced hamiltonian , can be viewed as a ctqw on a smaller graph , which provides an intuitive picture of the algorithm , similar to a quantum transport problem .",
    "it is worth noting that the reduced hamiltonians presented here describe the dynamics of the problem exactly and are not obtained by approximating the search hamiltonian at the avoided crossing as in @xcite .",
    "thus , this is a simple way to analyse the algorithm that , in some cases , allows us to understand why search is optimal in a certain graph without having to explicitly calculate the eigenstates of the hamiltonian .",
    "furthermore , we consider quantum transport on a graph , where an exciton is to be transferred from one node to a special node where it gets absorbed , known as the trap @xcite . in the scenario",
    "where there is no disorder , decoherence or losses , it was shown in @xcite that the transport efficiency is given by the overlap of the initial condition with the eigenstates having a non - zero overlap with the trap .",
    "we prove that this subspace is the same as the invariant subspace @xmath10 .",
    "this observation allows us to compute transport efficiencies without having to diagonalize the hamiltonian .",
    "we calculate the efficiency in the complete graph ( cg ) with this method ( obtaining the same result as in @xcite , which uses the eigenstates of the graph ) .",
    "furthermore , we obtain the transport efficiency on binary trees and hypercubes as a function of the number of generations and dimension respectively , for various initial conditions .",
    "finally , we show that the efficiency in all these structures increases on average , when a few links are broken randomly from the graph .",
    "a particularly interesting example is the one of breaking the link from the complete graph which connects the initial and trap nodes .",
    "in such a case , the efficiency increases to 1 , in the absence of decoherence and losses , irrespective of the size of the network . for this case , we also calculate analytically the trapping time , which does not depend on @xmath4 .",
    "this counter - intuitive result can be interpreted by looking at the reduced subspace of the graph , where the problem reduces to an end to end transport in a line of three nodes .",
    "similar results were obtained in @xcite , in the context of state transfer , although different methods were used for the analysis of the problem .",
    "overall , the instances presented herein show that even small perturbation to the symmetry of a structure leads to a drastic improvement of the transport efficiency in the absence of decoherence . when decoherence is present , the effect of geometry in the transport efficiency was numerically studied in @xcite , for random disordered structures .",
    "finally , we connect the results obtained for transport to the problem of state transfer in a quantum network . in the single excitation framework , the state transfer problem is equivalent to a ctqw of a single particle .",
    "we show that the fidelity of transferring an excitation from one node of the network @xmath2 to another node @xmath11 , is upper bounded by the square root of the transport efficiency in the analogous transport problem wherein @xmath2 is the initial state and @xmath11 is the trap node .",
    "this gives a simple way to upper bound the fidelity of transferring a qubit in any spin network .",
    "overall , we demonstrate that dimensionality reduction using the notion of invariant subspaces can be a useful tool to analyse ctqw based problems . by mapping a qw problem on a graph to one on a much smaller structure , the analysis of the problem becomes easier and the dynamics of the walk can be intuitively understood .",
    "krylov subspace methods and the lanczos algorithm for the analysis of ctqws have also been used in @xcite , but different results were obtained therein . in the discrete time framework , the role of symmetry and invariant subspaces were studied in @xcite .",
    "krylov subspace approaches were used to analyse adiabatic quantum search on structured database in @xcite , and to obtain bounds for information propagation on lattices in @xcite . the notion of invariant subspaces",
    "is also exploited in @xcite to simplify the analysis of parametrized hamiltonians of quantum many body systems .",
    "this paper is structured as follows : in sec .  _ methods _ , the systematic method to obtain the reduced subspace @xmath12 is demonstrated .",
    "_ results _ comprises of the various applications of the reduction method , namely in quantum spatial search , quantum transport and state transfer .",
    "finally , we present our conclusions in sec . _",
    "* _ dimensionality reduction of continuous time quantum walks _ : * let us consider a graph @xmath13 of @xmath4 nodes , where @xmath14 is the set of nodes and @xmath15 , the set of links .",
    "the adjacency matrix @xmath16 of @xmath13 is of dimension @xmath17 and is defined as follows : @xmath18 formally , a ctqw on the graph @xmath13 takes place on a hilbert space @xmath19 of dimension @xmath4 that is spanned by the nodes of the graph @xmath20 with @xmath21 .",
    "a particle starting in a state @xmath22 evolves according to the schrdinger equation where the hamiltonian @xmath23 that governs the system dynamics is the adjacency matrix , i.e. , @xmath24 .",
    "after time @xmath25 , the particle is in the state @xmath26 and the probability that the walker is in node @xmath27 is given by @xmath28 .",
    "the unitary evolution of the state @xmath29 can be expressed as @xmath30 so @xmath31 is contained in the subspace @xmath32 .",
    "this subspace of @xmath19 is invariant under the action of the hamiltonian and thus also of the unitary evolution .",
    "trivially , the dimension of this subspace is at most @xmath4 .",
    "however , if the hamiltonian is highly symmetrical , only a small number of powers of @xmath33 are linearly independent and the dimension of @xmath34 can be much smaller than @xmath4 .",
    "thus , we can reduce the dimension of the problem in the following way .",
    "let @xmath35 be the projector onto @xmath34 .",
    "then @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the reduced hamiltonian . in the derivation we used the fact that @xmath38 , @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "now , for any state @xmath41 , we have @xmath42 where , the reduced state , @xmath43 . the same reasoning could be applied using the projector @xmath44 onto the subspace @xmath45 , in which case we obtain @xmath46 with @xmath47 and @xmath48 . this way ,",
    "a reduced hamiltonian can be obtained which can be seen as the hamiltonian of a weighted graph that in some cases , can be much simpler than the original graph we started with . here",
    ", @xmath49 can be the solution node for search algorithms , the trap for quantum transport and the target node for state transfer problems ( see sec .",
    "_ results _ ) .    a systematic way to calculate an orthonormal basis of @xmath45 is given by lanczos algorithm @xcite .",
    "this basis , which we denote by @xmath50 , can be obtained as follows : the first element is @xmath51 ; the @xmath52 element @xmath53 is obtained by orthonormalizing @xmath54 with respect to the subspace spanned by @xmath55 .",

    "this way , one avoids the cost of preparing the initial superposition of states @xmath89 to run the algorithm .",
    "furthermore , for the star graph , it is easy to analyse the robustness of the algorithm to imperfections in the graph in the form of broken links since the graph obtained after removing @xmath8 links is still a star graph .",
    "we assume @xmath8 links can be randomly broken so that we possess no knowledge of the links that were broken , nor of the value of @xmath8 .",

    "the total hamiltonian describing the dynamics is given by @xmath208 where @xmath16 is the adjacency matrix of the graph .",
    "the scenario assumed here is the ideal one , i.e , there is no disorder in the couplings or site energies of the hamiltonian nor decoherence during the transport . in this regime , in @xcite , the authors calculate the transport efficiency as the overlap of the initial state with the subspace spanned by the eigenstates of the hamiltonian that have a non - zero overlap with the trap . earlier in sec .",

    "we calculate the average transport efficiency by projecting the initial state , onto the subspace @xmath10 for each of the possible configurations of the graph with @xmath262 broken links and average over all of them .",
    "the initial state is set as as a statistical mixture of all nodes for the complete graph and the hypercube , while it is a statistical mixture of all leaf nodes in the case of a binary tree .",

    "note that this approach is much faster than diagonalizing the graph hamiltonian and finding the overlap of the initial state with the eigenstates having non - zero overlap with the trap .",
    "for all these structures , we observe that the average transport efficiency always improves by breaking a few links from the graph .",
    "this can be attributed to the fact that by breaking a small number of links , the symmetry is reduced and the dimension of the subspace to which the dynamics is restricted increases .",
    "thus , this can be thought of as increasing the number of possible paths from the starting node to the trap , which previously lied outside this space owing to symmetry .",
    "however , we expect that when the number of broken links is comparable to the total number of links in the graph , the size of the reduced space would be very low as the trap gets decoupled from the graph in a large number of configurations , and hence the efficiency is low .",

    "we show that the square root of the efficiencies obtained for transport in various graphs are also upper bounds for the fidelity of the equivalent state transfer problem in the same graph .",
    "thus , all the results obtained for quantum transport can be can also be interpreted in the context of qubit transfer in a network . in particular , we conclude that the fidelity of state transfer can be enhanced by removing links in the network .",

    "if our initial state is @xmath20 , the fidelity of transfer to a node @xmath0 is upper bounded by the overlap of @xmath20 with the subspace @xmath276 , since this is an invariant subspace of the hamiltonian . this way , @xmath277 where @xmath278 is the projection operator onto @xmath276 . but as @xmath279 ( the efficiency of transport in the graph defined by @xmath269 starting from a localized state @xmath20 ) , the fidelity of transfer to state @xmath20 is bounded by @xmath280 .",

    "the efficiency of transporting an exciton from a starting node to the trap is given by @xmath349 now , @xmath350 using the schrdinger equation to replace @xmath351 , @xmath352 thus , @xmath353 this is using the fact that the anti - hermitian term of the hamiltonian reduces the norm of the state @xmath31 at the rate @xmath205 and for @xmath354 , the component of the wave function within @xmath10 gets absorbed completely and hence @xmath355 .",
    "this implies that to calculate the transport efficiency of an exciton starting from an initial state to a trap , it suffices to calculate the overlap of the initial state with @xmath1 .",
