    "the first listing of three unidentified ( uid ) features around 1369    and along the ` classic ' diffuse interstellar sight line toward @xmath0  oph was provided by @xcite .",
    "their listing included two lines at 1368.74 and 1370.87   , as well as the feature @xmath111369.13 , which according to their remark , resembled a diffuse interstellar band ( dib ) by virtue of its uncommon larger and asymmetric width .",
    "this proposition was studied further by @xcite , who introduced the uid1 through uid3 nomenclature for these features and suggested that uid2 at 1369.13    is probably the first ultraviolet ( uv ) analog of the optical dibs .",
    "@xcite showed that as far as equivalent width ( @xmath15 ) is concerned , uid2 has a better correlation with @xmath15(co ) than with @xmath15 ( ) , or with and column densities ( @xmath16 ) along six diffuse sight lines .",
    "their conclusion was that uid2 most probably arises in a denser , molecular medium .",
    "@xcite performed a rigorous re - analysis of room - temperature laboratory data of ch that was published by @xcite .",
    "he showed that an assignment of the uid trio observed toward @xmath0  oph to ch is very plausible on the grounds of wavelength coincidence and approximate intensity or transition strengths .",
    "specifically , the assignment was to the @xmath1@xmath2@xmath3 band of ch , which was first observed in the laboratory by @xcite , who classified it as the the first member ( @xmath17 = 3 ) of the @xmath18 rydberg series . moreover",
    ", the defining characteristic of uid2 , it being appreciably wider than other uid and identified absorption lines , could be explained as arising from heterogeneous predissociation of the rydberg states of ch , including the @xmath1(@xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 ) , or 3@xmath22 , complex of three states .",
    "the phenomenon of prominent lorentzian wings signaling the extremely short lifetime of the upper state is well known in rydberg transitions of , e.g. , co @xcite , when closely - spaced rotational lines blend into each other more strongly in bands that arise from states with faster predissociation rates , or wider wings .    here",
    "we show that an identification of the uid features around 1369    with @xmath4@xmath2@xmath3 rydberg transitions in ch is consistent with the expected range of @xmath5-values and with known @xmath16(ch ) values , as well as with line broadening arising from predissociation .",
    "this is accomplished by utilizing profile synthesis to model the observed line shapes and absorption strengths in high - resolution ( high-@xmath23 ) _ hubble space telescope _ ( _ hst _ ) spectra .",
    "furthermore , we were able to detect and analyze the @xmath111271 uid feature introduced by @xcite , which @xcite conjectured to be the strongest transition in the @xmath12@xmath2@xmath3 band , the second member in the @xmath18 rydberg series of ch @xcite .",
    "indeed , our spectral syntheses show that this uid is also consistent with theoretical predictions for the band @xmath5-value , and with observed values of @xmath16(ch ) .",
    "finally , we conducted a deliberate search for additional spectral signatures of ch based on the previous laboratory work of @xcite . according to their table 15 ,",
    "the bands @xmath14@xmath2@xmath3 at 1694   , @xmath24@xmath2@xmath3 at 1557   , and @xmath13@xmath2@xmath3 at 1549    may be detected in the interstellar medium via their vacuum uv ( vuv ) transitions from a @xmath25 component of the @xmath26@xmath27 = 1/2 level of the @xmath28 ground state .",
    "our search resulted in positive detections of the @xmath13@xmath2@xmath3 and the @xmath14@xmath2@xmath3 bands , but none of the @xmath24@xmath2@xmath3 band .",
    "a note concerning spectroscopic notation and molecular predissociation is in order .",
    "the diatomic molecule s rotation is designated by @xmath29 , with @xmath16 being its component that is perpendicular to the internuclear axis of symmetry .",
    "radiative dipole transitions between lower ( @xmath26@xmath27,@xmath30@xmath27 ) and upper ( @xmath26,@xmath30 ) levels obey @xmath31@xmath29 = @xmath26 @xmath2 @xmath26@xmath27 = 0 , @xmath61 .",
    "such transitions are designated by a primary letter @xmath23 , @xmath32 , or @xmath33 for @xmath31@xmath29 = + 1 , 0 , or @xmath21 , respectively .",
    "in addition , a superscripted @xmath34 , @xmath23 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 , or @xmath35 stand for @xmath31@xmath16 = @xmath30 @xmath2 @xmath30@xmath27 = + 2 , + 1 , 0 , @xmath21 , or @xmath22 , respectively . for @xmath31@xmath16 = @xmath31@xmath29 transitions the superscripted letter will repeat the primary letter , and is thus customarily omitted .",
    "electronic states with angular momentum greater than 0 , i.e. , non-@xmath36 states , interact with the nuclear spin to produce @xmath25-doubling of their rotational levels .",
    "thus the @xmath28 ground state has two @xmath25 levels 0.11 cm@xmath9 ( 1.4 km s@xmath9 ) apart , which are selectively connected by allowed transitions to upper states .",
    "figure 1 indicates the transitions analyzed here . owing to space limitations ,",
    "@xmath25 levels and individual @xmath26 = @xmath30 @xmath6 1/2 levels are not shown , while @xmath30 level separations are shown in a highly magnified and schematic way .",
    "since we show those levels involved with transitions discussed here , only the lowest @xmath30 level for each state is properly positioned with respect to the excitation energy axis .",
    "once a transition to an upper electronic state has occurred , the strength of overlap between state wavefunctions determines the probability of radiationless predissociation .",
    "if the predissociation occurs via a state of similar electronic character , it is called homogeneous , and the rate will not vary strongly with @xmath26 of the predissociated state . otherwise , heterogeneous predissociation occurs between states of differing characters , and a strong dependence on @xmath26 is observed .",
    "our sample of 13 sight lines is obtained from spectra acquired with the space telescope imaging spectrograph ( stis ) and the goddard high - resolution spectrograph ( ghrs ) .",
    "we analyzed the data , which are available from the _ hst _ archive , in order to derive @xmath4@xmath2@xmath3 @xmath5-values for @xmath11@xmath111368 , 1369 , and 1370 along 12 lines of sight .",
    "we obtained smaller samples of sight lines to be analyzed in the search for additional ch absorption features from its @xmath12@xmath2@xmath3 , @xmath13@xmath2@xmath3 , and @xmath14@xmath2@xmath3 bands .",
    "whenever multiple exposures were available , we combined them in wavelength space for an improved signal to noise ( s / n ) ratio .",
    "in addition , when a feature ( band ) appeared in two adjacent orders , we combined them after correcting for any small wavelength inconsistencies .",
    "all our reductions were in iraf and stsdas .",
    "although it is known that the stis line spread function ( lsf ) possesses weak wings , we could not see any obvious signatures for such wings in the highest-@xmath23 data .",
    "( the fact that @xmath4@xmath2@xmath3 @xmath111369 looks wider than other lines shows that this characteristic can not be attributed to a global effect caused by prominent instrumental wings . )",
    "therefore , we used a single gaussian to describe the instrumental profile of stis , in agreement with the findings of @xcite . nevertheless , the stis handbook does show that the lsf wings have a larger role in the profile for wider slits . as a result",
    ", we did allow for @xmath23 to be a fitted parameter during modeling of co absorption lines ( bands ) taken from the same spectra used here .",
    "we found that @xmath23 is lower for data taken through wider slits , and vice versa .",
    "there is a good match between the range of resolving powers for a given slit and the range found by @xcite .",
    "we will discuss these findings in a forthcoming publication about the co molecule .",
    "table 1 provides a list of sight lines in terms of the star observed , its spectral type and galactic direction , as well as the literature values for total @xmath38(ch ) , total @xmath16(ch ) , and cloud structure fractions along each line of sight . for the first three sight lines , as well as the ninth",
    ", we use our latest @xmath16(ch ) results based on modeling with ismod.f ( see below ) of high-@xmath23 ( @xmath39 170,000 ) optical spectra from mcdonald observatory .",
    "for the two stars in common , @xmath40 and @xmath0 per , our results agree within 5% with those of @xcite .",
    "a more detailed description of the new optical syntheses will be provided in a future publication .",
    "all @xmath16(ch ) determinations to date have utilized the @xmath41@xmath2@xmath28 4300.313  ``line '' , which is a @xmath25-doublet of two @xmath23(1/2 ) transitions only 1.4 km s@xmath9 apart @xcite .",
    "table 2 lists the instrumental source for the vuv data , dataset names , exposure times , s / n ratios , fitted values for the spectral resolving power , @xmath23 ( from fits of co absorption present in the same spectra ) , and ch bands detected in the _ hst _ data .",
    "all line profiles analyzed in this paper were modeled by spectrum synthesis using y. s.s code , ismod.f .",
    "the basic radiative transfer equations in this code are taken from @xcite .",
    "fit parameters include radial velocity , @xmath16(ch ) , @xmath5-value , line width , and cloud component structure , which involves relative velocities , fractional abundances , and doppler @xmath42-values .",
    "both @xmath16(ch ) and the cloud component structure were known a priori for each sight line and were kept fixed during the ch fits .",
    "ismod.f employs the voigt profile to describe the line shape as a combination of a gaussian doppler core and lorentzian wings .",
    "the resulting profile is then convolved with the appropriate instrumental gaussian profile before a comparison with the data is performed via root - mean - square computation .",
    "ismod.f employs the simplex method to converge onto the final fit , which is found by an automated trial and error inspection of the parameter space in decreasing steps , until a certain tolerance level ( usually 10@xmath43 of the parameter s value ) has been reached .",
    "figure 2 shows the data and ismod.f profile syntheses of the three @xmath4@xmath2@xmath3 lines toward the star x  per .",
    "we first compare a pertinent selection of our results with previously published values .",
    "most of the work done previously concerned the well - known sight line toward @xmath0  oph .",
    "our results from profile syntheses of @xmath11@xmath111368 , 1369 , and 1370 show that fitted @xmath15 values for the three lines are 5.6 @xmath6 0.2 , 7.5 @xmath6 0.2 , and 2.2 @xmath6 0.3 m , respectively , where our uncertainties reflect noise contribution over the extent of the profile from the expression fwhm/(s / n ) . when compared to the two previous publications , our @xmath44 and @xmath45 agree more with ( * ? ? ?",
    "* @xmath6 0.58 , 4.59 @xmath6 0.74 , and 1.16 @xmath6 0.39 m , respectively ) , while our @xmath46 agrees more with ( * ? ? ?",
    "* @xmath6 0.80 , 5.89 @xmath6 0.89 , and 0.84 @xmath6 0.59 m , respectively ) .",
    "it is possible that our @xmath15 values are larger because they include more of the contribution of the wide wings that arise in predissociation .",
    "when wide wings are unknowingly present , their depression of the local continuum might be assumed to arise in the continuum itself ( e.g. , owing to stellar undulations ) .",
    "special care should be taken to preserve such wings during the rectification process , but this is hard to accomplish for data with low s / n .",
    "@xcite measured @xmath46 toward six stars , of which three sight lines are in common with this study .",
    "therefore , we may compare our synthesized @xmath15 values ( in m ) with those of @xcite : x  per , 8.0 @xmath6 0.3 vs. 8.4 ; @xmath0  oph , 7.5 @xmath6 0.2 vs. 6.3 ; and @xmath11  cep , 7.5 @xmath6 0.5 vs. 6.9 .",
    "there are no major disagreements between the two sets of values .",
    "note that for the @xmath0  oph sight line , the value from @xcite is also higher than those from @xcite and @xcite .",
    "@xcite have been the only authors to report the presence of the @xmath111271 feature , in the direction of @xmath0  oph .",
    "their reported value was @xmath15 = 0.75 @xmath6 0.19 m , while our fitted result is 1.1 @xmath6 0.1 m .",
    "the latter agrees within 2 @xmath47 of the earlier value .",
    "an absorption line is produced by the combined action of @xmath16 absorbers per @xmath48 along the line of sight , each removing photons from the beam at the transition wavelength ( @xmath11 in  ) at a rate that corresponds to an oscillator strength , or @xmath5-value .",
    "the mutual product @xmath49 appears in the equation that determines the optical depth in the transition , which then generates the @xmath15 of the line profile through exponential absorption along the line of sight .",
    "it is customary to have at hand transitions with known @xmath5-values that consequently allow the determination of @xmath16 of the absorbers . here ,",
    "on the other hand , we use the known values of @xmath16(ch ) from 12 sight lines to determine the @xmath5-values for @xmath11@xmath111368 , 1369 , and 1370 .",
    "table 3 provides the results of our spectrum syntheses for the three @xmath4@xmath2@xmath3 lines toward our target stars : fitted @xmath15 , @xmath5-values , and inferred intrinsic lorentzian line widths ( see more about the width in the next section ) .",
    "normally , @xmath16(ch ) is determined from the @xmath50@xmath2@xmath3 doublet of @xmath26@xmath27 = 1/2 transitions at 4300.313   , where the two blended @xmath25 levels have their populations combined . indeed ,",
    "ultra - high-@xmath23 spectra at 4300    ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) sometimes resolve the 1.4 km s@xmath9 doublet , revealing equal populations for the two components . here",
    ", we emphasize that each of our profile syntheses employs only half the value of @xmath16(ch ) ( taken from table 1 ) because in all resonance transitions to higher ( than @xmath50 ) electronic states of ch , the individual @xmath25 components are well separated ( see * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "therefore , the @xmath5-values derived here are twice as large as they would have been , had the full value of @xmath16(ch ) been used . within the uncertainties listed ,",
    "there is good agreement among all sight lines for each @xmath5-value .",
    "non - weighted means for the three lines are @xmath5(1368 ) = 0.019 @xmath6 0.003 , @xmath5(1369 ) = 0.030 @xmath6 0.005 , and @xmath5(1370 ) = 0.009 @xmath6 0.001 . for these averages we used fit results from the higher-@xmath23 stis spectra , while avoiding 2 ( in the case of @xmath111369 ) or 3 ( otherwise ) sight lines from lower-@xmath23 ghrs exposures .",
    "low-@xmath23 data do not provide as good a handle on intrinsic line profiles as do high-@xmath23 data , both in the reduction ( i.e. , continuum rectification ) stage and in the modeling stage .",
    "had we used the excluded results , the average @xmath5-values would have increased by 11% , 10% , and 3% , respectively .",
    "thus the sum of the stis - derived @xmath5-values for the three transitions is 0.058 @xmath6 0.006 , which according to @xcite is providing some 76% of the total @xmath5-value of the @xmath4@xmath2@xmath3 band , because the three lines are the most prominent transitions in it . with the correction ,",
    "this rydberg band has a total @xmath5-value of 0.076 @xmath6 0.008 , as inferred by our interstellar measurements .",
    "@xcite derived a preliminary @xmath5-value for the @xmath4@xmath2@xmath3 band from the sum of @xmath15 of the three lines in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* m ) , employing @xmath16(ch ) = 10@xmath51 @xmath52 from @xcite , and the expression for unsaturated line absorption , @xmath53 , from @xcite . from this value ,",
    "@xmath5 = 0.025 , which was not based on any profile spectral synthesis , @xcite estimated the total band @xmath5-value to be 0.033 .",
    "( we estimate that the uncertainties associated with @xcite s @xmath5-values amount to 20% , based on the @xmath15 uncertainties in @xcite ) both values appear to be too low by a factor of 2.3 @xmath6 0.5 when compared to our results . however , watson s determination was based on the full value of the @xmath16(ch ) , whereas in our modeling we use @xmath16(ch)/2 , which is pertinent for the population of a single @xmath25-doubling level , see above . correcting @xcite s estimate upward by a factor of 2 ,",
    "we get @xmath5 @xmath39 0.050 @xmath6 0.010 for the sum of three lines , and @xmath5 @xmath39 0.066 @xmath6 0.013 for the entire @xmath4@xmath2@xmath3 band .",
    "this happens to be in much better agreement with our rigorous spectrum synthesis results .",
    "only two theoretical ab initio band @xmath5-values exist in the literature : 0.0467 from ( * ? ? ?",
    "* not 0.0362 as per @xcite ) , and 0.069 from @xcite .",
    "it appears that both our astronomically - derived band @xmath5-value , and the @xcite value when corrected upward by a factor of 2 , are in good agreement with the theoretical value calculated by @xcite , thus bolstering the case for identifying these three lines with the ch molecule .",
    "this measurement also shows @xmath4@xmath2@xmath3 to be the ch band with the largest @xmath5-value .",
    "perhaps this is what @xcite meant when they commented that @xmath1@xmath2@xmath3 lines would be the strongest interstellar lines of ch .      as mentioned in the previous section , table 3 provides information about the lorentzian line width derived in our modeling .",
    "the intrinsic line width is set by the lifetime of the transition s upper level , according to the inverse quantum mechanical relationship between lifetime ( limiting the interval of measurement ) and line width ( resulting uncertainty in measured energy ) .",
    "normally , intrinsic line widths are unobservable owing to the relatively `` long '' lifetimes of radiative transitions ; @xmath54 10@xmath55 s yields a width of 0.01 m  or less , using the relationship @xmath56 ^ 2/(1.884\\times10^{16}\\tau ) .",
    "$ ] predissociation generates much shorter lifetimes for certain rydberg states , owing to decay rates that may readily be 10@xmath57 times faster than radiative decay rates . under such circumstances ,",
    "the associated lifetime would be 10@xmath58 s , leading to line widths of the order of 10 m , which can be measured on high-@xmath23 ( @xmath39 100,000 ) spectra with the help of profile synthesis .",
    "we estimate that in our highest-@xmath23 data it is possible to reliably extract @xmath59 widths of a few m , which correspond to decay rates that are higher than a few @xmath7 10@xmath10 s@xmath9 . for @xmath5-value syntheses that failed to converge onto a reliable @xmath59 solution , we fixed the line width to a value near the average from well - converged solutions .",
    "the predissociation decay rate , @xmath60 , is the inverse of @xmath61 , and thus is directly proportional to @xmath59 .",
    "we use both @xmath60 and @xmath59 as descriptors of line width in terms of lorentzian wings .",
    "modeling the three @xmath4@xmath2@xmath3 lines with ismod.f returned values for the lorentzian width in inverse lifetimes ( s@xmath9 ) , which are tabulated in table 3 .",
    "we computed the means from all sight lines with high-@xmath23 ( non - ghrs ) determinations and derived the following predissociation rates : @xmath60(1368 ) = ( 1.5 @xmath6 0.3 ) @xmath7 10@xmath8 s@xmath9 , @xmath60(1369 ) = ( 3.8 @xmath6 0.7 ) @xmath7 10@xmath8 s@xmath9 , and @xmath60(1370 ) = ( 1.1 @xmath6 0.6 ) @xmath7 10@xmath10 s@xmath9 .",
    "it can be seen that all data sets returned a well - defined line width for @xmath111369 , thanks to its larger @xmath59 , but that only a few syntheses were successful in converging onto a @xmath59 solution for @xmath111370 , the profile with the narrowest wings .",
    "in fact , whereas average @xmath60 values for both @xmath111368 and @xmath111369 are better than the 2.5 @xmath47 detection level , @xmath60 for @xmath111370 is a @xmath62 2 @xmath47 result .",
    "it is thus possible that the width of @xmath111370 has not been reliably determined , and that a 3 @xmath47 upper limit of @xmath39 3 @xmath7 10@xmath10 s@xmath9 for @xmath60(1370 ) should be used instead .",
    "according to the @xmath59@xmath61 relationship , the corresponding lorentzian profile widths of the three @xmath4@xmath2@xmath3 lines are 11.6 , 38.4 , and 1.1 m , which correspond to 0.62 , 2.05 , and 0.06 cm@xmath9 .",
    "@xcite used the value 2.6 cm@xmath9 for the width of @xmath111369 , which was based on the value of 10.7 km s@xmath9 in @xcite .",
    "we also note that the original observation of @xmath111369 toward @xmath0  oph was described as showing an asymmetric profile . here , our impression from the entire sample of sight lines is that the observed profiles of @xmath111369 are very consistent with formation by a single transition , i.e. , there are no indications for asymmetries in the line profile , especially in higher-@xmath23 data .",
    "theory has no definite bearing on these @xmath60 values , yet .",
    "remarked that although predissociation is present in all bands studied by @xcite , for most bands , including the @xmath4@xmath2@xmath3 band at 1370   , it is heterogeneous .",
    "thus the predissociation rate may approach an estimated value of 10@xmath10 s@xmath9 for @xmath30 = 10 , but is estimated to be about 10@xmath63 s@xmath9 for low @xmath30 , i.e. , of the order of the radiative decay rate of the state .",
    "these estimates are not rigorous enough to be more accurate that an order of magnitude . indeed ,",
    "our fits and @xcite s initial probe do show that in the case of both @xmath111368 and @xmath111369 there is a substantial contribution to ch photodissociation , since their @xmath60 values are much higher than what @xcite had suggested . according to @xcite ,",
    "all three lines are @xmath30 = 2 transitions .",
    "figure 2 shows that there is good agreement between our models and observed line profiles . for @xmath111369",
    ", there is no need to invoke an analogy to the dibs in the optical , because we see that very good fits are obtained using a single transition with broad predissociation lorentzian wings .",
    "in addition to agreeing with @xcite that ch is a very good assignment for @xmath11@xmath111368 , 1369 , and 1370 , one may also conclude that vuv analogs of the optical dibs have yet to be detected .",
    "our inspection of archival stis data returned four candidate sight lines with @xmath111271 features that appear to be astronomical detections of the strongest transition in @xmath12@xmath2@xmath3 .",
    "the sight lines are toward x  per ( shown in figure 3 ) , @xmath0  oph , hd  203532 , and hd  207308 , as listed in table 4 . despite varying values of s / n and @xmath23",
    ", all four spectrum syntheses returned rather consistent solutions , @xmath5 = 0.007 @xmath6 0.002 .",
    "this @xmath5-value is smaller than that for @xmath111369 , the strongest @xmath4@xmath2@xmath3 transition with @xmath5 of 0.030 @xmath6 0.005 reported above .",
    "a theoretical prediction from @xcite gives @xmath5-values of 0.0198 and 0.0186 for the @xmath21 and @xmath20 states in the @xmath12 complex , respectively .",
    "if we assume that the total band @xmath5-value is 2.5 times the value of its strongest transition , as we find for the @xmath4@xmath2@xmath3 band complex and @xmath111369 , then from the @xmath5-value for @xmath111271 we expect @xmath5 @xmath39 0.0175 for the entire @xmath12@xmath2@xmath3 band .",

    "three sight lines with either the highest @xmath23 or the highest s / n values yielded solutions for @xmath59 , while for hd  207308 the fit did not converge onto a reliable lorentzian line width . with an average of @xmath60 = ( 2.5 @xmath6 1.5 )",

    "( since the @xmath13 state is also of a @xmath19 character , the same hlfs should apply in @xmath13@xmath2@xmath3 and @xmath69@xmath2@xmath3 transitions . )",
    "the line of sight toward hd  23478 shows only the strongest feature from the @xmath13@xmath2@xmath3 band , i.e. , the blend @xmath111549.05 .",
    "the averages of our fitted @xmath5-values , based on the known values of @xmath16(ch)/2 , are @xmath5(1549.05 ) = 0.021 @xmath6 0.006 and @xmath5(1549.62 ) = 0.013 @xmath6 0.003 .",
    "the @xmath5-value ratio is 1.6 @xmath6 0.6 for @xmath111549.05 vs. @xmath111549.62 .",
    "based on the actual transitions that constitute these lines and their individual hlf values , the predicted @xmath5-value ratio is 1.5 , showing good agreement with our measurements .",
    "the total @xmath5-value of @xmath111549.05 equals the total band @xmath5-value , according to the sum of hlfs , or 4/3 + 2/3 = 6/3 . here",
    "we derive a sum of @xmath5 = 0.021 @xmath6 0.006 , whereas @xcite and @xcite theoretically computed values of 0.031 and 0.0095 , respectively .",
    "our value lies between the predicted @xmath5-values , about a factor of 2 from either one .",
    "there is another potentially detectable @xmath26@xmath27 = 1/2 absorption line belonging to the @xmath13@xmath2@xmath3 band , @xmath70 at 1547.87    @xcite .",
    "we were not able to detect it owing to blending with the blue wing of the much stronger line of at 1548.204   .",
    "according to its hlf of 2/3 , the @xmath70 transition would constitute the weakest @xmath26@xmath27 = 1/2 absorption line .",
    "since we measure two lines composed of the three strongest transitions with verified @xmath5-value ratios , these first astronomical detections of the @xmath13@xmath2@xmath3 band of ch seem secure .",
    "we also extracted lorentzian widths for the absorption lines of the @xmath13@xmath2@xmath3 band , as listed in table 4 . as is the case for the lines of the @xmath4@xmath2@xmath3 band , under conditions of high-@xmath23",
    "the lines readily show that different predissociation widths are involved , confirming @xcite s observation of heterogeneous predissociation for @xmath13@xmath2@xmath3 .",
    "also in a similar fashion to @xmath4@xmath2@xmath3 , the strongest line in the band appears to be the widest .",
    "thus , for the blend @xmath66 + @xmath67 at 1549.05   , we find @xmath60 = ( 2.7 @xmath6 1.3 ) @xmath7 10@xmath8 s@xmath9 , whereas @xmath60 for @xmath65 at 1549.62    is ( 1.6 @xmath6 0.9 ) @xmath7 10@xmath10 s@xmath9 . a golden rule approximation by @xcite yielded a computed @xmath60 of 7.6 @xmath7 10@xmath71 s@xmath9 for the @xmath30 = 1 levels of the @xmath13 state , with a stated uncertainty of `` an order of magnitude '' . the two transitions with @xmath30 = 1 ( @xmath66 and @xmath67 ) are those that make up the blend at @xmath111549.05 , for which we find @xmath60 that is larger by 1.5 orders of magnitude than the approximate prediction .",
    "we attempted a more detailed spectrum synthesis of @xmath111549.05 toward x  per that explicitly included the two transitions @xmath66 and @xmath67 , subject to the constraint of a 2:1 ratio in their hlf values .",
    "although the fit returned a separation of @xmath26.2 km s@xmath9 for the weaker @xmath67 relative to @xmath66 , we take this to be an upper limit because the fit yielded a solution with residuals that are somewhat smaller that the ambient noise level away from the feature .",
    "the actual energy level splitting in the @xmath64 state that controls the velocity separation between the two @xmath111549.05 transitions is unknown , but we note that the @xmath69@xmath2@xmath3 band has its @xmath67 line located 2.2 km s@xmath9 to the blue of @xmath66 @xcite .",
    "this detailed synthesis of the @xmath66 + @xmath67 blend resulted in narrower lorentzian wings for the two transitions and ( predictably ) lower @xmath5-values relative to the single - transition model .",
    "it returned @xmath5(@xmath66 ) = 0.010 and @xmath5(@xmath67 ) = 0.005 , i.e. , a sum that is 12% smaller than the @xmath5-value fitted for the entire blend , and decay rates @xmath60 = 1.3 @xmath7 10@xmath8 and 1.1 @xmath7 10@xmath8 s@xmath9 , for @xmath66 and @xmath67 , respectively .",
    "these lower @xmath60 values are still higher than the approximate prediction of @xcite .",
    "the similarity in decay rates for the two transitions is inconsistent with their @xmath26 levels of 1/2 ( for @xmath66 ) and 3/2 ( for @xmath67 ) , because heterogeneous predissociation is normally revealed by @xmath59 having a dependence on @xmath29(@xmath29 + 1 ) , i.e. , we expect @xmath67 to be 5 times wider than @xmath66 .",
    "since detailed modeling attempts for other sight lines did not return separations and widths for the blended components that were in good agreement with the x  per result , the quality of the data must be insufficient for such detailed modeling , especially when the line separation is not available as a known input value .",
    "this band was observed by @xcite , who remarked on the relative weakness of its @xmath32-branch and the apparent diffuse nature of its lines . a single sight line , that toward x  per , exhibits an absorption feature that is consistent with a detection of @xmath111695.34 , the strongest feature in @xmath14@xmath2@xmath3 ( see figure 5 and table 4 ) . here",
    "the strongest feature is also an unresolved blend of the two transitions @xmath66 and @xmath67 @xcite .",
    "furthermore , a shallower feature in the spectrum is consistent with the position of the @xmath70 @xmath111693.24 transition of @xmath14@xmath2@xmath3 , although it is partially blended with a stronger @xmath111693.29 line , see figure 6 . upon modeling , the known @xmath16(ch)/2 toward x  per returns @xmath5-values of 0.0038 @xmath6 0.0011 and 0.0012 @xmath6 0.0006 for @xmath66 + @xmath67 and @xmath70 , respectively , while the ratio of their @xmath5-values is 3.2 @xmath6 1.8 .",
    "@xcite theoretically predicted a 5:1 ratio for @xmath111695.34 vs. @xmath111693.24 , a value that is consistent with our determinations .",
    "theoretical computations by @xcite gave @xmath5 = 0.0073 for the 0@xmath20 band of the @xmath73 state , which she identified with the @xmath14 state .",
    "@xcite calculated a value of 0.0010 for @xmath5(@xmath14@xmath2@xmath3 ) .",
    "our value of 0.0038 @xmath6 0.0011 for the strongest feature appears to be within a factor of 2 to 3 of the two quantum mechanical predictions . in light of the good agreement in wavelength and @xmath5-value with predicted values",
    ", we have high confidence in treating this case as the first astronomical detection of the @xmath14@xmath2@xmath3 band from ch .",
    "concerning lorentzian line width , our synthesis of the blend at @xmath111695.34 returned @xmath60 = 7.0 @xmath7 10@xmath10 s@xmath9 , a rate which was kept fixed during the modeling of the partially blended @xmath70 line .",
    "however , @xcite measured decay rates of ( 3.6 @xmath6 0.6 ) @xmath7 10@xmath8 s@xmath9 in the laboratory for the @xmath30 = 2 levels of @xmath14@xmath2@xmath3 , and @xcite calculated a life time of 1.6 ps for the same state , albeit they denoted it by the letter @xmath24 .",
    "these consistent non - astronomical values show that predissociation dominates the decay of @xmath14 levels , as happens for the @xmath4 levels .",
    "consequently , we re - synthesized @xmath111695.34 with a fixed input @xmath59 value from @xcite , yielding @xmath5 = 0.0057 @xmath6 0.0023 , which is in good agreement with the calculated value of 0.0073 from @xcite .",
    "likewise , the @xmath5-value of @xmath111693.24 also increased by about 50% , see table 4 . according to figure 5",
    ", it seems that owing to insufficient s / n our original fit of @xmath111695.34 had converged onto a solution involving a noise glitch , leading to a @xmath60 value that was too small .",
    "the revised fits with the terrestrial value for @xmath59 are also consistent with the data .",
    "we surveyed a sample of interstellar sight lines and specific spectral ranges to search for new astronomical detections of vuv transitions of the ch molecule , as well as to confirm @xcite s identification of four uid lines as transitions involving two rydberg states of ch .",
    "we found that both old and new detections appear to be consistent with the identification of ch as their source , based on known amounts of ch along the lines of sight , on predicted wavelength positions , and on theoretical @xmath5-values .",
    "thus the decades - long tradition of optical observations of ch , utilizing its @xmath50@xmath2@xmath3 , @xmath74@xmath2@xmath3 , and @xmath69@xmath2@xmath3 bands , can now be extended into the vuv via observations of its @xmath14@xmath2@xmath3 , @xmath13@xmath2@xmath3 , @xmath4@xmath2@xmath3 ( @xmath1@xmath2@xmath3 ) bands , and , more reservedly , the @xmath12@xmath2@xmath3 band .",
    "we could not find any absorption features that might be identified with @xmath24@xmath2@xmath3 transitions of ch , listed by @xcite to be near 1557   .",
    "this band is problematic with an unknown configuration , and could be arising either from an @xmath75 state or it could be the 2@xmath20 band of @xmath14@xmath2@xmath3 @xcite , which has a very low @xmath5-value of 3.0 @xmath7 10@xmath76 @xcite and a very high rate of predissociation , @xmath60 = 1.4 @xmath7 10@xmath77 s@xmath9 @xcite . both characteristics of extremely weak oscillator strengths and extremely wide line profiles would easily render this band undetectable in astronomical , or low-@xmath16(ch ) , settings .    finally , with the confirmation that wider - than - average line profiles are attributable to high predissociation rates and symmetric lorentzian wings in rydberg transitions of ch , there are no candidates currently left in the vuv spectral regime that may be associated with the famous optical dib bands .",
