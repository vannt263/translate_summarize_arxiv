    "recently , the study of chromospherically active binaries ( hereafter cab ) has become more popular ( e.g. @xcite for a third version of the catalogue of cabs ; @xcite for sz psc ; @xcite for @xmath27 and and ii peg ; @xcite for hd 6286 ; @xcite and later series of papers ) .",
    "cab stars are usually either detached or semi - detached systems and their components include late spectral types of f , g or k , with luminosity classes v or iv . they show large asymmetries in their light curves , that are usually explained in terms of cool / dark spot(s ) models .",
    "the chromospheric activity is associated with caii h and k or / and h@xmath9 emission lines , ultraviolet excess , soft x - rays and radio emission .",
    "there is a wealth of associated phenomena - including starspots , plages , flares , non - radiatively heated outer atmospheres , activity cycles , and deceleration of rotation rates .",
    "the study of such active binary stars provides understanding of the origin , evolution , and effects of magnetic fields in cool stars . in this context , we have chosen cf tuc as the target of the present work .",
    "a review of this binary is presented below , new spectroscopic observations and their reductions are described in section  2 .",
    "the procedure used to obtain radial velocities and the orbital solution are outlined in section  3 , while rotation velocities of the components are examined in section  4 .",
    "magnetic activity indicators , h@xmath9 and caii h & k emission lines , are examined in section  5 , while simultaneous solutions of the @xmath10 light and radial velocity curves are given in section  6 .",
    "the orbital period analysis is reviewed in section  6 , and a discussion of the new results is given in the last section .",
    "cf tuc ( hd 5303 = hip 4157 , @xmath28 = 7.60 mag ) is a well known southern hemisphere cab . in the third edition of the cab catalogue , recently published by @xcite , the following physical properties are given : ( i ) it is a rs cvn - type sb2 system with the spectral types g0v",
    "/ iv+k4iv / v ( @xcite ) .",
    "( ii ) photometric light curves have remarkable asymmetries , especially visible well out of eclipses .",
    "the magnitudes of these asymmetries are variable with time ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "( iii ) radial velocities of the components were obtained , and then spectroscopic orbital elements and absolute parameters of the components were derived : @xmath11=1.06 @xmath6 , @xmath13=1.21 @xmath6 , @xmath15=1.67 @xmath17 , @xmath18=3.32 @xmath17 , @xmath29=5980 k and @xmath30=4210 k ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "( iv ) the orbital period is 2.797672 days , however it is changing ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "( v ) orbital inclination is close to 70@xmath31 , therefore eclipses are partial ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) . ( vi )",
    "the projected rotational velocities of the components are around 25  30 km / s for the primary , 52 - 75 km / s for the secondary ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "( vii ) the spectra of the system give relatively high li abundance ( @xcite ) .",
    "( viii ) the system shows strong caii h and k emission ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the h@xmath9 line appears as nearly totally filled - in absorption ( @xcite ) .",
    "( ix ) the system is also a known radio and x - ray source ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "some large flare events were reported ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "other references can be found in the cab catalogue .",
    "particular aims of the present study are : ( i ) to investigate the orbital period changes of cf tuc with updated data , and ( ii ) to derive more accurate absolute parameters of the system using our new , high resolution spectroscopic data .",
    "the spectroscopic observations of cf tuc were made at mt john university observatory ( hereafter mjuo ) in new zealand in the summer season of 2007 . a 1 m mclennan telescope and hercules ( high efficiency and resolution canterbury university large chelle spectrograph ) spectrograph were used .",
    "the spectrograph has 100 chelle orders , which cover wavelength range between 380 nm and 900 nm , and is located in a vacuum tank on stable ground in a thermally isolated room and attached to the telescope by fibre cables .",
    "there are two different resolving powers : r=41000 and r=70000 . in the observations",
    "the former was used as being better adjusted to the mean seeing value ( @xmath32 @xmath33 @xmath34 ) at mjuo given by @xcite .    ccccc no & frame & hjd & s / n & + & & ( + 2450000 ) & & + 1 & w4350022 & 54349.98652 & 60 & 1509 + 2 & w4350030 & 54350.03238 & 74 & 1223 + 3 & w4350053 & 54350.23328 & 78 & 1322 + 4 & w4351012 & 54350.89945 & 85 & 1144 + 5 & w4351014 & 54350.91536 & 80 & 1021 + 6 & w4352010 & 54351.90655 & 50 & 1500 + 7 & w4352019 & 54351.96099 & 78 & 1500 + 8 & w4352022 & 54351.98189 & 85 & 1200 + 9 & w4353002 & 54352.86852 & 85 & 1500 + 10 & w4354017 & 54353.93546 & 80 & 1300 + 11 & w4354019 & 54353.95324 & 85 & 1300 + 12 & w4354037 & 54354.10935 & 95 & 1300 + 13 & w4354039 & 54354.12710 & 88 & 1300 + 14 & w4356003 & 54355.85715 & 55 & 1600 + 15 & w4356005 & 54355.87984 & 60 & 1700 + 16 & w4356018 & 54355.99775 & 70 & 1500 + 17 & w4356028 & 54356.07125 & 80 & 1500 + 18 & w4356030 & 54356.09149 & 80 & 1500 + 19 & w4363011 & 54362.85380 & 98 & 1600 + 20 & w4363027 & 54362.93923 & 80 & 1900 + 21 & w4363029 & 54362.96309 & 85 & 1750 + 22 & w4377014 & 54376.89666 & 94 & 2100 + 23 & w4377022 & 54376.96563 & 78 & 2200 + 24 & w4378016 & 54377.94931 & 82 & 2100 +   +    24 spectra were obtained over 10 nights between september and october 2007 . the journal of observations is shown in table  [ table1 ] .",
    "the exposure time was chosen between 1100 and 1800 seconds , depending on the weather conditions . during the observations , comparison spectra of a thorium - argon arc lamp were taken before and after each stellar image .",
    "a set of white lamp images was also taken as flat field images .",
    "two iau radial velocity standard stars ( hd 36079 and hd 693 ) were observed .",
    "the bright , non - active and slowly rotating standard star hd 36079 ( g5ii , @xmath35=-13.6 km / s ) was chosen for the rv measurements of the components of cf tuc .",
    "hercules reduction software package ( hrsp , ver .  3 : skuljan and wright 2007 ) was used for reductions of all observations .",
    "this procedure takes into account other sources of apparent motion ( such as the earth s rotations and orbital revolution ) , wavelength calibration , removal of spurious pixels ( such as those struck by cosmic rays ) , correction for the inherent pixel - to - pixel response variation ( flat - fielding ) , continuum normalization , etc . , and produces a target spectrum ( wavelength versus flux ) as the result .",
    "measurements of radial velocities were done by two methods : the cross - correlation technique ( cct ) and the fourier disentangling technique ( korel ) .",
    "cct was used as the first step to estimate the orbital parameters , as korel may not produce a unique solution in some complex cases . in this study ,",
    "the real orbit improvement comes from usage of korel and the number of spectral orders is not so relevant to accuracy . in general ,",
    "if all the spectral orders were of the same quality , the precision of a measurement would increase with the square root of the number of orders .",
    "if the best spectral orders are chosen , others will produce systematic errors , and improvement will not be scaled as the square root of the number of orders .",
    "the main issue is the role of noise and better line resolution and identification in the selected orders . in the case of cf tuc , since cf tuc is rather faint for the used observational instruments and its components are close to g0 v / iv + k4 v / iv , the observed spectra of the system include too many blended metallic absorption lines .",
    "it is very difficult to identify real / true lines and to resolve them into two components .",
    "all spectral regions were examined , and , as a result , four spectral orders were selected , for which the lines of both components could be clearly detected , and therefore suitable for disentangling .",
    "the information about these four spectral orders is given in table  [ table2 ] .",
    ".spectral orders and stellar lines used in rvs measurements of cf tuc . [ cols= \" < , < , < \" , ]     the locations of the components of cf tuc in the luminosity - effective temperature ( @xmath36@xmath37 , i.e. hertzsprung - russell diagram ) and the mass - radius ( @xmath38@xmath39 ) planes are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig10 ] .",
    "we considered only rs cvn type eclipsing binaries , in which the cooler component is a more massive one , to compare the cf tuc system with other rs cvn s .",
    "according to these diagrams , while the cooler component has evolved behind the terminal age main sequence , the hotter one is still on the main sequence , approaching the tams .",
    "this case predicates that cf tuc is similar to other rs cvn s .",
    "we compared our observationally determined physical parameters with those inferred from the evolutionary tracks in the hr diagram .",
    "the best fit appears at age of 5.012 gyr for both components .",
    "the param program at web page ( http://stev.oapd.inaf.it/  lgirardi / cgi - bin / param ) based on the bayesian method of da silva et al . ( 2006 ) gives the cf tuc age as 5.3 gyr , which agrees well with our determination .",
    "the orbital period change of the system is interesting and difficult to solve .",
    "the @xmath26 data of cf tuc could be represented either by two abrupt period changes or by a sinusoidal period variation superimposed on a downward parabola . in the first case",
    ", there appears to be two sudden period jumps : in 1986 and 1995 .",
    "the first jump shows a period increase , while the second denotes a period decrease .",
    "according to the conservative mass transfer mode , the period increase corresponds to a mass transfer from the less massive to the more massive component . in the case of cf tuc , since the less massive ( primary ) component is quite far from filling its roche lobe , this period increase derived from the first jump can not be explained by the mass transfer mechanism .",
    "if we take into account the representation of @xmath26 sinusoidal variation superimposed on a parabola ; the downward parabola indicates the highest rate of period decrease among the cab systems .",
    "however , since cf tuc is a detached system , we do not expect direct mass transfer between the components .",
    "therefore , another possible explanation could be a mass loss by stellar wind from the subgiant component .",
    "since the active , subgiant component fills @xmath40 of its roche lobe , if a large amount of escaping mass by stellar wind transfers to the primary one , the remaining amount of escaping mass would leave the system . to check this hypothesis ,",
    "the h@xmath9 and caii h & k spectra of the system were examined .",
    "since the rvs of h@xmath9 and caii h & k emission features follow the orbital motion of the secondary ( cooler ) component , these emission features should come from chromospheric and/or coronal layers of that component .",
    "from the large width of the h@xmath9 emission line profile , we estimate turbulent velocities to be up to 200 kms@xmath41 .",
    "such velocities well support our hypothesis that the emission features originate in the circumstellar material .",
    "the sinusoidal form of the orbital period variation was considered as an apparent change and interpreted in terms of the light - time effect due to an unseen component in the system .",
    "the large amplitude ( @xmath330.04 day ) and small period ( @xmath3318 years ) of the sinusoidal form of the @xmath26 diagram give quite a large value ( 2.7 @xmath42 ) for the minimum mass of the hypothetical third body .",
    "the observed systemic velocity variation and hipparcos intermediate astrometric data of cf tuc partially support the hypothesis of the existence of a third body in the system .",
    "if such a third body were a main - sequence star , it would be a blue dwarf of a late - b spectral type .",
    "however , neither new high - resolution spectroscopic observations nor photometric analysis show any evidence to confirm the presence of such a star",
    ". additionally , we could not expect such a young star as the binary system is much older .",
    "therefore , the hypothetical third body must make a negligible optical contribution to the total light . with this mass",
    ", it could be either a massive neutron star ( ns ) or a black hole ( bh ) . in the case of the companion being a compact object",
    ", the question is , can we see it , i.e. in x - rays ?",
    "cf tuc was observed by @xcite and they detected x - ray photons with energies of one kev in quiescence and a few kev during the flares .",
    "this soft x - ray emission was identified as being released in the corona of the magnetically active component .",
    "a young ns should give much higher x - ray emission , and an isolated ns would produce a termal x - ray emission of 40 - 100 kev ( @xcite ) . the progenitor of the ns must be a b - type star which evolves fast through the main sequence , within 100 - 500 million years , depending on the mass .",
    "the newborn ns would have a temperature of 10@xmath43  k and could be detected in x - rays .",
    "however , assuming the triple system has been formed at the same time and not via a capture , the ns would have enough time to cool down to a much lower temperature . according to the ns models , after 10@xmath44 years",
    ", the ns temperature would be only 10@xmath45  k. the other possibility , if either a ns or a bh is the third component , could be the accretion luminosity when matter is being accreted onto this object .",
    "in fact , a black hole can be seen only through its accretion effects . due to the large distance from the binary system to the companion ( 4.9au ) , the only possibility for accretion would be through a stellar wind from the binary .",
    "even though cf tuc has the higher rate of stellar wind among cab binaries , at the third body separation only a tiny fraction of mass lost by the active component could be accreted , as such accretion is much less efficient than that through the lagrangian point .",
    "we shall estimate the rate according to the formula given by @xcite .",
    "taking @xmath46 = @xmath47 @xmath42/yr , separation of 4.93 au , mass of the accreting object to be 3 @xmath42 and derived radius and mass of the secondary star , we calculated the accretion luminosity to be about @xmath48  erg / s .",
    "such a value is comparable to the quiescent luminosities of nsxn and bhxn ( @xcite ) and quiescent low - mass x - ray binary transients ( @xcite ) .",
    "if the third companion is a ns with such a luminosity it should be observed in x - rays , unless the efficiency of the mass transfer to the primary is more efficient than we have assumed .",
    "if the companion is a bh , which has no surface , a significant fraction of mass could be lost below the event horizon , instead of being converted into hard photons .",
    "also , if the accretion onto the bh is spherical and not through a bow shock , as considered above , it could be less efficient as well .",
    "however , the factors describing this efficiency are within a huge range , between @xmath49 to @xmath50 ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) and strongly model dependent ( i.e. rotation of the bh , magnetic field , speed of the bh or the accreted material ) .",
    "concerning the efficiency of the accreting matter being converted into photons , this factor could be in the same range .",
    "if the factors are in the lower end , then the existence of a bh as the third companion in cf tuc in not impossible , though unlikely , as the possibility of its observation may fall below the detection limit and the light time effect would be the only evidence of its existence .",
    "another explanation of the orbital period sinusoidal variation could be the applegate mechanism .",
    "however , the applegate model with @xmath51=0.1@xmath38 , @xmath52 , and @xmath53 can not explain the rate of orbital period change observed in cf tuc .",
    "the last possibility , we can consider , would be a spurious sine term which may not repeat in the future .",
    "the observed light curves have strong asymmetries which can affect accuracy of the minima times determination . in some cases",
    ", these asymmetries are so large that secondary minima can not even be easily recognized .",
    "therefore , some spurious @xmath26 residuals may come from the asymmetries of the light curve .",
    "for instance , @xcite found an approximate 6 year magnetic cycle , considering that these light curve asymmetries were caused by maculation effects .",
    "therefore , we conclude that only future observations can reveal the true nature of the observed period changes . if they are caused by a companion bh , this will be the closest black hole to the earth .",

    "<S> this paper presents results derived from analysis of new spectroscopic and photometric observations of the chromospherically active binary system cf tuc . </S>",
    "<S> new high - resolution spectra , taken at the mt . </S>",
    "<S> john university observatory in 2007 , were analyzed using two methods : cross - correlation and fourier  based disentangling . as a result </S>",
    "<S> , new radial velocity curves of both components were obtained . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting orbital elements of cf tuc are : @xmath0=@xmath1 au , @xmath2=@xmath3 au , @xmath4=@xmath5 @xmath6 , and @xmath7=@xmath8 @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> the cooler component of the system shows h@xmath9 and caii h & k emissions . using simultaneous spectroscopic and photometric observations , </S>",
    "<S> an anti - correlation between the h@xmath9 emission and the @xmath10 light curve maculation effects was found . </S>",
    "<S> this behaviour indicates a close spatial association between photospheric and chromospheric active regions . </S>",
    "<S> our spectroscopic data and recent @xmath10 light curves were solved simultaneously using the wilson - devinney code . </S>",
    "<S> a dark spot on the surface of the cooler component was assumed to explain large asymmetries observed in the light curves . </S>",
    "<S> the following absolute parameters of the components were determined : @xmath11=@xmath12 @xmath6 , @xmath13=@xmath14 @xmath6 , @xmath15=@xmath16 @xmath17 , @xmath18=@xmath19 @xmath17 , @xmath20=@xmath21 @xmath22 and @xmath23=@xmath24 @xmath22 . </S>",
    "<S> the primary component has an age of about 5 gyr and is approaching its main sequence terminal age . </S>",
    "<S> the distance to cf tuc was calculated to be @xmath25 pc from the dynamic parallax , neglecting interstellar absorption , in agreement with the hipparcos value . </S>",
    "<S> the orbital period of the system was studied using the @xmath26 analysis . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath26 diagram could be interpreted in terms of either two abrupt changes or a quasi - sinusoidal form superimposed on a downward parabola . </S>",
    "<S> these variations are discussed by reference to the combined effect of mass transfer and mass loss , the applegate mechanism and also a light - time effect due to the existence of a third body in the system .    </S>",
