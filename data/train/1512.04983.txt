    "as one of the richest old open clusters in our galaxy , ngc 188 has been extensively studied .",
    "the breadth of available data , old age , and the abundance of short - period photometrically variable stars and x - ray sources , make ngc 188 a very attractive cluster for both observational and theoretical astronomers .",
    "moreover , the multitude of photometric surveys @xcite , spectroscopic studies @xcite , short - period variable star studies @xcite , including both optical and x - ray photometric monitoring , proper - motion ( pm ) analyses @xcite , and the binary population study by @xcite provide an unprecedented basis from which to study an open cluster .",
    "however , until now , the study of this cluster has lacked a critical component .",
    "this paper presents the first high - precision , comprehensive radial - velocity ( rv ) survey of the cluster , thereby providing the first census of the hard - binary population , measurements of the internal stellar kinematics , and improved membership information .",
    "the recent photometric studies by @xcite and @xcite used ubvri ccd photometry to derive a reddening of @xmath7 , an apparent distance modulus of @xmath8 ( 1.9 kpc ) , and an age of 7 gyr .",
    "the most recent pm study by @xcite ( hereafter , p03 ) suggests that ngc 188 contains @xmath31500 cluster members ( membership probability @xmath5 10% ) down to a limiting magnitude of @xmath2=21 within 17 pc in projection .",
    "we have used the p03 study to form our current cluster sample ( described in section  [ sam ] ) .",
    "this rv analysis of ngc 188 is part of the wiyn open cluster study ( wocs ; * ? ? ?",
    "we calculate rv membership probabilities for 848  solar - type stars with @xmath53 radial - velocity measurements ( section  [ mem ] ) , finding 349  single cluster members and 124  likely member velocity - variable stars ( section  [ var ] ) .",
    "( in the following , we use the term `` single '' to identify stars with no significant rv variation . certainly , many of these stars are also binaries , although generally with lower total mass than the binaries identified in this study .",
    "we assume that the velocity - variables detected in this study are binary- or multiple - star systems . )",
    "combined with available pm data , our precise three - dimensional ( 3d ) kinematic memberships define the most accurate sample of solar - type members of ngc 188 to date .",
    "we use this member sample to construct a cleaned color - magnitude diagram of the cluster ( section  [ cmd ] ) from which we identify a blue - straggler ( bs ) population as well as six intriguing stars that lie far from a standard single - star isochrone .",
    "finally , we investigate the spatial distribution of cluster member populations ( section  [ spat ] ) and the cluster s velocity dispersion ( section  [ disp ] ) .",
    "following papers will provide orbital solutions for most of the velocity variables , likely all of which will be hard binary stars that dynamically power the cluster , as well as detailed comparisons with @xmath9-body models ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "our ongoing wiyn rv survey of ngc 188 began in 1996 .",
    "the following section describes the development of our stellar sample over the course of these eleven years .",
    "our observational history as well as current strategy have been dependent on the available position , photometry and membership measurements .",
    "initially , we composed our stellar sample from the @xcite pm study , which contains photometry and pms ( @xmath10 = 0.5 mas yr@xmath4 ) for 1127 stars covering a 50  x 60  area within the limiting magnitudes of @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "@xcite found 360 cluster members in their sample ( probability @xmath5 70% ) .",
    "these cluster members were prioritized in our observations ( see section  [ obs ] ) .",
    "later , a more extensive pm study was performed by p03 , complete to @xmath13 and covering @xmath14 , centered on the j2000.0 coordinates : @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "the pms have a precision down to 0.15 mas yr@xmath4 per coordinate , and the coordinates are accurate to 5 - 10 mas on the international celestial reference system ( icrs ) . of the 7812 objects that were detected ,",
    "p03 found 1490 pm members ( probability @xmath5 10% ) across all magnitudes in the study .",
    "thus , in 2003 , we chose to update our data set to include the additional stars ( both pm members and non - members ) from this study that lie within our magnitude limits , and to use the more accurate coordinates .",
    "our complete stellar sample includes 1498 stars .",
    "the hydra multi - object spectrograph ( mos ) on the wiyn 3.5 m telescope has an effective dynamic range of approximately four magnitudes and a 1  field of view .",
    "fortuitously , the p03 study also covers 1  in spatial extent ; we therefore did not make any spatial cut in our sample .",
    "we have set our limiting magnitude range to 12@xmath0v@xmath016.5 , covering a large portion of the giant branch through the upper main sequence , including the cluster turnoff and bs stars . at @xmath2 = 16.5 ,",
    "the faint end of our observations extends to @xmath31.5 magnitudes below the cluster turnoff ( e.g. , figure  [ cmds ] ) .",
    "our observing setup allows us to consistently determine rvs for stars whose @xmath17 0.4 ; earlier type stars are often rapidly rotating and have fewer absorption lines in our wavelength range .",
    "since our sample includes only 30 stars blueward of this , we also observed them so as to include those that are narrow - lined .",
    "currently , our stellar sample contains stars whose @xmath18 color lies within the range of @xmath19 . after limiting the p03 study by magnitude",
    ", we have a total stellar sample of 1498 stars , comprising a complete sample of stars within our magnitude range and within 0.5  ( 17 pc at a distance of 1.9 kpc ) from the cluster center .      the dao data set contains multiple rv measurements of 77 stars within the magnitudes of 10.8@xmath0v@xmath016 covering dates from december 1973 through november 1996 . observations",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "all rv measurements were then converted onto the dao radial - velocity spectrometer ( rvs ) system .",
    "we have used the hydra multi - object spectrograph ( mos ) on the wiyn 3.5 m telescope to conduct our ongoing wocs rv survey of ngc 188 from 1996 to the present .",
    "the telescope combines a large aperture and wide field of view , and provides excellent image quality ( 0.8 arcsecond median seeing ) .",
    "the mos is capable of obtaining simultaneous spectra of up to @xmath380 stars over the 1  field during each configuration ( or _ pointing _ ) .",
    "the hydra fiber positioner executes a fiber setup in @xmath320 minutes with a precision of 0.2@xmath20 .",
    "the isolated fiber - fed bench spectrograph is of conventional design with an all - transmission camera to avoid central obstruction of the filled beam .",
    "we use the blue fibers for our observations , each fiber having a 3.1@xmath20 aperture and an effective spectral window of 300 - 700 nm .",
    "the majority of our observations are centered on 513 nm and extend 25 nm in either direction , covering a rich array of narrow absorption lines and the mg b triplet .",
    "we utilize the x14 filter along with the echelle grating at 11th order , obtaining a resolution of approximately 20000 and a dispersion of 0.13  / pixel on the ccd .",
    "a portion of our observations are centered on 640 nm ( also extending 25 nm in either direction ) .",
    "the detector is a thinned 2048 x 2048 tektronics ccd with 24@xmath21 m pixels and a typical resolution element of @xmath3 2.5 pixels ( @xmath3 19 km s@xmath4 ) .      during each pointing",
    "we may utilize @xmath380 fibers to measure simultaneous spectra .",
    "we will generally use @xmath310 fibers to measure the sky , and place the remaining @xmath370 fibers on stars .",
    "therefore , developing a strategy for the placement of these science fibers is critical in order to optimize limited observing time .",
    "this section discusses our chosen strategy for fiber placement as well as our general observing routine .",
    "prior to creating our `` pointing files '' for a given observing run , we perform a detailed prioritization of the stars in our sample based on our available data . in general",
    ", we place our discovered velocity - variable stars at the highest priority , followed by pm members , pm non - members , and finally , those stars that we consider finished . based on monte carlo simulations ,",
    "we require 3 epochs of rv measurements over at least a year to ensure 95% confidence that a star is either constant or variable in velocity ( i.e. , a single star or a binary- or multiple - star system ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . with three observations in hand",
    "we either derive secure membership probabilities for single stars and place them at the lowest priority ( considering them finished ) , or move binaries to the highest priority in order to expedite orbital solutions .    to maximize progress towards orbital solutions , the short - period binaries are the highest priority for observation each night .",
    "longer period binaries are the next priority for 1 - 2 observations per run .",
    "all other fibers are placed on stars for completion of the survey of the entire cluster .",

    "the faint master contains all of the stars from our sample while the bright master contains only stars within the range of 12.5@xmath0v@xmath015.5 ( 777 object stars ) to be used in the case where light cloud cover would likely prevent us from reliably deriving velocities for the fainter stars . in general",
    ", we use a total of two hours of integration time for the faint pointings split into three 2400-sec integrations . for bright pointings , we take one hour of total integration time split into three 1200-sec integrations . by splitting up our integrations ,",
    "we increase our ability to remove cosmic rays that may appear in our spectra .",
    "calibration is achieved through one 200-sec flat field and two 300-sec thar ( for the 513 nm range ) or cuar ( for the 640 nm range ) emission lamp spectra for each pointing .",
    "currently , we have observed ngc 188 using wiyn over 53 different observing runs totalling 119 separate pointings .",
    "the dao rvs were measured using the dao rvs on the 1.2-meter telescope .",
    "this instrument observes 43 nm of the spectrum centered at 455 nm with a resolution 0.2  , scanning a mask rapidly across the stellar absorption lines .",
    "the properties of the instrument and the observing procedures can be found in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the ultimate goal of our data reduction routine is to take our ccd image ( the light from the @xmath380 fibers ) , extract the @xmath370 science spectra from this image , and obtain @xmath370 heliocentric rvs .",
    "we describe our data reduction procedure in some detail here as the basic reference for subsequent rv publications from this project .    initially , we come away from the telescope with raw fits images of the dispersed light from our science and calibration integrations .",
    "we generally take two thar ( or cuar ) calibration images per pointing , one before the first integration and one after the last integration , in order to account for any potential wavelength shift that may occur during the one or two hours of total integration .",

    "second , we average the flat - field intensity across all fibers , fit a cubic - spline function to this single flat - field spectrum , and , again , save this fit for use in flat fielding the science spectra .",
    "finally , the dome flat is used to correct for fiber - to - fiber throughput variations .",
    "each extracted flat field aperture is averaged to a single number which is then multiplied by the average flat field intensity function so that when the science apertures are flat fielded later , they will be throughput corrected simultaneously .    we then determine a pixel to wavelength map using the thar ( or cuar ) calibration spectra , first using the long ( 900-sec ) exposure taken during the day , and then the shorter ( 300-sec ) exposures related to the science images .",
    "we use the long calibration image for our initial map , as the extracted high signal - to - noise spectra yield more precise results . after extracting the spectra from the long calibration image",
    ", we determine a dispersion solution for each aperture by fitting a cubic - spline function to the thar ( or cuar ) emission line wavelengths and pixel centroids .",
    "we then transfer these solutions as initial guesses onto the extracted short calibration spectra associated with our science spectra .",
    "our typical rms residuals around the emission line wavelengths for a fit to a long calibration spectrum vary from @xmath30.006 - 0.009  , and increase slightly for the short calibration exposures .    finally , the science spectra are extracted , flat fielded , throughput corrected , and dispersion corrected .",
    "the result is a multi - spectrum fits image containing all science spectra for a given integration .",
    "the preceding steps are performed for each of a set of integrations for a given field using the associated flat fields and calibration images .",

    "we inspect each sky spectrum and then use all acceptable sky spectra from our pointing to create one averaged sky spectrum per integration .",
    "( inclusion of a noisy , low quality or accidental stellar spectrum will degrade our science spectra when sky subtracted . ) during the averaging , the sky spectra are run through an averaged sigma clipping algorithm in order to remove cosmic rays .",
    "finally , this combined sky spectrum is subtracted from each object spectrum , and the procedure is repeated for all integrations .    at this point , we generally have three extracted and sky subtracted sets of spectra for each pointing ( i.e. , one set of spectra for each integration of a given pointing ) , which we combine to produce one set of spectra per pointing .",
    "we perform a median filter combination to remove any cosmic ray contamination from our object spectra .",
    "[ [ cross - correlation ] ] cross correlation : + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    we then calculate rvs from these combined object spectra using the iraf task _",
    "fxcor_. this task uses the fourier transforms of two spectra ( generally one science and one template spectrum ) to quickly compute the cross - correlation function ( ccf ) between them , and hence derive their velocity difference .",
    "we fit a gaussian function to the ccf peak and find the centroid , obtaining the velocity offset of the object spectrum from the template .",
    "we allow iraf to correct this velocity for the template offset and the motion of the earth around the sun to return a heliocentric velocity .",
    "these heliocentric velocities are the final product of our data reduction routine .    since we are observing solar - type stars , we have chosen to correlate each object spectrum against a high signal - to - noise solar spectrum obtained from a daytime sky observation .",
    "this solar template spectrum was obtained using the same observing setup as used for our science spectra .",
    "currently , the same template is used to reduce all of our wiyn observations . however ,",
    "certainly not all of our stars have a g2v spectral type .",
    "therefore we have investigated for a potential offset in velocity resulting from a template mismatch by binning our measured single member star rvs as a function of @xmath18  color .",
    "there is no evidence for a systematic offset to the level of 0.1 km s@xmath4 .",
    "we are therefore confident that our choice of a g star template has not affected the accuracy of our rv measurements .",
    "information regarding the dao rvs data reduction routine can be found in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "here we present a thorough analysis of our wiyn rv measurement precision and the various sources of dispersion in our measurements . in section  [ qual ]",
    ", we briefly discuss our quality control procedures . in section  [ prec ]",
    "we derive our measurement precision through the use of the @xmath22 function .",
    "finally , we provide a detailed empirical study of our error budget in section  [ erbud ] .",
    "generally the highest signal - to - noise spectra result in the highest ccf peak height values .",
    "we use the peak height of the ccf fit as the measure of the quality of a given measurement in the wiyn data set .",
    "only measurements whose fits lie above a certain cutoff value in ccf peak height are deemed reliable . in order to determine this cutoff value , we first determine the offset of each rv measurement of a star from the mean rv of that star , using only single stars .",
    "we then plot these offsets , for all rv measurements of all single stars , against ccf peak height ( figure  [ ccfcut ] ) .",
    "it is clear from figure  [ ccfcut ] that above a ccf peak height of @xmath30.4 the rv offsets are quite small while those measurements whose ccf peak heights are lower than 0.4 show a very large scatter .",
    "we therefore adopt a ccf peak height cutoff value of 0.4 , and present here only measurements of this quality .",
    "in addition to our ccf peak height quality criterion , we examine the distribution of rvs for each individual star and visually inspect any measurements that are outliers in the distribution .",
    "occasionally we remove measurements whose ccf , though having a peak height above 0.4 , clearly provides a spurious measurement ( e.g. , inadequate sky subtraction ) .      in order to determine the precision of our wiyn rv measurements , we fit a @xmath23 distribution to our empirical distribution of rv standard deviations ( following @xcite ) . the theoretical @xmath23 curve models",
    "the distribution of errors on measurements of single stars .",
    "this function depends on both the precision of all measurements as well as the number of degrees of freedom ( i.e. , one less than the number of measurements ) . for consistency across all stars ,",
    "many of which have only three measurements , here we have used only the first three measurements of each star to calculate the standard deviation of its measurements10% for three measurements ) correction to standard deviations measured using the traditional formula .",
    "therefore we have decided to use the traditional formula to calculate our standard deviation values , and note that we derive the same global precision on our measurements using either method . ] . in order to derive this precision value",
    ", we fit a @xmath23 function with 2 degrees of freedom to the distribution of the rv standard deviations : @xmath24 here , @xmath25 denotes the standard deviation of the rv measurements for a star , and @xmath26 represents the overall precision of our measurements .",
    "the empirical distribution ( figure  [ 3all.eoveri ] ) represents the combination of two populations : the single stars ( with lower @xmath25 ) , and the velocity - variable stars ( with higher @xmath25 ) .",
    "the @xmath23 function is designed to fit only the single stars .",
    "for this reason , we chose a maximum @xmath25 for our fit , above which the population is dominated by velocity - variable stars .",
    "we used a standard least - squares determination , varying the value @xmath26 as well as a cutoff value in @xmath25 , to fit the @xmath22 function to our data . a maximum @xmath25 cutoff of 0.7 km s@xmath4  ( shown by the dashed line in figure  [ 3all.eoveri ] ) and @xmath26 = 0.4 km s@xmath4   produced the smallest residuals and hence the best fit to the peak at lower @xmath25 .",
    "figure  [ 3all.eoveri ] shows the rv standard deviation histogram of all stars with @xmath27 wiyn measurements along with the best fit @xmath22 distribution function .",
    "this analysis yields a nominal precision on our wiyn data of @xmath26 * = 0.4 km s@xmath4*.    note that towards higher standard deviations , the data are populated almost entirely by binary stars .",
    "this is reflected in the departure of the data from the theoretical @xmath23 curve .",
    "we can therefore use this plot to facilitate our binary identification routine by assuming that if a given star has a @xmath25 that is higher than a certain value , the star is a velocity variable . by inspection of figure  [ 3all.eoveri ]",
    "we note that the theoretical curve drops to very near zero at @xmath28 3 times @xmath26 .",
    "we therefore define our velocity - variable stars as those stars whose rv standard deviations ( by convention , we use _ e _ in place of @xmath25 ) are greater than 4 times our quoted precision ( by convention , we use _ i _ in place of @xmath26 ) , or @xmath29  @xmath28  4 .",
    "we plot this value of @xmath29  = 4 as the dotted line in figure  [ 3all.eoveri ] , and we discuss our velocity variables in further detail in section  [ var ] .",
    "although we have calculated a single value for our wiyn precision the dispersion of our measurements is affected by photon error , and is thus a function of @xmath2 magnitude .",
    "figure  [ v.ccf.eoveri ] shows @xmath22 calculated values of @xmath26 as functions of ccf peak height and @xmath2 magnitude . for fit quality ,",
    "our precision ranges from 0.22 km s@xmath4  for the highest quality rvs and degrades to 0.80 km s@xmath4  towards our ccf peak height cutoff value of 0.4 .",
    "we see a similar range when looking at the precision as a function of @xmath2 magnitude ; the brightest stars are measured to a precision of 0.25 km s@xmath4  while the measurement precision on our faintest stars is reduced to 0.55 km s@xmath4 .",
    "the range in @xmath22-fit values for our precision agrees very well with that derived from our error budget analysis in section  [ erbud ] .",
    "we are therefore confident in quoting our overall precision to be @xmath26 = 0.4 km s@xmath4 , which can then be used to identify our binary stars and to evaluate the velocity dispersion of the cluster .      in this section",
    ", we present a thorough empirical analysis of the error sources contributing to our measurement precision ; a preliminary report can be found in @xcite .",
    "our internal measurement errors have both systematic and random components that include fiber - to - fiber variations ( @xmath30 ) , photon error ( @xmath31 ) , and pointing - to - pointing variations ( @xmath32 ) , each of which we discuss and quantify here .",
    "sky flats demonstrate the existence of fiber - to - fiber variations of unknown origin . during our eleven years of monitoring the stars in ngc 188 , different configurations of the hydra mos result in the same star being measured through different fibers . thus",
    "fiber - to - fiber variations represent a source of internal error on the set of measurements for a star .",
    "fortunately this error is systematic and can be corrected .    during each observing run , we take at least one sky flat as a calibration measure , with all fibers arranged in a circle in the focal plane .",
    "when corrected for the earth s rotational and orbital motions , all fibers should provide radial velocities of 0 km s@xmath4 .",
    "in reality , it has become clear that each fiber has a unique and consistent offset of @xmath33 1 km s@xmath4 .",
    "specifically , for each sky flat we derive a mean velocity across all of the fibers , and then measure the velocity offset from this mean for each fiber .",
    "we take the means of these velocity offsets over @xmath310 years of observing ngc 188 for each of the two observed wavelength ranges , and the results are plotted in figure  [ fiber ] .",
    "the offsets for the 513 nm region range from 0.00 km s@xmath4  to 0.70 km s@xmath4 .",
    "the mean of the standard deviations on each mean offset measurement is 0.13 km s@xmath4 .",
    "analysis of the 640 nm range results in similar values .",
    "we assume that the derived offset for a given fiber is independent of the position of the fiber on the focal plane .",
    "our rv measurements are corrected for these offsets on a fiber - by - fiber basis .      as described in section  [ obs ] , each rv measurement derives from three combined sequential integrations obtained in the same fiber configuration .",
    "since these three integrations are almost contemporaneous and are made through the same fibers for any given star , the standard deviations of the three velocities measured from each of the three integrations must arise from photon error alone .",
    "figure  [ photer](a ) shows the distribution of such standard deviations as a function of @xmath2 magnitude , and provides a direct measurement of our photon error .",
    "it is clear that the photon error is a function of @xmath2 magnitude , as expected .",
    "( here we have only included 2400-second integrations . ) indeed , if we bin the data shown in figure  [ photer](a ) by intensity ( @xmath34 ) , the trend is well fit by @xmath35 .      in figure  [ photer](b ) ,",
    "we plot the standard deviations of the rv measurements for each single star as a function of @xmath2 magnitude . for @xmath2 @xmath36 14 ,",
    "the morphologies of figures  [ photer](a ) and [ photer](b ) are nearly identical .",
    "for these fainter stars , the dispersion on our measurements is dominated by photon error . however , at @xmath2 @xmath37 14 , the values in figure  [ photer](a ) drop below those in figure  [ photer](b ) . here , the photon error is lower than our empirical precision .",
    "indeed , at @xmath2 @xmath33 14 , we observe a constant dispersion with an average value of @xmath30.3 km s@xmath4  while our average photon error in figure  [ photer](a ) is only @xmath30.2 km s@xmath4 .",
    "we must therefore identify a second component to our random error .",
    "we conjecture that this component is due to systematic offsets in each pointing that are randomly distributed in time .",
    "we label this component the pointing - to - pointing variation : @xmath32 .",
    "thus , we define our internal sources of random error as : @xmath38    because we do not have multiple observations of identical pointing configurations , we need to determine @xmath32 via a statistical approach .",
    "we begin by defining the quantity @xmath39 , the dispersion of the mean rvs of all pointings .",
    "specifically , for each pointing we take the mean rv of the single cluster members , which we call the pointing velocity .",
    "then @xmath39 is the standard deviation of all of these pointing velocities .",
    "note that @xmath39 is not simply @xmath32 , because each pointing velocity derives from a different sample of single cluster members .",
    "the dispersion among pointing velocities is thus a consequence of the pointing - to - pointing variations , the photon errors , and the true motions of the stars .",
    "we digress here briefly to discuss the last .",
    "stars in a gravitationally bound cluster will orbit the center of mass of the system .",
    "the orbital motions around the cluster center - of - mass is typically characterized by a velocity dispersion ( @xmath40 ) .",
    "in addition , orbital motions introduced by a binary companion will offset the individual rv measurements of a given star from the binary system s center - of - mass motion .",
    "when a binary orbital solution is available the true center - of - mass motion is known",
    ". however , there are certainly binaries that we can not detect spectroscopically ( e.g. , long - period binaries ) , and are thus included as single ( constant - velocity ) stars .",
    "these undetected binaries add to the dispersion on our measurements .",
    "we characterize the distribution of undetected binary motions as a gaussian with dispersion @xmath41 .",
    "therefore , we call the combination of the cluster motions and undetected binary motions the combined velocity dispersion : @xmath42    thus , we define the measured pointing variation as : @xmath43}{n } + \\sigma_{p - p}^2\\ ] ] where @xmath9 corresponds to the average number of single cluster member stars in a given pointing ( within the desired magnitude range ) .",

    "this star is identified as a w uma ( v5 ) by @xcite .",
    "we are unable to derive reliable rvs for this star from our seven observations ( the ccf peak heights fall below our 0.4 cutoff ) .",
    "however , a visual inspection of the spectra suggests that star 4989 is likely a rr",
    ". these stars may be analogous to the sub - subgiants discovered in m67 by @xcite .",
    "the currently accepted model predicts that as two - body interactions lead towards equipartition of kinetic energy , we should , in a relaxed cluster , expect the more massive stars and star systems to have fallen to the center of the cluster potential dominated by the less massive stars .",
    "mass segregation has been observed in relaxed clusters of a variety of ages , from the young open clusters pleiades ( 100 myr ; * ? ? ? * ) and preaesepe ( 800 myr ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) to the old open cluster m67 ( 4.5 gyr ; * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite derived a relaxation time for ngc 188 of @xmath310@xmath76 years , which suggests that ngc 188 may have lived through at least tens of relaxation times .",
    "thus we would expect ngc 188 to be mass segregated .",
    "indeed @xcite found evidence for mass segregation in their photometric study of ngc 188 .",
    "in addition , a study by @xcite found their ngc 188 photometric variable star sample to be centrally concentrated , affirming the presence of mass segregation if their photometric variables are binary stars .",
    "conversely @xcite did not find their bs population to show significantly more central concentration than the giant stars .",
    "if we assume that bs stars are formed through mergers of two ( or more ) stars ( e.g. , * ? ?",
    "* ) , we would expect the bs stars to be more massive than the giants .",
    "hence this finding suggests a lack of mass segregation amongst the bs population , which would appear to disagree with @xcite and @xcite .",
    "therefore , we reanalyze ngc 188 for the presence of mass segregation in light of the precise membership determination presented in this paper .",
    "we compare the spatial distributions of the giant , velocity variable , and bs stars to that of the single stars ( i.e. , stars with constant velocity ) within our ngc 188 sample , and plot the results in figure  [ kscum ] .",
    "we first investigate the velocity variables by comparing their spatial distribution to the single stars . a kolmogorov - smirnov ( k - s ) test shows that the velocity variables are derived from a different parent spatial distribution than the single stars with 92% confidence .",
    "presuming that the velocity variables are binary- or multiple - star systems , then the central concentration of the more massive binary star population offers further evidence for the presence of mass segregation in ngc 188 .",
    "next , we investigate the spatial distribution of the ngc 188 bs population by again comparing to the single star population .",
    "a k - s test shows a low distinction of 63% between the two populations .",
    "we therefore do not find the full population of bs stars to be centrally concentrated with respect to the single stars , agreeing with @xcite .",
    "the majority of our bs stars are found in binary systems ; additionally , as stated above , the formation of bs stars is likely the result of mergers of two ( or more ) stars .",
    "hence their combined mass is likely much greater than that of a single star in our sample . as such ,",
    "this lack of central concentration is surprising and may provide a significant insight into the formation mechanisms and subsequent dynamical evolution of the ngc 188 bs stars .",
    "interestingly , in the similarly aged open cluster m67 ( 4.5 gyr ) , @xcite find secure evidence for mass segregation of the bs population .",
    "perhaps importantly , their sample only extended to @xmath35 core radii , whereas our ngc 188 sample extends to @xmath313 core radii .",
    "if we limit our ngc 188 sample to 5 core radii and again compare the spatial distribution of the bs and single star populations , we find 95% distinction between the two populations .",
    "thus , this restricted population of bs stars does show evidence for central concentration .",
    "we also note the seemingly bimodal spatial distribution amongst the ngc 188 bs stars .",
    "we suggest that we may be observing two populations of bs stars , with a centrally concentrated population , within @xmath35 core radii , and a halo population extending to the edge of the cluster .",
    "similar bimodal bs spatial distributions have been observed in some globular clusters ( e.g. , m55 @xcite , 47 tuc @xcite , ngc 6752 @xcite , and m3 @xcite ) .",
    "these bimodal spatial distribution are likely the result of the formation mechanism(s ) and dynamical evolution of the bs populations .",
    "scattering experiments performed by @xcite suggest that bs stars formed through collisions within a population of primarily short - period binaries may be given enough momentum to achieve long radial orbits , spending the majority of their time in the outer cluster regions where the relaxation time is longer",
    ". thus these halo bs stars may not attain significant central concentration .",
    "this result agrees with @xcite who suggest that the bs stars are likely formed in the core and ejected to varying cluster radii depending on the recoil of the dynamical interaction .",
    "bs stars that are only ejected to a few core radii quickly fall back to the cluster center through dynamical friction and mass segregation processes , while those ejected farther may remain as a halo population .",
    "conversely ferraro et al . ( 1997 , 2004 ) suggest that such a bimodal distribution is the result of two bs formation mechanisms , with the outer bs stars formed through mass transfer in primordial binaries , and the inner bs stars formed from stellar interactions which lead to mergers .",
    "we can use equation  [ scm2 ] and our detailed analysis of the precision of our measurements to solve for the combined rv dispersion of ngc 188 : @xmath77 . using the average values derived above , the resulting global value of the combined velocity dispersion is @xmath78 = 0.64 @xmath6 0.04 km s@xmath4 .",
    "this value is likely inflated due to the presence of undetected binaries ; we attempt to evaluate this overestimate below .",
    "mathieu ( 1983 , 1985 ) studied the effect of such undetected binaries in the old open cluster m67 through a monte carlo analysis .",
    "this cluster has a similar observed binary frequency and combined velocity dispersion to ngc 188 .",
    "the monte carlo simulations used an @xcite binary distribution .",
    "the results from that study suggest that for a combined velocity dispersion of 0.5  km s@xmath4  and a total binary fraction of 50% , one would expect the combined velocity dispersion to be inflated by 0.23  km s@xmath4 .",
    "given our observed hard binary ( p@xmath33 10@xmath79 ) fraction of roughly 30% , we expect a contribution from undetected binaries to be similar to the values derived by mathieu ( 1983 , 1985 ) .",
    "given the mean velocity dispersion , we can estimate the virial mass of ngc 188 .",
    "we use the equation given by @xcite , in projection : @xmath80 where @xmath40 is the line - of - sight ( radial ) velocity dispersion , and @xmath81 is the projected half - mass radius .",
    "we use the p03 pm members ( i.e. , stars with @xmath69 0% ) to derive @xmath81 = 5.8 @xmath6 0.3 pc .",
    "we estimate @xmath40 = 0.41 @xmath6 0.04 km s@xmath4 , using the correction value derived by mathieu ( 1983 , 1985 ) to recover @xmath40 from our derived @xmath78 given above , and assuming an error equal to that of @xmath78 .",
    "the resulting virial mass is 2300 @xmath6 460 m@xmath1 .",
    "this value agrees well with the total mass one gets by counting the p03 pm members ; if we assume a mass - to - light relationship of @xmath82 and use the proper bolometric correction factors , we find a total mass of 2350 m@xmath1 .",
    "our mass estimate also lies within the 90% confidence range of 230 to 2600 m@xmath1derived by @xcite with an isotropic king model fit @xcite .",
    "additionally , our mass estimate agrees with the total mass of 3800 @xmath6 1600 m@xmath1derived by @xcite from integrating an extrapolated mass function .",
    "we have also looked for a variation in the combined rv dispersion with radial distance from the cluster center , again using only our sm stars ( @xmath68 0% , @xmath69 0% and @xmath29  @xmath33 4 ) . we have chosen to plot the upper limits on the combined rv dispersion without attempting to correct for undetected binaries , and have binned the data in equal steps in log - radius .",
    "we only use the wiyn rv data for this analysis to avoid unnecessary complications from the difference in precision of the two data sets .",
    "the results are shown in figure  [ vdisp ] .",
    "the combined rv dispersion ranges from @xmath30.8 km s@xmath4  in the radial bins closest to the cluster center to @xmath30.6 km s@xmath4  in the bins farthest away from the cluster center .",
    "we note that the central rise in combined rv dispersion is likely inflated due to undetected binaries , as the binaries are centrally concentrated in ngc 188 ( see section  [ spat ] ) . indeed , applying the correction described above to the central bins would lower these values to approximately that of our farthest bins , where we would expect the least inflation by undetected binaries . moreover , this correction results in an rv dispersion distribution that is indistinguishable from an isothermal distribution .",
    "@xcite also performed a study of the radial dependence of the combined rv dispersion of ngc 188 , though with a smaller sample size than our study .",
    "they found a higher combined dispersion in the inner cluster region of 1.16 ( with a range of 0.88 - 1.81 ) km s@xmath4 , but the values in their remaining radial bins , of 0.51 ( 0.22 - 1.06 ) km s@xmath4  at 5.6 - 13 arcmin and 0.20 ( 0.12 - 0.40 ) km s@xmath4  at 13 - 20 arcmin , are similar to the values we have obtained here .",
    "undoubtedly , the combined dispersion measured by harris & mcclure in the inner bin was inflated due to undetected binaries , as that paper also concluded based on monte carlo models of observations of binaries .",
    "we have presented a detailed discussion of our rv study of the rich old open cluster ngc 188 . as the first paper in a series of wiyn open cluster study papers presenting precise stellar radial - velocity surveys , we have provided an in - depth description of our data reduction process and paid particular care in establishing our measurement precision of 0.4 km s@xmath4 . for the first time , full 3d kinematic membership probabilities",
    "have been used to study the cluster .",
    "we have thus been highly successful in eliminating field star contamination within our sample , finding 473  probable member stars .",
    "importantly , 124  of these are velocity - variable stars , providing an extensive population of dynamically hard binaries to be studied .",
    "we have used our secure member stars to produce a cleaned cmd that displays our population of bs stars , 76% of which are binaries .",
    "we also note the large scatter within the giant branch .",
    "in addition , we have discussed six stars of note that lie far from a standard single - star isochrone .",
    "stars 3271 , 1141 and 3118 are located near the giant branch .",
    "stars 1366 and 8104 are bs stars that lie below the traditional brighter blue straggler region .",
    "star 3259 may be analogous to the sub - subgiants of m67 @xcite .",
    "we have also investigated the spatial distribution of the stellar populations within the cluster .",
    "we find the binary stars in our sample to be central concentrated with 92% confidence , providing further evidence for the presence of mass segregation within ngc 188 .",
    "the bs spatial distribution appears to be bimodal , and we find no statistical evidence that the full bs population is centrally concentrated .",
    "this finding is surprising and may suggest that we are observing two populations of bs stars in ngc 188 , including a centrally concentrated distribution as well as a halo bs population .",
    "further study is necessary to determine whether this bimodal distribution is a sign of two distinct formation mechanisms , or a result of dynamical scattering during the bs formation .    our comprehensive error analysis has allowed us to study the rv dispersion of the cluster , and we find an upper limit on our mean combined rv dispersion of 0.64 @xmath6 0.04 km s@xmath4 .",
    "the results from mathieu ( 1983 , 1985 ) suggest that this velocity dispersion may be inflated by as much as 0.23 km s@xmath4  from undetected binaries .",
    "we have used this corrected velocity dispersion to estimate a mass of 2300 @xmath6 460 m@xmath1 in ngc 188 , which agrees well with the value derived by counting the mass in p03 pm members , as well as other ngc 188 mass estimates from the literature .",
    "the combined rv dispersion decreases with increasing cluster radius ; however the dispersion values in the central bins are likely inflated due to undetected binaries . correcting the central bins for undetected binaries",
    "yields a rv dispersion distribution that is indistinguishable from an isothermal distribution .",
    "the wiyn open cluster study will continue its survey of ngc 188 in order to provide membership data on all stars in our complete sample .",
    "we are currently in the process of analyzing our binary population for orbital solutions , and seek to identify all rv variables in the cluster within our observational constraints . with these orbit solutions , we will study the binary distribution in period , eccentricity , and mass ratio , and our identified rv variables will allow us to constrain the cluster binary fraction . as one of the oldest and most widely studied open clusters , ngc 188 holds the key to understanding the long term evolution of binary systems , merger products , blue stragglers , and stellar dynamics in clusters with rich binary populations .",

    "<S> we have measured radial velocities for 1046  stars in the direction of ngc 188 , and have calculated radial - velocity membership probabilities for stars with @xmath53 measurements , finding 473  to be likely cluster members . </S>",
    "<S> we detect 124  velocity - variable cluster members , all of which are likely to be dynamically hard binary stars . using our single member stars </S>",
    "<S> , we find an average cluster radial velocity of -42.36 @xmath6  0.04 km s@xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> we use our precise radial - velocity and proper - motion membership data to greatly reduce field star contamination in our cleaned color - magnitude diagram , from which we identify six stars of note that lie far from a standard single - star isochrone . </S>",
    "<S> we present a detailed study of the spatial distribution of cluster member populations , and find the binaries to be centrally concentrated , providing evidence for the presence of mass segregation in ngc 188 . </S>",
    "<S> we observe the blue stragglers to populate a bimodal spatial distribution that is not centrally concentrated , suggesting that we may be observing two populations of blue stragglers in ngc 188 , including a centrally concentrated distribution as well as a halo population . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we find ngc 188 to have a global radial - velocity dispersion of 0.64 @xmath6 0.04 km s@xmath4 , which may be inflated by up to 0.23 km s@xmath4  from unresolved binaries . when corrected for unresolved binaries , the ngc 188 radial - velocity dispersion has a nearly isothermal radial distribution . </S>",
    "<S> we use this mean corrected velocity dispersion to derive a virial mass of 2300 @xmath6 460 m@xmath1 . </S>"
