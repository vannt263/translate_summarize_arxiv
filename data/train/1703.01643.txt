    ", visible light communications ( vlc ) systems have been proposed to provide high - speed network access for office , shop center , warehouse , and airplane because of many advantages such as the lost - cost front - ends , unregulated huge frequency resources , and no electromagnetic interference @xcite . as a potential access option for the future 5 g wireless systems , vlc systems is gaining extensive attention @xcite . however , there are many obstacles for the practical vlc systems . for instance , the data rate of vlc systems is limited by the bandwidth of the light - emitting diodes ( leds ) and multipath effect @xcite .",
    "the multipath effect gives rise to the frequency - selective power fading which seriously limits the effective bandwidth when the delay spread is large .",
    "how to transmit more data on the limited bandwidth is a difficult problem in vlc systems .    in order to fully utilize the limited bandwidth of vlc systems ,",
    "the modulation schemes with high spectral efficiency should be employed .",
    "orthogonal frequency - division multiplexing ( ofdm ) is a well - known modulation scheme with high spectral efficiency , which has been widely investigated for vlc systems @xcite .",
    "as we know , vlc is an intensity - modulation / direct - detection ( im / dd ) optical system .",
    "therefore , ofdm signal for the vlc systems needs to be real - valued and unipolar . for widely - used discrete fourier transform - based ofdm ( dft - ofdm ) , hermitian symmetry should be used to generate the real - valued signal . to obtain the unipolar signal ,",
    "there are two popular approaches : one is dc - biased optical ofdm ( dco - ofdm ) and the other is asymmetrical clipping optical ofdm ( aco - ofdm ) @xcite . in dco - ofdm ,",
    "a biasing and clipping operations can be employed to make the bipolar ofdm signal unipolar . in aco - ofdm ,",
    "only odd subcarriers are utilized to transmit data , whereby the negative part of the bipolar ofdm signal is redundant .",
    "therefore , the bipolar ofdm signal can be converted into an unipolar signal by clipping the negative part .",
    "dco - ofdm and aco - ofdm have their respective advantages and disadvantages and thus we can select the suitable one depending on the application scenario .    recently , non - orthogonal frequency - division multiplexing ( nofdm ) systems have been proposed in both wireless and optical communications to further improve the spectral efficiency by compressing the subcarrier spacing @xcite . in conventional nofdm for im / dd systems ,",
    "the multiplexing usually employs inverse fractional fourier transform ( ifrft)@xcite , so that the subcarrier distribution in nofdm is different from that in ofdm , thus the real - valued signal can not be generated in frft - based nofdm ( frft - nofdm ) by employing hermitian symmetry@xcite . in general , for the complex - valued nofdm signal , the upconversion is required to implement intensity modulation@xcite .",
    "there are two methods to implement the upconversion : analog method and digital method . in the analog method@xcite ,",
    "the digital complex - valued nofdm signal requires two - channel digital - to - analog converters ( dacs ) to generate the analog signal .",
    "then , an in - phase / quadrature ( i / q ) mixer with a radio frequency ( rf ) waveform is required to combine two - channel analog signals and up - convert to intermediate frequency .",
    "the two dacs , i / q mixer , and rf waveform are uneconomical for the cost - sensitive vlc systems . in the digital method@xcite , the upconversion can be implemented by the digital signal processing which can avoid some expensive analog devices but requires the high - bandwidth dac . in both analog method and digital method , the generated intermediate - frequency signal has higher bandwidth compared to the baseband signal , which requires the electrical , electro - optic and photoelectric devices with high electrical bandwidth .",
    "the high - bandwidth devices are expensive for the cost - sensitive vlc systems .    in our previous work , we proposed the first real - valued faster - than - nyquist ( ftn ) nofdm schemes which have been experimentally demonstrated in the fiber - optic communications @xcite .",
    "ftn signal was first proposed by mazo in 1975 , which can achieve the bandwidth narrower than the nyquist frequency and the symbol rate faster than the nyquist rate@xcite .",
    "the real - valued ftn nofdm requires no upconversion and has higher spectral efficiency compared to ofdm for the im / dd systems . under the same transmission rate ,",
    "the real - valued ftn nofdm signal occupies smaller bandwidth compared to ofdm signal , which is promising in bandwidth - limited vlc systems . in this paper , to the best of our knowledge , we first apply ftn nofdm signal to vlc systems and study its performance in detail .",
    "the main contributions of this paper are as follows :    * a novel ftn fractional cosine transform - based nofdm ( frct - nofdm ) signal for vlc systems : frct - nofdm signal can achieve a symbol rate faster than nyquist rate thereby having the high spectral efficiency .",
    "meanwhile , the frct - nofdm signal is real - valued .",
    "therefore , it is very suitable for the bandwidth - limited and cost - sensitive vlc systems . * a statistical characteristic of frct - nofdm signal : we verify that frct - nofdm samples can be approximated as independent identically distributed ( i.i.d . )",
    "gaussian random variables . under this condition , the statistical characteristic of dc - biased frct - nofdm is derived . * a detailed analysis for the performance of frct - nofdm on the optical - wireless channel : the bit error rate ( ber ) performance of frct - nofdm is comprehensively analyzed under the different bandwidth compression factor , root - mean - square ( rms ) delay spread , dc bias , and iterative number .",
    "meanwhile , we demonstrate that frct - nofdm has the superior security performance .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows .",
    "we demonstrate the principle of ftn frct - nofdm for the vlc systems in section [ section_2 ] . in section [ section_3 ] ,",
    "we give the statistical characteristic of frct - nofdm signal . in section [ section_4 ] , we analyze the optical - wireless channel model and noise model . in section [ section_5 ] , we implement the simulations and give the simulation results for studying the performance of frct - nofdm in the vlc systems . finally , the paper is concluded in section [ section_6 ] .",
    "in this section , we demonstrate the principle of ftn frct - nofdm for vlc systems .        a block diagram of ftn frct - nofdm for vlc systems is depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] .",
    "different from the frft - nofdm , the inverse frct ( ifrct)/frct algorithm is employed to realize the multiplexing / demultiplexing processing in frct - nofdm . the @xmath4-order ifrct and frct are defined as @xmath5 @xmath6 where @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath0 is the bandwidth compression factor .",

    "figure [ fig:2 ] shows the sketched spectra of dct - ofdm ( i.e. , @xmath13 ) and frct - nofdm when the number of subcarriers is set to @xmath12 .",
    "the subcarrier spacing in dct - ofdm is equal to half of the symbol rate per subcarrier , which is half of that in dft - ofdm . in dct - ofdm",

    "however , in dft - ofdm , one half of subcarriers locate on the positive frequency region and the other half locate on the negative frequency region .",
    "as shown in our previous work@xcite , when all the subcarriers are used , the bandwidth of frft - nofdm can not be compressed until its subcarrier spacing is compressed below half of that in dft - ofdm . in the existing frft - nofdm signals@xcite , in order to compress the bandwidth once the subcarrier spacing is compressed , the subcarriers on the negative frequency region are not used to carry data , which is inefficient in terms of spectrum so that the existing frft - nofdm can not achieve the symbol rate faster than nyquist rate . however , when all the subcarriers are valid , the bandwidth of frct - nofdm can be compressed once its subcarrier spacing is smaller than that in dct - ofdm .",
    "the subcarrier spacing of dct - ofdm is equal to @xmath14 where @xmath15 denotes the time duration of one dct - ofdm symbol @xcite . due to the compression of subcarrier spacing ,",
    "the subcarrier spacing of frct - nofdm is equal to @xmath16 .",
    "when the number of subcarriers , @xmath4 , is large enough , the bandwidth of frct - nofdm can be defined as @xmath17 the bandwidth of frct - nofdm decreases with the decreasing of the @xmath0 .",
    "when @xmath0 is set to 0.8 , @xmath2 bandwidth saving is obtained .",

    "the directed model can be appropriately considered as an additive white gaussian noise ( awgn ) channel model . in the non - directed model , the optical power propagates along various paths with different lengths , which causes the multipath effect . in this paper",

    "the multipath effect is usually caused by two ways : one is the multiple - reflection light and the other is the single - reflection light .",

    "figure [ fig:11 ] shows the ber against the snr for different iterative numbers of the i d algorithm .",
    "the @xmath0 of frct - nofdm is set to @xmath1 , the rms delay spread is set to @xmath64 ns , and the dc bias is set to @xmath108 db .",
    "when the i d algorithm is not employed ( i.e. , the iterative number is set to @xmath46 ) , the ber can not achieve the @xmath105 fec limit although the snr is set to @xmath107 db .",
    "this is because the ici seriously degrades the ber performance of frct - nofdm . with the increasing of the iterative number of i d algorithm ,",
    "the ber performance is markedly improved .",
    "therefore , i d algorithm can effectively eliminate the ici for frct - nofdm .",
    "however , the complexity of i d algorithm increases with the iterative number .",
    "the performance of i d algorithm will no longer be improved obviously with the increasing of the iterative number while the iterative number is large .",
    "therefore , we should choose the suitable iterative number by synthetically considering the effect and complexity of i d algorithm .     for frct - nofdm signal when @xmath0 at the transmitter is set to @xmath3 and snr",

    "the iterative number of i d algorithm is set to @xmath111 and the rms delay spread is set to @xmath64 ns .",
    "the @xmath114 denotes the deviation of @xmath0 between the transmitter and receiver .",
    "when @xmath114 is larger than @xmath115 , the ber performance will be significantly deteriorated ( ber @xmath116 @xmath105 fec limit ) . in other word , the data can only be recovered accurately when @xmath114 is less than @xmath115 .",
    "this is because both frct and i d algorithm at the receiver need an accurate @xmath0 .",
    "therefore , @xmath0 can be used as an encryption key for the security communications .",
    "if the @xmath0 can not be known accurately , the transmitted data can not be accurately recovered at the receiver .",
    "it reveals that frct - nofdm system has the superior security performance for application in the security vlc systems .",
    "this paper proposed the ftn frct - nofdm signal for vlc systems . compared to frft - nofdm signal ,",
    "frct - nofdm signal is real - valued which can be directly applied to the vlc systems without upconversion .",
    "thus , frct - nofdm signal is more suitable for cost - sensitive vlc systems .",
    "meanwhile , frct - nofdm signal can be categorized as an ftn signal which has higher spectral efficiency than nyquist signal such as ofdm signal . under the same transmission rate ,",
    "frct - nofdm signal occupies smaller bandwidth compared to ofdm signal .",
    "when bandwidth compression factor @xmath0 is set to @xmath1 , the @xmath2 bandwidth saving can be obtained . by this way",
    ", frct - nofdm signal suffers less high - frequency distortion , which is suited to the bandwidth - limited vlc systems .",
    "we presented the simulations to investigate the performance of frct - nofdm . when the rms delay spread is set to @xmath64 ns ( i.e.",
    ", the channel bandwidth is @xmath67 mhz ) and the transmission rate is set to 100 mbit / s , frct - nofdm with @xmath0 of @xmath3 or @xmath1 exhibits an improvement in the snr of 2.2 db compared to dct - ofdm .",
    "this is because frct - nofdm signal suffers less high - frequency distortion .",
    "moreover , frct - nofdm has the superior security performance for application in the security vlc systems .",
    "it is worth noting that the residual ici after i d algorithm is still a critical problem for the high - order constellations .",
    "the more effective algorithm need to be investigated to solve this problem in the future work . in conclusion",
