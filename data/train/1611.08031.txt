    "betelguese ( @xmath0 orionis ) is a massive red supergiant that is destined to explode as a type iip supernova and leave behind a neutron star .",
    "one of us ( jcw ) has long been obsessed with the uncertainty in the evolutionary state of betelgeuse and has sought means to reduce that uncertainty .",
    "this effort , in various guises , has been informally deemed _ the betelgeuse project . _ an evolving team of undergraduates has participated in this project . here",
    "we report on results on betelgeuse itself , especially the constraint of its rotational state . non  rotating models aimed at reproducing the observed aspects of betelgeuse are given by @xcite and @xcite .",

    "a typical basic model of 20   begins core helium burning as the model crosses the hertzsprung gap .",
    "the model is still in core helium burning when it first hits the tip of the red supergiant branch ( rsb ) at a luminosity of @xmath5 .",
    "the model then forms a semi - convective hydrogen - burning shell and retreats down the rsb to @xmath6 , still substantially brighter than the minimum luminosity at the base of the rsb , @xmath7 .",

    "core carbon burning is initiated at @xmath9 , only about 2000 years before core collapse .",
    "betelguese is most probably in some phase of core helium burning .",
    "we evolved a grid of models from the zero age main sequence ( zams ) to near the onset of core collapse using the stellar evolution code modules for experiments in stellar astrophysics ( _ mesa _ ; @xcite ) .",
    "we computed models of solar metallicity with zams masses from 15 to 25  at intervals of 1  primarily using _ mesa _ versions 6208 and 7624 .    for one suite ,",
    "the models were non  rotating .",
    "for another suite with the same zams masses we assumed an initial rotation of 200  , corresponding to about 25% of the keplerian velocity on the zams . as we will discuss below , our results do not depend sensitively on the particular choice of this initial rotational velocity ; a lower value would give lower final velocities and a significantly larger initial velocity would be unphysical .",

    "the shell tends to sit at a node at fixed radius while the helium core contracts toward helium ignition and the envelope expands .",
    "some of the internal energy is expended in inflating the envelope and the luminosity drops as the radius expands and the temperature declines .",

    "the time to cross the hertzsprung gap is @xmath56 y. the time to evolve from the point of minimum luminosity and maximum post ",
    "zams rotation to carbon burning is @xmath57 y. the interval in which the models are predicted to have conditions similar to betelgeuse and @xmath58 between 1 and 50  is @xmath3 1000 years .",
    "the probability that betelgeuse happens to be in this special state of transition is low .",
    "in addition , these models give an excessively large gravity .",
    "we also note that the hypothesis that betelgeuse is near the point of minimum luminosity would require it to be in a stage of expanding radius .",
    "this could be inconsistent with the observation by @xcite that the radius of betelgeuse systematically decreased by 15% from 1993 to 2009 , about 1% per year ( but see @xcite ) . in the vicinity of the luminosity minimum at the base of the giant branch ,",
    "our 20  model increased in radius by about 0.07% per year and our 25  model increased in radius by about 0.3% per year .",
    "there are several possible explanations for these results .",
    "one is that we have not treated the physics of the stellar evolution properly .",
    "for instance , there may be more viscosity than computed in the default prescriptions in @xmath59 that would allow a greater transport of angular momentum from the rotating core to the envelope .",
    "we have checked this aspect by computing the angular momentum in the cores of the models at the stage of carbon burning . for a typical model , 20  , the angular momentum of the helium core of mass 6.2  with a surface velocity of 4.0  is @xmath60 g @xmath61 s@xmath62 and that of the carbon core of mass 2.3  and surface velocity of 7.0  is @xmath63 g @xmath61 s@xmath62 . in carbon burning",
    ", the 20  model has a total mass of 16.6  and a hydrogen envelope of 10.4  with an outer radius of @xmath64 cm .",
    "if the envelope had the same total angular momentum as the core , it would rotate at only @xmath65 the speed , or about 0.003  , even smaller than predicted by the models . even if all the angular momentum of the helium core core were transferred to the extended envelope",
    ", the moment of inertia of the former is too small and of the latter is too large .",
    "the envelope would still not rotate substantially faster than @xmath48  .",
    "massive stars are observed to rotate as rapidly as 500  near the zams , but while we have not explored these extreme initial values , it is unlikely that an increase of the initial rotation velocity by a factor of a few will lead to changes in the final envelope rotation velocity by the required factor of @xmath66 .",
    "another possibility is that the observed velocity is incorrect .",
    "the velocity was determined by @xcite and @xcite by the use of _ hst _ long  slit spectroscopy to map across the ( minimally ) resolved surface of betelgeuse .",
    "the result was a systematic blueshift on one limb and a redshift on the opposite of the quoted magnitude .",
    "it is at least within the bounds of credibility that the measurements were affected , perhaps even dominated , by the large  scale convective motions of the envelope for which betelgeuse is famous .",
    "a particularly interesting prospect is to invoke the possibility of duplicity .",
    "it is now known that a majority of o and b stars are born in binary systems .",
    "@xcite estimate that 19% of massive , apparently single stars ( those with radial velocity less than 10  ) are merged stars .",
    "@xcite report 17 giant stars observed with _",
    "kepler _ that show rapid rotation that might signal coalescence in a binary system .",
    "we checked this possibility for betelgeuse by estimating the mass of a putative companion star that , having coalesced with betelgeuse from an orbit close to the current radius , would have provided the requisite angular momentum to spin the envelope up to @xmath47 .",
    "if we assume the companion of mass @xmath67 is a point mass and thus neglect any internal angular momentum , that the envelope of betelgeuse was originally non  rotating , and that all the orbital angular momentum of the companion is deposited in the envelope , we can write @xmath68 or , with @xmath69 , @xmath70 and @xmath71 , @xmath72 where @xmath73 is the envelope mass in units of 10  , @xmath74 is the total mass of the system in units of 20  , @xmath75 is the final rotational velocity of the envelope in units of 15  , and @xmath76 is the radius of the primary and of the orbit of the secondary at the epoch of coalescence .",
    "this simple model suggests that the current rotation of betelgeuse could be explained if betelgeuse were born with a companion of mass @xmath77   with which it merged as it evolved up the rsb to its current position of glory .",
    "while this hypothesis is credible and consistent with the _ a priori _ estimate that betelgeuse has a probability of @xmath78% of being born in a binary system , it raises a number of interesting issues .",
    "it is not clear that that mass and angular momentum of a companion would remain in the envelope .",
    "a companion of about a solar mass would have a mean density of about 1 3 .",
    "that density is characteristic of the base of the hydrogen envelope in the models we consider here , implying that a swallowed companion might not be dissolved until it reached the edge of the helium core .",
    "if the companion plunged down to the core , the evolution might be severely altered by anomalous burning and mixing effects .",
    "the luminosity of an evolved massive star is typically a strong function of the mass of the helium core and not the mass of the envelope .",
    "if a companion partially or totally merged with the core of betelgeuse , then the current luminosity may be a measure of the core mass ( @xmath3 5 to 6  ) , but the mass of the envelope would be rather unconstrained and probably smaller than the estimates given here based on basic , single ",
    "star models that attempt to reproduce the luminosity , radius and effective temperature . guessing the prior and future evolution of betelgeuse becomes more problematic .",
    "we also note that a coalescence might have affected surface abundances , complicating their interpretation .",
    "if there were a coalescence , there might well be some mass ejected .",
    "if a shell were ejected with a velocity near the escape velocity , @xmath79  about @xmath80 years ago , then if that shell expanded unimpeded it would now be at a radius , @xmath81 cm . at a distance of 197 pc",
    ", the shell would have an angular radius of about 17 arc minutes .",
    "if the shell swept up matter , then this would be a rough upper limit to its location .",
    "there is a well  observed  bow shock \" about 7 arc minutes away from betelgeuse .",
    "this bow shock is attributed to the wind from betelgeuse sweeping up matter from the ism in the direction of motion , but it is possible that the flow of mass was impulsive rather than steady .",
    "the bow shock is rather smooth compared to numerical predictions of dynamic instabilities and is rather close to being circular @xcite , again in contrast to wind simulations .",
    "it is not clear that an impulsive mass ejection at the time of companion merging would solve these issues , but this possibility ( that is beyond the scope of the current paper ) is worth exploring .",
    "there is also an odd , very linear feature beyond the bow shock that remains unexplained .",
    "the observations also show a smaller ring of material at a radius of about 4 arc minutes @xcite .",
    "one explanation is that this is wind mass that is radiation  impeded by external radiation @xcite .",
    "such a structure could also form in the wind that was blown subsequent to the impulsive ejection we contemplate . yet",
    "another possibility is that this inner ring is associated with the mass loss at the epoch of coalescence .",
    "this would require that the mass was ejected only about @xmath82 years ago , or that there was considerable deceleration of the ejected shell .",
    "we have used @xmath59 evolutionary models to explore the mass and evolutionary state of betelgeuse .",
    "while @xmath22 , @xmath16 , and @xmath15 are reasonably easy to reproduce for a range of masses for judicious choices of the still rather uncertain distance , we found the observed rotational velocity difficult to reproduce .",
    "basic rotating models yielded the observed value , @xmath52  only near the base of the giant branch .",
    "this position in the hertzsprung  russell diagram , while unexpected , could not be completely ruled out given generous estimates of the uncertainty in distance .",
    "the principal objection to this result is that the models are only in the range of the observed value of the rotation velocity for a very brief time , a few hundred years .",
    "this is as improbable as the likelihood that betelgeuse is within a few hundred years of explosion .",
    "a major uncertainty in this analysis is the distance to betelgeuse .",
    "the estimate and associated uncertainties employed here were based on the results of observations with the _ vla _ and _ hipparchos_. unfortunately , betelgeuse is brighter than the saturation limit of _ gaia _ so that mission may not bring any improvement .",
    "other more indirect methods to improve distance estimates would be most welcome .",
    "we considered various factors that might mitigate our conclusion , including uncertainties in the evolutionary models and in the observations that determine the rotational velocity .",
    "the attempt to measure the observed rotation velocity may have been affected , or even dominated , by the convective motions of the envelope .",
    "examination of unpublished stis data tends to confirm the original interpretation of rotation ( a. dupree , private communication , 2016 ) .",
    "this issue would be clarified by repeated observations to determine if the derived velocity is stable in time .",
    "the apparent rapid rotation velocity might also be affected by the presence of a dusty disk around the star .",
    "we explore a solution based on the hypothesis that betelgeuse was once a component of a binary star system and show that if it merged with a companion of about 1  when it became a red supergiant that the requisite angular momentum of the envelope might be attained .",
    "we discuss the possibility that the various shells surrounding betelgeuse might have been associated with this merging process .",
    "betelgeuse might have been born in a dense cluster , an environment that could enhance the formation of multiples @xcite .    if betelgeuse has coalesced with a former binary companion , the task , while perhaps even more important , becomes yet more complicated .",
    "an appropriate quantitative analysis might enable the determination of the current state of evolution and hence the time to explosion , the original goal . in a future paper , we will explore the promise of asteroseismology to illuminate this issue .",

    "<S> in order to constrain the evolutionary state of the red supergiant betelgeuse ( @xmath0 orionis ) we have produced a suite of models with zams masses from 15 to 25  in intervals of 1  including the effects of rotation . </S>",
    "<S> the models were computed with the stellar evolutionary code _ </S>",
    "<S> mesa_. for non  rotating models we find results that are similar to other work . </S>",
    "<S> it is somewhat difficult to find models that agree within 1@xmath1 of the observed values of r , t@xmath2 and l , but modestly easy within 3@xmath1 uncertainty . incorporating the nominal observed rotational velocity , @xmath315  , yields significantly different , and challenging , constraints . </S>",
    "<S> this velocity constraint is only matched when the models first approach the base of the red supergiant branch ( rsb ) , having crossed the hertzsprung gap , but not yet having ascended the rsb and most violate even generous error bars on r , t@xmath2 and l. models at the tip of the rsb typically rotate at only @xmath30.1  , independent of any reasonable choice of initial rotation . we discuss the possible uncertainties in our modeling and the observations , including the distance to betelgeuse , the rotation velocity , and model parameters . </S>",
    "<S> we summarize various options to account for the rotational velocity and suggest that one possibility is that betelgeuse merged with a companion star of about 1  as it ascended the rsb , in the process producing the ring structure observed at about 7 away . </S>",
    "<S> a past coalescence would complicate attempts to understand the evolutionary history and future of betelgeuse .    </S>",
