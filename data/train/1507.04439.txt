    "massive galaxies are considered to have evolved more rapidly than less massive systems in earlier universe : so - called the downsizing evolution of galaxies @xcite .",
    "these massive galaxies have formed their stars actively by a cosmic age of a few gyr ( redshift @xmath73 ) , when the cosmic star formation rate density peaked ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "after this epoch , their star formation stopped and they passively evolved into elliptical galaxies seen today .",
    "however , the quenching mechanism of star formation in these massive galaxies has not yet been understood because the process may have occurred in a relatively short time scale , making it difficult to observe such events ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .    to seek for star - forming galaxies in young universe ,",
    "the hydrogen ly@xmath0 emission provides the most useful tool .",
    "therefore , many searches for redshifted ly@xmath0 emission have resulted in the discovery of young galaxies beyond @xmath8 , corresponding to an cosmic age of @xmath9  myr ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . among such ly@xmath0 emitting galaxies ( ly@xmath0 emitters , hereafter laes ) , those with a very large equivalent width ( ew ) , i.e. , extremely strong laes ,",

    "here we present the physical properties of this new population that is expected to be in a transition phase between star - forming and passive evolution . in this letter , we use a standard cosmology with @xmath53 , @xmath54 , and @xmath55 .",
    "in this study , we use the multi - wavelength data set from the cosmic evolution survey ( cosmos ; @xcite ) . optical imaging data with 12 intermediate - band ( hereafter , ia - band ) filters equipped on subaru / suprime - cam allow us to pick up strong emission - line objects by a significant flux excess in one of the ia bands .",
    "the spectral resolution of our ia filters is @xmath5626 , and the 12 ia filters cover the whole optical wavelength range from 4270   to 8270   ( @xcite ) .",

    ", we briefly summarize it in the following .    at first , from the cosmos official photometric catalog ( version 2012 , @xcite ) , we selected objects with a significant ( @xmath58 ) flux excess in an ia band from the frequency - matched continuum estimated by using two adjacent broad - band magnitudes . in order to identify",
    "which emission line causes the ia - band excess of these objects , we applied the public photometric redshift code eazy @xcite to the multi - band photometric data from optical to mir , which include cfht @xmath59 and @xmath60 , subaru @xmath61 and 12 ia bands @xcite , ultravista @xmath62 @xcite , and spitzer / irac 3.6   and 4.5   bands @xcite .",
    "the excess ia band and any broad bands whose wavelength coverage is overlapped with the excess ia band are excluded from the photometric redshift calculation .",
    "we adopted a line identification with the highest probability in the volume - weighted redshift likelihood function , and assigned the photometric redshift assuming the emission line enters into the effective wavelength of the excess ia band .",
    "we selected laes from these strong emission - line objects and then performed the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) fitting with the galaxev population synthesis model ( @xcite ) to estimate the physical properties of the laes . in the sed",
    "fitting , we assumed the exponentially decaying star formation histories with an @xmath63-folding timescale of @xmath6410  gyr .",
    "the chabrier initial mass function @xcite and the calzetti extinction law @xcite were adopted . the excess ia band and any broad bands overlapping with the excess band",
    "were again excluded .",
    "although other strong emission lines such as [ ] , [ ] , and h@xmath0 may enter into the @xmath65 bands , we used all @xmath65-band data in the fitting , because the effect of such emission lines is not expected to be serious for these bands with wide filter bandpasses .",
    "in addition to the multi - band photometry used in the photometric redshift estimate , we also used the irac 5.8   and 8.0   bands to obtain more accurate physical properties such as the stellar mass and age .",
    "our survey covers a 1.34  @xmath66 area in the cosmos field , that is , the overlapped area between cosmos deep region and ultravista dr1 @xcite .",
    "the wide survey area and wide wavelength coverage of the 12 ia bands allow us to search for strong laes at @xmath57 over a very large volume of @xmath67 .    as a result",
    ", we obtain a sample of 589 laes at @xmath68 . in this sample ,",
    "18 laes have both an extremely large rest - frame equivalent width of @xmath69   and a large stellar mass with @xmath70 .",
    "hereafter , we call these 18 laes massive , extremely strong ly@xmath0 emitting objects ( maestlos ) . since",
    "our main interest is the star - forming activity in galaxies , we rejected possible active galactic nuclei ( agn ) by using the irac color criteria proposed by @xcite .",

    "catalogues to reject agns . in total , 12 maestlos turn out to show evidence for agn .",
    "accordingly , we obtain a sample of 6 maestlos without evidence for agn  ksec exposure , results in no detection . the 95% upper limit in the 0.52  kev band",
    "is @xmath71 which corresponds to a rest - frame luminosity of @xmath72 at @xmath1 . ] .",
    "their observational properties are summarized in table  [ tab1 ] .",
    "their sizes are measured in the excess ia - band ( i.e. , ly@xmath0 image ) and the cosmos hst / acs @xmath73-band mosaics @xcite , corresponding to the rest - frame uv continuum , by using the galfit code @xcite .",
    "we fit the observed surface brightness with an exponential law , taking account of the point spread function ( psf ) of these data . here",
    "we fix the srsic index to @xmath74 because our data are not deep enough to resolve the degeneracy between the radius and srsic index for our maestlos .",
    "the psf images of the excess ia - band and acs data are measured by combining relatively bright isolated stars in each image .",
    "note , however , that we can not measure the acs sizes for maestlo no .",
    "2 since this object is out of the hst / acs field .",
    "furthermore , we also measure the sizes of the rest - frame uv continuum using the @xmath75-band data taken with the same instrument as that of the excess ia - band data .",
    "note that the half light radius of the psf in the excess ia bands is 0.750.83  arcsec , while that in the @xmath75 band is 0.51  arcsec . in order to estimate the uncertainty in the size measurements including the systematic effects such as the background fluctuation , we carry out the monte carlo simulation as in previous studies ( e.g. , @xcite ) . after adding the best - fit model profile to the image at 200 random positions around the original position ( in a @xmath76 region ) , we re - measure their sizes .",
    "the standard deviation of these 200 measurements is adopted as the size uncertainty . in order to check whether the object is significantly extended or not , we also calculated the fraction of the cases that galfit returned the `` unresolved '' flag , @xmath77 , in the 200 measurements .",
    "the estimated half - light radii and errors of the maestlos together with @xmath77 are given in table  [ tab2 ] .",
    "we have also carried out additional simulations . in these simulations , ( 1 )  we convolved model galaxies with the best - fit f814w - band light profile with the psf of the ia - band data , ( 2 )  then , we added them into the ia - band image , and ( 3 )  we measured their sizes with galfit .",
    "we performed 200 such simulations for the two maestlos with the extended lya emission ( nos .  1 and 3 )",
    "for which acs image is available ; note that no .  2 is located out of the acs coverage .",
    "we then find that galfit returned the `` unresolved '' flag in most cases ( 185/200 and 169/200 for nos .  1 and 3 , respectively ) .",
    "therefore , we have confirmed that their ly@xmath0 emission is really extended in their ia images . in conclusion ,",
    "the three maestlos have an extended ly@xmath0 emission with a size of several  kpc .",

    "in figure  [ fig1 ] , we show the rest - frame uv  nir sed of the 6 maestlos together with their thumbnails in the excess ia , @xmath75 , and acs @xmath73 bands .",
    "it is found that they are significantly bright in the rest - frame nir wavelengths , leading to their large estimated stellar masses of @xmath9411.1 .",
    "another unexpected property is that they show very red rest - frame uv - optical colors despite of their extremely large @xmath95 ; i.e. , the maestlos show a relatively strong 4000   continuum break in the rest - frame optical as well as the lyman break in the rest - frame far - uv .",
    "these continuum features allow us to identify the flux excess in a concerned ia band as the ly@xmath0 emission line , resulting in an accurate photometric redshift for them .",
    "in fact , two of the 6 maestlos have spectroscopic identifications and their spectroscopic redshifts agree with the photometric redshifts estimated from the ia - band excess ( nos .  3 and 5",
    "; see table  1 ) .",
    "the strong 4000   break observed in the maestlos suggests relatively old stellar population in them , and their best - fit stellar ages based on sed fitting are 12  gyr - folding timescale and a clear balmer break in the sed , suggesting that its sfr is rapidly decreasing . on the other hand , no .",
    "5 shows relatively weak balmer/4000   break compared to the other maestlos and its @xmath63-folding timescale is highly uncertain . ] .",
    "thus these galaxies form a completely different population from typical high - redshift laes with small stellar masses and young stellar ages ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) .    despite their relatively old stellar population , the maestlos have extremely large @xmath96 of @xmath97300   . in order to compare the star formation rates ( sfr ) estimated from ly@xmath0 luminosity , @xmath98 , with that from sed fitting , @xmath99",
    ", we show @xmath100 ratios of the maestlos as a function of stellar mass in figure  [ fig2 ]  ( a ) . here",
    ", we use the @xcite relation between @xmath101 and @xmath102 combined with both the @xmath103 ratio of 8.7 under the case b recombination and a correction factor converting from the salpeter imf into the chabrier imf ( i.e. , multiplied by a factor of 0.60 ) .    for typical laes",
    ", it is found that the @xmath101 ratio decreases with increasing stellar mass @xcite . on the other hand , for most maestlos",
    ", @xmath104 is comparable to @xmath99 and thus their @xmath101 ratios are similar to those of typical laes with much smaller masses .",
    "therefore , it is suggested that the escape fraction of the ly@xmath0 emission is relatively high in these galaxies and/or that there are other additional energy sources besides the photoionization by massive ob stars .    in order to investigate their evolutionary stage",
    ", we show the distribution of maestlos in the @xmath105@xmath106 plane together with typical laes at @xmath1 ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) and galaxies at @xmath1073.2 in the cosmos field ( figure  [ fig2 ]  ( b ) ) .",
    "compared to normal star - forming galaxies on the main sequence at similar stellar masses and redshifts , the maestlos have a smaller specific sfr , @xmath108@xmath6 , suggesting that their star formation activities are just ceasing and that they are in a transition phase from actively star - forming into quiescent galaxies .",
    "this contrasts with normal laes that tend to have a ssfr similar with or higher than main - sequence galaxies ( e.g. , @xcite ) .    in order to complementarily investigate the star formation histories of the maestlos",
    ", we show the rest - frame @xmath109 vs. @xmath110 diagram in figure  [ fig3 ] . comparing the quiescent galaxies studied by @xcite",
    ", we find that our four maestlos with a low ssfr ( nos .",
    "1 , 3 , 4 , and 6 ) are located around the selection boundary for the quiescent galaxies and that their colors are consistent with the model tracks where star formation has been recently quenched .",
    "therefore , this color analysis reinforces our scenario , suggesting that they have been recently quenched and are moving into the passive evolution phase .",
    "although the colors of the other two maestlos are consistent with the star - forming models , their colors can also be interpreted as a galaxy that ceased its star formation recently .",
    "the larger dust contents in these two galaxies may be expected if they are in an early phase of the superwind activity ; i.e. , most of dust grains may have not yet been blown out by the superwind .",
    "we thus infer that maestlos are in the final stage of massive galaxy formation where their sfrs decrease as gas is ejected from the galaxy as the superwind .",
    "as shown in table  [ tab2 ] , the sizes in the rest - frame uv continuum of maestlos are small ( i.e. , @xmath111  kpc ) .",
    "it is noteworthy that their sizes are very similar to those of compact massive quiescent galaxies found at @xmath7 @xcite , implying that the maestlos can be interpreted as their progenitors .",
    "it has been recently suggested that massive compact star - forming galaxies at @xmath73 evolve into compact quiescent galaxies after the cease of their star formation ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "although they are mostly dusty galaxies whose sizes are as small as the maestlos , they have a younger age of @xmath112  gyr and a higher ssfr of 0.3@xmath113 than maestlos @xcite .",
    "we therefore suggest that they will evolve to passive galaxies through the maestlo phase .",
    "our survey volume ( @xmath1142.59 and 2.723.42 ) corresponds to @xmath115 and the number density of maestlos is @xmath116 ( @xmath117 if we exclude maestlos nos .  2 and 5 with a relatively high ssfr ) .",
    "thus maestlos may have been missed by previous narrow - band surveys because their survey volumes were insufficient even in a survey with powerful instruments such as subaru / suprime - cam ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "here we compare the number density of maestlos with star - forming and quiescent galaxies with @xmath118 using the stellar mass function of galaxies at the same redshift range @xcite .",
    "we then find that the maestlos constitute only 0.20.6% of star - forming galaxies and @xmath119% of quiescent galaxies .",
    "if we assume that all galaxies with @xmath118 pass the phase of maestlo when they evolve from star - forming to quiescent galaxies , we obtain the duration of this phase , @xmath12050  myr ( @xmath12134  myr if we exclude nos .  2 and 5 ) , making them a rare population .",
    "such a short timescale truncation has been recently discussed based on other observational properties of galaxies at @xmath1 ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "finally , we mention about the extended nature of ly@xmath0 emission . as demonstrated in section 2 , three of the 6 maestlos ( nos .",
    "1 , 2 , and 3 ) have extended ly@xmath0 emission in the excess ia band , while all the maestlos are compact in the both acs @xmath73-band and subaru @xmath75-band data ( see table  [ tab2 ] ) .",
    "the half - light radius of these three maestlos in the ia - band data is @xmath1227  kpc , while that in the acs data is @xmath123  kpc for all the maestlos ( table  [ tab2 ] ) . this extended nature of ly@xmath0 emission is intimately related to the observed extremely large @xmath95 .",
    "plausible origins of the extended ly@xmath0 emission is attributed to ( 1 )  scattering of ly@xmath0 photon supplied from the central region of each maestlo , ( 2 )  photoionized gas by massive star in the central region of each maestlo , or ( 3 )  shock - heated gas driven by a superwind .",
    "in addition , there are other possible ideas to explain the observed extended ly@xmath0 emission .",
    "the first idea is a projection effect by a nearby lae with a maestlo .",
    "however , we consider that such a projection effect can not be the origin of most maestlos because of the small number densities of both massive galaxies with relatively low ssfr and laes with extremely large ews at @xmath1 ( e.g. , @xmath124 for galaxies with @xmath125 and @xmath1260.3  @xmath127 , and @xmath128 for laes with @xmath129   ) .",
    "namely , the projection probability of these objects with similar redshifts ( e.g. , @xmath130 ) is expected to be extremely low ( @xmath131 such chance alignments within @xmath132 in our survey volume ) .",
    "another idea is that a star - forming dwarf galaxy is going to merge onto these maestlos . in this case",
    ", we have to explain why a merging dwarf galaxy experiences such active star formation .",
    "although we can not determine which mechanism is dominant solely using the present data , future detailed observations of maestlos such as integral field spectroscopy will be useful for this issue .",
    "how the star formation was quenched in high - redshift massive galaxies is now the most important issue for understanding galaxy formation and evolution .",
    "therefore , large volume surveys for such massive galaxies with extremely large @xmath95 will become more important in future .",
    "we would like to thank both the subaru and hst staff for their invaluable help , and all members of the cosmos team .",
    "we would also like to thank the anonymous referee for valuable suggestions and comments .",
    "we also thank alex hagen for kindly providing us with the information of their laes .",
