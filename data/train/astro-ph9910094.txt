    "an important outcome of such  mainly optical ",
    "observational effort is the identification in cl0939@xmath04713 ( as well as in the cores of other rich clusters of comparable redshift ) of a larger fraction of star - forming galaxies .",
    "such a phenomenon , commonly referred to as the butcher  oemler effect ( butcher & oemler 1978 ; 1984 ) , is related , in turn , to an excess of late  type spirals , irregulars and mergers , when compared with the nearby cluster galaxy population ( e.g. couch _ et al .",

    "analogously , a remarkably higher proportion of the post - star - forming a@xmath0k and/or k@xmath0a galaxies ( previously termed a bit improperly e@xmath0a galaxies ) can be recognized in these intermediate redshift clusters ( dressler _ et al .",
    "_ 1999 ; poggianti _ et al .",
    "_ 1999 ) . however , also notable is the presence of a well developed population of ` old ' stellar systems as a substantial fraction of the luminous ellipticals that dominate clusters today seem to be well in place by z@xmath10.4 .",
    "the unique hst imaging capabilities at _ ultraviolet _ wavelengths allow us now to complement the above observations by exploring for the first time the _ rest - frame _ , far- and mid - uv portion of galaxy seds in this rich cluster .",
    "the importance of such data can be appreciated taking into account that mid - uv colors provide tighter constraints to the evolution in time and composition of aging stellar populations than optical - band indices do ( cfr .",
    "dorman & oconnell 1997 ) .",
    "what is more , the far - uv region ( and  at a lower level  the mid - uv itself ) represent direct probes of star - formation activity and  through the uv - upturn phenomenon  an additional clue to the composition and age of old populations .",
    "the relative intensity of the far - uv flux changes rapidly both for young _ and _ old stellar systems indeed , according either to the fast evolution of recently formed uv - bright stars or the sudden onset of hot _ evolved _ components like those observed in present - day stellar populations of elliptical galaxies .    the very limited access to the uv imaging in the past years heavily hampered this kind of studies , however .",
    "the very few papers available in the literature make use of the datasets provided by the foca balloon - borne telescope ( donas _ et al .",
    "_ 1995 , 1997 ) and the ultraviolet imaging telescope ( uit ) during the astro-1 , astro-2 missions onboard space shuttle ( cornett _ et al .",
    "these analyses could not be extended to clusters farther than z=0.23 , while the approach recently adopted by brown _",
    "( 1998 ) to get deep hst data of the ellipticals in the cluster abell  370 at z=0.375 is in turn hampered by the small size of the foc field .",
    "ultraviolet images of cl0939@xmath04713 were obtained with the wfpc2 on january , 14 - 15 , 1996 ( programme i d : 5919 ) . a total of five orbits ( 2800  s exposure time each )",
    "were spent through the near - uv filter f300w ( recording the cluster s restframe mid - uv with bandwidth @xmath3520    and central wavelength @xmath42100   ) , while ten additional orbits ( again 2800  s exposure time ) were devoted to observations through the less sensitive filter f218w ( @xmath41550    and @xmath3280    at z=0.41 ) .",
    "the adopted wfpc2 field was approximately the same as that chosen for the pre - existing , optical ( @xmath44870    and @xmath3980    at cluster distance ) f702w images ( cf .",
    "our uv images and newly in - flight calibrated , dearchived optical frames were separately aligned , co - added and properly cleaned from cosmic ray signatures .",
    "after separately subtracting a constant sky level to each wfpc2 chip ( this is made possible also for f702w frames by the higher quality flat - fielding of the data provided by the current pipeline ) , we performed aperture photometry on the f300w , f218w and f702w final images .",
    "standard hst magnitudes ( stmag ) @xmath5 , @xmath6 of each obvious source identified in our uv f300w image have been derived , together with @xmath7 magnitudes for the two sources identifiable at shorter wavelengths ( the flux , within the adopted aperture of 06 in radius , is at least @xmath8 above the noise , for all chosen sources ) .",
    "such an aperture gives the lowest scatter in our derived magnitudes and represents a good compromise between the need of picking up as much signal as possible and avoiding the danger of including more than one object .",
    "all uv / optical colors used later in our cmds refer to the above aperture .",
    "for each object detected in the near - uv final image f300w ( sixty out of the 181 classified in the optical by dressler _",
    "1994b ) we provide in table  1 our measured uv stmag @xmath5 , together with the uv / optical color ( @xmath9 ) .",
    "analogously , for the two f218w detected galaxies one can derive a stmag @xmath7 , both colors ( @xmath10 ) and ( @xmath11 ) are provided in table  2 .",
    "near - uv and optical wfpc2 images are shown in fig .  1 and fig .  2 , respectively .",
    "the smaller pc1 field has been excluded from our analysis , due to the lower signal - to - noise it provides . observed bright objects in the restframe mid - uv ( f300w ; @xmath12@xmath12100   )",
    "are typically spiral galaxies ( often with the majority of the uv flux coming from ultra - luminous sites of star formation along spiral arms ) as well as a few irregular and/or merging systems , while the optically most prominent giant ellipticals virtually disappear at uv wavelengths .",
    "however , one should be put on his guard against believing that the totality of spirals identified by hst in the optical can be easily detected in the mid - uv ( f300w ) waveband .",
    "the majority of such objects escape detection , instead .",
    "the reason why they are not conspicuous in the uv could be related either to their low star - forming activity ( for those belonging to the k and k@xmath0a classes of dressler _ et al .",
    "_ 1999 ) , or to the heavy effect of internal absorption by dust in the uv .",
    "the overall hst c - m diagram ( @xmath6 _ vs. _ @xmath9 ) of the sources detected at uv wavelengths is given in fig .",
    "the ( @xmath9 ) color derived from our aperture photometry ( 06 radius ) is compared with _ integrated _",
    "@xmath6 magnitudes given by smail _",
    "the reason is the latter magnitudes are representative of the _ total _ optical flux of the galaxies , whereas our aperture photometry , though well - suited to give reliable ( uv@xmath2optical ) colors , is not .",
    "specific diagrams within the same figure isolate galaxies for which  on the basis of the spectroscopic and spectrophotometric redshifts provided by dressler _",

    "is concerned , a conservative criterion , namely @xmath13z=0.390.42 , essentially matching that of dressler _ et al .",
    "_ , has been adopted .    by cross - identifying our uv sources and the galaxies optically classified within the same wfpc2 field by smail _",
    "( 1997 ) one can ascribe a broad morphological classification ( namely , e / so , spiral or irregular ) to the majority of objects detected in our f300w image .",
    "this , in turn , allows us to draw some basic conclusions about the appearance of these uv - bright members of each class . while spirals clearly span quite a large range in optical luminosity _ and _ uv / optical color ( @xmath14  5  mag in both @xmath6 and [ @xmath9 ] color ) , bright ( @xmath1622 ) early - type galaxies are always fairly red ( [ @xmath17\\sim$]3 ) and detectable irregular galaxies are constantly bluer than ( @xmath18  0 . as far as this behavior is concerned , no significant differences emerge when comparing confirmed cluster and field galaxies .",
    "a separate issue is represented by fainter , _ particularly uv - bright _ compact sources falling in the lower left region of the diagram and whose morphology can not be reliably identified .",
    "these objects presumably represent quite a heterogeneous zoo , including individual clumps of vigorous star formation within amorphous , low - luminosity galaxies and mergers belonging to ( or projected on ) cl0939@xmath04713 , as well as background agns .",
    "the latter case is true for our bright source no .  1 in table  1 , identified as a background qso at z@xmath12 ( dressler _ et al .",
    "_ 1993 ; hutchings & davidge 1997 ) .    the availability of ground - based ( @xmath19 ) optical colors for a large fraction of objects ( both cluster members and non - members ) detected in our near - uv image offers also the opportunity of constructing _ two - color _ , optical _ vs. _",
    "uv / optical ( i.e. [ @xmath19 ] _ vs. _ [ @xmath9 ] ) diagrams ( see fig .  4 ) .",
    "the above ( @xmath19 ) colors come from the ground - based photometry of dressler & gunn ( 1992 ) and are widely discussed also in dressler _",
    "( 1994a ; 1994b ) .",
    "hst - based and ground - based colors appear well - correlated in fig .  4 , in such a way that , _ a posteriori _",
    ", one can assume ( @xmath19 ) colors are highly predictive of the @xmath9 colors of galaxies , too .",
    "moreover , no evidence of a dichotomy between spirals experiencing steady - state star - formation and possible , uv - dominated spirals undergoing major starbursts is seen .",
    "as stressed above , the restframe mid - uv region  besides its higher sensitivity to the effect of age and metal content of _ old _ populations when compared to the optical  is quite sensitive to the presence of some amount of _ young _ stars , too ( cfr .",
    "1988 ) . as a consequence ,",
    "our newly obtained uv data provide a direct tool to investigate the present and past role of star formation processes in cluster galaxies .",
    "this information is of paramount importance in the specific case of cl0939@xmath04713 , because  for the first time  we can push our inquiry back in time up to an intermediate - redshift cluster population of @xmath15 billion years ago , i.e. to some kind of `` missing ring '' in the current observational basis for evolutionary studies ( unlike clusters at z@xmath212 , the mid - uv region of cl0939@xmath04713 is not accessible from ground - based observations , indeed ) .",
    "for instance , the comparison with uv data of present - day galaxy clusters provide a direct way of verifying whether signs of star formation activity among member galaxies persist at the same / higher / lower level when looking back at z@xmath10.4 ( at least as far as the two galaxy samples are comparable ) .",
    "moreover , when compared with suitable models of populations ( either purely old or hosting some recent star formation ) , our data allow us to establish how recently uv - bright galaxies detected by wfpc2 underwent their last episode of star formation . in the following ,",
    "analyses like those sketched above are applied to our f300w photometry of cl0939@xmath04713 .    in particular , the availability of balloon - borne , mid - uv images of the nearby coma cluster obtained by donas _",
    "( 1995 ) make it obligatory to ( cautiously ) compare these data with our hst magnitudes and colors of galaxies belonging to cl0939@xmath04713 ( see fig .  5 ) .",
    "in this respect , one should notice that the wavebands corresponding to donas _ et al .",
    "_ s uv , optical magnitudes ( @xmath22 , b ) match closely , when observing _ local _ galaxies , the wavebands imaged _ at _ cl0939@xmath04713 _ restframe _ by our own ( @xmath5 , m@xmath23 ) hst magnitudes .",
    "in other words , since we are imaging the two clusters at the same restframe wavelengths , we are allowed to compare their populations taking into account the relative distance modulus and a zeropoint shift ( estimated to be 0.65  mag ) between hst and donas _ et al . _ s photometry alone ( i.e. without applying the usual k - correction ) . unlike the preliminary , similar figure shown by buson _",
    "( 1998 ) , field galaxies are now made distinguishable from those belonging to cl0939@xmath04713 , while objects lacking a redshift estimate have been removed .    actually , when comparing the uv properties of the two populations superimposed in fig .  5 and spaced in redshift by an amount @xmath13z@xmath10.4",
    ", one should be fully aware of the heavy observational biases and limitations involved .",
    "first , the foca aperture used to image the nearby coma cluster consists of a circular aperture of about 1@xmath24 in radius , while the three wf ccds of the wfpc2 camera cover a field of 75@xmath25@xmath2675@xmath25 each . even normalizing to the same angular diameter distance",
    ", it turns out that the uv data of coma come from a fov 18@xmath26 larger , whose radius exceeds by many times the cluster ( x - ray ) core radius ( briel _ et al .",
    "_ 1992 ) ; conversely , our hst images of cl0939@xmath04713 cover a region well within the cluster core radius ( r@xmath273@xmath28 ; schindler & wambsganss 1996 ) . secondly , despite a large observational effort , the number of redshift measurements for alleged members of cl0939@xmath04713 is still confined to a few tens ( dressler _ et al .",
    "_ 1999 ) , thus implying that the number of uv - bright galaxies detected within the wfpc2 field ( 60 altogether ) which can be assigned either to the cluster or the field population by means of a reliable redshift estimate is necessarily tiny , as yet ( actually , as far as membership [ _ i.e. _ redshift ] determination is concerned , uv - bright galaxies  presumably showing emission lines in their spectrum  are favoured in comparison with random galaxies in the same field and , as such , are the objects for which the present ambiguity could be more easily removed by means of specific , follow - up observing programmes ) .",
    "finally , when seen at cl0939@xmath04713 redshift , a significant fraction of a hypothetical galaxy population with uv properties identical to those of coma cluster ellipticals would fall beyond the detection limit of the wfpc2 observations presented here , being too red ( see fig .",
    "this is confirmed by the very low detection rate of early - type systems at z=0.4 , as only one of 13 e / s0 s within the wfpc2 field listed as cl0939@xmath04713 members by dressler _",
    "( 1999 ) is detected in the uv .    as a consequence ,",
    "the remarkably different portion of cluster population sampled by the two kinds of uv experiments , together with the poor absolute statistics of suitable cluster / field wfpc2 detections , prevent us from drawing any significant conclusion about possible large - scale population differences between cl0939@xmath04713 and coma in the uv .",
    "the same is obviously true when comparing cl0939@xmath04713 and its own field . at this stage",
    "one can simply notice that c - m diagrams of fig .",
    "5 do not offer any evidence in favor of the presence  among the _ centrally - located _ galaxy population of cl0939@xmath04713  of objects much bluer ( i.e. uv - brighter ) than the bluest star - forming galaxies pervading the present - day coma cluster .",
    "this , in turn , suggests that the excess of star - forming objects noticed at z@xmath10.4 does not imply an enhanced star - formation rate in _ individual _ galaxies .",
    "however , we want to stress once more that the possibility of quantifying the role of a large - scale phenomenon such as the butcher - oemler effect in the mid - uv is beyond the capabilities of the wfpc2 uv data of cl0939@xmath04713 discussed here .",
    "as already pointed out , one can complement the above analysis by comparing the location within uv / optical c - m diagrams of our detected galaxies with that of suitable population models . in this way",
    "one can estimate how frequently individual cluster galaxies are affected by major episodes of intervening star formation ( up to continuous star formation processes , obviously indistinguishable from a very recent event ) . in the following",
    "we restrict our analysis to spheroidal galaxies alone , i.e. avoiding young - population dominated spiral and/or irregular galaxies . owing to their normally low or nonexistent star formation , ellipticals are indeed the best tracers of episodic star formation events in clusters , such as might be caused by merging and/or tidal disturbances , intergalactic gas stripping and ram pressure and so on .",
    "such a comparison is shown in fig .  6 , where model spheroidal galaxies representing passively evolving populations with / without the addition of some amount of younger stars of different age are superimposed to our mid - uv / optical c - m diagram for elliptical galaxies belonging to cl0939@xmath04713 , its own field , and coma ( as seen at z=0.41 ) , respectively .",
    "more precisely , models on the right side of the figure represent aging single - burst populations at a fixed age of 10.8 gyr ( the estimated age of cl0939@xmath04713 when adopting h@xmath29=50 km s@xmath30 mpc@xmath30 , q@xmath29=0 and z@xmath31=5 ) . only three representative galaxy masses ( 10@xmath32  m@xmath33 , 10@xmath34  m@xmath33 and 10@xmath35  m@xmath33 , respectively ) are shown here ; a characteristic time @xmath36 corresponding to 0.1@xmath26 the hubble time has been adopted for the initial starburst .    the fact that the uv / optical color of uncontaminated model galaxies in fig .",
    "6 appears progressively redder and redder towards lower - mass systems should be not surprising in view of the behavior of uv emission in old stellar populations .",
    "our adopted chemo - spectro - photometric models ( see tantalo _ et al . _ 1996 ) indeed include the contribution of hot , evolved sources such as hot - hb and agb - manqu stars of high metallicity , _",
    "i.e. _ the hot components whose onset a late ages is responsible of the appearance of the well - known uv - excess in ellitpical galaxies .",
    "since the amplitude of this phenomenon becomes higher and higher with growing galaxy mean metallicity ( and total mass ) , one can straightforwardly realize why old , passively evolved spheroidal galaxies of higher total mass appear slightly bluer in their observed ( @xmath9 ) color , an effect simply related to the higher level of uv - excess contamination affecting the sampled spectral region ( around 2100  at z=0.41 ) .    when recent episodes of star formation are added to the above models the representative points of such `` contaminated '' populations move definitely towards the left ( blue ) portion of the cmd .",
    "in particular , our computations show the effect of adding to the model ellipticals recent ` rectangular ' bursts with slightly different efficiencies @xmath37 ( within 1 - 3% ) and constant duration ( 10@xmath38 yr ) , centered at a time @xmath39 of 0.1 , 0.4 and 0.8 gyr before the epoch recorded by our observations respectively .",
    "one can recognize three major features when comparing uv observations and models :    1 .",
    "purely passively evolved populations fall beyond the detection capabilities of the uv observations discussed here ( both wfpc2 and foca ) .",
    "the same is true for intermediate / low luminosity ellipticals redder than @xmath403 and @xmath402 respectively , an observational bias giving rise to a growing _ spurious _ gap between less massive galaxy models and detected objects . 2 .",
    "secondary bursts experienced by galaxies earlier than 0.8 gyr before the observing epoch are fully reabsorbed in terms of restframe mid - uv / optical colors , independently of galaxy mass and luminosity ; this implies that _ all spheroidal galaxies uv - bright enough to be detected in our hst f300w ( as well as balloon - borne ) images did host a starburst in the near past ( typically 100 - 300  myr earlier ) or , alternatively , undergo a low - level , continuous star formation activity .",
    "_ 3 .   among the numerous uv - bright",
    ", early - type galaxies seen in coma ( and not at the center of cl0939@xmath04713 ) , signs of very recent ( and thus presumably frequent ) star formation activity is shown preferentially by low - luminosity objects . in this respect , it is worth mentioning that the existence of this kind of continuous rejuvenation for coma cluster low - luminosity early - type galaxies ( i.e. a series of overlapping short bursts ) is largely supported also by recent spectroscopic observations ( caldwell & rose 1998 ) showing that a significant fraction of these faint members do host a young population superposed to older stars .",
    "as already pointed out , our hst observations aimed also at exploring the far - uv portion of the _ restframe _ energy distribution of galaxies at z@xmath10.4 . actually , the presence of a far - uv excess ( upturn ) in metal - rich , evolved populations is known since the early epochs of uv space astronomy ( code 1969 ; code & welch 1979 ; bertola _ et al .",
    "_ 1980 , 1982 , 1986 ; oke _ et al . _ 1981 ) and _ the goal of recording its onset and subsequent evolution at intermediate redshift is still a major observational challenge _",
    "( see greggio & renzini 1999 and oconnell 1999 for comprehensive , recent reviews ) .    in particular , on the basis of current galaxy evolutionary models ( e.g. bressan _ et al .",
    "_ 1994 ; tantalo _ et al .",
    "_ 1996 ) , one should expect that  owing to the vanishing of post - hb evolutionary paths ( post early - agb stars , agb - manqu stars ) which generate most of the present - day uv - bright stars  the uv properties of old populations in giant ellipticals do show a dramatic change , when observed to a proper lookback time ( which could well fall around cl0939@xmath04713 redshift ) . in other words , looking back in time a few billion years , one should witness some kind of ` switching off ' of the uv - upturn seen in present - day giant ellipticals , thus recording restframe 1550@xmath2v colors much redder than their present value .",
    "unfortunately , the restframe far - uv emission ( f218w ) of almost the totality of galaxies detected in the restframe mid - uv ( f300w ) could not be recorded and even the upper limits to the level of the far - uv flux in individual ellipticals at z=0.4 implied by our wfpc2 observations are too high to provide the sought astrophysical constraints .",
    "more precisely , the upper limit to the uv emission imposed by adding f218w counts in the _ total _ frame area occupied by the _ whole sample _ of optically - bright ellipticals in the corresponding f702w frames , implies that one can not detect objects ( at 3  @xmath41 limit ) whose restframe uv / optical color is higher ( i.e. _ redder _ ) than ( 1550v)=1.0 .",
    "such a ( blue ) color can be reached among present - day galaxies only by actively star - forming systems , while even the nearby uv - brightest old populations in ellipticals are not bluer than ( 1550v)@xmath12 and , as such , could not be detected ( _ cfr .",
    "_ burstein _ et al .",
    "_ 1988 ) .    as a consequence ,",
    "the set of ( f218w ) uv data discussed here are inadequate to establish the existence and amplitude of the uv - upturn phenomenon typical of present - day evolved populations at cl0939@xmath04713 lookback time .",
    "this outcome is consistent with similar unconclusive results reached by other groups who observed clusters at similar distance with the same instrumental configuration ( e.g. renzini 1996 ) .",
    "this conclusion  though negative  does not imply that such a kind of investigation is _ strictly _ beyond hst capabilities , however , and is presently pushing other groups to explore alternative observing approaches . in this respect , the very recent positive result of brown _ et al . _",
    "( 1998 )  who were able to sample the uv - upturn of _ a few _ ellipticals belonging to a cluster of similar redshift ( abell  370 ; z=0.375 ) by combining two foc long - pass filters  holds the hope of exploiting successfully hst in the near future , in particularly with the planned installation of the advanced camera for surveys ( acs ) .",
    "this work can be considered as the first `` journey '' into the restframe uv of an _ intermediate - redshift _ , rich galaxy cluster . making use of hst",
    ", we were able to detect in a single wfpc2 field tens of uv - bright sources belonging either to cl0939@xmath04713 or to its close foreground / background .",
    "newly obtained uv data have been combined with pre - existing hst and ground - based optical images to derive unprecedented uv / optical c - m and two - color diagrams . while irregular and ( luminous ) early - type galaxies are well - confined to specific color ranges within such diagrams , spirals do exhibit quite a large variability in color .    in order to explore possible evolutionary effects , hst data of cl0939@xmath04713",
    "have been finally compared with balloon - borne uv data of the _ local _ coma cluster .",
    "although an _ exhaustive _ comparison of the hottest populations of nearby and intermediate - redshift clusters has to wait until deeper , wide - field uv surveys of distant clusters will become available , the limited datasets discussed here do provide interesting pieces of evolutionary information .",
    "for instance no hints of a fast evolution in the uv from z@xmath10.4 to present time ( in the sense of cluster galaxies at z@xmath10.4 hosting a star - formation activity dramatically higher than their present - day counterparts ) are found .",
