    "<S> using recent observational constraints on cosmological density parameters , together with recent mathematical results concerning small volume hyperbolic manifolds , we argue that , by employing pattern repetitions , the topology of nearly flat small hyperbolic universes can be observationally undetectable . </S>",
    "<S> this is important in view of the facts that quantum cosmology may favour hyperbolic universes with small volumes , and from the expectation , coming from inflationary scenarios , that @xmath0 is likely to be very close to one .    it is well known that general relativity is a local metrical theory and therefore the corresponding einstein field equations do not fix the global topology of spacetime . </S>",
    "<S> this freedom has resulted in a great deal of interest in the possibility that the universe may possess compact spatial sections with a non - trivial topology , which do not necessarily have positive curvature ( see for example  @xcite    </S>",
    "<S> @xcite and references therein ) .    </S>",
    "<S> interest in such spaces has also come from quantum cosmology , where the existence of the wave function of the universe may require finiteness of the spatial sections ( see for example  @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> also , in the ` tunnelling from nothing ' scenario , manifolds with small compact spatial sections may be more likely to emerge  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , there is a precise sense in which most compact @xmath1-manifolds are hyperbolic  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> together these facts have motivated the study of hyperbolic manifolds with non - trivial topology as possible models for our universe .    </S>",
    "<S> there has also been two other important developments recently : one observational , the other mathematical . regarding the former </S>",
    "<S> , recent observations seem to indicate that the ratio of the total density to the critical density of the universe , @xmath0 , is likely to be very close to one  @xcite , with a significant proportion of this energy being in the form of a dark component with negative pressure  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> regarding the latter , we first of all discuss briefly some preliminaries and recall that even though at present there is no complete classification of hyperbolic manifolds , a number of important results are known about them , including the two important theorems of mostow  @xcite and thurston  @xcite . according to the former , </S>",
    "<S> geometrical quantities of orientable hyperbolic manifolds , such as their ( finite ) volumes and the lengths of their closed geodesics , are topological invariants . according to the latter </S>",
    "<S> , there is a countable infinity of sequences of compact orientable hyperbolic manifolds , with the manifolds of each sequence being ordered in terms of their volumes  @xcite , with an overall lower bound which is shown to be greater than 0.28151  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> a natural way to characterize the shape of such manifolds is in terms of the sizes of their closed geodesics . </S>",
    "<S> a particularly useful indicator in this regard is the so called _ injectivity radius _ </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath2 , defined as the radius of the smallest sphere inscribable in @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> this in turn allows the definition of a related indicator that has often been utilized in most studies regarding searches for topological multiple images ( see , for example  @xcite    </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ) and references therein ) , namely the ratio of the injectivity radius to the depth @xmath4 of the astronomical survey up to a given redshift @xmath5 [ r_inj ] t_inj=. the crucial point regarding this indicator is that , in any universe for which @xmath6 , there would be no observed multiple images of either cosmic objects or spots of cosmic microwave background radiation ( cmbr ) , and therefore the topology would not be detectable observationally using pattern repetition , no matter how accurate the observations . despite the global inhomogeneity of hyperbolic manifolds </S>",
    "<S> this result is location independent and therefore applicable to any observer in the universe . </S>",
    "<S> similarly the set of universes for which @xmath7 are observationally detectable through pattern repetitions , at least in principle , for some observers .    </S>",
    "<S> an important point regarding @xmath2 is that its lower bound in the set of all compact hyperbolic manifolds is zero . </S>",
    "<S> thus , no matter what the cosmological parameters ( and the resulting @xmath4 ) , there will always exist compact hyperbolic universes ( with small enough @xmath2 such that @xmath7 ) such that their topologies are detectable observationally , at least by some observers , even though their number will decrease drastically as @xmath8  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> now given the potential importance of the small volume hyperbolic manifolds in connection , e.g. , with quantum cosmology , the question arises as to whether the existence of detectable topologies for all values of @xmath9 still holds if we restrict ourselves only to a set of small volume manifolds . </S>",
    "<S> surprisingly , the answer turns out to be in the negative . to see this </S>",
    "<S> , we recall an important set of recent mathematical results which show that very small values of @xmath2 do not occur in small volume hyperbolic manifolds , and that there is in fact a lower bound on the lengths of geodesics in any set of small volume closed orientable hyperbolic 3-manifolds  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> thus , for example , according to a theorem of przeworski  @xcite , the shortest geodesic in closed orientable hyperbolic 3-manifolds with volume less than 0.94274 must have length greater than 0.09 , corresponding to a lower bound on @xmath2 of @xmath10 . an important point for our purposes here </S>",
    "<S> is that it can be shown that there are non - zero lower bounds to lengths of shortest geodesics in any set of closed orientable hyperbolic 3-manifolds , whose volumes are smaller than that of the first orientable cusped manifold by any @xmath11  @xcite .    to study an important consequence of these results for cosmology , </S>",
    "<S> let us assume that the universe can be modelled by a @xmath12-manifold @xmath13 , with a locally hyperbolic isotropic and homogeneous friedmann - lematre - robertson - walker metric in the standard form [ flrw1 ] ds^2 = -c^2dt^2 + r^2 ( t ) . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , let the @xmath1-space be a multiply connected compact quotient manifold of the form @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is a discrete group of isometries of @xmath16 acting freely on @xmath16 . </S>",
    "<S> now in order to have @xmath17 , we consider a survey of depth up to the redshift @xmath5 . in this cosmological setting the depth of the survey expressed in units of the curvature radius ( @xmath18 ) is given by is identified with the curvature radius of the spatial section of the universe at time @xmath19 , and thus @xmath20 can be interpreted as the distance of any point with coordinates @xmath21 to the origin of coordinates ( in @xmath16 ) , in units of curvature radius , which is a natural unit of length and suitable for measuring areas and volumes . throughout this letter </S>",
    "<S> we shall use this natural unit . ] </S>",
    "<S> @xmath22^{-1/2 } dx \\ ; , \\ ] ] where the current content of the universe is taken to be dust ( of density @xmath23 ) plus a cosmological constant @xmath24 , with @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , and where the index @xmath28 denotes evaluation at present time .    now to examine the consequences of the above theorem in the light of recent cosmological observations , </S>",
    "<S> recall that as @xmath8 , the curvature radius increases , resulting in a decrease in @xmath4 , and as a result the set of topologies that would be observationally detectable would have to possess @xmath2 approaching zero in order to ensure @xmath29 . </S>",
    "<S> the above mathematical results , with their lower bounds on @xmath2 , have the consequence that the topology of small hyperbolic universes would be undetectable for values of @xmath0 close enough to one . </S>",
    "<S> the important point being that the range of @xmath0 for which the topology of such universes are undetectable turns out to be within the range of values of @xmath0 allowed by recent observations , and particularly those suggested by the inflationary scenarios .    to quantify this , </S>",
    "<S> we proceed in the following way . </S>",
    "<S> the above theorem gives the lower bound on @xmath2 in a set of small volume manifolds ( those manifolds with volume less than 0.94274 , which includes at least the weeks manifold ) to be 0.045 . </S>",
    "<S> this allows bounds to be imposed on the ranges of cosmological parameters for which the topology is undetectable . </S>",
    "<S> we note that 0.045 is the best estimate available at present and the true lower bound on @xmath2 may be greater . </S>",
    "<S> a way of dealing with this possibility is to consider the first 51 smallest manifolds of the hodgson - weeks census of closed hyperbolic manifolds . </S>",
    "<S> this set contains all manifolds of the census with volumes smaller than the volume of the first cusped manifold . </S>",
    "<S> we note that the volumes of the last 7 manifolds in this set differ from the volume of the first cusped hyperbolic orientable manifold by a factor which is smaller than @xmath30 , thus giving an idea of the size of the above mentioned @xmath31 for the set of manifolds considered here . </S>",
    "<S> the manifold in this set with the lowest @xmath32 is the eighteenth manifold in the census , denoted by @xmath33 , with volume 1.58865 .    </S>",
    "<S> figure  1 gives a plot of the solution curve of equation @xmath34 in the @xmath35@xmath36 plane for @xmath37 and @xmath38 , where a survey of depth @xmath39 ( corresponding to the redshift of the surface of last scattering , cmbr ) was used . </S>",
    "<S> also included in this figure is a dashed rectangular box , representing the relevant part ( for our purposes here ) of the hyperbolic region of the parameter space ( @xmath40 $ ] and @xmath41 $ ] ) given by recent observations  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> for each value of @xmath2 undetectablilty is ensured for the values of cosmological parameters ( region in the @xmath35@xmath42 plane ) which lie above the corresponding curve . </S>",
    "<S> thus for @xmath43 , all closed orientable hyperbolic manifolds ( universes ) with volumes less than 0.94274 would have undetectable topology , if the total density @xmath0 turned out to be higher than @xmath44 . on the other hand , for @xmath45 , the topology of none of the 51 manifolds of the census ( whose volumes range from 0.94271 to 2.02988 ( corresponding to the manifold @xmath46 ) , and which includes the weeks manifold ) would be detectable , if the total density @xmath0 turned out to be higher than @xmath47 . clearly , the actual precise bounds on @xmath0 depend on the precise value of the @xmath48 employed . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting allowed changes in the bounds on @xmath0 due to employing other values in the observed range of @xmath48 are , however , small , as can be seen from figure  1 . </S>",
    "<S> similarly , one can easily find the corresponding ranges of @xmath0 for any other particular manifold or finite set of small manifolds . </S>",
    "<S> the important point is the existence of a lower bound on @xmath2 for any finite set of small volume manifolds ( smaller , by any @xmath11 , than the volume of the first cusped orientable hyperbolic manifold ) , which in turn gives lower bounds on @xmath49 , such that the topology of the universe is not detectable with methods based on the search for pattern repetitions . </S>",
    "<S> , cornish _ et al . _  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite have argued that even for these large volume hyperbolic manifolds @xmath3 , it is very unlikely that the earth is in a region whose closed geodesics are as short as the shortest closed geodesics of @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , according to  @xcite the chances of detecting the topology of these ( large ) hyperbolic universes are also very low according to recent observations ( @xmath50 ) , even if cmbr is used . ]    to conclude , if it turns out , as suggested by inflationary scenarios , that @xmath0 is very close to one , then our results are significant in implying that the topology of small hyperbolic universes , suggested , for example , by some arguments based on quantum cosmology , can be undetectable using pattern repetitions . </S>",
    "<S> this motivates the development of new strategies for looking for the topology of the universe , not based on the observation of repeated patterns . </S>"
