    "the fact that the galaxies appear to be distributed along filaments which are interconnected to form a web like structure which is often reffered as the ` cosmic web ' is one of the most striking visual feature in all the present and past redshift surveys ( e.g. , cfa , @xcite ; lcrs , @xcite ; 2dfgrs , @xcite and sdss , @xcite ) .",
    "the analysis of filamentary patterns in the galaxy distribution has a long history dating back to a few papers in the late - seventies and mid - eighties by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "filaments are the most striking visible patterns seen in the galaxy distribution ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "a review on a number of physically motivated and statistical methods to define filaments is provided in @xcite . the percolation analysis ( eg .",
    "@xcite , @xcite ) , the genus statistics ( eg .",
    "@xcite ) , the minimal spanning tree ( e.g. @xcite ) , the voronoi tessellation ( @xcite , @xcite ) , the minkowski functionals ( eg . @xcite , @xcite ) and the ` shapefinders ' @xcite are some of the useful statistical tools introduced to quantify the topology and geometry of the galaxy distribution . @xcite propose to apply a marked point process to automatically delineate filaments in the galaxy distribution .",
    "@xcite studied the intercluster filamentary network in high resolution n - body simulations of structure formation in a @xmath0cdm universe . @xcite use multiscale morphology filter technique to identify wall - like and filament - like structures in cosmological n - body simulations .",
    "@xcite propose a skeleton formalism to quantify the filamentary structure in three dimensional density fields .",
    "@xcite propose to apply an object point process to objectively identify filaments in galaxy redshift surveys .",
    "@xcite propose the local dimension to locally quantify the shape of large scale structures in the neighbourhood of different galaxies in the cosmic web .",
    "the sdss @xcite is currently the largest galaxy redshift survey . in an earlier work @xcite ( hereafter paper i ) we have analysed the filamentarity in the equatorial strips of this survey .",
    "these strips are nearly two dimensional and we have projected the data onto a plane and analysed the resulting 2-d galaxy distribution .",
    "we find evidence for connectivity and filamentarity in excess of that of a random point distribution , indicating the existence of an interconnected network of filaments .",
    "we find that filaments are statistically significant upto length scales @xmath1 and not beyond @xcite .",
    "all the structures spanning length - scales larger than this length scale are the result of chance alignments .",
    "this is consistent with an earlier analysis by @xcite where they show that in las campanas redshift survey ( lcrs ) the largest length - scale at which filaments are statistically significant is between @xmath2 to @xmath3mpc .",
    "further we show that the average filamentarity of the galaxy distribution depends on various physical properties of galaxies such as luminosity , colour , morphology and star formation rate @xcite .",
    "it would be interesting to know if the statistically significant length scale of filaments also depends on different galaxy properties . in the present work we study if the statistically significant length scale of filaments depends on luminosity , colour and morphology of galaxies .",
    "further it is also possible to measure the statistically significant length scale of filaments in mock galaxy distribution extracted from n - body simulation .",
    "the model is currently believed to be the minimal model which is consistent with most cosmological data ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "it would be interesting to measure the statistically significant length scale of filaments in n - body simulations of @xmath0cdm model and compare it with measured values in the sdss @xcite .",
    "the n - body simulations primarily predict the clustering of the dark matter .",
    "this should be contrasted with the fact surveys reveal only the bright side of the matter distribution .",
    "galaxy formation is a complicated process and the exact relation between the distribution of the galaxies and the dark matter is not well understood .",
    "it is now generally accepted that the galaxies are a biased tracer of the dark matter distribution ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) and on large scales one expects the fluctuations in the galaxy and the dark matter distribution to be linearly related through the linear bias parameter @xmath4 .",
    "mock galaxy distributions with different bias can be simulated following this assumption .",
    "the average filamentarity of the simulated galaxy distribution is found to be very sensitive to the bias parameter @xcite .",
    "it would be interesting to know how the statistically significant length scale of filaments depends on the bias parameter . in the present work we test if the statistically significant length scale of filaments depends on bias .",
    "earlier we find that the average filamentarity is sensitive to the area and galaxy number density of the samples @xcite(hereafter paper ii ) and this statistics can be used for a meaningful comparison between two different galaxy samples only when they have the same volume ( identical shape and size ) and galaxy number density . in the present work we would also like to test if the statistically significant length scale of filaments depends on area and galaxy number density of the samples .",
    "finally we simulate segment cox process @xcite with different segment lengths and test the efficiency of our method in measuring the statistically significant length scale of filaments in the mock samples drawn from these simulations .    a brief outline of our paper follows .",
    "section 2 describes the data and method of analysis , our results and conclusions are presented in section 3 .",
    "the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) @xcite is a wide - field imaging and spectroscopic survey of the sky using a dedicated 2.5 m telescope @xcite with @xmath5 field of view at apache point observatory in southern new mexico .",
    "the survey is carried out in five broad filters namely u , g , r , i and z covering the wavelength range from 3000 to 10000 @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "our present analysis is based on sdss dr6 @xcite galaxy redshift data .",
    "the sdss dr6 includes 9583 @xmath7 imaging and 7425 @xmath7 of spectroscopy .",
    "the spectroscopic data includes @xmath8 spectra with @xmath9 galaxy redshift .",
    "different selection algorithms are used for different categories of sdss targets .",
    "we use the main galaxy sample for the present work .",
    "the main galaxy sample target selection algorithm is detailed in @xcite . the main galaxy sample",
    "comprises of galaxies brighter than a limiting r band petrosian magnitude @xmath10 .",
    "we downloaded the data from catalog archive server ( cas ) of sdss dr6 by structured query language ( sql ) search .    for the present analysis we use seven non - overlapping strips each spanning @xmath11 in @xmath12 and @xmath13 in @xmath14 , lying entirely within the survey area of sdss dr6 . @xmath12 and @xmath14",
    "are survey co - ordinates described in @xcite .",
    "these strips are identical in sky coverage as the ones used in @xcite and are shown in figure 1 of that paper .",
    "for each strip we have extracted two different volume limited subsamples in bin1 and bin2 ( table  1 and table  2 ) . for each strip the number of galaxies in bin1 and bin2 are listed in table  1 . the absolute magnitude and redshift limits for bin1 and bin2",
    "are listed in table  2 .",
    "the analysis using `` shuffle '' requires us to cut the entire survey area into squares and shuffle them around .",
    "the thickness of the resulting subsamples increases with redshift . for our analysis",
    "we have considered a smaller region of uniform thickness corresponding to the value at the lowest redshift . for each luminosity",
    "bin the area and number density are listed in table  2 .",
    "for each bin the galaxy number density varies slightly across the seven strips and the average density along with the @xmath15 variation is shown in table  2 .",
    "for all the subsamples , the thickness is much smaller than the other two dimensions and hence it is collapsed along the thickness resulting in a 2d distribution ( figure [ fig:1 ] ) .",
    "we study luminosity dependence of statistically significant length scale of filaments by measuring and comparing it s value in bin1 and bin2 .",
    "we label the galaxies in bin1 as faint and galaxies in bin 2 as bright .",
    "we also separately study the colour and morphology dependence in bin 2 ( table  1 and table  2 ) by dividing the galaxies in this bin into red / blue and early / late type galaxies .",
    "the galaxies in bin 1 are not divided on the basis of their colour or morphology and hence for bin 1 no cut - offs in @xmath16 colour and concentration index @xmath17 are listed in table  2 .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      all the strips that we have analyzed are nearly two dimensional .",
    "the strips were all collapsed along the thickness ( the smallest dimension ) to produce 2d galaxy distributions .",
    "we use the 2d `` shapefinder '' statistic @xcite to quantify the average filamentarity of the patterns in the resulting galaxy distribution .",
    "a detailed discussion is presented in paper ii , and we present only the salient features here . the reader is referred to @xcite for a discussion of shapefinders in three dimensions .    the galaxy distribution is represented as a set of 1s on a 2-d rectangular grid of spacing @xmath18 , empty cells are assigned a value @xmath19 and filled cells are assigned a value @xmath20 .",
    "we identify connected filled cells using the ` friends - of - friend ' ( fof ) algorithm .",
    "the filamentarity of each cluster is quantified using the shapefinder @xmath21 defined as @xmath22 where @xmath23 and @xmath24 are respectively the perimeter and the area of the cluster , and @xmath25 is the grid spacing .",
    "the shapefinder @xmath21 has values @xmath19 and @xmath20 for a square and filament respectively , and it assumes intermediate values as a square is deformed to a filament .",
    "we use the average filamentarity @xmath26 to asses the overall filamentarity of the clusters in the galaxy distribution .",
    "the distribution of 1s corresponding to the galaxies is sparse .",
    "only @xmath27 of the cells contain galaxies and there are very few filled cells which are interconnected . as a consequence fof fails to identify the large coherent structures which corresponds to filaments in the galaxy distribution .",
    "we overcome this by successively coarse - graining the galaxy distribution . in each iteration of coarse - graining all the empty cells adjacent to a filled cell",
    "( i.e. cells at the 4 sides and 4 corners of a filled cell ) are assigned a value @xmath20 .",
    "this causes clusters to grow , first because of the growth of individual filled cells , and then by the merger of adjacent clusters as they overlap .",
    "coherent structures extending across progressively larger length - scales are identified in consecutive iterations of coarse - graining .",
    "so as not to restrict our analysis to an arbitrarily chosen level of coarse - graining , we study the average filamentarity after each iteration of coarse - graining .",
    "the filling factor @xmath28 quantifies the fraction of cells that are filled and its value increases from @xmath29 and approaches @xmath20 as the coarse - graining proceeds .",
    "we study the average filamentarity @xmath30 as a function of the filling factor @xmath28 ( figure [ fig:2 ] ) as a quantitative measure of the filamentarity at different levels of coarse - graining .",
    "the values of @xmath28 corresponding to a particular level of coarse - graining shows a slight variation from strip to strip . in order to combine and compare the results from different strips , for each strip we have interpolated @xmath30 to @xmath31 values of @xmath28 at an uniform spacing of @xmath32 over the interval @xmath33 to @xmath34 .",
    "coarse - graining beyond @xmath35 washes away the filaments and hence we do not include this range for our analysis .",
    "we use a statistical technique `` shuffle '' to determine the largest length - scale at which the filamentarity is statistically significant .",
    "a grid with squares blocks of side @xmath36 is superposed on the original data slice ( figure [ fig:1 ] ) .",
    "blocks of data which lie entirely within the slice are then randomly interchanged , with rotation , repeatedly , to form a new shuffled slice .",
    "the shuffling process eliminates coherent features in the original data on scales larger than @xmath36 , keeping clustering at scales below @xmath36 nearly identical to the original data .",
    "all the structures spanning length - scales greater than @xmath36 that exist in the shuffled slices are the result of chance alignments . at a fixed value of @xmath36",
    ", the average filamentarity in the original sample will be larger than in the shuffled data only if the actual data has more filaments spanning length - scales larger than @xmath36 , than that expected from chance alignments .",
    "the largest value of @xmath36 , @xmath37 , for which the average filamentarity of the shuffled slices is less than the average filamentarity of the actual data gives us the largest length - scale at which the filamentarity is statistically significant .",
    "filaments spanning length - scales larger than @xmath37 arise purely from chance alignments .    for each value of @xmath36 we generated @xmath38 different realization of the shuffled slices .",
    "to ensure that the edges of the blocks which are shuffled around do not cut the actual filamentary pattern at exactly the same place in all the realizations of the shuffled data , we randomly shifted the origin of the grid used to define the blocks .",
    "the values of ff and @xmath30 in the 24 realizations differ from one another and from the actual data at the same stage of coarse - graining .",
    "so as to be able to quantitatively compare the shuffled realizations with the actual data , we interpolate the values of @xmath30 in the shuffled realization at the same values of ff as interpolated for the actual data .",
    "the mean @xmath39 $ ] and the variance @xmath40)^2 $ ] of the average filamentarity was determined for the shuffled data at each value of ff using the 24 realizations .",
    "the difference between the filamentarity of the shuffled data and the actual data was quantified using the reduced @xmath41 per degree of freedom @xmath42-\\bar{f_2}[{\\rm shuffled}]))_a^2 } { ( \\delta   f_2[{\\rm shuffled}])_a^2}\\ ] ] where the sum is over different values of the filling factor ff .",
    "we use `` shuffle '' to determine the statistically significant length scale of filaments in the seven sdss strips in magnitude bin 1 and bin 2 ( table  1 and table  2 ) .",
    "we label bin 1 as faint and bin 2 as bright .",
    "the top two panels of figure [ fig:2 ] shows the results of `` shuffle '' on strip 1 from bin 1 and bin 2 respectively . in top two panels of figure [ fig:2 ]",
    "we see that shuffling the data with @xmath43 causes a large drop in the average filamentarity ( @xmath30 ) .",
    "the average filamentarity increases as the value of @xmath36 increases and the value of average filamentarity of the unshuffled slice comes within @xmath44 error bars when the data is shuffled with @xmath45 and @xmath46 for bright and faint galaxies respectively .",
    "difference between the average filamentarity of shuffled and unshuffled slice is quantified by @xmath47 and the top two panels of figure [ fig:3 ] shows @xmath47 as a function of @xmath36 . in top two panels of figure [ fig:3 ]",
    "we see that @xmath47 approaches 1 at @xmath45 for bright and @xmath46 for faint galaxies .",
    "so in strip 1 from bin1 and bin 2 the filaments are statistically significant upto length scales @xmath1 and @xmath48 respectively .",
    "the results from the other strips are not shown here .",
    "averaging the results from all the nine strips we find that the filaments are statistically significant upto length scales @xmath49 and @xmath50 in bin 1 and bin 2 respectively .",
    "the right and left middle panels of figure [ fig:2 ] shows the results of `` shuffle '' for red and blue galaxies ( table  2 ) from strip 1 in bin 2 .",
    "the right and left middle panels of figure [ fig:2 ] shows that a large drop in the average filamentarity is observed when the data is shuffled with @xmath43 . in",
    "both the panels we see that shuffling the data with @xmath51 increase the average filamentarity and brings it back in agreement with the actual data .",
    "in two middle panels of figure [ fig:3 ] we see that in both class of galaxies @xmath47 approaches 1 at @xmath51 establishing that for both red and blue galaxies the filaments are statistically significant upto length scales @xmath52 . here",
    "we have not shown the results from the other strips . combining results from all the nine strips we find that the filaments are statistically significant upto length scales @xmath53 and @xmath54 for red and blue galaxies respectively .",
    "we show the results of `` shuffle '' for the early and late type galaxies ( table  2 ) in the right and left bottom panels of figure [ fig:2 ] . here",
    "also we see that the average filamentarity decreases when the data is shuffled with @xmath43 and it increases and matches with the actual data when the data is shuffled with @xmath51 .",
    "the @xmath47 approaches 1 at @xmath51 for both early and late type galaxies as shown in two bottom panels of figure [ fig:3 ] .",
    "this establishes that for both early and late type galaxies the filaments are statistically significant upto length scales @xmath55 and not beyond . we have shown here only the results for strip 1 in bin 2 . combining the results from all the strips the filaments",
    "are found to be statistically significant upto length scales @xmath56 and @xmath57 for early and late type galaxies respectively .",
    "it is to be noted in middle and bottom two panels of figure [ fig:2 ] that the red and early type galaxies have higher degree of filamentarity as compared to blue and late type galaxies at smaller values of filling factor .",
    "we reported this effect in @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to note that although the average filamentarity ( @xmath30 ) depends on luminosity , colour and morphology of galaxies , the statistically significant length scale of filaments does not depend on these galaxy properties .    in figure [ fig:4 ]",
    "we show the results of `` shuffle '' in simulated sdss ngp strips with different biases .",
    "the top left panel show the result for the dark matter distribution from @xmath0cdm n - body simulations . in this case",
    "galaxies are assumed to exactly trace the dark matter and the bias parameter @xmath58 .",
    "we see that shuffling the simulated data with @xmath43 causes a large drop in the average filamentarity of the simulated galaxy distribution .",
    "with increasing l the value of average filamentarity of the shuffled slice slowly approaches the values corresponding to the unshuflled data .",
    "it is found that at @xmath45 the two are within @xmath59 error bars .",
    "the top right panel shows the result for b=1.2 .",
    "we see a very similar result and the unshuflled and shuffled data agrees well when the data is shuffled with @xmath45 . in top",
    "left and right panels of figure [ fig:5 ] we see that @xmath47 approaches 1 at @xmath45 for both @xmath58 and @xmath60 and hence filaments are statistically significant upto length scales @xmath61 for both cases .",
    "the results are shown for one single mock sdss strip . averaging the results from all the nine strips it is found that for b=1 and b=1.2 filaments are statistically significant upto length scales @xmath62 and @xmath63 respectively .",
    "the bottom left panel of figure [ fig:4 ] shows the result of shuffling on simulated sdss strips for a bias b=0.8 . as usual",
    "shuffling the data with @xmath43 causes a drop in average filamentarity of the shuffled slice but the drop is smaller as compared to other bias values .",
    "as l increases the average filamentarity slowly grows and approaches the values corresponding to the unshuffled data at @xmath45 . in the bottom right panel of figure",
    "[ fig:4 ] results are shown for a high bias b=1.5 .",
    "shuffling shows similar results for b=1.5 but a relatively large drop is seen when the data is shuffled with @xmath43 .",
    "with increasing l the average filamentarity grows relatively faster as compared to b=0.8 and finally the average filamentarity in the shuffled data levels up with the unshuffled data when @xmath51 is used for shuffling . in the bottom left and right",
    "panels of figure [ fig:5 ] it is found that @xmath47 approaches 1 at @xmath45 and @xmath51 indicating that filaments are statistically significant upto length scales @xmath61 and @xmath52 for b=0.8 and b=1.5 respectively .",
    "these are the results shown for a single mock sdss strip and by combining the results from the other strips we get that the filaments are statistically significant upto length scales @xmath64 and @xmath65 for @xmath66 and @xmath67 respectively .",
    "it is to be noted in figure [ fig:4 ] that as the bias @xmath4 is increased the average filamentarity ( @xmath30 ) increases at smaller @xmath28 .",
    "we reported this effect in @xcite .",
    "but interestingly the shuffling length at which the avergae filamentarity of the unshuflled and shuffled data agrees does not depend on bias .",
    "figure [ fig:6 ] shows the statistically significant length scale of filaments as a function of bias .",
    "this figure shows that the statistically significant length scale of filaments is nearly independent of bias .",
    "the mean value is @xmath68 for the bias values @xmath69 .",
    "it tends to decrease for a high value of bias @xmath70 .",
    "this could be possibly related to the fact that at very high values of bias we preferentially identify only very high density regions which are mostly related to cluster like structures rather than filaments .",
    "earlier in paper i we established that the filaments are statistically significant upto length scales of @xmath61 .",
    "this measured value lies well within @xmath15 error bars of the measured values for mock galaxy distribution from @xmath0cdm n - body simulations .",
    "we conclude that the @xmath0cdm is consistent with sdss observations .",
    "the galaxy samples constructed over different magnitude ranges have different area and galaxy number density ( table  2 ) .",
    "earlier analysis in paper ii shows that the average filamentarity of the galaxy distribution depends on the area and galaxy number density of the galaxy samples and filamentarity between different galaxy samples can only be compared when the samples have same area , geometry and number density of galaxies .",
    "so it is important to know if the statistically significant length scale of filaments depends on these factors before we can compare it s measured values among various galaxy samples having different areas and galaxy number densities .",
    "we prepare two different set of mock galaxy samples namely area 1 and area 2 ( table  3 ) which have the same galaxy number density as the sdss ngp strip ( area 3 ) but cover different redshift ranges and hence have different areas as listed in table  3 .",
    "we extract three mock galaxy samples from each of the @xmath0cdm dark matter simulation for each set of galaxy samples area 1 and area 2 .",
    "we determine the statistically significant length scale of filaments for these galaxy samples .",
    "the analysis for the mock sdss ngp strip which we name as area 3 in table  3 are already done .",
    "we plot the statistically significant length scale of filaments as a function of the area of the galaxy samples in figure [ fig:7 ] . from this figure",
    "we see that the samples of smaller area tend to have a smaller length scale of filaments . but this trend is weak and the size of the error bars are quite large . we conclude that the statistically significant length scale of filaments are nearly independent of the area of the samples .",
    "we next prepare two different set of mock galaxy samples namely density 1 and density 3 ( table  3 ) which have the same area as the sdss ngp strip ( density 2 ) but have different number densities listed in table  3 .",
    "we extract three mock galaxy samples from each of the @xmath0cdm dark matter simulation for each set of galaxy samples density 1 and density 3 .",
    "we determine the statistically significant length scale of filaments for these galaxy samples .",
    "the analysis for the mock sdss ngp strip which we name as density 2 in table  3 are already done .",
    "we plot the statistically significant length scale of filaments as a function of the number density of galaxies of the samples in figure [ fig:8 ] .",
    "we see a trend of low density samples to have a smaller length scale of filaments .",
    "but the error bars are quite large and the dependence is weak . we conclude that the statistically significant length scale of filaments weakly depends on the number density of galaxies . in a recent work with sdss lrg samples @xcite having much larger area and lower density we find that the statistically significant length scale of filaments does not change much as compared to it s value measured in sdss main galaxy samples .",
    "thus the statistically significant length scale of filaments is a more robust statistics than the average filamentarity .",
    "it does not depend on properties ( size and number density ) of galaxy samples , and physical properties of galaxies .",
    "it emerges as a robust measure of the large scale structures .",
    "the statistically significant length scale of filaments could be also thought of as an indicator of the scale beyond which the galaxy distribution become homogeneous because it tells us the length scale beyond which no coherent structures exist in the galaxy distribution .",
    "multifractal analysis in sdss dr1 @xcite and recently in sdss dr6 @xcite show that the galaxy distribution becomes homogeneous at a length scale between @xmath71 to @xmath72 .",
    "@xcite considered the transition to homogeneity in @xmath0cdm simulations with different bias @xmath73 and find that irrespective of the bias values the distribution become homogeneous at a length scale between @xmath71 to @xmath74 .",
    "these results are consistent with our findings .",
    "finally we test the reliability of our method by applying it to different controlled samples ( table  4 ) of 3d segment cox process .",
    "we use segments of two different length @xmath75 and @xmath76 for simulating the 3d segment cox process .",
    "two different sets of 2d mock samples drawn from these 3d simulations ( table  4 ) are separately analyzed .",
    "the results are shown in top two panels of figure [ fig:9 ] and figure [ fig:10 ] .",
    "we see in top left panel of figure [ fig:9 ] that filamentarity decrease by a very small amount when the mock samples having @xmath75 are shuffled with @xmath43 and there are virtually no drop in filamentarity when the data is shuffled with @xmath77 .",
    "the top right panel of the same figure shows the result of `` shuffle '' on cotrolled samples of segment cox process with segment length @xmath78 .",
    "we see a significant drop in the average filamentarity when the data is shuffled with @xmath43 and the average filamentarity finally saturates to the values corresponding to the unshuffled data when @xmath79 is used for shuffling .",
    "the @xmath47 as a function of @xmath36 for these two cases are shown in top two panels of figure [ fig:10 ] .",
    "we see that @xmath47 approaches 1 at @xmath77 and @xmath79 in these two cases respectively .",
    "this indicates that for these 2d mock samples having @xmath75 and @xmath78 , the filaments are found to be statistically significant upto length scales @xmath80 and @xmath81 respectively . here",
    "the results are shown only for a single simulated mock sample . by averaging the results from all the nine simulated mock samples we find that in the above two cases the filaments are statistically significant upto length scales @xmath82 and @xmath83 respectively .",
    "we note that the values of statistically significant length scale of filaments recovered by our method for straight segments simulated here are a little shorter but close to the original values of @xmath25 used in the simulations .",
    "the simulations are carried out in 3d boxes and our mock samples are the 2d projections of nearly two dimensional samples drawn from these boxes .",
    "this possibly destroys and shortens a lot of segments and the effects are expected to be more prominent for longer segments as reflected in our results .",
    "this effect indicates that also for the 2d real galaxy samples from sdss which are constructed out of a 3d galaxy distribution , shuffle possibly underestimates the values of statistically significant length scale of the real 3d filaments .",
    "the effects of slicing and projections can be avoided if we simulate the segment cox process in 2d as in this case the segments lie on the same plane ( figure [ fig:11 ] ) .",
    "we apply shuffle to a set of mock 2d strips constructed out of simulations of 2d segment cox process ( table  5 ) .",
    "we use two different segment lengths @xmath84 and @xmath76 to simulate the 2d segment cox process .",
    "we use the same segment lengths as used in the simulations of 3d segment cox process so as to test the effect of slicing and projection .",
    "we show the results in bottom two panels of figure [ fig:9 ] and figure [ fig:10 ] .",
    "bottom left panel of figure [ fig:9 ] shows that when the mock samples with @xmath84 are shuffled with @xmath43 the average filamentarity of the shuffled data falls below that of the unshuffled data .",
    "the average filamentarity of the shuffled data saturates to the unshuffled data when the data is shuffled with @xmath85 .",
    "the bottom right panel of figure [ fig:9 ] shows a significant drop in the average filamentarity when the mock samples with @xmath76 are shuffled with @xmath43 .",
    "the average filamentarity of the shuffled data increases slowly with increasing shuffling length and finally saturates to the unshuffled data at shuffling length @xmath45 .",
    "we see in bottom two panels of figure [ fig:10 ] the @xmath47 as a function of @xmath36 approaches 1 at @xmath85 and @xmath45 in these two cases respectively .",
    "this indicates that for these controlled samples of 2d segment cox process having @xmath75 and @xmath86 , the filaments are statistically significant upto length scales @xmath87 and @xmath61 respectively .",
    "we have shown the results for a single simulated strip in these plots .",
    "we combine the results from all the nine simulated strips and find that the filaments are statistically significant upto length scales @xmath88 and @xmath89 for simulations of 2d segment cox process with segment length @xmath75 and @xmath76 respectively .",
    "we note that our method can successfully recover better the length of inputted segments when the mock samples are drawn from simulations of 2d segment cox process where the effects of slicing and projections are absent",
    ". there would be another effect due to the boundaries of the samples which again shortens the length of some segments near the boundaries but this effect is not so important in our analysis as the extent of the samples are much larger than the length of the inputted segments .",
    "this analysis suggets that the actual length scale of the real 3d filaments can be recovered with shuffle if the analysis is extended in 3d .",
    "we propose to take up this in a future work .    in conclusion",
    "we note that although the average filamentarity of the galaxy distribution depends on different galaxy properties , the statistically significant length scale of filaments does not depend on luminosity , colour and morphology of galaxies .",
    "we find that the measured values of the statistically significant length scale of filaments in sdss are consistent with that measured from @xmath0cdm simulations .",
    "we considered the @xmath0cdm model with different values of bias and find that the statistically significant length scale of filaments is nearly independent of bias .",
    "different class of galaxies are differently biased with respect to underlying dark matter distribution and this result is possibly related to the fact that statistically significant length scale of filaments is nearly the same for different class of galaxies .",
    "unlike the average filamentarity , the statistically significant length scale of filaments is nearly independent of the area and galaxy number density of the samples .",
    "this establishes the statistically significant length scale of filaments as a robust statistics of galaxy distribution .",
