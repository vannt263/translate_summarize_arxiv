    "we have studied how curvature and in particular confinement can effectively modify casimir interactions between an atom and a curved surface and between atoms confined in perfectly conducting cylindrical cavities . for the interaction between a single atom and a cylindrical shell",
    "we have developed both large and short distance expansions that apply in the zero and high temperature limits , and for an interior and exterior atom .",

    "our results are relevant to understand the scattering of atoms at curved surfaces as , e.g. , nanotubes .",
    "we have considered both the retarded and non - retarded limits . for the latter ,",
    "we have shown that it is simply related to the classical ( high temperature ) limit of the casimir - polder potential .",
    "a problem with a higher degree of complexity is the interaction of a macroscopic spherical particle with a confining cylindrical shell .",
    "we have considered the limit of perfect conductivity for both the particle and the shell . by computing the interaction numerically from a large number of mulipole moments",
    ", we were able to compare to the proximity force approximation ( pfa ) and its correction as predicted by a gradient expansion .",
    "we found nice agreement , confirming that the gradient expansion makes reliable predictions also for interior problems .",
    "we have shown that the casimir - polder interaction of two atoms is modified when the atoms are confined by perfectly conducting cylindrical shell , and their distance is comparable or larger than the radius of the shell . this is due to the fact that casimir interactions are not pairwise additive .",
    "we have considered the limits of zero and high temperature , both in the retarded and non - retarded cases . in all situations ,",
    "the interaction is substantially reduced compared to free space and decays exponentially over the scale of the radius of the shell .",
    "although we assumed a perfectly conducting cylindrical shell , we expect that our conclusion remain qualitatively unchanged for general dielectric materials .",
    "our findings are partially complementary to other studies of the fluctuation induced interactions between confined atoms or molecules .",
    "previous work for two atoms placed between two parallel perfect metal plates  @xcite showed that at zero temperature the interaction energy is reduced from the free space case with an exponential decay in the non - retarded limit , and increased in the retarded case with a change from @xmath241 to @xmath242 when @xmath130 is much bigger than the distance @xmath243 between the plates .",
    "for the same geometry , an exponential decay was also found at any finite temperature @xcite .",
    "an exponential reduction of the interaction between the atoms has been also observed when they are confined in a rectangular waveguide and their distance is large compared to the diameter of the waveguide @xcite .",
    "contrary to that , a recent study of two atoms placed inside a transmission line consisting of two concentric metallic cylinders demonstrated a huge amplification of the interaction between the atoms due to the one - dimensional character of _ propagating _ fluctuations in this geometry @xcite .",
    "if confinement leads to reduction or amplification of inter - molecular fluctuation forces has important consequences for the ( non-)additivity of these forces , and hence the electromagnetic response of confined gases .",
    "therefore , it is important to understand the mechanism that determines the effect of confinement on the interaction .",
    "in general , a massive fluctuation mode leads to an exponential decay of the associated interaction energy . in waveguides ,",
    "massive modes are realized by evanescent modes due to the existence of finite cutoff frequencies for these modes . clearly , all modes in our cylindrical shell , and also in the rectangular waveguide of ref .",
    "@xcite are massive , explaining an exponential reduction of the interaction . however , for two parallel conducting plates , there exists a massless mode only for tm polarization @xcite .",
    "since this propagating mode contributes for two particles with electric polarizability only in the retarded limit , the interaction is not exponentially suppressed but enhanced in this limit .",
    "hence the situation resembles that of the transmission line . it would be interesting to establish corresponding results for non - equilibrium effects in confined geometries .",
