    "the radiation we receive from asteroids at visible wavelengths is sunlight scattered by the solid surfaces of the objects .",
    "the scattering process polarizes the emerging photon flux , with the most general state of polarization being partial elliptical polarization . in the case of asteroid scattering ,",
    "linear polarization dominates over circular and is modulated by the properties of the surface ( e.g. albedo , texture , composition , regolith size ) and the illumination conditions .",
    "measuring the degree of linear polarization can diagnose physical conditions of the scattering surface and is complementary to photometry and spectroscopy for the remote analysis of small solar system objects .    a common way to quantify the polarization of light",
    "is by using the stokes vectors @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 , & @xmath3 , where @xmath0 is the total intensity , @xmath1 the amount of light polarized in the @xmath4 or @xmath5 planes , @xmath2 the light in the @xmath6 or @xmath7 planes , and @xmath3 the light polarized circularly with left- or right - handedness . in particular , stokes @xmath1 and @xmath2 fully describe the state of linear polarization . for cases of linear polarization ,",
    "@xmath1 and @xmath2 can be converted into a measure of the total degree of polarization ( @xmath8 ) and the position angle of polarization ( @xmath9 ) using : @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "the reference for the position angle of polarization is typically celestial north , though definitions in the instrument frame or the galactic frame can also be used if convenient . in asteroid polarimetry",
    "it is found that with few exceptions the orientation of the plane of linear polarization is perpendicular or parallel to the scattering plane : the plane encompassing the sun , the target , and the observer .",
    "since most scattering cases result in light polarized perpendicular to the scattering plane we define that direction as the reference for polarization position angle .",
    "the new degree of polarization is then defined as @xmath12 where @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the intensities of light perpendicular and parallel to the scattering plane , respectively . for this definition",
    ", @xmath15 will be positive for the `` normal '' scattering case , or negative if the scattered light is polarized in the plane of scattering .",
    "this allows us to refer to polarization of an asteroid as either `` positive '' or `` negative '' and still be completely descriptive .",
    "the primary observable in asteroid polarimetric studies is the change in percent polarization @xmath15 as a function of phase angle ( the angle between the sun and the earth as seen from the asteroid ) .",
    "close to zero phase angle @xmath15 tends to zero , but as the phase angle increases @xmath15 becomes increasingly negative .",
    "this is the so - called branch of negative polarization . after reaching a maximum negative value usually between @xmath16 and @xmath17 phase angle ,",
    "@xmath15 decreases in absolute value ( that is , becomes depolarized ) and reaches zero at the so - called inversion angle ( @xmath18 ) usually between @xmath19 and @xmath20 phase .",
    "the maximum value of negative polarization is an important parameter , usually indicated as @xmath21 , and varies mostly between @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "measurements of @xmath21 can be used to calculate albedo @xcite , and can be used along with inversion angle as an indication of surface texture @xcite .    beyond",
    "the inversion angle @xmath15 becomes re - polarized in the positive sense , increasing nearly linearly with phase .",
    "the slope ( @xmath24 ) of the branch of positive polarization for phase angles greater than the inversion angle is another important parameter , since it is known to be diagnostic of the albedo of the surface ( see , e.g. * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "the maximum value of positive polarization is reached at values of phase which are well beyond the maximum values attainable by main belt asteroids observed from earth .",
    "only near - earth objects are occasionally visible over very large intervals of phase angle , and the maximum value of positive polarization is observed in some cases to occur at phase angles of the order of @xmath25 - @xmath26 degrees .",
    "@xcite review the many possible physical models that have been used to try to explain the negative polarization seen in asteroid phase curves .",
    "the most promising are the coherent backscattering models , described in e.g. @xcite , which can explain both the photometric opposition surge observed for atmosphereless bodies as well as the negative polarization seen for asteroids at small phase angles .",
    "the polarimetric effect in this theory has a strong dependence on the size and spacing of the scattering particles meaning that surface chemistry and mineralogy should play a large role in determining the polarization as a function of phase . according to @xcite",
    ", coherent backscattering is the key physical process generating both these effects .    as part of an extensive campaign to characterize the polarization - phase curves of over @xmath26 asteroids @xcite found an interesting case in the asteroid ( 234 ) barbara , which was found to exhibit an unusual polarimetric behavior .",
    "whereas most asteroids have an inversion angle of around @xmath20 barbara shows strong negative polarization ( @xmath27 ) for phase angles larger than @xmath28 .",
    "the authors proposed that this strange behavior was due to unusual surface properties , likely the surface mineralogy driving the rare ld - type classification .",
    "@xcite performed a follow - up investigation of other",
    "l / ld - type asteroids , finding four that show these unusual polarization properties .",
    "while not all l - type asteroids show this effect ( e.g. ( 12 ) victoria , see @xcite ) , both barbara and ( 980 ) anacostia from @xcite s survey show strong spinel features in their ir spectra @xcite .",
    "@xcite identified strong spinel features in the ir spectra of both ( 387 ) aquitania and anacostia , so we investigated aquitania to look for the same strange polarization signatures seen in other spinel - rich l - types .",
    "observations of the asteroids ( 387 ) aquitania and ( 234 ) barbara were conducted on four nights spread from january to june 2008 on the university of hawaii @xmath29 m telescope located on mauna kea , hawaii .",
    "polarizations were measured with the dual - beam imaging polarimeter ( dbip , @xcite ) , a broad - band ccd imaging system sensitive to both linear and circular polarizations simultaneously .",
    "dbip has very low instrumental systematics and can reach polarization precisions of better than @xmath30 .",
    "dbip uses an ir - blocked clear filter which transmits from @xmath31 nm , a close approximation to a sloan @xmath32 filter .",
    "although there is some evidence for color dependence of polarization @xcite , the difference in measured polarization between p@xmath33 and p@xmath34 is usually within error .",
    "v and r band polarizations of barbara showing this consistency can be seen in fig  [ fig.obs ] . using a broader",
    "filter does not impair our measurements of the bulk polarization properties .",
    "stokes parameters were measured for our targets using a beam - swapping pattern of waveplate alignments .",
    "each image measured complimentary values of a single stokes vector ( i.e. @xmath35 in the north beam and @xmath36 in the south beam ; @xmath37 north and @xmath38 south ; or @xmath39 north and @xmath40 south ) which were then swapped in a second image . by combining both images we were able to completely remove time - dependent and flat - field effects on the measured polarization values .",
    "individual exposure times were adjusted so that each image of our target had a peak count value on the ccd between @xmath41 and @xmath42 counts per pixel to provide enough photons for good statistics while avoiding non - linear issues near saturation .",
    "image reduction was completed as described in @xcite .",
    "dbip s native polarization measurement is of the fractional values @xmath43 and @xmath44 , which can be converted to @xmath8 and @xmath9 , as well as @xmath45 . table  [ tab.obs ] presents the asteroid name , ut date of observation , apparent v magnitude , total exposure time , phase angle ( @xmath46 ) , measured linear polarization ( @xmath15 ) , angle of polarization ( @xmath9 ) and measured circular polarization .",
    "total listed exposure time includes all six waveplate positions needed to develop a full measurement of @xmath47 , @xmath48 , and @xmath49 .",
    "the linear polarization measurements and angles of polarization have been rotated into the frame of the asteroid scattering plane .",
    "the circular polarization values in all cases are consistent with a zero signal to within @xmath50 , and thus we do not detect any circular polarization of the light scattered from these asteroids .",
    "circular polarization is predicted to appear on asteroids that have surfaces containing powdered metals , especially those with highly irregular shapes @xcite , however circular polarization as of yet has not been detected from an asteroid ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "polarized and unpolarized standard star measurements were taken each night in addition to the asteroid observations .",
    "standards were drawn from @xcite as well as the standard list published for keck / lrisp which includes the _ hubble _ standards @xcite .",
    "standard measurements showed that induced instrumental polarization , systematic depolarization and instrumental crosstalk were all below the @xmath30 level , and so are not included in the data tables .",
    "see   [ calib ] for further discussion on systematic error determination .",
    "our linear polarization data are shown in figure  [ fig.obs ] along with the barbara data presented in @xcite , @xcite ( these data also published in @xcite as the torino observations ) , and the casprof data from @xcite . in addition , two comparison phase curves are also plotted .",
    "the first is the fit by @xcite to polarization data from ( 24 ) themis , a member of the b taxonomic class .",
    "b - type and c - type asteroids typically show the deepest negative polarization branches . the other curve is a fit by @xcite of data for ( 12 ) victoria , a typical l - class object .",
    "although different fitting models were used in these two cases , both models are qualitatively the same at the phase angles of interest .",
    "note that aquitania was classified as an l - class and barbara as an ld - class by @xcite whereas both are now l - class under the classification system of @xcite but show very different polarization features from other l - class objects .",
    "following the calibrations reported in @xcite a quarterwave retarder was added in series with the halfwave retarder affecting the instrumental systematics , especially crosstalk between linear and circular polarization . to quantify these instrumental errors ,",
    "extensive lab bench crosstalk calibrations were performed .",
    "details of the calibration procedure can be found in @xcite , and are briefly summarized here .",
    "figure  [ fig.crosstalk ] shows the measured polarization state for an input of pure linear polarization stepped through @xmath51degrees both without and with a fixed quarterwave plate in the light path ( figs  [ fig.crosstalk]a and [ fig.crosstalk]b , respectively ) .",
    "ideally the former test should show pure @xmath1 and @xmath2 polarization as offset sinusoids peaking at @xmath52 with zero @xmath3 polarization , while the latter test should show offset @xmath1 and @xmath3 ( in this case , the @xmath2 that is in the same phase as @xmath1 indicates a slight misalignment of the quarterwave plate at the input , while the out of phase @xmath2 indicates crosstalk ) .",
    "a chi - squared minimizer was used to fit the measured variations in the stokes vectors to determine crosstalk and depolarization . in all cases ,",
    "the crosstalk and depolarization were found to be a few percent of the input polarization , so that for sources with `` typical '' polarizations ( i.e. @xmath53 ) the errors are comparable to the desired statistical errors of @xmath54 polarization , as has been measured for polarized and unpolarized standards .",
    "the new measurements of ( 234 ) barbara presented here agree with those from @xcite and @xcite . despite very different optical designs , data acquisition methods , observing circumstances , and physical locations , the consistency between our results and",
    "those from previous work ( e.g. @xcite ) indicate that comparisons and combinations of results from these instruments are legitimate .",
    "the similarity between the barbara and ( 387 ) aquitania polarization values clearly point toward aquitania being a member of the new class of large inversion angle ( lia , or `` barbarian '' ) asteroids that includes barbara , ( 172 ) baucis , ( 236 ) honoria , ( 679 ) pax and ( 980 ) anacostia @xcite .",
    "barbara , aquitania , and anacostia all show strong @xmath55 spinel features in their ir spectra @xcite implying a mineralogical origin to the unusual polarization properties of these asteroids .",
    "the other three lia objects do not currently have published ir spectral coverage at @xmath55 , but we predict that they too will show the same spinel feature .",
    "@xcite explain that a spinel - rich spectrum can be used as a tracer of calcium - aluminum - rich inclusions ( cais ) , one of the oldest known materials in the solar system , as determined from meteorite chemical analysis ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite propose that the surfaces of these bodies may be coarse regoliths of a dark matrix mixed with smaller white inclusions .",
    "this mixing of two components with different albedos can alter the behavior of bulk polarization as a function of phase and explain the large inversion angle seen in these objects .",
    "the authors point out that their sample of lia asteroids covers a wide range of semimajor axis - space ( @xmath56au ) and thus can not be fragments from a single parent body .",
    "table  [ tab.ast ] shows that aquitania has orbital and physical properties fairly similar to those of anacostia @xcite .",
    "this similarity was also pointed out by @xcite when they were both identified as spinel - bearing asteroids .",
    "however , it is very unlikely that these two objects originate from the same parent body , based on the velocity spread between their orbits compared to those seen for other disrupted bodies and dynamical families @xcite . in other words ,",
    "if both aquitania and anacostia were fragments from the collisional disruption of a common parent body , the difference in orbital elements would imply unrealistic ejection velocities of the order of many km / sec .",
    "moreover , given the non - negligible sizes of aquitania and anacostia , such a collisional event should also be expected to have generated an important dynamical family that should be possible to identify even after a very long time .",
    "such a family , however , is simply not found .",
    "it is worth noting that of the six asteroids now identified as lia objects four have periods longer than @xmath57 hours when the average for these sizes is @xmath58hours .",
    "though still a victim of small number statistics , if this trend of long rotation periods holds for other lia asteroids it may indicate that they are characterized by rotation periods significantly longer than the typical values found for most large main belt asteroids @xcite .",
    "this would imply a highly porous , `` fluffy '' internal structure that is very efficient at absorbing energy from impacts without transferring it into an increase in rotation rate .",
    "this kind of structure is similar to what was observed for the tagish lake meteorite @xcite and what is expected for carbonaceous chondrites in which all cais found thus far have been observed @xcite .",
    "this would support the theory proposed by @xcite that spinel - bearing asteroids , and thus probably all lias , are composed of pristine material from the beginning of the solar system .",
    "we note also that long spin periods might also be diagnostic of binarity , although any physical reason for a correlation between binarity and anomalous polarimetric properties remains unknown .",
    "the authors wish to recognize and acknowledge the very significant cultural role and reverence that the summit on mauna kea has always had within the indigenous hawaiian community .",
    "we are most fortunate to have the opportunity to conduct observations from this sacred mountain .",
    "we appreciate the helpful comments from reviewers r. gil - hutton and i. belskaya which greatly improved this paper .",
