    "thus , the natural question to ask is whether there also exists phase transition in the black hole thermodynamics .",
    "in fact , since the pioneering work of davies@xcite and the well - known hawking - page phase transition@xcite were proposed , the question has been answered partly .",
    "the phase transitions and critical phenomena in _ four and higher _ dimensional ads black holes have been studied extensively@xcite . recently , some interesting works on asymptotically anti - de sitter black holes have been done , which show that there exists phase transition similar to the van der waals liquid / gas phase transition@xcite .",
    "the properties of black hole are relevant to the dimension of spacetime .",
    "thus we want to know whether the similar phase transition exists for lower dimensional black holes .",
    "the key advantage of lower dimensional black holes lies in the simplicity of the construction .",
    "although just mathematical abstraction , lower dimensional black holes can be applied to physical reality in some special cases . hence it can be interesting to investigate the possibility that a lower dimensional black hole does exhibit a phase transition .",
    "btz black hole is an important solution of general relativity with negative cosmological constant in three - dimensional spacetime@xcite .",
    "the btz black hole is free of singularity and closely related with the recent developments in gravity , gauge theory and string theory@xcite .    in general relativity and many other theories of gravity",
    ", curvature plays an essential role , while torsion has received less attention .",
    "however , torsion also has its geometrical meaning and plays some roles in gravitation theory . since the 1970s , many theories of gravity with torsion have been proposed , such as poincar gauge gravity , de sitter gauge gravity , teleparallel gravity , @xmath1 gravity , etc . in particular ,",
    "mielke and baekler proposed a model of three - dimensional gravity with torsion ( the mb model ) , which also has btz black hole as solution@xcite .",
    "this model aroused the following research on the thermodynamics of the btz black hole with torsion ( _ btzt black hole _ for short ) and ads / cft with torsion@xcite .",
    "in @xcite we have verified that for the btzt black hole phase transition may exist . in this paper",
    "we will investigate the type of the phase transition and calculate the critical exponents .",
    "although the btz solution is the same as the one obtained in gr , the different actions will make their thermodynamics very different .",
    "the modified action in the mb model will modify the conserved charges such as mass and angular momentum .",
    "correspondingly the entropy of btz black hole and the first law of black hole thermodynamics will also been changed .",
    "it is shown that the heat capacity of the btz black hole in the mb model is not always positive any more , but changes signs at some points and may diverge at the critical point .",
    "thus for the btzt black hole in the mb model phase transition exists . according to ehrenfest s classification we also consider the gibbs free energy , the isothermal compressibility and the expansion coefficient as functions of temperature .",
    "it is shown that the kind of phase transition for the btzt black hole belong to the second - order one or continuous one .",
    "the paper is arranged as follows : in the next section we simply introduce the mb model and its btz - like solution and the corresponding thermodynamic quantities . in section 3 according to ehrenfest s classification we will analyze the type of the phase transition of the btzt black hole in the extended phase space . in section 4 the case with",
    "non - extended phase space will be discussed and the critical behaviors are investigated .",
    "we make some concluding remarks in section 5 .",
    "first we should review the topological three - dimensional gravity model with torsion proposed by mielke and baekler@xcite , which is a natural generalization of riemannian gr with a cosmological constant . defining curvature and torsion 2-forms out of @xmath2 and coframe @xmath3 by t^a&=&de^a+^a _",
    "be^b , + r^a _  b&=&d^a _  b+^a _",
    "c^c _  b , the gravitational action is written as [ action ] i=2e^ar_a-_abce^ae^be^c+_3 ( ^ad_a+_abc^a^b^c ) + _",
    "4e^at_a  , where the dual expression , @xmath4 and @xmath5 are defined by @xmath6 and @xmath7 . in eq.([action ] ) the first term corresponds to the einstein - cartan action , with @xmath8 .",
    "the second one is the cosmological term .",
    "the last two terms are the chern - simons term and the nieh - yan term , which should be given particular attention .",
    "the nieh - yan(n - y ) form is a special 2-form only for the riemann - cartan geometry@xcite . on the four - dimensional manifold @xmath9",
    "it can be written as & & n = t^at_a+r_abe^ae^b = dq_ny , + & & q_ny = e^at_a the n - y form is a kind of chern - simons form and will have its application to manifolds with boundaries and reflect the role of torsion in geometry .",
    "after variation to @xmath2 and @xmath3 , two vacuum equations can be obtained from the mb action ( [ action ] ) t^a&=&^a _",
    "bce^be^c , + r^a&=&^a _",
    "bce^be^c , with the two constant coefficients @xmath10 defined by @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "the curvatures in einstein - cartan geometry can be connected to their counterparts in riemannian geometry . in particular , in three - dimensional spacetime , the equations above can be simplified to equations without torsion [ notorsion ] ^a=^a _  bce^be^c , where @xmath13 is the curvature without torsion and @xmath14 is the effective cosmological constant .",
    "one can let @xmath15 to construct an asymptotically anti - de sitter space",
    ".    as in the three - dimensional einstein equation , eq.([notorsion ] ) has the well - known btz solution .",
    "but in this case , torsion is contained in the gravitational action .",
    "the metric is ds^2=-n ( r ) ^2dt^2+dr^2+r^2 ( d+n_dt ) ^2 where @xmath16here we have considered @xmath17 .",
    "this metric is the same as the one in gr , except that @xmath18 here and a constant torsion@xcite . for this metric",
    "there are two horizons : the outer one @xmath19 and the inner one @xmath20 . from @xmath21",
    ", one can obtain the expressions of both horizons : [ horizon ] r^2_=(1 ) , = [ 1-(j_0/m_0l)^2]^1/2 conversely , @xmath22 and @xmath23 can be expressed as follows : m_0= , j_0=.    hawking radiation is just a kinematic effect , which only depends on the event horizon and is irrelevant to the dynamical equations and the gravitational theories .",
    "therefore the temperature of btz black hole in the mb model has the similar form as in gr , which is [ temp ] t= certainly because of the existence of @xmath24 , the temperature is relevant to the coefficients @xmath25 of mb lagrangian . define _ h=-|_r_+= which can be regarded as the angular velocity of btz black hole .",
    "because of the existence of the topological terms , the asymptotically behavior is different from the one for einstein - cartan theory .",
    "blagojevic et.al have proved that the gravitational conserved charges in the mb model should be@xcite [ mj ] m = m_0 + 2_3(-)=a m_0-j_0 ,",
    "j = j_0 + 2_3(-m_0)=a j_0-b m_0 where we have defined @xmath26 .",
    "obviously when @xmath27 they will return to their conventional interpretation as energy and angular momentum , as with the btz metric in general relativity .",
    "correspondingly the entropy can be derived [ entropy ] s=4r_++4 ^ 2_3(pr_+-)=4(a r_+-r_- ) it differs from the bekenstein - hawking result by an additional term and will coincides with solodukhin s result if @xmath28@xcite .",
    "black hole entropy is not always equated with one quarter of the event horizon area .",
    "in fact it is related to the gravitational theory under consideration .",
    "it can be easily verified that in the mb model the entropy , temperature , and the conserved charges not only satisfy the first law of thermodynamics dm = tds+_h dj but also fulfill the smarr - like",
    "formula m = ts+_hj this further implicates that with torsion the btz black hole can still be treated as a thermodynamic system and the thermodynamic laws still hold .",
    "it should be noted that in the expression of the entropy of the btz black hole no torsion exists explicitly , only @xmath29 in @xmath30 implicitly .",
    "in particular , when @xmath27 the entropy in eq.([entropy ] ) returns to the usual btz black hole entropy .",
    "it means that the n - y term @xmath31 influences the conserved charges and the exact form of entropy only when the cs term exists .",
    "ehrenfest had ever attempted to classify the phase transitions .",
    "phase transitions connected with an entropy discontinuity are called discontinuous or first order phase transitions , and phase transitions where the entropy is continuous are called continuous or second / higher order phase transitions . more precisely , for the first - order phase transition the gibbs free energy @xmath32 should be continuous and its first derivative with respect to the external fields : s=-.|_(p , ... ) , v=.|_(t , ... ) are discontinuous at the phase transition points .    for",
    "the second - order phase transition the gibbs free energy @xmath32 and its first derivative are both continuous , but the second derivative of @xmath33 will diverge at the phase transition points like the specific heat @xmath34 , the compressibility @xmath35 , the expansion coefficient @xmath36 : c_p = t.|_p =- t.|_p , = -.|_t=-.|_t , = - .",
    "|_p=- in this sense , because the heat capacity is always positive , there is no second order phase transition for btz black hole obtained in gr . this property of btz black hole",
    "can also be verified by the method of thermodynamic curvature@xcite .    to utilize ehrenfest s classification ,",
    "we consider variable cosmological constant and relate it to the pressure@xcite .",
    "the first law of thermodynamics for the btzt black hole should be [ flcosm ] dm = tds+dj+v dp where @xmath37 , and @xmath38 is the corresponding thermodynamic volume .",
    "therefore the mass of black hole is no more internal energy , but should be interpreted as the thermodynamic enthalpy , namely @xmath39@xcite .",
    "the first law of black hole thermodynamics represented by the internal energy @xmath40 reads [ flenergy ] du = tds+dj - pdv where @xmath41 .    for btzt black hole one can express mass @xmath9 as functions of @xmath42 , which are [ m ] h_=m_=one can substitute the expressions of @xmath43 into eq.([m ] ) to test and verify it directly",
    "this result can also be verified easily by differentiating the mass @xmath44 with the entropy @xmath45 to get the hawking temperature , eq.([temp ] ) .",
    "it should be noted that when @xmath9 is expressed with @xmath46 , its form is unique . when we express it with the thermodynamic quantities , two different forms @xmath44 appear .",
    "in fact @xmath44 depend on the relation between @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "they are established under different conditions :    * @xmath49 or @xmath50 , the expression @xmath51 is right . at this time , to keep the expression in square root have physical meaning , @xmath52 should also be satisfied . *",
    "@xmath53 or @xmath54 , the expression @xmath55 should be used .",
    "similarly , to keep the expression in square root have physical meaning , @xmath56 should be satisfied .    according to eqs.([mj]),([entropy]),when @xmath57",
    ", @xmath58 may be negative .",
    "in fact for gravities with higher derivative terms there is the possibility for negative entropy and energy which depend on the parameters of higher derivative terms@xcite .",
    "although black holes behave as thermodynamic systems , they also show some exotic behaviors , the most known one is the entropy of black holes is proportional to area and not the volume",
    ". therefore it is understandable if black holes exhibit some strange thermodynamic properties .",
    "below we will show that the condition @xmath57 is the key for the btzt black hole to have phase transition .    the temperature of btzt black hole can be evaluated according to @xmath59 : [ tem ] t_-(s , j , p)=.|_p , j t_+(s , j , p)=.|_p , j    they look different when expressed with the thermodynamic quantities @xmath59 because they correspond to different conditions for the parameters @xmath60 .",
    "when replacing the thermodynamic variables @xmath61 with the geometric ones @xmath62 , the two expressions can be unified and eq.([temp ] ) can turn up .    according to eqs.([m]),([tem ] ) , the specific heats at constant pressure and constant angular momentum can be calculated easily : c_-=.|_p , j = t_- , c_+=.|_p , j = t_+ with the geometric quantities , the heat capacity can be written as [ hc ] c_p = c_=    it is more appropriate to study the phase transition of the btzt black holes according to geometric quantities @xmath63 . because the conditions @xmath64 must be fulfilled .",
    "if employing the thermodynamic quantities completely , one may omits these conditions . below we will set @xmath65 and analyze the phase transition of the btzt black hole numerically . according to ehrenfest s classification , we should first derive the gibbs free energy @xmath33 : g = h - ts = m - ts      one can easily plot the @xmath67 curves as shown in fig.[gscn ] .",
    "obviously @xmath68 are all continuous function of temperature @xmath69 .",
    "no turning point and divergence turn up , which means no second - order phase transition happens in this case .",
    "this conclusion can also be supported by the method of thermodynamic curvature@xcite .     and @xmath70 .",
    "for @xmath71 no divergent point exists .",

    "the phase transition may happen only when @xmath74 are both positive or negative . under the given conditions one can easily derive the position of the divergent point , @xmath75 .",
    "obviously the phase transition is a smaller mass / larger mass black hole phase transition . when @xmath76 , the smaller black hole is stable because the heat capacity is positive , when @xmath77 , the other way around , the larger black hole is stable .",
    "one should further analyze the value of @xmath78 .",
    "we only consider the two cases which have the phase transitions . in fig.[mjs ] it is shown that under the condition @xmath72 when @xmath74 are both positive , the corrected mass @xmath9 and the entropy @xmath45 are positive at the divergent point @xmath79 , while @xmath80 is negative ; for the case with negative @xmath74 , the situation is just the opposite .",
    "thus we conclude that for the btzt black hole if the phase transition can happen , the @xmath81 can not be all positive .",
    "now we investigate the type of the phase transition for the btzt black hole according to ehrenfest s classification . to calculate the isothermal compressibility @xmath35 and the expansion coefficient @xmath36",
    "we should first obtain the thermodynamic volume .",

    "we can plot the curves of @xmath84 in fig.[gscp ] .",

    "the critical temperature lies at @xmath85 .",
    "as is shown in the figure , the gibbs free energy and the entropy are continuous functions of temperature . while the heat capacity , the isothermal compressibility and the expansion coefficient all diverge at the critical point .",

    "moreover we also considered the non - extended phase space . in this case , no direct thermodynamic analogy for the the isothermal compressibility exists .",
    "thus we employed another form and named it @xmath126 .",
    "it is shown that the @xmath126 also diverge at the same critical point . therefore in the non - extended phase space ,",

    "the critical exponents for the btzt black hole are also calculated , which are the same as the ones obtained in the hoava - lifshitz black hole and the born - infeld black hole .",
    "is this just a coincidence , or is there some inherent reason , still need consideration further .",
    "although we discussed the three - dimensional topological model with torsion , the results have included the torsion - free case which corresponds to the topologically massive gravity ( tmg)@xcite . for the tmg , the field equations of which are also solved by the btz metric ( cs - btz solution ) .",

    "<S> we study the phase transition and the critical behavior of the btz black hole with torsion obtained in @xmath0-dimensional poincar gauge theory . according to ehrenfest s classification , </S>",
    "<S> when the parameters in the theory are arranged properly the btz black hole with torsion may posses the second order phase transition which is also a smaller mass / larger mass black hole phase transition . nevertheless , the critical behavior is different from the one in the van der waals liquid / gas system . </S>",
    "<S> we also calculated the critical exponents of the relevant thermodynamic quantities , which are the same as the ones obtained in the hoava - lifshitz black hole and the born - infeld black hole . </S>"
