    "since the publication 10 years ago of a paper on the bulk magnetisation  of the heavy rare earth titanate pyrochlores  @xcite , significant progress has been made in the understanding of the magnetic properties of the various members of this family  @xcite .",
    "this progress is due to the utilisation of both advanced experimental techniques ( such as , for example , diffuse neutron scattering with polarisation analysis  @xcite ) and modern numerical and theoretical methods . despite often being perceived as simple and straightforward ,",
    "magnetisation  measurements capture nicely the physics of titanium pyrochlores .",
    "we revisit and extend the bulk magnetisation  studies of the spin - ice systems @xmath0  and @xmath1 , an @xmath2 antiferromagnet @xmath3 , and a heisenberg pyrochlore  @xmath5 , by performing the measurements ( _ i _ ) on high quality single crystals ( _ ii _ ) down to 0.5  k. the magnetisation  values , the rate of their change with applied field , and especially the anisotropy observed , all give real insights into the nature of the magnetic ground states and the field - induced transitions in the titanium pyrochlores .",
    "particular attention is paid to sample history dependence , as well as to the time dependence of the magnetisation , as unusually slow relaxation processes are discovered at low temperatures .",
    "given the nature of this special issue of _ journal of physics : condensed matter _ on geometrically frustrated magnetism an extensive general introduction to the pyrochlore  systems is omitted .",
    "instead , after a brief description of the experimental details , we proceed to the presentation of the results and compare them to previously published data where necessary .",
    "single crystals of the pyrochlore  magnets were grown by the floating zone technique , using an infrared image furnace  @xcite .",
    "small thin plates of a characteristic size @xmath8  mm@xmath9 ( typically containing the ( 110)-plane ) were cut from the original larger samples .",
    "the plates were mounted in such a way that the magnetic field was applied in the sample plane in order to minimize demagnetisation  effects  @xcite .",
    "the principal axes of the samples were determined using the x - ray diffraction laue technique ; the crystals were aligned to within an accuracy of 2@xmath10 . in this article",
    "we report the magnetisation  data for a field applied along the @xmath11 $ ] axis , which is an `` easy - axis '' direction for the spin - ice systems @xmath1  and @xmath0  and a  hard - axis \" direction for the @xmath2 antiferromagnet @xmath3 .",
    "magnetisation  measurements were made down to 0.5  k in applied magnetic fields of up to 7  t using a quantum design magnetic properties measurement system squid magnetometer along with an i - quantum @xmath9he insert .",
    "the magnetisation  was measured both as a function of temperature in a constant magnetic field and as a function of applied field at constant temperature .",
    "single crystal measured on warming for field cooled ( solid symbols ) and zero field cooled ( open symbols ) samples .",
    "each point is obtained by averaging three consecutive measurements , each of them typically taking 1 - 2 minutes .",
    "the inset emphasises a pronounced time dependence of the zfc susceptibility for @xmath12  k ( marked by arrows ) by showing raw data in a selected region .",
    "( b ) field dependence of the magnetisation  measured for increasing and decreasing magnetic field ( shown by solid and open symbols respectively ) .",
    "the @xmath13 curves obtained from the magnetisation curves at different temperatures show that temperature effects are most pronounced at both ends of a plateau . ]",
    "the temperature and field dependence of the magnetisation  of @xmath1  is shown in fig .",
    "below a temperature of approximately 0.65  k the magnetic susceptibility of @xmath1  is very sensitive to the sample history , as the @xmath14 curves for field cooled ( fc ) and zero field cooled ( zfc ) samples differ significantly , particularly for lower applied fields .",
    "below @xmath15  k , the zfc susceptibility shows a pronounced time dependence  it continues to grow with time even when the temperature remains constant .",
    "moreover , if the applied field is as weak as 50  oe , the susceptibility measured at @xmath16  k is initially negative .",
    "it grows rapidly with temperature and time and joins the fc susceptibility at @xmath17 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1]a ) . a natural explanation of the observed phenomenon is linked to the presence of a small , typically less than 5  oe , _ frozen _ field always present in a cryomagnet . therefore a zfc protocol is in fact a cooling in a very weak field of opposite polarity to the main applied field .",
    "it is still surprising to observe , at temperatures near 0.5  k , a process of magnetisation  reversal on a time scale of several minutes .    for @xmath1",
    ", we have previously reported magnetisation  curves for all three principal directions of an applied magnetic field at temperatures down to 1.6  k  @xcite .",
    "lowering the temperature to 0.5  k makes the plateau for @xmath18 $ ] much more pronounced ( see fig .  [",
    "fig1]b ) . comparing the results obtained for increasing and decreasing applied fields",
    ", one has to conclude that the magnetisation  process in higher fields is essentially hysteresis - free , while a significant hysteresis is evident in a field of less than 5  koe . as can been seen in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , the magnetisation  has a pronounced time dependence in weaker magnetic fields .",
    "for example , if the field applied to a zfc sample is rapidly raised to 2.5  koe and stabilised , the first measurement immediately after field stabilisation gives 2.02  @xmath19 per ho ion , while measurements 30 and 120 minutes later give 2.28 and 2.40  @xmath19 per ho ion respectively .",
    "technical limitations do not allow us to maintain a constant sample temperature ( @xmath20  k ) for more than 3 hours .",
    "however , it is very likely that after several hours , the measurements would return a value very close to the fc magnetisation  of 2.50  @xmath19 per ho ion .",
    "the magnetisation  shows no significant time dependence in fields of more than 5  koe or at temperatures above 0.65  k.    single crystals for a field applied along the @xmath11 $ ] direction at @xmath16  k. fc and zfc measurements are shown by solid and open symbols respectively .",
    "the change in the zfc signal at 2.5  koe over a period of nearly three hours is 20% , while the changes in the fc signal at 2.5  koe and the zfc signal at 10  koe are 0.8% and 0.07% respectively . ]     as well as of the @xmath13 curves for @xmath0 .",
    "each point is obtained by averaging three consecutive measurements .",
    "the inset emphasises a pronounced time dependence of the magnetisation  for lower fields by showing raw data in a selected region . ]",
    "the low - temperature magnetisation  process in the spin - ice compound @xmath0  has been extensively studied previously . for @xmath18 $ ]",
    "there is an agreement between our data shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] and the data originally reported by sakakibara s group  @xcite . in common with what is observed for @xmath1 , the magnetisation  process in @xmath0",
    "also consists of four distinct regions : ( _ i _ ) a sharp rise in fields below 5  koe ; ( _ ii _ ) a plateau ( often labelled as the kagome ice state ) in intermediate fields , ( _ iii _ ) a further sharp rise in a field of 10.5  koe for @xmath0  and 19.0  koe for @xmath1 ; ( _ iv _ ) another plateau in higher fields .",
    "the second plateau , which is sometimes referred to as the saturation magnetisation , is associated with a state where the spin - ice rules are broken by the force of the applied field .",
    "hysteretic behaviour and pronounced time dependence of magnetisation  at lower temperatures are only seen in the first low field region ( see inset in fig .  [ fig3 ] ) .",
    "the time and history dependence is significant only at @xmath21  k , the same temperature as has been reported previously as a bifurcation point between the fc and zfc powder magnetisation  data  @xcite .",
    "according to the latest reports  @xcite , on lowering the temperature to @xmath22  k , pronounced non - equilibrium processes are observed , culminating in the appearance of sharp magnetisation  steps accompanied by similarly sharp peaks in the temperature of the sample .",
    "the low - temperature behaviour is ascribed to the field - driven motion of the magnetic monopole excitations  @xcite . in",
    "would be interesting to check if the observed time - dependence at intermediate - temperatures in both @xmath0  and @xmath1  could also be described in terms of monopole movement  @xcite .",
    "for a field applied along the @xmath11 $ ] direction .",
    "the @xmath14 curves shown in panel ( a ) have been measured on warming for zero field cooled samples . in panel ( b ) the results for fc and zfc samples obtained in weak applied fields are contrasted .",
    "panel ( d ) shows the @xmath13 curves around a critical field which is temperature dependent and amounts to @xmath23  koe at 0.5  k. ]    in @xmath3 , the ordering temperature of @xmath24  k is marked by a change of slope in the temperature dependence of the magnetic susceptibility ( see fig  [ fig4 ] ) .",
    "the anomaly moves to lower temperatures and becomes less pronounced in higher fields , disappearing completely above 15  koe in agreement with the heat capacity measurements  @xcite . for applied fields between 100  oe and 20  koe ,",
    "no appreciable history dependence has been seen . for the weaker applied fields , such as 10  oe and 50  oe , however , the fc and zfc susceptibility curves differ significantly ( see fig .  [ fig4]b ) .",
    "this difference is likely to be associated with the movement of magnetic domain walls in the sample .",
    "magnetisation  curves measured in @xmath3  at different temperatures are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig4]c alongside their derivatives in fig .",
    "[ fig4]d . after the initial , nearly linear growth in lower fields ,",
    "the magnetisation  starts to increase much more rapidly around a critical field @xmath25 , reaching a value of 3@xmath19 per er ion at 20  koe .",
    "then magnetisation  continues to increase but at an appreciably lower rate of 0.03@xmath19/koe per er ion .",
    "the high field part of the magnetisation  appears to be temperature independent , while the influence of temperature is evident around a transition field @xmath25 , which is itself temperature dependent and amounts to 13.5  koe at @xmath16  k if defined as the maximum in the @xmath26 curves .",
    "the value of the critical field is in perfect agreement with the heat capacity results  @xcite .",
    "both the diverging behaviour seen in the @xmath26 curves at @xmath25 and a considerable increase in the magnetisation  above @xmath25 are the further proof that at this field a critical phase transition takes place , most likely quantum in nature  @xcite , rather than a trivial magnetisation  saturation .",
    "although the magnetic properties of @xmath3  are highly anisotropic  @xcite , the magnetisation  curves for a field applied along @xmath27 $ ] and @xmath28 $ ] directions ( not shown in this article ) appear to demonstrate a field dependence that is functionally similar to the @xmath11 $ ] direction , with a diverging susceptibility around a critical field .",
    "this result is difficult to reconcile with the recent neutron diffraction measurements for a field applied along @xmath27 $ ]  @xcite , where it is claimed that the er moments have different magnitudes and are aligned along the field at @xmath25 , with their values reaching a minimum at this field .",
    "an alternative explanation is that this second - order transition takes place at a field above which the magnetisation  process is accompanied by a canting of the magnetic moments off their local `` easy - planes ''  @xcite .",
    "it remains to be seen whether an appropriate description of the magnetisation  process in @xmath3  can be achieved in a framework of a classical spin system ( perhaps by adding a strong easy - plane anisotropy to the exchange hamiltonian  @xcite ) or if a full quantum - mechanical treatment is required . despite the large overall magnetic moment on the er ions , a quantum influence can not be ruled out , as the single - ion crystal - field ground state of er@xmath29 in @xmath3  is a kramers doublet  @xcite with strongly different magnetic moments perpendicular and parallel to the local @xmath30 axis , which could be effectively described as an @xmath31 system .",
    "single crystal for @xmath18 $ ] .",
    "the arrows indicate two transition temperatures , @xmath6  k and @xmath7  k reported from the specific heat measurements in zero field @xcite .",
    "the @xmath13 curves obtained from the magnetisation curves at different temperatures have been offset by the specified values for clarity . ]",
    "figure  [ fig5]a shows the temperature dependence of the magnetic susceptibility of @xmath5  measured for different fields applied along the @xmath11 $ ] axis .",
    "the compound orders magnetically at @xmath6  k and undergoes a further transition at @xmath7  k  @xcite .",
    "both these transitions are clearly visible in the @xmath14 curves in low applied field , contrary to the previously published results  @xcite .",
    "remarkably , the susceptibility increases with increasing temperature for @xmath32 , while the tendency is opposite for @xmath33 and @xmath34 . in intermediate magnetic fields",
    "either one or two anomalies can be seen in the @xmath14 curves depending on which part of the @xmath35 phase diagram has been traversed  @xcite , while for magnetic fields above 60  koe no transition is visible .",
    "figure  [ fig5]b shows the field dependence of the magnetisation  of @xmath5  measured for @xmath18 $ ] above and below the ordering temperature . in the highest available field of 70  koe , at which point the magnetisation  is still growing at a considerable rate , a magnetic moment of 6.8@xmath19 per gd ion is reached , close to a maximum value of 7@xmath19 expected for a state with @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "if a saturation field is defined as the maximum in the @xmath26 curve ( see fig .",
    "[ fig5]c ) , then its value is 59  koe at @xmath16  k. apart from the saturation field , @xmath38 , another field - induced transition is evident at a field of @xmath39 , in agreement with the previously reported heat - capacity measurements  @xcite .",
    "the nature of this transition remains uncertain , as neither of the two proposed models ( a canting of the magnetic moments away from their local `` easy - planes ''  @xcite or a collinear 3 up 1 down structure  @xcite ) seem to fit all the experimental results .",
    "given that the zero field magnetic structure of @xmath5  is still a matter for debate  @xcite , it is not surprising that the a theoretical description of the magnetisation  process in this compound is still unavailable .",
    "in conclusion , we report magnetisation  measurements performed at temperatures down to 0.5  k for the highly frustrated pyrochlore  systems @xmath1 , @xmath0 , @xmath3  and @xmath5  for a field applied along the @xmath11 $ ] cubic axis . in each case",
    "unusual phenomena associated with field - induced phase transformations have been observed and commented upon . the use of high quality single crystal samples allowed for much more accurate and reliable data collection .",
    "the magnetometer used in this research was obtained , through the science city advanced materials project : creating and characterising next generation advanced materials project , with support from advantage west midlands ( awm ) and part funded by the european regional development fund ( erdf ) .",
