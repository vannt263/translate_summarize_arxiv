    "qcd hard scattering factorisation has been theoretically proven to hold in ddis @xcite and separates the partonic hard scattering cross section @xmath41 , for the interaction between the electron and a quark @xmath42 out of the proton , from a so - called diffractive parton density function ( dpdf ) @xmath43 , which describes the probability to find a quark inside the proton under the condition that the proton survives the interaction with kinematics described by @xmath17 and @xmath34 : @xmath44    proton vertex ( or regge ) factorisation , on the other hand , is only approximately satisfied .",
    "nevertheless , it can be used successfully in the parametrisation of the ddis cross section .",

    "the fluxes themselves are obtained from a parameterisation inspired by regge theory where the @xmath17 dependence of the pomeron flux is governed by the parameter @xmath51 .",
    "a nlo qcd fit can be performed yielding values for @xmath51 , @xmath50 and a polynomial for the quark and gluon densities of the pomeron at a fixed starting scale @xmath52 . usually , the reggeon flux is fixed and its parton density is taken to be equal to that of the pion .",

    "the quark distributions are found to be very stable in both fits , while the gluon distributions agree at low values of @xmath56 but vary at high @xmath56 .     at different scales",
    "two fits are obtained based on different parametrisations of the gluon density at the starting scale @xmath52.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    one way of confirming the validity of the above approach and to differentiate between fit @xmath53 and @xmath54 is to take the parton distributions as obtained from a fit to the inclusive ddis data and apply them to describe an exclusive channel such as ddis dijet production .",
    "this channel is expected to be particularly sensitive to the gluon content of the pomeron , also at high @xmath56 . as can be seen in fig .",

    "the resulting parton densities lie close to fit @xmath54 and are the most precise to date .",
    "although the dpdfs extracted from a fit to inclusive ddis data from hera can be used to predict other ddis channels such as dijet production , they fail to describe diffractive jet production in proton - proton scattering at the tevatron by a factor of order 10 .",
    "this is to be expected , as qcd factorisation in not supposed to hold in proton - proton diffraction : multi - pomeron exchanges , remnant interactions or screening may lead to additional particle production , thereby destroying the rapidity gap .",
    "these effects can be parametrised as a rapidity gap survival probability and a lot of theoretical and experimental effort now goes to the determination of this factor .",
    "one way to study the rapidity gap survival within one experiment is provided in electron - proton diffractive photoproduction of dijets .",
    "there one can compare interactions where the quasi - real photon interacts as a whole to interactions where the photon is resolved in a hadron - like structure so that only part of photon s momentum enters the dijet system .",
    "experimentally , both cases can be distinguished by reconstructing the variable @xmath59 : direct photon interactions will have a reconstructed value of @xmath59 close to 1 , while resolved photon interactions will have lower values for @xmath59 .",
    "one should note however that the separation between direct and resolved photon interactions in theoretical calculations is only possible at fixed order , as additional orders will move part of the direct photon cross section at lower order to the resolved photon cross section .",
    "both the h1 and zeus collaborations have studied the rapidity gap survival probability by measuring the @xmath59 dependence of the cross section for diffractive dijet photoproduction @xcite .",
    "surprisingly , although both experiments do observe a suppresion of the measured cross section when compared to the theoretical prediction without survival factor , neither experiment finds a strong dependence on @xmath59 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : survprob ] ) . as a result",
    ", no evidence has been found for any difference in survival probability for interactions mediated by resolved and direct photons .",
    "a difference in the observed survival factor between h1 and zeus has been traced back to different cutoffs in jet @xmath60 and a harder @xmath60 slope in data compared to nlo theory .     measured by h1 and zeus.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=28.0% ] measured by h1 and zeus.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=30.0% ]      the measurement of diffractive production of vector bosons in @xmath61 collisions provides another possibility to study rapidity gap survival .",
    "moreover , this process is also sensitive to the quark component of dpdfs .    using additional forward detectors available in the tevatron run - ii ( such as a miniplug calorimeter , beam shower counters and roman pot proton taggers ) , the cdf collaboration obtained a measurement of the ratio of diffractive to non - diffractive @xmath62 and @xmath63 production @xcite : @xmath64\\% \\\\ r^z ( 0.03 < \\xi < 0.10 , |t| < 1 { \\rm\\ gev}^2 ) = [ 0.85 \\pm 0.20 { \\rm\\ ( stat . ) } \\pm 0 .. 11 { \\rm\\ ( syst.)}]\\%\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] these results are in good agreement with previous run - i results of d0 and cdf obtained with the rapidity gap method .",
    "central exclusive production in @xmath61 collisions is a particularly interesting channel for the discovery or study of the higgs ( see below ) .",
    "theoretical calculations of this process however suffer from the large uncertainty that exists on the rapidity gap survival factor .",
    "it is therefore of utmost importance to establish central exclusive production of a variety of known final states , so that these can be used as `` standard candles '' in the search or study of higgs particles through the cep channel .",
    "the cdf collaboration searched for cep of dijets by looking for an excess in the distribution of the dijet mass fraction @xmath65 in dpe events @xcite .",

    ", a similar search was made for an excess of @xmath68-tagged jets .",

    ".      exclusive dilepton production , @xmath86 , through double photon exchange , is a nearly pure qed process and can therefore be used for luminosity monitoring with a precision of down to 4% .",

    "the cms collaboration prepares the measurement of exclusive dilepton production based on the detection of centrally produced @xmath87 or @xmath88 pairs @xcite .",
    "the main uncertainty in this analysis will be due to the inelastic background where one of the protons dissociates .",
