    "the next to minimal supersymmetric standard model ( nmssm )  @xcite provides a very elegant solution to the @xmath5 problem of the mssm via the introduction of a singlet superfield @xmath6 . for the simplest possible scale invariant form of the superpotential ,",
    "the scalar component of @xmath6 acquires naturally a vacuum expectation value of the order of the  breaking scale , giving rise to a value of @xmath5 of order the electroweak scale .",
    "hence the nmssm is the simplest supersymmetric extension of the standard model in which the fundamental lagrangian contains just  breaking terms but no other parameters of the order of the electroweak scale .    as in the mssm ,",
    "the phenomenology of the nmssm depends on a certain number of parameters ( mostly soft  breaking parameters ) that can not be predicted from an underlying theory at present .",
    "it is then useful to have computer codes that compute physically relevant quantities as higgs and sparticle masses , couplings , decay widths etc . as functions of the initial parameters in the lagrangian .",
    "such codes allow to investigate which regions in parameter space are in conflict with present constraints on physics beyond the standard model and , most importantly , which regions in parameter space can be tested in future experiments and/or astrophysical measurements .",
    "a review over corresponding publicly available computer codes can be found in  @xcite .",
    "most of these codes are limited to the mssm ; the only presently available code for the nmssm is  @xcite .",
    "many mechanisms for spontaneous  breaking ( such as supergravity with universal kinetic terms for all matter fields ) predict a simple pattern for the soft  breaking parameters at a large scale as the gut scale .",
    "then , the soft  breaking parameters are often universal , i.e. completely specified by universal gaugino masses , scalar masses squared and trilinear couplings . in the case of the mssm , the corresponding scenario is denoted as the cmssm ( or msugra since , in principle , other scenarios as gmsb or amsb could constrain the soft  breaking parameters ) .",
    "the advantage of such a scenario is , apart from its motivation through a simple underlying theory , obviously an enormous reduction of the number of unknown parameters .",
    "it would be desirable , if one could implement such simple boundary conditions also in the nmssm , which we will denote as the cnmssm .",
    "numerical studies of the sparticle and higgs spectrum in the cnmssm have been performed in  @xcite . since then",
    ", additional radiative corrections to the higgs spectrum have been computed  @xcite , and experimental constraints on the sparticle and notably the higgs spectrum have become considerably stronger  @xcite .",
    "also , the corresponding numerical codes have not been made publicly available .",
    "is a code that allows to chose parameters for the nmssm at the gut scale .",
    "exceptions are the singlet self coupling @xmath7 and the soft  breaking singlet mass @xmath1 ; as described below , these two parameters are determined in terms of others through the minimization equations of the higgs potential .",
    "possible scenarios such as gmsb or amsb are not ( yet ) implemented in . also , like ,  is at present limited to the simplest version of the nmssm ; neither terms linear in the singlet  @xcite , additional u(1 ) gauge symmetries  @xcite or combinations thereof  @xcite are considered .",
    "( see  @xcite for a review of such more general versions of the nmssm . )",
    "subsequently we limit ourselves to a scale invariant superpotential of the form w = s h_u h_d + s^3 +   , [ supot ] and the associated soft  breaking trilinear couplings @xmath8 , @xmath9 and higgs masses .    in principle numerical codes , that are designed to compute the particle and sparticle spectrum depending on the soft  breaking terms defined at the gut scale , could proceed as follows : starting with numerical values for all unknown parameters at @xmath0 , the rg equations can be integrated numerically down to the weak scale .",
    "then , the effective higgs potential can be minimized numerically , and from the higgs vevs at the minimum one obtains @xmath10 and @xmath11 ( where @xmath11 is used to determine a previously unspecified overall mass scale ) .",
    "this approach has been used for the nmssm in  @xcite .",
    "it has several disadvantages , however : first , the numerical minimization of the higgs potential is quite computer time consuming .",
    "second , since the overall mass scale and @xmath10 are determined only at the end , one finds that @xmath12 , higgs and sparticle masses often violate experimental bounds ",
    "it is not possible to input `` large '' soft terms ( and the correct value of @xmath13 ) from the start",
    ".    an advantage of this approach would be that it makes required ( fine tuned ) relations among the initial parameters immediately obvious .",
    "however , in view of its disadvantages , practically all present numerical codes ( within the mssm ) proceed differently : both @xmath11 and @xmath10 are used as inputs , and the two minimization equations of the higgs potential w.r.t .",
    "the two real higgs vevs @xmath14 and @xmath15 are used to compute @xmath5 and the soft @xmath16 parameter in terms of the others .",
    "( this leaves open the sign of @xmath5 ; subsequently the two possibilities have to be treated separately . )",
    "@xmath5 and @xmath16 have only a small effect on the rg evolution of the other parameters , only via threshold effects from particles whose masses depend on @xmath5 and/or @xmath16 .",
    "one can take care of this via a ( typically rapidly converging ) iterative procedure .",
    "( now , however , possible fine tunings originating notably from the requirement to chose @xmath16 very precisely , are hidden . )    at first sight , an application of this procedure to the nmssm is not obvious : both @xmath5 and @xmath16 are no longer independent parameters ( although effective @xmath17 dependent parameters @xmath18 , @xmath19 can still be defined ) , and one has to cope with three coupled minimization equations w.r.t .",
    "@xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath17 .",
    "a possible way out is the following : first , the tree level minimization equations w.r.t .",
    "@xmath14 and @xmath15 can be solved for @xmath20 and @xmath21 , as in the mssm , in terms of the other parameters ( incl . @xmath11 and @xmath10 ) . from @xmath20 and",
    "@xmath21 one can deduce ( for @xmath22 and @xmath8 given ) both @xmath17 and @xmath7 . finally , from the minimization equation w.r.t .",
    "@xmath17 , one can easily obtain the soft singlet mass @xmath1 in terms of all other parameters .",
    "this allows to chose as input parameters in the higgs sector of the nmssm the soft higgs doublet masses squared , @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath11 , @xmath10 and @xmath22 . from these the three parameters @xmath20 ( or @xmath17 ) , @xmath7 and @xmath1",
    "can be derived .",
    "the radiative corrections to the higgs potential ( that depend on all sparticle and higgs masses ) show a weak dependence on these parameters .",
    "they can be included in the minimization equations that become non - linear in the parameters to solve for , but one can solve them iteratively by a loop that converges rapidly .    the derived parameters @xmath7 and @xmath1 affect the rg evolution equations of some of the other parameters not only through threshold effects around @xmath23 , but through the @xmath24 functions ( already at one loop ) . however , the numerical impact is relatively small such that an iterative procedure converges quite rapidly again .",
    "( these iterative procedures are described in section  2 . )    clearly , once @xmath1 is an output rather than an input , it becomes difficult to find parameters such that @xmath1 at the gut scale assumes the same value as , e.g. , the higgs doublet ( or other scalar ) soft masses squared . on the other hand",
    "it is easy to imagine that a mecanism for the generation of soft  breaking terms treats the singlet differently from the other non - singlet matter multiplets .",
    "it happens frequently that the derived value of @xmath1 is negative even at the gut scale .",
    "this does not imply that the singlet vev takes values of the order of the gut scale , or that the scalar potential is unbounded from below : due to the term @xmath25 in the scalar potential , the singlet vev will always be of the order of @xmath26 ( hence of the order of @xmath23 ) , and it is still necessary to integrate the rg equations also for the couplings and masses involving the singlet down to the  scale and to compute further radiative corrections there .    once @xmath7 is an output rather than an input , it is difficult to study the `` peccei - quinn '' limit @xmath27 ( with @xmath22 finite ) in the nmssm  @xcite .",
    "however , this limit is quite unphysical at least in the simplest version of the nmssm considered here : once @xmath7 tends to zero , the singlet vev @xmath17 tends to infinity , and hence @xmath28 becomes unacceptably large : large @xmath20 implies a stable higgs doublet potential at the origin ( hence no electroweak symmetry breaking ) , unless at least one of the higgs doublet  breaking masses squared is of the same order and negative .",
    "hence @xmath27 would require @xmath29 .",
    "the limit where @xmath7 and @xmath22 tend to zero simultaneously and the nmssm turns into the mssm plus a decoupled singlet sector poses no problem , however : it is easy to see that , for given and fixed @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath8 , @xmath30 implies automatically @xmath31 .",
    "this limit is also stable under the rg flow from the gut scale down to the electroweak scale .",
    "although the vev @xmath17 tends towards infinity in this limit , the masses of all components of the singlet superfield remain of the order of @xmath23 ( i.e. of the order of @xmath9 , @xmath8 and @xmath20 ) .",
    "hence , in order to study the mssm limit of the nmssm within , it is enough to chose a tiny value for @xmath22 on input .",
    "( @xmath32 is not allowed , since expressions proportional to @xmath33 would become ill defined .",
    "also , @xmath9 still has to be chosen within a @xmath20 and @xmath8 dependent window in order to avoid negative masses squared for the cp even and/or the cp odd singlet scalars . )    unless modified by the user ,  allows to chose the following input parameters : @xmath10 and the sign of @xmath20 at the weak scale and @xmath22 at the  scale ; at the gut scale the free parameters are universal gaugino masses @xmath34 , universal scalar masses @xmath35 and universal trilinear couplings @xmath36 .",
    "exceptions are the following : + a ) the soft singlet mass at @xmath0 is an output , as described above ; + b ) the trilinear coupling @xmath9 can be chosen differently from the other trilinear couplings .",
    "the reason for this is twofold : first , if an underlying mecanism for the generation of the soft  breaking terms treats the singlet differently from the other matter fields ( as it is already assumed for @xmath1 ) , this will also affect the coupling @xmath9 which involves singlets only .",
    "( we left @xmath8 unified with the other trilinear couplings at @xmath0 ; this could easily be changed by the user , however . )",
    "also , interesting physics is associated with particular values of @xmath9 : in certain regions of the parameter space of the nmssm , the lightest neutral cp even doublet - like higgs boson ( the one ressembling to the sm higgs boson ) can decay into two lighter neutral cp odd ( sometimes also cp even ) higgs bosons  @xcite .",
    "this process allows for a doublet - like cp even higgs boson @xmath37 to escape lep constraints even for @xmath38 below @xmath39  gev .",
    "( the corresponding lep constraints have recently been updated in  @xcite , see the discussion in section 3 below .",
    "the allowed window has become somewhat tighter , but still exists . ) on the one hand , such scenarios can make the detection of a cp even higgs boson at the lhc quite difficult  @xcite .",
    "it has also been argued that the fine tuning , that is required in the mssm in order to lift the higgs mass above the lep bound , is relieved in the corresponding region of parameters in the nmssm  @xcite .",
    "this region of parameters in the nmssm requires , however , that @xmath9 assumes values within a certain range such that singlet - like higgs bosons are sufficiently light .",
    "the possibility to chose @xmath9 differently from the other trilinear couplings in  allows to study this range ( now in terms of @xmath9 defined at @xmath0 ) , and the physics associated with it .    in the next section 2",
    "we describe in detail , how the code  deals with the various input parameters in the nmssm . in section 3",
    "we discuss new features of some of the subroutines of  v3 ; most of the subroutines of  v3 are shared by . in section 4",
    "we present first results obtained with .",
    "the allowed parameter space ( passing all phenomenological tests ) divides into three regions : a mssm - like region with @xmath22 relatively small , and two nmssm specific regions with @xmath22 large either for small @xmath10 and @xmath38 above 114  gev , or for medium to large @xmath10 and @xmath38 below 114  gev , but @xmath9 within a certain window that renders the unconventional higgs decay modes discussed above possible .",
    "the width of the corresponding window ( and the fine tuning associated with it ) is discussed in some detail .",
    "as discussed in the introduction , the code  proceeds as follows : input parameters are the sm gauge couplings , fermion masses of the 3rd generation , @xmath10 , the sign of @xmath20 , and @xmath22 as well as the soft  breaking masses and trilinear couplings ( with the exception of @xmath1 ) at the gut scale .",
    "the code  proceeds as follows : first , a guess for @xmath7 , @xmath1 , @xmath20 and @xmath23 is made , and a preliminary calculation of @xmath0 and the gauge and yukawa couplings at the gut scale is performed through an integration of the ( two loop ) rg equations from the  scale up to @xmath0 using the subroutine rges .",
    "( @xmath0 is defined as the scale where @xmath40 and @xmath41 unify . )    then , an `` external '' loop starts , that involves both the gut scale and @xmath23 : the ( two loop ) rg equations for the soft terms , together with the gauge and yukawa couplings , are integrated from @xmath0 down to @xmath23 in the subroutine rgesinv .",
    "there an `` internal '' loop starts , that involves physics between @xmath23 and the weak scale :    in the subroutine runpar , first the mass @xmath42 of a potentially heavy higgs doublet is estimated ( which is required for the threshold effects below ) . the  scale ( denoted by @xmath43 ) is defined in terms of the squark masses of the first generations , and a scale qstsb is defined in terms of the left and right stop masses squared .",
    "then , the sm gauge and yukawa couplings are calculated at the scale qstsb ( together with the higgs wave function renormalization constants @xmath44 ) .",
    "threshold effects at higgs and sparticle masses are taken care of .",
    "finally , the nmssm specific yukawa and trilinear couplings are computed at qstsb .    in the next subroutine msferm , the ( @xmath20-dependend ) 3rd generation squark and slepton pole masses and mixing angles are computed at the scale qstsb .",
    "they are needed below for the radiative corrections to the minimization equations of the higgs potential .    in the following subroutine lowmuk ,",
    "first the rg equations for the soft higgs doublet masses squared are integrated from @xmath43 to qstsb .",
    "then , @xmath20 , @xmath7 and @xmath1 are determined from the minimization equations of the higgs potential including radiative corrections , that depend on previous estimates for @xmath20 and @xmath7 . a variable check verifies the relative change of @xmath20 and @xmath7 with respect to its previous values .",
    "finally , an improved value for @xmath42 is computed ( in case the internal loop stops here ; otherwise its previous estimate is used again ) .    unless check @xmath45 , the internal loop returns now to the subroutine runpar . there , the improved values for @xmath20 and @xmath7 are used for improved threshold corrections . in the next call of lowmuk ,",
    "the radiative corrections to the minimization equations also include the improved values of @xmath20 and @xmath7 .    if check @xmath45 , @xmath20 and @xmath7 have been determined to a sufficient accuracy .",
    "we have never observed a convergence problem related to the determination of @xmath20 and @xmath7 ; 5 inner loops are usually more than sufficient .    then , the `` external '' loop continues : next , the rg equations for the sm gauge and yukawa couplings are integrated again from the weak scale up to @xmath0 in the subroutine rges , using improved threshold effects at sparticle and higgs masses as well as the updated value for @xmath7 .",
    "the value for @xmath0 is improved simultaneously .",
    "next , the rg equations for the soft terms are integrated from @xmath23 up to @xmath0 in the subroutine rgesuni , using the new sm gauge and yukawa couplings and the new values for @xmath0 and @xmath1 . a variable gutest verifies , whether all soft terms coincide with the required boundary conditions at @xmath0 .    unless the relative deviation determined by gutest is less than @xmath46 ( for all soft  breaking parameters )",
    ", the external loop jumps back to a call of rgesinv .",
    "there , the new values for @xmath0 and the sm gauge and yukawa couplings are used in order to integrate again the rg equations for the soft terms ( with the required boundary conditions at @xmath0 ) down from the gut scale .",
    "if gutest is less than @xmath46 , the required values of the soft terms at @xmath0 are considered as sufficiently precise , and the external loop is left .",
    "the subsequent subroutines of  are shared with  v3 : higgs , gluino , chargino and neutralino masses are computed , and all higgs branching ratios into sm particles and sparticles are determined .",
    "then , present experimental constraints on higgs and sparticles masses and couplings are verified .",
    "warnings indicate at the end , whether such constraints are violated .",
    "a rough ( 1 loop ) computation of the @xmath47 branching ratio is performed ( for information only , without generating an error message ) , and it is verified whether the choice of parameters corresponds to a global minimum of the nmssm higgs potential .    finally , if desired ( if the flag omgflag is on ) , the dark matter relic density is computed using a nmssm version of the subroutines  @xcite .",
    "these subroutines are called internally in  v3 and ; an interface file , as it was the case for  v2  @xcite , is not needed anymore . the nmssm version of  is included in the downloadable package , and compiled together with  and , as described in the appendix .",
    "the different options ( a single point in parameter space , scans over regions in parameter space using grids or random numbers ) are also described in the appendix .",
    "the code  v3 performs the same tasks as the codes and v2 , that are described in detail in  @xcite .",
    "now , many subroutines are shared by , and the codes  v3 and  can be downloaded simultaneously ( see the appendix ) . apart from the architecture , some properties of some subroutines",
    "have been improved with respect to  v2 ; these changes are described below .",
    "the ( negative ) results of the four lep collaborations aleph , delphi , l3 and opal on higgs boson searches have been updated and combined by the lep higgs working group in  @xcite . as compared to the corresponding constraints already implemented in  v2 , the updates in  @xcite include improved constraints on higgs masses vs. couplings for the following processes :    @xmath48 where @xmath49 stands for a cp even or a cp odd neutral higgs boson .",
    "the considered decay channels of @xmath49 are @xmath50 and @xmath51 , and combinations thereof .",
    "@xmath52 where both @xmath49 and @xmath53 can denote a cp even or a cp odd neutral higgs boson .",
    "decays of both @xmath49 and @xmath53 into @xmath54 and @xmath55 are studied .",
    "only simultaneous decays of all three @xmath49 states either into @xmath57 or into @xmath58 have been considered .",
    "the corresponding data files are included in the directory expcon .",
    "they restrict the allowed parameter space of the nmssm more strongly than within the previous versions v1 and v2 of .",
    "in particular , the constraints on the decay of a sm - like higgs boson @xmath37 to @xmath59 , where @xmath60 is a cp odd ( singlet - like ) scalar , are much stronger . roughly speaking , the only remaining possibilities ( unless the @xmath61-@xmath61-@xmath37 coupling is heavily suppressed ) are :    86  gev @xmath62 106  gev and @xmath63 11  gev ( where the @xmath64 decay of @xmath60 is impossible , and no constraints from @xmath65 are available ) ,    106  gev @xmath62 114  gev with @xmath66 going up to @xmath67 .",
    "( it must be noted , however , that lep constraints are implemented only for individual processes .",
    "combinations of different processes can rule out points in parameter space , that seem to have passed the individual constraints . )",
    "the implicit definitions of the input parameters @xmath22 , @xmath7 , @xmath20 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 in  v3 differ slightly from the ones in  v2 : now these are all defined at a common susy scale @xmath43 ( essentially the average squark masses of the first two generations , unless @xmath43 is defined by the user ) , in the @xmath68 scheme as all other soft  breaking parameters .",
    "the numerical effect concerns essentially @xmath8 : in order to reproduce data points obtained with the previous versions of , @xmath8 has to be shifted by an @xmath69 dependend amount ( that can be estimated from the rg equation for @xmath8 ) .",
    "the calculation of the radiative corrections to the higgs masses has been reorganised and improved : now all parameters used by the corresponding subroutine mhiggs ( gauge and yukawa couplings , @xmath10 , trilinear couplings , quark and squark masses , @xmath20 and higgs vevs ) are defined at a scale qstsb , that corresponds to an average of the right and left stop quark masses .",
    "( qstsb is computed separately from the scale @xmath43 above , and can be lower . )",
    "corresponding formulas for the radiative corrections have essentially become simpler , except that contributions from gauge boson and light higgs boson loops have now to be added explicitly .",
    "( in the lla , which is used for the elektroweak corrections , contributions from particles with masses @xmath70 to masses of particles of the same order do not involve large logarithms .",
    "now , the results on heavy higgs masses are more reliable , without negative effects on the precision of the light higgs boson mass . )    inside the subroutine mhiggs , dominant gaugino loop contributions are now expressed in the form of a shift of @xmath8 , which also improves the precision of heavy higgs spectrum .",
    "new radiative corrections , that have not been considered before , are two loop contributions to the lightest higgs mass involving two powers of large logarithms and electroweak gauge couplings @xmath71 of the form @xmath72 , where @xmath73 denotes a potentially large logarithm .",
    "the dominant effect of these contributions depends on the chargino / neutralino spectrum , and is described in  @xcite .",
    "in the cmssm , the present experimental constraints on sparticle and higgs masses can be satisfied by chosing sufficiently large soft breaking terms at the gut scale , and @xmath10 not too small . as stated above ,",
    "the required fine tuning is hidden through the implicit determination of @xmath5 and @xmath16 .    in the cnmssm ( without unification of the soft singlet mass ,",
    "see above ) it is often necessary , in addition , to chose a non - universal value for @xmath9 in order obtain positive masses squared for both cp even and cp odd singlet scalars , even when they are essentially decoupled .",
    "otherwise , for @xmath74 , the allowed parameter space of the cnmssm corresponds essentially to the one of the cmssm ( except for the possibility to have @xmath38 below 114  gev and unconventional higgs decay modes , see below ) .",
    "larger values for @xmath22 are not always allowed within the cnmssm , however ; possible problems arise typically in the cp even higgs sector : on the one hand , non - vanishing @xmath22 increases the mass of the lightest higgs doublet , at tree level , by an amount m_h^2 = 2^2 m_z^2 ^2 2/(g_1 ^ 2+g_2 ^ 2 )  .",
    "this increase is relevant , however , only for small @xmath10 . on",
    "the other hand non - vanishing @xmath22 induces mixings between the doublet and the singlet states .",
    "since the singlet state is typically quite heavy , this mixing reduces the mass of the lightest eigenstate of the @xmath75 cp even mass matrix .",
    "this lightest eigenstate will then often violate bounds from lep  @xcite , in spite of its singlet component .    in order to maximize the mass of the lightest cp even mass eigenstate",
    ", this singlet - doublet mixing has to vanish ( as described in  @xcite ) , which implies a relation between @xmath20 , @xmath8 , @xmath22 , @xmath10 and @xmath7 .",
    "this relation is generally not satisfied within the cnmssm ; then  at least for larger values of @xmath10  this mixing effect disallows often large values of @xmath22 .    for given soft  breaking terms at the gut scale , one then obtains typically allowed `` islands '' in the plane @xmath22 vs. @xmath10 .",
    "an example is given in the figure 1 below , which shows such an allowed island for @xmath76  gev , @xmath77  gev , @xmath78  gev and @xmath79 ( with @xmath80  gev ) .",
    "the lightest ( doublet - like ) higgs mass is @xmath81  gev near both ends of this region , and up to @xmath82  gev near its center .",
    "all three yukawa couplings @xmath22 , @xmath7 and @xmath13 are relatively large , and the region is bounded  apart from lep constraints on @xmath38  by the condition on the absence of a landau singularity in the yukawa sector below @xmath0 .",
    "larger values of @xmath22 are also possible for larger values of @xmath10 .",
    "then , however , the lightest ( still doublet - like ) higgs mass falls below @xmath39  gev , and @xmath9 has to be chosen within a relatively narrow window in order to generate a light ( singlet - like ) cp odd scalar into which @xmath37 can decay  @xcite .",
    "such a line of allowed values for @xmath9 vs. @xmath22 is shown in figure 2 , for @xmath83 , @xmath76  gev and @xmath77  gev .    for @xmath84",

    ", @xmath38 decreases to @xmath86  gev for @xmath87 .",
    "larger values of @xmath22 , i.e. lower values of @xmath38 , are excluded by lep . across the line ,",
    "the mass of the singlet - like cp odd scalar goes up to @xmath67 for @xmath88 ( where @xmath89 106 gev ) , but @xmath90  gev for larger values of @xmath22 ( where @xmath91 106 gev ) ; a larger value for @xmath66 would imply that @xmath60 decays mainly into @xmath64 , which is excluded by lep .",
    "the width of the line , expressed in terms of @xmath9 , is @xmath92  gev for @xmath88 , but shrinks down to @xmath93  mev for larger values of @xmath22 .",
    "this allows to estimate the fine tuning in @xmath9 required for this region of the parameter space of the cnmssm .    in principle , the width of the line ( and hence the required relative fine tuning ) can depend on all other soft  breaking terms . in order to see this ,",
    "we have chosen smaller values for @xmath94  gev , @xmath95  gev , fixed @xmath96 ( still at @xmath83 ) , and plotted the allowed values for @xmath9 vs. @xmath36 in figure 3 .",

    "the width of the line , expressed in terms of @xmath9 , is now @xmath106  gev for @xmath100  gev , i.e. the relative fine tuning in @xmath9 is somewhat less than before .",
    "according to our preliminary analysis , this width can not be increased by chosing different values of @xmath10 .    on the other hand allowed regions in parameter space with @xmath107  gev remain present also for smaller values of @xmath108 ( at least down to @xmath109 ) .",
    "the present analysis of the allowed parameter space of the cnmssm is far from complete , but  will allow for more detailed studies in this direction in the future .",
    "in any case it is important to note that the region in the parameter space of the nmssm where the lightest sm - like higgs boson decays dominantly into two cp odd scalars remains present in the cnmssm ; we recall that it could then be quite challenging to detect just one higgs boson at the lhc  @xcite .",
