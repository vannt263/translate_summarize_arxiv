    "given a germ @xmath4 of a point of a complex analytic set , a choice of generators @xmath5 of its local ring gives an embedding of @xmath4 into @xmath6 .",
    "it then carries two induced metric space structures : the `` outer metric '' induced from distance in @xmath7 and the `` inner metric '' induced by arc - length of curves on @xmath8 . in the lipschitz category",
    "each of these metrics is independent of choice of embedding : different choices give metrics for which the identity map is a bi - lipschitz homeomorphism .",
    "these metric structures have so far seen much more study in real algebraic geometry than in the complex algebraic world .",
    "the inner metric , which is given by a riemannian metric off the singular set , is the one that interests us most here .",
    "it is determined by the outer metric , so germs that are distinguished by their inner metrics are certainly distinguished by their outer ones .",
    "it is easy to see that two complex curve germs with the same number of components are bi - lipschitz equivalent ( inner metric ) .",
    "so for curve germs bi - lipschitz geometry is equivalent to topology .",
    "this is even so for outer bi - lipschitz geometry of plane curves : two germs of algebraic curves in @xmath9 are bi - lipschitz homeomorphic for the outer metric if and only if they are topologically equivalent as embedded germs ( teissier  pham @xcite , fernandes @xcite )    we show here that for complex surface germs the picture is very different . our main result ( announced in @xcite )",
    "is that in the brianon - speder family @xcite @xmath10 of germs of algebraic complex surfaces in @xmath11 , which are of constant embedded topological type , @xmath12 and @xmath13 for @xmath3 are not bi - lipschitz homeomorphic , even for the inner metric .",
    "in particular , @xmath14-constancy does not imply bi - lipschitz equisingularity .",
    "the criterion we use is the existence of so - called _ separating sets_. a separating set of a complex surface germ @xmath4 is a  thin \" 3-dimensional subset @xmath15 through @xmath16 which separates @xmath8 into two  fat \" subsets ( precise definitions are below ) .",
    "the existence or non - existence of separating sets is a bi - lipschitz invariant , and it turns out that the existence of a separating set is a fairly common thing in the geometry of complex algebraic surfaces . for example",
    ", @xmath17-singularities were shown to have separating sets for @xmath18 and odd in @xcite ( theorem [ th : sep ] below is more general ) .",
