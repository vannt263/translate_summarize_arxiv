    "to summarize , motivated by the experimental observation of photons emitted by tunnel junctions carrying the energy larger than the bias voltage @xmath8 , we have developed a theoretical model to describe the electron - spp mode interaction based on the dynamical coulomb blockade theory .    in combination with the keldysh path integral formalism , by treating the gaussian and non - gaussian contributions separately",

    "the critical point at the bias voltage @xmath171 is strongly weakened , and the overbias peak becomes a mixture of the gaussian and non - gaussian noise .",
    "in addition , we also consider the interesting case when the bias voltage is far from the spp resonance ; here we set the resonance close to the two - electron energy limit , and we argue that this regime is suitable to distinguish the gaussian and non - gaussian contributions even at finite temperature and in the case of sharp resonance .",
