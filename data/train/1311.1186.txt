    "the study of ferromagnetic materials has long been a focus of research in condensed matter physics .",
    "the suppression of an itinerant ferromagnetic transition temperature to zero is of specific interest , since it may lead to the discovery of a quantum critical point ( qcp ) @xcite which exhibits exotic physical properties , such as non - fermi liquid behavior and even superconductivity . the stoner model has been developed to describe a mechanism of an itinerant ferromagnetic system , and is based on the premise that the magnetic properties of the itinerant ferromagnets originate from de - localized electrons @xcite . in particular these de - localized electrons become part of the conduction band and influence the density of state ( dos ) at the fermi level . based on the stoner criterion ,",
    "@xmath9 1 , where @xmath10 and @xmath11 are coulomb repulsion and the dos at the fermi level respectively , itinerant ferromagnetism can be suppressed by tuning @xmath10 and/or @xmath11 .",
    "the suppression of itinerant ferromagnetism not only results in the decrease of the ordering temperature , but is also accompanied by decrease of the effective and saturated moments per magnetic species . on the other hand ,",
    "ferromagnetic ordering can also arise from the interactions of local magnetic moments @xcite .",
    "as the exchange interaction favors parallel spin alignments , the materials show spontaneous magnetization . suppressing the ferromagnetism by diluting the local moments ,",
    "does not reduce the size of effective or saturated moments ( per moment bearing ion ) and , does not necessarily lead to a qcp @xcite .",
    "new magnetic states , such as spin glass , may also emerge in the diluted magnetic system @xcite .",
    "therefore , the suppression of ferromagnetism by substitution may offer an opportunity to approach a qcp , or may result a glassy state , and in doing so , sheds light onto the nature of the ordering mechanism of a specific ferromagnetic system .",
    "lacrsb@xmath0 has been reported to order ferromagnetically below @xmath12 125  142 k , with the differences arising from the sample preparation methods @xcite .",
    "lacrsb@xmath0 crystallizes in an orthorhombic structure ( space group @xmath13 ) , where cr occupies one single crystallographic site 4@xmath14 @xcite .",
    "extensive investigations into lacrsb@xmath0 have been undertaken , and the compound is found to have a rich magnetic phase diagram @xcite . lacrsb@xmath0 exhibits unconventional magnetic behavior with a canted ferromagnetism in @xmath15-plane .",
    "a spin - reorientation transition can be observed in the @xmath15-plane at @xmath16 95 k , and can be suppressed by a small applied magnetic field @xmath16 250 oe @xcite . whereas some studies claim lacrsb@xmath0 is an itinerant ferromagnet @xcite , the nature of its magnetic moments is still under debate .",
    "a neutron scattering study suggests a coexistence of localized and itinerant spins in lacrsb@xmath0 @xcite . as la",
    "is not moment - bearing , the cr ion plays the primary role in the magnetism of lacrsb@xmath0 .",
    "band structure calculations and the x - ray photoelectron spectroscopy studies find that the 3@xmath17 electrons of the cr exhibit a large dos peak at / near the fermi level in the paramagnetic state @xcite , which , based on the stoner criterion , has a possibility of inducing the ferromagnetic instability .",
    "an itinerant magnetic system can often be perturbed by applying pressure or via chemical substitution .",
    "take mnsi @xcite , uge@xmath18 @xcite and la(v@xmath1cr@xmath2)ge@xmath0 @xcite as examples ; in each , the ferromagnetic state disappears as pressure is applied .",
    "thus , pressure might be able to suppress the ferromagnetic phase and lead to a qcp or quantum phase transition ( qpt ) in lacrsb@xmath0 .",
    "also the dos can be changed by chemical substitutions for the cr atoms .",
    "lavsb@xmath0 , which is an isostructural compound to lacrsb@xmath0 , has no magnetic ordering down to 2 k @xcite .",
    "it is found that the fermi level in lavsb@xmath0 is shifted away from the highest peak of the dos @xcite .",
    "thus , the ferromagnetism in lacrsb@xmath0 may also be suppressed by substituting v for cr atom .",
    "previous work on polycrystalline samples showed that v substitution does suppress the ferromagnetic transitions , and claimed that the mechanism of the ferromagnetic ordering can not be explained by a simple localized magnetic moment model @xcite .",
    "only the temperature dependence of magnetization was measured on the v - doped polycrystalline samples .",
    "the nominal v substitution reached only up to 20@xmath19 , and the precise stoichiometry of this doped system was not analyzed experimentally .",
    "it is also not clear at which concentration the ferromagnetism was fully suppressed . in order to better understand the effects of v substitution on the magnetic state of this system , detailed measurements of the transport and thermodynamic properties of",

    "the system enters into a new magnetic ground state , possibly a complex glassy state . for even higher v - doped compounds , @xmath20 ,",
