    "molecular - base electronics attracts much attention due to the advantages over conventional semiconductors @xcite , e.g. , ease to engineer molecules , long spin - lattice relaxation time , and relatively less restrictive production conditions . in this sense , molecular - based electronics is a very promising way to tackle challenges obstructing the implementation of spintronics and quantum information processing ( qip ) . however , the manipulation of individual electron spin and controlling the interactions between electron spins in molecular species is difficult and crucial for the realization of spintronics and qip in the molecular level .",
    "time - resolved electron paramagnetic resonance ( tr - epr ) @xcite is a very useful tool for observing spin polarization and spin - spin interactions both for the molecules in the ground state and the excited state @xcite .    against the above background",
    ", the radical - triplet system ( rts ) @xcite which contains spin - bearing radicals and optical - active molecular species could be a prototype for molecular - based spintronics and qip . from the literature @xcite , rts could contain either two radical spins or two radical spins and one photo - active coupler , i.e. , single - radical - triplet system ( srts ) or double - radical - triplet system ( drts ) .",
    "however , more radicals or photo - active species could be synthesized .",
    "tr - epr is applied right after molecules are excited by laser shining from the ground state to the triplet excited state through inter - system crossing .",
    "the interactions between these spins and the spin polarization effect can be detected by tr - epr .",
    "compared with a large volume of experimental works on rts there is very rare theoretical work to explain the observed epr spectra from a point of view of the open quantum system , i.e. , considering the linear response of an open quantum system which interacts with the environment when it is perturbed by an external field , rather than a closed quantum system although there is some theoretical work based on a rather ambiguous theory @xcite .",
    "therefore , in this paper we will first present a generalized model [ sec:1 ] for the quantum open system in the limit of markov process , i.e. , the system forgets its history much faster than its evolution . following this general model",
    ", we will describe the time evolution of quantum states within rts .",
    "and then we will produce some numerical results of tr - epr simulations , and compare them with the experimental results .",
    "furthermore we will base on our theoretical model to make some predictions which is not present in experiments , especially the spin correlations between two @xmath0-spins . at the end",
    ", we will draw some conclusions and have some discussions .",
    "first let s start with a closed quantum system . supposing we have a closed quantum system described by @xmath1 and perturb this system by using an external field @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is a small factor , the linear response of the closed system due to a time - dependent perturbation is described by the well known kubo s formula @xcite , and the time - dependent and frequency - dependent response functions for an observable @xmath4 read @xmath5\\rangle \\\\\\chi_{\\hat{a}\\hat{b}}(\\omega)&=&\\int_{-\\infty}^{+\\infty}d\\tau\\phi_{\\hat{a}\\hat{b}}(\\tau)\\mathrm{exp}(i\\omega\\tau).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] however , for an open quantum system we may have to access to a coarse - grained description in which the coherent hamiltonian supplemented by incoherent terms representing the interaction with the environment . the most general description for the evolution of a quantum state of an open quantum system @xcite can be formulated by @xmath6+\\sum_\\mu [ \\hat{a}_\\mu\\hat{\\rho}\\hat{a}_\\mu^{\\dagger}-\\frac{1}{2}\\{\\rho,\\hat{a}_\\mu^{\\dagger}\\hat{a}_\\mu\\}]=\\hat{\\hat{\\mathcal{l}}}\\rho\\nonumber \\\\\\rho(t)&=&e^{\\hat{\\hat{\\mathcal{l}}}}\\rho(0),\\end{aligned}\\]][eqn : rhodynamics ] where the equation in the first line is so - called lindblad equation . here",
    "@xmath7 describes the quantum jumps due to the system - environment interactions and @xmath8 is the lindblad super operator . in order to derive formulae for the linear response of an open quantum system we should take some advantages of heisenberg representation and interaction representation .",
    "but before doing this , we can envisage that it is quite ambiguous to define the hermitian conjugate of a super operator if we want to use the interaction representation .",
    "therefore , first we define a scalar product of two operators by @xmath9,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath10 ensures the normal linearity conditions for a scalar product .",
    "this scalar product looks just like a vector scalar product on the extended vector representations of the operators @xmath4 and @xmath11 . with the help of this definition",
    ", we can now define a hermitian conjugate of a super operator by stating that @xmath8 should satisfy the following equations , @xmath12      with the definition stated in equation  [ eqn : spdefine ] the hermitian conjugate of a super operator corresponds to the ordinary matrix hermitian conjugate of the four - index matrix representation as follows @xmath13 in particular if we look at the expectation value of any hermitian operator @xmath14 with a time - independent liuvillian @xmath15\\nonumber \\\\\\nonumber&=&\\mathrm{tr}[\\hat{o}e^{\\hat{\\hat{\\mathcal{l}}}t}\\rho(0 ) ] \\\\\\nonumber&=&(\\hat{o}^\\dagger , e^{\\hat{\\hat{\\mathcal{l}}}t}\\rho(0 ) ) \\\\\\nonumber&=&(e^{\\hat{\\hat{\\mathcal{l}}}^\\dagger t}\\hat{o}^\\dagger,\\rho(0 ) ) \\\\&=&\\mathrm{tr}[\\hat{o}(t)\\rho(0)].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] therefore , @xmath16 we can also generalize these to the case where the liuvillian is time - dependent as follows @xmath17\\rho(0 ) \\\\\\hat{o}(t)&=&t\\mathrm{exp}[\\int_0^t\\hat{\\hat{\\mathcal{l}}}^\\dagger(s)ds]\\hat{o}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]      as shown in the following , we can see that starting from the interaction representation we are able to derive formulae for the linear response of an open quantum system systematically and easily .",
    "let s first decompose the liuvillian to two parts , i.e. , @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is small in some sense compared to @xmath20 . for the moment",
    "we suppose both of them are time - independent .",
    "then we can define an interaction - picture operator by @xmath21 and then we can derive the density operator in the interaction picture @xmath22&=&\\mathrm{tr}[\\hat{o}_i(t)\\rho_i(t)]\\nonumber \\\\\\nonumber&&=(\\hat{o},e^{\\hat{\\hat{\\mathcal{l}}}_0 t}\\rho_i(t ) ) \\\\&&=\\mathrm{tr}[\\hat{o}\\rho_i(t)].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] therefore we require @xmath23 the equation of motion for @xmath24 is now @xmath25      we first derive the formulae in the case where @xmath26 is a stationary state , i.e. , @xmath27 .",
    "supposing @xmath28 , where @xmath3 is the small parameter , @xmath29 is a general super operator , and @xmath30 is an arbitrary function of time .",
    "now we imagine the perturbation is turned on gradually from @xmath31 , and look for the change in the expectation value of an observable @xmath4 .",
    "we can evaluate this in the interaction representation @xmath32\\nonumber \\\\&=&\\lambda\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty}f(t-\\tau)\\phi_{ab}(\\tau)d\\tau \\\\\\phi_{ab}(\\tau)&=&\\theta(\\tau)\\mathrm{tr}[\\hat{a}_i(\\tau)\\mathcal{b}\\rho_0]=\\theta(\\tau)\\mathrm{tr}[\\mathcal{b}^\\dagger\\hat{a}_i(\\tau)\\rho_0].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] notice that if the perturbation @xmath33 is a hamiltonian , so @xmath34 $ ] and @xmath35=-\\hat{\\hat{\\mathcal{b}}}$ ] , then @xmath36\\rangle_0 $ ] , which is in agreement with kubo s formulae .",
    "now we can do the fourier transformation @xmath37 . by using the equation @xmath38 , where @xmath39 are the eigenvalues of @xmath20 and @xmath40 are the right and left eigenvectors of @xmath20 .",
    "after some algebra , finally we have @xmath41 \\\\\\nonumber&=&\\frac{i}{\\hbar}\\mathrm{tr}[\\hat{a}(\\mathcal{l}_0^\\dagger - i\\omega-\\epsilon)^{-1}\\hat{b}\\rho_0 \\\\&&-\\hat{b}\\hat{a}(\\mathcal{l}_0^\\dagger - i\\omega-\\epsilon)^{-1}\\rho_0]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]      if @xmath26 is not stationary of @xmath20 , we can still have the similar equation for the response function as follows @xmath42 \\\\&&\\theta(\\tau)\\mathrm{tr}[\\hat{a}\\mathcal{b}_i(-\\tau)\\rho_{0s}(t)],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath43 is the unperturbed density operator in the _ schrdinger picture _ to time @xmath44 .",
    "if we further assume that @xmath45 .",
    "after some algebra similar to that in the case for stationary initial density matrix , we can have the following frequency - dependent response function @xmath46,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which is in agreement with the equation in ref.@xcite .",
    "this is also the basis for our simulation of tr - epr spectra .",
    "in most of the tr - epr experiments we are interested in molecules are exposed to the environments , in general a liquid solution .",
    "the spin - lattice relaxation time is very long ( @xmath47 ) at room temperature for the radical spins .",
    "and the system - environment interaction is almost through spin - orbital couplings and phonon effect .",
    "the inter - system crossing is really fast for some molecules due to the combination of spin - orbital coupling and electrical coupling between singlet excited state and triplet state .",
    "however the above two mechanisms lead to very slow relaxation back to the ground state ; the life time of the phosphorescence is about @xmath48 even at room temperature because the electrical coupling and spin - orbital coupling is relatively small . in summary , markovian description which is appropriate for weak - coupling situations",
    "should be a good approximation for rts .",
    "so the main task is to build up the effective spin hamiltonian and quantum jumping operators , solve the resulting liuville equation , and evaluate the spectra according to equation  [ eqn : chinonstationary ] .",
    "however , before that we should also develop the formalism for the linear response of quantum open systems as tr - epr experiments involve both system - environment interaction and the linear response of open systems .      the effective spin hamiltonian for srts reads @xmath49 where the first is zeeman energy ; @xmath50 is the g - factor for the triplet and @xmath51 for radical , the second term is exchange interaction between radical and triplet ; @xmath52 is the exchange constant , and zero - field splitting @xmath53 and @xmath54 for triplet .",
    "@xmath55 is magnetic field .",
    "@xmath56 is the triplet spin , and @xmath57 is @xmath0-spin .",
    "similarly for drts the effective spin hamiltonian is @xmath58 where @xmath59 and @xmath59 refer to two radical spins .",
    "if we further include the laser field into the hamiltonian and adopt a rotating wave approximation ( rwa ) , the hamiltonian reads @xmath60{\\langlet|}+{|es\\rangle}[g_{r}\\mu_b\\textbf{b}\\cdot\\hat{\\textbf{s}}]{\\langlees|}\\nonumber \\\\&&+{|gs\\rangle}[g_{r}\\mu_b\\textbf{b}\\cdot\\hat{\\textbf{s}}]{\\langlegs|}\\nonumber \\\\&&+v({|es\\rangle}{\\langlegs|}+{|gs\\rangle}{\\langlees|})\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for single - radical - triplet system , and @xmath61{\\langlet|}+ { |es\\rangle}[g_{r}\\mu_b\\textbf{b}\\cdot(\\hat{\\textbf{s}}_1+\\hat{\\textbf{s}}_2)]{\\langlees|}\\nonumber \\\\&&+{|gs\\rangle}[g_{r}\\mu_b\\textbf{b}\\cdot(\\hat{\\textbf{s}}_1+\\hat{\\textbf{s}}_2)]{\\langlegs|}\\nonumber \\\\&&+v({|es\\rangle}{\\langlegs|}+{|gs\\rangle}{\\langlees|})\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for double - radical - triplet system . here",
    "@xmath62 , @xmath63 , and @xmath44 means the ground state , excited singlet state , and triplet state , respectively .",
    "@xmath64 is the electrical dipole matrix element due to the laser field within rwa , and we assume that the exchange interaction is negligible when the optical active molecule is in either ground or excited singlet state @xcite .",
