    "moreover the rabi frequencies associated to the opposite transitions are simply given by @xmath179 , where @xmath180 .",

    "this peculiar system is characterized by the presence of a single dirac cone at the center of the first brillouin zone and a flat energy band at half filling .",
    "in particular we focused on the modification of this exquisite energy spectrum in the presence of an external magnetic field and a next - nearest - neighbor spin - orbit interaction . in the former case",

    "the hall conductivity is quantized and each gap is characterized either by positive or negative values .",
    "importantly , we find that the energy gaps separating the two butterflies have a trivial topological nature as they are characterized by zero hall conductivity .",

    "we have shown the opening of two symmetric gaps around the flat band .",
    "these are characterized by a non - trivial z@xmath5 topological phase leading to the quantum spin hall effect .",
    "we have demonstrated the existence of helical edge states for an abstract cylindrical system , as well as for the more realistic finite lattice .",
    "we have further investigated the lieb lattice presenting a long wavelength approximation for the system hamiltonian around the single dirac cone .",
    "we have shown that the hamiltonian can be expressed in a relativistic form  similarly to the honeycomb lattice case  which is characterized by a set of pseudo - spin matrices of size @xmath209 .",
    "these matrices fulfill the commutation relation of an angular momentum and describe a spin-1 particle . within the same approximation we have demonstrated that the spin - orbit interaction simply results in a mass term within the quasirelativistic hamiltonian .",
    "furthermore , we have inspected the properties of the landau levels .",
    "in addition to the dispersion relation ruled by the square root of the landau level index  as in the case of the honeycomb lattice  we have shown that there are two competing landau levels at zero energy , which are related to the lattice topology and to the symmetry class of the hamiltonian operator .",
    "this system and its associated properties could be engineered using fermionic cold atoms placed in an optical lattice resembling the lieb lattice topology .",
