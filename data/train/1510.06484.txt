    "interest in the study of particle deposition mechanisms on heterogeneous substrates @xcite has been recently increasing , not only due to the critical role that particle - collector interactions play in current industrial applications @xcite , but also due to the relevance of these studies to the development of emerging sensing @xcite and separation @xcite technologies at the micro- and nano - scales .",
    "recent studies of particles flowing over collectors patterned with nanoscale patches , which are orders of magnitude smaller than the depositing particles , revealed that small amounts of randomly - distributed , attractive patches induce particle deposition onto net - repulsive surfaces @xcite .",
    "deposition rates for such systems are found to be larger than expected from a mean - field application of the classical dlvo theory @xcite .",
    "the discrepancies between empirical and predicted results are attributed to particle interactions with many patches , which create locally attractive regions (  hot spots \" ) @xcite on the collector as a result of their non - uniform distribution .",
    "therefore , particle deposition on collectors patterned with nano - scale heterogeneity is found to be controlled not only by the total amount of attractive charge on the collector , but also , by the spacing between the particle - attracting patches . for surfaces densely covered by patches ( small patch - patch spacing ) , adhesion is rapid and transport - limited . for larger patch - patch spacing ,",
    "however , adhesion rates become slower and the amount of deposited particles also decreases @xcite .",
    "the dependence of the adhesion capability of the collector on the patch - patch spacing , is thus better characterized by the system s adhesion threshold .",
    "the adhesion threshold is usually defined as the critical fraction of collector surface area covered with heterogeneity below which particles do not adhere on the collector .",
    "alternatively , it can be defined as the critical patch - patch spacing above which silica particles do not deposit on the collector @xcite .    in theoretical and computational studies",

    "the displacements of free particles due to brownian motion , however , are often significant in time intervals characteristic of the imposed flow .",
    "brownian motion can enable particle deposition on both homogeneous and heterogeneous collecting surfaces , even in the presence of an energy barrier @xcite .",
    "while adhesive dynamic simulations @xcite showed that bond dissociation dynamics are not significantly influenced by brownian forces and recent studies on particle interactions with rough collectors @xcite also indicated that brownian motion effects are negligible , microchannel flow experiments of particle deposition @xcite suggest that , for low - energy barrier systems , brownian motion can indeed increase particles tendency to adhere on heterogeneous collectors .    brownian motion effects",

    "results obtained when brownian motion is neglected only yield trajectories that denote particle adhesion . for the case of a small particle interacting with a patchy collector ,",

    "the binding capability of the collector , therefore , appears to be governed not only by the total amount of attractive heterogeneity but also by the magnitude of the spatial variations in the flow direction .",
    "flowing particles can be translated due to brownian displacements into more attractive or more repulsive areas of the collector , and irrespectively of the total amount of heterogeneity that patterns the collector surface .",
    "it should be noted that these meaningful spatial variations observed in trajectories computed with brownian displacements could also explain the unexpected finding of particles flowing at large shear rates ( @xmath62sec@xmath0 ) that adhere on the collector after translating shorter distances than those traveled by particles flowing at smaller shear rates ( results not shown ) .",
