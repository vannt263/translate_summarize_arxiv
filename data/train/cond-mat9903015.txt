    "stm induced desorption of hydrogen(h ) from the monohydride si(100 ) surface offers the possibility of lithography with atomic resolution@xcite .",
    "investigations of the desorption mechanism@xcite have established the dependence of the desorption rate on the bias voltage , tunnel current and h isotope . at high positive biases , @xmath3 v , the experimental results are consistent with",
    "electron induced desorption due to direct excitation of the si - h bond by a single electron@xcite . at negative and low positive biases",
    "the desorption rates show power - law dependencies on the electron current@xcite consistent with a multi - electron process@xcite , and the measured desorption rates are in quantitative agreement with first - principle calculations@xcite .",
    "the desorption by multi - electron scattering is only possible because the h stretch frequency has a long lifetime .",
    "the long lifetime is a result of a vibrational quantum too low for coupling with electron - hole excitations , while well above the si phonon spectrum , and can thus only transfer energy to the substrate via a multi - phonon process . at room temperature experimental estimates of the lifetime due to this process",
    "are @xmath4 ns@xcite .",
    "however , a local excitation is not an eigenmode and will decay into a h surface phonon by a coherent process .",
    "this decay is several orders of magnitude faster than multi - phonon energy relaxation , and must therefore be included in the theoretical models .",
    "it has been proposed by persson and avouris@xcite that the vibrational stark shifts due to the electric field from the tip can localize vibrational modes below the tip .",
    "the localized modes may still transfer energy laterally by incoherent diffusion ( the frster mechanism ) but it was found that this decay channel is also reduced by the stark shifts .",
    "however , the work assumed that the electric field from the stm tip is localized on a single h atom below the tip , and this is not the case for realistic tip geometries .    in this work we present results for the vibrational properties of the si(100)-h(2@xmath01 ) surface in the presence of the electric field from a more realistic model for the stm tip",
    "the tip is described by sphere of radius , @xmath5   , with a protrusion of atomic dimensions , and we determine the electric field by solving the poisson s equation numerically . to obtain the effect on the h vibrations we set up a phonon hamiltonian with parameters obtained from a first principles calculation of the vibrational properties of the si(100)-h(2@xmath01 ) surface in an external electric field .",
    "we find that the electric field does give rise to a localized vibrational state below the tip ; however , its lifetime is very short ( 10 ps ) due to incoherent exciton motion .",
    "however , we find that the anharmonicity of the si - h bond potential reduces the lateral energy transfer of higher excited excitations(@xmath2 ) of the si - h bond .",
    "we present first principle calculations of the desorption rate taking this effect into account , and find that two phonon excitations play an important role in the desorption process .",
    "the organization of the paper is the following . in section",
    "[ sec : firstp0 ] we describe the first principles method which in section  [ sec : firstp ] is used to calculate the zero field atomic structure and si - h stretch frequencies of the si(100)-h(2@xmath01 ) surface .",
    "the electric field dependence of the frequencies is calculated in section  [ sec : field ] . in section  [ sec : stark ] we introduce a simple dipole - dipole interaction model for the si - h stretch phonon band , and uses it to find localized vibrational states in the presence of electric fields from different stm tip geometries . in section  [ sec : decay ]",
    "we calculate the lifetimes of the localized states due to incoherent lateral diffusion . in section  [ sec : des ] the lifetimes are used to model stm induced desorption .",
    "section  [ sec : sum ] summaries the results .",
    "in this section we calculate the vibrational frequencies and the dipole - dipole coupling matrix elements of the h vibrations on the si(100)-h(2@xmath01 ) surface . in subsection",
    "a we present calculations for the unperturbed si(100)-h(2@xmath01 ) surface , and the vibrational and structural shifts due to an external planar field are calculated in subsection  b.    the first principles calculations are based on density functional theory@xcite within the generalized gradient approximation ( gga)@xcite for the exchange - correlation energy . since we only consider filled shell systems , the calculations are all non - spin - polarized .",
    "ultra - soft pseudo potentials@xcite constructed from a scalar - relativistic all - electron calculation are used to describe h and silicon(si)@xcite .",
    "the wave functions are expanded in a plane - wave basis set with a kinetic - energy cutoff of 20 ry , and with this choice absolute energies are converged better than @xmath6 mry / atom .    with this approach",
    "we find a si lattice constant of 5.47(5.43@xcite)and bulk modulus of 0.89(0.97@xcite ) mbar ( parentheses show experimental values ) .",
    "for the h@xmath7 molecule we obtain a bond length of 0.754(0.741@xcite) , a binding energy ( including zero point motion ) of 4.22(4.52@xcite ) ev and a vibrational frequency of 4404(4399@xcite)@xmath8 .",
    "generally the comparison with experiment is excellent , and similar theoretical values have been found in other studies using the gga@xcite .",
    "to model the monohydride si(100 ) surface at zero field we use a ( 2@xmath01 ) slab with 12 si atoms and 6 h atoms .",
    "the atoms at the bottom surface are bulk like , and their dangling bonds are saturated with h atoms .",
    "the two surfaces are separated by a 7.5    vacuum region , and we use the dipole correction@xcite in order to describe the different workfunction of the two surfaces .",
    "the surface is insulating and we use 2 @xmath9-points in the irreducible part of the brillouin - zone ( bz ) for the bz integrations . test calculations with more dense meshes show that bz integration errors are negligible small .",
    "figure  1 shows the atomic structure after relaxation of the h atoms and the 4 upper si layers .",
    "positions of the h atoms and the two upper si layers compare well with other studies@xcite . for the third and fourth layer si atoms we find a small asymmetric relaxation , and to our knowledge",
    "such relaxations have not been included in previous studies .    to obtain the dynamical matrix of the si - h stretch frequency we make h displacements of @xmath10    in the si - h bond direction and",
    "fit a sixth order polynomial to the data points . since the si - h stretch frequencies are four times higher than si bulk frequencies , the si substrate acts like a solid wall , and we therefore use the h mass @xmath11 when calculating frequencies from the dynamical matrix .",
    "with this approach we have calculated the frequency of the symmetric stretch @xmath12 and the asymmetric stretch @xmath13 at three high symmetry points in the surface brillouin zone@xcite . in table  1",
    "the results are listed together with @xmath14 point frequencies(parenthesis ) obtained by infrared spectroscopy@xcite and the comparison between theory and experiment is excellent , especially we note that theory correctly predicts the splitting , @xmath15  @xmath8 .",

    "the data are accurately described by a morse potential @xmath19 and from a least - squares fit we obtain the frequency @xmath20 ev(@xmath21  @xmath22 ) , equilibrium bond length @xmath23   , and desorption barrier @xmath24 ev . the extrapolated desorption energy coincides with the surface energy without a h atom plus the energy of a spin - polarized h atom .",
    "the triangles in fig .",
    "2 show the total energy for large values of @xmath25 . when the interaction between the h atom and the surface becomes weak",
    "the electrons start to spin - polarize and the data points in fig .",

    "the inset shows the change in the surface dipole , @xmath27 as a function of @xmath18 ( the positive direction is from si to h ) .",
    "the surface dipole increases almost linearly with @xmath18 and the dynamic dipole moment is @xmath28 debye /   ( = 0.13 e ) .",
    "modelling the surface dipole by an effective charge @xmath29 on the h atom and its image charge -@xmath29@xcite , we find @xmath30 .",
    "the sign of this charge transfer from si to h is in accordance with a higher electronegativity of h relative to si@xcite .      to model the surface in a planar external field we use a ( 2@xmath01 ) slab with 24 si atoms , 2 h atoms , and a vacuum region of 10    and the external field",
    "is modelled using the method of ref .",
    "the si atoms at the back side of the slab are not passivated by h atoms , and dangling bonds on these atoms can donate free electrons and holes . in this way we take into account the effect of mobile carriers@xcite .",
    "other computational details are identical to those for the zero field calculation .    curves in fig .",
    "3 show the field dependence of the equilibrium si - h bond length @xmath18 , the @xmath14 point symmetric si - h stretch frequency @xmath12 and the @xmath14 point symmetric ",
    "asymmetric splitting @xmath31 .",
    "we first notice that all three quantities have an extremum at @xmath32 v /  .",
    "this behaviour can be described by a simple si - h tight - binding model with a field dependent h on - site element@xcite .",
    "the extrema occurs at the field where the h and si on - site levels are in resonance , since at resonance the si - h bond is strongest , and therefore the bond length minimal and the vibrational frequency maximal .",
    "furthermore , at resonance the h dynamic dipole vanishes , and therefore also the part of @xmath33 caused by h - h dipole interactions .    the three solid lines in fig .  3 show second order polynomials obtained by least squares fit to the data .",
    "the interpolated zero field values of @xmath34 and @xmath12 agrees exactly with those obtained in section  [ sec : firstp ] , while the interpolated @xmath33 zero field value is slightly off . taking into account the quite different slabs used for the two calculations we find the agreement fully satisfactory , and note that the difference can be taken as a measure of the accuracy of the approach .",
    "recently , the electric field dependent properties of the h / si(111)(1@xmath01 ) surface were calculated by akpati _",
    "et  al._@xcite , and they found stark shifts @xmath35 percent larger than in the present calculation , and the extremum in bond length and frequency appears for a field of 1  v /  .",
    "the agreement with the present calculation seems reasonable , bearing in mind that the stark shifts are for different crystallographic surface directions",
    ". however , part of the difference might be due to the use of a cluster geometry and the local spin density approximation in ref .",
    "the present study is based on a slab geometry and the gga .",
    "we expect that the thick slab geometry better describes the electric field induced polarization of the surface .",
    "in this section we will model the collective modes of the si - h stretch vibrations by a set of local oscillators interacting through dipole forces@xcite , and use this model to calculate the stark localization in the external electric field from a stm tip . in fig .  4",
    "is shown the lattice sites of the oscillators , corresponding to the positions of the h atoms in the ( 2@xmath01 ) cell .",

    ", we obtain @xmath49 mev and thereby @xmath50 @xmath8 .",
    "dipole - dipole interactions can therefore only account for half of the dispersion obtained in the the frozen phonon calculation .",
    "we suggest that the remainder of the splitting is due to a short - range electronic interaction .",
    "this electronic interaction gives rise to an additional splitting , and explains why @xmath51 at @xmath52  v / (see fig .",
    "3c ) even though the dipole - dipole interaction vanishes at this field .    to simplify the calculations we will in the following use the dipole - dipole interaction model(eq .  ( [ eq : hamil ] ) ) to describe all the interactions , and determine field dependent parameters @xmath53 and @xmath54 by relating the @xmath14-point eigenmodes of the model to the calculated frozen phonon values . in this way we approximate the effect of the short - range electronic interactions by long - range dipole forces . to test the accuracy of this approximation we have used the model to calculate @xmath12 and @xmath13 at the j and j point in the surface brillouin zone .",

    "<S> we report a first principles study of the structure and the vibrational properties of the si(100)-h(2@xmath01 ) surface in an electric field . </S>",
    "<S> the calculated vibrational parameters are used to model the vibrational modes in the presence of the electric field corresponding to a realistic stm tip - surface geometry . </S>",
    "<S> we find that local one - phonon excitations have short lifetimes ( 10 ps at room temperature ) due to incoherent lateral diffusion , while diffusion of local multi - phonon excitations are suppressed due to anharmonic frequency shifts and have much longer lifetimes ( 10 ns at room temperature ) . </S>",
    "<S> we calculate the implications for current induced desorption of h using a recently developed first principles model of electron inelastic scattering . </S>",
    "<S> the calculations show that inelastic scattering events with energy transfer @xmath1 , where @xmath2 , play an important role in the desorption process .    2 </S>"
