    "pairs of asteroids move about the sun on very similar orbits ( vokrouhlick & nesvorn 2008 ) , but , unlike binary asteroids , are gravitationally unbound .",
    "the orbits of paired asteroids are so similar that they can not be a mere coincidence ( vokrouhlick & nesvorn 2008 , 2009 , pravec & vokrouhlick 2009 ) . moreover , using backwards orbital integrations have shown that members of each pair were in the same location in space sometime within the past few million years .",
    "this suggests a common origin for the components of each pair .",
    "indeed , spectroscopic observations and broadband photometry studies have shown that members of observed pairs have similar spectra or colors ( moskovitz 2012 , duddy et al .",
    "2012 , 2013 ) .",
    "it was also found that asteroid pairs are not correlated to a specific type of composition or taxonomic class ( moskovitz 2012 ) .",
    "pair formation by collision has been rejected due to the low relative velocity between components at the time of their formation ( e.g. , vokrouhlick & nesvorn 2008 , 2009 , pravec & vokrouhlick 2009 ) .",
    "rather , this low velocity supports a model of a gentle separation of an unstable binary asteroid configuration .",
    "this is further supported by the distribution of the mass ratio between the members of each pair that is complementary to the distribution of gravitationally bound binary asteroids ( vokrouhlick & nesvorn 2008 ) .",
    "modeling suggests that pairs form by the fission of a fast - rotating aggregate - like asteroid ( with the so - called  rubble - pile \" structure ) into two objects ( e.g. , scheeres 2007 , 2009 , jacobson & scheeres 2011 ) .",
    "finally , photometric measurements ( pravec et al . 2010 ) showed that rotation periods of the larger members of asteroid pairs are correlated with the mass ratio in a way that matches the rotational - fission mechanism : ( i ) if the secondary ( the smaller member ) is massive enough , it carries a significant amount of angular momentum and the rotation rate of the primary ( the larger member ) will decelerate ; ( ii ) if the secondary is not massive , the primary will continue to rotate fast .",
    "furthermore , these measurements also confirmed that there is a limit to the secondary mass fraction at @xmath5 of the primary , as previously predicted by theoretical models .",
    "larger secondaries do not have sufficient energy to leave the primary ; thus they remain in its vicinity , forming binary asteroids ( pravec et al .",
    "2010 , scheeres 2007 ) .",
    "the main process to accelerate asteroids spins is the yarkovsky - okeefe - radzievsky - paddack effect , also known as the yorp effect ( rubincam 2000 , bottke et al .",
    "the yorp effect is a radiation torque imposed on a rotating body due to the asymmetric reflection and re - emission of sunlight .",
    "the relatively short evolution timescale of 1 to 10 myr for small - sized asteroids ( with diameter smaller than @xmath6 km ) , confirmed by direct detections ( e.g. , lowry et al . 2007 , taylor et al . 2007 , kaasalainen et al .",
    "2007 , urech et al . 2008 , 2012 ) , makes the yorp effect a very efficient mechanism to control the spins of asteroids among the near - earth asteroids ( neas ) and main - belt asteroids ( mbas ; e.g. , pravec et al .",
    "2008 , polishook & brosch 2009 ) . while the rotation of an asteroid can also be spun - up by sub - catastrophic impacts , the yorp effect seems to be a more robust and efficient process for small - sized asteroids ( marzari et al .",
    "2011 ) .    when the accelerated spin of the asteroid reaches the critical spin for a  rubble - pile \" object ( at about 2.2 hours per rotation ; richardson et al .",
    "1998 , pravec & harris , 2000 ) , the asteroid fissions ( margot et al .",
    "however , different scenarios of the rotational fission process have been proposed .",
    "for instance , walsh et al .",
    "( 2008 , 2012 ) present a model in which the fast rotation transports material towards the equator and gradually forms a near - equatorial ridge ( as evidenced , e.g. , by the diamond - shape of asteroid ( 66391 ) 1999 kw4 ; ostro et al .",
    "2007 , harris et al . 2009 ; and other objects ) .",
    "if continued , this process can eject part of the equatorial mass , where it can re - accumulate into a satellite .",
    "using this model , walsh et al .",
    "were able to theoretically produce satellites and diamond - shape objects as seen in nature by observations .",
    "however , it is unclear if the ejected material has enough time in orbit around the asteroid to be accumulated into a satellite .",
    "in addition , holsapple ( 2010 ) using granular theory finds that mass loss should not occur at the equator but rather the shape of the body would deform until interior failure occurs .",
    "furthermore , the elongated shapes of some asteroid pairs ( pravec et al .",
    "2010 ) do not match the diamond shapes resulted by walsh et al .",
    "alternatively , scheeres ( 2007 , 2009 ) describes a model of a coarser internal structure of the parent body that consists of a set of larger components .",
    "his model suggests that the rotational - fission mechanism can result in the loss of a significant part of the fast - rotating body so that the ejected component ( the secondary member ) will start its own course around the sun .",
    "jacobson & scheeres ( 2011 ) further developed this model and suggested that the secondary itself might disintegrate since it is under the pressure of the primary s tidal forces during the tens of days after its detachment and before it is lost in space .",
    "a fission of the secondary might form a third body that can crash into the primary , fall back on the secondary , or be lost to space . as the third body leaves the system it carries with it the excess of angular momentum , by that stabilizing the orbit of the secondary object around the primary , allowing them to become gravitationally bound as a binary asteroid .",
    "the model of walsh et al . and the model of scheeres and",
    "jacobson differs in duration over which the fission process takes place : the first is a gradual and slow process that can take one or more spin - up pulses induced by the yorp effect , stretching out over a long time interval ( hundreds of ky to mys ) .",
    "the fission by the second model is immediate , and a few days up to tens of days are needed before the ejected component is lost .",
    "this scenario is also more violent than the gradual model , since more energy is needed to remove a significant part of the asteroid , and this is probably followed with the removal of dust and debris that sink back on the main body and recoating it .",
    "further disintegration of the secondary , and possible impacts between the ejected components to the primary object , probably results with even more dust and debris .",
    "the recent observation of the main belt object p/2013 p5 that presented a dusty structure of multi - tails and a coma ( jewitt et al .",
    "2013 ) can be explained by a rotational - fission event of a fast rotating asteroid and the following fission of its secondary member , thus it supports the fast model .    while more diamond - shaped , fast - rotating asteroids have been found in recent years , supporting the walsh et al .",
    "model , the scheeres model helps to better explain the relatively large secondaries of asteroid pairs and the above mentioned strong correlation between the rotation period of the primary and the mass ratio of the two components . if the two models are valid , it is unknown what conditions will favor one mechanism over the other , and which is the more frequent scenario among asteroids .",
    "one way of probing the fission models is provided by spectral observations .",
    "this is because the extent of excavation and transportation of material following rotational - fission might be revealed on asteroids of the ordinary chondrite ( oc ) type ( part of the so - called s - complex in the jargon of asteroid taxonomy ) by identifying how much age - related alterations of their spectra are seen .",
    "if properly understood , such data might in principle help distinguish between the different rotational - fission models .      according to the previously mentioned models , the fission process takes its toll on the asteroid - boulders and rocks",
    "are shifted , regolith and dust are disturbed . during this  gardening \" process",
    ", sub - surface layers might have been excavated and exposed to space . in the case of oc asteroids ,",
    "the exposed material might have fresh spectral properties that were not modified by the  space weathering \" mechanism .",
    "this mechanism , caused by solar wind , cosmic rays and micrometeorite bombardment , alters the top layer on atmospheres - less planetary surfaces , causing them to display a  weathered \" , darker and redder reflectance spectrum ( e.g. , clark et al .",
    "brunetto et al .",
    "( 2006 ) found that an exponential curve best mimics the reddening effect of the space weathering mechanism :    @xmath7    where f is the fresh reflectance per wavelength @xmath8 , w is the weathered reflectance and the power - law @xmath9 is the extent of the space weathering . applying this empirical rule on a fresh meteoritic spectrum results in the increase of the spectral slope and decrease of the depth of the @xmath0 absorption band ( although it does not decrease the surface albedo ) .",
    "non - weathered oc minerals were brought to earth by the hayabusa spacecraft from the asteroid ( 25143 ) itokawa ( noguchi et al .",
    "2011 ) , even though the asteroid presents a weathered spectrum ( binzel et al . 2001 ) .",
    "this gave the ultimate observational support for the modifications of the top layer of asteroids by the space weathering mechanism and concluded a long debate in the community ( chapman 2004 ) .",
    "oc asteroids with non - weathered surfaces have been observed among neas and were dubbed as q - type asteroids ( e.g. , tholen 1984 , binzel et al .",
    "1996 ) , while sq - type asteroids are in an intermediate state ( demeo et al .",
    "a couple of q - types have been found by spectral observations in the visible range among the small members in the datura dynamical cluster ( e.g. , moth - diniz & nesvorn 2008 ) , a young family of asteroids formed by a collision @xmath10 kyr ago ( e.g. , nesvorn et al .",
    "2006 , vokrouhlick et al .",
    "2009 ) . using visible - wavelength broadband photometry rivkin et al .",
    "( 2011 ) found some asteroids with q - type colors among asteroids in the much older and larger koronis family that was also formed by a collision .",
    "thomas et al .",
    "( 2011 ) have found a trend in spectral slope for objects 1 - 5 km that shows the transition from q- to s - type among the koronis family as well .",
    "binzel et al .",
    "( 2010 ) and nesvorn et al .",
    "( 2010 ) suggested that tidal forces from the terrestrial planets could expose fresh areas when the asteroid has a close orbital intersection with the earth or venus and demeo et al .",
    "( 2014 ) pointed out the possibility this mechanism might be valid for mars .",
    "however , we do not know which mechanism of forming q - type asteroid surfaces is the most efficient , planetary encounters or collisions , and what is the role of rotational - fission in this context .",
    "all these studies have established a link between exposure of fresh material to violent processes ( such as collisions , planetary tidal forces , etc . ) , but some arrived at a different determination of the timescale of the space weathering mechanism ( see below ) .",
    "furthermore , it seems that different types of weathering mechanisms exist . for example , while the regolith on the moon becomes redder and darker with weathering , some asteroids , such as ( 243 ) ida ( that was studied by the space mission galileo ) , becomes only redder with no albedo modifications , and others , such as ( 433 ) eros , becomes only darker with no color alteration ( e.g. , gaffey 2010 ) .",
    "this suggests that different types of oc reacts differently to space weathering and one should not generalize all its dependencies and effects .",
    "current estimations of the timescale of space weathering differ dramatically from one another , and range between 50 ky ( e.g. , sasaki et al . 2001 ) to @xmath11 years ( e.g. , willman et al . 2010 ) .",
    "this wide range probably includes different stages of weathering , performed by different agents ( solar wind , micrometeorite bombardment , etc . ) .",
    "for example , vernazza et al . (",
    "2009 ) suggested that the solar wind is the origin of the rapid reddening of asteroid surfaces , compared to a slower effect caused by the micrometeorites . by measuring the spectral slopes of asteroids from young collisional families , vernazza et al .",
    "( 2009 ) suggested a maximal limitation of @xmath12 years for the faster space weathering timescale .",
    "nesvorn et al .",
    "( 2010 ) studied the orbital distributions of q - type neas and their close approaches to the terrestrial planets and found a minimal timescale of @xmath13 years .",
    "these values make the asteroid pairs relevant for measuring the space weathering timescale because their ages ( since the fission of their progenitors and the supposed exposure of fresh material ) range from a few times @xmath14 years to a few times @xmath15 years . in this study",
    "we observed a sample of 31 asteroids in pairs , measured their infrared spectra , chose those of the oc type , and analyzed their spectral parameters in order to reveal their history and to search for a possible link with the processes of space weathering and rotational - fission .",
    "we conducted a near infrared ( 0.8 to 2.5 @xmath16 ) spectroscopic campaign for a sample of 31 asteroids in pairs .",
    "the candidate pair asteroids were taken from pravec and vokrouhlick ( 2009 ) , vokrouhlick ( 2009 ) , roek et al .",
    "( 2011 ) and pravec ( private communication ) .",
    "most observations took place using spex , an imager and spectrograph mounted on the 3-m telescope of nasa s infrared telescope facility ( irtf ; rayner et al .",
    "additional measurements of two asteroids were obtained with the 6.5 m magellan / baade telescope of las campanas observatory using fire , an equivalent spectrograph ( simcoe et al .",
    "a long slit with a 0.8 arcsec width was used and the objects were shifted along it in a a - b - b - a sequence to allow the measurement of the background noise .",
    "observations were limited to low air mass values to reduce chromatic refraction that can change the spectral slope .",
    "the observational details are listed in table  [ tab : obscircum ] .",
    "the reduction of the raw spex images follows the procedures outlined in binzel et al .",
    "( 2010 ) and demeo et al .",
    "this includes flat field correction , sky subtraction , manual aperture selection , background and trace determination , removal of outliers , and a wavelength calibration using arc images .",
    "a telluric correction routine was used to model and remove telluric lines .",
    "each spectrum was divided by a standard solar analog to derive the relative reflectance of the asteroid ( stars are listed in table  [ tab : obscircum ] ) .",
    "eight asteroids that were observed multiple times were additionally divided by a second star , of a g2 to g5 type , that were observed circa the time and coordinates of the asteroid .",
    "this additional normalization was used to erase slope differences due to atmospheric instability .",
    "each normalized spectrum was then used to calculate the mean value of the reflectance .",
    "while the reflectance in the near - infrared regime is essential for taxonomic and mineralogical analysis , the reflectance at visible wavelength ( 0.4 to 0.9 @xmath16 ) is of no less importance . since the absorption band at one @xmath16 , which is the main classification feature for asteroids of the s - complex group , stretches from approximately 0.7 to 1.3 @xmath16",
    ", the knowledge of the band depth is lost if only the infrared regime is observed .",
    "while there are other band parameters that distinguish between s - type and q - type spectra ( such as the band center and width ; see below ) , the band depth is a very important parameter to determine their exact classification .    for 22 of the asteroid pairs",
    ", visible spectra were obtained from different sources :    _ i ) _ spectral measurements for five asteroids were obtained with magellan s 6.5 m clay telescope with the ldss3 instrument , the 3 m lick telescope , and the 2.5 m nordic optical telescope ( not ) .",

    "cousins / johnson bvri colors for three additional asteroids were observed with wise observatory s 0.46 m ( brosch et al . 2008 ) .",
    "reduction was done in a standard way ( details at polishook & brosch 2008 ) . to calibrate the photometry to a standard magnitude level we used landolt stars ( landolt 1992 ) or local reference stars that appear in the sdss catalog . for additional nine objects we used data published by moskovitz ( 2012 ) who measured cousins / johnson bvri colors and summarized sdss s ugriz measurements ( juri et al .",
    "we fit these values to the normalized reflectance scale by subtracting the solar brightness at a specific filter ( values in table  [ tab : solarmagcalib ] ) from the relevant magnitude of the asteroid and translate the results into flux units .",
    "the derived values were normalized by the value at 0.55 @xmath16 to give the normalized reflectance .",
    "_ iii ) _ the visible spectra of three asteroids were measured and published by duddy et al .",

    "the infrared spectra were stitched to the visible counterpart using the overlapping values between 0.8 to 0.95 @xmath16 .",
    "because unity is set to 0.55 @xmath16 , the infrared reflectance was scaled to match the visible part .    for six cases of oc spectra without visible reflectance we stitched two reflectance values of extreme cases : the visible reflectance of the s - type archetype , and the visible reflectance of the q - type archetype , both from demeo et al .",

    "a possible source of concern is the use of taxonomical archetypes for the visible section of the spectrum . to overcome this uncertainty we chose a conservative approach and used the two possible extremes of weathered and non - weathered .    in some of the cases , the uncertainty in the age estimation of the pairs",
    "this can also affect statistical interpretation of the results .",

    "vernazza et al .",
    "( 2009 ) have modeled the olivine ratio ( ol/[ol+opx ] ) of a sample of asteroids belonging to dynamically young asteroid families and showed a linear relation between the spectral slope and the olivine ratio , where higher spectral slopes are correlated with higher olivine ratio . following this , we chose from our sample of asteroid pairs only those that are rich with olivine , assuming that only the spectral slopes of these asteroids have any meaning in the space - weathering context",
    ".    the amount of olivine on the asteroid surface can be determined by the band center : the band center of olivine around  1 @xmath16 is shifted to higher values compared to those of orthopyroxene ( e.g. , gaffey et al . 1993 ; dunn et al .",
    "2013 ; sanchez et al .",
    "therefore , we used the band center after removing the continuum ( i.e. , after de - weathering ) as a representative of the olivine ratio .",

    "moreover , the pairs with relatively small band center values ( 1741 , 4905 , 42946 , 17198 , 88604 , 101703 ) , that are supposedly less affected by space weathering , present a wide range of spectral slopes , of weathered and fresh surfaces alike .",
    "therefore , we reject the notion that differences in the amount of olivine on the pairs of our sample explain why their spectral slopes do not correlate with their ages .",
    "since different types of weathering mechanisms exist ( such as the case of ( 433 ) eros , that presents darker craters with no color alteration ; gaffey 2010 ) one might argue that the weathered pairs are not really weathered rather their spectral parameters reflect other parameters ( e.g. , grain size ) .",
    "such a notion might not hold considering the differences in spectral slopes between primaries and their secondaries in our sample . since a primary and a secondary",
    "are most likely have the same composition then if the primaries do not react to `` color - changing '' space weathering effects than their secondaries should not react to it as well and should have the same slopes .",
    "since one of the agents of space weathering are solar wind particles the heliocentric distance might be another factor relevant for the spectral slopes of the pairs .",
    "however , the range of the semi major axis of the observed pairs is limited to the main - belt between 2.1 to 2.9 au with no correlation to the spectral slopes .",
    "another possibility is that the timescale of space weathering is significantly shorter than the ages of the pairs .",
    "however , since our sample does not present only high spectral slopes we can not state that all of these pairs are weathered , indicating a fast space weathering",
    ". the pair 6070 - 54827 is very young , most probably separated from each other @xmath114 thousands years ago and indeed the secondary 54827 has a very low slope ( @xmath115 per @xmath16 ) that matches those found on meteorites and neas ( we deal with 6070 later on ) .",
    "this puts a lower limit of a few times @xmath14 years on the time space weathering starts being effective .",
    "this limit is within the lower limit of @xmath13 years that was suggested by nesvorn et al .",
    "( 2010 ) as the time a fresh asteroid will maintain its non - weathered appearance , thus our observation timescale resides within their conclusion .",
    "on top of that , pairs with q - type - like , relatively fresh slopes ( @xmath3 per @xmath16 ) have a wide range of ages within the entire checked period ( of 2 million years ) .",
    "finding objects that retain their fresh surfaces during this time range provides an indication that space weathering can be as  slow \" as 2 million years for the time it takes an asteroid to present a weathered surface , with slope higher than @xmath112 per @xmath16 , as seen on s - type mbas .",
    "therefore , an extremely fast weathering process is not the source of the weathered pairs in our sample .",
    "a fourth scenario deals with a possible  saturation \" of the weathered asteroid , meaning that the sub - surface material of the asteroid is also weathered - exposing it will not present any signature of fresh spectrum .",
    "if asteroid pairs are subjected to many rotational - fission events during their lifetime , we can assume that each event was followed by a  gardening \" process that lifted dust from the surface that later re - accumulated back on the primary asteroid .",
    "after each event the surface becomes weathered until no fresh material can be found on the outside layers of the asteroid . when new fission occurs the raising and re - settling dust that follow it are already weathered , and no fresh material can be observed . however , since the secondary members are of order hundreds of meters to a few kilometers in size , it is hard to imagine that material so deep inside of the progenitor body was ever exposed to the agents of space weathering . laboratory measurements of grains from 25143 itokawa ( noguchi et al .",
    "2011 ) and of lunar samples ( summarized in clark et al .",
    "2002 ) show that the depth of the weathered layer is on the order of tens to hundreds nanometers ; forming this weathered coating on every grain in an approximate volume of a cubic kilometer seems unlikely .    since space weathering issues of timescale , saturation and relevant parameters",
    "can not explain the existence of weathered and fresh asteroid pairs , we now discuss the implications of this result on our understanding of the rotational - fission mechanism .",
    "we , of course , can not be sure that a rotational - fission event is necessarily followed by the exposure of fresh material on the surfaces of the pairs members .",
    "thus we discuss three alternative scenarios to explain the existence of weathered asteroid pairs : a gradual fission ; a mixture of weathered and fresh material ; and the lack of a secondary fission event .",
    "_ * gradual fission : * _ walsh et al .",
    "( 2008 ) suggested a gradual fission model where rocks and boulders on the surface of the fast - rotating asteroid are shifting and rolling towards the equator , forming an equatorial ridge , before being ejected . while in orbit they accumulate into a satellite that might escape to form an asteroid pair . since this mechanism is limited to the surface of the asteroid no deep sub - surface material",
    "is being exposed .",
    "the shifted rocks are relatively small ; therefore the extent of fresh material exposed might be small as well and the amount of released dust will be minimal .",
    "in addition , since the fission in this model is a long process , a fresh - exposed surface might become weathered before a consecutive fission event will expose another area of sub - surface material .",
    "asteroid pairs that were formed by the gradual model might not present fresh material at all .    _ * mixture : * _ in the model of a single detached secondary ( scheeres 2007 ) , as the progenitor split and fresh material is ejected and re - accumulates on the primary surface , its previous weathered coating is probably not covered completely by the accumulating fresh dust .",
    "therefore , the asteroid s surface could contain a mixture of fresh and weathered material that displays an intermediate spectrum between fresh and weathered spectrum .",
    "if the amount of resettled fresh dust is larger the reflectance spectrum will look fresher and vice versa .    _ * secondary fission : * _ jacobson & scheeres ( 2011 ) suggested that after the detachment of the secondary , it orbits the primary in an unstable orbit until it is lost and the system becomes an asteroid pair . during its short life as a satellite , the primary s tidal forces deform the secondary until it breaks apart by itself into two or more components .",
    "this secondary fission includes the exposure of additional fresh dust that re - settles on the primary and recoats it with fresh material .",
    "however , in a case of a ",
    "fast fission \" , the secondary will be lost before it breaks apart , and the amount of fresh dust will be decreased significantly .",
    "jacobson & scheeres ( 2011 ) found that the time elapsed after the detachment of the secondary until it completely leaves the vicinity of its primary has a normal distribution with extremes of few days to tens or a few hundreds of days ( see their figs . 7 and 8) . in this scenario , the pairs observed by our study to have high spectral slopes might have lost their secondaries quickly , avoiding the secondary fission phase , and thus maintained a higher percentage of their original weathered surfaces .    can any of these three scenarios be supported or rejected by our observations ?",
    "the _ * gradual model * _ of walsh et al . produces mostly spherical objects such as ( 66391 ) 1999 kw4 , known for its diamond shape ( ostro et al .",
    "2007 , harris et al . 2009 ) .",
    "these objects present little variation in their brightness while they spin , therefore , the amplitude of their lightcurve is small .",
    "asteroid pairs that disintegrate in a single , fast fission event could result in elongated or spherical objects alike , even though , elongated asteroids are more prone to break apart by rotational fission and are more probable to maintain some of their elongation after the fission as well ( pravec et al .",
    "therefore , these asteroids can present lightcurves with high amplitude .",
    "the amplitude values of 15 out of the 16 oc primary components in our sample were published ( polishook 2011 , polishook et al .",
    "2011 , polishook 2014 , pravec et al .",
    "2010 , slivan et al .",
    "2008 , warner et al .",
    "2009 , and pravec s web site : http://www.asu.cas.cz/@xmath116ppravec/ ) and are presented on table  [ tab : pairsparam ] .",
    "plotting the spectral slopes as a function of the amplitude of the pairs lightcurves ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fig15 ] ) shows that while four asteroids ( 2897 , 15107 , 17198 , 17288 ) have high spectral slopes and low amplitude , six other pairs ( 2110 , 4905 , 6070 , 42946 , 74096 , 101703 ) with high slopes have amplitude values that are much higher than expected for the diamond - shape asteroids form by walsh et al . model .",
    "the gradual model could not explain the primary pairs with low spectral slopes either .",
    "therefore , the gradual fission model discussed here might explain only a quarter of the observed pairs .",
    "mag ) . therefore",
    ", only four asteroids among the weathered primary pairs in our sample ( 2897 , 15107 , 17198 , 17288 ) can be explained by the gradual model , while the fast model can explain them all .",
    "[ fig : fig15],width=321 ]    _ * mixing * _ fresh and weathered dust may explain why the primaries in our sample present weathered spectral slopes compared to their fresh - looking secondaries . both 2110 and 6070 , have slopes of @xmath49 and @xmath69 , respectively , while their secondaries , 44612 and 54827 , present low spectral slopes of @xmath54 and @xmath72 , respectively . moreover ,",
    "this explains why the young ( @xmath117 years ) asteroid 6070 does not show a nearly zero slope .",
    "since the amount of re - accumulating fresh dust is a special case for each asteroid , some of the primaries might have reflectance spectra with higher spectral slopes than 6070 , or very low slopes such as 54827 .",
    "88604 - 60546 is such a pair where the two members have the same low slope within the uncertainty range .",
    "this suggests that the primary was covered by a significant amount of fresh material .",
    "the fact that the secondary of this pair is large ( d2 = 3.4 km , d2/d1 = 0.55 ) supports the notion that a significant amount of dust was released during the fission of this pair s progenitor .",
    "however , the other pairs in our sample ( 4905 , 6070 , 74096 , 92652 ) with high size ratio ( @xmath118 ) present high spectral slopes that are harder to explain with the mixing scenario ( fig .  [ fig : fig16 ] ) .     of the pairs should run through a secondary fission ; if low spectral slope is a marker for secondary fission , than @xmath119 of the pairs in our sample had their secondaries disintegrate , the same order of magnitude as predicted by jacobson & scheeres .",
    "jacobson & scheeres also predict that a secondary fission can result with the formation of a binary asteroid .",
    "indeed , two of the primaries with low d2/d1 values and low spectral slopes have known satellites ( 3749 and 8306 ; marked by ellipses ) , supporting the secondary fission model .",
    "[ fig : fig16],width=321 ]    alternatively , if the _ * secondary fission * _ is the significant source of the fresh dust , as suggested by the third model we examine , then smaller d2/d1 is the result of a  slow \" fission that continuously disrupts the secondary and releases higher amounts of fresh dust that re - coats the primary with material of lower spectral slope .",
    "this can explain the low spectral slopes seen on primary pairs with small d2/d1 ( such as 1741 , 3749 and 8306 ) , and the high spectral slopes seen on primary pairs with high d2/d1 ( such as 4905 , 6070 , 74096 , 92652 ) even though not all pairs follow this rule ( such as 88604 ) .",
    "it is interesting to note that according the model of jacobson & scheeres ( 2011 ) @xmath120 of pairs with low mass ratio ( @xmath121 , i.e. 15 out of 16 pairs in our sample , excluding 4905 ) will undergo a secondary fission .",
    "if indeed pairs that undergo a secondary fission are marked by a low spectral slope then @xmath119 of the pairs in our sample had their secondary disintegrated , very similar to the prediction of jacobson & scheeres .",
    "moreover , disrupted secondaries can form a second satellite around the primary and jacobson & scheeres describe how these systems could maintain one of the satellites when the other escapes , defining the system as a binary and a pair system . indeed , among the five primary pairs in our sample with low spectral slope , two pairs have known satellites - 3749 ( merline et al . 2002b , marchis et al . 2008 ) and 8306 ( polishook 2014 ; pravec private communication ) .",
    "furthermore , the primary of each asteroid has a low d2/d1 , suggesting that their secondaries were continuously fissioned .",
    "therefore , our observations provide the most support for the jacobson & scheeres ( 2011 ) _ * secondary fission * _ model .",
    "if the spectral slope of the primary member of the pair is a function of the amount of released fresh dust that resettled on the original weathered surface , and not of the age of the pair , then the timescale of space weathering can not be derived until the fission parameters ( sizes , shapes , etc . ) of both members is measured . however , a first - order fit could be derived by examining the secondaries only . consisting from sub - surface material of the progenitor body , these objects should have fresh surfaces with lower spectral slope and due to their smaller sizes these bodies do not attract additional dust as the primary members , hence they serve as  un - corrupted \" samples . unfortunately , our current sample includes only three secondaries , and only lower limits are known for two of them , therefore , our estimation of space weathering timescale is not well constrained . even though , as described above , within our sample we can define a minimal limit of 2 million years for the time an object with fresh surface will present high spectral slope that is typical for s - type asteroids . by focusing on the spectral parameters of secondary pairs , future studies might derive more generally the timescale of the space weathering mechanism .",
    "an asteroid pair consists of two unbound components which separated in the last @xmath122 myrs from a single  rubble - pile \" structured progenitor , that fails to remain bond against a fast rotation .",
    "models suggest that this rotational - fission process likely involves the exposure of material from below the progenitor surface - these materials may have never been exposed to the weathering conditions of space and therefore at least initially present non - weathered , fresh spectra .",
    "we have measured the near - infrared spectra of 31 asteroids in pairs , collected their visible spectra or broadband photometric colors , and analyzed them to derive their spectral slopes and band parameters .",
    "these values were used to estimate the weathering state of these asteroids .",
    "in addition , we used dynamical calculations to estimate the age of the pair , namely the time that passed since the fission of the progenitor .",
    "our measurements show that 19 of the pairs in our sample are s - complex ( oc , ordinary chondrites ) , 6 are c / x - complex , and 6 are v - type asteroids .",
    "the variety of taxonomic types shows that the composition of the asteroid is irrelevant for the rotational - fission mechanism that is effective for asteroids with a  rubble - pile \" structure .    in the four cases where we observed both the primary and the secondary members of a pair , both presented the spectra of the same taxonomy",
    "this is consistent with a common origin of components in each of these asteroid pairs .",
    "the two q - type asteroids in our sample ( 19289 and 54827 ) are the first of their kind to be observed in the main - belt of asteroids over the full visible and near - infrared spectral range .",
    "this solidly demonstrates that the q - type taxonomy is not limited to the nea population .",
    "eight pairs out of the nineteen observed oc asteroids present low spectral slopes of less than @xmath112 per @xmath16 , the maximal limit for the slope of meteorites and approximately the spectral slope of an average q - type .",
    "this supports the notion that the rotational - fission mechanism can be involved with the exposure of fresh , sub - surface material .",
    "there is no clear evidence for a correlation between the spectral parameters and the ages of the pairs .",
    "however , our sample includes `` old '' pairs ( @xmath123age@xmath124 years ) that present relatively low , q - type - like spectral slopes ( @xmath3 per @xmath16 ) .",
    "this illustrates for these asteroids a timescale of at least @xmath125 million years to develop high spectral slope that is typical for s - type asteroids .",
    "we describe three alternative scenarios of the rotational - fission mechanism that explain why 11 of the oc pairs in our sample present high slopes that indicate weathered surfaces :    _ 1 . _",
    "a gradual rotational - fission includes the ejection of rocks and boulders from the surface that re - accumulate into a secondary pair while in orbit around the primary . since most of the transportation of material is on the surface , and since this kind of fission can take @xmath12 years to conclude , there is no significant amount of fresh dust released .",
    "in addition , this model results with almost spherical asteroids , recognized by their low amplitude on their lightcurves .",
    "however , only four of the pairs in our sample with high slopes have low lightcurve amplitude , therefore , only a fraction of our sample could be explained by this model .",
    "a mixture between the ejected fresh dust and the original weathered surface presents a superposition of the two spectra depending on the ratio between the fresh and weathered material .",
    "this explains why the primaries in our sample have higher spectral slope than the secondaries .",
    "however , while it is expected that pairs with high d2/d1 present low spectral slope , most of the pairs in our sample do not follow this rule .",
    "_ a continuous fission of the secondary while it orbits the primary subsequent to the original fission ( jacobson & scheeres 2011 ) , releases even more fresh material compared to fast fission events where this phase is skipped .",
    "therefore , high size ratio d2/d1 probably means that the secondary did not disintegrate and less amount of fresh dust is released .",
    "indeed , most , though not all , of the pairs in our sample follow this rule .",
    "in addition , @xmath119 of the pairs in our sample have low spectral slope - this is similar to the prediction of jacobson & scheeres of @xmath126 of the pairs that run through a secondary fission .",
    "two out of the five pairs in our sample with low spectral slope have known satellites on top of being a pair , which further confirms the theoretical model of secondary fission .",
    "open questions remain and new questions arise on the physics of asteroid pairs :    * did all pairs form by the fast fission model , or were some formed by the gradual process ?",
    "why do some of the pairs evolve in one way and not the other ?",
    "what are the relevant parameters for the fission of the secondary object to take place ? what could this tell us about the internal structure of asteroids ?",
    "* if pair primaries with low spectral slopes are markers for a binary system , satellites should be searched for around them .",
    "a photometric survey to detect mutual events within the lightcurves of primary pairs could give solid support for the model of secondary fission and could inform the ratio of binary asteroids among asteroid pairs and vice versa .",
    "* what is the amount of fresh material needed to  paint \" a weathered surface so it will have low spectral slope ? by modeling specific systems of pairs we could better understand the physical context of fresh and weathered asteroidal surfaces . *",
    "if the secondary components in pairs are indeed excavated from sub - surface material of the progenitor body , could measuring their spectral slopes reveal the timescale of space weathering ? * if the immediate - splitting model is valid , young primary pairs might have hemispherical color asymmetries .",
    "the area of fresh separation might have a lower spectral slope compared to other areas on the asteroid .",
    "if the gradual model is more common , then the areas of exposed fresh material will be too small to detect , and no area with low spectral slope will be observed .",
    "therefore , a rotational resolved spectral study of young asteroid pairs might give additional support to either one of the formation models discussed above .",
    "we have started a campaign of rotational resolved spectroscopy of asteroid pairs and will present our results in a separate paper . * a question that can not be addressed by spectral observations alone is what is the frequency of asteroid pairs among the entire population of asteroids . though challenging ,",
    "answering this question will reveal the fraction of ` rubble pile ' asteroids and the way they are formed , evolve and break apart , making this question worth a study of its own .",
