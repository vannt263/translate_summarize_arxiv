    "quantum information processing ( qip ) has the potential to solve difficult problems in many - body quantum mechanics and mathematics that lack efficient algorithms on classical computers .",
    "however , achieving useful qip will require precise control of many qubits ( two - level quantum systems ) and the ability to execute quantum gates ( operations that manipulate the quantum states of the qubits ) with low error per gate . here , the error per gate ( epg ) is @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the ( average ) gate fidelity defined as the uniform average over pure input states of @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the ( typically mixed ) output state and @xmath6 is the intended output state ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) . a convincing demonstration of the potential for practical fault - tolerant qip should include verification of consistent epgs below a threshold of @xmath7  @xcite .",
    "so far , there has been substantial experimental progress on the basic techniques needed for qip , including the manipulation of small numbers of qubits and the implementation of the basic quantum gates that are needed to perform useful algorithms  @xcite .",
    "the main challenges for qip experiments that remain are to scale up to larger numbers of qubits and to decrease the epg below the fault - tolerant threshold .",
    "therefore , it is desirable to efficiently characterize or benchmark the performance of multi - qubit qip experiments so as to extract the epg of specific gates and enable comparison between different quantum computing platforms . with these goals in mind",
    ", we give a benchmarking protocol for arbitrary numbers of qubits and show the results from an experimental implementation for two qubits .",
    "the protocol builds on previous work that used randomized sequences of clifford gates to measure the epg of one - qubit gates , first implemented in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "compared to techniques such as process tomography  @xcite , randomized benchmarking offers several key advantages for characterizing epgs of quantum gates .",
    "for example ,",
    "while process tomography offers more complete information about the performance of a gate , it does not scale efficiently with the number of qubits in the system , it can not readily measure epgs below the error probabilities of state preparation and readout , and it does not verify performance of a gate in arbitrary computational contexts .",
    "in contrast , randomized benchmarking can determine epgs with a number of measurements that scales polynomially with the number of qubits  @xcite . because randomized benchmarking measures an exponential decay of fidelity as a function of the number of gates in the sequences , errors in state preparation and readout do not limit the minimum epg that one can measure .",
    "also , randomized benchmarking involves gates in the context of long sequences of operations and therefore establishes an epg that takes into consideration a computational context similar to that expected in the implementation of lengthy qip algorithms . because of these advantages , randomized benchmarking following the protocols of refs .",
    "@xcite has been used to measure one - qubit gate errors in a range of systems including trapped ions  @xcite , superconducting qubits  @xcite , liquid - state nmr  @xcite , and neutral atoms in an optical lattice  @xcite .",
    "recently , randomized benchmarking was used to measure an epg of @xmath8 for one - qubit operations with a trapped ion  @xcite .",
    "a number of previous works have described properties of two - qubit gates with various measurement techniques . with trapped ions ,",
    "the fidelity for creating a bell state has been measured at @xmath9  @xcite , @xmath10  @xcite , @xmath11  @xcite , @xmath12  @xcite and @xmath13  @xcite .",
    "process tomography was used to look at single and repeated applications of a two - qubit entangling gate  @xcite .",
    "the average fidelities were found to be @xmath14 for one and @xmath15 for two gates in ref .",
    "two - qubit gates have also been studied in other quantum computing platforms including superconducting and photonic qubits ( see ref .",
    "@xcite and citations therein ) , with measured fidelities ranging from @xmath16 to @xmath17 , disregarding photon loss for photonic qubits . in a liquid - state nmr system",
    ", a randomized benchmarking technique was used to study the errors of sequences of randomized gates on three nuclear spins  @xcite and found epgs of @xmath18 .",
    "the gates in this experiment were randomly chosen in a platform - dependent way from a special - purpose probability distribution where the probability of a two - qubit gate ( the cnot ) was @xmath19 .",
    "however , gate sets vary by platform , and other experiments may choose different probability distributions , for example to improve randomization .",
    "as a result the error probabilities from ref .",
    "@xcite may be difficult to compare to those obtained in future experiments .",
    "the multi - qubit protocol we describe first establishes a platform - independent error per operation ( epo )   for clifford unitaries by applying random sequences of clifford unitaries of varying lengths . here",
    ", a clifford unitary is any operator in the clifford group defined below .",
    "it then determines the epg of individual gates of our choice by inserting them into these sequences .",
    "the individual gates to be characterized may depend on the platform . of particular interest",
    "are implementations of one of the standard universal two - qubit gates such as the controlled - not ( cnot ) , phase gate or square - root of swap",
    ". the basic principles of the protocol are similar to the theoretical randomized clifford - based benchmarking sequences described and analyzed in ref .",
    "however , like the standard protocol used in one - qubit benchmarking experiments so far , the last gate of the sequence does not strictly reverse the effects of the previous ones , thus enabling the protocol to detect certain large errors that can otherwise masquerade as no errors .",
    "in addition , we discuss the practical aspects of choosing the random clifford unitaries in the sequence and extend the protocol to enable characterization of specific gates , thus enabling diagnostics that were previously unavailable in randomized benchmarking .",
    "the proposed protocol is flexible without affecting the ability to compare results from unrelated implementations .",
    "we note that the theoretical relationship between the protocol s epgs and epos and the detailed physical noise parameters is not known in general  @xcite .",
    "however , we suggest that subject to simple consistency checks , the protocol s reported epgs and epos are nevertheless useful quantities for comparison and reflect computationally relevant error behavior .    for our demonstration with trapped ions ,",
    "we take advantage of a multi - zone ion trap  @xcite .",
    "the universal two - qubit gate chosen here is a phase gate , @xmath20 , implemented via a mlmer - srensen gate  @xcite and acting as the diagonal matrix with diagonal @xmath21 $ ] in the basis labeled by @xmath22,@xmath23,@xmath24,@xmath25 , where @xmath26 and @xmath27 represent the two eigenstates of each qubit , with @xmath28 , etc .",
    "qubit addressing is implemented by separation of the ions into different wells , and long sequences of gates are supported by sympathetic cooling techniques as required for the approach to scalable ion - trap quantum computing described in refs .",
    "the experiment extends the technology demonstrated in  @xcite by using longer sequences of gates and a different implementation of the phase gate  @xcite to act directly on a magnetic - field - insensitive transition in @xmath29be@xmath30 .    from sequences of up to seven clifford unitaries , each requiring an average of @xmath31 phase gates , we deduced an epo of @xmath32 for the clifford unitaries and an epg of @xmath33 for the phase gates .",
    "although we implemented relatively long sequences , the experiment does not yet demonstrate stationary behavior because ion loss prevented routine implementation of longer sequences .",
    "there are also indications that the errors increased with sequence length by two to three standard deviations , with the epos ranging from @xmath34 to @xmath35 and the epgs from @xmath36 to @xmath37 as the sequences lengthened .",
    "our epo sets the first benchmark for random two - qubit clifford unitaries .",
    "the epg shows no improvement over the gates used in  @xcite , but applies to gates used in computationally relevant contexts in longer sequences .",
    "the paper is structured as follows : we first describe the protocol and its main features for two qubits .",
    "we then discuss the experimental implementation of the protocol and show the experimental results .",
    "the data - analysis methods are detailed next , followed by a discussion of necessary consistency checks and estimates of physical sources of error .",
    "we finally define the protocol for arbitrary numbers of qubits , and make recommendations for how to apply and compare it when qubit numbers vary .",
    "clifford unitaries are fundamental to most error - correcting procedures envisioned for quantum computing ( see , for example , ref .",
    "@xcite ) and thus serve as a foundation on which universal fault - tolerant quantum computing is built . as a result ,",
    "a large fraction of the fundamental processes in proposed quantum computing architectures involve clifford unitaries .",
    "the three main features of the group of clifford unitaries that make it useful for our purposes are that its members have compact representations that can be efficiently converted to circuits of elementary quantum gates , outcomes of standard measurements of sequences of clifford unitaries can be efficiently predicted by classical computation , and the group is sufficiently rich that error operators can be perfectly depolarized .",
    "these features are explained in context below .    for a system of @xmath38 qubits ,",
    "clifford unitaries can be constructed by combining one - qubit @xmath39 rotations , defined as @xmath40 with @xmath41 , about the @xmath42 and @xmath43 axes , and two - qubit cnot gates . alternatively , the clifford unitaries are the members of the clifford group , which is defined as the set of unitaries @xmath44 with the property that for every pauli operator @xmath45 , @xmath46 is a signed product of pauli operators .",
    "we consider two gates or unitaries that differ only by a global phase to be identical .",
    "the randomized benchmarking protocol is an extension of `` clifford twirling ''  @xcite . in the simplest instance of clifford twirling",
    ", an arbitrary quantum process @xmath47 is sandwiched between a random clifford unitary @xmath48 picked from a uniform distribution and its inverse @xmath49 .",
    "alternatively , we can think of clifford twirling as averaging the process @xmath50 over all elements @xmath51 in the set @xmath52 , of clifford unitaries .",
    "the key property of clifford twirling is that this new process behaves like one that uniformly depolarizes with some probability .",
    "in other words , a single parameter , the probability that a pure input state is mapped to an orthogonal state , characterizes the new , average process  @xcite .",
    "when @xmath47 is a noisy implementation of the identity gate , such as a long self - reversing sequence of gates , we use this parameter as the definition of the average error of @xmath47 .",
    "clifford twirling can be generalized to learn the average error of an arbitrary process @xmath47 intended to implement a specific clifford unitary @xmath44 : the inverting clifford unitary @xmath49 that is applied after the process is modified to an implementation of the unitary @xmath53 . with this modification ,",
    "the net effect is @xmath44 if there are no errors in @xmath47 . because clifford unitaries form a group",
    ", @xmath54 is also clifford .",
    "the implementation of @xmath54 should not rely on @xmath47 to provide @xmath44 , and it is better not to decompose it into a composition of three processes according to the given expression .",
    "this can be satisfied by first evaluating the unitary operator @xmath55 as an element of the clifford group and then implementing it by an efficient procedures for translating clifford unitaries into quantum circuits  @xcite .",
    "if @xmath47 contains errors , then the net process applies the unitary @xmath44 followed by a uniformly depolarizing error whose parameter defines the average error of @xmath47 .",
    "randomized benchmarking extends the idea of clifford twirling from the simple three - step sequence described above to randomized sequences of clifford unitaries with errors .",
    "these sequences consist of steps where each step implements a randomly - chosen clifford unitary and may have errors .",
    "each step in the sequence simultaneously acts as a process that undergoes twirling and contributes to the twirling of errors in the other steps . under optimistic assumptions",
    "described later , each step effectively behaves as an ideal unitary followed by a depolarizing process .",
    "the first goal is to establish the average error per step , which can then be reported as the epo for clifford unitaries .",
    "the method for implementing the clifford unitaries making up the steps in the randomized sequences is up to the experimenter .",
    "here we describe our approach . to improve stability of the twirling process and take advantage of the typically lower errors of one - qubit gates ,",
    "each step is composed of a clifford unitary preceded by a pauli unitary , where the two parts are chosen so that together they implement a uniformly random clifford unitary .",
    "the choice of pauli unitary on each qubit is random and independent from the choice of clifford unitary ; each pauli unitary involves applying either no pulse or a major - axis @xmath56-pulse .",
    "there are eight possible such pulses acting as @xmath57 , where @xmath58 is a pauli matrix or the identity : @xmath59 , @xmath60 .",
    "the sign in the exponent affects only the global phase and results in two choices for each possible matrix in the exponent .",
    "we keep the sign because in many cases including ours , the change in sign can involve a physically different device setting , such as the phase in a pulse generator that determines the orientation of the fields that mediate the pulse .",
    "each qubit s @xmath56 pulse is chosen uniformly at random from the above eight pulses .",
    "because of this pauli randomization procedure , it suffices to choose the unitary in the second part of the step uniformly at random from the clifford group modulo the group of pauli products . for this we can take advantage of the fact that the group of pauli products is a normal subgroup of the clifford group , and the quotient group ( of clifford unitaries modulo pauli products ) has a representation in terms of binary symplectic matrices @xmath61 of dimension @xmath62 such that @xmath63 modulo @xmath64 , where @xmath65 is a @xmath66 block matrix with @xmath67 blocks whose diagonal blocks are zero and whose off - diagonal blocks are the identity , see , for example ref",

    "the terminology is based on ref .",
    "@xcite . for two qubits ,",
    "there are @xmath68 such matrices @xmath61 .",
    "uniformly and randomly choosing from among these matrices is computationally straightforward and efficient .",
    "determining an implementation of the clifford unitary described by such a matrix in terms of the elementary gates available in a particular experiment is more challenging .",
    "there are efficient algorithms that translate an arbitrary symplectic binary matrix into order of @xmath69 elementary one- and two - qubit gates  @xcite , each of which can then be mapped into experimentally available operations . however , there is strong motivation to obtain shorter implementations , as this is a sure way to improve the measured epo .",
    "while it is unlikely that optimal implementations can be readily obtained for arbitrary numbers of qubits , we used the following strategy for two qubits optimized for our demonstration : by exhaustively listing compact circuits of one - qubit clifford gates and phase gates @xmath20 , we determined for each of the @xmath68 symplectic binary matrices a circuit with the minimum number of phase gates implementing the corresponding clifford unitary ( modulo a pauli product ) . on average , @xmath31 phase gates were required .",

    "the epo is determined by fitting an exponential decay to fidelities ( @xmath78 , where @xmath79 is the error probability ) measured for each sequence length .",
    "the choice of lengths therefore contributes to how well the epo can be extracted . in particular , there should be enough lengths for stable curve fitting , and lengths much greater than the inverse epo contribute little additional information .",
    "for each length @xmath80 , many sequences of @xmath80 random steps are produced . at the end of each such sequence , a randomized measurement step is added .",
    "this step consists of a pauli randomization followed by a clifford unitary that inverts the @xmath80 preceding clifford steps .",
    "the final clifford unitary is chosen independently of the pauli randomization .",
    "this ensures that in the absence of errors , the final state is again in the computational basis but randomized .",
    "which basis element it should be in can be computed by use of standard efficient methods for simulating sequences of clifford unitaries  @xcite .",
    "the sequence can then be experimentally implemented after preparation of each qubit in the @xmath81 eigenstate of @xmath82 and followed by a measurement in the @xmath82 basis of each qubit .",
    "one should implement sufficiently many runs of each sequence to have good signal - to - noise on the inferred probabilities of getting a correct or incorrect answer in the measurement for this particular sequence .",
    "the process of generating and implementing random sequences at each length is repeated in order to ensure randomization of the unitaries and their associated implementation errors .",

    "the experimental runs yield an average probability of error @xmath88 for each length @xmath80 , where the average is over the sequences of this length and their runs .",
    "to analyze @xmath88 we start by making the simple assumption that each step s error behaves as a completely depolarizing channel ( see , for example , ref .",
    "@xcite , pg .",
    "378 ) characterized by error probability @xmath89 independent of its gates or position in the sequence .",
    "similarly , we assume an overall error probability @xmath90 for state preparation , the last inverting gate and its pauli randomization , and measurement .",
    "then the mean of @xmath88 with respect to repetitions of the experiment satisfies @xmath91 for two qubits .",
    "the case of more than two qubits is discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : benchn ] . note that @xmath92 is the depolarization probability if the error probability is @xmath93 .",
    "the probability of not depolarizing the state in a sequence is the product of the probabilities of not depolarizing in each step . to derive the equation ,",
    "note that in terms of @xmath94 , the probability of not depolarizing is @xmath95 .",
    "assuming that the experimental observations are consistent with the simple exponential behavior suggested by this formula , we use it as the defining formula for the epo @xmath89 of a random clifford unitary , regardless of the actual behavior of errors .",
    "in particular , in the context of these benchmarks , we associate the epo with the decay parameter of the error probabilities @xmath88 rather than a particular exact parameter of the underlying physical errors .",
    "this supports the platform - independent use of randomized benchmarking .",
    "if the simple depolarizing assumption does not hold , then @xmath94 may exhibit non - exponential and transient behaviors ; see the discussion below .",
    "however , the twirling effected by the randomization is intended to induce behavior that matches the one implied by this assumption .    to isolate the epg of the phase gate @xmath20 ( or any other gate )",
    "we generate a second set of sequences by inserting @xmath20 after each random clifford unitary .",
    "the final inverting clifford unitary is chosen in the same way as before , taking into account the effect of the additional @xmath20 gates to ensure that the final state is a predictable computational basis state in the absence of errors . under the same idealizing assumptions that yield eq .",

    "in an ideal experiment @xmath90 should be the same , but the model must take into consideration that it might have changed , for example due to experimental drifts .",
    "explicitly , @xmath97 where @xmath98 is the probability of error of a step consisting of a random clifford gate and @xmath20 . in this context , the assumptions on the error behavior of @xmath99 could be relaxed from simple depolarization .",

    "because of the pre - existing benchmarks , we did not implement the above protocol for each qubit , but used a one - qubit benchmarking protocol similar to that of ref .",
    "briefly , the length of a sequence is the number of steps that consist of a pauli gate ( @xmath56-pulse ) followed by a clifford gate ( @xmath103-pulse ) on each qubit .",

    "second , both sets of data seem to dip below the fit near the end .",
    "together these observations suggest an increased epo for later clifford unitaries . indeed , dropping the first points from the analysis suggests higher epos .",
    "for example , the fits for the last four and three sequence lengths have epos of @xmath221 and @xmath222 , respectively .",
    "the corresponding epgs are @xmath37 and @xmath223 .",
    "note that the second values are from a two - parameter fit to three points , which reduces their significance .",
    "the fits to the first four sequence lengths give an epo of @xmath34 and an epg of @xmath224 .",
    "the higher epos for longer sequences could be related to the fact that unlike the shorter ones , they were run only in the last or last two sets of experiments , without recalibrating pulse parameters except as noted above .",
    "we attempted to confirm this hypothesis by analyzing the results for sequence lengths one to three separately for each set .",
    "the results of this analysis are consistent with a drop but have insufficient signal - to - noise to be conclusive .    in principle , we would like the platform to have the property that errors reach stationary behavior soon after state preparation , and the benchmark s reported epo should reflect the stationary error . as noted above , we were not able to implement long enough or sufficiently many sequences to clearly observe stationary behavior , or to determine the extent to which the behavior is nonstationary .",
    "the epo and epg reported in the abstract are determined from all six lengths tested  given the `` early '' and `` late '' values above , we believe that they are a good representation of mid - length behavior of gate errors . our inability to consistently run sequences of length longer than six prevents any claims of stationary behavior .",
    "other issues with the exponential fits that can arise include the possibility that the curves are a mixture of exponentials , as would be expected if the epos change slowly compared to the time required to run a sequence . in this case",
    ", the apparent epos would tend to decrease with increasing sequence length , as the higher - epo runs affect the loss at shorter lengths , but tail behavior is dominated by the slowest decay . given the observations of the previous paragraph and the available statistics , we can not usefully test for this possibility .",
    "now we consider consistency between the measured epos and epgs .",
    "we estimate the epo that we should have measured given the epgs obtained from the one - qubit and the phase gate benchmarks . for this estimate , we count the complexity of sequences of one - qubit pulses in terms of the number of effective @xmath103-pulses applied .",
    "this counts only pulses around the @xmath225 or @xmath226 axes , taking into consideration that @xmath227-axis pulses and identity gates are essentially error - free .",
    "the @xmath56-pulses are counted as two @xmath103-pulses .",
    "coherent error addition is neglected .",
    "the one - qubit benchmark s steps each have an average of @xmath228 effective @xmath103-pulses per qubit . if we use @xmath229 as a representative error probability per step from the one - qubit benchmark ( fig .",
    "[ rbdatasq ] ) , we obtain @xmath230 as the linearized error probability per one - qubit @xmath103-pulse .",
    "the factor of @xmath231 converts the average probability of error for one qubit to that for two qubits under the assumptions that the other qubit has no error and any pauli error is twirled to a depolarizing error . for the purpose of this calculation , we take the error probability per phase gate to be @xmath232 .",
    "each step in the clifford benchmark has an average of @xmath233 effective @xmath103 pulses and @xmath31 phase gates .",
    "the linearized error probability for a step can therefore be estimated as @xmath234 , with a standard error of about @xmath235 , if we add the statistical errors in quadrature .",
    "this linear approximation is expected to give a pessimistic estimate , but in this case , the nonlinear correction is smaller than the error in the estimate .",
    "while our estimate gives a value below the measured epo , the difference appears not to be statistically significant .",
    "we emphasize that the above strategy for estimating the epo from epgs neglects coherent error addition , which tends to increase the error , and internal error cancellation that could arise from the way pulses are combined within a step .",
    "we consider known sources of errors and estimate their contribution to the epg of @xmath20 .",
    "spontaneous emission is a fundamental source of error for transitions driven by stimulated - raman transitions ; here the laser beams are tuned approximately @xmath236 below the @xmath148 state  @xcite .",
    "we simulate that for our laser parameters , this should contribute an error probability of @xmath237 to a one - qubit @xmath56-pulse and @xmath238 to the phase gate .",
    "( recall that the phase gate consists of an ms gate surrounded by @xmath158-pulses . )",
    "errors can also arise from imperfect calibrations and slow drifts of the gate parameters .",

    "the predicted variation is generally somewhat less than the measured one but does not indicate coherence of the errors in a given sequence because our simple model does not account for all incoherent effects .",
    "the main sources of coherent errors are due to drifts in beam intensity , relative laser field phases for the beams implementing the phase gate , and stark - shifted frequencies .",
    "these drifts result in errors in pulse time , and phase and frequency calibration , each of which are estimated to contribute approximately equally to the epg .",

    "one possibility is to divide the epo by @xmath269 , the average over clifford unitaries of the minimum number of controlled - not gates needed to implement them with a circuit consisting of controlled - not gates and arbitrary one - qubit clifford gates . for two qubits ,",
    "this normalization factor is determined by @xmath270 , so the normalized clifford epo for our benchmark is @xmath271 . for three qubits we determined @xmath272 rounded at the last digit .",
    "since the number of clifford unitaries grows very rapidly with @xmath38 , it may be difficult to determine the normalization factor exactly for @xmath273 .",
    "it is known that @xmath269 scales as @xmath69  @xcite .",
    "while this complexity may seem relatively large at first , any viable platform must be able to implement circuits of this size , if not much larger .",
    "in particular , any successful demonstration of the clifford benchmark also establishes the ability to implement non - trivial circuits for algorithmic purposes .",
    "if the primary purpose of the experiment is to benchmark individual gates by inserting them after randomized unitaries , it is desirable to find ways to achieve sufficient randomization that are more efficient than random clifford unitaries . in particular , to exhibit an epg of a gate in this way , it suffices for the random unitaries to approximate a so - called unitary @xmath64-design as explained in  @xcite .",
    "such approximations are possible with circuits involving a logarithmic multiple of @xmath38 two - qubit gates  @xcite .",
    "how to best translate these theoretical ideas into a practical benchmark remains to be determined .",
    "for the clifford benchmark , the strategy for choosing the final unitary @xmath274 of a sequence given above is more constrained than necessary for ensuring that the measurement outcome is deterministic in the absence of error .",
    "this may result in less effective error depolarization .",
    "we suggest two alternatives that greatly reduce the constraints on @xmath274 . the first is to choose @xmath274 uniformly at random from all clifford unitaries that ensure that the final state in the absence of error is a logical state .",
    "this is equivalent to constructing @xmath274 as an implementation of the inverse of the previous unitaries followed by a random gate that can be decomposed into cnot and pauli product operators .",
    "an even more randomizing approach is to choose @xmath274 as suggested in ref .",
    "@xcite . in this case",
    ", @xmath274 is composed of a uniformly random clifford unitary followed by one - qubit clifford gates randomly chosen to ensure that a randomly chosen joint @xmath104-measurement is deterministic in the absence of errors . by a joint @xmath104-measurement",
    "we mean measurement of a product of @xmath82 operators on a subset of the qubits .",
    "the product s eigenvalues are @xmath275 and can be determined by multiplying the standard basis measurement outcomes of the qubits in the subset , where a qubit s @xmath276 and @xmath110 measurement outcomes are mapped to @xmath110 , @xmath81 , respectively .",
    "this strategy takes advantage of the often much better fidelity of one - qubit gates for the sequence - dependent part of the last unitary .",
    "a disadvantage is that instead of @xmath38 deterministic bit values , only one bit value is obtained in each run of the experiment . to fit the resulting data , we use eqs .  [ eq1n ] and  [ eq4n ] with @xmath277",
    "in summary , we have described a protocol for randomized benchmarking of gates in a quantum information processor and implemented the protocol experimentally on two qubits to measure the error per operation of arbitrary two - qubit clifford unitaries .",
    "the protocol we propose is independent of the gate set that is experimentally implemented and so can provide an easily portable method for evaluating the performance of clifford unitaries on different physical platforms .",
    "furthermore , with this method it is straightforward to isolate the fidelity of a specific two - qubit gate .",
    "we have emphasized some of the consistency checks that can be performed to qualify the reported errors per operation or gate .",
    "looking ahead , this randomized benchmarking protocol should prove useful as different experimental implementations of quantum information processors aim to increase the number of qubits and work to decrease the errors towards what is required for fault - tolerance .",
