    "<S> even if new data indicate that direct cp violation in @xmath0-meson decays is compatible with the standard model expectation , the first hints for direct cp violation have triggered a lot of interest , and charm phenomenology will remain an essential part of new physics searches due to its unique role as a probe for flavor - changing neutral currents among up - type quarks . </S>",
    "<S> charm physics poses considerable theoretical challenges , because the charm mass is neither light nor truly heavy . </S>",
    "<S> the heavy quark expansion ( hqe ) provides a perturbative expansion in the inverse heavy quark mass for inclusive rates . </S>",
    "<S> it has proved to be very successful in the @xmath1 sector , yet its validity for charm decays has often been questioned . </S>",
    "<S> we present results of a hqe study of @xmath0-meson lifetimes including nlo qcd and subleading @xmath2 corrections . </S>",
    "<S> we find good agreement with experimental data , but with huge hadronic uncertainties due to missing lattice input for hadronic matrix elements . </S>"
