    "recent achievements in magnetic resonance force microscopy ( mrfm ) promise a single spin detection in the near future @xcite .",
    "one may expect that single spin signal will represent a random sequence of quantum jumps .",
    "the important problem for the theory is modeling of quantum jumps in mrfm and the computation of their statistical characteristics . in this paper",
    "we propose a simple model which describes quantum jumps in mrfm single spin detection .",
    "we consider the oscillating cantilever - driven adiabatic reversals technique ( oscar ) which currently is the most promising approach for single spin detection @xcite . in oscar",
    "the cantilever tip ( ct ) with a ferromagnetic particle oscillates , causing the periodic adiabatic reversals of the effective magnetic field on spin .",
    "the spin follows the effective magnetic field causing a tiny frequency shift of the ct vibrations which is measured .    in the second section",
    "we consider the schrdinger dynamics of the ct - spin system which underlines our model of quantum jumps . in the third section",
    "we describe our model and present the results of the computer simulations . in conclusion",
    "we discuss our results .",

    "field ; @xmath1 is the magnetic moment of the ferromagnetic particle ; @xmath2 is a spin near the surface of the sample . ]",
    "we consider a vertical cantilever with a ferromagnetic particle attached to the ct and oscillating along the @xmath3-axis which is parallel to the surface of the sample .",
    "( see fig .",
    "the hamiltonian of the ct - spin system in the system of coordinates which rotates with a circularly polarized _ rf",
    "_ field can be written as @xmath4 here @xmath5 is the effective momentum of the ct , @xmath6 is its coordinate , the first term describes the effective energy of the ct ; the second term describes the interaction between the spin and the _ rf _ field ; the third term describes the interaction between the ct and the spin ; and the last term describes the interaction between the spin and the random magnetic field which causes a deviation of spin from the effective magnetic field when the latter passes through the transverse @xmath7-plane @xcite .",
    "all quantities in ( 1 ) are dimensionless : @xmath5 and @xmath6 are expressed in terms of the `` quantum units '' @xmath8 and @xmath9 @xmath10 the dimensionless parameters @xmath11 , @xmath12 , and @xmath13 are defined as @xmath14 @xmath15 here @xmath16 is the @xmath17-component of the `` regular magnetic field '' which includes @xmath18 and the regular dipole - magnetic field produced by the ferromagnetic particle at the location of the spin ; @xmath19 is the @xmath17-component of the random field with zero average value ; @xmath20 is the magnitude of the spin gyromagnetic ratio : @xmath21 and @xmath22 are the effective spring constant and fundamental frequency of the ct ; and @xmath23 is the dimensionless time .    using the parameters presented in @xcite @xmath24 @xmath25 we can estimate all parameters in ( 1 ) except of @xmath26 : @xmath27 to simplify computer simulations we considered the function @xmath13 to be a random telegraph signal with two values @xmath28 .",
    "the time interval between two consecutive `` kicks '' of @xmath13 was taken randomly from the interval @xmath29 , with the average time interval , @xmath30 , close to the rabi period @xmath31 @xmath32 we choose the initial state of the ct to be a coherent quasiclassical state , and the average spin to be pointed along the `` regular '' effective magnetic field with the components @xmath33 .",
    "below we describe briefly the results of our computer simulations .",
    "our simulations reveal the formation of a schrdinger cat state for the ct : the probability distribution function @xmath34 splits into two peaks .",
    "similar to our previous computations @xcite one peak corresponds to the average spin pointing in the direction of the effective magnetic field , while the other one corresponds to the opposite direction of the average spin .",
    "the two peaks oscillate with slightly different periods due to the back action of the spin as expected in the oscar technique @xcite . unlike our previous papers @xcite , the appearance of two peaks is not connected with the initial deviation of the spin from the direction of the effective field .",
    "it is induced by the action of the random field @xmath13 which causes this deviation in the process of the spin - ct dynamics .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that the interaction with the environment quickly destroys quantum coherence between the two peaks : the schrdinger cat state of the ct quickly transforms into a statistical mixture of the two possible ct trajectories .",
    "thus , the random magnetic field @xmath13 causes the quantum jumps : spin may `` jump '' to the opposite direction relative to the effective magnetic field and , correspondingly , the ct may slightly change the period of its oscillations .    unfortunately , our present simulations consume too much computer time to be able to reveal more than one spin jump .",
    "this approach , clearly , does allow one not to study statistical characteristics of quantum jumps .",
    "consequently we developed a simplified model which describes statistical properties of the spin jumps .",
    "@xmath35 and @xmath36 kicks ; the solid line is a fit with @xmath37 ; ( b ) enlargement of ( a ) ]    we assume that every `` kick '' provided by the function @xmath13 is followed by the collapse of the wave function . before the kick , the spin points in ( or opposite to ) the direction of the effective magnetic field . after the kick there appears the finite angle @xmath38 between the new direction of the effective field and the average spin .",
    "the probability for the spin to `` accept '' the `` before - kick '' direction relative to the new effective field is @xmath39 .",
    "the probability to `` accept '' the opposite direction , i.e. the probability of a quantum jump is @xmath40 .",
    "( it is clear that a significant probability of a quantum jump appears only when the effective field passes the transversal @xmath7-plane . in the transversal plane",
    ", the effective field has the minimum value .",
    "thus , after every kick of the random field our computer code decides the `` fate '' of the spin in accordance with the probabilities of two events : to restore the previous direction relatively to the effective field , or to experience a quantum jump . in our model",
    "the ct experiences harmonic oscillations @xmath41 where @xmath42 correspond to two ct trajectories with the spin pointing in the direction of ( or opposite to ) the corresponding effective field , and @xmath43 is the ct frequency shift .",
    "the components of the effective field are given by @xmath44 from the experimental data @xcite for the ct amplitude @xmath45 nm we obtain @xmath46 .",
    "the frequency shift , @xmath43 , can be estimated as @xcite @xmath47    note that our model contains two important simplifications : first , we assume that the wave function collapse occurs immediately after the `` kick '' of the random field . thus , we ignore the finite time when the spin - ct system is in an entangled state .",
    "second , in a real situation the deviation of the spin from the effective field is a `` quasi ",
    "resonance '' process caused by the cantilever modes whose frequencies are close to the rabi frequency . in our model",
    "this deviation appears as a result of the `` kick '' of the random field .    .",
    "the full line corresponds to the value @xmath48 , the squares represent @xmath49 , the crosses @xmath50 , the circles @xmath51 the dashed line corresponds to the value @xmath52 .",
    "data have been obtained by varying parameters @xmath53 and @xmath30 in the ranges : @xmath54 and @xmath55 . ]    below we describe the results of our simulations .",
    "[ f2 ] demonstrates a typical probability distribution of time intervals , @xmath56 , between two consecutive quantum jumps .",
    "the probability distribution is a sequence of sharp peaks at @xmath57 with the poisson - like amplitude @xmath58 ( certainly , @xmath59 at @xmath60 . )",
    "the sharp peak appears as the probability of the quantum jump is significant when the spin passes through the transversal plane , i.e. every half - period of the ct oscillation which is equal to @xmath61 .",
    "the average value of the time interval @xmath62 was found to be @xmath63 with an error less than 3% .",
    "the standard deviation is equal to @xmath64 with the same accuracy @xmath65    we studied the dependence of the average value @xmath62 on the parameters of our model .",
    "we have found that @xmath62 does not depend on @xmath66 or @xmath67 .",
    "( we varied @xmath66 from @xmath68 to @xmath30 and changed @xmath43 up to one order of magnitude . ) at a fixed value of the amplitude @xmath69 the value of @xmath62 is approximately proportional to @xmath70 .",
    "[ f3 ] demonstrates this dependence .",
    "the best fit for the numerical points in fig .",
    "[ f3 ] is given by @xmath71 for @xmath72 we have @xmath73 , @xmath74 .",
    "for the six fold value @xmath75 we obtained the same value of @xmath76 and @xmath77 .",
    "if we estimate the amplitude of the random ct vibrations near the rabi frequency as 1 pm , then @xmath78 putting @xmath79 and the experimental value for @xmath31 ( 6 ) we obtain @xmath80 s for @xmath81 and @xmath82 s for @xmath83 .",
    "these values are close to the experimental characteristic times of @xmath84 s and @xmath85 s reported in @xcite .",
    "next we computed the correlation function for the ct frequency shift @xmath86 where @xmath87 , and @xmath88 indicates an average over time",
    ".     for different parameters : circles @xmath89 , squares @xmath90 , triangles @xmath91 . in all cases @xmath92 .",
    "the dashed curves show the exponential approximation of the correlation function @xmath93 with @xmath94 , respectively . ]    in fig.4 we show the correlation function @xmath95 for three different values of parameters as indicated in the legend .",
    "as one can see , the general behavior is well described by the exponential function ( indicated by dashed lines in fig.4 ) @xmath93 .",
    "the relation between the correlation time @xmath96 and @xmath62 was found to be @xmath97 .",
    "we developed a simple model which describes quantum jumps of spins in the oscar mrfm technique and which allowed us to compute the statistical characteristics of quantum jumps . in our model the average time interval @xmath62 between two consecutive jumps and the correlation time @xmath96 are proportional to the characteristic time of the magnetic noise , and inversely proportional to the square of the magnetic noise amplitude . using experimental parameters @xcite and a reasonable value for the ct noisy amplitude we obtained the value of @xmath62 which is close to the experimental value of the characteristic time of oscar mrfm signal .",
