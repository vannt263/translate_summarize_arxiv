    "models of innovation diffusion seek to understand how new ideas , products , or practices spread within a society through various channels  @xcite .",
    "innovation may refer to new technologies or deviations from existing social norms . rather than a single theory ,",
    "innovation diffusion represents a theoretical framework that encompasses a range of social models in which the term  diffusion \" can mean contagion , imitation , and social learning  .",
    "many of the traditional approaches  @xcite to innovation diffusion modeling are based on a mean - field approximation and are referred to as aggregate models .",
    "an influential example is the seminal bass model  @xcite , where innovation spreads as the result of either an adopter converting a susceptible ( contagion ) , or through external influences on susceptibles ( advertising and mass media ) .",
    "the basic outcome of the bass model is that the time dependence of the fraction of adopters exhibits a sigmoidal shape  @xcite .",
    "thus significant adoption arises only after some latency period , after which complete adoption is quickly achieved .",
    "while the bass and related models have been successful in fitting historic data  @xcite , there are several limitations of these approaches :    * the predictive power of the bass model is uncertain  @xcite . *",
    "aggregate models are based on infinitely large , homogeneous populations  @xcite and can not account for sample - specific differences and related fluctuation phenomena .",
    "* bass - like models do not account for behavioral patterns that result from social reinforcement and `` bandwagon '' pressure  @xcite . *",
    "aggregate models assume a `` pro - innovation bias '' and thus can not reproduce phenomena such as incomplete adoption  @xcite .",
    "we are particularly interested in situations where innovation can be accompanied by controversy , suspicion , or rejection within some social circles , potentially leading to incomplete adoption .",
    "as an example , mobile phones are owned by 90% of americans",
    "@xcite as of 2014 , but their use is accompanied by continued health and safety concerns  @xcite .",
    "similarly , the coverage of the measles , mumps and rubella vaccine in the united kingdom reached 92.7% in 201314 , below the target level of 95% coverage for herd immunity .",
    "this incomplete adoption level may result from doubts about vaccine effectiveness and safety concerns promulgated by anti - vaccination movements  @xcite .",
    "such doubts seem to persist even in the face of their apparently negative consequences , such as the measles epidemic that seemed to have its inception in disneyland at the start of 2015 .    motivated by these facts , we introduce a model for the diffusion of an innovation , using a statistical physics approach  @xcite , in which we account for the competing role of `` luddites '' in hindering the spread of the innovation .",
    "agents may either be luddites ( opposed to innovation ) , `` ignorants '' ( no knowledge of the innovation ) , `` susceptibles '' ( receptive to innovation ) , or `` adopters '' of the innovation .",
    "we dub this the lisa ( luddites / ignorants / susceptibles / adopters ) model .",
    "the main new feature of the lisa model is the existence of agents that reject the innovation in response to the spread of adoption .",
    "previous work @xcite has considered the introduction of ` resistance leaders ' who spread a negative response to the innovation , akin to the spread of a competing innovation . the lisa model differs from this approach by considering agents who respond in particular to the rate of uptake of the innovation .",
    "we use the term `` luddites '' in reference to the 19th - century luddism movement in which english textile artisans protested against newly developed labor - saving machinery  @xcite .",
    "we are interested in determining how luddism limits the final level of adoption and how the presence of luddites leads to a trade - off between adoption levels and adoption times scales .",
    "the lisa model is defined in the next section , while the behavior of the model in the mean - field limit and on complete graphs is investigated in section  [ sec : mf ] .",
    "section  [ sec : graphs ] focuses on the model dynamics on random graphs and on a one - dimensional regular lattice .",
    "for all these substrates , we investigate how luddism affects the final level of adoption and the time scale of adoption .",
    "we also elucidate a dichotomy between the cases of slow but relatively universal adoption for low values of an intrinsic innovation rate , and the rapid but limited spread of innovation that occurs in the opposite limit .",
    "our conclusions are presented in section  [ sec : conc ] .",
    "as a helpful preliminary , let us review the simpler two - state bass model of innovation diffusion . here",
    "a population consists of two types of agents : susceptibles @xmath0 or adopters @xmath1 . in the bass model",
    ", susceptibles can become adopters via either of two processes :    * contagion - driven conversion : a susceptible converts to an adopter by interacting with another adopter , as represented by the process @xmath2 .",
    "* spontaneous adoption : a susceptible converts to an adopter , @xmath3 .",
    "the characteristic feature of the bass model is that the adopter density exhibits a sigmoidal time dependence , in which the time derivative of this density has a sharp peak ( corresponding to an inflection point in the time dependence of the density itself ) , before complete adoption eventually occurs  @xcite .",
    "can become a luddite @xmath4 with rate @xmath5 ( in a mean - field setting ) ; an ignorant can also become a susceptible @xmath0 by contagion with rate proportional to the susceptible density . a susceptible spontaneously becomes an adopter at rate @xmath6 . ]",
    "our lisa model is a four - state system that consists of a population of @xmath7 individuals that can each be in the states of luddite ( @xmath4 ) , ignorant ( @xmath8 ) , susceptible ( @xmath0 ) , or adopter ( @xmath1 ) .",
    "ignorant agents may either be persuaded to become susceptible , and thence reach the adopter state , or they may become a luddite and permanently oppose the spread of the innovation . specifically , the elemental steps of our lisa model are the following ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : model ] ) :    1 .",
    "contagion - driven conversion : an ignorant agent becomes susceptible by interacting with another susceptible agent .",
    "that is , @xmath9 with rate 1 . 2",
    ".   spontaneous adoption : a susceptible agent spontaneously becomes an adopter , @xmath3 with rate @xmath6 .. yet , this two - body process would yield similar features as our lisa model , but would be technically more tedious to handle .",
    "luddism : ignorants may permanently reject the innovation and become luddites , @xmath10 , with a rate proportional to the change in the density of adopters in its neighborhood .    the luddism mechanism outlined above incorporates two aspects of negative behavior towards innovation . the first represents a fear of innovation or its consequences , as in the case of the historical luddism movement , where the introduction of labor - saving machinery caused fear over job security  @xcite .",
    "the second is that of non - conformity ; agents may oppose the innovation simply due to its rapid increase in popularity  @xcite .",
    "we model this feature by defining the rate at which the luddite density increases to be _ proportional _ to the adoption rate , with constant of proportionality denoted by @xmath11 , the luddism parameter .",
    "the multi - stage progression @xmath12 may also be viewed as a type of social reinforcement mechanism in which adoption follows from a succession of prompts from neighbors  @xcite . the equivalent 3-state model with only luddites , ignorants and adopters creates a polarized community creates a polarized community where the ratio of adopters to luddites is dependent only on the luddism parameter , @xmath11 .",
    "other relevant models @xcite have found that high levels of advertising can prompt a negative response to innovation which can not be replicated with only three states .",
    "the combination of a multi - stage progression to adoption , together with the luddite mechanism , arguably represents the simplest generalization of the bass model that gives rise to non - trivial long - time state with incomplete adoption of an innovation .",
    "we first consider the lisa model in the mean - field limit , where agents are perfectly mixed .",
    "the densities of each type of agent are given by @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the number of agents of type @xmath15 , and @xmath7 is the total number of agents .",
    "we consider the limit @xmath16 , so that all densities are continuous variables and all fluctuations are negligible . in this",
    "setting , the evolution of the agent densities is described by the rate equations : @xmath17 where the dot denotes the time derivative and we define @xmath18 . since the total density is conserved , i.e. , @xmath19 , the sum of these rate equations equals zero .",
    "a natural initial condition is a population that consists of a small density of susceptible agents that initiate the dynamics , while all other agents are ignorant ; that is , @xmath20 and @xmath21 .    to solve these rate equations , it is useful to introduce the modified time variable @xmath22 , which linearize the rate equations to @xmath23 with solution @xmath24    there are two basic regimes of behavior that are controlled by the adoption rate @xmath6 , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : single ] :    1 .",
    "_ extensive adoption_. when @xmath25 , the density of susceptibles @xmath26 varies non - monotonically in time and reaches a maximum value @xmath27 at an `` inception '' time @xmath28 , after which @xmath26 decays to 0 .",
    "this non - monotonicity leads to a sigmoidal curve for the adopter density , with @xmath29 increasing rapidly for @xmath30 and increasing very slowly for @xmath31 .",
    "the rescaled inception time @xmath32 is determined by the criterion @xmath33 , or equivalently , @xmath34 .",
    "this gives @xmath35 2 .",
    "_ sparse adoption_. when @xmath36 , the susceptibles quickly become adopters , leaving behind a substantial static population of ignorants and a small fraction of adopters , as well as luddites .",
    "numerical simulations of the lisa model on a large complete graph _ and _ numerical integration of the rate equations , illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : single ] , give results that are virtually indistinguishable .",
    "we can express the densities in terms of the physical time @xmath37 by inverting @xmath38 to give @xmath39 .",

    "we have   has been neglected .",
    "this approximation is legitimate since @xmath43 is integrated from @xmath44 to @xmath45 and therefore @xmath46 in the regime being considered .",
    "a similar reasoning , with @xmath47 , leads to ( [ eqn : t*_approx ] ) when @xmath41 . ]",

    "the stationary state is reached when all susceptibles disappear , so that no further reactions can occur .",
    "this gives the criterion @xmath51 which defines the value of @xmath52 . by solving the third line of eq .",
    ", we obtain @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the principal branch of the lambert function @xmath55 , which is defined as the solution of @xmath56 . here",
    "@xmath52 is a decreasing function of the adoption rate @xmath6 , with @xmath57 in the high and low adoption rate regimes .",
    "we now determine the final densities by substituting @xmath58 into eqs .  .",

    "it is also worth noting that in the absence of luddites , complete adoption is almost , but not completely achieved , since the final densities of adopters and ignorants are @xmath73 and @xmath74 , see fig.3 ( bottom ) .    to assess the role of finite-@xmath7 fluctuations on the dynamics",
    ", we simulate the lisa model on complete graphs of @xmath7 nodes using the gillespie algorithm  @xcite . at long times",
    "we find that the densities of each species , @xmath75 , fluctuates around the corresponding mean - field density , with a root - mean - square fluctuation of amplitude @xmath76 , as expected from general properties of this class of reaction processes  @xcite .",
    "we also find that the probability distribution of @xmath75 is a gaussian of width of order @xmath77 that is centered on the mean - field density .",
    "we also estimate the completion time @xmath78 for the system to reach its final state by the physical criterion that @xmath79 .",

    "we implement the lisa model on such a graph using the gillespie algorithm  @xcite . the propensity for a susceptible to become",
    "an adopter is @xmath6 , independent of the local environment .",
    "the propensity for an ignorant node @xmath86 to become susceptible if it has @xmath88 susceptible neighbors is @xmath89 .",
    "the propensity of an ignorant node @xmath86 to become a luddite is @xmath90 , where @xmath91 is the degree ( number of neighbors ) of node @xmath86 , and @xmath92 is the fraction of nodes in the neighborhood of @xmath86 that are in the susceptible state .",
    "thus the propensity of @xmath86 to become a luddite is proportional to the sum of its susceptible neighbors propensities to adopt .",
    "this rate encodes node @xmath86 s local knowledge of the rate of adoption .",
    "these reaction rates approach those of the complete graph , described in section  [ sec : mf ] , as the average degree of the graph increases .",
    "we first study the lisa model on the class of erds - rnyi ( er ) random graphs in which an edge between any two nodes occurs with a fixed probability @xmath93 .",
    "this construction leads to a binomial degree distribution for the er graph in which each node has , on average , @xmath94 neighbors  @xcite . under the assumption of no correlations between the degrees of neighboring nodes ,",
    "the adjacency matrix may be written as @xmath95 .",
    "the lisa dynamics on er graphs can now be approximately described by a natural generalization of the mean - field theory in which there are suitably defined reaction rates . in particular , if @xmath96 is the probability that a node @xmath86 is susceptible and @xmath97 is the probability that a node @xmath87 is ignorant , then the density of susceptibles @xmath26 evolves as @xmath98\\approx s\\big[(k / n)i-\\gamma\\big],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] since each susceptible interacts with @xmath99 of its @xmath7 neighbors on average .",
    "thus on the er graph there is a rescaling of the rate of the two - body contagion process @xmath100 , whereas the rates of the remaining one - body processes remain unaltered .",
    "hence we obtain the effective rate equations @xmath101 where , for later convenience , we define @xmath102 .    as in the case of the mean - field dynamics , the above equations predict two regimes of behavior ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : er_single ] ) :    1 .   _ slow but extensive adoption _ ( @xmath103 ) . here",

    "when @xmath106 , the densities of @xmath1 and @xmath4 are characterized by a sigmoidal time dependence , whereas the density of @xmath0 has a peak at the inception time @xmath28 , with time evolution that is slower than on complete graphs , since each agent has now a finite neighborhood .",
    "the stationary state can be determined by again noting that becomes linear in terms of the variable @xmath107 . thus proceeding as in section  [ sec : mf ] , we find the steady state by the condition @xmath51 .",
    "this yields @xmath108 where now @xmath109     and @xmath63 on the average degree for er graphs with @xmath110 nodes .",

    "it is instructive to compare the predictions with the results of stochastic simulations , and also compare with the equivalent results for the complete graph .",
    "figure  [ fig : er_parameters ] shows simulation results for the stationary densities as a function of the mean degree .",
    "these results confirm that the mean - field predictions correctly capture the functional dependence of the steady state on the various parameters .",

    "the dependence on @xmath6 and @xmath11 are qualitatively similar to those observed on complete graphs .",
    "the influence of demographic fluctuations can be heuristically assessed by viewing er graphs of mean degree @xmath99 as a meta - population that consists of @xmath117 patches each comprising a well - mixed population of size @xmath99 . according to this picture , when @xmath118 , the number of agents in each of the @xmath117 components fluctuates in a range of @xmath119 about its average value .",
    "since these are independent fluctuations , the noise in the whole population should have an amplitude @xmath120 , which leads to fluctuations in the densities of order @xmath77 .",
    "this prediction is confirmed by our simulations  we find that @xmath121 has a gaussian probability distribution around @xmath63 with a width that decays as @xmath77 .",
    "the same behavior is observed for @xmath69 and @xmath122 but not for @xmath123 as @xmath80 is a requirement for the completion of the dynamics .",
    "the mean - field steady state predictions are summarized in fig .",
    "[ fig : phase ] , where we plot the mean - field steady state predictions corresponding to each pair of steady state densities being equal .",
    "for example , the solid curve corresponds to parameter values for which @xmath124 .",

    ", the most desirable outcome would be region ( i ) , where adopters form the largest steady - state group and luddites form the smallest . whilst adopters also form the largest group in region ( ii ) , luddites form the second largest group and so this region could be considered a controversial success  despite the majority adopting , a significant number of people have responded negatively .",
    "conversely , regions ( iii ) and ( iv ) could both be considered controversial failures because luddites form the largest groups . regions ( v ) and ( vi ) represent ineffective campaigns because ignorants form the largest steady state groups .     for @xmath126 and @xmath65 .",
    "the contours @xmath127 , @xmath128 , and @xmath129 split the domain into six regions which characterize the innovation ( see main text ) . ]    in summary , we have shown that the lisa dynamics on er graphs can be accurately approximated by using mean - field assumptions , provided that the average degree is sufficiently high ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : er_parameters ] ) .",
    "recent controlled experiments have shown that innovation may spread more efficiently on clustered graphs and lattices than on random networks  @xcite . to understand the effect of regular topology on the spread of an innovation , and where the mean - field approximation breaks down , we investigate the lisa dynamics on one - dimensional lattices .",

    "motivated by these considerations we have introduced a multi - stage generalization of the bass model , the lisa model , that does not unavoidably lead to complete adoption . the main new feature of our model is the introduction of luddites that permanently oppose the spread of innovation in their neighborhood . in the lisa model , ignorant individuals can successively become susceptibles and then adopters , or turn to luddism in response to a high rate of adoption and permanently reject the innovation .",
    "we carried out a detailed analysis of the properties of the lisa model on complete graphs and erds - rnyi random graphs , as well as on one - dimensional lattices .",
    "in particular , we focused on the steady states and completion time ( time to reach stationarity ) .",
    "we showed that significant insights can be gained from a simple mean - field analysis that aptly captures the qualitative aspects of the two basic regimes of the lisa dynamics .",
    "when the rate of adoption is low , the population slowly converges to a final state that consists of a high concentration of adopters . in the converse case",
    ", the stationary state is reached much more quickly , but the final fraction of adopters is much lower and is severely limited by the significant densities of luddites and ignorants .",
    "since most models of innovation diffusion are formulated at mean - field level , an important aspect of this work has also been to reveal the limitations of the mean - field approximation . in particular , for erds - rnyi random graphs with low mean degree and one - dimensional lattices , the mean - field approximation proves inaccurate .",
    "this is due to the formation of luddites which isolate domains of ignorants from the innovation , an effect particularly apparently in one dimension",
    ". it would be worthwhile to investigate the lisa model on modular networks , where luddism has the potential to block the spread of innovation to entire communities .",
    "in addition to the work described in this paper , we also found that the mean - field approximation proves better on two - dimensional lattices than on one - dimensional lattices .    in summary , the lisa model is a simple , but non - trivial , innovation diffusion model that accounts for the possibility that the promotion of an innovation may be tempered by the alienation of some individuals .",
    "these in turn affect the spread of the innovation .",
    "interestingly , our model outlines two possible marketing scenarios : if one is interested in reaching a high level of adoption then this can only be achieved over long time scales , since the rate of adoption must be low .",
    "however , if the priority is to attain a finite level of adoption as quickly as possible regardless of the alienation that this may cause , then a high rate of adoption is preferable .",

    "in this appendix we describe the calculation of the final fractions of each type of agent on one - dimensional lattices .",
    "these results are compared with simulations in fig .",
    "[ fig:1dlattice_gamma ] of section  [ sec:1d ] .      initially , the nodes on the one - dimensional lattice are either ignorant , with probability @xmath155 , or susceptible , with probability @xmath156 .",
    "thus the initial configuration consists of connected domains of ignorant nodes bordered by susceptibles .",
    "moreover , since ignorants can only become susceptible if a neighbor is susceptible , domains of ignorants only evolve at their ignorant - susceptible interfaces",
    ". we will refer to these as `` active interfaces '' . at an active interface one of three events",
    "can occur :    * the ignorant node becomes susceptible , thus reducing the domain length by one , with probability @xmath157 * the ignorant node becomes a luddite , thus reducing the length of the domain by one and causing the interface to become inactive , with probability @xmath158 * the susceptible node becomes an adopter , thereby terminating the interface evolution , with probability @xmath159      let @xmath161 be the probability that a domain of ignorants of initial length @xmath153 with a _",
    "single _ ignorant - susceptible interface has a _ final _ length @xmath162 , with @xmath163 .",
    "we can determine @xmath161 as follows : if the final length of ignorants is @xmath162 , with @xmath164 , then either @xmath154 ignorant nodes must become susceptible before a susceptible node at the interface adopts , or @xmath165 ignorant nodes must become susceptible before an ignorant node at the interface becomes a luddite .",
    "these events occur with probabilities @xmath166 and @xmath167 respectively . using similar reasoning for the cases @xmath168 and @xmath169",
    ", we thus find @xmath170 by summing over @xmath154 , it can be shown that @xmath161 is normalized .",
    "we now consider the case where a connected region of @xmath153 ignorant nodes initially has two ignorant - susceptible interfaces .",
    "the probability @xmath152 that a region of ignorants of initial length @xmath153 with _ two _ active interfaces has final length @xmath162 is given by the recursion relation @xmath171 where the terms @xmath161 are given by .",
    "equation   captures the three possible events that can occur at the interface .",
    "if a susceptible node at the interface adopts , which occurs with probability @xmath172 , then the region of ignorants only has one remaining active interface left and there will be @xmath162 remaining ignorants with probability @xmath161 , as given in . if an ignorant node at the interface becomes a luddite , which occurs with probability @xmath173 , then again the region of ignorants will only have one active interface . since there will be one ignorant less the probability there will be @xmath162 remaining ignorants",
    "is @xmath174 . finally , if an ignorant node at the boundary becomes susceptible , which occurs with probability @xmath175 , then the probability that there are @xmath162 ignorants remaining is the same as if we had started with @xmath176 ignorant nodes , i.e. @xmath177 .    to solve the recursion relation we need @xmath178 and @xmath179 .",
    "the probability that a region of ignorants of initial length @xmath153 remains of length @xmath153 is given by @xmath180 also , the probability that a single ignorant node that initially has two susceptible neighbors becomes a susceptible or luddite is given by @xmath181 thus the solution to the recursion relation for @xmath182 is given by @xmath183 for @xmath184 we have @xmath185p_s^{n-1}\\\\ & + 2(n-1)p_ap_lp_s^{n-2}+(n-2)p_l^2p_s^{n-3},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and for @xmath169 we have @xmath186p_s^{n-1}\\\\ & + ( n-1)\\left(p_ap_s^n+2p_lp_s^{n-1}+p_l^2p_s^{n-2}\\right).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] again it is possible to check , by summing over @xmath154 and solving the resulting recursion relation , that @xmath152 is normalized .",
    "we can use @xmath152 to calculate the expected final length of ignorant domains @xmath187 . first note that since @xmath155 is the initial probability of being ignorant , the probability that a domain of ignorants initially has length @xmath188 is given by @xmath189 for large @xmath7 .",
    "thus we find that @xmath190 in principle , we may use the above to obtain an explicit expression for @xmath187 . in practice , however , we use the solutions to to calculate @xmath187 numerically .",
    "initially , the mean number of ignorants is given by @xmath191 and so dividing by the mean length of ignorant domains , @xmath192 , yields the expected number of ignorant domains , @xmath193 .",
    "thus the final density of ignorants is @xmath194    the probability that an ignorant domain survives is @xmath195 surviving ignorant domains have two interfaces , which are either ignorant - adopter or ignorant - luddite , with probabilities @xmath196 and @xmath197 , respectively .",
    "thus the expected number of luddites at the interfaces of non - vanishing ignorant domains is given by @xmath198    it is also possible for luddites to arise when a domain vanishes . by identifying the terms in @xmath199 that result in luddites ,",
    "it is possible to determine that the expected number of luddites that arise when a domain of initial size @xmath200 vanishes is given by @xmath201 and @xmath202 .",
    "thus the expected number of luddites that arise from domains of ignorants that vanish is @xmath203 summing eqs .   and and dividing by @xmath7 we arrive at the final density of luddites @xmath204",
    "since the dynamics cease when @xmath205 , the number of adopters can be found using the conservation law @xmath206 .",
