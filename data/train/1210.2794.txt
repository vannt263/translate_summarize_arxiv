    "this is the second of a series of papers to study the consistency of loop regularization ( lore ) scheme and the general structure of qft models in the higher - loop calculations . in our first paper@xcite",
    ", we have shown that the lore method is consistent for general scalar - type two - loop integrals .",
    "we studied the general @xmath0 integrals@xcite and mainly solved the problem of disentangling the overlapping divergences , which is the main new feature of the perturbative calculations beyond one - loop order .",
    "we argued that the overlapping divergence structure would , in general , transforms some of the ultraviolet ( uv ) divergences into the integrals of the ultraviolet divergence - preserving(uvdp ) parameters ( or feynman parameters ) .",
    "we found that the lore method was particularly suitable to regularize the uv divergences of this kind since we can easily transform the uvdp parameter integrals into the irreducible - loop - integral(ili)-like integrals by multiplying the integration variable by a mass scale , which is exactly the object regulated in the lore method .",
    "furthermore , it was very useful to introduce the bjorken and drell s analogy between the feynman diagrams and electric circuits , which allowed us to identify the uv divergences of the uvdp parameters with those contained in the subdiagrams of the original feynman diagrams .",
    "then we applied all the tools we found to the study of two - loop calculations of the @xmath1 model and obtained the consistent results for @xmath2-function of the coupling constant and mass parameter .",
    "finally , we gave the general procedure of the application of the lore method to the higher - loop calculations , even beyond two - loop order .",
    "in the present paper , we will focus on one of the important remaining problems how to deal with the tensor - type integrals at higher - loop order .",
    "recall that at one - loop order in lore tensor - type ilis and scalar - type ilis can be related by introducing consistency conditions , which relate these type of integrals with the same divergent behavior .",
    "so the immediate question is whether these consistent conditions , which should be applied to the 1-folded ilis of each loop momentum variable , is still consistent with the general features we find in our previous paper . in particular , we want to ask whether the consistent conditions can guarantee the cancellation of various harmful divergences .",
    "another question involves the gauge invariance which is ensured by the consistency conditions in lore as shown in wu1,wu2 .",
    "thus , it is necessary to inquire whether the consistency conditions can still preserve gauge invariance and the associated ward identities . in order to study these questions",
    ", we use the massless quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) as our simplest example , which involves the tensor - type integrals and the gauge invariance at the same time .",
    "specifically , we shall calculate the two - loop photon vacuum polarization diagrams in detail . as will be shown in the following calculation , the lore method , with the prescription of consistency conditions , can give the sensible results which satisfy all the requirements : gauge invariance and locality .",
    "we should emphasize that the result above only requires the use of consistency conditions found at one - loop order and does not need to introduce additional two - loop order consistency conditions .",
    "one special feature worth mentioning is the appearance of a new divergence structure : each two - loop feynman diagram contains a quadratically harmful divergence even when we combine the result with the corresponding one - loop counterterm insertion diagrams .",
    "these new divergence structure is expected and compatible with the usual power counting for each diagrams .",
    "however , these quadratically harmful divergences will cancel with each other when we sum up all three group of diagrams in this order , rending the final result local . another way to see this cancellation",
    "can be obtained from the requirement of gauge invariance of the final result since these quadratically harmful divergences break the gauge invariance and must disappear in the final result .",
    "we argue that this is a general feature for gauge theories , since quadratic divergences would in general give the photon a mass , which is incompatible with gauge invariance .",
    "the appearance of this new divergence structure explicitly shows one of the main advantage of lore method that the lore method enables us to calculate the full result for any feynman diagram , especially the quadratic divergences , which is absent in many other regularization methods , like the popular dimensional regularization ( dr ) . in the light of detailed and complete calculations ,",
    "we conclude that the lore method can properly regularize tensor - type high - loop integrals ( at least up to two - loop ) and consistently apply to general gauge theories , like the standard model ( sm ) of particle physics .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section 2 gives a short introduction to the lore method . in section 3 ,",
    "we first compute all of the one - loop one - particle - irreducible diagrams that need to be regulated , in order to set our notations . then we present the results of the massless qed vacuum polarization at two - loop order by using the lore method , leaving the many of the details to the appendix b and c. appendix a contains some useful formulae in the lore method .",
    "appendix d contributes to the detailed calculation of a new doubly - logarithmic divergent integral encountered in our two - loop calculations .",
    "in this section , we give a brief introduction to the loop regularization ( lore ) .",
    "a more detailed discussion will be found in the seminal paper by one of the authors @xcite .",
    "it has been shown in@xcite that all one loop feynman integrals can be reduced into the following 1-fold ilis by using the standard feynman parameterization method : @xmath3with @xmath4 and @xmath5 corresponding to the quadratic and logarithmic divergent integrals . here",
    "the effective mass factor @xmath6 is a function of the external momenta @xmath7 , the masses of particles @xmath8 and the feynman parameters .    when the regularized 1-fold ilis satisfy the following consistency conditions@xcite : @xmath9 the resulting loop corrections are gauge invariant . here",
    "the superscript `` r '' denotes the regularized ilis .",
    "note that the introduction of the irreducible loop integrals ( ilis ) is crucial in the loop regularization@xcite , and it has been shown that all feynman loop integrals can be expressed in terms of the ilis . in the definition of ilis ,",
    "one important feature is that there should be no factor of @xmath10 in the numerator of loop integration and all the ilis can be classified into the scalar type ilis with the following loop integrand    @xmath11    and the tensor type ilis with the following loop integration    @xmath12    in manipulating the feynman loop integrals into ilis , one should always perform the dirac algebra and lorentz index - contraction first to obtain the ilis defined by the above `` simplest '' forms for the one loop case . for example , the integrand @xmath13should not be written as @xmath14instead it should be expressed as @xmath15and then rewrite the @xmath10 in the numerator in the form @xmath16 so as to cancel out the first term by the denominator to get , @xmath17    a simple regularization prescription for the ilis was realized to yield the above consistency conditions .",
    "the procedure is : rotating to the four dimensional euclidean space of momentum , replacing the loop integrating variable @xmath10 and the loop integrating measure @xmath18 in the ilis by the corresponding regularized ones @xmath19_{l}$ ] and @xmath20_{l}$ ] : @xmath21_{l}\\equiv k^{2}+m_{l}^{2}\\ ,   \\notag \\\\ & & \\int { d^{4}k}\\rightarrow \\int [ d^{4}k]_{l}\\equiv \\lim_{n , m_{l}^{2}}\\sum_{l=0}^{n}c_{l}^{n}\\int { d^{4}k}\\end{aligned}\\]]where @xmath22 ( @xmath23 ) may be regarded as the regulator masses for the ilis .",
    "the regularized ilis in the euclidean space - time are then given by : @xmath24where the coefficients @xmath25 are chosen to satisfy the following conditions : @xmath26with the notation @xmath27 denoting the limit @xmath28 .",
    "one may take the initial conditions @xmath29 and @xmath30 to recover the original integrals in the limit @xmath31 ( @xmath32 ) .",
    "such a new regularization is called as loop regularization ( lore ) @xcite .",
    "the prescription in lore method is very similar to pauli - villars prescription , but two concepts are totally different as the prescription in the loop regularization is acting on the ilis rather than on the propagators as in pauli - villars scheme .",
    "this is why the pauli - villars regularization violates non - abelian gauge symmetry , while lore method can preserve non - abelian gauge symmetry .",
    "a simple solution of eq . ( [ cl conditions ] ) , is to take the string - mode regulators , @xmath33with @xmath32 , and the coefficients @xmath25 to be of the form , @xmath34here @xmath35 may be regarded as a basic mass scale of loop regulator .",
    "it has been shown in @xcite that the above regularization prescription can be understood in terms of schwinger proper time formulation with an appropriate regulating distribution function .    with the string - mode regulators for @xmath22 and @xmath25 in above equations , the regularized ilis @xmath36 and @xmath37 can be calculated to give@xcite : @xmath38\\ }   \\notag \\label{re } \\\\",

    "this transforms the feynman integral @xmath92 into the @xmath93like integrals ( we have already combine two factors in eq.([1-loop se ] ) with uvdp parameter @xmath94 ) .",

    "the resulting formula appears less symmetric in the uvdp variables than that with the general formulae in ref.@xcite .",
    "however , this traditional method is more flexible and more natural in practice when the numerator is a complicated function of internal and external momenta like the present case , rather than a constant for the scalar integrals . in the following calculation of fig .",

    ", we can reach our final result of photon vacuum polarization diagrams at two loop order : @xmath145where @xmath146 is the fine structure constant .    in the light of our result , we have a few comments :    1 .",
    "as we have already seen , the quadratic divergences are canceled , and this is crucial to guarantee that photon does not obtain a mass from quantum fluctuation and that the whole theory remains gauge invariance .",
    "the harmful divergences like @xmath147 and @xmath148 vanishes also , which is expected as these terms are nonlocal and can not be eliminated by any counterterms in the original lagrangian which are local .",
    "especially , the quadratic harmful divergence shows a new divergent structure , which can be expected  from simple power counting in each of these diagrams .",
    "the nontrivial thing is that for every diagram this term will persist even when we include the corresponding counterterm insertion diagrams which only cancel the logarithmically harmful divergence .",
    "only when we sum over all the relevant diagrams do the quadratic harmful divergences cancel each other , rendering the final result local.moreover , as emphasized in the previous subsections , this feature is also expected from gauge invariance and the ward identity in qed . note that this quadratically harmful divergence is only proportional to @xmath149 and can give the photon a mass term , both of which are forbidden by the gauge invariance .",
    "we think this is a manifestation of the general phenomenon in gauge theories like qcd that although each diagram contains the gauge - violating quadratic divergences , but in the sum of all the relevant diagrams they cancel .",
    "the only difference is that this phenomenon occurs at two - loop order for qed while for qcd it happens at one - loop level already@xcite .",
    "it seems that it is the gauge invariance that rescues us from the harmful divergence disaster .",
    "3 .   we can compare our calculation with the lore method with those using the dimensional regularization ( dr ) . in the calculation with dr",
    "we can not see such cancellation of quadratic harmful divergences because in dr , the final result comes from expansion around the actual space - time dimension 4 and in such a expansion only the logarithmic divergences can be preserved while the quadratic or more higher divergences are simply omitted .",
    "it is the resulting incomplete expression in dr that makes this new divergence structure and its elimination invisible .",
    "however , since lore enables us to calculate the full results in the exactly four dimensions , we can easily overcome this problem faced by dr , allowing the appearance of this nontrivial divergence structure .",
    "4 .   the final result eq.([final ] )",
    "is transverse , which implies that our calculation respects gauge invariance and the corresponding ward identity .",
    "therefore , the final divergence can be canceled by a single two - loop local counterterm for photon vacuum polarization .",
    "5 .   our result agrees with other authors results @xcite .",
    "therefore we come to our conclusion : lore method , together with the prescription of consistency conditions , can be safely applied to general gauge theories , like qed , at least , up to two - loop order .",
    "in this paper , we mainly discuss the problem how to deal with the general tensor - type high - loop integrals in the framework of lore .",
    "we show that lore , together with its consistency conditions for 1-folded ilis , are enough to regularize the tensor - type integrals properly and can be consistently applied to the general gauge theories . in order to show this conclusion , we use the two - loop massless qed vacuum polarization as the simplest gauge theory example to show the general procedure .",
    "the final result is sensible : the two - loop correction is transverse and the harmful divergences and quadratic divergences are naturally canceled , which are required by the locality and the gauge invariance and its associated ward identity of the underlying qed .",
    "consequently , our result agrees with other authors well - established one .",
    "therefore , the computation of massless qed vacuum polarization at two - loop order explicitly shows lore is consistent with the gauge invariance and give us confidence to apply it to other realistic theories , like the standard model in particle physics .",
    "what we want to emphasize is that from our present calculation , we have shown a new divergence structure : either the self - energy insertion diagram @xmath105 and @xmath86 or the vertex correction insertion diagram @xmath112 may contain gauge non - invariant quadratically harmful divergent term even when combined with their own one - loop counterterm diagrams .",
    "however , only when we sum over all diagrams in this order the harmful divergences cancel and the final result recovers the gauge invariance and locality .",
    "we argue that this feature is general for gauge theories , because the quadratic divergences which violate the gauge invariance will give the gauge boson mass and should be absent in the physical gauge invariant results . furthermore , the reason why lore method , rather than other regularization methods like dimensional regularization , can show this new divergence structure lies in the fact that lore enables us to calculate the complete expression for any feynman diagram , especially including the quadratic divergences , which is one of main advantages of lore .",
