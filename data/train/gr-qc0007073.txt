    "it is now well known that sufficiently compact stars ( polytropic or uniform density ) can support the internal trapping of null geodesics and the `` w - modes '' found by chandrasekhar and ferrari ( 1991)@xcite , @xcite .",
    "these modes exist both for axial and polar perturbations , though the axial ones have been studied more thoroughly .",
    "the w - modes in general have no newtonian counterparts@xcite since they are predominantly modes of the spacetime . in the polar case they couple weakly to the fluid while in the axial case there is no coupling at all .",
    "recent numerical studies of these w - modes have involved the effect of the equation of state @xcite and their excitation @xcite,@xcite . whereas the role that these w - modes may play in real astrophysical processes remains open to much further investigation ,",
    "it is fair to say that little is actually known about the behavior of the governing potential of the wave equation in exact solutions of einstein s equations .",
    "such knowledge is important since it is both a route to the physical understanding of relativistic phenomena and a check on numerical procedures .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to explore necessary conditions for the internal trapping of null geodesics and the existence of w - modes ( when the centrifugal part of the potential dominates ) in physically acceptable exact isolated static spherically symmetric perfect fluid solutions of einstein s equations .",
    "we are able to exhibit physically acceptable exact solutions which have trapping and which could support w - modes .",
    "any metric is an  exact \" solution to einstein s equations .",
    "however , the consequent energy - momentum tensor is almost never of any interest",
    ". what is of interest are solutions which might have some contact with reality .",
    "recently @xcite a collection of exact isolated static spherically symmetric perfect fluid solutions have been subjected to the following elementary criteria for physical acceptability :    * isotropy of the pressure ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "* regularity of the origin by way of the scalars polynomial in the riemann tensor @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "* positive definiteness of both @xmath2 and energy density ( @xmath3 ) at the origin . *",
    "isolation by way of the requirement that the pressure reduce to zero at some finite boundary radius @xmath4 .",
    "* monotonicity of both @xmath2 and @xmath3 to the boundary . * subluminal adiabatic sound speed ( @xmath5 ) @xcite .    perhaps not surprisingly , only about 10 % of the solutions pass these elementary tests . in what follows",
    "we take the view that solutions worthy of further consideration must pass all the applicable tests in at least some region @xcite .",
    "we also take the view that an analytic solution of einstein s equations can be expected to approximate only a region of a realistic configuration .",
    "that is , an analytic solution could have an interior causal limit ( @xmath6 ) , a circumstance which precludes standard stability arguments @xcite , and yet provide an adequate approximation for a region of a realistic configuration .",
    "we begin by setting the notation .",
    "the line element in conventional form is ( e.g. , @xcite ) @xcite @xmath7 with the coordinates comoving in the sense that the fluid streamlines are given by @xmath8 . in terms of the functions @xmath9 and @xmath10 the regularity conditions reduce to @xmath11 with @xmath12 and @xmath13 a constant fixed by the scale of @xmath14 .",
    "next , in terms of the perfect fluid decomposition ( @xmath15 ) , solving for @xmath16 from the @xmath17-component of the conservation equations and einstein s equations ( @xmath18 and @xmath19 ) we obtain the tolman @xcite -oppenheimer - volkoff @xcite ( tov ) equation @xmath20 where , from the @xmath14 component of the einstein equations ( @xmath21 ) , @xmath22 from the tov equation ( here taken to be the right hand members of ( [ tov ] ) ) we observe that @xmath23 is maximal at @xmath24 . moreover , if there is an equation of state ( @xmath25 ) then either @xmath3 is maximal wrt @xmath17 at @xmath24 or @xmath2 is maximal wrt @xmath3 at @xmath24 . despite that fact that the tov equation has been known for over sixty years , only recently @xcite has its mathematical structure been fully appreciated .",
    "for example , we now know that for @xmath26 there exists a unique global solution for every @xmath27 .",
    "it is not difficult to find  solutions \" of the tov equation .",
    "for example , @xmath10 can be chosen in such a way that ( [ tov ] ) yields a solution ( with @xmath28 following from ( [ rho ] ) ) .",
    "the simplest choice is clearly @xmath29 but this leads us back to the schwarzschild interior solution .",
    "the metric ( [ standard ] ) contains two functions , @xmath10 and @xmath9 , related by ( [ tov ] ) .",
    "the first represents the gravitational energy ( effective gravitational mass ) ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the second is , in the weak field limit @xmath30 , the newtonian potential .",
    "this interpretation offers no insight into the meaning of @xmath9 within einstein s theory , and is a good point to begin our discussion .",
    "we start with the  centrifugal \" part of the potential @xcite for non - radial odd parity perturbations .",
    "this governs the evolution of null geodesics .",
    "radial null geodesics of the metric ( [ standard ] ) satisfy @xmath31 with @xmath32 , @xmath33 , and _",
    "d _ constant .",
    "non - radial null geodesics satisfy @xmath34 ( by choice ) ,    [ allequations ] @xmath35 @xmath36 and @xmath37 with @xmath38    where @xmath39 for affine @xmath40 , and @xmath41 is a constant @xmath42 , the  impact parameter \" .",
    "potential \" impact parameter @xmath43 provides , by way of ( [ nrd ] ) , an invariant physical interpretation of @xmath9 .",
    "null geodesics are restricted by the condition @xmath44 @xcite .    from conditions ( [ reg ] ) and the definition ( [ nrd ] ) it follows that @xmath45 as @xmath46 where @xmath47 is a physically irrelevant scale factor .",
    "( the ratio @xmath48 is invariant to scale changes in @xmath14 . )",
    "it follows that the necessary and sufficient condition for the internal trapping of null geodesics ( that is the existence of @xmath49 such that @xmath50 and @xmath51 at @xmath49 ) is given by    [ allequations ] @xmath52 or , from ( [ tov ] ) , @xmath53 which , with an equation of state ( @xmath25 ) can be given as @xmath54    from ( [ trapa ] ) and the tov equation it follows that @xmath55 a relation which makes the trapping of null geodesics a manifestly relativistic phenomenon @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the odd parity ( axial ) w - modes are non - radial perturbations of the spacetime which do not couple to the fluid at all . in terms of the frequency @xmath56 and mode number @xmath57 the governing equation is given by @xcite @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the  tortoise \" coordinate @xmath60 the potential is conveniently expressed in terms of @xmath17 and is given by @xmath61 a necessary condition for the occurrence of resonance scattering of axial gravitational waves by an isolated distribution of fluid is a local minimum in @xmath62 within the boundary of the fluid .",
    "( if the centrifugal part of the potential ( @xmath63 ) dominates , which is frequently but not always the case ( see below ) , then ( [ tov1 ] ) provides such a condition . )",
    "it is the purpose of this paper to explore the occurences of this minimum in physically acceptable exact solutions .",
    "it is the shape of the function @xmath62 which is of interest , and since the exterior vacuum has a well known local maximum at @xmath64 ( for @xmath65 ) , the boundary conditions associated with the fluid - vacuum interface need careful attention .",
    "the darmois - israel junction conditions demand the continuity of the first and second fundamental forms at a boundary surface .",
    "these conditions are well known ( e.g. , @xcite ) but are usefully reviewed here .",
    "we take the  interior \" metric to be of the form ( [ standard ] ) .",
    "the  exterior \" is the familiar schwarzschild vacuum ( in coordinates ( @xmath66 ) ) : @xmath67 at the fluid interface ( @xmath68 ) , without loss in generality , we take @xmath32 and @xmath33 continuous ( with intrinsic coordinates @xmath69 , where @xmath70 is the proper time ) .",
    "this gives @xmath71 the continuity of the first fundamental form is completed by requiring that the particle trajectories at the boundary be timelike .",
    "the continuity of the angular components of the second fundamental form ( extrinsic curvature ) give @xmath72 and the continuity of the remaining ( @xmath70 - @xmath70 ) component gives @xmath73 which , with the tov equation , gives @xmath74 to summarize , a static spherically symmetric fluid is matched to a vacuum exterior subject to ( and only to ) ( [ thetaphi ] ) , ( [ mass ] ) and ( [ pressure ] ) .",
    "further restrictions are frequently imposed . in particular ,",
    "if the coordinates are assumed admissible ( the metric and first derivatives assumed continuous across @xmath68 ) then @xmath75 and @xmath76 whereas ( [ admis1 ] ) can be achieved by a simple change in scale ( of @xmath14 or @xmath77 ) , in general , ( [ density ] ) does not hold @xcite .",
    "condition ( [ admis1 ] ) is the necessary and sufficient condition for @xmath78 to be continuous and continuously differentiable at @xmath68 .",
    "similarly , a simple change in scale makes @xmath79 continuous but not continuously differentiable at @xmath68 . the wave equation ( [ wave ] ) is of course invariant to these changes in scale . in summary",
    ", @xmath78 can be taken to be continuous and continuously differentiable at @xmath68 , and @xmath79 can be taken to be continuous@xcite .",
    "since the uniform density static sphere satisfies ( [ tov1 ] ) , one might guess that all static solutions do .",
    "this is not the case .",
    "for example , the buchdahl @xcite solution does not allow a region which satisfies ( [ tov1 ] ) .",
    "in contrast , the tolman vii solution does @xcite .",
    "( these are useful exact solutions for the study of the equation of state of neutron stars @xcite ) . in what follows",
    "we demonstrate a number of physically acceptable solutions which do satisfy ( [ tov1 ] ) .",
    "we organize the examples by way of their motivating ansatz .",
    "the finch - skea solution @xcite is an exact solution which gives reasonable values for the central densities of neutron stars .",
    "the solution derives from the ansatz @xmath80 where @xmath81 is a constant .",
    "the line element can be given in the form @xmath82 where @xmath83 , @xmath84 and @xmath85 and @xmath86 are constants .",
    "clearly @xmath87 can be set by the scale of @xmath14 leaving ( say ) @xmath81 and @xmath88 as parameters .",
    "the latter is conveniently given by @xmath89 where @xmath90 , or equivalently , in terms of the tenuity @xmath91 , @xmath92 the physical restrictions 3 and 6 give , respectively , the following lower and upper bounds to @xmath93 @xcite @xmath94 but the limits which follow from @xmath78 and @xmath79 are more transparently expressed in terms of @xmath95 .",
    "up to an irrelevant scale factor , the potential impact parameter follows immediately as , @xmath96 we find that @xmath78 has a local minimum for @xmath97 and a local maximum with subluminal sound speed between the local maximum and minimum for @xmath98 .",

    "the finch - skea solution therefore offers an example of a causal exact solution with trapping @xcite .",
    "a class of models , some of which satisfy conditions 1 through 6 , starts with the ansatz @xmath104 where @xmath105 and @xmath106 are constants and @xmath107 is an integer @xmath108 .",
    "the case @xmath109 is known as tolman iv solution @xcite .",

    "this condition is not always satisfied .",
    "for example , it is not satisfied in the buchdahl @xcite solution .",
    "we have demonstrated some physically acceptable exact solutions for which the condition is satisfied .",
    "one , the finch - skea solution , offers an example of a complete causal exact solution with trapping . at the very least , these examples can provide a check on numerical procedures which attempt to gauge the role that w - modes may play in real astrophysical processes . in every case",
