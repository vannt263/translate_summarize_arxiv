    "goodness - of - fit ( gof ) tests are designed to measure the compatibility of a random sample with a theoretical probability distribution function ( pdf ) .",
    "the null hypothesis @xmath1 is that the sample follows the pdf . under the assumption that h@xmath2 applies ,",
    "the fraction of wrongly rejected experiments - the probability of committing an error of the first kind - is fixed to typically a few percent .",
    "a test is considered powerful if the probability of accepting @xmath1 when @xmath1 is wrong - the probability of committing an error of the second kind - is low .",
    "of course , without specifying the alternatives , the power can not be quantified .",
    "a discrepancy between a data sample and the theoretical description can be of different origin .",
    "the problem may be in the theory which is wrong or the sample may be biased by measurement errors or by background contamination . in natural sciences we mainly have the latter situation .",
    "even though the statistical description is the same in both cases the choice of the specific test may be different . in our applications",
    "we are mainly confronted with `` slowly varying '' deviations between data and theoretical description whereas in other fields where for example time series are investigated , `` high frequency '' distortions are more likely .",
    "goodness - of - fit tests are based on classical statistical methods and are closely related to classical interval estimation , but they contain also bayesian elements .",
    "those , however , are only related with some prejudice on the alternative hypothesis which affects the purity of the accepted decisions and not the error of the first kind .    the power of one dimensional tests is not always invariant against transformations of the variates . in more than one dimension ( number of variates ) , an invariant description is not possible .",
    "tests are classified in distribution dependent and distribution free tests .",
    "the former are adapted to special pdfs like gaussian , exponential or uniform distributions .",
    "we will restrict our discussion mainly to distribution free tests and tests which can be adapted to arbitrary distributions . here",
    "we distinguish tests applied to binned data and binning free tests .",
    "the latter are in principle preferable but so far they are almost exclusively limited to one dimensional distributions .",
    "a further distinction concerns the alternative hypothesis .",
    "usually , it is not restricted but there exist also tests where it is parametrized .",
    "physicists tend to be content with @xmath0 tests which are not necessarily optimum in all cases .",
    "a very useful and comprehensive survey of goodness - of - fit tests can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite from 1986 .",
    "since then , some new developments have occurred and the increase in computing power has opened the possibility to apply more elaborate tests .    in section 2 we summarize the most important tests . to keep this article short we do not discuss  tests based on the order statistic and spacing tests . in section 3",
    "we introduce two new tests , the three region test and the energy test .",
    "to compare the tests we apply them in section 4 to some specific alternative hypotheses .",
    "we do not consider explicitly composite hypotheses .",
    "the @xmath3 test is closely connected to least square fits with the difference that the hypothesis is fixed .",
    "the test statistic is @xmath4 with the random variable @xmath5 , @xmath6 the expectation @xmath7 and @xmath8 the expectation @xmath9 .",
    "obviously the expectation value of @xmath10 is @xmath11 in the gaussian approximation @xmath5 follows a gaussian with mean @xmath6 and variance @xmath12 and the test statistic follows a @xmath3 distribution function @xmath13 with @xmath14 degrees of freedom .",
    "the probability of an error of the first kind @xmath15 ( significance level , p - value ) defines @xmath16 with @xmath17 .",
    "the null hypothesis is rejected if in an actual experiment we find @xmath18 .",
    "we obtain the pearson test when the random variables @xmath19 are poisson distributed .",
    "@xmath20    in the large sample limit",
    "the test statistic @xmath0 has approximately a @xmath0 distribution with @xmath14 degrees of freedom .",
    "when we have a histogram , where a total of @xmath21 events are distributed according to a multinomial distribution among the @xmath14 bins with probabilities @xmath22 we get @xmath23 which again follows asymptotically a @xmath0 distribution , this time with @xmath24 degrees of freedom .",
    "the reduced number of degrees of freedom is due to the constraint @xmath25 .",
    "nowadays , the distribution function of the test statistic can be computed numerically without much effort .",
    "the @xmath3 test then can also be applied to small samples .",
    "the gaussian approximation is no longer required .",
    "the @xmath0 test is very simple and needs only limited computational power . a big advantage compared to most of the other methods",
    "is that is can be applied to multidimensional histograms .",
    "there are however also serious drawbacks :    * its power in detecting slowly varying deviations of a histogram from predictions is rather poor due to the neglect of possible correlations between adjacent bins .",
    "* binning is required and the choice of the binning is arbitrary .",
    "* when the statistics is low or the number of dimensions is high , the event numbers per bin may be low .",
    "then the asymptotic properties are no longer valid and systematic deviations are hidden by statistical fluctuations",
    ".    there are proposals to fix the bin widths by the requirement of equal number of expected entries per bin .",
    "this is not necessarily the optimum choice @xcite .",
    "often there are outliers in regions where no events are expected which would be hidden in wide bins .    for the number of bins a dependence on the sample size @xmath26@xmath27",
    "is proposed in ref .",
    "our experience is that in most experiments the number of bins is chosen too high .",
    "the sensitivity to slowly varying deviations roughly goes with @xmath28 @xcite . in multidimensional cases",
    "the power of the test often can be increased by applying it to the marginal distributions .",
    "there is a whole class of @xmath0 like tests .",
    "many studies can be found in the literature .",

    "@xcite .",
    "supposing that a random sample of size @xmath26 is given , we form the order statistic @xmath29 .",
    "we consider the empirical distribution function ( edf ) @xmath30 or    @xmath31    @xmath32 is a step function which is to be compared to the distribution @xmath33 corresponding to @xmath34 .        the edf is consistent and unbiased .",
    "the tests discussed in this section are invariant under transformation of the random variable .",
    "because of this feature , we can transform the distribution to the uniform distribution and restrict our discussion to the latter .      the probability integral transformation ( pit ) @xmath35 transforms a general pdf @xmath36 of @xmath37 into the uniform distribution @xmath38 of @xmath39 .",
    "@xmath40 the underlying idea of this transformation is that the new edf of @xmath39 , @xmath41 is extremely simple and that it conserves the distribution of the test quantities discussed in this section .",
    "it is easily seen that    @xmath42    note , however , that the pit does not necessarily conserve all interesting features of the gof problem .",
    "resolution effects are washed out and for example in a lifetime distribution , an excess of events at small and large lifetimes may be judged differently but are treated similarly after a pit .",
    "it is not logical to select specific gofs for specific applications but to transform all kinds of pdfs to the same uniform distribution .",
    "the pit is very useful because it permits standardization but one has to be aware of its limitations .      the maximum positive ( negative ) deviation of @xmath32 from @xmath43 @xmath44 ( @xmath45 ) ( see fig",

    "we have designed a test which subdivides the variable space into three pieces , containing @xmath74 events , such that the deviation between data and prediction from @xmath1 is maximum .",

    "we have chosen weights equal to one .",
    "of course the test can be generalized to a higher number of subregions .",
    "let us assume that we have a continuous charge distribution @xmath80 of positive electric charges and a sample of negative point charges with total charge equal to minus the integrated positive charge .",
    "the potential energy is minimum when the negative point charges follow @xmath81 .",
    "then , up to effects due to the discrete nature of the point charges , the charge density is zero everywhere .",
    "any displacement of charges would increase the energy .",
    "we use this property to construct a binning free test procedure .",
    "we simulate the theoretical distribution by @xmath82 charges of charge @xmath83 each .",

    "* remark * : the minimum energy requirement for the equality of experimental and theoretical distribution is strictly correct only when the number @xmath82 of simulation charges is equal to the number @xmath26 of experimental charges . for the general case with a continuous theoretical distribution or simulation sample and experimental sample of different size , the optimum agreement of the two distributions is not well defined and there is a slight dependence of the minimum energy configuration on the correlation function .",
    "this is however a purely academic problem , the test statistic @xmath91 remains a powerful indicator for an incompatibility of the experimental sample with @xmath92 .",
    "we note that the minimum energy configuration does not depend on the application of the one - over - distance power law of electrostatics .",

    "very small distances , however , should not be weighted too strongly since distortions with sharp peaks are not expected and usually inhibited by the finite experimental resolution .",
