    "recently ( r@xmath1nyi ) entanglement entropy has become a center of wide interest in a broad array of theoretical physics such as string theory , condensed matter physics and quantum information theory .",
    "it is useful tool when we investigate the distinctive features of various quantum states .",
    "for example , it provides us with the method of classifying the quantum structure of several states in condensed matter physics , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "the quantum entanglement is expected to be an important quantity which may shed light on the mechanism behind the ads / cft correspondence , e.g.,@xcite . in particular , the entanglement on the boundary is expected to be related to gravity in bulk e.g. , @xcite . therefore , it is important to reveal the fundamental properties of ( r@xmath1nyi ) entanglement entropy .",
    "its remarkable feature has been found through researches @xcite over the past a few years .",
    "a state is excited perturbatively so that the energy of its excitation is much smaller than the inverse of the subsystem s size .",
    "if the size of a subsystem is small , its entanglement entropy is proportional to the energy included in it . thus its entanglement entropy obeys the law analogous to the first law of thermodynamics . in relativistic setup ,",
    "its effective temperature is proportional to the inverse of the subsystem s size . and",
    "that temperature does not depend on the parameters of strongly coupled gauge theories in large @xmath2 limit .",
    "in other words , it is universal in strongly coupled gauge theories in this limit .    in those works , we studied the property of the entanglement entropy when the size of the subsystem is very small . in this paper and previous one @xcite , we study the property of ( r@xmath1nyi ) entanglement entropy when its size is infinite .",
    "moreover we define the excited state by acting various local operators on the ground state .",
    "( r@xmath1nyi ) entanglement entropies for them show nontrivial time evolution .",
    "their excess finally approach certain finite values . before we explain how to compute them and explain the results which we obtain",
    ", we would like to explain quantum quenches briefly .",
    "there are two classes of quenches ; global quenches and local quenches .",
    "the global quenches are triggered by changing parameters homogeneously , e.g. , @xcite . when parameters are changed homogeneously , we are able to study the thermalization of a subsystem and its thermalization time by measuring its entanglement entropy .",
    "their holographic duals are the formation of a black hole , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "the local quenches are triggered by adding an interaction locally to a hamiltonian or changing parameters locally in the hamiltonian @xcite .",
    "when parameters are changed inhomogeneously , we can investigate the time evolution of the entanglement entropy locally .",
    "a falling particle in ads spacetime is proposed as the holographic duals of these quenches , e.g. , @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we introduce a new class of excited states .",
    "these states are defined by acting a local operator on the ground state .",
    "this local operator violates the time translational invariance and excites the ground state . in this setup",
    ", we can study the time evolution of ( r@xmath1nyi ) entanglement entropies for these states .",
    "therefore we can investigate how the entanglement propagates locally .",
    "we would like to briefly explain how to compute the ( r@xmath1nyi ) entanglement entropies for these states and give an explanation of the results we obtain . in this work ,",
    "we compute them in the free massless scalar field theory by the replica method . here",
    "we choose the subsystem a to be a half of the total space .",
    "we define a locally excited state by acting a local operator @xmath3 on the ground state .",
    "we compute the ( r@xmath1nyi ) entanglement entropies for these states by using the replica method . after computing them ,",
    "we perform an analytic continuation to real time and study their time evolution .",
    "we find they finally approach certain finite constants .",
    "the time evolution of the ( r@xmath1nyi ) entanglement entropies for locally excited states can be interpreted in terms of the relativistic propagation of entangled pairs .    in previous paper @xcite , we derived the ( r@xmath1nyi ) entanglement entropies at late time for the state which is excited by @xmath3 from the entangled pair interpretation .",
    "we call the final values of ( r@xmath1nyi ) entanglement entropies ( _ r_@xmath1_nyi _ ) _ entanglement entropies of operators_. they include the ( r@xmath1nyi ) entanglement entropy for an epr state .",
    "they measure the degrees of freedom of local operators and characterize them in conformal field theories in the viewpoint of quantum entanglement .",
    "finally we would like to summarize the new results we obtain in the present work . in previous paper @xcite",
    ", we found that the ( r@xmath1nyi ) entanglement entropies of @xmath3 is given by those of binomial distribution only when the replica number and @xmath4 is small .",
    "in present paper , we provide the explanation which shows that the ( r@xmath1nyi ) entanglement entropies of @xmath3 are given by those of binomial distribution by using the replica method .",
    "the results which we obtain by using replica method agree with those which we obtain in terms of the entangled pair .",
    "we also obtain the sum rule for the ( r@xmath1nyi ) entanglement entropies for the states defined by acting the various operators on the ground state .",
    "they are given by the sum of the ( r@xmath1nyi ) entanglement entropies for the states defined by acting one of these operators on the ground state .",
    "moreover we argue that they can be generalized .",
    "we limit operators to the operators @xmath5 which are composed of single - species operator .",
    "the ( r@xmath1nyi ) entanglement entropies of them are given by those of binomial distribution .",
    "the entropies of general operators obey the same sum rule as the one which we mentioned above .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section @xmath6 , we compute the ( r@xmath1nyi ) entanglement entropies for the states defined by acting various local operators on the ground state in the replica method .",
    "we also compute the green function on the space which has a conical singularity .",
    "we explain an analytic continuation which is useful to investigate the time evolution of those entropies for excited states . in section @xmath7 , we calculate ( r@xmath1nyi ) entanglement entropies for the states which excited by scalar operators and investigate their time evolution explicitly . in section @xmath8",
