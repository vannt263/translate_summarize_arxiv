    "stochastic rate processes in bi- or multi - stable systems lead to many interesting phenomena observed in various scientific areas ranging from physics to social science , and have thus been studied for a long time .    here",
    "we consider a network of stochastically driven bistable elements whose distinct feature is a time - delayed coupling .",
    "the time delays are considered as uniform and the network elements are assumed to be highly interconnected , so that the connectivity can be approximated by a global all to all coupling .",
    "the dynamics of the network is numerically explored by using a langevin model and analytically by using a gaussian approximation and a dichotomous model , derived from the corresponding fokker - planck equations and master equation , respectively .",
    "the langevin model consists of @xmath0 equations , each describing the overdamped motion of a particle in a bistable potential in the presence of noise and global coupling to a time - delayed mean field @xmath1 , @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the time delay , @xmath4 is the coupling strength of the feedback and @xmath5 denotes the variance of the gaussian fluctuations @xmath6 .",
    "in order to theoretically study the dynamical properties of a globally coupled set of noisy bistable elements ( with no time delay ) , desai and zwanzig @xcite derived a hierarchy of equations for the cumulant moments of the distribution function from the multi - dimensional fokker - planck equation for the joint probability distribution for all elements . for large noise intensities , when the statistics of individual elements are approximately gaussian , this hierarchy can be truncated . applying this approach to our system",
    "yields the following set of equations for the mean field @xmath7 and the variance @xmath8 ,",
    "to study the dynamics of a single bistable element with time - delayed feedback tsimring and pikovsky @xcite used a dichotomous approximation . in the dichotomous approximation intra - well fluctuations of @xmath9",
    "are neglected , so that a bistable element can be replaced by a discrete two - state system .",
    "applying this complementary approach to our system , allows us to express the mean field dynamics in terms of the hopping rates @xmath10 which denote the probability of a bistable element to change its state form @xmath11 to @xmath12 and vice versa , respectively .",
    "the equation for the mean field reads @xmath13 where the hopping probabilities are given by the kramers transition rate @xcite , which in the limit of small noise and small coupling strength reads ( cf .",

    "phase diagram of the langevin model ( crosses ) , the gaussian approximation ( dashed lines ) and the dichotomous theory ( solid lines ) .",
    "double lines indicate hysteretic transitions among phases.,width=200 ]    a numerical study of the langevin model ( eq . [ lang ] ) shows that the system undergoes ordering transitions and demonstrates multistability .",
    "that is , for a strong enough positive coupling the system exhibits a non - zero stationary mean field and a variety of stable oscillatory states are accessible for positive and negative feedback .",
    "while the transition to the non - zero stationary mean field is second order ( continuous ) , the type of the oscillatory transitions depends on the system parameters and can be first order ( discontinuous ) , associated with hysteretic behavior , or second order .    a linear stability analysis of eq .  ( [ xx1 ] )",
    "yields the critical coupling strengths @xmath15 and the frequencies @xmath16 of the accessible oscillatory states .",
    "it is found that the oscillation periods can be arbitrary small meaning that a separation of time scales of the macroscopic mean field dynamics and the microscopic hopping dynamics of the constituent bistable elements is not possible .",
    "a comparison of the langevin model with the gaussian approximation and the dichotomous theory shows that while near the transition points the system dynamics is strongly non - gaussian , it is in this regime well described by a two - state model ( see fig .",
    "[ phase ] ) , which allows for a complete analysis of the bifurcations of the trivial equilibrium .",
    "the normalized coherence @xmath17 of the oscillatory state at @xmath18 as a function of the noise strength d , for networks of different size @xmath0 as well as for the dichotomic theory .",
    "the coherence is given through @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the hight of the dominant spectral peak at @xmath21 and @xmath22 is the half - width of the peak.,width=222 ]      both , kramers random switching frequency @xmath23 ( see [ p1221 ] ) and the frequency of the oscillatory states @xmath16 , resulting from the coupling with the time - delayed mean field , depend on the noise strength , i.e. , @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "thus , the noise can be tuned so that the random hoping between the potential wells of the bistable oscillators is synchronized with the periodic modulation of the mean - field .",
    "this statistical synchronization takes place when @xmath26 , where the coherence of the oscillatory states becomes maximal .    for the @xmath27 case",
    "the coherence resonance was observed by @xcite .",
    "we observe that the resonance phenomenon not only persists in globally coupled networks with large @xmath0 , but is enhanced , a property which was found in other systems and is sometimes referred to as array - enhanced resonance @xcite ."
