    "noise is a central issue in the implementation of quantum computation using superconducting circuits @xcite .",

    "superconducting resonators , which are sensitive probes of bulk two - level system ( tls ) loss , are also useful for dispersive qubit readout using circuit qed @xcite , single artificial - atom lasing @xcite and single photon detection @xcite .",
    "experiments focusing on dielectric loss in superconducting resonators have previously employed a classical description of the resonator @xcite .",
    "however , many of these experiments involve low microwave - photon numbers and properly require a full quantum mechanical analysis for their interpretation @xcite .",
    "in this article we quantize the classical theory of loss due to two - level systems ( tlss ) to obtain the familiar jaynes - cummings model ( jcm ) of quantum optics @xcite .",
    "although the jcm has been studied thoroughly in both atomic and solid - state physics , to the best of our knowledge it has not been used to explore the loss regimes presented here @xcite , nor has it specifically been used to evaluate loss tangents .",

    "we neglect the fact that a resonator may interact with many tlss .",
    "working with this minimal model allows us to establish the dynamics of decay and to demarcate various parameter regimes .",
    "this model can serve as a starting point for studies of quantum mechanical loss in more complex systems .",
    "it also allows us to generate transparent analytic expressions for the resonator photon number , tls excitation and coherence , as well as system correlations , which are of interest not only in the context of resonator loss but also for control and manipulation of the full system @xcite .",
    "our analysis shows agreement between the quantum and classical theories for weak coupling between the resonator and the tls .",
    "however in the case of strong coupling , we find the quantum theory predicts a significantly lower loss than the classical theory when the tls is unsaturated . also , in contrast to the classical case , the photon number at which the loss saturates does not depend on the resonator - tls coupling .",

    "if the rabi drive due to the resonator could be held constant , we could obtain steady state solutions for the tls variables .",
    "however the drive depends on the number of resonator quanta , and thus itself changes with time .",
    "nonetheless , if the photon number changes slowly compared to the rate at which the tls relaxes to equilibrium , we can assume the drive to be quasistatic , evaluate the tls variables in the steady state , and then finally solve for the resonator dynamics .",

    "( [ eq : losststrongwet ] ) to eq .",
    "( [ eq : bigg ] ) we see that the pure dephasing plays opposite roles in the two cases : loss in the weak coupling case decreases with pure dephasing while it increases for strong coupling . in the saturated - regime",

    "moreover , the photon number at which tls saturation occurs is independent of the resonator - tls coupling in the strong coupling quantum theory , in complete contrast to the classical theory .",
    "the numerical and analytical results presented in this paper can be used as a starting point for including further parameters in the loss model in order to make it more realistic , such as an external drive for the resonator , intrinsic resonator loss , and reservoirs at non - zero temperature .",
    "in addition , we have in this work only considered the situation where the resonator is resonant with the tls .",

    "usually distributions in the variables of orientation @xmath138 , energy @xmath139 and tunneling barriers @xmath140 also need to be considered in order to reach agreement with experiment @xcite",
    ". clearly there can be several additional regimes of behavior of the quantum loss model , depending on the relative values of the parameters introduced .",
    "while working in the time domain serves to illustrate the dynamics clearly , working in the frequency domain can yield additional insights , and is relevant to some experiments ; such a project is envisioned for the future .",

    "<S> we perform a quantum mechanical analysis of superconducting resonators subject to dielectric loss arising from charged two - level systems . </S>",
    "<S> we present numerical and analytical descriptions of the dynamics of energy decay from the resonator within the jaynes - cummings model . </S>",
    "<S> our analysis allows us to distinguish the strong and weak coupling regimes of the model and to describe within each regime cases where the two - level system is unsaturated or saturated . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the quantum theory agrees with the classical model for weak coupling . </S>",
    "<S> however , for strong coupling the quantum theory predicts lower loss than the classical theory in the unsaturated regime . also , in contrast to the classical theory , the photon number at which saturation occurs in the strong coupling quantum theory is independent of the coupling between the resonator and the two - level system </S>"
