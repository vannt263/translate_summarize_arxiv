    "magnetic resonance ( mr ) spectroscopy , including nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr )  @xcite and electron paramagnetic resonance ( epr),@xcite has been widely used to probe local structural and dynamic properties of a wide range of systems . however , because the conventional mr spectrometer is based on the detection of microwave and radio - frequency photons , whose energies are small compared to photon energies detected in single molecule fluorescence ( fl ) spectroscopy , mr spectroscopy inherently has much lower sensitivity . with a current typical spectrometer setup ,",
    "@xmath0 electron spins and @xmath1 @xmath2h nuclear spins are required to obtain epr and nmr signals at room temperature , respectively .    a nitrogen - vacancy ( nv ) center is a paramagnetic color center in diamond with unique electronic , spin , and optical properties including its stable fl signals ,  @xcite long decoherence time ,  @xcite and capability to initialize the spin states of nv centers by applying optical excitation and to readout the states by measuring the fl intensity .",

    "figure  2a shows the pulse sequence used in the deer measurements,@xcite which was adopted from the field of epr.@xcite the deer sequence consists of the spin echo sequence for the nv center and an additional @xmath18-pulse at different microwave frequency ( denoted as mw2 ) . when the additional @xmath18-pulse is resonant with surrounding electron spins near the nv center , the magnetic moments of the surrounding spins are flipped , and this alters the magnetic dipole field experienced by the nv center from the surrounding spins during the second half of the spin echo sequence .",
    "the alteration causes a shift in the larmor frequency of the nv center , which leads to different phase accumulation of the larmor precession during the second half of the sequence from the first half . as a result ,",
    "the nv center suffers a phase shift in the echo signal and a reduction of fl intensity from the original spin echo signal is observed . as shown in fig .  2b , we monitored the spin echo intensity of the nv center at fixed @xmath36 ns as a function of the microwave frequency of mw2 ( @xmath37 ) , and observed clear intensity reductions at five frequencies ( 0.90 , 0.92 , 1.01 , 1.10 , and 1.12 ghz ) .",

    "the frequency of the mw2 pulse was set at 0.92 ghz . since @xmath6 was fixed , the oscillation we observed in the spin echo intensity of the nv center as a function of @xmath35 corresponds to the rabi oscillations of the n spins , which allowed us to choose the optimum pulse length of 90 ns for the @xmath18-pulse of the n peaks at 0.90 and 0.92 ghz .       where @xmath49 nm is the lattice constant of diamond .",

    "the deer peak at @xmath62 corresponds to the @xmath64 transition of n spins oriented in the @xmath8 $ ] direction .",
    "first step of the simulation was to generate a model configuration of the nv center and n spins in a diamond lattice , and this was done by placing the nv center at the origin of the diamond lattice and assigning the positions of n spins randomly in the lattice sites ( see fig .",
    "the concentration of n spins was chosen to be 20 parts per million ( ppm ) carbon atoms based on the measured @xmath17 of the nv center ( 1.2 @xmath3s as shown in fig .",
    "1d),@xcite and @xmath5818,000 n spins were placed in the simulated diamond lattice with a diameter of @xmath58200 nm .",
    "next , we randomly chose the orientation of n spins where only a quarter of n spins were assigned in the @xmath8 $ ] direction and the rest of n spins were assigned in the other three directions , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath65 $ ] , @xmath66 $ ] , and @xmath67 $ ] .",
    "we then assigned the nuclear spin value ( @xmath68 ) of either @xmath69 , @xmath70 , or @xmath11 to all n spins with equal probability .",
    "for the simulation of the deer signal of the nv center , we only considered the contribution coming from the n spins oriented in the @xmath8 $ ] direction with @xmath50 ( @xmath62 ghz in fig .",
    "thus , @xmath63 was computed from only @xmath71-th of all n spins in the simulated lattice on average ( @xmath581500 n spins ) .",
    "finally we assigned the electron spin value ( @xmath9 ) of either @xmath72 or @xmath73 with equal probability to the n spins .",
    "@xmath63 is given by the sum of individual dipolar field from each n spin as , @xmath74 where @xmath75 is the dipolar field strength of @xmath76-th n spin at the nv center , @xmath77 is the number of the n spins oriented in the @xmath8 $ ] direction with @xmath50 , @xmath78 is the vacuum permeability , @xmath79 and @xmath80 are the magnitude and polar angle of the vector that connects the nv center and @xmath76-th n spin , respectively , and @xmath81 is the electron spin value of @xmath76-th n spin .",
    "we then calculated the number of n spins ( @xmath82 ) out of @xmath77 to obtain more than 90@xmath61 of the @xmath63 by successively adding individual dipolar field term from each n spin in descending order of magnitude ( _ i.e. _ , when @xmath83 ) .",
    "the deer intensity ( @xmath84 ) is calculated by considering the change in the effective dipolar field before and after the @xmath18-pulse of the n spins that causes a shift in the precession frequency of the nv center as , @xmath85 where @xmath86 is the @xmath42-value of the nv center,@xcite @xmath87 is the planck constant , and @xmath36 ns is the fixed value used in the deer measurement ( see the inset of fig .",
    "it was assumed that @xmath18-flip of the n spins is instantaneous ( _ i.e. _ the effect of a finite width of the pulse was not considered ) . in addition , we took into account for the electron and nuclear spin relaxations of n spins during the deer measurement time ( @xmath58100 s with @xmath58@xmath30 averaging ) by statistically re - assigning the electron and nuclear spin values ( @xmath9 and @xmath68 ) according to the electron and nuclear longitudinal relaxation times ( @xmath88 and @xmath55 ) , respectively .",
    "although @xmath88 has been investigated previously ( @xmath88@xmath5810 ms),@xcite @xmath55 has not been reported before to the best of our knowledge . in the simulation",
    ", we used @xmath89 ms and considered @xmath55 to be 10 ms , 1 s and 100 s , therefore the assignment of @xmath68 happens @xmath90 times for @xmath53 s ( @xmath54 and 1 times for @xmath91 ms and 100 s , respectively ) and a total of @xmath54 iterations ( 100 s/@xmath88 ) occurs during the simulation .",
    "then what we finally computed were the average of @xmath54 values of @xmath82 and @xmath84 ( _ i.e. _ , @xmath92 and @xmath93 ) .",
    "in addition , in order to see the spatial configuration dependence on @xmath51 and @xmath52 , we repeated the procedure described above for @xmath54 spatial configurations and calculated @xmath54 values of @xmath51 and @xmath52 . moreover , including the effects of @xmath17 decay ( 1.2 @xmath3s as shown in fig .",
    "1d ) , the detected deer signal in @xmath28 is given as @xmath94 where we re - scale @xmath95 to the spin echo intensity without @xmath18-pulse and @xmath96 to @xmath97 .",
    "figure 3b - d shows the simulated result of @xmath51 as a function of the deer intensity in @xmath28 for @xmath53 s , 10 ms , and 100 s , respectively , from @xmath54 spatial configurations . as shown in fig .",
    "3b , the number of the n spin that contributes to the deer signal ( @xmath51 ) depends on the detected deer intensity .",
    "we first noted that , for all @xmath54 configurations we simulated , only a small portion ( @xmath9860 ) out of @xmath581500 n spins contributes to more than 90 @xmath61 of @xmath63 on average .",
    "for example , in the case of homogeneously distributed spins , 60 spins with 20 ppm concentration will be located within @xmath5870 nm diameter . when the deer intensity is large ( @xmath99 ) , @xmath51 is smaller because @xmath63 in such spatial configurations is only dominated by a smaller ensemble of the n spin located in the vicinity of the nv center .",
    "in addition , there was little observation of @xmath100 ( _ i.e. _ , @xmath101 because a small probability exists for the nv center to be coupled with a single or a few n spins and the resultant @xmath52 is a weighted sum of many oscillatory functions with different frequencies . on the other hand , when the deer intensity is small ( @xmath102 ) , @xmath51 is larger because the n spins in such spatial configurations spread uniformly and the n spins located farther away from the nv also contribute to @xmath63 .",
    "the experimentally observed deer intensity was @xmath103 ( see fig .",
    "the inset of fig .",
    "3b shows a histogram of the occurrence of @xmath51 from the simulation that yielded @xmath104 - 0.65 .",
    "the occurrence was in the range of 7 - 42 ( the mean of @xmath51 was 14 ) and 95@xmath61 of the occurrence was in 7 - 29 .",
    "as shown in fig .",
    "3c , there was little to no change in @xmath51 with @xmath91 ms ( the mean of @xmath51 was 15 spins and 95@xmath61 of the occurrence was in @xmath105 - 30 ) .",
    "on the other hand , in the case of @xmath51 with @xmath106 s , slightly broader distribution was observed due to no nuclear spin relaxation during the simulation .",
    "the mean of @xmath51 was 4 spins and 95@xmath61 of the occurrence was in 2 - 14 .",
    "therefore the detected n spins in the deer measurement was estimated to be a few tens of spins .",
    "in summary , we presented epr spectroscopy on a small ensemble of spins using a single nv center in diamond .",
    "we first identified a single nv center using fl and odmr spectroscopy , then employed deer spectroscopy to detect epr signals of electron spins surrounding the nv center in diamond . from the epr spectrum",
    ", we determined that the detected electron spins are substitutional single nitrogen impurities in diamond .",
