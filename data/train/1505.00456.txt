    "consider the situation of a late inning of a close baseball game , with one out , and a single baserunner , who is on first base .",
    "assume the batter hits the ball towards the outfield and it is not clear if the ball will fall in for a hit .",
    "the baserunner typically runs partway towards second base and then waits to see if the outfielder will catch the ball or not before continuing .",
    "we will refer to this strategy as the _ conventional baserunning strategy_. this strategy is almost always used in order to prevent a double play .",
    "indeed , if the ball is caught before it touches the ground , the baserunner must return to first base before the defense can get the ball to first base , or they are also ruled out , ending the inning . in this situation , standing and waiting can prevent a double play .",
    "in contrast , when there are two outs , the baserunner has the freedom to run aggressively without waiting . indeed ,",
    "if the ball is caught , the inning is over anyway , so there is no possibility of a double play .    in this paper",
    ", we make the case that the 2 out , aggressive baserunning strategy should be employed with less than two outs in specific situations .",
    "in fact , this aggressive baserunning strategy is almost never used with fewer than two outs . in the rare cases when it is used , traditional baseball statistics can not detect it , unless it results in a double play . therefore , our arguments are necessarily indirect , rather than purely statistical .    assume a runner is on first base in the 9th inning with one out , and a ball is hit to shallow right field .",
    "the outfielder is running very fast , attempting to catch the ball .",
    "let us say that the probability of a hit is 0.5 .",
    "such a probability assessment could be made by the coaches , or the baserunner , in the time it takes the baserunner to reach the point where they would conventionally stop ( we will discuss the problem of estimating this probability in section [ conclusions ] ) . in section 2 , we show that in this scenario , they should not stop .",
    "indeed the only way stopping could be beneficial , is if the ball is actually caught .",
    "therefore , the maximum reward of the conventional baserunning strategy is exactly one runner on first base , with two outs .",
    "we will show that this reward is relatively insignificant . as a clear example , consider that between the years of 2003 and 2008 , late inning mlb specialist mariano rivera pitched in 58 different high leverage innings where there was exactly one baserunner , who was on first base with two outs .",
    "none of those 58 runners eventually scored in those innings .",
    "with hindsight , it is clear that no one should have coveted such a reward .",
    "baserunners would have been better off pretending that there were two outs instead of one out , to increase their chances of scoring .",
    "indeed , rivera , is only slightly better than the average pitcher with a runner on third base and one out .    in the literature ,",
    "there have been a number of similar questions addressed . in @xcite ,",
    "the expected number of runs is shown , for each configuration of bases occupied , and by the event that occurs .",
    "the notion we are proposing is quite similar in nature to the notion of sacrifice bunting , stealing bases , or aggressive baserunning ( taking an `` extra '' base ) which have been studied ( for example , also in @xcite ) .",
    "it is known , for example , that bunting reduces the expected runs in general , but can be a good idea for a poor hitter , or if scoring only one run is desired . in @xcite , the probability of scoring at least one run given each base configuration is given .",
    "in general , runners should be far more aggressive in taking an `` extra base '' than they are in practice ( as in @xcite ) . in @xcite ,",
    "the authors calculate the run value of taking an extra base . in this paper",
    "however , we are more concerned with the opportunities lost by waiting instead of running .",
    "consider the possibility that there are @xmath3 outs where @xmath4 or @xmath5 , and as a simplifying assumption , that aggressive baserunning without waiting , from first base , will result in the runner ending up on third base instead of second base should a ball in play fall in for a hit .",
    "we examine this reward  the offense has a runner on third base instead of second base .",
    "we define the following , for @xmath6 :    * let @xmath7 be the resulting probability of at least one run scoring later in the ( half ) inning , starting from a situation where there is a runner on third base and @xmath3 outs ( no requirements regarding first and second base ) .",
    "* let @xmath8 be the probability of at least one run scoring later in the ( half ) inning , starting from a situation where there are @xmath3 outs and a runner on second base , but no runner on third base ( no requirements regarding first base ) .",
    "* let @xmath9 be the probability that at least one runner will score later in the inning , starting from the situation that there are @xmath10 outs , a runner on first base and no runners on second or third .",
    "we will measure @xmath11 and @xmath9 for each pitcher , as well as in aggregate . to calculate @xmath7 , as numerator",
    ", we use the number of half innings where there was a runner on third with @xmath3 outs and the pitcher pitching , and at least one run scores later on in the half inning . therefore ,",
    "even if the scenario occurs more than once in the same half inning , it is only counted once . as denominator",
    "we use the same value as the numerator plus the number of half innings where the pitcher was in that situation , and there were zero runs henceforth scored .",
    "we calculate @xmath8 and @xmath9 similarly .",
    "note that the _ reward _ for the aggressive strategy with @xmath3 outs can be measured by the _ difference _ @xmath12 , and that the only possible reward from the conventional strategy can be measured by @xmath9 ( we use the subscript @xmath3 because @xmath13 is contributing to the @xmath3-out statistic , even though @xmath13 is calculated by examining situations where there are @xmath10 outs ) .",
    "now assume the ball is hit to the outfield and that the probability that the ball falls for a hit is judged to be @xmath14 , where @xmath15 .",
    "the probability that at least one run scores , using the conventional strategy is : @xmath16 the probability that at least one run scores with our proposed aggressive strategy is : @xmath17 thus , the aggressive strategy is at least as beneficial as the conventional strategy , with the goal of scoring a run in the inning , whenever : @xmath18    then , @xmath19 is the minimum value of @xmath14 for which risky baserunning is at least as good as the conventional strategy . in the unlikely event that",
    "@xmath20 , then it is not possible that the conventional stradegy would be better than the aggressive strategy .",
    "( observe that since @xmath15 , equation ( [ equation1 ] ) would have no solution ) . in this case",
    ", we automatically declare @xmath19 to equal @xmath2 , meaning that one must be completely certain that the ball will fall in for a hit before running too far away from first base .",
    "if , on the other hand , @xmath21 , then it makes sense to ask : which values of @xmath14 make the aggressive strategy at least as good or better ?",
    "the answer is found by solving for @xmath14 in equation ( [ equation1 ] ) : @xmath22    we will therefore define @xmath0  as follows :    for @xmath6 ( the number of outs ) , we define the @xmath3-out _ baserunning risk threshold _ , ( @xmath23 ) as , @xmath24 [ brtdefinition ]    note that @xmath7 will almost certainly be bigger than @xmath8 , unless our data is insufficient in the context used , to have confidence in those probabilities in the first place .",
    "if we did not include the second case in equation ( [ brtdef ] ) , then the @xmath0  statistic would be less than zero if and only if @xmath25 , which would be undefined if and only if @xmath26 , and would be bigger than one if and only if @xmath27 and @xmath28 . one of these scenarios , or @xmath29 , is true if and only if @xmath30 , and therefore , the @xmath0  is mapped to one",
    ".    definition [ brtdefinition ] was chosen based on two assumptions :    1 .",
    "running aggressively without waiting to see if the ball in play is a hit , from first base , will result in the runner ending up safely at third base , 2 .",
    "conventional baserunning would result in the baserunner ending up safely at second base .",
    "our work shows that in order to maximize the probability of scoring at least one run under these assumptions , the aggressive baserunning strategy is better than conventional baserunning whenever @xmath31 . without our assumptions the discussion would be much different . in the event",
    "that running aggressively would result in the original baserunner being thrown out at third , our strategy would not be as effective .",
    "however , it is also possible that running aggressively could be much more effective as well , if for example , the runner from first could score if they run aggressively .",
    "this point will be discussed further in section [ conclusions ] .",
    "all data , unless noted otherwise , is from . we will give restrictions on the data used for the various statistics provided below .",
    "the aggregate @xmath32 and @xmath33 statistics for all pitchers , in any inning from 1984 - 2011 appears in table [ aggregatestat ] .",
    ".on the left , aggregate statistics for all pitchers in any inning from 1984 - 2011 , for one and zero out . on the right is a restriction to high leverage situations .",
    "[ cols= \" < , < \" , ]",
    "many aspects of baseball strategy assume an ability to approximately judge probabilities in real time .",
    "for example , when the third base coach decides whether or not to send a runner home from third base on a sacrifice fly ball , the coach is ( perhaps unwittingly ) making a probability estimation that the runner can beat the throw to home plate , and comparing that to the probability the run will score in some other way . these estimated probabilities may not be accurately calculated , but they are likely approximately correct",
    ". they may be influenced by actual calculations and discussions before the game , and they may be adjusted after risks are taken and then reassessed .",
    "therefore trial and experience helps improve accuracy .",
    "the conventional baserunning strategy , as defined in this paper , tacitly assumes that brt is equal to 1 .",
    "one other method that the baserunner or third base coach could use to estimate the probability that the ball fall in for a hit is to use _ batting average on balls in play ( babip ) _ in different contexts .",
    "if the ball is hit in some particular situation where the babip is greater than the @xmath0 , then the baserunner should run as soon as they determine that situation is occurring .",
    "for example , in @xcite , the author calculates the babip depending on the horizontal angle of contact off of the bat ( data from 2008 ) .",
    "it is demonstrated that if the angle off the bat is between approximately @xmath1 degrees and @xmath34 degrees , then the babip is greater than @xmath35 , which is greater than the aggregate @xmath32 .",
    "the estimate for the angle off of the bat can be made on contact , perhaps by the third base coach , and if it is less than this upper bound on the angle , then the runner should run immediately .",
    "we could not tell from the statistical record , how often the aggressive baserunning strategy is employed .",
    "however , it seems to be extremely rare .",
    "this suggests that current practice of major league baseball teams is not approximately correct , in certain situations . by focusing on a shallow hit to right field , with the outfielder playing deep and running very fast ,",
    "we have suggested a specific situation where it is very likely that current practice is not correct",
    ". there may be many other situations where current practice is not approximately correct , but it may be more difficult to make those determinations , until people start tracking that data necessary to make that analysis .",
    "suppose a team starts to employ our suggested baserunning strategy .",
    "an observer would then keep track of the number of times that the runner does not stop .",
    "if a double play results , it counts as a failure .",
    "if the ball falls in for a hit , and the observer judges that the runner advanced further from running aggressively , then it is a success . with such data ,",
    "much more substantial analysis would be possible .",
    "in other words , we do not know how to analyze our strategy directly , until a team tries it and records success ."
