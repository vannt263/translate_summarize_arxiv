    "the important task of quantum mechanics is to find the exact bound - states solution of the schrdinger equation for certain potentials of physical interest . generally speaking",
    ", there are a few main traditional methods to study the exact solutions of quantum systems like the coulomb , the harmonic oscillator [ 1,2 ] , the pseudoharmonic [ 3,4 ] and the kratzer [ 4,5 ] potentials . additionally , in order to obtain the bound - states solutions of central potentials , one has to resort to numerical techniques or approximation schemes .",
    "for many of the quantum mechanical systems , most popular approximation methods such as shifted @xmath1 expansion [ 6 ] , perturbation theory [ 7 ] , path integral solution [ 8 ] , algebraic methods with the susyquantum mechanics method and the idea of shape invariance , further closely with the factorization mrthod [ 9 ] , exact quantization rule [ 10,11 ] , the conventional nikiforov and uvarov ( nu ) method  [ 12 - 25 ] .",
    "some of these methods have drawbacks in applications . although some other methods give simple relations for the eigenvalues , however , they lead to a very complicated relations for the eigenfunctions .",
    "the study of exact solutions of the schrdinger equation for a class of non - central potentials with a vector potential and a non - central scalar potential is of considerable interest in quantum chemistry [ 26 - 35 ] . in recent years",
    ", numerous studies [ 36 - 40 ] have been made in analyzing the bound states of an electron in a coulomb field with simultaneous presence of aharanov - bohm ( ab ) [ 41 ] field , and/or a magnetic dirac monopole [ 42 ] , and aharanov - bohm plus oscillator ( abo ) systems . in most of these studies ,",
    "the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions are obtained by means of seperation of variables in spherical or other orthogonal curvilinear coordinate systems .",
    "the path integral for particles moving in non - central potentials is evaluated to derive the energy spectrum of this system analytically [ 43 ] .",
    "in addition , the idea of susy and shape invariance is also used to obtain exact solutions of such non - central but seperable potentials [ 44 ] .",
    "very recently , the conventional nu method has been used to give a clear recipe of how to obtain an explicit exact bound - states solutions for the energy eigenvalues and their corresponding wave functions in terms of orthogonal polynomials for a class of non - central potentials [ 45 ] .",
    "recently , chen and dong [ 46 ] found a new ring - shaped potential and obtained the exact solution of the schrdinger equation for the coulomb potential plus this new ring - shaped potential which has possible applications to ring - shaped organic molecules like cyclic polyenes and benzene .",
    "very recently , cheng and dai [ 47 ] , proposed a new potential consisting from the modified kratzer s potential [ 48 ] plus the new proposed ring - shaped potential in [ 46 ] .",
    "they have presented the energy eigenvalues for this proposed exactly - solvable non - central potential in three dimensional @xmath2i.e .",
    ", @xmath3-schrdinger equation through the nu method .",
    "the two quantum systems solved by refs [ 46,47 ] are closely relevant to each other as they deal with a coulombic field interaction except for a slight change in the angular momentum barrier acts as a repulsive core which is for any arbitrary angular momentum @xmath4 prevents collapse of the system in any dimensional space due to the slight perturbation to the original angular momentum barrier .",
    "the conventional nikiforov - uvarov ( @xmath5 ) method [ 12 ] , which received much interest , has been introduced for solving schrdinger equation [ 13 - 21 ] , klein - gordon [ 22,23 ] , dirac [ 24 ] and salpeter [ 25 ] equations .",
    "we will follow parallel solution to [ 47 ] and give a complete exact bound - states solutions and normalized wave functions of the @xmath0-dimensional schrdinger equation with modified kratzer plus ring - shaped potential , a coulombic - like potential with an additional centrifugal potential barrier , for any arbitrary @xmath6-states using the conventional nikiforov - uvarov method .",
    "our general solution reduces to the standard three - dimensions given by ref . [ 47 ] in the limiting case of @xmath7 .",
    "this work is organized as follows : in section [ bc ] , we shall briefly introduce the basic concepts of the nu method .",
    "section [ es ] is mainly devoted to the exact solution of the schrdinger equation in @xmath0-dimensions for this quantum system by means of the @xmath5 method .",
    "finally , the relevant results are discussed in section [ rac ] .",
    "the nu method is based on reducing the second - order differential equation to a generalized equation of hypergeometric type [ 12 ] . in this sense , the schrdinger equation , after employing an appropriate coordinate transformation @xmath8 transforms to the following form : @xmath9 where @xmath10 and @xmath11 are polynomials , at most of second - degree , and @xmath12 is a first - degree polynomial . using a wave function , @xmath13 of  the simple ansatz :    @xmath14    reduces ( 1 ) into an equation of a hypergeometric type    @xmath15    where    @xmath16    @xmath17    and @xmath18 is a parameter defined as @xmath19 the polynomial @xmath20 with the parameter @xmath21 and prime factors show the differentials at first degree be negative .",
    "it is worthwhile to note that @xmath18 or @xmath22 are obtained from a particular solution of the form @xmath23 which is a polynomial of degree @xmath24 further , the other part @xmath25 of the wave function ( 2 ) is the hypergeometric - type function whose polynomial solutions are given by rodrigues relation    @xmath26 , \\ ] ]    where @xmath27 is the normalization constant and the weight function @xmath28 must satisfy the condition [ 12 ]    @xmath29    the function @xmath30 and the parameter @xmath18 are defined as    @xmath31    @xmath32    in principle , since @xmath33 has to be a polynomial of degree at most one , the expression under the square root sign in ( 9 ) can be arranged to be the square of a polynomial of first degree [ 12 ] .",
    "this is possible only if its discriminant is zero . in this case ,",
    "an equation for @xmath34 is obtained . after solving this equation , the obtained values of @xmath34",
    "are substituted in ( 9 ) .",
    "in addition , by comparing equations ( 6 ) and ( 10 ) , we obtain the energy eigenvalues .",
    "the modified kratzer potential plus ring - shaped potential in spherical coordinates is defined as [ 47 ]    @xmath35    where @xmath36 is positive real constant .",
    "the potential in ( 11 ) introduced by cheng - dai [ 47 ] reduces to the modified kratzer potential in the limiting case of @xmath37 [ 48]@xmath38 in fact the energy spectrum for this potential can be obtained directly by considering it as special case of the general non - central seperable potentials [ 45 ] .",
    "our aim is to derive analytically the energy spectrum for a moving particle in the presence of a potential ( 11 ) in a very simple way .",
    "the @xmath0-dimensional space schrdinger equation in spherical polar coordinates written for potential ( 11 ) takes the form [ 1,6 ]    @xmath39 \\psi ( r,\\theta , \\varphi ) \\ ] ] @xmath40 \\psi ( r,\\theta , \\varphi ) = 0,\\ ] ] where @xmath41 being the reduced mass of the two particles and @xmath42 being the total wave function separated as follows    @xmath43    on substituting equation ( 13 ) into ( 12 ) leads to a set of second - order differential equations : @xmath44 r(r)+\\frac{2\\mu } { \\hbar ^{2}}\\left [ e - d_{e}\\left ( \\frac{r - r_{e}}{r}\\right ) ^{2}\\right ] r(r)=0,\\ ] ]    @xmath45 h(\\theta ) = 0,\\ ] ]    @xmath46    where @xmath47 the solution in ( 16 ) is periodic and must satisfy the period boundary condition @xmath48 from which we obtain @xmath49 therefore , we are left to solve equations ( 14 ) and ( 15 ) .",
    "after lengthy , but straightforward , calculations , equation ( 14 ) , representing the radial wave equation can be rewritten as [ 6 ] : @xmath50 g(r)=0,\\ ] ] where @xmath51 the two particles in equation ( 18 ) interacting via coulombic - like field have a slight change in the angular momentum barrier acts as a repulsive core which for any arbitrary @xmath4 prevents collapse of the system in any space dimension due to the additional centrifugal potential barrier . on the other hand , equation ( 15 ) representing",
    "the angular wave equation takes the simple form @xmath52 h(\\theta ) = 0.\\ ] ] therefore , equations ( 18 ) and ( 20 ) have to be solved latter by using the nu method in the following subsections .      in order to apply nu method",
    ", we introduce a new variable @xmath53 equation ( 20 ) is then rearranged as the universal associated - legendre differential equation [ 45,49 ]    @xmath54    where    @xmath55    the solution of this equation has already been solved by the nu method in [ 45,47 ] . however , the aim in this subsection is to solve with different parameters resulting from the @xmath0-space - dimensions of schrdinger equation . upon letting @xmath56",
    "we can readily obtain the standard case given in [ 47 ] .",
    "equation ( 21 ) is compared with ( 1 ) and the following identifications are obtained    @xmath57    inserting the above expressions into equation ( 9 ) , one obtains the following function :    @xmath58    following the method , the polynomial @xmath33 is found in the following possible values @xmath59 imposing the condition @xmath60 for equation ( 5 ) , one selects    @xmath61    which yields form equation ( 5 ) @xmath62 using equations ( 6 ) and ( 10 ) , the following expressions for @xmath18 are obtained , respectively ,    @xmath63    @xmath64    we compare equations ( 28 ) and ( 29 ) and from the definition @xmath65 the new angular momentum  @xmath66 values are obtained as    @xmath67    which can be reduced to the simple form    @xmath68    in three - dimensions [ 47 ] . using equations ( 2)-(4 ) and ( 7)-(8 ) ,",
    "the wave function can be written as ,    @xmath69    where @xmath70 is the normalization constant given in [ 46,47 ] and    @xmath71    with @xmath72 is defined by equation ( 22 ) .",
    "the solution of the se for the modified central kratzer s potential has already been solved by means of nu - method in [ 48 ] . very recently , using the same method , the problem for the non - central potential in ( 11 ) has been solved in three dimensions by cheng and dai [ 47 ] . however , the aim of this subsection is to solve the problem with a different radial separation function @xmath73 in any arbitrary dimensions .",
    "we now study the bound - states ( real ) solution @xmath74 of equation ( 18 ) . letting @xmath75 and substituting these expressions in equation ( 18 ) ,",
    "one gets @xmath76 to apply the conventional nu - method , equation ( 35 ) is compared with ( 1 ) and the following expressions are obtained    @xmath77    substituting the above expressions into equation ( 9 ) gives    @xmath78    according to this conventional method , the expression in the square root be the square of a polynomial .",
    "thus , the two roots @xmath34 can be readily obtained as    @xmath79    in view of that , we arrive at the following four possible functions of @xmath80@xmath81 & \\text{\\ for } k_{1}=\\alpha + \\varepsilon \\sqrt{4\\gamma + 1 } , \\\\",

    "\\frac{1}{2}-\\left [ \\varepsilon r-\\frac{1}{2}\\sqrt{4\\gamma + 1}\\right ] & \\text{\\ for } k_{2}=\\alpha -\\varepsilon \\sqrt{4\\gamma + 1}. \\end{array } \\right.\\ ] ] the correct value of @xmath82 is chosen such that the function @xmath83 given by equation ( 5 ) will have negative derivative [ 12 ] .",
    "so we can select the physical values to be    @xmath84 , \\ ] ]    which yield @xmath85 using equations ( 6 ) and ( 10 ) , the following expressions for @xmath18 are obtained , respectively ,    @xmath86    @xmath87    so we can obtain the energy eigenvalues as    @xmath88    where    @xmath89    with @xmath6 defined in ( 30 ) .",
    "therefore , the final energy spectra in equation ( 44 ) take the following coulombic - like form [ 7 ] @xmath90 where    @xmath91 , \\ ] ]    is simply obtained by means of substituting equation ( 45 ) into ( 44 ) .",
    "\\(i ) if @xmath7 , equation ( 44 ) , with the help of equation ( 45 ) , is transformed into the following form    @xmath92    and it is consistent with equation ( 40 ) in [ 47 ] .",
    "\\(ii ) if , @xmath7 and @xmath37 ( modified kratzer potential)@xmath93 equation ( 44 ) is transformed into the form    @xmath94    and it is consistent with equation ( 14 ) in [ 48 ] .",
    "let us now turn attention to find the radial wavefunctions for this potential . using @xmath95 @xmath82 and @xmath96 in equations ( 4 ) and ( 8)",
    ", we find @xmath97    @xmath98    then from equation ( 7 ) , we obtain    @xmath99    and the wave function @xmath73 can be written in the form of the generalized laguerre polynomials as    @xmath100    where @xmath101 can be found easily from equation ( 47 ) . finally , the radial wave functions of the schrdinger equation are obtained @xmath102 where    @xmath103    with @xmath104 is given in equation ( 47 ) and @xmath105 is the normalization constant to be determined below . using the normalization condition , @xmath106 and the orthogonality relation of the generalized laguerre polynomials , @xmath107 ^{2}dz=\\frac{(2n+\\eta + 1)(n+\\eta ) ! } { n!},$ ] we have    @xmath108    therefore , we may express the normalized total wave functions as    @xmath109 @xmath110",
    "in this paper , the schrdinger equation in any arbitrary dimensions has been solved for its exact bound - states with a recently proposed modified kratzer potential plus ring - shaped potential by means of a simple conventional nu method .",
    "the analytical expressions for the total energy levels of this system is found to be different from the results obtained for the modified kratzer s potential in [ 48 ] and also more general than the one obtained recently in three - dimensions [ 47 ] .",
    "therefore , the noncentral potentials treated in [ 45 ] can be introduced as perturbation to the modified kratzer s potential by adjusting the strength of the coupling constant @xmath36 in terms of @xmath111 which is the coupling constant of the modified kratzer s potential .",
    "in addition , the angular part , the radial part and then the total wave functions are also found . thus , the schrdinger equation with a new non - central but separable potential has also been studied ( cf . [",
    "45 ] and the references therein ) .",
    "this method is very simple and useful in solving other complicated systems analytically without given a restiction conditions on the solution of some quantum systems as the case in the other models . finally , we point out that these exact results obtained for this new proposed form of the potential ( 11 ) may have some interesting applications in the study of different quantum mechanical systems , atomic and molecular physics .",
