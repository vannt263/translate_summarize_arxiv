    "in perturbative quantum field theory the @xmath0-point functions are given by weighted sums over all feynman graphs of a given type .",
    "each feynman graph represents an integral which is often divergent .",
    "this is due to the fact that products of feynman propagators with coincident spacetime points are not defined . in particular",
    ", all divergences of a given feynman graph reside in the 1-particle irreducible ( 1pi ) subgraphs .",
    "therefore , these are essential for renormalization for it is enough to renormalize the 1pi graphs .",
    "the systematic generation of all ( bare ) 1pi feynman graphs is traditionally dealt with via the legendre transform of the generating functional of connected green functions and iteration of the 1pi dyson - schwinger equations . though this is the standard procedure , any method to straightforwardly manipulate 1pi feynman graphs",
    "may actually be used . here , we focus on the algorithm to generate all 1pi ( i.e.",
    ", 2-edge connected ) graphs given in ref . .",
    "this is so that larger 1pi graphs are produced from smaller ones by increasing the number of their building blocks , the maximal 1-vertex irreducible ( 1vi ) ( i.e. , biconnected ) subgraphs .",
    "the decomposition of 1pi graphs in terms of their 1vi components is of interest to perturbative quantum field theory for the counterterm of a 1pi graph is given by the product of the counterterms of its 1vi components @xcite .",
    "the present work is closely related to ref . where recursion formulas to generate all trees and all connected graphs are given .",
    "the underlying structure is an algebraic representation of graphs based on the hopf algebra structure of the symmetric algebra on monomials of time - ordered field operators given in ref . .",
    "this allowed to derive simple algebraic relations between complete , connected and 1pi @xmath0-point functions @xcite , and to express a connected @xmath0-point function in terms of its loop order contributions @xcite . here , we extend the latter result to 1pi @xmath0-point functions . to this end , we give a coalgebra structure on 1vi feynman graphs which is that of a cocommutative coassociative graded connected coalgebra .",
    "we generalize the coproduct to a map on the algebraic representation whose action is analogous to that of the coproduct .",
    "we use the truncated coproduct @xcite and the analog of the coproduct on 1vi graphs to derive algebraic expressions of the recursion formulas to generate all 1vi and all 1pi graphs given in ref . .",
    "as in ref .",
    ", the underlying algorithms are amenable to direct implementation and allow efficient calculations of graphs as well as their values as feynman graphs . moreover",
    ", all results apply both to bosonic and fermionic fields .",
    "note , however , that no type of renormalization procedure is taken into account . in this sense",
    "the computed @xmath0-point functions may be considered as bare ones .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : section [ sec : fey ] recalls the definition of feynman graphs and their relation to the @xmath0-point functions .",
    "section  [ sec : field ] reviews the hopf algebra structure of the associative algebra on monomials of time - ordered field operators given in ref . .",
    "section  [ sec : algrep ] recalls the hopf algebraic representation of graphs given in ref . and gives a non - associative graph multiplication .",
    "section [ sec : coalg ] gives a coalgebra structure on 1vi feynman graphs and generalizes the coproduct to the algebraic representation .",
    "section [ sec : linear ] gives the basic linear maps to construct 1vi or 1pi graphs .",
    "sections [ sec:1vi ] and [ sec:1pi ] express the recursion formulas to generate 1vi and 1pi graphs given in ref . in a completely algebraic language , while section [ sec : npoint ] deals with their interpretation in terms of the 1pi @xmath0-point functions .",
    "in the following we are concerned with a generic perturbative quantum field theory with fields @xmath1 as operator valued distributions with adequate test functions . here , @xmath2 represents a label that specifies spacetime coordinates , particle type , minkowski indices , spin , colour , etc .",
    "the elementary field operators are local fields whose propagation and interactions may be described by local hamiltonian or lagrangian densities . for more information on these ,",
    "we refer the reader to any standard textbook on quantum field theory such as ref . .",
    "note , however , that the essential property used in this paper is that they are ( labeled ) elements of a vector space . moreover , as in ref .",
    ", for simplicity we limit ourselves in the following exposition to a purely bosonic theory with a single scalar field . a more extensive discussion including fermionic fields is given in section vi d of ref .",
    "we review the essentials about feynman graphs that can be found in any textbook on quantum field theory such as ref . .",
    "the following notation will be used in all the paper : by @xmath3 , we denote a ( vertex ) numbered graph while by @xmath4 , we denote the associated feynman graph .    in perturbative quantum field theory ,",
    "the calculation of physical quantities consists of evaluating integrals represented by feynman graphs .",
    "these are graphs that carry certain labels on vertices and edges . the former correspond to the interaction terms of the lagrangian , while the latter may correspond to momenta and internal indices ( usually indicated by different styles of lines , e.g. , straight for fermions , wiggly for bosons , etc ) . here",
    ", we assume that labels are attached to the free ends of external edges , so that internal labels shall be summed or integrated over .",
    "the simplest feynman graph is the graph consisting of an external edge only , its two end points labeled @xmath5 and @xmath6 , respectively , and its value corresponding to the feynman propagator @xmath7 , see figure [ fig : feynman ] ( a ) .",
    "the latter is a green s function for the free klein - gordon equation which is interpreted as the probability amplitude that a particle changes position or some other attribute .",
    "the feynman propagator is invertible under convolution .",
    "its inverse @xmath8 is determined by the following equation : @xmath9    besides changing spacetime positions or other properties , a particle can split into many other particles . the probability amplitude that this happens is represented by ( bare ) interacting vertices .",
    "the value of a graph that consists of a vertex with external edges labeled @xmath10 , is given by the @xmath0-point vertex function @xmath11 : @xmath12 where @xmath13 denotes the truncated @xmath0-point vertex function .     and",
    "@xmath14.,width=340 ]    in general , the value of a feynman graph may be computed as follows : associate a label with each of the ends of internal edges and form the product over a vertex function associated with each vertex and an inverse feynman propagator associated with each internal edge .",
    "finally , integrate over all possible assignments of internal labels .",
    "for instance , the feynman graph given in figure [ fig : feynman ] ( b ) represents the probability amplitude that a particle in state @xmath5 goes to state @xmath2 , splits into two particles in states @xmath15 and @xmath16 , which go to states @xmath17 and @xmath18 , respectively , and then fuse into a particle in state @xmath19 , which goes to state @xmath6 .",
    "the value of this graph is given by @xmath20    a typical experiment consists of a setup of the initial particle configurations followed by a measurement of the final configurations .",
    "the theoretical prediction is expressed in terms of the green s functions . these are sums of the probability amplitudes associated with all possible ways in which the final state can be reached .",
    "for instance , the complete @xmath0-point function @xmath21 is the vacuum expectation value of the time - ordered product of @xmath0 field operators , i.e. , @xmath22 where @xmath23 denotes the _ time - ordering _ operator ( see ref . for instance ) .",
    "@xmath23 arranges the fields in decreasing time , reading from left to right , so that @xmath24 commutes with itself at equal times .    in terms of feynman graphs",
    "the various types of @xmath0-point functions are given by the sum over the values of all feynman graphs ( of the same kind ) with exactly @xmath0 external edges labeled @xmath10 .",
    "each graph is associated with a scalar factor , called _",
    "weight _ which corresponds to the inverse of its symmetry factor .",
    "for instance , denote by @xmath25 the set of all feynman graphs of the given theory with @xmath0 external edges .",
    "given an arbitrary feynman graph @xmath26 , denote by @xmath27 its value for the given labelings .",
    "in this context , the complete @xmath0-point function yields @xmath28 where @xmath29 denotes the weight of the graph @xmath4 .    in the following , we will consider the restricted classes of feynman graphs which are @xmath30-vertex or @xmath30-particle irreducible .",
    "we recall here the definitions ( see ref .",
    "( pages 289 and 393 ) ) : a connected graph is said to be _",
    "@xmath30-vertex irreducible ( 1vi ) _ ( resp .",
    "_ @xmath30-particle irreducible ( 1pi )",
    "_ ) if and only if it remains connected after erasing any vertex ( together with assigned edges ) ( resp .",
    "any internal edge ) .",
    "we consider that a single vertex is both 1vi and 1pi by convention .",
    "clearly , all 1vi graphs but the @xmath31-vertex tree are 1pi . furthermore , given a connected graph , we call _ articulation _ vertex to any vertex whose removal disconnects the graph . in this context , a 1vi graph is one without articulation vertices .",

    "this is a hopf algebra @xcite equipped with    a.   a coproduct @xmath39 defined on @xmath33 and @xmath32 by @xmath40 , @xmath41 , and extended to the whole of @xmath34 by compatibility with the product ; b.   a counit @xmath42 for @xmath43 ; c.   an antipode @xmath44    furthermore , we define the @xmath36-fold application of the coproduct , @xmath45 , as follows : @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "the latter equation can be written in @xmath48 different ways ( corresponding to applying the coproduct to each of the @xmath48 tensor factors ) which are all equivalent due to the coassociativity of the coproduct .",
