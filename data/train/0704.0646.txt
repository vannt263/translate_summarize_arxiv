    "the idea that our universe is in some sense mathematical goes back at least to the pythagoreans , and has been extensively discussed in the literature ( see , , @xcite ) .",
    "galileo galilei stated that the universe is a grand book written in the language of mathematics , and wigner reflected on the `` unreasonable effectiveness of mathematics in the natural sciences '' @xcite . in this essay",
    ", i will push this idea to its extreme and argue that our universe _ is _ mathematics in a well - defined sense . after elaborating on this hypothesis and underlying assumptions in",
    ", i discuss a variety of its implications in sections  [ scratchsec]-[goedelsec ] .",
    "this paper can be thought of as the sequel to one i wrote in 1996 @xcite , clarifying and extending the ideas described therein .",
    "although many physicists subscribe to the erh and dedicate their careers to the search for a deeper understanding of this assumed external reality , the erh is not universally accepted , and is rejected by , , metaphysical solipsists .",
    "indeed , adherents of the copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics may reject the erh on the grounds that there is no reality without observation . in this paper",
    ", we will assume that the erh is correct and explore its implications .",
    "we will see that , although it sounds innocuous , the erh has sweeping implications for physics if taken seriously .",
    "physics theories aim to describe how this assumed external reality works .",
    "our most successful physics theories to date are generally regarded as descriptions of merely limited aspects of the external reality .",
    "in contrast , the holy grail of theoretical physics is to find a _",
    "complete _ description of it , jocularly referred to as a `` theory of everything '' , or `` toe '' .",
    "the erh implies that for a description to be complete , it must be well - defined also according to non - human sentient entities ( say aliens or future supercomputers ) that lack the common understanding of concepts that we humans have evolved , , `` particle '' , `` observation '' or indeed any other english words .",
    "put differently , such a description must be expressible in a form that is devoid of human `` baggage '' .      to give a few examples ,",
    "illustrates how various theories can be crudely organized in a family tree where each might , at least in principle , be derivable from more fundamental ones above it .",
    "all these theories have two components : mathematical equations and `` baggage '' , words that explain how they are connected to what we humans observe and intuitively understand .",
    "quantum mechanics as usually presented in textbooks has both components : some equations as well as three fundamental postulates written out in plain english . at each level in the hierarchy of theories , new concepts ( , protons , atoms , cells , organisms , cultures ) are introduced because they are convenient , capturing the essence of what is going on without recourse to the more fundamental theory above it .",
    "it is important to remember , however , that it is we humans who introduce these concepts and the words for them : in principle , everything could have been derived from the fundamental theory at the top of the tree , although such an extreme reductionist approach appears useless in practice .",
    "crudely speaking , the ratio of equations to baggage decreases as we move down the tree , dropping near zero for highly applied fields such as medicine and sociology .",
    "in contrast , theories near the top are highly mathematical , and physicists are still struggling to articulate the concepts , if any , in terms of which we can understand them .",
    "the muh implies that the toe indicated by the question mark at the top is purely mathematical , with no baggage whatsoever .    as an extreme example of a `` theory '' , the description of external reality found in norse mythology involves a gigantic tree named yggdrasil , whose trunk supports earth",
    "this description all on its own is 100% baggage , since it lacks definitions of `` tree '' , `` earth '' , etc .",
    "today , the baggage fraction of this theory could be reduced by describing a tree as a particular arrangement of atoms , and describing this in turn as a particular quantum field theory state .",
    "moreover ( see , , @xcite ) , physics has come to focus on the way the external reality _ works _",
    "( described by regularities known as laws of physics ) rather than on the way it _ is _ ( the subject of initial conditions ) .    however , could it ever be possible to give a description of the external reality involving _ no _ baggage ?",
    "if so , our description of entities in the external reality and relations between them would have to be completely abstract , forcing any words or other symbols used to denote them to be mere labels with no preconceived meanings whatsoever .",
    "a _ mathematical structure _ is precisely this : _ abstract entities with relations between them_. familiar examples include the integers and the real numbers .",
    "we review detailed definitions of this and related mathematical notions in appendix a. here , let us instead illustrate this idea of baggage - free description with simple examples . consider the mathematical structure known as the group with two elements , , addition modulo two .",
    "it involves two elements that we can label `` 0 '' and `` 1 '' satisfying the following relations : \\ {          since the generating relations of a finite mathematical structure can be specified by simply tabulating all their values as in equations and , it is straightforward to encode the structure definition as a finite string of integers .",
    "here is a simple example of such an encoding scheme : @xmath3 here each set definition is simply an integer giving the number of elements in the set . each relation ( function )",
    "definition has the following structure : @xmath4 for each of the arguments as well as for the output returned by the relation , the type is simply one of the previously defined sets , numbered 0 , 1 , 2 , .... the value tensor simply lists all the values as an array ( 0-dimensional , 1-dimensional , 2-dimensional , depending on the number of arguments , looping over earlier arguments first in the same way that computer languages such as fortran store arrays .",
    "elements of the output set are numbered 0 , 1 , ....",
    "table   illustrates how this works for a number of simple examples .",
    "the two equivalent definitions of boolean algebra corresponding to equations and correspond to the strings s_1&=&\\ { 1 8 2 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 2 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 + & & 2 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 2 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 2 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 } , + s_2&=&\\ { 1 1 2 2 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 } + respectively ; the latter is clearly more economical .",
    "such an explicit encoding scheme allows mathematical structures to be defined in a way more amenable to computers .",
    "we say that an encoding @xmath5 _ generates _ an encoding @xmath6 if @xmath5 contains all the sets of @xmath6 and all relations in @xmath6 are generated by relations in @xmath5 .",
    "we say that two encodings @xmath5 and @xmath6 are _ equivalent _ if @xmath5 generates @xmath6 and @xmath6 generates @xmath5 . in our example",
    "above , @xmath5 and @xmath6 are equivalent , since they generate each other .",
    "if one wishes to catalog and enumerate all finite mathematical structures , it is convenient to order them by some measure of their complexity .",
    "there are many ways of doing this .",
    "for example , one could define the complexity @xmath7 ( measured in bits ) of an encoding @xmath8 of a mathematical structure as h(s)=_i=1^n_2(2+k_i ) .",
    "then the integers 0 , 1 and 2 add complexities of 1 bit , @xmath9 bits and 2 bits , respectively , and the two above encodings of boolean algebra have complexities of @xmath10 bits and @xmath11 bits , respectively , whereas the empty set in table   has 3.6 bits .",
    "this allows us to explicitly define a finite mathematical structure as an equivalence class of encodings .",
    "we label it by the encoding that has the lowest complexity , using lexicographical ordering to break any ties , and we define the complexity of the mathematical structure as the complexity of this simplest encoding . in other words , this provides an explicit scheme for enumerating all finite mathematical structures .",
    "the more general case of infinite mathematical structures is discussed at length in .",
    "the key point is that there are only countably many computable ones ( which include all the countably many finite structures ) , and that to enumerate them all , the encoding scheme above must be replaced by one that defines the relations not by explicit tabulation , but by providing an algorithm or computer program that implements them ."
