    "voronoi diagrams @xcite are a particular case of space tessellation , where given a set of centers , the space is divided according to their `` spheres of influence '' .",
    "each voronoi cell contains those points of the space that are closest to the same center .",
    "a voronoi tessellation in two - dimension would look like the polygons sketched in figure [ fig1 ] or figure [ fig2]d .",
    "given a set of centers there are two relatively easy ways to generate the corresponding voronoi diagram .",
    "we sketch this methods for the two - dimensional ( 2d ) case , and the generalization to any other dimension is immediate . in the _ first method _ ( the perpendicular bisectors method @xcite ) one starts from a given center ( @xmath3 ) and detects the nearest @xmath4 center to it .",
    "a part of the perpendicular bisector on the @xmath5 line will form the first edge of the voronoi polygon corresponding to @xmath3 . than the second nearest center ( @xmath6 ) is detected and the perpendicular bisector on @xmath7 is constructed again .",
    "this algorithm is continued with the third ( @xmath8 ) , fourth ( @xmath9 ) , fifth ( @xmath10 ) , ... nearest center , until the perpendicular bisectors on @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 .... will close a stable polygon which does not changes after considering any more distant points . repeating the above algorithm for all centers the voronoi tessellation of the whole space ( figure [ fig1 ] ) can be obtained .    the _ second method _ ( called the avrami - johnson - mehl method @xcite ) is especially useful for computer simulations . in this algorithm",
    "each center is identified as a nucleation point , from where a virtual disc with uniform radial velocity is growing ( figure [ fig2 ] ) .",
    "when two discs touch each other the growth in the contact direction is stopped for both of them and the contact point becomes a point on the corresponding voronoi diagram .",
    "the growth in all other directions is continued until a nearby disc is reached . in this way",
    "the same space tessellation as in the perpendicular bisector algorithm is achieved . in computer simulations it is handy to implement this algorithm not on continuous space but on large lattices since the contact points are easier to identify .    in the two - dimensional case",
    "the voronoi diagram can be obtained also from delaunay triangulation .",
    "the delaunay triangulation of a point set is a collection of edges satisfying an empty - circle criteria , which means that for each edge we can find a circle containing the edge s endpoints but not containing any other point from the initial set . in two - dimension",
    "the delaunay triangulation is the dual structure of the voronoi diagram @xcite .",
    "a particular case of voronoi diagrams , where the centers are randomly and uncorrelated distributed , are called poisson voronoi diagrams .",
    "poisson voronoi diagrams ( pvd ) are especially important for modeling and describing a wide variety of natural and social phenomena .",
    "pvd has been used to construct random lattices in quantum field theory @xcite or in the studies of conductivity and percolation in granular composites @xcite .",
    "pvd was also used in modeling growth of metal clusters on amorphous substrates @xcite , in studying conduction and percolation in continuous media @xcite , in modeling microemulsions @xcite , in interpreting small angle x - ray scattering for heterogeneous catalyst @xcite , in evaluating the actual galaxy distribution @xcite , in describing sections through various geological materials @xcite , in biology @xcite , in animal ecology @xcite , in sociology @xcite etc ... the above list is far from being complete , and suggests just a few possible applications for this particular space tessellation . for a more complete discussion of the use of voronoi diagrams",
    "many good review works are available @xcite .    despite their importance in science ,",
    "our knowledge on the geometrical and statistical properties of pvd is far from being complete @xcite .",
    "one of the most debated and less clarified aspect is the @xmath14 size distribution function of voronoi cells @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the probability that the size of a voronoi cell is between @xmath17 and @xmath18 . instead of @xmath14 it is more convenient to use the more general @xmath19 distribution function for the @xmath20 normalized cell sizes , which is independent of the center s density and it is universal for all pvd in a given dimension .",
    "alternatively , one could determine the @xmath21 cumulative distribution function defined as @xmath22 .",
    "apart of the simple one - dimensional case , presently there is no exact result or handy analytical approximation for the form of @xmath19 .",
    "since @xmath19 in two and three dimensions is of primary interest in many practical applications , there is a growing need for a simple and analytically usable formula .",
    "this would help characterizing and classifying several experimental patterns , and would give an important starting point also for modeling these structures .",
    "in contrast with mathematicians experimental scientist need a simple expression that could give a first hint about the nature of the measured cell - size distribution , which is usually determined with a poor statistics .",
    "there are many conjectures on the analytical form of @xmath19 and many computer simulations were done to prove the suggested forms .",
    "up to our knowledge in 2d the largest computer simulations were done by tanemura @xcite with @xmath23 voronoi cells and hinde and miles @xcite with @xmath24 cells . in 3d",
    "the largest ensembles were studied again by tanemura @xcite ( @xmath25 cells ) and kumar et al .",
    "@xcite ( @xmath26 cells ) .    as",
    "a generally accepted result emerges , that a three parameter ( @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 ) generalized gamma function fit @xmath30 describes the computer simulation data reasonable well .",
    "some authors @xcite suggested however that a simpler two - parameter ( @xmath27 and @xmath28 ) gamma function fit @xmath31 works also well .",
    "in 2d for the three parameter fit ( [ gamma ] ) tanemura @xcite found @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 , in good agreement with the results of hinde and miles @xcite @xmath35 , @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "for the two parameter fit ( [ fit ] ) the values @xmath38 @xcite or @xmath39 and @xmath40 @xcite were reported .    in",
    "the 3d case tanemura found @xcite @xmath41 , @xmath42 and @xmath43 for ( [ gamma ] ) , while kiang @xcite suggested a fit of the form ( [ fit ] ) with @xmath44 .",
    "we have to mention however that the simulations of tanemura @xcite did not supported kiang s results @xcite at all .",
    "for the sake of completeness it also has to be mentioned that there is an exact analytical result for the second moment ( @xmath45 ) of the pvd s both in the two and three - dimensional cases @xcite .",
    "according to this @xmath46 and @xmath47 @xcite , offering an excellent possibility for testing the computer simulation results and the correctness of the proposed fit .",
    "it was the enormous discrepancy between gilbert s and kiang s results for this second moment that condemned kiang s simulation results .",
    "the aim of the present work is not to give a better and more complicated fit for @xmath19 .",
    "we would rather intend to prove that a simple two parameter fit of the form ( [ fit ] ) used by kiang can be still a fair approximation for all practical applications .",
    "experimental scientist instead of focusing on a more accurate but difficult fit for the presumed pvd type patterns can use with confidence a simple approximation of the form ( [ fit ] ) . in the present",
    "work large - scale computer simulations are also considered for the problem , generating more voronoi cells than in all previous studies we are aware of .",
    "the statistics of @xmath48 and @xmath49 cells are studied in 2d and 3d , respectively . using this improved statistics kiang s conjecture will be followed and a first approximation for @xmath19 in the form ( [ fit ] ) will be given with simple and handy values of @xmath50 .",
    "solving the problem exactly in 1d will give us further motivation for this simpler form of @xmath19 .",
    "let us first study theoretically the simple problem in 1d and prove the validity of ( [ fit ] ) with @xmath50 .",
    "one has to mention however that several other methods are known to obtain the exact form of the @xmath51 distribution function in this simple case @xcite .",
    "a line with length @xmath52 is considered on which randomly and independently @xmath53 centers are distributed .",
    "the density of centers is given thus as @xmath54 , where @xmath55 stands for the average distance between centers .",
    "we will study the limit @xmath56 , @xmath57 , but @xmath58 finite .",
    "it is immediate to construct the voronoi diagrams for these centers ( figure [ fig3 ] ) .",
    "if a center @xmath59 is considered , first it s neighbor in the left ( @xmath60 ) and right ( @xmath61 ) direction will be detected .",
    "than the @xmath62 and @xmath63 lines are divided in two equal parts , by the @xmath64 and @xmath65 points , respectively .",
    "the segment @xmath66 is than the voronoi cell corresponding to the center @xmath59 .",
    "it is obvious that for the considered limit the average length of voronoi cells is @xmath67 .    in order to get the distribution function @xmath68 of the voronoi cell s length , first the distribution function @xmath69 for the lengths between centers",
    "will be determined .",
    "let us start from the well - known poisson distribution @xmath70 , giving the probability that inside a length @xmath71 there are @xmath53 centers : @xmath72 in the above equation @xmath73 stands for the expected ( average ) number of centers on a length @xmath71 .",
    "the probability that in an interval of length @xmath71 situated on the immediate right of @xmath59 there are no other centers is : @xmath74 the cumulative distribution @xmath75 that the first neighbor at the right is at a distance @xmath76 bigger than @xmath71 is @xmath77 .",
    "the distribution function @xmath78 for the lengths @xmath76 can be thus calculated as : @xmath79 due to symmetry constraints , the same distribution function should apply for the @xmath80 lengths relative to the first neighbor in the left direction . the distribution function for the half of these intervals ( @xmath81 or @xmath82 ) is given as : @xmath83 the length @xmath0 of the voronoi cell is @xmath84 , and it s distribution @xmath68 can be calculated as the convolution of two distributions of form ( [ half ] ) : @xmath85    it is immediate to realize that this distribution function is normalized for @xmath86 . the distribution function for the adimensional quantity @xmath87",
    "is given then as @xmath88 which has the general form ( [ fit ] ) with @xmath89 .",
    "the cumulative distribution function @xmath90 is given by @xmath91 and the moments of @xmath51 are immediately calculable : @xmath92 the most probable normalized length obtained from ( [ 1d ] ) is @xmath93 .",
    "a simple computer simulation exercise can easily convince us about the validity of our calculations .",
    "results in this sense are presented on figure [ fig4 ] . as an interesting observation",
    "one can realize that the distribution function for the lengths between randomly displaced centers ( given by ( [ centers ] ) ) is qualitatively different from the ( [ length ] ) distribution function for the length of voronoi cells ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "theoretical attempts to get analytical result for @xmath94 ( @xmath95 , with s the area of voronoi cells ) in 2d , failed .",
    "we considered thus monte carlo - type computer simulations and fitted our simulation data in different forms .",
    "in particular , we focused on a three parameter fit in the generally accepted ( [ gamma ] ) form and tried also a simple two parameter approximation ( [ fit ] ) with handy @xmath50 values .",
    "it was found that the simple choice @xmath96 gives a visually good fit .",
    "for the normalized distribution function of voronoi cell areas in 2d we proposed thus the @xmath97 simple approximation . on figure [ fig5 ]",
    "we plotted with a continuous line the curve ( [ 2d ] ) in comparison with simulation data obtained on @xmath98 voronoi cells ( almost three times more than the number of cells used by tanemura ) . on the same graph",
    "it is drawn with dashed line the best gamma function ( [ gamma ] ) fit .",
    "the @xmath99 cumulative distribution function is also plotted with dash - dotted line .    at a first glance",
    "there is no detectable difference between computer simulation results , the curve suggested by ( [ 2d ] ) and the gamma - function fit .",
    "magnifying however the initial part and tail of the distribution function and plotting it on log - log and log - normal scales ( insets in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] ) , respectively , one can observe slight differences .",
    "as expected , the three parameter gamma - function fit is better , but the improvement relative to ( [ 2d ] ) is not spectacular .",
    "the best - fit parameters obtained by us for ( [ gamma ] ) are @xmath100 and @xmath101 , in comparison with the values @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 obtained by tanemura @xcite . for the analytically known second moment of the distribution ( @xmath102 )",
    "our simulation data gives @xmath103 , and the three - parameter gamma - fit yields @xmath104 .",
    "the error relative to the exactly known result is of the same order ( @xmath105 ) as in the case of the fit given by tanemura to his own computer simulation results .    using ( [ 2d ] ) all the important moments",
    "can be analytically calculated : @xmath106 .",
    "the second moment has of course a much bigger relative error ( @xmath107 ) respective to the exactly known value than the one obtained with the more sophisticated three - parameter gamma - function fit .",
    "this relative error is however still quite small and usual experimental data on poisson voronoi type patterns gives deviations of the order of a few percents .",
    "the most probable normalized area is @xmath108 .",
    "due to the complex geometry involved , the possibility to analytically calculate @xmath109 ( @xmath110 , v the volume of voronoi cells ) in 3d is even more gloomy .",
    "we performed thus again large scale computer simulations , studying the statistics of @xmath111 voronoi cells ( six times more than the statistics considered by tanemura ) .",
    "the three - parameter gamma - function gives a good fit for the simulation data , but again as in the two - dimensional case a simple fit of the form ( [ fit ] ) works also reasonably well and handy @xmath112 values can be considered .",
    "we suggest thus that in 3d the voronoi cell s normalized volume distribution can be approximated as :    @xmath113    on figure [ fig6 ] simulation results ( empty circles ) are compared with the ( [ 3d ] ) approximation ( continuous line ) and the three parameter gamma - function fit ( dashed - line ) . in a first visual approximation one",
    "will realize that both curves describe well the simulation data .",
    "magnifying however the initial part and tail of the distribution function and plotting it on log - log and log - normal scales ( insets in figure [ fig6 ] ) , respectively , one can observe the differences .",
    "as expected , the ( [ gamma ] ) gamma - function fit is better , and follows more the trend of the simulation results .",
    "the best fit parameters obtained in this study are @xmath114 , @xmath115 and @xmath116 ( in contrast with @xmath41 , @xmath42 and @xmath43 found by tanemura @xcite ) .",
    "the improvement relative to the simple ( [ 3d ] ) approximation is however again not spectacular , and is relevant only in the limit of very large or very small voronoi cells .",
    "these limits does not appear usually in real experimental data , due to the fact that a much weaker statistics is achieved ( patterns with less than @xmath117 cells are studied ) .",
    "on the figure it is also plotted ( point - dashed line ) the form of the cumulative distribution function @xmath118 . on the scale of the image there is no detectable difference in the cumulative distribution function determined from simulation and the forms ( [ 3d ] ) or ( [ gamma ] ) .    by using ( [ 3d ] )",
    "the important moments are analytically calculable : @xmath119 .",
    "the most probable normalized volume is @xmath120 . for the second moment",
    "the relative error respective to the analytical exact results ( @xmath121 ) is @xmath122 .",
    "the gamma - fit for the simulation data yields @xmath123 ( @xmath124 ) while tanemura s fit seems better yielding @xmath125 ( @xmath126 ) .",
    "the second moment computed directly from simulation data is @xmath127 , giving the @xmath128 relative error .    in agreement with the simulations of tanemura",
    "@xcite we have also found that the values @xmath44 suggested by kiang @xcite are not appropriate and give no good fit to our simulation data .",
    "motivated by the simple form of the exact result ( [ 1d ] ) for the size distribution function of poisson voronoi cells in 1d we proposed simple expressions for approximating the distribution in 2d and 3d where no exact results are available . exceeding the statistics considered in all previous studies computer simulations were used to investigate numerically the distribution function .",
    "it was shown that a simple form ( [ fit ] ) with @xmath50 is appropriate for all practical applications to approximate the size - distribution of the poisson voronoi cells . in 1d",
    "the exact results gives @xmath129 . in 2d and",
    "3d we found that @xmath130 and @xmath131 , respectively , gives fair approximation .",
    "the simple values suggested for @xmath50 allows also to write in a compact form the approximations ( [ 2d ] ) and ( [ 3d ] ) .",
    "if we denote by @xmath0 the dimensionality of the problem ( @xmath1 ) , the value of @xmath27 can be given as @xmath132 . equations ( [ 1d]),([2d ] ) and ( [ 3d ] ) can be written then in a compact form as : @xmath133 this distribution function is not an exact one and it is less accurate than a more complicated three parameter fit given by the generalized gamma - function . mathematicians will probably not appreciate it ... but due to it s simplicity it will definitely be of importance for experimental scientist studying and characterizing complex voronoi diagram - like patterns .",
