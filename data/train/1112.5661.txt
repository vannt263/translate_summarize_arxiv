    "multi - component superconductivity models , developed more than fifty years starting from the papers [ ] , include rather varied physics . in connection with the presence of interacting order parameters",
    "the main properties of the multi - band systems are quite different from the corresponding characteristics in single - band superconductors .",
    "the examination of theses peculiarities has been an object of growing interest .    the various multi - component theoretical scenarios have been applied for a number of superconducting materials ( see refs . [ ] and references therein ) .",
    "the research activity in this direction has been especially stimulated by the acceptance of the multi - gap superconductivity in mgb@xmath1 @xcite , cuprates @xcite and iron - arsenic compounds @xcite . in particular ,",
    "the derivation of high - quality superconducting regions from oxygen ordering , observed recently in la@xmath2cuo@xmath3 @xcite , supports the multi - band theoretical scenario of superconductivity in cuprates .    in the present contribution we study the coherency of the superconducting ordering of a two - band ( two - orbital ) system with the negative-@xmath0 hubbard intra - orbital pairing and inter - orbital pair - transfer interaction .",
    "one can distinguish here two characteristic length scales @xcite in the spatial behaviour of superconducting fluctuations .",
    "one of these lengths as a function of temperature behaves critically diverging at the phase transition point .",
    "the other one remains finite and its temperature dependence is weaker .",
    "the formation of these length scales is caused by the interband interaction mixing the superconducting order parameters of initially non - interacting bands . as a result",
    "the critical and non - critical coherence lengths associate with critical and non - critical fluctuations ( see e.g. refs . [ ] ) which appear as the certain linear combinations of the deviations from the equilibrium band superconducting orders .",
    "consequently , these length scales can not be attributed to different bands involved @xcite ( see also refs . [ ] ) .",
    "our results have been obtained using the superconducting negative-@xmath0 hubbard model@xcite for a two - orbital system on a two - dimensional lattice .",
    "we start with the hamiltonian of the two - orbital model@xcite of the following form : @xmath4a_{i\\alpha\\sigma}^{+}a_{j\\alpha\\sigma } \\nonumber \\\\ & + & \\frac{1}{2}\\sum_{\\alpha}\\sum_{i}\\sum_{\\sigma}u^{\\alpha\\alpha } n_{i\\alpha\\sigma}n_{i\\alpha-\\sigma}\\nonumber \\\\ & + & \\frac{1}{2}\\sum_{\\alpha,\\alpha'}^{,}\\sum_{i}\\sum_{\\sigma}u^{\\alpha\\alpha'}a_{i\\alpha\\sigma}^{+}a_{i\\alpha'\\sigma } a_{i\\alpha-\\sigma}^{+}a_{i\\alpha'-\\sigma } \\ , , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath5 ( @xmath6 ) is the electron creation ( destruction ) operator in the orbital @xmath7 localized at the site @xmath8 ; @xmath9 is the spin index ; @xmath10 is the hopping integral ; @xmath11 is the orbital energy ; @xmath12 is the chemical potential ; @xmath13 is the intra - orbital attraction energy ; @xmath14 is the particle number operator ; @xmath15 with @xmath16 is the inter - orbital interaction energy .",
    "the transformation of the hamiltonian ( eq . [ 1 ] ) into the reciprocal space leaves us with the expression @xmath17a_{\\alpha\\mathbf{k}\\sigma}^{+}a_{\\alpha\\mathbf{k}\\sigma } \\nonumber   \\\\ & + & \\frac{1}{2n}\\sum_{\\alpha,\\alpha'}\\sum_{\\mathbf{k},\\mathbf{k}'}\\sum_{\\mathbf{q}}\\sum_{\\sigma}u^{\\alpha\\alpha ' } a_{\\alpha(\\mathbf{k}+\\mathbf{q})\\sigma}^{+ } a_{\\alpha'\\mathbf{k}\\sigma } \\nonumber \\\\ & \\times & a_{\\alpha(\\mathbf{k}'-\\mathbf{q})-\\sigma}^{+}a_{\\alpha'\\mathbf{k}'-\\sigma }   \\ , , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath18 is the electron band energy with a wave vector @xmath19 , associated with the orbital @xmath20 and @xmath21 is the number of lattice sites ( number of atoms ) .    for the description of spatially homogeneous superconductivity one introduces the equilibrium mean - field hamiltonian ( the terms which do not contain operators have been omitted ) @xmath22 with @xmath23 here the average number of electrons per site @xmath24 determines the position of the chemical potential @xmath12 and @xmath25 denotes averaging procedure , where @xmath26 is a partition function , @xmath27 is the boltzmann constant , and @xmath28 is temperature .",

    "+    the superconducting gaps as temperature functions are shown in fig . 2 for various inter - orbital interactions and band fillings .",
    "note that for fairly low temperature ( @xmath44 ) , @xmath45 and @xmath46 are simultaneously scaled by different intra - orbital interactions @xmath47 ( @xmath48 ) and the density of states around the chemical potential @xmath12 ( dependent on band filling which was here @xmath49 or 0.75 ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the influence of @xmath40 is visible in the vicinity of @xmath35 .",
    "the stronger @xmath40 , the larger @xmath45 .",
    "this is a consequence of the `` inter - orbital proximity effect '' .",

    "the soft or critical coherence length @xmath82 diverges at the phase transition point @xmath83 , while the rigid or non - critical coherence length @xmath84 remains finite ( see fig .",

    "for fairly small inter - orbital interaction @xmath85 one can notice that @xmath86 shows the second maximum ( see the peak of @xmath86 in fig .",

    "3c ) as the memory about the lower transition temperature in the intependent orbital ( the one with smaller intra - orbital attraction ) .",
    "such a behaviour is absent for stronger inter - orbital interaction .",
    "additionally , it is worth to notice that the coherence length is much larger for @xmath87 that for @xmath49 ( see figs .",
    "3a , b and 3c , d respectively ) .",
    "this is again the effect of the density of states .",
    "evidently , van hove singularity@xcite scales strongly @xmath35 and other superconducting parameters including the coherence length .",
    "we considered two orbital superconductor with a small interaction coupling producing possibility of the copper pair transfer between orbitals .",
    "the system have been modelled by the negative-@xmath0 hubbard model on the two dimensional lattice .",
    "the obtained two values of the coherence lengths reflects the multi - orbital mechanism of superconductivity and could have some consequence in specific spatial properties of such a complex supeconducting state @xcite    our results show that band filling strongly effects on the coherence lengths .",
    "especially , van hove singularity present in the density of states plays an important role in scaling the coherence lengths .",
    "the temperature dependence of the coherence lengths in our lattice model confirms the similar calculations in the continuous system@xcite .",
    "one solution diverges near the phase transition point , while the other one is non - critical .",
    "the non - monotonic temperature dependence of coherence lengths is more pronounced if the inter - orbital coupling is sufficiently weak .",
