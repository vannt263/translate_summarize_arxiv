    "in @xcite , the first author introduced the notion of a _ topologically minimal _ surface , as a generalization of incompressible @xcite , strongly irreducible @xcite , and critical @xcite surfaces .",
    "such surfaces have a well - defined _ index _ , where incompressible , strongly irreducible , and critical surfaces have indices 0 , 1 , and 2 , respectively .",
    "the term  topologically minimal \" was chosen because in many ways , such surfaces behave like geometrically minimal surfaces , i.e.  surfaces that represent critical points for the area function .",
    "similarities between the two types of surfaces are made explicit in e.g.  @xcite and @xcite , and one of the goals of the present paper to present further similarities .",
    "a useful fact about topologically minimal surfaces is that they can be isotoped into a standard normal form with respect to a triangulation .",
    "this was first done by kneser @xcite and haken @xcite in the index 0 case , rubinstein @xcite and stocking @xcite for closed index 1 surfaces , and @xcite for index 1 surfaces with boundary .",
    "the general case of arbitrary index is addressed by the first author in @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "the following theorem summarizes these results :    [ global2local ] let @xmath0 be a compact , orientable , irreducible , triangulated 3-manifold with incompressible boundary . then for each @xmath1 there exists a finite , constructible set of surfaces in each tetrahedron of @xmath0 from which one can build any index @xmath1 topologically minimal surface in @xmath0 ( up to isotopy )",
    ".    the pieces from which index @xmath1 surfaces can be built by theorem [ global2local ] can be quite complicated .",
    "however , in @xcite the first author gives a relatively simple characterization of those components that are simply connected : such pieces are either triangles or helicoids ( see figure [ f:16-gon ] ) .",
    "we say any surface built entirely from such pieces is _ locally helical .",
    "_    @xmath2{16-gon.eps}\\ ] ]    helical pieces are classified by their _ axis _ ( see section [ s : axis ] ) and _ twisting . _",
    "if @xmath3 is a helicoid then the number of normal arcs comprising @xmath4 is @xmath5 , for some @xmath1 .",
    "the _ twisting _ of @xmath3 , denoted @xmath6 , is the number @xmath7 , where the sign is determined by the handedness of the helicoid and the orientation of the manifold ( see definition  [ def : twisting ] ) .",
    "if @xmath8 is a locally helical surface in a triangulated 3-manifold @xmath0 , then the _ net twisting _ of @xmath8 is the sum of the twisting of all of its helical pieces ( see definition [ d : nettwisting ] for a more precise definition ) .",
    "the _ total absolute twisting _ is the sum of the absolute values of the twisting of its helical pieces .",
    "note that if a surface has bounded total absolute twisting , then each helical piece has a bounded number of twists . if , on the other hand , the net twisting is bounded then there may be helical pieces with an arbitrarily large number of , say , positive twists , as long as there are also pieces with large numbers of negative twists .",
    "the results of @xcite and @xcite , taken together , imply the following :    [ t : boundedlength ] any topologically minimal surface with index @xmath1 that is isotopic to a locally helical surface is isotopic to one with total absolute twisting at most @xmath1 .",
    "the results mentioned above give a direct generalization of haken s normalization of incompressible surfaces @xcite . to see this",
    ", first note that by definition , an incompressible surface is index 0 . by theorem [ global2local ]",
    "such a surface can be isotoped to be locally topologically minimal . by incompressibility",
    ", we may assume that in this position it is locally simply connected .",
    "finally , by theorem [ t : boundedlength ] we conclude that the total absolute twisting must be 0 , which means that it is a collection of triangles and quadrilaterals .    for higher index",
    "locally helical surfaces , the situation may be more complicated , as there may be helicoids distributed across tetrahedra in @xmath0 .",
    "the main result of this paper is the following theorem , which says that the total absolute twisting outside of some prescribed set of tetrahedra @xmath9 constrains the net twisting inside @xmath9 .",
    "[ t : mainthm ] let @xmath0 be a closed , oriented , triangulated 3-manifold , and let @xmath9 be a set of tetrahedra in the triangulation of @xmath0 .",
    "let @xmath8 be a locally helical surface in @xmath0 such that the total absolute twisting of @xmath10 is at most @xmath1 .",
    "then the net twisting of @xmath11 is bounded , where the bound depends only on @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "three corollaries of this theorem are worth noting : where @xmath9 is a single tetrahedron of @xmath0 , where @xmath9 is exactly two tetrahedra , and where @xmath9 is the set of all tetrahedra in @xmath0 .",
    "let @xmath0 be a closed , oriented , triangulated 3-manifold , and let @xmath9 be a tetrahedron of the triangulation .",
    "let @xmath8 be a locally helical surface in @xmath0 such that the total absolute twisting of @xmath10 is at most @xmath1 .",
    "then the total absolute twisting of @xmath8 is bounded , where the bound depends only on @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "this follows since a bound on the net twisting of a surface in a single tetrahedron serves as a bound for its absolute value .",
    "let @xmath0 be a closed , oriented , triangulated 3-manifold , and let @xmath12 be a pair of tetrahedra in the triangulation of @xmath0 .",
    "let @xmath8 be a locally helical surface in @xmath0 such that the total absolute twisting of @xmath13 is at most @xmath1",
    ". then @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is bounded by a function of @xmath0 and @xmath1 .    in other words ,",
    "if , in a sequence of surfaces with bounded total absolute twisting outside of @xmath16 , the number of left - handed twists in @xmath17 is growing , then so must be the number of right - handed twists in @xmath18 .",
    "this brings to light a striking resemblance between topologically minimal surfaces and geometrically minimal surfaces , as described by colding and minicozzi in the following theorem :    any nonsimply connected embedded minimal planar domain without small necks can be obtained from gluing together two oppositely oriented double spiral staircases . moreover ,",
    "if for some point the curvature is large , then the separation between the sheets of the double spiral staircases is small . note",
    "that because the two double spiral staircases are oppositely oriented , then one remains at the same level if one circles both axes .",
    "the last corollary of theorem [ t : mainthm ] is when @xmath9 is the set of all tetrahedra in @xmath0 . in this case",
    ", our result makes no mention of total absolute twisting .",
    "let @xmath0 be a closed , oriented , triangulated 3-manifold , and let @xmath8 be a locally helical surface in @xmath0 .",
    "then the net twisting of @xmath8 is bounded , where the bound depends only on @xmath0 .    in the next section",
    "we characterize normal curves by their _",
    "type_. in section [ s : axis ] we characterize helical disks by their _",
    "axis_. finally , in section [ s : compatibility ] we define the _ compatibility class _ of a locally helical surface .",
    "those familiar with normal surface theory will find several of these notions familiar .",
    "the layering of these definitions parses the set of locally helical surfaces in @xmath19 more and more finely , imposing increasingly greater restrictions on how surfaces in the same class can intersect . taken all at once",
    ", these characterizations produce a finite set of _ consistency classes _ for locally helical surfaces in @xmath20 ) , which have just the properties needed to prove theorem  [ t : mainthm ] .",
    "in this section we consider the combinatorics of normal loops on the boundary of a tetrahedron . for a basic reference on normal surface theory ,",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite .",

    "then @xmath22 is normally parallel to a loop that is preserved by @xmath24 .    to begin , we claim that a normal loop of length at least four meets each pair of opposite edges of @xmath23 in the same number of points . one way to see",
    "this is by noting that the double cover of @xmath23 , branched over the vertex set , is a torus ( see figure  [ f : cover_of_a_tet ] ) .",
    "each edge of @xmath23 lifts to an essential loop on the torus , and each pair of opposite edges lifts to two parallel loops .",
    "now , as a loop @xmath22 of length at least four on @xmath23 also lifts to two essential loops on the torus , it must be the case that @xmath22 intersects opposite edges of @xmath23 in an equal number of points .",
