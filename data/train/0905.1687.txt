    "great strides have been made during the past decade in obtaining precise maps of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) temperature and polarization @xcite .",
    "yet there are still increasingly precise data to come @xcite .",
    "inflation @xcite , which has passed a number of tests so far , will be tested further @xcite , and we may begin to understand the physics responsible for inflation . moreover , there will be a number of different types of departures from the standard scenario that can be detected with new measurements .",
    "the cmb polarization pattern can be decomposed into a gradient component ( e modes ) and a curl component ( b modes ) @xcite .",
    "a given inflationary model makes specific predictions for the power spectra of these components .",
    "for example , if the model predicts no primordial gravitational waves , then there is no b mode at the cmb surface of last scatter .",
    "if there is a primordial gravitational - wave background with a sufficiently large amplitude , there will be b modes at the surface of last scatter at a detectable level @xcite , and with a characteristic power spectrum .",
    "since the post - recombination universe is transparent to the cmb , it is natural to assume that the polarization pattern that we see is the polarization pattern at the surface of last scatter .",
    "however , exotic mechanisms may rotate the linear polarization as it propagates through the universe .",
    "for example , if cosmic acceleration is due to a quintessence field @xmath0 , and if that field couples to the pseudoscalar @xmath1 of electromagnetism , then the time variation of @xmath0 leads to a rotation of the linear polarization by an angle @xmath2 @xcite . if @xmath0 is spatially homogeneous , then the rotation angle @xmath2 is uniform across the sky .",
    "in this case , there is a characteristic parity - violating eb correlation induced in the cmb polarization @xcite .",
    "null measurements of this effect constrain @xmath2 to be smaller than a few degrees @xcite .",
    "it may well be , however , that @xmath0 has spatial variations , in which case the rotation angle @xmath3 will vary with position @xmath4 on the sky @xcite .",
    "there may also be mechanisms involving coupling of photons to dark matter that cause a spatially - varying @xmath3 @xcite . in either case",
    ", the eb power spectrum would include the dependence on @xmath3 , which would differentiate this scenario from the uniform - rotation case .",
    "for example , the eb power spectrum even vanishes @xcite if @xmath2 has a dipolar variation across the sky , in which case the positive eb correlation on one half of the sky is cancelled by a negative eb correlation of equal magnitude on the other half .",
    "@xcite showed that the rotation angle @xmath3 can be reconstructed , as a function of position on the sky , from the _ measured _ polarization map . if primordial perturbations are assumed to be gaussian ( as predicted by inflation ) , then the rotation introduces a characteristic non - gaussian signal in the polarization map .",
    "measurement of this non - gaussian signal then provides the rotation angle . more specifically , if primordial perturbations are gaussian , then the spherical - harmonic coefficients @xmath5 and @xmath6 of the polarization map are statistically independent for different @xmath7 and @xmath8",
    ". however , the rotation introduces off - diagonal correlations , i.e. correlations between different @xmath9 pairs .    ref .  @xcite re - visited this proposal .",
    "the authors worked out the off - diagonal correlations that would be induced in the flat - sky limit , and evaluated numerically how well the small - angle analogues of the spherical - harmonic coefficients @xmath10 of the rotation angle could be measured with future satellite experiments like planck @xcite and cmbpol @xcite .    in this paper , we work out in more detail the full - sky formalism of ref .",
    "we write down the minimum - variance estimator @xmath11 for the rotation - angle spherical - harmonic coefficients that can be obtained from a full - sky cmb temperature / polarization map .",
    "we derive expressions for the variance with which the @xmath10 can be determined and show that they recover , in the large-@xmath12 limit , the correct flat - sky expressions . while a flat - sky analysis may be suitable if the rotation - angle power spectrum peaks at small scales , the full - sky formalism will be required to maximize the sensitivity in models , such as that in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the signal - to - noise peaks at low @xmath12 ( see , e.g. , fig .  1 in ref",
    ".  @xcite ) .",
    "there has also been growing attention recently to the possibility that there may be variations in fundamental fields over distance scales comparable to , or larger than , the horizon ( perhaps remnants of the pre - inflationary universe ) @xcite .",
    "observationally , these entail searches for departures from homogeneity / isotropy or departures from statistical homogeneity / isotropy in the cmb or large - scale structure @xcite .",
    "the full - sky formalism we present here can be used to search for the low-@xmath12 ( e.g. , @xmath13 ) moments of @xmath3 that may arise if @xmath0 has long - wavelength fluctuations , in addition to , or instead of , the higher-@xmath12 modes that can also be probed with a survey of a smaller region of the sky .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows . in ",
    "ii , we derive the temperature / polarization correlations induced by rotation . in  iii , we construct the complete set of quadratic estimators for the rotation of the cmb polarization that can be constructed from the cmb temperature and polarization maps .",
    "we also determine the variances with which these estimators can be measured with a full - sky cmb map .",
