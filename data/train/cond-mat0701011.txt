    "have been observed in well - characterized ce@xmath0fe@xmath1 samples .",
    "the superstructure reflections related to ( 0  0  3/2 ) were studied as function of temperature between 10  k and 300  k. furthermore , entire reciprocal planes were measured , using high - energy x - rays and image - plate technology , in order to identify additional superstructure reflections .",
    "this superstructure will be discussed in terms of its relation to the room - temperature structure and its interactions with the magnetic and electronic properties .",
    "ce@xmath0fe@xmath1 samples were grown by a self - flux technique.@xcite two types of samples were prepared for the present investigations .",

    "this polycrystalline material was pressed into the hole of a 3  mm diameter copper disk that measured 1.2  mm thick .",
    "both sides of the disk were covered with kapton foil to keep the powder in place .",
    "for single - crystal x - ray diffraction experiments , a plate - like single crystal with dimensions 3  x  2  x  0.5  mm@xmath18 was selected and attached to a flat copper sample holder .",

    "the difference is dominated by the decrease of the intensity of bragg reflections with increasing temperature due to thermal motion . additionally , the thermal lattice expansion yields small shifts of the reflections yielding differences in the patterns . beside these effects",

    "unfortunately , points away from the designated reciprocal plane are also recorded .",
    "depending on the dimensions of the reciprocal lattice and the tilting angles , reciprocal planes other than the designated plane will also intersect the ewald sphere .",
    "this limits the analyzable area of the recorded pattern and , accordingly , the maximum range of meaningful tilting angles .",
    "the diameter of the analyzable area is proportional to the radius of the ewald sphere given by the length of the wave vector of the incident x - rays .",
    "the use of high - energy x - rays significantly enhances this study because the relatively short wavelength corresponds to large a magnitude of the incident wavevector .",
    "a considerable amount of time was required to read out the image plate .",
    "therefore , the image plate was exposed during the full time of meshing both tilting angles rather than recording separate patterns at stepwise increments in the tilting angles .",
    "an additional advantage of this method is the opportunity to scan one tilting angle continuously , as only the second tilting angle needs to be changed stepwise .",

    "5 shows the result for selected superstructure reflections . the good agreement between the intensity of corresponding friedel - pair reflections indicates a properly chosen experimental geometry .",
    "the temperature - dependent data are well described by a power law .",
    "a transition temperature @xmath2  =  118@xmath32  k was consistently determined for all investigated reflections .",
    "this transition temperature is consistent with that observed in low - field magnetization measurements of the same sample .",
    "the transition temperature is slightly lower than for the samples in ref .",
    "the difference is likely caused by a small amount of a dopant .",
    "recently , for example , we have found that a doping by only 0.1% of al for fe causes a decrease in @xmath2 by about 10  k.@xcite +",
    "in ce@xmath0fe@xmath1 , a crystallographic superstructure was found below @xmath2  =  118@xmath32  k. in addition to the measurements described here , we have observed similar crystallographic superstructure reflections in recent neutron diffraction experiments as well as x - ray resonant magnetic scattering ( xrms ) studies , which will be presented elsewhere .",
    "however , it is worth emphasizing here that the sample penetration depth for all of these structural probes covers a large range from @xmath412  @xmath20 m in the xrms study at the ce-@xmath42 absorption edge , to 2.2  mm for the high - energy x - ray diffraction experiments , and up to few cm for the scattering of thermal neutrons , respectively .",
    "thus these experiments have probed the formation of the superstructure in different parts of the sample , from near - surface regions through the entire bulk . in all cases",
    "the widths of the superstructure reflections were similar to the widths of main reflections .",
    "this indicates that the superstructure forms with the same degree of perfection as the main crystal structure in every part of the sample .",
    "the intensity ratio between the superstructure and main reflections was consistent in all these studies . from these results",
    "it can be concluded that the superstructure is uniform throughout the entire ce@xmath0fe@xmath1 sample .",
    "we now turn to a discussion of the space group of the low - temperature superstructure as determined by an analysis of possible crystallographic subgroups of the room - temperature space group @xmath5 .",
    "the observed doubling of the unit cell in the hexagonal @xmath12 direction corresponds to a doubling of the length along the body diagonal in the rhombohedral lattice .",
    "only two subgroups of the space group @xmath5 are related to a doubling of the unit cell in the @xmath4 direction , the non - isomorphic subgroup ( a ) @xmath43 ( @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 ) and the isomorphic subgroups ( b ) @xmath5 ( @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46).@xcite the prime symbol (  ) denotes the subgroup .",
    "both subgroups ( a ) and ( b ) yield a general condition for ( @xmath47 ) reflections with @xmath48 which can be satisfied by the observed diffraction patterns considering the transformation @xmath49 .",
    "the subgroup ( a ) @xmath43 contains an additional general condition for ( @xmath50 ) reflections with @xmath51 and @xmath52 caused by the glide plane.@xcite however , the observed reflections violate this condition , e.g. reflections were present at ( 0  0  3/2 ) and ( 0  0  9/2 ) positions which would be ( 0  0  3 ) and ( 0  0  9 ) , respectively , in the notation of the subgroup . as result , only subgroup ( b ) is possible .",
    "all observed diffraction patterns are in agreement with this subgroup , @xmath5 ( @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 ) as space group for the low - temperature phase .",
    "the doubling of the unit cell in @xmath4 relates to a substitution of the symmetry element translation with the vector @xmath4 by a translation with the vector 2@xmath4 , which corresponds to twofold reduction of the symmetry .",
    "therefore , the transition from the room - temperature structure to the low - temperature superstructure can be described by a transition to a direct subgroup of the original space group of index two.@xcite    .[tab : tab1 ] wyckoff sites and atomic coordinates for the room - temperature phase in ce@xmath0fe@xmath1 and their transformation into the low - temperature phase .",

    "consequently , these sites split up into two new sites with a doubling of the number of free parameters for the atomic positions according to the index two of the subgroup .",
    "the situation is different for the original wyckoff site 9@xmath13 which transforms to the new wyckoff site 18@xmath15 . the new site symmetry @xmath59 is , by index two , lower than the original site symmetry @xmath60 .",
    "the missing symmetry element yields two new free parameters for the new wyckoff position , ( @xmath61 ) , in contrast to the fixed original wyckoff position , ( @xmath62),@xcite see table  1 .",
    "the observed intensity of superstructure reflections can be used for an order - of - magnitude estimate of the corresponding displacement of atoms from their room - temperature position with higher symmetry .",
    "the observed intensity ratio between the superstructure reflection ( 0  0  15/2 ) at @xmath10  =  110  k and the main reflection ( 0  0  6 ) at @xmath10  =  130  k , respectively , is roughly 4  :  9500 as shown in fig .  1 .",
    "this intensity ratio depends only on the @xmath55 position of the atoms because ( 0  0  @xmath28 ) reflections average structure features perpendicular to the @xmath55 direction .",
    "two different cases of atomic displacements are considered . in the first",
    ", the superstructure is caused by a displacement of only one atomic site , the fe site @xmath63 , for example .",
    "a relative displacement of @xmath30.005 r.l.u . along the @xmath55 direction",
    "is required to obtain the observed intensity ratio . in a second scenario ,",
    "all atoms are displaced in @xmath55 direction by an equal distance .",
    "the sense of direction for the displacement is chosen in such a manner that the intensity ratio is maximized .",
    "the result is a relative displacement of @xmath30.0002 r.l.u .",
    "these two cases represent roughly the upper and lower limit for atomic displacements related to the observed superstructure .",
    "these very slight changes in the crystal structure are consistent with the observed marginal changes of the main reflections .",
    "according to landau s theory , a phase transition described by a subgroup relation is consistent with a second order phase transition where a symmetry element is broken and an order parameter starts to develop.@xcite the atomic displacement must follow the temperature dependence of the intensity , because the intensity of superstructure reflections depends quadratically on the value of the atomic displacement .",
    "hence the atomic displacement can be considered as the order parameter of this phase transition .",
    "it starts at the transition temperature without a jump .",
    "therefore , no abrupt re - arrangement of atoms is necessary to originate the observed behavior around the phase transition .",
    "it can be described as a diffusion - less movement of atoms consistent with a second order phase transition .",
    "as discussed in the introduction , the magnetic properties of ce@xmath0fe@xmath1 seem particularly sensitive to small changes in chemistry and structure .",
    "the magnetic and electronic properties can be influenced in several manners by the observed crystallographic phase transition .",
    "we now consider the effect of the change in local symmetries and of the additional freedom in atomic positions as well as the consequences of the doubling of the unit cell .",
    "a lowering of the site symmetry is associated with a lowering of the symmetry of the crystal - electric field for the atoms on this site . however , only minor changes in the magneto - crystalline anisotropy are expected because crystal - electric field effects are less important in ce@xmath0fe@xmath1 .",
    "more relevant for the magnetism , is the splitting of original single wyckoff sites into pairs of wyckoff sites .",
    "the related doubling of the number of free parameters for the atomic positions yields changes in the distance and angle between magnetic neighbor atoms which can , in principle , affect the strength of the magnetic exchange.@xcite this can be important for ce@xmath0fe@xmath1 in light of the delicate balance between antiferromagnetic and ferromagnetic interactions .",
    "for example , for the fe atoms originally located on the wyckoff site 9@xmath13 , the effect is not only quantitative , it is qualitative due to the change in the local symmetry at the phase transition .",
    "for the room - temperature structure , these atoms are located on a two - fold rotation axis .",
    "thus , neighbor atoms are pairwise symmetry - coupled , and the distances between them are equal .",
    "this condition is lost in the low - temperature structure , and the distances between these neighboring atoms are different . consequently , the strength of the magnetic exchange between these neighboring atoms is no longer equal , possibly leading , in some cases , to a change in sign of the magnetic exchange .    in the low - temperature phase ,",
    "the doubling of the unit cell along the hexagonal @xmath4 direction in real space halves the brillouin zone in @xmath64 direction , and the shape of the brillouin zone changes accordingly , because the dimension in @xmath64 direction is now much smaller than in other directions .",
    "this is evidenced in fig .",
    "4 by the smaller distances along the @xmath64 direction between reflections , normal and superstructure reflections together , in comparison to other directions .",
    "modifications of the electronic band structure , associated with the opening of a new superzone gap , can be expected and can result in changes in the transport properties . indeed , in measurements of the electric conductivity on ce@xmath0fe@xmath1 single crystals , a strong increase in resistivity was observed below the transition temperature @xmath2.@xcite this increase is strongly anisotropic ; it is much larger for the current flowing parallel to the @xmath4 direction than for the current flowing perpendicular to the @xmath4 direction .",
    "a detailed description of this effect consistent with the formation of anisotropic superzone gaps is given in ref .",
    "it should be mentioned , that the crystallographic phase transition occurs in the antiferromagnetically ordered state with an incommensurate propagation vector in @xmath64 direction .",
    "both superstructures , the crystallographic superstructure and the antiferromagnetic superstructure , can yield superzone gaps and , therefore , can cause the change in resistivity at the phase transition temperature @xmath2 . in break - junction measurements ,",
    "the differential conductance exhibits gap features associated with the low - temperature phase below @xmath2.@xcite remarkably , features were determined at two energy scales 12 - 14  mev and 26 - 32  mev on a polycrystalline sample at @xmath10  =  4.2  k. this could be related to the existence of two different gap features probably caused by the changes in the crystal structure and in the magnetic order .",
    "in addition to generating superlattice reflections , the change in the chemical unit cell below @xmath2 also modifies the description of the magnetic order in reciprocal space and , accordingly , the pattern for magnetic scattering . in neutron powder experiments , satellite reflections related to the antiferromagnetic structure with an incommensurate propagation vector in the hexagonal @xmath64 direction",
    "were observed below @xmath16.@xcite below @xmath2 additional satellite reflections were observed , which could be indexed with the same propagation vector , but starting from the reference position ( 0  0  3/2 ) .",
    "the crystal superstructure determined in the present publication yield new lattice points at just such positions .",
    "therefore , the results of the earlier neutron scattering experiments@xcite can be reinterpreted as the observation of magnetic satellite reflections according to the same incommensurate propagation vector based upon the lattice of the new superstructure .",
    "accordingly , the number of pairs of observed antiferromagnetic satellite reflections is doubled below @xmath2 in comparison to the number above @xmath2 .",
    "based on these results , additional information can now be extracted from the neutron powder diffraction patterns of ce@xmath0fe@xmath1 measured under isotropic pressures up to 5  kbar.@xcite at ambient pressure , a ferromagnetic state was observed in this sample .",
    "possible reasons for this different magnetic state are related to sample preparation and discussed in ref .",
    "an antiferromagnetic state can be induced by pressures higher than 3  kbar at @xmath10  =  40  k.@xcite two groups of antiferromagnetic satellite reflections appear .",
    "the first group consists of satellite reflections related to an incommensurate propagation vector similar to those observed for antiferromagnetic order at higher temperatures at ambient pressure .",
    "the second group of reflections were indexed with a new , different incommensurate propagation vector.@xcite however , these new satellite reflection at 2@xmath22  @xmath41  11  deg . shown in fig .",
    "11 of ref .",
    "@xcite can be indexed by ( 0  0  3/2)@xmath65 .",
    "all new satellite reflections can be indexed in the same way as the low - temperature antiferromagnetic phase discussed in the present work .",
    "this reinterpretation is supported by the pressure dependence of the positions of these reflections , the ( 0  0  3/2)@xmath65 reflection moves in the opposite direction to the ( 0  0  0)@xmath66 reflection .",
    "this suggests that the ferromagnetic - antiferromagnetic phase transition at a pressure of 3  kbar is connected with the appearance of a similar superstructure as observed in ce@xmath0fe@xmath1 samples , which show an antiferromagnetic state at low temperatures at ambient pressure .",
    "in conclusion , a superstructure was observed in ce@xmath0fe@xmath1 , which appears below @xmath2  =  118@xmath32  k in the antiferromagnetically ordered state .",
    "it can be described by a doubling of the unit cell in hexagonal @xmath4 direction and the same space group @xmath5 as the room - temperature structure .",
    "the second order phase transition is realized by a diffusion - less movement of atoms .",
    "the additional freedom in atomic positions and the change in local symmetry for the fe atoms at the original wyckoff sites 9@xmath13 can influence the magnetic behavior due to the delicate balance between antiferromagnetic and ferromagnetic interactions which are strongly dependent on the distance between neighbor fe atoms .",
    "the halving of the brillouin zone in @xmath64 direction can cause a superzone gap in the electronic structure , which is consistent with observations of an anisotropic increase in the electric resistivity below @xmath2 .",
    "additional antiferromagnetic satellite reflections observed in former neutron diffraction experiments can be conclusively related to the appearance of the crystallographic superstructure .",
