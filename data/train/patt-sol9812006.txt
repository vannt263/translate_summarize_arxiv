    "recent years have seen a considerable growth in the interest for nonlinear partial differential equations with soliton solutions .",
    "the most important and very well studied equations are the korteweg - de vries equation with serveral of its modifications , the sine - gordon equation and the nonlinear schrdinger equation ( nlse ) . historically , the first person who observed a solitary wave was the scotsman j.s .",
    "russell @xcite .",
    "he discovered on the edinburgh - glasgow channel that a large solitary ` heap of water ' , as he calls this phenomenon , moves over a very long distance without been dispersed .",
    "the equation of motion to describe these waves in shallow water was first found by d.j .",
    "korteweg and g.  de vries in 1895 @xcite .",
    "after this it took some time , until 1967 , when c.s .",
    "gardener , j.m .",
    "greene , m.d .",
    "kruskal and r.m .",
    "miura @xcite showed that the korteweg - de vries equation can be solved analytically with the so - called inverse scattering theory ( ist ) .",
    "moreover , it was also possible to solve the sine - gordon equation and the nlse with the aid of the same method @xcite .",
    "in the present paper we study the nlse which appears with its variants in problems drawn from disciplines as diverse as optics , solid state , particle and plasma physics .",
    "there , the nlse describes phenomena such as modulational instability of deep water waves @xcite , propagation of heat pulses in anharmonic crystals , helical motion of very thin vortex filaments , models of protein dynamics @xcite , nonlinear modulation of collisionless plasma waves @xcite , transmission of pulses through junctions in optical fibers @xcite , and self - trapping of light beams in optically nonlinear media @xcite . in the last decade",
    "the optical communication via solitons has become a field of special interest @xcite . in all these applications ,",
    "the main interest is due to the fact that the nlse is the most fundamental model which describes the interplay between weak dispersion and nonlinearity for a wave envelope .",
    "the existence of soliton solutions is one consequence of this .",
    "these are solitary waves with well defined pulse - like shapes and remarkable stability properties @xcite .",
    "a great deal of current interest is directed to the question how solitons behave under the influence of external perturbations @xcite .",
    "the perturbations describe e.g.  various dissipative effects , inhomogeneities of a medium or effects of external fields . they can be naturally divided into two classes : hamiltonian and dissipative .",
    "unfortunately , most of them destroy the integrability of the nlse .",
    "but in many cases , the perturbations are small and the techniques of analytical perturbations theory can be applied to extract some results .",
    "perturbation - induced effects are of interest mainly because they represent physical phenomena that can not be comprised by exactly integrable models .    here",
    "we shall limit ourselves to such perturbations which can be described by potentials .",
    "they preserve the hamiltonian structure of the nlse @xcite , but not its complete integrability .",
    "more precisely , we shall consider the one - dimensional nlse with external potentials which are constant outside a finite interval .",
    "thereby we emulate the effect of an interface with finite width between two different media in which the solitons have different characteristics .",
    "we study initial conditions consisting of one single soliton which moves towards the interface . there",
    "it will interact and , in general , it will not just be transmitted or reflected .",
    "instead , we expect that the soliton will also undergo inelastic scatterings where it breaks up either into several solitons or into nonsolitary waves , or both .",
    "this problem has been studied previously by several authors .",
    "while perturbative approaches were used in @xcite , straightforward numerical integrations were made in @xcite .",
    "both approaches showed that the soliton behaves just like a newtonian particle if the force created by the potential is sufficiently weak .",
    "this is to be expected , but the problem what happens when the force is strong was not studied extensively .",
    "the problem with discontinuous potentials is considered in @xcite , where the main interest was broken conservation laws and soliton tunneling . in @xcite",
    "the authors have studied the behavior of the soliton scattering at a potential ramp only qualitatively .",
    "the main goal was the successful application of higher order symplectic integrators to the nlse .",
    "the spatial inhomogeneity considered in @xcite was more complicated , because the authors allowed also a discontinuity in the nonlinear part .",
    "that lead to a different behavior of the scattered solitons .",
    "it is one purpose of the present paper to study the potential ramp @xcite in a more quantitative and systematical way .",
    "the main reason to investigate this kind of external potential was the fact that it reveals a very interesting feature .",
    "namely , while for most parameter values of the slope and the hight of the potential the soliton behaves as expected in a  particle - like \" manner , for special sets of parameters the soliton shows decidedly inelastic properties . in particular , the nonlinear reflection and transmission coefficients of the mass and of the energy are shown to possess windows of behavior that are quite counter - intuitive at first sight .",
    "we find that as the width of the potential ramp is varied , the transmission coefficient abruptly drops from a finite non - zero value to near zero and then just as abruptly back to a value near 1 .",
    "this feature does not disappear if one smoothes the potential . only for very smooth potentials",
    "the behavior of the soliton equals more and more that of a newtonian particle in an equivalent potential .",
    "first we have compared some of our numerical results for the flat potential step with predictions by perturbation theory .",
    "they agree very well in the expected validation range .",
    "we also have extensively discussed the influence on the soliton parameters ( amplitude and velocity ) during the scattering process .",
    "there we come to the conclusion that the solitons escaping in both regions after the scattering are  amplified solitons \" .",
    "these are solitons whose amplitude is multiplied by some constant factor .",
    "their behavior was studied by kath and smyth @xcite who derived a formula to predict the amplitude oscillation period depending on the soliton parameters .",
    "this formula is applied to our data and is in quite good agreement with them .",
    "this article is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "we briefly summarize some basic relations and equations concerning the soliton solutions of the nlse and introduce our problem . a detailed discussion of the transmission coefficients is made in sec .",
    "there some simulations are compared with results from the perturbation analysis , as far as this is possible within its validity range . in sec .",
    "4 we take a closer look at the shape of the soliton after it is scattered at the inhomogeneity .",
    "an amplified soliton ansatz is made and the parameters of the corresponding solitary wave are determined . a summary and outlook",
    "is given in sec .",
    "5 . in the appendix",
    "the applied integration method ( symplectic integrators ) is shortly described .",
    "the advantage over the other explicit integration schemes commonly used in this field , such as runge - kutta or predictor - corrector methods , is explained .",
    "using appropriate units , we can write the nlse as @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the external potential . we shall use for the latter a piecewise linear ansatz , with @xmath2 for @xmath3 , @xmath4 for @xmath5 , and linearly rising for @xmath6 between 0 and @xmath7 , @xmath8 we call the negative @xmath6-axis region @xmath9 , while region @xmath10 is the region @xmath11 ( where @xmath12 .",

    ", we can always choose its amplitude as @xmath20 , without loss of generality .    among the infinitely many conserved quantities ( for @xmath21 ! )",
    "@xcite , the following three are of particular interest :    1 .   the mass or  number of quasi - particles \" @xmath22 which is conserved due to phase invariance ; 2 .",
    "the energy @xmath23 which is conserved due to time invariance ; 3 .",
    "and the momentum @xmath24 which is conserved due to translation invariance .    for the soliton given by eq.([soliton ] ) this yields    n & = & 2a , + p & = & vn + e & = & ( v^2/2-a^2/6)n + v n ,    where the average over @xmath1 is taken with weight @xmath25 as indicated by eq.([e ] )",
    ".    in the cases where the soliton retains its shape , the motion of the soliton can be understood as that of a newtonian particle moving in the presence of an effective potential @xcite .",
    "this assumption is valid when the force created by the external potential is sufficiently weak . in our case",
    "this is true when the local disturbance is small , i.e. @xmath26 or when @xmath27 in our case",
    ". then we can apply ehrenfest s theorem to get the effective potential describing the motion of the newtonian particle with mass @xmath28 and initial velocity @xmath17 .",
    "thus , in the case where the potential is much smaller than the kinetic energy of the particle @xmath29 we expect transmission with a final velocity @xmath30 .",
    "this follows from the energy conservation law and the assumption that the soliton remains entire and no radiation is emitted .",
    "this also predicts that there is no transmission if @xmath31 ( i.e. , @xmath32 ) and @xmath33 .",
    "but we will see that this is more or less the exception in our simulations and the true behavior will lead to unexpected windows in the transmission coefficients .    to get some more insight into the problem , let us first look at the motion of a newtonian particle with a shape @xmath34 in a potential ( [ pot ] ) .",
    "we define the centre of mass of the extended particle @xmath35 and derive an effective potential according to which the centre of mass is moving . starting from the equation of motion we get : @xmath36      & = & -{1\\over 2a}\\int_0^{x_0 } \\ ! { { \\mathrm d}x}\\ ; { v_0\\over x_0}|\\psi(x , t)|^2 \\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we have chosen the potential from eq .",
    "( [ pot ] ) .",
    "while this is still exact for solitary waves , we now approximate the wave function by an unperturbed soliton centered at @xmath37 .",

    "@xmath40 one sees that @xmath41 . in the upper limit @xmath42",
    "in which the potential becomes a step function the effective potential takes the form @xmath43 which agrees with the potential derived by nogami and toyama @xcite .    as one",
    "can easily see these functions are smooth sigmoids in contrast to @xmath1 .",
    "due to this it is possible that the soliton s centre of mass penetrates into the region @xmath10",
    "( i.e. , where @xmath44 ) although @xmath45 .",
    "because of the fact that the effective potential has no local minima the soliton can not be at rest at any place ( provided that @xmath46 ) .",
    "this statement does not hold if one also allows a change in the nonlinear term at the inhomogeneity @xcite .",
    "then it is possible that the soliton is trapped in the vicinity of the inhomogeneity .",
    "within our simulations we have intensively studied the transmission coefficients of the mass , the momentum , and the energy .",
    "we found that they strongly depend on the geometry of the external potential .",
    "especially the slope of the ramp has a very strong influence on them , which is not expected for the equivalent particle method @xcite . for the integration we used a fourth order symplectic integration algorithm @xcite which",
    "is described in the appendix .",
    "we measured the mass @xmath47 and the energy @xmath48 in each region ( @xmath49 ) separately .",
    "notice that @xmath50 and @xmath51 are conserved even in the presence of a nonconstant potential @xcite .",
    "thus , they are of special importance among the infinite numbers of conserved quantities in the case where the potential is constant @xcite . accordingly , we can define two sets of transmission and reflection coefficients .",
    "we call them @xmath52 and @xmath53 , @xmath54 and @xmath55 a physical interpretation of @xmath56 can be the following : if @xmath50 is the number of quasi - particles of the incoming soliton , then is @xmath56 the quantity of quasi - particles penetrating the potential ; resp . is @xmath57 the energy of these quasi - particles .",
    "another quantity of interest is the momentum .",
    "it is only conserved for a constant potential ; otherwise the translation invariance is broken .",
    "nevertheless the momentum of the transmitted and reflected wave can be defined in the same way @xmath58 due to nonconservation , in general we have @xmath59 .",
    "all these coefficients are functions depending on the incident velocity @xmath17 of the soliton , the height @xmath13 and the length @xmath7 of the potential ramp",
    ". our main interest lays in the detailed dependence on these parameters .",
    "thus , we numerically evaluate the coefficients for a few initial velocities of the soliton varying the length and the height over a wide range .",
    "primarily , we will study these coefficients in a parameter range where the perturbation approach is not valid . only very few works in this field",
    "have dealt with perturbations which are of the same order as the energy of the soliton . up to now the only way to get some insight is to simulate the nlse numerically .    in the following simulations we used @xmath60 , and @xmath20 .",
    "hence the initial soliton takes the form @xmath61\\right\\}^{-1 } e^{i\\ , v_0\\ , x}\\,,\\ ] ] where the offset @xmath62 is the position of the soliton at @xmath63 .",
    "the kinetic energy of the soliton is , according to eq .",
    "( [ e ] ) , @xmath64 .",
    "in addition to the transmission and reflection coefficients we also registered all local maxima of @xmath65 with @xmath66 .",
    "the threshold was chosen in such a way that no essential information is lost , but small radiation and the noise which is produced due to the numerical integration are not taken into account .",
    "let us first examine the potential step @xmath67 , because there it is possible to compare the numerically measured transmission coefficients with the results calculated by perturbation theory .",
    "these calculations are valid only in two situations : when the potential step is very low in comparison to the kinetic energy of the soliton , and when the potential is much higher than the kinetic energy ( reflection at a hard wall ) .    in the first case",
    "the soliton is transmitted nearly without loss of radiation .",
    "the determination of the transmission coefficient is based on the ist technique using a first order born approximation .",
    "i.e. , the velocity of the soliton is assumed to be constant during the scattering process .",

    "this corresponds to a transmission coefficient for the mass @xmath84 and for the energy @xmath85    the quanitative behavior of the transmission coefficients measured from our simulations is shown in fig .",
    "[ trans0 ] .",
    "the height of the simulated potential step ranges from almost @xmath86 to about three times the kinetic energy of the soliton .",
    "the transmission coefficients fill monotonously the range from 1 to 0 .",
    "we want to point out that the value of @xmath57 is always larger than @xmath56 .",
    "this is due to the fact that the kinetic energy is larger than the internal binding energy of the soliton ( @xmath87 ) .    in fig .",
    "[ trans0_small ] the result of perturbation theory ( [ tneps ] ) and ( [ teeps ] ) is compared with our numerically measured transmission coefficient @xmath56 for small parameters @xmath13 .",
    "due to ( [ inequ ] ) we expect that the perturbation theory is valid in a range @xmath88 in the present case .",
    "in fact , one sees a rather good agreement between the data and the first order perturbation theory for low step heights .",
    "the discrepancy for larger perturbations ( @xmath89 ) indicates that higher order perturbation theory would be necessary to predict the transmission of the soliton in this region more precisely .",
    "one has to bear in mind that the perturbation analysis assumes that the initial soliton does not break up and no soliton is reflected .    in the opposite case , where the soliton is reflected at very high potential steps ( @xmath90 ) , we find an exponential decay of the transmission coefficients ( see fig .  [ trans0_exp ] ) .",
    "all three transmission coefficients ( @xmath56 , @xmath57 , and @xmath91 ) show this exponential decay for @xmath92 .",
    "the exponential functions plotted in fig .  [ trans0_exp ] are fitted by hand .",
    "this simple behavior strongly suggests that one should be able to derive it analytically .",
    "up to now we did not yet succeed , but we are still working on this problem . intuitively it is clear that the higher the potential is the less quasi - particles penetrate into region @xmath10 .",
    "this amount of quasi - particles decreases exponentially with the penetrating depth of the soliton , because the tail of the soliton decays exponentially .",
    "therefore the amount of quasi - particles  pushed \" into and staying in region @xmath10 decreases exponentially with increasing @xmath13 .",
    "let us now study potential ramps for positive values of @xmath7 , i.e. potential ramps with finite slopes .",
    "our data show unambiguously that the slope has a strong influence on the scattering process . in the equivalent particle method @xcite , where the soliton is treated like a classical newtonian particle with mass @xmath50 and kinetic energy @xmath93",
    ", one would expect that the transmission coefficients remains constant when changing the length of the ramp .",
    "this would be due to the constant difference @xmath94 .",
    "but it turns out that this simple picture is not true in our case .",
    "bearing in mind that the transmission coefficients for a gaussian wave packet of the linear schrdinger equation being scattered at a potential ramp shows a dependence of the slope , too , this is not that remarkable .",
    "but the windows of reflection are .    in figure [ transne ] the transmission coefficient @xmath56",
    "are plotted for different slopes and heights of the ramp . a similar figure with less complete data",
    "was already shown in ref.@xcite . in the following",
    "we will show mainly data for a initial velocity @xmath95 without loss of generality .",
    "we also have simulated different initial velocities @xmath17 and have found very similar results .",
    "let us first shortly recapitulate the observations found in ref .",
    "@xcite concerning the global behavior of the transmission coefficient .",
    "after that we want to discuss the windows of reflection in a more detailed manner .",
    "the obvious stucture one observes is that the curves for @xmath96 tend to 0 if @xmath97 , while those for @xmath98 tend to 1 in this limit .",
    "this indicates that the equivalent particle method is valid in the limit of very flat ramps .",
    "if the kinetic energy of the soliton is smaller than the potential height , it will be totally reflected ; otherwise it will be totally transmitted .",
    "simulations with still flatter ramps , e.g.  @xmath99 ( not shown here ) , show that the transmission coefficients are equal to @xmath100 resp .",
    "@xmath86 within the error bars .",
    "another property is the nonmonotonic behavior of the transmission coefficients at steep ramps .",
    "all curves @xmath101 show a global maximum at @xmath102 .",
    "if @xmath13 is decreased below @xmath93 , the absolute maximum is reached in the limit @xmath103 ( that is 1 ) , but there is still a local maximum as long as @xmath104 . at some threshold this local",

    "[ transne ] this threshold is at @xmath105 for @xmath56 , while it happens at @xmath106 for @xmath57 @xcite .",
    "for all values of @xmath107 the position of this bump nearly stays at the same place .",
    "simulations with different initial velocities ( @xmath108 ) likewise show such a maximum resp .",
    "shoulder at @xmath109 .",
    "the fact that the maximum resp .",
    "the shoulder is located at a length of the ramp which is roughly equal to the width of the soliton , strongly suggests that this is a nonlinear resonance effect .",
    "a very similar behavior of the reflection coefficient was found by yu.s .",
    "kivshar _ et al . _",
    "@xcite for solitons scattered by a single impurity .",
    "besides the global maximum , the curves for high potentials ( @xmath110 ) show a slight shoulder at @xmath111 .",
    "this shoulder gets more and more pronounced if @xmath13 is decreased towards the magnitude of the kinetic energy ( @xmath112 ) . at the same time",
    "its position is shifted towards flatter slopes ( @xmath113 ) and the shoulder becomes sharper . in case the height reaches @xmath93 ( @xmath114 ) this shoulder is a dominating feature .    decreasing the potential further ( below @xmath93 , but still above some threshold @xmath115 ) , this shoulder continues to become sharper and more pronounced .",
    "indeed , it develops into a peak and the transmission coefficients begin to grow with @xmath7 before they rapidly drop to join a common curve .",

    "these authors have studied the effect of a local and attractive impurity which is such that the soliton can be captured , and the energy is stored in an internal mode .",

    "another difference is that the soliton is unbreakable in @xcite .",
    "thus , in contrast to our system , the soliton is either reflected or transmitted or captured ( in a state oscillating around the impurity ) and does not emit radiation .",
    "the authors of @xcite observe that the soliton may be reflected by the attractive impurity when its velocity lies in one of several windows . within our resolution",
    "we find only _ one _ window , where the soliton is reflected instead of being transmitted .",
    "there are no indications for further windows of reflection .    to understand this phenomenon in more detail",

    "[ v318 ] we show the local maxima of @xmath124 for @xmath125 . in this diagram",
    "one can directly compare the effect of different slopes on the movement of the soliton .",
    "let us begin with the steep ramp @xmath126 ( label 1 in the figure ) . here",
    "the soliton lowers its speed while it climbs the potential ramp . at the same time radiation",
    "is emitted in the forward and backward direction .",
    "the biggest amount of radiation is emitted at the lower part of the ramp and immediately forms a new soliton escaping in the backward direction .",
    "the slowing down process continues until @xmath127 and is accompanied with loss of radiation in the backward direction .",
    "after that the soliton moves with constant velocity in the forward direction .",
    "but its mass has shrunk to roughly 60% of its initial mass .    flattening the slope of the ramp",
    ", the velocity of the transmitted soliton reduces continuously . whereas its mass decreases only slightly .",
    "if the slope is @xmath128 the soliton interacts with the ramp until @xmath129 .",

    "the same holds for the steeper slopes described above .    flattening the slope a tiny bit more ( @xmath131 )",
    "the soliton nearly stops after penetrating in to region @xmath10 .",
    "it takes very long ( @xmath132 ) until the soliton decides in what direction to move on .",
    "one consequence is that more radiation is emitted into region @xmath9 while the soliton interacts with the inhomogeneity .",
    "the mass shrinks to roughly 40% , and it takes until @xmath133 that the soliton accelerates to full speed ( not shown in fig .  [ v318 ] )",
    ".    this behavior changes if the slope is again only slightly flatter .",
    "for @xmath134 the soliton moves with constant positive velocity already at @xmath135 .",
    "but its loss of mass due to radiation is much higher .",
    "the transmitted soliton has only roughly 33% of its initial mass .",
    "this loss creates _ more than one _ new soliton and nonsolitary waves escaping from the ramp in the backward direction .",
    "it is hard to distinguish between solitons and nonsolitary waves here , because the amplitudes are small and furthermore the amplitude oscillates with a very low frequency , which makes it hard to identify them as solitons . where the amplified solitons are discussed in more detail .",
    "] one should notice , that nonsolitary waves are created near the lower edge of the ramp at least until @xmath136 .",
    "the other waves are not plotted , because their amplitude is less than @xmath137 .",
    "as one can see from fig .",
    "[ time_tn ] the transmitted soliton continuously loses mass while it interacts with the potential ramp .",
    "this happens until it leaves the upper edge of the ramp and moves with constant speed again .",
    "if one looks closer at the traces of the transmitted soliton in fig .",
    "[ v318 ] one observes small bends at times @xmath138 200 , 350 , 500 and 650 .",
    "it looks as if the soliton s maxima are oscillating around a true trace .",
    "this frequency corresponds exactly to the oscillation period of the amplitude of those solitons .",
    "more precisely this means that the apparent bend in the trace occurs when the transmitted soliton is maximally sharp .",
    "this can be explained in the following way : the soliton is stretched when it climbs up the ramp , which causes the amplitude to be reduced .",

    "this is the reason why the speed of the soliton increases at the same time . for slopes",
    "@xmath140 the movement of the penetrating soliton is not monotonical .",
    "after it has come to a stop at @xmath141 it moves back before it stops again and escapes in the forward direction .",
    "e.g.  let us look at the situation with @xmath142 : at @xmath141 the soliton becomes wider , which can be concluded by comparing the oscillations of the other traces shown in fig .",
    "[ v318 ] . due to this broadening its maximum is shifted towards region @xmath9 . during this process",
    "some of its mass is pushed down the ramp into region @xmath9 . that can be concluded from fig .",
    "[ time_tn ] where the curve shows a drop at @xmath143 , after it had seemed to converge to a value larger than that for @xmath128 .",
    "after some part of the soliton has separated from the bulk it accelarates away from the ramp while it contracts again .",
    "for @xmath144 the soliton penetrates into region @xmath10 , but is reflected at the top edge of the ramp .",
    "this is consistent with the collective - coordinate description ( see eq.([veff ] ) ) .",
    "the reflected soliton consists of roughly 96% of the initial mass .",
    "this scenario holds for flatter slopes , too , until @xmath145 . there",
    "the soliton is transmitted with roughly 95% of its initial mass and only few radiation is emitted .    for heights @xmath13 close to @xmath115 the first jump becomes sharper and finally as sharp as the second one .",
    "as already pointed out in our previous work @xcite the second upward jump can be explained easily : if there were no radiation ( as is the case for @xmath97 ) the energy of the soliton would be conserved , and the threshold for transmission would be strictly at @xmath146 .",
    "but for finite @xmath7 , the radiation implies that the soliton has lost energy when it reaches the upper end of the ramp , and it needs @xmath147 to be transmitted .",
    "thus there is a range @xmath148 where the soliton is reflected .",
    "since the soliton moves very slowly near the upper egde of the ramp for @xmath149 , the dependence of the transmission coefficients on the amount of radiation ( and thus also on @xmath7 ) is extremely sharp . to be more quantitative ,",
    "let us consider @xmath150 . here",

    "primes denote here observables at the moment when the soliton stops . if we neglect the forward radiation ( which seems to be indeed small according to figs .",
    "[ v318 ] ) , we have @xmath154 , @xmath155 and @xmath156 , and thus @xmath157 for @xmath158 . comparing this with the measured value 0.9837 we see good agreement .    within the window of reflection ,",
    "the time it takes until the point of return is reached is not the same for different slopes .",
    "this time becomes larger and larger the nearer the slope is to the border of the window .",
    "indeed , that is true for both borders .",
    "the reason for this is that the radiative loss of energy is equal to the difference @xmath159 .",
    "therefore the velocity of the temporarily transmitted soliton is very close to 0 .",
    "thus , the soliton stays during a long time in the vicinity of the egde of the ramp and can interact with it .",
    "this means that already tiny amounts of radiation can cause the soliton to turn back into region @xmath9 .",
    "the same argument holds when decreasing the difference @xmath159 .",
    "the smaller it is , the longer it takes until the soliton has decided whether to pass the potential ramp , or to fall back into region @xmath9 .    in order to exclude that the observed feature is due to the non - differentiability of the chosen potential , we have simulated smoother potentials , too .",
    "we found that the values of the transmission coefficients change only slightly if one uses instead of potential ( [ pot ] ) a more smooth sigmoid .",
    "even the shape of the windows with small transmission are still seen and they stay at the same positions",
    ". however , if the potential becomes too smooth ( e.g. such as functions like @xmath160 with @xmath161 ) , the soliton behaves as one expects for the equivalent particle method and only very little radiation is emitted .",
    "another observable we can look at are the momenta of the reflected and transmitted wave . although momentum is not conserved for nonconstant potentials , it is worth to have a closer look at it .",
    "if the wave function is only composed of a single soliton , its momentum is directly related to its velocity via eq.([p_class ] ) . in order to measure the momentum of one soliton within a system of several nonoverlapping solitons ,",
    "it is necessary to restict the integration interval ( in eq.([p ] ) ) around its position .",
    "if we neglect the momentum of the radiation , and if at most a single soliton is emitted in the forward and backward direction , it is sufficient to partition the @xmath6-axis into regions @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "that is what we have done .    as mentioned before , according to the equivalent particle method the transmitted momentum should not depend on the slope of the ramp .",
    "but what we observe is different , as already pointed out in the previous section .",
    "the global behavior of the transmission coefficient is the same as it is for the transmitted mass and energy . in fig .",
    "[ transp ] we see a ( local ) maximum at steeper ramps ( @xmath162 ) , which confirms the claim that this is a nonlinear resonance effect . in the limit @xmath97 the momentum tends to the value one expects for the equivalent particle method .",

    "due to the conservation of energy the reduced velocity is given by @xmath163 in the cases where @xmath164 .",
    "otherwise the soliton is reflected and the momentum of the transmitted solitary wave tends to zero .",
    "our results agree with this expected behavior for very flat ramps ( @xmath165 )",

    "the minimum at the upper end of the window tends to zero , and the same holds for the lower end if @xmath13 is not too close to @xmath93 .",

    ", the mass of the transmitted soliton stays nearly constant .",
    "this leads to the conclusion that the velocity of the transmitted soliton drops to almost zero at the edge of the window .",
    "this agrees with the observation made in fig .",
    "the dependence of @xmath91 inside the window is dominated by the mass of the transmitted solitary wave , because its velocity changes only slightly .",
    "it is conspicuous that all curves within the window match the exponentially decaying curve for @xmath184 .",
    "this confirms the conclusion that those transmitted solitary waves are universal in the sense that its mass , energy and momentum are independent of the height of the potential .",
    "after the soliton hits the potential ramp , we observed in general that it splits up and creates a transmitted and reflected soliton , which are both accompanied by some radiation ( see fig .",

    "the main part @xmath228 is transmitted , and the remaining part is reflected .",
    "most of the radiation is emitted in the backward direction .",
    "due to the birth of a second soliton the amplitude of the initial soliton is reduced by @xmath72 .",

    "thus , the amplitude decreases further and begins to oscillate in the manner seen in the figures .",
    "the reflected wave also forms such an amplified soliton .",
    "in addition , radiation is created as seen from the various decreasing and non - oscillating side maxima .    for flatter slopes of the ramp , amplified solitons fit well for times @xmath229 larger than one oscillation period of the amplitude .",
    "the early stages of the interaction can not be reproduced with this ansatz . in our simulations",
    "we observed that the amplitude oscillation is slightly compressed horizontally while the soliton is located in the rising part of the potential .",
    "this might be because of the transfer of energy into the radiation .",
    "the amplitude oscillations for the reflected soliton are less easy to compare .",
    "this comparison is possible for very steep ramps and rather high potentials . in those cases",
    "the reflected soliton has a larger amplitude than the nonsolitary wave emitted during the interaction .",
    "thus , effects due to interferences are rather small .",
    "if their amplitudes are of the same order , they strongly interfere and deform the shape of the amplified soliton . a way to avoid",
    "that problem is to wait very long until the radiation either has passed through the soliton or is dispersed . but",
    "this would require very long simulations .",
    "another problem is that in general the oscillation periods of the reflected soliton get very large which requires a very long simulation time , too .",

    "the interference is also the reason why the side - maxima of the radiation emitted by the amplified soliton are not reproduced correctly .",
    "the rest is quantitatively very well reproduced .    in summary ,",
    "each of the solitary waves after the scattering can be described as an amplified soliton , except for a very short time during the collision process .",
    "it is described by means of only two parameters : the reflected resp .  transmitted mass and the height of the soliton in the limit @xmath204 .",
    "since these states are not solitons at finite times , they emit radiation .",
    "this happens continuously and the amount radiated until a time @xmath231 is proportional to @xmath232 @xcite .",
    "indeed , we see that the amplitude of the linear waves does not decay exponentially @xcite . in the limit @xmath204 , the solitary waves converge to solitons with defined shapes .",
    "the total amount of radiation lost is simply @xmath233 but this means that the overall amount of radiation produced during the whole scattering process is in general much bigger than one might have supposed at first sight . for steeper ramps more than 10% of the mass and even slightly more of the energy",
    "is eventually radiated by the two amplified solitons leaving the ramp into two directions .",
    "summing up all effects we find that in cases where the potential is of the same order as the soliton s kinetic energy and the slope is steep , about one fourth of the initial mass and energy is radiated .",
    "otherwise the loss is smaller .",
    "the percentage of radiation decreases systematically with decreasing slope . in the limit of very flat ramps",
    "@xmath234 it tends to 0 .",
    "kath and smyth @xcite derived two formulas which estimates the period of the amplitude oscillations for an amplified soliton with shape  ( [ init : wave ] ) .",
    "for this , they used an alternative method to describe the time evolution of the soliton , namely a lagrangian approach @xcite .",

    "thus we can apply their formulas to our data to see how far they agree .    for small perturbations , it was shown in @xcite that the period of the amplitude oscillations is the same as that of the phase oscillations of the pure soliton at time @xmath235 : @xmath236 for finite perturbations @xmath237 , the same authors found ( using our notation ) @xmath238^{-{3\\over 2}}.\\ ] ] notice that this does not agree with eq.([td0 ] ) for @xmath239 , as the authors of @xcite already pointed out .",

    "@xmath242 and much larger values for @xmath243 .",
    "but the simple eq.([td0 ] ) shows a surprisingly good agreement for all data points in both cases .",
    "we could conclude from this that the disturbance of the soliton s amplitude we are dealing with seems to be not as large as expected .",
    "namely , in the sense that eq.([td0])****meant to be valid only for very small disturbances****predicts the correct time periods .",
    "this is astonishing , because we found an reduction of the soliton s amplitude up to 25% ! this would mean that the valitiy range of eq.([td0 ] ) is much larger than assumed in @xcite .",
    "in this paper we found that solitons break up in general when hitting a potential threshold .",
    "if the slope is very steep and the potential height is either very low or very high compared to the soliton s kinetic energy @xmath244 , the soliton acts like a newtonian particle .",
    "the same behavior is seen if the slope is rather flat @xmath245 for most values of @xmath13 .",
    "this includes the fact that in those cases only very little energy and mass is transfered into radiation . in such cases only one soliton with nearly constant height exists during the whole simulation time .",
    "the amplitude of this solitons shows small oscillations with a period , that is the period of the phase oscillation of the undisturbed soliton .",
    "the complexity of the outgoing state depends on the parameters of the potential and of the soliton , but most frequently the soliton breaks into two solitons of different mass .",
    "we have shown that these solitons can be described by amplified solitons whose parameters @xmath15 and @xmath72 can be evaluated from the data . additionally , the period of the amplitude oscillation can easily be calculated .",
    "the scattered solitons are accompanied by radiation , which is emitted continuously and whose amplitude decays proportional to @xmath246 in time for large times .",
    "the fact that the radiation decays only with a power law raises some problems with the transmission of information via optical fibers @xcite .    in some region of the ( @xmath7 ,",
    "@xmath13)-plane the soliton is almost fully reflected even if its kinetic energy is slightly larger than the potential .",
    "this is due to the emission of radiation .",
    "the energy of the soliton is reduced thereby , whence it can not overcome the ramp and is reflected .",
    "the associated jumps in the transmission coefficients are rather sharp and the slope where this happens depends on the hight of the potential .",
    "the window in slopes where the soliton is reflected shrinks if the height of the potential is lowered . at a critical value @xmath115",
    "this feature disappears and the transmission coefficients rise monotonically . as the potential height tends to the value of the soliton s kinetic energy , the right border of the window tends to @xmath247 .    in this paper",
    "we have mostly studied the nlse with an external potential that has the form of a linear ramp with variable hight and slope .",
    "we have applied an optimized fourth - order symplectic integrator in our simulations .",
    "the integrator is optimized in the sense that it takes into account the symplectic structure of the nlse and the fact that the kinetic energy is bilinear in @xmath248 .",
    "it has a very good long - time stability .",
    "it is very easy to apply this algorithm to nlses with other external potentials , such as one or more impurities , a series of step functions or any smooth function . in the same way",
    "other hamiltonian disturbances can be treated , e.g.  terms like @xmath249 . in order to study the collision of two solitons ( a fast one and a slow one ) or of three solitons ( a fast one crossing two interacting slow ones ) @xcite , an integrator with good long - time stability is needed .",
    "we believe that the integrator used in the present work can be very useful in further simulations of partial differential equations of such a type .",
    "this numerical method can also be easily and staightforward applied to the nlse with a varying nonlinear term or to higher dimensional and coupled nlses .",
