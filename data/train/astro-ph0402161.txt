    "the galaxies in a cluster account for less than 10% of its total mass .",
    "x - ray observations of the hot intracluster gas support the notion that most of the matter is distributed in a smooth , dark halo .",
    "it is of clear interest to use observations to deduce not only the total mass , but also the structure of this halo .",
    "for example , the logarithmic derivative of the density can be compared with n - body simulations of structure formation , allowing constraints on dark matter physics .",
    "these simulations show that the inner regions of halos composed of collisionless dark matter have power law density profiles @xmath14 with @xmath15 @xcite .",
    "however , if the dark matter particles interact through the weak or the strong force , constant density cores develop within a fraction of a hubble time @xcite .",
    "measurements of the slope @xmath0 in groups and clusters of galaxies are thus a potential a test of the collisionless nature of dark matter .    the methods for determining the masses of clusters fall into three broad categories : fluid dynamics , lensing , and stellar dynamics",
    ". the fluid dynamical methods , which rely on the x - ray properties of the intracluster medium , presuppose that the gas is either in hydrostatic equilibrium or in a time - independent cooling flow . because measuring the gas temperature involves complex modeling of x - ray spectra",
    ", these methods offer at best @xmath16 resolution elements across the brightest x - ray sources .",
    "furthermore , recent x - ray observations indicate that the central regions of cooling flow clusters can not be described self - consistently by the standard models , leaving the shape of the mass profile within @xmath17 kpc of the cluster center uncertain km s@xmath6  mpc@xmath6 . ]",
    "@xcite .",
    "lensing models detect either strong or weak gravitational deflection of the light from distant sources .",
    "strong lensing allows direct estimation of the surface mass density from the spectacular but rare giant arcs , e.g. cl0024 + 16 @xcite .",
    "weak lensing estimates depend on statistical reconstruction of the surface density from distortions in the shapes of field galaxies @xcite .",
    "these techniques are attractive because they make no assumptions about the equilibrium state of the cluster .",
    "however , they could suffer contamination from the large scale structure surrounding the cluster @xcite .",
    "this contamination may account for the disagreement between x - ray and lensing masses , and makes the determination of the true shape of the density profile difficult .",
    "stellar dynamical methods grow out of the century - old tradition , beginning with jeans and eddington , of modeling the structure of star clusters . here , instead of addressing a self - gravitating system of stars",
    ", one regards galaxies as point masses adrift in a larger sea of dark matter .",
    "the fundamental dynamical problem is then to calculate the spherically symmetric gravitational potential that causes the observed motions of the galaxies .",
    "obviously , the analogy to stellar systems is far from perfect ; the ratio of the size of a galaxy to that of its host cluster is typically @xmath18 15 kpc / 1.5 mpc @xmath19 , whereas for stars in a galaxy it is @xmath20 . as a result ,",
    "interaction cross sections are much larger in galaxy clusters .",
    "furthermore , although stellar systems contain as many as @xmath21 members , clusters rarely have more than @xmath22 luminous members , and the most abundant systems  groups of galaxies  have closer to @xmath23 @xcite .    still ,",
    "if correctly applied , stellar dynamics can trace the gravitational potential of clusters at the largest and smallest scales as well as the other available techniques .",
    "modeling of spherical infall patterns @xcite can map the mass profile outside @xmath24 mpc .",
    "the equilibrium models we consider are sensitive to the shape of the dark matter halo in the innermost regions of clusters and groups .",
    "the most popular equilibrium techniques make use of the moments of the data to constrain the depth or shape of the cluster potential . for example",
    ", the virial theorem yields an estimate of the total mass of the cluster @xcite : @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the line - of - sight velocity in the center of mass frame @xcite , @xmath27 is the redshift of the @xmath28th galaxy , @xmath29 is its projected distance from the cluster center , @xmath30 is the speed of light , and @xmath31 is newton s constant .    the velocity moments may also be used to infer the structure of the potential in greater detail , using either analytic galaxy distribution functions @xcite or the jeans equation for a collisionless stellar system @xcite , @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the true three - dimensional distance from the cluster center , @xmath34 is the number distribution of the galaxies , @xmath35 and @xmath36 are the tangential and the radial velocity dispersions , and @xmath37 is the gravitational potential . to interpret the data , one usually chooses a form for @xmath38 and the anisotropy parameter @xmath39 , and projects the solution to the jeans equation to obtain @xmath40 , the theoretical line - of - sight velocity dispersion profile .",
    "this profile may be compared with a real cluster by splitting the galaxies into radial bins and calculating @xmath41 in each bin .",
    "there are several disadvantages to using the velocity moments to constrain @xmath37 .",
    "first , the quality of the observed velocity dispersion profile @xmath40 is usually poor for clusters .",
    "even with several hundred velocities , dividing the galaxies into radial bins produces a noisy profile that is not very informative about the radial variation of @xmath42 .",
    "second , even in the ideal limit of a perfectly observed @xmath40 , vastly different combinations of @xmath38 and @xmath1 can yield similar solutions to equation ( [ eq : jeanstwo ] ) @xcite .",
    "third , even if a unique solution is possible ( e.g. , by assuming a constant mass - to - galaxy ratio , @xmath43 ) , there is no guarantee that the solutions satisfy the requirement that the phase space density of the member galaxies be everywhere positive or zero @xcite . finally , it is desirable to avoid binning the velocities altogether in order to make as powerful a use of the scarce data as possible .",
    "we therefore turn to maximum likelihood methods , which avoid some of the problems of the jeans equations as applied to discrete systems @xcite .",
    "constructing and maximizing a suitable likelihood function guarantees a positive definite galaxy phase space distribution .    here",
    "we apply the maximum likelihood method to nearby ( @xmath44 ) systems of galaxies .",
    "our goal is to derive joint constraints on @xmath37 and @xmath1 for poor groups of galaxies as well as for rich clusters . to this end",
    "we conduct deep optical observations of the rasscals x - ray emitting galaxy groups @xcite .",
    "we also assemble a catalog of published redshifts in 8 nearby relaxed clusters of galaxies (  [ sec : data ] ) . using these samples",
    ", we construct an ensemble group and ensemble cluster which serve to constrain the galaxy phase space distribution in each type of system (  [ sec : phase ] ) .",
    "this distribution then serves as a maximum likelihood estimator of the gravitational potential and of the orbital structure of the galaxy population .",
    "in particular , we calculate joint five - dimensional confidence volumes in the central anisotropy , central matter density slope , total mass , matter core radius , and interloper fraction (  [ sec : dynamics ] ) .",
    "we discuss the implications of our work (  [ sec : discuss ] ) and conclude (  [ sec : conclude ] ) .",
    "here we describe the data acquisition .",
    "first , we discuss our observations of primarily poor groups of galaxies . from these data",
    "we obtain a statistically complete sample of 2419 optical spectra in the fields of @xmath3  systems .",
    "we also assemble a redshift catalog of galaxies in relaxed rich clusters from the literature .",
    "our redshift measurement targets ( table [ tbl : groups ] ) are drawn from @xcite , who cross - correlate the center for astrophysics redshift survey with the rosat all - sky survey ( rass ) to construct the rasscals catalog .",
    "the rasscals are a statistically complete , redshift - selected sample of galaxy groups with at least 5 members brighter than a zwicky blue magnitude @xmath45 , comparable to a red magnitude @xmath46 .",
    "the groups lie within a redshift range @xmath47 km s@xmath6 , and have either x - ray luminosities or upper limits derived from the rass . the diffuse x - ray emission coincident with the detected groups",
    "suggests that they are physically bound systems of galaxies .    for this study",
    ", we select all x - ray emitting rasscals with right ascension @xmath48 , or @xmath49 and @xmath50 , and declination @xmath51 .",
    "we restrict ourselves to systems well away from the local supercluster , @xmath52 km s@xmath6 , and attempt to ensure that they are group - like by limiting ourselves to x - ray luminosities @xmath53 erg s@xmath6 .",
    "we also omit the @xcite compact groups 51 and 58 .",
    "in addition to this 93% complete sample of 30 x - ray emitting groups , we randomly select 11 groups without rass x - ray emission , all located within the same ( @xmath54 ) bounds .",
    "there are @xmath3  systems in all .",
    "to constrain the variation of the velocity dispersion , and hence the mass , with radius , it is necessary to identify group members to a large distance from the center of the gravitational potential .",
    "we therefore identify galaxies brighter than @xmath55 within 1.5 mpc of the center of all @xmath3  groups as spectroscopic targets .",
    "we include all of these galaxies in our spectroscopic survey . occasionally , we do not reobserve galaxies with a known redshift @xmath56 such that @xmath57 km s@xmath6 , where @xmath58 is the redshift of the group as listed in @xcite . in other words ,",
    "we sometimes ignore spectroscopically confirmed foreground and background galaxies .",
    "the total area of the sky covered by our spectroscopic survey is @xmath59 square degrees .",
    "thus the photometric calibration of plate - derived magnitudes is difficult , and the magnitude limit is only an estimate from the palomar observatory sky survey ( poss ) photographic plates , with a typical scatter of @xmath60 mag from system to system . because we view the galaxies as test particles embedded in a gravitational potential , completeness is not as important as it would be if we wanted to measure the group luminosity function",
    "nevertheless , our sampling uses a strict magnitude cutoff in the field of each group , with no biases against galaxies close together on the sky .",
    "we obtained spectra of the 2419 target galaxies with the fast single object spectrograph @xcite on the 1.5 m tillinghast reflector at whipple observatory on mount hopkins , az . using a 300 line mm@xmath6  grating , a 3@xmath61 slit , and a spectral coverage of 3940  centered at 5500",
    ", we had a typical resolution of 4 .",
    "a data reduction pipeline incorporating the cross - correlation of the spectra with rest - frame galaxy templates @xcite gave redshifts with an average uncertainty of @xmath62 km s@xmath6 .",
    "roughly 20% of these data were reported in @xcite ; for completeness , we list all 2419 redshifts in table [ tbl : gals ] .      to compare the mass distribution of poor systems of galaxies and nearby rich clusters , we assemble a catalog of clusters close to dynamical equilibrium .",
    "this requirement is important , because the techniques we use below ( and in fact all other methods relying on equilibrium dynamics ) assume that the phase space distribution of the member galaxies is constant with time .",
    "of course , at some level all clusters have residual substructure ; our best hope is to examine those systems with the smallest departures from equilibrium .",
    "it is surprising just how rare equilibrium systems are .",
    "for example , of the 10 brightest objects in the rosat bright cluster sample ( * ? ? ?",
    "* bcs ) , only two clusters , abell 1795 and abell 2029 , make it to our list in table [ tbl : clusterstwo ] .",
    "our criteria are not stringent : we require that published studies of the x - ray emitting gas and the cluster galaxy population lack clear evidence of ongoing mergers . for example a strong bimodality in the x - ray or optical light distribution is a signal that the system is not close to dynamical equilibrium",
    ". we also require a large number ( @xmath63 ) of measured velocities in the field of each cluster ; we search the nasa extragalactic database ( ned ) for published redshifts within 1.5 mpc of the cluster center .",
    "the dynamical state of some of the clusters in our list is ambiguous .",
    "for example , the central dominant galaxy in abell 2029 has a large peculiar velocity @xmath64 km s@xmath6  in the center of mass frame @xcite , but the cluster has a regular x - ray and optical morphology and shows no statistically significant substructure @xcite .",
    "many of the clusters we select contain cooling flows , which should arise only under equilibrium conditions @xcite . however , not all cooling flow clusters have equilibrium galaxy populations ; the most obvious example is abell 85 , which exhibits quite an irregular galaxy velocity structure @xcite .",
    "abell 2199 , another cooling flow cluster , is regular in both the x - ray and optical data within 1.5 mpc .",
    "however , it is on course to collide with abell 2197 and several other small galaxy groups located beyond 2 mpc @xcite .",
    "the clusters in our catalog have a mean redshift @xmath65 , and therefore complement the clusters of the canadian network for observational cosmology ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* cnoc ) , which are at @xmath66 on the average .",
    "the two samples differ in character , however : at least six of the cnoc clusters exhibit obvious substructure or asymmetry in x - ray images @xcite , and possibly also in weak lensing maps @xcite .",
    "the cnoc mass determinations rely on the assumption that equilibrium techniques average over the substructure without biasing the final result . to a lesser extent",
    ", this assumption underlies our study as well ; the absence of substructure still does not guarantee that the galaxy phase space distribution has arrived at a steady state .",
    "in this section we isolate the group and cluster members from foreground and background galaxies . to conduct the dynamical modeling ,",
    "we combine the systems into two ensembles .      a redshift survey in the field of a particular cluster is always contaminated by foreground and background galaxies .",
    "some outliers in velocity space are easily identifiable .",
    "unrelated galaxies with velocities close to the cluster mean , however , are not as cleanly separated . nor",
    "is it possible to identify a redshift range @xmath67 which contains only the cluster members , because interlopers  unrelated galaxies with large peculiar motions  could well be projected into this redshift range .",
    "we adopt a twofold approach to the membership problem . here",
    "we exclude the most probable foreground and background galaxies by the method of @xcite .",
    "then in  [ sec : interlopers ] we follow @xcite in folding the existence of the remaining interlopers directly into our dynamical model .",
    "the @xcite method consists entirely in making sure that in a sorted list of member velocities @xmath68 , no two neighbors have @xmath69 , where @xmath42 is the line - of - sight velocity dispersion of the cluster .",
    "this approach is not the most sophisticated method available .",
    "there is an extensive literature on the use of nonparametric adaptive kernels to reconstruct the cluster velocity distribution @xcite .",
    "however , the interpretation of the smooth probability distributions produced by the adaptive kernels is not straightforward . in particular",
    ", the frequent occurrence of slightly double - peaked probability distributions makes it difficult to tell exactly which galaxies should be considered cluster members .",
    "the @xcite method is also nonparametric given a redshift range , and it reports the cluster membership unambiguously .    to implement this method , we begin with the known mean system velocity @xmath70 , from @xcite for groups , and from ned for the clusters .",
    "we remove all galaxies in our survey with @xmath71 km s@xmath6  for each cluster .",
    "we then calculate @xmath58 and @xmath42 , given by @xmath72 where @xmath68 , the center - of - mass velocity of each galaxy , is shown in equation ( [ eq : vzi ] ) .",
    "we sort the @xmath68 , and remove all velocity - space neighbors with a velocity difference @xmath73 .",
    "we repeat the procedure until no galaxy is rejected .",
    "tables [ tbl : groups ] and [ tbl : clusterstwo ] list the final membership counts .",
    "this list almost certainly contains additional interlopers , which we treat probabilistically in ",
    "[ sec : dynamics ] .",
    "a total of 1428 of the 2419 surveyed galaxies ( 60% ) are group members . of the 979 additional redshift taken from the literature , 851 ( 86% ) are cluster members .",
    "the data for any given system are scarce ; there are on the average @xmath74 members per system in the group database .",
    "it is therefore not possible to measure the shape of the matter density for individual systems .",
    "our approach is to combine the groups and clusters into two ensembles . if the groups and clusters are self - similar  i.e . , they are differently scaled versions of the same archetypal system  the aggregate yields the maximum information about the shape of the matter distribution .",
    "if on the other hand the systems in each ensemble are not self - similar , the ensemble itself represents an average over the various matter distributions , and the derived results ought to reflect the range of shapes present in each ensemble",
    ".    how are the systems to be combined ? ideally ,",
    "both the velocity and the position of galaxies in each system ought to be scaled to a common value .",
    "we could choose a scaling such that the total virial mass of each system as given by equation ( [ eq : virial ] ) is the same : @xmath75 , and @xmath76 .",
    "however , interlopers make the radial scaling problematic . in practice , scaling by @xmath77 introduces noise in the data because of its sensitivity to interlopers and substructure @xcite .",
    "a more suitable scaling radius is @xmath78 , the radius at which the cluster density is 200 times the critical density of the universe .",
    "a common method for calculating @xmath78 , due to @xcite , is to assume that the mass profile @xmath79 in the vicinity of @xmath78 .",
    "although observed x - ray and lensing cluster mass profiles are not proportional to @xmath33 everywhere @xcite , the linear relation does appear to be reasonable near @xmath78 .",
    "this assumption , together with the virial theorem ( with @xmath77 replaced by @xmath78 ) , yields the following adopted scalings : @xmath80 where @xmath81 is the hubble constant at the redshift of the cluster .    using the velocity and radius scalings , we combine the groups and the clusters into two different ensembles  one `` high @xmath82 '' and one `` low @xmath82 '' ensemble .",
    "we do not combine all the data into one ensemble because lower mass systems of galaxies are thought to exhibit `` similarity breaking , '' or departures from the scaling laws that pertain to rich clusters of galaxies .",
    "for example @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite show that for low mass systems of galaxies , the relationships between the x - ray luminosity @xmath83 , x - ray temperature @xmath84 , and velocity dispersion @xmath82 differs from that of rich clusters .",
    "it would be interesting to see if corresponding differences in the matter distributions of these systems exist .",
    "some high resolution n - body simulation have reported differences in the shape of the matter distribution for low- and high - mass systems @xcite .",
    "another reason to break the data into two ensembles is completeness . in order for the analysis to be valid ,",
    "the systems assigned to an ensemble need to have redshift surveys complete to the same scaled radius . because of the fixed physical limits of our survey ( 1.5 mpc ) , low-@xmath82 ( less massive ) groups are complete to a much larger value of @xmath78 than are high-@xmath82 ( more massive ) systems . to make efficient use of the data , it is best to have two different ensembles with different completeness limits . for this purpose",
    "it is useful to define @xmath85 as the total number of galaxies within @xmath86 in all systems that are complete to @xmath86 . by maximizing @xmath85 as a function of @xmath86 for each of the two ensembles ,",
    "we ensure that we are making the best possible use of the data while adhering to the completeness requirement .",
    "our goal is to have an equal number of galaxies in the low- and high-@xmath82 ensembles .",
    "the closest we can come to this goal is to split the systems at @xmath87 km s@xmath6 . maximizing @xmath85 yields a low-@xmath82 ensemble with 893 members complete to @xmath88 , and a high-@xmath82 ensemble with 945 members complete to @xmath89 .",
    "we therefore utilize 1838 ( 80% ) of the 2279 available member galaxy velocities in our data sample .",
    "the two ensembles are shown in figure [ fig : rvz ] .",
    "table [ tbl : props ] shows the statistical properties of the final dynamical sample .",
    "we use the two sample ks test @xcite to evaluate the consistency of the high- and low-@xmath82 ensembles .",
    "the ks tests show that the distributions of scaled velocities @xmath90 in the two ensembles are consistent with each other .",
    "this is illustrated in the velocity histograms in figure [ fig : compare ] .",
    "on the other hand , the distribution of scaled distances @xmath91 differs in the two samples .",
    "according to the ks test , the probability that the distributions are the same is less than @xmath92 .",
    "note that for this comparison only , we truncated the low-@xmath82 sample at @xmath93 , because that is the limit to which the high-@xmath82 sample is complete .",
    "figure [ fig : compare ] also shows the @xmath94 histogram .",
    "the distribution of the distances of high-@xmath82 galaxies varies more rapidly with @xmath94 than that of the low-@xmath82 sample .",
    "thus , although the galaxies in the high- and low-@xmath82 ensembles appear to have similar velocity distributions , their spatial distributions differ slightly . in the next section we investigate whether whether this difference translates into a difference in the total matter distribution .",
    "here we discuss our technique for constraining the gravitational potential and orbital distribution of a system of galaxies .",
    "we use elements of @xcite , @xcite and @xcite in our analysis .",
    "we add our own procedures for the faster computation of the phase space integrals described below .",
    "our goal is to use measurements of galaxy positions and radial velocities ( @xmath95 ) to constrain the shape of the matter density .",
    "our approach is bayesian . for practical purposes , `` bayesian ''",
    "means that our final result is a probability density rather a set of numbers and associated errors .",
    "for example , in addition to saying `` the mass is @xmath96 and the slope is @xmath97 , '' we draw curves of equal probability in @xmath98 space .",
    "these `` confidence regions '' will not necessarily be elliptical , as would be the case for a straightforward linearized @xmath99 fit .",
    "bayes s theorem specifies the method of calculating these confidence regions . let the vector @xmath100 represent all the parameters we wish to derive from the data .",
    "we seek the probability of @xmath100 given the data , which , according to bayes s theorem , is and @xmath26 , rather than @xmath94 and @xmath90 . ] @xmath101 the function on the left is the joint probability distribution of the unknown parameters @xmath100 , such that @xmath102 . on the right hand side :    1 .",
    "@xmath103 is independent of @xmath100 .",
    "because the left hand side has to be normalized to unity , this probability is a precisely calculable number .",

    "s theorem the desired confidence regions can be derived by calculating the two - dimensional function @xmath108 for all @xmath100 of interest , multiplying the result by the prior , and normalizing the answer to unity .    to do this calculation we use the galaxy phase - space distribution function ( df hereafter ) .",
    "the df , a general way to describe the dynamical state of the galaxies in a cluster , is sometimes written @xmath109 , where @xmath110 and @xmath111 are the position and velocity vectors , such that @xmath112 is the number of galaxies within a small phase space volume element @xmath113 at @xmath114 . if we knew the df as a function of our parameter set @xmath100 , it would be simple to write down the probability of observing a galaxy with line - of - sight velocity @xmath26 at a projected distance @xmath115 from the cluster center .",
    "we begin by referring to this probability as @xmath116 .",
    "suppose we conduct a complete redshift survey of an isolated spherical cluster complete to a limiting projected distance @xmath117 from the center .",

    "such an equation would connect the observations to the matter distribution .",
    "the jeans theorem @xcite provides this crucial link .",
    "the theorem guarantees that in a steady - state spherical system the df is a function of only two integrals of motion : the negative energy @xmath130 , where @xmath131 , and the square of the angular momentum @xmath132 . thus we can write @xmath133 \\label{eq : df}\\ ] ] newton s law and the jeans theorem provide all the information we need to calculate the probability of observing a data point @xmath134 given a df and potential ( @xmath135,@xmath129 ) through equations ( [ eq : probdef])-([eq : df ] ) .",
    "the appendix contains the full expression for @xmath116 in spherical coordinates .",
    "once we calculate the probability of the data given a specific model , we can use bayes s theorem to calculate constraints on the set of model parameters .",
    "to begin we consider the parameters of the mass profile .",
    "many forms exist in the literature , but the ideal profile for our purposes should fulfill the following criteria , in decreasing order of importance : ( 1 ) it should be general enough to have the inner matter density slope as a free parameter ; ( 2 ) it should include well - studied profiles as special cases ; and ( 3 ) it should generate a density and gravitational potential in terms of elementary functions .",
    "this last property would make phase space distribution analysis faster and more straightforward .",

    "is evident that @xmath154 .",
    "if that were not the case , ( 1 ) the galaxy mass @xmath155 would diverge at @xmath156 , and ( 2 ) one of the velocity dispersions @xmath157 and @xmath158 would have to be imaginary .",
    "the @xmath159 and @xmath1 parameters also describe the slope of the galaxy density at infinity . for example , if @xmath160 at large radii , then @xmath161 , with @xmath162 henceforth , without loss of generality , we will discuss the energy slope of the df solely in terms of @xmath138 . as @xmath138 increases , the cluster contains fewer galaxies with large kinetic energies .",
    "this behavior occurs because galaxies with energy @xmath163 begin to outnumber galaxies with @xmath164 ( see equation [ eq : df ] ) . as a result",
    "the galaxy distribution is less extended than it would be with small @xmath138 .",
    "the minimum acceptable value is @xmath165 , because the mass models we consider ( equation [ eq : mainpot ] ) decline asymptotically as @xmath166 .",
    "the inner slope of the galaxy density @xmath167 can be different from the slope of the matter density @xmath0 : @xmath168 the reason for the split at @xmath141 is that the potential @xmath37 becomes singular for @xmath169 , and through equation ( [ eq : nu ] ) , gives a contribution to the inner slope of the galaxy density . for @xmath170 ,",
    "the potential is constant at @xmath171 , and there is no such contribution .",
    "a corollary of this property is the requirement @xmath172 this statement specifies that the galaxy density may never exceed the total matter density .",
    "it implies , importantly , that for constant density cores @xmath13 , no radially anisotropic models ( @xmath173 ) are viable .",
    "this requirement is not unique to our model ; a large number of other radially anisotropic models , with substantially different dfs and anisotropy profiles @xmath174 , are also incompatible with constant - density cores @xcite .    up to this point",
    "we have a five - dimensional parameter space @xmath175 .",
    "one final dimension is necessary , the interloper fraction .",
    "so far we have assumed that the clusters and groups we observe exist in isolation , free from any contamination from background and foreground galaxies . in reality , however , even after velocity clipping ( see  [ sec : membership ] ) , a small percentage of the galaxies are unrelated objects projected into the phase space volume of interest .",
    "we wish to estimate this percentage  the interloper fraction @xmath146from the data .",
    "we follow the elegant method of @xcite in treating the interlopers statistically .",
    "this method assumes that interlopers land randomly in the group or cluster phase space volume .",
    "thus every galaxy we observe has a finite probability @xmath146 of being an unrelated interloper .",
    "the probability that a galaxy with velocity @xmath26 and projected distance @xmath115 is included in our survey is then @xmath176 where @xmath177 is the maximum observed line of sight velocity .",
    "it is easy to verify that the above expression meets a normalization criterion similar to equation ( [ eq : pnorm ] ) as long @xmath178 as @xmath179    we can now write down the final expression for the six - dimensional function @xmath180 .",
    "the full expression is too long to be listed here and is derived in detail within the appendix .",
    "the derivation consists of a straightforward if laborious combination of equations ( [ eq : probdef ] )  -  ( [ eq : pfinal ] ) .",
    "the main complications occur because we observe a spherical object in cylindrical coordinates .",
    "we henceforth refer to the joint probability distribution of observables for a given measurement simply as @xmath181 , where without loss of generality we have made the substitution @xmath182 and @xmath183 .",
    "the six parameters of our model are ( @xmath0,@xmath137,@xmath138,@xmath2,@xmath1,@xmath146 ) .",
    "some of these parameters can be redefined without loss of generality to yield more compact joint confidence regions .",
    "for example , we find that jointly constraining @xmath0 , @xmath137 and @xmath2 as defined in equation ( [ eq : massmodel ] ) yields a high degree of correlation among all three parameters .",
    "however , by switching to the system @xmath184 we significantly reduce the overall extent of the confidence regions . the new radius scaling @xmath185 is defined such that @xmath186 in other words , @xmath185 is the location at which the slope of the matter density is 5/2 .",
    "similarly , @xmath187 is the total mass contained within @xmath188 .",
    "the fact that we analyze ensembles of clusters has implications for the measurement of @xmath185 and @xmath187 . to create the ensembles",

    "similarly , the quantity @xmath190 rather than @xmath185 alone , is constrained by our method .",

    "we describe the numerical procedure used to calculate our probabilities . even though @xmath181 has six dimensions , we limit ourselves to constraining five at any given time . as we explain in  [ sec : freen ] , for free @xmath0 our data can place only a lower , and not an upper limit on the energy slope @xmath138 , and therefore @xmath181 can not be normalized properly as a function of @xmath138 . on the other hand ,",

    "this step requires @xmath206 interpolations , and takes up roughly 70% of the total computation time . because of the linearity of the interloper parameter in equation ( [ eq : pfinal ] ) , calculating the probability density as a function of @xmath146 takes up a trivial amount of time in comparison to the @xmath206 interpolations .",
    "projection_. to display the 5-dimensional probability density , we produce two - dimensional realizations of it .",

    ".      the ideal procedure to test the validity of our technique would be to create thousands of monte carlo realizations of various clusters with different values of @xmath1 , @xmath138 , @xmath2 , @xmath187 , and @xmath146 , and to conduct our analysis separately for each realization .",
    "then we could compute the fraction of simulations in which the most likely parameters closely match the input parameters .",

    "another feature of the simulations is that they are more powerful when @xmath0 is steep  that is , the slope of the matter density is large . in this case",
    "our method yields a fairly accurate measurement of @xmath0 .",

    "we have set @xmath234 , i.e. , we have fixed it at the value used to generate the data .",

    "the 95% confidence contours derived using our method should include the correct value of each parameter if the general model is admissible ( i.e. , @xmath247 ) , with the caveat that the smallest value of @xmath138 that yields a good fit should be used .",
    "these confidence regions ought to be compact for large values of the density slope @xmath0 , and broad - valued for flat halos with small @xmath0 .",
    "here we describe our constraints on the inner matter density slope @xmath0 , the mass normalization @xmath194 , the transition radius @xmath195 , the velocity anisotropy @xmath196 , and the interloper fraction @xmath146 .",

    "the binned profiles we show are for illustrative purposes and do not indicate ordinary @xmath99 fitting .",
    "first we investigate the possibility that the ensembles have constant - density cores ( @xmath13 ) . in ",
    "[ sec : df ] we showed that such cores do not support radially anisotropic models ; we are limited to @xmath248 .",

    "the dotted line in figure [ fig : results ] shows the results of the minimization .",
    "we show the most likely grand total velocity histogram and galaxy surface density as given by equations ( [ eq : nvz])-([eq : sigma ] ) .",

    "this discrepancy is not easily visualized through the plots of @xmath237 or @xmath238 .    just to be sure that the @xmath252 models are a poor fit , we also try relaxing the requirement that the orbits not be radially anisotropic .",
    "we fit the full range of negative to positive @xmath1 , and find that @xmath253 maximize the likelihood for both ensembles .",
    "these values are formally unphysical , yielding a galaxy density that is steeper than the @xmath252 total matter density near the central regions .",

    "it is interesting to note ( figure [ fig : results ] ) that the inconsistency occurs near @xmath171 , and not at larger radii .",
    "if our choice of mass model ( equation [ eq : mainpot ] ) were the cause for the poor fit , we would expect the inconsistency to occur at the larger radii , because that is where we impose a @xmath255 behavior .",
    "we conclude that models with a constant density core ( @xmath256 ) are at best barely consistent with the data .",
    "now we allow the inner slope of the mass density @xmath0 to vary , maximizing @xmath257 for several different values of @xmath138 , the slope of the galaxy density at large radii .",
    "the jointly constrained parameter set is therefore ( @xmath0,@xmath196,@xmath195 , @xmath194,@xmath146 ) . as described in ",
    "[ sec : df ] , @xmath138 is also related to the slope of the energy term in the distribution function ( equation [ eq : df ] ) .",

    "this constraint corresponds to @xmath234 for the low-@xmath82 and @xmath259 for the high-@xmath82 ensemble .",
    "figures [ fig : results ] and [ fig : conf ] show the results . aside from difference in the value of @xmath138 ,",
    "the high- and low- velocity dispersion systems provide very similar fits : the galaxy orbits are consistent with isotropic ( @xmath260 ) , and both ensembles have @xmath261 and transition radius @xmath185 much greater than @xmath78 .",
    "in other words , the matter distributions for both samples are consistent with a singular isothermal sphere within the limits of the survey .",
    "neither the cluster nor the group data supports a total matter distribution with a constant - density core ( @xmath13 ) .",
    "this result is in keeping with recent studies of more distant clusters in the x - ray @xcite as well as weak lensing maps @xcite .",
    "optical observations of cluster velocity data have also yielded similar results .",
    "for example , @xcite uses the jeans equation and isotropic velocity dispersion profiles to rule out constant - density cores in the two degree field galaxy redshift survey @xcite .",
    "our results suggest that within a projected region @xmath262 , the matter distribution in both low- and high-@xmath82 systems of galaxies is close to a single power law with @xmath141 .",
    "the density declines rapidly only outside @xmath263 .",
    "this result is consistent with n - body simulations .",
    "for example , in the original paper describing the simulations of nfw , the density profiles of dark matter halos are consistent with a single power law of slope 2 between @xmath264 and @xmath265 ( see their figure 3 ) . the only discrepancy , or flattening , occurs at radii smaller than @xmath266 , where our datasets have 56 ( low-@xmath82 ) and 131 ( high-@xmath82 ) members , perhaps insufficient to provide a robust constraint .",
    "a major limitation of our method is the fixed form of the galaxy distribution function @xmath147 . by modeling the df as a power law in energy and angular momentum",
    ", we neglect all other possible forms for the df , some of which may indeed be consistent with an @xmath13 model .",
    "on the other hand , the @xmath99 tests we perform reassure us that the data are at least statistically consistent with cuspy matter distributions .",
    "the work of @xcite , whose methods we adapt and extend , involves a similar analysis , and it is instructive to compare the two different approaches . instead of fixing the form of the df , they fix the form of the surface number density @xmath267 , and calculate the df using an inversion of the integral in equation ( [ eq : dfint ] ) . as a result ,",
    "their df is more general than ours , @xmath268 , with @xmath269 being the result of the inversion .",
    "their method has the advantage of generality , but the disadvantage that it requires a two - stage fit : first @xmath267 must be fit and fixed , and then @xmath1 and @xmath0 measured separately , without an indication of how changes in the @xmath267 fit would affect the resulting constraints .",
    "our method sacrifices generality by setting @xmath270 , but gains the advantage that all but one of the parameters are fit simultaneously ( @xmath138 is varied discretely ) . as a result , the correlation among the parameters is easy to understand via marginalized confidence contours ( figure [ fig : conf ] ) .",
    "another difference between our work and @xcite is the sampling of the parameter space .",
    "we constrain the continuous five - dimensional region @xmath271 , whereas @xcite sample discrete points within that space .",
    "they find that an nfw profile with @xmath140 matches the cnoc data , but they do not consider @xmath141 models ; we find that our clusters and groups have steeper matter distributions , with the best fit model closer to @xmath141 .",
    "the fixed functional form of our df can also explain the large transition radii .",
    "careful examination of equation ( [ eq : nu ] ) shows that increasing @xmath138 , the slope of the galaxy density as @xmath272 , also steepens the slope of the galaxy density @xmath167 near @xmath171 .",
    "it is still the case that @xmath273 at @xmath274 , but the derivative of the slope @xmath275 becomes larger and larger as @xmath138 is increased .",
    "our data have a steep galaxy density slope near @xmath171 , and there are only two ways to fit this : increasing @xmath1 ( and thus generating more radially anisotropic orbits ) or increasing @xmath138 ( and thus steepening the overall galaxy energy distribution and hence the galaxy density ) .",
    "this is where the velocity distribution enters . as figure",
    "[ fig : results ] shows , the grand total velocity histogram is not strongly peaked at @xmath276 ( in fact , it is consistent with a gaussian distribution ) .",
    "dramatically increasing @xmath1 would yield a velocity distribution that is much more sharply peaked than the data .",
    "thus the only choice left the model is to increase @xmath138 to larger values , @xmath277 .",
    "however , the slope of the galaxy density is not as steep as 8 at the limits of the survey .",
    "hence , a large transition radius @xmath2 is required to fit the outer regions of the galaxy number density profile . at the same time",
    ", the velocity data allow the matter profile to be nearly a power law within the region constrained by the data .",
    "note that the upper limits on @xmath195 are possible because if @xmath195 becomes too large , then the galaxy density profile begins to resemble a single power law as well , and the position data do not favor this limit ( figure [ fig : results ] ) .",
    "another shortcoming is that our method constrains the total matter density , rather than the dark matter density alone .",
    "while the dark component is thought to dominate the mass , it does not do so overwhelmingly  in typical clusters , @xmath278 of the mass is in baryons , chiefly in the form of the x - ray emitting medium . in the innermost regions of clusters with a dominant central galaxy , it is actually the stellar mass density and not the dark matter density that dominates the total distribution @xcite .",
    "lensing and stellar dynamical models which take into account the starlight separately from the dark component show conflicting results  while the central regions of some clusters exhibit flat @xmath13 @xcite dark matter densities , others show evidence for steep @xmath279 dark matter profiles @xcite .",
    "it would be of great value to constrain the inner density slope @xmath0 independently of the slope at infinity .",
    "unfortunately , because the data are sparse , we can not derive true constraints on the outer galaxy density slope @xmath138 , and measuring the outer total matter density would be even more difficult . with @xmath280",
    "redshifts a true , simultaneous constraint on the outer and inner slopes would be possible ; such large data sets could allow a direct measurement of the phase space distribution function @xcite , without requiring us to parameterize the shape of the distribution function , as in equation ( [ eq : df ] ) .",
    "data sets that are only factors of two larger are unlikely to make that difference .",
    "also , leveraging independent constraints on the inner and outer slopes by extending the survey beyond @xmath78 is unlikely to provide better constraints .",
    "in these outer regions , most of the galaxies are experiencing spherical infall , which makes equilibrium models clearly unapplicable , and caustic modeling techniques preferable @xcite .",
    "however , one can envision a technique that combines equilibrium dynamics at small scales with the study of the infall caustics outside the virialized regions of the cluster . in this way",
    "one could obtain a total mass profile over several decades in @xmath33 .",
    "the most promising method of increasing the accuracy of this analysis is to extend the known membership of groups and clusters to dwarf galaxies with absolute magnitudes as faint as @xmath281 .",
    "a typical group with velocity dispersion @xmath282 km s@xmath6  is likely to have @xmath283 faint dwarf members within 1 mpc @xcite .",

    "we compare the distribution of matter in rich and poor systems of galaxies , basing our analysis on a deep catalog of galaxies in groups .",
    "the catalog consists of a statistically complete sample of 2419 newly measured redshifts in the fields of @xmath3  systems , as well as 979 redshifts from the literature for 8 nearby rich clusters of galaxies .",
    "most of the groups have x - ray emission detected in the rasscals survey @xcite .",
    "we construct a low-@xmath82 ensemble group and a high-@xmath82 ensemble cluster from these data .",
    "the final dynamical samples have 893 members in 33 groups , and 945 members in 15 clusters , with an average velocity dispersion of 330 km s@xmath6  and 800 km s@xmath6 respectively .",
    "our study is the first to derive confidence volumes in the parameter space defined by the matter density slope @xmath0 , the interloper fraction @xmath146 , the mass normalization @xmath187 , the velocity anisotropy @xmath1 , and the characteristic radius @xmath2 for clusters and groups of galaxies . by modeling the phase space density of the galaxies directly ,",
