    "cosmic shear , coherent distortions in galaxy images caused by the gravitational field of the intervening large - scale structure , has now been recognized as a powerful cosmological tool ( see mellier 1999 and bartelmann & schneider 2001 for reviews ) .",
    "since the signal of cosmic shear reflects the gravitational potential of the total mass distribution , the cosmic shear can be a direct probe of the dark matter distribution as well as a way to measure the cosmological parameters .",
    "recently , measurements of the cosmic shear have been independently performed by several groups ( van waerbeke et al .",
    "2000a ; wittman et al .",
    "2000 ; bacon , refregier & ellis 2000 ; kaiser , wilson & luppino 2000 ; maoli et al .",
    "2001 ; rhodes et al . 2001 ; van waerbeke et al .",
    "the estimated shear variance from the different observational data set quantitatively reconciles with each other , which is in good agreement with theoretical predictions based on the cluster normalized cold dark matter ( cdm ) model of structure formation .",
    "ongoing and future wide - field surveys using high - resolution ccd camera will promise to dramatically improve the signal - to - noise ratio of the weak lensing signals .",
    "hence , a detail understanding of the weak lensing statistics will be necessary to extract all the cosmological information present in the data .    of course , simplest but useful statistical measure of the weak lensing field is popular two - point statistics ( blandford et al .",
    "1991 ; miralda - escude 1991 ; kaiser 1992 ) , however , a more clear discriminator is needed to break the degeneracy in constraining the cosmological parameters . in this respect",
    ", the non - gaussian features of weak lensing field can be very sensitive to the density of universe and the higher - order statistics such as the skewness of local convergence field are expected to constrain the density parameter @xmath11 and even to the cosmological constant @xmath12 ( bernardeau , van waerbeke & mellier 1997 ; jain & seljak 1997 ; van waerbeke et al .",
    "on the other hand , topological analysis using the minkowski functionals of the convergence field has been proposed by sato , takada , jing & futamase ( 2001 ) in order to extract the non - gaussian features ( see also matsubara & jain 2001 ) .",
    "unfortunately , their methodology heavily relies on the validity of the perturbation theory of structure formation and can not be applied to the weak lensing field at small angular scales @xmath13 , where the underlying three - dimensional mass distribution is in the highly nonlinear regime .",
    "while the non - gaussian signature of weak lensing fields becomes easily measurable on small scales , the non - gaussian signal primarily reflects the nonlinear growth of the density fields , which strongly depends on the dark matter clustering properties .",
    "it is therefore desirable to investigate the statistical properties of three - dimensional mass density and explore the relation between mass distribution and weak lensing field .",
    "very recently , kayo , taruya & suto ( 2001 ) performed a detailed analysis of the one- and two - point statistics of the three - dimensional mass distribution using the high - resolution n - body simulations .",
    "they found that the lognormal models of one- and two - point probability distribution functions ( pdf ) can provide an excellent approximation to the nonlinear mass distribution with gaussian initial condition , irrespective of the shape of the initial power spectrum .",
    "the lognormal distribution has been long known as an empirical prescription characterizing the dark matter distribution and/or the observed galaxies ( e.g. , hamilton 1985 ; bouchet et al .",
    "1993 ; coles & jones 1991 ; kofman et al .",
    "1994 ) , however , there exists no rigorous explanation for its physical origin .",
    "nevertheless , the lognormal model is now widely utilized in the astrophysical context such as analytical modeling of dark halo biasing and ly-@xmath14 forest ( e.g. , mo & white 1996 ; taruya & suto 2000 ; bi & davidsen 1997 ) . in this regard , the result of kayo et al .",
    "( 2001 ) is interesting and can be useful in quantifying the dark matter distribution .",
    "furthermore , their results indicate that the lognormal distribution can also describe the weak lensing field , since the weak lensing effect primarily reflects the clustering property of dark matter distributions .",
    "then , crucial but fundamental questions arise as follows .",
    "how does the lognormal property emerge in the weak lensing field ?",
    "can the lognormal model provide an approximate and reliable prescription for the weak lensing statistics ?    in this paper , we quantitatively investigate those issues using the ray - tracing simulations .",
    "we first consider how the statistical feature of three - dimensional mass distribution is related to that of the local convergence , i.e , the two - dimensional projected density field . assuming that the convergence field is well - approximated by the lognormal distribution , we derive analytic formulae for the one - point pdf and the minkowski functionals .",
    "we then perform quantitative comparisons between the lognormal models and the results of ray - tracing simulations .",
    "furthermore , we discuss the consistency of the lognormal model with the higher - order statistics on which the previous works have mainly focused .    the plan of paper is as follows . in section [ sec : preliminaries ] , we briefly describe the basic definitions of weak lenses .",
    "then , we discuss the statistical relations between mass density field and convergence field in section [ sec : lognormal ] .",
    "the analytic expressions for the one - point pdf and the minkowski functionals are presented . in section [ sec : comparison ] , the detailed comparison between the lognormal predictions and the ray - tracing simulations is described .",
    "the consistency between lognormal model and previous study is discussed in section [ sec : moments ] .",
    "finally , section [ sec : summary ] is devoted to conclusions and discussion .",
    "inhomogeneous mass distribution of the large - scale structure deflects the light ray trajectory emitted from an angular direction @xmath15 in the source plane by a small angle @xmath16 in the image plane .",
    "the differences between the deflection angles of light rays emitted from a galaxy thus induce a distortion of the galaxy image characterized by the following symmetric matrix : @xmath17 where @xmath18 represents a derivative with respect to @xmath19 , and @xmath20 is the gravitational potential of the three - dimensional mass density field .",
    "the variable @xmath21 means the quantity @xmath22 at the source redshift , and the quantities @xmath22 and @xmath23 respectively denote the comoving parts of the radial and the angular - diameter distance : @xmath24 and @xmath25 with the quantity @xmath26 being the spatial curvature of the universe , @xmath27 .",
    "the matrix @xmath28 is usually decomposed into the trace part , i.e , the convergence field @xmath29 and the tidal shear components @xmath30 defined by @xmath31 the shear field @xmath30 can be directly estimated from the observed ellipticity of the galaxy images .",
    "the convergence field @xmath29 can be then reconstructed from the shear map from the relations ( [ eq : kappa ] ) and ( [ eq : shear ] ) ( e.g. , kaiser & squires 1993 ) .",
    "since we are interested in the _ statistical _ properties of the weak lensing fields , one can safely employ the born approximation , where the quantity @xmath32 are computed along the unperturbed photon trajectory ( blandford et al . 1991 ; miralda - escude 1991 ; kaiser 1992 ) . from equations ( [ eq : matrix ] ) and ( [ eq : kappa ] ) , the convergence field along a line - of - sight is simply expressed as a weighted projection of the mass density fluctuation field @xmath33 ( e.g , mellier 1999 ; bartelmann & schneider 2001 for reviews ) : @xmath34 ,    \\label{eq : def_kappa}\\ ] ] where the weight function @xmath35 is @xmath36 note that , even in the weak lensing limit , the density fluctuation @xmath33 is not small but can become much larger than unity .    in statistical analysis of weak lensing fields ,",
    "the smoothing filter is practically used in order to reduce the noise due to the intrinsic ellipticity of galaxies . throughout this paper ,",
    "we adopt the top - hat smoothing function .",
    "the variance of the local convergence can then be expressed as @xmath37 ^ 2\\ , \\int\\frac{d^2{\\mathbf{k}_{\\perp}}}{(2\\pi)^2}\\,p_{\\rm\\scriptscriptstyle mass}({k_{\\perp}})\\,\\ ,",

    "similarly , variance of the gradient field , @xmath41 , can be expressed as @xmath42 ^ 2\\,r^2(\\chi)\\,\\ , \\int\\frac{d^2{\\mathbf{k}_{\\perp}}}{(2\\pi)^2}\\,{k_{\\perp}}^2 \\,\\",

    "\\label{eq : var_nablakappa}\\ ] ] equations ( [ eq : var_kappa ] ) and ( [ eq : var_nablakappa ] ) are valid on relevant angular scales we are interested in , where the small - angle approximation holds with good accuracy ( hu 2001 ) .",
    "the expression ( [ eq : def_kappa ] ) gives a simple interpretation that the statistical feature of @xmath0 is closely related to that of the underlying density field @xmath33 . to show this more explicitly , we consider the one - point pdf , which can be constructed from a full set of the moments .",
    "let us write down the pdf of the mass density field @xmath33 : @xmath43 where @xmath44 denotes the root - mean - square ( rms ) of @xmath33 , @xmath45 and @xmath46 means cumulant generating function : @xmath47 similarly , the one - point pdf of the local convergence is written as @xmath48 with the cumulant generating function for @xmath49 , @xmath50 . here",
    "we have introduced the normalized convergence field , @xmath51 so as to satisfy the range of the definition being @xmath52 .",
    "the quantity @xmath53 denotes the minimum value of the convergence field .",
    "note that the actual value of @xmath53 in the universe should , in principle , depend on the nature of dark matter between the source galaxies and observer ( metcalf & silk 1999 ; seljak & holtz 1999 ) .",
    "if the dark matter is composed of a compact object such as the primordial black holes , @xmath53 might correspond to the convergence evaluated along an empty beam ( see eq.[[eq : empty ] ] ) . on the other hand , when the dark matter is composed of a smooth microscopic component as is suggested by the standard cdm scenarios , @xmath53 becomes larger than the empty - beam value for relevant smoothing scales ( see also jain , seljak & white 1999 ) . as will be discussed later in section [ subsec : model_param ]",
    ", @xmath53 is an important quantity in controlling the lognormal model and is sensitive to the cosmological model .",
    "even though we have the simple relation ( [ eq : def_kappa ] ) between @xmath33 and @xmath0 , the relation between the cumulant generating functions of @xmath54 and @xmath55 is practically intractable without recourse to some assumptions or approximations . under the hierarchical ansatz for the higher order moments of @xmath33 ,",
    "i.e. , @xmath56 , munshi & jain ( 2000 ) and valageas ( 2000 ) showed that the relation between @xmath54 and @xmath55 is greatly reduced and is expressed in a compact form : @xmath57 where the quantity @xmath58 is defined by @xmath59 this is valid as long as the small - angle approximation holds .",
    "as also proposed by those authors , since the factor @xmath60 in equation ( [ eq : cumulant ] ) has typical values of order unity , one might use a simple approximation @xmath61 it is easy to check that this approximation holds for the limit of @xmath62 , where the both quantities @xmath63 and @xmath64 approach unity .",
    "once equation ( [ eq : cumulant_approx ] ) is given , pdf of the convergence field , @xmath65 , can be _ directly _ calculated from the one - point pdf of the three - dimensional mass density field @xmath66 , irrespective of the projection effect ( see eq.[[eq : def_kappa ] ] ) : @xmath67 now , let us recall the empirical fact that the pdf of local density @xmath66 is approximately described by the lognormal distribution : @xmath68 ^ 2}{2\\ln(1+\\sigma^{2 } ) } \\right\\}\\,\\,\\frac{d\\delta}{1+\\delta}.\\ ] ] substituting ( [ eq : log_delta ] ) into ( [ eq : pdf_kappa_del ] ) , one finally obtains @xmath69 ^ 2}{2{\\sigma_{\\rm ln}}^2 } \\right\\}\\,\\frac{d\\kappa}{\\kappa+|{\\kappa_{\\rm min}}|},\\ ] ] where the quantity @xmath70 is defined by @xmath71    before discussing the application and validity of equation ( [ eq : logpdf ] ) , two important remarks should be mentioned .",
    "first , recall that the lognormal distribution violates the assumption of hierarchical ansatz used in the derivation of equation ( [ eq : cumulant ] ) . the resultant expression ( [ eq : logpdf ] ) is thus inconsistent , however , the violation of the hierarchical assumption is fortunately weak on nonlinear scales of interest here ( e.g. , kayo et al .",
    "we therefore expect that , as long as we restrict ourselves to the range of applicability , the expression ( [ eq : logpdf ] ) can provide a reasonable approximation and capture an important aspect of the non - gaussianity in the weak lensing field .",
    "secondly , notice that the result ( [ eq : logpdf ] ) heavily relies on the validity of the approximation ( [ eq : cumulant_approx ] ) .",
    "one might suspect that the approximation breaks down for a case with the high source redshift such as @xmath72 , where the lensing projection becomes more important , and this will be discussed below .",
    "of course , one can directly evaluate the convergence pdf @xmath65 from equations ( [ eq : pdf_kappa ] ) and ( [ eq : cumulant ] ) assuming the lognormal pdf of @xmath33 , although this treatment is not useful in practice .",
    "instead , in this paper we _ a priori _ assumes the simple analytic prediction ( [ eq : logpdf ] ) , whereby we can further derive the useful analytic formulae for the minkowski functionals and obtain a more physical interpretation of the results .",
    "we will then carefully check our model by comparing the predictions with the numerical simulation results .",
    "expression ( [ eq : pdf_kappa_del ] ) implies that the projection effect is primarily unimportant and is eliminated by rescaling the quantities @xmath73 .",
    "that is , the statistical feature of @xmath0 directly reflects that of three - dimensional density @xmath33 .",
    "if this is the case , one can further develop a prediction of the weak lensing field based on the lognormal ansatz . to investigate this issue ,",
    "the other informative statistics such as the higher - order correlation and the isodensity statistics should be examined .    among these statistics",
    ", it is known that minkowski functionals can be useful and give a morphological description to the contour map of the weak lensing field ( e.g , schmalzing & buchert 1997 ) . in a two - dimensional case ,",
    "minkowski functionals are characterized by the three statistical quantities : the area fraction , @xmath74 , circumference per unit length , @xmath75 and euler characteristics per unit area , @xmath76 .",
    "the third functional is equivalent to the famous genus statistics often used in the cosmological context ( gott , melott & dickinson 1986 ) .",
    "these quantities are evaluated for each isocontour as a function of level threshold , @xmath77 .",
    "the explicit expression of minkowski functional @xmath78 is given by @xmath79 where @xmath80 denotes the heaviside step function .",
    "the minkowski functionals @xmath81 and @xmath82 provide an additional information on the convergence field , since the definitions include higher derivative terms such as @xmath83 and @xmath84 . according to matsubara ( 2000 ) , minkowski functionals",
    "@xmath75 and @xmath76 in the two - dimension map can be related to the level - crossing and the genus statistics defined in the two - dimensional surface , @xmath85 and @xmath86 ( see also schmalzing & buchert 1997 ) : @xmath87    assuming that the convergence field is approximately described by the lognormal distribution , the analytic expressions for minkowski functionals can be derived in a straightforward manner .",
    "since the area fraction represents the cumulative probability above the threshold @xmath2 , substituting ( [ eq : logpdf ] ) into the definition ( [ eq : def_v0 ] ) yields @xmath88 with the function @xmath89 given by @xmath90 as for the minkowski functionals @xmath75 and @xmath76 , the analytic expressions for the lognormal distribution can be obtained from the local transformation of gaussian formulae , @xmath91 and @xmath92 .",
    "the details of the derivation are described by taruya & yamamoto ( 2001 ) ( see also matsubara & yokoyama 1996 ) .",
    "the final results become @xmath93 note that in the limit @xmath94 , the above predictions recover the gaussian formulae : @xmath95 apart from the pdf @xmath65 and the area fraction @xmath74 , there exists no clear reason that the extension of lognormal model to the minkowski functionals @xmath75 and @xmath76 still provides a good approximation in the real universe . at present , the predictions ( [ eq : v1_log ] ) and ( [ eq : v2_log ] ) are just regarded as an _ extrapolation _ from the one - point pdf @xmath65 and should be checked by numerical simulations .",
    "in this section , we quantitatively examine the validity of lognormal model by comparing its predictions with the simulation results .",
    "a brief description of ray - tracing simulation is presented in section [ subsec : simulation ] . in section [ subsec :",
    "model_param ] , the model parameters in the lognormal formulae are checked in details using the simulation data . some important numerical effects are also discussed .",
    "then , section [ subsec : results ] describes our main results , i.e , the comparisons of one - point pdf and minkowski functionals between the lognormal predictions and the simulation data .      in order to investigate the lognormal property of convergence fields",
    ", we use a series of ray - tracing simulations in three cold dark matter models ( scdm , lcdm , ocdm for standard , lambda , open cdm models , respectively ) .",
    "the cosmological parameters used here are summarized in table [ tbl : parameter ] .    to perform a ray - tracing simulation , a light - cone data set is first generated by particle - mesh ( pm ) n - body code .",
    "the pm code uses @xmath96 particles and is performed in a periodic rectangular box of size @xmath97 with the force mesh @xmath96 .",
    "the initial conditions are generated according to the transfer functions of bond & efstathiou ( 1984 ) .",
    "then the light - cone of the particles is extracted from each simulation during the run ( hamana , colombi & suto 2001 ) .",
    "the final set of light - cone data are created so as to cover a field of view of @xmath98 square degrees and the box sizes of each output are chosen so as to match to the convergence of the light ray bundle . as a result ,",
    "the angular resolution of ray - tracing simulation , which is basically limited by the spatial resolution of pm n - body code , becomes almost constant , @xmath99 from the observer at @xmath100 ( hamana & mellier 2001 ) .",
    "once the light - cone data is obtained , ray - tracing simulations are next performed using the multiple lens - plane algorithm ( e.g. , schneider , ehlers & falco 1992 ; jain , seljak & white 2000 ; hamana , martel & futamase 2000 ) . in our calculation , the interval between lens planes are fixed to comoving length , @xmath101mpc .",
    "the @xmath102 light rays are then traced backward from the observer s point to the source plane .",
    "the initial ray directions are set on @xmath102 grids and the two - dimensional deflection potential are calculated by solving ray - bundle equations keeping the same grids in each lens plane .",
    "we obtained @xmath103 realizations by randomly shifting the simulation boxes .",
    "after constructing the weak lensing map in the image plane at @xmath100 , the smoothed convergence field are finally computed on @xmath102 grids by convolving the top - hat smoothing kernel .",
    "all the statistical quantities such as one - point pdf and minkowski functionals are evaluated from the data . in a subsequent analysis",
    ", we use the convergence data set fixing the source redshifts to @xmath4 and @xmath5 .      since the lognormal predictions presented in previous section heavily rely on the three parameters , @xmath53 , @xmath104 and @xmath105 , we first check them in some details using the ray - tracing simulations .",
    "figure [ fig : kmin ] shows the minimum value of the convergence , @xmath53 against the smoothing angle .",
    "the error - bars indicate the @xmath106-@xmath44 errors around each mean , where the mean value @xmath53 is obtained from @xmath103 realization data .",
    "as stated in section [ subsec : one - point ] , the convergence @xmath0 evaluated along an empty beam is theoretically considered as a possibility of @xmath53 and expressed from equation ( [ eq : def_kappa ] ) as @xmath107 which implies that the light ray propagates through empty space with @xmath108 everywhere along the line of sight . in figure",
    "[ fig : kmin ] , thick lines represent the theoretical prediction ( [ eq : empty ] ) for each model . clearly , these predictions give much smaller values than the simulation results in both @xmath109 and @xmath110 cases .",
    "in addition to the systematic cosmological model dependences , the scale - dependence of @xmath53 also appears .",
    "these results mean that none of the light rays becomes completely empty beam ( see also jain , seljak & white 1999 ) .",
    "nevertheless , one can not exclude the possibility that some or even the majority of lines of sights become empty at scales smaller than the mean separation angle between particles of n - body simulations . in this sense",
    ", the minimum value @xmath53 could be affected by the finite sampling from a limiting survey size of the convergence map .",
    "based on this consideration , we propose the following intuitive way to explain the behaviors of @xmath53 shown in figure [ fig : kmin ] . assuming that the original pdf of _ infinitesimal _ light rays obeys the lognormal model with the minimum value @xmath111",
    ", one can roughly estimate @xmath53 from the condition that the expectation number of independent sampling area for @xmath112 becomes unity in the field - of - view @xmath113 .",
    "the details of estimation is described in appendix a. for a given angular scale @xmath114 and cosmological model , the quantity @xmath53 is evaluated by solving the equation ( [ eq : kmin ] ) with the prior pdf ( [ eq : prior_pdf ] ) .",
    "the thin lines in figure [ fig : kmin ] depict the estimation based on this prescription , which reasonably agrees with simulations .",
    "this result is interesting in the sense that we could analytically predict @xmath53 and the resultant minimum value is sensitive to the cosmological parameters , especially @xmath11 .",
    "the practical possibility will be again discussed in the final section .",
    "next , turn to focus on the variances of the convergence and its gradient fields . in figure",
    "[ fig : varkappa ] , the measured amplitudes , @xmath115 and @xmath116 , are plotted in linear- and log - scale and are compared with linear ( _ short - dashed _ ) and nonlinear ( _ solid _ ) predictions . for the rms of the convergence @xmath115 ,",
    "the nonlinear prediction based on the peacock & dodds ( 1996 ) formula faithfully reproduces the simulation result over the smoothing angles , @xmath117. on the other hand , in the case of @xmath105 , nonlinear predictions systematically deviate from simulations .",
    "the discrepancy remains even at larger smoothing angles , @xmath118 and causes @xmath119 error .",
    "while the theoretical predictions based on the expressions ( [ eq : var_kappa ] ) and ( [ eq : var_nablakappa ] ) were computed assuming that the mass power spectrum @xmath120 are continuous and has infinite resolution , the simulation data is practically affected by the finite resolution . in our case , the limitation of pm force mesh could be attributed to the finite resolution or the cutoff of fourier modes , which becomes influential even on larger smoothing angles , @xmath121 .",
    "in fact , compared to @xmath104 , dominant contribution to the quantity @xmath105 comes from the short - wavelength modes of three - dimensional density fluctuations , sensitively depending on the choice of the smoothing filter . to show the significance of this effect , nonlinear prediction is modified according to the finite resolution of pm code ( see appendix b ) .",
    "shortly , the fourier - integrals in the expressions of ( [ eq : var_kappa ] ) and ( [ eq : var_nablakappa ] ) are discretized so as to mimic the pm n - body resolution as follows ( eqs.[[eq : discretize]][[eq : delta ] ] in appendix b ) : @xmath122 where @xmath123-th fourier mode @xmath124 is given by @xmath125 and the interval @xmath126 is set to @xmath127 .",
    "the long - dashed lines in figure [ fig : varkappa ] show the results including the finite - resolution effect . in each panel ,",
    "the number of fourier modes , @xmath128 is chosen as @xmath129 ( see discussion in appendix b ) .",
    "it is apparent that the prediction of @xmath116 systematically reduces its power all over the scales and it almost reconciles with the simulation result , although the result of @xmath115 remains unchanged .",
    "we have also examined various cases by changing the maximum number to @xmath130 , but obtained qualitatively similar behavior .",
    "note that the incorrect prediction of @xmath105 leads to a systematic error in predicting the amplitude of the minkowski functionals @xmath75 and @xmath76 from their definitions ( [ eq : v1_log ] ) and ( [ eq : v2_log ] ) , while it does not alter the non - gaussian shapes of those functionals with respect to the level threshold .",
    "keeping up the above remarks in mind , in what follows , to make a comparison with the lognormal models transparent , we use the parameters @xmath104 , @xmath105 and @xmath53 directly estimated from the simulations when plotting the lognormal predictions ( [ eq : logpdf ] ) , ( [ eq : v0_log ] ) , ( [ eq : v1_log ] ) and ( [ eq : v2_log ] ) .        as a quick view of the validity of lognormal model , we first deal with the one - point pdf , @xmath65 .",
    "figures [ fig : pdf_z1 ] and [ fig : pdf_z2 ] show the one - point pdfs of the local convergence in various cdm models with the smoothing angles , @xmath131 , @xmath132 and @xmath133. here , the pdf data is constructed by binning the data with @xmath134 .",
    "the source redshifts are fixed to @xmath109 in figure [ fig : pdf_z1 ] and @xmath135 in figure [ fig : pdf_z2 ] . clearly , the functional form of the one - point pdf becomes broader as increasing the source redshift @xmath10 . on small angular scales ,",
    "the pdf significantly deviates from the gaussian pdf denoted by dashed lines .",
    "although local convergences on larger smoothing scales tend to approach the gaussian form , they still exhibit a non - gaussian tail .    in figures [ fig :",
    "pdf_z1 ] and [ fig : pdf_z2 ] , solid lines represent the lognormal predictions ( [ eq : logpdf ] ) , whose parameters @xmath53 and @xmath104 are directly estimated from simulations .",
    "the agreement between the lognormal model and the simulation results is generally good . in particular , at lower source redshift @xmath109 , the lognormal pdf accurately describes the non - gaussian tails in the high - convergence region up to @xmath136 . in the case of higher source redshift @xmath135 ,",
    "the discrepancy becomes evident at larger smoothing scale .",
    "the lognormal pdf over - predicts in the high - convergence region , and under - predicts in the low - convergence region .",
    "this discrepancy might be ascribed to the projection effect of gravitational lensing ( see eq.[[eq : def_kappa ] ] ) , since the lognormal pdf is obtained based on the approximation ( [ eq : pdf_kappa_del ] ) , which can not be validated as increasing the source redshift @xmath10 .",
    "nevertheless , even in that case , a better agreement between lognormal model and simulations was found at small angular scales .",
    "these features are also seen in figure [ fig : err_pdf ] , where the differences between simulated pdf and lognormal pdf normalized by the simulated pdf , @xmath137/p_{\\rm sim}(\\kappa)$ ] are plotted as a function of level threshold @xmath138 , in the case of lcdm model .",
    "accurate lognormal - fit in the low-@xmath10 case is amazing and is regarded as a considerable success . as a closer look at the non - gaussian tails , however ,",
    "lognormal pdf slightly under - predicts the simulations at low - density region , @xmath139 ( see fig.[fig : pdf_z1 ] and upper - panel of fig.[fig : err_pdf ] ) .",
    "furthermore , at @xmath131 , the simulation results generally tend to deviate from lognormal pdf in the highly non - gaussian tails @xmath140 , although the prediction still remains consistent within the 1-@xmath44 error .",
    "in particular , in the case of the ocdm model , the discrepancy becomes apparent even at @xmath141 .",
    "the systematic deviation seen in non - gaussian tails might be ascribed to the presence of virialized objects .",
    "notice that the angular scale @xmath142 corresponds to the effective smoothing scale @xmath143 at mean redshift @xmath144 .",
    "this indicates that high-@xmath0 value is attained by the light - ray propagating through the high - density region in the very massive halos with @xmath145 .",
    "indeed , highly non - gaussian tails of convergence pdf sensitively depends on the detailed structure of non - linear objects , as pointed out by kruse & schneider ( 2000 ) .",
    "they construct an analytic model of one - point pdf based on the universal profile of dark matter halos and the press - schechter theory for halo abundance .",
    "since the virialized halos induce the highly non - gaussian tails of the local convergence , their treatment would be helpful to describe the non - gaussian tails of pdf .",
    "in contrast , due to the lack of physical bases , no reliable prediction is expected from the empirical lognormal model .",
    "another reason for discrepancy might be the choice of the parameter , @xmath53 .",
    "strictly speaking , minimum value of @xmath0 seen in the simulated pdf represents a rare event for the whole data sets , which are not rigorously equivalent to the averaged value of 40 realization data shown in figure [ fig : kmin ] .",
    "we have also examined the lognormal - fit adopting the minimum value of the pdf data for @xmath53 .",
    "the thin - lines in figure [ fig : err_pdf ] show the results in lcdm case adopting the actual minimum value @xmath0 of each pdf data .",
    "the results seem somehow improved at small angle @xmath131@xmath146 in high-@xmath10 cases , but we rather recognize the fact that lognormal - fit to the high - density region is sensitive to the choice of @xmath53 .    except for these details , lognormal model of one - point pdf remains a fairly accurate model of the convergence field , at least , up to @xmath147 and is indeed applicable even at small angular scales such as @xmath5@xmath6 , irrespective of the assumption , ( [ eq : cumulant_approx ] ) or ( [ eq : pdf_kappa_del ] ) .      having recognized the successful lognormal - fit to the one - point pdf , we next investigate the lognormal model of minkowski functionals .",
    "for this purpose , we restrict our analysis to the source redshift @xmath109 . here , the minkowski functionals for a simulated convergence map are calculated by the method developed by winitzki & kosowsky ( 1997 ) .",
    "figure [ fig : minkow_s2 ] shows the results in various cdm models fixing the smoothing angle @xmath148. the minkowski functionals are plotted against the level threshold @xmath138 with the interval , @xmath149 , so that data in each bin is approximately regarded as statistically independent .",
    "the solid lines depict the lognormal predictions ( [ eq : v0_log ] ) , ( [ eq : v1_log ] ) and ( [ eq : v2_log ] ) .",
    "similar to the one - point pdf , a significant non - gaussian signature is detected from the asymmetric shape of the minkowski functionals , especially from the euler characteristic @xmath76 .",
    "in marked contrast with the gaussian predictions , the lognormal predictions remarkably reproduce the simulation results , not only the shape dependences but also the amplitudes . the agreement between lognormal prediction and simulations still remains accurate over the rather wider range , @xmath150 , where the discrepancy seen in the one - point pdf of the ocdm model is not observed .",
    "since the prediction has no adjustable parameter and only uses the information from an output data , this agreement is successful .",
    "figure [ fig : minkow_lcdm ] depicts the results with various smoothing angles fixing the cosmology to lcdm model . for illustrative purpose , the amplitudes of @xmath75 and @xmath76 at the smoothing angle @xmath151 and @xmath133",

    "the minkowski functionals tend to approach the gaussian prediction as increasing the smoothing angle , consistent with the behaviors of one - point pdf .",
    "the results in other cosmological models are also similar and the agreement between lognormal models and simulations is satisfactory .    to manifest the accuracy of the lognormal - fit in contrast to the other existing analytical models , let us now consider the perturbation predictions . employing the edgeworth expansion ,",

    "in particular , the circumference @xmath169 shows a peculiar behavior , @xmath170 , which is not allowed by definition .",
    "notice that even in these cases , the fractional error @xmath171 $ ] in the lognormal prediction still remains smaller , although the systematic deviations in every model are not so large .    from these discussions",
    ", we conclude that the empirical lognormal models can provide a good approximation for the minkowski functionals , compared to the current existing models .",
    "since the skewness of the local convergence has been proposed as a simple statistical estimator of non - gaussian signature to determine the cosmological parameters , various authors have investigated the usefulness of this quantity using ray - tracing simulations .",
    "these analyses have revealed that the skewness at small - angle @xmath172 exhibits the significant influence of nonlinear clustering and a more reliable theoretical model beyond the perturbation theory is needed . according to these facts , non - perturbative predictions based on the `` hyper - extended perturbation theory''(scoccimarro & frieman 1999 ) or non - linear fitting formula of bi - spectrum(scoccimarro & couchman 2001 )",
    "are examined ( hui , 1998 ; van waerbeke et al .",
    "2001b ) .",
    "in general , the one - point pdf as well as the minkowski functionals characterizes a family of higher - order statistics .",
    "hence , as a consistency check of the lognormal prediction , it seems natural to analyze the higher - order moments of local convergence . from an empirical lognormal pdf ( [ eq : logpdf ] ) , the skewness and the kurtosis of the local convergence defined by @xmath173 and @xmath174 are respectively given by @xmath175 @xmath176    figure [ fig : skewness ] shows the direct measurement of @xmath7 and @xmath8 fixing the source redshift to @xmath109 .",

    "the lognormal predictions ( [ eq : skewness_ln ] ) and ( [ eq : kurtosis_ln ] ) are depicted as solid lines .    in practice , the convergence field @xmath0 in numerical simulation does not extend the entire range between @xmath53 and @xmath177 , but is limited as @xmath178 , due to the finite sampling effect from a limited size of simulation data ( see kayo et al .",
    "2001 in the case of three - dimensional density field @xmath33 ) .",
    "thus , the @xmath123-th order moments of @xmath0 given by @xmath179 may provide a better description in evaluating the skewness @xmath7 and the kurtosis @xmath8 .",
    "the dashed lines in figure [ fig : skewness ] show the lognormal prediction based on the equation ( [ eq : n - th ] ) , where the cutoff parameter @xmath180 is adopted as the averaged maximum value from each realization data .",
    "in contrast to the accurate fit seen in the one - point pdf , the lognormal - fit of skewness and kurtosis seems very poor .",
    "the prediction without cutoff @xmath180 tends to over - predict as increasing smoothing angle , which shows opposite behavior compared to the simulations . as for the lognormal model based on ( [ eq : n - th ] ) ,",
    "while the predictions reduce their amplitudes and broadly agree with simulations in the case of @xmath8 , they still exhibit some systematic discrepancies in @xmath7 .",
    "we have also examined the lognormal - fit adopting the minimum and maximum values of pdf data itself , but the result is not improved drastically .    at first glance , these discrepancies seem to contradict with the results in one - point pdf , however , a closer look at one - point pdf reveals that the lognormal pdfs slightly under - predict the simulation results at the low - density region .",
    "this tiny discrepancy may be ascribed to the overestimation of skewness . in other words ,",
    "the skewness as well as kurtosis is very sensitive to the rare events , i.e , high- and low - convergence parts of the non - gaussian tails .",
    "this sensitivity is clearly shown in the ocdm model .",
    "the simulated pdf at smoothing angle @xmath131 exhibits a highly non - gaussian tails and it overshoots the lognormal prediction ( see upper - right panel in fig.[fig : pdf_z1 ] ) .",
    "the resultant skewness and kurtosis yield values larger than those of lognormal prediction .",
    "on the other hand , in scdm and lcdm models , lognormal pdfs accurately fit to the highly non - gaussian tails and thereby the predictions of skewness and kurtosis becomes relatively consistent with simulations , at least on the small scales , @xmath5@xmath181.    therefore , the lognormal model of convergence does not provide an accurate prediction for the statistics sensitive to the rare events .",
    "this disagreement simply reflects the fact that the empirical lognormal model does not correctly describe projected structure of dark matter halos . on the other hand , a sophisticated non - perturbative model based on the hyper - extended perturbation theory or fitting formula of bi - spectrum",
    "is constructed so as to reproduce the n - body results of higher - order moments , which can provide an accurate prediction for the convergence skewness ( hui , 1998 ; van waerbeke et al .",
    "hence , for the prediction of higher - order moments , the non - perturbative model is more useful and reliable than the lognormal model .",
    "in contrast , the lognormal model fairly describes non - gaussianity around the peak of the pdfs over the broad range , @xmath182 , which can not be described by such a non - perturbative model .",
    "thus , at least as a complementary approach , the lognormal model is useful beyond the perturbative theory , and applicable in characterizing the one - point pdf and the minkowski functionals .",
    "in the present paper , we have quantitatively investigated the extent to which the lognormal model fairly describes the statistics of weak lensing fields on linear and nonlinear scales using the ray - tracing simulations .",
    "the validity of lognormal model has been checked in details by comparing the lognormal predictions of the one - point pdf and the minkowski functionals of convergence field with their simulation results .",
    "the convergence field seen in the one - point pdf and the minkowski functionals displays the non - gaussian feature and significantly deviates from the gaussian predictions .",
    "we have shown that the analytic formulae for lognormal models are useful and accurately describe the simulation results on both small and large smoothing angular scales in the case of the low-@xmath10 data , while the perturbative prediction by edgeworth expansion fails to reproduce the simulation results on small scales because of the nonlinearity of the underlying three - dimensional density field .",
    "the detailed comparison revealed that the lognormal model does not provide an accurate prediction for the statistics sensitive to the rare events such as the skewness and kurtosis of the convergence .",
    "we therefore conclude that , as long as we are concerned with the appropriate range of the convergence , @xmath182 , the lognormal model empirically but quantitatively gives a useful approximation characterizing the non - gaussianity features on the convergence field .",
    "the results obtained here will lead to an important improvement for the estimation of cosmological parameters using the minkowski functionals ( sato , takada , jing & futamase 2001 ) . although the original methodology has been proposed with the use of the edgeworth formulae , ( [ eq : v0_edge])-([eq : v2_edge ] ) , a more reliable estimation of cosmological parameters will be possible using the lognormal models . in the light of this , a reliable theoretical prediction for the model parameters of the lognormal formulae @xmath53 , @xmath104 and @xmath105 should be further explored . as shown in figures [ fig : kmin ] and [ fig : varkappa ] , the simulation results reveal that @xmath53 is very sensitive to the density parameter @xmath11 , while the @xmath104 and @xmath105 depend on @xmath11 and @xmath183 .",
    "such predictions will offer a new opportunity to determine the cosmological parameters , independently of the method using the higher - order moment , @xmath7 .",
    "in particular , if we do not focus on the overall normalization of the minkowski functionals @xmath75 and @xmath76 controlled by the @xmath104 and @xmath105 , the non - gaussian features on those functionals are primarily controlled by @xmath53 , and , for example , the intuitive way to predict @xmath53 discussed in appendix a could be used in constraining @xmath184 . of course ,",
    "for proper comparison with observation , there are other systematic effects we have to take into account .",
    "one is the redshift distribution of source galaxies .",
    "another important effect is the contamination by the intrinsic source ellipticity .",
    "this not only reduces the signal - to - noise ratio , but also systematically affects the non - gaussianity of the weak lensing signal ( jain , seljak & white 2000 ) .",
    "these effects should be correctly incorporated into the lognormal predictions .",
    "these issues are now in progress , and will be presented elsewhere .",
    "the statistics of cosmic shear directly reflect the statistical feature of mass distribution and using this fact , one might even discriminate the nature of dark matter .",
    "furthermore , the weak lensing statistics have a potential to reveal the nonlinear and stochastic properties of galaxy biasing . in any cases",
    ", we expect that the lognormal property of the weak lensing field is helpful and plays an important role in extracting the various cosmological information .",

    "let us roughly estimate the minimum value , @xmath53 .",
    "assuming that the _ prior _ one - point pdf , @xmath185 is approximately described by the lognormal pdf , in which the minimum value is characterized by @xmath111 instead of the actual value @xmath53 : @xmath186 ^ 2}{2{\\sigma_{\\rm ln}}^2 } \\right\\}\\,\\frac{d\\kappa}{\\kappa+|{\\kappa_{\\scriptscriptstyle\\rm empty}}|},\\ ] ] with the quantity @xmath187 being @xmath188 .",
