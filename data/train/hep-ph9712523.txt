    "in the last years a systematic description of non - perturbative effects in qcd has been given in terms of the gluon field - strength correlators @xcite .",
    "they are of immediate phenomenological importance in the model of stochastic confinement of color charge , giving a detailed description of the level splitting of heavy and light @xmath0 bound states , and in the description of high - energy hadron and quark-(anti)quark scattering @xcite . by now , there exist numerical results from lattice simulations concerning the fundamental field strength correlators for pure gauge theory with gauge groups @xmath1 @xcite and @xmath2 @xcite over physical distances ranging up to @xmath3 fm .",
    "the correlators have also been calculated near to the deconfinement transition in pure @xmath2 gauge theory @xcite .",
    "very recently , this study has been extended to full qcd with four flavours of dynamical staggered quarks @xcite . in this latter work , an interesting pattern of the quark mass dependence both of the gluon condensate and of the gluonic correlation length has emerged .",
    "the correlation length smoothly changes from the lightest quark mass to the quenched results .",
    "the extraction of the gluon condensate itself is afflicted with some reservations about the renormalon ambiguity in the determination of the wilson coefficients of the operator product expansion . in ref .",
    "@xcite this problem is finally neglected .",
    "as demonstrated there , the emerging mass dependence can be consistently described by a low energy theorem which relates it to the zero - mass case through the quark condensate .",
    "the real problem hard to understand is the much stronger gluon condensate for pure yang mills theory .    in the direct computations of the gluonic field strength correlators on the lattice",
    "the non - perturbative behaviour has been extracted with a cooling procedure which serves the purpose to erase short - range perturbative fluctuations .",
    "then at various distances @xmath4 ( in lattice step units ) gauge field structures are expected to become visible in the correlator if an appropriate number of cooling iterations ( @xmath5 due to the diffusive nature of cooling ) is applied . in view of these results",
    "it has become very likely that the field correlators have a semiclassical origin and might provide information about the importance and the physical parameters of those classical configurations forming the basis of the semiclassical approximation .",
    "instantons - solutions of the euclidean yang mills field equations - are well - known examples of semiclassical configurations , which exist both in the continuum and on the lattice .",
    "their contribution to the path integral quantization plays an important role in explaining chiral symmetry breaking and many phenomenological facts ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "it seems quite in time to compute the field strength correlation functions within a semiclassical model based on instantons and to point out to what extent the latter are able to describe the results of the lattice measurements mentioned above . in principle , such a comparison should enable us to quantify the importance of the semiclassical modes forming the qcd vacuum or finite - temperature euclidean fields , respectively , and to provide their relevant physical parameters .    performing the analysis of field strength correlators with the simplest instanton solutions we will restrict ourselves to the @xmath6 case , being aware that the embedding into a larger @xmath7 gauge group can be easily realized .",
    "therefore , the parameters of instanton densities and sizes we are going to determine from a comparison with lattice data will always refer to the physical @xmath8 case .",
    "earlier studies of field strength correlators due to instantons can be found in @xcite .",
    "there the results for the single instanton approximation were obtained in terms of two - dimensional integrals . here",
    "we pay particular attention to the path dependence of the phase factors .",
    "this can only be done numerically which was beyond the scope of these papers .",
    "@xcite points out the insufficiency of the single instanton approximation .",
    "we study here also the next order terms in a density expansion . with the numerically evaluated invariant functions , we estimate instanton density and size .",

    "only @xmath24 receives a contribution from one - gluon exchange @xcite .",
    "on very general grounds the perturbative contribution to @xmath25 ( which appears at one loop and higher orders ) was recently shown to be cancelled by higher correlator contributions @xcite . here",
    ", we shall not discuss the perturbative contributions in more detail .",
    "instead we will concentrate on the contribution from semiclassical configurations .",

    "we are going to compare with lattice simulation data which are taken partly in full qcd , partly within the quenched approximation when the fermionic backreaction on the weight is neglected . in our estimates only density and size of instantons play a role which are - in the case of full qcd - influenced by the effect of the fermionic determinant .",
    "the instanton solution of the euclidean field equations is taken with its algebraic form in the evaluation of the field strength and of the schwinger lines .",
    "the resulting expressions are then contributing in leading order to the functional average .    at this place",
    "let us make a general statement concerning the leading order contribution of pure ( anti-)selfdual gauge field configurations to the field strength correlators .",

    "the correlation lengths estimated are compatible with the results mentioned before .",
    "next we want to work out the lowest order semiclassical approximation for the field - strength correlator by separating the gaussian integral over quantum fluctuations on top of a single classical background field from the gauge invariant product of field strengths simply evaluated for that classical field .",
    "what then remains are zero - mode integrations over the appropriate set of collective coordinates @xmath66 characterizing the classical field with a density function @xmath67 ,    @xmath68    where @xmath69 is the field strength tensor corresponding to configurations @xmath70 . to be more specific",

    "if the instanton liquid or gas is sufficiently dilute we can approximate the functional integral by an expansion in powers of the ( anti-)instanton densities @xmath82 ( @xmath83 ) .    strictly speaking ,",
    "the superposition ansatz ( [ okt_25_2 ] ) makes sense as an approximate saddle point of the action only if the vector potentials @xmath84 @xmath85 decrease fast enough .",
    "this happens when the singular gauge expression is used for the ( anti- ) instanton solutions @xmath84 @xmath85 , instead of the regular gauge form @xcite .",
    "the existence of a systematic expansion in higher order contributions to the measure @xmath86 has been proven in ref .",
    "it will be pointed out in the next section that , as long as one remains within the single instanton approximation , the actual choice between an instanton in the regular or singular gauge does not matter if the field strength correlator is evaluated on this background with a straight line schwinger phase factor inserted . in the calculation of interference terms containing @xmath87 and @xmath88 ,",
    "however , the choice of the singular gauge form of solution is essential , and will be used in section [ sect.4 ] .",

    "we emphasize , that the schwinger line phase operator is a path dependent matrix in the fundamental representation @xmath92 where the vector potential @xmath93 , in leading order of an expansion in the density , belongs to the single instanton source localized at @xmath94 .",
    "together with its adjoint , @xmath95 , @xmath96 takes care of the parallel transport of the field strength tensor @xmath97 from one point of the measurement to the other .",

    "the thooft tensor @xmath100 ( and @xmath101 for the anti - instanton ) is defined in @xcite .",

    "the schwinger line can be written explicitely @xmath104 where @xmath105 are the pauli matrices and @xmath106 denotes a point running from @xmath102 to @xmath103 relative to the instanton center @xmath94 .",
    "the schwinger line can be conveniently parametrized with @xmath107 and @xmath108 as follows @xmath109 where @xmath110 and @xmath111 here @xmath112 denotes the components of a unit vector in isotopic space , @xmath113 in what follows we shall compare the straigth line case ( [ eq54]) ( [ eq58 ] ) with a special case when the schwinger ( path dependent ) phase factor becomes trivial as @xmath114 for all points @xmath102 and @xmath103 .",
    "this happens if the path connects the points @xmath102 and @xmath103 via the instanton center @xmath94 along the two radial rays . in this case",

    "the correlator with the straight schwinger line is roughly @xmath144 % smaller than for the @xmath145 case in accordance to the estimate , and correspondingly the half width is smaller by roughly one third . in the estimation of the ( anti-)instanton density and size below , the numerically calculated correlator with this minimal , straight path schwinger line should be used .",

    "the comparison of the considered correlators with lattice data at zero temperature @xcite , @xcite , shows the following .",
    "the nonperturbative part of the correlator @xmath63 can be reasonably described by the mixed @xmath166 gas ( see fig .",
    "it was shown analytically that selfdual configurations contribute only to the correlators @xmath29 and @xmath30 in the leading order of the density expansion , while @xmath31 appears only in the second order .",
    "this may explain qualitatively the large ratio @xmath167 found in lattice simulations @xcite .",
    "another interesting result is that non - positivity of @xmath31 is characteristic for the instanton gas model .",
    "we have demonstrated that this feature is compatible with lattice data .",
    "moreover , we have argued that this might be even favourable from a phenomenological point of view .",
    "the fitted values of the instanton densities turn out to be large in the case of quenched simulations ( several instantons per @xmath168 ) . to describe this case consistently within the instanton density expansion a medium correction for the instanton profile @xcite",
    "must be taken into account . in the case of full qcd",
    "( with dynamical fermions ) the situation is more safe for the naive instanton superposition . for this case ,",
    "the estimated values for instanton density and radius are found in the right ballpark known from instanton phenomenology , as well as the estimated gluon and quark condensate values extracted from the lattice data were consistent with qcd sumrules .    in this paper",
    "the effect of the inclusion of parallel transporters ( schwinger lines @xmath169 ) into a semiclassical calculation ( and the path dependence ) has been studied for the first time .",
    "it is displayed in fig .",
    "1 that the effect ( compared with a choice of path with @xmath145 ) is of the order of @xmath144 % in the region of physical interest .",
    "we did not discuss here the question whether instantons , which yield phenomenologically realistic hadron correlators @xcite give a complete description of the qcd vacuum configurations .",
    "the point is that the dilute instanton gas model ( also in the way we have treated it here ) does not confine . within the vacuum correlator model ,",
    "the nonzero contribution to the string tension which would be obtained from our correlator @xmath29 , would be cancelled by higher correlators ( see @xcite for discussion and more references ) .",
    "therefore to get realistic vacuum there are at least two possibilities : to modify the instanton model in a way that instantons give only contributions of gaussian nature ( some gaussian instanton ensemble ) or to assume additional contributions , like dyons and antidyons .",
