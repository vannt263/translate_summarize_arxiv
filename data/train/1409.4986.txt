    "several bulk parameter quantities help understanding the nuclear matter properties . one of them is the symmetry energy @xmath11 , that can be expanded as a function of the nuclear density @xmath12 as @xmath13 , where @xmath14 and @xmath5 is the nuclear matter saturation density .",
    "the coefficients of this expansion , namely , @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath8 and @xmath15 are , respectively , the symmetry energy at the saturation density , the slope , curvature , and third derivative ( skewness ) of @xmath16 , all of them also evaluated at @xmath17 . the symmetry energy is important to model nuclear matter and finite nuclei , by probing the isospin part of nuclear interactions .",
    "particularly , it is also important in different issues of astrophysics  @xcite . for a study of the effects of @xmath1 and @xmath2 on neutron star properties such as the minimum mass that enables the urca effect ,",
    "see , for instance , ref .",
    "@xcite .    a compelling feature of the nuclear matter bulk parameter study has been to investigate correlations among them .",
    "the investigation on correlations between observables is an important issue in physics since the knowledge of one observable may carry information about other . in nuclear physics , particularly ,",
    "an exact nucleon - nucleon interaction is unknown , which leads this area to deal with different proposals of nuclear forces .",
    "usually , the free parameters of nuclear models are eliminated in favor of a set of observables .",
    "therefore , in nuclear physics , correlations between two observables acquire an enormous importance because it reduces the set of independent relevant quantities to be used in the nuclear models construction , avoiding redundant free parameters fittings  @xcite .",
    "there are few well established correlations between nuclear bulk parameters .",
    "one of them , usually known as coester line  @xcite , correlates @xmath5 and the nuclear matter binding energy @xmath6 .",
    "another one was studied by furnstahl - rusnak - serot ( frs )  @xcite and reports the correlation between the finite nuclei spin - orbit splittings and the ratio @xmath18 for a family of effective finite range ( fr ) relativistic mean - field ( rmf ) models .",
    "@xmath19 is the dirac effective mass of the nucleon in symmetric nuclear matter at @xmath20 .",
    "the results show that good values for these splittings are obtained by a restricted class of fr models that present @xmath21 in a range of @xmath22",
    ". hereafter we will refer this range as the frs constraint .",

    "such a study was based on numerical results for @xmath1 and @xmath2 , obtained from different parametrizations .",
    "we also call the reader attention for previous investigations on analytical expressions for @xmath1 and @xmath2 in relativistic and nonrelativistic many - nucleon models in refs .  @xcite .",
    "theoretically , @xmath1 and @xmath2 are expected to be constrained  @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , no analytical relationship between these quantities is known up to now .",
    "that is why we find important to have a way to relate analytically both quantities . in order to proceed in this direction in our paper ,",
    "we have chosen to follow three steps to simplify the fr models which parametrize the infinite nuclear matter bulk parameters and finite nuclei properties  @xcite .",
    "first , we select fr models containing cubic and quartic interactions in the scalar field @xmath0 , i. e. , we choose models with @xmath23 and @xmath24 contributions in their lagrangian density .",
    "basically , they are known as boguta - bodmer models  @xcite .",
    "second , we use their point - coupling versions  @xcite .",
    "it is needed to emphasize here that the point - coupling models are as good as the fr ones in the description of nuclear matter and finite nuclei .",
    "for instance , in ref .",
    "@xcite , the authors were able to obtain , by using a relativistic zero range model , ground state binding energies , spin - orbit splittings , and rms charge radii of a large set of closed shell nuclei , as well as , of nuclei outside the valley of beta stability ( see their tables viii and x ) , clearly showing the success of these kind of model .",
    "as a side remark , the linear point - coupling model and the walecka one are exactly the same , as one can see in ref .  @xcite .",
    "third , we perform a nonrelativistic ( nr ) limit of the point - coupling models , based on normalized spinor wave functions after small component reduction , exactly in the same way as developed in ref .",
    "such a procedure was already used in ref .",
    "@xcite , in which very good results were found for @xmath25 .",
    "following these steps , we were able to write , in an analytical way , @xmath2 and @xmath8 as a function of @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath21 , and @xmath28 ( incompressibility at the saturation density ) .",
    "our results indicate that both approaches , namely , the nr limit and the models , suggest a decreasing of @xmath2 when @xmath21 increases whereas the @xmath2 dependence on @xmath28 is very weak .",
    "similar behavior is also found regarding the @xmath21 and @xmath7 dependence of @xmath8 . in the case of symmetry energy slope",
    ", we also could predict a linear correlation between @xmath2 and @xmath1 , that was also supported by the exact calculations .",
    "in particular cases ( models presenting close values for @xmath28 ) , our nr calculations also indicate another linear correlation for two distinct cases , namely , ( i ) between @xmath8 and @xmath2 for fixed values of @xmath1 , or ( ii ) between @xmath8 and @xmath1 for fixed values of @xmath2 . these results",
    "are also confirmed by the relativistic models submitted to the same conditions .",
    "our paper is organized as follows . in sec .",

    "[ pred ] , we present , based on these correlations , the predictions on the exact models , also proposing new constraints that such models should satisfy in order to exhibit good values for finite nuclei spin - orbit splittings . finally , in sec .  [ sum - con ] , the mainly conclusion are summarized .",
    "the relativistic nonlinear point - coupling ( nlpc ) versions of the boguta - bodmer models are described by the following lagrangian density @xmath29 that mimics the two , three and four body point - like interactions with the fermionic spinor field @xmath30 associated to the nucleon of mass @xmath31 . in this equation ,",
    "the last term was included in order to take into account the asymmetry of the system ( different number of protons and neutrons ) . in the nonrelativistic limit of the nlpc model , and",
    "using the mean - field approach , the energy density functional at zero temperature for asymmetric nuclear matter is written as @xmath32 where the effective mass is @xmath33 with @xmath34 $ ] , @xmath35 , and being the proton fraction of the system .",

    "the first four of them are adjusted in order to fix @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath19 .",
    "this is done by solving a system of four equations , namely , , @xmath43 , @xmath44 ( nuclear matter saturation ) , and @xmath45 .",
    "the pressure and incompressibility are defined , respectively , by @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "an advantage of this approach is to obtain simple analytical expressions for the equations of state ( eos ) of the model , in comparison to those calculated in the exact fr models .",
    "it is worth to mention that in the eos of the nr limit of the nlpc models , there are no quantities found in a self - consistent way .",
    "all observables are functions of @xmath12 and @xmath48 , as one can see , for instance , in eq .",
    "( [ eassi ] ) .",
    "thus , the study of the correlation between the symmetry energy and its slope can be performed analytically . for this purpose , we first use eq .",

    "then , @xmath50 is given by @xmath51 the symmetry energy @xmath52 is used again in order to obtain @xmath53 .",
    "the result is @xmath54 from eq .",
    "( [ esymass - nr ] ) it is possible to determine the last coupling constant @xmath55 , by imposing the model to present a particular value for @xmath1 .    at this point , we rewrite the coupling constants of the model , namely , @xmath56 , @xmath57 , @xmath40 , and @xmath41 , in terms of the bulk parameters @xmath21 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , and @xmath28 . an analogous procedure is done in the context of the skyrme models in ref .",

    "usually , in nuclear mean - field models , the binding energy and the saturation density are well established close around the values of and .",
