    "the study of gravitationally lensed quasars has become a powerful tool for addressing a number of astrophysical questions . in particular , concentrating on studying the lensing objects themselves provides a sample of distant galaxies selected by mass rather than by light ( kochanek et al .",
    "1999 ) . because the component separations scale with the square root of the mass of the lens , sampling the low end of the lens mass function becomes difficult from the ground , particularly in the optical / ir , for separations @xmath2 .",
    "this observational bias leads to a preponderance of massive spheroidal galaxies in the present sample of lenses and at least partly accounts for the relative lack of known close - separation lenses , which are predicted to exist by theoretical models of the lensing phenomenon ( e.g.  maoz & rix 1993 ; rix et al .",
    "1994 ; jain et al .",
    "there are currently only seven systems with separations @xmath3 out of 43 confirmed lensed quasars listed by kochanek et al .",
    "( 1998 ) .",
    "we are now well into a cycle  8 snapshot survey of up to 300 targets , aimed specifically at finding close - separation lensed quasars using the imaging capabilities of stis ( kimble et al .",
    "1997 ; woodgate et al .",
    "1998 ) on board the hubble space telescope .",
    "the probability that a quasar is lensed increases with redshift and apparent magnitude ( turner , ostriker , & gott 1984 ) ; the snapshot survey targets bright , high redshifts quasars selected using estimates for the probability of lensing by kochanek ( 1998 ) .",
    "the results of the full snapshot survey will appear in time ( gregg et al .",
    "2000 , in prep . )",
    "; here we report the discovery of a close - separation gravitationally lensed quasar from among the first 80 snapshot targets .",
    "the quasar he  0512@xmath03329 was originally identified in the hamburg / eso survey for bright qso s ( wisotzki et al .",
    "1996 ) . with @xmath4 = 17.0 and z = 1.569 ( reimers , khler , & wisotzki 1996 )",
    ", he  0512@xmath03329 had an a priori probability of @xmath5 of being lensed , fairly typical for the targets in our snapshot survey .",
    "the stis snapshot sequence , obtained on 1999 august 26 , consists of @xmath6s cr - split exposures in the clear 50ccd ( cl ) aperture and one additional 80s cr - split exposure in the longpass f28@xmath750lp ( lp ) filter .",
    "the effective wavelength and full width half maximum of the cl band are 6167.6and 4410  and for the lp band are 7333  and 2721 .",
    "the stis images reveal two point sources with a separation of 0644 .",
    "the difference in brightness between the two components  a and b is @xmath8 and @xmath9 ; this small difference is characteristic of the more highly magnified lensed systems , which our selection technique is designed to favor .",
    "the lensing hypothesis was strengthened by examining the discovery spectrum of he  0512@xmath03329 which shows a rather typical quasar energy distribution having emission lines of  1549 and ]  1909 ( see figure  1 of reimers et al .",
    "if one of the two components were a garden variety galactic star , the strongest stellar absorption lines would be easily identifiable ( see below , ",
    "a binary quasar is a possible alternative explanation ( kochanek , falco , & muoz 1999 ) , however , the discovery spectrum exhibits a strong absorption feature consistent with  at an intervening redshift of 0.93 , and a few weaker absorption lines of  at the same redshift .",
    "these low - ionization absorption features suggested that the duplicity is due to a lensing object at this redshift .      in early 2000",
    "january , we obtained a 9  resolution spectrum of he  0512@xmath03329 using the low resolution imaging spectrograph ( lris , oke et al .",
    "1995 ) at keck observatory .",
    "the slit was oriented at the position angle of the two quasar images on the sky , 17 .",
    "the seeing was 1 , insufficient to resolve the components . from this 300s exposure ( figure  1 )",
    ", we obtain a redshift of @xmath10 based on gaussian fits to the  and ]  emission peaks .",
    "the s / n of this new spectrum is 50 to 100 over most of its wavelength range and confirms the presence of the strong intervening absorption , clearly resolving the  2796.4 , 2803.5 doublet and detecting the associated  2853 line .",
    "also seen is a rich absorption system of  2260.8 , 2344.2 , 2374.5 , 2382.8 , 2586.7 , and 2600.2 , and  4227.9 belonging to the same intervening system ;  3933 and 3969 fall in the atmospheric a band .",
    "the mean of the absorption redshifts is z = @xmath11 .",
    "the profile of the emission line is asymmetric , which can be attributed to absorption by  3721.0 or intervening  local to the quasar .",
    "there is another weak intervening  absorption feature at z=1.1346 .",
    "component  b is 70% the brightness of a. the lack of any discernible stellar absorption features in the keck spectrum ( figure  1 ) argues strongly against component  b being a foreground star .",
    "the rms noise in the spectrum is at the level of 0.15  equivalent width .",
    "the strongest features in late type stars have equivalent widths of a few ngstroms and would be detected easily in the keck spectrum ; for comparison , the equivalent width of the intervening  2853feature is 1.4 .",
    "the only possible stellar contaminant is a completely featureless o - type subdwarf or white dwarf and such stars are extremely rare . if this were the case , however , the spectrum of he  0512@xmath03329 would be much bluer , unless either the qso or the putative star has a large amount of intrinsic reddening .      we have done point - spread function ( psf ) fitting photometry on the stis images using iraf / daophot . from observations of an unlensed quasar in our program , we obtain aperture corrections of @xmath12 and @xmath13 for the cl and lp bands , to go from the fitted 3 pixel radius to 05 . to this",
    "we add an additional @xmath14 magnitudes to correct to the `` true '' magnitude in an infinite aperture , as is standard practice with wfpc2 ( holtzman et al .",
    "the resulting calibrated stis `` stmagnitudes '' and errors are listed in table  1 .",
    "the @xmath15 bandpass is completely contained within the @xmath16 . because they are similar in shape , the @xmath15 flux can be scaled by the relative throughputs and subtracted from the @xmath16 , producing an effective `` shortpass '' measurement ( gregg & minniti 1997 ; gardner et al.2000 ) extending from 5500  to 2000 , with effective wavelength of 4424  and fwhm of 2569 .",
    "the @xmath17 difference provides some wide - band color information ( table  1 ) .    in 1999 december , we obtained vri photometry of he  0512@xmath03329 using the mosaic  ii ccd imager at the blanco 4 m telescope at cerro tololo inter - american observatory .",
    "although the seeing was @xmath18 and the two components are not cleanly resolved , point - spread function ( psf ) fitting using iraf / daophot successfully separated them , yielding positions in excellent agreement with the hst images and photometry consistent with the stis results .",
    "the separations obtained in v , r , and i are 0654 , 0646 , and 0643 , respectively , compared to 0644 obtained from the centroids of the components in the stis cl images .",
    "no photometric standards were taken at ctio , so we have calibrated the ctio photometry using zeropoints determined by convolving the keck spectrophotometry with cousins vri passbands .",
    "this procedure is itself calibrated using a model for the spectrum of vega ( kurucz 1992 ) for which we adopt @xmath19 .",
    "slit losses limit the absolute accuracy , but , fortuitously , the spectroscopy was obtained when the position angle of he  0512@xmath03329 was only 23  from the parallactic angle . because the effective slit width was somewhat greater than the atmospheric dispersion between the red and blue extremes of the spectrum ( filippenko 1982 ) , the colors obtained from the composite spectrum are reasonably accurate and can be used to establish the relative zeropoints of the vri photometry .",
    "also , we have determined a zeropoint transformation between the effective stis sp bandpass and johnson b using the mean quasar spectrum ( brotherton et al .",
    "2000 ) from the first bright quasar survey ( fbqs ; white et al.2000 ) , redshifted to z=1.565 .",
    "the resulting colors of he  0512@xmath03329 are @xmath20 for component  a , and @xmath21 for component  b ( table  1 ) .",
    "schlegel , finkbeiner , & davis ( 1998 ) estimate a galactic extinction of @xmath22 for this line of sight ; burstein & heiles ( 1982 ) give a much lower value of 0.010 .",
    "the numbers in table  1 have not been corrected for galactic extinction .",

    "the broad band colors of component  b are , in fact , more consistent with a slightly reddened quasar than a star .    for future reference for monitoring variability of the lens components , we list in table  2 the instrumental magnitude differences , @xmath26 , for nine field stars with @xmath27 to 18 in the vicinity of he  0512@xmath03329 .",
    "the astrometry has been derived from the digitized sky survey and has an offset of @xmath28 and @xmath29 relative to the stis images , but these positions are sufficient to unambiguously identify the comparison stars .",

    "although the third object is not detected with confidence in the lp image , the low surface brightness light distribution is qualitatively reproduced in the redder passband .",
    "no such excess light is seen when the same analysis is applied to an image of an unlensed quasar from our snapshot program .",

    "this trend can be attributed to differential reddening , with extinction along the line of sight to component  a being greater .",

    "( 1999 ) . in this approach",
    ", it is assumed that the quasar is not variable , that the lensing magnification is not wavelength dependent , and that the extinction law does not vary with position in the lensing galaxy and is well - approximated by a typical galactic extinction curve with @xmath42 . correcting a sign error in equation  3 of falco et al .",

    "the summations are over the 4 bandpasses , @xmath52 and @xmath53 , and two components , a and b.    relative magnifications and extinctions can be found by minimizing @xmath54 while holding one magnification fixed at unity and one extinction at 0 . as component  b is bluer and fainter , we fix its parameters at these values .",
    "the extinction law has been parametrized using the equations of cardelli , clayton , & mathis ( 1989 ) .",
    "for this analysis , we first corrected the photometry listed in table  1 for galactic extinction of @xmath55 from schlegel et al .",
    "( 1998 ) .",
    "the fit for the relative extinction results in the estimate of @xmath56 for component  a , in excess of the extinction at component  b ; the unextincted , wavelength independent relative magnification of a is 2.45 times that of b. the @xmath54 of this fit is 0.66 . for comparison ,",
    "a fit with both extinctions held to zero yields a relative magnification of 1.35 , roughly consistent with the brightness difference between the two components in @xmath57 or @xmath58 .",
    "the @xmath54 for this fit is 67 , as might be expected given the varying magnitude difference between the two components as a function of wavelength , which renders an achromatic magnification model a poor explanation of the brightness variation with wavelength .",
    "the separate extinctions to each component of he  0512@xmath03326 can be estimated by assuming that the unlensed quasar spectrum has typical colors . after correcting for galactic reddening using the schlegel et al .",
    "( 1998 ) value , the difference in @xmath24 between the composite spectrum of he  0512@xmath03326 ( figure  1 ) and the fbqs mean spectrum is 0.31 . with @xmath59 , this is equivalent to @xmath60 . knowing the @xmath57 magnitudes and relative extinction , the separate extinctions can be computed as @xmath61 and @xmath62 , excluding any grey component .",
    "given the multitude of assumptions and the bootstrapping from the spectrophotometry , these numbers must be considered provisional , but they do suggest that the extinction to each component is comparable and that both lines of sight intercept the same or similar absorption systems .",
    "spectroscopy of the two components separately would allow a detailed study of the extinction curve in the disk of the lensing galaxy and would also determine whether microlensing could be contributing to the pattern of color differences .",
    "the presently available data leave little doubt that he  0512@xmath03329 is gravitationally lensed .",
    "the spectroscopic evidence strongly suggests that the lens is a spiral galaxy .",
    "spatially resolved spectroscopy of the two images of he  0512@xmath03329 is needed to confirm its nature ; however , the presence of strong low - ionization lines in the composite spectrum indicates that at least one of the lines of sight is sure to pass through a damped ly@xmath1 system in the disk of the lens .",
    "ultraviolet spectroscopy of the a and b components can further be used to derive the extinction curve in the disk of the lens as well as abundances of heavy elements .",
    "this lensed quasar has been found among the first 80 targets of an hst cycle  8 snapshot program designed to search for such small separation systems .",
    "the program was renewed for up to 300 additional snapshots in cycle  9 .",
