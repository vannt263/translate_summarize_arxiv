    "the @xmath0-state potts model@xcite in two dimensions has been investigated intensively as the test ground for analyzing the phase transition in many physical systems .",
    "especially it is interesting because the order of the phase transition changes when the parameter @xmath0 is varied , i.e. , from the first order for @xmath2 to the second order for @xmath4 .",
    "the amplitudes of many quantities at the first order transition point are known exactly , including the latent heat , the spontaneous magnetization@xcite and the correlation length@xcite .",
    "et al._@xcite made a stimulating conjecture on the asymptotic behavior of the energy cumulants ( including the specific heat ) at the first order transition point .",
    "et al._@xcite also made the large-@xmath0 expansion of the energy cumulants to order 10 in @xmath5 and analyzing the expansion series with the conjecture they could give the estimates of the cumulants at the transition point for @xmath6 that are better than those given by other methods including the monte carlo simulations@xcite and the low-(and high-)temperature expansions@xcite .",
    "the series obtained by bhattacharya _",
    "et al . _ are , however , not long enough to investigate the behavior of the energy cumulants for @xmath0 closer to @xmath7 .    here using the finite lattice method@xcite",
    "we have generated the large-@xmath0 series for the energy cumulants and the magnetization cumulants at the transition point to order 21 or 23 in @xmath8@xcite .",
    "the finite lattice method can in general give longer series than those obtained by the diagrammatic method especially in lower space ( and time ) dimensions . in the diagrammatic method , one has to list up all the relevant diagrams and count the number they appear . in the finite lattice method",
    "we can skip this job and reduce the main work to the calculation of the partition function for a series of finite size lattices , which can be done without the diagrammatic technique .",
    "this method has been used mainly to generate the low- and high - temperature series in statistical systems and the strong coupling series in lattice gauge theory .",
    "one of the purposes of our work is to demonstrate that this method is also applicable to the series expansion with respect to the parameter other than the temperature or the coupling constant .",
    "the latent heat @xmath9 and the correlation length @xmath10 at the transition point are known to vanish and diverge , respectively , at @xmath11 as @xmath12 with @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "s conjecture says that the @xmath15-th energy cumulants @xmath16 at the first order transition point @xmath17 will diverge at @xmath11 as @xmath18 this is from the fact that for @xmath19 at @xmath20 ( the second order phase transition ) the correlation length and the second cumulants diverge as @xmath21 and @xmath22 , respectively , so that @xmath23 and from the assumption that this relation between the correlation length and the energy cumulants are also kept for @xmath11 with @xmath17 .",
    "the constants @xmath24 and @xmath25 in eq.([eq : asymp_form ] ) should be common to the ordered and disordered phases from the duality relation for each @xmath15-th cumulants .    . the specific heat for some values of @xmath0 .",
    "the exact correlation length is also listed . [ cols=\">,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "the large-@xmath0 series for the energy and magnetization cumulants generated by the finite lattice method in the two - dimensional @xmath0-state potts model give very precise estimates of the cumulants for @xmath2 and they confirm the correctness of the conjecture that the relation between the cumulants and the correlation length for @xmath20 and @xmath26 ( the second order phase transition ) is kept in their asymptotic behavior for @xmath27 at @xmath17 ( the first order transition point ) .",
    "if this kind of relation is satisfied for the quantities at the first order phase transition point in more general systems as the asymptotic behavior when the parameter of the system is varied to make the system close to the second order phase transition point , it would serve as a good guide in investigating the property of the system .",
