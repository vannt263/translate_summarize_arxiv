    "the einstein static universe in general relativity ( gr ) is a closed friedman - robertson - walker ( frw ) model that is unstable to homogeneous perturbations  @xcite .",
    "( note that it is neutrally stable to inhomogeneous scalar perturbations with high enough sound speed and to vector and tensor perturbations  @xcite . )",
    "the stability of einstein static models in high - energy modifications of gr is an interesting mathematical question , and is also relevant for scenarios in which the einstein static is an initial state for a past - eternal inflationary cosmology , the so - called emergent universe scenario  @xcite .",
    "the standard model of cosmology ( see e.g. @xcite ) has a flat infinite spatial geometry , and experiences a period of primordial inflationary expansion , which is preceded by a big bang singularity in the classical theory .",
    "observations however do not prove that the geometry is flat : the universe could have nonzero spatial curvature , as long as the late - time effect of this curvature is very small . in particular , a positive curvature allows for an  emergent universe \" that originates asymptotically in the past as an einstein static universe , and then inflates and later reheats to a hot big bang era .",
    "this model generalizes the eddington - lematre model  @xcite , and is a counter - example to the notion that inflation can never be past - eternal and thus can not avoid an initial singularity  because it is closed , it avoids the theorems showing that inflation can not be past eternal  @xcite .",
    "generalizations of the einstein static solution in high - energy modifications to gr have been considered in the randall - sundrum braneworld scenario  @xcite and in @xmath1 theories  @xcite .",
    "the homogeneous stability of einstein static models in @xmath2 gravity has also been investigated  @xcite .",
    "another theory leading to high - energy modifications of gr is loop quantum cosmology ( lqc )  @xcite , which is a canonical quantization of homogeneous cosmological spacetimes based on loop quantum gravity  @xcite .",
    "the gravitational phase - space variables are an su(2 ) valued connection and conjugate triad , and the elementary variables underlying the quantization are the holonomies of the connection and the fluxes of the triad .",
    "the quantum theory obtained from lqc turns out to be inequivalent to wheeler - de witt quantization ( the lqc polymer representation is different from the usual wheeler - de witt schrodinger representation ) .",
    "wheeler - de witt quantization does not resolve the cosmological singularity , but in lqc a generic resolution of such singularities has been obtained .",
    "initial quantizations of lqc lead to a regularization of the big bang singularity  @xcite resulting from the fact that the quantum einstein equation is non - singular as well as from modifications to the scalar field energy density and dynamics .",
    "the modifications to the scalar field dynamics were based on effects arising from quantum inverse scale factor operators .",
    "subsequently , the elucidation of the consequences of using holonomies as the basic variables has shown that gravity is modified  @xcite , i.e. , the structure of the friedman equation , rather than solely the energy density of the matter field .",
    "these gravitational modifications typically become important at lower energy scales than the modifications to the scalar field dynamics .",
    "mulryne et al .",
    "@xcite used the scalar - field modification approach to investigate the stability of the einstein static model to homogeneous perturbations .",
    "they found that the new lqc einstein static model is a centre fixed point in phase space , i.e. a neutrally stable point , for a massless scalar field with @xmath3 .",
    "this modification of stability behaviour has important consequences for the emergent universe scenario , since it ameliorates the fine - tuning that arises from the fact that the einstein static is an unstable saddle in gr .",
    "here we consider the same question , but using the lqc gravitational modifications , and neglecting the higher energy modifications to matter .",
    "we consider a perfect fluid with @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "we show that , for all @xmath6 , there is a new centre , i.e. a neutrally stable point representing an einstein static model , but only if the cosmological constant @xmath0 is above a critical scale , @xmath7",
    "the loop quantum effects that we investigate manifest themselves in the form of a modification to the classical friedmann equation . for the closed frw model ,",
    "the explicit form is given by @xcite @xmath8 where @xmath9 , and the critical lqc energy density is @xmath10 it is evident that the first term in parentheses is the classical right hand side of the friedmann equation , with the quantum modifications appearing in the second term .",
    "the classical gr limit is achieved in the limit as @xmath11 goes to infinity whence the second term approaches unity .",
    "the classical energy conservation equation continues to hold , @xmath12 note that @xmath13 imposes the limits @xmath14 the modified raychaudhuri equation follows from eqs .",

    "the solution space is a 2-dimensional surface in the three - dimensional @xmath18 space , defined by the friedman constraint  ( [ fe ] ) .",
    "the system admits two critical points , which are static solutions @xmath19 .",
    "the first critical point is the standard gr einstein static universe , while the second is a new lqc einstein static universe : @xmath20 the conditions under which these static solutions exist are summarized in table  [ tab1 ] , and follow from @xmath21 .",

    "the linearization theorem ( see e.g. @xcite ) tells us that a fixed point which is a centre for the linearized system is not necessarily a centre for the full nonlinear system .",
    "in addition , the linearization of equations ( [ ec ] ) , ( [ re ] ) and ( [ hubble ] ) always leads to a third vanishing eigenvalue , simply because the actual dynamics is two - dimensional because of the modified friedman equation ( [ fe ] ) .",

    "( the limits take into account the conditions in table  [ tab1 ] . ) again , for the latter point the linearized analysis is not sufficient and therefore we turn to a numerical analysis in the next section .    for the system eq .",
    "( [ gr ] ) , we find the gr static solution , and the eigenvalues of the linearized system are @xmath40 these are real with opposite signs for @xmath41 and @xmath6 , so that the fixed point is unstable ( of the saddle type ) . for @xmath42 and @xmath25 ,",

    "only the gr fixed point is present and it is unstable . the trajectories are again wrapped around the friedman surface . during a contracting phase",
    "they tend to a minimum of the scale factor and then , after a bounce , there is a phase of expansion .    , with @xmath52 . ]",
    "we can integrate eq .",
    "( [ ec ] ) for @xmath63 as a function of @xmath55 , and substitute the expression for @xmath64 into the modified friedman equation  ( [ fe ] ) . using the dimensionless variables",

    "this expression allows us to get a better understanding of the particular case depicted in figs .",
    "[ 3 ] and [ 4 ] , where both the fixed points are present , by finding the separatrix .",
    "the separatrix is a curve ( actually , a union of orbits ) which marks the boundary of regions where the dynamical behaviour of the system is different . in this case",
    "the separatrix is the junction of the stable and unstable manifold with the gr einstein static hyperbolic fixed point .",
    "first we solve eq .",
    "( [ nfe ] ) for @xmath67 , then we substitute numerical values for the parameters @xmath52 and @xmath68 ( using @xmath69 ) , and we also substitute @xmath70 and @xmath71 for the gr fixed point .",
    "this produces a numerical value for @xmath67 . through this procedure , the equation of the separatrix",
    "is implicitly given by eq .",
    "( [ nfe ] ) with fixed values of the parameters @xmath72 , @xmath73 and @xmath74 .",
    "more insight can be acquired via the plot of the separatrix projected onto the @xmath75-plane , as shown in fig .  [ 7 ] .",
    "the curves depicted are the separatrix , which wraps around the friedman surface , and some other trajectories which are first integrals obtained for different values of the integration constants .",

    "it represents the trajectories as seen from the bottom of the friedman surface . both the gr fixed point ( a box ) and the lq fixed point ( a circle ) exist .",
    "the two vertical lines are the edges of the friedman surface .",
    "the red curve represents the two branches of the separatrix . ]",
    "we have shown that lqc gravitational modifications to the friedman equation lead to a new high - energy critical point for the einstein static universe .",
    "this lqc einstein static model is an unstable saddle ( like the standard gr einstein static solution ) for sufficiently negative pressure and a sub - critical cosmological constant , i.e. , @xmath76 if @xmath73 is large enough and the cosmological constant is above the critical value , then the lqc einstein static model is a centre : @xmath77 this neutrally stable behaviour is in strong contrast to the gr case , where the einstein static model is unstable for all ( positive ) values of @xmath0 .",
    "modified stability of the einstein static model is also found for @xmath2 gravity  @xcite and for the lqc case with matter modifications , rather than gravitational modifications  @xcite .",
    "this illustrates the general point that high - energy modifications to gr , which typically strongly modify the big bang singularity , also modify the dynamical nature of the non - singular einstein static universe .",
    "our result means that the fine - tuning problem for the emergent universe scenario is qualitatively changed by lqc gravitational modifications . in gr ,",
    "the einstein static is an unstable saddle , so that severe fine - tuning is required if the einstein static is to be the initial state for a past - eternal inflationary cosmology . with lqc",
    "gravitational modifications , the initial state becomes a centre when eq .",
    "( [ cs ] ) holds , thus ameliorating the fine - tuning .",
    "the same point was made in mulryne et al .",
    "@xcite in the case of lqc matter modifications . in that case",
    "however , the analysis is restricted to a massless scalar field ( @xmath52 ) , and the centre exists for all @xmath0 .",
    "our analysis applies for all perfect fluids with @xmath5 , since we focus on the lqc gravitational modifications .",
    "these gravitational modifications operate typically at a lower energy scale than the matter modifications .",
    "clearly , from the standpoint of the emergent universe scenario , one needs a further mechanism to break the infinite cycles about the centre fixed point , leading to a subsequent inflationary phase as discussed in @xcite for a general class of braneworld models sourced by a scalar field with a constant potential .",
    "this mechanism will be the subject of future work .",
