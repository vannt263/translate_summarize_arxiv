    "critical bond percolation on @xmath3 is the most natural model of a random subgraph of the square lattice : each edge of the lattice is included with probability @xmath4 , independently of all other edges . despite the simplicity of its definition , it is difficult to analyze rigorously . though the spectacular recent results of smirnov @xcite and lawler - schramm - werner @xcite related to critical exponents , conformal invariance and the schramm - loewner evolution ( sle ) have resolved many of the outstanding open problems for the related model of critical site percolation on the triangular lattice , the same problems are still unsolved in the case of bond percolation on @xmath3 .    in this paper",
    "we will study another percolation model , which is related to critical bond percolation on @xmath3 and can be thought of as a variant of it .",
    "we will refer to the model as * loop percolation on @xmath3 * ; an equivalent model has been studied in the statistical physics literature under different names such as the * dense @xmath0 loop model * @xcite or * completely packed loops * @xcite .",
    "another closely related model is the special case of the * xxz spin chain * in which the so - called anisotropy parameter @xmath5 takes the value @xmath6 ; see @xcite .",
    "our motivation in studying this model was twofold : first , to point out , and attempt to systematically exploit , the inherent interest and approachability of the model from the point of view of probability theory  qualities which have not been emphasized in previous studies .",
    "second , to use and enhance some of the deep algebraic tools ( referred to under the broad heading of the * quantum knizhnik - zamolodchikov equation * ) that were developed in recent years to compute explicit formulas for several quantities of interest in the model . in this paper",
    "we focus on algebraic techniques .",
    "the follow - up paper @xcite will contain additional results of a more probabilistic flavor .",
    "let us start with the definition of the model .",
    "we define loop percolation in the entire plane , but later we will also consider the model on a half - plane and on a semi - infinite cylinder .",
    "consider the square lattice @xmath3 equipped with a checkerboard coloring of the squares of the dual lattice , such that the square whose bottom - left corner is @xmath7 is white . * loop percolation * is the random subgraph @xmath8 of @xmath3 obtained by tossing a fair coin for each white square in the dual lattice , independently of all other coins , and including in @xmath9 either the bottom and top edges of or the left and right edges of according to the result of the coin toss ( fig .",
