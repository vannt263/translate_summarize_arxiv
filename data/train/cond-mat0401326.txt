    "the dynamics of glassy systems is extremely slow , both near and far from equilibrium  @xcite . until recently , experiments , numerical studies and theory focused on the study of averaged global , or bulk , dynamical quantities that demonstrate the nonequilibrium character of the glassy state .",
    "interest is now shifting to the study of local quantities embodied in intermittent fluctuations and dynamic heterogeneities .",
    "the recent development of powerful experimental techniques  @xcite and the use of extensive numerical simulations have started to yield valuable information about the dynamics of supercooled liquids  @xcite and glassy systems  @xcite at a mesoscopic scale .",
    "a detailed analysis of temporal fluctuations in the evolution of global observables allows one to distinguish between intermittent and continuous dynamics , the former being associated with sudden , large rearrangements  @xcite .",
    "in addition , the study of run - to - run fluctuations in systems of mesoscopic size yields complementary information  @xcite . the insight obtained from these studies is useful in identifying the most relevant rearrangements that take place during evolution and thus may lead to a better understanding of the mechanism leading to glassy arrest .",
    "the behavior of global dynamic correlations in macroscopic glassy systems is rather well - described analytically with an extension of the mode - coupling theory to the low temperature regime  @xcite .",
    "this approach is also attractive since , via its connection to mean - field models with quenched disorder , it allows for an interpretation of dynamic arrest and slow dynamics in terms of the geometric properties of a free - energy landscape  @xcite .",
    "however , it is not clear how to describe temporal and spatial fluctuations within this approach .",
    "another picture of glassy dynamics is based on kinetically constrained models with trivial static interactions  @xcite and is successful in describing aging effects and other glassy features  @xcite as has been recently reviewed  @xcite .",
    "moreover , dynamic heterogeneities also find a natural interpretation within these models  @xcite .",
    "the connection between the microscopic interacting real system and the non - interacting kinetically constrained model is however phenomenological , as the facilitation rules are based on a coarse - grained description of the liquid dynamics .",
    "other phenomenological descriptions do not even have a real - space interpretation .",
    "thus , one of the more interesting and open theoretical problems at present is how to derive the observed properties of medium - size and large - scale fluctuations that are possibly associated with cooperative and correlated rearrangements of the microscopic constituents ( particles , spins , etc . ) from a microscopic model  @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we focus on particular aspects of the non - equilibrium dynamics near or below the onset of glassy arrest .",
    "some of our arguments and numerical analysis can be simplified to capture the ( stationary ) slow dynamics of supercooled liquids as a particular case .",
    "the purpose of this paper is three - fold .",
    "first , we test whether the scenario proposed in refs .",
    "@xcite for spatially heterogeneous glassy dynamics applies to models without quenched disorder such as kinetically constrained spin models .",
    "second , we show that several features of the probability distributions functions ( pdf s ) of fluctuating two - time correlations , namely time scalings and functional forms , are common to many glassy systems .",
    "third , we discuss an analytic approach developed to describe the scaling form and time evolution of these pdf s .",
    "this approach is based on the arguments put forward in @xcite and on an analogy with the study of the order - parameter fluctuations in critical phenomena  @xcite , where one can describe universality classes in terms of the pdf s of global fluctuations .",
    "the latter is similar in spirit to the work of rcz and collaborators on interfacial growth problems  @xcite , and bramwell and coworkers on the xy model  @xcite .",
    "even if , strictly speaking , there is no liquid - glass dynamic phase transition , glassy dynamics present some aspects of critical dynamics . among others ,",
    "a dynamic correlation length defined from the fluctuations of the local two - time correlations shows an apparent divergence at long times  @xcite . in the critical situation",
    ", one expects that the symmetries of the problem constrain the form and scaling of the pdf s of fluctuating dynamical quantities .",
    "a natural way to attempt an analytic approach to these fluctuations is then to construct an effective sigma model that respects these symmetries .",
    "this approach has been advocated in @xcite . here",
    "we extend it to propose a model that describes not only the time - scaling of the pdf s but also their functional form .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows . in section  [ sect2 ]",
    "we summarize the main properties of glassy dynamics as displayed by the decay of global correlation functions . in section  [ exps ]",
    "we present a short review of experiments that focus on the measurement of dynamic fluctuations . in section  [ models ]",
    "we introduce the models that we study numerically ; these are a modification of the fredrickson - andersen ( fa ) model due to graham _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite and the edwards - anderson ( ea ) spin - glass  @xcite . in section  [ fluctuations ]",
    "we present the pdf s for fluctuating two - time correlations .",
    "we demonstrate that very similar pdf s are obtained from facilitated ising models without quenched random interactions and the disordered spin - glass problem .",
    "these forms also resemble strongly the experimental data of cipelletti _ et al . _",
    "@xcite for colloidal suspensions .",
    "we describe these pdf s with an evolving gumbel - like form that we later argue can be justified from the sigma - model approach . in section  [ analytic ]",
    "we introduce the theoretical modeling of these two - time dependent pdf s .",
    "finally , in section  [ conclusions ] we present our conclusions .",
    "appendix  [ gumbel ] discusses the definition of a gumbel distribution and some of its properties .",
    "the aim of appendix  [ app : toy ] is to identify which features of the pdfs are trully due to glassy dynamics . to this end",
    "we analyse the stochastic dynamics ( with no facilitation rule ) of a finite system of independent spins on a lattice .",
    "glassy systems show slow nonexponential dynamical relaxation . this is demonstrated by the extremely sluggish decay of one - time observables like the energy density , the structure factor , etc . in many experimental cases ,",
    "one - time observables can be considered to be approximately constant within the time window explored .",
    "thus , observables that depend on only one time are not sufficient to characterize the non - equilibrium relaxation of a glassy system in its full richness ; they do not signal one of the hallmarks of glassy systems , namely aging phenomena .",
    "aging is partially described by the decay of two - time global correlation functions : @xmath0 with @xmath1 the global observable of interest and @xmath2 a two - time dependent normalization that enforces @xmath3 .",
    "the angular brackets denote an average over different thermal histories of the system . in a model with quenched disorder ,",
    "e.g. the ea spin - glass , one averages the global correlation over different realizations of the interactions .",
    "sometimes a coarse - graining in time using a short time window around the observation instant is also implemented .",
    "it is important to note that for a sufficiently large system , the quantity @xmath4 does not fluctuate and the result obtained for a single thermal history ( and a single realization of disorder ) coincides with the averaged one , as long as times are long , but not so long as to exhibit recovery of equilibrium behavior .",
    "as already mentioned , one - time observables evolve very slowly in the glassy phase of real systems . still , some models used to capture glassy dynamics have a faster evolution of one - time quantities . in these cases , it is convenient to study the evolution of the _ connected correlations _ defined as in eq .",
    "( [ global - corr ] ) where @xmath5    by the very definition of aging , older systems relax in a slower manner than younger ones .",
    "one defines the age of a system as the time spent in the phase under study .",
    "a way to characterize the aging properties is to monitor the time evolution of the two - time correlation defined in eq .",
    "( [ global - corr ] ) or the two - time function in eq .",
    "( [ global ] ) .",
    "well below @xmath6 ( conventionally defined as the value at which the relaxation time reaches 100s ) the system is in a `` phase '' that we call `` glassy '' . at such low temperatures the correlations depend explicitly on @xmath7 and ,",
    "within the experimentally accessible time - window , do not show a tendency towards decay to equilibrium behavior , that is to say an independence from @xmath7 .",
    "close to glassy arrest one observes `` interrupted aging , '' namely a dependence on the age of the system until observations reach the equilibration time ( @xmath8 ) where the dynamics crosses over to an equilibrium one .",
    "the correlations of eq .",
    "( [ global - corr ] ) have been studied experimentally in a number of glassy materials . in spin systems",
    "the natural choice for @xmath1 is the fluctuation of the global magnetization  @xcite , while in colloidal suspensions it is the intensity of scattered light  @xcite .",
    "many numerical studies of a large variety of models have focused on the analysis of the closely related intermediate scattering function . on the analytical side , the study of mean - field disordered models such as the @xmath9-spin model yielded several features of the aging behavior seen in simulations and experiments  @xcite .",
    "connected global correlations in several kinetically constrained spin systems have also been studied yielding similar results  @xcite .    in structural glasses , a pictorial explanation of aging",
    "may be put forward by imagining that each particle sees a cage made of its neighbors .",
    "when @xmath10 is short compared to a characteristic time @xmath11 , each particle rattles within its cage , decorrelation is characterized only by thermal fluctuations , and correlations decay in a stationary manner from unity at equal times to a plateau , @xmath12 , seen on a logarithmic scale .",
    "when @xmath10 increases , the motion of the particles destroys the cages and the structure of the system relaxes .",
    "the waiting - time dependence implies that the cages become stiffer as time evolves .",
    "the motion of a tagged particle observed with confocal microscopy demonstrated this scenario  @xcite . upon examination of the value of the displacement reached at the maximum separation time , however ,",
    "one notices that motion occurs only on length scales of the order of the radius of a particle .",
    "this means that the structural relaxation occurs without large scale structural rearrangement and with essentially no exchange of particles within the bulk of the sample .",
    "the same observation applies to the dynamics of granular matter under external forcing  @xcite .",
    "the existence of a well - defined cage translates into the appearance of a plateau in the decay of the two - time correlations .",
    "the presence of a plateau in the correlation function means that there is a macroscopic time interval in which the correlation ( when plotted in log - log scale ) can be approximated by a ( non - zero ) constant . in this case",
    "the two - time correlation can be scaled in a satisfactory way by using a separation in fast and slow regimes  @xcite : @xmath13 with @xmath14 and @xmath15 a characteristic time scale .",
    "the first term describes the stationary approach to the plateau , the second term the @xmath7-dependent departure from it .",
    "the light - scattering study of a colloidal system of viasnoff _ et al . _",
    "@xcite shows a very clear plateau separating the two regimes .",
    "however , a clear - cut plateau is not always visible in numerical simulations and experiments .    in most cases studied so far the second ( aging ) decay",
    "is characterized by a similar form @xmath16 with @xmath17 a system - dependent monotonic function .",
    "a typical and well - understood example in which the slow part of the decay is represented by this form is the case of systems undergoing domain growth . in this case , for long and well - separated times",
    ", @xmath17 is the typical size of the domains at time @xmath18 .",
    "other examples include the relaxation of the incoherent scattering function in lennard - jones mixtures and the result of light - scattering measurements in colloidal suspensions  @xcite .",
    "monte carlo data for the two - time spin - spin correlations in the @xmath19 ea model can be described with such a two - step relaxation and @xmath20  @xcite .",
    "similarly , the magnetization correlations in the insulating spin - glass studied by hrisson and ocio  @xcite are described by a two - step relaxation . in this study , an enhanced power law , @xmath21 ,",
    "yields the best fit of the experimental data .",
    "we shall see below that , for the times that one can reach with a numerical simulation , the kinetically constrained models defined in sect .",
    "[ models ] either do not show a plateau in their connected correlations , or show several plateaus . moreover , it is very difficult to identify a single function @xmath17 that describes the slow decay .",
    "this might be due to the fact that the slow decay involves several correlation scales that are still not well separated during numerical times .",
    "the existence of dynamic heterogeneities in supercooled liquids and glasses has been suggested on the basis of experiments performed using many techniques  @xcite ; two of them are the confocal microscopy and light scattering .",
    "we discuss these results in some detail since we shall compare our numerical simulations to them .",
    "confocal microscopy allows one to reconstruct the trajectory of each particle in a colloidal suspensions made of several thousand particles  @xcite .",
    "kegel and van blaaderen  @xcite found a non - gaussian distribution of particle displacements in a dense system of colloidal hard spheres and they associated this large distribution to the presence of dynamical heterogeneities .",
    "later , courtland and weeks found that mobile ( and immobile ) particles cluster in regions of lower ( higher ) density than average in the glassy phase of a colloidal system  @xcite .    the `` time - resolved light - scattering technique ''  @xcite has been developed with the aim of testing the fluctuations in time of the intensity - intensity correlations in samples of medium size .",
    "the existence of intermittency in measurements of _ global _ quantities may be another manifestation of heterogeneous dynamics .",
    "temporal fluctuations in colloidal suspensions have been studied in this way .",
    "interestingly enough , cipelletti s group showed that aging samples , such as concentrated colloidal gels , have an intermittent dynamics leading to negatively skewed distributions of the two - time intensity - intensity correlations when the time lag is shorter than the relaxation time and gaussian distributions when the time lag approaches the relaxation time .",
    "they also showed that simpler systems with no glassy features , such as brownian colloidal samples , have a continuous relaxation with a gaussian distribution of the same quantities for all time lags explored .",
    "the same trend of time resolved pdf s of particle displacements was demonstrated by courtland and weeks using confocal microscopy  @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to note that these experiments show that significant fluctuations occur even if the time lag @xmath10 is very short compared to @xmath7 .",
    "evidence for intermittency in the _ global _ voltage signal noise in a solid - like colloidal glass and a polymer glass has also been presented recently  @xcite . while the samples are out of equilibrium the voltage time series has bursts with very large amplitudes .",
    "these bursts become rarer with the sample age in the sense that their amplitude decreases and the time elapsed between two consecutive bursts increases . when aging stops the bursts disappear from the noise signal .",
    "the waiting - time dependent pdf , @xmath22 , constructed by dividing time in intervals of duration @xmath10 is clearly negatively skewed at short times and progressively approaches a gaussian distribution when the age of the system increases  @xcite .    on the numerical side ,",
    "most studies have focused on the supercooled liquid phase of binary mixtures  @xcite and polymer melts  @xcite and the heterogeneities have been studied by tagging each particle and classifying them according to their mobility during a selected time interval .",
    "some recent papers treat the glassy phase of the lennard - jones system in a similar way  @xcite . following the dynamics of individual particles",
    "is very useful to get an intuitive understanding of the evolution of the system , but it is hard to use as a direct input in a theoretical approach . in order to develop such a description , it is much more convenient to use the coarse - grained two - time quantities  @xcite that we shall define in sect .",
    "[ fluctuations ] . in this",
    "setting , a heterogeneity is a region in the sample that relaxes very differently from the bulk . clearly , the heterogeneities are not static and they appear and disappear as dynamic fluctuations .",
    "we shall focus on several spin models that describe and capture different aspects of glassy systems .",
    "we define them below .",
    "the first model we study is a kinetically constrained spin system with trivial equilibrium properties .",
    "it is a simple variation of the fredrickson - andersen ( fa ) model  @xcite due to graham _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite . @xmath23 ising spins , @xmath24 , @xmath25 , occupy the vertices of a regular cubic lattice in @xmath26 dimensions .",
    "the energy is given by @xmath27 thus there are no static interactions between the spins but an external field of strength @xmath28 is applied .",
    "the system is in contact with a heat bath at temperature @xmath29 that , for convenience , we shall measure in units of the external field @xmath28 .",
    "this model does not have a static transition and at equilibrium the averaged magnetization , @xmath30 , is given by @xmath31 the non - trivial evolution of this non - interacting system arises due to the constrained dynamics imposed on the spins . at each time",
    "step a spin , @xmath32 , that is chosen at random among the ensemble is allowed to flip with a generalized heat bath rule . if at least @xmath9 of its @xmath33 neighbors point down , _",
    "i.e. _ opposite to the preferred direction , the move is accepted with unit probability if @xmath34 and with probability @xmath35 if @xmath36 .",
    "@xmath37 , with @xmath38 the total energy after the move and @xmath39 the total energy before the move . in this case ,",
    "otherwise the attempted flip is rejected .",
    "the parameter @xmath9 defines the facilitated rule .",
    "for instance , a three - site rule requires a minimum of @xmath41 neighbors to oppose the field direction . as usual ,",
    "time units are defined via the number of attempts to flip randomly chosen spins in the sample .",
    "the facilitation rule satisfies detailed balance .",
    "thus the system evolves towards the equilibrium configuration , although it may do so in a very slow manner .",
    "the larger the value of @xmath9 the slower the resulting dynamics .",
    "typically , one is interested in following the relaxational dynamics of a random initial condition in which each spin points in the up or down direction with probability one half .",
    "this mimics a rapid quench from infinite temperature to the working temperature @xmath29 .",
    "the dynamics tend to order the system in the up direction .",
    "however , as time passes , it is harder to choose a spin with sufficient number of neighbors pointing down .",
    "this induces a dynamic slowing down , and below @xmath42 ( in @xmath43 and using @xmath44 ) or @xmath45 ( in @xmath46 and using @xmath47 ) the system does not manage to get close to the equilibrium configuration .",
    "the out - of - equilibrium relaxation below this crossover temperature resembles that of supercooled liquids  @xcite .",
    "importantly , these models do not contain quenched disorder .",
    "the absence of quenched disorder and the local , non - mean - field nature of the relaxation strongly suggests that such models are relevant for understanding dynamics of supercooled liquids .",
    "the existence or absence of a genuine glass transition is not important for our purposes . indeed , as it has been recently shown rigorously is some cases these models do not have a dynamic phase transition in the thermodynamic limit  @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , the evolution of a large finite system at long but finite times shares some keynote properties with many glassy systems , including systems that have a finite temperature dynamic transition , such as spin - glass models that undergo one - step replica symmetry breaking .",
    "thus , the study of facilitated models in the context presented here is of even broader importance than just the modeling of supercooled liquids .",
    "a disordered model that we shall briefly discuss here is the standard non - mean - field model for spin - glasses , the finite dimensional edwards - anderson model  @xcite .",
    "the energy function is highly non - trivial in this case , @xmath48 where the spins are ising variables that occupy the vertices of a cubic @xmath26-dimensional lattice , the sum runs over nearest - neighbors , and the coupling strengths are random and chosen from a bimodal or gaussian probability distribution with zero mean and variance @xmath49=1/(2z)$ ] .",
    "the square brackets denote an average over the random exchanges .",
    "this model is said to be _ disordered _ due to the quenched randomness introduced via the exchanges .",
    "the static properties are still under debate .",
    "it is believed that in @xmath19 the edwards - anderson model undergoes a static phase transition from a paramagnetic to a spin - glass phase at a finite value of @xmath29 , which depends on the type of disorder used , but there is no consensus about the nature and properties of the static spin - glass phase  @xcite .",
    "dynamically , one may also follow the evolution of spin configurations from a random initial condition .",
    "the dynamics is , in this case , usual monte carlo with the heat bath rule determined by the energy function ( [ ea - energy ] ) .",
    "the evolution of a sufficiently large system at low temperatures occurs out of equilibrium .",
    "the local mesoscopic fluctuations of this model have been studied analytically and numerically in  @xcite .",
    "we shall not reproduce these results here . in this manuscript",
    "we merely augment the results presented in  @xcite to test the properties of fluctuations that have not been discussed in previous publications .",
    "in this section we introduce the quantities we shall focus on and we discuss the behavior of their pdf s as found for the kinetically constrained models and the @xmath19 ea spin - glass .",
    "local fluctuations in an unperturbed system are monitored by studying @xmath50 where @xmath51 is a coarse - graining volume centered at the position @xmath52 .",
    "this is a local connected function that evolves from a time - dependent value at equal times to zero at diverging time separations .",
    "since it is convenient to work with a normalized two - time quantity at equal times , we define @xmath53 with this definition the normalization itself is site - dependent and might introduce spurious fluctuations .",
    "another possibility is to normalize the local correlation with the global connected one @xmath54 this normalization bounds the global correlation to be less than unity but it does not bound the local one ; in particular , it does not enforce the local correlation to be one at equal times . in",
    "what follows , we present results obtained using definition [ local - corr2 ] only . for lattice spin models ,",
    "the choice is @xmath55 and its normalized counterpart . for the ea model one",
    "easily verifies that , when the coarse - graining volume is sufficiently large , the local magnetization vanishes , @xmath56 , and there is no need to use the connected functions above . for the modified fa model ,",
    "the local magnetization does not vanish and we shall work with connected functions . in none of these expressions",
    "is there any averaging , apart from the coarse - graining in space .",
    "with the local observables one can define a two - time dependent correlation length @xmath57 via  @xcite @xmath58 and the normalized quantity @xmath59 ( we have made explicit the vectorial character of the positions @xmath60 in @xmath61 . in the case of spin problems it is convenient to use @xmath62 where the overline indicates a coarse - graining in time over a time - window centered on @xmath18 . )    depending on the relative value between the linear size of the coarse - graining volume , @xmath63 , and the two - time dependent correlation length , @xmath64 , we expect either :    _ i. _ if @xmath63 is not much larger than @xmath57 different cells in the system behave rather differently and the histogram of the quantities ( [ local - corr0 ] ) leads to a non - trivial pdf whose form depends on the two times chosen , @xmath7 and @xmath18 .",
    "if @xmath65 the coarse - graining averages over many independent cells and the pdf approaches a gaussian form that , in the limit @xmath66 , has a vanishing variance and its average is given by the global value of the correlation .    as a consequence one expects to find similar fluctuations by taking a system with finite size and examining the behavior of the run - to - run fluctuations of the global two - time quantity ( [ global ] ) .",
    "indeed , if @xmath67 one falls in case _",
    "ii_. instead , if @xmath68 is of the order of @xmath64 , case _ i _ is found and the `` mesoscopic fluctuations '' should be non - trivial .",
    "this argument justifies the comparison of our approach to the ones in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "in this section we present the analysis of the dynamics of the kinetically facilitated model in @xmath43 choosing @xmath44 and then in @xmath46 for @xmath47 .",
    "all the @xmath19 numerical data have been obtained using a cubic lattice of linear size @xmath69 lattice spacings at temperature @xmath70 and the @xmath71 data using a square lattice with @xmath72 at temperature @xmath73 .",
    "coarse - grained data have been obtained using a cubic coarse - graining volume of linear size @xmath74 lattice spacings for @xmath43 and a square volume with @xmath75 for @xmath46 . for @xmath43 , given the very large size of the system we used only one run ( there is no statistic average ) .",
    "let us first discuss the main qualitative features of the evolution of the spin configuration before entering the quantitative analysis of the time - dependent observables .",
    "initial configurations are random , in that each spin points up or down with probability one half , which mimics an infinitely rapid quench from @xmath76 . initially ,",
    "approximately @xmath77 for @xmath43 ( @xmath78 for @xmath46 ) sites satisfy the facilitation constraint and are able to flip with the heat bath probability weight . at the early stages of the evolution",
    "it remains relatively easy to find spins that satisfy the facilitation constraint .",
    "as time evolves the number of positive spins , and hence the magnetization , increases .",
    "however , as time passes one expects to have isolated spins and small islands of spins that point downwards .",
    "these may be remnants of the initial configuration or they may be due to `` equilibrium - like '' thermal fluctuations .",
    "the former are blocked until other down - pointing spins diffuse .",
    "the interior of the latter can flip but their border might be blocked due to the facilitated rule .",
    "a crossover ( in the total time ) between the `` easy '' initial regime and the `` hard '' latter regime was predicted in  @xcite .",
    "the analysis of the evolution for @xmath43 towards its equilibrium value gives a first indication of the apparent `` glass transition '' temperature .",
    "figure  [ fig : magn ] shows the time dependence of the magnetization density at @xmath70 on a log - linear scale .",
    "we see the above mentioned crossover occurring at @xmath79 .",
    "the value of the magnetization at the longest time reached in the simulation , @xmath80 mcs , is still 10@xmath81 away from the equilibrium value , @xmath82 , showing that the system is still far from equilibrium . assuming that the curve found for this range of times",
    "does indeed approach the equilibrium value and no further crossover to a different dynamic law occurs ( a hypothesis that might not hold , see  @xcite for a more detailed analysis ) we find that the second slower regime is well - characterized by the law @xmath83 demonstrating very slow dynamics even in the behavior of this one - time quantity . at higher temperatures",
    "one finds that the maximum magnetization reached in the numerical time window gets closer to the equilibrium value and , for example at @xmath45 it actually reaches this value in @xmath84 time steps  @xcite .",
    "this value is considerably lower than the putative glass transition identified by graham _",
    "et al . _",
    "these authors might have overestimated this temperature by simulating very small systems ( of maximum size @xmath85 ) as compared to the ones we use ( @xmath86 ) .",
    "[ fig : corr ]    what can we say about the structure of the remaining negative spins in the sample at long times ?",
    "a set of snapshots of the instantaneous configuration shows that at around the crossover time there are no finite size domains left but only isolated spins pointing downward or , at most , very short strings of negative spins .",
    "it is then clear that their annihilation needs the cooperative diffusion of other spins in their neighbourhood , which is a very slow process indeed .    the aging curves for the global connected and normalized correlation function defined in eq .",
    "( [ local - corr ] ) are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : c_t04 ] for several values of @xmath7 and as a function of @xmath87 in log - linear scale . as discussed in sect .",
    "[ sect2 ] , disconnected correlation functions in glassy models usually show a two - step relaxation with a first rapid decay towards a plateau , that one estimates to be at @xmath88 for a model undergoing simple domain growth , and a second slower aging decay towards zero .",
    "connected correlation functions do not necessarily show a plateau .",
    "this is the case in domain growth .",
    "for the times explored numerically in the spin - facilitated model we do not see the development of the plateau ( which is not even seen on a log - log scale ) .",
    "this might be due to the fact that the system is still very far from an asymptotic dynamic regime or it may simply mean that the connected correlation does not have a fast regime  @xcite .    we have attempted to scale the correlation data for all time differences and waiting times that are equal or longer than @xmath89 time steps ( note that the curves for the two shorter waiting times are clearly different from the rest ) .",
    "we found that the scaling @xmath90 describes the data quite precisely for intermediate waiting times ( @xmath91@xmath92 time steps ) , but fails to collapse the data for longer waiting times , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : c_t04_scaling ] .",
    "interestingly , this scaling form is a precursor of dynamic ultrametricity  @xcite .",
    "we have searched for other simple scaling forms without finding any that describe the full data in a satisfactory way .",
    "for this reason , we shall use the value of the global correlation itself to scale the pdf s of the local fluctuations .",
    "the same difficulty arises in the other kinetically constrained models that we have studied .",
    "henceforth we omit the subindex @xmath93 that indicates the slow regime , since the kinetic facilitated models we have analyzed do not seem to have a first fast regime in their connected correlations .",
    "let us now turn to the study of the fluctuations of the local correlation functions , @xmath94 , as defined in eq .",
    "( [ local - corr0 ] ) and normalized to unity at equal times .",
    "what we clearly observe is that , even in this preasymptotic regime ( in the sense that the magnetization , a one - time quantity , is far from its asymptotic value ) , the scaling of the pdf of local correlations is the same as the scaling of the global function .",
    "moreover , the qualitative behavior of the form of the pdf s , their skewness and other momenta , are similar to the ones that cipelletti _ et al . _ found experimentally  @xcite .",

    "this means that when the ratio for a chosen value of @xmath233 varies as , @xmath234 all others are constant : @xmath235 the boundary conditions are such that @xmath236 with @xmath237 , and @xmath238 . in the time regime",
    "in which the @xmath233-th ratio varies the global correlation reads @xmath239 motivated by what was presented in  @xcite we propose that the local fluctuations can be parametrized as @xmath240 we assume that the local fluctuations are small in the sense that they do not exchange scales .",
    "this is consistent with the supposition that the edwards - anderson parameter , or more generally in this case the plateau values @xmath241 , are not modified by the fluctuations .",
    "based on the symmetry arguments already explained , we propose that each @xmath242 is distributed as in ( [ s - effective ] ) .",
    "this leads , after the reparametrization of time , to @xmath243 and the change of variables @xmath244 , to a gaussian distribution for each @xmath245 , @xmath246 note that the @xmath247 are positive and we assumed that the stiffness @xmath220 is @xmath233 independent , for simplicity .",
    "this is simply due to the fact that the @xmath230 characterizing each two - times sector are monotonically growing functions of time .",
    "thus , when we look at the connected correlations between the @xmath248 , for given values of @xmath18 and @xmath7 that correspond to the scale @xmath233 for the global correlation , only the @xmath233-th scale makes a non - trivial ( non - constant)contribution . since in each two - time sector",
    "the global scaling of the pdf of local correlations is the same as the one for the global @xmath103 , we find that this result holds for all times .",
    "once we have analyzed the case of @xmath203 scales , we can take the limit @xmath249 that corresponds to the ultrametric scaling form and claim that in this case the pdf s scale as the global ones .",
    "thus , we expect the collapse of the type found for the facilitated models .      in this section",
    "we numerically generate random surfaces with the statistics given by ( [ nonlinear - collapse ] ) and we calculate the pdf s of local correlations related to the surfaces using eq .",

    "we proceed as follows :    1 .",
    "we generate independent gaussian random surfaces @xmath251 , which we choose to be of unit variance since the choice of variance does not change the results qualitatively .",
    "these surfaces are generated with the distribution @xmath252\\propto { \\rm e}^{- k \\int d^dr   ( \\nabla \\dot\\psi_r)^2}$ ] ( see eq .",
    "( [ s - effective - psi ] ) ) .",
    "we then sum the @xmath253 over @xmath203 time slices .",
    "the number of slices determines the time difference @xmath87 .",
    "next we generate the surfaces @xmath254 , _",
    "i.e. _ we choose for simplicity the `` external '' function @xmath255 [ see eq .",
    "( [ global - c ] ) ] .",
    "4 .   finally , we look at the pdf s @xmath217 of the normalized coarse - grained local correlations @xmath210 ( subtracting the average , scaling by the standard deviation , and coarse - graining over a box of volume @xmath256 ) as a function of the number of slices @xmath203 .    before presenting the numerical results ,",
    "let us discuss in more detail the issue of coarse - graining the correlation @xmath210 over a certain volume .",
    "there are actually two levels of coarse - graining for theories defined on a lattice .",
    "first , in order to define continuous fields @xmath257 , and ultimately @xmath258 , a coarse - graining of a lattice theory has already occurred .",
    "coarse - graining the local correlation @xmath210 over a given volume is a _ second _ level of coarse - graining .",
    "the connection to the xy model and the fluctuations of the global magnetization studied by bramwell _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite is helpful in clarifying this point .",
    "starting from a lattice theory , one coarse - grains to obtain a landau - type theory of a continuous variable @xmath219 .",
    "then , to study the fluctuations of the total magnetization of the system over a given volume , one must average @xmath219 over a second coarse - graining volume ( which in the case of the global magnetization is the entire volume of the system ) . in the numerical simulations we present here , we start from an action for the @xmath259 that is gaussian .",
    "the first level of coarse - graining that led to an action for a continuous @xmath163 or @xmath259 was assumed to have taken place already .",
    "so even though in the numerical calculations we employ a discretization , one should keep in mind that a first coarse - graining has been invoked .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : randsurface - gumbelm1 ] , we show for a system of size @xmath260 the dependence of the @xmath217 on the number of slices .",
    "we show curves for @xmath261 , and for a coarse - grained volume @xmath262 .",
    "the smaller the value of @xmath203 , the smaller is the ratio @xmath181 .",
    "several comments are in order .",
    "first , notice that for small @xmath203 , the curves clearly deviate from a gaussian form and are reasonably well fit by a generalized gumbel distribution ( see app .",
    "the curves become more gaussian as @xmath203 increases .",
    "this behavior is qualitatively similar to the one we obtained for the facilitated spin model and the @xmath19 ea model we studied numerically in sect .",
    "[ fluctuations ] as well as the experimental observations of cipelletti _ et al . _",
    "the approach to a gaussian behavior is however very slow and we do not reach the gaussian form with the values of @xmath203 used .      why do the analytical arguments we presented above , based on a symmetry ( reparametrization invariance ) , lead to the universal behavior and collapse ( for a fixed global correlation ) of the @xmath217 that is observed in the facilitated spin models , in the @xmath19 edwards - anderson model , and in some experiments  @xcite ?",
    "we can single out two essential elements of the theoretical description that allow it to account for this behavior .",
    "the first ingredient is that the theory proposed in refs .",
    "@xcite contains a massless goldstone mode associated with the _ spatial _ fluctuations in the asymptotic long - time ( and long - time - difference ) limit .",
    "this means that correlation functions such as those in eq .",
    "( [ n - corr ] ) are described by algebraically decaying functions @xmath263 .",
    "the absence of a correlation length @xmath64 leads to the non - gaussian behavior for quantities averaged over a finite volume , similarly to the studies in refs .",
    "of course , one expects that universal behavior of the pdf s will occur only after coarse - graining .",
    "note however that it is the absence of a correlation scale that implies that the law of large numbers will not take effect as the box size increases .",
    "so the theory based on reparametrization invariance of the action gives rise to a non - gaussian distribution for coarse - grained @xmath176 ( in addition to any coarse - graining needed to define a theory in the space continuum ) because of the algebraic correlations originating from the massless goldstone mode . in the theory of refs .",
    "@xcite we argued that the correlation scale @xmath264 in the asymptotic long - time limit .",
    "however , for finite times there is a finite @xmath64  @xcite .",
    "coarse - graining much beyond this length scale leads to gaussian distributions .",
    "the second element that the analytical theory contains is that all dependencies on the times are functions of @xmath193 .",
    "this leads to the collapse of distributions ( not only their bulk averages ) as a function of @xmath265 .",
    "in addition , the fact that the different @xmath201 slice contributions @xmath266 are uncorrelated , and that they enter in the local correlations @xmath176 through the sum over all slices , is the reason why the skewness of the distributions depend on @xmath203 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : randsurface - gumbelm1 ] .",
    "again , this is in good accord with the experimental observations of ref .",
    "@xcite and with the numerical results for the models that we study in this paper .    in summary",
    ", we believe that the qualitative features shared by the pdf s of local correlators in the facilitated models , in the @xmath19 ea model , and in the experimental observations of cipelletti _ et al . _",
    "@xcite can be understood as a consequence of certain spatial and temporal correlations of the @xmath176 , which are contained in the theory based on reparametrization invariance .",
    "in equilibrium and away from criticality any global observable of a macroscopic system has gaussian fluctuations . at criticality , instead , one observes non - gaussian fluctuations due to the divergence of the correlation length and the non applicability of the central limit theorem .",
    "still , scale invariance at the critical point constrains the possible probability distributions ; these are determined by the universality class to which the systems belong . a similar criterion to classify the probability distributions of the fluctuations of macroscopic observables in critical nonequilibrium systems",
    "is based on the use of symmetries .",
    "it has been proposed in  @xcite .",
    "the glass transition , where the system falls out of equilibrium , is a dynamic crossover and neither a dynamic nor a thermodynamic transition .",
    "however , many features of glassy dynamics resemble critical relaxation such as the fact that correlations do not decay exponentially , but with much slower decay forms .",
    "one could expect then that some concepts that have been useful to study critical phenomena could also apply to the glassy dynamics  @xcite .",
    "in this paper we continued the study of local fluctuations in the dynamics of glassy systems . on the theoretical side we improved the sigma model , or random manifold action , proposed in  @xcite to capture not only the scaling in time of the pdf s but also their functional form . on the numerical side",
    ", we showed that part of the predictions of the theory tested in  @xcite using the @xmath19 edwards - anderson model also hold for a non - disordered kinetically constrained spin model of a glass .",
    "this confirms that the existence of quenched disorder is not important in this respect and that kinetic frustration and energetic frustration lead to very similar non - equilibrium dynamics .",
    "moreover , we tested the evolution of the form of the pdf s for these two models and verified that they behave in a way that resembles strongly the experimental observations in  @xcite",
    ".    one could expect that a more detailed and extended analysis of the local dynamics of glassy systems might lead to better differentiation between models and systems .",
    "for instance , one could find that the simple action ( [ nonlinear - collapse ] ) is not enough to reproduce the special form of pdf s found in a system and hence be forced to include other terms that we here neglected .",

    "@xmath122 one recovers the distribution studied by bramwell , holdsworth and pinton  @xcite .",
    "finally , let us study two limits of the generalized gumbel - like distribution ( [ gumbel - dist ] ) .",
    "a gaussian distribution of unit variance is obtained by taking the @xmath281 limit of @xmath282 while holding the product @xmath283 fixed :    @xmath284    where in the last step we used stirling s formula to get the normalization factor .",
    "another interesting limit is when @xmath285 while holding @xmath286 :    @xmath287    where we used that @xmath288 .",
    "thus , the @xmath285 limit leads to exponential distributions either starting or ending at @xmath289 .",
    "[ app : toy ]    the probability distribution of local correlation functions evaluated at finite times and coarse - grained over a sufficiently large cells is , to a first approximation , normally distributed around the bulk value .",
    "however , for the times and cell sizes considered in this paper , one needs to consider how the intrinsic distribution of unconstrained spins contributes to the skewing of the distribution of local correlations . in this appendix",
    ", we consider the degree of intrinsic skewing that arises from uncorrelated dynamics on a lattice .",
    "to differentiate between correlated and intrinsic skewness , we look at a model of paramagnetism without any facilitation .",
    "the hamiltonian is then the same as in the fa model .",
    "this toy model has no dependence on the dimensionality or the neighboring environment , and depends only on the number of spins included in the cells .",
    "therefore , all sites are independent and the probability @xmath9 that an initially up spin is down at time @xmath18 is the same everywhere ( @xmath290 is the equivalent probability for the spins initially down ) . using metropolis monte carlo single spin flips , one finds the following distribution for a cell of @xmath23 spins using binomial distribution arguments ,      here @xmath203 is the number of spins up initially up , @xmath292 is the initial bulk concentration of up spins , @xmath26 the number of initially up spins that are down at time @xmath18 , and @xmath293 of initially down spins which are up at time @xmath18 . in the equilibrium case , @xmath9 and @xmath290",
    "are related by @xmath294 the same relationship ( without the subscripts ) holds for a constant concentration system , but not in the case of a steadily decreasing concentration , as in the quenched facilitated models . that however can be resolved by including a scaling factor @xmath295 proportional to the concentration during the quench as a function of @xmath7 and @xmath18 .    for a given ensemble average value @xmath103 of the single site correlation ,",
    "one can obtain the pdf for the correlation averaged over a number @xmath51 of uncorrelated spins .",
    "( notice that , since these are free spins without any dynamical constraint , the number of time steps necessary to reach the average value @xmath103 is much smaller than that for the kinetically constrained models . ) using the result in ( [ eq : statweigh ] ) , one can obtain the corresponding value of the cell connected correlation function @xmath296 where @xmath297 , @xmath298 , and @xmath299 .",
    "the overline refers to the sub - ensemble average .    using bulk values for the different parameters ,",
    "the statistical component of the distribution of the local spin correlation can be obtained , by numerically evaluating eq .",
    "( [ eq : toycorrel ] ) for all @xmath203 , @xmath293 , and @xmath26 and properly weighting them according to eq .",
    "( [ eq : statweigh ] ) .",
    "tables  [ tab : param1 ] , [ tab : param2 ] , and [ tab : param3 ] show the parameters used in the different models . in the case of the plaquette models ,",
    "the same discussion applies , but with a null magnetic field instead .",
    ".unconstrained parameters for a decay of the global correlations to a value of @xmath300 of the initial value for the fa-@xmath301 model for a quenching @xmath73 and a box size of @xmath302 .",
    "the parameters are the @xmath7 defect concentration @xmath292 , the concentration scaling factor @xmath295 for time @xmath18 , and the probability @xmath9 of defect disappearance at time @xmath18 .",

    "no interesting effect is observed in these cases . in the last example",
    "considered ( table  [ tab : param3 ] ) the bulk correlation is chosen to take a smaller value and the parameters found indicate that the distribution is skewed .",
    "however , if one compares to the results obtained for the same model with facilitation one concludes that the non - gaussian effect is here much weaker and tends to disappear rather quickly when the times involved get long .    in summary , the simple correlations that follow from coarse - graining of some binomially distributed single - site spin - spin correlation whose average is restricted to be @xmath103 can not account for the pdfs we find for the kinetically constrained model .",
