    "[ [ section ] ]    ir blocking filters are critical for optimizing bolometer - based receivers in the millimeter and submillimeter spectral region . in these bands ,",
    "the ir power emitted from the telescope and surroundings ( typically 250 - 300 k for ground and balloon - based instruments ) is much brighter than the sky background .",
    "it is therefore crucial to control this out - of - band power .",
    "filters serve to substantially reduce what would be a dominant source of noise and minimize the radiative loading on the cryogenic system .",
    "in addition , the filters must not significantly radiate , reflect , or scatter in the band of interest .",
    "this requires high thermal conductivity and good heat sinking for any filter containing absorptive components .",
    "[ [ section-1 ] ]    meeting all these requirements in one system is difficult . a variety of approaches have been used previously .",
    "reflective frequency selective surfaces ( e.g. , patterned onto thin plastic substrates and stacked , as pioneered by ulrich @xcite , and summarized by ade @xcite ) , bulk filters of absorptive materials @xcite , and scattering filters @xcite are commonly employed . these filtering approaches ,",
    "however , are not without their complications .",
    "the reflective filters patterned on plastic substrates are subject to the intrinsic limits of multi - layered reflectors@xcite as well as heating due to absorption of the plastic . in practice ,",
    "additional reflective layers improve the filter rejection only incrementally and absorption leads to reradiated power that falls onto detectors@xcite .",
    "absorptive filters , such as those made of bulk alumina , present difficulties with antireflection coatings , requiring the use of lossy materials that reduce the overall transmission in the desired pass - band by 5% or more @xcite .",
    "additionally , alumina has reststrahlen bands that open up upon cooling , diminishing its overall filtering performance @xcite . in this work we present an example of a hybrid approach based on a combination of reflective frequency selective structures patterned on silicon substrates , scattering and absorptive layers based on composites of powdered crystals exhibiting the reststrahlen effect , and metamaterial antireflection coatings to control the in - band reflections .",
    "we present a particular example of the construction and performance of a blocking filter designed to pass the 70 - 170 ghz band in section [ sec : filterconstruction ] , and discuss its performance in section [ sec : filterperformance ] .",
    "we conclude with a discussion of the scalability and applicability of this design in section [ sec : applications ] .",
    "figure [ filter - schematic ] shows the anatomy of the composite absorptive / reflective ir - blocking filter .",
    "this filter consists of lithographically defined frequency selective surfaces patterned on two silicon wafers , a 25 @xmath0 layer of an absorptive mixture of epoxy and reststrahlen powders placed between the two patterned surfaces , and a metamaterial antireflection coating on both vacuum silicon interfaces . at ir wavelengths",
    ", light is scattered and reflected off the front silicon wafer and frequency selective surface .",
    "the front metamaterial surface scatters light both specularly and diffusely for frequencies above the single - moded limit of the structure . for the metamaterial surfaces",
    "described here ( tuned to pass 1 - 2 mm wavelengths ) , this frequency falls well below the infrared emission from a 300 k blackbody , which peaks at 10 @xmath0 ( 30 thz ) .",
    "infrared light that passes the frequency selective metal mesh is subject to both scattering and absorption by the reststrahlen - epoxy composite .",
    "an additional metal mesh layer reflects most of the remaining infrared light back into the epoxy - powder layer , boosting absorption and ( to a lesser extent ) reflection .",
    "this approach reduces the load on the cryogenic stage by reflecting a significant portion of the ir power , and uses an absorbing layer to further attenuate ir power passing the first reflective layer .    at millimeter and submillimeter wavelengths the metal mesh frequency selective surfaces and metamaterial silicon have a high transmission , and the extinction length of the epoxy mixture is inconsequential , leading to low absorption .",
    "thus in the bands of interest , this structure behaves nearly as if it were a slab of solid low loss silicon treated with a high quality antireflection coating @xcite .    in the remainder of this section",
    "we describe the design and performance of the frequency selective surfaces , powder - epoxy mixes , metamaterial antireflection coatings , and conclude with predictions for the integrated performance of our filters .",
    "the first filtering component of these composite ir - blocking filters is a low - pass frequency selective surface formed by a mesh of resonant metal squares .",
    "these squares act as a grid of capacitive elements and pass low frequencies while reflecting high frequencies . in the low frequency limit ,",
    "the metallization layer is effectively nonexistent giving nearly unity transmission , and in the high frequency limit , these features reflect according to the fill factor of the metallization . in the resonant region between , there is some additional reflection , with the cutoff frequency set by the grid spacing .",
    "we selected the grid parameters to place the cutoff frequency well above the upper end of our desired signal band ( 170 ghz ) , but below the peak emission frequency of a 300 k blackbody ( 18 thz ) .",
    "we selected a grid period of 23.8 @xmath0 and street widths of 5 @xmath0 , for a cutoff frequency in silicon of @xmath13.6 thz ( corresponding to a freespace wavenumber of 120 @xmath2 @xcite , clearly visible as the first resonance in the measurement in figure [ mesh - picture ] ) .",
    "these dimensions were additionally constrained to be within the capabilities of large - diameter liftoff lithographic techniques ( limiting us to minimum features of few micron scales ) .",
    "a prototype of this design was thoroughly characterized ( see figure [ mesh - picture ] ) , and the performance is in good agreement with our theoretical expectations , with a total reflectivity of 83% for a 300 k blackbody .",
    "these features are straightforward to tune to a desired cutoff frequency and can be fabricated on the silicon using standard lithographic techniques .",
    "design of these features was carried out via the analytical techniques described by ulrich @xcite , with additional optimization and verification via modeling in ansys hfss @xcite .",
    "[ [ section-2 ] ]    the reststrahlen effect , from the german for  residual rays , \" is the absorption of light at characteristic frequencies @xcite of the bound ion pairs in crystalline materials that falls in the infrared @xcite .",
    "these structural resonances prevent light in the reststrahlen band from propagating through the material , and effective low - pass filters have been previously demonstrated using powdered reststrahlen materials @xcite .",
    "transmissive and reflective filters have also been realized from bulk reststrahlen crystals @xcite .",
    "[ [ section-3 ] ]    powder filters , formed by reststrahlen powders mixed into a polyethylene carrier , were demonstrated as ir blocking filters by yamada et al .",
    "@xcite these filters , due to their plastic carrier , suffered from heating and reradiation .",
    "we fabricated similar powder filters by mixing reststrahlen powders into a mixture of toluene thinned epotek 301 optical epoxy and applying thin layers with a commercial spraygun mounted on a robotic gantry .",
    "this allowed for the creation of thin (  25 @xmath0 ) uniform layers of the epoxy - powder composite .",
    "the powders were chosen from the assortment of materials characterized by yamada @xcite to provide good blocking coverage for wavelengths from < 10 @xmath0 up to 150 @xmath0 ( corresponding to 67 - 1000 + @xmath2 , 2 - 30 + thz ) , overlapping transmissive regions of one powder with absorptive regions of another .",
    "additionally , the powders were chosen for ease of use and acquisition , limiting us to non - hazardous materials ( excluding materials such as thallium and beryllium salts , which have been previously used @xcite ) that are common chemical reagents . as a result of these constraints ,",
    "our filters consist of magnesium oxide ( @xmath3 ) and calcium carbonate ( @xmath4 ) , both with 5 - 20 @xmath0 typical particle sizes .",
    "see table [ table:1 ] for the composition of the reststrahlen composite layer , obtained from the maxwell - garnett theory @xcite .",
    "the measured optical transmissions for these powder filters are shown in figure [ reststrahlen ] .",
    "these transmission spectra exhibit the characteristic absorption features expected for both materials @xcite .",
    "we combined these powders in equal parts ( by mass ) to toluene thinned optical epoxy and applied it with the spraygun . for the full composite filter , this epoxy layer also adhered the two silicon wafers together .",
    "the particle size is sufficiently small that the epoxy layer can be treated as a dielectric mixture that is well described by mean field effective medium approximations @xcite in the instrument band of 70 - 170 ghz ( see figure [ lf ] ) .",

    "it is known that some reststrahlen materials have absorption bands that open up when the material is cooled down .",
    "in particular , alumina ( @xmath5 ) is known to have a section of its absorption band ( between 30 and 300 @xmath0 ) open up at temperatures of tens of kelvin @xcite . to explore whether this would be problematic with our materials ,",
    "a powder filter consisting of our mixture of @xmath4 and @xmath3 was measured in a fourier transform spectrometer ( fts ) at a range of temperatures between 4 k and 300 k. plots of the extremal temperatures are shown in the right panel of figure [ reststrahlen ] . from this , it is apparent that changes in the absorption spectrum are minimal , and do not compromise the filtering performance of a 300 k blackbody significantly .      high resistivity silicon is an excellent material for millimeter and submillimeter wave optics . the low loss ( tan @xmath6 < 7e-5 ) @xcite and high refractive index allows for refractive optics with negligible loss .",
    "high purity , single - crystal silicon is available in large diameters and can be readily obtained .",
    "additionally , silicon has a high thermal conductivity ( @xmath7)@xcite , which prevents filters with an absorptive component from heating up .",
    "the high refractive index of silicon presents the problem of high reflectivity for optics , but this problem has been successfully managed with a machined sub - wavelength anti - reflective surface on the outer surfaces of the optics .",
    "these features allow for the creation of antireflection  coatings `` with simulated dielectric layers .",
    "these metamaterial antirreflection surfaces allow for high transmission optics ( > 99% transmission across a 70 - 170 ghz band for a three - layer simulated dielectric coating @xcite ) fabricated entirely from silicon . a thorough discussion of this antireflection surface treatment approach is given in datta et al @xcite .",

    "the high thermal conductivity of silicon and low absorption means that there is negligible heating of the filter center relative to the heatsunk edge . additionally , silicon is a stiffer , more mechanically robust substrate , which allows for better control of lithographic features and finished filters that are stronger and less susceptible to deformation and wrinkling due to thermal cycling .",
    "the composite construction of our filters additionally integrates absorptive components to improve the overall out - of - band rejection beyond what can be attained with a reasonable number of stacked reflective components .",
    "compared to bulk absorptive filters such as alumina , our filters offer the ability to reflectively reject a significant portion of the power , reducing the load on the cryogenic system .",
    "the reststrahlen materials we used are also easy to obtain .",
    "the use of multiple reststrahlen materials allows for selection of complementary sets of materials that improves the frequency coverage and prevents sections of the band from becoming transmissive ( such as happens with alumina when cooled ) .",
    "silicon is a lower loss material than alumina and the antireflection coatings , being metamaterial silicon , are significantly lower loss than the epoxies used to antireflection coat bulk alumina filters , and the thermal conductivity of silicon is significantly higher than alumina or ptfe . finally , the composite filter offers a number of adjustable parameters not present in bulk filters that allow better tailoring of the filter characteristics to achieve the desired performance .",
    "the components of this style of silicon substrate composite filters all have applicability across a broad range of frequencies .",
    "the limiting frequencies for the different components vary , but filters can be constructed using these techniques and some subset of the components for frequencies ranging from tens of gigahertz to hundreds of terahertz depending on the components used .",
    "the frequency scaling of each of the four important components is discussed in this section .",
    "the combination of several of these components can form effective filters across a wide range of frequencies .",
    "the frequency selective metal mesh features can be fabricated across the full range of sizes available with modern lithographic techniques .",
    "this results in applicability across the full range over which silicon is transparent , up to the beginning of the absorption band at 1 @xmath0 wavelength ( 300 thz ) .",
    "silicon offers better control and repeatability of lithographic features than plastic substrates , allowing smaller features ( and therefore higher frequencies ) to be attained .",
    "additionally , the metal features can be formed with both high- and low - pass frequency responses , as well as with anisotropy , which enable a range of filtering characteristics , including band - defining filters , and filters with polarization dependence .",
    "the high - resistivity silicon substrate offers excellent transmission performance from low frequencies up to the beginning of its absorption band in the near - infrared .",
    "it begins to become absorptive at a wavelength of approximately 1 @xmath0 , which corresponds to the plasma frequency ( 300 thz ) in the media@xcite . at frequencies lower than this ( longer wavelengths ) ,",
    "it remains highly transmissive and low loss , with typical loss tangent below 0.0002 across the thz region @xcite , and remaining low through the ir ( with the exception of two lattice absorption features at 600 and 650 @xmath2 , corresponding to 18 and 19 thz or wavelengths of 15 and 16 @xmath0)@xcite .",
    "the metamaterial antireflective coatings have applicability to a similarly broad range of frequencies .",
    "at lower frequencies , the coatings can be machined into the surfaces using a dicing saw or conventional grinding techniques .",
    "this approach to the antireflection coatings has been successfully demonstrated for frequencies up to 1.5 thz with excellent performance .",
    "with increasing frequency , higher precision fabrication approaches become necessary . using laser machining to cut smaller features",
    "is one option , up to the limits of current laser machining capabilities .",
    "additionally , lithographic techniques involving the patterning of the surface and etching of features , such as deep reactive ion etching ( drie ) offer a solution to still higher frequencies , with attainable feature sizes of tens of nanometers that would be suitable for antireflection coatings well above the 1 @xmath0 absorption cutoff of silicon .    for higher frequency and non - cryogenic applications , conventional antireflection coating approaches",
    "can also be used , substituting layers of bulk dielectric materials ( or applied thin films of dielectric materials ) for the simulated dielectric formed by the metamaterial silicon .",
    "the scattering and absorptive powder layer is useful only for lower frequencies due to the fixed reststrahlen bands and limits on attainable powder size .",
    "the particulate size of the powders can be selected to move the scattering peak to higher or lower frequencies as needed , but the absorption bands of the materials are fixed by the material choice .",
    "for some applications , suitable materials are available that will enhance the overall light rejection of the filter . for filters where blocking in these bands",
    "is not desired , the scattering and absorptive powder can be removed from the design . the epoxy binder can likewise be removed in favor of direct bonding the wafers , for applications where the epoxy would increase the loss and is not needed as a carrier for scattering and absorptive powders .",
    "in addition to forming effective free - space ir blocking filters , this filtering approach offers several novel possibilities for silicon - substrate optical elements .",
    "lower frequency - selective metal elements can be incorporated into these filters to aid in defining the instrument signal band .",
    "anisotropic application of these filtering techniques can form birefringent materials .",
    "these filters can be easily and inexpensively integrated into other optical components , such as silicon lenses .",
    "filters with higher cutoff frequencies and better uniformity can also be constructed for effectively blocking higher frequencies ( into the mid - ir and higher ) due to the high quality of silicon substrates available ( superior material properties and surface finish allow for finer lithography , leading to better high frequency performance , a current limit of plastic - substrate filters @xcite ) .",
    "the frequency range can be tuned by adjusting the reflective grid parameters , the scattering particle size , and the specific material used for scatterers , and multi - layer reflective structures can be formed to increase the overall reflectivity .",
    "direct wafer bonding can reduce or eliminate the need for lossy epoxy components , and reflective layers can be precisely spaced using standard lithographic techniques to set the layer thicknesses .",
    "collectively , these techniques will further improve control of the filter properties , enabling higher performance and better customization of the filter characteristics to the desired application .",
    "finally , more complex metamaterial behaviors can be added through more complicated lithographic features and machined subwavelength features .",
    "this enables a wide array of novel optical characteristics with potentially broad consequences for future imaging systems .",
