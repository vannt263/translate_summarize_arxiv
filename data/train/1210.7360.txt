    "even though noncommutative geometry @xcite was invented to describe ( virtual ) noncommutative spaces it turned out also to provide new perspectives on ( classical ) commutative spaces . in particular connes idea of spectral triples aiming at a spectral description of geometry has generated new concepts , or shed new light on existing ones , for topological spaces : dimension spectrum , seeley type coefficients , spectral state , or dirichlet forms are notions which are derived from the spectral triple and we will talk about here .",
    "indeed , we study in this paper certain spectral triples for commutative algebras which are associated with stationary bratteli diagrams , that is , with the space of infinite paths on a finite oriented graph . such bratteli diagrams occur in systems with self - similarity such as the tiling systems defined by substitutions .",
    "our work can be seen as part of a largeer scheme to study self - similar structures with the help of spectral triples .",
    "this has mainly been done for fractals @xcite and recently also for tilings @xcite .",
    "there has also been work on spectral triples for af - algebras @xcite , which are ( mostly non - commutative ) algebras that may be very effectively described by bratteli diagrams .",
    "although the algebras we look at here are commutative af - algebras our approach to constructing a spectral triple is quite different from the one in @xcite and does not easily generalise to non - commutative af - algebras .",
    "our construction derives from earlier onces for metric spaces which go under the name `` direct sum of point pairs '' @xcite or `` approximating graph '' @xcite , suitably adapted to incorporate the self - similar symmetry .",
    "the construction is therefore more rigid .",
    "the so - called dirac operator @xmath0 of the spectral triple will depend on a parameter @xmath1 which is related to the dilation of the self - similarity .",
    "we observe a new feature which , we believe , ought to be interpreted as a sign of self - similarity : the zeta function is periodic with purely imaginary period @xmath2 . correspondingly , what corresponds to the seeley coefficients ( in the case of manifolds ) in the expansion of the trace of the heat - kernel @xmath3 is here given by functions of @xmath4 which are @xmath5-periodic .",
    "this has consequences for the usual formulae for tensor products of spectral tiples .",
    "if we take the tensor product of two such triples and compare the spectral states @xmath6 for the individual factors with the spectral state @xmath7 of the tensor product , then a formula like @xmath8 will not always hold due to resonance phenomena of the involved periodicities .",
    "the heat kernel we were referring to above is the kernel of the semigroup generated by @xmath9 and hence does not involve the algebra .",
    "but the spectral triple gives in principle rise to other semigroups whose generators may be defined by dirichlet forms of the type @xmath10^*[d , g])$ ] . here @xmath11 are represented elements of the algebra and @xmath7 a state .",
    "we will take for @xmath7 the spectral state , a common choice , but not the only possible one .",
    "pearson - bellissard @xcite , for instance , choose the standard operator trace .",
    "there is however a difficulty , namely it is a priori not clear what is the right domain of definition of @xmath12 . as we will conclude from this work , the choice of domain is crucial and needs additional ingredients .",
    "this is why we can only discuss rigorously dirichlet forms and laplacians ( their infinitesimal generators ) in the second part of the paper , when we consider our applications",
    ".    our main application will be to the tiling space of a substitution tiling . in this case",
    "the finite oriented graph defining the spectral triple is the substitution graph .",
    "moreover , the spectral triple is essentially described by the tensor product of two spectral triples of the above type , one for the transversal and one for the longitudinal direction .",
    "there will be thus two parameters , @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "the additional ingredients which will allow us to define a domain for the dirichlet form @xmath12 are the dynamical eigenfunctions of the translation action on the tiling space .",
    "we have to suppose that these span the hilbert space of @xmath15-functions on the tiling space and we are thus lead , by solomyak s theorem @xcite , to consider pisot substitutions .",
    "this means that the perron - frobenius eigenvalue of the substitution matrix is @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is a pisot number and @xmath18 the dimension of the tiling .",
    "our main result about the dirichlet form can then be qualitatively explained as follows : in order to have non - trivial dirichlet forms the parameters @xmath13 and @xmath14 have to be fixed such that @xmath19 and @xmath20 where @xmath21 is an algebraic conjugate to @xmath17 , distinct from @xmath17 , with maximal modulus .",
    "the modulus @xmath22 is strictly smaller than @xmath23 by the pisot - property and larger than @xmath24 .",
    "it is equal precisely for quadratic unimodular pisot numbers .",
    "it then follows that the laplacian defined by the dirichlet form can be interpreted as an elliptic operator on the maximal equicontinuous factor of the translation action on the tiling space .",

    "in section  [ sec - tilings ] we apply our findings to substitution tiling spaces @xmath81 .",
    "we consider geometric substitutions of the simplest form , as in @xcite , which are defined by a decomposition rule followed by a rescaling , i.e.  each prototile is decomposed into smaller tiles , which , when stretched by a common factor @xmath82 ( the dilation factor ) are congruent to some original tile .",
    "the result of the substitution on a tile is called a supertile ( and by iteration then an @xmath83-th order supertile ) .",

    "the approximating graph for @xmath81 is constructed with the help of _ doubly _ infinite paths over the substitution graph .",
    "_ half _ infinite paths describe its canonical transversal .",

    "indeed , the first of the two spectral triples describes the transversal and the second the longitudinal part of @xmath81 . since the graph matrix of the reversed graph is the transpose of the original graph matrix we will have to deal with only one set of eigenvalues @xmath85 .",
    "it turns out wise , however , to keep two dilation parameters @xmath13 and @xmath14 as independent parameters , although they will later be related to the dilation factor @xmath17 of the substitution .",

    "we discuss in section  [ ssect - pisot ] the particularities of pisot substitutions .",
    "these are substitutions for which the dilation factor @xmath17 is a pisot number : an algebraic integer greater than @xmath23 all of whose galois conjugates have modulus less than @xmath23 . their dynamical system @xmath89 factors onto an inverse limit of @xmath90-tori , its maximal equicontinuous factor @xmath91 , where @xmath92 is the algebraic degree of @xmath17 .",
    "the substitution induces a hyperbolic homeomorphism on that inverse limit which allows us to split the tangent space at each point into a stable and an unstable subspace , @xmath93 and @xmath94 .",

    "notice that by the decomposition of the representation of a function as @xmath1131 , we have @xmath1132 where @xmath135 is the _ longitudinal gradient _ on @xmath81 : it takes derivatives along the leaves of the folliation ; so it reads on the representation of @xmath84 simply @xmath1133 .",
    "define the operator on @xmath1134 : @xmath1135 we thus we have @xmath1136 where @xmath1137 is the space of longitudinally @xmath1138 functions on @xmath81 .",
    "so we see that for @xmath1139 , @xmath1140 is essentially self - adjoint on the domain @xmath1137 , and therefore the form @xmath99 is closable . for @xmath1141",
    "the form is not closable .",
    "we show that @xmath1142 decomposes , for suitable @xmath11 , into two pieces : one which has a limit , and the other which is oscillating with a phase which will be assumed to be non resonant ( definition  [ def - resphase ] ) .",
    "this will prove that @xmath1143^\\ast [ d_{tr},g_{tr}]$ ] is the sum of a strongly regular and a non resonant part , and will imply by corollary  [ cor - prodstrongreg ] and lemma  [ lem - stateres ] the decomposition of @xmath98 claimed in equation  .",
    "one might be tempted to consider functions which are transversally locally constant to define its core .",
    "however , it quickly becomes clear that @xmath98 vanishes on such functions .",
    "indeed , if @xmath1145 is transversally locally constant , then there exists @xmath1146 , such that @xmath1147 gives a partition of @xmath726 on which @xmath31 is constant .",
    "so we see from equation   that @xmath1148 for all @xmath1149 , @xmath1150 , and hence @xmath1151 .",
    "we will therefore consider a different core , namely the space generated by the eigenfunctions of the action .",
    "we assume that these form a dense set of @xmath1152 which is equivalent to the fact that the tiling is pure point diffractive .",
    "consider an eigenfunction to eigenvalue @xmath113 , @xmath122 . by",
    "definition @xmath112 satisfies @xmath1153 for all @xmath988 and @xmath1154 .",
    "given @xmath731 , @xmath846 , and any @xmath1155 , we have @xmath1156 by equation  .",
    "then equation   gives @xmath1157 and hence @xmath1158 as for the longitudinal form , we average over boxes which partition @xmath821 : @xmath1159)$ ] , for @xmath1160 , and @xmath1161 , and we get @xmath1162 with @xmath1163 in view of equation   let us consider @xmath1164 summing those terms up over @xmath731 , the integrals yield @xmath1165 by orthogonality of the set of eigenfunctions . hence we get @xmath1166 we now use the results of section  [ ssect - pisot ] : using equation  , expanding the exponential , and neglecting terms proportional to @xmath1167 against @xmath1168 if @xmath1169 we approximate @xmath1170 here @xmath374 is such that @xmath1067 for @xmath1171 and we wrote @xmath1172 .",
    "the second approximation is justified by the fact that @xmath1173 for all @xmath386 .",
    "we assume now that the phases are non resonant ( definition  [ def - resphase ] ) : @xmath1174 for all @xmath107 .",
    "this implies that the oscillating parts of @xmath1143^\\ast [ d_{tr},g_{tr}]$ ] are non resonant , and hence by lemma  [ lem - resphi ] do not contribute to @xmath1175^\\ast [ d_{tr},g_{tr } ] \\otimes { { \\mathbf 1}}\\bigr)$ ] in equation  . concerning the non oscillating part ,",
    "so when @xmath1176 , we clearly see that they vanish in the limit @xmath1177 if @xmath1178 and that they tend to @xmath274 , as @xmath1179 , if @xmath1180 . finally , if @xmath1181 then the non oscillating part of @xmath1182 converges to @xmath1183 define the operator @xmath1184 on the linear space of dynamical eigenfunctions by @xmath1185 then , on the space of dynamical eigenfunctions the transversal form is given by @xmath1186 clearly , @xmath98 is closable but trivial if @xmath1187 , whereas @xmath98 is not closable if @xmath1188 .",
    "we summarize here our results about the dirichlet forms . for a pisot number @xmath17 of degree @xmath981 ,",
    "we denote @xmath1189 , the other galois conjugates in decreasing order of modulus .",
    "we write the sub - leading eigenvalues in the form @xmath105 , @xmath1190 , where @xmath1191 .",
    "in particular , @xmath1169 for @xmath1192 .",
    "if the dynamical spectrum is purely discrete then the set of finite linear combinations of dynamical eigenfunctions is a core for @xmath12 on which it is closable .",
    "furthermore , @xmath109 , and @xmath110 has generator @xmath1196 given by @xmath1197 where @xmath1198 and @xmath1199 .",
    "we have calculated the explicit formulas for @xmath1200 and @xmath1201 above .",
    "it remains to insert ( [ eq - geom ] ) into ( [ eq - trlaplace ] ) .",
    "eigenfunctions to distinct eigenvalues are orthogonal and hence form an orthogonal basis for the hilbert space by assumption .",
    "standard arguments show then that @xmath1202 is essentially self - adjoint and hence the form closable .",
    "since the dynamical spectrum is pure point and all eigenfunctions continuous the factor map @xmath1205 becomes an isomorphism between @xmath1206 and @xmath1207 , where @xmath1208 is the normalized haar measure on @xmath91 .",
    "the dirichlet form @xmath12 can therefore also be regarded as a form on @xmath1207 .",
    "we consider again first the simpler unimodular case in which @xmath91 is a @xmath90-torus .",
    "each point in @xmath91 has a tangent space which we may identify with @xmath1209 , the direct sum of the spaces tangent to the unstable and the stable direction of @xmath1028 , respectively .",
    "now the directional derivative at @xmath430 along @xmath1210 is given by @xmath1211 we thus have @xmath1212 in the non - unimodular case one obtains essentially the same : @xmath91 is an inverse limit of tori @xmath1213 with respect to the map @xmath1028 , @xmath1214 .",
    "an element of @xmath91 is a sequence @xmath1215 of elements @xmath1216 satifying @xmath1217 .",
    "the action @xmath1013 of @xmath991 on @xmath91 is thus @xmath1218 .",
    "the continuous functions on @xmath91 are the direct limit of continuous functions on the tori with respect to the pull back of @xmath1028 , @xmath1219 .",
    "the elements of @xmath1220 are approximated by sequences @xmath1221 of elements @xmath1222 which are eventually @xmath175 modulo the equivalence relation identifying @xmath1223 with @xmath175 .",
    "it follows that the definition of the directional derivative is compatible with the above equivalence relation so that the expression @xmath1224 makes sense .",
    "in particular , since each eigenfunction corresponds to an element of the form @xmath1225 , @xmath1226 , we obtain the same formula as above : @xmath1227 and hence also the same formulae for @xmath1200 and @xmath1201 .",
