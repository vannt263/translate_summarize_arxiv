    "more than a decade ago , heiles found hi shells , supershells and `` worms '' in the milky way galaxy ( heiles 1979 , 1984 ) .",
    "these structures are seen protruding from the plane of the galaxy in the z - direction .",
    "diameters of the shells and supershells range from a few tens of pc to a few kpc . in some cases ,",
    "the shells diameters change with velocity , indicative of expansion .",
    "similar features are also found in some external galaxies ( e.g. , ngc  5775 , irwin 1994 ; ngc  4631 , rand and van der hulst , 1993 ) either as shells , partial shells or extensions .",
    "m31 is also observed to have hundreds of hi `` holes '' , regions devoid of neutral hydrogen , which are possibly cavities within shells or supershells ( @xcite ) .",
    "several other example also exist , but the list is still short .",
    "two possible explanations have been proposed : 1 ) the effect of stellar winds and supernova explosions and 2 ) collisions of clouds with a galactic disk ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "considerable effort has been expended in the first category beginning with the `` galactic fountain '' model of shapiro and field ( 1976 ) .",
    "norman and ikeuchi ( 1989 ) then extended this to develop the `` chimney model '' in which they propose that high - latitude features are formed due to clustered supernova explosions .",
    "the hot gas in the disk flows to the halo via `` chimneys '' with walls of hi gas , cools at high - latitude and subsequently falls back onto the disk .",
    "this way , a circulation of mass , energy and momentum is set up between the disk and the halo .",
    "it has been argued ( @xcite and others ) that kpc scale features observed in our own and other galaxies are too large and require too many input supernovae ( e.g. , @xmath810,000 in some cases ) to be explained in this way .",
    "thus there exists an energy problem for large hi supershells if they are created by supernovae and stellar winds . the cloud collision model , in part",
    "a response to this problem , on the other hand , requires the presence of a companion .",
    "thus the discovery of hi shells in _",
    "isolated _ systems would strongly favour an internal origin .",
    "we have therefore targeted one such galaxy , ngc  3044 , which we felt to be a good candidate for hi extensions ( see below ) and has no nearby companions .",

    "solomon and sage ( 1988 ) classify it as a type i galaxy ( i.e , second lowest level of interaction ) , which has companions within 10d@xmath9 ( @xmath10  mpc in projection , where h is given by @xmath11/100 ) , on the palomar sky survey ( pss ) print , with a velocity difference of less than 1000  and showing no morphological disturbance . a dust lane",
    "( @xmath12 , @xmath13 ) appears prominently on the northwestern ( nw ) side of the galaxy , obscuring part of the disk . above the dust lane ,",
    "a faint feature protrudes at an angle away from the major axis appears to be the source of the classification by snchez - saavedra @xmath14 ( 1990 ) of the galaxy as having a `` barely perceptible '' optical warp pointing in a counter - clockwise direction ( inverse integral sign ) . on the southeastern ( se ) side ,",
    "the galaxy s optical disk fades out more gradually than the nw end , suggesting a possible asymmetric distribution of matter .",
    "ngc  3044 was originally observed as part of a survey to search for galaxies with extended radio continuum halos .",
    "the results ( @xcite ) show the galaxy to have extended radio continuum emission to distances as far as 8  kpc from the plane .",
    "since this galaxy is also infrared bright ( @xcite ) , it therefore appeared to be a good candidate for finding high - latitude neutral hydrogen arcs and filaments . throughout this paper",

    "the distribution of neutral hydrogen in velocity space can most easily be discerned from channel maps .",
    "the naturally weighted channel maps in figure  [ f2a](a ) show clearly that the se side of the galaxy is receding and the nw side is approaching .",
    "since the dust lane occurs most prominently along the south edge of the galaxy , this must be the closest edge to us .",
    "therefore , any trailing spiral structure observed should have an inverted `` s '' shape",
    ".    there is distinct evidence of hi arcs and extensions and high latitude features away from the plane of the galaxy .",
    "for example , on the se side , a disconnected feature at @xmath23 , @xmath24 reaches a height of @xmath25  kpc in the 1422  channel and an impressive high - latitude extension is found on the nw side at @xmath26 , @xmath27 from 1110  to 1235  .",
    "it reaches a projected height of 7.1@xmath2  kpc from the midplane . these features and others",
    "will be discussed in more detail in  [ subsec : arcs ] .",
    "the channel maps also reveal the asymmetric distribution of gas in the galaxy , which we highlight in figure  [ f2b](b ) , by superimposing selected channel maps of equally red- and blue - shifted velocities with respect to systemic .",
    "the hi distribution of the receding side ( dotted contours ) is much more elongated than that of the approaching side ( solid contours ) and the approaching side is more `` active '' displaying the largest high - latitude extensions above the hi disk .",
    "the disk appears to be fairly straight at high velocities , although the outer contours ( 1.5 - 3@xmath28 ) on the nw side dip below the major axis , probably due to an extension .",
    "the asymmetry will be discussed in  [ subsec : asymmetry ] .      in figure  [ f3a](a ) , the velocity - integrated column density ( moment zero ) map of ngc  3044 for the uniformly weighted data is superimposed on the optical grey - scale image from the digitized sky survey .",
    "the naturally weighted column density map ( contours and grey - scale ) are shown in figure  [ f3b](b ) . in figure  [ f3a](a )",
    ", one extension is particularly obvious ",
    "labelled f10 ( feature 10 , see  [ subsec : arcs ] ) .",
    "the disk s column density peaks at @xmath29 , @xmath30 . besides this peak , there are three other peaks along the major axis",
    ". the two outermost ones are roughly symmetrically located with respect to the central peak , both at a distance of about 10@xmath2  kpc ( 126@xmath16 ) on either side .",
    "the nw peak is 2.5 times stronger in intensity than its counterpart on the se side , being @xmath31 and @xmath32 , respectively .",
    "the peak of the hi distribution does not coincide with the peak of the optical image but is offset by about 43@xmath16 along the major axis to the se .",
    "the optical distribution extends to the outer se hi peak , but with very low intensity .",
    "interestingly , there is another hi column density enhancement ( @xmath33 ) between the central peak and the outer nw peak , directly below feature 10 .",
    "this smaller peak seems to coincide with a region of low surface brightness on the optical image , which could be due to absorption by a dust lane .",
    "measured from the outermost contour of the naturally weighted map [ fig .",
    "[ f3b](b ) ] , the hi disk spans a length of 5@xmath177 or 2.3@xmath19r@xmath9 along the major axis .",
    "feature 10 is clearly visible and more extended than in figure  [ f3a](a ) along with various other extensions .",
    "f10 extends out to about 6@xmath2  kpc above the plane of the galaxy in figure  [ f3b](b ) .",
    "in fact , figure  [ f3b](b ) shows an extensive disturbance in the region near feature 10 .",
    "we show below ( see @xmath34 ) that feature 10 is indeed an expanding feature .",
    "other protruding features are also visible in figure  [ f3b](b ) . for example , the hole at @xmath35 , @xmath36 and numerous protrusions along the northern edge of the galaxy can be seen .",
    "= 2.3 in    the naturally weighted velocity field of ngc  3044 is shown in figure  [ f4 ] .",
    "the kinematic major axis is parallel to the optical major axis to within one degree out to a radius of about 50@xmath16 ( 4@xmath2  kpc ) .",
    "the kinematic minor axis is not perpendicular to the inner kinematic major axis , this is typically an indication of a bar structure ( bosma , 1981 ) , which is consistent with the optical classification of this galaxy . beyond about 1@xmath177",
    "( 8@xmath2  kpc ) on the nw side , the velocity field becomes disturbed .",
    "for example , there is a closed 1160  contour at the position of f10 . on both sides , beyond 4@xmath2  kpc , the kinematic major axis bends slightly towards the south .",
    "therefore the major axis does not resemble the more commonly seen kinematic warp in other edge - on galaxies and we interpret the disturbance near feature 10 as high - latitude features instead of a simple warp .    in figure  4",
    ", we plot the systemic velocity of the galaxy , obtained from the global profile , on the major axis of the galaxy ( represented by @xmath37 at @xmath38 , @xmath39 ) .",
    "this position is significantly different from the position of both the column density peak ( labelled @xmath40 in fig .",
    "4 ) as well as the optical centre ( labelled + ) , so that the kinematic centre is between the column density peak and optical centre .",
    "however , the kinematic centre does coincide with the peak of the radio continuum map ( represented by @xmath41 ) .",
    "the kinematic centre given by our model ( labelled @xmath42 ) is also shown .",
    "this will be discussed more fully in  [ subsec : modelgeo ] . here",
    ", we identify the radio continuum centre as the ` true ' centre of the galaxy .",
    "notice all velocity contours have bends and kinks in them , especially near the outer edges of the contours .",
    "such features are usually explained by shock fronts occurring at the inside edge of spiral arms as a density - wave perturbs the local velocity field ( @xcite ) .",
    "however , due to the high inclination of ngc  3044 , this is difficult to verify from the column density map . at the location of feature 10 ,",
    "the velocity field is inconsistent with normal galactic rotation ; instead it is more blueshifted .",
    "if feature 10 is actually located at a larger distance ( so that its distance from the nucleus in figure  [ f4 ] is just a foreshortened distance in projection ) , then we would expect its radial velocity to be redshifted .",
    "it is clear that feature 10 does not follow the general flow of material in the disk below it .",
    "figure  [ f5 ] shows the global profile of ngc  3044 from the naturally weighted cube .",
    "the profile agrees within error with previously published data ( @xcite , 12@xmath43 beam ) .",

    "this equation is valid under the assumption of optical thinness .",
    "haynes and giovanelli ( 1984 ) investigated the effect of hi self - absorption on hi integrated flux as a function of morphological type and galaxy inclination .",
    "they concluded that for sc - type galaxies with inclinations like ngc  3044 , the correction factor is about 1.3 .",
    "thus @xmath57 could be up to 30% higher than the value in table  [ tab : glopara ] .",
    "the peak brightness temperature for ngc  3044 is 83.1  k in the 13@xmath16 beam .",
    "thus optical depth effects should not be strong .",
    "the hi mass of the receding side is 14% larger than the approaching side while the uncertainty due to the error bars in the global profile is only 8% .",

    "row  7 gives the estimated total mass of the galaxy within the outermost detectable hi radius .",
    "the usual equation assuming a spherical geometry is used [ @xmath61 .",
    "the quoted uncertainty reflects only the asymmetry of the receding and the approaching sides of the galaxy , which dominates the errors . using",
    "a spherical geometry may result in an overestimate of the true total mass within @xmath62 if the total mass is dominated by the disk component .",
    "the overestimate will be no more than 40% ( lequeux 1983 ) .",
    "row  8 gives the ratio of total mass to blue luminosity and row  9 gives the fractional hi mass .",
    "the values of table  [ tab : glopara ] were compared with those of roberts and haynes ( 1994 ) for the local supercluster ( galaxies with @xmath63  ) , correcting to their value of @xmath11 . with an additional slight correction for the method of calculating @xmath1 ,",
    "we find that all values for ngc  3044 are typical for its hubble type .",
    "for edge - on galaxies , the usual first and second moment analysis ( @xcite ) can not be used successfully to obtain density and velocity distributions because the flux density at each pixel results from an integration along the line of sight which spans many galactocentric radii .",
    "we instead use the technique of irwin and seaquist ( 1991 ) and irwin ( 1994 ) which models the intensity at every pixel given the radial and perpendicular density distributions and the form of the rotation curve .",
    "these curves are parameterized , and the parameters are fit via a non - linear least squares algorithm .",
    "the parameters are a subset of _ ra _ and _ dec _ of the nucleus , the position angle ( _ pa _ ) and inclination ( _ i _ ) of the galaxy , the systemic velocity ( @xmath64 ) , the galactocentric radius ( @xmath65 ) at which maximum rotational velocity ( @xmath66 ) occurs , a rotation curve shape index ( _ m _ ) , the peak volume density of the distribution ( @xmath67 ) , the density scale length for the radial distribution ( @xmath68 ) and the scale height ( @xmath69 ) of the vertical distribution .",
    "the model intensities are then smoothed to the spatial resolution of the data and the residuals ( data minus model ) are found .",
    "the best result is considered to be the model producing the lowest residuals .",
    "the trial density distributions are exponential or gaussian for both the radial and z - axis distributions centered at the galaxy centre and midplane , respectively .",
    "in addition , a gaussian or exponential ring distribution in the plane of the galaxy centered at a radius of @xmath70 was also tried .",
    "the choices for the form of the velocity curve are the brandt curve and a user specified numerical rotation curve which we take from the velocity - position diagram along the major axis ( fig  6 ) ( allowing the amplitude to vary ) .",
    "the model also allows for a velocity dispersion .",
    "thus the geometrical parameters ( particularly the inclination which can not normally be found without an assumption of the scale height ) , the velocity distribution and the density distribution ( radial and vertical ) can be found",
    ". for ngc  3044 , we model the uniformly weighted data cube as it has a higher spatial resolution than the naturally weighted cube , yet the integrated flux density ( 42@xmath466  jy@xmath50km / s ) still agrees with that of the naturally weighted cube ( see table  [ tab : glopara ] ) .",
    "there are 2248 independent data points of real positive emission , hence the free parameters should be well constrained .",
    "the best fit results are shown in table  [ tab : model ] for the entire galaxy ( column  2 ) and the receding ( column  3 ) and advancing sides ( column  4 ) .",
    "column  1 is a list of free parameters .",
    "brandt rotation curves are used for all the models in this table , since they resulted in better fits in all trials than a user - specified numerical curve .",
    "we shall hereafter use notations such as ` rg(gs)-ex ' to represent a model having a gaussian ring distribution in the plane and an exponential distribution in the z - direction .",

    "in the following , we discuss two of the most remarkable features of ngc  3044 , namely , the hi asymmetric distribution and the high - latitude structures .",
    "these features are readily understood for an interacting galaxy but remain puzzling in a seemingly isolated galaxy like ngc  3044 .",
    "the asymmetric appearance of the optical disk has been described in  [ sec : intro ] while the hi asymmetry is shown in the hi global profile ( figure  5 ) and the rotation curve ( figure  [ f6 ] ) and was discussed in  [ subsec : hidistri ] . in figure",

    "all the above points to a global asymmetry which manifested itself in various components of this galaxy .    as indicated in ",
    "[ sec : intro ] , there is no morphological evidence for a disturbance in this galaxy ( solomon and sage 1988 ) .",
    "what , then , could have caused the asymmetric distribution in ngc  3044 ?",
    "we note here that hi asymmetries in field spirals are quite common .",
    "for example , at least 50% of 1400 field galaxies were classified as asymmetrical by richter and sancisi ( 1994 ) .",

    "zaritsky ( 1995 ) suggests that past mergers may be the cause of the optical asymmetries in a sample of about 30 galaxies .",
    "could the asymmetry in ngc  3044 be similarly due to a past merger , perhaps with a smaller companion ?",
    "mergers between gas - rich disks and satellite galaxies ( i.e. , minor mergers ) have been studied extensively via simulations ( e.g. , quinn @xmath14 , 1993 , mihos and hernquist , 1994 and hernquist and mihos , 1995 ) . in general , the effect on the parent galaxy for assimilating a satellite one tenth its own mass are : 1 .",
    "massive gas in - flow to the nucleus causing a brief ( @xmath97 years ) starburst phase ; 2 .",
    "heating of the stellar disk ( i.e. , increase in vertical scale height by a factor of a few ) ; 3 . flaring and warping of the stellar disk .",
    "in addition , depending on the satellite s initial density , its core may or may not survive the tidal stripping to arrive at the nucleus of the parent .",
    "therefore , an obvious signature that a merger has occurred is the existence of a double nucleus . in addition , zaritsky ( 1995 ) finds a possible correlation between hi asymmetries and star formation rates using the set of hi - asymmetric galaxies from rix and zaritsky ( 1995 ) .",
    "the higher than normal star formation rates are consistent with the starburst phase expected after a minor merger .",
    "we do not yet have the data which could search for all of these effects .",
    "star formation rates can be investigated , though .",
    "ngc  3044 is indeed classified as infrared - bright , but this is based on the iras 60@xmath98 flux density ( soifer @xmath14 1987 ) .",
    "the infrared luminosity calculated from the 60@xmath98 and the 100@xmath98 flux densities given by soifer @xmath14 ( 1989 ) is 4.8@xmath99 and the massive star formation rate , following condon ( 1992 ) , is given by @xmath100 .",
    "these values show that ngc  3044 is only mildly starbursting at present ( even if @xmath101 is adopted , which gives @xmath102 ) .",
    "that is , the massive star formation rate in ngc  3044 is comparable to that of the milky way ( cf .",
    "0.3 to 0.5 @xmath103 for a supernova rate of 1 every 5 - 80 years ) and lower than that of m  82 ( 2.2 @xmath103 ) by a factor of 5 .",
    "thus if a minor merger has occurred in ngc  3044 , it likely occurred of order @xmath104 10@xmath105 years ago or more .",
    "a study of the co content is underway to investigate the star formation efficiency , determine whether the co is also asymmetric and to search for evidence of an increase in molecular gas density towards the nucleus ( lee and irwin , in preparation ) .",
    "further observations ( e.g. optical or ir searches for a double nucleus or a close examination of the optical disk for flaring ) would also be useful .",
    "the naturally weighted channel maps in figure  [ f2a](a ) display numerous low intensity , high - latitude arcs and extensions away from the galactic disk .",
    "these arcs and extensions in ngc  3044 resemble the so - called `` heiles shells '' in our galaxy .",

    "some of these have very complex appearances and are probably the results of blended features along the same line - of - sight ( e.g. , feature 3 ) .",
    "these features appear to be distributed randomly along the disk of the galaxy",

    "feature 5 reaches @xmath25  kpc above the midplane ( most obvious at 1422  where it could be disconnected from the disk ) , making it the most extended feature of all .",
    "if any of these features are actually expanding shells or partial shells , they should appear as rings or partial rings in the position - velocity ( p - v ) slices across the centres of the features .",

    "the shells are not complete but are `` open '' at the sides toward lower density , both in p - v and in ra - dec space .",

    "since the input energy requirements for supershells are significant , it is worth considering the errors on @xmath124 .",
    "as indicated previously , the measured @xmath119 is a lower limit since complete shells are not observed .",

    "thus a change to @xmath101 increases @xmath124 by a factor of 1.8 . if the features are actually located at larger galactocentric distances than the projected radius , @xmath125 , then the ambient densities , @xmath126 , would be lower than the listed values . in the extreme case of a shell actually occurring at the outer radius of the hi disk ( _ r _",

    "this value gives only the kinetic energy of expansion of the feature and thus the input energy must be much higher ( i.e. by at least a factor of 10 for an efficiency of 10% ) .",
    "therefore , @xmath124 for this feature is likely to be within a factor of 2 of the value listed in table  [ tab : energetics ] .",
    "this then implies that feature 10 is at a position much closer to its projected galactocentric distance than near the edge of the disk .",
    "given the irregular density distribution in the galaxy (   [ subsec : residual ] , fig .",
    "7 ) , there are also possible variations in @xmath126 for individual shells . for example , feature 7 , with a projected center at the center of the galaxy , is the most extreme example since it could have an energy more than an order of magnitude larger than the table  [ tab : energetics ] value if @xmath126 is determined by the fits to the two sides of the galaxy separately , rather than to the galaxy as a whole ( table  [ tab : model ] ) .",
    "overall , however , the irregularities in density tend to be within @xmath104 30% of the modelled density , introducing similar sized errors into @xmath124 .",
    "most of the assumptions we have made effectively minimize the values of @xmath124 in table  [ tab : energetics ] .",
    "we conclude that the energy estimates , under the assumption of instantaneous input , are order of magnitude values .",
    "if supernova explosions are the source of the energy , then between @xmath130 to @xmath131 supernovae are required to produce the shells in table  [ tab : energetics ] .",
    "heiles ( 1979 ) found energies an order of magnitude lower for galactic shells while shells in ngc  3079 ( @xcite ) and ngc  4631 ( @xcite ) require comparable energies ( @xmath132 - @xmath133  erg ) when scaled to @xmath134 .",
    "note that ngc  3044 probably has many lower energy shells like those in the galaxy and the fact that we detect only the supershells is merely a selection effect .",
    "such a high energy requirement for the supershells is difficult to reconcile with input energies typical of galactic ob associations which contain only a few tens of stars of spectral types b0 and earlier .",
    "h@xmath135 luminosities of bright hii regions in some external late - type galaxies do suggest the existence of superclusters which contain thousands of supernovae ( heiles 1990 ) and therefore h@xmath135 observations of ngc  3044 may be helpful in this regard .",
    "there is certainly some dependence of the required input energy on adopted model .",
    "for example , if a slower , continuous energy injection is assumed over a typical cluster ( @xmath92 shell ) age ( several @xmath1910@xmath116 years ) , then we find energies which agree to within a factor of 4 with the tabulated @xmath124 for features 4 and 10 , but are at least an order of magnitude lower for the low density features 7 and 12 ( cf .",
    "vader and chaboyer 1995 ) .",
    "also , since the supershells have achieved blowout , an understanding of these features would also benefit from numerical hydrodynamical modelling for such conditions ( cf .",
    "mac low , mccray , & norman 1989 ) .",
    "nevertheless , one can not escape the fact that some of the observed high latitude features in ngc  3044 are supershells which require large input energies to produce .",
    "the kinetic energies of expansion , @xmath129 , which are model - independent and essentially assume 100% input efficiency , are of order 10@xmath115 - 10@xmath114 ergs and these kinetic energies are underestimated for reasons outlined above . for a more realistic situation",
    "in which the efficiency is 10% or less , the input energies must be at least an order of magnitude larger .",
    "we have so far implicitly assumed that the shells are formed internally through the collective effects of clustered supernovae .",
    "since the energy requirement are very high , however , the leading alternative scenario , i.e. that the supershells are produced from impacting external clouds , should also be considered .",
    "impacting cloud models are an attractive way to explain large , energetic supershells because the resulting energies are a function of the infalling mass for which there are no hard limits in the case of galaxy - galaxy interactions .",
    "if we assume that the supershells in ngc  3044 are due to impacting clouds , however , we must consider where such clouds would originate .",
    "ngc  3044 has no nearby companion , nor is there strong evidence ( apart from the asymmetry ) for a previous interaction .",
    "moreover , a previous interaction , if it occurred , more likely occurred over timescales of order 10@xmath105 yr ( a typical interaction timescale , see also  5.1 ) .",
    "however , we find kinematical ages for the shells of a few @xmath19 10@xmath116 yrs . therefore , if the shells are produced by infalling clouds , the situation is more likely one in which high velocity clouds ( hvcs ) exist around the galaxy and are continuously `` raining down '' .",
    "this also suggests that there should be evidence for such clouds around the galaxy now .",
    "one of the two supershells found in ngc  4631 ( @xcite ) was modelled by rand and stone ( 1996 ) as a hvc impact structure using a 3-d hydrodynamical simulation .",
    "they found the most likely hvc that formed the supershell has a radius of 500  pc and an hi mass of @xmath136 . since ngc  3044 and ngc  4631 have remarkably similar kinematics , global hi distribution and shell parameters ( see @xcite )",
    ", we can assume that infalling clouds of similar size and mass are required to form the supershells in ngc  3044 .",
    "converting these parameters to a column density , we find ( within one beam ) a value of @xmath137 , which corresponds to the fifth contour in figure  3(b ) .",
    "there is clearly no evidence at the present time for such massive clouds in the vicinity of ngc  3044 .",
    "thus , the impacting cloud model may be reasonable for interacting galaxies like ngc  4631 , but is much less attractive for an isolated system like ngc  3044 .",
    "from figure  9 , there appears to be a correlation between high latitude radio continuum and high latitude hi features in the case of features 3 , 6 , and 10 .",
    "indeed there appears to be an hi feature wherever a radio continuum feature exists .",
    "however , the converse is not true , as there are a number of hi features which do not ( at the sensitivity limit of the observations ) have corresponding radio continuum features .",
    "the observations are not inconsistent , at least qualitatively , with the chimney model ( @xcite ) . in this model ,",
    "the hi features are walls of ambient material swept up by spatially correlated supernova explosions .",
    "relativistic electrons then funnel through these `` chimneys '' to reach the halo .",
    "it is difficult to tell , at this resolution and with the blended features , whether the radio continuum emission is interior to a specific chimney , or whether the emission is coincident with the walls of a chimney .    as the above analysis shows ,",
    "the formation of supershells in ngc  3044 is far from clear .",
    "both supernovae models and the cloud - galaxy collision model have difficulties .",
    "however , given the timescales for shell formation , the absence of companion galaxies near ngc  3044 , and the lack of evidence for surrounding massive clouds , and the apparent correlation between high latitude hi and radio continuum features , we favour an internal origin for the supershells .",
    "several recent studies have shown , for example , that when magnetic fields are included ( not just as a secondary effect ) that large shells and blow - out can occur with more modest energy requirements ( e.g. kamaya @xmath14 1996 ; frei @xmath14 1997 ) .",
    "therefore , more sophisticated models including effects like this may reconcile the energy requirements of supershells with fewer numbers of supernovae .",
    "what has been presented in the preceding sections represents the first comprehensive hi study of the _ isolated _ , edge - on , infrared - bright galaxy ngc  3044 .",
    "the ir brightness is partly due to proximity , since the massive star formation rate is a factor of 5 lower than that of m  82 (  5.1 ) .",
    "the hi distribution in the galaxy was modelled using all available data points , i.e. hi",
    "spectral lines were modelled over the entire galaxy in order to determine the best global density and velocity distributions in the galaxy as well as the best geometrical parameters .",
    "the resulting quantities are listed in table  [ tab : model ] .",
    "a gaussian ring density distribution in the plane was found to be the best fit overall .",
    "an important result derived from the model is that the galaxy has a moderately thick hi disk with a gaussian vertical scale height of @xmath138 .",
    "this is consistent with previous observations which have also revealed a thick radio continuum disk .",
    "ngc  3044 shows a very asymmetric distribution optically , in hi , and in the radio continuum , with excellent agreement between the radio continuum and hi column density distributions ( see  [ subsec : asymmetry ] ) . in hi ,",
    "the asymmetry is particularly apparent from the global profile , which shows a lopsided double - horned structure .",
    "otherwise , however , derived global parameters tell the story of a normal sbc galaxy . the column density map confirms the asymmetric distribution of the hi in the galaxy .",
    "this is clear from the 27@xmath16 offset of the hi peak to the east of the radio continuum peak .",
    "the major - axis rotation curve also shows the asymmetry in that the approaching side of the galaxy appears to be `` truncated '' before reaching terminal velocity while the receding side stays flat for about @xmath139 after reaching terminal velocity . while the galaxy is asymmetric in hi , it also shows an extremely straight disk ( i.e. , no obvious disk warp ) .",
    "it is not clear what could have caused the asymmetry in this apparently isolated galaxy .",
    "it is likely , though , that the mechanism would have to act on the galaxy after its formation , since it is difficult to explain how the galaxy would form asymmetrically in the first place .",
    "it is noted here that asymmetries in isolated galaxies are not uncommon , which indicates that a common mechanism such as past minor mergers may be responsible for it .",
    "if this is the case for ngc  3044 , the merger likely took place over 10@xmath105 yrs ago .",
    "the velocity channel maps reveal a host of high - latitude hi extensions .",
    "we have catalogued a total of 12 such features that appear in at least two consecutive velocity channels .",
    "these features are distributed uniformly across the disk of the galaxy and above and below the plane .",
    "we derive a lower limit for mass flow to the halo of @xmath109 , = @xmath110 .",
    "there is also some correlation between high - latitude hi features and high - latitude radio continuum features ( @xmath140 5.2.3 ) .",
    "four of the high latitude features exhibit the signature of an expanding shell and have radii of order a few kpc . based on the assumption that the shells were formed by supernovae energy input ,",
    "the required input energies are in the range 4 @xmath19 10@xmath115 to 7 @xmath19 10@xmath114 @xmath141 ergs .",
    "these values vary somewhat depending on the adopted model , but it is clear , even from the kinetic energies of expansion of the individual supershells , that large numbers ( e.g. up to tens of thousands ) of correlated supernovae are required to form them .",
    "this means that ngc  3044 would have to harbour a number of such superclusters ( such as the cluster r136 in the 30 doradus region in the lmc ) , something which is not supported by the current massive star formation rate .    the alternative model , that of impacting external clouds , is even less attractive as a formation mechanism for the supershells because of the absence of companions , the fact that the supershells are young ( of order the age of a typical ob association ) and because hi clouds which are massive enough to produce these shells would have been easily detected in our data . we suggest that the supershells are indeed formed internally , but that some additional energy - boost ( e.g. through magnetic fields ) is needed to explain their large energies .",
    "the authors wish to thank the staff at the vla for obtaining the hi data and kathy perrett for coordinating the remote observation .",
    "thanks also go to denise giguere and jayanne english for many useful discussions on various data reduction techniques .",
    "we have also made used of the nasa / ipac extragalactic database ( ned ) .",
    "this work is supported by the national research council of canada .",

    "<S> the first detailed vla mapping of the neutral hydrogen distribution in the _ isolated _ , edge - on spiral galaxy ngc 3044 is presented . </S>",
    "<S> physical parameters such as @xmath0 , @xmath1 , etc . determined for this galaxy are typical for galaxies of its morphological class ( sbc ) . </S>",
    "<S> we have modelled the hi spectra in order to derive its global density and velocity distributions . </S>",
    "<S> an hi scale height of 420 @xmath2 pc is thus found . </S>",
    "<S> this can be compared to the impressive radio continuum halo , previously found to extend to @xmath3 above the midplane .    </S>",
    "<S> the present study reveals an asymmetry in the hi distribution as well as numerous high - latitude hi structures at various galactocentric radii . </S>",
    "<S> the approaching ( northwest ) side of the galaxy is 14% less massive than the receding side and its rotation curve does not reach terminal velocity . </S>",
    "<S> the rotation curve of the receding ( southeast ) side however resembles that of a normal galaxy .    </S>",
    "<S> twelve high - latitude features were catalogued , of which four exhibit the signature of an expanding shell . </S>",
    "<S> there is some correlation of these features with features observed in the radio continuum from independent data . </S>",
    "<S> the most massive shell ( feature 10 ) extends out to 6@xmath2  kpc above the galactic disk . </S>",
    "<S> the radii and masses of these shells range from @xmath4 and @xmath5 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> we have investigated the possibility that the supershells could have been produced by external impacting clouds , but conclude that this scenario is unattractive , given the age of the shells , the isolation of the galaxy , and the lack of any observed features sufficiently massive to form the shells in the vicinity of the galaxy . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , an internal origin is suggested . </S>",
    "<S> since the implied input energies from supernovae are extremely high ( e.g. from @xmath6 , corresponding to 400 @xmath7 74,000 supernovae ) , we suggest that some additional energy ( e.g. from magnetic fields ) may be needed to produce the observed supershells . </S>"
