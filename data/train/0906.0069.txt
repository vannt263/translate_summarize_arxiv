    "in 2007 , superconductivity at @xmath0k was discovered in heavily boron - doped silicon carbide ( sic : b ) at doping concentrations of @xmath1@xmath2 by means of resistivity and ac susceptibility measurements @xcite .",
    "the upper critical field @xmath3  was estimated to approximately 120oe , i.e. , a rather small value .",
    "this and the finding of a broad in - field hysteresis in temperature- ( field- ) dependent ac susceptibility measurements between cooling ( field down sweep ) and warming ( field up sweep ) , known as _ supercooling _ , lead to the surprising conclusion that sic : b is a type - i superconductor .",
    "this is in clear contrast to the reported type - ii superconductivity in the parent compounds boron - doped diamond ( c : b ) and silicon ( si : b ) @xcite .",
    "another remarkable difference among these systems is the polytypism of silicon carbide ( sic ) .",
    "many different crystal modifications with energetically slightly different ground states are reported in literature .",
    "the most common ones are 3c - sic , 2h- , 4h- and 6h - sic , and 15r - sic .",
    "the number in front of c ( = cubic unit cell ) , h ( = hexagonal ) or r ( = rhombohedral ) indicates the number of si  c bilayers stacking in the conventional unit cell .",
    "please note that all sic polytypes break inversion symmetry whereas both si and c possess an inversion symmetry centre .",
    "the sample used in the study published in ref.@xcite consists of major phase fractions of 3c- and 6h - sic , both of which do participate in the superconductivity @xcite .",
    "subsequently , a specific - heat study demonstrated that sic : b is a bulk superconductor , likely to be described in a phonon - mediated bcs - type scenario of the superconductivity with a significant ( @xmath4% ) residual density of states due to nonsuperconducting parts of the sample used .",
    "the normal - state sommerfeld parameter estimates to @xmath5mj / molk@xmath6 and the jump height fits the bcs expectation @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "this paper focuses on aluminium - doped silicon carbide ( sic : al ) .",
    "the preparation was done in a similar way as for sic : b @xcite .",
    "the sample used in this study belongs to the same batch used in ref.@xcite , where the finding of superconductivity in sic upon aluminium doping at @xmath8k is reported .",
    "it is a multiphase polycrystalline sample mainly consisting of cubic 3c - sic .",
    "in addition , pure si and al was identified by x - ray diffraction , but there is no indication of other sic polytypes in this sample .",
    "its charge - carrier concentration was estimated to @xmath9@xmath2 from a hall - effect measurement , somewhat smaller than that found for the sic : b sample .",
    "though the superconducting transition temperatures are almost the same for our sic : b and sic : al samples , the latter one does not exhibit a clear in - field hysteresis in temperature- and field - dependent resistivity measurements @xcite suggesting that aluminium - doped sic might be a type - ii superconductor . compared to sic :",
    "b , this also places sic : al closer to c : b in the theoretical phase diagram proposed in ref.@xcite .",
    "however , there is a possibility that the type - i behaviour in sic : al is  hidden ",
    "away by disorder and hence the supercooling behaviour is diminished , see refs.@xcite and @xcite .",
    "the specific - heat data presented in this paper was taken by a relaxation - time method using a commercial system ( quantum design , ppms ) .",

    "( a ) the specific heat @xmath11 as measured is shown .",

    "( a ) the specific heat @xmath11 as measured is shown .",

    "note that both axes in panel ( b ) do not start at 0.,title=\"fig:\",width=264 ]    figure[fig1 ] summarises the temperature dependence of the specific - heat data of 3c - sic : al in various dc magnetic fields @xmath10 , 50 , 100 , 200 , and 500oe .",
    "panel ( a ) gives the specific heat @xmath13  as measured and panel ( b ) gives an expanded view of the specific heat divided by temperature @xmath12 .",
    "a clear jump anomaly in the zero - field data is observed at @xmath8k coinciding with the transition temperatures found in resistivity @xcite and ac susceptibility measurements @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the jump indicates that the superconductivity in this sample is a bulk feature .",
    "however , the transition is rather broad reflecting the polycrystalline multiphase character of the sample used . a field as small as 50oe is sufficient to suppress the superconducting transition strongly and hence shifts @xmath14  to lower temperatures .",
    "in @xmath15oe only a small anomaly is left .",
    "the data for @xmath16 and 500oe are lying on top of each other , hence there is no indication of a bulk superconducting transition down to 0.5k in fields @xmath17oe . as seen in figure[fig1](b ) , there is an additional low - temperature contribution @xmath18 which is not field dependent between 200oe and 500oe indicating that the same contribution is also present at lower fields but masked by the superconducting transition . the additional entropy responsible for this upturn in the data might arises from a nuclear schottky effect due to the aluminium atoms doped into the system ( nuclear spin of al : @xmath19 ; carbon and silicon can not be responsible for it due to their @xmath20 ) .",
    "this issue needs clarification , e.g. , by extending the data to lower temperatures and higher fields , which is currently underway .     in panel ( a ) the specific - heat data @xmath12 in @xmath10oe ( closed symbols ) and 200oe ( open symbols ) from fig.[fig1 ]",
    "are shown again .",
    "the dashed line is a debye fit to the data .",
    "panel ( b ) gives the specific heat @xmath21 after subtracting the phononic contribution .",
    "the dashed - dotted line represents the normal - state sommerfeld parameter , the dotted curve is a fit to the data @xmath22 to estimate the additional contribution @xmath18 at low temperatures , see text . subtracting this additional specific heat yields the electronic specific heat @xmath23 given in panel ( c ) where the dashed curve is a fit to the zero - field data assuming a bcs - like superconducting ground state in this system , see text.,width=529 ]    in figure[fig2](a ) the specific heat data @xmath12 in @xmath10oe ( closed symbols ) and 200oe ( open symbols )",
    "are shown again .",
    "the latter field exceeds the ( upper ) critical field and hence represents the normal - state specific heat of 3c - sic : al . a fit to these in - field data in the temperature interval @xmath24k applying the conventional debye formula @xmath25 yields the normal - state sommerfeld parameter @xmath26mj / molk@xmath6 and the prefactor of the phononic contribution to the specific heat @xmath27mj / molk@xmath28 .",
    "the corresponding curve is plotted dashed in figure[fig2](a ) .",
    "the debye temperature evaluates to @xmath29k which is much smaller than that for undoped sic , i.e. , 12001300k depending on the polytype ; compare the discussion in ref.@xcite .",
    "subtracting the phononic contribution from the data shown in figure[fig2](a ) yields the data @xmath21 displayed in figure[fig2](b ) . therein the value of the normal - state sommerfeld coefficient is indicated by the dashed - dotted line .",
    "to further analyse the data , it is necessary to subtract the additional contribution @xmath18 to the specific heat below @xmath30k leading to the aforementioned strong upturn in the data",
    ". therefore the in - field data below 2k was fitted applying @xmath31 yielding the dotted curve in figure[fig2](b ) .",
    "figure[fig2](c ) gives the electronic specific heat @xmath23 after subtracting @xmath18 assuming that the additional contribution is the same in both the zero - field and in - field data .",
    "the resulting electronic specific - heat data in the superconducting state can be modeled assuming a bcs - type behaviour of @xmath23 below @xmath14   @xmath32 as described in detail in ref.@xcite . due to the polycrystalline character of the sample used , it is reasonable to assume that a certain fraction of the sample remains normal conducting allowing for a residual density of states contributing to the specific heat but not participating in the superconductivity .",
    "therefore , a residual sommerfeld coefficient @xmath33 is included in ( [ glbcs_res ] ) with @xmath34  representing the superconducting part of the sample . in this approach",
    ", @xmath35  is the only adjustable parameter .",
    "a fit to the zero - field data applying ( [ glbcs_res ] ) yields the dashed curve shown in figure[fig2](c ) with @xmath36mj / molk@xmath6 as indicated by arrows .",
    "this corresponds to a superconducting volume fraction of about 60% .",
    "entropy conservation at the transition yields the mid - point transition temperature @xmath37k , slightly lower than the onset temperature @xmath38k onbtained from resistivity and ac susceptibility measurements .",
    "the present study reveals that aside from boron - doping also aluminium doping of silicon carbide leads to a metallic phase from which eventually bulk superconductivity emerges ( @xmath8k ) which can be explained in a bcs - type phonon - mediated scenario .",
    "the superconducting volume fraction of the sample used estimates to @xmath39% .",
    "surprisingly , in spite of the different dopands , i.e. , the different size of the doped atoms , these results on sic : al do not much differ , neither qualitatively nor quantitatively , from those reported for sic : b . therefore , superconductivity in the charge - carrier doped semiconductor silicon carbide remains a highly interesting topic .",
    "the origin of the strong enhancement of the specific heat below @xmath40k needs to be clarified .",
    "a nuclear schottky effect due to the doped aluminium atoms might be responsible for the additional entropy at low temperatures .",
