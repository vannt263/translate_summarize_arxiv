    "brown dwarfs ( hereafter bds ) are objects with very low - masses ( @xmath2@xmath3 ) that develop degenerate cores before being able to settle on the stellar main - sequence @xcite .",
    "large numbers of bds have been identified in the field , in open clusters and in star - forming regions .",
    "these substellar - mass objects could be as numerous as the known stars @xcite .",
    "the detection of strong emission lines in young bds , as well as near - infrared , mid - infrared and millimiter emission exceeding those expected for normal photospheres , strongly indicate that young bds have disks where planets may form @xcite .",
    "moreover , mid - infrared spectroscopic observations obtained with spitzer / irs indicate dust evolution in the discs around young bds @xcite .",
    "one of the first obvious targets to search for planets around bds is lp944@xmath020 ( bri  b0337 - 3535 ; lehpm  3451 ; 2mass  j03393521 - 3525440 ; @xmath410.72 ,",
    "@xmath51.18 ) because it is nearby ( d=5.0 pc , @xcite ) and young ( age@xmath6320  ma , @xcite ) .",
    "this bd was first spotted over 30 years ago @xcite as a dim high proper - motion red star , and its substellar nature was revealed through the spectroscopic detection of lithium , a trademark of bds @xcite .",
    "lp944@xmath020 has a relatively early spectral class for a bd ( dm9 , @xcite ) because of its young age , and has a low - level of chromospheric and x - ray coronal activity @xcite , although occassional flares have been reported @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , lp944 - 20 was detected as a radio source suggesting the presence of strong magnetic activity @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we present a search for giant planets around lp944@xmath020 .",
    "we have monitored the radial velocity ( hereafter rv ) of this bd over 20 nights at optical and near - infrared wavelengths .",
    "we find that the rv data obtained in the optical is variable with an amplitude of 3.5 kms@xmath1 and a period between 2.5 and 3.7 hours .",
    "however the rv data measured in our near - infrared spectra have an rms dispersion of 0.36 kms@xmath1 and does not follow the periodic pattern seen in the optical .",
    "we discuss the implications of these results for rv searches for planets around brown dwarfs .",
    "the visible spectroscopic observations of lp944@xmath020 were obtained with the uv - visual echelle spectrograph ( uves ) on the vlt unit telescope 2 ( kueyen ) in service mode .",
    "the instrumental configuration was the same as described in @xcite .",
    "this setting covers simultaneously the regions from 667.0 nm through 854.5 nm and from 864.0 nm to 1040.0 nm .",
    "it includes the telluric bands between 686.0 nm and 693.0 nm and between 760.0 nm and 770.0 nm .",
    "the telluric lines were used as secondary wavelength reference because they are know to be stable within 15 ms@xmath1 @xcite .",
    "six uves rv measurements of lp944@xmath020 have been reported in the literature and a possible rv variability of this object has been noted @xcite . in this paper",
    "we report nine additional uves rv points .",
    "all of them were computed in the same way as described in detail in previous work @xcite .",
    "our infrared spectroscopic observations of lp944@xmath020 were obtained with nirspec on the keck ii telescope .",
    "they have already been described in the context of the measurement of rotational broadening @xcite .",
    "we obtained one more nirspec rv datapoint in january 2006 which was not included in the rotational velocity paper .",
    "the data reduction was identical to that of the previous spectra .",
    "near - infrared measurements of the heliocentric rv of lp944@xmath020 were computed via cross correlation of the nirspec data with spectra of the field vb10 ( gj752b , dm8 ) , which was observed with very similar instrumental configuration in 2001 june 15 and 2001 november 02 ( see fig .  [ combo ] ) . from our nirspec data , we measured the radial velocity of vb10 to be @xmath734.7@xmath81 kms@xmath1 , in very good agreement with the various values ( @xmath735.4 , @xmath735.2 , @xmath735.0 kms@xmath1 ) found in the literature @xcite .",
    "we adopted @xmath735.0 kms@xmath1 for the correlation procedure .",
    "in addition , vb10 is known to be one of the slowest rotators among ultracool dwarfs ( @xmath9sin@xmath10=6.5 kms@xmath1 , @xcite ) .",
    "we calculated the cross - correlation function in multiple echelle orders of the nirspec spectra using the task fxcor within iraf , and measured velocities by fitting a gaussian to the cross - correlation peak .",
    "we used 4 spectral orders that are free from strong telluric line contamination .",
    "two examples of those orders are shown in fig .",
    "[ combo ] .",
    "these orders include features due to ki , tio , feh , and water vapor .",
    "we note that given the good signal - to - noise ratio of the spectra and the significant similarity in spectral type between lp944@xmath020 and vb10 , the peak of the cross - correlation function is unambiguously identified .",
    "the nirspec radial velocities of lp944@xmath020 shown in table  [ vrad ] are the mean of the results in the different orders .",
    "the associated error bars correspond to the standard deviation of the mean .",
    "the uves rv dataset shows a significant scatter and we performed a periodogram analysis of it . the periodogram analysis using the scargle and clean programs @xcite found a most likely periodicity in the range 2.5 to 3.7 hours , which is close to the expected rotational period of lp944@xmath020 ( vsin @xmath10=30 kms@xmath1 , p=4.4 hours sin  @xmath10 for r = r@xmath11 ) .",
    "the clean periodogram is shown in ( fig .",
    "[ periodogram ] ) .",
    "we put the uves rv data in phase with a period of 3.7 hours ( fig .  [ phased ] ) and found a good fit with a sinusoid curve with an amplitude of 3.5 kms@xmath1 .",
    "the nirspec rv data , however , do not follow the periodic trend of the uves data ( fig .  [",
    "phased ] ) , and hence the hypothesis of a planet to explain the uves rv variations can be discarded because the rv signature of a planet should not depend on wavelength . in fact , our nirspec data has an rms dispersion of 0.36  kms@xmath1 , which is consistent with observational uncertainties . using a mass of 60 jupiters for lp944@xmath020 , we can rule out the presence of any planet with mass larger than m  sini@xmath61.0 jovian masses and period less than 30 days using the nirspec rv dataset .",
    "we confirm that the rv of lp944@xmath020 is variable at optical wavelengths as previously reported from uves observations @xcite .",
    "these authors also noted that the rv variability could not be due to starspots because the filling factor would have to be too large .",
    "now that we have ruled out the existence of a giant planet , there seems to be only one possibility left , which is the presence of inhomogeneous surface features that are not like starspots .",
    "theoretical models have predicted that there could be dust clouds in bds , and several searches for photometric variability have been performed among late - m and l dwarfs @xcite .",
    "in fact , photometric variability has been detected in lp944@xmath020 at optical wavelengths @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , near - infrared monitoring of about 20 late - m and l dwarfs failed to detect any variability @xcite .",
    "lp944 - 20 and other ultracool dwarfs dramatically violate the x - ray / radio - emission relation for normal stars , as its quiescent radio emission is 4 to 5 orders of magnitude brighter than expected from its x - ray emission @xcite .",
    "the radio emission observed in some ultracool dwarfs imply a large magnetic field strength ( over a hundred gauss averaged over the whole surface ) .",
    "thus , while it is now clear that at least some old bds have strong magnetic fields , the properties of the resulting coronae are strikingly different from those of stars . possibly , not only the coronae differ from those of stars but also the structure of the magnetic field itself . as shown by several authors @xcite fields of fully convective objects ( like bds )",
    "are expected not to be concentrated in small spots but to be distributed on a global scale .",
    "additionally , due to the low temperature of old bds the degree of ionisation in the atmosphere is very low , leading to a very low degree of the coupling between the magnetic field and the atmosphere .",
    "the coupling between the gas and the magnetic field is usually described in terms of the magnetic reynolds number @xmath12 ( were @xmath13 is a length scale , @xmath9 a velocity scale , and @xmath14 the magnetic diffusivity @xcite ) . while for the sun @xmath15 is of the order of unity , for ultracool dwarfs @xmath15 could be as low as @xmath16 @xcite .",
    "if this is true , bds with strong magnetic field should not have spots , and thus the gas - flow in the atmosphere should not be effected by the magnetic field .",
    "we propose here that the rv - variability detected with uves may be due to weather effects , i.e. variability of cloud coverage and/or flows , streams or long - lived nonmagnetic spots in the upper photosphere of this object .",
    "the near - infrared observations probe deeper in the photosphere , and hence they are less affected by those motions or structures .",
    "the small amplitude of the photometric and spectroscopic variability reported by tinney & trolley ( 1999 ) and guenther & wuchterl ( 2003 ) , respectively , indicate that the surface features do not have a large contrast with the photosphere , and hence they are not like starspots .    independently from a deep physical understanding of the cause of the rv variations in the optical , we can safely conclude on pure empirical grounds that future rv - based planet searches in late - m stars and bds will be better conducted at near - infrared wavelengths than in the optical because the targets are brighter and because the measurements are less affected by photospheric noise .",
    "this finding encourages the use of a new generation of high - resolution near - infrared spectrographs @xcite for surveying the planetary population of very low - mass stars and bds .",
