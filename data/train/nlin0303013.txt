    "as early as in 1941 kolmogorov@xcite predicted some universal features of fluid turbulence which have been confirmed by experiments in later years .",
    "it is rather surprising that they are derived from dimensional analysis based on the simple assumption of ` local homogeneity ' for small - scale turbulence .",
    "more surprising is the fact that those have little to do with the equation of dynamics of fluid .",
    "it is addressed in this paper to locate this ` missing link ' through rederivation of the -5/3 power law of the spectrum for the inertial subrange as the universal law using the dynamical equation proposed in ref.2 .",
    "the key issue for this task to work is that equation on which to describe the features of small eddies as independent of individual flow geometry . to meet this purpose a six - dimensional navier - stokes equation",
    "is employed , where additional 3d space having a length dimension , corresponding to eddy size , is introduced .",
    "originally such an equation has been derived elsewhere@xcite , using non - equilibrium statistical mechanics starting from liouville s equation . in this formalism",
    "the 3d ` eddy ' space has been introduced as natural consequence of a mathematical procedure , namely , the separation of variables of turbulent fluctuation - correlation equation .",
    "the equation stands as 6d generalization of the navier - stokes equation which in 3d physical space degenerates to the classical equation .    in what follows ,",
    "however , it is intended to rederive the same equation using phenomenologies alone on the basis same as the classical theory of krmn and howarth@xcite .",
    "then , the wave - number space is introduced for separating variables ( sec.2 ) .",
    "it is then fourier - transformed into eddy space , thereby the 6d navier - stokes equation , the basis to all what follows is established ( sec.3 ) .",
    "the equation gives a novel expression for turbulent dissipation , enabling to predict existence of a pseudo - singularity surrounding the dissipation region ( sec.4 ) .",
    "in inertial subrange , this singularity turns out to be a couple of dipoles of opposite sense , separated by the order of several tens to hundreds the kolmogorov length ( sec.5 ) .",
    "power spectrum of this locally homogeneous turbulence is calculated , showing a wave - number dependence close to -5/3 power law of the kolmogorov theory.(sec.6 )",
    "in 1938 , von krmn and howarth proposed an equation governing homogeneous isotropic turbulence whose original form is written as@xcite @xmath0 in this equation @xmath1 and @xmath2 are instantaneous velocity fluctuation at @xmath3 and @xmath4 , respectively , overbar ( @xmath5{5mm}{.1mm}$ ] ) denotes the conventional ( ensemble ) average and @xmath6 denotes the navier - stokes equation written in terms of the instantaneous fluid quantities @xmath7 where @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the average velocity and pressure , respectively , @xmath10 is the kinematic viscosity , and @xmath11 denotes nabla vector .",
    "likewise @xmath12 is defined by eq.(2 ) in which ( @xmath13 ) is replaced with ( @xmath14 ) .",
    "eq.(1 ) is an equation in 6-d physical space and time , namely , has seven independent variables ( @xmath15 ) .",
    "the classical theory@xcite chose to discuss homogeneous and isotropic turbulence to reduce independent variables to ( @xmath16 ) .",
    "we can show , however , that the equation can be renovated to be available for inhomogeneous turbulence as well by introducing separation of variables , together with a closure condition which seems plausible intuitively .",
    "the actual derivation proceeds as follows : eq.(1 ) in which @xmath17 is decomposed into average and fluctuating parts using ( 3),reads @xmath18 where @xmath19 together with @xmath20 defined as in eq.(1 ) . upon substituting eq.(5 ) into eq.(4 ) we see that the equation consists of terms of double and triple fluctuation correlations , which we will decompose as @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the wave number , @xmath23 is the characteristic length of flow geometry , r.p . denotes taking real part , and subscript @xmath24 runs 1 through 4 .",
    "a supplementary definition @xmath25 stands for the pressure fluctuation .",
    "it is more convenient for later use to employ the following alternative expressions : @xmath26 @xmath27    it is to be noted that there is no a priori reason why the double and triple correlations are to be expressed in terms of the _ same _ @xmath28 . at this point",
    "it is simply invoked as the closure condition to truncate the chain of equations at the level of eq.(4 ) .",
    "this closure can be justified only through the quality of outcome as to whether it fits with physical reality of turbulence",
    ".    with these preliminaries , eq.(4 ) with assumption ( 6,7 ) substituted into , leads to the form typical of separation of variables , here into ( @xmath3,t ) and ( @xmath29 , t ) , respectively ; @xmath30=0\\ ] ] where @xmath31 is the separation parameter having the dimension of the frequency , and @xmath32 stands for @xmath33 , and @xmath34 is defined by @xmath35_j    = ( \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}+u_r\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_r}-\\nu\\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial x_r^2})g_j    + \\frac{\\partial u_j}{\\partial x_r}g_r    + \\frac{\\partial g_4}{\\partial x_j }    + \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_r}i(g_jg_r)\\ ] ] with @xmath36 imaginary factor @xmath37 as appearing in eq.(9 ) reflects the statistical symmetry of the tensor @xmath38 , which is met under the following additional condition @xmath39^*\\ ] ] in fact , then , the two terms inside [ ] of integral ( 9 ) are commutable to each other through taking complex conjugate ( * ) , if @xmath40 is purely imaginary .",
    "thus we are led to the assertion that the only equation that need to be solved is @xmath41    to go further from this point on , we need to have relationship between frequency @xmath31 introduced as the separation parameter and wave number @xmath22 by which the solution is constructed in the form of bilinear integral .",
    "physically they are related to each other by the dispersion relation @xmath42 . or , instead , we may introduce phase velocity @xmath43 by @xmath44 with no loss of generality .",
    "in fact , its constancy does not mean the turbulent eddies being assumed as nondispersive .",
    "for the unsteady term in the equation @xmath45 is responsible for the dispersive part , if any .",
    "owing to the convolution form of integral ( 10 ) periodic factor drops off from eq.(12 ) despite its nonlinear structure by putting @xmath46 thereby we have the following equation governing its amplitude @xmath47 , @xmath48 where @xmath49_j\\nonumber\\\\   & = & [ \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t }    + u_r\\partial_r({\\mbox{\\boldmath{$k$}}})-\\nu\\partial_r^2({\\mbox{\\boldmath{$k$}}})]f_j    + \\frac{\\partial u_j}{\\partial x_r}f_r    + \\partial_j({\\mbox{\\boldmath{$k$}}})f_4    + \\partial_r({\\mbox{\\boldmath{$k$}}})i(f_jf_r)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath50 it is readily checked that expressions defined by ( 15 ) and ( 10 ) are related to each other by @xmath51_{\\footnotesize{{\\mbox{\\boldmath{$\\partial$}}}({\\mbox{\\boldmath{$k$}}})\\rightarrow \\nabla({\\mbox{\\boldmath{$x$}}})}}\\ ] ]    several remarks are in order with regards to physical implications of variables having appeared in this section : amplitude function @xmath52 as obeying eq.(14 ) is _ essentially _ complex and is _ not _ an observable .",
    "it is related to the observable quantity of fluctuation correlation through @xmath53 as is confirmed by ( 6),(11)and ( 13 ) .",
    "its complex variable structure has its origin in eq.(9 ) where the imaginary unit @xmath37 is introduced from the symmetry postulate of statistical mechanics@xcite for correlation tensor ( 18 ) .",
    "we may note some coincidental parallelism to schroedinger s wave equation where the imaginary factor secures the corresponding tensor to be hermitean as it should .",
    "the most crucial on which this paper rests is the soundness of the basis of eq.(1 ) .",
    "originally it was a product of intuition by theodore von krmn without any ` first principle ' ground shown in the paper@xcite .",
    "in fact , then , any linear combinations of @xmath54 would be claimed as equally qualified .",
    "firm basis is provided by nonequilibrium statistical mechanics@xcite to justify that the linear combination only of the form ( 1 ) is consistent with liouville s equation , namely , the equation of continuity in the phase space of hamiltonian mechanics . .",
    "the nonlinear integro - differential equation we have derived in the previous section is not very easy to deal with .",
    "since , however , the integral is of convolution type , it transforms to a simple product , through fourier transform as @xmath55 the actual operation of the transform on eq.(14 ) gives @xmath56q_j    + \\partial_j({\\mbox{\\boldmath{$s$}}})q_4    + \\frac{\\partial u_j}{\\partial x_r}q_r    + \\partial_r({\\mbox{\\boldmath{$s$}}})(q_jq_r)=0\\ ] ] where @xmath57 variable @xmath58 introduced in eq.(19 ) as the fourier variable adjoint to wave number @xmath22 has dimension of length , which stands for eddy size with direction of the vorticity vector , so may well be called _ eddy variable_. it should be remarked that eq.(20 ) is the navier - stokes equation in 6d ( physical plus eddy ) space , describing the motion of turbulent vortices moving with phase velocity @xmath43 .",
    "in fact , this equation governing @xmath59 for prescribed @xmath60 and @xmath61 is alternatively written as @xmath62{\\mbox{\\boldmath{$q$}}}=    { \\mbox{\\bf ns}}({\\mbox{\\boldmath{$\\partial$}}}({\\mbox{\\boldmath{$s$}}}),{\\mbox{\\boldmath{$u$}}}+{\\mbox{\\boldmath{$q$}}},p+\\rho q_4 )    -{\\mbox{\\bf ns}}(\\nabla({\\mbox{\\boldmath{$x$}}}),{\\mbox{\\boldmath{$u$}}},p)\\ ] ] with @xmath63 where @xmath64 has been defined by eq.(2 ) , and @xmath11 denote the nabla vector in the respective spaces .",
    "simplicity in expression for physical quantities is another advantage of working with @xmath58-space .",
    "for example , fluctuation - correlation formula ( 18 ) takes remarkably simple form @xmath65 as is easily confirmed by substituting ( 19 ) and employing definition of the delta function @xmath66 .",

    "in the kolmogorov regime , dissipation @xmath69 was introduced , together with kinematic viscosity @xmath10 , characteristic velocity @xmath71 and length @xmath23 , respectively , as an elementary parameter by which to construct the dimensional analysis .",
    "they are related to each other through the following relationships @xmath72 where the subscript k denotes the respective quantities in the dissipation region .",
    "the following formulae are their immediate consequences @xmath73 where @xmath74 is the flow reynolds number @xmath75    formula ( 26 ) we have derived in the newly defined hyperspace sheds some lights on this classical theory that is conducted within the physical space , in the sense that @xmath69 is not necessarily an elementary parameter any longer .",
    "according to kolmogorov@xcite viscous dissipation occurs only within the scale of kolmogorov length .",
    "then , the integral region of dissipation function ( 26 ) which is proportional to the kinematic viscosity is confined within a small volume of @xmath76 .",
    "dimensional analysis of ( 26 ) gives @xmath77 thus , from ( 27 ) through ( 30 ) we are given for the order of magnitude of @xmath78 : @xmath79 it is an indicative of strong in / out mass flow existent ( cf .",
    "the second of eq.(28 ) of the classical theory ) in the vicinity of this extremely small ` energy black hole ' where the flow loses kinetic energy @xmath69 converted into heat . inside this region",
    "@xmath80 the turbulence dies off rapidly towards @xmath81 .there must be , therefore , a drastic variation in the magnitude of @xmath78 which peaks at the boundary ridgeline between dissipation and inertial ranges surrounding the origin ( @xmath58=0 ) , and diminishes quickly inside .    in the neighborhood of this ` pseudo'-singularity",
    "it is obvious for the following conditions to hold : @xmath82 the latter condition warrants for local homogeneity in the sense of kolmogorov to hold most strictly in the localized eddy space for any inhomogeneous turbulence . under these circumstances , the 6d navier - stokes equation ( 20 ) together with equation of continuity",
    "reduce to @xmath83 @xmath84 which is nothing but the classical ( 3d ) equations for laminar viscous flows , as disguised through @xmath85 this rule reigns dissipation region as well as the adjacent region of inertial subrange surrounding it , where @xmath86-function diminishes outward off the pseudo - singularity until flow inhomogeneity starts to make its appearance .",
    "the solution as such , to be pursued in this space , is ` universal ' , namely , to be valid even for any shear turbulence .    according to kolmogorov@xcite ,",
    "the inertial range is where no viscous effects are operating .",
    "so we may claim that the potential flow is prevailing there .",
    "this speculation is supported by the assertion : ` _ potential flow is the solution of the navier - stokes equation in the region where no solid boundary is existent . _ ' now is the case with it , because no physical substances are intervening here in this space .",
    "the pseudo - singularity , as viewed from the domain of the inertial range , looks as if a genuine singularity , whose actual form is now to be identified .",
    "we start with checking if the local isotropy in the classical sense has physical reality .",
    "the isotropy assumption is equivalent to @xmath87 which is the alternative expression of robertson s theorem@xcite .",
    "substitution of ( 36 ) into equation of continuity ( 33 ) gives @xmath88 obviously , this is a source/ sink flow , corresponding to the velocity potential @xmath89 if @xmath90 is positive it represents a sink flow with mass flux @xmath91 vanishing at the origin . reminding that the dissipation range @xmath92 is the ` black hole ' of turbulent kinetic energy losing the amount by @xmath69 converted into heat every second , we see that no mass is supposed to be lost . thus solution ( 36 ) for spherical isotropy is ruled out .",
    "prospective singularity now to take over can be sought within potential flow regime as follows : it is obvious that operator @xmath93 commutes with laplacean operator , therefore @xmath94 represent a group of potential flows .",
    "in particular @xmath95 representing a dipole aligned with its axis parallel to @xmath96 direction is seen to meet the purpose .",
    "in fact a dipole is made up of a pair of sink / source of equal strength , so no mass flux is lost at this spot .",
    "thus simplest possible candidate for the pseudo - singularity is _ axially _ isotropic .",
    "the following observation from direct numerical simulation@xcite helps us draw a more precise picture of our pseudo - singularity : in the physical space the dissipation occurs only within a confined volume of ` elementary particles ' of rod shape , randomly dispersed in turbulent medium .",
    "they all have a shape like a worm with radius @xmath97 of several kolmogorov lengths and several ten times of it lengthwise ( @xmath98 ) , rotating round their own axes .",
    "their lifetime is about @xmath99 .",
    "so to say , they are like firefly worms illuminating light for their lifetime as small as of the order of far subseconds .",
    "this picture when mapped onto our eddy space is such that two spinning dipoles having opposite sign and rotation are placed at @xmath100 respectively , where the axis of symmetry is @xmath101 axis .",
    "the direction j = 1 is the direction of motion of turbulence - generating body , representing the only vector prescribing the fluid motion .",
    "the flow field induced by the pair of spinning dipoles @xmath102 with @xmath103 and @xmath104 standing for velocities induced by dipoles and line vortices , placed at points ( 40 ) , respectively : @xmath105 @xmath106 where @xmath107 is the unit vector designating @xmath101 axis . expression ( 42 ) is direct consequence of ( 37 ) and ( 39 ) , and that for ( 43 ) is biot - savart s law for a line vortex with infinitesimal length directing @xmath101-axis and with circulation @xmath108 .",
